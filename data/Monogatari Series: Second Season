Now go see Hateful Eight. Tarantino films are about as hard to follow as Monogatari

if you think those are hard, try to watch the movies that inspired tarantino.

start with 7 samurai

Do I watch Hateful Eight before Pulp Fiction or after?

Can't tell if you are serious or not. Either way Kill Bill is the only Tarantino film that I know has a sequel.

I think I need a Tarantino watch order...

Just watch in any order you want but make sure to watch the tooth brush scene before every movie
>> ARTICLE
Watch Hateful Eight up until the intermission, then Kill Bill part 1, Pulp Fiction, the second half of Hateful Eight, Kill Bill part 2, and wrap it all up with Django Unchained

I would rep the shit out of that Shinobu watch, where can I get it?

Pretty shit tbh imo, the correct order for those is C --> A --> B --> D.

Incorrect - C should be last - **Hitagi End**.

D is obviously first - **Shinobu Time**.

It starts with Shinobu being introduced, followed by everyone else. Everyone starts to die one by one, until it reaches the End. The Hitagi End.

To be honest I think going outside is an optional part of the experience, but it certainly gives a little bit more insight on the life of the characters' and their actions and motivations. Skip going outside if you want, or simply do it whenever you feel like it, like if you need to go to the shop or something. It really enhanced my experience and enjoyment, though.

You forgot a mandatory watching of [Ghost Stories (Bakemono Monogatari). English Dub only.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxJ4VWoeOzs)
>> ARTICLE
Is that serious?
>> ARTICLE
You mean its title? Probably. Bakrmono is apparition (can be tl as monster or ghost) monogatari is story or tale. Bakemonogatari is a play on words that basically reads as ghostory

If you mean that dub, also yes. The original english dub was basically ad-libbed by the voicee actors, resulting in what amounts to the first abridged series.

Yup

It might get lost in the humour,but definitely give a try to Zaregoto series.

There are five volumes translated.
The sixth one recently got an update.
[Here](http://www.suiminchuudoku.net/tl/index.php?title=Zaregoto) are 3-5 fan translated.

BTW,on the page I linked,the volumes 4 and 5 are listed as volume 5.

How hard can it be to just open google and type "sidebar items hud binding of isaac rebirth"... Wait, wrong question. 

Still, it takes like 0.5s to find answer.
>> ARTICLE
The general consensus is the airing order, which goes like this:

Bake -> Nise -> Neko: Kuro -> Second Season -> Hana -> Tsuki -> Owari -> Koyomi (currently airing)
>> ARTICLE
I've always wondered

Is Ore Monotagari actually a part of this series or is it just a coincidence that they share the same name? 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari means "story" in Japanese so it's a word they share in the title
>> ARTICLE
No, it just has a similar name :D

"monogatari" is Japanese for "story", so It's to be expected that more than one franchise would use it.

Hint: The Monogatari franchise always has "monogatari" as a part of a single word, and in some cases, it's an amalgamation (for example, "Bakemonogatari" is "bakemono" + "monogatari").
>> ARTICLE
But, Katanagatari isn't part of the series. It looks like it is from the name, but it's just from the same author (if I'm remembering correctly).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but Katanagatari lacks the "mono" part. It's true that they're by the same author though.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, you're remembering right. Both Katanagatari and Monogatari are by Nisio Isin.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you
>> ARTICLE
np \^\^
>> ARTICLE
koyomi after owari (which is the currently airing in ova format) and then owari s2 which is gonna air next season.

The movie Kizumonogatari can be watched at any time after bakemonogatari since its a prequel to all of this
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
only part 1 has been released yet, and not on BDs yet either.

So watching kizu after bake isnt a good idea since you would have to wait for the summer to do it. Just do what the other guy said and watch kizu when every movie releases, better that way
>> ARTICLE
When all the dust is settled, I'm curious what the fan consensus will be about the optimum time to watch Kizu. Your suggestion of "any time after bakemonogatari" is one possibility, but I can see people saying to watch it either immediately after bake, or after seeing the entire series (pseudo-airing order).

And as a fun twist, Nisio himself suggests that Kizu is a good introduction to the LN series.
>> ARTICLE
i mean kizu is the start of it all so it makes sense, the only reason i say after bake is because of the golden week. Or was golden week after neko:kuro, idk anymore, but the reason i said after bake is because that was the timing the novels where released
>> ARTICLE
Neko:Kuro is the golden week. I think Kizu is a good start to the series too, as there is lot of different things in it from the rest of the series and that knowing what happens in there, shinobu turns into different character in neko:kuro and bake.
>> ARTICLE
Having read Kizu also massively changes your perception of Shinobu when she shows up in Nise. I actually liked that Kizu was left as an implication for the vast majority of the Monogatari series (by Shaft), since I got to see things from a different angle during my post-Kizu rewatch.

Monogatari just begs for multiple watches anyway, so despite that I agree that Kizu is a pretty good start to the series.
>> ARTICLE
I just started reading Kizu recently and I feel like you'd be better off with the knowledge of Bake already with you. If for no other reason, than to get little tidbits of info. For example, Araragi makes a reference to Kanbaru in passing without saying who she is but I thought it was fun to know what he was talking about.
>> ARTICLE
I find it tough to judge, because I'd seen everything up to Owari before reading the novel. Catching the references was nice (though it works the other way too, since Bake references Kizu, if memory serves). The Monogatari series really needs to be rewatched/reread a second time anyway, so either works in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Don't even try just watch it in release order 
>> ARTICLE
This is usually the best answer.

Out of curiosity if someone were to already know Japanese would they skip step 33, would there be an alternate step 33, or would they not be able to watch Monogatari all together.

The alternate step 33 is to watch Nisemonogatari Episode 8.

Shouldn't you watch Urusei Yatsu before Bakemonogatari?

I certainly would *AT LEAST* watch Part III before Part IV, but not watching Part I and II seems like a waste, as they are both good in their own right.

Anywho, Part IV will most certainly be more than 40 episodes as it's source material is longer than Part III, which was 48 (?) episodes.

The currently airing [Nijiiro Days](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31414/) is what you're looking for.  It's a romcom following a group of friends so we get to see the development of several couples. 

From the poster/marketing it might look like a reverse harem or a bishonen show, but it's not. It's very good!

I also recommend [I can't understand what my husband is saying](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26349/) (both seasons) and [Ojiasan and Marshmellow](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31848/). They're shorts, but don't let that stop you, they have a lot of heart and manage to cover a lot of ground in spite of the short runtime.

What should I expect when I reach the Chimera Ant arc in HxH, and around what episode does it start?
>> ARTICLE
Expect a bit more of a serious story with overlapping sub plots. It is also a much longer arc than the rest so be prepared. Should start around ep75 and run to the end.
>> ARTICLE
I think it starts around ep 70, and I thought it was one of the best things I've ever seen. People do dislike it tho, but I love it. It's the arc that definitely shows ''the feels'' part of HxH.
>> ARTICLE
It starts around episode 75. The arc is way larger in scale than anything that came before it: it's a bit darker in tone (more along the lines of a proper seinen war drama than a battle shonen) and the "villains" are fantastically well written, the fights are engaging and there's a lot of thematic depth to dig into. Best arc of the show for me!

How do you guys deal with depression after finishing a show?

I mostly find another anime in a vastly different genre, so I don't find myself comparing it unfavorably to what I've just watched.

Why do people over analyze Evangelion?
>> ARTICLE
It has a lot of events/plot elements/characters that are up for interpretation, and it touches upon a lot of universal themes (isolation, human contact, etc.). 

As to why I'd say that people *over*analyze it: NGE has a lot of Christian symbolism (and the like) in which particularly dedicated fans find a lot of meaning. Anno has stated in interviews that some of the imagery was just thrown in there to look cool. As such, these interpretations, while interesting, may not make a whole lot of sense compared to what the creators of NGE were intending.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it really isn't as good as people are saying it is. I've watched it, and frankly I think that it really isn't anything special. The overanalasys has (at least with the people I see) largely just people stroking their own egos. This is an actual example a friend gave me: Friend: "You know how Rei appears behind Shinji when he's on the phone with his father, then she disappears. 
Me: "I guess, why?"
Friend: "That's a reference to End of Evangelion and the huge Rei, having the ability to send clones of itself across time and space to help events progress. I searched for hours, but nobody else found those really obscure and subtle clues like I did!" *smug smile*
Me: "Uhh, you might be reading too far into this."
Friend: "You just aren't smart enough to comprehend it."

Not really a question, but a dumb idea. What if the animation studios had some sort of way to donate them money. Feel like it would earn them some sort of income from the parts of the world where everything is "legally unavailable" :^
>> ARTICLE
I like the idea of more money going towards animation studios, but the issue it would create over here is that it would encourage the viewing of illegal streams. American companies like Funimation and Netflix pay good money for the rights to stream some shows, and it would undermine that market if we could donate 5 dollars to an animation studio's Patreon and then watch an illegal stream with a clean conscious.

When/Why did people start hating Aldnoah Zero's second season? 
I remember jamming to it, despite some minor quibbles and seeing a lot of positive comments here while it was airing.

Why has production seemingly halted for a lot of anime that seemed to be doing well (Baby Steps, Log Horizon, The Devil is a Part Timer, No Game No Life etc) ?
>> ARTICLE
Well even the first season of Aldnoah was average at best, then the ending happened and people were actually excited. Second season decided that the ending didn't happen and people were pissed. That was the main reason but there were plenty more honestly.

Most anime titles these days are adaptations which means they are only made to promote their respective source materials. If they sell well then that's a plus but that alone isn't always enough to continue production.

Is there a difference between normal episode 6 of Gurren Lagann and the "special, uncut" episode 6 of Gurren Lagann? I've seen both and they look exactly the fucking same to me. Am I missing something, or is this a joke Gainax played on me?
>> ARTICLE
The story goes that when the network was going through the scripts, episode 6 was approved because they thought it was going to be a lot less risque than it actually was (TTGL actually aired in a child-friendly time slot); and so when the GAINAX episode with all the GAINAX came in, they balked----and so episode 6 was hastily cut up and made a recap episode.

The uncensored version was included in the DVD/BDs.

It's been a while since I seen it, but I'm pretty sure the "normal" version that aired on TV started off with Kamina and Simon reminiscing about Adai village, whereas the uncensored version didn't.

This is kinda question more directed at the mods but how do you guys decide what is a anime and what isnt?  As it seems this question has been sturred up ever since certain shows have been released and people having all out fights about it.

>> ARTICLE
[Our definition of anime can be found in the rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_everything_posted_here_must_be_anime_specific)

>> ARTICLE
ah thanks! Didnt even know we had a whole section on this and kinda like you guys specifically address some of the more vocal shows about this argument. 

Then I guess a followup question is could I post something about batman on his birthday in a couple of days? As I do know he was in a anime, which was produced in japan for a Japanese audience but as he  is mostly portrayed in western media can I still make the post here?
>> ARTICLE
If you are talking about "Batman: Gotham Knight", that wouldn't fall under our definition, as it is only *animated* by Japanese studios, not produced, and animation is the only Japanese involvement. 

It's similar to how the episodes of Legend of Korra animated by Studio Pierrot are not considered anime.

Why is anime only called anime when made from Japan? Why can't it be made in America or any other place without it been called Cartoons? Just curious 
>> ARTICLE
Because anime is the Japanese word for animation, and cartoon is the English word for animation (of a certain kind). :) Technically they all just mean 'animation' though, but outside of Japan, anime is used to refer specifically to Japanese animation.  

AFAIK Japanese people refer to American cartoons as anime too. 
>> ARTICLE
Cause that's how the word came to be used. It's like how "literally" is used as "figuratively" in common speech. People just collectively decided to make "anime" stand for Japanese animation. Before anime people used to use "Japanimation" for Japanese animation. If everyone collectively decided to start calling Japanese animation something else, then whatever that word would be would also mean Japanese animation.

I would like to note here however, in Japan anime still refers to any animation including western animation. It's only in most other countries where anime is used to exclusively refer to Japanese animation.

It's also interesting to note that anime is short for Japanese "animeshon" which itself is actually a loanword from English "animation".

>> ARTICLE
What's the big deal with Jojo? I've not watched it but I've seen gifs and don't see why people rave about it so much? Am I missing something?
>> ARTICLE
There's a few reasons, but the most relevant I think is that it's a show that inspires a lot of hype from, in my opinion, rather cleverly constructed conflicts. That, and the art at times being extravagant or ridiculous helps build this sense of "this is really hammy, but also serious in it's own way."
>> ARTICLE
It's a fast paced action show with a set of really ordinary yet unique heroes and villains which never fails to surprise the viewer even if they know how a conflict will likely end. The setting is also unique since it goes back in time rather than forward in time like many action oriented shows.

There are also parts of episodes which serve as excellent memes.

You're welcome. If it helps with your decision, Monster Musume is **very** well animated. It's a step above most ecchi shows. Apparently each character had their own key animator to ensure the quality stayed consistent. And the (Japanese) voice acting is stellar.

In the monogatari series, why does everyone seem very nonplussed that supernatural things are going on around them?

And as a corollary, I know bakemonogatari starts in medias res, but as a viewer, are we expected just to be ok with realizing there's a lot more going on than we're seeing? Are there western examples of this kind of show, where lots of things aren't totally explained?

>> ARTICLE
>In the monogatari series, why does everyone seem very nonplussed that supernatural things are going on around them?

By the time Araragi interacts with most of the characters they've already had problems with the supernatural for a while. The premise of the show is a procedural - someone has a problem and like a detective he intervenes. They don't need much convincing at that point. The show is really clever by doing this, it gets introductions to the supernatural out of the way that would probably get tedious to do every time a new character shows up. 

>And as a corollary, I know bakemonogatari starts in medias res, but as a viewer, are we expected just to be ok with realizing there's a lot more going on than we're seeing?

I enjoyed piecing the background together like a puzzle from flashbacks and various hints. I assume that's part of the appeal and intentional (at least as far the the anime adaptation is concerned). 

>Are there western examples of this kind of show, where lots of things aren't totally explained?

Lost did this a lot and was followed by several shows that copied the formula (Flashforward, The Event, etc). BSG as well, at least on the Cylons side. Of course, this only works when the writers actually know where they're going. 

More recently Arrow started off by dropping the audience in the middle of his return as vigilante and over time made extensive use of flashbacks to explain how the current Oliver Queen got there (the first two seasons were **very** good).

Flashbacks are used so often now I don't even make a mental note anymore.

[I love moe](http://imgur.com/HhphUMn), but I'd struggle to answer your question. It essentially boils down to "why do people like what people like?" in the end of the day there's a certain ineffable quality to our preferences which makes it hard to answer this question.

I suppose I like the light-hearted feel-good nature? I get a lot of stress in life and it's good to be able to put something on and *know* it's not going to get dark and make you feel even worse. Even when shit does set you off (Non Non Biyori flashbacks), it's always bittersweet never full on drama.

A good Moe Sol is like a security blanket.
>> ARTICLE
My only thing against them is that I feel like absolutely nothing happens. I'm good for a decent slice of life every now and again, but I can only go so far.
>> ARTICLE
There doesn't have to be plot progression in SoL or moe shows, because the nature of those shows doesn't normally call for it. In a show like Non Non Biyori, there isn't plot progression (mainly because there isn't any plot, but there doesn't need to be), but there is character progression/change. A lot of SoL and moe shows are highly regarded because of their characters, whether it be their personality, design, chemistry, what have you. /u/semajdraehs put it well in saying that they're like a security blanket, because you don't really have to anticipate what's coming next; they're very consistent throughout.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose that's true. I'm just trying to find...I don't know...anything interesting about it that I might be missing. I loved Nichijou (I don't know whether it's considered moe or not, but I digress). It didn't necessarily have a plot. However, it kind of had a gimmick in that the characters were vibrant and emotionally extroverted, which complemented the zany style. I've just never been able to find interest in the slowness and the (what seems like from the outside) overly generous amounts of talking that comes with a lot of the normal moe stuff. I suppose that's just a clash of interests though. Maybe it's just not for me.

From the watch order wiki:

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) -> JoJo's Bizzare Adventure: Stardust Crusaders -> JoJo's Bizzare Adventure: Stardust Crusaders Season 2 - > JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable

The Phantom Blood movie and the OVA series are alternate versions of 2012 and Stardust Crusaders.

For the OVA series:

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2000) --> JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993)

This seems backwards, and that's because it is. But this series isn't normal to begin with.

Phantom Blood is the theatrical movie that covers the events of the beginning of 2012, but it was so poorly received by fans and the mangaka himself that it was cancelled and was never released on home video, so it cannot be found online.

They have average scores, but I enjoy them way too much. I can see why people don't like them that much because it overuses themes and cliches seen in past anime. I love repetitive stuff and the characters are fun to watch.

Yeah! you get me! It feels awesome just starting a show that you have no idea what it is about and it ends up being like one of these.

I'm like the only person that I've seen here even just try to actively promote Sora no Otoshimono. It was pretty popular on MAL last I checked but the show isn't talked about much here which to me is upsetting. Because that is easily one of the funniest shows I've seen ever. It's very self aware almost on the level of parody.

Really liked it. Great comedy, fun characters, and great interactions.

One of the funniest and most absurd romantic comedies I've ever seen. Akane is the best troll character ever.

I can handle fan service really well ever since I watched Monmusu. I mostly look at what you said from Haganai in all of these anime.  

>Great comedy, fun characters, and great interactions.
>> ARTICLE
> Dropped it after episode 3, because that fanservice made me physically uncomfortable.

The fanservice dragged that down so hard. The comedy was on-point, but the fanservice just felt thrown in to attract attention. It's a real shame.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I wouldnt put all of those in the same category at all.  

I love Mayo Chiki. 

I haven't seen Yuushibu, but it looks interesting so PTWed. 

I have extremely mixed feelings about Haganai. Its fun and funny, but then you get sudden 9 and 12 year old nudity and I had to drop it, especially because the girls look even younger than they actually are in that show.  I don't like using the word "pedophilia" that much but I feel this show qualifies. 

Jitsu wa Watashi Wa is one of my favorite shows ever.  Its just silly, and sweet. It does not use crutches like too much ecchi content, and I laughed extremely hard whenever the glasses and the pidgeons showed up. 

Sora no Otosbimoni is an extremely fun and entertaining pile of shit.  Its like the male version of a spanish soap opera. 
>> ARTICLE
>   I don't like using the word "pedophilia" that much but I feel this show qualifies. 

Well, some scenes are risqu and all but they usually aren't shown off as all that sexual. Just as little brats who gets taken care of by their older siblings. I suppose bathing with little siblings does seem pretty risqu in the west. While it's not really considered that big a deal in Japan with its public bathing culture.
>> ARTICLE
I guess so.  I feel like little sister and little nun teacher girl are sexualized a bit too much though. Especially because theyre both shown topless. 

It could be a cultural difference, but I feel like he creators were intentionally pushing the envelope.  And also, just because its a different culture does not mean its right. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess their general brattiness and childishness is why I just don't really see them as all that sexual. Compared to something more obviously sexual like Moetan. But yeah, I can only imagine how western TV stations might deal with nude brats like that. 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much, except I would say I love MayoChiki enough to demand a second season. I usually don't like traps at all in any form, but this was a HUUGE exception!

Other than that I don't really hold an opinion except that Haganai is fantastic as well.
>> ARTICLE
Mayo Chiki would be a reverse trap right?  I love those, traps are just weird to me.  

Im sure this runs afoul of some social justice people
>> ARTICLE
Oh I'm sure it does.

Good thing I'm nothing like them LOL

But yeah technically she would be a reverse trap. I do like the tsundere childhood friend (who won't win no matter what) better tho. Call me dumb and a bandwagoner but I will stay by her side till the end T.T
>> ARTICLE
Jitsu wa Watashi wa was an okay adaption but it never really got to the great bits which I love the manga for. It was just seriously underwatched that season I'd say though. Those who did see it were treated to some really lovable dopes. Opening song is great too.!

>> ARTICLE
I can not specifically remember, but throughout the discussion threads for Aiura, people mention how it is a really drawn out extended pun.

EDIT: Did some researching and Aiura is pronounced the same way as iUra, an apple product in Japan. Just a bunch of layered puns. I can not decide though if the pun makes reference to Steve Job's actual cancer though. I do not think it does because of how cancer (zodiac) and cancer (disease) are two different characters/readings in Japanese. I might be wrong on that though.

Ok so do you guys really believe in and love your waifu or is it just a big joke?
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to explain. As a character? Definitely. As a minor obsesson? Sure. I mean, I've even got a big poster of her on my wall. [See?](http://imgur.com/o7ypkYc)

But do I love her the same way I love a real, flesh-and-blood person? No. Absolutely not. I'm sure some people do, but for me, it's not anything more than a minor fictional infatuation that I can clearly separate from reality. When I'm in love with a real person, it eats my thoughts up, you know? When I was in love with my ex-gf, everything I perceived was her-tinted. I couldn't go through a second of my day without thinking of her. She was like the axis around which my brain spun. That's what being madly in love is to me.

Not everything in my life is Nadeko-tinted. I just like her a bunch.

What's with all the "Stuck in a Video Game" series? 

No other medium has had so many entries into this specific set-up and yet anime has already had so many as to wear out the tropes in a couple years.

It can't just be because of SAO right? I know it was popular, but that was a few years ago and now it's half hated half loved anyway.
>> ARTICLE
There were **tons** of cheesy US and Canadian live action B movies/TV in the 90s and early 00s about virtual reality and the internet. They've mostly been forgotten now since they were legitimately terrible. Some of the few good movies were The Matrix, Existenz and Ghost in the Shell in Japan that pushed the distinction between the mind and the physical body and how that could be woven into a story. 

The people who enjoyed those eventually started writing. 

It took a few years and a few false starts for the LNs to reach critical mass to get anime adaptations, but yeah, once SAO started printing money it all accelerated. 


Like other mediums trends in anime go through the usual:

 - breakout hit
 - maximum saturation
 - die off a bit
 - breakout "deconstruction" hit + resurgence
 - deconstruction maximum saturation
 - die off a bit
 - reconstruction breakout hit
 - etc.

Examples trends for anime:

 - magical girls
 - mecha
 - card game tournaments
 - harems (MC is unimportant)
 - power fantasy (OP MCs)
 - magic battle schools
 - idols
 - stuck in a video game/world

Examples trends for Hollywood movies: 
 
 - westerns
 - big action protagonist (i.e. Rambo, Die Hard)
 - buddy cops
 - *Something* Movie!
 - found footage/shaky cam
 - high fantasy
 - urban fantasy (vampires)
 - survival/battle royale (i.e. the original Battle Royale, Hunger Games)
 - superheroes

It's like a breath of fresh air. It's not set in a high school or a fantasy world; it's adults working in an industry (specifically, working in the anime industry, so it feels informative and has lots of meta-references for the hobby we love). It honestly reminds me of *The Office*, but with less cringe and more moe. Is it the best thing ever? Not by a long shot. It's not very deep or impactful, but it feels more "real" than other shows.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very unique show. It's a refreshing break from the "standard" formats people are used to. 

It's also a character driven show. While this doesn't make it good, well done character based shows are often very good. Shirobako also manages to have a very big cast while still giving all the characters a distinct personality and role.

Is doing something unpredictable that catches the viewer off-guard, like killing the protagonist in the middle of S4, (automatically) considered "good writing"?

Excluding cases where literally everybody else dies too in a similar fashion and where it's not "unpredictable" anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Well killing off an MC or a primary character is unexpected writing, which is sometimes a good thing.  In the few animes I've seen where they do something like this it's usually unexpected and they "deal" with it rather well.

I could list a bunch of cases where it improves the story but I have no way to tag the spoilers without the tag itself being a spoiler, so, yeah.

Now I do stay about 2 seasons behind on anime and only watch what is considered "good" after 2 seasons of the hype train slowing down.  I work two jobs and don't have time to "try" a series if I end up sinking 6 hours into and then hate it.

But I can't really think of a time that a MC or primary/secondary/tertiary character died that I said "Fuck this shit" and stopped watching, usually it really adds to character development.  For example, and this is not a spoiler because it's in the description everywhere, in AnoHana, the death the character are dealing with really strips away a lot of the bullshit, and I feel that's the case with a lot of other animes as well.  It's kind of the "shit hits the fan Act 2" storyline and what's great about the ones I've watched is sometimes Act 3 doesn't resolve it which is subversion of traditional storytelling and, if done at least competently, sets it apart from others.

I've rarely seen it used poorly, but I watch SoL/Dramas/Mysteries, stuff like that, very story driven and while I've been sad, upset, confused, angry, I never felt like dropping any of the shows, it just made me want to see what came next for better or worse.

Your mileage may vary.

She's probably either the best or the second best, most well-rounded, and most well-developed character in Monogatari depending on your perspective.

Kizu made me like her a lot more tbh fam. I think the reason I rode the CAT A WORST train for as long as I did was just that I burnt out on her from watching SS immediately after Nekomonogatari Kuro.

Its been around for quite a while and if I'm remembering right, it foreshadows [Monogatari SS](/s "Mayoi moving on, so its one of those AMVs that fans come back to to experience the feels again, though I don't think a lot of english only fans realised this until a year after the upload when Shinobu Time aired.

I think the original was Fate/Stay Night, actually, with "being Lancer is suffering".

I think it originated with the parody series Carnival Phantasm, in which Lancer is the butt of all jokes he's involved in. And he generally ends up dead by the end of the episode. Even if his only appearance in the episode was a couple of seconds to establish that he was killed.

Oh great, a thread dedicated to me.  
  
1) In what order should I watch code geass, there are a lot of different ovas and series on it?  
  
2) Will they ever continue the anime version of Tokyo ghoul? Even if it ended in a bad spot, maybe just a version for anime continuation they could do.

Edit 1) I watched F/Z before UBW and people say F/Z has major spoilers for HF. Since I haven't watched HF will it really be a major spoiler, or not that bad?

What is your opinion on Emiya Shirou? 
>> ARTICLE
Masterful depiction of the power and weaknesses of an obsessive idealism driven by mental incapacity.  He's dull, simple, occasionally sexist, but the way that he never betrays his the ideals entrusted to him is inspiring and moving.  

I also think that anyone that attacks him for his lack of humanity and his apparent stupidity is cynical and is getting far too hung up on the reason of his actions, turning themselves off completely to the themes of the power of emotion and idealism that drive his character.  Shirou is far more grounded in romanticism than realism, as is Fate/stay night in general.  Every spirit and master has his or her own philosophies, beliefs, and  convictions, and the Grail War tests the limits of these core components of the soul. How fitting that the protagonist of such a romantic conflict is a helpless idealist, struggling to find beauty in a world where he only remembers the pain.
>> ARTICLE
> Masterful depiction of the power and weaknesses of an obsessive idealism driven by mental incapacity. He's dull, simple, occasionally sexist, but the way that he never betrays his the ideals entrusted to him is inspiring and moving.

Shirou is the Forrest Gump of anime.
>> ARTICLE
There's an interesting character underneath there somewhere, but I dislike how he bumbles his way into things and ass-pulls his way out so often. I understand the author was trying to subvert the viewer's expectations, but the eroge cliches were played a bit too straight. He came off more of an incorrigible idiot rather than a disturbed individual like intended. He has his moments though like the basement scene in Fate and has a good character arc in HF.
>> ARTICLE
Love the guy. Probably because I have a thing for characters with hero complexes. 
>> ARTICLE
HF Shirou is one of my most favorite characters. Fate/UBW I'm pretty meh on but they serve the purpose of enhancing HF Shirou for me.

Anime-wise, he can get annoying but he's pretty great in the final route. Hopefully the HF movies do him justice.
>> ARTICLE
Did somebody say... [JUSTICE?!](http://imgur.com/Dc9LiTv)
>> ARTICLE
*Trigger, off*
>> ARTICLE
I fuckin love him. I know he's got a few deficits as a character and varies wildly from route to route. There are certainly valid complaints to be made about Emiya Shriou. But do you know what isn't a valid complaint? "Ugh! He's such a retard! I mean he puts himself in danger all the time! I mean, who does that?" Yeah, because it's so fucking awful to put your life on the line for other people. That's not horrible or stupid. It's fuckin' heroic, and when people do it in real life, we give them medals. When a person runs into a burning building against all rational sense to save a little child trapped on the top floor, we do not chide them for being a "fucking white knight" when they return to the bottom with a pan-seared four year old clutched to their chest. There is literally no reason to do the same in fiction.

Shirou is idealistic, dedicated, and heroic. He is a fucking hero of justice. Like I said, there's a number of reasons to dislike him. I don't dislike him, but there are a number of reasons I can see one would. I just can't stand it when these late-teenage edgelords think that because he's not a remorseless, cold blooded killer like Dear Old Dad, he's somehow worse off for it.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't like him at all. I started watching UBW with the epilogue episode and I was like "Fuck yeah! This lady is awesome! She kicks ass, she's cute, and she's super snarky! Can't wait to see more of her!" and then the perspective switched to that orange-haired moron. And you know what was the worst? Not that Shirou was stupid, but that Rin also became stupid in his proximity! 
>> ARTICLE
> became stupid in his proximity! 

if i had to summarize shirou in 5 words....
>> ARTICLE
A stubborn fool who would have been dead without plot-armor.
>> ARTICLE
I've never been able to take the plot-armor criticism of Shirou seriously. It's a necessary flaw of the adaptation. Anybody who's played the VN has seen Shirou brutally murdered dozens of times, but in order to turn that into an anime, he has to get out of all the life-threatening situations on the first try instead of failing over and over again while you try to figure out where you made a wrong decision.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is that the "right" decision as depicted in the anime is still full of convenience for him and that is what is really hard to take seriously. 

How often does it need to be repeated that that "read the VN" argument doesn't hold up when judging the anime.


>> ARTICLE
I kind of think that is the point of Shirou though. He was the epitome of a dangerously nave and good intentioned protagonist type and he rode a dangerous line constantly due to the hero complex everybody knows he has except for himself. They never really build him up to be a virtuous hero that much because it's clear he is afflicted with severe trauma that puts him in a suicidal situation all the time (sorta like Suzaku in Geass). I suppose some of his situations are pretty outlandish in how he gets out of them. But it's also true that the Emiya blood in him is incredibly powerful in the Fate lore.

>> ARTICLE
Think it's a phase. Like earlier all anime was about mechas, now all anime is about moe SoL's or ecchi trapped in a videogame(ofc that's a severe overgeneralisation). Give it time and we'll eventually have new trend.
>> ARTICLE
Nostalgia goggles. We tend to only remember the good anime from the past, there was a tons of shitty copypasta shows back then too.

>> ARTICLE
Shinobu, like all the other girls, has some arcs where she's featured very prominently, some where she's a supporting character, and some where she doesn't appear at all, and they're mixed up and spread out across all the different seasons. Her most prominent arc (Mayoi Jiangshi) is in SS, and she has two arcs named after her (Shinobu Time and Shinobu Mail) in SS and Owari, but isn't actually featured all that prominently in either (and barely appears at all outside of those three arcs). I think the season with the highest average concentration of Shinobu per episode is probably Nise.
>> ARTICLE
There's not really a question here, but I'm inferring you meant to ask, "Why isn't she in other arks?"  And the answer is, she's not needed.

[All Series Monagatory Spoilers](/s "Shinobu is Araragi's insecurity.  In beginning of the series, he's ignoring it.  He's confident because he has a mentor that takes care of all the weird shit that's happening.  Then he bails and Shinobu has to hold the weight, the duty of his mentor is passed on and he's confused and scared.  In the ark with the snake girl (sorry been a while since I watched it and I'm terrible with remembering Japanese names) he didn't call on her and she almost died, he almost failed.  He starts leaning on her more and more until their conversations lead to him realizing he didn't REALLY need her.  That he'd started sorting out almost everything on his own.  e.g. the Neko arc.  By the time Nise rolls around, he's okay with taking things on his own, but she's still there sometimes, representing his doubt.  He could have called out her powers and destroyed the demon hunters but didn't, he solved it his own way.  Sure she's around a lot, but in a much different capacity.  It's almost as if he's battling with himself whenever they talk, the bath scene being particularly prominent.  She's an ever shrinking part of him and is written as such.  If I'm wrong (which I could be, remember long time ago) feel free to correct me, but that was the impression i got all along.")

>> ARTICLE
Then what do you think Shinobu's role when Araragi was facing down Black Hanekawa at the end of Neko:Black symbolizes?

Also, can you clarify what you mean about him interacting with Shinobu? Do you mean that whenever they interact, that symbolizes him dealing with his doubts? And when she's not around as much, it means he's more confident in himself?

What are the pros and cons of dubbed vs subbed? I think I'm used to watching subbed because I used to have fears that the English dub would be intended for TV and be toned down\censored, but I'm not sure how much that's the case anymore.
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak to which is better for the story because I think part of that is opinion and part of that has to do with how well the dub/sub are done. But I will say that if it's a show that is very visually striking or has well done animation I really like dubs just so I can fully appreciate everything.  There have been a few shows that I liked as subs, then I went back and realized how much I missed visually because I was focused on reading.
>> ARTICLE
1 not everything is dubbed (even more if you aren't english)

2 you get the show how the makers wanted it, and some japanese vo's are just straight out better and add a certain feel or tone to the character.

3 japanese jokes don't necessarly work dubbed. Many things are just lost in translation, jojo engrish is a hillarious example

4 with dubs you don't have to read subs. Kinda obvious and redundant but it just depends how much it bothers you

There's good dubs aswell but some of them are really cringey
>> ARTICLE
Lets be honest, Subs are actually pretty bad

Unless you actually speak Japanese you very likely only have a rough idea via subs of what is actually being said
>> ARTICLE
well better than dubs at least. Dunno why you think generally all subs are bad lol
>> ARTICLE
Because translating Japanese does not actually work as well as people think it does

Japanese has to fairly often use loanwords because of how incompatible the languages are even in everyday life.

I basically cannot watch anime with subs because I can speak Japanese and holy crap are they almost always inaccurate, The general gist of it is correct usually but it's rarely what is actually being said 
>> ARTICLE
They are inaccurate, but subs still throw much less information out of the window than dubs do (usually). When dubbing a show, you have to fit certain timeframes (with a small leeway), so you'll either end up with unnatural sounding English translations or a bunch of information and nuance lost.

Also, as much as I like certain English voice actors, hearing them for the 100th time can be a bit tiring. I realize that this happens in Japanese dubs as well, but it's much less apparent (probably because there's a larger pool of VAs to choose from). 

I generally feel that the original voices fit their characters better as well, and there are jokes or - going even further - *shows* that you just cannot translate. In subtitles there's an opportunity for TL notes, but with dubs? I cannot imagine e.g. Bakemonogatari or Joshiraku ever being dubbed for this very reason.


Since I started learning Japanese, the first and third points are even more apparent: by not having an equivalent for just honorifics in English, a huge amount of nuance is lost before the translation even begins. I'm only taking this example because even for non-Japanese speakers, the `-kun/chan/san/sama/etc.` concept is fairly easy to grasp (even if they don't always do it correctly). 

More than that, the lack of distinction between polite/impolite speech, there only being one first-person singular pronoun ^[1] , and the list goes on-and-on. By watching the dubs, you basicly choose to ignore the loss of information, but it's a loss nonetheless. And if you choose to watch them dubbed, you don't even have the opportunity to pick it up from speech or less-localized subtitles (a lot of them choose to keep honorifics for example).

You guys talk a lot about production value when rating shows, but what exactly is it? I get its the money that went into making the animation look good but how specifically can you judge it?
>> ARTICLE
Smoothness of the animation (shows the number of frames that were animated- more frames = smoother = higher production value, generally speaking) 

Complexity of the animation (number of shots/edits) also plays a role in production value

Quality of editing and direction usually raises production values- i.e. a director/editor with more experience can create a stronger experience than someone with less experience. That's why some look forward to specific directors, etc.

Those are just a handful of ways to evaluate a show.
>> ARTICLE
Things like:

 - high FPS fluid animation vs jerky movement 
 - time spent on characters moving versus panning on still shots
 - shadows (on characters' faces, arms, ground) vs flat colors
 - high detail character designs (number of individual locks of hair, whether they move independently or together, patterns on clothes and whether those move naturally, wave in the wind, etc.)

The Canipa Effect videos on One Punch Man go into more detail:   

 - Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDmZM3GkYxU

So I saw that Bakemonogatari aired a bit ago. I know there is more to the series but it seems like kind of a web figuring out where to start? Maybe I'm over complicating it? I have Hulu and Crunchyroll and tend to stick to those as I do most of my viewing mobile. I know Crunchyroll has some of this series but I'm just here scratching my head wondering where to start.
>> ARTICLE
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/watch_order#wiki_-monogatari_.2F_bakemonogatari) is the watch order for the Monogatari series. For Bakemonogatari, I think Crunchyroll only has 12 episodes. The last 3 episodes were released as OVAs, and are not legally available. Correct me if I'm wrong. So you'll probably have to sail the high seas for the last 3.

Was there any romance development in Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm? Like do the main characters get together? The VN adaptations I've seen usually follow a route and get the MC to be with someone but this anime didn't seem like it was going to do that.
>> ARTICLE
[Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm spoilers](/s "It went the sports anime route - Asuka and her team's rise in Flying Circus"). 
It was one of my favorite anime from last season, so I think it was a good choice. The characters were well developed (as well as it could in a single cour), the flying animation was pretty good and they did a fine job making the competitions exciting. The SoL moments between the side characters were also very enjoyable.

Do people who watch intense shows like Attack on Titan also watch stuff like Mayo-Chiki?

I know I do. I don't stick to one particular genre, I just enjoy good shows.

And going strictly by the numbers, the intense really popular shows like AoT, Kill la Kill, Fate: UBW get watched by a large portion of this subreddit, so there will inevitably be overlap with the romcom or moe loving crowd. 

And there are series that mix radically different genres, like Black Bullet.

Why is discussing/mentioning pirate websites not allowed? Leaves ne with this elitist feel 
>> ARTICLE
Because that stuff is illegal, and reddit as a whole prohibits posting illegal content. If that kind of stuff was posted to reddit, the whole site would've been taken down ages ago.
>> ARTICLE
Because it encourages watching from pirate websites. For a subreddit dedicated to anime, we shouldn't be encouraging ways to not support the medium. Also, there's no point mentioning the sites anyways. People can just google and the first result will probably be it.

Edit: Looking at MissyPie's comment, I guess I'm wrong, but that's my opinion on the whole thing

Discussion is fine as long as it's within comments and doesn't mention any names or links. E.g You may say "I don't watch anime on Crunchyroll, I watch it illegally" or "I pirate anime" or "I torrent" and so on.

As for *why*, it's actually part of the [Terms of Service.](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement#section_reddit_is_for_your_personal.2C_lawful_use) /r/anime is just complying. Almost all the bigger media subreddits do too. :) (/r/books, /r/gaming, /r/games, /r/movies, /r/comicbooks, /r/music)
>> ARTICLE
So what about /r/manga? Fairly large and nothing but illegal content there
>> ARTICLE
/r/manga probably couldn't function without scans and fan translations. It just takes too long for official manga translations (if a series even gets one, which is a big "if") and they're often terrible quality. I mean, just look at the official *Steins;Gate* manga.

Just because it's a rule doesn't mean everyone follows it. Reddit aren't too strict about it, but we'd rather be complying than not. 

Additionally the difference between 75k subs and 351k is pretty huge.

What's up with konsuba? Everytime I come to this sub there is fan art posted. At first glance the show looks like any other mmo/fantasy/harem mixed in with comedy elements, am I wrong?Also, everyone is also a fan of jojo on this sub, is it comparable or better than hxh?
>> ARTICLE
I watched KonoSuba and I'd say its one of the funniest comedies I've seen in anime.
>> ARTICLE
It's actually good. The focus is on the comedy, the mmo/fantasy/harem is parodied/played with and the characters are hilarious.

JoJo is more over the top than HxH, but it's done in a very enjoyable way.  I'll say for a long time I'd seen the JoJo love but wasn't sure I'd actually like it, but after giving it a shot I love it.

And, if it helps, I like HxH too.

KonoSuba is a parody of the "trapped in a video game" genre. It's humor is extremely successful, the characters are all likable, and the girls are cute. A great recipe for /r/anime to lose their mind over it.

[Space patrol luluco](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32681/Uchuu_Patrol_Luluco) which has its first episode out, its only 8 minute episodes and is silly but funny, Its made by Trigger, the director is pretty well known, (he did gurren lagann, panty and stocking, FLCL, kill la kill) which looking at you're MAL you will be interested in.

[Kiznaiver](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31798/Kiznaiver), hasnt started yet, it isnt the same director but is being done by studio Trigger the same studio as the above series.

[Sakamoto desu ga?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32542/Sakamoto_desu_ga) i don't know much other than its a comedy and people showed off some stuff from the manga, the basic premise seems to be when you have those guys in school anime who is just super popular and perfect and nothing is wrong (but often there is something) it seems to be that but this guy actually is perfect like even seemingly to super human levels, it seems quite funny.

This is what you're looking for:

>> ARTICLE
BD often is uncensored, whereas TV content has to be censored according to Japanese TV content laws.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, that's right. 

But I was wondering more regarding the quality of the drawing and the content of the frames. I think I remember seeing a comparison on Nisekoi:'s BD and TV with entirely different frames at times.


>> ARTICLE
For some anime, there's not much difference, but for others, there's a big difference. BD _can_ provide a lot more quality if there was quality there to begin with. The 1080P content that streams to TVs in Japan is quite good to begin with but BD obviously can provide a lot more data, so if it's a series you love, it's worth it. For popular older shows, they go back and re-do the content with more data for BD releases (like older Ghibli movies, etc.)
>> ARTICLE
**Q1 :**

OVA = original video animation  
OAD = original animation disk

These two are pretty much interchangeable nowadays (though the "video" in ova used to mean VHS a long time ago) and are usually one or more full length episodes. They could be canon and advance the plot like the Kokoro Connect ones or they could be fluff, just more fun with the characters, sometimes fanservice heavy beach/hot spring episodes. 

Specials are usually short, just a few minutes long and don't really have a plot. Usually they're comedy skits with the characters of the main series. 

All three usually come bundled with the BD or select light novel/manga volumes. 

There are also web specials that are released on the anime's website concurrently with the airing of the main series to act as marketing - like the Overlord and Lord Marksman and Vanadis specials (and were pretty funny).

**Q2 :** 

It depends on the studio. Shaft is well known for making noticeable art changes, usually for the better. The norm is fixing animation errors, adding details where the production had to take shortcuts to deliver the episode in time, redrawing background characters that were stick-figure level, that sort of thing. Often the BDs will be uncensored whereas the TV broadcasts will cover things with beams of light, shadows, zooms. 

If you can, you should always watch the BD version. Though there was that one time the BD version was actually more censored. Just Shaft being Shaft. 

Google "TV vs BD comparison" for Shaft shows (like the Monogatari series), Ore Twintails ni Narimasu (massive quality improvement), High School DxD, Monster Mususme, Tokyo Ghoul, Terraformars and you'll see lots of examples.

>> ARTICLE
Except Haruhi is much better if you watch it in broadcast order rather than chronological.  They aired that way because many of the stories in the books were written out of order as well. 

I haven't watched Monogatari yet, but it wouldn't surprise me if the same were true, considering it's not written chronologically either...
>> ARTICLE
> Except Haruhi is much better if you watch it in broadcast order rather than chronological. 

Not if you include the 2nd season and movie.
>> ARTICLE
As a huge fan of the Monogatari series, I think it is far better out of chronological order. Just like how Haruhi was, but I honestly think it's more important to watch by broadcast order than Haruhi was. 

It's very clearly intentionally made to be viewed/read out of order, and I think watching it chronologically is a disservice to that. I've done both, and chronologically, it's just plot, and a huge part of the dialogue/themes really don't flow or matter, which IMO is like 80% of where the charm of the show lies. 
>> ARTICLE
Kizumonogatari really should be seen after Bakemonogatari, since it explain Araragi and kiss-shot relationship, and it was also intended to be broadcast after bakemonogatari until Shaft endless delay of the movie, so I wouldn't say full broadcast order.
>> ARTICLE
Well I wouldn't say that since no one has seen it yet. At this point, no one has a choice, unless they want to just not watch the series at all until it comes out one day.

We'll see then. I don't think much will really be added with the movie though, as badly as I want to watch it, since at this point you can pretty much piece the entirety of the story together by just watching the series. I think the show was specifically written for that to be done as well. Kizu would just show it all for that satisfying confirmation of all the stuff.

Either way, no one can really say anything about when the movie should be watched amongst the rest of the franchise. Of course it was intended to be released long ago, but anything could have changed since then. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm mainly talking about people going into it after it is completed, if they don't want to read Kizu after Bakemonogatari. 

I have read the novel, Kizumonogatari really should have been showed right after bakemonogatari.

> I think the show was specifically written for that to be done as well.
Shaft stay true to the LN, so no it wasn't done in that way.

> Kizu would just show it all for that satisfying confirmation of all the stuff.

Not really it is mainly giving depth to the relationship between Kiss-shot and Araragi, that makes the relationship you see them having much more interesting in neko-Kuro, Nise and SS. I can't say much since it would be spoiler, but you also miss buildup to some stuff, which is a shame.

Yes we can, as mentioned shaft stay true to their material, so it is quite easy to say. 

> Of course it was intended to be released long ago, but anything could have changed since then. 

This is classic Shaft, they fuck up their budged, and suck at doing stuff before it is the last minute. If you have watched bakemonogatari while it aired you will know what I'm talking about.
>> ARTICLE
The official English translation of Kizu [is due on December 15th](http://www.amazon.com/KIZUMONOGATARI-Wound-Tale-NISIOISIN/dp/1941220975/). I only wish it was available digitally.
>> ARTICLE
Not really since this is how the story was published. Haruhi was animated out of order during the first season to improve story flow due to a lack of climax if they followed it chronologically at the time. When the second season aired it became a moot point so the whole thing was aired chronologically since there was climax in form of the movie, and the series being a more natural slice of life regardless. 

Basically, if s1 aired chronologically it would have hit the dramatic peak at episode 5, and just been random stuff until the end. With s2 it all worked fine in regular order.

In contrast to that, Monogatari was written in purposeful out of order even in original novel form. It doesn't want you to know things at certain points and wants you to have retrospective revelations at others.
>> ARTICLE
I never realised how complicated it was. I mean, in my head I could perfectly see and order everything, but looking at the charts was... confusing somehow

OK, good knowing that there is an actual conclusion then and it won't be dragged out!
>> ARTICLE
here's a bit of a simple explanation:

the title of the last two volumes are

* Endstory (pt1)

* Continue-Endstory (pt 2)

then Hanamonogatari is kind of "the epilogue" because originally Koimonogatari was gonna be the last one

NisioIsin is writing another one that supposedly takes place in the same universe and shares title but somehow has nothing to do with the main cast. It's about a forgetful detective girl and a guy, don't know a lot of details tbh

Make sure you watched episodes 13-15 of Bakemonogatari!
>> ARTICLE
I did, but can you explain the hype behind the series? I mean it was a good character driven show but I don't really see it as a masterpiece. Is it because of a lot of cultural references that i don't see it? Or is the show a bit overhyped?
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I'm the wrong person to ask, actually.

I just watched through episode 12 of Bakemonogatari. Been doing my research to see if I want to continue watching it, and thought I should mention episodes 13-15 because they're often overlooked.

I'm personally struggling over my feelings towards Bakemonogatari. There's a lot about the series I disliked, but I get this feeling that there's something more than meets the eye. 

So far [this](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/01/06/monogatari-and-the-monster-inside/) article has done the best job of convincing that there is depth to the series (note that it talks a lot about stuff past Bakemonogatari).

EDIT: To expand a bit more, I disliked the Nadeko Snake arc the most, as it seemed to be not much more than (very questionable) fan service. 

[Nadeko Snake arc spoilers, I guess?](/s "Very little was done in characterizing or developing Nadeko-- you see that she's probably socially awkward or whatever, and that she idolizes Araragi, and such, but it's a pretty basic, and somewhat cliche characterization. At the end of the arc, you see in her interactions with Araragi that she can be confident and speak pretty naturally towards him, but that's about the extent of her development.")

I found [this](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/04/20/bakemonogatari-episodes-9-and-10-2/) article to be a pretty convincing interpretation of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
If you continue struggling to highlight any significance in Bake, just hope that it's simply the intro and SS could flesh them out. Not speaking in absolutes because that's just my opinion on it.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is a story of perspective. When the story focuses on koyomi, events seem much more lewd/fanservicey because that's the way he views the world. In addition, you rarely see crowds in the background because he zones out the people around him. For Nadeko, you see the outlines of people because she is self-conscious (don't call me cute!) Hanekawa had a much more serious perspective, but there are still some lewd undertones. (you'll understand if you know what happens in kizu/neko) There's a lot more than meets the eye in monogatari.

>> ARTICLE
So I'm in the middle of Bakemonogatari and it's pretty decent but to be honest I expected a lot more from it considering everybody freaking loves it. Don't get my wrong, I enjoy it but it's not a 10/10 for me. Should I keep going into nisemonogatari and the second season? I really want to get into it now that owarimonogatari is being animated.
>> ARTICLE
BTW dont get dissapointed about the fan service in nisemonogatari
>> ARTICLE
If you're in this to get sick-ass fight scenes or really big mind-fuck plot twists, you'll be disappointed. They're there, sure, but they're sparse and hardly ever the focus of the story, but that fact makes such scenes really treasured as a result.

As others have described the series before, more focus is put on the characters than the events; hence why so often things that could be explained in one minute will take far longer. That time is spent on characterization, and this is something that not every viewer/reader is guaranteed to enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same way as you throughout most of the series. It definitely wasn't a 10/10 for me by any means but it was enjoyable. Nisemonogatari was my favourite by far and most of Monogatari Second Season was not as interesting for me save for some parts. The whole series is definitely worth a watch though. You should watch the rest of it for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
Keep watching. The show takes a lot of different tones as the story progresses, honestly I think you'll probably appreciate Second Season more than Nisemonogatari and Nekomonogatari:Kuro.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I'll definitely watch some more. I have high hopes for the second season, I always hear so much praise about it!
>> ARTICLE
Honestly Second Season is what brought everything together that I was confused about in the rest of the series. I would HIGHLY suggest you stick it out and see what you think as well! I don't even take someone's opinion of Monogatari into consideration until they've finished Second Season, because it really made that big of a difference for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Now the real question. Book wise, is Kizu going to be the first one that will have an official English release?

I was all ready to buy the three installments of -monogatari I saw at Animethon last year provided the price came down, after resisting the urge to binge-watch all the fan-subs, and now there's more?   Arrgh...
>> ARTICLE
I'm not entirely sure, but this seems like a reasonable place to ask this. A few hours ago before this was posted I went looking for a timeline like this, and accidentally saw an Owarimonogatari spoiler. Can any LN readers just let me know if this is something major? [Owarimonogatari](/s "Years before Kizumonogatari, Araragi's parents protected Sodachi from something.") I'm guessing this isn't huge, but I would like it if someone could confirm.
>> ARTICLE
Somewhat. I'll just say it's not [Spoiler](/s "anything supernatural.")
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunate. Thanks for clarifying though. Do you think it will ruin that arc for me? I didn't read your spoiler, by the way. Although I think I can guess what it is, given that I think I misread one part.
>> ARTICLE
Not at all. It won't ruin anything, no worries. I's something different, but not something bad.
>> ARTICLE
Great, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
So, noob question. What is the aired order? The last one I remember watching is Kabukimonogatari  and I'm trying to catch up.
>> ARTICLE
This should be helpful to you!

Apparently it was teased on the last page of Zoku Owarimonogatari and it means "connecting story." That's literally all the info we've gotten about it.

You're telling me all of the crazy shit we've seen Araragi go through, and more crazy shit yet to come, happens over the course of a single year?

@~@ I can't somehow fathom how you guys keep all of these in mind. Guess, I'll be reading these when I grow old. Hopefully, it would be over before I get mid-30s.

Should I watch the series in the aired order or in chronological order?


>> ARTICLE
Aired order. Do not watch it in chronological order for your first time because I guarantee you, you *will* be confused!!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I appreciate it!
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain why the Monogatari series has such a sensational following? I havent checked it out myself...but everywhere I look someone is talking about Monogatari.
>> ARTICLE
Its a love or hate series, for myself I don't know what to think about it, I have watched Bake but Nise seems so boring I just feel to skip some parts, but I don't know maybe the series doesn't fit me.
>> ARTICLE
Nise is easily the most boring and worst part of the series. As a huge fan, I'd say I didn't fall in love with the series until the second arc of Second Season. 
>> ARTICLE
honestly, i dont really get why people think Nise is that boring, theres some great moments in there.

i thought that Neko:Kuro was worse than Nise.
>> ARTICLE
I mean I love the whole series, but mainly because of how loooooong and slow Karen Bee is and how Nise was originally not supposed to be published at all because it was originally just the author messing around, I'd say it's the worst. I agree that Neko Kuro was kind of boring and confusing too sometimes. The main point was just that after Bake, things get a lot less exciting so I feel sorry for new people trying to get into the series that need to push through Nise and Neko before they get to the really good stuff.
>> ARTICLE
You get more of monkey, and snail. I liked that. We also get introduced to kaiki and yotsugi which is also awesome. 

But in neko, you only have cat, which you don't really care about unless you know the story in Kizu
>> ARTICLE
I felt that way too the first time I watched it. Honestly, just power through it and get back to it later. I think it's good just to get the context of the series that way you can really enjoy it later (In SS) or the second watch around.
>> ARTICLE
Only answer I can come up with is that the character writing and dialogue is top notch. It doesn't have a concrete plot but because the characters pretty much carry the show, that doesn't matter too much. 

Monogatari just has such great characters and does its best to flesh them out very well with each of their individual arcs. It's not a show that's watched for the plot, I can say that for sure.

Untagged or improperly tagged spoilers are not allowed.

Repeated violations of this rule will result in a ban.

Self and link posts should have [Spoilers] in the title as well as the name(s) of the show(s). Self posts may opt to tag spoilers in the self post instead.

Comments should use `[spoiler source](/s "spoiler-chan died")` to protect spoilers. Spoiler source should, at a minimum, contain the relevant source of the spoiler (e.g. One Piece episode 200, or if it's from a different medium, LN/Manga/VN).

More like a series of still images depicting a little girl having her arms and legs chopped off before a powerful suction cup is inserted into her vagina which in turn forcibly sucks out her uterus, oviducts, etc. Finally leaving her on the table with one eye gouged out and her breasts removed. She dies shortly thereafter. 
All of this was done by her older brother who disliked that she got older, cause he enjoyed raping her a lot more when she was a proper child, which is depicted in other CG sets by the same artist. 

I'd give you a link, but I think that's against the rules.

It seems to have been deleted from /r/Anime or something but this seems somewhat important to understand Senjougahara's little outburst concerning Hanekawa in the abandoned school building.

http://cetranslation.blogspot.com/2012/03/nisemonogatari-snippet-of-chapter-005.html

If you don't want to read it all, basically she turned dere, or rather she turned more normal instead of her cold self.
>> ARTICLE
It's because of huge omissions like this i wish more anime based on LNs would get those translated too. Sometimes really important stuff doesn't get explained very well in the anime, and just gets a quick little blurb. 
>> ARTICLE
I...miss the longer hair though. :(
>> ARTICLE
I thought it would be a lot worse but honestly I think I can get behind the short hair.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for that.

Even though that change was sort of implied in Nisemonogatari, it's still nice to know for sure.
>> ARTICLE
>And since Kanbaru's growing her hair (to add in, Kanbaru's now wearing two low pigtails, which creates a gap moe against her rather boyish mannerisms)

Kanbaru. Pigtails. Moe. 

&#3232;\_&#3232; 

>> ARTICLE
Plus that image of dere-ban that we all have from Kokoro Connect...
>> ARTICLE
While the crying was a slight shock, I was more put off by the fact that they aren't as master/servant as Nise seemed to imply. Idk if that just came with time or it was simply a gag they were both in on, but it was gone completely.
>> ARTICLE
I think that long translated monologue explains that master/servant bit. it's probably the radical training Hanekawa put her through, which is GREAT to find out about, because honestly, it seemed EXTREMELY out of place in the anime. I could see Senjougahara being a little worried about Hanekawa trying to take Araragi from her, but not THAT worried, and definitely NOT without the threat of bloodshed.
>> ARTICLE
I expect it was because, during their "training" Hanekawa probably tried some more "forceful" techniques to change her personality, so we get that Domination/Submission vibe in Nise. Since that she has now undergone the change (not thanks to Hanekawa) there is no need for the training anymore, and Hitagi's instinctive/accidental slips of "Hanekawa-sama" or "Master" stopped being an issue. (I am not a LN reader, so this is all guesswork)
>> ARTICLE
Ah that'd actually make sense, like she was using it to try to force the dere through threats before and no longer needs it.
>> ARTICLE
Woa, that's a rather important monologue to skip even if this is just an anime adaptation. 

It basically explains what i said in an earlier comment. That their personalities had changed and how they interacted with each other had changed too compared to the rest of the series. 

This kind of feels like necessary reading for everyone watching this, which makes me feel a bit weird about the fact it wasn't included in some way in the anime version.

Ah well, thanks for the link anyway. Cleared a lot of stuff up. 
>> ARTICLE
It was definitely included, just a little more subtle in the anime adaptation. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not even that hard to piece it all together by reading in between the lines.  The series in particular is very adept at giving all the background hints to explain things without outright talking about the thing in question.
>> ARTICLE
During the episode right before the slap scene, there is a title card where Hanekawa says "Huh, did we just skip a chapter? Is it just me? Oh well."
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this makes me think the monologue will be placed later.
>> ARTICLE
Chapter skip is awesome. Just wait.
>> ARTICLE
That will make sense later but has nothing to do with the missing monologue.

When people cut their hair it symbolizes change a lot of time in Japanese culture. I am surprised by how many people missed this when I read comments on the internet so far about this episode.

Dying your hair or getting a new hairstyle after a significant event (like a breakup) isn't exactly exclusive to Japanese culture, though...

It's used a lot more often in Japanese culture than elsewhere.  It's not exclusive, I never said it was... but it definitely is prominent. [TvTropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut)

Although I missed Araragi this episode, I got Senjougahara, so forget him. Just kidding. I loved seeing Hanekawa and Senjou together though, hopefully Araragi isn't absent for the whole series, I'm hoping for a superhero rescue eventually.

Senjougahara has leveled up! She spent all her stat points on 'Troll' again. Standard.

I can't watch that stripping without thinking about Free! anymore. KyoAni's subversion show of the season is already doing funky things to my head.

It kinda feels like I've come home again after watching new Monogatari. 

It's quite strange though seeing how Hanekawa and Senjougahara interact with each other when Ararararagi isn't there. Some bits of their character feel slightly different. Can't wait to see the fire sisters and Nadeko again. And don't even get me started on Shinobu.

Probably best scene ever. 

As to the scene; yeah, Senjougahara's not a cold person. I think she even mentioned it herself during the first season, she's almost always in character [that acerbic, cold persona]. 

Hanekawa's a major foil with Senjougahara, they have so many similarities it's ridiculous. Senjougahara and Hanekawa both fancy a mask, albeit Hanekawa's is passive to the point of it being what everyone knows her as, while Senjougahara lets her's fall when it's required. Hanekawa's blatant character [may or may not be verisimilar] paints her to want to simply maintain her image; when Senjougahara said something along the lines of "You must not have gotten a lot of sleep last night, stay here", she lied with a "Yeah, I guess" [while her monologue noted that she had gotten some of the best sleep]. She's impulsive about certain things [which we'll have to assume, is just her maintaining character; meaning, Hanekawa's current character is in love with Koyomi, while Senjougahara's character and her true self is; also note that In Nekomonogatari, Araragi was in love with the facade of Hanekawa, not her true self at the end, who wanted to be saved]. 

Also look at their familial relations. Hanekawa's family situation was 'caused' by her [as stated by Meme during the former half in Kuro]. She and her family are distant. Senjougahara's situation was more at the fault of her parents than it was her. Yet, Senjougahara views her father with endearing terms, while Hanekawa doesn't really consider her adoptive family to be family. 

Interesting character relations. Beyond interesting actually.

>> ARTICLE
Well, to be fair, Senjougahara and Hanekawa's family situations are fairly different. For one thing, Senjougahara's father is actually her real dad via blood-relation (and he actually acknowledges her and I assume takes care of her), whereas Hanekawa's parents are both her step-parents with no blood relations to her. Another thing is that Hanekawa basically has no presence within her family's "house". She doesn't have her own room, basically has no possessions of her own save some clothes and school-related items. I mean, she sleeps in the hallway and gets woken up by a Roomba.

Even if she was considered a permanent "guest" of the household, you'd think they'd at least provide her with a room to stay in. It seems like they consider her to be of less importance than a guest, since I don't think any reasonable person would let their guest sleep in their house's hallway instead of a room.

Ah, Monogatari.

After two seasons, three additional episodes, and a film, I'm still kinda not sure how I feel about this series. I mean, it's got a lot going for it, to be sure. The direction is always distinctive and [occasionally pretty brilliant](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/18p3lt/nisemonogatari_and_the_nature_of_fanservice/ ). The writing is uniquely Isin-ish and [occasionally focused](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1hke5f/blood_ties_and_nekomonogatari/ ). It [arguably has a lot to say](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1cr7js/anime_club_watch_2_bakemonogatari_610_suruga/c9j9a8q ), even if it sometimes feels like Shinbou's weird brand of feminism is directly competing with Isin's strange form of sexism (or vice versa). It's basically the opposite of a show like Madoka, where everything works together towards a single focused goal  in Monogatari there is rarely narrative focus or anything resembling pacing, ideas bounce all over the place, and it will twist and turn in whatever directions it wishes, focusing one episode on a single joke extended way too far and another on the fundamental nature of family and human connection. It also indulges both these very driven creators in some of their worst instincts  Isin in his tendency towards losing character in favor of his own self-indulgent voice, and Shinbou in his tendency to make the direction itself the point (which, admittedly, sometimes works to actually counteract the Isin problems  I'd probably like Nise a whole lot less if Shinbou were playing it straight). It's strange. It's unique. It's sometimes problematic, sometimes pretty subversively progressive. It's Monogatari.

**Episode 1**

0:35  HANEKAWA'S THE NARRATOR THIS ARC? Wow. Fantastic. Couldn't have asked for a better choice

1:20 - This is a story of betrayal for you to all be disappointed in me. Hanekawa has often come across as a superhuman cypher, which, while extremely true to Araragi's perception of her, isn't really helpful as characterization. I'm very happy to see an arc from her perspective. (Incidentally, this is also why Senjougahara isn't normally that interesting to me  Araragi's skewed, idealized perspective of her makes for awesome unreliable narration, but much less coherent humanization)

3:32  I love how people unfamiliar with anime claim it all somehow looks similar. There is no goddamn way you could confuse a Monogatari series with any other series  its visual style is so freaking distinctive. That clean, shining, almost clinical look, the incredibly flat color contrasts, the overbearing brightness of day and overbearing gloom of night. It's (intentionally) staged like an elaborate but un-lived-in theatrical stage, a decision that perfectly accompanies the hyper-stylized dialogue and extended, monologue-focused scenes that drive the story forward. I have a number of complaints with this series, but goddamn do we ever need more productions this committed to their unique aesthetic

4:01  I finished breakfast, changed clothes, and left the house immediately. I like how instead of Araragi's elaborate over-explanations of everything physically occurring, Hanekawa's text frames are extremely matter-of-fact bullet points of her day

7:00 - *Goddamn Shinbou you are so good.* I can't really stop and point out every great thing he does, but this tiger scene definitely draws attention to itself that way. The quick jump cuts between her nervous ticks and panicked thoughts underlined by her breathing really trap the viewer in the claustrophobia of the moment

9:00  Senjougahara advices Hanekawa to overcome her hesitance and call Araragi, but her eyes jump constantly from Hanekawa's lips, to legs, to skirt, etc. She is terrified of their relationship, but her words would never betray that

9:10  Hah! Then Hanekawa tries to make eye contact, and sees it all. I thought Neko Kuro was kind of a step down for this series, but this episode is putting its best foot forward

10:27 - I can die together with you, at least. A private joke? How much did Araragi actually tell her about Golden Week?

11:24 - I'm probably completely unable to ask for help from another person. Oh really, Hanekawa? I wouldn't have guessed

12:10 - It was like I was trying to strike out all the contradictions. This was very like me. Reordering perspective to make her life liveable seems like a pretty persistent theme of Hanekawa's stories. Fits nicely with the opening shot of a vacuum automatically cleaning up the stray loose ends of her home life, until it bumps right into her and forces her awake

12:39 - Did I just skip a chapter? Oh well. Speaking of erasing unwanted loose ends... yeah, *that's* probably not gonna come up again

14:36 - You don't have to call people like that Mother and Father, do you? Senjougahara is pretty goddamn over paying lip service to traditional family definitions. Hanekawa could learn something from her

15:45  I like how they contrast I now see that what I did was crazy, I wasn't thinking it through against a pan across all the clothes and materials she had prepared precisely because she'd thought it through, and given the fact that asking anyone for help was utterly impossible, this course of action seemed perfectly reasonable

16:26  Staying at Senjougahara's house. Oh god, I've heard about this. Hopefully Shinbou's steady hand will steer Isin's overtly fetishistic nonsense into something purposeful

17:00 - Almost feels like my home. In that it's barely one at all?

17:49  Aaaand clothes off. You could say this scene is Senjougahara asserting that she's not intimidated by Hanekawa's sexuality, but I dunno if I'd buy it

19:20 - Let's take a shower together. See, it's so far beyond normal it feels like it *has* to mean something, but Isin is such a goddamn perv it could just be his boner talking. But he's *also* such a gifted writer that it could *also* be Senjougahara trying to counteract both the vulnerability she felt in her first scene here and the necessary admission of their relationship (or at least Hanekawa's importance to Araragi) that this whole letting-her-stay thing implies, by way of making a big aggressive front of not being intimidated by Hanekawa physically. Which would certainly fit in with Senjougahara's big, defensive, often ill-thought-through gestures in the past. Which makes me think the camera here is Senjougahara's intent being shown, as she metaphorically growls and gnashes her teeth at the threat Hanekawa represents

19:30 - No, wait a minute! I sense a threatening atmosphere. Oh good. I was right. I really prefer shows impressing me to shows disappointing me

20:30 - I didn't expect you to say yes. It won't look good if I distance myself from the girl who slapped me while she was crying. A BATTLE FOR THE AGES. It's funny that this is essentially no different from characters fighting over a man in a normal harem, but, you know, not written by idiots

21:47 - But that means we have to handle the tiger here by ourselves. PLEASE YES. SENJOUGAHARA AND HANEKAWA, SPIRIT-FIGHTING DETECTIVES

One sign of a good show: it's just as compelling when the main character isn't even there

**And Done**

Bam! Strong showing right out the gates by Monogatari. This episode was certainly very, well, very Monogatari, and featured a clear return to the focused direction I was so enamored of in Nise. Making Hanekawa the protagonist was also an awesome choice  Araragi's dominant position in this world can be almost overbearing, and it's nice to see how the character dynamics work in his absence. The pair of Senjou and Hanekawa in particular is fantastic  the way their rivalry expresses itself, through Senjougahara's brittle and barely-hidden insecurity and Hanekawa's offhand, absolute confidence, makes for funny and utterly true-to-character drama and conversation. The minutes kind of flew by with this one  it seemed to combine the sharper narrative focus of Neko with the ostentatiously intelligent direction of Nise. If it keeps up like this, it could easily be my favorite Monogatari yet.

Oh man oh man oh man oh man. 

So I'm not going to say too much this arc; I've read Neko:Shiro and I'm finding it a bit difficult to separate the stuff the show is doing from the stuff the LN did. (Your reaction on learning that Hanekawa's narrating: excellent :P)

But I will say this: I found it fascinating that Hanekawa's view of the world is implied to be oh-so-similar to the clinical, lonely, isolated one we're used to from Araragi. We never even see her parents onscreen; we don't even see those little cardboard cutouts Monogatari tends to use to represent NPCs. Even in situations where the show/Hanekawa has to acknowledge their existence, it's in the past tense, glossed over, levels removed.

This is ... a bit more exaggerated than what the LNs did; in the breakfast scene in particular the LN made clear that the other two _were there_, just with the whole oppressive lack-of-acknowledgement thing.
>> ARTICLE
Amazing write as always. Quick question for your blog though, do you have any write ups for any kind adventure shounen?
>> ARTICLE
This was definitely a fantastic first episode for this season, with one of my favorite Monogatari characters headlining it. Hanekawa is just too perfect, because she so damaged and I can't wait to see her heart open up little by little to those around her, and maybe even see her break down, revealing all the things she keeps locked away. 

The chapter skip was really interesting, and I think it is representative of how she restructures her life and hides things away that seem...what's the word...ugly? She buries everything that doesn't fit a standard model (her family/home life), things that might seem unclean (her own emotions), and adorns a smile to make everything seem fine. The missing chapter is either her subconscious purposely forgetting herself maybe breaking down, crying over her home (or even laughing and smiling at its destruction) or (more likely) her just simply omitting the event from the story she is telling us, the audience. 

And Senjougahara is just brilliant in this episode. Half of the time she seems like a genuinely nice person who cares for Hanekawa, and the other half she appears to be a predator, sizing up the prey lined up before her. Love it.

>I finished breakfast, changed clothes, and left the house immediately. I like how instead of Araragi's elaborate over-explanations of everything physically occurring, Hanekawa's text frames are extremely matter-of-fact bullet points of her day

I'm so glad people noticed this, I was sad they couldn't get Hanekawa's joke about it taking Araragi 60+ pages to leave his house in. Though I think it is nice that they aren't focusing on that, in the LN whenever she is talking to someone she'll have a comment or two about how she thinks Araragi would converse with that person.

>I can die together with you, at least.

I always took this to mean that Senjougahara had either taken on some of Araragi's traits or that she felt so indebted to Hanekawa, in the same way Araragi was, that she is willing to die with/for her.

>> ARTICLE
That "Araragi would talk this way" thing seems like a perfect example of the many good choices this adaptation makes. [Delete, Delete...](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mablsz2mpI1rrpus1o1_500.gif)

>One sign of a good show: it's just as compelling when the main character isn't even there

Now that I realize it, this is so true. I always wondered why I never found Shakugan no Shana Final as compelling or interesting as the other two seasons. I basically had to almost force myself to watch the first half of season 3 because [spoilers](/s "Yuuji wasn't there. It felt like everything fell apart and there was no direction without him.")

Really? I actually found S3 to be my absolute favorite of them, because it was fun to try and puzzle out exactly WTF he was planning along with Shana. I knew he wasn't turning evil or anything, but i just couldn't wrap my head around how he was doing something good at first either.

I found the later episodes of S3 fine, and the series had a satisfying finale, but I didn't enjoy the earlier half at all.

A bit of hindsight on the vacuum scene: She was already awake and just waiting for the vacuum to touch her head. She is jealous of Araragi because he has his sisters waking him up every day and she would like that too.

Generally folks don't like how she's this fake image of perfection. Araragi thinks so highly of her even though he's seen how imperfect she is.

Hanekawa has never been my favourite character, so I was unsure whether I would like this first arc from her point of view. However, I loved this episode, however I am a little bit overwhelmed (and underwhelmed by Daisuki) so I will definitely have to rewatch it. Also, is there any significance to the "skipped chapter" that Hanekawa herself mentioned? Is it just something that isn't important, or is it going to be referred back to later on?
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry the skipped chapters will be explained later. Also as someone who never especially liked Hanekawa (and read the LN) I thought this arc was one of the best I had read, second only to Kizumonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
Started letterboxed while a character monologued about their own nature, with the occasional close-up on their eye?

OP had more unique frames than the rest of the season combined likely will?

Confirming that Shaft made this show.

Really, though, I think that this episode did a fantastic job of showcasing the distinct style Shaft has developed. In Bakemono and to some extent Nisemono, it seemed very slapdash and poorly executed. Since then, we have seen steady improvement on Shaft's part. This episode's style felt cohesive and well-directed and I'm very excited to see the rest of the show.

>> ARTICLE
I was initially put off by the fact that this first episode was so different in tone from the earlier series, but then I realized that there's a reason for that: The narrating is now done by Hanekawa, not Araragi, so the perspective is entirely different.

I think the weirdest thing for me was how Senjougahara seemed to have become an entirely different person. However, she's still as great as ever, the last few scenes really reminded me of the scene with Senjougahara and Araragi at her place in Episode 2 of Bakemonogatari(and that's probably very intentional).

Now, this may seem like I'm sort of on the edge about this episode, but the truth is that I'm so excited that I can't properly put it into words. No matter where the story goes, no matter how different the narrating is, I will still love this show very much.

The OP and ED didn't strike me as great in any way, but they'll probably grow on me with time, as they always seem to do. The background music is great as usual, though.
>> ARTICLE
Remember that Senjougahara has been changing along the series. When she met Kaiki in Nise it was a big deal for her.

Yep, that's certainly true, and it apparently is even more clear in the LNs. I read the snippet from Nisemonogatari that was posted in this thread, and it explains very much.

I would say you shouldn't. This is a a direct sequel of Nisemonogatari and Bake while Neko is a prequel and Kizu hasn't been released yet.

don't spoil it, its not important enough to have it spoiled, just wait for the movie.

Not really. Kizu explains the relationship between Araragi and Shinobu, which is brought to attention from Nise on, plus a character from Kizu will be making an appearance in the currently airing anime soon.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it is important for some things but its such a good story I would rather people see it or read it as it was meant to be experienced. Spoilers just kill all that in the dullest way possible. 

Also I really hope they leave out the conversation you are talking about or take the Kizu spoilers out of it.
>> ARTICLE
I doubt they will; Guillotine Cutter was already mentioned in Nise. Shaft seems to be moving forward with the series without a care in the world.
>> ARTICLE
They showed a ton in the first moments of Bake. Though little references to a past character isn't as bad as this conversation which would be throwing out major plot points. Maybe they will just blatantly throw all that in, but if they are smart that conversation can ignore the Kizu plot and still have the same feel.
>> ARTICLE
For Bake, that's kind of a teaser for Kizu. And it's not just the mention of Guillotine Cutter. More importantly, there's the whole Araragi/Shinobu relationship. You won't really understand what they're talking about in Nise without knowing Kizu.
>> ARTICLE
I think people are smart enough get the gist of their relationship without Kizu, and when it does air it will just make that much more sense. We are talking about whether or not you should spoil the series to get that bit of extra clarity, so to me, not worth it. As for Bake I think that "teaser" gives away too much. Btw, where is that Guillotine Cutter reference in Nise, what episode?

Where is this episode available? It's not on Crunchyroll for me.
>> ARTICLE
You can watch it on Daisuki. Crunchyroll isn't showing it for a month.
>> ARTICLE
No Arararagi for a lil while :/

This probably won't get seen in the sea of comments, but should I watch the Daisuki stream or wait for better subs from HDTV?
>> ARTICLE
why not both?

mmmmmmmm

Is it just me, or does Daisuki take forever to load for you guys, too? I don't know why, but it just never loads anything... so I haven't seen the episode yet.

It would not load for me at all on Chrome, I had to open Firefox for it.

YES, it worked! Thanks, it's definitely loading much faster on Firefox for some reason.

Nice episode.

Question for you guys.  I never caught Neko, do I have to to understand this season?

Neko is a prequel to Bake, and it does contain hints and a little bit of back story for season 2. I would recommend watching it if you can!

yep, it was fine. I dont see much point in getting too fussy over which release you're getting. The "final" version will be the BD's after all.

Damn region locks, screw the rest of the world. They're not human anyway, right?!

I always find it amusing how the EU single market isn't a single market at all. I mean, UK and Ireland get access to it. IANAL but shouldn't that mean that other EU countries must be able to watch this stuff too? Youtube does the same thing, so I guess they're exploiting some weird loophole.

I hope they know that I'd gladly watch these shows *legally* if they actually considered me to be a human and let me *give them money*.

Do we know whether any good group (so, no sub rips like HorribleSubs, or possible-troll-subs group Commie) will be subbing this for those of us that are considered undeserving, due to our parents having chosen to give birth to us outside the only few countries that matter?

She has grown as a person over the past seasons. She cut her hair symbolically to show her change.  Bake with Araragi, Nise with dealing with Kaiki.

Great OST. as usual gonna get that.

Also yeah finally monogatari is back.

Too bad the episode centered around the 2 characters I like the least
>> ARTICLE
I'm disappointed that SHAFT haven't improved the animation quality. Neko Black was a step in the right direction, but this seemed lower than Nisemonogatari (i.e. back to Bakemonogatari levels of powerpoint). 

Not that it really matters much, because the dialogue is so entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
Remember now, SHAFT likes to save their animation budget for the BD releases of pretty much every series they do.
>> ARTICLE
I mean not much was going on this episode really that needed super animation. It's the longest series they have done for Monogatari so far so I think it's understandable to see some animation drop at times. On that note I don't mind it being Bake quality, Bake remains my favorite season so far. The others are great don't get me wrong, just Bake got me hooked. 
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explains Senjogaurha's character change? Seems kind of abrupt and random.
>> ARTICLE
/u/ChaoticPenor has [linked](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1hra5j/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cax44h2) the chapter in the LN that explains the character change.

TL;DR: After meeting Kaiki in Nise it gave Senjougahara the closure she needed to move on. She was "tsun" before as a means to sort of protect herself from what happened with her family.
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful. Worth the wait. Words not necessary... My only criticism would be that there were a lot of stills (though it still had its characteristic stand out moments) but my amateurish guess would be that SHAFT is saving budget for Kabukimonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's also just Shaft. They always improve stuff for the BD release.
>> ARTICLE
What the hell did they do to Senjougahara? They're ruining the best character in the series.
>> ARTICLE
It's been explained multiple times in the thread. 

Would you rather there be no character development? People change over time and grow hopefully. 

Though I understand your plight and will say she acts her "old way" at times. 
>> ARTICLE
The thing about character development is that you have to *see* it happen. Using a timeskip to "develop" your characters is just lazy writing.
>> ARTICLE
Looking at the title, it would lead people thinks of Hachikuji first. However, Mayoi Jiangshi also translates to The Lost Undead (Vampire, Shinobu in this case). 

Shinobu became a lost cause as her only friend is dead. She blamed herself for causing Araragi 's death. Shinobu then attempted to end her life as there is no meaning for her to live in a world without Araragi.

However, she can't die due to immortality. Thus she goes on a rampage.

Story begins with Araragi thinking "What-if Hachikuji were alive?" and ends with the other Shinobu thinking "What-if Araragi were alive?"

Edit: there is no what-if, you don't have to get over it but you have to live with it. 
>> ARTICLE
That's the first and most important thing I missed in this arc. The damn title D;
>> ARTICLE
Damn I totally forgot that "Mayoi" can translate to "Lost", you bring up an interesting point, all these puns Nisio Isin, even your pen-name is the same backwards as it is forwards!
>> ARTICLE
>[something big to consider is the amount of physical interaction the two characters share with each other](http://i.imgur.com/xcnSSMR.gif)

sorry, just had to do this.

anyway, some ideas that propped in my head reading your comment was that Hachikuji never *really* had much of a story arc. as far as i recall, mayoi snail arc was when Shuraragi and Hitagi met in the park and flirted intensely followed by confusing dialogue between the two as she wasn't able to see her while he was. i remember lots of banter and dialogue between Churaragi and Senjougahara as well as loli [molestation.](http://i.imgur.com/oEGNHGM.jpg)

another thing that i have to mention is referring to this part:

>We see where Shinobu would have been without Araragi, and that **she simply didnt want to be alone.**

now.. **i have not read the LN** but it is my understanding thus far that Monogatari is a series where the girls each have an oddity relating to their person which is something Rararagi or Shinobu didn't have... or does he? to the extent of my knowledge, he's the one that saw her vampire form and somehow ended up paired with her in a vague thing they call 'master slave' relationship. [what if Shinobu is *his* apparition?](http://i.imgur.com/yJDWDCk.gif)

i'm asking this because Shinobu being alone.. well, having lived supposedly [598 years](http://i.imgur.com/dzxxhnp.jpg) she'd have plenty of chances to be alone or having her loved ones (if she truly was a vampire that lived for so long) die off or get hurt. she could very well be that old yet appear as his apparition and it's *his* loneliness or charisma that infected her as to cause the eventual annihilation of mankind due to their falling apart (as hanekawa has infected/altered her oddity). Oshino Meme did mention in bakemonogatari that her outside appearance is directly influenced by how he thinks of her, her childlike [form being a result of her weakness](http://i.imgur.com/n1smnGr.gif) and his [treatment of her as a child](http://ghostlightning.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/bakemonogatari-08-shinobu-araragi-post-vampire-bite.jpg), because he's fond of her [in that form.](http://i.imgur.com/L5uYLnn.gif)

of course it [could be total bullshit](http://i.imgur.com/NBcvUU6.gif) as i'm simply inferring/speculating current anime info dump and posting [shinobu gifs](http://i.imgur.com/Mogq9LX.gif)
>> ARTICLE
>  what if Shinobu is his apparition?

That is a really interesting idea that I've never thought of. I haven't read any the LN's either besides Neko:Kuro, but through out the series, like you said, it's always been heavily implied that Araragi, and Shinobu are more closely linked than any of the other characters. The apparition theory would be a good explanation for that. 

Though, my only caveat is (and who knows I could be completely off base) that with most of the other apparitions throughout the series it was a pretty one sided thing. The victim suffered somehow, and the apparition gained. But with Shinobu and Araragi their relationship seems pretty balanced, they are both gaining from the time they're together. But idk, this series absolutely loves to throw curveballs everywhere so I could see you're theory coming out to be completely correct. 

I think a lot of revelation will come out in Kizu if Shaft ever decides we've been good enough to see it. PS. Shinobu gifs, not a problem. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh no no no no, they're balanced because they both lost something. And will be revealed in kizu as you said. :D
>> ARTICLE
> But with Shinobu and Araragi their relationship seems pretty balanced

This is largely the reason why Araragi hasnt been killed/taken care of by any of the balancers (Oshino, Kaiki, Yozuru, Gaen). 
>> ARTICLE
Another thing about Hachikuji, she herself is a manifestation of the "Lost Cow" oddity, she isn't the one possessed by it, she *is* it. As such, only those people who are reluctant to return home or are procrastinating will see her... This is why Hanekawa and Araragi can see her, but Hitagi can't.

Also notice how all the Hachikuji scenes, especially in Nise almost always occur when Araragi is on his way to do something, but gets sidetracked with Hachikuji appearing. I think it's the reason why this 'Hachikuji arc' focuses on Araragi so much, but then again, the arc called 'Shinobu time' apparently includes Hachikuji also.

Another interesting point was one which /u/convictfish brought up in his thoughts on Bakemonogatari: Hachikuji is functionally an exposition tool after her first arc, most of the time she serves to be a being to bounce off conversation with Araragi in order to reason out a situation, or in other cases, sidetrack him completely.

**Edit:** [I explained it way better on that post in the other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1mhzda/journey_through_the_monogatari_series/cc9j47x)
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "While Kabuki focuses on an event caused (well not caused but you get what I mean right? Ending the world and all) by Shinobu, Onimonogatari focuses on an event caused by Hachikuji.")
>> ARTICLE
Skim read to try to avoid spoilers, sorry if I miss context.

Yeah, it is important to note that (as far as I have experienced) Araragi never truly has an internal 'duologue.' He has monologues, yes, but they are essentially him *telling* us something he already knows, us being the audience. He never reasons something with himself within his head, it always occurs as a conversation with Hachikuji, who *certainly* knows things she really shouldn't know about Araragi.

Also, I'm TRYING to get through Nisemono (and my thoughts will come when I do), but like a siren Hyouka and Psycho Pass have been calling to me.
>> ARTICLE
I know that feel, trying to start Lain, but FMA:B and Railgun S keep calling to me!
>> ARTICLE
A bit unrelated to your post, but something I noticed about the title is that there's a pun in it. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but given the author there's a pretty high likelyhood of it.

In Chinese, Jiangshi can mean "zombie" () or "will be" (), both which are pretty relevant to the arc.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure that was entirely intentional. There are many puns in the books so it's not hard to believe it wouldn't be intentional.
>> ARTICLE
Japanese writers sure do love their trilingual-and-upwards linguistics (twisting Japanese, Chinese and English words all together). I suppose their language is predisposed to the blurring of Chinese and Japanese meanings, and they're culturally predisposed to the use and incorporation of English (as a postwar occupied nation, with significant English language presence persisting to the present day).
>> ARTICLE
>with a helmet on because she didnt want Araragi to pet her head.

Was this ever mentioned in the anime or just the LN because I don't remember it being mentioned in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
This was said in the LN, first at Kizumonogatari, then at Nekomonogatari: Kuro. I can't remember if this was said at Bakemonogatari: Tsubasa Cat and Nisemonogatari: Karen Bee though.
>> ARTICLE
It's mentioned in the anime I think. Or implied by Shinobu when she said to Araragi that patting her head is a sign if obedience.
>> ARTICLE
Now, call me crazy, but I am pretty sure Oshino or Araragi pretty much said exactly that sometime in Bake, if it wasn't that, it was Shinobu saying it herself in Nise.
>> ARTICLE
Shinobu herself said that exactly in Nisemonogatari when Karen was beating Araragi to a shit. 
>> ARTICLE
It's also mentioned by Araragi in the end of Neko:Kuro when Shinobu first get's the helmet, he says something to the effect "Ah now I can't pet her head, what a shame."
>> ARTICLE
I had an impression that when the character's name is on the title, he/she will be the center of it.

I never really looked at it that way, thanks for clarifying. :D
>> ARTICLE
Glad to help! I enjoyed doing it. 
>> ARTICLE
This was my favorite arc of the show. :)
>> ARTICLE
Well at least this means there will be more than 26 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Probably! Which if you ask me, is very good news. I was very worried about how much would need to get rushed or cut in order to squeeze all the content into 2 cours, but this should make things a lot easier from that perspective. 

Also, more monogatari content is always welcome.  
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they say a while back that the rest of the monogatari series was cleared to be animated at one point or another?
>> ARTICLE
It obviously is because the series prints money.
>> ARTICLE
And because the director(?) likes the series.
>> ARTICLE
but but Kanbaru is my favorite character 
>> ARTICLE
Don't you always save the best stuff for last? :p
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, if you were Kanbaru fan you should be pleased that she is getting special treatment, and also more time for the other plot to better flush them out.
>> ARTICLE
Flesh*
>> ARTICLE
Oddly fitting word to have to correct.
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty logical decision since Hanamonogatari is set considerably later chronologically speaking. Almost a year after the other stories if I'm not very much mistaken.
>> ARTICLE
This is sad news, but I can live with it. From what I understand, Hana being removed won't impact the narrative much. Wonder how they'll cover it, and if this means that their 26 episodes is now spread across five volumes instead of six, or if this means there are fewer episodes now.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I wonder. I have a feeling they will cut the episodes, which would be a shame. 
>> ARTICLE
No, it's going to be 26 episodes still.
If they were going to cut some episodes out, it would have been told a *long* time ago.
>> ARTICLE
They just made the announcement that they were cutting a LN which could affect the episode count. They couldn't make that decision a *long* time ago when they just chose to cut it.  
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, sort of said it wrong. I guess when I said a long time ago, it meant that they would have announced that they would be airing less than 26 episodes when they announced it.
>> ARTICLE
Well I am all for it not changing but I still am nervous till we see for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
I suppose this is good news since it means that the other books will get more episodes than previously expected. I also guess that this could mean that Hanamonogatari might get the same treatment as Nekomonogatari (Kuro) and be released as a series of specials. Since it might be a while before the last light novels are animated, it might be nice to have some more stuff to look forward to (...on top of Kizumonogatari).
>> ARTICLE
Kizumonogatari has appropriately become a bleeding wound in my heart... 2012 they said! When! SHAFT! WHEN!
>> ARTICLE
 right?  when!
>> ARTICLE
This is better for all the other novels. I hope this means they incorporate it with the final four books as a second 26 episode season.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that they have more time per book is good news. Though I would still have flipped a switch if it was kabukimonogatari, still kinda sad that we'll have to wait for this one since what I've read of it is interresting.
>> ARTICLE
As long as there's still 26 episodes in the new season, I'm fine with this.  Less rushed narrative.
>> ARTICLE
So that means after this season there will be three novels unadapted?
>> ARTICLE
Kizumonogatari

Hanamonogatari

Tsukimonogatari

Koyomimonogatari

Owarimonogatari

Zokuowarimonogatari

Kizu should be a movie, and Hana will probably be an ONA at this rate. That leaves four novels for the final adaptation.

>> ARTICLE
If one of those turns out to be the final *monogatari, maybe it'll be a separate movie and merge Hana into the second 26-episode season.
>> ARTICLE
Zokuowariomonogatari is planned to be the final novel. 
>> ARTICLE
Excellent. I really like how they are approaching it. 
>> ARTICLE
You should crosspost this to /r/araragi.
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone tell the order to watch this? This series and the names confuse the hell out of me. 
>> ARTICLE
When in doubt, the order it came out in.   
   
Bakemonogatari -> Nisemonogatari -> Nekomonogatari: Kuro -> the new series coming out. It isn't chronological order, but it is the order that it was intended.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks :)


That's a big help. 
>> ARTICLE
If you do want chronological, Nekomonogatari: Kuro->Bakemonogatari->Nisemonogatari, but it's not super necessary, just always watch Bakemonogatari before Nisemonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
thanks
>> ARTICLE
If you really want to watch out on chronological order, you have to wait until Kizumonogatari comes out before you start the series. 
>> ARTICLE
i was pretty damn depressed when hitagi cut her hair, especially after hanekawa did. then tsukihi cut her's and i was just like... wtf man, everyone with short hair now? but then, here comes my favorite yuri, saving the day with her newly grown awesomness

Koyomi declares that he likes shorter hair rather than longer hair. Hence why Hitagi and hanekawa cut theirs. Since Karen and Tsukihi have a brother complex, wouldn't be surprised if it was for [koyomin too](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5munfBTsi1ryqc1xo1_500.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I was re-watching Nisemonogatari last night and Hitagi mentions cutting her hair short like Hanekawa-sama

[Nisemonogatari Spoilers](/s"It's in the context of her continually dropping hints that she's enamoured/blackmailed by Hanekawa in someway as is the overall signposting in the series as she obeys Hanekawa's request to free Araragi. So I think her idolising/fearing Hanekawa is important as well. Just my opinion though")

Someone who has enough time and knowledge:

So after Kizumonogatari comes out, all we have left is Koyomimonogatari and two other monogatari?
>> ARTICLE
I'm betting we'll get Season 3 before we get Kizu....

Anyways the books left to adapt are:

Tsukimonogatari (1 story, Yotsugi Doll)

Koyomimonogatari (12 short stories, all named after Koyomi followed by an element of nature)

Owarimonogatari

* Volume 1 (3 stories, Ougi Formula, Sodachi Riddle, Sodachi Lost) 

* Volume 2 (1 story, Shinobu Mail) 

* Volume 3 (1 story, Ougi Dark)

Zokuowarimonogatari (TBA)
>> ARTICLE
Kizu is the half-life 3 of anime
>> ARTICLE
No, that would be Spice and Wolf.  Particularly given that we have parts 1 and 2.

>> ARTICLE
No we still have Tsukimonogatari before Koyomimonogatari then three volumes of Owarimonogatari and latest is apparently Zokuowarimonogatari. I have no idea if that's the end these are just the ones I know.
>> ARTICLE
Third volume of Owarimonogatari comes out next week. So I guess Zokuowarimonogatari is a long ways away.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, thanks!   

The two "other monogatari" I was thinking about were apparently Owari and Zokuowari (couldn't remember them). Seems I forgot about Tsuki.
>> ARTICLE
This long-haired Kanbaru is going to take some getting used to.
>> ARTICLE
So I recognize that this anime has many different series in it yes?  I think I have asked this before, what is the order in which to watch the series?
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari (15 episodes, 3 of which are ONAs) followed by Nisemonogatari (11 episodes) then Nekomonogatari Kuro (4 episodes) and Monogatari Series Second Season (26 episodes, 3 of which are recaps), lastly Hanamonogatari (5 episodes, TBR)

I honestly think Kaiki intended for Sengoku to catch on with his deception. For Araragi and Shinobu to die in a traffic accident? Kinda hard to believe that a vampire died from a car crash. I don't know how many steps ahead he is since he's an unreliable narrator, but I think he has this planned out. 
>> ARTICLE
That's my thought as well. 
>> ARTICLE
That does seem to be the most likely case.

While it is clear from the start that Kaiki is a keen and intelligent man, I believe is actually even more cunning and receptive then he leads others to believe. 

Like he said:


http://i.imgur.com/AkqNPUg.png



He appears to also have a good idea of Gaen nature and role in all of this as well as the "forces" opposing her:



http://i.imgur.com/AVj3LdW.jpg http://i.imgur.com/je8sSvk.png




and quite obviously knows of Nadekos true nature and personality


http://i.imgur.com/uzdmbts.png


I think everything that has happened with Nadeko is according to plan and that he will likely succeed in deceiving her and possibly *(this part is heavy on speculation)* turn her against Gaen.


>> ARTICLE
I think so too. Especially with his research and after the discussion Kaiki had with Hanekawa. When she answered him about her thoughts of Nadeko, he almost thought he overrated Hanekawa for a moment when she gave him a wrong description.

He knows that Nadeko is someone who likes to decieve others herself and planned exactly for that to happen. And what he found in her closet is actually extremly important (he told us a lie the last 2 episodes) for what he is planning. Of course, I'm just guessing.

Either this or I'm overrating Kaiki.
>> ARTICLE
his whole spiel before about words being dramatized really adds to the feel that what he has narrated so far doesn't really explain the whole situations
>> ARTICLE
"You're going to deceive ME?" 
 
 Well, shit, that didn't take long for her to figure out. Unless, of course, it was his plan for her to figure it out. 
 
 Also, DAT CLOSET TEASE.
>> ARTICLE
I got chills. I didn't think she would realize what was happening. Next week can't come soon enough! 
>> ARTICLE
The whole point of this arc has been that Nadeko has lied to everyone and hidden how she truly feels. Of course that would include Kaiki. 

I'm actually more surprised that the expert liar was successfully lied to. 
>> ARTICLE
Which is the basis for the suggestion that his deception is deeper than we see in that brief scene. Or, that he has something in mind/has it under control - sort of thing.
>> ARTICLE
Never underestimate Kaiki. I'm guessing this is all according to keikaku and she was supposed to figure out she was being lied to.
>> ARTICLE
All according to Kaikiku
>> ARTICLE
TL Note: keikaku means plan
>> ARTICLE
Just wanted to point out, I heard a 'Kaiki-san mo'  <- with that 'mo' she's saying "Kaiki-san is also <trying to> deceive me."  So it makes me wonder who else she considers to have deceived her.  I thought Gaen did something here to her first.  Unless she just thinks that everyone is out to get her or something.

Things we learned this episode:

Ougi isn't related to Meme. Though I'm sure that's not much of a surprise really.

This whole event somehow ties back into when Episode and Gaen were in town, but wait...we have no idea what happened then! Yay for holes in the story!

Kaiki proves he's best character in the whole show and he might actually have a heart. 

Gahara holds grudges for life.

Nadeko might be wittier than we thought and is an alcoholic now.

What's in the closet is probably not that important, according to Kaiki.

EDIT: [This is neat.](https://24.media.tumblr.com/dfa7cdc9e643789d551fe7d8778021c4/tumblr_my68a41AH41r3rdh2o1_500.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Nadeko is a god, so she could be using supernatural power.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that maybe Oshino Ougi really is following the orders of Oshino Meme.  My theory is that Gaen is the dangerous one and her plan wasn't to make Shinobu a kami, so much as to separate her from Arararagi instead.  This is why Arararagi was reluctant to go with the plan as said in this episode..  Ougi instead made it so that that was no longer possible.  Maybe?

I thought she is like Yotsugi who was the shikigami of Kagenui.  Could she be the shikigami of Oshino Meme?
>> ARTICLE
Yotsugi is supposed to be a shikigami? I figured she was a Jiangshi.
>> ARTICLE
> I thought that maybe Oshino Ougi really is following the orders of Oshino Meme.

There's no progress on that front in the books yet, but there's one thing which gives food for thought. Not a major spoiler either. Once while talking with Araragi, Ougi said [Spoiler](/s "'So you want to wait for help? That won't do. People can't help each other, they can only... Wait, that's *his* line, and I'm not him. So okay, let's wait for help.'")

So it might be that [Spoiler](/s "Oushino Ougi IS Oshino Meme"). Hanekawa leaving and secretly getting back might be even taken as a foreshadowing of this.
>> ARTICLE
There is something truly unpleasant about Gaen... The way she carries herself, how she speaks and treats others with a thinly veiled disdain. 


I'd even go so far to say that Ougi feels more like a human then Gaen does. 


Also while it was revealed that Ougi is not related by blood to Meme she still no doubt has some kind of bond or connection to him... It definitely isn't a far stretch to say Gaen is the true enemy here.

its funny because at the moment my least favorite is kanbaru, but i know once i find out what they plan to show us about her personally. i will love her.
>> ARTICLE
Ready the torches and pitchforks, but I never liked Mayoi all that much outside of the running gags, and I didn't like Nadeko until she lost her marbles. Also I feel like Shinobu's backstory is way better than her current character.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like Mayoi because of her gags, but I was still very sad to see her go. I had no opinion on Nadeko because I felt like her character was pretty much a blank slate. Shinobu was most enjoyable to watch in Nisemonogatari for me.

Just that they've all still done things that totally bumped them up and down the list this whole season.
>> ARTICLE
I never liked Nadeko and still don't like her.

But that's probably the only character in there that I had a strong antipathy to.
>> ARTICLE
New Nadeko is best-tier, but she was useless before this season; her arc is the sole blemish in Bakemonogatari imo. Shinobu is cool, but she wouldn't be as popular as she is if she didn't have a ridiculously good character design.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, how can you guys not like Mayoi? She was such a freaking bro and her interactions with Koyomi were one of the best. But well, I like every character^exceptNadeko.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, Hachikuji is more bro that most designated bro characters in anime. There is a reason why Arargi says he's only truly happy when he's talking to Hachikuji.
>> ARTICLE
I always liked Hachikuji when she was in bro-mode, not so much when they were in the "Araragi is a creeper" mode.  Whiiich was a lot of the time, especially in Nise.  Bro-mode Kanbaru was always far superior to "I'm such a pervert!" Kanbaru, too.

Hachikuji was cool in the way that despite being the "youngest" member of the cast she was actually kind of a wise old soul.  Araragi could have honest conversations with her in a way he didn't with anyone else.
>> ARTICLE
I consider her to be the "bro" character because she listens to all of Araragi's troubles and tells him what she thinks. The whole "creeper" thing is a gag she is in on.

To me Kanbaru was never a "bro" character she's only hanging out with Araragi because it'll get her a chance at seeing Senjoughara.
>> ARTICLE
Kanbaru also can't pass up an opportunity to mercilessly harass the guy who stole the girl she loved away from her.

>What's in the closet is probably not that important, according to Kaiki. 
 
 And Kaiki himself said he was an unreliable narrator, so he could just be fucking with us on that one.
>> ARTICLE
He himself said that you doubting his words might be his plan all along. I think there's two possibilities, either he's bullshitting us just like he does Nadeko ("it's easy to deceive them because they're stupid"). Or he never once told an important lie in this arc. 
>> ARTICLE
He's proven to be too reliable (just not very thoughtful..) at this point for me to even believe that anymore. Kaiki is deceiving himself in an effort to make himself still look like the bad guy!
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been able to find out what is in the closet but I don't think they would included it in the series if it didn't end up being a key to something. 
>> ARTICLE
Erm it could be a Red Herring. We've been mislead before, haven't we?
>> ARTICLE
I think Kaiki is some kind of [death](http://i.imgur.com/vnIqVIc.jpg) [flag](http://i.imgur.com/RufhgUw.jpg) [golem](http://i.imgur.com/9QNPYJl.jpg) [now.](http://i.imgur.com/QGi02xO.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
The conversation with Ononoki is what made me think a death flag was raised. How he truly cares for people, that this is the 2nd time he is helping/doing something for Senjougahara, that she holds a lifetime grudge against him and how many times Ononoki said he will fail because of who he really is, etc.
>> ARTICLE
So from what I can gather, It looks like Kaiki doesn't want to get particularly attached to other people so even when he knows he cares about Senjougahara he can't bring himself to outright admit it. Which is why despite saying the truth outright, It was still in a sarcastic tone. I'd guess it probably has a lot to do with the woman he loved dying in a car crash. 

Since he's putting distance between himself and others it is causing him to overlook their emotions on a much deeper level. His scheme to help senjougahara didn't work because he didn't take into account her feelings which is probably not because he didn't know, but rather ignored because he didn't want to understand as it would close the distance. Though he still does care which is why he's taking the job and his desire to help her might be blinding him a bit to the reality of the situation being perhaps too optimistic.

It would make sense that he would be able to con people if he was avoiding the closer personal understanding of the people he cons while still maintaining a level of understanding of them. Unfortunately it seems he needed that kind of understanding to deal with Nadeko. On the surface she is cute/shy, underneath she is someone who is merely being forced to act that way, but at her core she is lonely and wants attention. Thus she is not the naive airhead that Kaiki believed, but actually incredibly cunning and manipulative which she uses to put on a different kind of act so people will pay attention to her. After all, she tricked everyone in Otorimonogatari. Though I wouldn't call her the smartest person, her manipulation is god-tier.

Naturally. (She *is* a god, after all)
>> ARTICLE
Seriously. That whole conversation with Ononoki just made me feel bad for the guy. It was so painfully obvious that he deeply cares for Senjougahara but he desperately doesn't want accept it. It's driving him into a corner I think...limiting his options in a way. I think he probably sees it the other way around. That being that if he gets close to his (for lack of a better word), 'victims', he will have less manipulative/conning power over them. Like you said, he wants to avoid getting too close to a person's personal life yet wants to understand the situation as if he knows them personally to successfully con them. 

The huge issue here is that he hasn't perfected his 'technique' of conning (and probably never will) because there is no way to try and pretend to understand someone you don't know personally. At least, I think it's to say that (just to give it scale) on 99% con victims, it does work because often times situations are more alike than they first seem and it becomes easier to fake out understanding and caring of them because of that. But of course, in this instance (just like the first time he failed) it is different because it involves someone he *actually* (whether he accepts it or not) cares about. 

I think at this point, Kaiki is just deceiving himself.
>> ARTICLE
It is of my opinion, that there is only one lie that Kaiki has told us is "I am a fake."  I think the truth that should be there is that, "I am a failure."  

Last, last episode, I thought it was unusual for a person like him, if he had no powers, to get in through the balcony, rather than just pick the front door.  My theory is that he does have some powers like the others, just that he failed at learning them.  So he's not a 100% fake, he's faking being a fake.

Or I'm just picking out something that's not actually there... 8)

The last 5-6 minutes felt pretty intense, even with the upbeat music and all. I still want to know what's in that bloody closet.

My speculation for what is going to happen: [Not really a spoiler, just guessing](/s "I honestly think the entire deception is based on tricking Nadeko into being knowingly deceived by someone she trusted. The "trick" seemed too obvious, even if it was intended just for her. I don't really know how he'll get out of it, but I'd imagine the closest will play a part and Kaiki will prove himself to be the most unreliable narrator... or maybe I just really want him to get out of it, he is the best girl after all")
>> ARTICLE
I think he's actually tricked us all the way, and Senjougahara as well, into thinking he's going to trick Nadeko by telling her Araragi & Co. died in a car accident. He knows (hopefully) Araragi/Shinobu wouldn't die that easily, not only physically speaking, but also in the story, since they are the protagonists. Nadeko would know that as well, and wouldn't possibly fall for it. I think he goes beyond that, and wants to show her what her "real" feelings (or lack thereof) are. 

And if all else fails, he will reveal what's inside the motherfucking closet.
>> ARTICLE
I can't really tell if they're dropping hints about Araragi and Senjougahara eventually breaking up, or if that's just Kaiki's way of talking to her. They've never dropped anything like hints before this arc, so I'm actually going to assume that it's just Kaiki's mannerisms. 

So, interesting information about Ougi huh? Oshino has no family. He has no brothers or sisters. Which means he can't have a niece. This just confirms, to me at least, that Ougi is the physical manifestation of the darkness. After the hints dropped last arc, and now this revelation that she's not actually related to Oshino I think that must be the case. I mean, what else would have her tied to the town, besides the fact that there are so many apparitions there.  

Kaiki has really become almost a tragic figure. As it turns out he has always been watching out for Senjougahara. His deception of her parents was meant for her benefit, but she didn't see it and ended up hating him. That's the very definition of a tragic figure isn't it? That you do so much work to help someone, but through misunderstanding they end up hating you. But, what I've really loved about this arc is that we've gotten to see Kaiki's true character. He's a good guy, and he normally means well. But his approach isn't always seen for what it is. 

Ohhh shit. Well. Looks like we're actually going to have the big showdown that's been built up since two arcs ago. Monogatari will not go quietly into the night. I suppose we could of seen this coming. Perhaps since Nadeko has become a God she has gained the ability to be a bit more knowing than she let on, or perhaps Gaen is involved. I guess we'll find out. 

Man, I really don't know what I'm going to say next week. Having it be the last episode for a while is kind of surreal. This series has been a constant in my life ever since I started watching Bake. Shaft has said that they're animating all of it, so I'm not worried about that. I'm just thinking how I'm going to deal with the inevitable withdrawals.  
>> ARTICLE
I thought Kaiki's initial deception of Gahara's family was to do with him pretending to have a cure for her crab curse though?

> This just confirms, to me at least, that Ougi is the physical manifestation of the darkness.

Don't google anything about their relationship, it spoils way too much of the story.

If you really want to know, [LN spoilers](/s "As of the latest stories, Gahara and Araragi are still going strong although things get even crazier than in this season. Don't expect to see much of them together though we haven't since Bake so you should be used to it by now.")

>> ARTICLE
It took a large amount of willpower to not read that spoiler.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more of Kaiki just dropping in his realistic adult perspective.  Gahara and Araragi heading off to college together is a plan that lots of high schoolers make, and HSers always think their romance will last forever.  So that's the way the way the story's been told from our HS narrators, that they'll head off to college and live happily ever after.  Now that Kaiki is narrating there's a natural element of adult doubt getting introduced into how long their young romance will truly last.

I don't think it's meant as any kind of hidden foreshadowing or anything, just that Kaiki having nothing but respect for a HS romance wouldn't be in character.
>> ARTICLE
> HSers always think their romance will last forever

*shrug* I don't know any kids who think like that. Sex is cheap (not in the monetary sense), years are long, and distance can't be bridged. Even if uncomfortable to discuss, I don't think most people can seriously believe their relationship will last till the very end, and of the handful that do, some of them are right, after all. It's not unheard of.

Plus, Araragi is an ex-vampire that keeps saving people, and that group includes his girlfriend. It's not exactly the normal foundations for a relationship.

Still, I agree that Kaiki is simply being Kaiki. One can hardly ever be too pessimistic, after all.

I wish these where fan translated. . . 
>> ARTICLE
It's being worked on.... slowly
>> ARTICLE
Isn't one of the reason's why it's being fan-translated so slowly because of the 'way' Isin wrote the book? I mean, regarding his usage and playing of the Japanese language?
>> ARTICLE
No, it's not particularly hard, easy-ish to read even, when you get used to it. Isin just writes A LOT. And it's usually unsatisfyingly eventless chitchat. You translate oreimo, you get cool scenes every two pages (at least in some volumes). Translate Monogatari, and 100 pages later Araragi finally stops discussing anime and visual culture with Ononoki and gets to discuss the same with Mayoi.
>> ARTICLE
I've always heard that the reason the books are being translated so slowly is because of the fact that Shaft is animating them. 

What I've heard is most fan translators just decided it's not worth it to work on the books when they're all going to be animated anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
No idea. I rarely check the progress, and it never appears to change even months at a time. More annoying is how damn PATCHY theyre being translated with a couple books done entirely, but other earlier books only have a couple chapters done.
>> ARTICLE
It's mostly due to the fact that these light novels aren't exactly page turners, with a more talkative element. The more popular ones are usually action ones, I.E ToAru series and not much motivation for the translators due to the fact that basically all the light novels are going to be animated anyways.

Goddamn death flags everywhere. Kaiki I'm sorry for hating you on Nisemonogatari and please don't die on us.

Need to rewatch this conversation, but is it that whenever Kaiki tries to do things for good reasons the jobs end up failing?  Hence his involved mental gymnastics every time he gets asked for help to justify it as being in his own self interest?  It would certainly explain why the rest of the old gang still maintain ties to him, despite him constantly acting like the bad guy.

Also while it's hardly news that Ougi isn't *really* Oshino's niece, Hanekawa's line of questioning means that she's also joined the Anti-Ougi Taskforce.  Either that or she's following her own investigation against her, I guess.

In my opinion, you pretty much say what it is.
Kaiki isn't bad at all, it just happen that everytime he try to do something "good", it end pretty bad.

So he find his way of life: Act like a bastards, deceive people and no care. And it seems like he's pretty good at it, but everytime he come back to being a "good kaiki" big disaster occur (ie senjougahara's mother, and i'm pretty sure it was the same for the one he loved)

Anyway i bet that the fact that it didn't succeed to deceive nadeko was planned, maybe he's trying to divert her from her previous will ?
>> ARTICLE
So, uh, two episodes left? Apparently reports of the seasons ending have been vastly exaggerated. Not that Im complaining - two more episodes of self-actualized Hanekawa, grumpy hero Kaiki, and crazy-ass Nadeko sounds good to me. Lets roll!

**Episode 25**

0:08 - [Aaand of course it just skips the Kaiki-Hanekawa conversation.](http://i.imgur.com/rhixQFJ.jpg) No, no, thats quite all right, Monogatari. Clearly we had no interest in watching the two most interesting characters have a strategy meeting, or in seeing what was in Nadekos fucking closet, for that matter. Please, by all means, show us what you will

0:15 - [And Kaiki relays it in the most deadpan way possible, as if to rub salt in the wounds.](http://i.imgur.com/rmPAgu9.jpg) Petty asshole, not wanting anyone else to share the spotlight of his story!

0:43 - [Oh. They were just skipping the recap segments.](http://i.imgur.com/mC0GSPk.jpg) Sorry for getting testy, Monogatari!

Another nice symmetrical shot here, by the way

1:00 - [And now were even getting hints of the full scale of the conflict.](http://i.imgur.com/FBePmCh.jpg) Kinda weird to think a series currently scattered over three seasons, two OVAs, and a movie-to-be is actually going to end up with an elegant, circular structure, but turns out Isins actually a really good writer. Its easier to see the unity of a more concise story like, say, Kyousogiga, but all of this shows themes tie together nicely into the central ideas of deception, identity, and perspective, and its looking like the overt narrative will be able to tie the ending back to the beginning as well

1:20 - [Gaens initial plan makes sense.](http://i.imgur.com/wAfXNCD.jpg) Why would she expect anyone to come to Heart-under-blades defense?

1:39 - [Hanekawa speaks in reflection,](http://i.imgur.com/bRKLVkM.jpg) as if describing what Nadeko herself sees in the mirror

1:44 - [Whats this?](http://i.imgur.com/U33KyCf.jpg) Has Hanekawa *not* become aware of true reality after all?! Was it all a pretentious lie?!? *Is Monogatari really no more than 2deep4u fanservice?!??!?!?*

1:45 - [Pffff haha](http://i.imgur.com/SPWU6hn.jpg)

2:08 - [Nadeko is the polar opposite of Hanekawa.](http://i.imgur.com/dmRifID.jpg) Whereas Hanekawa has finally opened her eyes to an exterior reality. Nadeko has wholly trapped herself in an interior, self-invented one, where no-one elses perspective is meaningful

2:40 - [I wouldnt have been able to say this before.](http://i.imgur.com/85BYgAl.jpg) But now Ive got THE EYE OF THE TIGER

Okay sorry that was bad. I did hear that damn Katy Perry song right after watching last episode though, and have to admit I felt kinda vicariously fist-pumpy for Hanekawas sake. Its always nice seeing great characters beat the odds

2:41 - [Kaiki begrudgingly admits the kids got chops](http://i.imgur.com/RJ1oMkH.jpg)

2:45 - [And the rooms hue changes,](http://i.imgur.com/rgoUWCZ.jpg) highlighting our friend the spotlight, just as soon as Kaiki decides he can talk to Hanekawa as an equal

3:16 - [This is such a perfect summation of one of the central points of Monogatari, and such a keen reflection on her own character and development, that I dont really have anything to say](http://i.imgur.com/HyLYCxb.jpg)

3:35 - [Is Hanekawa planning on becoming an Oshino-esque character?](http://i.imgur.com/0f3bT0X.jpg) Shes certainly more perceptive than Araragi

3:44 - [Kaiki is too smart of a viewpoint character](http://i.imgur.com/5dlkOKS.jpg)

4:47 - [Hanekawa keeping the real threat in mind](http://i.imgur.com/Jfao65j.jpg)

5:12 - [THANK you](http://i.imgur.com/QxJtdzj.jpg)

5:22 - [AND YOU EVEN DENY IT WITH A HEAD TILT GODDAMN YOU BASTARDS](http://i.imgur.com/ndgWvdU.jpg)

5:41 - [Well, thanks for your insights, Kaiki](http://i.imgur.com/iWRGS8Z.jpg)

7:53 - [Reminder: this is the same character who was essentially "fanservice-violated" in the first season.](http://i.imgur.com/FScT09x.jpg) She is now laughing and playing with blocks. *Because she is a child*

Its like Anno with his Rebuilds. Wait, they *still* dont get that its satire? Fuck subtlety, were nuking otaku culture from orbit

8:04 - [And drinking her weight in sake, apparently](http://i.imgur.com/9jDeGj4.jpg)

8:21 - [Ah, thats pretty](http://i.imgur.com/fgmJFsB.jpg)

8:51 - [You dont have to announce your own foreshadowing, Kaiki](http://i.imgur.com/l29rPm3.jpg)

9:24 - [Sweet-talk us all you want, Kaiki.](http://i.imgur.com/dNULSmG.jpg) You and I both know these things never end smoothly

10:47 - [Kinda funny that the most difficult problem of a non-Araragi arc is](http://i.imgur.com/Ac0RIJX.jpg) how do we keep Araragi from fucking everything up?

10:54 - [Is he still teasing her?](http://i.imgur.com/Pd5ovbn.jpg) He has to know her central problem is her inability to value herself - how can he advise her to use her value as a bargaining chip?

11:04 - [The very justified response.](http://i.imgur.com/QFeOgap.jpg) Man, I hope I never take for granted shows that actually have fully-articulated human beings as their protagonists

11:37 - [Once again, Senjougahara carelessly insults him even as his actions are proving the lie of her words](http://i.imgur.com/nh7vmSK.jpg)

11:40 - [And so he responds with I dont respect your words enough to even lie well sarcasm](http://i.imgur.com/g6d179c.jpg)

12:40 - [I was skipping some of the flashes in the middle arcs,](http://i.imgur.com/bp9tFTO.jpg) but I think this arc theyre required reading. Kaiki is willing to be much more honest and explicit in his thoughts than his actions. That is, if were willing to trust this narrative even that far

13:35 - [These two have the weirdest un-rapport.](http://i.imgur.com/SATSYm1.jpg) Theyre both liars, but Senjougahara is never honest with herself, while Kaiki cant help but being abrasive and randomly dishonest in spite of his honest intentions

13:55 - [Funny that we get one more of these gorgeous city shots](http://i.imgur.com/voYNZKY.jpg) while Senjougahara tells him to leave the city that only he seems to see as beautiful

14:10 - [He has his pride](http://i.imgur.com/zCbqsrB.jpg)

14:37 - [Uncle, not brother.](http://i.imgur.com/fHB2xF7.jpg) Show some respect!

16:08 - [Why is everyone determined to question his motives?](http://i.imgur.com/lry5QcP.jpg) Well, aside from Hanekawa. Oh right, its because nobody understands each other at all

16:11 - [Now thats an interesting comparison to make.](http://i.imgur.com/8lxzHUv.jpg) Is Kaiki helping people any different from Nadeko pretending shes a victim, or Shinobu pretending shes a god? If helping people really is in his nature, then yes

16:41 - [Wow. Critical information](http://i.imgur.com/DGNAJ3H.jpg)

16:47 - [And it resolved the same way Araragis acts of heroism tend to](http://i.imgur.com/KVJDPKj.jpg) - total failure, and the realization people cannot be saved from themselves

17:18 - [He says, while relating a story hes constructed to make himself look like a clear hero](http://i.imgur.com/3tZg7ha.jpg)

18:05 - [Again that defensive sarcasm.](http://i.imgur.com/b6Fqa8i.jpg) Too close

18:30 - [Wow, he is *angry.*](http://i.imgur.com/ssNZvhg.jpg) We definitely havent seen him this angry before, and the VA is really selling it. He does *not* like being analyzed like this

18:35 - [Hero pose](http://i.imgur.com/1PbEqzy.jpg)

19:18 - [Repeating the past.](http://i.imgur.com/k1c4pQg.jpg) This time, it will work. This time, he will help her. But is Gaen right? Will the world not let him help someone, simply because its outside of his nature as the deceiver?

19:52 - [She gives him faith.](http://i.imgur.com/tpfZVRs.jpg) He can make his sarcastic lies, because he knows that if people like her can survive in this world, the world really isnt as callous as he makes it out to be. Man, this aaaarc

21:17 - [Welcome to Monogatari, folks](http://i.imgur.com/8hFkaAB.jpg)

22:37 - [ABORT. ABORT. RETREAAAAAT](http://i.imgur.com/fdpkU0d.jpg)

**And Done**

AH FUCK. What kind of cliffhanger is THAT?! Ah, those assholes

Well, great episode regardless. Another excellent scene with Hanekawa, another weirdly endearing exchange between Kaiki and Senjougahara, and some possibly true context for Kaikis entire worldview, as well as the real reason he accepted this job. AND HOLY SHIT NADEKOS GONNA KILL EVERYBODY RUN.

Ahaha, what an arc to end on. Nice work, Monogatari.

-[old posts are here](http://wrongeverytime.com/)-
>> ARTICLE
An excellent write-up, as always. That cliffhanger... my god. Goosebumps and frisson all the way down. Kaiki is such a compelling antihero - can't wait to see how he deals with the impending fallout. =0
>> ARTICLE
I'm so excited for this last one - it feels like we're actually gonna get a legitimate finale. Monogatari's spoiling us.
>> ARTICLE
This is one of those shows that I'm simultaneously glad and sad to be over each time it comes around. Almost every character feels like a walking tragedy with legitimate reasons to sympathize with them. This has been one of the best and most depressing shows I've ever had the pleasure/displeasure to have seen. By the way Araragi and Kaiki have more in common than I think they'd like to admit. failed "heros" and all that.

>> ARTICLE
Oh fuckkkk that ending. 

Also this episode once again confirming Kaiki is the best 
>> ARTICLE
For this episode, I have two questions:

* So Kaika went there to deceive Nadeko, but when Nadeko asked: *"Why is it that if you tell someone else, your wish won't come true?"* he said *"Because you can't trust words, of course" ... "Words are nothing but lies and nothing but cheats."*? After that he said Araragi, Shinobu and Senjougahara died. Isn't that like saying *"Whatever I'm going to say next, it's all lies and cheats."?

* And secondly, why would he say that Araragi died in a car accident? I mean, seeing Nadeko play with all those toys and seeing her reaction to stuff, she really does seem like a small kid. But still, she must know that Araragi is a half-vampire, and would never die from something like that, right? However, I do realize that we're looking from Kaiki's point of view right now, he's an adult, and how he sees Nadeko might differ a lot from let's say Araragi's view. Where Kaiki would see her as a little kid who wouldn't think twice about what he says, Araragi sees her like someone like his sisters, I assume.

What happened here, is it mostly just Kaiki underestimating Nadeko? Were we as the audience, looking from Kaiki's point of view fooled by Kaiki's character lens? I think it's safe to say that by the way Nadeko was portrayed this arc made us believe what Kaiki said, that she was easy to deceive. But, owever easy it may be to deceive someone, isn't this the worst approach he could have taken?

**EDIT:** Apart from that, I have something to add. I'm looking forward to what Kanbaru has to do with all of this. So far her role in this has been really small, whereas they've been talking about her a lot. Will the next arc be Kanbaru's second arc?
>> ARTICLE
Your points add to what the others have had to say that Kaiki might have intentionally wanted it to happen that way; that Nadeko will figure out his deception. The contents of the closest, despite Kaiki calling it insignificant, could play a role as to what he's gonna do next. But I'm betting Nadeko is gonna be pissed with what he did and we all know the crazy shit she can do when she's pissed.
>> ARTICLE
Good point. So you're saying it might still be part of his plan, but he just decided not to talk about it? Well, I guess after all, once you put it into words it might not come true, eh?
>> ARTICLE
Could be part of his plan, and it might be far fetched but it might've become part of the plan after his talk with Ononoki. His real identity/personality was bared with that conversation and makes me think that what he's gonna do now is a form of atonement for his mistakes. IDK, I feel like I'm too obsessed seeing a death flag.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going with it being part of his plan.  I believe he already knew that Nadeko beat Arararagi and Shinobu up, especially after hearing the whole story from Hanekawa.  So he knows Nadeko has first hand knowledge of their toughness.  So when he said he was deceiving Gahara, I thought maybe the deception is going ahead with this plan to bring up the car accident as the solution instead of whatever he's going to do in the next episode.  Unless he dies... Then there goes my theory.

The result of all this deception is perhaps what Gahara and he discussed;  having Arararagi and thus Shinobu never visiting that shrine again.  Not sure what that accomplishes yet though.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's the missing Hanamonogatari arc which they took out of this season to release sometime next year. I think they are giving it more episodes than a normal arc, but I'm not sure.

So now the question is which will come first Hanamonogatari, Kizumonogatari, or Half Life 3?
>> ARTICLE
Obviously Hanamonogatari. But I highly doubt that Hana will contain more than 4 episodes. The book isn't really longer than the other books and Koimonogatari is already streched and slow-paced with 6 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Kizu doesn't really matter any more because they already fucked up big time by not releasing it before this season which had two arcs that highly depended on it. I'd love to see Kizu, but I'm currently more interested in seeing what comes next since Kizu is the only fully translated novel. 
>> ARTICLE
If the missing events are anywhere they aren't in Hanamonogatari, that book is set after this arc ends.

Edit: I'm betting on Hana coming first of those three, then Half Life, then Kizu.

>> ARTICLE
Ah my bad, I have not actually read them, I just assumed the arc they ripped out of the middle of this season would be where the missing events were.

Its all good, if anything Nisio will probably write about that later, he has a thing for writing his novels out of order.

So I've been wondering these last few episodes about how Gaen, Oshino Meme and Ougi are connected. 

On one side Gaen supposedly wants to stabilize the area by creating a god, which was supposed to be Shinobu, but she seems fine with having Nadeko in her place.

Though on the other side [Kizu Spoiler](/s "Oshino gave those vampire hunters a huge opportunity to kill her"), which doesn't really flow with what Gaen is trying to do, and now he is nowhere to be found.

Then we have Ougi going around possibly causing mischief that directly effects Araragi and his pals.

I might just have my tinfoil hat on but it seems to me that Oshino and Gaen are working against one another or maybe I'm seeing this all wrong. Anyone have any ideas, well at least anyone who has read Kizu?
>> ARTICLE
How much of the LNs have you read? [Spoilers](/s "there is most definitely a force working against Gaen. Gaen has so far sacrificed Kagenui and Araragi for her cause. At this point we really have no idea who her enemy is, what exactly everyone is fighting for, and who's on the 'good' side. Ougi and Meme are also enigmas at this point. Ougi seems to be evil but claims to be keeping a balance which is something Meme has stated as his goal before. Ougi could be using Oshino's name to gain trust or perhaps they're working together. We also have no idea if Oshino is really good or not. I'm certain that he'll make another appearance but I don't know how it'll play out. For all we know he could be the one working against Gaen though that could be good or bad.")
>> ARTICLE
Not enough to have read about everything you are talking about, but it all really does make me wonder if there is a "good" side or if everyone is out for their own special view of things.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like the one who got deceived was Kaiki.

How ironic.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately, I really doubt Kaiki was deceived. I think that was just part of his plan, to have Nadeko believes that she has figured him out. When Hanekawa talks about Nadeko, Kaiki thought he was overrating her at first, implying that he sees the Nadeko underneath that happy, naive facade. No way he would go in with a lie that a vampire dies from a car crash accident and think that would be enough to deceive Nadeko.

Uh oh! Did Kaiki goof it up?

Ah, the camera angles during the big reveal were so appropriate and matched the story so well. 

I shouldn't be surprised anymore after a history of awesome love story between Isin and Shinbo, but it still catches me off guard every time. 

Depending on the ending, this show might be the second one that gets 10/10 from me. I've never been so captivated by any show before. 

I know a lot of people have been gushing about it, but it only dawned on me after this episode, that this might be one of my favorites so far. I couldn't say that after Bake, I kinda disliked Neko:Kuro and Nise went way over my head, but this season is just shining with brilliance and awesomeness. So yeah, can't fucking wait!
>> ARTICLE
Holy. Shit. Kaiki! Unless it's on purpose! And that talk with Ononoki, why does it feel like a death flag has been raised? or I could be wrong.

BTW is this show gonna end this year or is the last episode gonna air next year January?
>> ARTICLE
definitely a "keikaku doori" moment
>> ARTICLE
One thing I wanted to add is that I noticed some people saying that Gaen might have interfered and told Nadeko something and that's why she knew he was deceiving her. I don't think that would be correct. After all, Gaen didn't want Kaiki deceiving Nadeko on the small chance he failed because Nadeko might raze the whole town. Gaen wouldn't increase that chance. I'm with the crowd that believes this is part of his deception.
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki is literally the best character of everything [ever](http://i.imgur.com/KoyHPHk.png).
>> ARTICLE
Yes. That revelation scene with the world turning upside down, even after reading that in the books, it was fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
There is one thing I wonder about. Does Shaft assume viewers have read Kizu? Because readers that are reading the second season should already know what Gaen, Episode and all that stuff is all about. But the anime is out of order. Anime viewers have not seen Kizu yet. How is Shaft dealing with this discrepancy? They keep dropping hints about what happened back then, but are they faithfully adapting Koi (or the whole 2^nd season)? Or are they accommodating the story to not spoil Kizu? Is anime 'only an illustration' of LN's, or is anime supposed to be a standalone medium? I hope you get what I mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kizu doesn't really matter any more because they already fucked up big time by not releasing it before this season which had two arcs that highly depended on it. I'd love to see Kizu, but I'm currently more interested in seeing what comes next since Kizu is the only fully translated novel. 

Kabuki was cut short by quite a bit due to the recaps but the actual events are still faithful. The other arcs have been pretty much on point too. So yeah I think they're just assuming that after Bake and Nise everyone got too curious and decided to read Kizu. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree. Kizu would have hit that much harder if it had come out during Shinobu Time. (That's when I chose to read it since that was when the movie was supposed to come out)
>> ARTICLE
They haven't told us anything. We've seen Gaen a few times and there was one reference to Episode back in Hanekawa's arc but no details. The story hasn't been too difficult to follow as a result though so maybe they're showing details here and there. I haven't read the LNs so I can't say for certain.
>> ARTICLE
Gaen wasn't in Kizu. The only characters in it are Araragi, Hanekawa, Kisshot, Oshino, Guillotinecutter, Dramaturgie, and Episode. Gaen's first appearance was in Neko White.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I don't recall ever reading anything about that time. It's still unexplained. The anime is a direct adaptation though and so far the anime has stayed very faithful to the source. Its not out of order either, the anime is following the LN release order(excluding Kizu obviously).  Also I think they made/are going to continue to make the anime with the assumption that we've seen or read Kizu, so it makes sense when Kizu does finally come out.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Kizu was the second novel released, iirc
>> ARTICLE
Nope it was the 3rd, but they're following the LN release order excluding Kizu because they kept pushing it back. It was originally supposed to premiere before Nise.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, ok. Looking it up now, I had forgotten that bake was a two-parter. Also, hana was supposed to be right after kabuki, so that one too
>> ARTICLE
Well...it made more sense for Hana to be skipped because of [Minor Spoilers for Hana](/s "when it takes place and it relevence to the other stories also details that spoil the end of Koi.")
>> ARTICLE
I feel it's the other way around [because](/s "the most important parts of Hana are foreshadowing for later stuff, like a lot of Koi and Ougi's true nature.")
>> ARTICLE
I have not read it yet, so I'll take your word for it! Honestly, I figured it wasn't going to negatively impact the overall story anyway. As connected as each arc is, they all seem to hold up quite well on their own
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Idk man I don't think you should hint/mention that kind of stuff in an episode discussion. At least tag it as spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Eh. I made it less spoilery, but I didn't say that much in the first place, just that it's from Hana.
>> ARTICLE
It's not that it said much but it still just takes away from the mysterious element of the show for those who haven't read the light novels.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously thought this show would end earlier but damn 26 episode and its still going strong. 
>> ARTICLE
Senjougahara so harsh :(
>> ARTICLE
There's something quite odd about Oshino. Kaiki tells us that Oshino never had a family to begin with, which to me suggests that he doesn't even have parents. Now, all of the characters we have met so far have explicit attachments (relatives, loved ones, ), except for Oshino Meme and Oshino Ougi.

I can't put my finger on it, but I'm thinking that Oshino's going to be really important in the third season.
>> ARTICLE
God sucks that this will most likely get buried b/c I came late but I'm curious what you guys think.

I don't know anything about Kizu, but I'm starting to feel that all the specialist are former vampires. Kaki was said to be very similar to guillotine cutter and Arararargi is sort of being trained to become a specialist. 

Anyway, I feel like Kaki has something else up his sleeve that we don't know b/c he is such a mystery.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit that ending sent shivers down my spine.

Could somebody please tell me the name of the bgm during Kaiki's convo with Ononko. It's mostly string instruments and piano. I find it beautiful but i can't find the name of the title.

>> ARTICLE
I feel a bit lost on the whole Ougi thing... Can somebody explain what exactly we know about her up to Episode 25, without spoiling anything further? This whole season I have felt like she's just "there" and I'm so lost with her conversations...
>> ARTICLE
She was the one who told Nadeko about the talisman that turned her into a Snake Goddess. She's more than likely not related to Meme (Kaiki says he doesn't have any family, so why did she lie?) and she's probably got a power over time (straight up saying 'ah that hasn't happened yet..'). But there really isn't much we do know about her as far as the fact that she *might* be the main baddy in the Monogatari Series and she might have something to do with the departure of Hachikuji. 

A lot of what she says is just 'unecessarily philosophical for the sake of impressing senpai' according to Araragi, but there is some small importance in her spewed brain-dump. Basically, she is kinda supposed to be hard to follow.

I really liked that one of the themes of this arc was "these kids need some fucking adult supervision." Kaiki drops into town and all these children are handling problems poorly, because they're kids. So asking where the hell Meme ran off to while all this went down is a pretty valid question.
>> ARTICLE
Sleeping, eating, or solving bigger problems. Kagenui is still missing, maybe Kagenui and Meme is teaming up and kaiki is the one out of the loop.
>> ARTICLE
I think someone already posted this, but in the short span of this arc, I went from hating Kaiki to absolutely loving him. Learning his backstory, his connection to Suruga, and possibly wanting to do a little good made this arc one of the strongest. And then his sudden death... I didn't see that coming at all.

RIP Kaiki Best Girl.

Incidentaly, bringing someone's temperature down a lot, like in the snow is a good way to survive head trama.  It prevents the swelling.  He just needs to be found eventually and rescued after he's stablizied.

Blew my mind how Kaiki's death came full circle. In a span of six episodes, Kaiki became my favourite character in all of Monogatari Series, makes me incredibly upset that it had to end that way. 

Also, the piano version of Senjougahara and Kaiki's OP breaks my heart.

I'm platinum mad. It was a great ending though.
>> ARTICLE
At the end of this episode I was very happy. Everyone had gotten a more or less happy endings. But more importantly everyone had gotten redemption. Nadeko was able to realize that there's more to life than romance, Kaiki was able to resolve all his past woes, Senjougahara and Araragi were safe, and even Gaen was unimplicated from the whole shadower thing. I had gotten the happy ending that I've been wanting this whole time...and then Kaiki gets beat over the head!

I can not believe they left us with that huge of a cliffhanger! Well, I can, because it's Monogatari, but still what a shocking way to finish off a season. Before this arc I was very concerned that "Hitagi End" would spell the end for either Senjougahara, or her and Araragi's relationship, but no, it seems that it's spelled the end for Kaiki. It's an interesting development that after these six episodes I care so much more for his character. I truly hope that this isn't the last we see of him. But, even that drama wasn't enough. It comes compounded along side the huge amount of unanswered questions we still have lingering. Ougi's involvment, Gaen's involvment, Oshino's whereabouts, and now who is this attacker? I'm hoping that Hanamonogatari will begin to clear some of these questions up, but this story has certainly left it's self open when it comes time to adapt the last books. I for one, like everyone else, can not wait. 

A few comments on the episode itself. The speech that Kaiki gave was honestly pretty inspiring. Not so much for the content of the speech it's self, because like he said, he stated the obvious. What was more inspirational was the almost pleading nature of it. It was kind of to the point where Kaiki was on his last leg and the only thing he could do was plead for Sengoku to listen to him. I'm glad that it worked. I'm glad Nadeko was able to gain some redemption. I didn't want to see her become a villain, and gladly she didn't. The manga artist thing was a neat angle to take, I certainly didn't expect it. I also didn't see Sengoku directly incriminating Ougi. As for what that means I guess we'll have to wait. 

Overall this was an extremely strong arc in what I would call the strongest season of Monogatari yet. Beautifully done, expertly paced, and gripping till the very end. Now we start the long wait until the next, and I think final, round of books are adapted. Before that we have Hanamonogatari to look forward to, and hopefully that will clear a few things up from this arc, and before. It's bittersweet finishing this little write up, because I won't get to do another one for awhile, but we all know more is coming, so at least we don't have to worry.  
>> ARTICLE
Nice writeup. To be honest, it was in the back of my mind that something would happen to Kaiki. After he managed to talk his way out from certain death, he might have let his guard down and then BAM. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think anything would happen to him. I figured, oh well he's been fine this whole time, so nothings going to happen now. However in this episode, and the last one I had momentarily forgotten about all the shadower business. So, the ending took me by surprise, but then thinking back to the events of the whole arc it's not surprising that something happened to him.

I think you're right though, he did let his guard down. His entire conversation with Nadeko while he was in the snakes he had his guard down. He was just pleading with her. Which is why I love that he acted all cool and calm when Araragi showed up.  
>> ARTICLE
I got the feeling more that he was pleading with her for her sake too.  I don't think he cared really whether he lived or died; I think in fact he was relieved to have died at the end.  Kind of the reverse philosophy of, 'if I die at 4pm, my $4.50 in my pocket is enough money to live on.'  "If I continue living, I'll need to find a way to earn money again.  At the expense of others."

So he ended up being honest to Nadeko for her sake, I think.  And maybe that's why she actually listened?
>> ARTICLE
the thing that really grabbed me, over and over again, about this arc was how powerless hitagi was.

the entire focus of her character so far had been how she dominated koyomi in every conversation - think back to episode 12 of bakemonogatari -  and this arc, she repeatedly "lost" to kaiki, who was, himself *a fucking snake*, just look at him and what he represents.  he put her in her place over and over again when she tried to get the upper hand in their conversations using her knowledge, then her sexuality (body), then her knowledge).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, absolutely. This arc did a very important thing with Senjougahara's character which was to expose weakness. Just like you said she has always been the dominating character in many exchanges, and relationships. You see it all through Bake. When her and Araragi first meet, when she asks him out, when she confronts Kanbaru, episode 12, and a lot of other areas. She always had this air of confidence. Even right up until this arc starts she had that really confident presence. It's really evident in the phone call that she makes to Nadeko. 

But then once this arc started all of the confidence was stripped away. And, what I think is even more interesting is that she did that to herself. A lot of time when you see a character lose confidence or something like she did in a story it's because of some big event. Some thing that shakes them up. But not so in this case. In this case she lowers her guard on her own in order to confront Kaiki. I liked this point a lot because it shows how her confidence is a little bit of a air. She puts it own a bit.

Kaiki putting her in her place is a bit I like about this arc a lot too; mainly because it exposes the main characters for what they are, high school students. The main cast are in essence just kids trying to deal with these apparitions, and we as an audience some times forget how much they don't really know. My favorite instance of this, by the way, is in Mayoi Jiangshi. When they decide to go back in time they have *no idea* what they're doing, but just decide to try it. 

By Kaiki putting Senjougahara in her place he reminds us that he has experience, he knows what he's talking about, and for the most part our main cast really doesn't. They're just young adults trying to get through high school, date, enjoy life, and move on, but their lives keep getting interrupted by all of these supernatrual events and then they have to try and deal with them. It's a common theme all throughout the series that they aren't prepared to deal with what they encounter, but just have to deal with it anyway. 

In a way what this arc did was to strip away the facade from everyone in the main cast. It broke down walls and really exposed these characters for what they really are. It was able to remind that audience that these characters were at once just people. Normal people caught in crazy supernatural circumstances, and forced to deal with them. Kaiki exposed Senjougahara for putting on an air of confidence. But at the same time he also exposed everyone else for putting own their own airs. Airs that all of them to go to get through all these supernatural events like they're nothing, but really are just normal people. 

Wow, I wrote a lot more than I thought I was going to. Sorry about that. I hope it didn't feel like I was rambling, or got to boring. 
>> ARTICLE
not at all.  i really appreciate it.   

one observation that i particularly like:   
>The main cast are in essence just kids trying to deal with these apparitions, and we as an audience some times forget how much they don't really know.

makes me think that maybe that's the point of the whole show.  even mayoi told kyomoi that learning more about the supernatural just increases the number of things you don't know.

one specula only: oshino meme was transformed by an oddity into Ougi.

it was fishy already beforehand but kaiki's death scene just nailed [the idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1ramcx/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cdlsexy) in the head: oshino conveniently missing and ougi, who nobody knows a thing about, popped out of nowhere and is like a morally 180 degree version of him.
>> ARTICLE
>aoty 2013.

You know, I was going to try arguing against that, but then I realised that I can't. It definitely is AOTY for me too. Not because it's the newest, most original or the most interesting show all the time, but because it's friggin' Monogatari. Every single week for the past half year, I've been looking forward to the next episode. The only other show that managed to do the same to me was Attack on Titan, but that was a completely new show, so it was a bit more shaky.

Monogatari Series Second Season was like the Breaking Bad of anime for me. Not in terms of quality(I won't even try comparing the two), but in terms of interest. Following it was just as exciting as following the last few episodes of Breaking Bad.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, when Araragi turned up, I was thinking "What's this idiot doing, turning up out of the blue, almost ruining everything Kaiki worked for." Then I remembered that Araragi is technically the main character.

Hopefully, reports of Kaiki's death will turn out to be exaggerated (exaggerated by Kaiki, that is). Otherwise, I am going to be platinum mad.

>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, that ending! 

I love how this arc turned kaiki from villian into an likable anti-hero. The dialogue between him and Sengoku was amazing even if it was (as Kaiki said) him stating the obvious. The Mangaka reveal was pretty unexpected. Out of all the things that could have been in the closet I never would have guessed that becoming a Mangaka would be Sengoku's greatest secret. I also really liked how it as Kaiki, not Senjougahara who got Araragi to realize that he couldn't do anything about Sengoku and that shes better off not associating herself with him. 

The BGM's used during throughout the episode were great as usual. Specifically the piano and cello version of Kaiki's theme and the piano arrangement of the OP were my favorite tracks. 

I also thought that it was really awesome how Kaiki's death was brought back to the resolution of Nadeko snake in Bakemonogatari. I always wondered what happened to the kid who got reverse cursed after Araragi saved Sengoku. We now get to see that it led him to kill Kaiki with some help from Ougi telling him that Kaiki was in town. 

I think it's pretty safe to say now that Ougi is going to be the final boss of the series. It makes me wonder just who exactly Ougi is, why does she have the Oshino name and where is Oshime Meme? So many huge things are going on in this town and he's nowhere to be found, where is he and what is his doing? 

With this arc done I can confidently say that that Monogatari: Second Season is just as good if not better than Bakemonogatari. 

**10/10** I can't wait for Hanamonogatari, Kizumonogatari, and the third and final season of the Monogatari series.

I'm glad he told Araragi off at the end. Araragi is too nice for his (and other's) own good.

Kaiki's death will be forever remembered in our hearts, Rest in Peace best girl. 

That was an amazing ride, over the span of 6 months, I have had as much fun watching this season than I remembered watching the first season. Especially with a powerful starting arc with Hanekawa, a twisted arc with Mayoi, and even the final arc. Although I regret not seeing any lovey-dovey Araragi and Senjo, I don't think that was the point of this arc, series in general. Although I am romance-deprived, I have enjoyed it to the fullest.

RIP Best girl.

And here we are at the last episode. Weve had a fantastic arc to send off a fantastic season, and Im very ready for Kaikis Last Stand. If this is his last story, he couldnt have fabricated a better one - and even if hes lying, hes selling it well enough that Im sure hed consider it more valuable than the truth. Which, even outside the context of Kaikis philosophy, has always been one of the points here - as Kaiki said last episode, sentiments are only meaningful in the context of a personal reality. Is an unvarnished, objective world really more truthful than seeing the world through a given characters personal reality? Nobody actually lives in that objective world - it is a commonality that is true to no-one. Much better to tell the truth through the lie of a personal, self-influenced reality - at least that is true to someone.

Anyway. Be it either Nadeko or Kaiki, its looking like someones personal reality is about to draw to a close. I hope youve enjoyed this walk through the personal reality of my experience of Monogatari.

**Episode 26**

0:15 - [Well shit.](http://i.imgur.com/YPdOaG9.jpg) Hanekawa might as well have warned him about this case. Shes entirely self-interested, which means she both doesnt care about *and* is unable to trust others

0:33 - [The key of Monogatari.](http://i.imgur.com/gOEKdev.jpg) The characters with apparitions dont want to acknowledge their own failings, and so they see reality as a reflection of those failings, projecting their unsavory elements outwards. Nadeko, who only projects a false self, can only see everyone around her as a liar as well

0:41 - [She is very scary.](http://i.imgur.com/dGfgCHy.jpg) HanaKanas killing this role

1:00 - [Nice shot.](http://i.imgur.com/lO7pnfn.jpg) I love Snake God Nadekos pure white-blood red color scheme. Her projection and her true self

1:39 - [And of course shes not wrong.](http://i.imgur.com/RKWO9X9.jpg) Wonderful, wonderful trick here - this is her projecting her own personal lie onto reality, which is the main conceit of Monogatari. But the particular lie that comforts her is itself the message of the show

1:57 - [I love how well Kaikis handling this.](http://i.imgur.com/bh2hNww.jpg) Talking about calling the kettle black, miss snake god who could kill me at the slightest inclination!

2:10 - [You think Kaikis impressed?](http://i.imgur.com/g7IrSmd.jpg)

2:42 - [Doesnt matter. You have to take responsibility for it.](http://i.imgur.com/jCDnKcU.jpg) Like Hanekawa, or even Mayoi

3:10 - [What a convenient way to twist it.](http://i.imgur.com/YA6J7Wc.jpg) It sounds like a real argument for a moment, but its just more selfishness. Acknowledging your faults isnt the hard part in itself - its acknowledging them and growing because of that acceptance that is difficult. Its changing yourself, and accepting the consequences of your choices. You cant just accept your flaws and see them as beautiful - thats a hollow kind of honesty

Man, its great to see Nadeko actually trying to pervert the central message of Monogatari. Even here, its not an external battle - its a war of personal growth, and Nadekos weapon is her ability to rationalize her stagnation

3:49 - [And heres Kaiki offering the central truth of Monogatari, the lesson Araragi refuses to learn.](http://i.imgur.com/0jyGyUG.jpg) No-one can defeat your personal demons for you - you have to do it yourself

4:18 - [Score one for Kaiki is like a future version of Araragi](http://i.imgur.com/9XQuqvG.jpg)

4:44 - [Oh shit its all coming together](http://i.imgur.com/clYWw9S.jpg)

5:41 - [That is just crossing a line!](http://i.imgur.com/9ckZz6x.jpg)

6:12 - [The most crazy](http://i.imgur.com/65malau.jpg)

6:37 - [Ahahaha that is the best.](http://i.imgur.com/Kw1inuk.jpg) What an amazing secret weapon

6:46 - [Embarrassed yandere snake god Nadeko is best Nadeko](http://i.imgur.com/cq5eryE.jpg)

7:07 - [And so she turns off her giant snake whirlpool of death so she can stumble down the hill and smack him.](http://i.imgur.com/iPszhJP.jpg) Really not the best at this intimidating snake god thing

7:34 - [After all that, Nadekos secret - her true self - doesnt seem like a particularly bad person](http://i.imgur.com/qS6Irrw.jpg)

7:48 - [Actually laughed out loud at this.](http://i.imgur.com/3oHadwN.jpg) Kaiki is the best

8:01 - [Stop it Im dying](http://i.imgur.com/JlQ6QPl.jpg)

8:02 - [Oh my god this episode](http://i.imgur.com/tGxEepW.jpg). Monogatari always surprises, never disappoints

8:40 - [*The stakes are high, Nadeko!*](http://i.imgur.com/OcqeHLS.jpg)

8:52 - [Pfff, yeah, whod do that?](http://i.imgur.com/SbCnQXg.jpg)

9:16 - [Personal realities may be comforting, but they sure are lonely.](http://i.imgur.com/NFLQ6TH.jpg)

10:10 - [I love how hes using happy here.](http://i.imgur.com/YKpENPh.jpg) People who acknowledge themselves dont become happy, or even happ*ier* - life is hard, were all flawed people, we all hurt each other. But the happiness of a personal reality is a boring, empty delusion, and even when youre not hurting others through your aberrations, youre not living either. Just look at Hanekawa - aimless beyond maintaining her shell prior to this season, shes now looking forward to a long, soul-crushing life as an aberration therapist

10:36 - [So much hatred towards her true self](http://i.imgur.com/KBT68DO.jpg)

10:48 - [Getting a little meta here, Isin?](http://i.imgur.com/I3K7qXj.jpg) But its both true and a good metaphor. The shells can be comforting because theyre what you think other people want. Admitting what you yourself want requires real honesty

11:11 - [Theyre getting very direct with the fundamental moral of Monogatari here.](http://i.imgur.com/rmzL1Iw.jpg) The world is tough, and may laugh at you for who you are - but dont ever let that make you disengage. Embrace the cruel, judgmental reality. Embrace failure, embrace pain, embrace your honest self. Its the only way forward

11:55 - [This is a fantastic speech.](http://i.imgur.com/4znzQZS.jpg) Perfect for his character, perfect for this story, perfect for Monogataris overall twisted-but-optimistic message

12:08 - ["Monogataris just a pretentious harem show."](http://i.imgur.com/glVKDsr.jpg)

heh

12:36 - [This is Monogatari being uplifting](http://i.imgur.com/KzjdERc.jpg)

14:10 - [He wants to believe.](http://i.imgur.com/6c8OSub.jpg) This is a world where its right to be earnest. To try and to fail and to try again. To trust

15:36 - [GODDAMNIT WHATS THAT SHITHEAD DOING HERE](http://i.imgur.com/JF76z4j.jpg)

16:55 - [And now he bluntly lists off and downplays all the messages of the series.](http://i.imgur.com/c0BMMvf.jpg) Oh, Kaiki

17:01 - [Isin does not take himself very seriously](http://i.imgur.com/oGSyaft.jpg)

17:22 - [Dont bother, Kaiki.](http://i.imgur.com/Hnmotkg.jpg) Hell never learn

18:06 - [Interesting](http://i.imgur.com/I03wUlL.jpg) exchange [here.](http://i.imgur.com/Rs7v1W0.jpg) Gaen apparently still needs a god, but Araragis of course too stuck in his must save everyone mentality to create one. Well, Kaiki tried

19:05 - [Kaikis got enough hard truths for everyone](http://i.imgur.com/1SrqizM.jpg)

19:37 - [This is such necessary, unbelievable character growth that I dont really trust its actually happening](http://i.imgur.com/j6RR47m.jpg)

In fact, all of this seems far too happy. Is Kaiki actually just narrating from near-death, impaled on a Nadeko snake?

19:57 - [Kaiki gives himself all the best shots and all the best lines](http://i.imgur.com/DkgI2E4.jpg)

20:37 - [Lovely](http://i.imgur.com/YhcQT8L.jpg)

20:59 - [Kaiki spoils her](http://i.imgur.com/NYf6sCC.jpg)

21:26 - [Again, one of the most powerful things you can accomplish in Monogatari](http://i.imgur.com/nAGqz5F.jpg) - knowing someone outside of yourself. Also love how very Kaiki it is for him to feign disinterest in her one-upmanship, and then say haha I knew it was you right before hanging up

22:24 - [Pot kettle black again.](http://i.imgur.com/RRJmogw.jpg) Also love this sickly-sweet piano arrangement of the sickly-sweet OP

22:26 - [Wonderful shot](http://i.imgur.com/b3AGBFv.jpg)

22:37 - [KAIKI NO.](http://i.imgur.com/qKQdmha.jpg) ...and yet I still have to admire how lovely this shot composition is too

23:07 - [Another great one.](http://i.imgur.com/pDeFG8v.jpg) And once again Ougi is to blame

**And Done**

Oh god. What an ending. Oh fuck. Jesus. Kaiki. Gah.

Wow. Kind of destroyed by that. Both the arc and the epilogue were telegraphing a bad end for Kaiki, but that it was so sudden and so unattached to the consequences of the narrative that it still came as a shock. And then just cutting to black

Well, that was an arc. A fantastic arc, in fact. Very possibly the best arc of the best season of one of the best anime out there. All the ideas of deception and perception and identity came together beautifully, Nadekos godhood was resolved in a way both poignant and funny, and Kaiki checks out with a fantastic speech and the talking-to Araragi sorely needed.

In a very Nadeko way, Im almost happy Kaikis dead. Hes preserved, now - he nailed an incredible arc that pulled all the series ideas together while also being more funny and full of great character moments than virtually any of the others.

Not that we know how much of this story was actually true. But itd be an insult to Kaiki to pretend that even matters - the story we saw is the story as it exists for us, and *that* story was fantastic. Whether it was a real or a fake, respect is due.

And a legend passes... RIP Kaiki, you will be missed. I find it somewhat depressing that he had good intentions to try and help people all along, but it never turned out the way he expected and he just looked like a bad guy to everybody. ;_;

Now the spotlight shifts onto Ougi. It seems that for everything that happened throughout the series, she was slowly but subtly introduced, and now her role as the real villain is becoming the new focus point. Hopefully the next season will come soon. It was a great six-month ride.

Two of my favorites are now down for the count, who will be next? :(

>and now her role as the real villain 

I know nothing about the novel, but it's never as simple with NisioIsin. Odd is that everything will be in a gray area, and the resolution will be very emotional, but true to the show logic.  Kind of like Katanagatari ending. 
>> ARTICLE
>it's never as simple with NisioIsin

Have to agree with you on this statement, as we all thought Kaiki was the villain in Nise, and look how he turned out. That's one of the things I really enjoy about the Monogatari series.

I don't know, the way he talked right at the end made me think he thought he was gonna die "They say money talks even in Hell. I didn't have any money saved up, so I was glad from the bottom of my heart that I earned a bit of pocket change".

The ending credits seemed to have something that says the manga that Nadeko made is called "Kimi to Nadekko" (there are supposed to be 2 "k"s).

Is that just something they did to make the manga seem more official? Hopefully it will actually be released some day.

>> ARTICLE
Our total 180 in terms of how we perceive Kaiki was masterfully done. He started off as this hilariously unapologetically evil villain, but he died a hero. I'll miss you Kaiki, and I'll miss Monogatari.

Kaiki ;_;, Never thought you'd be such an awesome character after nisemonogatari but you sure pulled it off, you glorious bastard

So, LN readers, how much of the source has been covered so far? Is there enough material left for another season reasonably soon? Or has the anime caught up? How often do the new LNs come out?
>> ARTICLE
There's still Hanamonogatari which will come out on 2014 and a final season to Monogatari
>> ARTICLE
I don't know how many of the LNs will be adapted per season, but Koimonogatari (containing Hitagi End) is the end of S2. There's still... 

Tsukimonogatari (Yotsugi Doll) 

Koyomimonogatari (Koyomi Stone) 

Owarimonogatari vol 1 (Ougi Formula, Sodachi Riddle, Sodachi Lost), published most recently in Oct 2013, and 

Owarimonogatari vol2 (Ougi Dark), release date Jan 31, 2014. 
>> ARTICLE
Ougi dark sounds awesome! I'm pumped they have more source material!
>> ARTICLE
> Sodachi Riddle

Sodachi? Who's that? New character?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. One of the few left to be introduced.
>> ARTICLE
Good, it seems like there is plenty of material left to adapt before the anime is caught up
>> ARTICLE
Owari is gonna have 3 volumes. And there's still Zokuowari.

And Koyomi has 12 stories, it's not just Koyomi Stone.
>> ARTICLE
And fucking Kizumonogatari. -_-
>> ARTICLE
Don't kid yourself, we're NEVER getting Kizu.
>> ARTICLE
SHAFT: "We're not giving you Kizu, but as a consolation, here's Nisekoi."
>> ARTICLE
At least it's a pretty good consolation
>> ARTICLE
is there actual action in Kizu? is that why they aren't giving it to us?
>> ARTICLE
There's more in Kizu than the rest of the series combined so far - at least five if I remember correctly, and six if you count one instance of a certain someone getting beat on for a few minutes before their ass is saved.


>> ARTICLE
There are a few fight scenes, but they couldn't be any more difficult to animate than the Rainy Devil or Kagenui fights. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd just like to point out that as a novel reader, this thread is delicious.
>> ARTICLE
I am curious how they portrayed the sudden attack in the novels, was it as shocking and unexpected in text format?

>> ARTICLE
Not as much, because you knew that something had to happen due to foreshadowing that SHAFT skipped.

>> ARTICLE
Could you clear something up for me? Spoilers ahead after Episode 26

[Spoiler](/s "Kaiki comes back in Hana and has dentures now because of the attack, right?")

well, I'm always tempted to read spoilers, read this 1 and i dont kno how to feel now
>> ARTICLE
Try a mixture of horror and sexual attraction.
>> ARTICLE
Yup.
>> ARTICLE
Correct. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I don't care if its spoilers. I had to know...

Someone please answer this person! I might snap my laptop in two. :[
>> ARTICLE
The answer is yes, they do.
>> ARTICLE
Something I noticed with the Monogatari series is that they haven't killed off many characters. Up until now they've only *really* gotten rid of Mayoi, which was a pretty sad moment, but Kaiki's death didn't really make me all that sad, it's kind of a bummer yeah, but I was never really attached to him. Although he did make a damn good narrator.

Can't wait to see any reactions from the main characters on his death(I imagine Gaen will tell the main cast about it at some point), specifically Senjougahara and Koyomi. Next season should be fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
In terms of the monogatari series I've always thought the character is placed above plot (the plot is consistently good but never the main feature and usually more of a thematic vehicle). So while KoyomiVamp doesn't advance the story, its massive progress for character and context, allowing us to actually understand the nature of the relationship between Shinobu and Araragi. So... be excited for KoyomiVamp.
>> ARTICLE
>minus KoyomiVamp 
 
 While it won't advance the story, Koyomi Vamp is still freaking awesome. It's basically the "action anime" style arc that this series deserves.
>> ARTICLE
When did Araragi receive the snake talisman from Gaen? That always confused me.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was one of the things she wanted him to help with in return for her "help" in the Hachikuji arc. 
>> ARTICLE
This was a really powerful episode for me. I'll really miss Kaiki. I hope there is a season three and not ova's to finish this series off.
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki noooooo, and I love how Sengoku reacted to him talking about her manga.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god no Kaiki why? It's not fair. Ougi must be destroyed. And where is /u/Bobduh? I need someone to make sense of all this for me.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, Kaiki just earned a spot on my favorite characters list. In fact he earned himself the top spot.

A note about his "death". His narration is unreliable. I think he is exaggerating his own death. Misinformation is his specialty after all. I also noted that Nadeko did not know about Hachikuji's death which might mean that Araragi fooled Ougi successfully.
>> ARTICLE
Im not sure about anyone else, but this ending left a bad taste if my mouth and I'm feeling really really empty (isnt this something that happens when only a truly loved main protagonist or hero dies?)

The series (minus this one episode) was enjoyable and amazing (like the past monogatari series) and I hope the next one is just as good...

In this entire series (past included) Senjougahara is my favorite, and Hanekawa was my second - but Kaiki bumped Hanekawa down to third after winning me over this season.

Goddammit Kaiki.... 
>> ARTICLE
I will let you in on a secret us veterans learned, kaiki and arararagi are automatically best girl(11/10) so they actually don't get put on the same scale as senjougahara and hanekawa. Kinda like you don't compare DaVinci to the scribbles done in preschool art class. They are both art, but on a completly different scale.
>> ARTICLE
It is all a lie... it is all fake... I won't accept the best girl ending like this. 
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki dying made me so sad, but I donno if many of you noticed but his ability is that he can see apparitions and curses, and he uses them for good and evil, but never the good that is asked of him and only evil that is valueless for money. He's an amazing character and I hope he somehow survives. Also Monogatari is just getting better all the time, how is this happening??
>> ARTICLE
I loved how a piano version of the OP played near the end of the episode, I can't wait for the OST to be released.

So according to what we heard this episode, Senjougahara and Kaiki had some kind of relationship before? "She's treating this relationship like it's the first she's ever had" and "Did you believe I loved you back then?" hints at them having a relationship before, in which Kaiki thought that Senjougahara had feelings for him.

I didn't expect that ending at all, that was quite something. So this 'Ougi' person told this boy that Kaiki was back in town, the boy that hated him a lot, enough to kill him. Ougi, the name sounds familiar (Ougi Oshino?), but I can't put my finger on it. I believe there was a scene where Nadeko, before she turned into a god, talked with her.  There was a scene I think I also recall some scene in the classroom, which was a flash to the future, it was later in the evening and I think either Ougi was there, or they talked about her. Can someone help me here?

**EDIT:** Now I think about it, wasn't it Ougi, in that conversation with Nadeko, who told her about the charm? Isn't Ougi the whole reason she turned into a god in the first place? I just found the episode, and she literally says: *"I'm sure it's somewhere in the Araragi residence. If the seal is broken, I'm sure it could easily grant you your wish, Nadeko"* She even suggests her to swallow the seal, since it's a snake god. Besides, she's referred to as Ougi Oshino. How is she related to Meme? Where'd she come from? 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/ZzlsvZd.png) is her, by the way.

Do you ask if she was in a romantic relationship with Kaiki like she is now with Koyomi? Haha that would be pretty creepy, but nope, that's not true. It's just hinted, or rather suspected by Kaiki that she used to have feelings for him 2 years ago, however he is not sure if that was really a matter of fact or not (''[...]Did you think I was really in love with you?" ''At least I thought you did.'').
>> ARTICLE
Ougi is definitely the culprit behind a lot of the stuff that has been happening however we also saw in some of the  recent episodes that Ougi is not be who she's claiming to be. In the conversation between Kaiki and Hanekawa, Hanekawa says Oshino has never mentioned having a niece and Kaiki himself says Meme is one without family. I don't think in Bake or Nise for that matter either that Meme ever talks about his family. While it would'nt be surprising that Meme is just estranged from his family he wouldn't know his niece, Ougi seems enough of a manipulator she would claim some relation to someone they know to ease their minds of her odd presence in town.
>> ARTICLE
> How is she related to Meme? 

highly probable specula: she is meme

>Where'd she come from? 

probably altered by an apparition is my best guess. he likes to hang around teenagers so much (kaiki's own words) that he became one ( a really evil one - probably jealousy driven? .. cause apparitions are nothing more than their psychological deviances embodied into gods.)
>> ARTICLE
Woah, I actually didn't think about her being an appartion, or altered by an apparition. Now you say it, it does sound fairly plausible. I guess we'll have to see in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Ougi is not a standard apparition, as far as we can tell but she/[Hanamonogatari](/s "he") has superhuman abilities. If your theory is correct then I think rather than Oshino being altered by an apparition, he was altered by the darkness that chased Hachikuji. Your theory is quite interesting and one I haven't seen before. 
>> ARTICLE
Haha, that Hanamonogatari spoiler made me smile. I can't wait to see people's reactions to this.
>> ARTICLE
I was not ready for that at all... pls kaiki nuuuu D;

Also this is horrible, they teased so much stuff at the end that its pretty unbearable to have to wait for the next arcs to be released :/

*"they say money talks even in hell...  
since I don't have money saved up, I felt  
really glad from the bottom of my heart...  
that I was able to earn a bit of pocket change at the very end."*  
  
His last words tell us that he never earned any large amounts of money and that the last 6 episodes were him talking away the money he got from his last job... - he seems to be dead for sure :(  
One of the biggest "evil guy turns out to be really good"- guys in anime

Now let's just hope that Ougi get's what she deserves and that fast...

Did the art seem a little low quality in a few places to anyone? The scenes where it really mattered it was spot on but it looks like they might've had to rush a few things.

Some of the snakes forming that "sea of snakes" just seemed to disappear. I could only see it happening on the horizon. It might've looked better if they had faded out rather than blink out, but maybe they did it that way on purpose.

On purpose. That's what happened in the book.
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki no ;_;
>> ARTICLE
someone has to have a chat with NisiOisiN, killing off some of my favorite characters in this ghostory. I'm guessing I feel the same way about Ougi that I feel towards Lahel in Tower of God...and I'm glad Kaiki was the one to ask the question, "what the hell is Oshino doing?"
>> ARTICLE
Just as Kaiki is walking out of the darkness and into the light (heel face turn) he gets done in... that is just crazy.
>> ARTICLE
Wow what an amazing episode, absolutely loved our dear Nadeko freaking out about Kaiki looking in her closet, just an amazing and priceless reaction.

This was really my favorite arc out of the monogatari series, Kaiki's voice actor is really an amazing man, just fantastic work.

I can't wait for the next season, it says it will be after Ararararagi graduates high school which is quite rare to see something that goes that far like Clannad:After Story.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished marathoning this whole franchise...it was amazing...I don't know how I'll be able to sleep tonight.

WHAT IN THE ACTUAL SHITFUCKS!?!?!?!?!?! I've never had such a reaction to an anime before. I never thought I would be so crushed by the death of a character I hated until recently. I'M SO FUCKING UPSET

Ok I wasn't going to post because I didn't want to spoil the ending (since that took me completely out of left field) but then I realized there is already a spoiler tag in the title and everyone else is so...

OOMMGGG that ending. That ending COMPLETELY took me by surprise. Way to end it at a place that I want SO much more now. Well played, Well played. 

I seriously need to collect my thoughts some more (since I JUST finish watching it), my mind is overloaded atm with shock and disbelief. 

Also finally got to see what was in the closet.

So Ougi is the evil mastermind behind everything? Didn't he/she have like 5-10 minutes of screen time total? Same with Gaen, I don't even understand what her purpose is in the story. People are talking about the story all coming together as a whole but all I saw were a bunch of separate arcs that don't have much connection.  

Monogatari is 3deep5me

nooooooo
Kaiiiikiii

On another note, how does the [ending of Nadeko Medusa](http://i.imgur.com/hJpK3iZ.png) fit in with Nadeko now losing her god powers??

That was just Nadeko dreaming about the perfect ending for her, it wasn't actually a flashforward or anything.

NOOOOOOOOOO KAIKI!!!!!!

I...I don't even know what to say about this.

>> ARTICLE
Why must SHAFT make me wait for Hanamonogatari while I still hold so many questions? I feel so empty again.

I really want to know Ougi's motive in all that she has done. She got rid of Kaiki because he proved to be a big interference in her plans. Also who is she?

AND Where is Meme? I prefer him over Gaen.
>> ARTICLE
Wow this series is absolutely spectacular. 

I'm extremely happy to find that there is now a main villain because makes it possible to have a seriously badass finale and with a show like this I need the closure to accept an ending

Ougi really interest me though. If we assume Ougi is infact the darkness or "the punisher of liars" like she said then she is responsible for the death of two characters. I'm expecting ararararagi to kick her ass when he finds out.

I'm really looking forward to next season/ movie/ OVA/ anything. If anyone has any info it would be appreciated.
>> ARTICLE
I did not seen that coming (neither kaiki). I'm glad though he did not died meaningless death. Looks like ougi indirectly killed him.
>> ARTICLE
Great end to the season. Now the wait for the next installment to the series begins. 
>> ARTICLE
Bet he gets saved by kanbaru, that road seems familiar.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved Monogatari, can't wait for Hanamonogatari and Endstory (Season 3). 10/10, this story arc was the best.
>> ARTICLE
I was utterly devastasted by that ending.
Just when I was ready to accept his parting monologue and see him set off in the sunset, they did this.
They let an old wound get to him.

Kudos SHAFT, kudos Nisio Isin, I have not seen such a good bad ending in a while.

P.S. please release Kizu already? I'm sure you've animated the entire arc already since you've given us so many teaseful flashbacks spread out in the entire show...
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe Kaiki died... I was starting to like that guy. Bring that guy back!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I just watched something profound yet is just outside of my reach. This show is really on a level all of it's own.
>> ARTICLE
Augh! My heart can't take the pain this show has given me! So glad we finally figured out what was in the closet though. But Kaiki & Hachikuji will forever be remembered. I'm so distraught.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck holy fuck holy fuck holy fuck.

Incredible end to an incredible series...

I love the foreshadowing of Oshinos return, or whereabouts, really screws with you.

FUCK I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON TO AIR!  Including Kizumonogatari (tm)

NOOOOOO!!! KAIKI! KAIKIIIIIII!!!!!!!!

Goddammit, just when he looked so cool after he finished his job given to him by Senjougahara...

What. The. Fuck?!

Fuck it. I was going to rate this season 8/10, but they say the ending is paramount, so **9/10** it is. This is the kind of cliffhanger that I lovehate.
>> ARTICLE
Quick question, what other parts of the series are being planned for anime?
>> ARTICLE
Well damn. Monogatari's still got one of the best character writing of any show, and definitely didn't think Kaiki was just gonna die. He never even got introduced to Kanbaru.
>> ARTICLE
Okay without looking at the comments, how did you guys watch it so fast? I looked at Commie's schedule and the typesetting hasn't been done yet. What time/day will it come out? Ugh O_O
>> ARTICLE
It was simulcast on [Daisuki.](https://www.daisuki.net/movies/seriesdetail/o)
>> ARTICLE
Damn. Too bad Kaiki had to go. He really did become one of my favorite characters over that arc. Great season!
>> ARTICLE
God that was a crazy ending. I got mixed feelings because I didn't want Kaiki to die but I love that the story line keeps me guessing.

It seemed to me that Kaiki also was deceiving himself as the great deceiver he is. How in the beginning he seems to be trying to deceive himself into agreeing to do the job for the little money senjougahara had. When he talked about how he though that he believed that senjougahara and Gaen had tried to deter him so he would want to stick with it more almost seemed like he wanted to believe that more than him factually believing it. It made me feel like I was really starting to understand his character and then bam, they kill him off. 

Crazy...
>> ARTICLE
Guys, What was the foreshadowing in ep15 about then? Could it be that it happens either way?
>> ARTICLE
That scene where they are all gathered at the shrine? That's not necessarily foreshadowing, just Snake's fantasy.
>> ARTICLE
This was the best series I have watched all year. I binged through Bake and Nise, and MSSS WAS AMAZING! I WANT MOAR! 

I really do hope we get Kizu at *some* point, even though Shaft likes to tease us. 

I am taking Japanese for the first time this term so that I can start reading the LNs and watch the raws at some point, but if anyone could direct me to translated LNs I would so grateful to the user-sama who did. 
>> ARTICLE
fucking great
>> ARTICLE
Oh god I loved that scene where Kaiki meets Araragi when he is going to leave the temple and says "I'm not supposed to be in this town. If she finds out, Senjougahara will kill me." I guess that means Kaiki was never in any real danger from either Araragi OR Senjougahara.
>> ARTICLE
By the way is no one going to mention nopan Nadeko?  I bet she did it on purpose too, something that Kaiki probably found, 'not amusing.'  He's like the anti-Arararagi, even to the point of being the one to set Arararagi straight with a lecture.
>> ARTICLE
That ending... ; A ; ... but was it true? 
>> ARTICLE
What happened to Kaiki at the end was anticlimatic, yet strangely appropriate.
>> ARTICLE
So this is the end of Second Season... Whats next? and when? I NEED MOAR DAMNIT!
>> ARTICLE
and here am I a month later afraid of a hitagi X Kaiki been real or having any real base, maybe the fact that I just rushed tje Whole thing but the one I really feeled was Hachikuji ones QQ
>> ARTICLE
I want to ask something, I remember kaiki saying that Oshino Meme Doesnt have a family, 

and if my memory serves me right, kaiki doenst know someone named Oshino Ougi

Could it be that Ougi is responsible for the disappearance of oshino meme?, And i believe that oshino said that he wont just disappear suddenly without saying goodbye, So why the sudden disappearance. 


Btw I miss Kaiki, :(

Wow. This is the first 10/10 anime for me. Wow.

So was kaiki the one that was (or did) take physical advantage of Senjohara before she met araragi?  She kind of said it once but didn't really explain other than that one time she was with araragi watching the stars.
[Kairki](/s "now that it was explained that she (might have been) was in love with Kaiki stockholm syndrome style?")

>> ARTICLE
It was mentioned that Kaiki took down the cult that her mother got into in the first place. The cult member that tried to take advantage of her was more than likely a member of that cult. She then of course joined a second more powerful cult later culminating in his failure. He was just one of the people she called to get rid of the apparition at first. Kaiki couldn't help her with the apparition, so he tried to get rid of the mother who he saw as the volatile part of her life. Severing and binding if you will. Kaiki only plays the part of the bad guy.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh ok that makes sense I didn't know. .. was that all in the LN?  There was no abuse tho right?  They just had intentions of doing so? 
>> ARTICLE
Gahara beat the guy over the head with a metal object; I forgot what it was though. It was an attempted sexual assault. At most she was groped. 
>> ARTICLE
I was just curious I didnt think this series was all fate/zero dark.... man.....that shit..... Poor Sakura
>> ARTICLE
My personal feel of the show was that it was a dark show with comedy overshadowing whats actually happening/happened. If anything the way Araragi tries to solve his own problems usually end up fate/zero dark for him.
>> ARTICLE
She hit him with a spike shoe. And yep, it was just an attempted sexual assault.

I didn't think we could have a narrator less reliable than Araragi, but completely delusional Nadeko is definitely just that.

I am fine with this.

So Kanbaru was right, Nadeko is the final boss.

I can't remember, when was that said again?
>> ARTICLE
I believe it was the episode right after Nadeko invited Araragi over to play twister. If not, I do remember it was a sequence when Araragi was at Kanbaru's house (which could be the episode before, I think).
>> ARTICLE
Okay, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Well now Nadeko has joined the rank of greatest yanderes alongside the pink haired axe wielding queen herself. Which did get me wondering, is there something that inherently links yandere to gods? Come to think of it, the traditional bible God is pretty yandere too, being all "love me or burn in hell"... which injects a little yanderemoe into theism as a whole, feel like converting to a religion now.
>> ARTICLE
Nadeko's possessiveness is quite common of religious deities. Kuchinawa was not kidding when he said she was fit to be a god.

Nadeko has definitely become my favorite yandere. She's joined the ranks of the greatest!

She's not a ~~red~~pinkhead.  The character I'm talking about is flip-flopping tsundere/yandere but you don't know it immediately and this has considerable bearing on the plot.  She's the only pink-haired character in it, so if I said the name I'd give away too much.

I probably shouldn't have said anything, it's something I'd hate myself for spoiling.

Well fuck.

Watching my Nadeko stab my Shinobu was (extremely) painful.

>> ARTICLE
For clarification:

Next arc is Onimonogatari with the story Shinobu Time, it takes place before this whole Sengodess (Nadekami? idk...) thing, after Kabukimonogatari and during Nekomonogatari:Shiro.

EDIT:

Just finished the episode, I almost missed the last bit after the credits. I'll admit that last part was really cute. It would be great if the whole cast was there, I agree with Nadeko. Imagine that? Like an all out oddity war!

Great way to end this arc. I'm really looking forward to the continuation.

I just have to say, Kanbaru with long hair looks REALLY weird to me.

I dunno. I like it. 

Actually, I liked her hair more in Nise, when it was long enough to be in pigtails but not as long as it is now.

It's not bad, just... to me the short hair seems to suit her better.

is [Hanamonogatari](http://bakemonogatari.wikia.com/wiki/Hanamonogatari) going to be next? im really looking forward to this conclusion arc. i haven't read the books but i might have to read them in order after this is over
>> ARTICLE
Nope it's not. They slated Hanamonogatari, so next is Onimonogatari then Koimonogatari (finale).

Hanamonogatari is gonna be a TV special like Neko:Kuro was and it's most likely gonna wrap up this season
>> ARTICLE
so its Onimonogatari,then Koimonogatari and Hanamonogatari will wrap it up later

Yup, pretty much. Koi is gonna be the last arc of Monogatari Series Second Season then Hana will come out a little later like at the start of 2014 I think..

Man. Ive always thought Monogatari was an extremely interesting and generally compelling show, but this season *this season* you guys. Absurd jump in quality. Neko Shiro is probably my favorite arc of anything in the series, Zombies versus Vampires From the Future Past was one of the most entertaining, and this ones keeping up the hits. Great direction, a powerful portrayal and subsequent breakdown of Nadekos personality, and HanaKana going all pissed-off delinquent on us. And now here we are at the showdown - Nadekos been caught red-handed with a personality and desires of her own, something shes only been moderately successful at hiding so far. We kind of already know how this discussion ends, but Im game to see how we get there.

**Episode 15**

0:25 - [I love his negotiating with terrorists routine](http://i.imgur.com/cUK2nyW.png). It was such a great choice to cast these arcs from perspectives other than his - hes pretty much played out development-wise for now, his relationships with the girls are stable from his perspective, and hes just too powerful in this world. Removing him creates danger, allows for more character illumination, allows the show to use its great cinematography for perspectives other than his, reveals a bunch of character dynamics that kind of get overrun by Araragis presence a big part of my appreciation of this season is based on its moving the focus away from Araragi

0:38 - [So great how they keep framing this as her talking to herself.](http://i.imgur.com/d95UgcN.png) The fact that the snake represents undesirable parts of herself is even more apparent here than it was with Hanekawa - and I like how she basically slips up and says its okay because I dont care if he figures everything out, which is certainly relevant to *her* emotional hangups, but certainly wouldnt do a damn thing to resolve the fantasy-snake-narrative shes manifesting those hangups into

0:58 - [DONT JUMP NADEKO. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEED YOU](http://i.imgur.com/1jx3tv6.png)

1:27 - [Araragi and his damn poses](http://i.imgur.com/zXBTyco.png)

2:13 - [Goddamnit Shinobu shes gonna shoot the hostages](http://i.imgur.com/Fxx0W0D.png)

2:36 - [Ah. That explains it.](http://i.imgur.com/V77HUGO.png) Goddamnit Shaft, we need some Kizu context!

3:01 - [You made this bed, Nadeko.](http://i.imgur.com/9lUmi9p.jpg) No ones saving you this time

4:09 - [Had to get that one](http://i.imgur.com/ys3zYrT.jpg)

4:41 - [All the yandere you could ask for](http://i.imgur.com/BLV3fO8.jpg)

4:45 - [Excellent shot choice.](http://i.imgur.com/BgmW1me.png) Theyre making this incredibly visceral - it looks like were with Araragi again (obviously, since were also seeing her attack from behind his eyes)

4:52 - [They sure make violence pretty](http://i.imgur.com/cvTWQoR.jpg)

5:24 - [Alone in the spotlight again.](http://i.imgur.com/FJNN25Y.jpg) Not safe because shes protected, but safe because shes killed her audience

6:13 - [Nice shot.](http://i.imgur.com/LCoRw4g.png) Her snake palette is pretty chilling

6:54 - [Another nice one](http://i.imgur.com/DXsdpYd.jpg)

7:35 - [Theyre really making me earn my unpay](http://i.imgur.com/MnTtqT2.jpg)

7:49 - [Yep.](http://i.imgur.com/unNqFYF.jpg) She ran out of people to hide behind, so she invented one of her own

9:03 - [Her body as the representative object.](http://i.imgur.com/giFzyMf.jpg) Cute

9:27 - [They keep using those trailing lines of text.](http://i.imgur.com/4SnyXl6.jpg) Not really sure what to make of them - they also appeared on the walls of the school on the morning she exploded, and elsewhere before that

10:15 - [NADEKO YOU DIDNT.](http://i.imgur.com/bPIRHal.jpg) Well I for one am shocked by this behavior

11:43 - [So this was part of the time we lost during that hypnotism routine?](http://i.imgur.com/MEGef8G.jpg) Man, what is Ougis *game?* Theyve deliberately designed her to not look human - she looks even less human than Yotsugi. She knows basically everything, and seems to drop intentional, mocking hints about stories before they even happen. She claims to be Oshinos niece, but that yeah, sure.

12:05 - [Full circle on the is there anything youd wish for, along with the Tsukihi conversation](http://i.imgur.com/m6a5d0E.jpg)

12:22 - [So yeah. She set basically every variable of this story in motion.](http://i.imgur.com/xE8zOIB.png) Sure, Nadeko already *did* have all these issues - but Ougi lit the fuse

13:00 - [These puddle shots look really nice](http://i.imgur.com/H7KR3In.jpg)

15:01 - [She *is* getting awfully hung up on these titles while hanging around and casually stabbing people](http://i.imgur.com/EruAfat.jpg)

15:38 - [Unreliabler and unreliabler](http://i.imgur.com/9V99TYI.jpg)

16:22 - [This is actually a pretty honest and brutal portrayal of what the yandere nonsense might build out of.](http://i.imgur.com/JROsWU0.jpg) A love not of a real person, but of your still, captured image of that person, your idealized version of that person that really only exists to confirm and cushion aspects of yourself. Something perhaps a little too relevant to be accidental in the context of otaku and ideas like idol "purity

16:34 - [This arc has made Nadeko awesome.](http://i.imgur.com/bVjGETr.jpg) Great goddamn work, Isin

16:42 - [Aw, dont be like that, Kuchinawa](http://i.imgur.com/R1fMwG6.jpg)

17:00 - [The phone call breaks her revery and returns us to the real world palette](http://i.imgur.com/Ab9Ongo.jpg)

17:07 - [Ahaha great.](http://i.imgur.com/2pd2KTo.jpg) I *was* going to kill him, but this could be *important!*

18:31 - [Wow, Senjougahara really knows how to make the most of her screentime](http://i.imgur.com/i2JWxMq.jpg)

20:30 - [Thanks but no thanks.](http://i.imgur.com/HEq9cjz.jpg) And back to the spotlit darkness

23:40 - [The shrine's rebuilt, complete with the warning/construction signs that mark so much of the Monogatari universe. Physical presence reflective of a god being in residence?](http://i.imgur.com/xkHIq5T.jpg)

Also more metaness, of course

23:50 - [Somewhat inconceivable this could end with an actual battle, considering Monogatari, but you never know](http://i.imgur.com/Iakdepg.png)

**And Done**

Ahahaha jeez. That certainly wasnt what I was expecting, but thats Monogatari for you. A few minutes of tense hostage negotiation, a minute of insane yandere murdering, and then half an episode of talking to herself about her own craziness. And Senjougaharas own brand of so-in-control-its-terrifying possessiveness saves the day! Wonderful. I also couldnt have asked for a better [ending shot](http://i.imgur.com/ifelabV.jpg) - Nadeko has certainly come a long way. Hopefully we get more yandere snake god development down the line - even though shes currently making a pit stop at psychopathic crush-murderer, Im sure this is all just part of the healing process. Im a fan.

-edit- Woops, missed the post-credits bit. Exciting times! I assume we won't actually *see* any of that happen for a good five years or so, but still! Nice to see the hero squad all in formation and everything.

That's some good old-fashioned nightmare fuel. Very Kubrick-esque; eyes almost dead-center-frame, not blinking, and staring straight at the viewer.

five years is a long time to wait. i thought their was only one more arc before this
>> ARTICLE
Just wondering, but are you going to write a scene-by-scene analysis of Kizu ~~if~~ when it comes out?  Cuz that would seem somewhat tedious.
>> ARTICLE
If Kizu ever actually comes out, I'd do it the same way I did [Neko Black](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/07/03/blood-ties-and-nekomonogatari/) (or anything from my backlog) - just take personal notes and only put up an essay if the film warrants one.
>> ARTICLE
I really love that scrunchie.  Not only is a scrunchie used to tie the hair out of your eyes, which is a pretty thematically-laden activity for Nadeko right there... But it's also something *she never does*.  So why does she own a scrunchie at all?  Just a really nice job of setting things up so that last-minute reveal feels legitimate and not a last-minute ass pull.

Also a nice job of revealing that Nadeko was praying to get with Araragi, which parallels nicely with her insistence back in the first ep of this arc that she was literally the only person in her class not to buy a charm.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I absolutely loved how they set up how much of this was self-generated. The snake was so perfectly echoing her own thoughts all along that it being more or less a fabrication comes off as more natural than if it *were* an apparition from the start. This whole series is a great exercise in unreliable narration, and this arc was a particular standout on that front.
>> ARTICLE
> I assume we won't actually *see* any of that happen for a good five years or so, but still! Nice to see the hero squad all in formation and everything.

Oh, damn, you just made me realize that the ending scene was probably a preview for the final arc in the LN's im guessing.

When I was watching it, I thought that this would be continued in the final arc of THIS season, which is called [Spoilers?](/s "Hitagi End") - That naming is so ominous that those were the vibes I got.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers:](/s "It is indeed continued in Hitagi End.")

> Ougi lit the fuse

It's probably worth noting that Ougi is written  which means "(folding) fan", and is the character used in the word  (aogu) meaning "to fan (the flames)" and can be interpreted as "to incite/instigate".

So yeah, the character's entire existence is basically to troll Araragi in the most -monogatari ways possible.

But yeah, this season of -monogatari has totally blown away everything that came before it. It's hard not to take this whole season as a big sweeping "fuck you" to moe harem nonsense when the most moe haremette of all retreats so far into her own victimization complex that she deludes herself into becoming a murderous snake god just because she doesn't "win".
>> ARTICLE
Whoah. The part about deconstructing moe harems is so spot on. 
>> ARTICLE
> Ougi's name

Good to know! Isin sure makes it hard to get full context on his stories in translation...

> This season versus harems

Isn't it great? I particularly like how Nadeko's conclusion that "it would be even more romantic if he was dead!" basically takes the "nobody will ever technically win" stasis of most harems to its "logical" conclusion.

> The fact that the snake represents undesirable parts of herself is even more apparent here than it was with Hanekawa 

Its strongly apparent that Sengoku and Hanekawa are two sides of the same coin: jealousy. While Hanekawa's rational personality saved her (and those around her) from self-immolating, Sengoku's naive personality only harbored and intensified her ignorance.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they reflect on each other really nicely. Nadeko just doesn't have enough *self* to really push back against her base desires, whereas Hanekawa certainly has problems, but is still a much more confident and fully realized person.
>> ARTICLE
Hanekawa is older, which I think contributes to that. She has more self awareness.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. I'd kinda guess Hanekawa's always been mature for her age (what with her lack of a real childhood and everything), but Nadeko's behavior is pretty understandable given how old she is.
>> ARTICLE

This episode pretty much reminded me of that [Pupa PV that came out a while ago...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWNY76Ajuo8)

That's why u gotta love Senjougahara
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this has to be almost my favourite arc in the entire Monogatari Series. I love it and I love how there's a shift in the *kind* of storytelling subtlety. I think what's missed when we're all looking at the amazing character development for Nadeko is the character development for Araragi, who is clearly a lot more intelligent in this arc than he's previously come off as being and that Nadeko gives him credit for. I think there's a lot more hidden in his actions, like when he's talking to Nadeko in the second episode of this arc and he says something along the lines of "I thought an apparition may have smoothtalked you into finding something for him"; and later after having left the room and returned he suddenly gets all pervy about sleeping in the same bed as Nadeko and is suddenly (and rather conveniently, for Shinobu, who can then let loose on Nadeko) knocked out by a Shinobu uppercut. Not only that but in this episode even 'Kuchinawa' assumes Araragi's being home when she's looking for the talisman to be a complete coincidence - which I think is clearly not the case. I think Araragi has a lot more planned out than we are supposed to think.

I also love the fact that Kuchinawa (prior to Nadeko yandere-mode) seems to *stop existing* whenever Araragi is present (the only time he actually seems to shut up). I think this says a lot about Nadeko's wish (which might not necessarily be to be loved by Araragi, but simply to be with him - which is why when he's there, she doesn't *need* Kuchinawa). I think there's also a lot of nice foreshadowing left to be addressed like [Nisemonogatari](/s "Nadeko's secret closet with the security lock that she says she'd "never forgive anyone, even [Araragi], for opening"")

And oh my god that 'preview' at the end! *So* much more than a preview, with the foreboding image of Senjyogahara being strung up and Araragi's broken body smashed inside the donations/wish box at the shrine. Not only that but Nadeko laments Kanbaru and Hanekawa not being there since they would make the "whole cast" present - she's not only missing the important characters she doesn't know (Hachikuji, the experts, etc) but also Karen and Tsukihi.

Geez, I thought I loved Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari. Enough to rate them 100/100. This season might, dare I say it, be even better. I always felt -monogatari were series best marathoned, or watched in full arcs, and I've been tempted to wait so I can watch a whole lot at once, but urgh I just need more... now...
>> ARTICLE
So I reread Otorimonogatari. Did anyone realize that in last episode they took out one of the best Araragi moment?[where araragi](/s "punches Tsukihi as hard as he could after she cuts nadeko's hair and proceeds to semi-rape her with Tsukihi enjoying it")
>> ARTICLE
Wait what? Do you think i can get a write up or a place to read that part? I am quite interested. 
>> ARTICLE
haha damn, that sounds like it woulda been hilarious
>> ARTICLE
Clarify that last part...
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "okay. So Araragi punches Tsukihi as hard as he could to the point that Tsukihi was bleeding from her mouth. Then Araragi gets on top of her and "does things that cannot be written in a book" to her. Whatever it is.")
>> ARTICLE
lol Does it really say that "cannot be etc..."?
>> ARTICLE
yup.
>> ARTICLE
Haha. Okay now I definitely need to go read the LN's soon.
>> ARTICLE
What chapter was that from? I'd like to read that passage. 
>> ARTICLE
its untranslated. It happens right after Tsukishi decides to cut Nadeko's hair
>> ARTICLE
Ah that's disappointing.  
>> ARTICLE
Whoa, NisiOisiN strikes again!
>> ARTICLE
Seriously I was looking forward to that :(
>> ARTICLE
Wut
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that ending preview was brutal. From what I understand we'll see the actual ending sometime much later in the series? I hope she doesn't actually end up killing everyone. Though I wouldn't entirely be surprised if we all got trolled and it ended up being a happy end.
>> ARTICLE
Isin doesn't seem to like happy endings though..

Anyways, yeah this story is gonna be continued in the final arc of this season. 
>> ARTICLE
I just want to point out a really interesting parallel I noticed.

Nisemonogatari is largely based on fakeness compared to realness. Oshino argued that a lie is as the truth, Kaiki that a lie was stronger, and the third person (sorry, forget her name) that truth was stronger.

Nadeko seems to be going through a situation much like this. The truth of the matter is that she was crazy, uselessly prayed to a god, and prayed at a godless shrine at that. Going by the truth of the matter, nothing should have happened.

Viewing the lie, on the other hand, shows a dormant god leading Nadeko on her journey to revive and ultimately become a god. Going by the lie, she just achieved her goals and become one of the strongest beings revealed so far.

Even more specifically, it's pointed out that what actually made this all possible is that she believed the lie. Because she believed in the dormant god she caused it to exist, to the point where Shinobu acknowledged it's existence near the end. 

Going by what we see so far, it's seeming like Kaiki's philosophy is winning out here. Given the unreliability of Nadeko as a narrator, and the current lack of a conclusion, we can't say for sure yet. However, it's something to think about and I hope to see explored a bit. 

This to me is something really cool and well crafted - the entire series still rings out thematically even when the focus is on other ideas. 

>> ARTICLE
On a completely unrelated note (thus the separate comment), I just want to say I really appreciate and value how well monogatari strays from cringe humor/moments. 

This episode and the previous one have had extremely high anxiety moments for Nadeko and it would be very easy to try to play for laughs by making her act anxious and awkward. I've always felt this was generally cheap storytelling and it always makes me feel too physically uncomfortable to watch. (It's why I can barely get through episodes of Welcome to the NHK, despite loving the concept.)

Seeing her anxiety and unease come off without resorting to just making everything cringe heavy is really nice. This episode in particular played in that high stress environment of her being caught red handed very believably and well. The way Nadeko had a hard time answering and fidgeted, especially her trying to hide behind something (Mr. Kuchinawa) really portrayed her anxiety without just having her stammer out some really awkward and uncomfortable excuse.
>> ARTICLE
Okey Okey.  
So last episode I sat there and thought: damn if Shinobu, Gahara or Araragi don't beat Nadeko up real good I'am gonna hate the ending to this arc. Now I sit here after seeing Nadeko make some Shinobu cheese and some inner Dialoque and I freaking dig it.  
  
DAMN YOU MONOGATARI you never fail to amaze me.

So who the hell is Ougi Oshino anyways? Is she actually related to Meme Oshino? Why did she help Nadeko? her eyes look like death to me.
>> ARTICLE
Well apparantly her names essentially means to fan the flames as noted up in other comments. So she's the one who has set all this in motion, and the second to last book is ougi dark so I would assume she ends up setting up the final conflict in the second to last book that will then be resolved at the end.

Shinobu referred to her as the "fake niece" or something, so presumably she's Something Else.

Just a small theory (anime-only viewer here who read Kizu)....

I think she may be Araragi's oddity. I always felt there was something that felt very wrong about Koyomi. As I watched Bakemonogatari, I always wondered what was the reason why Araragi helped everyone, and the backstory to this strange altruism of him. This is more or less thrown to your face early in Kizu: the scene where he meets Shinobu and the decition he makes. It was just abnormal. And I think that Ougi Oshino may be the other side of him.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to add on to that theory of yours (also an anime only viewer)

What if Araragi wants to help people so much that (assuming ougi is his apparition) his desires physically manifest themselves as ougi and she creates opportunities for Araragi to help others. 

Shinobu calls ougi the oshino's niece-wanabe because oshino was one of the first people to help Araragi out in his time of need
>> ARTICLE
If this is true... this might be the most amazing deconstruction of the harem-rom-com genre. (Think Toradora, Clannad, etc. where the main character selflessly helps other people)
>> ARTICLE
Eh? No dude. Bake is definitively not a harem nor a deconstruction. It's a just a really good character drama with a lot of comedy.

A harem deconstruction is already out there, and it's called School Days.

Toradora! and CLANNAD are not a harem either. To Love-Ru is a harem. Samurai Girls is a harem.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. That's from where I built my theory. I think Ouji sets up shit for Araragi to fix.

It also explains how Ouji knows stuff that only Araragi or Oshino should know (the Talisman's location). And how did Koyomi arrive to Sengoku's side when she found the talisman (coincidence my ass).

No, theres not any panning shots. Even if there was, the way they've done pans this season is weird.

Dont think theres any way to get a shot of them standing together right now. 
>> ARTICLE
:( This episode left a hole in me. I can't help but to feel sad for Nadeko, even if she is the cause of pretty much all of it. The characters all attacking her for her personality at times is also hard, especially with Shinobu pushing her over the edge, since I don't believe she intentionally does it to get others to like her. Some people are just that, extremely shy and have difficulties expressing themselves. Not how I wanted this to end for her. I hope she doesn't die in the end.

Great episode. Probably one of my favorites this season so far.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, i hope this gets resolved without anyone having to kill anyone else. If it hadn't been for Shinobu and Tsukihi tearing in to her, she MIGHT have been able to actually overcome this bit of insanity. Had Shinobu not jumped in the middle of things her and "Kyomi-oniichan" could have possibly sat down and laid it all out in the open, and maybe helped her on the way to acceptance, but NOOOOO. I get why they said what they said, but with someone that unstable, provocation is generally not the best idea.
>> ARTICLE
So I'm not really sure what's happening at this point. So I have a few questions...   
1. Are the LN's finished? The way it previews Nadeko as the "final boss" makes me think that is the end of the series altogether. But I thought they were still making novels?  
2. If that wasn't showing the end of the LN, will the next episode be a huge timeskip to 6 months later, or will the next arcs take place in between the six months.
>> ARTICLE
Next arc occurs during the Hanekawa arc at the beginning of the season, back in the beginning of school. 
>> ARTICLE
I believe there are two more books forthcoming, and that will be the end of it.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. We can assume the last books are gonna make up the third season.

So the final season of the show will probably be made up of:

Tsukimonogatari

Koyomimonogatari

Owarimonogatari (volume 1 & 2)

Zokuowarimonogatari

I'm gonna make a guess and say Hanamonogatari is gonna be S2's special like Neko:Kuro was S1's special. And Kizu will probably be out before S3.
>> ARTICLE
> Are the LN's finished? The way it previews Nadeko as the "final boss" makes me think that is the end of the series altogether. But I thought they were still making novels?

Yeah the LNs are gonna be done with this year, but there still are there are more books which are gonna be adapted into the third season which will be the last season. The Nadeko thing is really just the end of the second series. There's still the third, final series.

> If that wasn't showing the end of the LN, will the next episode be a huge timeskip to 6 months later, or will the next arcs take place in between the six months.

The next arc is Onimonogatari with the story Shinobu Time. It takes place directly after Kabukimonogatari and during Nekomonogatari:Shiro and tells the story of why Araragi was missing during the whole Black Hanekawa and Kako fiasco.

Nadeko looks pretty damn cute with white hair.

This arc really pulled a number on me and taught me to never take the cute little imouto character at face value ever again.

I'm not even 100% sure I like where they took her character, but it certainly all fits together neatly and it's not forced. It just leaves me with a sick, cynical feeling. This is the first time Araragi failed to save a girl (though technically it was always down to her to save herself).
>> ARTICLE
>  This is the first time Araragi failed to save a girl (though technically it was always down to her to save herself).

Second* time he failed to help a girl to save herself.

First time around was Hanekawa in Neko:Kuro.

It sort of comes full circle after he ices the Hystery Tiger though.

Kinda. He still failed the first time around. 
>> ARTICLE
So was that trailer at the end for Koimonogatari (the last arc of th season) or is that an entirely different ordeal. Is that trailer even from a book?
>> ARTICLE
I was hoping that araragi wouldve called nadeko a name or something when she kept her hair bit shinobu in his house :o
>> ARTICLE
i do hope the after-credits sequence was just a comedic mock-up and not the real deal since its cheezyness was on-par with 60s movie/tarantino trailers.

this episode was heavily nadeko focused which was rather odd since she didn't really care for reasons in the end regardless. she's inferior to yuno because there is no passion in her whatsoever. that spark she had during the classroom scene vanished and her monologue ended up vapid and snobish rather than refined and broken hearted.. at least, she didn't sound phased by her actions at all and just served the lines about Koyomi as if she never cared about any of this at all.

betting on hitagi to patch things up turned out to be true but i was expecting a direct intervention rather than postponing the finalle. rather frustrating narrative choice to cut off a resolution simply by having the insane villain be reasonable - despite spending half an episode detailing the fact she isn't nor does she care to be.

how was Koyomi still alive since she basically ripped his heart out and he bled to death? which part of his vampire makeup is responsible for such a thing considering Shinobu mentioned his half-body slice from Neko:Kuro was fatal without her aid? what was Gaen even doing by having Shuraragi-san hold onto that snake-god talisman? why would he show up with loli-shinobu knowing exactly who they were dealing with anyway? once Nadeko stabbed Rararagi all over at his house.. why wouldn't she take care of him right there instead of having the story cut to the present immediately? how could Hitagi kill anyone above human level?(i guess she could invent an even greater oddity or smth..)

i was honestly rather disappointed by this last episode and reading from others that it'll be resumed later while covering something else entirely till then only makes it worse. really hoping they'll make up for it by giving Hitagi more practicality, i might be a little biased but her role *made* the Neko:Shiro arc. Kanbaru's yet to have anything to do with what goes on other than one token appearance.


>> ARTICLE
> Kanbaru's yet to have anything to do with what goes on other than one token appearance.

~~Yeah she's not gonna be in this season at all.~~ EDIT: I forgot Hanamonogatari is gonna be a TV special.

> how was Koyomi still alive since she basically ripped his heart out and he bled to death? which part of his vampire makeup is responsible for such a thing considering Shinobu mentioned his half-body slice from Neko:Kuro was fatal without her aid? 

Snake poison is super effective against vampires (Shinobu herself says this). It slowed his healing ability down, almost nullifying it. It was bearly enough to keep him alive though. Also don't forget Yozuru bursted his heart as well in Nisemonogatari. It seems that destroying his heart isn't enough to kill him. 

As for the Neko:Kuro deal, some context [Kizu spoilers](/s "Vampires can only be killed when all of their limbs are taken from them.") It's probably because he had half of his limbs separated from him in Neko:Kuro + the fact that he was slightly more human than vampire at the time, that left him on the verge of death.

> why would he show up with loli-shinobu knowing exactly who they were dealing with anyway?

Shinobu assumed she'd be fast enough to go pull the ofuda out of Nadeko's mouth the first time. I'm not sure about the second time around. I'm gonna go with Araragi just thinking he could probably solve the issue with words again.

> how could Hitagi kill anyone above human level?

As far as I know, she really can't. She's just a human. She uses fear tactics and manipulation really effectively though.

> i do hope the after-credits sequence was just a comedic mock-up and not the real deal since its cheezyness was on-par with 60s movie/tarantino trailers.

For the most part, it was just Nadeko's idea of how she wanted it to go down. She has thing for [Spoilers](/s "80s style manga") so maybe that's where that cheesiness came from.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I started the series way too earlier and now I've already caught up after a week. I can't handle waiting a week for each episode

Dont understand the point of senjougahara telling nadeko the order in which to kill all of them; and this whole episode was just one giant monologue from Nadeko. And what's with all these apparitions being made-up completely from people's mind and sub-conscious feelings and crap.

Dam Nadeko slaughtered shinbou, koyomi, and senjougahara.

Bitch went fucking insane; and for the next episode I'm not sure if it's going to be continued or the next arc starts cause i dont know.
>> ARTICLE
 love her nonchalantly pointing out that if Araragi died while she was alive, she will bring down hell on everyone. Oh Senjougahara you are great. 

I guess she's trying to buy them some time but wonder if anything can defeat Nadeko at this point. 

Also lol at that "preview" 
>> ARTICLE
> Dont understand the point of senjougahara telling nadeko the order in which to kill all of them; 

Stalling mostly, also it is important as we learned in Kabuki. If Muraragi-san dies first, Shinobu will turn Kiss-shot and kill everyone  or Gahara will go fucking crazy and kill everyone. 

> And what's with all these apparitions being made-up completely from people's mind and sub-conscious feelings and crap.

That's what they are........

Next arc, Onimonogatari. This story will be continued in the final arc, Koimonogatari.

They don't count the recap episodes as *actual* episodes in their episode numbering.  Confusing as fuck.  I keep re-downloading the same episodes.

If you haven't noticed, they've been doing that since the start of the series. Including the recaps wouldn't even yield the correct numbering, because it should be per arc.

They almost always do that.

(Also Commie is pretty shit, lol)

That's really stupid.

It isn't really. I'm pretty sure no fansubbers are doing the recap episodes (commie themselves definitely aren't) so it kinda makes more sense to do it this way, so people don't get confused and think they missed an episode at the start of each new arc.
>> ARTICLE

I got confused cause horriblesubs have a different numbering, and I usually just download the first release, sometimes its commie, sometimes it horriblesubs...

I missed 2 episodes cause of different numbering :<

>I'm pretty sure no fansubbers are doing the recap episodes

HorribleSubs did 06 but not 11. The only one who did 11 is Leopard-Raws.

(afaik)
>> ARTICLE
HorribleSubs ain't an actual fansub group, you know. 

Anyways, it's against the rules to discuss fansubs. 
>> ARTICLE
Just linking, unofficial streams, or any implications thereof is against the rules -- people talk about the specific fansub groups quite a bit actually (mostly negative or nitpicky stuff).
>> ARTICLE
> Do not link to/**mention** torrents or unofficial streams/downloads

Rules are on the sidebar, if you haven't noticed. 
>> ARTICLE
It is understood that people will talk about fansubs. It's implicit in many episode discussion threads that happen at time of airing because those shows were not picked up for legal streaming/distribution. These threads are often participated in by mods.

Discussing fansubs and groups is fine. Linking to content or directing people to it is not. The whole point of the rule is to safeguard reddit (and in turn, the subreddit) from any legal repercussions. Discussing illegal content does not leave the site culpable. Linking directly to illegal content does.

Talking about <Fansub group X> is fine. Pointing people towards where they can <Fansub group X>'s content is not. If you want to interpret the rules to be that cut and dry, you should remove the MAL link in your flair, never advocate it to other users, and never mention the site again. Curtailing the simple acknowledgement that fansubs and fansubbing groups exist (and are used) does not fall within the remit of of the rules.
>> ARTICLE
It really is. Because the episodes have their official numbers, even if they chose to skip the recaps, they shouldn't have renumbered the episodes, it only confuses people more.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's even more stupid for the recap episodes not to be considered "Episode 5.5" and "Episode 9.5" and so on. Since they have an official (stupid) numbering though, fansubbers probably shouldn't be using their own confusing numbering, even if it makes more sense.
>> ARTICLE
In what way is the official numbering stupid? An episode is an episode regardless if it's a recap.
>> ARTICLE
What was it this time?
>> ARTICLE
Okay I will be the first to admit that Nadeko Medusa went over my head the first time I watched it. Monogatari seems to do that to me, I don't know if I'm alone here, but the banter and visuals distract me from what they are actually saying so I end up missing parts only to find them later on rewatches. The first time I saw Medusa I was of course mad at snake, but I was mad that she didn't tell Araragi about the odditiy and ended up making a mess of things. It wasn't until later rewatches and discussion that I finally got what was going on, not because it was deep but because I wasn't paying proper attention.   
  
So in-case someone out there is in the same boat I was I will post this summary of Nadeko.  
  
All of snake's problems were directly caused by her.   
She mistrusted everyone and was asocial so she pretended to be meek and shy as to avoid everyone. When people asked her for help or to do something she would always agree because that led to the least interaction with them, if she said yes they would go away. She would never do what she promised though but instead just act cute and shy when confronted to get people to forgive her.   
She then started cultivating a victim complex, how all these people are asking so much of poor Nadeko and everyone is trying to get her to do impossible tasks. The tasks are only impossible because she procrastinates and does not do them until it's really impossible to fix anything and then she blames other people for trying to get her to do it.   
  
The whole mess in otori was caused because she was pushed into a corner. Ougi told her that she needed to bring back the snake god if she wanted her prayers of her and Araragi of being together to not be in vain. She had been going to pray at the snake shrine for this to happen ever since she saw Araragi and Senjougahara together. After she fabricated the delusion to trick herself as to why's shes doing it and managed to get the talisman she was apprehended.   
I'm sure the plan was not to eat the talisman from the start, it was to bring back the god and then get him to return the favor. However she had no choice with Araragi right there except to give up everything or to eat it herself.  
  
She realized after she ate it that she couldn't go through with her original plan anyways because Araragi was aware of everything now and she couldn't trick him. Just like monkey was faced with Hitagi at the end of Suruga Monkey she could see that her wish could never be realized. Unlike monkey though she decided to not accept that and instead lash out against Araragi and run away.
>> ARTICLE
Good summary, I grasped most of this when I first watched it, but had a hard time putting it into words :P

I think Nadeko Medusa is probably the arc that makes the biggest case for kaii being figments of the victims' imaginations. Kuchinawa shares a lot of the same mannerisms as Nadeko, and when you look at it that way, it's Nadeko that's influencing Kuchinawa and not the other way around. Also, she could easily have blamed all her problems on Kuchinawa and gotten rid of him like most of the other characters did with their kaii (which seems like a metaphor for overcoming your own flaws and growing as a person), but she chose to default to the same self-destructive behaviour as usual, which is why it ended as it did.

I'm almost convinced of the interpretation of kaii as not being real, because despite their obvious supernatural effects (which could just be narrator embellishment), they all reflect their victims' personalities a little too closely for it to be a coincidence. On top of that, I remember Kaiki saying something about kaii only existing for people with strong imaginations who believe in them.

Just my 100 yen's worth :P
>> ARTICLE
So it's said outright in the show that the Kuchinawa that exists is purely brought there by Nadeko and her expectations. In fact it doesn't really exist as a separate entity, it's really a part of Nadeko.  
  
As for blaming the problems on the kaii and getting rid of them is not how this works. The kaii are a part of the people who summon or invoke them. The only way to get rid of them is to accept them as a part of you and fix and control them.
Nadeko finally realized that it was all her problems but instead of trying to fix it she just decided to accept being the terrible person she was.  
   
I also like the theory that kaii don't really exist and it's just a metaphor for the problems people face. Hitagi having anorexia, Kanbaru having depression and self-harm being hidden by her bandage and of course Hanekawa's dissociative identity disorder.  
  
And as to snake. Her problem was with a lack of empathy with other people as well as feeling worthless. Her fake social life was destroyed and her future with araragi was looking grim.  
The way they talk about godhood in Monogatari it always reminded me of suicide, a theme very prevalent in monogatari anyways. I view Nadeko's escape to the temple to be a god away from everyone  to be just that. Add that in with her desire to take a bunch of people down with her and you got yourself an allegory for Columbine, or any other such event.  
Snake is basically a school shooter.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with the theory that the kaii don't really exist is that you run into issues like in Tsukihi Phoenix when we get a huge hole in the from of the Araragi house thanks to someone trying to deal with Tsukihi. She also heals her scars completely. I can see Hanekawa attacking people and burning things down with a different identity, but it doesn't explain other things.

It's outright stated that the kaii stem from a person (although I don't see how that explains Shinobu), but that doesn't mean they don't exist. Plus, how do you explain Mayoi Jiangshi. Was it all in his head? Why? Then, there's Araragi and Shinobu.

It's one thing to think of the stories as metaphors, but within the context of the world of Monogatari, I think at least some of the kaii have to exist.
>> ARTICLE
Wow this is an old comment.  
The way I see kaii is it's really up to the viewer's interpertation as to what they really are. Are they real things with real effects like the phoenix and doll that leveled part of the house? Or is it metaphor and exaggeration like Araragi's fight with Karen? I like that it's ambiguous and some things are clearly exaggerated so the validity of everything is called into question. How much is real and how much of it is Araragi's exaggeration and imagination is up to you. I think of it as both, a fantastic supernatural story and just everyday lives of ordinary people. What it really is is up to you.  

EDIT: also believing Mayoi Jiangshi to be all a figment of Araragi's imagination actually makes it more explainable. 
>> ARTICLE
How would you explain Kizu? Araragi nearly died. Did he just get attacked? If so, why didn't he spend any time in the hospital? There's some pretty clear real-world effects, like the healing of Tsukihi and Araragi, along with the burning down of Hanekawa's house and the old cram school. The house pretty clearly happened, but that could just be one of Hanekawa's identities, but it's a bit harder for her to burn down a cram school that isn't all wood in a night.

Oh, the Kizu LN is being officially released in English in a few weeks.
>> ARTICLE
Like I said it's up to you how literally you take this. Also I think it varies wildly from story to story.
>> ARTICLE
For certain things, like Nadeko's or Hitagi's crab, it's easy to think of them as a metaphor, but it's a lot harder for some of the other arcs.

So if anyone is still here I want to first apologize for last week.  
I forgot to post the thread on Wednesday and did not remember about it until late Thursday. From there there was a dilemma of posting it that week late or just having the next arc discussion along with that weeks discussion next week.  
   
A few people messaged me about it and after discussion it with them I decided to just combine the discussions this week. I thought this would be best as people expect these to come up at a certain time and if they are too late they might be missed altogether.  
  
Sorry for any inconvenience. I do intend to get through the entire series and don't intend on stopping these. With that in mind if I am ever an hour or more late I think it would be fine if someone else posted the thread that week. If you don't have RES for the source feature the post does not have to be as detailed as the OP. I think it would be best for organizational purposes if one person did this but I think missing it by too much would be worse.

So first up is Mayoi Jiangshi. Personally I'm not a big fan of this arc, for much of the same reasons I don't like Tsubasa Family. The cast is quite small and in terms of character development and story progression there is not much there. I don't know if you could say monogatari is pandering, all of it seems to be pandering in some way or another, but this arc would be the heaviest. Loli Hanekawa, shota Araragi, multiple Shinobu forms and costumes and adult snail. We get too see all of that but behind it not too much substance.  
It doesn't help that the most focused character is Shinobu but a lot of the content was cut from the adaptation so we don't even get to see that interaction as well as we should.

What content was cut?

I flipped my shit when I realized Kaiki was the narrator. I thought insane Nadeko was an unreliable narrator, how about a narrator who constantly tells us how much he could be lying to us? I really loved the scene with Kaiki and Senjougahara in the cafe (those colors!). I also loved how they did the scene of Kaiki in the bathroom, weighing the reasons he could possibly have for helping Senjougahara, posing arguments that would convince any moral person decide to help to his greedy conscience and having the conscience immediately deflect them was cool to see. Additionally, I loved when Kaiki came in with the Oshino Hawaiian shirt. Finally I really loved Kaiki's reaction to Senjougahara's offer of her own body.

> I thought insane Nadeko was an unreliable narrator,  how about a narrator who constantly tells us how much he could be lying to us?

It's so great because he's a paradoxical narrator that complete fits his character. If he's lying to the audience, but is known to be a liar. He could be lying about lying, thus telling the truth. But, being a liar, these truths are lies (insert infinite loop here).

Love him as the narrator. I can't get enough of his voice. There's just something about it.

That monologue at the end where he had to think of a good reason to help them...it was perfect.

Kaiki best Monogatari
>> ARTICLE
Or are you just being tsundere there?
>> ARTICLE
B-Baka, it's not like I also like the other Monogatari or anything ...

But yea, Kaiki is truly the best. I'm only used to be Tsundere with Mayoi
>> ARTICLE
One last arc, with an apparent emphasis on two of the shows most charismatic characters - Senjougahara and Kaiki. Well, if you count whatever Kaiki has as charisma. Maybe enigmatic, then? Though hes actually fairly straightforward - in fact, it seems he makes a point of being the *most* straightforward in terms of goals and values. Compelling, then? Ill go with compelling.

Anyway. If it were necessary to put up a brave face, Id have plenty of material to work off of. Strong chosen characters. The fact that this arc is being given so many episodes. The fact that this is the *last* arc, considering how well Monogatari tends to finish its stories and seasons. The optimistic comments Ive heard from people familiar with the source material. The fact that were now dealing with a problem that Isin has personally established as the end boss (even though that automatically means hes going to screw with that expectation in some fundamental way). 

But the thing is, theres no need for any of that - I think Monogatari Season 2 is far and away the best set of stories and episodes this show has ever constructed. Its always been distinctive, creative, and uncompromising, but I dont think its various elements have ever come together to make such compelling and well-articulated stories. There have been moments, certainly - Kanbarus arc in the first season, a great deal of Senjougahara and Hanekawas material throughout, Kaikis show-stealing in Nise. And its played with very interesting concepts throughout, as well, as Ive [talked about](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/04/14/nisemonogatari-and-the-nature-of-fanservice/) at [length for](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/07/03/blood-ties-and-nekomonogatari/) close to [a year now](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/04/20/bakemonogatari-episodes-9-and-10-2/). But the comparison of S1 to S2 feels like the difference between a creative, passionate apprentice and a confident, practiced craftsman.

So yeah, courtesy of last weeks final push, Monogatari is now really Up There for me. Heres to finishing strong.

**Episode 21**

0:07 - [Aw man. Kaikis music. Kaikis philosophy.](http://i.imgur.com/Bjx1jM3.jpg) This gon be good

0:16 - [Kaiki announces Monogatari likes unreliable narrators](http://i.imgur.com/UHf3YbU.jpg). This seems like an appropriate story to end on

0:22 - [Nice shot.](http://i.imgur.com/x18MhTC.jpg) Kaiki himself seems to live in the grayscale world of deception. No rainbow clouds here

0:29 - [Kaiki you are going to make this difficult](http://i.imgur.com/Cs2xGo1.jpg). If every one of your lines is cute enough to be comment-worthy, Im never gonna finish this

0:45 - [Senjougahara/Araragi love story, narrated by Kaiki.](http://i.imgur.com/gRLIVNA.jpg) If this isnt fanservice, I dont know what is

1:35 - [So heres the first image which could actually be a lie](http://i.imgur.com/HcDVhwA.jpg). I already trust little enough in this show, whyd you have to go and *say* this entire narrative was gonna be fabricated?

1:39 - [Kaiki a cute](http://i.imgur.com/CighU9A.jpg)

2:34 - [This is his excited to hear from an old friend expression](http://i.imgur.com/uv7EjPi.jpg)

2:40 - [This is Kaiki being tsundere](http://i.imgur.com/UDwd5EP.jpg). Nice background, too. Another of the shows very frequent mirrored shots, whose internal synchronicity kind of play to the unreality of everything in this world

3:52 - [So of course, instead of admitting he lied, he is forced to make that lie match reality](http://i.imgur.com/Add758r.jpg)

4:01 - [I knew this arc would be great.](http://i.imgur.com/6K6Zth0.jpg) So much silly Kaikiservice

4:47 - [Okinawa colors!](http://i.imgur.com/v6lBueW.jpg)

5:27 - [Airport is also Okinawa colors!](http://i.imgur.com/MURCZ89.jpg) This conversation is also fantastic. A war of deadpans has just begun

6:18 - [God-fucking-damnit, Senjougahara](http://i.imgur.com/nZzhEsU.jpg)

6:43 - [This is the best episode](http://i.imgur.com/yQKPKda.jpg)

6:58 - [Sure, lets get one of each of them.](http://i.imgur.com/AxS1uAn.jpg) This fuckin show

8:39 - [This arc is off to a roaring start.](http://i.imgur.com/h86p3Es.jpg) Its kind of hard for a scene with *either* of these characters to not be compelling, and they play off each other perfectly

8:47 - [Her actual name? Looks like shes earned his attention](http://i.imgur.com/kIEcrrD.jpg)

9:29 - [Both of them have so much respect for this story structure](http://i.imgur.com/PSKUUMS.jpg)

9:55 - [Hell, he might do it just because of how proud this makes him](http://i.imgur.com/IkzswjE.jpg). He seems to like his philosophy even more than he likes money

11:04 - [Goddamnit,](http://i.imgur.com/osEtQyQ.jpg) I knew I [recognized that voice](http://myanimelist.net/character/91721/Aikurou_Mikisugi)

14:05 - [Thats a tremendous amount of honesty for Kaiki!](http://i.imgur.com/JrOKaKE.jpg)

14:43 - [She cant play his game.](http://i.imgur.com/4rWPmXV.jpg) Senjougahara is used to warping or hiding her feelings, but hes directly provoking her, and his self-mastery is on an entirely different level

15:04 - [A little salt for that wound.](http://i.imgur.com/fwVHyVI.jpg) This is all kind of rich coming from Kaiki, too - few people would call his scamming middle schoolers for chump change and some kind of imagined philosophical victory anything resembling mature

15:22 - [Yep. Real mature](http://i.imgur.com/lkT8qv7.jpg)

16:07 - [Does this fit into his standard motivation, or is there really something more to him?](http://i.imgur.com/qONGGMy.jpg) I wonder how it would feel to say something you once said to someone again. It seems to somewhat fit with his legitimize the lie philosophy, but its not a clean fit

16:09 - [And the color scheme changes back.](http://i.imgur.com/QeLHgc1.jpg) Looks like we might be through the woods!

16:26 - [Im kinda surprised this wasnt the first angle she took.](http://i.imgur.com/sUyF4Fk.jpg) Kaiki clearly has a lot more pride than he does sympathy

16:50 - [Were all very impressed, Kaiki](http://i.imgur.com/aXj2LZy.jpg)

17:12 - [Now you know hes ready to barter](http://i.imgur.com/FtcMzPo.jpg)

18:49 - [This is Kaikis kind of advanced payment.](http://i.imgur.com/FJpOFCl.jpg) Ill take that fee in pure suffering, please

19:13 - [Youre terrorizing damaged people, Kaiki.](http://i.imgur.com/zCPzDaD.jpg) What did you expect?

Man, hes such a great character. Were getting some excellent villains this season

19:25 - [What a hassle these stories are](http://i.imgur.com/svcnOoq.jpg)

19:57 - [This is pretty fantastic.](http://i.imgur.com/jRzpANy.jpg) Its like he really does want to do it, and so now must search for a reason to do it that would be allowable according to his moral code

21:09 - [Man, it is just super-hard to justify being a good person!](http://i.imgur.com/95DbTuY.jpg)

21:26 - [Oh god, the spotlight of honest reflection has found even Kaiki.](http://i.imgur.com/eu3Jbms.jpg) Hes screwed now!

22:38 - [And after all that, he has to invent his own goddamn reason to justify it](http://i.imgur.com/Rs4pYiU.jpg)

**And Done**

Goddamn Kaiki, it is good to see you again. The reality of an arc from Kaikis perspective certainly didnt disappoint - his monologue is hilariously true to his personality, while also revealing how well his love of deception translates to a love of the artifice of storytelling. For me, this was likely the funniest episode this show has ever had - something about the childishness of Kaiki and Senjougahara playing their little deadpan brinkmanship game, and the way their attempted seriousness only made them look more and more ridiculous, was just endlessly funny to me. I also liked seeing Senjougahara attempt to battle Kaiki on his own terms, and loved that soliloquy at the end - its just like Isin to spotlight a principled villain wrestling with their own non-ideals in order to justify an honorable action. Looking forward to seeing Kaiki wear a heros mantle about as well as he wears that Hawaiian shirt.

I'm not sure if there's a specific meaning to each of the particular styles, but they do correlate with the room's overall shifts in color scheme, which I took to be indicative of the three phases of their conversation - the introduction and initial sparring, the middle phase where Senjougahara is forced to honestly explain the situation and beg Kaiki for help, and then the period after Kaiki's interest is piqued, when he's basically going through the motions of being his usual self but is already inclined to help them.

How those phases correlate to those particular silly glasses, I can't possibly guess.
>> ARTICLE
The thing that I really love about what monogatari's been doing is how subtly it's been sneaking continuity up on us.  Like before stories have been generally pretty self-contained, and don't affect anything until we revisit that arc's character again.  But the story has been subtly introducing these wildcard elements one by one - why is Araragi chatting with some character like she's an old friend when we've never met her before?  WTF is Gaen up to?  And now Nadeko wants to kill everybody within a couple of months!?!  And Araragi is actually getting character development and plotting against Ougi now!

Like normally it's pretty easy to recognize authors telegraphing their transitions to Big Plot Time, but this whole thing has been building up speed wonderfully sneakily.  Everything feels like it's coming to a head, even though we're still maintaining the same story arc structure we have the whole series and we have no idea really what it's building *towards*.

More specifically to this arc, it's another nice example of why Senjougahara is Araragi's girlfriend over any of the others.  Hanekawa didn't go out trying to find Oshino on her own, Gahara *sent* her out.  Now Gahara's seeking help from someone she deeply dislikes to rescue Araragi, and would make any sacrifice necessary to do it.

Senjougahara's the only girl who ended up rescuing *herself* from her oddity.  And she's the girl who's seeking to save Araragi without having to be asked or worrying what anyone else thinks.  As attractive as Araragi finds Hanekawa (or even pre-god-Nadeko) he's never going to *respect* them, because they wait around hoping for someone else to rescue them.  

It's kind of a surprising motivation for what is more or less a harem anime, but a good one.
>> ARTICLE
That's a good distinction you draw about Senjougahara. I think the key difference with her is related to the fundamental conflict of virtually all Monogatari stories - her ability to frankly admit and deal with the truth. Most conflict in Monogatari stems from a character wishing to project a personal/internal conflict/failing onto an exterior antagonist, but Senjougahara has always been remarkably and almost frighteningly honest, and has even pushed herself to greater honesty throughout the seasons. And so she's the one who can clearly assess the situation, dictate what needs to be done, and accept any cost or personal sacrifice necessary to achieve a resolution.

I also agree on how wonderfully the show's building up these larger conflicts - the way these last few arcs have danced around in continuity has lent even more mystery to the motives of Gaen and Ougi, and made it seem like we're slowly circling towards the conflict that all these other arcs are orbiting.

Kaiki is just the best narrator we've had yet. I loved him as the narrator in the book and in the anime it's just 10x better. I got a good feeling I'm really gonna like how Shaft is gonna do this arc. They've only let me down with Kabuki, honestly, lets hope this 'end' makes up for it!

We got a nice strong use of colors this episode, which I loved. More of that pls!


>> ARTICLE
I might have forgotten why Kabuki let you down. Would you mind linking to your past comment about why it wasn't up to standards or something?
>> ARTICLE
Actually I hadn't commented on the fact before but I'll tell you why it let me down.

One word: pacing. It sucks that Shaft couldn't really handle this 2-cour season so well and it sucks even more that they had to give almost all arcs only 4 episodes when they could've had 5 each (I do understand that the workload would have been crazy and the quality of the episodes themselves would have probably dropped), though it would have worked out much smoother especially in the case of Kabuki. Kabukimonogatari is the longest book, (as in the longest single story of an arc) and to see it just rushed the way it was in the end, it just really sucked. They still managed to capture the comical and emotional essences but the whole info dump at times was just awful. I mean I wasn't outright disappointed, the whole story was still good, but it just felt like they were trying to hurry up and finish it and get to the next arc the whole time. 
>> ARTICLE
I see. I guess it sucks in comparison, but since I haven't read the novels, it was still pretty good for me.

I intend to pick up the light novels some time soon. But while you're at it, could you recommend some other good light novels that you have read? You seem like you've read lots of books, and I've been looking for some stuff to read to improve my Japanese a bit. I think I can trust your judgement.

The episode harkens back to perspectives. From Kaiki's perspective Araragi/Gahara and friends are just kids to him. Really gives some context as to the silly mask Gahara was wearing.

Also, I would like it if someone could count how many times the designs of Kaiki's shirt and Gahara's mask changed throughout this episode!

> [Kaiki best girl.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1mw51b/which_anime_harem_would_you_like_to_have_irl/ccd5xhk)

[Was confirmed in truth by this line.](http://i.imgur.com/OedjjwU.png)

That mirror scene. Was fantastic. I loved the way we got him logically reasoning out all his options, even though his personality/motivations were already established in Karen Bee, we got to see what he truly cares about: ~~Gaen Izuko~~ Suruga's mother.

He doesn't give a fuck about everyone else, but when something is even slightly indirectly linked to Gaen, he will essentially "manipulate" his own logical factors to result in [his answer](http://i.imgur.com/OM6DnNB.png).
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting that he even considered Hitagi's request. Was his reasoning with himself a hidden desire to help Hitagi (may or may not be out of empathy), or was it his money-minded self weighing the odds that he'd get something out of the request?

Either way, it is interesting that despite his beliefs, there was something he held in higher regard than making money. So much so that he'd say yes in the face of overwhelming loss.
>> ARTICLE
No, it's not Gaen Izuko, but another Gaen...

Stinks that Hana was delayed.
>> ARTICLE
> Come to think of it, that town is where she is.

> The niece of Gaen-senpai...

> In other words, the daughter...

> ...with which to remember Gaen-senpai's older sister Toue Gaen, lives there. 

So, I take it Gaen-Senpai refers to Izuko. He is basically saying he wants to help Kanbaru because she resembles Toue as she is Toue's daughter?
>> ARTICLE
You'll see in Hana, but yes, it has to do with Toue, Kanbaru's mother.

>> ARTICLE
That's because they really are kids. Araragi, Senjougahara and Hanekawa haven't graduated high school yet. At best they'd be 17-18. Everyone else is younger than the rest of them, so they're essentially a group of kids forced into an extraordinary situation. 

Hanekawa may be the most "mature" of them all, but even then she still had room to grow (see: Neko Kuro).
>> ARTICLE
Also in Japan you aren't considered an adult until age 20.
>> ARTICLE
He's not saying they're actually kids, he's talking about Kaiki's perspective of them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't mean they're physically kids, but that they are mentally kids/young adults. So far we've seen everything from their perspective, which sort of makes them seem grown up, mature, etc. But that's just how people are, they see themselves as something more than what they really are usually. 

They're kids in that all the actions they take, everything they think about still revolves around their little world/bubble, essentially. They don't think about the big picture very much, and don't truly understand the way the world works. 

Just in this episode Senjougahara thought she could ask Kaiki to do it for less than what the job was worth in money, or guilt him into accepting the job because of his previous actions, but that's not the way the world works. 
>> ARTICLE
Just for anyone who wanted to know about ages. [Araragi is the only expressly confirmed age in the anime. 18](http://myanimelist.net/character/22036/Koyomi_Araragi).

It is possible to work out the age of the other characters from this: Hanekawa and Gahara are in the same year as him, Kanbaru is one year below.

In the last ep of Nisemonogatari, when talking about the birth of Tsukihi, he says: 

> For the first three years of my life, I was an only child.

> And the year after that, I only had one sister.

> I was four before I finally became your brother.

Which means Karen is 14 or 15. Tsukihi is 12 or 13. 

Nadeko is friends (and in the same year, or heavily implied) as Tsukihi, who she refers to as "Rara-chan".
>> ARTICLE
To Elaborate:

The main characters in Monogatari have extremely narrow world-views and are flawed individuals, so yes even though some of them have come of age, they would essentially be "kids" in the perspective of someone who is far more experienced and has a jaded view of the world.

I really wonder what Shinobu's view on everything is. Are these events just something to pass the time for her? Do the main characters seem laughably naive to her?

I'm so glad there's no recap this week. We got to see the fully glory of Senjougahara and Kaiki. I thought maybe Senjougahara could trick him into going along with it by playing his ego, but the way he reasoned with every reason in the bathroom was so well-done. It essentially came down to his desire to meet with Kanbaru to get to Gaen. Though, surely, if everyone had a gazillion dollars he would take the job.

So far from what we've seen of the anime, do we know why he's so interested in Gaen? I know we know they were previously in school together, and she's the senpai of Oshino Meme, Yozuru Kagenui and Kaiki, but beyond that was there anything else established about their relationship? Please remember to put LN spoilers in spoiler tags, as I know many have not read the LNs, and neither have I. 
>> ARTICLE
Anime-Only here.

I figured out [from this quote in the episode](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1ramcx/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cdlc0vw) that it appears he may have some link to Kanbaru's mother. He says Kanbaru is a "way to remember Toue".

Yeah, about LN stuff, it would be nice if people didn't imply things like that without spoiler tags, as the vast majority will not have had a chance to read them.
>> ARTICLE
Kanbaru doesn't live with her parents, right? She lives with her grandma (or grandparents?)? Do we know if there's a reason behind this? Or maybe I'm remembering incorrectly.

From the quote you linked to, it seems Kanbaru's mom is a hot commodity. Gaen and Kaiki both have interest in her daughter, Kanbaru, but we as viewers barely know anything about her mom. I want to assume that perhaps Kaiki was somehow romantically involved with her, but it seems like that would be too shallow for such a deep and complex character as Kaiki. I assume Gaen has her reasons too, beyond just familial relationships (since she wanted Araragi to introduce her to Kanbaru without mentioning that they're related).
>> ARTICLE
We already know from Bake that Kanbaru's mom is dead.

And I'm not sure, but I think that Gaen didn't want to be introduced as Kanbaru's aunt to avoid any potential drama.

I was prepared to come here and write something about the tragic implications of this season, and how those implications could foreshadow further tragedy during this arc.

But I've changed my mind. This episode was way to much fun for that. I mean, Senjougahara was wearing a fake nose and mustache. It's just fantastic. 

Anyway, I loved this episode. I didn't expect Kaiki to be the narrator, but I love that he is. Though I can't imagine who could have been a more unreliable narrator than Nadeko, but Kaiki is it. The fun thing about Kaiki though, is that his deceptions are completely voluntary. Unlike other unreliable narrators who don't understand the situation, Kaiki is simply a liar. It's taking that familiar story telling element, and kind of turning it on it's head. Now I expect instead of the audience not being informed because the narrator isn't informed, the audience won't be informed simply because the narrator is lying to us. Should make for some fun deceptive moments as the arc goes on. 

Senjougahara and Kaiki's personalities play off of each other perfectly. With her outright assertiveness, and intellect, and his melancholy prose of situations, and deceptiveness their pairing works extremely well. I can't wait to see how this all evolves as the arc continues. 

As an aside, I love how colorful the episodes have been as of late. I'll need to go back and look, but I feel like the episodes at the beginning of this season were darker, and as the season has gone on the settings have gotten more and more colorful.

Which I find quite funny as the series is probably at it's darkest point overall, y'know, with a yandere snake god planning to kill the three main characters and all. 

>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's true. I love how contrary it is. It's not just the color scheme either, everything is starting to become like that. 

I mean, we have Senjougahara wearing a comically fake mustache and Kaiki in a Hawaiian shirt discussing how her and Araragi are going to avoid being horribly murdered by a snake god.

Conjecture: To subtly imply the [growing influence that Gaen has](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1q8xvf/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cdaiq0w) on the current events. 
>> ARTICLE
Ohh could be. That's a really interesting idea. 

With Kaiki's justification it would make sense for Gaen to be heavily influencing this situation which would totally support that theory. 
>> ARTICLE
Gotta say that was a really fun episode. I really loved how Kaiki flew to Okinawa for the sake of a lie to be a half truth. As well as the fact that they had some kind of game to shock eachother in which Kaiki won with his shirt. I loved seeing Senjougahara display some emotion as well. And at the end there, it was funny how Kaiki was convincing himself to find a reason to help them. :-P I'm also looking forward to Hanamonogatari so we can finally know what is going on with Kanbaru.

Extra Note: If you reply to this comment with spoilers from the Light Novel, Nadeko help you I'm gonna be pissed. Some asshole already spoiled something for me in the last discussion despite not wanting spoilers. \^_^

I liked how their costumes kept changing. Was it showing him being a unreliable narrator or them cleaning up after they poured liquid on each other? Senjougahara changed glasses three times, so I'd guess it is the former and not the latter.

Excited for this arc, Kaiki is an  incredibly interesting and well made character, and then Senjougahara is my favorite character of all time. I was a little disappointed when I saw that she wasn't listed as a main character for this season, but her getting an arc makes me more than thrilled. I expect great things from this one as usual.
>> ARTICLE
> Main character

I take it you are talking about what MAL lists as the main characters? They do happen to change it on a season-by-season basis.

I guess it was pretty accurate to [list Araragi/Shinobu as the two mains](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17074/Monogatari_Series:_Second_Season). Unlike other characters, they have been involved with every arc so far.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's what I was going off of. Although none of the characters are guaranteed to be in an episode like usual. It took like 5 episodes for Araragi to show up in this season anyways. Who's listed as a main character doesn't seem to matter all that much since it changes on an arc to arc basis.
>> ARTICLE
I'm bummed that neither Kizu nor Hana have been animated before Kaiki, but I'm excited for an eventual rewatch once everything has been completed, or at least the first two seasons. I feel like I don't understand all the characters' relationships very well, but that might be because I need another run through.   
I wish I had another reason to learn Japanese, other than "be able to fully immerse myself in the -monogatari universe via the LNs."
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki for best girl. So pumped for this arc.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was great. Kaiki is a great character, he's really grown on me since I first saw him. Also, I loved the colors this episode! This series has the best cinematography. 
>> ARTICLE
yay for more Hitagi!

>i think nothing of my past even if one of my scams forced a girl into prostitution, my way of life wouldn't change one bit

huh? i don't quite remember from Nise but if that's what he did to Hitagi then it surprises me that Kaiki threw the cup of coffee in her face.

why would Kaiki help Gaen's niece? i don't quite recall anything between them except him and Gaen going to the same school at one point.

also.. noteworthy mention of Oshino Meme's absence once again plus an absence of Oshino Ougi, present throughout so far. there has got to be a connection there that's not mentioned yet.

missed Saito Chiwa's pragmatic voice. her inflections when she's affected by something are delicious.. I'd love a scene where Hitagi would be drastically moved by something and prompt her higher pitch tone. here's to hoping till this arc is done.
>> ARTICLE
>  I'd love a scene where Hitagi would be drastically moved by something and prompt her higher pitch tone. here's to hoping till this arc is done.

Huh. Would be interesting for sure. But I feel like it wouldn't really fit to her character. But then again, I guess it could be very fitting if it is pulled off well. 


>> ARTICLE
> huh? i don't quite remember from Nise but if that's what he did to Hitagi then it surprises me that Kaiki threw the cup of coffee in her face.

That's not what he did to her, you misunderstood that line. He just confirmed with himself that he wouldn't really mind if she became a prostitute to pay him for this job (despite his dislike for such practices, which he expressed through the coffee).

Everything about Kaiki even when not coming from his mouth seems to be a half truth or outright lie. I wouldn't be surprised if Hitagi doesn't actually have the full story behind her first encounter with him

The part where Gahara is negotiating with Kaiki is so similar to how a kid asks a favor to a powerful dad and use childish threats to gain advantage. It's kind of cute in a way

I just love the soundtrack on this entire episode. The instant the episode started and the soundtrack started playing, I already knew it was Kaiki. Plus his logic and narration is strangely hilarious. Oh and when Senjougahara offered her body and he threw his drink at her LOL

I love how Kaiki sees every Human very clearly unlike our previous narrators, but their faces are all the same, no not even the same, they are all simply far away from human faces, implying the Kaiki couldn't care less about each and every individual becouse money is what matters to him.

fantastic episode that sets the stage for the final four eps. im glad its hitagi. i haven't read the novel nor the manga, so this was intense for me. i was wondering why they cant kill Nadeko but then everyone gets stabbed in the fight episode for her arc. i wonder what could possibly trick her into not killing them or whats stopping her from killing them afterwards. i mean he has too make her mortal again or its pointless. looking forward to the rest of the season and an little bit for the OVA but more excited and sad that its almost over

Even if it is just to find an excuse to help Araragi and Senjougahara, after that ending I can't help wondering if something happened between him and Gaen that's going unsaid.  Kanbaru as an excuse seems almost too convenient even for one adept at inventing excuses in the first place.

I teared up when Shinobu X asked Araragi to pat her head....oh man :( 

Such a great conclusion, even if it did feel a bit rushed.

>> ARTICLE
Her request of getting patted on the head was just a big tear jerker. 

Goddamn, it conveyed so much 
>> ARTICLE
i was honestly expecting Araragi to stop Shinobu before she did what she had to just to give her a hug or something.. she looked so pathetic and miserable

glad we got that scene even if it was brief. i wanted them to speak to the grieved Shinobu more but it couldn't be helped i suppose.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Araragi talking to her would have just added more pain to her really 
>> ARTICLE
it just shows how controlled and sane she actually was though.. i expected that if he had given her any kind of solace she would've gone against the loli Shinobu and tried to keep Araragi for herself in a mad attempt to placate her feelings that drove her insane. 

glad to see it wasn't the case, even if her destiny is very sad regardless
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so since like they said after they returned the Shinobu from the other route wanted to die together with her Araragi.
>> ARTICLE
except he wasn't dead for sure.. and they didn't bother to check or ask.
>> ARTICLE
He would have died in that world. Because he never knew Mayoi, he never ended up finding Shinobu that time. Because of that, she wasn't there to save him and Black Hanekawa would have killed him.
>> ARTICLE
How else did Shinobu get her powers back as full vampire?
>> ARTICLE
Separation.. She did mention before that the reason she has that form is cause of how araragi thinks of her AND she said if they were to be apart he would return to being fully human. .meaning she would also turn full vampire
>> ARTICLE
Where was that mentioned? I don't mind being proven wrong in this case, but with all her powers returned it would require someone like Oshino to keep his existence secret so she would keep destroying the world, but why should he do that?
>> ARTICLE
This wouldn't make sense. In the last arc their connection was severed and she still retained her loli state. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm kinda sad that the only way for her to be in peace was to die. 

She was quite composed wasn't she despite what she saw. I suppose seeing Araragi alive gave her some mental strength in a way to be sane for a while 
>> ARTICLE
In those few seconds, the summation of all of Shinobu's depression, hate and failures in this route was conveyed. She was lonely, she just needed someone to tell her that they were there for her...

I don't feel the conclusion was rushed, Monogatari tends to have such conflicts solved with discussion rather than fighting, for example in Karen Bee. Although I haven't read Kabukimonogatari, which is supposed to be the longest LN, 5 episodes weren't really needed for this right?

Edit: I read your other reply, this arc could have benefited from more screen time? Was there anything critical that was left out?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think 5 episodes were needed for Tsubasa Tiger. (and I love Hanekawa!) Kabuki, being the longest, really would have benefitted from have the 5 episodes more than Tsubasa Tiger considering the fact that overall more stuff (shenanigans like loli Hanekawa and also running into Adult Hachikuji/Shinobu) happens. And I don't think anything critical was left out, but things were sped up so much and a good example of that was Oshino's letter. I felt it was soooo rushed. I was really looking forward to seeing how it was going to be done and it just felt like they were trying to squeeze it all in as much as they could. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok, I definitely agree that more time could have been given to the older Hachikuji scene. I see what you mean by "rushing" the Oshino letter, I kind of feel the word "rushed" was the wrong word though, makes it sound like it was sub-par. Sure, Oshino was talking *really* fast. However this was the single best sequence in this arc (or series?) so far, his voice only added to the urgency of his situation when writing the letter, just before going on a suicide mission.
>> ARTICLE
I wish adult Hachikuji could have had more screen time. 

Yeah, though I don't mean it like it was sub-par. It wasn't bad at all but it felt like they were just really trying to put as much of it in there as they could, though I do understand that it did add urgency.

And ahhh! I don't agree...I'd say the letter to Black Hanekawa in the last arc was a better sequence. 
>> ARTICLE
> I wish adult Hachikuji could have had more screen time. 

seeing as they chose to depart without going deeper with interaction i don't see how they could've pulled it off. they could've given the miserable Shinobu of this timeline more time to talk to Araragi though, felt like they just killed her off too fast considering how strong both vampires felt towards their fate, not to mention Araragi who just looked stunned.

granted.. the implied relationship between them was there and it was set with the whole -we die together, always- chat.
>> ARTICLE
I did question whether it be best from arc, or best from series. For example, we had some great scenes last episode, and I personally found the scene of Gahara analysing Hanekawa's personality via her taste in food one of the best sequences out of all of the -monogatari's.

Thank you, since we're here: there was this Monogatari series timeline posted a while ago but I didn't understand how one was supposed to read the books in the right order when some of them would start before and end after one other.

It's just a clever (and convoluted) way of telling the story. A good parallel would be how Haruhi was aired out of chronological order. It doesn't "make sense", but the story-telling is enhanced by your sometimes-limited and sometimes-expanded knowledge. 

Essentially, the author intends for you to read it in the order he released it.

I think that has a lot to do with the fact that this arc was condensed into 4 episodes. If it had gotten the proper 5 or 6 that it needed, it would have been much, much better. This arc was still amazing even at 4 episodes though.
>> ARTICLE
Yah, when it mentioned she was still alive in this world, I really thought there'd be another episode. I think it would've gone very well with another one.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah 4 episodes is good for pacing, but 5 probably could have covered most if not all of the character development in the light novel. Tsubasa Tiger could have benefited from this as well.
>> ARTICLE
Tsubasa Tiger had 5 episodes and we saw how well Hanekawa developed over those 5 episodes, so I agree that 5 would have covered all of the character development. Regardless, it was still really well done and nothing too important was left out.

It's the recap that really threw it all off for Kabuki, unfortunately.

Maybe it's just me and the fact that I've been reading all these "best girl" threads too much, but I felt like that was an intentional slap in the face for shippers. Kind of like: "It's Senjougahara in the main timeline, but even if you go into another timeline/universe it's still Senjougahara."
>> ARTICLE
i think ALL discussion concerning Araragi's mate should have died the instant his mother was revealed.

other girls are great and all for people who self-insert.. but the canon has been established.
>> ARTICLE
Shippers gonna ship...

I like Hanegawa more than Senjougahara but I have no problem with Araragi/Senjougahara pairing, as long as Senjougahara does not start monopolizing all the screentime. That's never been a problem with the Monogatari series, though, and I really enjoyed the Tsubasa Tiger arc (the Senjougahara + Hanegawa interplay was delicious) and, although I wasn't initially too fond of Shinobu, the last arc has been wonderful too -- I've never been much into loli-type characters, but if this trend with characters like Tsukiko (from Henneko) and Shinobu continues, I'll be a raging lolicon in no time...

Anyway, I'd really love to see some more Tsukihi (and Karen too, I guess) in the future and after rewatching Bakemonogatari I've started missing Kanbaru too. Nadeko has never been a huge favourite of mine, but just the prospect of hearing more of HanaKana's voice acting makes me want to see more of her too.

There are too many "best girls" in this series...
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I think the implication of Meme's words was that Araragi and Gahara will end up with each other in every timeline, no matter how unlikely it seems.
>> ARTICLE
its hitagi for what, 60-70 years? then its mofo shinobu for 200-300. BAM

Also Hachikuji! And does Tsukihi have age immortality? I couldn't tell. I just know she can recover from all damage taken.

If I recall, she can die of old age.

Pretty sure Tsukihi doesn't or else she would be a infant forever. I do think that when she decides to pass on from old age if she even does then she will turn into energy and impregnate another lady into having a phoenix baby.

Grown up Hachikuji is banging. 

The arrival of Oshino X, or is it a return? 

The bonds of love sticking true to Araragi x Senjougahara in different universes. 

This episode was very refreshing, brought out some great closure(?) on what happened with the whole Hachikuji rescue, she's grown up into a *fine* ojou-san, with a pretty banging bod. 

Also a bit of throwback coming from Oshino's part, remember his unique dialogue was another great feat in this episode, I was glad we got to see some of him in Monogatari S2, of course, just cause I haven't picked up the novels yet, no clue what to expect. 

It's time to see this dual-wielding double in action and also the return of the glorious Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade! Just kidding, no action... just beautiful people doing beautiful things. Araragi patting Kiss-shot made my heart go doki-doki x100. That scene was beautiful. 

Back to reality, back to present, back to Hachikuji, I loved their flubbing conversation. I have nothing more to comment, it was a great way to wrap the series up, now onto the next one!
>> ARTICLE
Oshino's mention of Araragi x Senjougahara made me laugh. It also planted the seed of hope that is that somewhere, in a different timeline... Araragi x Hanekawa exists. I think Oshino suspected that since the Araragi of his timeline picked Gahara, then the Araragi of our timeline picked Hanekawa.

> Adult Hachikuji

I'd tap that. If Araragi wasn't so into lolis, he probably could've tapped that, too.

As always, Kizu teases everywhere in this episode. Maybe it'll come out in 2014? We can only hope. 

The conversation between Hachikuji and Araragi was really sweet at the end. Neither of them have regrets for dying/turning into a vampire, and if things didn't happen the way that it did, they wouldn't have met each other and became friends. Perhaps they still have some "what if's" lingering, but it seems like they're pretty content on how things turned out. 
>> ARTICLE
Both NisiOisiN and Shinbo are definitely geniuses.

The gataries has had such a big impact on me, I doubt I'll ever lose this feeling I have for it.

There isn't much to have to explain about NisiOisiN, his writing is on such a level. Not only is his use of language stunning, everything else about his writing is amazing. I can't ask for anything more. I will definitely master Japanese one day and be able to read it in all its original glory.

Shinbo, similarly, is also on an other level. He's somebody who understands everything about the medium he works with. Not only is he able to follow conventions of our time, he is able to add so much to it -- it's hard not to be impressed. I mean, simple things like the way the camera works, and how the scene is composed makes it so amazing.

Shinbo understands so much about NisiOisiN's writing, it's amazing how well it works together. For example, since most of the gataries are written as /recounts/ from the point of view of the narrator, everything is actually the narrator's version of the events. When Araragi found out Mayoi was alive in this timeline, the portrayal of the town changed so drastically (take a look at how it looks pre and post finding Mayoi). I thought that was, amongst many other things, very intelligent. 
>> ARTICLE
> I will definitely master Japanese one day and be able to read it in all its original glory.

I actually learned Japanese specifically to read the Zaregoto novels. Definitely one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life, as it was a very rewarding experience.

I was surprised by how easy it is to read Nisio novels in Japanese. Considering how insane his stories can be at times, you'd expect it to be really hard, and sometimes it is, but his novels are like 90% dialogue, and dialogue is always really easy to guess based on the context, even if you can't read a few of the kanji in a sentence.

If you're interested in roughly how much time it would take you to learn to read Nisio Isin novels if you started today, it took me about 1 year of self-study (anki flashcards, videogames, manga, anime) to get to the point where I was able to follow the story but not always the specifics, and 1 more year to get to the point where I understood pretty much everything.

I was "studying" Japanese for about ~4 hours a day, so that's about 3000 hours to what I'd call almost fluency. That might seem like a lot, but time flies by when you're having fun, and learning Japanese is definitely fun if you're into the culture.
>> ARTICLE
How did you go about learning Japanese? This series made me want to learn the language after a couple of months of "I'm gonna learn Japanese."
>> ARTICLE
Here's a rough summary of what I did. Bear in mind that I was fully focused on *understanding* Japanese, and only that. None of this will teach you to write Japanese, or to speak it with confidence.

* First step is learning how to read hiragana and katakana, since you'll always run into those. Games like [this](http://www.kanagrams.com/app.php?type=play) are very useful for learning to recognize these syllables. I used an app similar to the textboxer mode in that link, and learned to recognize the syllables with 95% accuracy in a day or two.

* [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) or any other spaced repetition flashcard method is perhaps the best tool for learning Japanese. I spent about 30-45 minutes a day reviewing the "RTK 1 and 3 w Kanji Definition and Yomi" and "Core 2000 Japanese Vocabulary" decks, with some minor modifications of my own (reversing the answer/question orders at times so the question always includes kanji and the answer always English).
The Core 2000 deck was easily the more useful one, I picked up on *a lot* of vocabulary using it, and was delighted to find that most of the words I had already heard used in anime, which made memorizing their meaning a lot easier.

Meanwhile, I was reading [this](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar) guide on and off, mostly to learn how the grammar particles and suffixes in Japanese work.

* After I had a few kanji down, I started reading manga and playing videogames in Japanese. Started with simple stuff where it didn't matter all that much if I couldn't read every sentence, and slowly moved onto heavier stuff. I used the translation files from [this site](http://kitsunekko.net/) to occasionally watch anime with Japanese subtitles.
In the beginning, when you barely know any Japanese at all, it is better to rewatch things in Japanese instead of watching a new show, since you already have a rough idea of what's being said and won't feel constantly lost.

Also, if you're into visual novels, there's set-ups that will extract the text of a visual novel, and allow you to hover over words to see their translation while playing. Google: visual novels agth, for guides on this. 
The Rikaichan/Rikaikun add-on for Firefox/Chrome does something similar to this, and is very useful for reading Japanese posted online.

If you wish to learn how to *write* in Japanese while doing all of this, I think the only method is to pick a few characters and then just constantly practice writing them until you know them by heart, then pick some more symbols to learn and so on. Beware that memorizing a Japanese symbol to the point where you can write it, takes considerably more time than memorizing it to the point where you can recognize it. You only have to roughly know the shape to read it, whereas you need to remember every smallest detail to write it out.


When learning a language, the most important thing is to actually do things in said language. It doesn't really matter what you do, just do *anything*. If you spend several thousand hours doing something in a foreign language, you'll end up learning that language. I learned English from videogames alone, no books or classes or anything (I did, however, start reading books *after* I was already fluent).

Japanese is a rather segmented language, though. Watching Japanese television won't teach you how to write. If you want to learn how to write, practice writing. If you want to learn how to speak Japanese, practice speaking it. If you want to learn how to read light novels in Japanese, first learn some kanji and vocabulary, and then start reading the novels, even if the reading is slow and you don't understand all of it. There's no way around that initial "wow, this is hard to read", but you'll only have to deal with it for the first few novels.


Just remember to have fun! All that truly matters is spending a lot of time with the language, and it's much easier if you're actually enjoying yourself.

Replying just to save this comment.  Thanks for the detailed info, this will help a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your time explaining this! I've always wanted a basic understanding of Japanese and this helps me on my way to that. If you don't mind me asking, what was your native language?
>> ARTICLE
My mom speaks Finnish with me and my dad Swedish, so I consider both of those my native language.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks a lot for the detailed post!

The way your learnt it all is very similar to how I have it planned. The only difference is that I'm trying to do both read and write simultaneously. I never even considered learning to read before writing.

I think you're pretty much spot on about everything.
>> ARTICLE
I think I can pretty much understand 80%, if not more, when I watch anime raw. 

I plan on visiting (and hopefully stay there for a while) Japan once I graduate, so I'll definitely have to learn how to read/write by then.

I just very recently started to learn, still on the kanas. It's a bit frustrating not being able to write the characters neatly, but I think it'll work out if I persevere. It's a lot of fun since I'm very interested in Japan. I'm actually not so worried about the kanjis, I've done traditional Chinese for a few years in the past so I know how writing them works. I think that once I get past the kanas, building up vocabulary should be easy if I just keep at it.

Zaregoto was what prompted me to want to learn Japanese also, actually. I remember not being able to find the 2nd or 3rd volume and making a vow to myself to learn so that I could read all the NisiOisiN  before I die.

Very interesting to hear that it won't take too long to read NisiO! I seriously thought otherwise.

Hooray for yet another recap episode next week (and probably after every arc at this rate)!  
  
https://i3.minus.com/iOvPHEsKigxvd.png  
  
Still not sure why Shaft feels it's necessary to piss away nearly 20% of the episodes doing recaps when they're cutting out content to make it happen.
>> ARTICLE
I am questioning the reason they cut out Hanamonogatari, since they are simply replacing those episodes with a recap after every arc....
>> ARTICLE
Because that's a whole nother arc to animate. And why bother with the extra time work and money when you can add recap episodes that won't affect sales? Plus now they can release Hanamonogatari as its own thing for extra cash. $haft is just thinking like a business(because, well, they are)
>> ARTICLE
Because of when it takes place chronologically, it happens much, much later than everything else. 
>> ARTICLE
Time constraints maybe. I hope at least one other arc gets 5 episodes, but it's doubtful.
>> ARTICLE
The recaps give them an extra week to work on the episodes before they release them. If they planned it to be 2 cour and then pushed Hanamonogatari off into a seperate thing it means that overall it still has the same amount of episodes for adaptation, it's just going to take a little while longer to finish airing. 

It sucks that we have to wait an extra week inbetween arcs, but if we get to see more stuff like the letter scene then I think it's a fair trade-off.
>> ARTICLE
I'm less annoyed at the wait between arcs and more annoyed that the arcs feel rushed when they have time to spare. At least if the arcs were more reminiscent of Bakemonogatari, they could fix them for the BDs. Instead, we're left with incomplete adaptations without anywhere near as much character development as the novels provide. That's not something you can fix for the BDs without redoing every episode from scratch to account for the new pacing that's been provided.
>> ARTICLE
> without anywhere near as much character development as the novels provide.

This will probably never be the case since written medium as opposed to visual is way more favorable to character development. 
>> ARTICLE
So do we get to see adult Mayoi now? Thats clearly what theyve been baiting, but knowing Isin, the answer is no because fuck you. Not that Id be moved much either way - frankly, last episode was so good its already justified whatever other nonsense this arc pulls together, and we havent even gotten to the full thematic point yet. Good times ahead!

Incidentally, I missed last weeks episode because busy, but Ive caught up and put together a writeup for that one as well. [You can find that here.](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/09/07/monogatari-s2-episode-9/)

**Episode 10**

1:27 - Have to admit, [Mayoi as a zombie hunter](http://i.imgur.com/zNAizsJ.jpg) is pretty badass. And Araragi knows it - nice series of holy shit, *thats Mayoi?* shots there

1:59 - Shinobu, if you havent realized by now that [this universe runs according to the rules of narrative convenience](http://i.imgur.com/5BK2yi7.jpg)

3:15 - [Nice.](http://i.imgur.com/vUeVAu7.png) They are playing with shadows a *lot* in this arc. Clues, clues

3:53 - [Well, theres a clarification.](http://i.imgur.com/a0i9XUj.jpg) We are indeed in a many-timeline universe

4:26 - [Isin has trouble keep a straight face in pretty much all his stories](http://i.imgur.com/jmXPq7H.jpg). Nice name, Shinobu

4:43 - [I always love these interpretive sequences.](http://i.imgur.com/XYPN46P.jpg) And I guess this makes two stories in a row where the antagonist is an unwanted version of a characters self

5:22 - [Also great.](http://i.imgur.com/qCyj5dD.jpg) Also, Oshinos line about the impossible hope of his mission kind of resonates with Shinobus line from last week about maintaining optimism and pushing forward just to avoid stasis. Which in turn works with the red light/green light thing, and the futility of dwelling on (or attempting to change) the past

5:32 - [When have Araragis powers EVER been relevant to his missions?](http://i.imgur.com/2rXVTrc.jpg) Outside of Hanekawas issues, he mainly just gets beat up while talking the enemy to death

5:49 - [As if Araragi could resist that](http://i.imgur.com/kvITcg3.jpg)

6:56 - [I love her replacement badass survival backpack.](http://i.imgur.com/10kXFVT.jpg) Also, all this work to save her and shes still alone

8:35 - [New palette!](http://i.imgur.com/72Uyhen.jpg) And what a lovely color scheme it is

9:15 - [Even this world is beautiful](http://i.imgur.com/cPIJrs4.jpg) now that Araragi knows that somewhere, Hachikuji survived

10:29 - [Not quite sure what all to make of this conversation. Nice view, though](http://i.imgur.com/wtoBmYQ.jpg)

12:31 - [They make for quite the silly pair](http://i.imgur.com/5yupmbU.jpg)

13:11 - I kind of jokingly referred to this as an Araragi/Shinobu buddy cop arc early on, but [yeah, thats pretty much exactly where theyve gone with it.](http://i.imgur.com/CkxUn7q.jpg) Fun bonding time in alternate universe zombie apocalypses

13:22 - [Well this is a new one](http://i.imgur.com/NN0DPg5.jpg)

14:11 - Isin finds outer demons significantly less interesting than [inner ones](http://i.imgur.com/joYIuLx.jpg)

Okay, that was hammy, even for me

15:02 - They are getting [so much visual mileage](http://i.imgur.com/NyqX3FL.jpg) out of this shrine

17:27 - [This Shinobu required the same thing our Araragi did](http://i.imgur.com/J7dHYPP.png) - to know that there is still hope somewhere.

20:00 - [One more shadow for good measure.](http://i.imgur.com/vtrwGO0.jpg) Right, shadows have always been relevant

23:01 - [Alright, moral of the story time](http://i.imgur.com/XF1TP3z.jpg)

23:15 - [And two](http://i.imgur.com/xLnpvl0.jpg)

23:35 - [...and three](http://i.imgur.com/jDQMomp.jpg)

24:05 - [Jeez Araragi, leaving a little explaining for the rest of us, would you?](http://i.imgur.com/2TLlws6.jpg)

**And Done**

Route down! That was pretty solid - I enjoyed the second half *significantly* more than the first, but thats mainly because I find Shinbos gorgeous cinematography far more satisfying than Isins campy humor. I liked how it was primarily a Shinobu story, and that Hachikujis own theme was kind of just sewn in along the edges - Hachikujis general theme of you must go forward, come what may, because going forward is its own reward and what makes you happy will often come as a surprise basically bookended the series, whereas Shinobus far more classically Monogatari story (accepting all elements of yourself, a very close parallel to Hanekawa and Tsukihis stories) basically took over in the parallel world. I really like how Isin tied the two resolutions together - the parallel of Araragis satisfaction at seeing a world where Mayoi had a chance to be alive and happy with alternate-Shinobus (no, I will not type out her ridiculous name) combined happiness and grief at her own better self is pretty satisfying stuff. Not just elegant, but also emotionally effective - Araragi introducing that concept helps on the emotional sell of Shinobus climax.

Overall, I dont think this arc was as strong as the first (which isnt really a fair comparison, since I think that arc is the best thing Monogataris done yet), but it was still some solid Monogatari. Bring on the next one!

-old posts are [here](http://wrongeverytime.com/)-
>> ARTICLE
As usual, thanks for this write up! And on the first part of this arc: I haven't read it yet, but apparently in the original book there was a lot more interesting Araragi/Shinobu interactions that ended up being cut out. While the first part of this arc in the anime was more comedic, it seems there was more mood swinging in this part of the novel.

Also, as you may have heard, Kabukimonogatari is the longest novel that's being covered this season, and yet it only got 4 episodes. More than anything else so far, it seems that this arc should've had more episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Hm, that's interesting. It might just be a balance thing when it comes to the transition between mediums - I was already getting pretty antsy during the first two episodes of this arc, since there's only so much you can do to make a series of monologues interesting in a visual medium. Obviously Monogatari is always ridiculously dialogue-heavy, but some things do lend themselves to creative visual presentation more than others (which is a problem I also had with the first Mayoi story).
>> ARTICLE
I think it was implied that Oshino specifically gave the letter to Mayoi because she was the one that alternate time-line Araragi saved and he would want to know at the very least that she survived.

I believe Oshino has mentioned that the oddities and supernatural exist because of people and appear because of them. Mayoi and shinobu are both oddities, Koyomi is the one being affected. So the question is really more of why mayoi and shinobu are affecting him. 

If you look back at the first Hachikuji arc and see the reason she appeared was to make Araragi lost and we get the reason why. His school life and expectations led to him feeling guilty and drove a wedge between him and his Family. It seems like such a light joking thing, but him time traveling because he didn't do his summer homework is more than just something humorous. Throughout Nise and bake he's been working on his studies in order to get his life back on track and go to college with Hitagi. 

If I were to ground it in reality, take one suicidally depressed teenager and his problem in his academic failures. substitute time travel with anime/books/movies, substitute shinobu with his own self image and watch him flounder around in fantasy before he is confronted with the reality of having to deal with his failures and realize he's going to have to do something about the situation at hand. 
>> ARTICLE
> see the reason she appeared was to make Araragi lost 

Wait, that isn't quite right. She appeared because Araragi wanted to be away from home, not to make him lost. That's why Hanekawa could see her, but Senjougahara couldn't. 
>> ARTICLE
Well yes she appears to people who don't want to go back home, but while both Hanekawa and Araragi can see her, it's only Araragi who ends up not going home because he wants to help her. 

Saying she's there to make him lost isn't the best wording, but she's there because Araragi needs a reason to not be at his house and hers is that of a perpetually lost little girl. 
>> ARTICLE
This is how I like to interpret Monogatari too. Add to the fact that Oshino has said multiple times in Neko:Kuro and Tsubasa Cat that Hanekawa's oddities are a representation of multiple personality disorder.

I am not sure how to interpret Karens Bee or Kanbaru's arm, but I believe Senjougahara's weight issue was also linked to a psychological dissociation from what occurred with her mother and the cult in Hitagi Crab.
>> ARTICLE
When Kaiki plants the Bee on Karen he says something along the lines of "I see you're naturally delusional so this will prove effective" tying that in with her unwavering belief of justice/righteousness you could say Karen Bee is about Karen's inflated sense of self.(delusions of grandeur, possibly). 
 
 Kanbaru's arm was as a consequence of her jealousy (whether it be about the running squad or Araragi dating Senjougahara). It was also about her suppression of these emotions and how they clash with her straight forward exterior personality. So jealousy, hatred and denial of these darker feelings. 
 
 Tsukihi arc is probably about adoption or half-siblings. The sort of difference in blood relation that might cause a family to break up upon discovery (if kept secret). (Though i admit that's a little forced so if anyone can come up with a better interpretation of Tsukihi arc, please tell me)
>> ARTICLE
Wait, is Tsukihi adopted or did I misunderstand something along the way?
>> ARTICLE
No she's an oddity which is implanted in the mother's womb. I just took that to be a metaphor or representation of adoption since the issue that's raised because of that is, according to Kagenui, that she's not really a member of the family in terms of blood relation (issues of identity and belonging). Of course Koyomi is like, that doesn't matter she's still my sister, and gets heroically beaten up.
>> ARTICLE
Ok on hindsight I probably understood Kanbaru's arm, I knew it was something to do with jealousy but couldn't quite put a finger on it.

Great analysis of Karen, she definitely looks like the Chuunibyou type, no wonder she had such an epic fight against Araragi! :p
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that's a really compelling take on the series overall. And it makes sense with all the self-image stuff the show constantly hammers in - what you ostensibly are doesn't really matter, because definitions are fluid and we can become what we choose to be. Along with the whole Shinobu/Araragi's shadow thing.

Yeah, I think that checks out.
>> ARTICLE
could someone tell me if this is the last episode of the arc? I'd like to know if I can finally marathon this.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, this is the last episode of this arc.
>> ARTICLE
whats the next arc going to be about :o

Otorimonogatari, Nadeko Medusa. It's going to be about Nadeko and it's going to be told from her point of view.

Will Shenjougahara be in it at all?

Yes, but not a whole lot.
>> ARTICLE
She's not in it a lot, strictly speaking, but she's very important to the Otori storyline.

"She's not in it a lot, strictly speaking, but she's very important to the XXX storyline" seems to be the standard structure of darn near every arc in the series.

Yes, this exactly.

Fuck I have been having shenjougahara withdraw l because she really hasn't been in it much since Bakemonogatari.

Yep. She won't have a whole lot of screen time until Koimonogatari.

>> ARTICLE
Koi is the final arc for this season.
>> ARTICLE
Oh jeez... Nadeko is my least favorite character... Sounds like you've read it, is it good?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, Snake is my least favorite too but it's actually pretty damn good. This book sets up the plot for Koimonogatari (Hitagi End)
>> ARTICLE
Actually I think for timeline's sake, the animation will do Onimonogatari first, which chronologically follows Kabukimonogatari. 
>> ARTICLE
If they were going for the timeline's sake, they would have started with Kabuki.
>> ARTICLE
I mean they are doing Oni immediately after Kabuki, since the end scene of Kabuki is the starting scene of Oni.

If they do it by the publication order, viewer might gets confused, so they go by chronological order with Kabuki, Oni and Otori, and skip out on Hana.  This is the explanation I read on another forum.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure they're doing Otori next. It was already confusing for the viewer this time around because at the end of Neko:White, when Araragi showed up, people thought this arc was going to explain that but it didn't. I'm sure they're just doing it in publication order excluding Hanamonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
I really just read a couple people on an anime forum saying that the animation series will do Oni after Kabuki.  Those posters seem to be quite knowledgeable in matters concerning this animation, so I just take their words for it.

Personally I just thought that since they bothered to give a lot of time to the bicycle scene with Hachikuji, chances are they would do Oni next, which would connect the end scene of this arc with the opening scene of the next arc.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just going to add one line from the LN which I was waiting for throughout this arc but was sadly cut. Right after Araragi realises Kiss-Shot wasn't going to fight, "In fact if Oshino were actually here, if he saw us standing ready with four fearsome swords, saw our violent mindset, he would undoubtedly have said, 'You really are energetic, did something good happen?' "
>> ARTICLE
I am so glad that I resisted the temptation to read the LN further.  
This Episode was really worth the wait.(Plot twist: every episode is)

I thought Araragi showed up in Tsubasa Tiger right after this arc, with torn up cloths and the sword but that is not how this ended.

That would be in a few days. The end of the Tsubasa Tiger arc didn't end right when school started again, it began when school started.
>> ARTICLE
So while Nekomonogatari White was taking place we have Kabukimonogatari, Hanamonogatari, Otorimonogatari, and Onimonogatari occurring one-after-another/simultaneously?  
>> ARTICLE
Before Nekomonogatari White, Kabukimonogatari happened. During Nekomonogatari White, Onimonogatari was happening. After Nekmonogatari White/Onimonogatari, Otorimonogatari happens. After Otorimonogatari, it's Koimonogatari. Then Hanamonongatari which is sometime after Koi.
>> ARTICLE
This arc happens before Tsubasa Tiger. 

From another of my comments:

>He went back in time/to a different timeline on the night of August 20th.
Woke up on August 21st on the steps of the shrine in his original timeline.
When Hachikuji runs into him at the end of the episode, she had already talked to Tsubasa, who was on her way to school.

Araragi shows up in Tsubasa Tiger after Onimonogatari. In Onimonogatari [Spoilers for Monogatari S2](/s "Araragi and Hachikuji run into something on their way back that causes him to be absent throughout the rest of Tsubasa Tiger.") Keep in mind Oni and Tsubasa Tiger happen at the same time. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, and I don't want to google Onimonogatari because of spoilers so could you just tell me whose arc that is?
>> ARTICLE
The story in Onimonogatari is Shinobu Time. Like the arc that just finished, it's focuses on both Shinobu and Hachikuji.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say this arc was more focused on Shinobu with lots of Hachikuji mention and Oni is [spoilers](/s "overall more focused on Hachikuji with only some Shinobu interaction.")
>> ARTICLE
Yep, Nisio at work.
>> ARTICLE
Shinobu.
>> ARTICLE
Good episode though it felt a bit too rushed in it's pacing? Not talking about the ending, that was fine, it's how all the info was kinda dumped. 
>> ARTICLE
Just the first half of the episode felt rushed to me too. The latter half was perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the first half was like too fast for me. I would have preferred this episode to have been split into two I think. 

I really loved the latter half though. It was so good. 
>> ARTICLE
That episode was awesome. I LOVED Oshino's letter, it was animated beautifully. Of course there was grown up Hachikuji, but I got that spoiled for me last night so I was kinda sad. But of course of all things, that damn Kizu tease.
>> ARTICLE
Not looking for specifics or spoilers but, do we ever get to know what is in Mayoi's backpack? A simple yes or no will suffice. Once again, I'm not looking for specifics.
>> ARTICLE

The canon commentary already told you. It contains everything a school girl needs to stay overnight at her mother's house. Spare clothes, and all that. Nothing special.

Oshino's speech was fucking wonderful to listen to with headphones on. I came into this episode expecting an awesome fight, I left with awful feels.

I guess Araragi was right to bet on Hachikuji's development after all.

I did'nt think it could get better than ep.5 , but this. AOTY imo.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's just me but the video quality is absolutely awful. It looks like I'm watching it through frosted glass. :/
>> ARTICLE
Did you watch it on Daisuki?

Daisuki streams based on your bandwidth and internet speed, and adjusts quality accordingly. 

So if you have bad internet or your speed was very slow at the moment you were watching, Daisuki had to stream it at low quality to make it so there is no buffering. Otherwise, you'd have 720p the whole time, but you'd be buffering alot.

Time-traveling. So basically what I got from the explanation was that him traveling back in time means it's an alternate time-line due to him being present since the timelines are already set. So no matter how much time-traveling he does it won't change the original time-line or even the alternates.

So Araragi just so happens to travel through time after learning he forgot his summer homework when he's already close to failing. His time-line is completely unable to be affected by his actions and he wakes up basically right back where he started at the shrine steps with school starting. Hmm... sounds suspicious.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand, what's suspicious if I may ask?

He went back in time/to a different timeline on the night of August 20th.

Woke up on August 21st on the steps of the shrine in his original timeline.

When Hachikuji runs into him at the end of the episode, she had already talked to Tsubasa who was on her way to school. 

I'm so glad the time traveling didn't really make any plot holes. It usually happens when time travel is thrown into a show.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just saying it sounds suspiciously like the whole thing was in his head. I mean this is just what Araragi says happened so It's not like we can automatically assume it's the truth. We have to rely on the credibility of the witness in this case.

Is Araragi the kind of person who would just make stuff up like that? 
>> ARTICLE
There's the interpretation of monogatari that all the apparitions are actually not there and are just anthropomorphizations of the characters' personality/emotional conflicts.

Under that interpretation, all the supernatural occurrences, including time travel, don't take place at all.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't think so. Throughout the entire series, starting from Bakemonogatari, he's never done anything like that. He's forgetful and aloof sometimes too..kind of dense at times. Perhaps as Bake's Sejougahara would put it, he's too stupid to think up something so complex as time travel.
>> ARTICLE
when she invited arararagi over i thought the molester was about to become the molested.

>> ARTICLE
I dont read the LN's but I almost was in tears when it turned out that he didnt save Hachikuji in his time line :(

If I win the lottery, I am going to pay a translator to actually translate all the LNs just for me. I can't stand this week-long wait (now two weeks!), and I won't be able to stand the inevitable year+ long wait between this season and the next. I know that the books are difficult to translate, but I always found it strange that all the translation efforts died down, considering the show's fandom. Not that I expect anyone to put their own time into it for my sake or anything, but you'd think there'd be at least one bilingual person who would think of taking up the efforts. 

I was really fooled by the "new" character in this arc's ED. I thought the snail hairclip was one of the sister's egg hairclips, so I was anticipating that the survivor to show up would be Karen. I don't know if this was intentional, but if it was, good job Shaft character designer.

>> ARTICLE
I think it's quite amusing that she used the same huh in some of her sentences, her snake apparition used.
>> ARTICLE
That very in-your-ear way of saying *huh*. This one episode was great for showing off KanaHana's range of intonations.
>> ARTICLE
She even referred to herself as Ore-sama a few times, so I'd definitely say that even though he protested that it wasn't him, there's definitely some influence.
>> ARTICLE
The apparitions are real, but that doesn't make them _not_ all in your head :P

By which I mean: This is monogatari. There really is no _meaning_ to making that distinction, because the apparitions are explicitly designed to be _reflections_ of the issues these girls are facing.

>> ARTICLE
Next episode is the last episode for this arc, I assume. Then we get a stupid recap...

I look forward to it, to say the least.
 ___

Thoughts half way through the episode:

Tsukihi is really scary. We never get see why Araragi calls her scary besides the quick flashes in Nise, but here in this episode we see exactly how **she's fucking scary**. Also, Tsukihi and Hanekawa have the same bed head...they also look alike.

I couldnt really understand why Nadeko doesnt like to be called cute. Is it because she doesnt feel like a threat?  I'm still a bit confused on that.

I expected the haircut scene to be much more dramatic though, and I felt like Nadeko's expression wasn't really as horrified as it should've been. 

BGMs so far fit nicely. Visuals are okay, I see a bit of geometric lighting that reminds me of a certain other series that just ended. Besides that, it feels a bit choppy...and those text screens. I'm not even gonna bother trying to pause on Daisuki. I'll put em up later for sure though. I usually try to put them up during episodes like these, when the text flashes are unreasonabley quick.
 
~~More to come when I finish the episode!~~

**YES NADEKO. LET THE HATE FLOW THROUGH YOU.**

Fuck I [loved](http://25.media.tumblr.com/43d5c2fc82b222e5c6f579ef7bcca4e4/tumblr_mu7oy94UZU1rmn0a9o1_500.gif) that whole part of the episode. Her voice changed so much, it's almost unrecognizable. Amazing performance from KanaHana. I was taken aback by it almost as much as Nadeko was. I didn't expect her to go off like that at all (even as an LN reader, I'm surprised I can still be surprised by events like this). I'm sure others noticed how much she sounded like the snake during that whole fiasco...hmhmhm, Nadeko-chan. We can see now that Kuchinawa-san is very clearly a part of Nadeko. *Speech patterns the same? Now where have we seen this before...*

But something that really made me think was when she said Nadeko is a good for nothing, as well as when she brought back the point that she didn't really want to advance her love for Koyomi, yet she wants Koyomi to love her? What? Nadeko you really need to check yourself. That love of yours is messed up... (in many, many ways...). 

Also I do wonder how Nadeko got super strong all of sudden...maybe the leap of personality combined with the adrenaline flowing through her from yelling at the teacher made her go full on Hulk-mode and smash the door? I don't know but the second half of this episode was so **very** enjoyable.

EDIT: This is really, really late but I just realized Tsukihi's hair is short again.

> even as an LN reader

Question for you, do you know how many of the LN's have been translated into english? I've tried to find this out multiple times but no one ever gives me a straight answer. 

>> ARTICLE
Here: http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Monogatari_Series

You can probably look at their progress from there. Whatever is there is there, so everything else without a clickable link isn't translated.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you very much. 

I'm a bit unfamiliar with how baka-tsuki works, but is it only fan translations? Nothing official yet? (Not that that's an issue, I'm just curious.) 
>> ARTICLE
No, there are no official translations. Fan translations are all volunteer work. Great people sharing content so that everyone can enjoy them.

Wow, that's really impressive. My hats off to those good people; really glad they take the time to do these translations.

sasuga Fire Sisters emulating Koyomi's woman. can't wait for another Hitagi episode..

>I couldnt really understand why Nadeko doesnt like to be called cute. Is it because she doesnt feel like a threat? I'm still a bit confused on that.

ingrained psychological disorder caused by shyness, pining for koyomi and general passive/inferior complex.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure Tsukihi's hairstyle has changed from short to long and long to short multiple times. It almost appears that she has a different hairstyle every appearance.

My theory is that her hair grows much faster than other people (pheonix) so she has way more freedom with it.
>> ARTICLE
In the light novels Araragi points out that Tsukihi changes her hairstyle rather frequently (while Karen always kept her's the same).
>> ARTICLE
>I couldnt really understand why Nadeko doesnt like to be called cute. Is it because she doesnt feel like a threat? I'm still a bit confused on that.

I think its because last ep Shinobu was all like "all you got going for you is being cute and because you are so cute that you get your way" and she's being sensitive to that 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not so sure. She'd been called cute her whole life, wouldn't it make more sense for her to have been a bit passive about it? I think it has more to do with the fact that maybe she feels belittled by the term now.  Not only did Shinobu say she was only second best, but even Tsukihi said it. And Nadeko went as far as to question the real reason as to why Tsukihi even became friends with her. Thats the most reasonable explanation for it that I can come up with.
>> ARTICLE
When Tsukihi said why she was being all "don't call me cute" Nadeko said because someone said recently that all she had going for her was cute. 
>> ARTICLE
I know, but what I'm saying is why is being called cute so offensive? She seemed like she was offended by it even before Shinobu told her that her cuteness is all she has, but I find it weird how she could be offended by something that is otherwise a pretty positive compliment. I feel like maybe it was because she had been called that her whole life and she'd felt like she was also slung into an unimportant role for the majority of it (so far). Shinobu only made her, or even forced her, to become aware of it again. Nadeko had always been aware of the fact that she was cute and only cute, but she, just like Hanekawa, chose to avert her eyes from it.
>> ARTICLE
I think she was frustrated that everyone only saw first that she was cute and made assumptions of her personality and what she is like. Like her outburst at the teacher mentioned how she isn't all understanding and such cause she was cute

If Renai circulation is the cutesy love song and Mousou Express is the clingy obsessive love song then combined it shows that the cutesy love song and the obsessive love song were just two sides of the same coin.

Araragi just laying down the law, I feel bad for Sengoku :(.

I lost it at that scene for multiple reasons.
>> ARTICLE
I do love it when Araragi drops his, "Oh gosh lil' ol me so dense I got no idea how anyone feels about me" facade though.  That was one thing that I gotta think his sister was wrong about, he totally knew.
>> ARTICLE
He probably just ~~doesn't~~ didn't want to acknowledge it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, same as with him and Hanekawa.  He doesn't want to hurt anybody's feelings, so he plays dumb.  And he's really good at playing dumb!
>> ARTICLE
Well when it came to Hanekawa, he sort of forced his image of her onto her and was also aware of his feelings. He just chose to not follow them  and stay a "good" guy. I think he really was oblivious to her feelings for him, as per the dramatic reaction in Bakemonogatari Ep 14.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the anime is hurt by Kizu not coming out yet, but I think he actually made his mind up fairly early about not actually being romantically into Hanekawa, even though he still totally lusts after her body.  

Actually speaking of that it was cool to get the sister's opinion on his relationship with Gahara, and like she said he's really just got zero interest in dating anybody except her.  It kinda seemed like she was speaking directly to the fans asking, "Hey, he could do so much better, why doesn't Araragi ditch the ball and chain and go out with one of the nice girls?"  Cuz to him she's just perfect.
>> ARTICLE
>Well, the anime is hurt by Kizu not coming out yet.

Plot wise, not really. In pretty much everything else, yeah.

But yeah he made up his mind way back in Neko:Kuro when he realized how imperfect she was.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit that voice acting. That was fantastic. I am in awe of how she went into all ragey ranting mode. Interestingly she picked up on the mannerism of the snake of "huh?" 

I did wonder why she valued her bangs so much but it shows that she was using it to cover her face and basically armoring herself from outside intrusion. With it cut she has nothing restraining her anymore. Interesting symbolism that. Also her hair is all rising up like snakes when she's all riled which is another interesting thing. 

And of course Araragi has the snake talisman used as a bookmark for his porn books.

it's a lot more stressful for a love that could be, since you actually have to worry about rejection rather than having it as a given.

[Spoilers?](/s "Something with Araragi and Karen (or Tsukihi I really can't remember) about feet and toes, I can't remember exactly what and then in Hanamonogatari it's implied by Kanbaru that Araragi and Karen have been spending too much personal time together to the point where it worries her that they might be breaking the law. It doesn't really go into detail it's just mentioned.")

EDIT: [Spoiler](/s "Oh and Araragi would pretty much do anything to make it possible so that he could marry Karen. In Hanamonogatari when Kanbaru asks him what he'd wish for he goes on for a bit to say he'd wish he could make it legal to be with his sister but then he's says that's too much so he goes on about making it so that Karen isn't really his sister but then retorts by saying that'd take the 'feeling' away and I can't remember what he settles on...")
>> ARTICLE
They seem to have a way to make strange things turn pervy. Like with the toothbrush scene. Although now that i think about it. Do you think that Tsukihi was jealous of Karen during that scene since she does seem to like to sleep in his bed.
>> ARTICLE
Well not "they", rather just Isin is a huge perv. He said he sort of projects himself onto Araragi. Toothbrush scene isn't all pervyness though. It's surprisingly "insightful".

Probably, Tsukihi wanted Araragi to kiss her again at the end of Nise so...it makes sense that she would be jealous.

I'm glad that Araragi realizes Karen is best girl.

Alright, time for another pretty, piercing episode of Monogatari. This arc has certainly not been a light-hearted one - pretty much the entire running time has been split between Nadeko being told off for acting passive and playing the victim and Nadeko secretly agreeing with her snake-shaped other selfs assessment of everyone else being the problem. As always, the apparition is just an unwanted, unacknowledged, or unaddressable part of your true self, and Im really interested in seeing how they resolve this. Outside of Nadekos passivity, what is there *to* her? Well, the resentment towards others and possible underlying guilt, represented through the snake. Her childlike obsession with Araragi, whos probably only appealing as a caretaker anyway. Her adolescent need to belong, and equally adolescent faux-sophisticated love of retro media. When you make her address her false self, whos she even going to be?

Lets get to it.

**Episode 14**

0:22 - [I love the absurdist glimpses of Araragis *normal* home life.](http://i.imgur.com/NKACy3X.png) Nadeko calls Tsukihi and wakes her up while Araragis watching her sleep. Tsukihi wakes up in her brothers bed and is only surprised *Nadeko* is there

1:02 - [Looks like Shinobus tirade got to her.](http://i.imgur.com/1BzWd6n.png) But shes still interpreting it to make herself look better - its not Im sorry for just coasting on helplessness and a cute face, its Im not cute

1:41 - [This cant be helping](http://i.imgur.com/FuVRGo8.png)

1:58 - [Is it easier or worse from a friend?](http://i.imgur.com/YsywUyB.png)

3:02 - [Goddamnit, was I supposed to be pointing out the hair?](http://i.imgur.com/ul4tCxO.png) Hairs a thing here, isnt it? Damnit, ya got me, Isin

Also, Tsukihis doing great work here. No one else has actually tried to make her own up to her feelings

3:10 - [Cute little line.](http://i.imgur.com/cr3ShsH.png) Its more of a marker of her insecurities than you know, Tsukihi!

4:05 - [I feel like this episode is telling us more about Tsukihis personality than her own entire arc did.](http://i.imgur.com/Gz3ihuy.png) Typical Araragi, making arcs from his perspective all about himself

7:20 - [I like this frame.](http://i.imgur.com/ACGXW6q.png) Its great how theyre visually juggling Tsukihis blunt but still ostensibly lighthearted view of this conversation with the near-panic attack Nadekos undergoing with each new line

8:53 - [Theyre using the pajamas for some nicely colored frames](http://i.imgur.com/jC1vxgV.png). I like how the lighting of the wall behind Nadeko is bending backwards under the force of Tsukihis questions

10:40 - [Hmm.](http://i.imgur.com/1Q0v2D1.png) So shes saying Nadekos crush is an implicit rejection of and turning away from her unsatisfying reality. I dont know if we needed this whole conversation, but its certainly reframing the theme and pushing Nadeko further than the prior ones

12:33 - [Man is she ever insecure. *Thats* her bargain?](http://i.imgur.com/a8DCtdU.png)

13:14 - [True selves identity yada yada](http://i.imgur.com/WJDRRID.png)

13:28 - [Theres that critical light again.](http://i.imgur.com/VI8esez.jpg) Nadeko alone in the spotlight, forced into a position of honesty and true self

14:30 - [Oh my god yes its amazing.](http://i.imgur.com/i0r2Ieg.jpg) Go Nadeko go (go HanaKana, for that matter)

Hah! They even have her absorb the snakes eeeh?!

15:08 - [Yesss let it all out](http://i.imgur.com/TwtqlmN.png). That must feel pretty satisfying

15:53 - [This is so fantastic.](http://i.imgur.com/APUNqFu.jpg) Her hairs getting pretty pissed

15:59 - [I love all these expressions](http://i.imgur.com/bwH3HSn.jpg)

16:07 - [And again](http://i.imgur.com/xfgdxBf.png). Just wonderful

16:13 - [Yep, Tsukihis speech did the trick](http://i.imgur.com/QQk31o9.png)

16:23 - [Perhaps a tiny bit of projecting](http://i.imgur.com/gATf6pT.png)

17:43 - [What a colorful world she lives in now](http://i.imgur.com/ECgEMIL.jpg)

18:23 - [Another nice shot.](http://i.imgur.com/gtXSo5i.jpg) Theyre so aggressive with their interpretive style, foregrounding those detail-stricken posts

18:41 - [And one more.](http://i.imgur.com/xpTvioP.jpg) So much symmetry, but its broken by that curiously designed building

18:53 - [Now she actively asks to look for his object in the daytime, her time.](http://i.imgur.com/KqbtmMv.jpg) The door is opened

21:15 - [This episode is the best](http://i.imgur.com/G0q8HVH.jpg)

**And Done**

Ahhhh what a good episode. I initially felt the first half was possibly going overboard on the lectures, but then pretty much every point Tsukihi brought up was directly mirrored in that fantastic second half. And that explosion! Man was that satisfying - both the facial animation and HanaKanas performance were just outstanding, and the whole scene just felt like a perfect release to the nervous tension theyve been building all through this arc. Very excited for the finale

-old posts are [here](http://wrongeverytime.com/)-
>> ARTICLE
> Hah! They even have her absorb the snakes eeeh?!

It's probably worth noting that Nadeko is also referring to herself as "ore-sama" in that scene. Even though she owns up to the outburst after the fact, it's pretty clear the snake is still pulling the strings.

And/or she is the snake in some sense.

I really hope that gets a second season. It's like a show I never really think or talk about but whenever it's brought up I remember how good it was and feel like rewatching it.
>> ARTICLE
For me, this solidly defines Monogatari Second Season as surpassing and going far beyond previous seasons and cementing it's place in what I consider to be among the best anime I have ever seen.

Yeah, it may seem like I am jumping the gun, we are only halfway through the season, but I have been withholding stating this opinion for a long time. I first really thought this upon the conclusion of Nekomonogatari:Shiro. This show delves into the psychological material I am intrigued by which also effects me (as well as many other people) in such a perceptive and tangible way. Using Oddities as representations of mental issues is one thing, but to handle it so masterfully? That deserves something *far* greater. This arc of Nadeko Medusa combined with Neko:Shiro are probably my crowning highlights of what Monogatari can really do when it tries.


^(Tl;DR: I ramble incoherent thoughts about why I like this show.)
>> ARTICLE
oh don't worry, if this keeps up and they crown it with a Hitagi arc or something interesting of the likes.. this is the only monogatari i deem worthy for a 10/10. gotta wait for that ending though.. i do get the feeling she will show up and pulverize Nadeko bossmode, though it's just guessing.
>> ARTICLE
My 'watching' ratings are tentative, rating it relatively to what else is airing, I felt it was a 10 compared to what was in Summer season.

Although at this point, I can't really see them having enough faults to cancel out what they have already achieved, so it is unlikely I will change that score when it ends.

On a side note, I still consider Bake and Nise 10-worthy. Just that this one surpasses them. Still think Nise is close to it in quality.


>> ARTICLE
I agree, I've had the same feeling but in my case it really hit me on episode 1 on Neko:Shiro and I'm glad I wasn't wrong about this being such a great show.
>> ARTICLE
I legitimately think Neko:Shiro episode 4(?) (whenever he appears to help Black Hanekawa) was the best episode from a Monogatari series I have seen.

>For me, this solidly defines Monogatari Second Season as surpassing and going far beyond previous seasons and cementing it's place in what I consider to be among the best anime I have ever seen.

I had this feeling at the end of the Mayoi Jiangshi arc. I wanted to stand up and applaud at the end of the episode I liked it so much. I'm not being overly dramatic either, I honestly had the urge to stand up and clap at the screen. That kind of tangible honest response has never happened to me with any other anime other than Monogatari.

I pretty much didn't understand the point of Mayoi Jiangshi arc, can you please explain? D;

Dat Nadeko, you always got to be wary of the quiet, unassuming girls. Maybe I missed it, but I wonder what triggered this change in her personality, the snake, or her love for Araragi. I'm assuming she's in love with him too and this is her yandere side coming out.

while this episode was as perfect as every other one in this new season i feel the need to comment on one particular item, a curiosity if you will: Tsukihi.

she didn't get much exposure overall, despite the fact she had an arc "dedicated" which ended up being really about [rescuing her](http://a66c7b.medialib.glogster.com/noctislover122/media/4c/4c84c3913d715f05cef60375850f3bc797179ab2/nisemonogatari-11-3-1.gif); she also had [the best/cutest opening ever.](http://1-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/a/image/1343/13/1343132061471.gif) 

Shuraragi consulted her on matters concerning love before and now she's lecturing Nadeko on the subject while keeping [tabs on her brother.](http://i.imgur.com/07znEL8.png)
the interesting bit (to me anyway) was what she said about [Hitagi](http://i.imgur.com/DNd98DE.png) and [Koyomi](http://i.imgur.com/4ILjM3D.png) which plainly means "she's his only option, he's the most ill fit option for her". 

given the amount of truth that parts from her lips that got me to think it might be relevant for upcoming scenes between the two. due to her resemblence to [Mamaragi](http://i.imgur.com/HLCn3wQ.png) i don't doubt she'll eventually become [Araragi Hitagi](http://ghsanimeclub.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/12days09d2_3.jpg) but it certainly speaks to some possible tension between the two. why would he be less than everyone else for her?

i seriously can't wait for this season to end so i can marathon everything once again.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. I wasn't expecting such a transformation from Nadeko this episode.

Absolutely fantastic! I think I can safely say that I prefer the shows constant jump of narration rather than safely sticking with Araragi. It really brings the entire cast to life, and adds so much more depth to each of the characters.

I really like the monogatari series. But god damn it takes forever to watch the episodes. How do you guys read the screen caps? I have to pause and go back a shit ton of times. Some of those only last 0,0000001 seconds. Hard as hell to read.

Well, it appears I was [wrong](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1nbjgk/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cchi4rm) after all, apparently she knew about Senjougahara and she didn't snap because of it. It's the Tsukihi (who cut her own hair, probably to mimic Hitagi lol) power to be damn scary and perceptive also a bit of hair cutting. I loved this episode and this season is just fucking epic. When I started with Bakemonogatari, I never thought I'd love it so much, but here I am, thinking it will not get boring and repetitive any time soon.

>> ARTICLE
As someone who has watched Bakemonogatari and nisemonogatari, i just do not enjoy the whole show in general. Is this show supposed to be just an ecchi fan service show or is there actually something deeper? I mean..the story just doesn't exist to me. So, someone who actually enjoys the show, explain to me why you like it?

Edit: Downvoted for asking a question? Damn guys, express your opinions with words.
>> ARTICLE
I think if you just watched it for the fanservice you'd be disappointed, but maybe I'm wrong and there are fans who enjoy it mainly for that reason. I could go on for a while why I think the fanservice in it is different to the normal bouncy-bouncy in your average action-shounen shows, but that'd be biased and boring anyways. And unimportant.

I'm a sucker for character-centric stories. Really fleshed out personalities, their struggles and change. And love. So what fascinates me here is the same as in Aku no Hana, Hyouka, the Tatami Galaxy and Sakamichi no Apollon.

There really is no story in the sense that something is happening in the world and the characters have to deal with it (yet?). Monogatari may look like that sometimes and I guess that is where some go in and expect something about monsters and a overarching plotline leading up to something connected to them. But what it all comes down to is that all the oddities/ apparations/ whatever you want to call them are just there to externalize the psychology of the character the respective arc is about. The current episodes are not about freeing Nadeko from a snake god. They are about Nadeko - and that's it. The snake is merely a means to tell her story.

These "no-story" shows are usually pretty niche and not everyone's cup of tea. That's just natural. Imo Monogatari just grabbed a lot of people with the Shaft brand, fanservice and unique style in art and storytelling and managed to make them care for the characters along the way. And once there's some hype, it keeps growing on its own.
>> ARTICLE
> the story just doesn't exist to me

The story is the characters, in a sense.

There is no overarching "plot" of the show. There are individual character arcs that rely very heavily on interaction and dialogue and result in character development. This is pretty obvious with Sengoku for example.

Also, "fan service" is something that is unnecessary but exists for the fans. Extensive transformation scenes in mecha shows are fanservice as well.

This is just a show that is about teenagers and doesn't exactly shy away from the role sexuality plays in their lives. A lot of shows feature a girl trying to win a guy, but do a lot of them show seduction in a realistic fashion instead of oops fall accidental boob grab?
>> ARTICLE
"accidental"...
>> ARTICLE
[Major Spoilers for Monogatari](/s "There is an overarching plot, it's just not entirely prevalent at the moment. After the end of this story involving Nadeko, a huge plot that'd been developing since (IIRC) Tsubasa Tiger will start to be brought to light.")
>> ARTICLE
But you can see how that's very different from let's say Geass, where the characters' motivation and the parts they play is clear, and every episode advances the plot in an obvious fashion. That is not the case in Monogari, which reads as a series of stories connected by characters.
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched Nekomonogatari:Kuro?

Also, I enjoy the show because of the characters of course. The show itself though justifies all it shows very well. This mostly goes for Nisemonogatari, but I assure you that pretty much all of the fan-service in the show is not just pandering or without purpose. ~~There's a post in /r/araragi that goes into detail about this, I'll link it soon.~~ [Here it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/18p3lt/nisemonogatari_and_the_nature_of_fanservice/)[ Here's another one](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1hke5f/blood_ties_and_nekomonogatari/) that also proves to be interesting.

The show does go deeper. The characters are being fleshed out in this current season and we're going deeper into the idea that is the oddities. The show explains so many psychological factors and actually deals with real issues with plenty of comical relief from the heavy stuff. Because it's so character driven, many of the plot points in the show stem from each individual's state of mind and history. Another huge thing about this show is point of view. It's easy to forget that the Bake and Nise are being told from Araragi's (a perverted lolicon) PoV. In this season, this camera has changed and gives better perspective of the world around the cast as a whole. Compare the PoV's and you'll get why the fanservice isn't *really* fanservice. 

I think another part of my enjoyment of the series comes from the fact that I've read the LNs which really do go deeper into each character. I can safely say that SHAFT has stayed **very** true to the LNs with only cutting a very, very few number of important character developing monologues. 

Overall though, I find the show to be enjoyable because of the art style and well developed cast of characters as well as the unique and very interesting story-telling style.

Great episode I loved all of the developments. I'm really liking where this is heading but I have a bit of a sense of dread for what's going to happen in the next episode. :(

Anywho, that last sequence with Tsubasa taking pictures of herself was so [cute!](http://imgur.com/a/4hK6I#0)

I loved mamaragi. It really got the point across when she was tellin off Hanekawa. "It would be different if you just left and asked to become a part of someone else's family, but you didn't even do that". Same thing Senjogahara told her about not asking for help.

It's scary how alike Mamaragi and Gahara-san are. 

I entirely agree though.

Not to mention Karen and Tsukihi's apparent shared taste in men that remind them of Koyomi.

Oh god...that's right. It would be cute in a way, but because of the toothbrushing thing and Koyomi attacking Tsukihi in Nise, it just makes it so wrong.

The "be careful with fire" stickers on the wall of Senjougahara's place really start to stand out now. On another note, she's managed to fold a thousand cranes in record time owing to her worry for Hanekawa's safety.

first off, Araragi's mom is a FOX! 

second, I think it is really interesting how different this show is from Hanekawa's perspective compared to Araragi's. 

third, i cant wait to see what Gaen and Episode are planning, i honestly hope that Kaiki shows up because i love how he talks and i love his theme music even more.

>> ARTICLE
Not all. From what I know, only Kizu and Neko (Black & White) have been fully translated, since they were of most importance (as Bake v1 & v2 etc. were animated - not even Bake v1 has been fully translated).

You can find the volunteer driven translation process over at Baka-Tsuki.

The next novel Kabuki is around 50%, though we will see the arc in anime after an episode or two.
>> ARTICLE
Gaen specifically said Kaiki and Oshino were not there, and she knows everything. I haven't read the books, but don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
Can't believe how many Shaft tropes they managed to sneak into that short scene with Koyomi's mom.

Now that the OP is playing again, I really have to say that it has grown on me, and is definitely one of my favourites. I always appreciate how Shaft gets the voice actors to sing the songs for their own character arcs.

It's at about the reading level of 7th grade books. Think "Lightning Thief" or "Hunger Games". You can read it in an hour or two.

In case anyone is wondering, here is the [cover of the light novel](http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/images/1/14/Neko_White_000.jpg). Same clothes and everything. 
>> ARTICLE
Aw man, she ripped the clothes.
>> ARTICLE
I can't really stress enough how well they are adapting this from the LNs, they are keeping the pace up while staying as true as possible to the novel.

If you only watch the anime, you may not think most of the actions and things people are doing are actually things that are in the novel but they are. For example the way Araragi's room is set up in the anime is almost exactly as its described in the novel, even the blimp which I had originally thought to be one of Shaft's artistic additions is described. I don't know why this is a big deal to me but I was pretty impressed when I found out how many things were not just Shaft being Shaft, but were legitimate parts of the set and story.

Though character wise I pictured Gaen to be older than she was portrayed, and I pictured Araragi's mother to be a bit different (I loved the ahoge), but Episode was right on, down to the crosses on his uniform.
>> ARTICLE
Except the novels didn't skip Kizu :P
>> ARTICLE
Kizu is going to be a movie though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but those of us who haven't read the novels don't know what happened so characters like Mr Episode can be a bit disorienting.
>> ARTICLE
A bit, but they're also mentioning how many chapters are being "skipped", which at least informs the viewer that there is missing content that will be filled in in the future. As someone who hasn't read the novel, it's making me more eager to see Kizu.
>> ARTICLE
if you're talking about the 28 to 52 that's part of the original neko white and not a reference to kizu. The chapters of Neko white literally have a skip like that haha
>> ARTICLE
The way I wrote that is a bit difficult to understand, even for me re-reading it lol. Mostly meant that there's a lot of random things that are left out in the anime [and in the novels] that will be filled in later. Obviously the biggest being that Kizu hosts the beginning of the entire story, and the story has been building off that skipped timeline for a long time. While Episode coming into the picture is a bit odd, they mostly explained his appearance knowing that the anime viewers have no idea who he is.
>> ARTICLE
The writer really has some damn good visualization.
>> ARTICLE
One of the most subtly amusing things about this episode is that we finally get to know the name of the damned park. Koyomi could never figure out how to read the kanji, but *of course* Hanekawa knows.
>> ARTICLE
She knows everything!
>> ARTICLE
She doesn't know everything, only what she knows
>> ARTICLE
Apparently she knows nothing.
>> ARTICLE
No shit she knows nothing compared to someone who literally knows everything. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't tell if Gaen is just impossibly cocky or if she's actually omniscient. She seemed surprised to see that Hanekawa was in the park which would imply that even she isn't perfect. I look forward to seeing more of her though.
>> ARTICLE
You know nothing Hanekawa-snow
>> ARTICLE
She doesn't know anything.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm glad Senjougahara came to the same conclusion about the houses burning down that I did. Now I hope she's not stubborn enough to sit in her own house all night.

Is it just me or did the Araragi mom have that same forceful air of Senjougahara? Kind of explains that relationship.

All this talk of Oshino's college days... spinoff please. The Gaen lady (possibly Kanbaru's mom, aunt, sister, cousin?) seemed to really strike a nerve in Hanekawa with that whole "you don't know anything" atittude. Completely opposite of the normal "you really know everything don't you".

She cant be Kanbaru's mom because her parents are dead (as stated in ep 7 in Bake). My money is on cousin/aunt

Karen and Tsukihi's answer to Hanakawa about what their boyfriends are like is one of my favorite parts of the novel, and it's hilarious to see them answer so emphatically but also oblivious about their brother complex.

Surprisingly, as a non-novel reader it wasn't too confusing, I recognised the Gaen name from when it was mentioned in Nisemonogatari. I am very curious as to why this other guy is called Episode (don't tell me though) but Monogatari is very good at dropping us into a situation or introducing new characters very spontaneously, so it wasn't a problem.

(Subs seemed to make a mistake, they wrote Yoduru, I am sure the chick from Nise was called Yodzuru?) Nope, infact it is [Yozuru](http://myanimelist.net/character/57501/Yozuru_Kagenui)
>> ARTICLE
It's originally  (Yozuru) where  (zu) is the "voiced consonant" version of  (tsu).  The problem here is that most rows go like this:  
->   
ka ki ku ke ko -> ga gi gu ge go  
etc etc  
but then we have the t-line:  
  ->   
ta chi tsu te to -> da ... ???  

There are multiple systems of conversion from Japanese to the Latin alphabet, and with names people kind of pick whichever they like the most. The most [common version](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization) goes:  
ta chi tsu te to -> da ji zu de do  
but you could just as well do:  
ta ti tu te to -> da di du de do  

In short, it's a mess, and the translator might prefer [Nihon-shiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon-shiki_romanization) romanization. Consistency is key.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't 'how does it sound' the key here? I you were to hear somebody say  or  without knowing whey might be speaking different language and you being English speaking, how would you write down that sound you've just heard?
If I write this pair 'ji' and 'di' they sound different when read in english, but they both represent only one sound  in original. (Actually, do they sound different?) Which reading is the correct one? Which should therefore be used for transcription? The same goes with 'zu' and 'du'.
>> ARTICLE
There's no official or universally accepted romanisation for Japanese. So usually the correct spelling is whatever the studio names them. They normally do give romanised names to them. But arguing which is correct is kind of pointless. 

Anyway, (ji) and (dji) sound the same in Tokyo dialect. Same with (zu) and (dzu). But it's regional. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yotsugana
>> ARTICLE
What I meant is when you look away form Japanese for a while and look at 'ji' and 'di' with eyes of an English speaking person and try to read it out aloud, how does it sound? And when you compare both sounds to someone speaking Japanese , which one of 'ji' or 'di' comes closer?
>> ARTICLE
If you ask me, I'd say it still doesn't matter. Sometimes certain sounds don't exist in English so you will never be able to represent them accurately. For example, the name Akira is usually pronounced Uh-kee-rah instead of Ah-kee-rah by an English speaker.
>> ARTICLE
Context clues and the words they use before that help. If you know what kind of word their saying, you'll know when to use  as zu and not using  as zu.

It also helps that when people pronounce , they pronounce it as dzu, like a very quick D sound and zu instead of just saying zu straight of the bat.

Now, ji is just a mess. It can either be  or  and they sound exactly alike. Common form is  and the uncommon is , so most people don't use . Plus, some people pronounce  as Dji, with a D in front of it (same was as dzu).
>> ARTICLE
I think they give just enough for people to not be too lost. They really should have released Kizu before this new season though, it would've worked way better :(

As for Karen and Tsukihi's complex...I laughed at Hanekawa's reaction. It was priceless. 
>> ARTICLE
A non-novel reader here, can confirm I was confused.

I was legitimately excited that the series was introducing new characters which included somebody who could potentially hunt Shinobu, only to find out that... well... they weren't really new.

Well Gaen is new, but not Episode. Bakemonogatari episode 1 opens with some Kizumonogatari flashbacks, and Episode is in them. But it's probably really difficult to associate Bake episode 1 with Episode now, 4 years later. 

Edit: How do I talk about episodes and Episode in the same comment without confusing even myself??

> Well Gaen is new, but not Episode. Bakemonogatari episode 1 opens with some Kizumonogatari flashbacks, and Episode is in them. But it's probably really difficult to associate Bake episode 1 with Episode now, 4 years later.

Non-novel reader here. The flashbacks in Bakemonogatari ep. 1 has always confused me. IIRC, the only explanation we got was "some stuff happened over spring break and now Araragi has some residual vampire power and hangs out with Oshino and something something something Shinobu."


>> ARTICLE
Kizumonogatari is a great read and not very long, so I recommend that if you are interested in the beginning of the relationship between Araragi, Shinobu, Hanekawa, and Oshino, to go ahead and give it a read. Otherwise, it will be a very long wait for the as-of-yet unreleased movie adaptation of Kizumongatari to even make it to the west. 

The clever thing is that the books/show are continuously written without having to have knowledge about the events in Kizu (Nise, for example, came out after Kizu). But as you mentioned, you get a feeling of being left in the dust.

>> ARTICLE
Gaen definitely foils Hanekawa very well. 

The past seasons had always been "I don't know everything, I just know what I know", where now that's being completely dismantled to "I don't know anything at all". Introducing Gaen here I think will help Hanekawa grow as a person, which in turn should help with her Tiger dilemma.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say Gaen is the opposite of Hanekawa herself, while Episode is the opposite of Araragi. Gaen is all self confidence and claimed omniscience which is counter to Hanekawa's catchphrase of "I don't know everything, I just know what I know." Meanwhile Mr. Episode is like dark-world Araragi, he's a half vampire but he's completely interested in personal gain, not to mention he wears all white and has blonde hair to oppose Araragi's usual black getup.
>> ARTICLE
If 'sode is there to hunt Shinobu, man we're gonna be in for a treat. 

I concur with the Gaen statement, she seems like a really interesting character, they did a pretty good job of introducing her. I'm excited to see what she has to offer. That's a mad cool style she has too.

I guess she figures Hanekawa needs some tough love here - but what does this character actually know? Well, this *is* Monogatari, every character will generally know everything they need to know about anyone elses exact mental state for the current arcs point to be made.

I also liked the shift from Hanekawa happily adopting the fake family role given to her by the sisters, and then her equally quick shift back to I didnt help Araragi. My situation isnt a big deal when the mother calls her on her pretending

6:10 - A new (old?) [challenger approaches](http://i.imgur.com/J4ZVz0G.jpg)?

6:59 - We are getting so [spoiled on visual design](http://i.imgur.com/E5MxlBt.jpg) this season

7:32 - Im a half-vampire freelance vampire hunter, if the cash is good. A half-vampire spirit detective who works only for personal gain and dresses in all white with blond hair. So hes an intentionally blatant foil for Araragi?

10:02 - Goddamnit Isin. You lead an episode up to some kind of confrontation and resolution involving Neko, Shinobu, Araragi, and Kanbaru in the ruins of the old construction site, then skip like twenty chapters so Hanekawa can interrupt a meeting between a bunch of people weve never seen before. This is some high-quality trolling right here

10:52 - Theres nothing I dont know. *She said it, so full of confidence.* Hanekawas getting run over this arc, jeez. Now theyre even belittling her catchphrase?

11:25 - Is it just me, or is this episode going [insane](http://i.imgur.com/RI7NVQJ.jpg) with the head tilts?

It also seems like they really are gonna address some of Hanekawas fundamental issues. Theyre finally demanding she deal with a problem herself, and not look away, pretend everything is normal, and let either Neko or Araragi fix everything

11:27 - You dont even know that you dont know anything. *Shes doing that on purpose!*

12:07 - [Another beautiful one.](http://i.imgur.com/BZBzJTC.jpg) I could make a damn gallery out of this, Uchouten Kazoku, and Gatchaman Crowds

14:40 - Their names are the same. Its a bit too clever to be a coincidence. Oh Senjougahara, you and your lack of respect for the fourth wall

15:05 - Trauma... oh, that sounds like a pun. Jeez, I bet this scene was fun to translate

16:04 - The places where you spent the night burned down. Alright, thats confirmed. ...or at least its confirmed that Isin *wants* us to think thats the link

18:08 - Id associate fire with a heart in love. Hm. The self-deception stuff is already covered by Neko, and she already *admits* shes in love with Araragi. Hm...

19:47 - [The worst face.](http://i.imgur.com/ASqgGV8.png) Goddamnit Fire Sisters...

**And Done**

Envy? Really that simple? Hm.

Well, this arc has definitely done good work in humanizing Hanekawa, though it feels like every single character becomes more like a human being when Araragi isnt around (except for those damn Fire Sisters). And now shes writing a letter to herself, which is a pretty cute way to make a connection - but she still hasnt admitted that she *is* Black Hanekawa, and that this other side of her isnt an aberration, its just the other half (or possibly majority) of her emotions. Shes also taking a pretty half-assed approach to resolving her feelings for Araragi, at least so far - hopefully next episode will resolve this with a little more fireworks.

See, I told you I would probably be way off in my predictions for the resolution. Because

Wasn't Episode 4 supposed to be the last episode of Nekomonogatari: Shiro?

EDIT: Never mind, apparently Neko: Shiro is not finished yet.

Didn't they cut a Kanbaru arc from this season?  Maybe they threw an extra episode into the other arcs.

That's very possible, and I actually hope that's the case.

>I could make a damn gallery out of this, Uchouten Kazoku, and Gatchaman Crowds

If you don't, I just might start. The Madoka movies kind of rekindled that idea for me as well.

In note to the imagery I loved the contrast between rainbow omniscient Gaen and fully shadowed Episode (other than the gleaming light on his eyes).

Where does this series take place chronologically?

I haven't read the novels, but from what I understand the chronology is Kizu (still just a novel)->Neko Black->Bake->Nise->This

"You say ittekimasu  typically when you leave home for school, work, a trip, or whatever reason. Literally, it means "I'll go and come back," You can also say it when you leave a place that you regard more or less as home."

Not staying with her parents is suspicious, but the wording she uses makes it apparent. Hanekawa also gives herself away when she says "There's just a little bit of a falling out". Basically Hanekawa herself has provided most of the necessary information for Mamaragi's analysis, though I'm guessing her being a police officer would make her more sensitive to those kind of issues. 
>> ARTICLE
> bunch of people weve never seen before.

Can't really put *all* the blame with Isin on this one, Episode is supposed to be familiar with the audience at this point, since he was introduced in an earlier novel. It's just that Shaft hasn't gotten around to finishing Kizu yet.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'd read comments mentioning how there might be issues down the line based on Kizu not being animated yet, but I'd kinda assumed they'd try to work around that in some way outside of "fuck you, read the book." Not that it's actually a serious problem - context would help, but these characters still work fine as "an antagonist from Hanekawa's past who she still acts her unnaturally pristine self towards" and "another of the spirit-world heavyweights here to drop some science on Hanekawa."
>> ARTICLE
Wow that was super interesting.

I'm still kinda lost on what exactly is wrong with Hanekawa - Is she jealous? In love? It sucks that some of the symbolism/plot is going over my head. Could anyone help me out?

Also really hoping that Hanekawa didn't just set a death flag...
>> ARTICLE
It will be explained next episode. Don't worry.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, we're sure to get a good ol' fashioned exposition dump from Araragi or Hanekawa at the end of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh. I thought it was explained and i'm too stupid to undestand. Thank you.
>> ARTICLE
Great thanks
>> ARTICLE
These past few episodes were some of my favorites out everything I've watched from Bake/Nise/Nekomonogatari.

I wouldn't mind if the entire rest of the series just focused Hanekawa (Or Senjougahara) as the MC and forgot about Araragi or whatever the main plot of the series is going to be. She's just seems that much more interesting to me. 
>> ARTICLE
Araragi does take a backseat for quite a bit. Nisioisin definitely focused more on the other characters in the later novels. 

It's a good change of pace but I really enjoy Araragi so I would be disappointed if they forgot about him completely.

Plus his story gets pretty interesting itself. 
>> ARTICLE
I would watch a series entirely about senjougahara
>> ARTICLE
I love how Karen couldn't manage to build her card house more than a few cards high because she kept stomping around and punching the air, meanwhile Tsukihi and Hanekawa both had them up to like three or four feet by the end.

I don't think he really will in this arc :(

I actually did picture Episode to be a bit younger than he was shown, but maybe that's just the time difference. Also, is Episode's VA the same one that does Accelerator? MAL hasn't added him yet and he gives me that vibe.

It's a bit easier to see in the LN, but Episode speaks like a child. His little "that's hilarious" catch phrase is something a middle schooler would say.

I've read the LN's availible but I can't wait to see it when I get home!!! Shafts scenery porn is some of the favorite of all time, and I love this set of charecters.

As someone who's only watched the animes and never read Kizu, can someone tell me who Episode and Gaen are?

Gaen is a relatively new character, she has some relation to Kanbaru, and is Oshino's senpai. Only that much is really known.

As for [Episode,](/s "he's one of the vampires that stole Shinobu's limbs in Kizu, he and Hanekawa are acquainted because he almost killed her during the fight between him and Koyomi.")

Finally normal clothes Hanekawa!

sent those pics to araragi to the boot.

To clarify some concerns raised in this thread. Aniplex wants to put their titles on as many outlets as possible for people to watch. Their top priority is their own streaming site (through hulu), but all of their titles are also available through Crunchyroll as well since they will sublicense streaming rights to Crunchy.

Aniplex titles on Crunchy fall under two categories: 
1. Crunchyroll-subtitled shows 
2. Aniplex-subtitled shows. 

The former are true simulcasts as CR will get the video/scripts and subtitle it through their own staff and put up soft-subtitled videos. These shows are shown in Sony (of Japan)'s E! television block on Saturday nights at midnight. Past shows in this timeslot include Fate/Zero, Nisemonogatari, Sword Art Online, OreShura, and OreImo S2. These shows may be available to stream outside NA.

The Aniplex-subtitled shows are also in two categories: 
1. Currently airing shows are delayed a couple days for Bang Zoom to translate/hardsubtitle the episodes before they're put up on Crunchy/Hulu/etc.
2. Catalog titles which were never streamed before like Bakemonogatari and Madoka Magica. 

Both categories are subbed by Bang Zoom and will only be available in the US and Canada. Any additional disc-only episodes will not be streamed since they're meant to sell discs, not be seen on "broadcast."

Nekomonogatari (Black) will fall under the second Aniplex-subtitled category. Thus it'll be subtitled by Bang Zoom and be hardsubbed/available only in NA. The Monogatari Series Second Season is in the midnight Sat. E! timeslot, so it'll be Crunchyroll-subtitled and simlucast on the same day it airs in Japan (though it may be delayed a couple hours like OreShura/OreImo were).
>> ARTICLE
For those who were wondering, Aniplex USA hosts their videos both on [their website](http://aniplexchannel.com/) and on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/companies/aniplex). Bake and Nise are already there (although Bake is *still* missing the three final episodes that were BD-only, damn it).
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
That's an illegal streaming site - you're not meant to mention them on here!
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I didn't know.
>> ARTICLE
It will probably be on [Daisuke](https://www.daisuki.net/) too since Aniplex owns part of it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It would probably be there even if Aniplex USA didn't host it.
>> ARTICLE
And those 3 episodes are so important to seeing shinobu in nisemono.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention all of Nekomonogatari. 
>> ARTICLE
Except neko is before bakemono. I mean without those 3 episodes, you won't understand why shinobu appears.
>> ARTICLE
Chronologically, yes, but it is like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya where the show is intended to be seen out of order. You wouldn't watch Touka Gettan backwards just to make it chronological and understand things sooner. 
>> ARTICLE
TMoHS isn't meant to be seen out of order. The TV series was made that way so it had more of a climax while airing. The LNs are overall in chronological order, there are frequent side stories though which just take place out of order, but it can be read in either way easily.
>> ARTICLE
But when it is created by the animation studio, they make it with the intention of being seen out of order, right? 
>> ARTICLE
For the original TV airing in 2006, yes. However in all DVDs the episodes are listed in the correct chronological order (with the Episode 00 first), and when they aired the 2009 episodes the whole show was in chronological order. Basically the only time the weird order was ever used was the original TV broadcast. 
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, I didn't know they did it chronological after that. I might need to try watching it in that order so I can get a new experience. 
>> ARTICLE
Does this news exclude a possible simulcast on Crunchyroll, or will we have to wait to figure that out? Does anyone know?
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll sublicenses streaming rights to Aniplex shows, so they'll have them. Every other Aniplex title has streamed through Crunchy (with only movie/concert exceptions).
>> ARTICLE
Tons of Aniplex shows are on CR, so no.
>> ARTICLE
Well considering both [Bakemonogatari](http://www.crunchyroll.com/bakemonogatari) and [Nisemonogatari](http://www.crunchyroll.com/nisemonogatari) are streamed on Crunchyroll, I'd say it means it'll be on there. Aniplex are very good with whoring out the shows they have rights to, thankfully.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't rule it out entirely. CR has gotten simulcast titles that other companies have gotten at the same time (e.g. Attack on Titan and Valvrave the Liberator). However a definite answer will require confirmation from either CR or Aniplex.
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense. Here's hoping for the best then!
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad aniplex upgraded its players to libx264/aac but without soft subs, its lagging behind even crunchyroll.

I don't strictly mind hardsubs, but with how many signs are in the bakemono universe... I doubt they can deliver on quality. That isn't to say that they couldn't do signs and flashing text with softsubs properly, I just feel like they almost certainly won't.
>> ARTICLE
Aniplex? There goes the hope of anyone who may have wanted to buy it later on. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd rather pay Japanese prices to import and actually give my money to the creators than pay Aniplex's bullshit prices for the US market.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't AniplexUSA just the american part of Aniplex?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but they still charge an arm and a leg for their US releases :\
>> ARTICLE
Well, us Brits have been getting all of Aniplex's releases for around 40, which is around $62. Not all of them, but all the big releases like Madoka, Monogatari Series, and probably SAO eventually.
>> ARTICLE
That's one of the only advantages to being a Brit when it comes to anime. We may have to wait slightly longer for titles but we don't have to pay out the ass to get them.

Although I'm still really sad that because of how Kara no Kyoukai and Fate/Zero are handled by them that we won't get them for such a long time, by which point I'm not even sure i'll care enough to purchase them.

Also Kizumonogatari, which is before neko(black) to add to Theonenerd's comment
>> ARTICLE
That's Nekomonogatari(Black), Nisemonogatari is a sequel.
>> ARTICLE
It's a bit confusing. The "second season" is a notion taken from the novels. Bake, Nise, Neko Black, and Kizu are the "first season" novels, while Neko White, Otori, Hana, Kabuki, Oni, and Koi are the "second" season, and those "second season" novels are what are being adapted into a single 2-cour anime.

By the way, there's a third season, which is still in the process of being written (only two novels out yet).

Nise and Neko are short breaks from more Senjougahara fascination.

It's not fanservice though. Fanservice implies that it is only there to please the fans and it could be removed from the show without any impact to the storytelling. The "fanservice" in the monogatari series all serves a thematic or symbolic purpose.

No, I am saying that the fan service has a major role actually. I take it you read kizu?

I am conflicted about this arc. On one hand it has a lot of neat character interaction and development but on the other hand it fills up an episode with a backstory slideshow. While I enjoyed the visuals for that it was much too long for my taste.  
That aside this arc does have a lot to offer. Beyond the obvious development of Araragi and Shinobu as well Hachikuji's relationship a major element here was Yotsugi.  
I think it's important to note that Hachikuji is still acting as the lost cow from time to time, like she is at the start of the episode.  
Being lost in this case isn't not knowing where you are but rather not being where you are supposed to be.
Araragi is supposed to be in school, atending the oppening ceremony. Instead he is with Hachikuji getting her backpack back. As soon as he gives it back to her and prepares to finally go where he is supposed to the darkness strikes.  
Araragi and Hachikuji ride away until they meet Yotsugi. At this point the darkness seems to stop. They mention it's hard to keep track of where it is as it's hard to see but moments ago it was right on top of them and now they have time to chat with Yotsugi while it seems to stay on the sidelines until they escape and it does not follow. 
What was Yotsugi doing there? She had a job from Yozuru but her relationship with her master was strained at the moment. After her defeat at the hands of Shinobu in nise and watching the trust Araragi and Shinobu had she grew envious when compared to her own relationship with Yozuru. You can see her act out on those feelings by trying to clumsily hit on Araragi and even stepping on his shadow, the place where Shinobu lives. Needless to say it does work and Shinobu comes out pissed and when Yotsugi shows up again they have a bit of a fight.  
The important part to note here though is that Yotsugi is supposed to be out doing her job, instead she is avoiding it and hanging out with Araragi and by extension Hachikuji. The moment Hachikuji and Yotsug met up Hachikuji was once again acting as the lost cow by leading Yotsugi astray. That is why the darkness stopped following them. Yotsugi's problems with Yozuru are in fact what saved them.  
And when does the darkness return? Hachikuji is awake for a good while and it does not show up until Yotsugi tells them that they should go see Gaen. Presumably at this point she has gotten over her feelings and is about to head of to do her job. Once again the darkness instantly appears.  
This causes Yotsugi to decide to stay with them longer and help them escape into the mountains where they then find Gaen and get the resultion of the arc and the cause of the darkness.

Also, holy shit I never read into the whole Yotsugi situation like that. You are pretty damned clever to have caught that and it sounds plausable too.  
Though I don't think Yotsugi had (much) to do with the darkness, because she is essentially a doll. Dolls can only ever move or talk when someone makes them do so(methaphorically)

Well the fact that Yotsugi rescued them is unmistakable. Whether it was because of her state of mind and problems with Yozuru or simply because she managed to whisk them away is debatable.

The changes in perspective as a result of Hanekawa telling the story are so well done. Kanbaru being onscreen for a few minutes without having a sexual angle in the slightest is probably the best example yet.


The other detail I really like is how it's showing the appearance of herself, she doesn't view herself as beautiful and as a result the camera is showing her as rather frumpy, but when Black Hanekawa comes out, the camera goes back to showing her as beautiful since the apparition is the manifestation of her frustrations. 

Compared to Bakemonogatari the symbolism isn't coming off as 3deep5u, and the story isn't quite as fast paced as Nisemonogatari, but it's not awkwardly combining them in the way Nekomonogatari: Black was. So far this season is the perfect mix of both traits by making the artistic depth easy to follow and being paced fast enough to keep it interesting.

Wow, they skipped the OP this week, serious shit is going to go down!

Yes, the first appearance of Kanbaru, my favourite character, I couldn't help but grin crazily throughout this scene, so I will have to rewatch, in-fact, this whole episode is overwhelming with things to discuss.

That Tsukihi hairstyle...... very curious, to say the least. Also, there is a great benefit to having Araragi absent from the show, we get to see a lot of dialogue between characters that would otherwise have no business talking to each other, like Kanbaru + Hanekawa, Senjougahara + Karen, Shinobu + Sawari Neko. It makes for a very interesting change of pace compared to just conversations between Araragi + Girl X.

I'm trying to think of another serious anime that has 2 shower scenes in the first 3 episodes, but I think this show pulls it off well. Also I love when apparitions talk to each other. Even with how polite black hanekawa and shinobu were being, they still were 5 seconds away from ripping each other's throat out
>> ARTICLE
Well..

This show has yet to let me down. This episode was way weird to me seeing all of these characters *actually interact with each other*.
I love it! Seeing Gahara-san manipulate Karen, definitely the funniest part of the episode for me. Hanekawa and Kanbaru though...felt really odd, I never imagined them interacting but now that I did see it, I liked it. 

Shinobu and Black Hanekawa? Wow that was a great scene. Absolutely perfect way to close the episode. Such a tense scene but some how still relaxed. It was surprising at first, I was expecting them to kill each other at any moment, but it boiled down and Shinobu's insight along with Black Hanekawa's casualness really made that scene for me.

That final scene at the cram school though...Whoa. Was not expecting that.

I love how damn abstract the Araragi house is. Huge ass room for a regular bathtub, ladders haphazardly stacked in the living room, Araragi's banana chair/blimp/big sphere things. It's gotta be a cool home to live in.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, were two episodes in and so far the show has basically established Senjougahara feels weird, conflicted, and somewhat defensive about her relationship with Hanekawa, Hanekawa has a justifiably warped perspective on self-worth and the tiger has somehow imprinted on Hanekawa, which seems to be a bad thing and might be related to her house burning down. For a Monogatari series, thats a pretty solid list! I really liked how the end of last weeks episode brought Black Hanekawa and Senjougahara into direct contact, and Im hoping we see more intermingling of the spirit conflict and personal conflict going forward. And were off!

**Episode 3**

0:35 - You both help people, but it feels like youre almost opposites. It feels like Araragi is a fake, and youre the real thing. Oh god, are they going to bring up *every theme of this series* in the *first minute?* I dont have all day, Monogatari

1:24 - Im sure the difference is the grumbling the whole time part. So... Araragi does what hes supposed to because he feels obligated to, whereas that kind of distance doesnt exist for Hanekawa, and she just accepts all responsibilities and burdens as the only way her life could be?

1:48 - If youre a good person, people will exploit you. Thats why Araragi pretends to be a bad person. Shades of Karen Bee here as well. Every single theme indeed

2:19 - You dont feel anything about the ill will people have. You accept them as they are. Youre too pure white. I always got the feeling that Hanekawa just expects people to continuously disappoint her, and that her light and dark sides were much more closely linked than Senjougahara is proposing here

3:00 - You will fail in the wild. Or pour all your negative feelings into some unhealthy release valve. Senjougahara is right here - she needs to embrace both sides of herself simultaneously

3:12 - That feeling when its super hard to rewind and pause to catch all the single-frame text in this stupid simulcast but the text ends up being irrelevant anyway

3:57 - [Their skirt lengths are indicative of their personalities.](http://i.imgur.com/vmJg8rK.jpg) Ive noticed other shows do this too. I dont know if this is actually something you get to choose, or just used as easy visual shorthand in anime

4:21 - And Araragi once again relies on Kanbaru when he actually needs an assistant for one of his adventures. Is this because she has the most in common with him? Because he knows shell look after herself? Because their relationship is the least fraught with weird tension? Actually, yeah, thats probably it - aside from maybe Hachikuji, shes probably the person he shares the most normal friendship with in the series.

5:00 - Theyre very strongly casting this conversation from Kanbarus perspective. [Look](http://imgur.com/01b5krX) at [this](http://imgur.com/4B8H37T) shot [progression](http://i.imgur.com/epA0OO4.jpg). It makes me feel like shes sizing Hanekawa up, and basically pushing on her conversational comfort level in the same way Senjougahara was in the last couple episodes

5:56 - Its unreasonable for me to be mulling over him asking Kanbaru for help (instead of me). And once again she pushes down her justifiable negative emotions

6:27 - To think Araragi would seek that wenchs help over mine. And of course Senjougahara has zero issues admitting this pisses her off

7:21 - You wont go? Then I wont either. Damned if shes gonna let Hanekawa be more mature about this than she is. Not that competing with Hanekawa for maturity points is particularly mature

9:11 - What a coincidence, running into you at your house like this. Did you know Hanekawas house burned down? Of course you did. Senjougahara sure is a subtle one. Im actually liking her character a *lot* more in this series - her strengths and weaknesses are more accurately portrayed when Araragi isnt around

9:30 - She has no place to sleep tonight. Oh god, theres gonna be another bad one, isnt there? Keep it in your goddamn pants, Isin

10:09 - NOT LIKE YOU CAN HELP OR ANYTHING. [This is the best face](http://i.imgur.com/Kfu7Wi6.jpg)

10:55 - So Im now at the Araragi residence. I am extraordinarily apprehensive at the moment. I mean, this is a fine plot development in the abstract, but... just...

12:09 - Oh, dont worry about talking to our parents. They too have a passion for justice. Goddamnit the fire sisters are ridiculous. 

12:44 - Thats a lot of clothes in that hamper. Oh god

14:33 - Whew. That actually worked. It wasnt hammered as a sex joke like the shower scene was - it was a generally neutral and honest conversation (in fact, more honest than most of the conversations in this series), played much in the same way as the Shinobu/Araragi bath scene from Nisemonogatari. Thank you, Shinbou

16:08 - And now [*these two*](http://i.imgur.com/LxXm45a.jpg) get a real conversation? Man, for all that Araragi best MC nonsense, this show sure does get interesting when he isnt around. I love the composition of that shot, by the way

17:55 - I guess the difference between the you before and the current you is like the difference between Terminator and Terminator 2. Thats... surprisingly accurate

17:59 - The cat [absentmindedly bats at the piece of string](http://i.imgur.com/ZOxokAV.jpg) as it talks. These guys must think theyre pretty clever

19:50 - Were the same? That puts me at ease, but also puts a heavy burden on my heart. So is she just relearning the forgotten lessons of Neko Kuro? I figured that movie pretty definitely stated Black Hanekawa was just a convenient way for Hanekawa to set aside the elements of herself she found painful or inconvenient

22:44 - Now [thats an iconic image](http://i.imgur.com/eqeGl4a.jpg)

**And Done**

And Monogatari meanders forward in its own way. A few things I liked in this episode - seeing the relationship between Hanekawa and Kanbaru, the way this arc continues to very frankly humanize Senjougahara, and particularly the meeting between Vampire and Cat. There were a bunch of beautiful shots in that last act, and we learned that Hanekawas tiger is basically an unknown apparition, meaning it might be something self-generated or fake (for whatever thats worth in this series). I have to admit Id gotten pretty attached to that old run-down building, and Im guessing things will be coming to a head shortly. Im eager to see how the potential revelation of whatever Araragis been up to will reflect off Hanekawas tiger - theres obviously the possibility that Hanekawas link with the tiger is responsible for the destruction of both her own home and the old building, which would make the next target Senjougaharas house. Tense stuff!

> Oh god, theres gonna be another bad one, isnt there? Keep it in your goddamn pants, Isin

no idea what you meant there. the whole scene with Hitagi and Karen was reverse psychology 101 used on children. 

> Their skirt lengths are indicative of their personalities.[1]   Ive noticed other shows do this too. I dont know if this is actually something you get to choose,

this is actually something very visible and true in real life as well. 

>Whew. That actually worked.

i don't know what you expected. do you genuinely cringe at the nude scenes anymore? why? ..expecting something hardcore sexual? after two seasons and an OVA i think the presentation style is clear. i don't know how you saw the shower scene as a sex joke since all that was shown is two adolescent girls fondling.

as for the iconic image.. it's a nice perspective shot but for something burned down what's shown looks rather vague. when i first saw all those red lens flares i thought they were relevant: security alarms or apparition seals of a sort.
>> ARTICLE
> Hitagi and Karen scene

Agreed, and I liked that scene. That line was me predicting this plot development meant there'd be another scene like the shower one, but with Hanekawa and the sisters.

> Nudity stuff

I don't expect anything actually serious, but it seems like Shinbou sort of goes on and off between scenes that sexualize characters to actually serve some narrative or meta-storytelling purpose and scenes that are just showing off the characters for the audience. I think he's normally very good about this, but felt that the shower scene was pretty much just pandering - I called it a "sex joke" because I felt the "joke" was the disconnect between Hanekawa high-mindedly philosophizing on their relative emotional development while the camera was solely focusing on their bodies. What is he trying to say there? Is that tied to a specific character's perspective, or making some point? I felt that scene was just tasteless and existed mainly to appease the audience.

Admittedly, the sex appeal of this show is one of its biggest draws for many, but Shinbou normally frames his shots in a way that actually says something or makes sense for the story/characters, and I didn't get that from the shower scene.

> Burned building

I just love the color composition there. This show does incredible work with color in general - I don't have a visual-arts background so I can't articulate it in an intelligent way, but the shot framing and color work is definitely one of my favorite elements of the series.
>> ARTICLE
i already gave my opinion on the shower scene [right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1iox9g/best_lewd_scenes_in_anime/cb6o3hz). 

in this episode's bath scene the sisters' dialogue continue the ongoing discussion on Hanekawa's nature but since they're less experienced she [takes enjoyment](http://i.imgur.com/ibrm83g.jpg) from listening the much younger and inexperienced dynamic duo chat on their perceived smarter senpai comparing her to a celebrity. 

i can't say it had any real purpose but it didn't detract from the presentation either. they were as casual about the nudity as was their familiarity with one another.. unlike Hitagi who had fun discomforting her as one of her peers would.

pretty much agree with everything else you wrote. i can't really find many words to comment on the episodes so far since i just consider them very well made.
>> ARTICLE
This episode's scene I was fine with - it didn't feel invasive, it felt reflective of the honesty and comfort level between the characters. [OavatosDK and Zubancat](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1ipass/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cb6q341) pointed out how Neko's framing and Hanekawa's undressing scene are a great visual elaboration of her self-image issues - I think that's also a fantastic use of the camera's eye. I can definitely see how last episode's scene would be reflective of the power dynamic you mention in your linked piece, but I think the main difference for me was that last episode's scene seemed to be framed by and for an outsider perspective. Normally the sexually charged shots in this series are either reflective of a character's self-image, goals, or another character's perception of them, but the shower scene felt like it was actually the audience's desired perspective, which basically means the characters were being put on display for the audience, which I think devalues them without furthering any valuable point. I think the scene could have been framed in a way that elaborated the points you mentioned while coming across as less voyeuristic and more tied to their perspectives.
>> ARTICLE
Both of the shower scenes were supposed to come across as reflections of their comfort levels. The scene in the novels was originally just a short description in the past tense. It was similar to the fight from Katanagatari in episode 4 in that regard, though on a smaller scale. Hanekawa literally says "We were both completely open with each other" and how she had been hesitant staying at Hitagi's house up until that point. 

Nekomonogatari is extremely descriptive and analytical because of who is telling the story, especially compared to when araragi narrates. It is likely that they needed a scene to fit one of Hanekawa's more important chain of thoughts and saw an opportunity in extending the shower scene as a place to put it.
>> ARTICLE
> I guess the difference between the you before and the current you is like the difference between Terminator and Terminator 2.

Can someone explain this as if I haven't seen Terminator (2) and don't really care if it gets spoiled? Cause I haven't and I don't and I feel like I'm missing some semantic meaning here.

Now, it has been a while, but in Terminator 1 "The terminator" was the bad guy and in Terminator 2 "The terminator" was a good guy fighting against another terminator.

I think usually schools will mandate a minimum skirt length (e.g. 2" from above the knee), and the students can change their skirt length to that size. If they go too far above the minimum, they may have to wear their gym-track pants or get sent home. 

In anime though I think that's usually not enforced unless it's a slice-of-life or shoujo or that type of anime. Otherwise your theory of it being a trope is correct.
>> ARTICLE
>Im eager to see how the potential revelation of whatever Araragis been up to will reflect off Hanekawas tiger - theres obviously the possibility that Hanekawas link with the tiger is responsible for the destruction of both her own home and the old building, which would make the next target Senjougaharas house. Tense stuff!

I really want to see if this ends up validating my theory about the Tiger being the manifestation of Hanekawa running away. If my theory ends up being correct, there are two possible resolutions to the problem. 1. Black Hanekawa takes a stand and fights the Tiger but is defeated. However, with the help of the "other" Hanekawa(if that is even a thing, we don't really know for sure yet), she eventually defeats the Tiger. This is the clich resolution that I think is way too obvious to actually happen. 2. Hanekawa takes a stand and stops running away from everything. This causes the Tiger to simply disappear. At first glance, that might seem as a disappointing ending, but it might be interesting if Hanekawa realizes that so much destruction could have been avoided if she had just stopped running away earlier. In a best case scenario, this would be used to give Hanekawa another piece of humanity that she seems to be lacking: Self-doubt. Now, you may wonder if she was actually lacking that, but I think she is because of her tagline. At first, it was "I don't know everything, I just know what I know". Then it became "I don't know everything, I just know what I know". But at no point was it "I don't know if I know". However, Monogatari being what it is, the real resolution(if there even is one) will probably be much more convoluted.

When it comes to Araragi, if he actually is somehow involved with the Tiger, I think this arc is telling us a lot about him in what it's not showing. Previously, before Nisemonogatari, it was Oshino who hunted the oddities. Now, that's Araragi's job, but we have only seen him dealing with other experts(in Nisemonogatari). But if Araragi is actually involved in this specific case, that's his first real job as far as we know. So, in that case, we would actually be following a hunt similar to the Black Hanekawa hunts in both Tsubasa Cat and Tsubasa Family, but this time, we're seeing it from the perspective of the hunted(well, the target of the hunted, to be precise) instead of the hunter. And I think that's interesting.
>> ARTICLE
> At first glance, that might seem like a disappointing ending

I find it funny how well this describes so much of Isin's stuff, in both this and Katanagatari. "No, you're not getting that fight scene, you're getting a long conversation about self-worth and the power of perception."

> Araragi's first case

I really like that idea - that he's going through all this character growth as he assumes the responsibility of the area's caretaker, but we're only seeing it from the other end of the hunt. Again, it'd be very like Isin to pull something like that.
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of the writing style, I just listened to the newest episode of Podtaku, and all of the pillars basically agreed that Monogatari Series Second Season has lost all of the brilliance that Bakemonogatari had.

Now, I don't agree with that, I think this show mostly retains that brilliance(and in some ways, improves upon it), but it made me think. Does this series have much going for it besides the writing if you happen not to be a big fan of the writing? Because there might be people who really liked Bakemonogatari for certain aspects but did not fall in love with the way the story is told, per se. Maybe they just liked Araragi as a character, or how Bakemonogatari felt so unique. So I wonder, is there something that this show does so differently that it feels bad, or is it the fact that it does most things the same way that feels bad?

It might be too early to tell right now, seeing how many arcs there are left, but I will definitely keep thinking about it when I keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
That's a good thought. I mean, the furthest I've read is Neko(White). I think that the writing retains its brilliance, and the Nisio does wonderful things with Hanekawa's character in Neko(White). Outside of that, I think world building is huge. 
 
 But I would agree to the notion that if you don't like the writing, this series will seem like shit. I love the writing, but I can see where someone would hate it. The style's pretty weird.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's what I thought too. I can see why people don't like it, even if I myself love it.
>> ARTICLE
I am probably useless as a barometer of whether Monogatari is still likable if you liked Bake but think the series has gone downhill, because I don't think Araragi is a particularly interesting character, I think Isin consistently overplays (but has actually gotten better about) his ability to insert his personality into the dialogue while still maintaining character coherency, and I think fanservice is one of the premier and deserved reasons anime is rarely taken seriously as an art form. I liked Bake because it was extremely different, extremely driven creatively, and played with its genre (fantasy mystery/thriller) in a really stylish and interesting way. I liked Nise mainly [because it used direction in such a purposeful and distinctive way](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/04/14/nisemonogatari-and-the-nature-of-fanservice/). And I like the current stuff because I think Isin and Shinbou are just now finally figuring out how to use their very different strengths to tell a compelling and actually holistic story.

I think most critics gave Bake a pass mainly because it was so different from everything else (I checked that podcast, and Gigguk specifically says "the novelty has worn off") and employed a unique style of writing and characterization, along with a couple specific moments like the universally lauded 12th episode. But I see very few critics, even ones still following the series, actually talk about Shinbou's direction style in a meaningful way - making me think most critics are either still in love with Isin's writing or simply covering it because it continues to be popular. I think the series has pretty consistently gotten *better*, but that many of the things it's gotten better at are things many anime critics don't always consider (couching Isin's self-indulgent dialogue in more specific human terms, the increasingly purposeful direction, the better integration between direction and narrative, etc). Yes, this does indeed make me a pompous dick, but if I'm being absolutely frank, I think many of our most artistically interesting shows are laudable for reasons many anime critics just don't talk about.

Not that I think Monogatari is an ungodly work of art so deep these plebeians couldn't possibly understand it. I just think it has some pretty interesting ideas creatively, and that when people say it's bad without addressing stuff like its experiments with visual perspective (stuff extremely few anime are engaging in), I kind of assume they're not considering that. I mean, you see what I focus on here - the very careful character development and the unique visual storytelling. So when I hear critics say "the novelty has worn off, I'm just waiting for the one with the sweet vampire fights" (to use the podcast you referenced), I kinda think we're not really watching the same show.
>> ARTICLE
Criticizing the Monogatari series is actually a weak spot for me, so thanks for bringing up the most important points.

I have to admit, I too think that "the novelty has worn off"(though as I said above, the real brilliance is still mostly there). The slight twists and awesome combat scenes and specific lines of dialogue don't do that much for me anymore. Bakemonogatari played a ton of great cards of all varieties, so I don't think this show can surprise and impress me on the same level anymore. And that's why I make these semi-implausible theories, because they allow me to focus on the stuff that is still interesting, i.e. the subtlety and the different mysteries. And maybe I can only do that because I have way too much time on my hands. Anime critics are busy people, maybe they don't have time and energy for this stuff. In my opinion, that's a definite negative aspect of this story, and it might just explain why some critics, who are usually good at picking up on the more cerebral stuff(or maybe they aren't. Who says critics are automatically experts?), just can't be bothered with Monogatari.

>I think many of our most artistically interesting shows are laudable for reasons many anime critics just don't talk about.

Would you say Gatchaman Crowds fits that description?
>> ARTICLE
Alright, two days is probably long enough to make this thread safely dead!

The point I was dancing around is that I think many critics *aren't* very good at picking up on the more subtle or cerebral stuff, and often will talk about shows strictly in terms like "did I enjoy this show? did everything make sense to me? did I like the characters? are there things I wish it did that it didn't?", which results in them missing an awful lot (thematics, directorial intent, acuity or grace of writing, purposeful experimentation, noteworthy craft fundamentals) and shortchanging many deserving shows. Not all critics, but a lot of them.

As far as Gatchaman Crowds is concerned, from what I've seen around the internet, it's actually doing quite well critically! I think its' aesthetics are very obviously distinctive, and that a lot of its' strengths are based on how it's playing with its' genre, which is something lots of critics are big fans of.

Not all critics, but a lot of them.

That's a good point. However, I would say that this doesn't come down to whether the critics are actually good at picking up on the more subtle stuff or not, I think it has to do with the fact that many reviewers simply can't fit all of that into their reviews. If you think about it, making money by making Youtube videos requires the videos to be short if you actually want to get views, and you can't fit a lot of analysis into a short video. This, and the fact that the review has to appeal to a wide audience(not just the people who like the subtle stuff), forces the reviewer to focus on the obvious stuff. Which is disappointing to those of us who have way too much time on our hands, but it's understandable.

However, this doesn't apply as much to articles and reviews in text form, so your point still stands there.

>As far as Gatchaman Crowds is concerned, from what I've seen around the internet, it's actually doing quite well critically!

Agreed on both counts. This is one of the biggest reasons I haven't done any video content myself, in spite of it being pretty much the only way to make any money doing this stuff.

I just watched the entire series in three days. (up to this episode) and this discussion was definitely the best discussion i've read in all the discussion threads.
>> ARTICLE
Well, someone like JesuOtaku with her 20 minute reviews seem to go with more depth into things. It's just that it's true, it's not what you usually expect in a review (20 minutes), and it's hard to not skip to the end when you hit the middle.

Yeah, I guessed so.

But for what it's worth, you're getting sort of famous around here(if you weren't already). When you write, people read.

> This causes the Tiger to simply disappear.

that's not going to happen [because of this](http://i.imgur.com/qVvCMVi.png), the point/zero of the narration.
>> ARTICLE
Oh damn, I must have forgotten about that.

It might still disappear indefinitely, though, just like the cat does from time to time.
>> ARTICLE
heh..

in my opinion the tiger is her rebellious side. a tiger is by definition colorful, different.. exotic even - everything Hanekawa and Black Hanekawa are not. i had my doubts since burning down your parents house is a tad extreme, even for a rebel.. but sometimes you need that extra kick to be free from your comfort zone(prison) i suppose.

a black cat is still just like a white cat except instead of being tamed and conformed she's wild and untameable(literally untouchable). Hitagi kept analyzing her and ultimately came to the conclusion that both sides of her are flat or rather homogenized.

Hanekawa's basicly a bake-schizophreniac. to "cure" her.. they all have to be integrated and [become one.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309698/)
>> ARTICLE
[I can tell you how accurate your theory is if you'd like. Or you can wait out the series, doesn't bother me. Ending spoilers](/s "Your guess is really spot on. The tiger is like an embodiment of her anger and kind of a rebellious side. Essentially, Hanekawa created Black Hanekawa and the tiger by 'cutting out' parts of herself that were against her notion of white perfection. It's like what Oshino said, that she was more dangerous than any aberration, because she created aberrations")
>> ARTICLE
I agree and disagree with your idea. I think that while the Tiger is not a manifestation of her rebellious side(that part's already handled by the cat, no?), it is a sort of guide that is meant to get Hanekawa to stand up to herself(and it does so through chaos).
>> ARTICLE
rebelliousness in the perspective of the tiger would have to do more with creating flavour, destiny and choice. while the cat is playful, sexy and brutal.. she seems to stick with stress relief and doesn't gauge a lot on Hanekawa's life and what happens in it. she seeks the methods required for her master to get off after which goes dormant.

a clue that lead me to believe this is the convo she has with Hitagi about food: everything's politically correct, so to speak. no flavour of any kind.. it took me a while to register what that means because i love cooking myself and can't fathom why someone would leave out spices and sauces from any meal ever.

you're right about chaos. hanekawa is too ordered, sawari neko's different but she's still very much in control and rational - as explained in neko:kuro as another side of the coin. the tiger should be something that makes the coin fall to either side, a distinct choice before the toss or the coin's edge.. something to make her subjective - or to reference the first episode once again - **give her an identity.**
>> ARTICLE
I think the most important thing about this is that whether metaphorically or directly, the Tiger represents an important part of Hanekawa. What exactly it is, that we can't be completely sure about yet, but it definitely has something to do with the whole theme about Hanekawa running away from problems and never asking for help.

I love how easy it was for Gahara-sama to basically trick Karen into taking Hanakawa in. She is truly a simple-minded sister.

I forgot if it was in the novel, but Shinobu's Terminator reference to describe Hanakawa seems very apt.

I was looking forward to them possibly showing Araragi's parents, but I guess not.

I loved the way Senjougahara manipulated Karen in a way to trick her into taking Tsubasa in too, beautifully done.

The conversation full of tension at first between Shinobu and Black Hanekawa was pretty nice too

I can't get enough of the monogatari series, its not action packed nor is it fancy - but the dialog itself is more than enough entertaining to make it unique to other animes

A lot of really good revelations. Araragi parents are cops? Makes total sense and explains a lot. 

Tiger is only visible to Hanekawa. Ok, so the girl who made a new breed of apparition is seeing other new breeds.

Araragi has been seperated from Shinobu, and recruited Kanbaru. Shinobu later mentioned family lines which I think goes back to the first time saw Kaiki in Nise how he was at Kanbaru's house for spiritual reasons passed down from her mother.

The cram school burning down is interesting because it seems framed as "something happened to Araragi and Kanbaru", but also was the first place Hanekawa slept after her house was burned down by what we assume to be the tiger. If that's true is Senjougahara's house next, followed by the Araragi household?
>> ARTICLE
What an episode! Ever since the end of Nise, I've been hoping to see some interaction between Senjougahara and the Sisters. Senjougahara playing off of Karen's ego was brilliant, but not quite as cathartic as I had hoped: I was really looking forward to seeing their first meeting, but oh well.

But even then, it's just interesting dialogues piled on top of each other. The Sisters and Hanekawa were okay, but then Shinobu and Kittykawa just stole the show. I was definitely not expecting to see my favourite character show up out of nowhere. Kanbaru and Hanekawa made for an interesting pairing as well.

Man, Isin is like crack for those of us that love dialogue. I know it's not realistic, but that's why it's so great. Realistic dialogue sucks. How often do you truly enjoy talking to people just for the sake of the conersation? How often do you truly talk about something that leaves you feeling enriched? Sometimes yes, but not often. But with good fiction, you can always find that kind of brilliant, witty, loaded dialogue that has that substantial feel to it. You can talk to someone, and never touch the surface of who they are, but with good dialogue, you see characters meld together for a moment. That's the brilliance of Monogatari: watching characters crash in to each other.

[nope](http://i.imgur.com/m28VRkV.png), [something resembling nipples on Shinobu](http://i.imgur.com/27s2x3F.png) during the bath chat but that's about it. Araragi gets plenty of close-ups and he's flat as a pancake in this matter.. his abs and pects are detailed enough though.

i'm not particularly pissed or anything.. just stylistically bugs me since i'd never draw nude humans without nipples; makes them seem eerie.

Araragi's parents' profession makes a lot of sense. I wonder, though, if they are actively on-duty or if they're higher up in their careers where they basically do office work most, if not all of the time? I'm under the impression that Japan's police officers work in shifts like they do in the US, but it seems odd that both of them would come home at 6pm (a typical time to get out of work) at the same time. 

Also makes me question how much more or less they're paid on average compared to US police officers to be able to afford raising 3 children and live in such a large, contemporary-looking house. 

The Araragi's certainly have an interesting house. Their living room almost looks like a production studio with its clean, white and large space. Plus those bright spotlights hanging from the ceiling adds to that studio-like feel. 

The cram school burning down was an interesting sight to see. I'm sure in the upcoming episode(s) we'll find out what happened to it. 

Does anyone know if we'll learn about what Araragi was doing this whole time within Nekomonogatari (White)? Or is that explained in a later -monogatari or a side story?
>> ARTICLE
The house...I always thought that was just Shaft being Shaft and Akiyuki Shinbo directing like he does. 

Is the house depicted as such in the Light Novels?
>> ARTICLE
It might just be Shaft/Akiyuki Shinbo. I've only read Kizu so far, and they rarely mention the house.

Somebody knows what happened to it?

it was supposed to come out last year in december but it got pushed back, no one knows when it's supposed to come out now. I'm betting it'll be after this new season of ~monogatari though.
>> ARTICLE
You're getting Golden Week (Black Hanekawa) and Kizumonogatari (Araragi/Shinobu origin story) mixed up

We already saw Golden Week in Nekomonogatari Black but the only stuff we've seen about vampire Araragi were the flashes in the first episode of Bakemonogatari.

If you want more, read the LN's, they're all translated as far as I know.
>> ARTICLE
Only Kizumonogatari, Neko Black and Neko White are fully translated. It looks like a lot of translators gave up when this season was confirmed.
>> ARTICLE
what are you talking about? nekomonogatari:black was essentially a retelling of golden week.
>> ARTICLE
So... That was crushingly depressing.

And is Ougi that darkness thing? It seems like they were trying to make it really obvious, but that leads me to suspect they might be trying to trick me.
>> ARTICLE
Well.. this episode added a new clue towards [my previous theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1oatzw/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/ccqnnop).

>I think she may be Araragi's oddity. I always felt there was something that felt very wrong about Koyomi. As I watched Bakemonogatari, I always wondered what was the reason why Araragi helped everyone, and the backstory to this strange altruism of him. This is more or less thrown to your face early in Kizu: the scene where he meets Shinobu and the decition he makes. It was just abnormal. And I think that Ougi Oshino may be the other side of him.

>I think Ouji sets up shit for Araragi to fix.

>It also explains how Ouji knows stuff that only Araragi or Oshino should know (the Talisman's location). And how did Koyomi arrive to Sengoku's side when she found the talisman (coincidence my ass).

You can add Mayoi's disappearance to the last paragraph now.

I think Araragi is solving stuff in a very self-righteous way, not thinking about the other people's feelings. Without hesitation he proposed to stay lost with Mayoi for 20 or so years, forgetting everything about the people who care for him. Just look at today's conversation. It was these two girls getting Koyomi to let go of an problem he can't fix.

And as much as he looked up to Meme. That guy was a balancer, he just paved the way for people to help themselves. Never involving himself as much as Araragi has been doing for all these arcs.

PD: /u/tensorpudding's idea also fits the bill. Ougi works for Gaen.
>> ARTICLE
I think Ougi is the final bad guy of the whole anime. I thought it was her hanging in the temple at the end of nandeco arc.
>> ARTICLE
Late reply, I just watched this episode today.

I still think Nadeko is the final boss. I recently rewatched the series and found this bit in Nisemonogatari ep 3 [3:40], Kanbaru's advice regarding the final boss: http://i.imgur.com/55l3ezB.jpg

It will be kinda sad to see if the series end right after his graduation. I'm hoping it will continue with his college life.
>> ARTICLE
I found this exact scene again earlier today as well, and immediately realized how clever that foreshadowing was.
>> ARTICLE
she's very reminiscent of her Unkle tbh. he conveniently disappears, she shows up instead.. makes me think it is him and somehow under a different form. she's rather strange..

could she be a Mary Sue AKA author self-insert to influence the story via deusexmachina inserted into a character?
>> ARTICLE
Lol Isin is fucking perv though his self-insert is definitely Araragi....
>> ARTICLE
as an actor.. sure, as something to drive the plot without requiring too many explanations, Ougi seems really convenient atm. no need to explain her sudden presence, no need to explain her knowledge of everything or her inability to see to things in their order.. just shove a timeless character who knows everything but isn't affected by time's sequential passing and you got yourself an easy get-away from consistent characterization via dialogue among characters. 

having an unknown suddenly prod everyone with questions and advice while claiming she's disjointed from the regular timeline sure is convenient in a lot of ways for telling your story and shaping your world without thinking too hard.
>> ARTICLE
It looks like she has 2 lives. One in were she's normal school girl and the other one were she operates from the shadow. She told everything Nandeco and it ended very bad.
>> ARTICLE
My theory:

Ougi is the Shikigami of Gaen, although we still haven't yet solved why Ougi's second name is Oshino.
>> ARTICLE
probably Meme made her for Gaen in exchange for some answers or favors according to how Gaen phrase it XD

same reason shinobus is.

[How about this conversation with Kanbaru](http://i.imgur.com/55l3ezB.jpg). Nisemonogatari ep 3.

She might be boss of 2nd season. I wonder who will be boss of 3rd season. As far as i know there is going to be only 3 seasons. Bake/nise/neko:kuro/Kizumonogatari is 1st season. Ms2ndS + kanbaru OVA is 2nd season and i think 6 more books are going to be written that will become 3rd season and that is all.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure Nadeko is the boss of season 2... There's not enough episodes left to cover Ougi.


Edit: And besides, there's still Gaen. I can't imagine her being just a casual bystander in all this.
>> ARTICLE
Ougi will be S3 boss I think. The first 3 chapters of Owari are translated and show her initial meeting with Araragi. And it definitely seems like she has some power over time. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking that she is of a similar nature, but not the same thing. What do you think of Araragi's decision to finally be tactical? 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly? I'm seeing a bit of a parallel to Touma from the Toaru Series right now. (Hold up, Touma haters, and hear me out.)

Up to this point he's just kind of rushed in all headstrong and just barely managed to pull out successes. [Index NT V3 spoiler: ](/s "This failure seems to be the equivalent of the Hawaii Invasion arc to Touma. After being used by outside parties, Touma gets fed up with the way he's easily manipulated and begins to learn how to manipulate others (and does so incredibly well, I might add).")

Araragi seems to have come to a similar realization that he can't keep going on like this. He has to start thinking his actions through. He realizes needs to be more in control, rather than always simply going with the flow of events. As he is, it's very easy for Araragi to be used by others. But it seems like he's finally starting to consider reversing that situation. I'm very curious as to what he's planning and how successful it will be.
>> ARTICLE
~~how about some spoiler tags on those things? i mean.. i know them but fairly sure they don't belong here at all undisclosed.~~ it's cool now.
>> ARTICLE
Done. Don't know why I didn't put them in in the first place. I'm usually better about that.
>> ARTICLE
Plus he's got a middle school snake god waiting to kill him, so he better wise up pretty quick.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, yeah. That's still a thing. Two failures in a row, followed by scheming? Yup, he's Touma. No complaints from me, though. Can't wait to see the rest of the season. BTW, do we get a real episode next week or another crappy clip show?
>> ARTICLE
I was under the impression it was still recap episodes, but I think they've run out of things to recap unless they want to make a 30 minute trailer for Kizumonogatari. Or recap the previous events of the season, which would just be awful.
>> ARTICLE
This was actually some of the best scenes for Araragi in the whole series so far, I think. He modulates between the muted dislike of Gaen's familiarity in the beginning, his urgent desire to save Shinobu, and then his realization of the truth of the situation leads into his grasping at straws to save Hachikuji from a fate that he has no power to prevent.

I didn't realize it until now but it seems you're supposed to consider Kabuki and Oni as two halves of one story bookended by a conversation between Araragi and Ougi in the future, reminiscing about Hachikuji as a "relation of events of the future". They both deal in the same characters, mostly, and fall one-after-the-other in continuity.

They're also dual in the sense that Kabuki was about saving Hachikuji but ends up being about Araragi and Shinobu's relationship, while Oni was about saving Shinobu but ends up being about Araragi and Hachikuji's relationship. They both ended with a death (in Kabuki's case, of the Shinobu-of-alt-timeline, in Oni's with the actual "death" of Hachikuji) and involved Araragi growing up a little bit.

And Araragi's growth seems to me to be the "theme" of the second season...Araragi is trying to take the mantle of Oshino Meme and solve everyone's oddity problems, but he's definitely not capable of doing that alone, and has repeatedly relied on Shinobu, and later on Yotsugi and now Gaen to help save the people he wants to save. This is the first time chronologically he truly couldn't do anything to save someone (he failed to save Nadeko in Otori, but that comes after this). There seems to be a malaise of failure here. Except for his shining moment in Neko White where he saves Hanekawa, it's him failing to save Hachikuji in the past, failing to save Nadeko, and then failing to save Hachikuji in the present.

So the harem has thinned drastically this season...Hanekawa is turned down, Nadeko is turned down, Hachikuji is....and I might wonder what Hanamonogatari would have in store for us with Kanbaru. Is that the story of what he and Gaen do in that one?

Well, next is Koimonogatari, which involves Senjougahara, or so it seems.

EDIT: I suddenly had a realization.

Gaen works with Episode and Ougi.

Ougi told Nadeko things to make her go crazy and try to kill Araragi/Shinobu.

Episode worked with Dramaturgie and Guillotinecutter to kill Kiss-Shot, and then later Araragi, in Kizumonogatari.

Thus, is it possible that Gaen was the one responsible for having Dramaturgie, Episode, and Guillotinecutter chase Kiss-Shot back to Japan to have her killed, and set the whole story into motion?

Maybe that's a logical leap too far.
>> ARTICLE
>Thus, is it possible that Gaen was the one responsible for having Dramaturgie, Episode, and Guillotinecutter chase Kiss-Shot back to Japan to have her killed, and set the whole story into motion?

Logical leap too far? You're talking about the woman who knows everything here.

Yeah, it's possible. It also creates an interesting contrast/similarity between Araragi and Gaen. They both hunt oddities, but Araragi saves the girls from the oddities while Gaen "saves" the oddities from having to act incorrectly. Of course, neither of them actually take any direct action, the only one who can save you is yourself and the girls *are* the oddities, vice versa and et cetera, but yeah, it's an interesting situation.
>> ARTICLE
Next arc should continue in the present. Hanamonogatari will be an ova and should fill us in on all the rest that's missing. 
>> ARTICLE
It's confusing when you say "in the present", since the scenes in the second season are told majorly out of order.

As far as I can tell based on what I've seen, my provisional timeline for the second season is:

* Hanekawa leaves for school and meets the Hachikuji, who is looking to meet Araragi to get her backpack back. Later she meets the tiger (start of Tsubasa Tiger)
* Araragi is taking the backpack to meet Hachikuji, but instead runs into Yotsugi and they talk about Yotsugi's nature as a corpse, and Hachikuji. (start of Mayoi Jiangshi)
* Araragi and Shinobu travel back to the past, try to prevent Hachikuji's death, fail, save alt-timeline Hachikuji, and then prevent them preventing her death, and return to the present on the morning on the day when they left.
* Araragi finds Hachikuji at the temple (end of Mayoi Jiangshi), and they go back to Araragi's place to get the backpack (beginning of Shinobu Time) and are attacked by the darkness, but escape thanks to Yotsugi's help.
* Araragi and Hachikuji listen to Shinobu's story of the past at the cram school. They run from the darkness again. Shinobu is caught.
* Hanekawa stays at Senjougahara's house.
* Araragi, Hachikuji, and Yotsugi end up on the mountain, meet Gaen, get told the story behind the darkness, Hachikuji disappears (end of Shinobu Time).
* Araragi decides to go with Yotsugi to help Gaen do her unspecified task, involving Kanbaru. He sends a mail to Kanbaru to have them meet at the cram school.
* Hanekawa encounters Kanbaru. Kanbaru is being asked by Araragi to meet (presumably to introduce her to Gaen). Hanekawa advises Kanbaru and they split ways.
* Something happens and the cram school is destroyed by fire.
* Shinobu encounters Black Hanekawa that night while waiting for Araragi to return and find her. They go to the cram school but find it destroyed.
* The next day, Hanekawa encounters Gaen and Episode. Gaen tells her about the things that she doesn't know. It is implied that Episode is being contracted for the work that Gaen and Yotsugi are doing.
* Hanekawa writes her letter to Black Hanekawa and goes to face the Tiger.
* Things with Gaen, Kanbaru and Araragi are continued and concluded.
* Araragi returns home, reads the letter that Hanekawa left, and rushes to Senjougahara's building disheveled and wielding Heartspan to save Hanekawa from the tiger in just the nick of time. Hanekawa confesses and Araragi turns her down. (end of Tsubasa Tiger)
* Some indefinite amount of time after this point, the events of Nadeko Medusa occur.
* About four months after the end of Shinobu Time, Araragi and Ougi discuss Hachikuji.
* At a certain day in March of the following year, immediately following graduation, Araragi, Senjougahara, Hanekawa, Kanbaru, and Shinobu assemble to fight Nadeko at the Shrine of the Polar Snake (or so Nadeko believes).

I thought Nadeko Medusa happened before all of the other arcs in this season, and they take place during his free 5 months before the fight?

It really puts the oft-cited "criticism" against him of having a "Saviour Complex" in context.

Especially with how desperate the "tone" of his thoughts were in some of the Text Flashes during this episode, it really made you understand his desire/desperation to save Hachikuji.
>> ARTICLE
I've very worried about the next arc involving Senjougahara. 

Her and Araragi's relationship has easily been my favorite on the show, and I don't want that to be jeopardized. However seeing how this season has gone so far I'm really worried something bad is going to happen.

And it's called "Hitagi **End**". End. Not "Continuation", *end*. I'm really really worried...

I'm just gonna say...

I'm sure that's meant to be a parody of galge terminology. Maybe Nisio meant for it to be a double meaning as well but since the book is called Koimonogatari. It's not like it's called "Hitagi's End" lol.

one of my favorite animes in season right now

I AM NOT OKAY WITH ANYTHING THAT JUST HAPPENED.

I freakin' *loved* Mayoi's character. Really a shame that she had to go.

Also, I wasn't expecting a piano version of Happy Bite (edit: ALSO KAERIMICHI OH GOD I CAN'T TAKE IT). Made that scene even more unbearable :(

**EDIT: THE COURAGE TO MOVE ON!** ^^^I'm ^^^really ^^^sad ^^^right ^^^now.
>> ARTICLE
I thought after watching many, many anime I will never experience sadness on a "TTGL or Toradora! or alike"-level, I thought that I got used to anime in a way that sad moments don't make me all that sad anymore.  
  
But god damnit this show never fails to amaze me, be it joy, anger, confusion, curiosity, embarrassment or well... sadness.  
  
I will miss my weekly Monogatari dose once the season is finished...
>> ARTICLE
For some reason, I feel like this isn't going to be the last time we see her. She is an oddity, and with how this series has worked in the past, anything can really happen when it comes to oddities. We don't even know if she really "passed" on. She could have just said she was going to, and left to become a lost elsewhere. This is probably just me wishful thinking though, because she's one of my favorites. But I mean his conversation with Ougi made it seem pretty apparent that she is gone for good. Ugh :c That wasn't enough closure for me at all.
>> ARTICLE
I hope so. Issin just makes up oddity rules as he goes along, but I have the sinking feeling that we've just completed her story.
>> ARTICLE
I just....why? Why? I just feel so lost.
>> ARTICLE
> EDIT: THE COURAGE TO MOVE ON! I'm really sad right now.

This is really hard. I was not ready to let her go. Not like this. Hachikuji is one of THE signature characters of the series and brought to light a whole new side to Araragi that we didn't know. :'( Also introduced in Episode 3 of Season 1. EPISODE 3! 

Goodbye, Hachikuji Mayoi.

The song is actually a conversation from Nisemonogatari Episode 1 between Koyomi and Hachikuji.

I'm not sure what you are trying to say. That is the whole point. That scene is a big foreshadow to this part.

HACHIKUJIII

[Also, here's a little something from the previous arc, Nadeko Medusa.](http://i.imgur.com/zbA63Ui.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Wait.  Hang on.  Nadeko Medusa is AFTER Shinobu Time.  This confirms one of two suspicions: Ougi can time travel since she's a crazy supernatural menace, OR Hachikuji having moved on was a lie!
>> ARTICLE
Or Araragi kept Hachikuji moving on a secret until after the events of Nadeko Medusa.
>> ARTICLE
No, when this conversation is taking place, Ougi doesn't know that Hachikuji has passed on. She only hears about Hachikuji passing on from Araragi four months after it happened (the after-credit scene), which is after Nadeko Medusa.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I get it by now, I just assumed Ougi had a better information network.
>> ARTICLE
Did you watch after the credits of today's episode?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.  I saw the goodbye.  That doesn't mean I have to accept it.
>> ARTICLE
... Talking about Araragi's and Ougi's conversation.
>> ARTICLE
Like I said elsewhere in this thread, I didn't realize her information network had been so bad that she was just now finding out about Hachikuji.
>> ARTICLE
All the Touma comments in this thread are making me want to tell you to punch that illusion right in the face!  
>> ARTICLE
Koyomi hasn't spoken with Ougi yet in Nadeko Medusa. After her machinations with Nadeko is when he talks to her about Hachikuji.
>> ARTICLE
Shinobu Time is during Tsubasa Tiger.  Nadeko Medusa is after Tsubasa Tiger.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much what omimon said. All of Koyomi's interactions with Ougi shown have occurred after Nadeko Medusa
>> ARTICLE
Watch the final part of the episode again. That part takes place 4 months after Time which place it in December. Medusa takes place at Halloween and November.
>> ARTICLE
So during that time she'd be chasing a ghost of a ghost of a ghost?
>> ARTICLE
More like she didn't know Mayoi was gone. Also I'm seeing that a lot of people are jumping to the conclusion that she is Kurayami. She might be related but you can't say for sure that she means harm yet.

Oh crap, forgot about that

Maybe we are watching this in Ougi timeline order.

:O fuckin Ougi

I do love how much I'm growing to hate Ougi, even though strictly speaking she's just this random schoolgirl that a couple of characters have chatted with.
>> ARTICLE
Well she pushed Nadeko over the edge for her own purpose, she's influencing things. 

I love and hate her really 
>> ARTICLE
To me this was probably one of the most emotional episodes of Monogatari yet, its almost up there with episode 12 of Bake, but with reverse emotions. The eventualities of it all were bittersweet. In the end Im ok with Hachikuji having to pass on. She accepted that her time was up, and she was prepared to go. As she said, she knew her lingering couldnt last forever. Its sad to hear her talk about how much fun she had, but reassuring to here her talk about watching over Araragi after shes gone. 

The tragedy of this episode truly was Araragi. Mourning for the death of a friend obviously is one of the hardest things to go through, and thats what he had to come to terms with in a very short period of time. He went through all the phases, sadness, anger, bargaining etc etc and eventually only had to come to terms with the reality. The most tragic thing about the entire situation is how helpless he must feel. Through out this series all Araragi has honestly wanted to do was help people. But, now a situation has come up where he cant do anything, hes out of his element, and its heartbreaking to see that play out. 

The slow piano version of Kaerimichi had me pretty worked up. It was a beautiful backdrop to the emotional scene. Ill really miss Hachikuji, but Im glad her character was given a more or less happy ending. She was able to stick around for months making up for those eleven years she was lost. In the end its was an optimistic way to end her story. She had no tragic death, or any thing left undone. Just a simple passing on. I think that suits her, and it suits this series quite well. 

>> ARTICLE
They also fully utilised the unique 'setting/background' they chose throughout this whole episode, especially during the final talk with the music playing.

It was beautiful, the zoomed out birds-eye view, the giant tree reflected in the calm water of the lake, and the way the shadows cast by the structure and bench played about the scenes.

Especially in the speech by Gaen, the way they utilised colour, shadows, distortion and shaking of the camera further added to her long-running Rainbow motif.
>> ARTICLE
You're right! 

I really wanted to comment on the beautiful cinematography of this episode but I kind of didn't see a place to fit it in with my original comment. The composition of this episode was absolutely stellar, and I'm glad they placed them in a wholly unique location. 

A note on the colors. I loved how all the colors of the scenes contrasted with the dialogue. If you noticed the entire episode was very bright. Lots of whites, and flashy colors. Especially during Araragi and Hachikuji's conversation there was a very upbeat color scheme. 

What this did, for me at least, was give a feeling of optimism. Even though what they were talking about was in and of it's self tragic; the setting, and location that they were doing it in was very much not. It telegraphed a happy feeling. Even though Hachikuji was talking about leaving the colors of the scene gave me a feeling of happiness. It's this contrast that I thought was absolutely brilliant. 

And, maybe contrast is the wrong word, but it's the only thing I can really think to describe it....maybe balance would be appropriate. The episode stuck a really good balance between the visuals, and the writing. The viewer was exposed to a multitude of emotions. God I love this show. 
>> ARTICLE
Also, in the post-credits scene, the generally muted colour scheme and emphasis on the sepia/yellow colour was specifically applied to harken back to the talk between Ougi and Araragi at the start of Kabuki(which had the same colour scheme right?). So we realize that the entire thing was a "flashback". It also added a sense of nostalgia or melancholy to Araragi's reminiscence, which is occurring 4 months after the events we saw through both arcs.


>> ARTICLE
I really liked how they did that. 

The color schemes whenever anyone talks to Ougi have always includes really muted colors. I think it adds a lot to the mystery surrounding her character. Nothing about her is defined. Not her personality, not her motives, and not her color scheme. 

The "flashback" aspect too was really well done. When you think about it the entire episode up until the credits was almost dream like. The very soft backgrounds, the bright colors, the surreal setting. This is especially noticeable when Hachikuji tells Araragi he loves him. That scene is presented in a very soft manner. 


>> ARTICLE
Saddest episode of the Monogatari Series yet... I was on the verge of tears, which is pretty rare for me when watching anime... or anything, really. 

That final play on their usual gag together was just perfect, too.

Me too homie, my manly tears almost came out. I was not expecting that kiss at the end, shit got me in the heart. Just thinking about all the stuff they went through together.... -Sniffle :(

I know man... in the end... She didn't bite her tongue... she bit Koyomi's tongue. So I guess he flubbed it... :( 
IT SO SAD!!!! WHY!!!
>> ARTICLE
Same. Very few things have made me choke up, let alone cry. This episode had me somewhere between those two. Regardless of what people think of Mayoi, you have to admit that it was a really well done, emotional scene.
>> ARTICLE
So I guess now I see the reason why Koreans call Nishio Ishin the 'moe-killer' :(
>> ARTICLE
its so fitting.
>> ARTICLE
Everything seems to be coming to some sort of crescendo. My first thought is here comes death. People are probably going to start going away. 

Araragi finally did something incredibly intelligent and calculative after the credits. I think he may have learned something from his encounter. I'm sure he'll prove me wrong later. 
>> ARTICLE
I was really glad to see Araragi calculating like that. He and Shinobu are clearly aware that something is up, and it'll be interesting to see how everything plays out. 

Clearly we're beginning to reach some kind of breaking point, but it's only left to be seen where that breaking point will stand. Be it Ougi, Nadeko, or some other apparition something is about to kick off soon enough.   
>> ARTICLE
Is this real life? Are we really saying goodbye to Hachikuji for good here? That little elementary schooler that was introduced to us in Episode 3 back in 2009 is now gone for good? 

Wow, I was absolutely not ready for this at all. This was very soul crushing. All the fond memories we have of her and now she's just gone. A signature character just gone. Other than being depressed right now, I really don't know how I feel about this. Nothing is going to feel the same again. Her presence in this show was just so damn strong.

"Goodbye, Hachikuji Mayoi. I was happy I met you." - This killed me right here.
>> ARTICLE
Elementary school, she was 10.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, in what has been far and away the best season so far we just saw what was easily my favorite episode of the entire series.  It was an insanely emotional episode, and for the first time I feel like we really saw where the overarching plot is going in that scene after the credits.
  
Something I didn't see anyone mentioning was the location.  I'm fairly sure that the crater lake that they were on was the one that Shinobu formed 400 years ago.  Maybe that was so obvious that it didn't bear mentioning, but I liked that detail.

Woah, definitely not obvious (at least for me), thanks for mentioning!

I never thought Monogatari can make me emotional. The only other situation was at the end of ep 12 of bakemonogatri.

I'm sad Mayoi is gone.
>> ARTICLE
I'm questioning whether she is or not. My current theory is that Ougi is that non-existence. Araragi lied to her about Mayoi disappearing and she's hiding somewhere outside the city. Perhaps keeping a willing participant lost in order to avoid detection. This may be just wishful thinking, but after the ending scene, I'm sure Araragi's up to something.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't show her disappear.  I feel that if she actually had they would have shown it... maybe, at least it's some form of evidence.  I was expecting for them to pull some sort of manipulation since they said

>It's ok to become a God, but not pretend to be one

or something like that, implying it is possible for apparitions to change their nature as long as they actually commit to the change.  This is just wishful thinking on my part though.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but his dialogue with Shinobu pretty much confirmed that she was gone. Then again she should have been gone after she first made it back home in Bake so there's no absolute guarantee that she's gone for good. 
>> ARTICLE
I think what we saw after the credits was a crucial change in Araragi's character. He and Shinobu are going from passive participants in the events of the world and are going to transition in to active participants. 

They both know something is up, and I'm glad they're taking action to begin to uncover it. I think it's pretty clear, like you said, that Ougi is connected to the darkness. "My job is to punish liars" That line was way to telling. 

What will be interesting to see though is if Ougi comes out as a big hero, or a big villain. Cause honestly at this point either angle could be revealed. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you fully, I really like how you explained it to. I feel great things from the coming episodes..but am troubled as to how Senjou is going to get caugh tup in it
>> ARTICLE
> I think what we saw after the credits was a crucial change in Araragi's character. He and Shinobu are going from passive participants in the events of the world and are going to transition in to active participants.

I'm getting a similar vibe. As I said elsewhere in this thread, I'm seeing some huge parallels between Araragi and Touma from the Toaru Series. They both begin as characters who really only go with the flow. They're not in control of events, but rather just do what feels most natural, trying for the best possible end every time. Both start off by going into situations all headstrong and just barely managing to pull success out of failure. Unfortunately, two consecutive tragedies cause them both to reconsider the way they're living. I think we're going to see Araragi go through the same change Touma did, into a more calculating, manipulative character who is conscious of the grander plans of those around him and how he can use them to his advantage.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's a good comparison. 

I could eventually see Araragi ending up like Oshino, or Gaen. Him becoming a more calculating and planning character, and starting to take action is another step towards that. 
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me, or is the temple they're at the same crater that Shinobu created when she first landed in Japan?

Holy shit, that was heavy. Araragi's and Hachikuji's relationship wasn't the most serious, which is probably why this turn of events caught me completely by surprise. And Emiri Katou's performance during the goodbye scene, wow, that was amazing. As I said in the discussion thread for Episode 13 of Uchouten Kazoku:

>the thing that makes me cry is not the sound of a person crying. The thing that makes me cry is the voice of a person who is on the verge of crying.

And goddamn, they absolutely *nailed* that part. It's still replaying in my head, and I'm constantly on the verge of tears. Which was *not* alleviated by the ED song, now that it makes perfect sense.

Also, the epilogue was, well, earthshattering. It basically confirmed that yeah, it's all been leading up to that storyline, and that's most likely the storyline that will end the entire story. It's all connected now(or rather, it was always connected). *This* is the reason I'm watching this show.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. I cried when I read it in the book, I still cried when I saw this episode. I don't even cry for anime and I honestly didn't like Hachikuji that much but I think this is one the absolute strongest departures ever. I was just so emotional the whole time.

[All the kisses](http://imgur.com/a/N1p03)

Back to my thoughts - Gonna say it straight out here: The eerieness of Ougi and the whole "according to keikaku" thing at the end by Araragi felt like they were downplayed a whole lot.  Not quite sure what it was but in the book in relation to the post-credits scene [](/s "Before Araragi questions what she's talking about, Ougi talks about how she knows everything that has happened in the town including the events in Hanamonogatari (which actually happen much later in April) involving Numachi. Also according to Ougi, it's about a month after Otori, so it's like Decemeber. This made me question if Ougi could actually travel through time, unlike the way Araragi and Shinobu did.") I disliked how they didn't mention that but at the same time I can fully understand how it would only serve to confuse the viewers more (though is that really a bad thing?)

Anyways, I enjoyed this arc so much. I loved every second of it. I was so so so hopeful about it being 5 episodes or Koi being 5-6 episodes long but unfortunately, [Shaft is gonna Shaft.](http://i.imgur.com/0PE2u.jpg)

I've never been really a fan of Mayoi. Hell, I'm rarely a fan of loli characters in harem. She wasn't a bad character, but she was probably my least favorite.

Still, this was hands-down the most powerful episode of the season so far, I've got to hand it to them. The discussion about passing on and letting go was amazing, and it was so emotionally loaded! Even if Mayoi was my least favorite, I don't see myself forgetting her easily due to this amazing last episode and goodbye.

Also, that last line, that play with their usual banter. "I bit **your** tongue". I couldn't stop smiling, in that sad, "I'm happy we had a chance to meet", way.

**Monogatari doesn't disappoint.** It's becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible to justify not giving this season a perfect score. Next comes the "Hitagi **End**". Not "Continuation", *end*. I'm scared!
>> ARTICLE
All I can say is be prepared to be surprised.
>> ARTICLE
how do you know it's called Hitagi End? and by that I mean, where can I see that?
>> ARTICLE
I think that "I bit **your** tongue. I more of a genious wordplay by sub-group, because I don't think in original J she associates an object in that sentence.  is more like "I bit (**a** tongue)"

feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
>> ARTICLE
The "sneak preview" in Nadeko Medusa suggests that Senjougahara will, if nothing else, live to see her graduation, so I don't think Hitagi End will end with Hitagi's end.
>> ARTICLE
There's a lot of things that "Hitagi End" can refer to that make me afraid, only one of them is Hitagi's actual end ;)

For example... A break up?
>> ARTICLE
Think about who wrote it, the name could also be a red herring. Remember, this is the same guy who hyped up a bad ass swordfight of the century, then gave us cute girl kills bugs.
>> ARTICLE
For anyone wondering, he/she's referring to one of Katanagatari's episodes, an altogether different universe from the better known monogatari series without any relation to the latter. 
>> ARTICLE
Well...  The universe could actually be the same, but odds are they are not. The maniwani corps skills could follow the same rules as oddities.
>> ARTICLE
Hard to imagine them breaking up.

As much as Araragi says and does crazy stuff to save other girls, I don't think he really wants to be with anyone other than Senjougahara romantically.

Unfortunately the second season seems to be organized entirely around preventing Araragi and Senjougahara actually being in a scene together so far. We haven't seen what they've been like together since back in Nise during the summer. The situation will have changed after Nadeko puts out a death threat on Senjougahara and Araragi.
>> ARTICLE
Well something that was cut out from kabuki was essentially, [From Kabukimonogatari](/s ""I love Senjougahara the most, I respect Hanakawa more than anyone else, I'm the happiest when talking to Hachikuji, but if I were to choose someone to die withI'll definitely choose you." which was said in a conversation between shinobu and araragi.

Damn, I didn't think Hachikuji was gonna go, it was something I didn't expect from this series and it hit hard

As for ougi, I am just left with more questions! The part after credits just intrigued me and I don't think it's gonna get resolved in Koi, because I'm pretty sure that is gonna be a Senjougahara v Sengoku story for the major part, or something of that nature

And I need to know what's going on with Kanbaru, and why Gaen got Episode to help her, damn, this series is great at giving me more questions than answers!

Does anyone know what is happening next week? Are we getting a recap of something somehow, or is it Koimonogatari time?

Looks like that big event that gathered everyone has alot to do with Kanbaru. I can't wait for next arc.

Kyomi has to get used to people dying, he is half-immortal after all.
>> ARTICLE
Except as far as Araragi knew there was no reason she had to die - as a ghost she was practically immortal and not many things could hurt her. So the unexpectedness of it also takes its toll ;_;
>> ARTICLE
I didn't want to see that possibility. Don't make her disappear. I'm in tears right now! How dare that Ougi-bitch play the meta police. Meta existences are wonderful and I hope Arararararagi gives her what is coming! Otherwise, I do have my own personal hope for what might be coming. (All of it is just theory but I will spoiler tag it just cause that is how I do things, please don't tell me if I'm correct or not if you've read the the upcoming volumes.)

[Theory](/s "They kept mentioning that not changing into something is lying. Wouldn't that mean changing the type of aberration you are would bend the rules. Perhaps if Mayoi became some kind of guardian angel, she could have stayed. Though how exactly would a spiritual aberration change it's form. I'm hoping we get some answers if we see Ararararagi fight Ougi. Though I have no idea what comes next. I'm not up to date with the light novels since translation had stopped at Kabuki many months ago and I haven't picked up from anywhere the anime has left off. But all in all, I WANT MAYOI BACK! I DON'T ACCEPT DEATH OF BEST GIRL CHARACTERS WHEN PHYSICS ARE MANIPULABLE!")
>> ARTICLE
[Re:Theory](/s "I agree, bringing her back as a different aberration seems be the winning loophole. It's clear that Araragi hasn't given up on her. Grasping as straws mode: during their kiss Hachikuji said she bit his tongue, maybe his half-vampire blood can bring her back as a minion? (ignoring the issue that since she most likely doesn't have a physical body, being a ghost and all. Maybe Shinobu could do it if they dig up her remains? When she was at full power it only took a hand last time) We can only hope ;_;")

Don't. Ever. Stooooop.

I never liked Hachikuji that much. I always found Araragi's seemingly lolicon complex with Hachikuji a bit weird and uncomfortable to watch, and though she became an interesting character in later arcs, to me she just didn't compare to Shinobu, Senjougahara and Hanekawa. Even her opening theme in Bake remains my least favourite theme song of the whole series.

And then we have this episode which makes me curl into a ball and cry over my least favourite character in the series and oh god. I'm going to miss her. T____T

The thing 89ji and muraragi had was a beautiful bromance, she was his best friend.

Welp, time for the grand finale of the undoubtedly worst arc of this season. Thats a shame, but I guess it was kind of bound to happen - as long as Araragis the ostensible main character, theres going to be an arc with a lot of aimless Mayoi banter and pedophile jokes. Personally, Id be all for dumping Araragi - as the first and third arc revealed, this series is actually a lot more interesting when hes just there on the fringes of the story. His arc is done (or is at least shifting at such a glacial pace that it appears to be standing still), hes not particularly complex, and hes far more prone to Isins wandering digressions than most of the cast. Death to the half-vampire!

But hey, at least the second episode was great, and the third episode was certainly pretty. Plus, even the worst Monogatari arcs have a tendency to finish strong - when the plot actually kicks into gear, Isin knows how to pull together a satisfying finale (or at least satisfying to *me*, regardless of whether youre a fan of his death-by-monologue theatrics). And this *is* supposed to be about the Shinobu-Araragi relationship, which is legitimately interesting.

Okay. Sufficiently amped. Lets do this.

**Episode 20**

0:18 - [Adults are scary](http://i.imgur.com/nlJwRo5.jpg)

0:26 - [The first time one of these things has flashed through *my* head at the same time](http://i.imgur.com/NBiPnlH.jpg)

0:35 - [Shinbo can make pretty much any line sound intimidating through his damn angles](http://i.imgur.com/kkTleEP.jpg). Also, it was rightfully pointed out that I didnt mention the return of what is apparently Gaens signature rainbow cloud formation. /u/ShadowZael postulated it might be indicative of her all-knowing status, which seems reasonable - last time she appeared, she laid down the blind spots of Hanekawas perspective, and in this arc Araragi seems similarly blind to aspects of Shinobus perspective. In fact, the first mention of Shinobu *last* episode briefly knocked the entire show into grayscale.

0:47 - [That hat, so silly.](http://i.imgur.com/gVnBI1E.jpg) I like how all four members of the old guard each harbor a very different attitude towards their various adopted ghostbusters and familiars. Im not sure if it would kinda break the magic/mystique, but Id still love to see some brief glimpses of the professionals getting to work.

1:17 - [Even Araragi notices it.](http://i.imgur.com/mmDe6Bc.jpg) Theyre all just kids to her

1:22 - [Questions like this always make me think, Oh right, there are people who care about that stuff](http://i.imgur.com/n27lkyX.jpg)

1:27 - [Another beautiful mirrored composition](http://i.imgur.com/XjVnx38.jpg). The natural blue of the water contrasted against the stylized blue of the pillars as they rise, the natural darker tones of the roof contrasted against the stylized black of the foregrounded platform. Our protagonists perfectly framed in the center of a jumbled maze, with that lone, surreally placed tree breaking the pattern. Goddamn this show is pretty

1:46 - [Head tilts head tilts never change](http://i.imgur.com/1gijfaJ.jpg)

2:04 - [*Adults are scary*](http://i.imgur.com/QG3IbMn.jpg)

2:25 - [Unwanted truths: the central villain of Monogatari](http://i.imgur.com/HuzL3Y0.jpg)

2:45 - [Seriously Gaen you can stop now oh god](http://i.imgur.com/OuIjkSc.jpg)

3:03 - [A quest!](http://i.imgur.com/9SJDabk.jpg) This is also kinda interesting - everything she does conveys a lack of real respect for the kids, but now shes demanding he take responsibility for her help. Which actually might be what Araragi needs to grow here - the fundamental problem is hes always taken *Shinobus* help for granted, right? So she actually might be giving him both the practical and emotional answer he needs and of course, in Monogatari the emotional answer often ends up sufficing for the practical one as well

3:35 - [It suddenly occurs to me that this entire discussion is taking place in what looks like a crater filled in by a lake.](http://i.imgur.com/0voNehV.jpg) Not like *thats* relevant to this arc or anything

3:48 - [Yeah, shes trying to push him in the right direction](http://i.imgur.com/Wqr0dpm.jpg) in her own lilting, mocking fashion

4:19 - [The spotlight appears for this one line.](http://i.imgur.com/HU1qoCA.jpg) The only earnest thing shes said?

4:58 - [Oh goddamnit.](http://i.imgur.com/iQsKpGS.jpg) So were *still* not going to see whatever nearly killed Araragi during Neko Shiro. Screw you, Isin

5:48 - [You think youre pretty cool, huh](http://i.imgur.com/b4AIc7I.jpg)

7:22 - [Man, this season has not been nice to Mayoi!](http://i.imgur.com/YqzQH27.jpg)

7:25 - [Aw](http://i.imgur.com/XLGjM3a.png)

8:05 - [Gaen apparently paid off Shinbo.](http://i.imgur.com/Pf5L9no.jpg) Shes getting all the best shots

8:15 - [Like this one!](http://i.imgur.com/5DVfVBl.jpg)

8:21 - [Or this one holy crap](http://i.imgur.com/eAh6ne3.jpg)

8:25 - [Love this lighting.](http://i.imgur.com/35XbiB4.jpg) The number of shows that squander this mediums visual potential in order to just look like animated sitcoms is depressing. You can do *anything!* Why not create your own goddamn visual vocabulary, like this or Tatami Galaxy or Utena or Serial Experiments Lain? Why not *try?!?*

8:49 - [Ah, because she changed from what she is?](http://i.imgur.com/XrJca8I.jpg) Thats *great* - in the same way that the emotional oddities appear because characters deny their own nature, this non-entity appears when the *oddities* have shifted their nature

And hey look, another great shot that uses color to effortlessly indicate a characters significance relative to their physical presence. Its almost like this is a visual medium!

8:57 - [Its like the light is saying if youre drifting off, sit the fuck up. This is the important part](http://i.imgur.com/795dnJh.jpg)

9:04 - [If you still dont think false impressions have power, you havent been paying very much attention](http://i.imgur.com/FUCgLde.jpg)

9:24 - [Interesting. I wonder what Kaiki would say to this?](http://i.imgur.com/QLNLs4q.jpg)

10:17 - [Goddamnit, is this season seriously going to redeem *their* relationship too?](http://i.imgur.com/FYnVkko.jpg) I figured making Nadeko a compelling lead would be enough, but *nooo*...

11:04 - [Never change, Isin.](http://i.imgur.com/wbaKDL3.jpg) Having the edges of your story be frayed and self-aware is fine by me (hell, I kinda consider that a bonus) as long as the pillars of emotional and thematic logic are sound

11:27 - [Gaen is not impressed by many people](http://i.imgur.com/6kWU2Qv.jpg)

12:56 - [You can save some of the people some of the time](http://i.imgur.com/RGFGBDQ.jpg)

Looks like I was *also* wrong about Araragis arc. This isnt just dealing with his relationship with Shinobu - its getting at his core failing, the savior complex

13:01 - [Ononoki does not want](http://i.imgur.com/PLrhV0f.jpg)

14:49 - [This ones gonna hurt.](http://i.imgur.com/4znPFRg.jpg) But thats the job, Araragi

15:41 - [Jesus.](http://i.imgur.com/4Fhl8PQ.jpg) This ones a killer. No wonder this ended up being a Mayoi arc

16:53 - [Aaagh stop it this sceeeene](http://i.imgur.com/LZPlzgO.jpg)

17:03 - [You cant get away with a line like that, Araragi](http://i.imgur.com/LuUAnIz.jpg)

19:12 - [What about *her* perspective?](http://i.imgur.com/D3PY8Hs.jpg) Damn blubbery hypocritic, Araragi

20:45 - [I HATE THIS ARC I HATE THIS SHOW LEAVE ME ALONE IVE GOT DUST IN MY EYES](http://i.imgur.com/ZZ2imj3.jpg)

23:23 - [Dont even care that theyre not showing it anymore](http://i.imgur.com/PVUtQST.jpg)

24:17 - [Uhhhhhhhhhhhh](http://i.imgur.com/9EICcxq.jpg)

25:06 - [And it worked.](http://i.imgur.com/lOCc1YX.jpg) He was sad, but hes more of a professional now, and hell use the tools hes been given

26:07 - [So it ends](http://i.imgur.com/aizyx7f.jpg)

**And Done**

Well, that was certainly a Mayoi arc. And yeah, that ending redeemed it. Goddamn this show. Goddamn it to hell.

Well, I dont even know what to say. Up to this point, I felt this arc was dragging this stellar second season down, but that was one of the best things the shows ever done - one of the moments that will stick out in a greatest hits collection very few shows could hope to match. That ending was beautiful - just understated enough to work, with Araragi and Mayoi both acting completely in character while also moving forward on their journeys. Araragi actually shined, which he hasnt done in a while, and the post-credits sequence answered a few questions while raising some compelling new ones, as well as implying an exciting new chapter in Araragis assumption of his duties.

That was great. Sad character tears and happy art tears. Im glad we have this show.

> but that was one of the best things the shows ever done

See, I was just about ready to say Nadeko Medusa was the best arc and call it a day. Then I remembered Shiro. Then I remembered that [Kabuki and Oni are irreversibly linked, two sides of the same coin](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1qsna2/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cdg3b14).

[Also, here is a little exchange about the cinematography this episode](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1qsna2/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cdg3ukw), which as you pointed out, was absolutely brilliant.


>> ARTICLE
[*I can't hold all of these emotions.*](http://i.imgur.com/8LaE29Y.gif)

I agree, the visual design of this episode was stellar. I like /u/The_DanceCommander's point about the bright colors of the goodbye scene - it's almost like the visual design was reflecting Mayoi's attempts to put a bright spin on such a tragic moment, making Araragi's breakdown that much more of a stark and personal event. Maybe I would have paid more attention to that if I weren't already blubbering by the fifteen minute mark...
>> ARTICLE
"24:17" - do you think this means that Ougi is a manifestation of "the darkness"?
>> ARTICLE
I think it means the show is very strongly and intentionally implying it, which in an Isin story means it could go either way. As others have pointed out, Ougi also begins her conversation with Nadeko by saying she's looking for Mayoi, so...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... I'm leaning towards that conclusion. Ougi's eyes could be another hint. Or.., she could be a familiar of the darkness, on par with Yotsugi? Hmmm...

Need to find that timeline post someone made to see when the "4-months later" conversation occurred in relation to Nadeko events (and graduation). 
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck, where did all these feels come from?
>> ARTICLE
Not many shows can make me shed a man-tear. Not many at all. Congratulations episode 20, you have done just that.

I'm just gonna go over here and crawl under my bed. :(
>> ARTICLE
This show just keeps getting better. I'm not sure why, but every 26 minute episode feels incredibly satisfying. Some shows feel like they end prematurely or are incomplete, but the 26 minutes in the Monogatari series is almost like it's just long enough, and will leave me thinking about it for the rest of the day.

This is the best anime series I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Wait so how did Shinobu get back into Araragi's shadow? Or was she never gone?
>> ARTICLE
There was a 4 month timeskip on the end of the episode. Plenty of time for that to happen.
>> ARTICLE
On top of the fact that shinobu hopped a ride to the school around the same time araragi was near there.

Oh, guess I didn't notice that. Thank you :P

So a sensual 22 year old for Koyomi :p

So next week is another recap episode, then Koi[big ol' spoiler](/s "Kaiki")monogatari? 
 
 If so, what would there be to recap? They've been through everything up till this point except Kizu, but that would be silly to have because of the movie that may or may not actually exist.

Now that I've collected myself from possibly the saddest moment of the season (right up there with Golden Time).

What will Senjougahara say about Araragi kissing three girls behind her back? I doubt they will just let that pass like it never happened.
>> ARTICLE
Assuming Hachikuji is really gone now and won't return later in the show, it's looking increasingly likely Ougi is a time traveler.

I had an intense emotional moment listening to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NuyaRPg7bo) while re-watching the emotional scene on silent. This song and this scene were meant to meet in several ways.

Well, shit, if I had known this was going to happen I would have saved something uplifting or comedic to watch afterwards.

So, the after credits part is four months after the rest of the episode takes place, and shows that Shinobu and Araragi are back together. Is next week's episode a recap, or are we going to be shown Araragi helping Gaen and Shinobu coming back into the fold?
>> ARTICLE
probably a recap, shaft need all the time they can get.
>> ARTICLE
All that talks about the darkness punishing apparitions who lie or cause a misunderstanding reminds me of this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUqBM-Y4r9Q).

I'm choking on my tears during that scene. Man, this arc was titled Shinobu Time. I guess it's a way to get back at how Shinobu was the real focus on the "Mayoi Jiangshi" arc.
>> ARTICLE
Well, uh... The previous episodes were quite comical and then this happens. What an unexpected twist.

I'm feeling significantly more anxious about Koimonogatari now.

WELL OKAY HELLO FEELS HOW ARE YOU, WHERE DID YOU COME FROM? Seriously though I am really going to miss Hachikuji. One of my favourite characters.

Oh man, the feels was strong with this episode.

Did not expect that, pretty well done.

It's like Angel Beats all over again T_T

The realization that I love every character in this series, and that one of them is gone(?)

Hey, I'm very behind in the series. This episode really confused me but I'm dying to know.. Who does Araragi really love?? I know he has different feelings for all of the girls involved (including his sister) but who is his #1? Opinions/spoilers please.
>> ARTICLE
I would say Hitagi Senjougahara is his #1 right now, but do you know what the name of the next arc will be? [](/s "Hitagi End").
>> ARTICLE
You should spoiler that. Personally I was pissed when that got dropped on me without warning. 
>> ARTICLE
You think so? I'll do it, but wouldn't it be in the episode title for the next arc anyway?
>> ARTICLE
For me it's a different story when i settle into to watch an Episode and the title comes up. I don;t have time to fret.

As for that title... well, let me just say I regret looking into the Manga to see if it was going to be published in the West any-time soon. 

It's not a big deal i guess, but personally I would spoiler tag stuff like that given the weight of the series for me personally.

He's dating Senjougahara, is in love with Hanekawa, but [was going to] marry Hachikuji.

Anyone know when they are going to finish the snake arc? 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I have a thing for ghosts but man I actually cried this episode, haven't done that since watching AnoHana. ;~;
>> ARTICLE
wow. that was a great episode! so shinobu time was actually always about hachikuji (and you can probably also say that it's always shinobu time on monogatari s2 - so everyone's happy, I assume?)

The only thing that really stuck to me on the second watch was Gaen's request. Seems like she's asking Araragi to "lie" to kanbaru about her being kanbaru's aunt (since hiding things is he same as lying, as she pointed out). That is a bit weird given the circunstances, I'm interested to see where this leads.

The last scene was just as great as the rest of the episode. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Oogi-san's weirdness
>> ARTICLE
i cried at the end ....
>> ARTICLE
All right, let's take stock here!  Someone else linked [this](http://i.imgur.com/zbA63Ui.jpg).  This image shows Ougi in Nadeko Medusa, which is AFTER Shinobu Time.  So she's pursuing Hachikuji in the future.  This means Hachikuji may very well still be around.  Alternately, Ougi is a time traveling menace.

This leaves us with multiple avenues for us to keep Hachikuji around.  First is easy: They lied to Ougi.  Araragi begged Hachikuji to give him more time to solve the menace of the jerk before she permanently sacrifices herself, and she's keeping Ononoki lost for a while, so Araragi will be performing Hanamonogatari on his own without Ononoki's help.  Second is more of a pain- resurrecting Hachikuji as an Ononoki-like homunculus item spirit... thing.  He can learn that trick from Kagenui, and pull Hachikuji's spirit back to fill her corpse while refreshing it (because I don't care how well-preserved you are, you don't look as good as Ononoki after being dead for a long time).  Third is throwing Hachikuji into the future until he's conquered the darkness or can at least better protect her from it.  Fourth is a bit odd- we don't get OUR Hachikuji, but alternate timeline Hachikuji, who has Araragi's job in her world, gets some help and jumps ship to this timeline.  After all, she probably has to deal with Gaen and Ougi's bullshit in her world too, and there's more of a shot of beating them here because of Araragi's harem and its assorted superpowers.  Fifth option is bite her and turn her into a vampire.

Also!  Giant blob of anti-oddity power is actually extremely convenient for Araragi!  If he figures out a way to betray his nature as an oddity, he can use that to his advantage.  Running off and getting captured by Nadeko means he would be kiting the anti-oddity blob into the GOD.  While the blob could take out Shinobu, it might have some more difficulty with Nadeko.  Whoever wins, Araragi wins.  He can cheat his way back into normalcy if the blob wins, by just following vampire rules again.  And if Nadeko wins, that means if Hachikuji's still around, he can then take her out of hiding- after dealing with Nadeko with his talking methods.

On the note of Nadeko, that's totally a proxy battle between Gaen and Ougi.  Gaen is omniscience, Ougi is omnipotence, who will win in a battle of brains vs. brawn?

This episode has given me reason to actually seethe with hatred for Ougi.  Before she was just kind of a weirdo.  Now she's killed/significantly inconvenienced Hachikuji.  Fuck her.
>> ARTICLE
Just clearing this up, Ougi was searching for Hachikuji before Araragi told her that she was dead. The conversation between them at the end of this episode was 4 months later, which would be after Otori etc. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought that Monogatari S2 is the weakest Monogatari, I thought it has lost all it's glory and should've ended with Nisemonogatari (and Bakemonogatari prequels) but after the last two arcs I was wrong, very wrong. It may lack the flurry of witty banters and the animation is...well I don't know if it's just me but I feel that there are more still images now than animation compared to previous seasons, it may have taken a more serious approach but it was all for the better, it makes room for character development, it makes the franchise feel more like evolving (maybe I'm stretching it a bit but I cant find a better word) and not just rehashing it's previous formulas or using the same pattern. This series indeed belong to the Monogatari franchise and should be.

I think this is on par with Bakemonogatari and more importantly I will miss Hachikuji.
>> ARTICLE
I did not like this arc at all.
>> ARTICLE
Where are you guys watching it?

>> ARTICLE
1Honestly this episode did nothing for me emotionally. Which is odd because in normally pretty easy when it comes to stuff like this.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly the first three episodes of this arc was so boring. It must have been because the antagonist this time is just a big ball black of whatever, then this episode just reminded me that Monogatari is all about the characters and not the actual defeating of a foe but the conflicts that unfold throughout the arc

I was misled. Good job girl

I'll get downvoted to hell, but WOOOHOOO, SHE'S GONE. The only reason for her to exist was to make the awesome time travelling arc and help occasionally. Nothing more. The rest of the time she was annoying. And she just hijacked a Shinobu arc, so good riddance I say. Now all the fans of her probably know how I felt when Sengoku was led into being a god and excluded from the story.

You sound like a lot of fun.

I like how he pointed out that she hijacked the Shinobu arc, even though Shinobu totally hijacked Mayoi's arc previously.

Never have I felt like such a fangirl when Araragi first appeared. Im a guy damnit, Koyomi!

They usually are, but in this specific case for Monogatari S2 they're a Daisuke rip. Daisuke has the exclusive simulcast rights for it, whereas CR won't be able to "simulcast" it until [Aug 6th](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/07/03/crunchyroll-to-stream-monogatari-second-season-anime).

Whoa! An encounter where Araragi doesn't get his ass handed to him. 'Bout time!
>> ARTICLE
It only happened because he got the jump on Kako with an OP weapon!
>> ARTICLE
I thought Kako was only visible to Hanekawa. Maybe he got lucky lol
>> ARTICLE
Yes and no. We already know that some crazy shit was going on with whatever Ararararagi and Kanbaru were doing. But the description in the LN described his appearance as that of a warrior, and that he was wielding the sword as if he was familiar with weapon combat. Basically, I think it's safe to assume that Araragi became a badass offscreen(and we'll probably see him become a badass in the next arc).
>> ARTICLE
It'll be interesting to find out what exactly he was doing for sure.
>> ARTICLE
I sooooo want to see what he has been up to for the past 5 episodes! I kept wondering each episode. "When will Araragi show up?" And that was one hell of a way to make an entrance. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if that will be in the next episode. Kanbaru's arc has apparently been removed from the season (sadface) and will appear in another season or as an OVA.
>> ARTICLE
Next episode is a recap, but the crazy crap he's been up to I'm like 90% sure is what takes place in Kabukimonogatari(the next arc). While it is sad about Kanbaru's arc, I think we'll see what happened soon.

What if its not a recap of the whole series and its just a recap of what Araragi was doing for the last 5 episodes :O

It's not. It's a recap of the series.

For me as well, it felt like it's been 100 years since I've seen Araragi. I'm so excited for next week!

And that Araragi confession as well, I felt like I've never seen him say that so openly and admittly, THE GOD IS BACK.

Araragi's scene was exactly like I pictured it from the novel. Thank you based Shuraragi.

It sucks that we have no new episode next week. I'm most excited for the stories that haven't been fully translated yet since my Japanese is way too weak to read the raw LNs.
>> ARTICLE
Wait sorry but what's going on next week? 
>> ARTICLE
Recap episode I think
>> ARTICLE
I was under the impression it would cover Ararararagi's side of the story up until this moment. I mean, a lot of off screen stuff has been foreshadowed at the past 5 episodes from the lack of phone calls, the conversations between characters, the surprise appearance of Episode & another one of Meme's fellow Alumni and Arararagi showing up all torn to crap at the end.

It would be beyond fan baiting to just abort all that stuff after teasing it for 5 whole episodes.
>> ARTICLE
is it going to be recap Shingeki 13.5 style, or is it going to be re-air of a whole episode of bake/nise?
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea.
>> ARTICLE
NOoooooo. I guess cutting of Kanbaru's story gives them some extra episodes to do recap eh
>> ARTICLE
what is kanbaru's story. i can't find anything about it online. it doesn't seem to be in the LN?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know either. But I know each girl gets their own little story just like Hanekawa. Shaft mentioned somewhere that they're cutting Kanbaru's story out of this season's adaptation when it was originally slated to be in there.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa what? So are they just skipping it all together and going straight to Nadeko's or are they gonna do it later? Why are they cutting it out?
>> ARTICLE
I think they're doing Mayoi next then just Nadeko and Senjougahara and maybe another Araragi? I'm not even sure. I know they said they'll do Kanbaru in later season. Maybe OVA? But I don't know why that's cut
>> ARTICLE
I really hope Kanbaru's story will appear in one way or another. Shinobu aside, I like her the most.
>> ARTICLE
Mayoi --> Nadeko --> Shinobu --> Gahara

That's the order without Kanbaru. 
>> ARTICLE
Is it going to follow the same format as Neko? As in not Araragi's PoV?
>> ARTICLE
But Kanbaru is best girl.  :(
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the recount episode counts for the episodes for the show, kinda like how 13.5 didn't count for Attack on Titan
>> ARTICLE
May not count as an episode, but for the week it airs it delays the next story-driven episode.
>> ARTICLE
ARARAGIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!

Good to fucking see you again, we all missed you - you magnificent bastard.

What a really satisfying end to an arc, they really really floored me with this and I hope the next ones are equally as good or better.

That Hanekawa Petting- I can watch that all day, totally digging her new hair style too

Alright Monogatari, time to tell us what the fuck is going on. Araragi and Kanbaru are out there... somewhere. Doing *something* - possible tiger related, possibly not. Shinobu is on her own (or maybe not, who the fuck knows what happened during that massive chapter skip last episode), the tiger is threatening Senjougahara and Araragis homes, and Hanekawa has decided the moment has arrived. No more playing house with Senjougahara or the fire sisters, no more relying on Neko to sweep the bad feelings away. Its time to wake up.

**Episode 5**

0:00 - Actually very excited for this. If theres one thing Monogatari arcs know how to do, its nailing the dismount.

0:41 - [I buried you for my own ego.](http://i.imgur.com/zkv2SBh.jpg) Its all coming together! 

1:17 - So Im saying this for the first time: please help me. And... character arc concluded? I mean, that was kind of it, right? Honestly admitting a need to rely on others, no longer accepting fate as it presents itself and defending herself with an overtly flawless and unfazed exterior? Yep, looks like were done here. Pack it up, guys!

1:45 - A new segment my heart has cut off from itself. Artfully put, Hanekawa

2:20 - Loving this constantly-reassembling [montage](http://i.imgur.com/shxG10q.png). Shinbos going all-out

2:37 - [Show off all you want Shinbo, I love it](http://i.imgur.com/2hGPVFE.png)

3:22 - Stress and envy. Anxiety and agony. Thats sweet characterization, but its also whats made Hanekawa so unrelatable for so long. Its hard to relate to someone whose negative emotions are immediately swept up and removed - not only does she intentionally create her own facade, her apparitions constantly perform mental surgery to support it. It puts everything in a pretty satisfying context

3:42 - Ill take [feats you can only perform in animation](http://i.imgur.com/WMxzE85.jpg) for 500. This sequeeeence

5:39 - Just by having a home to go back to, why do I feel like I can do anything? Interesting. So Hanekawas acceptance of the situation has at least given her *stress* a home, even if she still considers herself homeless?

6:22 - [*THESE... COLOR SCHEMES... HNNGGHHHH...*](http://i.imgur.com/06Q4XgS.jpg)

7:26 - But seriously, [all anime looks the same](http://i.imgur.com/ceM0iC1.jpg), amirite?

8:01 - I dont know everything, *but everything burns.* Isin is having too much fun with that catchphrase

9:01 - Doesnt she know better than anyone that the concept of natural parents is nonsense? Ooh, sick burn, tiger!

9:44 - I am a machine. [*I will not be moe.*](http://i.imgur.com/ioOAOjG.jpg) The tiger is firm on this

12:18 - [Massive pallete shift when Hanekawa takes over.](http://i.imgur.com/fBk6HYd.jpg) Interestingly, the exterior world has shifted from artificial bright white to natural near-blacks

12:47 - I dont want to be real. I want to be human. Man, in the context of this series, a line like that...

13:03 - Lets eat a meal together. The catalyst that started both the conflict and the actual arc, and the simple act they spent an entire episode demonstrating her ability to do with Senjougahara

13:34 - When narrative catharsis fails, [try electricity](http://i.imgur.com/TkT7mtR.jpg)

14:40 - She called me part of her family! Does Isin have problems at home or something? Family troubles on the brain. Also, [dear lord these shots](http://i.imgur.com/tknEnxK.png)

15:35 - These GODDAMN TEXT SCREENS. This is actually the first episode I havent paused to read all of them. Frickin Daisuki player...

16:35 - [Bet you think youre pretty cool, huh, Araragi?](http://i.imgur.com/peboKFe.png)

19:00 - Ive always wanted him to pat me like this. ...yeah. Well, Araragi *did* have to come back to actually resolve the envy/I never told him thread. His hero act kinda makes me gag though

Oh wait, holy shit, this arc is from Hanekawa's perspective. This is *Hanekawa's* Araragi

20:09 - Fantastic. I love the shift from Oh jeez, I got rejected to [actually embracing her emotions](http://i.imgur.com/11CqB3b.jpg) as she draws back the apparitions

**And Done**

Whew! What an episode! Maybe its just cause it was narrated by the actually-coherent Hanekawa, but that was a really satisfying arc. Everything resolved in extremely cathartic fashion, the threads tied together in a very neat narrative bow, there were a number of standout scenes (that drawing her sadness back into herself has to be one of my favorite moments of the series so far, and the Shinobu/Neko conversation was also great), and dear god was it beautiful. This show is always beautiful, but this episode was *gorgeous*. Firing on all cylinders indeed - this will be a *damn* hard act to top. Nice work Isin, nice work Shinbo. That was fantastic.

-old posts are [here](http://wrongeverytime.com/)-
>> ARTICLE
On the whole narrative catharsis thing, I think the fight/action scenes (even throughout the series) are just analogies for conflict. Hanekawa trying to fight the Tiger, fail, and saved by Araragi? Hanekawa is trying to get herself proper, fails, Araragi helps her.
>> ARTICLE
Just a note: [Shinobu](http://bakemonogatari.wikia.com/wiki/Shinobu_Oshino) is the vampire's name, not Hanekawa's.

*Palette* shift. Pallet shifting requires a forklift. Nice write up, again. I never really thought about how the perspective is changed, but it makes a lot more sense now regarding how the characters are acting in this series.

Keep the forklift. We'll need it for the boxes full of Narrative Analysis papers.
>> ARTICLE
>Oh wait, holy shit, this arc is from Hanekawa's perspective. This is Hanekawa's Araragi

Yes, I absolutely love how they can portray the characters differently based on who is viewing them. You mentioned this in a previous episode, how usually from Araragi's point of view, Senjougahara looks beautiful and frightening, but from Hanekawa's POV, she seems more normal, almost odd at times.

Another example would be how almost every scene involving Kanbaru when Araragi was about involved her being either naked or scantily clad, with constant camera cuts to her curves, as if Araragi was sneaking a peek. However, when Hanekawa meets Kanbaru, nothing of the sort occurs.
>> ARTICLE
> nothing of the sort occurs

Sure it did, except it was Kanbaru doing the ogling this time.
>> ARTICLE
exactly, Araragi's giving the male gaze. Hanekawa's receiving it. Kanbaru doesn't matter so much as the POV's perception of her.
>> ARTICLE
Already!?

Alright then, first of all [here's a gif!](http://i.imgur.com/o58Kbdk.gif)

Secondly, that letter scene.

Thirdly, ARARARARARAGI-KUN.
>> ARTICLE
The letter scene was pretty cool. It seems they used similar effects of the opening.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the letter scene alot especially because it remembered me a little bit of the ending from [Tasogare OtomexAmnesia](/s " when they were writing a letter without seeing eachother") wich i found really good...
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I just realized that Hanekawa's issues really reflects a lot of cultural issues in Japan and other asian countries - that of image. She's to weary of her perfect, white image that she tries to put on. She doesn't want to trouble her step parents, she doesn't want to trouble her friends with her issues at home, and she doesn't want to trouble Araragi with her feelings for him. 

She feels too pressured by her society to be pure white, that she can't handle stress, envy or any negative emotions. Being able to take those would make her a better person, *but she doesn't want to trouble others*.
>> ARTICLE
That personalities of her is what makes me rooting for Hanekawa since Bakemonogatari. Now that she is more open, and accept many bad traits of human like envy, sad, angry, she's becoming more complete as human in my eyes. Damn, just looking back at what she's been going through, struggle to hide it, and finally accept it brings me so many feels...


>> ARTICLE
Well I thought the Letter scene was great, until I watched it subbed...

I know there are things you have to cut for an adaptation and certain things irked me that they left out, but this is absolutely deplorable.

"Araragi-kun had argued that this was all too much to call a miracle  because my way of being is not a miracle, but something much worse, the result of a bloody struggle.

"It seems that, when counselling a child who is not loved by her parents, or in other words, who has been abused during her upbringing, the most difficult task is first having that child admit that she has been abused.

To admit the fact that she is being tyrannized.

To accept that you are not loved by your parents is no easy matter.

In most cases, the child will treat the truth of her abuse as not having happened. Perhaps by distorting the facts into some sort of explanation, or by simply treating the truth itself as not having occurred; there are many variations to the condition, but the point they all share is that they turn their backs on reality.

Yes, I shall admit to it now.

I was abused by my parents as I grew up.

I ignored my own pain, thinking that it happened in all families, to some greater or lesser degree. Even when I was struck on the face, I did not think that it was abuse. I did not think so. Just like that, I cut away this stress as the Cat, and treated it as though it never happened.

In the first place, if you were to ask me to define the meaning of abuse, it would be extremely easy and, at the same time, extremely difficult.

The act of abuse can be established even without violence. Taken to the extreme  though this was in fact quite a common view  spoiling is also a form of abuse.

The abuse known as education. The abuse known as discipline.

The abuse known as nursing. The abuse known as filiation.

Perhaps even the opinion that anything a parent does to a child is decidedly abusive is ultimately feasible and, depending on the argument, not something to be completely denied, and but rather deserving to be heard. After all, we do not accept such logic as abuse not actually counting as such when approved of by the victim  it is an ambiguous argument, but we simply cannot pass judgement without a comprehensive picture.

That was the reason why I could continue to assert it.

I could keep on turning my eyes away, asserting that I was not being abused."

This was bar none, the most important part of the entire Nekomonogatari story and it got cut entirely.

It really makes me sad because I loved the way the scene was edited, but I can't honestly say I liked it when they fucked up this bad.

**Edit:** despite what I've said I did love the episode and I guess this just means I have to use an excerpt from the novel when dealing with stubborn people who only want to see the worst possible interpretation of events. Ha sounds familiar

>> ARTICLE
Holy shit are you serious, I was so looking forward to that letter.  They cut it?  Fuck that.  That letter MADE the entire goddamn novel.
>> ARTICLE
Who made the decision? From what I've read, it sounds like Nisio is really involved with these adaptations, and he spends a lot of time in the studio. 
>> ARTICLE
This is kind of similar to the "Senjougahara personality change"  monologue that was left out of Nisemonogatari.

I think Shaft prefers to show the *result* of these character paradigm shifts rather than simply a monologue.

Now, I haven't read Neko:Shiro, but having read your extract, while enlightening, a lot of the things Hanekawa is talking about have been subtly mentioned in Neko:Kuro and Neko:Shiro arcs in the anime. 

Although it can seem this way for someone who had already read the novel and was looking forward to this part, I believe they did a good job at conveying this information to us.

(Well, that is just my take on the matter, I could be wrong though, I rewatched Neko:Kuro in anticipation for this episode so I could be over-thinking things)
>> ARTICLE
Here's part of it though: We don't really get to see Hanekawa from this point on, so there's no chance to show this like there has been for Senjougahara.
>> ARTICLE
The difference is that Senjougahara's personality change has no counterpoint. You know she has changed and it is simply a matter of finding out why if you hadn't already done so.

Hanekawa's issues with her parents have an opposing argument in Oshino's perspective. Neko Kuro spent a lot of time showing how her perfection makes other people feel digusted by her and had a huge speech by Oshino about it affecting her parents. Neko White was suppose to be the counterargument, but it spends a lot of time putting Hanekawa in the wrong. There are a few scenes that show people don't think too highly of her parents like Mamaragi and Hitagi saying such, but in the context of Oshino's speech is just makes it seem like they are the result of Hanekawa's problems instead of the cause. Without Hanekawa's speech the balance of it is wrecked and the context of the situation is the opposite of intended.

**Edit:** You are right though and there are scenes which show it, I'm just being more concerned with shutting down the opposite interpretation than anything else
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if [spoiler](/s " but In the light novel didn't Hanekawa get all her clothes burned off?")
>> ARTICLE
Uh... so, uh... when are we going to get BDs?
>> ARTICLE
i was actually surprised how long those feeble garments could burn.. BD version is a must for all monogatari series
>> ARTICLE
"I don't know everything, but everything burns" might single handedly be my favourite line in all of fiction, mind you I'm fanboying pretty hard right now so the lustre may wear off by tomorrow.

Edit: Alright, downgraded to "favourite line in all of anime" but that's still not a low bar.
>> ARTICLE
Araragi's return was not exactly as I had pictured it, I had hoped it would be more like [this](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbp1318UrL1ryic6eo1_500.gif), but at least everyone got a little taste of how bad ass Araragi is when he actually decides to fight.

Oh, and my fun fact from the LN for this episode is that the cat is a male kai, and questions for a moment the correctness of it being called a "little sister."

The quote if you were interested: 

"Besides, I was male when I was run over, so its weird to call me a little sister  and in the first place, even though my base was the Hindering Cat, seeing as I was created by raw material cut off from Mistress, my gender isnt just vague, its undeniably a grey area between being a sister and being a brother nyah."
>> ARTICLE
As I mentioned previously a few episodes ago, Hanekawa's situation at home is partly hers to blame. Sure, any reasonable couple would expect to give a room to a guest or their step-child, but they didn't. However, Hanekawa also never *asked* for a room. She was too "pure, whiteness" to ask for one, to bother someone else to give into her "selfishness". She just accepted everything as it came, never mentioning her dissatisfaction except once to Araragi in Neko: Kuro.

Then at the end she finally realized this was not satisfactory to her standards. She finally came to terms with her inner feelings and her inner selves. Then she finally asked her parents for a room to call her own. She certainly grew quite a bit as a character by the end of this arc. I have to wonder if the little cat hair-tie dropping on the floor at the end symbolized she was moving on from Black Hanekawa, accepted her feelings and will not longer be possessed by spirits or other unnatural things.

Somewhat off topic, but I wonder how Japanese viewers watch it when the static text screens flash by so quickly. I would be pretty mad on missing out on some content just because I didn't have the option to pause. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never actually paused all of the flashy text. When I did try and make it out it's usually just repeating something that's already happened or spelling out something blatantly obvious.
>> ARTICLE
That's true. Though toward the end the text seemed like it was saying what Hanekawa felt about Araragi's arrival.
>> ARTICLE
So I've watched the episode a couple times already and I noticed they didn't include one of the lines from the light novel which I thought was a given. [LN Spoilers] (/s "Araragi- 'Actually, I dropped everything and came running after I saw that picture you sent of you wearing casual clothes!'") I just thought that was important enough to include.
>> ARTICLE
I think they were trying to emphasize how Hanekawa saw him as a badass.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god that music. It's amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
Can someone screenshot all the text screens please? I can't even pause that fast to read them all.
>> ARTICLE
If using MPC-HC:

Pause before text screens -> hold ctrl and tap the right arrow to slowly move frame by frame.
>> ARTICLE
I  just  stare  at  them  understand by pricing the words together that I see.
>> ARTICLE
man, i abused the FUCK out of my space bar this episode. I probably added in an extra 5 or so minutes of back and forth trying to catch them all.
>> ARTICLE
Only five?

I looked at the clock and I realised I spent about 70 minutes watching this. Then again, I was hitting up my Japanese-English dictionary so much because the dialogue is really interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's pretty easy in MPC to just hit left arrow after all of them fly by then hammer space bar as they start coming up, then pay attention to the dialogue after i have read them.

That animation during the monologue to Black Hanekawa.

It feels like Shaft cranked the animation up a notch in this one! Usually, during the monologues we see random flashing scenes with kanji and body parts with kanji on them. But instead we got a really cool animation!

That was pretty cool.

And I loved the Chocolate Insomnia instrumental that played during the resolution.

Felt like a Tarantino-style montage partly because of the music playing during the monologue.

sasugararagi-kun

I absolutely loved how complete her story and character felt by the end. We've all seen plenty of attempts at a good "tadaima" delivery in a way that truly means something, but that was probably the best that I can really recall. I'm not sure I can properly articulate how I feel about her character overall, but I know I am immensely happy for her.

They never left him really, and both him and Shinobu's strength seems to be based of how much of his blood she drinks.

I know that i just meant he seemed a lot more powerful than usual
>> ARTICLE
This is from Hanekawa's perspective, so he's going to look pretty badass. Also we have no idea what he's been doing this whole time and whether it required some increased vampire powers. Not to mention he had the element of surprise. I'm sure the jumps down were nothing compared to the beatings he's received from the monkey, the cat and his own sister.
>> ARTICLE
It's also important to mention that Oshino says they may return to being vampires eventually. 
>> ARTICLE
[Kizu spoilers] (/s "I just finished kizu. That could only really happen if he let her take too much blood, but given her behavour at the end of kizu she'd probably just let him take her blood again.")
>> ARTICLE
Not necessarily, you'll notice throughout the series that she needs less and less blood, getting to the point where she no longer needs it. 
>> ARTICLE
Her and Araragi formed a link when she started living in his shadow. Her personality has come back somewhat but she doesn't seem any more powerful in general. She hasn't grown at all, except for when Araragi let her feed.
>> ARTICLE
Yes but in the latest series she's seen without Araragi and mentions that their bond has been "severed" temporarily. She'd have to have become stronger in order for that to happen. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap this episode was amazing!!! I always loved Hanekawa's arcs and this one has to be the best I have seen. I loved the whole confession and acceptance scene (may have teared up a little) and totally squealed in delight with the whole "tadaima" monologue at the end.

It's gonna be a long 2 weeks till the start of new episodes

Blame Tsukihi. She caused the whole thing.

She told Araragi that his feelings are nothing more than reverence in previous Nekomonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
I hope not. The fact that Araragi rejects Hanekawa, and that she can deal with it is a huge part of her development (and the damn conclusion for the entire arc!).
>> ARTICLE
I will always root for Hanekawa, I think they should've been together or at least had more of a thing happen. I can't say i'm unsatisfied with Gahara and Araragi though, they're just as perfect together. 


>> ARTICLE
Although I think Hanekawa had to get turned down so she could merge with Black Hanekawa and Kako. If she actually got together with Araragi, and didn't have such a big pain as being rejected from him, she would continue creating monsters.
>> ARTICLE
I agree it was entirely neccessary for her to get rejected.
>> ARTICLE
Hanekawa just got rejected in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Still plenty of novels left, but I don't see Araragi's feelings changing at all

As bad as I feel for Hanekawa I think putting her with Araragi would be bad writing, hands down. I actually hope she goes through with her montage plans and travels after graduation.

I was rewatching Bakemonogatari while watching this season's monogatari. You realize that some things are referenced really early on that isn't referenced again until much later (Like Episode who appeared for 0.1 second in the first episode of Bakemonogatari).

Hanakawa was actually already planning to travel abroad for two years. This was revealed during Bakemonogatari in the Nadeko Snake arc before she realized just how much Araragi being with Senjougahara bothered her. This is nearly 4 years apart when these two events occurred in terms of when both the novels (06-10) and the anime (09-13) were released 
>> ARTICLE
All Tsukihi's fault.
>> ARTICLE
So i have heard great things about this anime, But I'm confused in the sense of what is the order that the series go in. I know there is one called Bakemonogatari, is that the first or is their one before it. And is this the second or is their another one i am missing. Any help would be very apreciated
>> ARTICLE
Dude, you don't know how many millions of people have already asked this question
>> ARTICLE
The broadcast order is Bake-Nise-Neko(Black), but the chronological order is Neko(Black)-Bake-Nise. All those are considered the first 'season'. For this second season they decided to bunch them all the new ones together and call it the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the help.
>> ARTICLE
**Airing Order:**
 Bake --> Nise --> Neko:Kuro --> Monogatari S2

**Chronological Order:**
Neko:Kuro --> Bake --> Nise --> Monogatari S2


**Bakemonogatari** is the first part of the entire first season and covers the first two novels both named Bakemonogatari. (15 Episodes)

**Nisemonogatari** is the second part of the first season and covers the fourth and fifth novels both named Nisemonogatari, these events occur after Bakemonogatari. (11 Episodes)

**Nekomonogatari:Kuro** is prequel and occurs before the events in Bakemonogatari, it covers the sixth novel in the series. (4 Episodes)

**Kizumonogatari**, a yet to be released movie, happens before Nekomonogatari Kuro, and is the first thing to ever happen in the entire story, it was the third released novel but the first event of the entire story.

**Monogatari Series Second Season**, (currently airing) is in fact the second season. It covers novels seven through twelve. (26 Episodes)


Edit: Details

With the popularity of this show, i REALLY hope they release the books. I'm going to want something to read in between Spice and Wolf releases.

Not only that, but apparently huge portions are being cut out or changed. I'd really like to get as much of the original work as possible.

Maybe, but i bet enough of it would come across that it'd still work out as an interesting story.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's possible with some real effort. The 8thsin translation of the Bakemonogatari recap episode was amazing (or at least what I watched of it, I mostly just remember being *really* impressed with how they adapted all the weight crab wordplay).
>> ARTICLE
So confusing..... But thanks anyway. May I ask what you thought of the anime?
>> ARTICLE
My initial thoughts when I first started this anime was 'This is boring.' The constant talking is so hard to sit through and listen to, it took me two weeks to finish the first 4 episodes. Once I settled down and really decided to give it a chance, there was no turning back, I fell in love with everything, the soundtrack, art, banter, and the characters. I love this anime, it's easily my favorite and most beloved. 

I've rewatched it multiple times now and honestly, it's like it got better each time. I caught so many things that slipped by me during the first watch and because of that, the show got better. I strongly reccommend rewatching the show once you finish because once you're given the context, everything slips together so smoothly through the second watch through, its like rediscovering the show.

I find this show to be spectacular, one of the best and most difficult shows to watch, but damn it all, it's so worth it. It's witty, funny, serious, light-hearted, perverted, artsy, erotic, but not distasteful. The only issue with the show is that its so difficult to get into if you're new to anime or not used to heavy dialogue. 

It's also hard to get into if you're expecting heavy plot, because if there's something that ~monogatari seems to be lacking, it's plot. But that's why Monogatari S2 is here. The entire first season (Bake, Nise, Neko) is basically a long drawn out introduction to each character. Monogatari Season 2 is the plot of each individual character. Not the story of and told by Koyomi who met these characters and is now solving all their problems. 

But despite this, the way they made the show is what's making it work so well. They are (so far) staying very true to the LNs which is another thing that's fantastic. I reccommend reading the already translated ones.

But really I think in some twisted way it's just a cleverly made reverse-harem or something. I dunno. I like the show. It's awesome.
>> ARTICLE
It's not confusing at all: always watch broadcast order.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man. That sequence at the beginning where Hanekawa reads the text of the letter and the animation transitions between all those different scenes. This is why Shaft is my favorite studio. That sequence may just have become my second favorite scene in anime, behind the phone call scene from ef: A Tale of Memories. Beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone explain why Araragi's clothes were all ragged?
>> ARTICLE
Most likely his clothing was damaged in the situation he was handling before coming to Hanekawa's rescue, we'll see later on in the episodes (can't wait) 
>> ARTICLE
yup that what it says in the light novel
>> ARTICLE
This episode was so satisfying to watch.
All of the shifts were perfect, I loved it! 

But what I'm confused about is why everyone saying Araragi looks like a badass? Of course he would naturally look like a badass, it's from Hanekawa's POV, considering that well...he might as well be Adonis. 

Anyways, I'm sad that Araragi and H-san probably won't end up together, not that I don't like him with Gahara, but mostly because of their history, I would've liked them to be together. Hanekawa you dog, (or should I say cat?) you should've been honest from the start and everything would've been perfect :(

Ahh well, the way this episode drew the arc to a close was near perfect, I loved seeing Hanekawa finally embrace herself. I can't wait to see the human Hanekawa. Fantastic episode. 

But uhh...she looks like a punk with her black and white hair though, it made me giggle. 
>> ARTICLE
Araragi, Gahara, and Hanekawa all like each other, both as friends and possibly romantically considering that shower scene earlier.  Why not have a long-term threesome?

*sexually

Did anybody else catch Black Hanekawa's play on words with the signature hanekawa quote "I don't know everything, I just know what I know"? (at 05:38 ish) she replaced most of it with "nyah" so it ended up being "I'm a cat. I don't cry. I just meow."

I'm enjoying this season a *lot* more than previous seasons.  I dunno, the characters just seem a lot more relateable and realistic.  Hanekawa and Senyawaba, as the most down to Earth characters, have always been my favorites.

Niw that Araragi's back, we'll see how things change.  I've never hidden the fact that I dislike Araragi, if not as a character then as a person, so I hope the season doesn't change too much with the MC back in it.

Hoooly crap, I love the way this episode pulled everything together.  Kind of sad that it's likely the last we'll see of Black Hanekawa, but since they're all one and the same I suppose we'll see her in spirit, going forward.  And of course we get the return of Araragi in style.
  
I feel like a lot of momentum was gained this week, can't wait to see what happens next week (or the week after, in the event of a recap episode).

Yes for once not having his ass kicked by an apparition

Great ending to the arc, araragi too damn GAR.

Really surprised at the recap episode... Shows that Shaft is still good ole shaft I guess >_>

Just a small question, How many episodes are there going to be?
>> ARTICLE
Of this arc? One more. 

Of the entire season? 26 episodes

They dropped Kanbaru's arc.

So the order is as follows:

Tsubasa --> Mayoi --> Sengoku --> Shinobu --> Senjougahara
>> ARTICLE
Aww, I hope they'll include Kanbaru's arc in somewhere in OVAs or later in the season or something.

They are. If you read the LNs, it sort of makes sense as to why they cut it out.

Thank you!

cant wait for the Shinobu arc!

The chocolate insomnia bgm reminded me of how Staple Stable was made a bgm back in Bakemonogatari. Does anybody have the chocolate insomnia ost used in this episode? They are obviously slow versions of the originals and that makes them awesome. I also believe that Renai Circulation and the other OPs of Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari were made into an ost/bgm like this.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that was probably the most powerful/best episode of a -Monogatari series I've seen and I don't even like Cat that much. 

Good fucking job Shaft.
>> ARTICLE
While second season is very good for the most part, Bake is by far the best in the series, in my opinion. 

It did everything right, atmosphere, bantering,  visuals(no more combinations with real images qq), soundtrack, fanservice placement, different relationships with other characters that don't feel strictly romantic, conclusions to arcs that saved the girls but not perfectly making it more realistic and interesting, and a couple that not only gets together(which doesn't happen often in anime) but also fit perfectly.

It only lacks Kaiki
>> ARTICLE
Do you feel like any of the character interactions are lost in translations?

I know the show is steeped in Japanese mythology and a lot of the puns/humor are rooted in the language, so I keep putting off the show until I reach at least N4 or N3 in my Jap studies
>> ARTICLE
> Do you feel like any of the character interactions are lost in translations?

Definitely, it's filled with puns and wordplay that requires you to know Japanese. 

That's also why there are no translations of the novels besides Kizu, it's practically impossible without butchering it.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari's soundtrack is probably the most underrated in the entire medium.

Also for Nisemonogatari, even if you are turned off by some of the fanservice I would recommend sticking it out because that season's ending is fantastic. I didn't really like the fanservice in Nise either but damn am I glad I watched it all the way through.

Now that I think about I do like a lot of the BGM.

Actually I'd watch Monogatari precisely because of the infamous "toothbrush scene". That is beyond the usual panty shot/low cut top on big breasted women type of fanservice. 

This WT! helps as well. I'll be sure to give this a try ASAP. Right after I finish Shinsekai Yori ofc.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, random panty shots are just lazy. The toothbrush scene was masterfully crafted fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
The beginning of Tsukimonogatari is pretty heavy too.
>> ARTICLE
I have seen monogatari gifs, and some make it look like an **incredibly artistic and well animated** show.

But to be honest, the reason i avoid it is because i heard how very lewd it is. Im **not** saying its bad (haven't watched it so i can't say), just that my personal taste does not allow me to enjoy lewd shows. Others may think its great.

How lewd it is? 

The phrase "fair bit of "fanservice" of your post is open to interpretation.

*'Sakura trick'* levels of lewd?  
*'To love ru' or 'highschool of the dead'* levels of lewd?  

Every time /r/anime discusses monogatari it is divided in 2 groups:

* Group 1 that says its a completely 100% perverted show with supernatural characters.  
  
* Group 2 that says its an artistic and complex show with just a liiiiittle and almost not noticeable amounts of perverted moments.
>> ARTICLE
It's not as lewd as highschool of the dead or highschool dxd, but sexuality is a big theme in the show.
>> ARTICLE
if you'll allow a necro - I'm going through the series now, and seems to be both groups are essentially right. In this sense, reminds me of "Lupin III : mine fujiko" - its both quite sexual, and/but also very artistic (in pretty much all the ways OP mentioned, from music, art design, cinematography, especially dialogue/writing, characterization and development ...)
>> ARTICLE
I just marathon/bingewatched all of Bake and stuff like blatantly sneaking up to a 10 year old grabbing her breasts from behind as a joke (I think?)  was the worst. Way too many camera angles and close ups of especially the younger girls made me want to distance myself from the series. The fact that they call stuff like that "fanservice".... really makes me wonder what kind of people these "fans" are...

Such a negative point in an otherwise entertaining series. I do feel I missed out on at least half the references/witty banter simply by not being either japanese or english but I can't fault the series for that.
>> ARTICLE
I like your username. I am drunk right now and reading though my most up voted comments and you replied to my club penguin comment and I just read it and I like you username.

>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, thanks! Your username makes a lot of sense right now ;)
>> ARTICLE
It's a different lewd. Common anime lewd is very troupe and out of place, but monogatari manages to introduce fanservice without it becoming distracting or out of place. Maybe except the infamous scene, but overall it adds to the series, and I can't see monogatari series being as great without the fan service.
>> ARTICLE
I think the biggest difference between Monogatari and other fanservice shows is that in Monogatari the females have a lot of power over Araragi. Most of the fan service in the show are purposefully done by the characters to fuck with Araragi, the only exception I can think of is Hanekawa. Almost all the fanservice including her are quick gazes by Araragi because he's very sexually attracted to her. But the fanservice is in no way there to turn the viewer on. This is made obvious when there are certain arcs where Araragi isn't present at all, and there's virtually no fanservice in those arcs.
>> ARTICLE
I hear you! The fan-service has been the topic of many a hot debate on this subreddit, and while I won't deny it's existence or claim that it's negligible... I'd like to say that the fanservice is done tastefully, and as I read elsewhere in the comments, 

> "Actually I'd watch Monogatari precisely because of the infamous "toothbrush scene". That is beyond the usual panty shot/low cut top on big breasted women type of fanservice."

The fan service exists, and there are some scenes with almost full nudity, but it never goes FULL To Love-Ru in terms of sexuality. It's light-hearted enough and relatively brief; I don't think there was ever a point where it was shoved into your face all episode to the point where it detached yourself from the story.

This is all of course, personally speaking.


>> ARTICLE
> the reason i avoid it is because i heard how very lewd it is.

This is a big deal breaker for me.  I'm not above sexytimes in my anime.  But it has to make sense narratively and support whatever is happening in the plot or theme of the show.  And the vast majority of the time, it's pure fan service in this series.  It not only adds nothing, but actively distracts from what's supposed to be going on.  There are entire stretches in this franchise where literally nothing happens except idle hanging out with MC's harem in compromising positions.  If you come for the fan service, that's fine.  But I need something more in my shows and this series falls flat on its face in that respect.
>> ARTICLE
honestly I wish "fanservice" would start consisting of straight-up foreplay and fucking scenes as opposed to the tropish contrivances. As it does in most live action. People cuddle and have sex rather regularly in their lives, so there should be non-4th wall breaking chances of introducing some minutes watching characters at it. At least its atmospheric and makes you horny. "Mine Fujiko" kinda does it directly like that, and even makes plot-use of sexuality decently.

I'm not exactly sure what animated accidental boob grabs pr panty shots are supposed to be doing for me at all.

EDIT: oh apologies for the necro, got carried away while reading the discussion.
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely different. I think there's a huge difference between showing girls falling on mc, girls throwing themselves on him with a lewd look on their faces and this, where they show shots of good looking art that happens to be half-to-full naked girls while a character narrates.

I'm a girl and the first type of fan service disturbs me not because I dislike seeing half naked girls or ecchi scenes but because it feels belittling, unnecessary and forced. In Monogatari though I don't find it annoying, it fits and it's quite nice.
>> ARTICLE
I recently finished Bake/Nisemonogatari and so far im loving the series. I came in thinking it was going to be over the top fan service, but was surprisingly underwhelmed by that aspect. Though the toothbrush scene was a bit much. 
>> ARTICLE
I do want to watch it even though I dislike overly fanservicey shows so if I do end up disliking at least I can say that I gave it a chance. 

The problem is that my backlog is fairly large and I usually only watch 2 or 3 episodes of anime a day. I'll get around to it one day.
>> ARTICLE
For some reason the fanservice in monogatari feels self-aware to me. I don't mind it nearly as much as other blatant fanservice. Could just be me, but in monogatari it doesn't bother me. Once you settle into it and get to know the characters and how the show works, I think you will enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't always hate fanservice. If it feels like it should be part of the show then I'm usually okay with it.

For example in Denki-gai No Hon'ya-san I felt the fanservice was pretty spot on for that type of show.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely! 

No harm in giving it a shot! It's currently one of my top ranking series' of all time. 


And I feel your pain with the backlog... I have so much backed up right now, I honestly feel like I'll never finish it.
>> ARTICLE
> Absolutely! No harm in giving it a shot!

Yep I usually do try to try out something before deciding whether or not it's for me. Because of this though I actually sat through two of the Twilight movies *Shudders*
>> ARTICLE
As much I liked Monogatari for it's interesting writing, art, cinematography, and fan service, I simply couldn't get behind that there is no driving plot moving things forward, and the whole series is just a collection of stories/vignettes of MC helping spirits/girls "move forward" because he's "a nice guy".

For me, it's a good anime. Not too sure about it being lauded so much.
>> ARTICLE
I guess you also don't like Cowboy Bebop because it's episodic?
>> ARTICLE
You're right it seems like a collection of shorts at first glance. I think by the beginning of Second Season you can puzzle up much of Koyomi background and explain why he is acting like he is. You can also tell by the second Mayoi arc and Shinobu flashback that there's something big at work, it's very apparent also in Tsukimonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
But Monogatari has a goal. Entire series point is to "change" Araragi just like all the girls in series changed.
>> ARTICLE
Does it have to have a driving plot to be great? A lot of episodic anime like Mushishi are amazing without it.
>> ARTICLE
Mononoke, Bebop, Mushishi, Usagi Drop (or a lot of SoL), etc. Not everything has to have a grand or epic plot like FMA:B to be good, and you'd be missing out on a lot of great shows if you think otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not op, but I found it funny that you bring Mushishi up, I for one quite enjoyed Mushishi and slice-of-life-esque shows (Life of High School Boys, Nichijou) but for some reasons I'm put off by Monogatari, partly because of the daring fanservice. The art is certainly well done, the sound is good too, but I just can't enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't hesitate when I say that it has the best cast of characters that I've seen in an anime, with emotional and relevant character arcs (mostly). The characters are really why I like it so much, plus I've never seen anything quite like. It's pretty fun to read into as well.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if Koyomi would ever help a guy that was in trouble. Literally the entire show is about him helping attractive girls.
>> ARTICLE
Without watching anything beyond Bakemonogatari, I assume it's just Araragi meeting a bunch of best girl stereotypes and solving their issues.
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly why I don't love the show as much as other people. The fact that he is the only male seems like pandering to me. Like, the point is to keep the viewer sexually stimulated at all times by showing girls in every scene. Every girl shares a deep connection with him and no other guy, but he shares a connection with all these girls. The only other male characters are 2 creepy (while awesome) old guys. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the heads-up, I must have missed that!
>> ARTICLE
I really loved Bakemonogatari because the visuals were very striking backed with some solid cinematography (extreme close up shots, lots of quick cuts between scenes) - its very apparent even in the first episode. These elements help make the show more interesting to watch despite featuring not that much action.

Also background music is indeed very underrated. Animation is good last I recalled.

Though I've put Nisemonogatari on hold for some reason. Wasn't aware there's so many seasons though, I guess I'll have to start back it up again.
>> ARTICLE
I just want to point out something people tend to fail to mention; This anime is mainly dialogue. There is little to no action that really happens aside from a hand full of scenes throughout the series. But don't let this deter you from watching it! Just come into this anime with that mindset and you will enjoy it more.
>> ARTICLE
I recently started watching Bakemonogatari and, while I like the writing and characters so far, the frequent subliminal messaging style cuts to random japanese phrases is really jarring and I'm not super fond of it. I'll probably end up watching the whole series, but I find it hard to sit through more than a couple episodes at a time. 
>> ARTICLE
the post shoved me in the right direction and the watch order pushed me over the edge. thanks op, i will check it out now. 
>> ARTICLE
> However, I'd argue the story-line isn't anything special. Don't get me wrong, it's very entertaining, and the story is entirely unique, but what wraps this series together so tightly is how extremely well done the characters are. They aren't static or stereotypical characters. They are deep, intricate, and they develop throughout the series based on their interactions with each other and their surroundings. Their relationship with each other and how they grow as individuals is so well thought out and believable that you almost begin to feel as if you're not watching an anime at all. 

Would it be accurate to say...

* Monogatari is a character-study series?

By chance, I caught this segment while skimming. I've tried watching the Monogatari series before and was bored by its plot, so this may shed some light on my view. 
>> ARTICLE
The characters is what truly made the series what it is for me. The story was entertaining enough, but seeing the characters change and develop as the story progresses is what made them so lovable.


Monogatari has been like any good book or series for me. I become so attached to the characters and their adventures, when the series is over, or the book is finished... I feel a bit depressed that I won't be able to continue to join these characters throughout their trials and tribulations.
>> ARTICLE
I recently gave monogatari another chance (previously watched Bake up to episode 6 but dropped it for idk what reason, probably because of the pacing and etc). Anyway, I remember when I first watched bake (before picking it up again), I was trying to pause the video to read each cut scene. DO NOT DO THIS! Anyway, each arc is really interesting. Bake is basically introducing the characters and explaining some things going on with them. But monogatari 2nd season basically goes more indept in those characters. I love how monogatari plays with words and use it so effectively and creatively. 

PS: I'm up to tsuki right now. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for this OP.  I will give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
Please do! But, again, no form of art or entertainment will ever be *everyone's* cup of tea, but at the very least please give it a shot; and if you don't like it... Well not much lost right? Other than maybe a little bit of your time ;). 
>> ARTICLE
I watched entire series around new year and I have to say it's one of my favorite right now!

I'm actually surprised how many people talk about ecchi aspect. Not only I found it to almost nonexistent but when they finally show you some naked bodies it;s done SO good that it either doesn't bother you at all or you enjoy beautiful ~~plot~~... ART! I MEAN ART!

Over all if you can stand minimum ecchi and LOTS of dialog then you should give it a go.
>> ARTICLE
New OP? Yes da. And it was glorious. 

I had been entertaining the possibility that they would do a Kaiki and Hitagi duet, but I never expected the retro 80s style and visuals. Thank you, SHAFT.

The entire episode had me expecting some Hotline Miami reference. [Daisuke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJDrXiMVndw) playing in [Kaiki's bar scene](http://i.imgur.com/0pg8otD.jpg) would have been almost perfect

That was so.... nostalgic. 

It's uncanny how they got it down.

Yeah, I was thinking about a duet too, and the retroness was perfect.

>> ARTICLE
Oh wow. Loved the OP.
>> ARTICLE
It is unbelievable how good the openings are in the monogatari series. 
>> ARTICLE
But if you think about it, the retro style mixed with current style fits perfectly. Kaiki is a middle aged man, so he sees the world differently than a teenager would. Making half the OP in the style of anime that would have been relevant when HE was a teenager and the other half of a current teenager is just plain brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
So, maybe Senjougara is reminding him of Touen?
>> ARTICLE
Possibly. He DID spend a awful lot of time trying to justify helping her in the first episode. Though i think that ended up being more because she was good friends with Kanbaru.

Damn, I didn't even realize that connection!

As expected of SHAFT, everything is all over the place but fits together perfectly to convey multiple meanings depending on how your brain analyses it.

Oh man Hitagi's reaction to Kaiki's assurance of her and Araragi's safety was so amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I went full "HNNNNNNNNNG!!1!1!1" when Hitagi came back from the bathroom with tears in her eyes. I really love this sensitive side of her. Why is she so perfect?
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to break it to you guys, but did you forget that Kaiki is the one narrating? He already said that his story will be full of lies. Do you really think that Gahara-san went all *dere* for him instead of all that just being one of Kaiki's fantasies?
>> ARTICLE
Ohhh, good point!
>> ARTICLE
Uh, no. First of all, why would Kaiki give us a false insight in that certain scene? And secondly, Senjougahara crying tears of joy and gratefulness and her being more "dere" overall is not surprising considering the character-development she went through after Nise. But if you mean that she looks cuter from Kaiki's perspective, then yeah, I agree. Her face at least looks rounder than usual.
>> ARTICLE
Wait! What if it is all a trick? Kaiki made up the "lie" about him being her first love.
>> ARTICLE
I actually thought she was cute this episode. She just seemed so small, haha! I mean, allow me to jump on the bandwagon that's continually talking about how great the camera angles are in this show, but seriously! Compared to how much of a daunting, intimidating figure she was in the earlier episodes of Bakemonogatari, it's kind of weird to see her so small and childish!

Also, it was really cute when she "stole" a doughnut from Kaiki as a sort-of-tsundere acceptance of his help.
>> ARTICLE
It's because we're seeing her from an adult's (Kaiki) perspective as opposed to how Ararararagi sees her normally.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man now that you mentioned it.. I totally remembered that's its kaiki that's narrating this
>> ARTICLE
Very true. You never really get to see the more delicate side of her expressed. It was a pretty endearing moment for sure.

Kaiki deciding not to betray Senjougahara and Araragi along with his duet with Senjougahara in the new OP...Kaiki has quickly become one of the most awesome characters in the series in only a few episodes!

Also, I wonder what's in Nadeko's closet that even surprized Kaiki. I doubt it's like an Araragi shrine since Kaiki already knows she loves him. But since she's insane, maybe it's a 'twisted' Araragi shrine - like photoshopped photos of Araragi and Nadeko?

It's probably not a shrine or anything. It's most likely something that would "destroy" her cute girl image. Probably something that isn't what a "cute" girl should do. Video games or something like that.

Absolutely excellent episode as always. Love the new OP. I was worried we wouldn't be getting anymore new OP's after the last two arcs, but nope Hitagi didn't let us down! 

- I loved Senjougahara expressions through this whole episode. This arc is the first, I think, that we've seen her be legitimately surprised or taken back. Like when she found out that Kaiki had actually met Nadeko, she was actually suprised. This arc is almost revealing a side of her character that we've never seen before, it's like for the first time she has become noticeably vulnerable. Especially with the fact that she cried, and thanked Kaiki. 

- That's an interesting plan that Kaiki has, and also an interesting perspective on why Nadeko wouldn't believe him. I guess it makes sense though. If you've lived you entire life never being lied to, and always being treated well then there would be no reason for you to ever suspect that someone would suddenly change all that and start lying to your face. As an aside I love how Nadeko's character has become so much more fleshed out this season. I have gone from really only wanting a happy ending for Senjougahara and Araragi, to honestly wanting a happy ending for everyone, Nadeko included. I hope she is able to get some kind of redemption at the end of this arc. 

- If Gaen knows everything, then how could her original plan involve Shinobu becoming a God, and not Nadeko? Surely she would have known that Nadeko was going to become a God, and the adjusted her plans accordingly? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding Gaen's clairvoyance. Is it that Gaen knows everything that already is, or that Gaen knows everything that is and will be? In the last arc she knew that Araragi and Ononoki would show up at her door, and ask he for help; so I'm leaning towards her being omniscience. But of course that leads back to the original problem of why didn't she know Nadeko would be a god. Also then wouldn't Gaen know that Kaiki wasn't serious when he said he was going to pull out. I don't know, but I think I may be confused about the extent of Gaen's abilities.   

Aww, and they leave us with the massive cliffhanger! Well obviously I can't wait for next week to come. If I were to speculate I think whatever is in her closet would be something relating to her naivety, and immaturity. Perhaps Nadeko isn't as simple as Kaiki has been thinking. Ahhh, come on Shaft! There have been so many shows with cliffhangers lately, but this is the one I'm most anxious about. 
>> ARTICLE
Gaen knows what is currently going on.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, so it's not like she knows the future. She is just aware of current situations. 
>> ARTICLE
As far as we know Gaen is a normal human. She's probably not omniscient, she just has a ridiculous information network, possibly making use of oddities. This notion is somewhat confirmed by Kaiki's question today about if the person tailing him was one of her henchmen. 
>> ARTICLE
> Especially with the fact that she cried, and thanked Kaiki.

[She was very emotional in Tsubasa Tiger arc, she cried too](http://i.minus.com/ibaIMSVzF2ngQm.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Oh you're right, I had forgotten about that.
>> ARTICLE
when Saito Chiwa can get emotional.. she really outdoes herself.
>> ARTICLE
About Gaen, remember that her plan with Shinobu would have worked out if it wasn't for Ougi's meddling. I don't know what she is, but I think Ougi and her actions are somehow "outside" of Gaen's omniscience, if that makes any sense.
>> ARTICLE
It's also possible that Gaen knew what ougi was up to, and LET it happen because making Shinobu a god by way of that would be easier than just setting her up as one directly. 

Think about it, if a snake god goes rampaging through the town because someone lied to her, and gets taken out by a little blond girl, convincing everyone else that SHE was a god too wouldn't be all that hard now, would it? Instead of trying to just plop her down and TELL everyone "Hey, shes a god, you should all pay your respects."
>> ARTICLE
Except we already learned that in the prior arc that they can't just make a vampire be like a god because that darkness will just simply eliminate the god wannabe. On the other hand if shinobu had fused with that talisman then she could actually transform into a proper one, but of course someone else interfered with that plan. Hmmm.
>> ARTICLE
It's possible that Shinobu might be able to still become a god through "eating" Nadeko too though. At least that was my second best guess.
>> ARTICLE
But the past arc, Shinobu was **pretending to** be a god instead of a vampire apparition, so she got punished for it by the darkness.

In present time in the series, Gaen was planning for Shinobu to **become a god** by whatever method she was planning, whether it was eating the seal that housed the snake god(b4 interference of Ougi and nadeko ofc) or sucking out the god that possess nadeko. 

In this case it would be okay for Shinobu to by worshipped as a god because she isn't pretending.(If she does become one)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for elaborating and expanding on what I wrote.

Have you guys seen this OP? Seriously guys. Holy shit this OP. Ermahgerd. Im not gonna be able to say anything worth reading until we get through that beautiful ridiculous thing, so lets just start the show.

**Episode 23**

0:05 - [Being such a best character does sound pretty exhausting](http://i.imgur.com/9cpfqZK.jpg)

0:23 - [More of this city as weve never known it](http://i.imgur.com/hwtfDd1.jpg)

0:40 - [Senjougahara lays out an attack in her usual style, something that would leave Araragi fumbling](http://i.imgur.com/1K0jDY7.jpg) (and the camera fumbling breathily as well, though here were just getting slow shots of furniture)...

0:47 - [And Kaiki says,](http://i.imgur.com/xlsS6bV.jpg) quit screwing around, [little girl](http://i.imgur.com/Vv0goa8.jpg). Refusing to acknowledge her as a person who could even use sexuality as a weapon. Same as he did last week with Nadeko - his only response to her advances was a kind of awkward pity. Hes stomping right through the charged adolescent nonsense Araragi has consistently enabled

1:14 - [Oh my god here we go yes.](http://i.imgur.com/yfFBkPF.jpg) It is glorious

1:24 - [A duet between the two masters of cold sarcasm](http://i.imgur.com/8Fqv5Ud.jpg) that is itself a mocking riff of 80s romance. Holy shit

1:44 - [Kaiki yes you are the best.](http://i.imgur.com/OzKioe6.jpg) Hell, its not hard to believe his actual sense of style and romance kind of froze sometime in the mid-80s anyway. The height of cool

2:07 - [And the song itself is so perfectly hokey.](http://i.imgur.com/8WquvIx.jpg) This is just an incredibly thing

2:19 - [One more shot of dashing 80s Kaiki](http://i.imgur.com/D14W13q.jpg)

2:31 - [She looks pretty silly in that hat.](http://i.imgur.com/Yu0b0qg.jpg) We havent had a single Araragi-Senjougahara scene this season, have we?

3:14 - [I really could listen to Kaiki be dry and insincere all day](http://i.imgur.com/cWBE1CM.jpg)

4:04 - [Araragi makes her seem so scary, too!](http://i.imgur.com/iBua0iU.jpg) Its like shes just a brittle, hyper-defensive teenager or something

4:11 - [An expression weve never seen from her.](http://i.imgur.com/bSHLit4.jpg) Like she got scolded by the teacher which she pretty much did

4:34 - [Kaiki suggests honesty](http://i.imgur.com/vgKTXEW.jpg)

6:23 - [His greatest power.](http://i.imgur.com/lGAGukK.jpg) It seems like his familiarity with lying makes him very aware of when its best to be direct

6:26 - [These shots are so good.](http://i.imgur.com/v0dxzlQ.jpg) Its hard to square this cute kid Senjougahara with the crazy-woman of Neko Shiro, or the intimidating sexuality of Bake #12

6:54 - [Tellin it like it is.](http://i.imgur.com/JD6DsZB.jpg) Araragi fucked up big time, and his mercy towards Nadeko might get any number of people killed

7:04 - [Why do they all assume thatd even be a possible scenario?](http://i.imgur.com/yL0BQoB.jpg) Once again, [I fully agree with Kaikis expression](http://i.imgur.com/kFGXGLg.jpg)

Goddamn is Kaiki a great presence here. /u/SohumB proposed the idea that hes about as close to an author avatar as we could get - Isin himself coming in and saying look, this isnt sexy. Youre all really weird. Stop doing that. You all know *my* thoughts on this series - it wouldnt surprise me if this were the creators just throwing up their hands and admitting the audience wont realize the character perspectives arent aligned with the show perspective unless someone comes along to directly tell the characters theyre acting like children

8:16 - [Nadeko is very powerful, but fortunately shes not much of a person, and Kaiki is very good at people](http://i.imgur.com/9NFj6ib.jpg)

8:40 - [Again, I love the interplay of honesty and dishonesty in Kaikis worldview.](http://i.imgur.com/Ks7YAyE.jpg) He sees things as they really are, unfettered by peoples expectations or assumptions, and thus can see the simplest route to a solution

9:18 - [An interesting position.](http://i.imgur.com/4SLOIej.jpg) Like shes never had a meaningful enough interaction with anyone to see them as complex beings with more than one way of acting. Which certainly fits with her initial conception as the demented endpoint of the helpless moe girl - she has about as much ability to read people as [Fuko](http://i.imgur.com/c1OAYTW.jpg)

9:38 - [Nobody home](http://i.imgur.com/ITgJsta.jpg)

10:12 - [Hell, even her conception of love fits perfectly in with that archetypes home](http://i.imgur.com/maj1nzE.jpg) - a love for stories where nothing ever progresses, where relationships dont actually move beyond yearning and everyone stays in a happy limbo

10:47 - [No Kaiki dont leave this show needs you](http://i.imgur.com/0kRL5hq.jpg)

10:52 - [Kaiki, did you forget these are anime high schoolers?!](http://i.imgur.com/zinRv9e.jpg) Hand-holding is lewd and kissing is for after marriage!

12:26 - [Man this series is good.](http://i.imgur.com/mryMday.jpg) Nice performance here

13:18 - [Oh god. Is this Gaens fault?](http://i.imgur.com/2reFN78.jpg)

Its also great seeing Kaiki be all grumbly about the expenses hell incur saving their lives. I figured the Hanekawa show would be my favorite sub-show within Monogatari, but Kaiki is blowing away the competition

14:42 - [Oh right, shes always had her gimmicks.](http://i.imgur.com/hWDa7Fj.jpg) Another very Isin choice - having the characters try on different catchphrases. Peace peace certainly doesnt match by that time youll already be torn to pieces, though

14:47 - [He always knows just what to say](http://i.imgur.com/k2Q3bei.jpg)

15:20 - [I really like these little jump cut sequences.](http://i.imgur.com/bvjATK3.jpg) Its already abundantly clear that were in Kaikis headspace here - so why do we get this drawn-out sequence of shots where he settles himself into his chair? It seems like hes a person whos always firmly aware of his self - his physical appearance, his poses, and everything he is visually communicating through his actions. Nothing is unchosen with Kaiki - his self-focus certainly leans into pride (as stuff like his childish disguise fight with Senjougahara demonstrates), but it clearly indicates he is always aware of his own representation

15:42 - [Three million yen? Pfff.](http://i.imgur.com/AGo0cyn.jpg) Yeah, Kaikis the actual hero of this story. And its great that we get the thirty minutes later before he declines - like we missed another soliloquy, with him once again convincing himself to do the job in spite of the person who was the reason he initially convinced himself actively paying him *not* to do it

17:11 - [So Ougi disrupted a plan that involved having Shinobu become a god?](http://i.imgur.com/Xad4IH6.jpg) Ougis been all over the place here - setting Nadeko on the path to godhood, offering Araragi perspective on Mayois situation, possibly being the force responsible for Mayois disappearance. Who is she working for? If Shinobu were intended to be a god by Gaen, that *couldnt* be good for Araragi right? Or would that have simply removed him from his responsibilities, with Gaen now willing to take up Oshinos role? And why did the town need a god in the first place?

Eh. Were gonna need more spoilers than that to sort out this mess

18:41 - [What a friggin heartwarming arc were getting to end on.](http://i.imgur.com/VEDAf79.jpg) And hey, Kaiki solved his finance troubles!

20:25 - [Nadeko you so damn crazy](http://i.imgur.com/IZu0HM3.jpg)

22:16 - [No powers. Hes just good at his job](http://i.imgur.com/9Y0HOsx.jpg)

22:37 - [Damn cliffhangers! What could possibly provoke that face?!](http://i.imgur.com/kGhQCFN.jpg)

**And Done**

Keep it up, Kaiki. Your monologue is incredibly entertaining, your perspective is welcome and continuously enlightening, and watching you play the Batman role in this universe is extremely satisfying. Ill miss you when youre gone, but at least youre getting a five-episode arc to finish this season in style.

-[old posts are here](http://wrongeverytime.com/)-
>> ARTICLE
I know this may be obvious, but I really liked how small Senjougahara seemed in this episode. Her physical body seems to take up much less screen space in her conversations with Kaiki than to Araragi and Hanekawa. It drives home Kaiki's perspective of her as just a child.


>> ARTICLE
> possibly being the force responsible for Mayois disappearance.

I don't think this could be. When she first spoke to Nadeko, she was unaware of Mayoi's disappearence. Ougi and the Kuriyami are probably just two sides of the same coin. They're similar in a lot of ways, most notably in the way that we know close to nothing at all about either of them. 

> And why did the town need a god in the first place?

I'd say to balance out another great force that's was there at the time or something of the like. Around the time he got the talisman (probably late August/September, ~4 months before this story) Episode and Gaen were in town. I'd say that's when he got the talisman and that event that involved Episode and Gaen is probably the reason as to why Gaen wanted a God in the town. Araragi probably just stalled because he didn't want Shinobu to become a God again because emotional bonds and such and then the whole Nadeko thing happend Oct 31st and yeah.

It's probably a longshot, but it makes the most sense to me. 




>> ARTICLE
> Ougi and Mayoi

I should really plot out this whole timeline or something - do we know when that Nadeko conversation was relative to Araragi's classroom conversation with Ougi? Because up until the Araragi conversation, no-one outside of Araragi, Gaen, and Ononoki were aware Mayoi had disappeared, so she could very well have still been hunting her at that point. I also recall stuff from that Nadeko conversation possibly implying Ougi has a loose relationship with time itself, but I'd have to check that.

> Why they needed a god

There are a lot of presumably relevant players here. I assume we've got Ougi on one side and Gaen on the other, but they're certainly not giving us too many hints.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is...there is a huge gap in the timeline. The time between Tsubasa Tiger and Nadeko Medusa, that's a two month time skip right there. It's apparent that something must have happened around that time to lead up to Gaen giving Araragi a talisman to make Shinobu a god. But we still know nothing about it.

> do we know when that Nadeko conversation was relative to Araragi's classroom conversation with Ougi?

Let's see...Araragi and Ougi conversation happened late December. Ougi and Nadeko happened Oct 31st. So those were about a month or so apart. Also I don't think we know why Ougi was looking for Mayoi either. If the Kuriyami works like it did with Shinobu (stopped chasing her once she lived/existed the way she was supposed to) then it'd be safe to say the Kuriyami (if it were to 'be' Ougi like lots of people might think) wouldn't have even been hunting for Mayoi.
>> ARTICLE
Hachikuji left on her own will, not by being eaten by the darkness. So Ougi could still be the darkness.
>> ARTICLE
I still think that's highly unlikely. I don't think she's the Kuriyami itself, but rather she's connected to it in some way by a common bond or something.
>> ARTICLE
Well, whatever it is, things seem to be pointing to the fact that she's not human.
>> ARTICLE
That's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
> And why did the town need a god in the first place?
I believe it was to calm all the kaii in the area, so that shit would stop happening.

Also, it seems that Araragi wasn't going through with the plan because Shinobu was still Shinobu. So maybe Ougi was just getting a replacement. And note how Gaen didn't want Kaiki to take the job. Perhaps she thinks that Nadeko is good enough...
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, Kaikis the actual hero of this story. And its great that we get the thirty minutes later before he declines

That whole scene felt like a lie or maybe just a flourish to play up his heroic being. "Oh yeah I totally turned down 3 million just to help this crying girl" sounds really good after the fact.

Speaking of acting the hero, I love how he sees Araragi as a sex offender out corrupting the youth.
>> ARTICLE
You don't see araragi that way?
>> ARTICLE
I really like the idea of a Gaen vs Ougi pseudo-battle using all the other characters as pawns in their own greater schemes. 

Lovely how Gaen is probably still just using Kaiki to solve this whole Nadeko issue by sending Ononoki as a messenger. As his senpai in college and being in the same club, she probably knew full well ("I know everything. There's nothing I don't know.") that her message would only spur on Kaiki and encourage him to continue. 

The cash incentive Gaen offered Kaiki was more than likely to help solve the financial issues of this task that he mentioned previously. 

And this is all while Kaiki feels that they are enemies. 

I love Monogatari. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that does seem pretty likely. It seems like the slant Kaiki gives to his own life/story is one of a sort of romantic super-spy deceiver, and I bet being able to frame this whole story as a grand deception of his senpai is just the sort of thing that would appeal to him.
>> ARTICLE

I agree completely. Either Gaen doesn't know everything and is full of shit, or she just played the player and Kaiki is twisting the story to make it look like he is doing everything out of spite. From what we've been given I think the latter is the correct answer.
>> ARTICLE
> We havent had a single Araragi-Senjougahara scene this season, have we?

Much to my dismay. However I am still waiting on when/if we will ever get to see what Araragi will look like in an arc from Senjougahara's perspective.

Honestly, one of the best things about this season is it's choice to change who is narrating each arc and the way it messes around with perspectives. At the moment, the way this was handled during Nadeko's arc impresses me the most, but Kaiki is slowly taking the cake!

>  Isin himself coming in and saying look, this isnt sexy. Youre all really weird. Stop doing that. You all know my thoughts on this series - it wouldnt surprise me if this were the creators just throwing up their hands and admitting the audience wont realize the character perspectives arent aligned with the show perspective unless someone comes along to directly tell the characters theyre acting like children

This is intriguing. Although my current thoughts are that Kaiki himself isn't the character that is the Isin self-insert, no, to me it almost seems like Kaiki is being set up as a character to completely destroy the audiences perception of these children, and to put their hyper-sexualisation (especially Araragi) of each other in the perspective of a jaded adult. Isin himself is definitely either acting as Gaen or Ougi. At-least that is the way I see it.
>> ARTICLE
> Araragi from Senjougahara's perspective

That seems like the holy grail at this point - Hanekawa sees him as debonair savior, but I doubt that's how Senjougahara sees him.

Although I'd *also* love to see how *Kaiki* sees him, actually. I doubt it's particularly flattering.

> Author perspective

I don't truly think Isin is directly correlated with any of these characters - Gaen seems to be holding the most "authorial position," in that she's literally scripting a lot of the events that are taking place, but that's still just one more position on the chessboard. But obviously Kaiki doesn't have to actually be Isin in order to work as his tool for illustrating the biased perspectives we've seen so far. In fact, Kaiki actually seems *more* harsh than Isin himself - stuff like Kaiki just finding the "peace peace" insufferable kinda seems like a jab at Isin's own sense of humor.
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki's monologues, specifically his internal, were amazing as usual. Senjougahara's [facial expressions](http://imgur.com/a/0Fe3v) that she had when reacting to whatever Kaiki said were really telling of her feelings and were actually implemented very well. [And then there was her crying at the end of the scene.](http://imgur.com/M4XCRIf) She is without a doubt my favorite character, and her chemistry, composed of reluctant decisions and constant jabs at each other, with Kaiki makes for a really interesting arc so far.
>> ARTICLE
I like how she is more average looking in Kaiki's eyes. From Araragi's perspective her eyes are a little higher up on her face and her jaw is a bit more angled. Araragi's perspective makes her look more like a model.
>> ARTICLE
> And then there was her crying at the end of the scene.

That voice... It cut straight through my heart.
>> ARTICLE
Good, but still miles away form Kato Emiri's Hachikuji.

Don't forget.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, I still remember what I felt back then. And I won't forget.
>> ARTICLE
One possibly very important part of the episode is that we know Gaen didn't predict the darkness. That's a very telling little tidbit.

I think we're having some sort of chess game between Ougi and Gaen right now. Think about it - Gaen was trying to set up Shinobu as a god and was thwarted (seemingly) by the darkness. Ougi is seemingly linked to the darkness and is largely responsible for setting up Nadeko as a god.

This could be really cool and I'm very interested to see how it plays out.

(Also Kaiki is the best.)
>> ARTICLE
I am also wondering if Gaen knew Kaiki would just take the money and betray her. Maybe it was a way to give Kaiki funds without hurting his pride?
>> ARTICLE
> was thwarted (seemingly) by the darkness.

Where are you getting that from? I thought that Gaen's plan to turn Shinobu into a god was thwarted by Nadeko becoming a god.
>> ARTICLE
And who set Nadeko's ascension in motion? None other than Ougi.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I'm not disputing that. I'm talking about the darkness, which people seem to be connecting to Ougi, and I didn't see that connection being made in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
The connection I see is mainly that with the darkness being there it stops any plan of setting shinobu up as a god (would just eat her like before). It isn't a direct connection, but it seems that way to me.
>> ARTICLE
That connection wasn't made in this episode, it is made in the post-credits scene at the end of episode 20.
>> ARTICLE
Araragi- *"Hey Ougi, What's this work you speak of?"*

Ougi- *"Normal Work. If i were to liken it to something, It's work as commonplace as the overwhelming darkness that comprises most of this world. I right wrongs and bring to an end that which must end. If i had to be specific, I would say my job involves punishing Liars."*


This Reeks of her being directly involved with all of this. It was indeed post credits at the end of episode 20. I caught it the first time around, but rewatching it makes it even more apparent.
>> ARTICLE
Or perhaps they both got Nadeko to be a god because Araragi wasn't doing it to Shinobu...
>> ARTICLE
If that's the case, then why Nadeko over Shinobu...perhaps going back to Shinobu's story about how the darkness originally consumed the inhabitants of the area?  Since Nadeko has it out for Araragi and everyone close to him (including Shinobu), perhaps Ougi has carried out her plans entirely as a corrective action for what happened in the past.
>> ARTICLE
I just lost it during the opening. I was laughing harder than I should have but it was so perfect. Also when Kaiki thought about the 3 million yen over and he jumped to "30 mins later" I again laughed so hard. Kaiki truly is the best girl :)

I loved the more sensitive side of Senjougahara shown also. (also the O Snap moment when Kaiki said "I would have made a reservation, if I was escorting a lady")
>> ARTICLE
Senjou is so not used to being around someone who can out-snark her
>> ARTICLE
HA, :) true enough. 
>> ARTICLE
Ha! I guessed right! Ougi is the one thing that Gaen cannot control. Ougi is outside of the "everything" that Gaen knows. Damn, this is now super interesting.

Also, that OP. Such a terrible song, but my god was it amazing. It fits perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
One of the best episodes so far, Hitagi's reaction to the assurance of Araragi's safety, Kaiki's tough decisions to not betray Hitagi, revelations of Gaen's relationship with Kaiki, and Sengoku being cheerful scaring me makes Kaiki one of the best characters in the show
>> ARTICLE
DKFJSKKFASDJK CLIFFHANGER

The main thing I'm curious from this episode is why Gaen doesn't want Kaiki to take on the job. There has to be some consequence that will probably pop up in the next few episodes.

Also, Ononoki in this episode made me lol.
>> ARTICLE
One thing is that Gaen may see Nadeko as a replacement for Shinobu being the god.
>> ARTICLE
Just speculation, but I'm assuming Gaen has something to do with the "darkness" from Shinobu Time. The "darkness" erases things that deviate from their intended plan, so possibly Gaen is trying to stop the "darkness" from destroying the whole town? 
 
 More specifically, based on the ending bit of Shinobu Time, trying to prevent Ougi from destroying the whole town?
>> ARTICLE
I mean, a simple explanation would be that Gaen doesn't want Kaiki to die because she loves him.

.....

LOLOLOL WAT
>> ARTICLE
I think there was a statement near the end about how Gaen and Kaiki are enemies or something similar. It makes sense that the two would be polar opposites, considering that Gaen "knows everything" and Kaiki is a deceiver.

Him, Oshino, and Kagenui were all in the same class, so that would make sense.

WHAT"S IN THE GOD DAMN CLOSET?
>> ARTICLE
Sex toys, its her porn stash.
>> ARTICLE
And... An Araragi made out of dry skin and a finger nail clippings
>> ARTICLE
So, basically, her sex toys and porn stash.
>> ARTICLE
I... I think I'm suffering /u/Bobduh Monogatari withdrawals..

EDIT: He's back! He's finally back! ~~About ti~~ I never doubted you for a minute my lord!
>> ARTICLE
I need help now. 
>> ARTICLE
Whoa man Gahara is going moe or something. She was really cute this episode.
>> ARTICLE
she looked as if she was falling for Kaiki. all the taunting and the helping can really make an impression on a high schooler.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously. All them faces. I haven't seen that much reaction from her since ~~her girlfriend's~~ Tsubasa Tiger arc.
>> ARTICLE
then again.. it's Kaiki's tale so i don't put much credit into what we see [](/mad)
>> ARTICLE
I didn't know about the comment faces until now... You've changed my life. [](/cry)
>> ARTICLE
Considering we've had Nadeko as a narrator, I'm giving pretty much everyone else much more credit. Kaiki is liar but no where near as unreliable as Nadeko, so I have a reasonable amount of trust in him.
>> ARTICLE
That OP also hints at a connection with those two. 
>> ARTICLE
For me personally this was the best episode of the entire series so far. Kaiki seemed like such a throw away character, and I was very surprised to see that they were actually going to bother focusing on him, but he is a very interesting character when you give him a second glance! 

As everyone already said the exchange between these two was incredible, but not only that, Kaiki's insight towards Nadeko (another character who I thought felt throw away on the first introduction but grew on me in these latest episodes) was fascinating for me to watch. 

I've always appreciated this show but have never felt overly enthusiastic about it, but these last two arcs have really stuck with me, i'm very interested to see where this goes!

Isn't it funny how taking something from someone can be a sign of affection or gratitude? This one book I read [The Honest Truth About Dishonesty](http://www.amazon.ca/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone-Especially/dp/0062183613) even went into how when you accept something from someone it can actually lead them to trust in you more, that taking something from someone when offered (because if I remember right he would offer her drinks) leads them to think of you as a good person, that a bond is now formed. And clearly the writer of this series was brilliant enough to pick up on this little quirk. 

It's the nuances in this series that always keep me with it. 
>> ARTICLE
What did he find?

Also, Kaiki is easily the best character in this series.
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki is best girl, and I'm thinking maybe he found a body, because anything that can make Kaiki react like that must be pretty shocking
>> ARTICLE
3 million  = 30,000 $.

Not bad.

It costs $300,000 dollars to make Kaiki take the deal, for twelve seconds.

Nadeko da yo! 

Never gets old.

FTFY

Ononoki never fails to amuse me, I hope we get more character interaction between her and Kaiki as it feels like it could be developed more

Amazing new OP (never thought I'd actually hear Kaiki sing) but damn, [nightmare fuel](http://imgur.com/kHfP1gN)

Damn.... That's some crazy shit

OH CHRIST! How did i manage to not see that the first time around?

We waited so long to find out what was in that closet only to be left on a cliffhanger. God damnit.
>> ARTICLE
Whats in the closet? My money is on snake heads or dead snakes, you know the ones that she was supposed to make up for in her arc.
>> ARTICLE
Snake heads/dead snakes was my first thought too. Like everyone else said the ararararagi shrine is just TOO obvious, and definitely wouldn't have surprised Kaiki.
>> ARTICLE
That went by too fast, I jumped out of my seat when the ED started
>> ARTICLE
I think the biggest reveal of this whole episode was actually that Gaen planned for Shinobu to become a god, but the plan was interfered with.  It does kind of make sense, why else would Oshino have asked Araragi to keep hold of such a powerful thing at his house.  We also already know that the person who interfered with the plan was Ougi, and that Ougi is either somehow in control of the blackness or IS the blackness (was that what it was called?  I forget).  

Which means, i guess, that dealing with Ougi might be the mission Gaen has for Araragi, and why he was feeding her information at the end of the last arc.  Even if it wasn't, clearly the big conflict right now is some kind of chess match between Gaen and Ougi.
>> ARTICLE
>I think the biggest reveal of this whole episode was actually that Gaen planned for Shinobu to become a god, but the plan was interfered with. It does kind of make sense, why else would Oshino have asked Araragi to keep hold of such a powerful thing at his house.

Agreed. This also gives context to the Mayoi Jiang Shi arc, because that arc has Shinobu become nearly a god but in the wrong way.

>Which means, i guess, that dealing with Ougi might be the mission Gaen has for Araragi, and why he was feeding her information at the end of the last arc. Even if it wasn't, clearly the big conflict right now is some kind of chess match between Gaen and Ougi.

I have a feeling that this will be the plot of Hanamonogatari(if an LN reader reads this, piss off, I don't want any hints) considering how we know that Kanbaru will be involved in some way. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Kanbaru is definitely important to all of this in some kinda way, besides just that Gaen is a relative of hers.
>> ARTICLE
those Senjou tears...goddamn that was intense. This is my favorite *monogatari arc by far 
>> ARTICLE
The mention on spoilers was so meta. I found it incredibly amusing. :P
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm anybody notice how when Kaiki asked if gahara would take her bag with her if she left her seat in any given situation she responded that not even she would do something as rude as that? Yet when she left to go to the bathroom later in the episode you can see her bringing her bag with her. I wonder what this is trying to convey? 

Granted, she did say that she would at least take it in the presence of Kaiki, but I do feel like that answer was simply her usual tact.
>> ARTICLE
It has to do with trust and accepting Kaiki as a friend/acquaintance which was kind of the theme.

Starts off with the school girl uniform, so it would be business like and a non acquaintance meeting. 


Gahara rejects the offering of him treating her because it would end up in her accepting him as a friend, acquaintance, or good person.


Leaving her bag there means two things, she trusts Kaiki and that he is a friend. So she took it with her.  


The whole meeting she wanted it to be strictly business-like but in the end, in their own ways(Kaiki going against Gaen, and Gahara crying/saying thank you) they end up accepting each other. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't believe this had much relevance, as she hadn't removed her bag throughout the whole encounter. It's not like she had to pick it up to take it with her, she just got up and left and the bag happened to leave with her. I like to imagine if she would have taken it off than she would have left it. But in this case she didn't want to break down crying in his presence and just quickly got up.
>> ARTICLE
One thing that I'd like to ask is if Kaiki's encounter with Gahara played out the way both of them say it did when they first met. Specifically, did Kaiki actually try to sexually assault Gahara. I'm fine with any kind of spoilers if need be. 
>> ARTICLE
I love, love, love that someone is finally able to put Senjougahara in her place. That shot at her not being a lady and all the other things. 

Granted she has to take it since she's under his will right now but it's so satisifying to see a character who's so sure of herself get taken down a peg.
>> ARTICLE
It's the change in perspective. In Bake and Nise, we were looking at Gahara through Koyomi's eyes. To Kaiki, she's just a high school girl.
>> ARTICLE
Either way, seeing her like that is refreshing. I am biased since I've never liked her anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Man, kaiki is taking over the show. I can't stop listening to the OP. Does anybody know vaguely what they are saying in the OP's lyrics?
>> ARTICLE
>My memories are still beautiful despite a sheet of frozen tears,    
and I don't remember why I shed them     
Now the winter winds of yesteryear

A misunderstanding, a moment's hesitation    
Cliched sentimentalism    
The perfect moment, lost forever

Never again    
I remain young

the warmth of your skin    


That's what I saw on the version I watched.
>> ARTICLE
Is this the first OP they've had in awhile?
>> ARTICLE
They didn't have an OP for Shinobu's arc, because her voice actress, [Maaya Sakamoto doesn't do character songs](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1p9j79/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cd04mw9). However, the arc before that, Nadeko's one, had an OP song.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the info!
>> ARTICLE
Congratulations Kaiki, you did what Araragi could not: Make Senjougahara show her cute side. Maybe the thing about you being her "ex" might have some element of truth in it after all, hmm......

Epic retro OP is epic. Brings back all those memories of those animes I've watched in that period.
>> ARTICLE
I LOVED the music choice at the end. The choice to use it is one of the subtly amazing things that makes this series stand out. (Track is Yokuchou from Bakemonogatari's OST, Disc 2, Track 35). 

It's the piano piece that references two themes: Hanekawa and Senjougahara. It's also the piece that plays at the last episode of Bakemonogatari, signifying resolution.

It represents Koyomi hoping that if any survivor were to show up, it would be Senjougahara, the girl he loves, or Hanekawa, the girl he can rely on. It also represents a false hope to us, the viewers, in that we are also hoping to find survivors (resolution). 

This show.
>> ARTICLE
A little late here, but I noticed the same thing! I love Stable Staple so it was awesome to hear the piano echoing that. I really did think Senjougahara would show up. (Didn't catch Hanekawa's theme as I'm not so familiar with that song.)
>> ARTICLE
Do you have a link to the sound track? Can't seem to find it.

[This is a bit late, but here](http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Yokuchou/5afnmq?src=5)

No youtube found though.
>> ARTICLE
Not that guy, but thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Or it's because the track plays whenever Araragi feels strong feelings towards someone. Maybe his bonding with Shinobu passed certain threshold and she is now on the same level as Hitagi or Hanekawa. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say the song definitely related to specifically Senjougahara and Hanekawa since it has sections where the chords are directly from the Opening songs for their respective arcs.
>> ARTICLE
Comments like this one are the reason I read discussion threads on reddit. So much awesome insight!

"Marty! We have to go back in time to run over a small girl!"

Holy shit things escalated quickly.

Also I love that interaction between Araragi and Shinobu in the beginning:

Shinobu: This happened because you decided to save that girl.

Araragi: This happened because you decided to make that time rift.

ive only watched the anime and OVA's and read a little of whats happening in the novels. i wish i had more time to read light novels of CODE GEASS and CHROME SHELLED REGIOS. two of my favorite anime i just finished. as you can tell im coming from like 2008,2009 to the present

I've never touched code geass, I heard it's sort of formulaic with a typical byronic protagonist so I've never been all that interested in it.

not at all, i went in thinking it was a high school drama then i realised its about a young man redemption story who uses power and his mind to win battles. give it the three ep rule and see if you like it. i promise you'll be interested

It didn't help, I only want it more now.

fingers crossed for a non-loli version of hachikuji showing up and araragi just going bonkers

I think it will be that or Oshino.  I'd be happy with either.

i'm betting on Hachikuji because if they're thinking of going back in time to fix everything it'll be to her detriment alone so they'll seek her consent before undoing saving her life. if you've seen Steins;gate you know exactly what's going on.

Shinobu, so much feels for Araragi :'(

Wow Shinobu that that other you may have overreacted a little
>> ARTICLE
Zombies everywhere! 

and also Shinobu and Araragi time
>> ARTICLE
Shinobu and Araragi time is the best time in my opinion. Has been ever since that first bathtub conversation.
>> ARTICLE
This whole season is turning out so great, and Monogatari is no different from that. Seriously, I love the dynamic between Shinobu and Araaragi
>> ARTICLE
I like that they're finally clarifying exactly how Shinobu feels about Koyomi.  If anyone else here ever watched the Sarah Connor Chronicles, their relationship dynamic seems to me like it's somewhat similar to how John and Cameron were.  Shinobu is clearly very dangerous, but she cares enough about Koyomi that she doesn't want to revert to her true nature, because then she might hurt him.  I wouldn't call her feelings *romantic*, but they're more than friendship and not exactly familial in nature either. I think Shinobu likes who she is now, and to some extent Koyomi is her anchor, preventing get from reverting back to what she was (and it's clear now what the consequences of that could be). 

Awesome episode, great character development for Shinobu.  I'm really looking forward to seeing where this goes. 
>> ARTICLE
I do wonder if the old shinobu here killed the world because she was free and felt like doing it or because araragi was killed 
>> ARTICLE
It seemed to me that she felt like Koyomi was less attached to her than she was to him, and that frustrated her. 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm who knows
>> ARTICLE
> I wouldn't call her feelings romantic, but they're more than friendship and not exactly familial in nature either.

This is actually a topic that was swiftly discussed (and swiftly dismissed for a later time) between Araragi and Shinobu that featured in the Light Novel, but was cut out of the anime. It's interesting how you captured the nature of their relationship accurately just from what was given from the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Kudos to Shaft for managing to convey that in their adaptation without saying it explicitly.
>> ARTICLE
The transition from that bleak start of the episode to that OP was pretty jarring. I can't help but think of Kyubey when I see Mayoi's backpack during the OP.

I was thinking the zombies this episode were very reminiscent of a certain other enemy presence from another of Shaft's works. *you know the one*

Also, at the end, I was half expecting Gahara-sama to show up, because of the music playing. Imagine her surviving alone, in a world filled with zombies, would make a better movie than *I Am Legend*.

My other theory is maybe that Tsukihi survived, but that is unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
> My other theory is maybe that Tsukihi survived, but that is unlikely.

That's what I thought as well, because there was a [brief flash](http://imgur.com/ktFUlM1) of someone who looks like Tsukihi, while Araragi was talking about the possibility of someone having survived.

That and I'd just love to see more Tsukihi... :3
>> ARTICLE
That was actually Shinobu.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I guess I was just hoping it to be Tsukihi so much that my mind didn't want her to be anyone else :)
>> ARTICLE
I thought it could be Tsukihi for a different reason, she could be immune to zombification because of her regenerative capabilities of the Phoenix. 
>> ARTICLE
I had similar thoughts: I thought that perhaps oddities are immune to zombiefication (Tsukihi was never "cured" in any way, so she's not a former oddity, like Karen and Senjougahara for example). But I guess that would include Hanegawa as well?

Then I realized that Shinobu in her full strength probably doesn't give a fuck whether someone is a human, former-oddity or oddity (or something else) :P
>> ARTICLE
If you look at Shinobu in the firework scene she's wearing that same pink yukata.
>> ARTICLE
not only did they look like [ ](/s "majuu") but they resembled [](/s "the antispiral") as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I noticed the theme as well, pretty curious that they would use it, then not have her show up. 
>> ARTICLE
I want nothing more than for Senjougahara to have survived.
But it was just tonnes of zombies right? They were reflected in Koyomi's eye.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I only was thinking this because of the music playing when they were lighting the fireworks.
>> ARTICLE
That music piece also references Hanekawa's music too. I wrote it in [another comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1lgx5g/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cbzebx2), but I feel as though they choice this music for many reasons, including making us hope that survivors such as Higati show up. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually happy I wasn't able to read this part in the LNs. Araragi and Shinobu ending up in a "zombie" apocalypse setting and deciding to just live it out is a twist I never would have seen coming. 

Though as important as Hachikuji was in Araragi's history, wouldn't Shinobu still have come out of Araragi's shadow to take out the cat? 
>> ARTICLE
yeah that was pretty weird apparently, when he went to the doughnut shop she slipped into his shadow and that was him "finding" her so that she could save him later. I'm not sure about that I might have to re-watch that episode.
>> ARTICLE
I completely didn't notice that, I'm going to have to go back and see, because I never knew how, when or why she got into his shadow.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing he didn't find her so she didn't get a chance to slip into his shadow. Also there was probably more of an emotional distance between the two. Hachikuji was the only non-aggressive Oddity who Araragi met, so the meeting must have helped change his perception of Oddities thus bridging the gap between him and Shinobu. Without Hachikuji it might have taken longer for Shinobu and Araragi to make peace.
>> ARTICLE
Well *Im* certainly ready to see this kick into high gear. This arc hasnt been as tedious for me as the *first* Mayoi one (which is still easily my least favorite part of the series overall), but personally Isins comedy is kinda hit-or-miss for me, and not really what Im here for. So Id say an apocalypse or something is definitely in order.

**Episode 9**

0:02 - [Nice establishing shot](http://i.imgur.com/aESFehs.jpg)

0:18 - [Sweet, they werent kidding.](http://i.imgur.com/bGDwNOj.jpg) This is a lovely series of shots, too. This one in particular is very interesting - all these shots possess much more detail than Monogataris usual highly stylized and flat aesthetic, and here we see the telephone poles usual appearance (a solid block of color, usually white) shift into more color as they reach the point where the corruption/natural overgrowth has reached them. Like the normal aesthetic is representative of the clinical, controlled environment these characters normally live within, and destroying that world also destroys that aesthetic

0:24 - [God damn thats nice](http://i.imgur.com/EtEf7Xu.jpg)

0:40 - Theres one for the inappropriate OP transitions highlight reel

2:17 - [Another beautiful composition.](http://i.imgur.com/wxO21Yn.jpg) Love the use of shadow here - those ominous power lines reflected in black

2:27 - [Back to the flat colors.](http://i.imgur.com/bu6IQEw.jpg) Araragis house has escaped the destruction

3:01 - [More great shadows.](http://i.imgur.com/a7XwVIh.jpg) Really enhances the ghost town feel

3:39 - [Shinbo gets to have so much fun with composition.](http://i.imgur.com/EGKGsP4.jpg) I get that not every show would be appropriate for such a stylized approach, but I wouldnt mind seeing a lot more of it

5:30 - So Shinobus obviously got some kinda secret. Good to know!

6:16 - [Seems trustworthy](http://i.imgur.com/J8jaJsn.jpg)

6:39 - [They keep changing the color palette of this place](http://i.imgur.com/rqVEKFA.jpg)

6:55 - [Ermahgerd this shows design.](http://i.imgur.com/jMtGi5w.jpg) They are really going all-out today. Its like the characters, the talisman, and the background have all been pulled from disparate worlds

7:25 - [They are making it very hard for me to get through this episode](http://i.imgur.com/NaV9awE.jpg)

7:47 - [God, look at it.](http://i.imgur.com/4HIOwkt.jpg) I love the consistency of the color trick - not only does the overall image fade from green to red, but you can see the individual trees in the distance do the same. It might be stylized, but its like the colors themselves are the ecosystem

8:02 - [The green has spread significantly](http://i.imgur.com/NbQXlG8.jpg) since they entered. Not yet sure what to make of that

9:09 - [Well this is different.](http://i.imgur.com/i2vPo4V.jpg) Their shifting, cut-paper texture kinda reminds me of Madoka

10:09 - [Today is a good day](http://i.imgur.com/wk3GbJ1.jpg)

10:47 - [And to think I was complaining about this arc.](http://i.imgur.com/zr07Q7p.jpg) This episodes an embarrassment of riches

11:39 - [Well I can see why she had trouble telling him.](http://i.imgur.com/N93Vqw6.jpg) Wonder where theyre going with this

12:26 - [Me that isnt myself.](http://i.imgur.com/aB5GFfr.jpg) Pointing to some common Isin topics here. Links easily enough with fate, but theres not yet enough pieces to tie it into the red light/green light stuff

13:32 - [Jeez, thats a morbid way to reference that](http://i.imgur.com/uKTQXmG.jpg)

14:39 - [I like that this is more of a Shinobu arc than a Mayoi arc](http://i.imgur.com/Wo8HpFr.jpg). Shinobu secretly being a possibly unbalanced world-shaking power is something the show generally breezes over, and keeping it relevant makes the Araragi-Shinobu relationship more interesting

17:08 - [An interesting play on true self.](http://i.imgur.com/jF8Pv74.jpg) Shinobu isnt actually reformed, this is just a new version of her self, and that other self still exists

19:50 - Hanekawa reforms by embracing the various interpretations of her self. [Shinobu reforms by denying hers](http://i.imgur.com/buTlJrB.jpg)

20:45 - I like pretty much every shot of this episode, but [heres another particularly nice one](http://i.imgur.com/j3NOjBS.jpg)

21:23 - [Hes even at the playground?](http://i.imgur.com/9ferJnp.jpg) Jeez, I wonder who theyre gonna run into

**And Done**

What a great episode! Goddamn. Excitement about this season = renewed. Beautiful shots throughout, digging at some interesting stuff about Shinobus character, and who doesnt love a good zombie apocalypse, particularly in Monogataris fantastic style? Still not sure of everything this arc is really about (though Shinobus little you cant always be pessimistic and wait for things to happen speech at the end seems suspiciously relevant), but as long as the ride is this beautiful and exciting, Ill remain happy to find out.

-old posts are [here](http://wrongeverytime.com/)-

>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised that the change happened that late in the timeline.  I could've sworn an extra Hachikuji floating around would cause significant changes way earlier than that.  I guess that might be the whole "oddities existing outside fate" thing, so anything she could do as a normal person wouldn't change the plot like an oddity could?

I'm hoping for adult Hachikuji too, since we've been getting age-shifted versions of a bunch of other characters.  She'll probably be the only one who can remove that block at the shrine, and have to make a "save yourself" sort of choice.
>> ARTICLE
That late? It happened at the end of Bake. I don't think it was that late in the timeline.

What do you mean an extra Hachikuji? They're in timeline B now, so the original dead Hachikuji doesn't exist in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
I was figuring more that, while growing up, timeline B's Hachikuji, who didn't exist in the original timeline, would create enough changes to subtly alter things for eleven years before Bake even happened.  As such, compared to eleven years ago, Bake is late in the timeline.  I refer to her as an extra Hachikuji because she's alive and kicking and influencing events instead of being dead and only showing up to mislead people every so often.
>> ARTICLE
Bake is the 3rd thing to happen in the timeline. I don't think it makes sense for Hachikuji to influence events outside of the timeline or from before Bake really...
>> ARTICLE
None of the ones we've seen, sure, but she could easily have influenced the tides of certain friendships and relationships as she grew up.  A group of four childhood friends is radically different from a group of three, and so on.

I also figured she could have encountered Shinobu instead of Araragi to create this title, but that was apparently wrong.
>> ARTICLE
there's no reason for any of the character to know Hachikuji in the new timeline at all. 

There's no indication she'd even go to the same school or even live in the same area since she took a train into town to find her mother.

I wasn't the one making the argument here. Since you weren't directly refuting the obvious basis for Exotria's claims, I assumed you didn't understand what he was arguing. It seems silly and a waste of time for someone to only tangentially touch on the basis of someone's argument instead of arguing directly against it and explaining why that basis is misguided. 

Although I think the chances of her coming into contact with any of the characters is increased at least a little since it seems like she might be of a similar age to all of them.

gibberish and ironic considering the source.

She might have ended up living with her mother in this timeline, after the visit.  Loads of ways it could go.
>> ARTICLE
possible, but unlikely. also it's implied heavily that the mother gave up the child, so unlikely hachikuji ended up there.

and even if the unlikely event of ending p with her mother, even more unlikely she'd be friends with araragi. hachikuji would be in a different grade and more to the point, had already graduated by the time we're even introduced to arargi. she'd be in a university.

You are clearly underestimating Araragi's power over the universe to expand his harem despite the odds.  He's overdue for a college girl.

No i just read the translated light novels. 

Actually, of all the fetishes on display, it's weird there's no mitsagi-type character... 

although i guess going further in this conversation would ruin the end of this arc.

When did this become the Shinobu arc?
>> ARTICLE
all arcs should have some [Shinobu](http://i.imgur.com/HNZYM.gif). they overspilled a bit on this one i suppose
>> ARTICLE
I'm not complaining
>> ARTICLE
While I do like shinobu WHERE THE FUCK IS MUH HACHIKUJI. HOLY FUCK I NEED SOME SNAIL ACTION UP IN HERE.
>> ARTICLE
The interactions between characters and the way this affects their relationships with each other in this show are all very well thought out, particularly between Shinobu and Araragi.

So far the biggest thing I'm taking away from this arc is the way it showcases the codependency of Kiss-shot and Araragi, and I'm not just talking about the fact they are mutually incomplete and they can only be restored when either of them dies.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if Araragi knows about Shinobus feels for him, I mean by now he got enough hints.
>> ARTICLE
you need to rewatch the Nise BD version of their bath scene. they're stuck together and they both know it!
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand. Didn't Shinobu say some episodes ago, that if she were more powerful, she could time travel? So why exactly isn't it possible for Araragi to drink her blood, so she becomes more powerful and then just jump back in time and change everything again?
>> ARTICLE
don't bother thinking too hard on the timetravel aspect.. it's not the point the show's making. Araragi's dialogue with Shinobu was merely meant to show her recklessness, pride and their relationship, not disect the actual method they used.
>> ARTICLE
As they just demonstrated, full-power Shinobu fucks shit up and is worth avoiding as a potential consequence.
>> ARTICLE
I am so confused with this series.  I have an impossible time keeping track of the seasons and shows

When did this show start?  This is different than the one that was on I guess before this in which the main guy never showed up?  That one ended with a vampire battle?  So this is new?
>> ARTICLE
 . . . wut?? Its the newest episode in the series . . . .

just Google it
>> ARTICLE
The show started like last month I think. 9 weeks ago.

Dude I think you're way behind. After Bakemonogatari it's Nisemonogatari. After that it's a prequel called Nekomonogatari:Kuro. Then this came out. Everything happening this season takes place after Nisemonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
Wait no I am confused more again.

The last I watched was the 4 episodes about Black Hanakawa and it ended with her living with Aragai's sisters because her house burned down.
>> ARTICLE
This 2nd season will include five of the eight published books (so far) after Nisemonogatari, with Hanamonogatari released as a separate tv series next year.  Also, Tsukimonogatari and Koyomimonogatari , the two latest book published in the series, will not be included.

For all books in the series, see this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Monogatari_novels#cite_note-16.  This 2nd season animation will stop at Koimonogatari.
>> ARTICLE
Okay then you were on episode 4 of this season. 
>> ARTICLE
oh.

I guess for some reason I thought it was a 4 episode show and stopped looking for new stuff.

Okay thanks yall.
>> ARTICLE
Nekomonogatari Kuro was four episodes and released last New Years. The four episodes you watched were a part of Nekomonogatari Shiro which is 6 episodes in total.
>> ARTICLE
That's weird. This season is gonna be 24-26 episodes long.
>> ARTICLE
This arc "Mayoi Jiangshi" occurs from right before and a bit into the last arc "Neko (Shiro)" (the one were Araragi isn't around). The next few arcs are a bit scattered around the time line and certain things happen in different arcs simultaneously.

Close Overall timeline:

Kizu(not aired)<Neko(black)<Bakemonogatari<Nisemonogatari<Mayoi Jiangshi=<Neko(white)<Nadeko Medusa<Hitagi End. 

Later, "Shinobu Time" pops in and out of the timeline
>> ARTICLE
Since it's (seemingly) an alternate history, aren't the actual dates irrelevant? It seems that stuff will get reset at the end of this arc, but I'm not too sure...
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to qualify my statement first by saying I'm a LN reader but I have no idea what is going to happen in this arc. They have to come back to the regular timeline at some point, I mean we already know he show's up to save Hanekawa which is in the future from this arc so things that occur out of that timeline may be a few days into Tsubasa Tiger.
>> ARTICLE
Shinobu Time and Neko White happen at the same time. Mayoi Jiangshi happens before Neko White.
>> ARTICLE
On the LN timeline it says that Mayoi Jiangshi spills just a little bit into Tsubasa Tiger. 

If you want the timeline I use I'll post it but it is so full of spoilers that I end up having to cover the center with my hand so I can read the dates and see which arc occurs when without seeing the major events of the story.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know the timeline well. I think it's better to say that Mayoi Jiangshi happens before Tsubasa Tiger because a majority of it does happen before it. 
>> ARTICLE
That makes good sense, and I agree it is easier to just say it happens before Tsubasa Tiger.
>> ARTICLE
I think Shinobu has the same weak spot as Togame. On the collarbone.
>> ARTICLE
i love shinobu, shes so cute and im glad i watched that OVA where i can see her in her adult form, i dont like lolis that much. this was a awesome EP. they have a great connection with each other and i remember one of the earlier ep(not this series) where shinobu said that no matter what we will end up together forever till one of us dies. DEM FEELS :(
>> ARTICLE
Since when could Shinobu fly? Iremember in the last arc Black Hanekawa had to carry Shinobu to the School Ruins because Shinobu couldn't fly. But now she can with no explanation. Or maybe there was an explnation and I just wasn't paying attention.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Would it be accurate for us to call Shinobu's original Heart-Under-Blade? That's what she was after all.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that would be more accurate, actually.
>> ARTICLE


[](/s "Black Hanekawa was killed by Shinobu, who resumed the form of Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.  Basically Shinobu fell into despair because of the death of Araragi.  She first destroyed the world, and then attempted suicide, but wasn't successful.  The botched suicide attempt ruined her mind, and her minions became mindless zombies.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah.
>> ARTICLE
If your spoilers are correct, [](/s "(which i'm sure they are) then this will be the first time we see Kissshot in something other than the Kizu PV and that 3 second clip from the last episode." ) 
>> ARTICLE
I vaguely remember Shinobu was disappointed in Araragi in Tsubasa Cat because he kept associating with other apparitions one after the other. It was first mentioned when Nadeko was wondering why Shinobu was glaring so intently at her when she went to Oshino's place. In other words, Shinobu is jealous.
>> ARTICLE
That was one of the more boring episodes, which is weird because you'd think a post-apocalyptic world would be entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
How so?
>> ARTICLE
Literally nothing happened, they walked around for a little bit talked about things we already knew. The dialogue wasn't particularly interesting like it usually is. The 'cliffhanger' was pretty underwhelming too.
>> ARTICLE
Really? So you knew that the world was overwhelmed by zombies before this episode? And you knew that Shinobu had caused this apocalypse before watching this episode? And you knew how important the day of her disappearance was to Shinobu before you saw this episode? 
>> ARTICLE
For some reason, a lot of people consider dialogue to not be "something happening". It's a personal pet peeve and really turns me off taking people seriously. There's a whole breadth of story telling that can take place entirely within constrained locations with minimal characters and nothing but dialogue (classic example: 12 Angry Men). 

The point is to have meaningful interactions and reveal things to each other and the audience. "Changes" (in other words "stuff happening") in this kind of story telling tends to be internal to the characters rather than to an external situation.

People might well find that kind of story telling boring, but to say "nothing happens" is just lazy as fuck and indicates they know full well that they can't actually articulate any solid reasoning for why they don't like it beyond the fact they don't like it.

And to be honest, if someone doesn't like that kind of story telling, I don't know why the fuck they would be watching Monogatari since that's pretty much almost entirely what it's built on.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like you're just describing the reason why people just don't like the monogatari series in general.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is my favorite series of all time. I'm sorry I expressed my disinterest for 1 episode, it clearly offended you.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not offended, but ok
>> ARTICLE
I personally found it really interesting and the atmosphere was really beautiful. I haven't been disappointed in a single episode in this season yet.

I can accept your sentiment, but honestly, you cannot expect your comment to fare well if you're only going to describe it as 'boring' when most people here clearly feel otherwise. If you are going to make a comment that will go against the majority, you'd better explain your reasons well. Also, prepare yourself for a potential debate.

If you have no intention to do that, the wisest move is to keep quiet and ignore it.

Merely saying "this is boring, my opinion", is not going to help.

edit: typo...
>> ARTICLE
If you notice I did explain why in a reply.
>> ARTICLE
And there were counter statements too, which you failed to address. I didn't want to participate in it so I never directly addressed your points. But frankly, they aren't convincing and they sound a little whiny.

I was just giving you a general advice. Expressing a different opinion on reddit is a pain, and it's easy to lose calm if you aren't prepared for it. The same is true in real life too though. Making blunt statements about something with weak and excessively subjective points is bound to attract hate.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that I am getting my OPINION called weak and excessively subjective just highlights how toxic the monogatari fanbase is. Its a common theme I see when ever this show is mentioned poorly in this subreddit. 

I didn't find the episode entertaining, most of the dialogue was boring or meant nothing. People are assuming I am trolling or whatever when in fact I love this show. I guess ill have to write a written apology to NisiOisin for forgiveness.
>> ARTICLE
No, calm down. I never assumed you were trolling or anything. I understand exactly what you're trying to say and what you mean by you not liking just one episode.

But the way you present your opinions matter. I guess I'm not necessarily targeting you personally. Your comment just happened to be the one I decided to pick on. I've just seen so many threads where there happen to be a few stray comments that give a different opinion downvoted. Sometimes, people don't realise that it's not their opinions that are attracting the hate, but the way they worded the matter.

I never downvote opinions though, so don't worry. But I just wanted to perhaps explain what's going on. Too often I've seen threads or comments complaining about the circlejerk or the fanboys, but I rarely ever observe a situation where I don't understand why someone is heavily downvoted, even though they are sometimes undeserved.

Forgive me for ranting out on you.
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki absolutely owns this show and I love it. 
>> ARTICLE
"Really. I've never told a lie." I honestly said so. - Never change Kaiki
>> ARTICLE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB8TCRUd9rA
>> ARTICLE
I really love these subtle little changes in how the world's perceived through Kaiki's perspective.  In Araragi's world parents hardly even exist, and while Hanekawa's parents certainly exist to her they're just sort of "Mother" and "Father", they lack any sense of personality or agency.  And while Nadeko's sort of resentful at the world's expectations of her she never really contextualizes that into being rebellious against her parents specifically for how they're raising her.  Indeed, it seems interesting in hindsight how little she mentioned her parents at all, considering what we find out about them this episode.

Anyway, now that we're seeing things through Kaiki's grownup perspective, there's suddenly parents everywhere in our narrative:  Hitagi's dad is meeting Araragi's folks, while Kaiki poses as a parent to go talk to Nadeko's mom and dad.  In previous arcs our teenage cast has pretty much always described themselves as basically independent little mini-adults - as teenagers tend to do.  When Nadeko turned into a god for instance nobody spared a thought for, "Hey, what're her parents going to think, they basically just lost their daughter!?"

Kaiki as an adult is aware of how young most of our cast is, and now in this arc there's little hints of that teenage immaturity all over the place.  Gahara gets self-conscious talking about Araragi, and seems a bit awkward about what sounds like their parents getting along famously.  And while Nadeko's certainly *menacing* it's a purely *childlike* menace, lacking any empathy or self-reflection.  She doesn't want to kill Araragi because she's angry at him as a person, but because it'll be a nice storybook romance for her to love a dead person and he just happens to be it.  That childishness makes her more dangerous, not less, but it also makes her rather pitifully small.  

When Kaiki meets Nadeko's parents, there's a real sense of condemnation there.  They care more about maintaining their image of Cute Nadeko than actually finding a clue to the location of their daughter, so they refuse to investigate the only part of her life that she tried to keep private.  Kaiki observes that her all-pink room looks more like her parents designed it than it being what Nadeko actually wanted, and also notes that even though she acts happy in her photobook she's alone in every single picture (an observation he makes to her parents and they don't seem to understand).  Her father notes that she "never rebelled against me" even once, an awfully autocratic turn of phrase to tell someone what a nice girl your daughter was.

That whole scene with her parents explains really nicely why in in her own arc Nadeko simultaneously resented the "cute" label, yet didn't really have any hidden deeper personality beyond that, either.  It's not just that she started acting this way because she wanted to be pleasing to others, but that her parents very much instilled the expectation of acting like that into her, and then apparently completely ignored anything except what they wanted her to be.  In earlier arcs Nadeko was just crazy, but in Kaiki's perspective it's her parents who *made* her crazy.

I think that's really why Kaiki's our main character this arc, because that condemnation can only come from someone who sees the parent-child relationship from the perspective of the parent, and the rest of our cast are all still very much on the child side of things still.
>> ARTICLE
I think that is rather fitting to have an arc that shows us more than a glimpse of how the world of the Monogatari series looks through an adults eyes just before the graduation.  
>> ARTICLE
I would also like to add that in Nadekos room... the closet is YELLOW.... while the rest of her room is PINK (Or in different shades)...  The symbolism is that the PINK represents her faked purity (cute, obeying, non rebelious) while that YELLOW color (the closet) represents the TRUE Nadeko... the DARKNESS that resides within her. Which would also why the mom said that they would like it if Kaiki didn't open the door. They are much rather satisfied with the fake Nadeko that they seem to shape (during the shrine scene Kaiki mentions that she is spoiled and that she (nadeko) let herself be spoiled)...  than having her TRUE COLORS (YELLOW) be shone. I guessing if they would have opened the door there would have been something crucial to help Kaiki gain a better understanding of the situation (with respect to time, as he still has not met her until towards the end of the episode). 

He maybe be a doucher (since he is ultimately the cause for all that is currently happening) BUT he is in a way making up for his wrong doings... I hope the con man can reclaim himself. Nonetheless, this arc will be interesting to watch.

Yellow... sickness?  Or cowardice - the things she hides?

Unless if we can see Kaiki singing.
>> ARTICLE
This is a little late... but well done on the whole seeing-into-the-future thing.
>> ARTICLE
I'd imagine Nadeko's closet is actually some shrine dedicated to Araragi; like some kind of creepy fangirl. Either that or she has things in there that are "out of character" such as non-cute clothing or creepy images or whatnot. 

Kaiki once again steals the show. I thought it was hilarious when Nadeko was telling him how Araragi was happy/excited when she was basically naked, and Kaiki was like, "Wtf? Is he a pedo? A criminal?". Yes, Kaiki, he is. 

Also during the conversation I had a feeling that he sort of understood the unrequited feeling Nadeko was feeling. I haven't read the LN's, but I'm guessing [potential Hanamonogatari spoiler speculation](/s "His love for Kanbaru's mom was unrequited"). 

I can't wait for next week to see what plan he cooks up.

what if her weakness is in the closet

Regarding Kaiki's feelings and motivation for helping, this text is quickly flashed on the screen after Nadeko's statements about unrequited love.

I just want to point out how amazing Kaiki is as a character and his voice actor does a really damn good job of making him who he is. His conversation with Senjougahara are also great. Almost like a big brother/father type of interaction. I don't know if I am suppose to take them serious but they come across as very comical.

Kaiki's unfazed reactions when talking to Nadeko - Priceless! Like an adult listening to a child's first world problem.

I was totally NOT expecting Nadeko to act like that. Infact it was just as Kaiki said, she felt far more threatening and creepy like this.

I would also like to point out, Nadeko's room. It was back to how it looked in Nise when she was busy trying to seduce Araragi, very different to the dark, empty and threatening void of a room we saw in Otorimonogatari.

Also, the voice acting of everyone (all 3 of them) was astounding this episode. The little nuances in Senjougahara's voice when she talked about her parents visiting Araragi, she seemed slightly nervous, perhaps embarrassed even, for Kaiki to be hearing this. Needless to say, Kaiki was as suave as ever, even with that new hairdo, his analysis of Nadeko's parents was sharp and to-the-point: They don't actually care about *Nadeko*, its all about keeping up apppearances and the facade of a happy family, similarities to Hanekawa's arc a little too.

Lastly, Kana Hanazawa stole the show. Again. Just like how she transformed from her usual shy voice to her [Badass Gangsta' voice](http://i.minus.com/i7Q97Vw42JVBo.gif) to her full on [Yandere voice](http://i.minus.com/imJn6DIucZsax.gif). We got another one today: the happy, uncannily threatening one: Every time she delivered her violent lines in a completely joyful tone, I couldn't help but [flinch, just like Kaiki](http://i.imgur.com/ZTehUrG.png) was bracing himself for. 
>> ARTICLE
I want to like Nadeko, but after what shes done I kinda hate her. Although I can't help love her whenever I see her, with KanaHanas voice and that design :>



>> ARTICLE
> I would also like to point out, Nadeko's room. It was back to how it looked in Nise when she was busy trying to seduce Araragi, very different to the dark, empty and threatening void of a room we saw in Otorimonogatari.

It was also a completely different size. Remember how big that room was in nise? Looking at it from Kaiki's perspective I don't know how they played twister in there.
>> ARTICLE
> They don't actually care about Nadeko, its all about keeping up apppearances and the facade of a happy family, similarities to Hanekawa's arc a little too.

I am actually a little interested in this part and I wonder if they will ever go a bit more into Nadeko's life. That whole scene in Nadeko's house just felt odd and weird for me. As if her there are some dark secret behind her whole life. When Kaiki was going through her photo album, normally I'd say "That's cute." But I felt bothered by it. As if her parent made her what she is. A cute/happy looking girl who is actually really sad and hurt on the inside.

Seeing Nadeko again made me happy but also sad to see how messed up she became.
>> ARTICLE
It feels like she has been forced to conform to a certain ideal her entire life. This is what made it so easy for her to latch onto and attach to Koyomi in the first place. It also kinda explains why she is so happy and free to become a god and live in the shrine alone.

In addition to this, her history of forcing herself into a mold means that it is very easy for her to lie/deceive herself, which basically results in our current Nadeko. She is utterly convinced she loves Koyomi, and will happily say she will kill them all while thinking it is the completely normal and rational action to take.

I would almost call it [indoctrination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoctrination), but we will have to see.
>> ARTICLE
When her parents said that they didn't want to know about Nadeko's hidden thoughts/secrets, my first thought was how horrible that is. It's absolutely atrocious to think of anyone that blatantly avoids getting to know their child and doesn't care about what they're going through. And then he finds out that although Senjougahara hates Nadeko and the type of person she is, she's never actually met her. She's never had a decent one on one conversation with the person she was before she snapped. 

No one cared to even try to understand who Nadeko was and what she was going through, other than maybe Araragi. It's no wonder it all built up until she snapped, and of course she would fall in love with Araragi. I feel it's very appropriate for a master liar to help crack the girl who's never really had to, since everyone else in her life built the lie for her. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the saddest bit was when she was happy when Kaiki called her creepy. Like goddamn, talk about being broken

Last episode was great. Kaiki and Senjougohara are the best. I dont want to jinx this episode by assigning any expectations to it. Lets roll!

**Episode 22**

0:09 - [His style cannot be stopped](http://i.imgur.com/nQvtx83.jpg)

0:15 - [Looks like were done with costumes now.](http://i.imgur.com/vmpJQ37.jpg) The battle is over!

0:52 - [His character is just too compelling.](http://i.imgur.com/TkKiYN5.jpg) He makes everybody else look bad by being such a vivid articulation of the secretly sympathetic villain

1:24 - [Nice backgrounds in this place.](http://i.imgur.com/LyAEfkp.jpg) That shiny floor makes the mirroring effect come naturally

1:38 - [I think hes starting to like this outfit](http://i.imgur.com/IVmZXvJ.jpg)

3:17 - [And now theyre visiting the aquarium together?](http://i.imgur.com/SS1pWmc.jpg) Well, its nice making new friends

3:29 - [Cant wait for those two to meet.](http://i.imgur.com/NtWHDRR.jpg) Although I guess I could say the same about any good pair of characters in this show - when characters are written with as much personality and distinctive voice as this cast, its pretty much a joy seeing any of them talk to each other. This show is serious dialogue porn

3:45 - [Nice shot, mirrored vertically once again.](http://i.imgur.com/mRlj7z3.jpg) The horizon lines white shifting to blue in both directions, the curve of the caves roof splitting the curve of the beach

3:56 - [And again.](http://i.imgur.com/VNODLKd.jpg) Shinbo really likes these shots, and with good reason - not only do they create pretty, quirky compositions, they also kind of feed into the otherworldly sterile perfectness of all of this shows environments. This doesnt feel like a place, it feels like a series of ostentatious sets

4:22 - [Looks like Senjougaharas back to her old self](http://i.imgur.com/nfqpT6D.jpg)

5:07 - [Kaiki arc yeaaah](http://i.imgur.com/i7Wioem.jpg)

5:56 - [This is adorable.](http://i.imgur.com/OSlsHSN.jpg) Goddamnit Kaiki, will your endearing mannerisms never stop emerging?

6:19 - [Uh whats this place?](http://i.imgur.com/kzmlL7A.jpg) We *never* get shots of the city/town that look like this - it seems like only Kaiki, the outsider, can actually see the town as a whole, see the various buildings as more than generic shapes seen every day and taken for granted. Or perhaps its an indicator of his perspective as the one *adult* - he sees a city where most of the other characters see a school, a house, and then a bunch of places where adults do stuff. From their perspective, those buildings might as well be props, or eternal construction sites

6:25 - [Again, so much more detail and specificity to this shot than usual.](http://i.imgur.com/D07Yy9n.jpg) But this effect did *not* extend to Okinawa hm

**And Done**

Well that was entertaining. Im not sure what I was expecting from the return of Crazy God Nadeko, but that was that was pretty great. Kaikis put-upon toleration of her hyper nonsense was also great, as was seeing the town from his perspective. Not much to say - Kaiki arc is Kaiki arc. Finishing strong so far!

I mentioned this [earlier in the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1rs3ws/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cdqn69s), but I really love how completely childlike Nadeko is depicted in this episode.  Just in a dialogue-writing way it mixes things up delightfully - Nadeko is quite capable of turning Kaiki into a big red smear on a whim, but emotionally she's completely under-equipped to deal with a master manipulator like Kaiki.  Both of them are able to hurt the other in different ways.  This whole season's been pretty amazing in how character depictions change depending on the narrator, and yet never feel untrue to what came before it.

It's also sort of interesting how Kaiki's really trying to find out what's wrong with Nadeko, and is clearly more than a little disgusted by her parents (and even with Araragi).  All Senjougahara wants is Nadeko neutralized, but *Kaiki* of all people seems to have the most responsible, parental attitude of actually trying to help her.  It really does highlight how young most of our cast is in comparison.  Even in the last episode he clearly seemed to want to help from the beginning, and had to search through his personal code until he found an acceptable reason, rather than his code forcing him into it.

I'm *really* curious now what exactly happened between him and Gahara from his perspective.

That overwhelming "happiness" that Nadeko is showing... The true mark of someone who has lost it. Man, that just felt so weird. Kaiki is such a great character. I can definitely see why so many people were saying that we would love him!

So it seems Kaiki himself has some unrequited love issues. One of the text says "since that woman died from a traffic accident" "I had fallen in love, but I never lost that love" 

Interesting. I wonder if that person will be made relevant in this arc or in some other.

And goddammit Nadeko, you're creeping the hell out of me. Stop being so darn cheerful. But I guess she likes the freedom of being a god compared to being the cute Nadeko she was pressured to be. 

Overall good ep and Kaiki is too based.

>> ARTICLE
Kaiki and Oshino all seem to be rather intrigued by Hanekawa. What could her role in the end be?
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because she's capable of creating apparitions, which is something none of them have seen before(except maybe Gaen, because she knows everything). Though it was caused by her identity issues, it would be interesting to see if she would be able to control something like that.
>> ARTICLE
She's already shown some degree of control over the power in neko:kuro. 

[Neko:kuro spoiler](/s "When Araragi texts her that he is in trouble with vampires after him. Within 30 minutes she comes bursting thru the wall of the cram school prepared to annihilate anyone posing harm. She finds only Araragi and realizes she's been tricked and talks in her normal voice, showing that all the Nyan-ing was partially an act.")

Edit: I totally misread, control over the ability to create apparitions would be something indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah. All the apparitions are in some sense an extension of herself so it makes sense she could control Black Hanekawa, but being able to be fully conscious of the "cutting off" and willingly "cutting off" and "reattaching" would border on godlike.
>> ARTICLE
> but being able to be fully conscious of the "cutting off" and willingly "cutting off" and "reattaching" would border on godlike.

Just like how Aaagi said it in the episode 4. She's so perfect it's creepy. 
>> ARTICLE
I believe it's because Hanekawa reminds them of Gaen.
>> ARTICLE
Oh damn, I never even drew that connection.

This just got way more interesting. The list of mysterious characters is now pretty long.
>> ARTICLE
The contrast is quite intentional, I think. Hanekawa always says "I don't know everything. I just know what I know," whereas Gaen always says "There is nothing that I don't know. I know everything."
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know that, and I remember their meeting back in Nekomonogatari: Shiro, but it never occured to me that Hanekawa may not be as inferior to Gaen as she thinks she is.
>> ARTICLE
Kaki is so awesome, his thought process is hilarious, and it would seem he has quite the history behind him. Favorite line this episode-
Kaiki: "What's that boy doing? Is he a criminal?"



>> ARTICLE
It's fantastic to get a regular(ish) adult's perspective. As the audience, we spent enough time with the cast that it's bittersweet rather than disgusting when an 11y/o stands on a robot to kiss a high schooler with tongue. 

Kaiki is echoing my own feelings on Ararai playing fast and loose with a bunch of young girls in this season. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey!, Mayoi was like 21 by then :p

>> ARTICLE
I've been dying to know what was in the closet ever since in Nisemonogatari where she freaks out about Araragi opening it. I need to know!
>> ARTICLE
lol kaiki's new trench and hairdo, looks exactly like one of those Japanese detectives in the old school movies haha
>> ARTICLE
I have a theory that the members of the Occult research society each correspond to a member of the main cast. Gaen definitely corresponds to Hanekawa, and Oshino Meme probably corresponds to Araragi. The other two are harder to match, but I'd say that Yodzuru corresponds to the Fire Sisters (based on the 'hero of justice' angle). I already suspected that Kaiki corresponded to Senjougahara, but this arc definitely supports it.

Then again, I might just be reading too much into it.

>> ARTICLE
Does anyone think that conversation in the shirine was a lie? I mean kaiki is not a person that would make simple mistakes like saying his name or calling a god "disgusting". More so he had basis to know that he could say such things without reprecusions. It looks like he's pretending to be sloppy and less smart than he actualy is.

Also he did not say alot about the closet. Either he knows what is in there or knows how to see what is inside.
>> ARTICLE
"My take is that calling her "disgusting" was him confirming a hypothesis, not a mistake. He already knew she she had issues with "cute" thanks to his visit to her parents.

Iink you're right about everything else, though: Kaiki does consistently disparage himself, going so far as to claim he has no powers when that's patently bullshit. (He's going around casting spells and seeing apparitions all over the place.) Any mistake he tells you about was on purpose, and any mistake he actually makes will be framed as intentional.


>> ARTICLE
Damn, this arc is awesome.

I was a bit sceptical about Kaiki being the narrator at first, but he's nailing this, showing us a whole new perspective about a lot of the characters. This adult character lens we're seeing this arc is really cool.

And then the detective coat, together with that great soundtrack, Kaiki going around investigating, this is just awesome.

I can't wait for next week!

Anyone having issues with Daisuki this week?

Took me over an hour to finish the episode due to constant buffering issues.

I have been anticipating this for so long and my god is it worth the wait, baring the weight of my expectations excellently. So many delicious shots of Kaiki with a perceptive, deceptive, look into his inner concealed concerns and controlled considerations. 
 
 Anyway, my attempts at Nisioisin-esque writing aside, I do love how consistent the author is with images and symbols. Kaiki is getting some brilliant development, cue hair style change. Then upon talking with Nadeko, revealing his actual name and thinking about his own deeper feelings, he pulls his hair back to momentarily restore the image of standard version Kaiki. 
 
 It's all so clever and suave and I love it.

Finally we have arrived at the end of Second Season with Hitagi End. This is I think the most popular arc in the series for a variety of reasons. The most glaring is the change in narrator. It really makes you aware that the story is usually told from the point of view of Araragi and the sudden shift makes you realize how skewed the view is now and how it also must have been from the start. With this change in view also comes a new look at who Kaiki is and painting him as more than just a one dimensional villain. He already did not seem that from Nise but it was not as obvious back then. One of the most interesting parts was the mental gymnastics he preformed to convince himself to help Senjougahara and Araragi because it would go against the world view he has forced himself to adopt(Kanbaru saves the day here).   
I think his world view is one of the most interesting things about Kaiki. He wasn't always a cynical grumpy guy. Back in college he had a girlfriend, and more importantly an unrequited love. I think losing her twice, once when he could not approach her and once more when she died really broke him. It's the reason he is so obsessed with money now. He is scared of losing something valuable to him again and so instead spends all his time collecting money instead. Money is valuable to him because he sees it as worthless and easily replaceable.  
I think over the course of this arc he had started to let go of this mindset and finally let himself become attached to other things. This is probably the reason he choose to kill himself off at the end of the story as well, penance for straying from his path.    
I think this is an arc you really should pause to read all the text. For instance when he tells Nadeko the lie that [Araragi, Senjougahara  and Shinobu died in a car accident](http://i.imgur.com/YoFt0CZ.png) it's reminiscent of when he told Senjougahara that [her would be rapist also suffered the same fate](http://i.imgur.com/SazP8OF.jpg), most likely that was a lie too. A traffic acident to Kaiki is something so impersonal and unremarkable that it's his go to lie. There is no reason for it happening and nothing you can do to prevent it. And if you pay attention to the text at the end of part two we find out why he feels that way. Tooe, his unrequited love, [died in a car accident](http://i.imgur.com/WY9FMpG.jpg). I think that was the point where he decided to no longer be attached to anything and just worship money instead. Of course his action towards Kanbaru prove he failed to do even that.    
Of course there are more character in this arc than just Kaiki. Most notably Nadeko. Well snake a shit. I mean we all know that by now.   
  
The extent of her shittiness is only really apparent now though. Her life was not working out like she wanted it to, which was her fault by the way, and she decided to end it all. The way I see it becoming a god in monogatari is akin to suicide. You're leaving your humanity behind to go dick around a temple forever. She would essentially be dead to everyone and in fact her parents and everyone else treat her as such. Not satisfied with just offing herself Nadeko decided to take a bunch of people down with her and really for the most stupid reasons.   
  
I mean beating the shit out of Araragi is nothing new, he's like the series' punching bag, but doing it out of envy is at least something I can understand. Nadeko wanted to do it simply because it fit a little story she had in her head. And not even stopping there she wanted to kill of a bunch more people simply out of spite. Nadeko is revealed to be a small, shallow person and not much has changed by the end of the arc. She is convinced not to go through with it but not because of her suddenly gaining sympathy but Kaiki just convinced her that her old life isn't worth throwing away. I don't think she ever showed remorse or regret at anything she's done and planned to do. She doesn't seem to be capable of it along with trust because she doesn't see anyone around her as someone she can sypmathise with. Maybe in the future she will not be so alone in her little world but it looks doubtful right now.  
  
Also a reminder that Hana is next. Lots of people seem to dislike Hana so if you're new please bear in mind it's a bit slow and you have to bear with it. If you've already seen it though please watch it again especially if you did not like it. A second viewing brings out quite a bit that you miss the first time. Either way I'll be trying to do a full writeup because Hana interests me quite a bit, disproportional with it's popularity at least.
>> ARTICLE
Fun read, but what do you mean by "chose to kill himself"? I didn't have time to rewatch this arc, but I feel like I would remember that...
>> ARTICLE
Well the story is told by Kaiki and he choose to end in such a way as to suggest his death at the hands of that kid with the club. It's not really clear why he would tell it that way other than "Kaiki lies" but I don't think that's a good enough explanation by itself.
>> ARTICLE
[Hana spoilers](/s "But he's in Hana, isn't he?")
>> ARTICLE
Yes. When I say "choose to kill himself off at the end of the story" I don't mean he actually died. I mean he presented the story in such a way as to make it seem like he died. He did this deliberately and I think there has to be a reason for it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, thats interesting! I'd never thought about that. 
>> ARTICLE
Hence he describes himself as an unreliable narrator. Just like how Araragi's interpretation of his world is often exaggerated beyond reality (sibling fights destroying highways, endless staircases, world's biggest bathroom, etc) Kaiki is also prone to certain embellishments, but he does this to us intentionally with the purpose of deception and storytelling rather than just passive imagination. Is everything he said completely accurate? Of course not, but it made a heck of a story for that arc, so it's best to just roll with it.
>> ARTICLE
Hana's actually one of my favorite arcs, despite it being rather serious in tone in comparison to the rest of the series. I also agree Hitagi End was great too, despite Senjougahara not really being the focus.
>> ARTICLE
So can someone explain to me why it's called Hitagi End? That title made me really scared for her when I first watched this arc.
>> ARTICLE
Even though it's not from her perspective, it gives us a lot of information about Hitagi, and sort of ends her arc; I assume the name is to reflect that, as in "this is the end of the Hitagi arc."
>> ARTICLE
I always thought that it's like end of the route in VN, dunno why
>> ARTICLE
I always just reasoned it as "Hitagi is going to meet her end at the hands of Nadeko, unless ____ happens"
>> ARTICLE
I'm not actually sure. I believe the actual name is koimonogatari which is love story.
>> ARTICLE
The book's title is Koimonogatari but the only chapter or whatever within it is literally named "Hitagi End" (/*Hitagi Endo*), although that doesn't help answer the question.
>> ARTICLE
> That title made me really scared for her when I first watched this arc.

You were not alone.

I believe that was intentional considering they implied a horrible tragedy multiple times.
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki went from badass asshole to my favorite male character of all time. Not just in anime, but in all fictions.  
That's some life lesson right there!
>> ARTICLE
Regardless how much I prefer Bake over SS, Hitagi End is still my second favorite arc in the entire series after Snail arc. It's a masterpiece.

 Kaiki is not only a brilliant character, but one of a kind MC.
>> ARTICLE
This arc is why I feel that money isn't always Kaiki's motive, but the way he justifies his actions. I mean, in Nise, why would he up and leave so easily despite having made nowhere near his 3 million yen goal after visiting Kanbaru's house after being told by Senjougahara, even after going through the trouble of setting the bee on Karen? He clearly does not feel guilty for breaking the Senjougahara family apart, so it can't be that, and I'm pretty sure that if he can take on Karen, he can take on Koyomi and Senjou too.
>> ARTICLE
Well in Nise he made up the difference by selling out Tsukihi to Yozuru. Also I do think he feels if nothing else at least partly responsible for Senjougahara after trying to help her and having to break their family apart.  
Also Karen is nowhere near the level of Araragi and Shinobu and Kaiki sensed there was something in Araragi's shadow.

That being said my friend had the same reaction but when I spoke to him about it he facepalmed knowing how silly he was being lol.

Haha some mad people that don't bother thinking about what they watch in this sub.

One of the best arcs I've ever seen
>> ARTICLE
This is the story arc that really sold me on Monogatari. I'd enjoyed it plenty up until this point, but this arc is the one that made me a real fan. Luckily, I was late getting into it to begin with, so this arc had just started airing while I was busy marathoning everything before it.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't do this rewatch, but I wanted to say a couple things about this arc, as it was by far my favorite out of Second Season (which I generally didn't enjoy).

I felt pretty proud of myself when I actually caught a bit of wordplay. When Kaiki is deciding whether or not to accept Hitagi's request, he says, "Yes." But he says it so hesitantly & slowly that you might think he's about to say, "Iie," which of course means "no." Perhaps if I caught all the wordplay like that, I would like the show more, who knows?

This arc basically confirmed to me what I've noticed in a few shows: the adults are much more interesting than the kids. Kaiki is just great, all the time. I didn't get sick of him by the end like many others. Fuck Araragi, basically.

If i had to take a guess, I would say beer bottles. She said she had been wanting sake, and that her father only drinks beer. She did not even hesitate when he put the bottle down, and why would he even think to bring it anyways. On top of all that she may have turned to alcohol to deal with all the pressures on her, her parents would not have expected her to steal them because she always did what she was told so it kinda fits. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's that complicated. As I understand it, Sake is a traditional offering at shrines. No need for a convoluted reason like her stealing alcohol from her parents.

Great episode this week, but I can't believe that there are only two episodes left :(

[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Having the ED still playing in the background, I must say it's really good. I love it. Oh and the OP too.

Aside from that, another great episode. This has to be one of my favourite arcs, if not my one favourite arc so far. I think that what Senjougahara means with Nadeko being an enchantress, is making Kaiki think she's not all that bad. After all, apart from her airheadedness and her intent of killing Araragi, Senjougahara and Shinobu, she hasn't really shown a bad side of her. Kaiki though, he doesn't seem affected by it so far. It's only natural that Senjougahara is worried though. (Her being worried also pointed out by Kaiki in the hotel room with Hanekawa, like asking him if how he's going to do it, and if he intends to go through with it)

That note, someone wants Kaiki not to go through with him. I don't think it's to prevent the city to fall in ruins, I think it's rather that the writer of the note wants the two of them to die.

EDIT: Because I was bored, I decided to make the plan Kaiki drew a bit more easy to read (it was a mess with those subtitles): **[Kaiki's drawing](http://i.imgur.com/65dC81e.png)**

Another great episode, but why didn't you show us what was in Nadeko's closet Kaiki? I dying to know what made you react like that.

Also, in the beginning with [Kaiki discovering the letter](http://i.imgur.com/jDHQgfu.png), and Senjougahara's phone call was great - especially when Senjougahara tells him that anyone could have slide the envelope under his door. [And his reaction when he know's she's right.](http://i.imgur.com/oQALoKG.png)

Also, does anyone know who does the character art for the Monogatari ED's? They're pretty awesome. [And here's a picture of Kaiki blowdrying his hair.](http://i.imgur.com/6sKndC1.png)
>> ARTICLE
The hairdryer part was particularly funny because after he'd stopped blowdrying his hair it settled, but then when Senjougahara claimed she wasn't a kid his hair started blowing again like it was all just hot air.

The ED drawings are by Hajime Ueda. Also known for doing a FLCL manga adaptation that was possibly even stranger than the actual show.

This episode was nice. I am still loving that OP.

EDIT: Kaiki brought up a good point. There does seem to be another hand at work in this whole thing, so the question of 'Who is the enemy?' is one to not let slip by. This Nadeko thing seems like it's just the tip of the iceberg now. 
>> ARTICLE
Why does Kaiki in the shower remind me of [Shingeki no Kyojin spoiler](/s "Eren's Titan form")?
(first pic to be exact)

I didn't see it at first, but now I can never unsee it. That's a weird resemblance...
>> ARTICLE
I never watched SNK but I think Kaiki in the shower reminded me more of Zetsubou-sensei when he goes shirtless. Pale and skinny lol. Only thing is Kaiki did have a bit of build to him that was unexpected. Kaiki, where do you work out?!
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't strike me as buff in the slightest, that's like a typical low fat mass, almost anybody could look like that if they watched what they ate 
>> ARTICLE
Given the tendency for the show to vary representations of characters based on perspective, maybe this is another aspect of that? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if Kaiki ever came off as the type to be full of himself. He seems like he knows he's above children really sees himself to be above those younger than him, but being vain might be a step too far lol.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps, but given what he freely admits about himself he's the last person I'd expect to be above deceiving the viewers.  Or himself, for that matter.

Kaiki x Nadeko

Kaiki x Money

...Damn, this guy is so "shippable". And he is also slowly building his own harem.

I can see them all viable.

He's actually just usurping Araragi's Harem. Just like he usurped Araragi's role as MC for this arc. Also he's doing a better job at it.
>> ARTICLE
I would agree in a canonical sense, were it not for the fact that Kaiki is incredibly condescending towards, and out of touch with, the younger generation. Plus, his first and only true love died abruptly.

Well, there's always a possibility of AU OVAs.

This is a dumb question so I waited for the thread to get off the front page before asking. What does 'canonical sense' mean here? I searched the dictionary and I still can't figure out what it means. :P

I know we've already been spoiled with the opening theme, but there needs to be a rap sung by Kaiki. OG 80s Kaiki.
>> ARTICLE
"You down with OPP? Yeah you know me!" 
 
 It would be almost too fitting for Kaiki.
>> ARTICLE
Hanekawa really reminds me of Gaen. So many winding, complicated plans and schemes in the works here, by the end of the monogatari series I hope someone will make like a timeline of all the things going down cuz its pretty insane
>> ARTICLE
Funny that Kaiki even comments on this during the episode. 
>> ARTICLE
I see a lot of speculation, even from Kaiki, that Hanekawa is disinclined to ask about his motivation for helping Senjougahara and Araragi because she thinks it doesn't matter, as long as he's helping them... but the way she smirks when he asks the second time makes it seem like she already KNOWS why he's helping them. The way the topic of "knowing" comes up right afterwards seems to point towards this, as well. Knowing Kaiki and how adults seem to be portrayed in this arc, he may even realize this but chooses not to pursue it, for whatever reason.

To me, it just seems like Hanekawa knowing Kaiki's motivation is a lot more likely than her blindly trusting that his reasons are strong enough to keep him from betraying her friends.

edit: and as an afterthought, we can't forget that Kaiki told us straight-up that he was going to be an unreliable narrator at the beginning of this arc.
>> ARTICLE
I see a Hanekawa and Gaen parallel here.
>> ARTICLE
There is a parallel but with a stark and important difference:

http://i.imgur.com/DpRnyrr.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/N7XX27t.jpg


This contrast has been emphasized time and time again so I'm betting it plays an important role. 
>> ARTICLE
Those lines always remind me of Socrates:

>I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.
>> ARTICLE
A weird part of me is hoping that at the end we see the young characters take on the roles of Oshino's college crew. Like a whole "new generation takes over thing." Araragi becomes the new Oshino, Senjougahara the new Kaiki, Kanbaru the new Kagenui, and Hanekawa the new Gaen. 
>> ARTICLE
The parallels for Oshino and Gaen are believable, if not perfect, but Kaiki and Kagenui, not so much.
>> ARTICLE
Kagenui is a stretch, and I really only put Kagenui and Kanbaru together because up until now they're the most athletic/physically strong of their respective groups.  
 
 I would push the Senjougahara/Kaiki parallel a bit more. Senjougahara's less greedy than him, but of the main cast, I'd say she's the most willing to lie to/manipulate people behind Kaiki himself. They both have that attitude of casual heartlessness. Koimonogatari has definitely led me to believe that Senjougahara and Kaiki are extremely similar to one another. 
 
 My other line of reasoning(and I'm not saying it's perfect) would be that Araragi/Oshino are the "help others help themselves" type, Senjougahara/Kaiki are manipulators, Kagenui/Kanbaru handle things through physical confrontation, and Hanekawa/Gaen are carriers of knowledge.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you completely. In fact I think the Senjougahara/Kaiki parallels are some of the strongest. After all she manages to convince/trick Sengoku into allowing them until graduation to live. Like Kaiki she has no direct connections to oddities (the one that she had left no residual effects unlike the other characters).

Araragi while similar to Oshino has very little practical knowledge. Really it's araragi + shinobu that equate to Oshino and even then they are inferior. 

Gaen/Hanekawa is a much stronger parallel in my opinion. I would put it at second strongest. Although while Gaen boasts about her knowledge, Hanekawa always denies it. Gaen is arrogant about it, while Hanekawa is modest.

I also agree with the Kagenui/Kanbaru relationship not being that strong. In a way Araragi is almost closer to Kagenui because they both have loli familiars. Really one of the problems is that Kaganui has gotten the least screen time, but the same could also be said of Kanbaru, so maybe that is the correct parallel after all.
>> ARTICLE

I agree that Araragi doesn't fit with Oshino. Aarararagi has strong feelings for what is right and does what he thinks is right anytime and every time he can. Oshino was far more neutral. He was driven to help other by himself he was asked to help.

The question about he forgery comes to mind. I'd think Aararagi would see the original as worth more, at least logically. He still accepted his phoenix sister, but it wasn't because the fake sister was equal value or greater value; it seemed like it was despite the fact that a fake is not equal or greater value because family is irrational.
>> ARTICLE
Also: Remember that Senjougahara managed to trick 2 people to believe that she could see a ghost, one of the two being tricked being the ghost. That's some Kaiki level deception going on right there.


>> ARTICLE
That's exactly what I'm talking about. After Gaen told Hanekawa she doesn't know anything, I'm even more inclined to believe that at this point Hanekawa is at least CLOSER to knowing everything than we're giving her credit for.

Closet?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, closet. Couldn't think of the right word.
>> ARTICLE
Hanekawa returns in style! Missed her character in the show.

Although I'm curious. I thought we left off when Kaiki was about to open the closet. So what's in the damn thing? Also, it's a bit of a long stretch, but I'm going to guess that Ougi is the one who sent the note for an unknown reason.. she probably doesn't want more people to get involved in this than needs to be for her plans.
>> ARTICLE
My guess for who sent the note is Oshino Meme.


>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm glad this episode reinforced the fact that Kaiki is the kind of person who'd overlook the possibility of a letter being slipped under the hotel room's door.

Glad that Senjougahara pointed out the obvious to him *this* time, even though it was about something that hardly matters, because when Kaiki outlined to her his extremely flawed plan last episode, all she did was ask him "Wouldn't she confirm Araragi is dead?" which is stupid because Nadeko wouldn't even need to check for proof that Araragi died in a car accident, she'd know right away it's a lie.

After the last episode I was left questioning whether Kaiki was just stupid or if he didn't know Araragi is an immortal half-vampire who can't die easily. No matter how much of an airhead Nadeko is supposed to be, she knows full well that Koyomi-onii-chan wouldn't die so easily, that she's one of the few that could really take his life away from him. After this episode though, I'm inclined to believe Kaiki is simply as stupid as he is smart. Easily overlooking the simplest most critical of details. That's also one hell of a thing for Senjougahara to overlook with her and Araragi's life on the line.

I hope that Kaiki outlines his plan to Hanekawa next episode, because of all people I'm sure *she* would remember that really important detail. If he doesn't do that  or she doesn't mention that to him, well, the whole town might be doomed because as Gaen feared, our master deceiver is heading for failure.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure Araragi wouldn't survive, say, a tanker truck explosion. Kaiki definitely overlooked the obvious there, but the situation could've been salvaged with some quick thinking.

Plus, Nadeko isn't aware that Kaiki knows about oddities, or that he personally knows Senjougahara and Araragi. Just because he says they died in a car crash, isn't reason at all to suspect him of conspiring with the half-vampire.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I think that Nadeko would suspect Araragi and Senjougahara of feigning their deaths, not conspiring with Kaiki.

edit: spelling
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since Nisemonogatari, so I forget... does Kaiki even know Arararararagi isn't just a normal boy?
>> ARTICLE
Now I feel stupid for overlooking that as well. I'm normally one to catch details like that. I blame Kaiki's excellent lying prowess. If it worked on me I bet it would work on Nadeko as well. Plan is a guaranteed success.
>> ARTICLE
Enough dillydallying! Time to discover the secret of Nadekos closet!

**Episode 24**

0:04 - [Good lord I love Kaikis city shots.](http://i.imgur.com/HnmGjys.jpg) This ones particularly distinctive - its great how much definition of the landscape we can draw from the city lights alone

0:21 - [Another nice little quick-cut sequence.](http://i.imgur.com/2GzfqAT.jpg) Once again, Kaikis efficiency and narrowness of focus in moments like this emphasize how professional and in control he is with regards to very specific aspects of his life. Given a standard problem of his discipline, his movements are practiced and efficient, and the camera reflects this

...and of course theyre dragging out the closet reveal. Cant ever trust these guys

0:39 - [I dont even remember *ordering* Kaikiservice!](http://i.imgur.com/jsvPfCj.jpg)

0:47 - [Well thats ominous](http://i.imgur.com/U7qMHkE.jpg)

0:50 - [Its just gonna go to waste if I dont take it, right?](http://i.imgur.com/feQvruW.jpg)

1:06 - [Weve got the spotlight on for this scene.](http://i.imgur.com/BEQbu4p.jpg) Considering how much of this arc has been a Kaiki monologue, are they telling us its actually necessary to indicate a scene where Kaikis being honest with *himself?* Or with *us*, likely - Kaiki established this story as a performance from the very start

1:15 - [So are we meant to take this seriously?](http://i.imgur.com/XnEAR7J.jpg) Is Ougi getting involved?

3:04 - [Its like Kaikis the only one who understands how the camera really works here,](http://i.imgur.com/NtfOmWw.jpg) and so hes the only one whos actively posing for it all the time. He knows perspective is a lie, and so hes having fun with it

3:30 - [The banter between these two is great.](http://i.imgur.com/yEplxow.jpg) Kaiki is Senjougaharas grumpy but ultimately indulgent favorite uncle

4:19 - [Jeez, getting really overt with the spotlight.](http://i.imgur.com/P7CT85Y.jpg) Its not even pretending to be a natural flourish anymore - its like Utenas rose-color frames, screaming *pay attention! pay attention!*

5:05 - [Hold up.](http://i.imgur.com/QjXioIS.jpg) This is news to us, right? So Gaen planted the weapon Ougi led Nadeko to use? But Gaen said she wanted *Shinobu* to become the god so was this after Araragis trip to the past, which I assume was sorta indirectly responsible for invalidating Shinobu as a choice for godhood? Man, this is getting all kinds of muddled

6:03 - [Nice cityscape](http://i.imgur.com/xTtNhkR.jpg)

6:16 - [Interesting shot.](http://i.imgur.com/r7aQdHI.jpg) 

8:05 - [Hes getting annoyed.](http://i.imgur.com/y4hkSuX.jpg) His reasoning isnt great, but he knows this is a weakness for her. Pretty dangerous of Senjougahara to intentionally poke at his sentimentality, but I guess to her, all his actions are pretty incomprehensible, so she cant conceive of him doing this out of the very well-hidden goodness of his heart

9:04 - [And now we get Kaiki being adorably paranoid.](http://i.imgur.com/vYMKt2F.jpg) This arc is too much

9:22 - [Another nice city shot.](http://i.imgur.com/l45YpRP.jpg) They do keep it interesting

10:20 - [And another.](http://i.imgur.com/iuCVX7L.jpg) Kaikis perspective rules

11:46 - [Kaiki so tolerant](http://i.imgur.com/BZDOHoB.jpg)

13:03 - [Will you quit it with that](http://i.imgur.com/q7iuSbV.jpg)

13:09 - [Or do I have to beat you at your silly game](http://i.imgur.com/0MYZNJt.jpg)

14:16 - [His charts are so good.](http://i.imgur.com/zPOh4Vt.jpg) I love the false modesty of his self-portrait scribbles here - yeah, this guy looks silly, but we were all there for those indulgent shower shots, Kaiki. We know you know you sexy

14:55 - [It almost sounds like Im paying that young girl for her company.](http://i.imgur.com/oA4GTfx.jpg) I know! Ill buy her liquor! Brilliant

15:10 - [Wouldnt dream of it](http://i.imgur.com/bJqjyAH.jpg)

16:24 - [Monogatari approves of underage drinking.](http://i.imgur.com/dHloWGq.jpg) Also, apparently she drank her dads beer? Good to know

16:34 - [This show is too good for this world](http://i.imgur.com/YJoHnHo.jpg)

16:57 - [AH SHIT THIS ARC EVEN HAS HANEKAWA NO BRAKES ON THIS TRAIN.](http://i.imgur.com/AmWbtg3.jpg) Her embraced-personality hair is fantastic, too - the Isin character-growth haircuts Final Form

17:44 - [Regain control, Kaiki!](http://i.imgur.com/u9J9s8c.jpg) This one may be more powerful than the others, but shes still just a kid! She came to you because she needs assistance! You hold the cards!

18:58 - [Hanekawa sees the real final boss.](http://i.imgur.com/IAiqWuw.jpg) This season really is coming full circle - after three distant arcs, we get to loop back around and see Hanekawa actually in command of her own personality

19:27 - [Obviously this is all Kaikis interpretation of events,](http://i.imgur.com/aYGpPne.jpg) and so involves a level of deception beyond the actually telling you stuff they dont really want to be revealing usual lies of the Monogatari camera, but its great how uncomfortable theyre making Kaiki seem here. Not even attempting deception at the start, immediately trying to orient their conversation in the kid-adult dynamic his Senjougahara talks naturally fall into, little visual cues like his constantly focusing on the comforting regularity of the taxi fee - Kaiki is not necessarily in control here, and he does not like that feeling

19:49 - [In Monogatari, earnestly looking at yourself is the hardest thing in the world.](http://i.imgur.com/0X6usun.jpg) After that, everything else is easy. And Kaiki depends on the deceptions we tell ourselves - someone like current Hanekawa must be pretty frightening

20:16 - [A whole conversations worth of defensive banter from Senjougahara,](http://i.imgur.com/kELQrUj.jpg) two sentences of yeah, just stop by my hotel from Hanekawa. Hanekawa dont give a fuck

20:53 - [To put it briefly.](http://i.imgur.com/6BS6jeA.jpg) Look, Kaikis assuming his negotation battle stance again

21:28 - [Ahahaha yes.](http://i.imgur.com/ImZA7Ja.jpg) Well, Cat *was* the person she swore shed be honest with herself to, so it makes sense

21:42 - [More directly contrasting the two of them.](http://i.imgur.com/jeGRPZU.jpg) 

22:26 - [A far from accidental shot.](http://i.imgur.com/Xp9O6us.jpg) As the first Monogatari protagonist to truly embrace her own weaknesses and insecurities, Hanekawa is the first to possess anything resembling real vision. Whereas from other perspectives, we pretty much only see reality as a reflection of those characters own desires and insecurities, Hanekawa can now see other people, like the Kaiki here reflected in her eye. Unlike Senjougahara, she doesnt see her own fears of betrayal or lack of self-worth when staring at him - she sees him for the man he is. The ability to look beyond the self is the ultimate expression of power and freedom in this world

**And Done**

Oh man. That is a good, good feeling. Pretty much everything that has always impressed me about Monogatari was made powerfully explicit in those last few scenes - Hanekawa has actually escaped the mirror that is Monogataris view of reality. Shes always been one of my favorite characters in the show - in fact, yeah, she just *is* my favorite character in the show. I really love how distinctive and strong her particular shield was - her ability to appear normal or even in control was always much more well-articulated than Araragis or Senjougaharas, and I just find her overall personality very nuanced and compelling. And so seeing her now, far more well-adjusted and actively demonstrating the usual veils this show places between its representation of reality and reality itself, is just an absolute joy. Its also yet another place for Kaiki to shine, as we see for the first time that he cant dominate a conversation simply by being a reasonable adult - when he has to deal with someone who isnt continuously inventing their own reality, he can get rattled or even legitimately uncomfortable. So its great on a character-interaction level, great on a character-growth level, great on a meta-storytelling level, and great for me personally.

Yeah, personally. Because this show *has* become kind of personal to me, and that process has been almost... accidental. The first piece of actual anime criticism I wrote was my defense of Nisemonogatari as an exploration of representation and the cameras eye, back close to a year ago. Its not like it was my favorite show - I just found it really interesting, and found it strange that that conversation wasnt a common one when discussing the show. And that piece has remained one of my most visible, and Ive continued to document my thoughts on Monogatari as I worked through it, and so here we are in December and its pretty easily the show Ive spilled the most ink on to date. And Im actually very satisfied with that - I think Monogatari stands as a pillar of the things only anime can do, and I think its mixed reputation and tendency to be underestimated or written off as pandering nonsense make it an outstanding example of the challenges anime faces, the way it can embrace both high and low art instincts simultaneously, and the actual necessity of criticism. That shot of Hanekawas eye was a powerful moment here - the culmination of dozens of episodes of twisted representation and indulgent-seeming cinematography. That moment deserves to read as the emotional triumph it is, and if writing this stuff means one more person can enjoy that moment the way I did, then Im pretty happy to have done it.

See you next week, everybody... and thanks for reading. Its been a wonderful ride.

I couldnt stop laughing for a good 5 minutes and had to rewatch the last bit because of that. Hanekawa's return is too strong for me.

God Daisuki sucks. Trying to stream this episode has been a bit of a nightmare. 

That aside we have another great episode. I will say, I am disappointed that we didn't get to see what was in Nadeko's closet from last time, but hopefully we'll get that information soon enough. 

However that was more than made up for by getting to see Hanekawa again! I was worried she wouldn't be around anymore this season. I don't really know enough to speculate about her purpose, but I'll assume it specificly has something to do with holding up Gaen, instead of directly stopping Nadeko. Considering that she wants them to be saved, but is trusting Kaiki to handle the Nadeko situation, she'll probably be involved on the other side of the conflict. 

We still have a good bit to resolve in the next few episodes, so I'm guess the end of this season is going to be pretty exciting. We have to stop Nadeko, find out who's following Kaiki, find out what's up with Gaen, find out what's up with Ougi (which the last two are probably linked), and give everyone their happy ending that I really want. Please Nisio, be kind to us. 

Anyway, can't wait!

Interesting how Kanbaru is starting to look a lot like Hanekawa before she cut her hair; I wonder if that has any deeper meaning. Knowing Nisino I'm sure it probably does.

>> ARTICLE
Yesssssssssss!  Thank you <3
>> ARTICLE
Anyone have screenshots of the internal monologue for this episode? 

I think perhaps why Hanekawa didn't ask Kaiki about his intentions is that it ultimately doesn't matter what they are. As long as his intentions to save Gahara-san and Araragi, it's sort of none of her business what other motives he has. Their common goal is to save these two people, and while they have different motives, it seems Hanekawa only really cares to see it through so that her friends are saved.

I'm interested to know why Gahara-san thinks Nadeko is an "enchantress". Certainly, her cuteness and airheadedness makes her super moe that any man would go hnnnngggg, but Kaiki is likely immune to that being best girl and not a pedo. 

The note in Kaiki's hotel room, if not from Gaen, then was probably from Ougi. She was the one who ruined Gaen's plan to make Shinobu into a god, and turned Nadeko into a god instead. This means she has some stake in seeing the plan through, whether that means the end of our couple or the whole town. I doubt it's Ononoki, since her role so far seems to be a side-character/messenger between Kaiki and Gaen instead. What Ougi's intentions are though, are unknown so far. There's speculation that she's the "darkness" manifested in human form, but then what would be her role in ensuring Nadeko remains a god/Araragi and Gahara-san die?
>> ARTICLE
I think Gahara-san thinks Nadeko is an "enchantress" because I imagine Nadeko is a very good actor. She spent all those years being "cute", after all. Not to mention, isn't airheadedness a common trope among cutesy harem love-interests? Personally, I'm not sure if the airheaded Nadeko is merely an act, but I wouldn't put it past NisiOisiN. Nadeko may not be as knowledgeable or smart as Gaen or Hanekawa, but considering she's still being "cute", I could believe if she was trying to deceive Kaiki in some way.

I haven't read the novel at all, though, so I could be TOTALLY off with this.
>> ARTICLE
It's possible she doesn't intentionally manipulate everyone around her, it just happens, she can't just turn off being cute - which is why she hated  being called that. 
>> ARTICLE
I think one of the main points of her arc was that she didn't want to be "cute," but that she didn't really know how to interact with people, so she just always avoided confrontation and responsibility under that guise.
>> ARTICLE
>ensuring Nadeko remains a god

Wasn't the outcome of Kaiki's plan for her to remain a god anyway, though in ignorance of Araragi and Senjougahara their existence?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but in all likelyhood Kaiki's plan will go sideways, and Gaen knows that. [TehVict made some great points about this. 
](https://pay.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1svj8e/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/ce1vql9)
So another option is to turn her back into an ordinary human. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he was never planning on changing Nadeko. He just wanted to convince her that Araragi, and Senjougahara were dead so that she would forget about them. 

But Kaiki and Ougi I bet have pretty different intentions, Ougi may need Araragi and Senjougahara to be killed in order to perserve some kind of balance, and that may be why Gaen is trying to stop Kaiki. 

To be fair though, even though we all assume Ougi is involved in this situation she might not be at all. This could all be Gaen. 
>> ARTICLE
It's doubtful. Ougi HATES liars.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if Ougi hates liars, it's just said that Ougi's job is to punish them.

The series has also strongly implied that Ougi Oshino has something to do with the "darkness" from the Shinobu Time arc. The Black Hair and Black Eyes have similar elements, but I think it all chalks up to what she said her job was.
>> ARTICLE
HANEKAWA!!!!! 
>> ARTICLE
It was great seeing Kaiki in a sort of different light. He was intelligent as we all know but it was interesting to see him slightly more on guard, scared even? 

Anyway, I'm just glad for Hanekawa's return.

I really do miss Araragi. Bake, Nise and Neko shiro were basically his stories. While this second season, he's not here half the time. It's not like Kaiki's not cool (I like him way more than in Nise. I hated him in Nise), but I like Araragi way more. COME BAAAACK, WHERE ARE YOUUUU?

Kaiki should stay as the MC for the rest of forever.

Was this the final part of Hitagi End? Can I start watching this yet?

2 more episodes of it to go after this I believe (could be 3)
>> ARTICLE
Shit, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I want whatever is in there to come out of the closet now!
>> ARTICLE
I like the love for Kaiki, however the almost dislike for Araragi kind of stings a bit to read. I really enjoy his character and like him as harem king. 
>> ARTICLE
As someone who hasn't kept up with Monogatari, can someone just tell me if Senjougahara was in love with Kaiki at this point? I saw something that made me think that, just wanted to know. Or is she still w/ Araragi. 
>> ARTICLE
Not so much in love, as she was simply charmed by her first "knight in shining armor", that is, Kaiki, since he was the first person to help her with her family problems. Kaiki actually deceived Gahara into believing that he destroyed her family, but in reality, he distanced her away from her family because it was already too destructive for there to be any means of repair.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I know what happened back then, but I meant like did she fall back in love/affection now in second season. I remember in Nise them talking about how she fell for him for a bit back then. 
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, she's totally into Arararagi at this point (I flubbed). She's basically taking every single option that she can, to allow her and Arararagi to not be killed. So yeah, Kaiki, since he might be able to help.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh okay. I haven't seen much of Second Season yet, so I might catch up eventually. I despise Hannekawa, so I couldn't take past episode 6. 
>> ARTICLE
I believe the opening is meant to parody a false relationship between the two. So she's with Araragi.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh okay thanks I've been wondering that. Also, may I ask is that recap episode (episode 6) really needed? I really don't like Hannekawa, and I wanted to pick up monogatari again, so I was wondering if I could just skip that one. 
>> ARTICLE
The recap episodes cover what has happened in previous seasons. So as long as you know the story, no you don't.
>> ARTICLE
I never watched Neko, but I have seen both Nise and Bake. Is it still needed?
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like Hanekawa until I watched Neko. Maybe it'll change your opinion of it too.
>> ARTICLE
Only 4 episodes, really good, I suggest you go and watch it anyway. It was also released after Nise and before MS2 so I recommend watching it regardless.
>> ARTICLE
Eh I dont really want to personally. Not a big fan of monogatari. Thought I'd give the second season another try though. I meant does the recap cover anything outside of Nise and Bake?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so, one may cover Neko: Kuro though.
>> ARTICLE
The recaps cover the first season which includes bake, nise, and neko. I do highly recommend neko, however, as it was my favoritearc before this season and is much more self-contained than any of the others.
>> ARTICLE
Where do you get the endcards?
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki's drawings were hilarious. He should get a spinoff or something. Also, can someone remind me who Kagenui is? It's quite a while since I saw all the stuff preceding this season so my memory's fuzzy on some things.
>> ARTICLE
So did Araragi break up with Senjougahara?

What did she mean when she said she thought she was talking to Araragi about throwing her out? Is this in relation to the ultimatum Kaiki told her to give araragi last episode?

Edit: If anyone has read the LNs feel free to pm me answers to my questions if it spoils the story. :)  
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read ahead at all, but Araragi does hop around and hang out with a lot of other girls. Even if she loves him, that's gotta piss her off somewhere. I mean, he got how many kisses from other girls in Onimonogatari?
>> ARTICLE
I think she meant her "insult" to Kaiki for saying he would do such a thing as use her and throw her away. She doesn't hold back at all when it comes to banter with Araragi, but she feels obligated to keep up a level of politeness with Kaiki. Or, at the very least, to not cross certain lines.
>> ARTICLE
Gonna be editing this as I finish episodes, the first one took a lot longer than I expected. 

-----

**Tsubasa Tiger**

**01**

The first scene already sets the tone for the arc and the rest of the season, as well as introducing the main focus of SS. Where Bake and Nise served mostly as character introduction through the various arcs for everyone besides Araragi and Senjougahara, SS is all about how these characters find and define/redefine themselves and their identities. 

&nbsp;

In Hanekawas case, its clear from the seemingly [rhetorical questions she asks herself](http://i.imgur.com/g72wfLj.png) and the audience in the first scene. Theres a motif of emptiness/undefinedness in that first scene in her hall that contains only a futon and a roomba, with nothing that reveals her personality, identity, or self. Its too [clean.](http://i.imgur.com/AgNY2Zy.png) So Hanekawa tells us [this story](http://i.imgur.com/nFwWmye.png) will betray or invalidate Araragis claim that shes a saint, and show that shes a [flawed human being](http://i.imgur.com/xTwAJk0.png), just like everyone else, and in doing so, she will find herself.
 
&nbsp;

Theres a crapton of [literal red flags](http://i.imgur.com/ZspWgVw.png) or I guess war banners in this case when Hanekawa meets Hachikuji. Hachikuji is no longer the lost snail/cow but its still accurate to say that [Hanekawa doesnt feel at home at home,](http://i.imgur.com/QgYIbtK.png) so shes still, in a sense, lost. 

&nbsp;

More red flags as Hanekawa encounters the tiger at a [crossroads.](http://i.imgur.com/HDYNu9C.png) Its both literally a crossroads and metaphorically one as she faces herself at a personal crossroads. [White](http://i.imgur.com/PlRRLZS.png) ties into that motif of emptiness, blankness, and cleanness that was established in the first scene.

&nbsp;

Senjougahara cuts directly to the chase. [Araragis not around,](http://i.imgur.com/xeiiI0v.png) and Hanekawas reluctant to call on his help anyways. So what can she do? (Also cool [tiger stripe imagery](http://i.imgur.com/fbMCJgS.png) scattered around the episode)

&nbsp;

And then her house burns down, wiping the slate clean, while disrupting her daily routine again. She ignores or forgets that Senjougahara had offered to help her out if she needs it and instead heads to the cram school for the night. 

&nbsp;

The scene numbering skipping was a neat tool to let the audience figure out what was going on ahead of time. 

&nbsp;

Senjougahara and Hanekawa are foils and parallels. Both of them hide behind a facade, but Senjougaharas is brutal honesty that comes off as cold and indifferent, whereas Hanekawas is self-delusion in thinking that she can handle everything by herself. She claims she doesnt know everything, only what she knows, but she sure doesnt act like it. Hanekawas [mindset](http://i.imgur.com/QsMcbMm.png) blinds her to better options, as in the case of choosing to sleep in the cram school instead of asking for help. 

&nbsp;

The theme of whiteness and cleanness is juxtaposed with its opposite, with Hanekawas [disheveled bedhead](http://i.imgur.com/j1iePOk.png) and the burning house imagery. 

&nbsp;

Nice bonding moment with the two girls, and then the [big question](http://i.imgur.com/dR9LRVO.png) comes out. 

&nbsp;

[Bonus glorious Gahara shot.](http://i.imgur.com/cgO26Bu.png)

-----

**02**

[That Kizu tease though.](http://i.imgur.com/QtapQua)

&nbsp;

Hanekawa admits her own problems have not gone away, and [she hasnt changed,](http://i.imgur.com/7OOWmF4.png) even though shes gone through the cat stuff twice (plus Kizu stuff). Her home situation has only reached a [stalemate, a stopgap,](http://i.imgur.com/NHPGoN1.png) not a solution, just like [herself.](http://i.imgur.com/PUpNWNC.png) 

&nbsp;

The food conversation becomes relevant later on if I remember right.

&nbsp;

Another [crossroads.](http://i.imgur.com/R3pvBXv.png) Running away from her problems [doesnt work.](http://i.imgur.com/gMw31k9.png) 

&nbsp;

Senjougahara [offers a hint](http://i.imgur.com/4QwCPHz.png) at the solution to Hanekawas problem. She accepts Black Hanekawa and [acknowledges her](http://i.imgur.com/r3K8pd3.png) as Hanekawa and not just a kaii. 

&nbsp;

The food conversation returns! The discussion of [Hanekawas taste](http://i.imgur.com/slvd906.png), another element in the clean/bland/empty/white theme, ties directly into a discussion of her [character.](http://i.imgur.com/ebwa4oT.png) But shes only able to accept everything by ignoring and pushing off all of her negative emotions onto Black Hanekawa, which, as has been pointed out earlier, [isnt a solution,](http://i.imgur.com/RHkiOTm.png) only a temporary measure. 

&nbsp;

Again we end with the [pivotal question,](http://i.imgur.com/cOXgTI8.png) this time asked more seriously. 

-----

**03**

More discussion on how Hanekawa is too [white.](http://i.imgur.com/JtPefY2.png) And we know that shes only that way because she [pushes anything that isnt white](http://i.imgur.com/frl4yL8.png) onto Black Hanekawa. [Throwback to the fake/real theme in Nise.](http://i.imgur.com/BdfzVUB.png) 

&nbsp;

Kanbaru meeting was more just a glimpse into another arc, while at the same time once again emphasizing that Hanekawa needs to [face her problem by herself first,](http://i.imgur.com/TDgaRWp.png) and [actually face them,](http://i.imgur.com/pVMIott.png) not just [avoid them.](http://i.imgur.com/ERANlZ2.png) 

&nbsp;

Convincing Karen to let Hanekawa stay was a nice, light comedic scene. 

&nbsp;

Love [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/P8JnFi4.png) right after she talked about falling asleep around midnight, and when she falls asleep she switches personas. 

&nbsp;

Shinobu and Black Hanekawa talk plot but then Shinobu gives her insight into [Hanekawas situation.](http://i.imgur.com/BleGFVD.png) Like Senjougahara, she claims Black Hanekawa and Hanekawa are [one and the same entity.](http://i.imgur.com/tUWhQLa.png) Also just look at that shot, the lighting cutting starkly across the diagonal. So much symmetry there. Like two sides of a coin.

-----

**04**

[The beginnings of self-awareness.](http://i.imgur.com/BiAk4LW.png) She cant continue pushing her problems onto Black Hanekawa. 

&nbsp;

Nice contrast to the [breakfast scene](http://i.imgur.com/8lxt4mX.png) in the first episode.

&nbsp;

Mamaragi gives the [adult perspective.](http://i.imgur.com/YSF5rcR.png) [Direct and straight to the point,](http://i.imgur.com/au3zUvo.png) she describes exactly what Hanekawa does by [pushing everything onto Black Hanekawa.](http://i.imgur.com/3mKOvma.png) This whole conversation stemmed from Hanekawa saying that shes heading out (*ittekimasu*), once again relating to homes. So what she needs is to find herself and a [place where she belongs.](http://i.imgur.com/pR6KNS2.png)

&nbsp;

More plotty things and Kizu teases with Episode.  Episode [sees right through her](http://i.imgur.com/x1wcJ9V.png) as well. 

&nbsp;

Ah the one who actually [knows everything,](http://i.imgur.com/AbsFQNS.png) and the one who only knows [what she knows.](http://i.imgur.com/eBAKWmR.png) Amazing introduction scene actually, with Hanekawa serving as the point of reference. Gaen tells her again that she must [face this problem herself,](http://i.imgur.com/anQOmHY.png) because its [her own problem.](http://i.imgur.com/SoIRhYs.png) 

&nbsp;

[Home motif](http://i.imgur.com/nk7UqlE.png) comes back and ties into the Tiger/Kako kaii. The discussion with the Fire Sisters on the word fire neatly combines both aspects of her previous stress, her [home situation](http://i.imgur.com/GpXIBPU.png) and her [unrequited love.](http://i.imgur.com/zb70Y5O.png) And then she realizes what it actually is, that [shes envious.] (http://i.imgur.com/P0I07x5.png) Her house of cards collapses upon this realization. 

&nbsp;

[This is such a great moment.](http://i.imgur.com/mblcFve.png) Shes ready to accept the part of her that she cut off so long ago.

-----

**05**

The letter writing scene is fantastic. Screenshots dont do it justice so just watch it, someone else linked it in the thread. The scene transitions and cuts, just everything. Her realization that she didnt belong but she wanted to belong in her home, that she was jealous of it, and her decision to move forward and find her place is represented by the [travel sequence.](http://i.imgur.com/D21yI0m.png) The conclusion is so [powerful.](http://i.imgur.com/zZsowxI.png)

&nbsp;

Black Hanekawas [response](http://i.imgur.com/RO5NhN3.png) and reaction to it is excellent too. [Theyre no longer lost. *Ittekimasu.*](http://i.imgur.com/Cea9fgt.png) 

&nbsp;

Tiger talk is mostly stuff already reiterated multiple times throughout so I wont go into it, but Hanekawa [rejects this,](http://i.imgur.com/GdKKAGO.png) and she becomes one with Black Hanekawa.

&nbsp;

I actually hated that Araragi had to show up at the end the first time I watched since it sort of invalidates the entire arc, but Ive since reconciled with it. Beating the Tiger isnt what Hanekawa needed. She needed to be able to move on, to truly set herself free. Confessing to Araragi and being rejected allows her to finally do so. It allowed her to feel. To hurt. To live. 

&nbsp;

And to come full circle with the beginning, [Hanekawa returns to her new home. *Tadaima.*](http://i.imgur.com/cdEvjYH.png)


>> ARTICLE
*Went over the limit

**Closing thoughts:**

Basically Second Season is just ridiculously good, and Tsubasa Tiger is ridiculously good even by those standards. The only thing I would really change is Araragi at the end but I don't think it's that big of a deal anymore. I personally put this above Hitagi End but only because I really freaking love Hanekawa and her character growth and development. Each non-Araragi POV arc is god-tier, so I'm definitely looking forward to those. Not to say the others aren't good, it's just the ones I'm talking about are just *that* much better.

Tsubasa Tiger is my favorite arc because it perfectly encapsulates the core of Monogatari and what makes it great: real character growth, self-awareness, and self-acceptance. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm about to necro this, but here we go anyway.  

I came straight here after finishing Tiger for the first time moments ago, because I love seeing different perspectives on the show (I was following the rewatch until the end of nise).  

I have two questions for you, and perhaps its something I'm missing:

Does Hanekawa decide that she loves Araragi in Kizu?  I felt like that was out of nowhere, even if there were clear undertones towards it in previous seasons.

Why does she decide to change herself at the end of ep4?  I understand that she realizes she's dodging her emotions about Koyomi and her family to keep herself in ignorant happiness, but what makes her decide that that ignorance is 'bad?' Is it just the realization that she's been living a lie?

Thanks for the write up, by the way.  I enjoyed your explanation of the visual motifs (crossroads, tiger stripes, etc.).
>> ARTICLE
>Does Hanekawa decide that she loves Araragi in Kizu? I felt like that was out of nowhere, even if there were clear undertones towards it in previous seasons.

Chronologically it's not made clear until Tsubasa Cat which is actually her first arc in published/airing order, but that's the main conflict if you remember: she's suppressing her feelings for Araragi because he has Senjougahara. So it's revealed pretty early on, but you think it's fixed but it's not really resolved at all, much like most of the problems Araragi tries to fix in Bake. He only ever temporarily delays the issue but they have to be resolved somehow later, like Hanekawa does herself in Tsubasa Tiger.

Kizu is more about Araragi and Shinobu but it reveals quite a bit about Hanekawa's character, and then Neko:Kuro is after the events of Kizu when Araragi is trying to figure out what he feels for Hanekawa. 

>Why does she decide to change herself at the end of ep4?

This is sort of tricky but essentially it's because she realizes the way she's been living and handling things is wrong, harmful, and unhealthy (at least, in the author's eyes, which I'd agree with since I find it pretty compelling). This ties into the *kaii*/abberations being the literal manifestations of the metaphors for each character's problems. The *kaii* are their internal problems externalized, and go around harming themselves and those around them, which adds physical harm representing the already existing emotional hurt caused by said problems. At least that's how I'm interpreting it. 

And I think you got it with her realizing that her happiness is a lie, because she is actually deeply unhappy with most of the things in her life, but she's been suppressing her discontent and pushing them away rather than facing them and doing something about it. Which is one of the big themes of Monogatari: to face yourself and see yourself with clear eyes, to accept yourself, and to help yourself.

This was the arc where I actually started to ~~like~~ not hate Hanekawa. Especially around the end. Also based Gaen appears.

I didn't really have any strong feeling toward Hanekawa either way, she was just sort of *there*, but after I read Kizumonogatari I really felt like she was a character with a lot of chemistry with Ararararagi.

Oh I know, Shaft is my favorite studio and I love the Monogatari Series. Every time I see news realizing to Kizu I get my hopes up and then crushed. I'm pretty acclimated to it by now
>> ARTICLE
exactly. its half the reason kizu seriously needs to happen
>> ARTICLE
The other half (at least) being so we see more glorious Shinobu 
>> ARTICLE
So this arc contrasts a lot with nekomonogatari kuro(pun possibly intended) in a lot of ways. You might have seen my post last week claiming kuro is one of my least favorite arcs but this one is probably in my top 3.  
The most glaring difference is probably where they lie in the overall story. The three Tsubasa arcs, cat, family and tiger, are somewhat of a closed arc themselves. Naturally this means that family is the middle while tiger is the end. In the LN it makes more sense but as an anime it's split up into there different seasons and because of that the ending of family leaves me very unsatisfied.  
The ending of tiger however is really well put together and cathartic and [Hanekawa's letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxCtw62KRwc) is an amazing scene.  
  
The second difference is the way the stories are put together. Family was a flashback and really just linked the ever absent [kizu](/s "never") and bake. Meanwhile tiger is part of a larger story that is interwoven and it's actually very apparent by how much of the main cast makes an appearance. All of the main girls show up for at least a token appearance, except snake but who cares, and with the exception of possibly snail they are all plot relevant.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Monogatari SS two days ago and Tsubasa Tiger is my second favorite arc behind Hitagi End

That conversation between Hanekawa, Gaen and Episode had contents that would be more understandable if the watcher already knew of Kizu. SHAFT pls

Need a GIF of Hanekawa taking selfies

Hanekawa became true to herself. I also liked how a big theme in this arc was her envy and family. Her family has already adjusted after the fire and she envied them. Also the families who took her in, the Senjougahara residence and the Araragi residence, also had surprise appearances in the form of Koyomi's mom and Hitagi's dad. I guess you could think that Hanekawa also envied them for having a strong bond in the family in contrast to her broken family

Araragi petting Hanekawa was cute. It was a sign of affection and at the same time, alludes to Hanekawa being a catgirl

Then her confession to Araragi was brilliant. She had nothing to lose. Araragi and her has already built a strong friendship and Senjougahara was already his girlfriend. It was just closure. She just needed the answer so that she can move on. He turned her down. Araragi once loved Hanekawa. It's just that it wasn't at the same time as Hanekawa loved Araragi. Really sad

The ending of this arc was very emotional. As I've said in another thread that along with Bakemonogatari ep 12, Hanekawa's confession have made me bawl my eyes out

Who says you can't have multiple best girls in an anime? I consider both Senjougahara and Hanekawa to be best girls. On a more serious note, I like the show's treatment of characters where they're deeper than what they seem to be. I'm serious about Senjougahara and Hanekawa being my top 2 girls in Monogatari but that doesn't mean that the other girls don't have deep character and backstories themselves
>> ARTICLE
Episode 5 is one of my favorite episodes of anime ever. This arc in general completely changed my opinion of Hanekawa, and its conclusion was just perfection. The tiger was really well done, with the colors conveying heat and otherworldly-ness, and his movements conveying weight and power. The music also helps to make the first encounter in particular feel unnerving. Back to the ending, Ararararagi's reappearance felt so satisfying, as well as being totally badass. And of course, we then have pure catharsis. Amazing.

I've [written the hell out of this arc](http://wrongeverytime.com/page/3/?s=monogatari&submit=Search),  (and Hanekawa gets top billing in my [overall Monogatari essay](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/01/06/monogatari-and-the-monster-inside/)), but I might as well emphasize one more time that Hanekawa is friggin' fantastic. Not only is she as layered and compelling as any of the Monogatari characters, not only can she easily carry an arc through personality alone without having to destroy and rebuild herself to do it, but her story is basically the story of Monogatari itself. Proud and full of self-deception, haunted by her circumstances, brought low by the piercing light of focused Monogatari interrogations, rising stronger and (eventually) ready to help others find their feet. Nadeko's material is the flashy part of season two, but Hanekawa's progression is the inspirational backbone. She doesn't really *need* another story, but I'm hoping we get at least one more arc where she plays a key role before Monogatari comes to a close.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry this week's post was so late. I was busy today and completely forgot about it.  

I have to step out for a bit but this is one of my favorite arcs in the series so I hope ill have time to write up something when I get back.
>> ARTICLE
Out of everything in this entire series, I think that this arc might be my favorite, or second to the Kaiki arc of SS. The internal pressure and battles that Hanekawa tackles in this arc are just so incredibly done, and I feel like this arc is the biggest step of character development that anyone makes in the show. Hanekawa shows at the end of this arc that she is much more mature than any of the other characters by doing the right thing. She stands up to her parents, and she takes a step forward from being tied to Araragi. One of the reasons that I like SS so much is that it forces the show to dissolve the harem, truly coming into it's own as a story.
>> ARTICLE
Signed up instead of just lurking to reply to this one.

While this isn't my favorite arc (no Kaiki!), I enjoyed it quite a bit, and I liked the development for Hanekawa. To be honest, I never had a problem with her character before this arc, though I'll agree that it made her more likable. Though, having read Kizumonogatari (as well as I could, which involved stopping to look up unknown kanji and odd bits of grammar about ten times a page), I thought she was likable enough to begin with. [Kizu](/s "She was pretty dedicated to Araragi from the beginning of her friendship with him, though her early motives were... iffy.")

The way they are putting out the entire series in a manner that keeps the quality as amazing as it is is just plain incredible.

>For a lover of the monogatari series this is jaw dropingly amazing.

I know exactly what you mean. So much content! I feel so spoiled, and I also feel so sorry for friends who have other series as their favourite series that don't have nearly as much outlook for content.
>> ARTICLE
I was being somewhat sarcastic, but it's not like I'm dying of anticipation for the second season. There's so many great shows set for 2013 (and a few VNs that are very soon to be finished TLed that I want to play) that I won't have to worry.
>> ARTICLE
What VN's are expected to be finished next year? The only thing I'm really looking forward to is Fate/Hollow Ataraxia getting finished off but even that is looking doubtful. 
>> ARTICLE
I am sure Rewrite will finish within January at the rate that it's going, and that is the one I'm awaiting more than any other at the moment.

I had figured that it's likely F/HA would finish by the end of 2013 but it might take until 2014, depending on whether it sustains the current very slow rate.

I had a guess that Majikoi would finish in 2013 too because the routes for all the main girls seem to be finished or nearly so, but I don't really know how much is left.

It just started but Commie has already torn through a good bit of Mahoutsukai no Yoru, I would think they'd get that done in 2013 too.

Because Doki and Team Fluffy have teamed up to work on Little Busters EX at high priority and Sasami's route is already finished and a good part of Kanata's as well, I think it's likely that the EX patch will release in early 2013 too, but there's no guarantees.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the write up. Being a Type-Moon fag is suffering while waiting for Mahoutsukai no Yoru and F/H A to be translated. The other titles also look really great, particularly Little Busters EX which could be my motivation to dive into Key stuff.

Second season? Isn't Nisemono the second season?
>> ARTICLE
Basically the books are divided into 3 groups of novels with some falling into the first, second, and third seasons.  Kizu, Bake, and Nise are all first, Neko begins the second, and the third begins with Tsuki (thanks to Rek for the notice on my mistake). First and Second are done, while Tsuki is the only third out.  However by the time this all 26eps of the "second season's" anime is over the books will probably be all out, so they could launch theoretically into "season 3" animation process immediately if they so wished.
>> ARTICLE
Koi is actually the final book of the second season, it has Gahara-san on the front.

The third season actually begins with Tsuki, which is the latest book out. It has the girl-oddity that says "I said with a Posed Look" on the cover, if that helps. 
>> ARTICLE
novels Nekomonogatari and newer are called the second season
>> ARTICLE
Well that's messed up. There was a whole year between Bakemono and Nisemono and they're collectively supposed to be considered as one season. BRB

*throws logic out window*

There. Fixed.
>> ARTICLE
The first season of novels includes bake kise nise and neko kuro. 
>> ARTICLE
I await the day when logic gets automatically thrown out of the window for you by special robots. That way we can avoid these confusing things.
>> ARTICLE
Seasons refer to the Light Novels. The first season of light novels refers to Bake pt. 1 and 2, Kizu, Nise pt.1 and 2, and Neko black. 

The second season of light novels consist of all novels from neko white to koi. 

There is also a third season, of which only one book has been released. 

The reason that it seems confusing is because you're looking at the anime adaptions of these Light Novels, and their release dates and separation of content are very different to their novel counteparts.

Now go back and pick that logic up from where you threw it.

I guess that helps clears most of the issues, but I think that the logic should remain outside that window so it doesn't interfere with my head so much.

>> ARTICLE
No, I have seen this too somewhere. It was a side note in some bigger article.
>> ARTICLE
Every novel *of the second season*  (from nekowhite to koi) of -monogatari Light novels is getting adapted, which this article is talking about. 

While it hasn't been confirmed, if -monogataris keep making loads of cash and are popular, and noone important leaves, dies or refuses, you could reasonably expect the third and final season, consisting of Tsuki-, Owari- and Zokuowari- to get adapted too. 
>> ARTICLE
so wait with all the things being animated what will be left after?
>> ARTICLE
If you take into account everything that has been animated, and everything confirmed to be animated, you are left with only 3 Light Novels in the -monogatari series that have yet to have been animated or confirmed to be animated. 

These are the Third Season novels, consisting of Tsukimonogatari, Owarimonogatari and Zokuowarimonogatari. Of these 3 Light Novels, the only one that has been released so far is Tsukimonogatari, we just happen to know the titles of the yet-to-be-released final two books.

Thought I'd give the translation of the PV a go; been up a while so not even going to try and convert the nyaas into meows. :P

[Translation](/s "Text: And now, in the next *Monogatari*
Hanekawa: I'm a cat. / I'm not *evil*, I just *do* evil.
Hachikuji: Araragi-san! / I've been looking for you, Araragi-san!
Kanbaru: The Devil ... could be me, couldn't it?
Sengoku: I hate you, Koyomi-onii-chan!! / You lied ... even though you're a god.
Shinobu: Vampire Punch!!
Senjougahara: Someone who wishes to deceive us is here.")

As usual with PVs such as this one, the exact context is lost, so the quotes may be wrong and, as I've not read these novels, it could be wrong in some places. Plus, I'm not totally confident about the second Hanekawa line; anyone who could give a better example let me know! :)

I'd debate about the "good" part. Hence my comment.
>> ARTICLE
Instead of following the trend of downvotes, I'm actually going to ask why you think it isn't good. 
I'm curious.
>> ARTICLE
The bakemono series brought something new and interesting with its story telling style and dialogues, despite having similarities to SZS, it still managed to create a unique atmosphere. 

Nisemono tried to follow its elder brother steps but failed badly: Nothing new, boring dialoges, no character depth and progression(You'd be lying saying you'd fall for nisemono senjou/Hachikuji,shinobu, while the sisters are not even worth mentioning), no interesting story, in short it was dry and dull.

The extended fan service it offered was, in my eyes, just to cover the holes I mentioned earlier.

When you put all these together, you stop expecting something good.
>> ARTICLE
Well I would almost agree with several of your points, but I;d argue there were minor plot regressions in terms of Senjougahara's past, as well as learning more about Oshino's college club friends...I for one, liked Shinobu's characterization in this.


Though you're right about the fan service, that it was to cover the plot holes, and that Nise was definitely weaker than Bake. But I don't think there is a single person who would make the case for Nise being 'better' than Bake.


The reason I wouldn't give up on the Monogatari series because of Nise is because it's quite literally fan service the author wrote for himself. His publisher apparently had to prod him to let them release it. I have high hopes for the rest of the LN's as, I've heard they are leagues above Nise's story in terms of quality and plot progression. If it turns out they aren't , I will join you in your claims regarding this being a cow that is being milked. 
>> ARTICLE
Who knows, time will tell.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, plenty and it's delicious.
>> ARTICLE
I love that Shinobu basically has no idea what she is doing with time travel and is just making up shit as she goes along. The issues with time travel get too messy anyways, so fuck it.

Great episode. Looking forward to a new OP next week.
>> ARTICLE
I love time travel show but, do I really have to watch every season? Can I just start watching this and not need prior knowledge of anything?
>> ARTICLE
You have to watch original Bakemonogatari EP 3-5, the arc is pretty cool anyway. You would understand when you finish EP5.

Ideally you should watch it all because time travels always seem cooler when you know the backstory.
>> ARTICLE
Your right.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you do need to watch it all.
>> ARTICLE
Shucks, that's like what? 450 hours, Right?

What i did was number of episodes times 30 divided by 2.
>> ARTICLE
Episode run times are closer to 20-25 minutes each.

Bake is 15 episodes, Nise is 11, Neko:Kuro is 4. Plus the recent 6 episodes. 

36 episodes x 25 mins each = 900 minutes or 15-16 hours.

That sounds more about right. 450 hours is way too much...maybe you got minutes and hours mixed up?

EDIT: I cannot add.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it was exactly that; I mixed up the hours and minutes.

15 hours seems like a good 1 late night and early morning.
>> ARTICLE
Good luck :)
>> ARTICLE
If I recall, the light novel had many references but I think they were taken out because of copyrights. 


There was a line referencing to Doraemon and the time travel desk. Besides, Shinobu is old and she can't remember much in her loli mode. Her character is pretty important throughout Kabukimonogatari. The development that was made was beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Doraemon has been mentioned before in Bakemonogatari when Araragi was talking to Nadeko in Tsubasa Cat, they actually said Doraemon instead of making a pun.

Not sure what other references they cut out since I haven't read the LN, are you sure they were cut *because* of copyrights, or just cut because they weren't needed?
>> ARTICLE
I'm just glad Araragi was smart enough to at least ask about what type of time travel they used and appears genuinely cautious of paradoxes. I know I'd be having an anxiety attack in his shoes when she gave those answers.
>> ARTICLE
Thank god for genre savvy time travellers!
>> ARTICLE
hah, he wasn't smart enough to ask *before* the jump however.. in a way it reminded me of the chat he had with ougi. he was too used to having green lights from shinobu.. and now caution would've been the wiser choice.. aka red lights.
>> ARTICLE
~~There are four lights~~ There are three lights for traffic signals, the yellow one was intentionally left out. Green means go Red means stop. The one Ougi was hinting at was the yellow one **Caution**
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I think the traffic signals being referenced are for the crosswalk, not for cars.
>> ARTICLE
She calls them traffic lights, mentions them being horizontal which are the kind used in japan and it flashes images of the horizontal traffic lights while she's talking about it
>> ARTICLE
She says horizontal and vertical. I think it's just a weird way to refer to either street's traffic lights at the intersection (i.e. one is "horizontal", the other "vertical", and they meet perpendicularly).

Ougi looked way creepier than I thought she would...also she and Araragi pretty much went over a conversation Araragi had with Kanbaru in Nise(?),  Ougi went into much deeper detail though. I wonder how she's going to turn out.

This arc feels soooo much heavier than the previous one. And we're only on the first episode! There's quite a lack of Hachikuji, but a huge amount of mentioning. Hmm. I enjoyed this episode so much, especially because of the two weeks we had to wait for it. Was it worth it? Ehh I think so.

Anyways, I also thought Nobu-chan's nickname was adorable! Heh too bad Shinobu didn't agree so much. Finally a nice dose of Shinobu, I missed you, Nobu-chan!! I'm sure people are going to appreciate all of the lolis this arc.

Also I feel worth noting: The world feels like it's being more fleshed out this season. Its starting to feel more like a real world and less like a minimalistic art exhibit with actors.

I have a really good feeling about this arc. So I give this episode 5/5!, Thanks SHAFT for delivering! 

EDIT: I'll put up screen caps of the text shots if anyone wants to see them. Might take a bit.

EDIT: Gonna have to wait til fansubs come out for the screenies. :( Daisuki lowers the quality to shit tier for me when I start mashing away at the pause button, also the type face is ugly and set pretty badly. OP will deliver soon, hopefully!

The immediately noticeable lack of detail in her face and eyes is what really creeped me out. 

Her tone of voice and overall just the way she talked really made her seem sinister and condescending, but because of the way Araragi said she was probably only trying to teach him some [trivia](http://i.imgur.com/sQWXKqQ.jpg) (that he actually already knew), is probably only trying to [impress](http://i.imgur.com/F8oiVMC.jpg), and always brings trival subjects to [philosophical](http://i.imgur.com/a5yoZLN.png) matters, he ended up downplaying her character a whole lot. Araragi can be kind of naive, huh?

I expected her to be more subtle and look more innocent. I loved that she didn't come out as I expected. 
>> ARTICLE
I also find her extra long sleeves creepy, like she's hiding her hands.
>> ARTICLE
Day late on this one - its been a very busy weekend. Anyway. New arc today. Im assuming were back on Araragi (which Im kinda meh towards) and the arc is apparently about Hachikuji (also pretty meh towards), but this season has blown past my expectations so far, so Im just trying to come in at true neutral. Lets roll.

**Episode 7**

0:44 - [Clearly a face we can trust.](http://i.imgur.com/u7k6XL7.jpg)

1:07 - A three second pause... alright, Im just gonna let Isins dialogue do its own thing until pieces come together in a way that might make sense. The first arc of this season kind of spoiled me, but Im kind of used to thinking of this shows dialogue and its visuals as two separate shows that happen to run at the same time. So my notes will probably be a bit more me-focused (just jotting down details until they pull together), since Im not gonna pontificate on what I dont think I actually understand. So:

Traffic light metaphor. The pause where all motion is stopped, everywhere.

1:32 - If I designed the system, Id make sure the lights were never all green. Everyone prefers safe over dangerous.

1:41 - [Theyre really grinding in a very simple statement](http://i.imgur.com/v0DGJGW.jpg). Well need a couple more reflections to triangulate an actual point, though

1:51 - When the world is filled with green lights signaling safety, its more dangerous than anywhere.

Again, basically self-notes here. The show is highlighting and underlining this concept, so Ill want these statements written out to reference against

2:29 - Half the lights being green just means half the risk. If you want to be safe, dont cross sidewalks. Thats something more, since its actually nonsense, and a kind of dangerous nonsense too. Hm

3:34 - [Araragi, havent you realized yet you live in a world where half-baked semi-profundities always come back to bite you in the ass?](http://i.imgur.com/mCCSLhJ.jpg) Often literally, too

Nice shot there, by the way

4:11 - [This is gonna be fun](http://i.imgur.com/zS4M6sz.jpg)

5:01 - [Her design is so bizarre](http://i.imgur.com/elKsmCP.jpg). Like a non-anime fans' idea of an anime character. It definitely helps make her seem like some kind of creepy homunculus

5:21 - [Even if I didnt already know, itd be pretty easy to tell this is gonna be a Hachikuji story](http://i.imgur.com/ocnWdaV.jpg). All this crap mirroring Hachikujis life story and first arc. Isin can get so self-indulgent sometimes...

5:57 - [Thats awesome.](http://i.imgur.com/8LpDhfX.jpg) Im glad she finds that phase as embarrassing as I found it annoying

6:11 - [That is an incredibly good question](http://i.imgur.com/cBcqWy3.jpg)

7:08 - [I like how the absurd, empty-stage nature of their world makes this a pretty great gag](http://i.imgur.com/GrJP7Um.jpg)

8:12 - Hm. Why is Araragi so put off by her assumption that hes a human?

9:16 - [Must *every* plot element mirror another one, Isin?](http://i.imgur.com/dh1CJPs.jpg) Katanagatari is actually one of my all-time favorite shows, but in Monogatari I think he mixes it up too much between cute parallels and meaningful ones

9:28 - [This one seems more relevant](http://i.imgur.com/e9AcqWo.jpg). Professing resurrection in a story about another dead girl

10:21 - [Id like to see a map of this town of theirs](http://i.imgur.com/g1J1iw8.jpg)

10:36 - [Seriously, Id hire this urban planner in a second](http://i.imgur.com/olo2ddx.jpg)

11:06 - [Seems relevant](http://i.imgur.com/5BQWoCc.jpg)

12:42 - [Oh please.](http://i.imgur.com/k5yqfHn.jpg) Bring back Hanekawa!

14:07 - You know how I sometimes [complain about Isin using his characters as self-indulgent mouthpieces?](http://i.imgur.com/4lIWg7a.jpg) Well, I do, and Fuck This

14:47 - [It only makes sense.](http://i.imgur.com/L2YQdTv.jpg) Another distinctive shot

15:27 - Well [this episode escalated quickly](http://i.imgur.com/TKbEvzq.jpg)

18:01 - Manipulating Araragi 101: [Play to his hero complex](http://i.imgur.com/Fr1N0zL.png)

18:26 - She takes his watch, and then once he no longer has control of it, uses it to confirm his sense of time. Hm

19:53 - [I foresee no problems with this](http://i.imgur.com/isybouw.jpg)

20:25 - This conversation is actually awesome. Time travel is always nonsense, so going forward in time takes less energy, just like salmon! is pretty much par for the course

21:04 - And now hes actually trying to clarify whether he traveled through time physically or just adopted his old physical self. Youd think if he were this thoughtful about time travel, hed have asked maybe one or two of these questions before leaping through the giant scary time-gate

21:34 - Yeaah, she is being [super weird about this watch](http://i.imgur.com/z3ZIvrL.jpg)

22:04 - [This is extremely adorable](http://i.imgur.com/Ft5a2M2.jpg)

**And Done**

Welp, ya fucked around with time travel, what did you expect?

So I guess that answers the question of Hachikujis relevance. Are we actually right around her Time Of Death now? Eh, plot is details, lets talk about the craft.

This episode definitely leaned into some of my least favorite Isin-isms, mainly through the extremely cute plot mirroring and self-indulgent, character-irrelevant banter. The first half just felt clunky as hell, and Shinbou didnt really get much of a chance to strut his stuff as far as visual-plot-illuminating goes. Thats pretty much par for the course with Hachikuji stories, even though Hachikuji has yet to actually appear - there is no sexual charge to her and Araragis relationship, so the camera doesnt have all that much to talk about. The second half was a lot of fun though, mainly because Shinobu and Araragi have a very endearing buddy-cop dynamic, and because time travel is just loads of fun in general, and actually improved through the presence of genre-savvy characters. Definitely not as strong a start as the first arc, but obviously its going places.

-old posts are [here](http://wrongeverytime.com/)-
>> ARTICLE
As soon as Araragi started questioning the time travel I felt like Isin and Shinbou made this show specifically for my pleasure. It's an oft repeated joke amongst my friends that I can't enjoy anything with time travel because the rules are always so ill defined and nobody stops to puzzle them out. Here we have Araragi standing there grilling Shinobu on it before even bothering to figure out if it worked or not. Fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
>Id like to see a map of this town of theirs

On that note, has it actually been confirmed that the town in question is, in fact, not located in Africa?
>> ARTICLE
For all we know, Monogatari doesn't occur in a set date/year does it? The girls Araragi and Shinobu met in the new time didn't actually *say* what year it was to the audience, for all we know their town could be a neo-future Africa.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, who knows. From my experience with Nisio Isin's and Shinbou's work, sometimes even seemingly trivial things should not be assumed.

Not that it's really relevant, though. I fully expect Monogatari to say goodbye to all logic just to get some nice scenery.
>> ARTICLE
I think the Japanese just have a major hard-on for those trees, as soon as there's anything Africa related they contort everything to get a shot of those trees. Shinbou just cut out the middleman and said "fuck it, put em in."
>> ARTICLE
That seems to be Shinbou's modus operandi. "Does it look cool? Fuck it, throw it in."
>> ARTICLE
Usually he sticks to what's in the novel, but the parts that aren't he'll get creative with.
>> ARTICLE
One theory is that the tree is a reference to "surviving past your death".
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri
The Baobabs have ZERO animal species that spreads its seeds. It is proposed that animal species that used to eat its fruit and spread its seeds have been extinct for a long time. As such, it shouldn't have survived... But it is still here, barely. One similar species of tree lost its seed disperser, a turtle, only 200 years ago by human hunting.

They are alive, but barely.

Ok, that's so relevant that it can't be a coincidence.

Nice find.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if this is worth noting but isn't this the first time we were shown actual people from the -monogatari world? Other then the main ones of course.
>> ARTICLE
Ougi has her own arc in the third season of novels, and I in the novels she seemed to be much more important and I'm really curious as to why she wasn't actually given any real art.
>> ARTICLE
I think so? We saw Araragi's mom last arc, too, which I think is the first time we've seen a parent's face.
>> ARTICLE
It may actually be true that this is the first time they show someone other than the main cast (or anyone directly related to them) in the world. Also it's probably the first time said "faceless" characters are shown interacting and directly responding to the MCs.

I commented earlier saying it feels like they're making the ~monogatari world a little more real in a sense by doing this and showing more complete images of their surroundings. I can't wait for the blu-ray versions to come out, if the changes are as drastic and noticeable as they were in Nise and Bake, we're in for treat for this season.
>> ARTICLE
I've heard that Shaft made a lot of changes in BDs. Can you give some examples? This is the first -monogatari series I'm watching while it airs.
>> ARTICLE
[Here's](http://seventhstyle.com/2012/05/07/nisemonogatari-undergoes-major-edits/) a good place to see them.

Which reminds me, they need to hurry the hell up with the US BDs for Neko Black.

Oh man Shinobu, you fucked up BAD. Ougi looks alot more scarier than I imagined, I mean her eyes are pretty weird.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more Araragi's fault than hers. They mentioned both that Hachikuji had died around 10 years prior, and that he had been thinking about her when they jumped. I have a feeling he caused them to end up some time near her death, and are going to either prevent or cause it.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read past this in the Light Novels but I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Ougi is from the past that Araragi went to and he brought her back and named her just like Meme named Shinobu. Since the episode starts out in school but in the next scene Araragi says he's on summer break. Just my two cents.
>> ARTICLE
He also talks about how their conversation regarding traffic lights reminded him of a story about Hachikuji so that scene would have to take place after the time travel incident.

My totally unfounded guess, Ougi is some kind of paradox apparition that exists because they done fucked up the time stream.
>> ARTICLE
WTF I'm stunned, did this just turn into a time traveling show...
>> ARTICLE
It's just a jump to the left
>> ARTICLE
Or a head tilt to the right
>> ARTICLE
Well considering it's time traveled to earlier than we've ever seen can we say perhaps it's always been a time traveling show?

Don't do stuff like that to my head...

Oh god, Bioshock references everywhere
>> ARTICLE
I love those two.

EDIT: Crap, forgot I was browsing a two month old thread for a second. Sorry.
>> ARTICLE
So, having never read the LNs, but based off what i heard in this episode, i think this arc may be about possibly preventing or MAYBE accidentally causing, Hachikuji's death.

They said she had died about 10 years prior to when her arc happened, and the episode took place about 3-4 months after that. Not only that but he said he had been thinking of Hachikuji during the jump, so i'm betting it's his fault more than Shinobu's, and that they ended up near the day she dies because of it.
>> ARTICLE
Not really.  It is more about what happens to the present when you alter the past.

The book this episode based on is one of the more action filled books in the latter half of the series.  There will be way more action in this one than the episodes before.  Just wait and see.
>> ARTICLE
If this show wasn't complex enough, it now is.
>> ARTICLE
who's ougi?
>> ARTICLE
The girl that Araragi was talking to on the school stairs. Oshino Ougi.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't it get a little deeper than that? I mean I have no recollection of her in the previous series' other than her name includes Oshino.
>> ARTICLE
It does but even in LNs not much is revealed about her. The remaining LNs that haven't been published yet are the ones with her story so really everyone is being left in the dark about her. What is known about her really can't be revealed without spoilers anyways so you're better off just letting it be.
>> ARTICLE
It probably does get a lot deeper than that. What we just saw is all we know about her. I actually did make a prediction on who I think she is in another comment.
>> ARTICLE
When I started reading kabukimonogatari, it had also been the first time I knew of her. 
>> ARTICLE
Still waiting to see what her connection to Oshino Meme is. Could be interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Supposedly she is the niece of Oshino Meme.

It was briefly mentioned in one of the later books, I think.
>> ARTICLE
she gave him advice which if he would have taken to heart, he might have been more cautious about time-travelling such as asking all those questions to shinobu before they made the attempt.
>> ARTICLE
> Oshino Ougi.

but who exactly is she? i didn't see any introduction or anything from previous episodes
>> ARTICLE
She doesn't really ever get any. She's just suddenly a character and everyone acts like they've known her for a while. I was confused when reading the books and thought I'm missing something; apparently, everyone was.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah her story isn't out yet but is set to be released this year.
>> ARTICLE
This is her very first appearance. So nothing at all is known about her besides what you can infer. She's a student at Araragi's school, younger than him, most likely a first year, and may or may not be related to Oshino Meme.
>> ARTICLE
She isn't technically introduced for a few more novels I'm pretty sure, right?
>> ARTICLE
Yep. She does make another appearance, but she's not introduced formally until much later.
>> ARTICLE
that piano is fucking heavenly! I'll definitely be scouring for the OST
>> ARTICLE
That was a great episode; I enjoyed it more than most of the previous arc. I have to say that Ougi is a lot creepier than I was expecting.
>> ARTICLE
hah, it's those yandere eyes. they reminded me of ufotable's adaptation of ryougi shiki.. except she didn't get murderous, yet.
>> ARTICLE
No End Card this episode :(

Having not read the LNs I guess this arc will be about the cause of Hachikuji's death and hopefully explain who the hell Ougi is.
>> ARTICLE
There really isn't any gray area with her death I thought it was pretty well explained. Unless araragi drives the car that hits her I don't see how he could cause her death
>> ARTICLE
Love the new ED animation with the clock themes.

[Here's](http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/images/6/6d/Kabuki-000a.jpg) the Light Novel cover for this arc (as animated at 4:04). [This](http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/images/f/f5/Kabuki-008.jpg) is the sort-of sad insert illustration. 

I'm a little confused. Chronologically, when is Araragi speaking to this Ouji person? Is it to be assumed to be AFTER the events we are currently witnessing with Shinobu and Araragi? As in, his conversation with her has sparked the memories of him recalling those events? Please avoid spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to say it's after the events we are currently witnessing and also after the tiger incident. Consider the fact that he's in school ~~now~~ while he's having that conversation with her so it only makes sense.

Edit: Clarification
>> ARTICLE
Oh duh, I didn't consider the fact that they were in school. Thanks.

I took a peek at the timeline, and it's very confusing... so I'm just going to ride it out. Wish the books past Neko: White were translated. 
>> ARTICLE
Here's the chronology of these two arcs and the fourth arc of this season which also happens around the same time. Don't worry, no spoilers.
[](http://imgur.com/cLSegu9)
>> ARTICLE
Oh, awesome, thank you!
>> ARTICLE
The conversation happens before the events with Shinobu and Araragi. The arc starts a bit before/barely the same time as the previous arc (Snail girl looking for her bagpack), but finishes before it ended (because Araragi appeared in the last episode of that arc).

EDIT: The fact that he's going back one day to do the homework because school starts the next day proves it happens during the previous arc /this from the novel. didn't see the episode yet)
>> ARTICLE
You and awpaca have conflicting answers. If this is due to some time-based spoilers, please don't tell me.
>> ARTICLE
what i wrote was based on the stuff that happens before they doing the time travel. at least in the novel Shinobu uses the excuse of being last day of summer break and having the homework unfinished to convince Araragi to go one day back. The previous arc started when the school started. It even had that ceremony they have at the beginning of every year iirc.
>> ARTICLE
Kabuki happens before Neko:White and Oni, which occur simultaneously
>> ARTICLE
Going by the first few lines of the novel and the fact that she's wearing a winter uniform: about 3 months after Kabuki and Neko White.
>> ARTICLE
Oh Shinobu messed up hasn't she
>> ARTICLE
It was Araragi who lead them to that time period because he was thinking about Hachikuji and her death.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that the implication was that Araragi messed up by thinking about how to talk to Hachikuji while stepping through the gate instead of about the previous day
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow that makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
nonsense, she has never failed once in her life! [everything is according to keikaku](http://i.minus.com/iGB2cs9vG7ECl.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Can someone tell if they went 11 years into the future or 11 into the past. It got really confusing in the end....
>> ARTICLE
Interesting that the author had to avoid mentioning the precise year, as he hasn't given an actual fixed real life date for his stories.
>> ARTICLE
It was 11 years into the past
>> ARTICLE
Thank you so much. The translation I watched said:

>They said it was eleven years ago from today, or well, what is now the future.

I was sure they had gone 11 years into the future until I started reading this thread. Then I just got hopelessly confused.
>> ARTICLE
What they meant with that line is that they went 11 years to the past from the day they stepped into the portal, and that day when they stepped in is now the future.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I see that now, but it was really hard to understand exactly what they meant when all I had to go by was that single line. I just found the wording to be extremely confusing. I think it would have made a lot more sense if they had used "prior to" in place of "ago from". Also, combining that with changing the last part of the sentence from "what is now the future" to "what *was* now the future".

>They said it was eleven years prior to today, or well, what was now the future.

Instead of

>They said it was eleven years ago from today, or well, what is now the future.


But, whatever.
>> ARTICLE
No fanservice this time?
>> ARTICLE
With the emphasis on Shinobu and Hachikuji this arc, I really *really* hope not.
>> ARTICLE
For all his "molestation" jokes they rarely, if ever, sexualize those two in the same way they do for characters like Kanbaru or Senjou. I think it's indicative of his honestly platonic feelings towards both of them, the show only sexualizes a character if A) Araragi's gaze is controlling the camera (Senjou, Hanekawa, Kanbaru fanservice) or a character is intentionally using their sexuality either as a personality trait or to try to attract Araragi (Kanbaru as personality trait, Nadeko as seduction). The two lolis aren't the target's of Araragi's gaze (and therefore not the camera's) and neither of them wants to be sexualized in that manner. The result is a pretty fair treatment of them.

The groping thing is just Araragi being a huge pain in the ass because he knows it bugs her.
>> ARTICLE
>The two lolis aren't the target's of Araragi's gaze

[hah](http://24.media.tumblr.com/9c2bc815c7727e3aa3e823ad1739d88e/tumblr_mqhgsxJaxD1s706yxo1_400.gif), might not be sexualized but there's a ton of fabulous molestation going on with hachikuji. he wouldn't dare with kiss-shot though.

Unless were talking adult Shinobu.

Of course. Sexy grown-up Kisshot is cool in my book.

Araragi jumped through the gate and they ended up tumbling down the shrine steps

Well that explains it. I feel dumb for letting that go over my head haha.

Weird how Shinobu carries extra bandaids but then again...could it be that they're just extra 'panties'?

^^^hmm...

[So who's bill and who's ted?](http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh636/Orangespike/Billted.png)

On a serious note, I think Ougi was trying to prevent just such a situation from occurring. Something about people being given a green light and crossing the street like they have divine protection.  




>> ARTICLE
The scenes with Ougi seem to take place after the time travel incident since he seems to be "remembering" the whole thing, as evidenced by his opening monologue.
>> ARTICLE
I think Araragi is Ted because he actually has something to lose for not doing the homework, military school/Senjyogahara's scolding, oddly similar in a way
>> ARTICLE
And I believe it is the exact opposite. Because you have to consider what Ougi's words actually DID to Araragi's mind.
>> ARTICLE
he dismissed them as nothing more than attention grabbing and wanting to impress him via trivia about 3 second lag in intersection lighting
>> ARTICLE
That's not what Araragi did. That's what he THINK he did.
>> ARTICLE
i love Hitagi Senjougahara but i want some Nadeko Sengoku. also this ep was awesome, it reminds me of the relationship in dance in the vampire bund, in the end no matter what Araragi will end up with shinobus bc they can't die 
>> ARTICLE
We'll get more Nadeko next arc, no worries!
>> ARTICLE
thank you because there's something about her i like. i like Nadeko Sengoku, Hitagi Senjougahara and Shinobu Oshino the best, their just my type but Tsubasa Hanekawa is fine too
>> ARTICLE
Well, I didnt see that one coming. Interesting episode, oh Shinbou you gone done goofed
>> ARTICLE
Suddenly, time travel. 

But seriously though, great episode. I'm looking forward to this arc, finally get to see a lot more Shinobu. 
>> ARTICLE
lmao i thought this ougi person was hanekawa and they just made her look weird because she was speaking as if she had a new personality
>> ARTICLE
From this episode, it may or may not be obvious, but I guess that they're going to interact with Hachikuji before her death somehow, so that she wouldn't become a ghost later, since they went back 11 years, and Hachikuji died 10 years ago
>> ARTICLE
Just curious but will Monogatari Series: Second Season go all the way down to Koimonogatari? Because the summary I read was really interesting.

I think it does. But they took out Hanamonogatari if that means anything.

It's okay you messed up Shinobu! We still think you're adorable. <3

For anyone wondering, here's a plot synopsis of this arc:

[Spoilers for this arc](/s "Araragi Koyomi and Oshino Shinobu decided to time travel back in time so Araragi can do his homework. They accidentally go back 11 years ago using up the remaining spirit particles at the shrine from Nadeko Snake. In their adventure, Koyomi saves Hachikuji Mayoi from the car accident that killed her. When they returned to the present, they discover the world has changed drastically as a consequence of what Koyomi have done. Now they have to find an alternate way to get back to their original world.")
>> ARTICLE
Erm. Might want to put that in spoilers... 
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, I didn't think it was. It doesn't really give anything away but alright, I will.
>> ARTICLE
"doesn't really give anything away"

"plot synopsis"

durrr?
>> ARTICLE
Nothing major, obviously. It's not like it's super detailed hence, why it is a synopsis.

Unless you don't know what synopsis means of course.
>> ARTICLE
This, children, is why you shouldn't change anything in the past when time traveling. 
>> ARTICLE
This is the episode where we have conformation that Araragi has... issues. Issues that could get him arrested.
>> ARTICLE
You mean him publicly molesting Hachikuji wasn't enough confirmation?
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't public, not until now. You know, selective ghosts. And this is the first time we see him molesting two complete strangers.
>> ARTICLE
He didn't molest anyone in this episode. He only flipped Hachikuji's skirt up to see her panties. Unless he goes a bit further in the LN's?

He held himself back with loli Hanekawa though, but I'm sure he was molesting them both in his mind. 
>> ARTICLE
>*didn't molest anyone*

>*only flipped Hachikuji's skirt up to see her panties*

Phew, much better.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just surprised he didn't track down shenjougahara and molest her. I expected pokemon except with molestation. 
>> ARTICLE
*Gotta assault 'em all*
>> ARTICLE
I was really scared that Araragi's saviour instincts would take over and we would see him simultaneously trying to save all the girls, only realizing afterwards that by saving them, he would sever his relationships with them in the future.
>> ARTICLE
That would be a fairly cruel twist, if *he* turned out to be the cultist that molested her.
>> ARTICLE
She's a ghost though so it didn't matter all that much, but because he did it with a real girl....it's ***absolute*** confirmation!! 
>> ARTICLE
Shinobu also seemed very *interested* in Shota Araragi, like master like servant I guess..
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that as well.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like he's rubbing off on [Shinobu](http://i.imgur.com/Jz3MGXc.gif).

What Araragi thinks next in the off panels pretty much sets the scene for the rest of his lolicon shenanigans in this episode.

don't worry. [Araragi is still the master.](http://i.imgur.com/xcnSSMR.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Favorite part of the whole episode just because of Shinobu's face. 
>> ARTICLE
"World was annihilated", I was like. "DAFUQ", so basically a little girl saves the world. I'm feeling another Movie to see Mayoi in action.
>> ARTICLE
Hell, I would've liked to have seen this arc made into a movie and Kizu made into something like Nekomonogatari: Black. Either way it works...
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to the back story behind Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade more than Mayoi.

>> ARTICLE
nah, its probably got nothing to do with Hachikuji, its because he scared Hanekawa, which made her lose faith in the world, so she turned her intellect towards destroying it, obviously it wouldn't take her anything like 11 years to destroy the planet
>> ARTICLE
I'm betting it's more "annihilated" in an absolutely NOTHING recognizable about it. All the friends he had probably don't know him anymore, their house isn't there/they moved, basically everything that COULD have changed DID change. otherwise how would they be able to get back to fix it, right?

hopping, deformed vampires which infect their victims with a "jiangshi virus" that spreads the jiangshi-ism. The ending theme has the big crowds of bodies, which is the initial thing that's turned me on to the idea.
>> ARTICLE
>A jiangshi (chiang-shih in WadeGiles), also known as a Chinese "hopping" vampire or zombie, is a type of reanimated corpse in Chinese legends and folklore. 

First line in the wiki, yo. 
>> ARTICLE
I could see that with Senjougahara since they had that entire experience from the park. With the rest, I guess Mayoi could have effected them somehow with interacting with Araragi.
>> ARTICLE
Actually i was thinking more along the lines of him somehow never even MEETING them in the first place in the "new world", maybe they meet Mayoi instead since she's about their age, and it changes the entire history of who is friends with who. 

Hell, maybe it's as much as Mayoi and Hanakawa become friends somehow, and because of that she never gets the chance to save Araragi, so he never saves/redeems/whatever  Shinobu, who never saves Hanekawa on her first big "outing" as Black Hanekawa, and it just devolves from there.

That's the funny thing with time travel and the Butterfly Effect, ENDLESS possibilities.
>> ARTICLE
You lost me man, this Butterfly Effect seems like a bitch.
>> ARTICLE
Basically having saved Hachikuji, EVERY possible relationship Araragi had has the potential to change drastically, and a few in ways that may kill off fairly important people.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, she was an apparition for about 11 years. I'm pretty sure that was enough time to fuck with some people. 
>> ARTICLE
Lolis. Loli's everywhere in this episode. 

Ahem, I feel like the show suddenly picked up the pace so much, but I guess that has to do with them shortening all the arcs down to 4 episodes. We're progressing quickly now, aren't we? Also we got the [new OP](http://i.imgur.com/fzN9b7I.jpg)! I don't really like it as far as the song goes but the style is nice. It's so much less upbeat than Kaerimichi, Hachikuji's first OP.

A few of my thoughts:

We open with Araragi still doubting Shinobu, but [of course](http://i.imgur.com/H52RPN7.png) we can go back to our time! Never doubt Nobu-chan, even if she doubts herself! 

Then we see...little Araragi?! Well, [Shinobu](http://i.imgur.com/HztWYkC.png) isn't too different from Koyomi it seems. As /u/ShadowZael put it, like master like servant I guess...

Araragi's [Hero's syndrome](http://imgur.com/a/5oHsl#0) is kicking in here. It's nice to see he was thinking of Gahara-san first. Also worth noting is how Shinobu is actually aware of how changing one thing can affect many people, apparently the message didn't seem to get through to Araragi.

Araragi spots his [prey](http://imgur.com/a/q93li#0). Don't scare your food, Araragi! We sure are getting a nice fill of loli's this arc (not to mention all of those loli Hanekawa poses...whoa there Shaft). It's too bad Shinobu had to pay for Araragi's inability to contain himself. I must admit, Nobu-chan [getting hit](http://i.imgur.com/4UzMt8E.jpg) was one of the funniest and cutest things I've ever seen of her. She sure does put up with it well.

And then we see [this](http://i.imgur.com/L08xeXe.jpg). She looks...kinda....like someone...I just can't quite put my finger on it... 

But is it me or does Ararararagi have some weird Hanekawa fetish or something? Well actually it seems he has a lot of complexes and fetishes. I shouldn't be too surprised.

So that's that. This episode felt like it progressed so fast. We spent only one episode in the past, as much as I would've liked to have seen them spend more time there, I guess there really wasn't much to do. Right off the bat they jump into their objective and go only a little astray, which I found weird because when it comes to ~monogatari, the shit-foraging level is usually super fucking high. This episode actually had a lot of progression, which can be both a good and a bad thing. I enjoyed it though, so really I'm not complaining. I'd been looking forward to seeing 6 year old Araragi and Hanekawa. Can't wait for next week's episode of the desolate town.

EDIT: [Bonus shot](http://i.imgur.com/XK9SvEH.jpg) of Araragi's true pervertedness because I missed it the first time. 
>> ARTICLE
Read the light novel for all the shit foraging that got cut out. There are quite a few gems like Araragi's developing collarbone fetish. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's fully translated yet, is it? I've only read the ones that are entirely translated and some super brief summaries of Oni and Koi. It seems like a lot of the books aren't translated yet so I haven't tried digging for them.

Araragi's developing collarbone fetish though...weird, but it seems as though we share a fetish now, haha.
>> ARTICLE
Arararararagi has the motherload of fetishes

There's nothing wrong with having a Hanekawa-sama fetish.

I concur, as I have an affinity for her haha. 
>> ARTICLE
> But is it me or does Ararararagi have some weird Hanekawa fetish or something? Well actually it seems he has a lot of complexes and fetishes. I shouldn't be too surprised.

You should read the light novel where he breaks into a long-winded, heavy prose about Hanekawa's panties from that first scene in Bakemonogatari at the traffic lights.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh no, I did read it. It slipped my mind when I wrote that haha.
>> ARTICLE
"Without wanting to, I let out a gasp.
The front part of Hanekawa's slightly long, ten-centimeter below the knee pleated skirt was completely flipped up.
Normally, she would immediately push it down by reflex  but the timing was kind of bad, and both her hands were behind her back, and they were still working on the complex task of fixing her braid. Watching from my position, it looked as if she was putting on a slightly cool pose, with her hands wrapped behind her head. That's what it looked like.
That was the situation when her skirt was flipped up.
Everything under it became completely visible.
It was by no means something flashy -- however it was such elegant underwear that the eye captivated by it wasn't allowed to turn away.
It was a clean pure white.
It wasn't suggestive at all, the coverage area was actually quite large. It was the full coverage kind with thick fabric  absolutely nothing lascivious, and in that regard one could say it lacked sexiness.
However, I could feel the dazzling radiance of that extreme whiteness.
And it was not plain at all.
A complex design made with white thread over a white background was embroidered in the center part of it  for all I know there were flowers on it. That pattern, symmetric on the left and right sides, exquisitely made up the balance of the whole underwear. And the central top part of the embroidery was decorated with a small ribbon.
That ribbon further intensifies the impression of it all.
Furthermore, right above that small ribbon, her abdomen and quite a lovely belly button was visible. The skirt was so boldly flipped up that even such parts became unbecomingly exposed. You could even see the blouse's hem clearly showing tucked inside the skirt. I never thought the hem of a blouse could be so lascivious until now.
Well, the skirt's lining for me was a new thing. Despite me happening to see them, often, they were an inviolable unknown entity. For the first time I think I've understood the structure of the clothing you call a skirt.
And best of all, it was just beautiful that only the front part of a skirt was flipped up.
The pure white of the underwear, and, as if boasting a competition with that whiteness, her plump thighs, were emphasized by the contrast with the deep blue of the skirt in background, and stood out. The skirt, quite long compared to that of an ordinary girls, in this situation was like a curtain that highlighted an elegant work of art. The pleats in the pleated skirt also seemed as if they were velvet.
Considering her pose with her hands wrapped behind her head, it seemed as if she were boasting her underwear to me -- that was the end result for her.
She.
Hanekawa Tsubasa, in the end, didn't move an inch.
She was dumbfounded.
Her facial expression froze, while she remained in that pose, as the skirt flipped up.
I think it all happened in the space of a second.
But, I felt as if it were an hour  I felt like I was seeing a hallucination, where it was as if my life could be coming to an end. It is by no means an exaggeration, I experienced a whole life in a moment.
To the point where the surface of my eyeballs would dry.
The lower part of her body had stolen a glance from me.
Well, of course I understand  of course I understand that in this situation it would be proper courtesy to quietly look away.
Normally even I would have done so.
If I were going up the stairs and a girl were in front of me, I'd at least have the mental focus to look at my own feet.
However, I wasn't as perfect as a man to do so on the spot against this blessing which suddenly swoop down on me without any mental preparation.
It seemed as if Hanekawa's figure was burned into my retinas.
If I happened to die right now, and someone happened to implant themselves with my eyes, they'd hallucinate about Hanekawa's underwear for the rest of their lives.
That was how much of an impact it was.
An honors student's underwear."

I said I did read it though.

I hadn't, and my life has now been improved for having read it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I think at some point in the light novel series, Araragi spends eight whole pages just talking about panties and even jokes about wasting so many pages on it too.

I think it was in Neko:Kuro when he's first discussing his feelings towards Hanekawa with Tsukihi, but I'm not sure.

He really has a thing for panties.
>> ARTICLE
He really is the best
>> ARTICLE
Wrong username, its Zael :)

Edit:

>But is it me or does Ararararagi have some weird Hanekawa fetish or something?

If you remember from Neko:Kuro, when Araragi is questioning whether he is in love with Hanekawa or not, he concludes that he is not in love with her, as he put it, it "was only lust".
>> ARTICLE
I stuttered. >.>

Haha, thanks for letting me know, I'll fix it. :)

EDIT: Ahh that's right, I don't think it 'was' though because it seems like he still his lusting after her. So it's more like 'it is only lust'.
>> ARTICLE
Tsukihi was the one who concluded that araragi was in lust with Hanekawa. In the classroom scene though he completely confirms it as being love not lust, saying his love for her is too much to the point of obsession. Oshino even says it at the end that there are things people can and can't say like araragi's feelings for Hanekawa. He puts on a front of only liking her for her body, even if it is partially true. He can keep telling himself that he doesn't really love her even though he does, he was trying really hard to deny what the cat was saying about her loving him in Bake.

Hanekawa is Araragi's Idol, in her personality looks and everything. He really hurt her in Neko though because he couldn't accept all of her and only wanted the facade. In the last part of his confrontation in Neko black when he is repeating what he said about everything being alright and Hanekawa saying it isn't. You can see he understands how much he's hurting her by trying to push his idol image on her. 
It's a parallel to the way Hanekawa treats Araragi, like he's a hero that she can push all of her problems onto and he can just take it because he's a knight in shining armor. He obviously can't seeing that he basically tried to kill himself because he couldn't take it.

They could have been lovers, but he's with Hitagi now. Maybe things could have turned out differently and maybe they'll break up in the future and he'll hook up with Hanekawa, **but the past has already happened and you can't change that.**




>> ARTICLE
Or in this arc's case, you can but you really shouldn't. 

In the end, Hanekawa and Araragi can't be. Like you put it, they were pushing their image of each other on each other and because of that there was a huge backlash. First by (again like you put it) Araragi repeatedly saying everything is alright and even before that when he's telling her to please say "I don't know everything, I only know what I know." and second by Hanekawa asking "Won't you be my hero?"  and "Won't you have any sympathy for me?" They sort of denied each other right there, really. 

Of course there will still be an air of tension between them and I think I'm ok with that. Besides that, I feel like I'm more content with Araragi and Gahara together. 
>> ARTICLE
There's also that time when Ararararagi said that he's dating Senjougahara, loves Hanekawa, and Hachikuji is the one he will marry.

Hmmm how confusing. Daisuki calls this episode 8 which counts the recap as #6. Commie is calling it #7 which doesn't count the recap. 

Does anyone know what the *official* episode number is (if there is one)?

Edit: Seems the [official site](http://www.monogatari-series.com/2ndseason/special/index.html) is calling is #8. 

Edit 2: Is there any way to check the Voice Actor credits to confirm whether or not that was Koyomi's mom in the police station? I feel like it was implied, but I'd like to be sure.

wait, does that mean, that Commies #7 is actually this 8th episode?

...just checked that out, it does. Oh shit, how an I supposed to orientate in that? What am I supposed to feed to MAL?

Just say you watched the 6th and add +one to whenever you watch Commie. Commie is definitely "wrong", as weird as it is to consider a recap an episode.

So, Araragi and Shinobu, time travelling buddy cops trying to find their way back to the future. Or, as various people have pointed out, simply waiting for the future to happen on its own, since technically neither of them actually age. But wouldnt that result in double Araragis and double Shinobus? I guess they could always just wait until present day again and then kill their doppelgangers or wait, no, they dont have to, they can just wait until the extra ones (not extra technically, just them in the future-past) head back in time. And that works whether this is a new timeline or simply a point in the past on the original one. Problem solved!

I like time travel.

**Episode 8**

1:03 - [Baiting Kizu once again.](http://i.imgur.com/GUQJsyM.png) KyoAni have some competition in the troll olympics

1:56 - [These two have a great dynamic.](http://i.imgur.com/m9Pn89Z.png) Actually, most of the characters in this show have a pretty decent rapport, outside of Nadeko I guess. One of the many things that makes this a harem-but-not-really - I mean, structurally it *is* a harem (well, more of a supernatural/psychological thriller in a harem shell), and everybody pretty much loves Araragi, but almost all the conversations are an even back-and-forth based on friendship, not romantic tension. In fact, many conversations seem to possess *sexual* tension but *not* romantic tension, which is much more rare in anime, or at least rarely done in a way that isnt just fetishizing a character for the sake of the audience. And legitimately good banter is a precious thing.

3:37 - Eh, lesser OP. I wonder if well get another Platinum Disco?

4:01 - [For the plot to work, obviously. Thats how time travel always works](http://i.imgur.com/FLzkvsA.jpg).

Incidentally, holy fuck does getting precise screencaps suck in this damn stream.

5:23 - Yeah, because saving a little girl 11 years ago isnt going to affect anything else. Araragi is [not a very good time traveler](http://i.imgur.com/47Ou4jb.jpg). Then again, if anyone ever was, time travel stories would be exceedingly boring

5:56 - [Goddamnit Araragi](http://i.imgur.com/5KfLWuT.jpg). For someone who was expressing questions of parallel timelines an episode ago, you sure are flippant about making massive shifts to the course of peoples lives. His martyr complex is not gonna do history any favors

6:13 - [I cant believe Shinobu is the one talking sense into him](http://i.imgur.com/z2r4OQl.jpg)

7:19 - [Yes. This is how the butterfly effect works](http://i.imgur.com/MHJTfOY.jpg)

7:36 - [This makes no sense literally,](http://i.imgur.com/Fnctmst.jpg) so I have to assume were digging at the theme of this arc. Much like that first conversation about red versus green lights. Which works well with Hachikujis existence as an apparition, an eternal red light who can never proceed. Not that theyll necessarily take it there, but Isin tends to scatter a whole lot of relevant Lego pieces, so I generally just poke pieces into each other until they seem to fit

8:57 - [Goddamnit you two stawp](http://i.imgur.com/huHAavh.jpg)

9:59 - [Loli Hanekawa](http://i.imgur.com/eG7QIyd.jpg). We have jumped the shark

10:18 - Man, Shinbou and his sweet visual gags. A montage of street signs to simulate the experience of rolling down the street. Nice

11:04 - [Youre fired. Youre fired. Everyones fired](http://i.imgur.com/813IuFh.jpg)

12:36 - If you want to stop being mistaken for a pervert, you should stop being such a goddamn pervert, Araragi

12:38 - This entire episode is just [fanservice of Araragi and Shinobu being adorable together](http://i.imgur.com/mVbXqhp.jpg). THEYVE FOUND MY WEAKNESS

13:15 - [Very nice](http://i.imgur.com/njQSb4e.jpg)

13:44 - Everyone involved is enjoying this arc [far too much](http://i.imgur.com/cIUGKYv.jpg). New team: also fired

16:26 - [Our hero](http://i.imgur.com/vqdAFBF.jpg)

16:46 - Yes, Araragi. By all means, convince her youre no one suspicious

17:52 - This is such an [insane changeup](http://i.imgur.com/ZRG2hFn.jpg) from the last arc. But I guess Hanekawa arcs are heavy psychological drama, and Hachikuji arcs are pretty close to straight comedy

21:46 - I [love the shrines color scheme](http://i.imgur.com/sRiKaWK.jpg)

**And Done**

Oh jeez, saving a life fucked up the entire present. WOOPSIE-DAISY ARARAGI. Goddamnit. You cant express some understanding of time travel dynamics and then BREAK THE ONE FUCKING RULE OF TIME TRAVEL. Jesus. What am I gonna do with these kids

at 7:36 that was shinobu discussing variants of destiny compensating for timetravel. . similar to, let's say... the Final Destination movies: preventing something to occur just postpones the inevitable.

another variant of destiny's grip on events was mentioned as they were chasing Hachikuji since they might have inadvertedly ended up being the cause of her death.


it wasn't the case as we're back to Butterfly Effect.. but it was worth the mention as discourse i suppose. 
>> ARTICLE
True, I guess that was a run on the old 'destiny cannot be prevented' shtick. But that's a much sillier idea than the butterfly effect, so I'm happy to be back.
>> ARTICLE
I think Destiny was a green light. Basically a way for people to say, "Well everything is predetermined so there's no way I can screw things up.". "It's my destiny" "I'm destined to do this" "It was fated" and like Ougi said **people walk across the street with a green light like they've got god's protection** 
>> ARTICLE
I am of the opinion that the saying the world is annihilated was an overstatement, it's very unlikely the 11 years in the future world will be some apocalyptic mess, would be surprised if they pulled that. I am thinking that because Hachikuji was saved, it indirectly cut Araragi's ties to all the other girls, so none of them are close to him anymore.
>> ARTICLE
>I am of the opinion that the saying the world is annihilated was an overstatement,

Nope. The name of the arc is an actual clue about whats going to happen. 
>> ARTICLE
It really is not an overstatement.

Shit is about to hit the fan next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Really? Did Mayoi cause WW3 by somehow becoming the secret lover of several leaders of military superpowers? That's the only scenario I can come up with.

I guess I'll know next week but for now it just feels ridiculous that Mayoi's survival doomed the whole world. Even butterflies have their limits.
>> ARTICLE
It'll makes sense. Hint: It has to do with something that happened in Bake.

Mayoi Jiangshi is the name of the arc, you need to google what Jiangshi means.

I read it, no regret. I loved it.

Yeah that wouldn't be cool but, I think it would be kinda neat. Ya know, give us this whole big story about these two characters and then at the end show how they met? I'd almost say it would be worth it. But yeah, I ended up reading Kizu durring school one time.
>> ARTICLE
It's a nice thought, but we'd have to wait for the rest of the series to be animated to completion(not even the novels are done) else it's no different than Kizu being released this fall. It would still be before the finish.

I'm projecting here. I just want my movie :D
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I really want to see it to. I was just kinda speculating a-bit.

[joke from oni, not a plot spoiler](/s "There's a point where Shinobu starts complaining about her arc not being adapted yet and so she decides to spend the rest of the novel talking about it and araragi ends up having to shut her up.")

Not sure if spoiler but just in case;[](/s "it just shows how much closer Shinobu and Araragi are getting, doesn't further the plot much. Still, it was a great scene along with many others.") 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, okay. Yeah the fact that they were becoming closer was a bit obvious, hell even as early as Nise. At this point it seems like Shinobu is just pretending to not care/actively dislike him just to keep up appearances and maintain her pride.
>> ARTICLE
So many lolis. A true lolicon's dream come true! Plus Shinobu as a Jr. High school student is so moe. I hope figures will be made of this. 

Ararararagi and Shinobu travel back in time to save Hachikuji, but it turns out there was a bit more to her story than "she was visiting her mom on mother's day." She ran away from home on mother's day, which leads me to believe her father wasn't going to take her to see her mom. Even though the divorce was mutual, that doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't not ugly, especially when it came to custody battles. 

Shinobu briefly mentioned her potential betrayal of Araragi before they opened up the gate and jumped in. When she took Araragi's hand her usual green bracelet was orange instead. Was that the first indication of the time lines diverging, or a foreshadow of her potential betrayal?

It'll be interesting to see how the saving Hachikuji led to the end of the world. 
>> ARTICLE
Did Shinobu actually become a middle school girl through her powers or did she just dress as one?

>> ARTICLE
It seemed like she was just dressing as one, since when they started running and her school uniform flew off she was at her original loli-size. I don't know for sure though.
>> ARTICLE
Jr. High Shinobu figure? If such a thing were to ever be made it would be worthy of being my first ever figurine purchase! We can always hope.

I think this is how Shinobu and Araragi's "contract" became severed, if you recall when Sawari Neko was talking to Shinobu before, she said that they had become separated.

>> ARTICLE
It might be because this is the start of a new arc and not the climax. But that's just my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
After the last arc, a lot of people decided they were going to wait until each full arc was completed to watch and discuss it I think. It's a pretty logical thing to do if you think about it, but I'd still like to see more people discuss the episodes like they did with the first arc.

I also agree that this was one of the funniest I've seen since Nise. I feel like Nise held some of the funniest and most shocking moments of the entire series.

Seeing as this arc is called Mayoi Jiangshi, I don't think that is an amazing predication.

I have no idea what that means, but nobody ELSE seemed to get it either, or if they did, bothered mentioning it. In fact, even if i DID know what that meant, it would have no bearing on guessing that he would save her from being hit by a truck.

Sort of, she got hit the first time while crossing at a green light. This time she almost got hit crossing when it was still red. So he almost caused her to get hit at a different time than she would have originally

Damnit Araragi, you really fucked up this time, should have been aware of the Butterfly effect.

Also, I am pretty sure the woman they asked for directions was [Izuko](http://myanimelist.net/character/87115/Izuko_Gaen) the same chick we saw in episode 4. It seems she didn't age whatsoever.

I was thinking it was Momaragi, they were at a police station (his parents job) and she was giving him almost a look of recognition.

I agree. Her eyes looked the same too. If that was indeed Mamaragi, it seems they are continuing with the Senjougahara-Mamaragi similarities--I mean, that was a lot of colored pencils!
>> ARTICLE
Same here. We know how much they like to avoid extras in this series..
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that was a look of recognition, I think that was a look of suspicion because a high school kid just told her that he's friends with a fifth grader.
>> ARTICLE
This seems far more likely, I guess if they had shown the hair antennae we would have known for certain (did they?).

Nope, she did have black hair and they didn't show all of her face which is what they did when they showed momaragi before.
>> ARTICLE
They skipped all the fun parts. I'm disappointed. Neko White didn't have too much cut, but the pacing in it seemed a little too slow. Maybe this was the right decision, but it still hurts.
>> ARTICLE
They cut all of the rest of the arcs short by one episode and replaced Hanamonogatari (Kanbaru's arc that was cut from the entire series) with those recap episodes. If we hadn't had that one recap episode, Kabuki would have been 5 episodes long and the others would all be 5 episodes as well with one arc having 6 episodes for a total of 26 episodes. I think its still unclear whether this season is going to be 24 or 26 episodes long though, but it's a sure thing that there will be more recap episodes to come. :(

>> ARTICLE
Now when he says annihilated.. does he mean no Senjougahara-annihilated? Cause then I'd be totes sad. 

Besides that, when I say Mayoi at the map in the park again and Shinobu pointing out that she had been there for an extended period of time, I thought she was dead already, but thanks Araragi for the push that made me think otherwise.

It was quite eventful, saw Shota-Araragi, Loli-Hanekawa was de best thing ever, and Mayoi in her known form. I was hoping to see an adult Mayoi in the next episode, but it looks like someone's got some 'splaining to do before that happens.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, as far as we know she's not alive.
>> ARTICLE
up until that scene.. yes, it looked eerily like the normal lost-snail-dead-hachikuji.

the moment he managed to guide her back to that house she was looking for it was confirmation that she actually was alive and they did save her.
>> ARTICLE
Aragari fucked up and the world was annihilated - whatever that means we'll have to wait until the next episode to find out. I figure it means everything is changed and not they're walking into a post apocalyptic type situation, although that would be kind of funny. Should be interesting to see how Aragari and Shinobi get themselves out of this one, since this seems like the worst thing they've been involved with yet.   
Anyway, little Hanekawa was too cute and Aragari seemed to restrain himself... a little more than he does when he comes across Hachikuji in any case.

>> ARTICLE
All right.  Going to guess that 'destiny finds a way' is totally out, and it's the characters that cause stuff to happen, not the universe or plot railroading things.  This means that Hachikuji probably now exists in the modern world as an adult.  Since the arc title is Mayoi Jiangshi, it's entirely possible she found Shinobu instead of Araragi, and then *insert Kizu events here without Araragi rescue complex*.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if this future's Araragi is together with Hachikuji instead of Senjougahara.  Also leads to the question of whether there are two Araragis now or if our Araragi overwrote the one from the new future when he traveled back.

So there are a bunch of events in the timeline where adding Hachikuji could interfere.  Given Kanbaru's apparent involvement last arc, it's possible that Hachikuji caused Kanbaru to use the demon paw enough in the past that she went full demon with nobody to stop her.  Kizu with Mayoi would cause a number of issues, and is the one I count as most likely.  If Araragi died at any point, which is highly possible, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Fire Sisters having to fight roaming demons, given Tsukihi's immortality cheats and Karen's general OP-ness.  Senjougahara's issues would never have been resolved, but since we have the old world's Araragi here now, he would TOTALLY try to go save her as a sidequest.  NekoHanekawa would never have been stopped by Araragi, she'd totally be running rampant (especially given the amount of stress in the new world), and might not have any real feelings toward Araragi since he wouldn't have gotten his prince moment in Kizu.  Nadeko won't really matter because so far she's been pretty boring.  If something happens that stops Meme from showing up or kills him, that would majorly fuck things up.

In any case, I'm going to wager that in this future, the viewers' Araragi is going to fail at saving someone/getting them to save themselves, and there will be some major change with Araragi's current relationships.  I'm suspecting he'll be together with Hanekawa in some very unstable and shallow relationship.  Araragi bitching out himself for this, and for doing Hanekawa no favors, would be extremely entertaining.  There will be a relationship inversion between him and Hachikuji, where she's an extremely powerful vampire who possibly goes through the groping gag on him.  Araragi will meet Senjougahara and it will be wicked depressing.  ...And it's entirely possible he'll try to bossrush every girl's problems, which will meet with failure (I'd guess with Senjougahara dying?  All bets are off in a disposable future), so he'll revert to the old timeline in desperation.

There's way more stuff they could do here than they could possibly fit into the next few episodes.  I would love an entire cour of Araragi trying to save everyone in the new timeline.
>> ARTICLE
I think Hachikuji interfering as an adult at any point isn't very probable as well because she'd be like 3-4 years older than him (I think?) so I'd just assume she wouldn't be in the same town anymore. I think it's more likely that because he saved her, any major roles she had in previous arcs would have never happened because he didn't ever meet her in the future as the lost cow/snail. (meaning no Murararagi gags and such. *sadface*)

I also think Araragi dying at any point before even meeting Shinobu is extremely unlikely. Really, considering my previous statements, him dying at any point before maybe Kanbaru's arc is pretty unlikely too. In Suruga Monkey, his life was in danger but Oshino ended up saving him by calling Gahara, so really he wasn't in any danger. I don't see where Hachikuji had any huge play in this instance so maybe the likelihood of him dying even after Kanbaru's is pretty unlikely. In Nadeko Snake, his life was again in danger but he was of course saved by Kanbaru who told him to stop moving or the poison would kill him. Again, Hachikuji really didn't have any major part in this arc, so I'm gonna place all my bets on Tsubasa Cat.

In Tsubasa Cat, if I remember correctly, Hachikuji actually did have a significant role. She was the one that told him she saw Shinobu somewhere (I think Mister Donut) by herself and that caused Shuraragi to go on a hunt for her, then causing everyone to be so busy looking for her that no one was there to save him. I'm gonna say the only thing that comes of him saving Hachikuji is that he doesn't meet her anymore and everything goes as usual up to maybe Tsubasa's arc and that maybe he dies there by Black Hanekawa and that causes the end of the world, but I don't know how this could cause the end of the world really. 

Also, I think him and Gahara do still end up together because Gahara said no matter what happened/happens she still would have ended up falling in love with him and I think she also says that she'd kill anyone that killed him so maybe that could also lead to the end of the world. The thought of Gahara ending the world because of him dying is a bit silly but...she is pretty scary sometimes (I'm thinking about Nise here when I say she was pretty scary). If it does end up that Gahara ends the world...well shit I'd love to see that.
>> ARTICLE
I'm liking your thoughts of Hanekawa being the Araragi-killer (since I don't expect we'll see two adult Araragis), culminating in him changing the past back to save her in NekoShiro, since we'd see Hanekawa at her absolute worst in the alternate timeline.  That sort of ending makes the most sense with the NekoShiro ending.  And Gahara falling in love with him again within the span of the remaining episodes of the arc would be the sweetest thing, while her destroying the world in vengeance would also be the best thing.  I wonder what kind of oddity a mourning Senjougahara would spawn.

Most of my thoughts on Hachikuji interfering were around the basis that she'd be another character constantly causing things to happen instead of not being around for eleven years.  She was in elementary school when she died, and Araragi should be around seven at the time, so I think they'd be pretty close in age.  They clearly have a rapport going on in the original timeline, so I think that they'd hit it off if they grew up together.  With Hachikuji constantly being around, every arc's progression would just go out the window and be replaced by lots of Hachikuji/Araragi banter.

I should probably take into account the hinted-at extremely powerful oddity that's around eleven years ago, allowing the portal to still be around, but I really don't have any idea where that came from.  Possible it spawned because the timeline changes create an oddity.

Dammit I really want the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Another thing to take into account is the title of the arc itself, Jiangshi meaning hopping vampire/zombie. I don't know how zombies or multiple vampires could really take into play here though. 

I really want the next episode too. A week is so long from now...
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't be surprised if it was metaphorical in some fashion.  In a sense, Araragi just raised her from the dead, so that can cover non-literal zombie (given that titles have been known to mislead before, like Suruga Monkey).  Zombie part comes from her rising from the dead, vampire part comes from a Shinobu encounter.

Also I suspect Senjougahara's house will be burnt down given his certainty that he'd cry if Hanekawa hadn't been there to save Senjougahara from her tiger.  And I NEED there to be a fight between alternate versions of someone, whether it's Araragi versus a suped-up full vampire version of himself, Snail Mayoi vs. Vampire Mayoi, or Kanbaru versus a fully-demonized version of herself.  It would be an amusing play on people having to save themselves if Snail Mayoi somehow managed to get into this timeline based on her wandering spirit cred, and was very actively saving 'herself'.

So many directions this could go that I'm certain I'm setting myself up for disappointment... except that Shaft hasn't disappointed yet.

...^^^Masterpiece ...

---

If I may make one comment, since this episode entirely speaks for itself, I noticed one extremely interesting thing.

During the final talk in post-credits, when Shinobu says: 

"No not really, it wasn't that bad. Well, I found it a chore to undo the misunderstanding, so I let him say whatever he wanted to. I felt he was confused and deranged for now, but he would calm down in due time."

Following this, extreme zoom in on Araragi, the following statements flash up:

* IF THE FEELING SHE WANTED HIM TO DIE,

* WAS REALLY.

* COMPLETELY

* NON-EXISTENT AT ALL --

* THAT JUST CAN'T BE.

* IF SHE REALLY WAS THAT KIND OF WOMAN.

* I WOULDN'T BE LIVING HERE LIKE THIS.

* I WOULDN'T BE ALIVE -- TURNED INTO A HALF VAMPIRE.

I transcribed this, because I almost always let the text-flashes play without pausing on my first watch-through, so I experience it ~~how it was meant to be~~ in a very unique fashion for lack of better wording: certain words/phrases flash out at you: you experience the ones your eyes are drawn to: as if getting a split-second insight into the character's thoughts.

This one, however, I felt was extremely important, make of it what you will.

>I experience it how it was meant to be: certain words/phrases flash out at you: you experience the ones your eyes are drawn to: as if getting a split-second insight into the character's thoughts.

I don't know about that, I believe that the text-flashes are excerpts from the light novels, so they were originally meant to be read fully.
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know the text flashes/"missing scene" in the original Bakemonogatari marked areas where they didn't have the budget to animate
>> ARTICLE
I know of that. I am talking about it as more of the direction style Shinbou is using. The LN's use it as a character-insight tool, which you can read at your own pace.

The anime tries to recreate this feeling by displaying it in this fashion. I guess I used the wrong wording, I didn't exactly mean "how it was meant to be".

Alright, that's fair.

Thank you for this, i could only manage to get about every other one with pausing and un-pausing as fast as i could. Daisuki really needs to add a play/pause hotkey.

what i make of that is that she probably was much more affected by his words and actions than she leads Shiraragi to believe.

Interestingly, Shinobu's explanation that she misattributed her fast heartbeat to love is a real and well known psychologically phenomena, which if anyone's interested can read about here: http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/07/07/misattribution-of-arousal/

All right, well I finally got around to watching the episode.

I enjoyed it for the most part and I'm glad to see the direction it's heading in. While we jumped in this arc in a huge rush, the pacing has seemed to slow to a very comfortable pace. I can only hope they maintain this constant.

I think I realized that Kizu is going to definitely suffer a bit thanks to being released so late now, because so much of Shinobu's story was told. Now [Spoilers?](/s "A lot of her actions won't make sense or will make too much sense and it'll spoil the ending on it's own because this arc justifies her feelings about humans as a vampire.")

Oh Shaft :( 

Anyways, while I imagined this to play out totally different, I can't say I'm disappointed in the least. I love the way Shinobu tells legends (ever since her telling Ragi-san about Tsukihi's Dying-Bird aberration. Seriously, episode 11 of Nisemonogatari had the best opening sequence out of all of the Monogatari series I've seen to date) or stories, she really takes her time to build up the suspense and exposition. I guess you could say she actually speaks like a much, much older person who's sort of obscure on the details because they can't recall them entirely, but that really just adds to the atmosphere. Great episode, it truly satisfied me and left me without anything to really say, except I can't wait to [MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THIS ARC](/s " drink everyone's tears by the end of this arc. I know I teared up even just reading it. ") Also, I couldn't help but notice the BGM this episode. They replayed that one song a whole lot and while it didn't really bother me, I think they should've tweaked it a bit every time they did instead of flat out repeating it.

I loved the style of this episode. It was like a visual storybook presented by Shaft. The beautiful art that was used to present Shinobu's story speaks for itself, extremely well done. Not to mention the little details that were put in, like Shinobu spinning the bike tire. We could of had just flat dialogue scenes this episode, but Shaft's art just wouldn't allow it. 

The writing and pacing in this episode as well were big stand outs. What Nisio did here was write his own Japanese folktale around one of his own characters, and then have it fit in to the over all narrative of his universe. The way he chose to write the folktale was absolutely great. It felt like I was sitting here being told a true story from 400 years ago. I also appreciate the interlaced scenes with Shinobu speaking to Araragi. I got the impression of a detective story. Where Araragi was pressing Shinobu for more information, kind of like an only film noir crime movie. I love the duality in the styles of story telling. 

Even though the narrative flowed seamlessly from the folktale style art to the modern day style art I still got the impression that I was being told two different stories.  Needless to say I was very impressed with this episode, 10/10 in my book. Can't wait to see where this goes. 

Also. The idea of not wanting to be alone is such a prevailing aspect to Shinobu's character that it just makes me want to see Kizu more and more. I can imagine now where that story would go, but that doesn't bother me. I'm not going to get on the hype bandwagon with the "SHAFT KIZU NOW!!" type of language. I would just really love, and appreciate that story being animated before the general consensus of opinion forgets about it.

Look, the arcs damn title is Shinobu Time. I dont care if Shinobu already stole Mayois actual title arc. Shinobus just a way better character than Mayoi, and if Mayoi ends up stealing this one, I will not be pleased. I dont watch Monogatari for Mayoi/Araragis rambling, pointless conversations or haha Araragis a pedophile jokes - shit like that almost had me dropping Bake right in the middle of Snail, and has always been the centerpiece of the in spite of list that silently follows any Monogatari is fantastic statements by me. Yeah, I know some people like it - [they have that right.](http://i.imgur.com/L0AHX7Q.png) Personally, Im hoping even Isin isnt troll enough to name the arc Shinobu Time and then screw me like this.

Super mad about cartoons! Alright, lets watch some damn Monogatari.

**Episode 18**

0:12 - [Hurray sweet alternate art styles](http://i.imgur.com/L4Ti4JG.jpg)

0:31 - [*It just keeps going*](http://i.imgur.com/tEF0bkb.jpg)

1:07 - [Quite the mural.](http://i.imgur.com/6SOSH0R.jpg) This is a very frank admission here, too - in the absence of people to observe them, apparitions have no power. They need to exist as reflections - they need stories to be told about them. Is it through the stories that they become real? For whatever definition real has value in the Monogatari universe?

Man, I love this show. The way these elements and ideas naturally spin off each other is just endlessly compelling. Proposing that the apparitions might all be in the various characters heads (as they regularly turn out to be) seems to be missing the point, or at least only going halfway with it. Yes, the apparitions might be fabricated, but that doesnt make them any less real to the people involved. Mental illness itself could be demeaned or disparaged as all in your head, but youd be rightly condemned for trivializing psychological and emotional realities that way. 

What does that make Shinobu, then? Her identity doesnt *seem* like a reflection of Araragi (actually living in his reflection aside). Hm.

3:13 - [Those who create miracles are called gods... to be precise, those who create miracles are *turned into* a god.](http://i.imgur.com/mAR0Otb.jpg) Again, definition dictates reality

7:28 - [Monogataris usual aesthetic is not to be outdone](http://i.imgur.com/Zw0YmjH.jpg)

7:41 - [They keep playing with that same repeated lighting geometry](http://i.imgur.com/ToqJDTc.jpg) - the diagonal cut with one half in light and one in shadow, visible in the earlier shots, but here made even more overt through that abstract window-thing. Not sure what to make of it - obviously its very relevant to Shinobus vampiric nature, but beyond that...

9:41 - [This shots just stylish as hell.](http://i.imgur.com/YXzxG8P.png) If youre using a medium like animation, you might as well own it

11:34 - [These backgrounds gah](http://i.imgur.com/nCkADPV.jpg). Theres even still a slight hint of Monogatari-ness with the fade from orange to red being repeated in the foreground tree and background mountain

14:36 - [The first one to make a bond with Shinobu also ended up isolated](http://i.imgur.com/CKAM7fz.jpg). So its probably something she views as an inevitability of her relationships

16:11 - [Pretty shots forever](http://i.imgur.com/qxHbRDG.jpg)

18:37 - [And again.](http://i.imgur.com/pOfkQfi.jpg) Now shes directly equating her minion relationships with romance, which again seems to indicate she views Araragi a liiiittle bit differently than he views her

20:51 - [Oh, wow.](http://i.imgur.com/AqFcqof.jpg) Theyre bringing back the spotlight from Medusa and making it even more overt this time. A moment of actual emotional honesty/vulnerability, then

23:16 - [Shinobu on trial.](http://i.imgur.com/Sp154EU.png) Whos meant for the other chair?

**And Done**

Goddamn. Well, I guess I got what I wished for - a twenty minute monologue-journey into the history that helped define Shinobus relationship with humanity. That art style was gorgeous, and seemed like a smart choice in a bunch of ways. It created this sort of mythology of Shinobu mood through its classic aesthetic, which kind of worked against the offhand way she phrased everything to imply a disconnect between her vocal affectation and the way those events actually do linger in her mind. It was just compelling in its own right, and added a lot of visual interest to a summary-format story while clearly differentiating itself from Monogataris usual aesthetic. It made the events of her past seem even more inevitable - each piece of the tapestry fades into the next, with no active choices being made. And it was just damn pretty. This episode built directly off the how do Araragi and Shinobu each feel about their relationship stuff I found most compelling about last episode, and went more fully into her character than weve ever seen before (with the possible exception of the second arcs finale). It even brought back the visual language of Medusa for Shinobus final comments, using the established spotlight motif to hammer in how formative this experience was.

Jeez. Kinda heavy stuff. Im eager to see a more full reaction from Araragi - she kind of offhandedly spilled her heart out to him here, and that seems like it might warrant at least a minor shift in their dynamic. Guess Im in for another long week.

> the offhand way she phrased everything to imply a disconnect between her vocal affectation and the way those events actually do linger in her mind.

Yes! Shinobu's telling being so distant _is_ the character point, and that's told so so well by even little things like contrasting the palette of the murals with the palette of present day. She really does remember, and care, as much as she protests that she doesn't - and the disconnect between the way in which _she_ and _the show_ tell the stories is the reason we're meant to figure this out.

I really have no idea how this ever worked in text.

I also absolutely adored the slow de-distancing between the two of them throughout the episode. They started with Shinobu talking to Araragi through a _radio_, facing away from each other, sitting at different levels. Slowly, this changes - every time we see them, they're _closer_ in some way - until they end with a literal spotlight on her insecurities, Shinobu fidgeting and uncomfortable, telling her most blatant not-quite-lies.

So, so beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Completely agreed. No idea how this worked in text, since the wonderful visual style added so much to the telling and their physical placement did so much to define the emotional shift of the story. It's remarkable to see something so close to a monologue make such great use of a visual medium.

Because Shinobu that's why. Shinobu is like...most popular character.
>> ARTICLE
After hearing Shinobu's story, it's obvious that history is repeating itself. Shinobu said that if she stays in the same place for too long, "dark energy" accumulates, resulting in oddities and people disappearing. Doesn't that sort of explain why Araragi and his friends have been encountering so many oddities? Also, the darkness that Araragi encountered. That's my theory anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
It was also mentioned by Oshino Meme in Bakemonogatari that a person who encounters one apparition will encounter more throughout their lifetime.  
 
 Though I'm sure Shinobu has no small role in that.
>> ARTICLE
so.. the darkness showed up because an apparition was revered as a deity and it consumed only its worshippers/those who knew of her.

the "goddess" this time is Nadeko Medusa and the ones who know about her are Hitagi, Shinobu, Chararagi-san and..  Hachikuji?

only other new/relevant piece of information is that other sword that brings apparitions back to life. certainly convenient though much less logical than the apparition killer as it singlehandedly made any apparition's demise only a temporary state of affairs. i wouldn't be surprised if they'd be set on a journey to retrieve it at some point, if Shinobu didn't already hold onto it.

i wonder whose chair that was which kept getting lit-up. i assume it's the past minion that she kept addressing since when she was talking to Shiraragi-san it didn't have light over it. 

loved the murals.. especially since they had moving elements - so they weren't just one big painting -and of course they didn't hold back on fanservice, showing adult Shinobu in the nude.

can we have more present day plot now?

Oni happens before Otori, so Nadeko isn't a "goddess" at the tme.
>> ARTICLE
well then, the logic of it beats the shit out of me..
>> ARTICLE
You just gotta look at why the 'darkness' even showed up in the first place. The 'darkness' showed up because Shinobu was being regarded as a goddess and not a vampire. It was there to pretty much make her be regarded as a vampire again, because that's what she is. It did this by consuming all of those who not only praised her, but even those who just saw/knew about her being a goddess and leaving those who either didn't know about her, or saw her as something else. This is why a huge vicinity of those around that area (where she was at) became barren. Generally, small populations have their own stories and legends and crap like that. What the 'darkness' did is just remove those that are giving her goddess status because she's essentially lying about what she is. Once it did that, she still didn't immediately return to her vampiric ways, so the 'darkness' did the next rational thing and decided to remove her entirely because she wasn't following her natural status. It was only until after she managed to get away and make the First into a vampire, that she returned to her vampire ways and the 'darkness' stopped chasing after her. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah well, i got that since i wrote the exact same thing in the first phrase. what i didn't get is why the darkness showed up during the present and went after Rararagi-san and Hachikuji?

and no, i don't want spoilers as explanations :P

Then just think harder. You can do it! I believe in you! Well really...I don't think you have to think harder but probably rewatch some stuff or something.

~~The first time~~ *Every time we see Araragi kiss someone, it's not even his girlfriend... I was wrong but the statement still holds true...Araragi you should be ashamed!

He had to smooch Karen to catch her bug or whatever it was. Was that off-screen? Can't remember.

Yup it was. 

But actually I'm still wrong, the first kiss we saw was of him kissing Tsukihi. 
>> ARTICLE
What was your theory about Kizu?
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty weak theory and was definitely a long shot but, in the book Araragi kisses her to shut her up from advertising Kizumonogatari, I was hoping they'd keep the scene and so they could announce Kizu after this episode/arc lol.

I think I just want to see Kizu too much now.

To translate, "For me, singing isn't a job but a tool for self expression, something I should write and sing under my own name.  So I basically don't sing character songs" ...I'd say if anything that's deep.

>She doesn't want to sing a song written by someone else. Pretty petty if you ask me.

Petty? It's quite understandable if you consider that she's been singing mostly her own songs for a long time now. 

Also, as much as I like most of the music in Monogatari, it's not really comparable to real, non-anime music, so it's understandable that Sakamoto has her reservations.
>> ARTICLE
>real

I'd rather say that there is no such things as "real music" or "fake music". Either it's music or it's not.

Other than that, I'd rather agree. I always feel like anison are a lot less "creative" than other kind of songs. Recently, I've seen many VocaloP doing a OP or ED for an anime, and it's been kinda meh compared to what they've done with Vocaloid. Kemu's "No Pain, No Gain" used as BTOOOM!'s OP is really repetitive imho for exemple.

Anyways, it's just that it's mostly meant to be catchy and appeal to a lot of people that aren't there for how smart the guys are with the chord progression or some other stuff that only hardcore music fans will notice...

I personnally share the same view on music than Sakamoto Maaya. Add to that, the fun of playing a song you like and with fellow musicians.
>> ARTICLE
>I'd rather say that there is no such things as "real music" or "fake music". Either it's music or it's not.

Yeah... I do know that. Maybe I should have used quotation marks around "real".

>Other than that, I'd rather agree. I always feel like anison are a lot less "creative" than other kind of songs. 

Smart of you to use quotation marks around "creative", because there's naturally no actual creative difference between anison and other music(at least, there's nothing that says that anison can't be as "good" as other songs). But, I understand exactly what you mean. Anime music(actually, OPs and EDs specifically) is made with a specific purpose in mind, and that makes it slightly different from the kind of music that exists simply because the musician made it so.

>Anyways, it's just that it's mostly meant to be catchy and appeal to a lot of people that aren't there for how smart the guys are with the chord progression or some other stuff that only hardcore music fans will notice...

And that is noticable when you get into the bad habit of listening to songs from a show that you really enjoy and thinking "This is the pinnacle of music!" and then subsequently listen to "real"(in the same sense that we both meant earlier) music and realize how wrong you are, at least on a purely technical level. Of course, there's "real" music that doesn't feel particularly inspired(I have a problem with the fact that most of Metallica's songs are basically made up of a single word or sentence repeated over and over again, but that's just personal, of course), but the classics are classics. When you compare Staple Stable to Stairway to Heaven, the difference can be felt. It's the same thing with orchestral film scores and actual classical music.

>I personnally share the same view on music than Sakamoto Maaya. Add to that, the fun of playing a song you like and with fellow musicians.

This whole thing actually made me think of [this blog post](http://marumichannel.tumblr.com/post/65097784209/036-web-036-different-ways-of). Maybe Sakamoto doesn't like doing music in the same way that anime is made, i.e. as commission work. She's a professional "real" musician too, after all.

This might actually be a fairly common opinion, now that I think about it. There are many shows where the OP and ED don't seem to match the show at all, and that might be because the songwriter and musicians didn't want to compromise too much during the creative process. For instance, if I recall correctly, when Supercell were tasked with creating the ED for Bakemonogatari, they were asked not to make it "fit the show" in the same way that the OPs do. Of course, it still fits the show, but it also stands on its own legs far better than many other anime songs. And, in addition, the decision to include Yanagi Nagi in the creative process by having her do the vocals instead of relying on vocaloid basically spawned an entire album from Supercell. I think that goes to show that Supercell were given at least a little bit of creative freedom.
>> ARTICLE
she's under a different agency and she has her own personal feelings regarding character songs. The last time she did a character song was for hitomi in escaflowne I believe 
>> ARTICLE
Which was her debut (as a singer), so yeah. Though I know she has done further anime work, most of it being with Yoko Kanno. I think she'd still write her own stuff for anime, I just don't think she likes having her material attached to fictional characters.

Thats three top-tier arcs in a row. Monogatari, I dont know what theyve put in your drinking water, but I like it. This arc is ostensibly about Shinobu, whos one of my favorite characters, but Ive heard its actually heavy on Mayoi, my least favorite, so I guess well see if they keep it up. But this season has given me no reason to expect disappointment - Monogatari is one of the most compelling anime of the last few years, and S2 has been far and away the strongest set of episodes. Bring on Shinobu Time.

**Episode 17**

0:08 - [Always good to have you back, Monogatari.](http://i.imgur.com/7qQRlfH.jpg) Im gonna be sad when this seasons done. Forty-some episodes and Im still not tired of this world theyve constructed

0:11 - [Dang this ones actually nicer](http://i.imgur.com/IEqWCbD.jpg)

0:18 - [Our favorite schemer.](http://i.imgur.com/6cF7JAm.jpg) This shows interpretation of a villain is about as skewed as its interpretation of every other story element

1:09 - [These opening monologues.](http://i.imgur.com/aVhuY37.jpg) So whadda we got consistency, whims, consideration. Gotta keep track, theyre not all as overt as Medusa was

1:41 - [A nice one](http://i.imgur.com/etAMBe6.jpg)

Many shots of Fauxshino contrasted against those black birds in flight. Well see if thats a thing

1:50 - [And another nice one.](http://i.imgur.com/4466ONL.jpg) Deep, natural greens are a pretty rare sight in this world. I think the shrines trees have been every color *but* natural green

2:33 - [Even when he doesnt end up getting ripped apart, attempting to save everyone doesnt do him any favors](http://i.imgur.com/eiavwDX.jpg). Kind of tough being the exorcist in a world where demons represent the things you yourself have to deal with

3:32 - [Yep, its gonna be one of *those* conversations.](http://i.imgur.com/4YNgeV5.jpg) Goddamnit you two

4:07 - [This may very well all reflect on Shinobu or something,](http://i.imgur.com/mJc0R8B.jpg) but I never trust these two to actually keep the story moving

6:08 - [The hero we deserve](http://i.imgur.com/6QoVJCx.jpg)

6:19 - [Oshit palette change what happened](http://i.imgur.com/SOm22L1.png)

6:40 - [And its a creepy one](http://i.imgur.com/fXGcYBt.jpg)

8:50 - [Pretty solid chase sequence all through here](http://i.imgur.com/GaOC5DZ.jpg). Pretty typical Monogatari to make Ive got a bad feeling about this something chase-worthy all by itself

9:53 - [Friggin Mayoi stories](http://i.imgur.com/98X7qGX.jpg)

10:50 - [Right, shes here.](http://i.imgur.com/ZOjNiPI.jpg) And so is that other associate of Meme and Kaikis that Hanekawa ran into. So is this the big event thats got all the spirit-busters worried? Possibly even the explanation for Araragis appearance at the end of Neko White? THE PLOT THICKENS

10:58 - [Cranes as far as the eye can see.](http://i.imgur.com/E4zPqnv.jpg) No wonder this citys only consistent feature is construction signs

Also, yeah, this *is* the part where the badass usually appears, saves them, and explains everything. Hey Isin, good to see ya

11:45 - [How much time are we covering in two seasons.](http://i.imgur.com/GVIIiw3.png) Five days, maybe?

12:23 - [I approve of this face](http://i.imgur.com/D0FkERd.png)

12:49 - [Nice image.](http://i.imgur.com/x4AGIRm.jpg)

12:58 - [Its cool, this whole series is basically an elaborate version of that](http://i.imgur.com/AROMrRH.png)

13:00 - [Thats the stuff](http://i.imgur.com/e8T5jG4.jpg)

13:20 - [This is fantastic.](http://i.imgur.com/xbx00pG.jpg) I couldnt think of a more ridiculous character to have doing this

13:37 - [The world must know!](http://i.imgur.com/z43Zmwm.jpg)

14:09 - [Its true - at this point, school-attending quasi-vampires are kinda mundane](http://i.imgur.com/wJYvTpf.png)

15:36 - [Its never that easy, is it?](http://i.imgur.com/eoF58gI.jpg) Straight answers, hah

16:48 - [Its like Shinobu is the actual apparition-expert,](http://i.imgur.com/qfL0FAV.jpg) and Araragis just the apparition experts marketing department

17:07 - [This seems important.](http://i.imgur.com/s0ZCM4r.jpg) It certainly ties in with Medusa

18:32 - [Oh is that all.](http://i.imgur.com/BPiTjww.jpg) So are we pushing the Shinobu/Araragi relationship to some kind of breaking point? But theyre adorable together!

21:27 - [Yep, more about their bond](http://i.imgur.com/NOFCXbM.jpg). Well see

22:35 - [Well thats, uh not what I expected](http://i.imgur.com/WucjIvy.png)

23:16 - [Wow that shots lovely.](http://i.imgur.com/3IM8xTW.png) This episode has been largely exposition and pervy comedy, but it certainly never fails to impress visually

23:53 - [One more nice one](http://i.imgur.com/MMYJN0b.jpg)

**And Done**

Well, that episode kinda lapsed into the things I was worried about, but that doesnt really dampen my expectations. The second arc was also very slow to start, and relied largely on comedy as it set up its scenario, and the second half of that one turned out fantastically. I actually liked Ononoki for maybe the first time this episode - her appreciation of Araragis muscles got me pretty good. And what a buffet of Araragiservice that was!

That last scene with Shinobu was interesting, and almost certainly the one most relevant to whatever issue this is really going to be about. Her getting either playfully or actively mad about the kiss, and Araragis fairly surprising counter-kiss, could go in any number of directions. Mainly because their relationship itself is so weird - theyve got an intimacy so close theyre essentially sharing the same body, and they both know that when everything else is dust, theyll only have each other. But what does that mean in an emotional sense? Araragis actively dating Senjougahara - was Shinobu just yanking his chain here, and thus his response was to take that playfulness to its ridiculous extreme so he could get on with the real issue? Or does him being close to another spirit-creature somehow intrude on something she actually does believe is hers alone? This could easily tie into that being utterly reliant on her issue Ononoki was talking about - will this possibly be about him taking her for granted? That could definitely work - Araragi at least needs Shinobu to resolve these apparitions, but as we saw in arc two, Shinobu needs Araragi for far more personal reasons.

Well, thats a lot of hypothesizing for one little scene. I guess well see soon enough.

> Araragi at least needs Shinobu to resolve these apparitions, but as we saw in arc two, Shinobu needs Araragi for far more personal reasons.

You mentioning that they need each other reminded me that they'll get separated later this arc, like we saw in Neko:Shiro. Interested to see how it happened and how they got reunited, also how Araragi handled it.
>> ARTICLE
>  her appreciation of Araragis muscles got me pretty good.

She wanted to eat him. She wanted to eat a piece of his muscles because they looked so good. ~~They dropped this bit from the anime.~~

>Or does him being close to another spirit-creature somehow intrude on something she actually does believe is hers alone?

It's definitely this. Remember, Ononoki said he cheated? But on who? Well considering Shinobu's reaction to the kiss, I think it's obvious. Shinobu is a demon and so is Ononoki. It wouldn't make sense for Shinobu to get upset if he kissed another *human* or else she would have already been all over his case about Gahara. I'd say she firmly believes Araragi is hers (as a demon she believe this, which is probably why she doesn't care about Gahara and him being together) alone.
>> ARTICLE
It was in the episode, that she wanted a piece of his muscles. Then the flashcard thing said that he could actually cut a piece off since it would just regenerate.

Of course it would just evaporate while he healed.
>> ARTICLE
Daisuki player actually made me miss something for once. Ahh well, thanks for the correction!
>> ARTICLE
> She wanted to eat him

Aw, I actually like that less than her just blankly marveling at his manservice. Well, either way works.

> Shinobu's perspective

Yeah, it seems this way - and this makes the Shinobu/Araragi relationship even more interesting. Shinobu seems to consider the affairs and lives of individual humans pretty trivial, and so someone like Gahara isn't a threat to her. But from Araragi's perspective, all these relationships are important, and Shinobu isn't necessarily special to him in the way he is to her. And so he can jokingly kiss her to say "alright, let's be serious about this," but Shinobu wasn't necessarily joking in the first place
>> ARTICLE
I think this also ties into why she still looks like a loli. Besides the fact that we know Araragi is a loli-con, perhaps its also because he doesn't entirely take her seriously. I think this is interesting because while he may not take her seriously all the time, he still heavily relies on her and still relies on her so much even after the catastrophic fuck-up that was Kabuki (aka time travel with no idea how it actually works). 

Their relationship is definitely one of the most interesting relationships I've ever seen, that's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Shinobu's character design is kinda different.  Like Mayoi is drawn like more or less a little kid, and even though Araragi flirts with her it's all sort of a silly, junior high-ish skirt-flipping kind of way.  He loves tangling with her but he's pretty obviously not actually serious about it (at least as far as we can ever trust Araragi not to perv out).

Shinobu is small but she's decidedly not childish.  She's usually drawn with huuuuuge hips, and her head's not so over-proportioned to her body as you'd see in a more realistic style of drawing a young character.  The exception would be back in bake before she started talking, where she really does just look young.
>> ARTICLE
This is also getting at what Ononoki was saying about "don't rely on her too much". 

It could be because Shinobu is misinterpreting Araragi's reliance and obligation to her (Well, it started off as an obligation early on in the series, but it has progressed) as romantic feelings for her. Which is quite easy to do, and forgiveable. 

Shinobu is head-over-heels for Araragi: Her reaction to shota-Araragi was quite amusing, but it also reveals that *her* perception of Araragi is idealised in the same way that [Araragi's perception of Hanekawa and Hitagi is also warped.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1jmt9d/spoilers_monogatari_series_second_season_episode/cbgapri)

I *really wonder* how [Araragi would appear](http://i.imgur.com/peboKFe.png), if this arc was narrated by Shinobu? 
>> ARTICLE
> Araragi would appear

I'd place all my bets on a casanova. He's been a hero and a charmer so far, so we can only assume all (except maybe Gahara) the girls see him in an entirely positive way. 

He's tamed a tiger, charmed a snake and now he's seducing a vampire! 

Aren't vampires supposed to be all seductive or whatever anyways? I think in most old tales about vampires they were portrayed as seducers and charmers.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't Meme propose that as a possible reason why Araragi's suddenly got all this success with the ladies?  It got promptly shot down, as I recall, but it's certainly an idea the show's familiar with.
>> ARTICLE
It was Hanekawa who said that. Meme told him that that wasn't how the charming thing worked (it basically turned those who fell victim to the charm effect into puppets) which made him realize that Hanekawa was trying to hint the fact that she was in love with him.
>> ARTICLE
> Gahara

Would either look at him like [he is an insect](http://i.imgur.com/B84YRv1.jpg) or [be frightened/in awe of him](http://i.minus.com/ijsiXQfWJQF61.gif).

If you remember when he went into a rage and broke his shackles in Nisemonogatari in order to save his sisters, Hitagi was slightly frightened of him.

> Aren't vampires supposed to be all seductive or whatever anyways?

Funny, because this was actually brought up by Hanekawa in the Tsubasa Cat arc.

Araragi doesn't seem to take his kissing of girls that aren't Senjougahara too seriously in a romantic sense, he doesn't take it *lightly*, but he always has a reason behind it (Well, this time, Ononoki *kissed him*).

The ~~other~~ times when he kissed Shinobu, Tsukihi and Karen there was a specific reason for it, it is likely that he kissed Shinobu in order to quiet her so he could tell his story.

If he ever does get around to kissing Hitagi (On-screen), it will probably be a more genuine one.
>> ARTICLE
> The other times when he kissed Shinobu

He's never kissed Shinobu before, IIRC. 
>> ARTICLE
He did make the offer to shinobu during the kabuki time travel shenanigans though (I'm still upset shaft cut this out among other things). I don't quite remember the tone of the conversation though.
>> ARTICLE
Oops, that was a grammar mistake.

I meant, "The times when he kissed Shinobu, Tsukihi and Karen"
>> ARTICLE
Ohp, yeah that makes better sense.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it does seem like this was a "alright, you've had your fun, but I've got a real issue to talk about" kinda thing. Which doesn't seem to match with Shinobu's reaction, which in turn seems to imply a disconnect in the way the two of them view their relationship.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like Hachikuji's taking back some of her screen time that Shinobu stole in Mayoi Jiangshi.

also: The post-Free! manservice-boom in anime is being commented upon in Monogatari, was this in the LN's??
>> ARTICLE
Don't think you can call it post-Free!, there have always been fujoshi.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely, its just that I noticed a lot of manservice in shows that aren't primarily targeted at that audience, just after Free! Maybe I am crazy but this season, Yowamushi Pedal, based on a Shounen manga, and Valvrave/Kill la Kill which are original properties also did it. It has always been there, but it is more pronounced nowadays, not that I am complaining, its just an observation.

^(Also, we have had plenty of Araragi-service in previous monogatari seasons, it was just  ~~first time~~ one of the few times it was commented on)

VVV was airing before Free!, and the sexy sensei in Kill la Kill seems to be referencing Utena. Plus, both were in production before Free! aired.

Ah I see. Must have just been trying to see something that wasn't there then.

>> ARTICLE
Guys, did I miss something related to Shinobu and Hachikuji's bracelets being the same but on different arms?   
  Is it just unexplained or did I like miss some huge plot point somewhere?
>> ARTICLE
No real plot point related to the bracelets. It's more symbolism that you may have missed in Kabuki.
>> ARTICLE
...What did I miss in Kabuki then?
>> ARTICLE
Am I seeing this wrong, or is Araragi not taking his relationship with Senjougahara serious at all? I mean, he never mentions her at all, and now he just kisses Shinobu out of the blue to get her to talk.

It's worth noting that in the light novel, he said he'd never forgive himself if he kissed a girl that was over 15. So I think it's more like he doesn't take kisses from little girls (and loli's) seriously. 

Also he was just trying to make it up to Shinobu by kissing her since like Ononoki said, he essentially 'cheated' on Shinobu (since they're both demons) by kissing Ononoki.
>> ARTICLE
I can't help but feel that this will be another arc that won't be at it's full potential with Kizu not being out yet.
>> ARTICLE
This arc will definitely be at full potential. It doesn't have much correspondence to the events in Kizu at all so no need to worry.
>> ARTICLE
Ah alright, because she says something about her first minion so I thought they would be a big part of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
She does talk about her first subordinate but it doesn't really have anything to do with everything that happens in Kizu. Kizu will probably benefit from this actually.

It might have just been me, but it sounded like Ononoki defintely said la-li-lu-le-lo

I had a total nerdgasm
>> ARTICLE
Don't know if she did or not, but it's not necessarily a MGS reference. a i u e and o are the Japanese vowels, so la li lu le lo is just part of the Japanese alphabet. That's where it came from in MGS too.
>> ARTICLE
There is no L in japanese, It's closest equivalent is the R sound which is why they will often end up using R in place of words with the letter L. Hence all of the jokes about it "Shamefur Dispray".

It is probably a Metal Gear reference, especially since Nadeko's favorite game is MGS
>> ARTICLE
Well yes, I do know that, but it's translated as l or r depending on the word, not just r.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps the wrong place to ask, but how many episodes this season? A full 26? I'm waiting till it wraps before I watch it all.
>> ARTICLE
Watch it now, it's worth it. At least watch all the episodes before this one since those are completed arcs. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, 26 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
wow ... that Araragi x Shinobu moment
>> ARTICLE
What did the two words mean that they said said after they kissed?
>> ARTICLE
It may have been reference to Metal Gear Solid.
>> ARTICLE
>Araragi: Na-ni-ne-nu-no?!

>Ononoki: La-li-lu-le-lo.

What I think happened here is that Araragi was about to yell at her in anger/surprise, and started off with "Nani--?!" ("what--?!"), but was so utterly flustered that he flubbed into just reciting the N-hiragana in alphabetical order (a,i,u,e,o for Japanese).

Ononoki corrects him; it wasn't "na-ni-nu-ne-no", it was "la-li-lu-le-lo" (which I'm guessing means that she was liberal with the tongue in that kiss).
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing on a whim that this arc will explain how Shinobu got her black dress in Otorimonogatari a few episodes back.

And maybe how Araragi's Hoodie got ripped and he became un-useless?

It's likely that after they leave the school, it's burned down by Kako.

I laughed at Shinobu saying to Sengoku that she would've ended up raising a child at her age. She really has no faith in Araragi, huh.
>> ARTICLE
Well, another disturbing relevation was the fact that Araragi seems to stare at Tsukihi's legs while she sleeps, Ahoge wagging and all. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that was Nadeko imagining how the scene went down when her parent's called Tsukihi.
>> ARTICLE
Ararararagi grabbed Tsukihi's boobs prior and Karen went topless are the evidence that he is a siscon! Senjougahara confirmed this on the first season.
>> ARTICLE
When did Karen go topless? I need to know... for science. 
>> ARTICLE
In the first episode of Nekomonogatari, about 14 minutes in.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I am completely aware :)

It's just that I never knew it extended to creeping on his siblings while they slept. Although he did check up on them when they were sleeping naked in Nisemonogatari, and he slept with them in Nekomonogatari. Although both of those times he had a "reason" to do so.


>> ARTICLE
He is both a siscon and a lolicon. He almost jumped loli-Hanekawa if Shinobu didn't stop him/tell him he would get arrested if he jumped her. His face was also spewing blood when talking to loli-Hanekawa after he realized he couldn't jump her.
>> ARTICLE
Shinobu told Nadeko off pretty hard; She hit every single one of Nadeko's traits, and Nadeko was pretty upset because it was true.

I find myself enjoying every second with Shinobu on screen. Definitely a great character.

So I watched the episode again and i noticed something quite small but REALLY cool. When Shinobu is dragging Araragi across the room, they go past a [mirror](http://25.media.tumblr.com/8223b67c057d3b3b62f159f83e35845e/tumblr_mtwi3caq7W1suxajso1_500.gif).

Watch her legs then look at the mirror. She doesn't show up.

I know I've seen her not have a reflection somewhere else, too. Probably in Mayoi Jiangshi, but I don't remember the exact moment.

Ouch that was a killer conversation at the end, damn Shinobu is *harsh*.

That was a really good deconstruction of Sengoku's character though. More pls!

All I could think when I saw the scene in that gif was "Dat metaphor!"
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling that this whole arc is kind of a commentary on the whole guilt/victim complex which is pretty common in Japan, but that might only be because there was something similar (presented in a completely different way) in Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I was thinking this as well. I had just finished watching Paranoia Agent so that might have something to do with it.
>> ARTICLE
I finished the first season of SZS, when was that though? I can't really remember seeing that unless it was in the other seasons.

But definitely agree on what you said about this arc. I did not know it was a common thing in japan, so TIL! 
>> ARTICLE
It was the last episode of the first season. But yeah, it was portrayed completely differently in SZS. I think that Nadeko's psyche involves far more than just a guilt complex, the line where the Snake said something to the effect of "You just pigeonhole what people tell you", is suggesting something far more which I cannot describe fully yet.
>> ARTICLE
So.... Shinobu gets hot and bothered whenever Araragi is?
>> ARTICLE
would be good plot for a monogatari doujin
>> ARTICLE
I think she ignores it most of the time. I mean if she ignores/disregards the pain then I'm sure she can brush off all of those feelings.
>> ARTICLE
it helps that Shinobu's a girl and Araragi's a boy else Nadeko would've had two sis/lolicons to deal with.

I can see why the girls in Monogatari like Araragi so much, he's pretty charming

As mentioned somewhere above, this is Araragi as Nadeko sees him. Similar to how Hanekawa saw him as a hero appearing at the last moment against the moon in her arc. You've got to always keep in mind who's narrating the arc and all the characters are shown as they see them.

One of the most refreshing aspects of monogatari indeed.

In Hanekawa's eyes, he's a hero.

In Nadeko's eyes, he's a charmer.

I remember someone posted a question asking or stating how Shinobu wears a black dress this season, and I quickly realized that since we were watching this arc through Nadeko-chan's eyes Shinobu's dress could be seen as a symbolic allusion towards her being more experienced and not innocent as she is. (White dress being pure and black dress being, for a lack of a better word, cunning or sinful.
>> ARTICLE
This weekend is gonna kill me you guys. I have written so many words. I have so many words left to write. C3-bu. TWGOK. Gatchaman. Uchouten. Titan. *Why* am I *doing* this to *myself?!?*

Alright, thats not Monogataris fault. In fact, Monogataris the *nice* show, the one that *isnt* piling on the mountain of reviews Ive foolishly assigned myself. So lets take it easy, Monogatari. Maybe just have an episode of pretty backgrounds I can cap and say hey look at this pretty background to. Please dont get thematically dense on me here.

That seems pretty unlikely, though - between the snake and Ougi, this arc has already firmly declared it will be about the Fallacy of Victimhood, and how Nadeko uses her alleged helplessness as a defense mechanism even as she pursues selfish and potentially damaging ends. Given her desire to direct dissatisfaction outwards and minimal ability to express herself, Nadeko is possibly our most unreliable narrator yet, which in the context of Monogatari is really saying something. Lets get to it.

**Episode 13**

0:16 - [Yes thats exactly the kind of shot I was talking about](http://i.imgur.com/1ldaImc.jpg). Playing with light and color, the not-yet-blooming flower all in light and the bed all in shadow, with Nadeko on the borderline. I can tell you the *first* metaphor that comes to mind

0:33 - [Another great one.](http://i.imgur.com/my19r97.jpg) I like the angled lines of her body against the angled lines of the shadow

0:57 - [These are all great shots.](http://i.imgur.com/bieNrT3.jpg) Theyre making great use of the shadow, though Im not sure exactly how purposeful it is

...incidentally, I feel I should say this for every show and every post, but it goes double for Monogatari: when watching a show, dont let your first assumption be that you are smarter than the writer and director. Dont think thats a dumb choice, think hm, thats not the choice I would have made. What purpose might they have for making that choice? This wont always be rewarded, but the other option will result in missing plentiful richness in so many shows, in addition to just not making you a smarter viewer. Directors and writers dont just stumble into their jobs - most of them are there because theyre smart, passionate people who really do know what theyre doing

1:07 - [Very true words.](http://i.imgur.com/uIbwprn.jpg) Apparitions arent defeated, they are embraced and accepted. His power is her self-denial

2:48 - [Theres something very funny](http://i.imgur.com/Hw2G87A.png) about her apparition being a snake-scrunchy baffled by the conventions of school life.

Also, that could you make yourself completely invisible? line stabs at the denial of her own issues quite neatly

3:03 - [Just a great shot,](http://i.imgur.com/VhL6i2e.jpg) but also more light/shadow

3:07 - [On the nose](http://i.imgur.com/x6mpxOV.jpg)

3:41 - [Hes making it a lot harder to keep telling herself that](http://i.imgur.com/pbQZYno.jpg)

4:30 - [Brutal dressing down](http://i.imgur.com/2PIDoJ4.jpg). Theres something about this season and social anxiety disorder. Also a nice shot, with Nadeko at the head of the snake. 

4:48 - [A clean separation into the daylight half and the darkness half](http://i.imgur.com/6ujeK9A.png). What could searching for his corpse *really* signify?

5:51 - [Lighting again.](http://i.imgur.com/1Qso3G5.png) When the snake clarifies that its Shinobus fault he exists as he currently does (and therefore possibly Shinobus fault Nadeko is in this situation), shadow covers Nadeko completely. Giving her a chance to dissociate blame from herself creates the shadow

6:21 - [He was right to draw attention to that in any case.](http://i.imgur.com/z0AobBX.jpg) Never challenging, always following the path of least resistance

7:51 - [Its an interesting distinction](http://i.imgur.com/S8ecpIL.jpg).

Im so glad theyve been framing these stories from perspectives other than Araragis. This show has such a unique and compelling visual vocabulary, and its great to see the various versions of it other characters inhabit

8:20 - [The lighting intensifies sharply as he forces her to explain herself](http://i.imgur.com/XgeYu67.jpg). Is the distinction between suspicion and worry the clue that she knows shes not blameless? Or is this just a reflection of her lying to the snake, avoiding accusing him of victimizing her

9:05 - [These moments are very intense.](http://i.imgur.com/9UKTS1q.png) Absolutely love how theyre visually portraying her anxiety - Monogatari is wordy, but it also makes great use of the visual medium to portray raw, emotional moments where no words are necessary

9:16 - [Whoaaa, whats all this?](http://i.imgur.com/4zDLfmj.png)

10:10 - [Least resistance again.](http://i.imgur.com/I6Jj7nV.jpg) Interesting push-and-pull between her desire to get Araragis attention for her own ends and her desire to avoid making a fuss if at all possible

11:42 - [Creepy shot.](http://i.imgur.com/1JxyK1S.jpg) I wonder how much we can trust of what shes saying, or even the scenes as being portrayed altogether

12:12 - [Nice palette](http://i.imgur.com/hjgLyMJ.jpg)

12:50 - [Goddamn. Just lovely](http://i.imgur.com/3BcN6yU.jpg)

13:09 - [Really loving these colors](http://i.imgur.com/aC6MCTI.jpg)

14:52 - [Araragis endlessly surreal living situation](http://i.imgur.com/QoPg3aP.jpg)

15:24 - [She isnt. Shes just waiting for the conversation to be over](http://i.imgur.com/qlECkP3.jpg)

15:53 - [I have a hard time believing Araragi is this perceptive, so Im gonna have to assume hes this oblivious](http://i.imgur.com/RrY9nbo.jpg)

16:51 - [Dear lord Nadekos Araragi is charming](http://i.imgur.com/l0Hxol2.jpg). Is there a Senjougahara-perspective book? Id love to see her Araragi, though I cant imagine what a book from her perspective would be like (unsurprisingly, considering Araragi never has a clue what shes thinking)

17:58 - [Down, girl](http://i.imgur.com/7mXqmeN.png)

18:03 - [He makes dat savior complex look *good*](http://i.imgur.com/ESjm6Ic.png)

18:12 - [Oh my god that smile is too perfect.](http://i.imgur.com/kXJ0zZY.png) Araragi knows what the ladies like (the ladies like the floor)

18:29 - [That Nadekos a sly one](http://i.imgur.com/VbqZ971.jpg)

18:49 - [Thank goodness for loli vampires keeping the pedophiles in order.](http://i.imgur.com/BHakzCX.png) Wait

20:08 - [Nadeko cant catch a break](http://i.imgur.com/vr4uDFL.jpg)

21:39 - [Interesting.](http://i.imgur.com/r3fX6Nf.jpg) This conversation is covering similar ground to the earlier ones, but heres a cut back to those flowers? Strawberries? from earlier

21:50 - [Great shot, making the connection overt](http://i.imgur.com/c2wgAI5.jpg)

22:17 - [And now that sex/purity/innocence angle](http://i.imgur.com/AFQ6xTN.png) is directly implied, even as shes called a devil (also note that her color scheme is currently that of the snake - pure white with red eyes). This might be more complex than I was giving it credit for

22:40 - [Shes so gentle with him](http://i.imgur.com/f8ubksV.jpg)

**And Done**

Good for you, that you just so happened to be cute. Hrm.

Well, as expected, this is miles better than Nadekos first arc. As with Hanekawas arc, theyre doing great work in making the visual language reflect the narrative beats and themes. Im really liking what theyre doing with Nadekos character, though I think we still need more puzzle pieces. And this arc in general kinda feels like a step up visually from the last one, with the visual tricks being more pointed and more consistent, along with the usual lovely array of designs and color palettes.

Keep doing what youre doing, Monogatari. Youre at the top of your game.

[Know what else is pure white with a red circle?](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Japan_flag_-_variant.png) More fuel for the theory that Nadeko's guilt/victim complex is a commentary on Japanese society in general.
>> ARTICLE
I think something worth noting in this conversation was also how Shinobu belittled her and said she's only second best to her. 

We can assume that Nadeko's gone through her whole life always being called cute and always thought of last (or second) and holding the least importance. She became class prez because of the trouble in the class, suddenly she's thrown in the light with all of this responsibility she was never meant to handle. Before that she was the 'quiet' and 'shy' one. She's becoming important to the world around her as the story progresses, being given power/spotlight she never really intended to have. She lived her life going with what worked best for her but now that her surroundings are coming into play, it's like she's dealing with it the only way she knows how, by getting sucked into her own ignorance and anxieties.

>> ARTICLE
[These stairs](http://i.imgur.com/2PIDoJ4.jpg) are a nice little visual pun, referencing the Caduceus, the symbol of medicine of two entwined snakes.

I really like how the snake apparition is being handled.  Monogatari's been dealing with so many apparitions for so long by now that we've kind of gotten used to our characters living with them - Hanekawa still has her neko spirit, Shinobu and Araragi are bros now, etc.  The supernatural has become ordinary for these guys, but not for Nadeko, which makes her viewpoint a wonderful change of pace.  We've already been told that humans are rarely simply the 'victims' of apparitions, but Nadeko continues to insist that she's being forced by the snake, even as the directing continues to subtly suggest that maybe Nadeko's just a crazy person talking to voices in her head.

I had mentioned how last week's episode really used different visual language to reflect Nadeko's internal distress and alienation, while this week the really interesting stuff is mostly in the script.  The snake is perfectly accurately voicing all of Nadeko's unallowable thoughts and resentment of authority, "why is the teacher making 'you' do this, isn't it his responsibility?!"  And it's a great touch that we see the great big snake, and then we see the scrunchy that Nadeko keeps holding long conversations with... But we never see the snake turn into the scrunchy.  TV is representative, it would suggest to the audience that yes, it really is magic, and the snake is real.  Instead the frame constantly reminds us that this is a girl having a long discussion with a white scrunchy while her hand mimics the shape of a snake.  

Also it's an interesting testament to Nadeko's passivity that she's literally the only person in the class who didn't buy a charm, and that she thinks thats the only reason she was chosen for the position.  The only value she seems to hold for herself is in being cute and unobjectionable, even while saying how much she hates that.  Her monologues are quite happy to spell out all of her unhappiness and anxieties (and boy does she have a lot) but as soon as anyone tries to talk to her about it she immediately clams up and denies, even when Araragi was giving her a pretty pitch perfect, "Hey I'm always willing to listen" speech.  Now she's got a possibly imaginary snake conveniently saying what she wants to, while she still gets to remain agenda-less.  Hopefully snakey doesn't start telling her to start fires next week.

whoop, that got long!
>> ARTICLE
Remember the first episode of this arc. She is going all out already and now we are having backstory. What could happen that would make her lose it completely? I think there is only one explanation to all that happens - [speculation, might become spoiler later](/s "she learns about Senjougahara. I don't think there is a better way to make her snap. Araragi's relationship isn't that public and we know that Nadeko doesn't see him that often. This would be an excellent catalyst to her snapping out of pretending to be a victim and going full on medusa mode")
>> ARTICLE
Even though I doubt it will happen, I'd love it if Nadeko's big crazy medusa scene is actually just her violent fantasizing.  A final confrontation which is actually her realizing that none of this snake stuff is real would be preeeetty interesting
>> ARTICLE
Well monogatari isn't know for pulling things like that. I mean you could make arguments, that most of this stuff is metaphorical and none of it actually happens, but when it comes to what's shown on screen, I think that we will never see something like that. Of course I might be completely wrong and people who've read the novels would be laughing at me. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, the snake really is a fantastic metaphor. When she's by herself, her internal monologue is dominated by the voice complaining about how unfair everything is, but in anyone else's company, that voice/character disappears entirely into her defensive facade. And it's not like people attacking her for internalizing everything is going to make her stop internalizing everything - that only makes her more defensive.

Really excited to see where they go with this.

THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR! CUTENESS DECONSTRUCTED! This is why I love Nisioisin, taking the cute trope and just ripping it to shreds with a graceful and subtle self-awareness. Its like asking the girls from K-on how they're that good without ever apparently practising or interrogating a shounen protagonist about how they all seem receive mercy from their enemies or conveniently grow stronger after each defeat. All the things a viewer might just dismiss as part of the genre are focused on and torn up bit by bit. The best part being, there's a lot more to come.
>> ARTICLE
I'm excited. I was waiting for this conversation between Shinobu and Sengoku because I wanted to see how well they could execute such a great yet simple conversation and now I'm antsy just waiting for the [spoilers](/s "Tsukihi and Sengoku conversation and haircut scene.")

Judging by the way emotions were elicited from me in this conversation, I might explode during the next episode.

>> ARTICLE
Sengoku needs to talk to Hanekawa.  They have similar issues, except Hanekawa's resolved hers.  Unrequited Araragi love, class reps with high expectations put on them, being unwilling to ask for help(although props to Nadeko here, calling Araragi as soon as you start hallucinating is a good idea), vehemently avoiding certain topics, being 'abnormal' in their classes and social groups...

Sengoku definitely needs to be called out on her victimhood, but the persecuting mannerisms of Shinobu or Gaen are just going to make her feel oppressed.  She needs some serious Hanekawa "Hit the child, and then explain *why you hit them*" therapy, because she's a lot more helpful.  Gaen and Shinobu just make "The Reason You Suck" speeches and leave.  I feel like Hanekawa would properly stick around for a while to make sure Nadeko understands the lesson.

Also I'm just gonna assume there's no corpse, and it's being run around with Nadeko that is increasing his power.  He just vibrates from time to time to create false hope.

This show for me has been a mixed bag. On one hand it has great dialogue, but it takes a story telling format that really irritates me. Show something near the ending then back to the beginning. The beginning of the story so far is my favorite part, and I really am not to happy about having to anticipate my least favorite part of the monogatari series, the fights. 

The fights are something that I may just not understand though. Through my perspective I see repetitive not thought out encounters. Never using any of the tools at your disposal or thinking about how to go at your opponent. I'm not asking for power-ups, just maybe one thought about what one can do with what one has.

On the other hand if Arararararagi is thinking about it and doing it this way anyway at this point in the story; I would hate him. He knows the impact his death would have on the world and everybody he loves now that he has gone through the time travel arc. 

>> ARTICLE
> On one hand it has great dialogue, but it takes a story telling format that really irritates me. Show something near the ending then back to the beginning. 

This story telling format works well in the LNs but doesn't do as well visually. I agree that it is pretty irritable and could be better executed, but they are trying to stay true to their source.

>Through my perspective I see repetitive not thought out encounters. Never using any of the tools at your disposal or thinking about how to go at your opponent. I'm not asking for power-ups, just maybe one thought about what one can do with what one has.

If Kizumonogatari was out, it'd be much easier to understand why Araragi (specifically) fights the way he does. He has no combat experience at all and isn't very strategic and also generally dislikes violence and combat. In Kizu, more plans and tactics are thought out and Araragi's combat skills are more put to the test.

An example of thought out plans can be seen with Hanekawa, who is very smart. She actually (somewhat) did have a style and thought out plan when she fought Kako. In the LN the cat mentions it's 'plan' somewhat and says that it's using the tiger's huge size to it's advantage. She goes into detail about Kako and what it's other abilities as an abnormality may be so she can come up with a tactic to absorb it into herself without sacrificing too much. This was to no avail of course, as it turns out the tiger had the worst case scenario (against the Sawari Neko who's ability works by physical contact) in abilities. 
>> ARTICLE
I would definitely like the context of Kizu to be animated. Even with that I still find it annoying, but I'm willing to bet it would be forgivable considering the amount of credence your giving kizu. I just wish Araragi would consider the consequences his death would have for the people he wants to protect. Specifically Shinobu destroying the world when he dies.

Kizu is going to get animated. We just dont know when.

*Also this episode was leaked yesterday.

My thoughts:

Fucking hilarious first half. I haven't had that many laughs from Monogatari in a long while. They're staying damn true to the source and I love it! My only little issue with the episode, which honestly has nothing to do with the show really, is Gaen's VA.

What's wrong with her? Personally, I love her

She sounds too young...it put me off this time. The first time we saw her, it didnt bother me at all.

This season has a lot of...foreboding stuff going on. They introduced Gaen in the first arc, and made her exceptionally creepy. Her power seems to be some kind of limited? unlimited? omniscience. She was able to read Hanekawa completely having never met her, and she was meeting with Episode to do something which will, knowing Nisio, be important later on for various reasons. Then in Otori, she had offhandedly gave information to Oshino Ougi (another one whose motivations are unclear) with the intent to turn Nadeko into a monster (intent is hard to pin down, is someone with with foreknowledge curtailed in free will? either way she knew what the result would be). And now she's smack into the middle of this thing involving something that isn't an oddity and Shinobu's hidden past.

So what will Gaen's deal be, I wonder? Someone who is the sempai of Kagenui, Kaiki and Oshino is fearsome enough without such powers.
>> ARTICLE
My god, Hachikuji waking up and what ensued was absolutely comical. Ononoki and Shinobu with a "posed look," acting like it was completely expected.

Araragi gets creepier and creepier. I keep telling myself he's just joking but i can't lie to myself anymore. He's a pervert.

Being separated from Shinobu may be necessary for Araragi to see what his actions actually entail before he does them. In other words he will have thoughts about his thoughts before he takes action. 
>> ARTICLE
So, the pace of this arc seems like it's more drawn out than the last few. Hopefully that means they'll extend either this arc, or the next one into 5 episodes, and skip the summaries. 
>> ARTICLE
Can Monogatari top last weeks thrilling twenty-minute monologue? It seems difficult to imagine, but I guess well see. Personally, Im kind of set for this arc - that episode was impressive enough to cover my wacky formal experiments quota for the moment, and it also focused on one of the most interesting and emotionally charged relationships in the show. So I guess I can accept it if Mayoi has to go and regain consciousness or something.

**Episode 19**

0:21 - [That spotlight is continuous now.](http://i.imgur.com/g6D0HJy.jpg) So it looks like last episodes slow build has led to a point of continuous sincerity between the two of them?

1:24 - [Someone disagrees!](http://i.imgur.com/QR2T36c.png)

2:29 - [I cant possibly imagine why](http://i.imgur.com/uZVZh1h.png)

3:06 - [Youre only just noticing this?](http://i.imgur.com/aQgSsHc.jpg)

3:21 - [Total honesty: not necessarily a good thing](http://i.imgur.com/9KZqhza.jpg)

3:52 - [Godfuckingdamnit Isin](http://i.imgur.com/23Hnp49.jpg)

4:15 - [You and your goddamn double standards](http://i.imgur.com/rUjDOTS.png)

4:23 - [Theyre kind of burying it in the jokes, but this is actually a really nice direct continuation from last episode.](http://i.imgur.com/AnQqwEe.jpg) Shinobu basically bared her soul in that one - now shes being playful and irreverent, but also continuously asking, how much do you care about me?

4:51 - [Jeez, no ones letting him out of this one](http://i.imgur.com/KYLmZt1.jpg)

5:47 - [Okay, that expressions pretty fantastic](http://i.imgur.com/Po8xxKI.jpg)

5:53 - [The episode Ive earned](http://i.imgur.com/cHDtepy.jpg)

6:11 - [Araragi addresses his loli army](http://i.imgur.com/W8Ba3G6.jpg)

7:30 - [Mayoi addresses her loli compatriots](http://i.imgur.com/bZ8TgZz.jpg) 

7:50 - [Thats a nice expression](http://i.imgur.com/YLzZDOu.jpg)

8:13 - [I appreciate this.](http://i.imgur.com/Sxc2uIz.jpg) Youve had your fun, knock it off

I normally focus on the more charged stuff, but its true that this show is really good about portraying a wide variety of natural-seeming friendships. Which is obviously one of the things Isins style most naturally lends itself to - hes often accused (by me as well) of writing scenes where characters just banter about nothing, but thats kind of what friends do, and each of the relationships in this show has a character of its own beyond the different perspectives of the two individual characters involved

8:50 - [Thats adorable](http://i.imgur.com/0mUn2Ie.jpg)

9:25 - [Oh jeez oh gosh](http://i.imgur.com/2XIeBIy.jpg)

10:18 - [Heres a very nice one](http://i.imgur.com/iKXbndA.jpg)

10:25 - [No, *heres* a very nice one.](http://i.imgur.com/gEMSoAr.jpg) Theyre leaning on that spotlight very heavily in this episode it seems to still correlate to the same moments it did in Medusa, but its kinda odd to see it this consistently

10:32 - [This scene might take a little while](http://i.imgur.com/FoEJiBh.jpg). Goddamn thats a pretty background

11:16 - [Monogatari stop it](http://i.imgur.com/lvMQGNQ.jpg)

13:20 - [The show goes grayscale](http://i.imgur.com/veGXm2U.jpg) as soon as Shinobu is mentioned. Interesting

13:31 - [Capping this one, because I think were reaching the crux of this conflict.](http://i.imgur.com/taKBpHC.jpg) Araragi cant lose sight of Shinobu, but he also never really sees her, either - he doesnt acknowledge her wishes as a person. He assumes her presence - she might not be an unacknowledged part of him in the same way Hanekawas envy or Nadekos desires were, but she is connected with him and emotionally unacknowledged

14:04 - [Work work work](http://i.imgur.com/n5mRYg9.jpg)

14:19 - [You have badly injured her emotions, Araragi. Shame shame](http://i.imgur.com/pKyE99Y.jpg)

14:44 - [No better in context or out of context](http://i.imgur.com/gPy3lMC.jpg)

14:47 - [Oh my god Araragis pose](http://i.imgur.com/hA0tisH.jpg)

15:08 - [I never asked for this](http://i.imgur.com/EFoR4Zq.jpg)

15:46 - [Oshit no worst scenario Shinobuuu](http://i.imgur.com/mKxh1Du.jpg)

Great image though

16:13 - [Theyre really succeeding in making this nothing enemy very creepy.](http://i.imgur.com/9c1dqX1.jpg) So what, she went to fight it herself, then?

17:02 - [Yep, were going there.](http://i.imgur.com/V2Za076.jpg) This is actually better than arc two, since theyre not just hanging out, were actively discussing the relationship

Love the colors in this shot

17:08 - [And another nice sad one](http://i.imgur.com/ArJ2ROl.jpg)

17:55 - [And here](http://i.imgur.com/bTBGZP2.png) are the [key frames](http://i.imgur.com/eYV7WHP.png). Kind of absurd how [not-optional these frames are](http://i.imgur.com/Gg3xWp7.png)

19:22 - [A nice evening](http://i.imgur.com/9vmzowm.jpg)

20:37 - [Were *just now* reaching that point in the chronology? Gyeaaahhh](http://i.imgur.com/RautjSE.jpg)

21:10 - [Oh dont say that you know theyre all gonna be dead now or something](http://i.imgur.com/7Kc2Hf8.jpg)

22:40 - [Right, of course. Not like any civilians exist in this world](http://i.imgur.com/2ti7Vqx.png)

**And Done**

Alright then. Fine, workmanly episode - point A to point B kinda thing. I like where were *hopefully* going regarding Araragi and Shinobu, and Araragis ridiculous faces this episode were pretty great. It was kinda too plot-focused to be a standout, but it at least moved that plot in a direction Im interested in seeing explored. For an episode focused on three of the least interesting characters in this show ([thats right I said it](http://imgur.com/UKXWkle)), that certainly wasnt bad.

[What do you think this Rainbow motif we see in all the Gaen scenes means?](http://i.imgur.com/ZYYN5rk.jpg) 

[The entire scene with her lecture to Hanekawa in ep 4 was filled with it.](http://i.imgur.com/C7Dwt0I.jpg) Maybe it is something to represent her all-knowing nature, making her another entity similar to that of Ougi, pulling the strings in the background..

[Also this](http://i.imgur.com/asEIl2G.jpg). From behind her we see grayscale, facing her it's all colourful. I take this to mean she has a very two-sided nature with possibly negative intentions, apparently rainbows are an omen of Bad Luck in ancient Japanese mythology.
>> ARTICLE
Good call on that. I can't say I've seen enough of her nature to pin a meaning on it beyond being her calling card - though that contrast against the grayscale is quite interesting. The first time she appeared, she basically laid down the law on Hanekawa's false confidence, and it seems like we might be reaching a point where something similar is necessary for Araragi as well. Which supports your "all-knowing nature" hypothesis - she could be a character who isn't nearly as trapped in the monochromatic perspectives of the others, and thus can diagnose their issues from a place of multiple perspectives/colors.

Not sure, though. Guess we'll see next episode.

I love how arararararararagi is such a pervert. Even in times of trouble, his first instinct is to exploit the girls he's with.

Ononoki hesitating when they were escaping from the darkness was a little odd. You would think in this kind of situation, when everyone else is panicking, she would be as well. Was she really not concerned, or did her pause have some other implications? Something *unlikely* coming to mind is she risked something happening to Shinobu.

same here, i finished it yesterday and started with hanamonogatari today. the kaiki story came definitely unexpected and made the whole series more interesting. i would also say that bake and second season were the best parts so far (still have hana and tsuki to go) because of their deeper storylines. but overall i found it pretty enjoyable, though a bit slow at times. but the artstyle makes up for that.
>> ARTICLE
Seem people don't seem to realize that Kaiki is the real best girl. 
>> ARTICLE
The Kaki arc was done so well. I went from loathing the guy to loving him to being depressed about his death in a matter of a few episodes. One of the best character of the series, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Kaiki was really well-written. In the end, which do you think is the truth? Did senojougahara really have feelings for him 2 years ago? Why did kaiki go out of his way to destroy the cult that took her mother away?
>> ARTICLE
I think it's what the show somewhat implied. Seno was in love him and he was a good guy at heart, to a degree. At least, that's what I choose to believe.
>> ARTICLE
Remember, Kaiki specifically says that what he says might not be the truth at the beginning of Nadeko Medusa. If you haven't watched Hanamonogatari yet I suggest you do so. Keep in mind that is the last sec chronologically speaking that has been animated.

Everything after Bake has seemed a lot better than Bake for me, except the Hanekawa arcs. This all just seem really boring. Also the snail arc kinda drags in Bake
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed Bake more then SS.

Bake kept it's quality up through the entire season. I didn't really have any problem with the snail arch, but I guess I can agree that Hanekawa's arc was a bit weaker (still damn good though).

SS on the other hand didn't have enough Senjougarara and the middle of the season suffered because of it. It had amazing first and last arcs, but the rest was only "good" for me.
>> ARTICLE
Never say the second best girl arc is boring!
>> ARTICLE
Which girl do you consider second best?
>> ARTICLE
Judging by his comment, Mayoi. 
>> ARTICLE
Did Bakemonogatari feel different to you than Nise and SS? I can't put my finger on it, but Bake seemed like it was trying to be a lot more artsy, and had more of a defined narrative, I guess you could say. Still, that was fantastic as well.
>> ARTICLE
It was the introduction of all the characters and their circumstances and now they're dealing with them.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the artsy-ness of Bake can be explained by the fact that it was done on a really low budget, so Shaft decided to to a lot more tricks and stuff to try and make it look nicer, which definitely gave the show a very distinctive visual identity. By Nise, they had tons of money from Bake and Madoka, so the series lost a bit of its avant garde style in favor of more expensive animation.

I'm not a big fan of the series. I found it difficult to like any of the characters or even care about what happens to them. The humor wasn't to my taste and I wasn't very engaged in the dialogue.

Some of the arcs were really, really good. The kind of stuff that makes you glad you stuck with the franchise. But then other arcs are dead boring and uninteresting. Monogatari really is a rollercoaster ride in quality.

Just finished episode 26 of season 2 last night, and all I can say is WOW! Kaiki is ma Dude! He conned us to thinking he was the bad guy, but he was just doing what he thought was right. Also fuck Ougi!
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna get a lot of flak for this, but I just wanted to state what I thought of monogatari after binge-ing through the entire thing (bake to tsuki)... It was too artsy. The fact that it tries to be artsy and intellectual, makes me enjoy it less than if it was presented as, say, just another trope harem anime.

It tries very hard to be intellectual - to be artistic, and metaphorical, and it succeeds very well, but in doing so, it makes any kind of impact that I gain from it seem... Expected. As though just being able to explore these complex themes was not enough. 

If it were presented as something like Noragami, where on the surface it's just another slice-of-life rom-com, I think I would've enjoyed it more. Why? Because I would have no expectations of it. I would have absolutely no expectation of it exploring deep characterizations, or complex themes on justice and righteousness. And in having no expectations, it would have had a far greater impact when it *does* hit you with the theme of whichever specific arc it's currently on.

However, in being artistic - In staying aloof with the visuals and the dialogue, in creating abstract and empty backgrounds, and metaphorical dialogue, it creates an expectation. It makes the developments that would otherwise have been extremely interesting if presented differently, seem expected.

In retrospect, the stories are well written, the characters are complex, and the themes are well-explored (though it does tend to throw a lot of ideas in the air without really picking any which one, which leaves me feeling like it's kind of an empty conclusion)... But due to the expectations created by how its presented, it doesn't quite resonate with me.

I expect to be at -10 before the hour is up, but I just wanted to throw my opinion into the ring.
>> ARTICLE
TLDR: You don't like it because it's not a dumb cheaply animated show that little kids can comprehend easily like Naruto or Bleach
>> ARTICLE
That's not what I said, but if it makes you feel better, then sure.
>> ARTICLE
I have a similar but slightly different opinion. I agree that the monogatari series tries very hard to be artsy. However, beyond Bake, I found that the series pretty much devolved into harem antics and fanservice. It was more or less disguised as something deep and meaningful but it really wasn't.

It's more like by being artsy, it creates an expectation of depth. When it delivers, it merely fulfills an expectation, instead of being something to be applauded for. 
>> ARTICLE
It sounds like the only way for something to impress you is to go in expecting it to be boring/average and be surprised that it's actually good.

If monogatari was a run-of-the-mill harem show with some slightly deeper things going on I wouldn't have watched it. It's the whole package of unorthodox artistic choices that make me enjoy it. (FYI didn't downvote you despite your odd perspective.)
>> ARTICLE
Well... Yes, actually. I would say that expectations play a fairly large part in your enjoyment of something, no? If you walk into a 5 star restaurant and get high quality food, is it as enjoyable as if you walked into a no-name family restaurant, and got the same high quality food? Personally, I would find the latter more enjoyable. Objectively, the 5 star restaurant is just as good, if not better. But having it not be 5 star quality at every moment, in every dish... That leads to disappointment. It hinders your ability to enjoy the food itself, even if you are objectively aware that it's good. A no name restaurant is, I guess, more forgivable in that regard.

Objectively, I can see why monogatari is a great piece of work - but I can't say I enjoyed it as much as other, objectively worse animes. I don't expect you to agree with me on this, but I did want to try to explain my point of view as best as I could.
>> ARTICLE
True, expectations are huge. Personally, I went into the Monogatari series with low expectations because I was assuming it was overhyped, fanservicey, artistic, pretentious hogwash but ended up really enjoying it despite some of those still being pretty accurate descriptions of it.

I've definitely had shows ruined by high expectations but it's usually due to popularity (and assumed quality) rather than it looking artsy or whatever.

Totally reasonable to not enjoy Monogatari and I see where you're coming from, though.
>> ARTICLE
well first, there are no objectively good or bad anime (unless you mean critically good or bad in your opinion) and second, don't have expectations. That's just it, the moment you give in to hype you lose. Go in with no expectations and don't expect good or bad and it makes the experience way better.
>> ARTICLE
Can we not downvote everyone who politely states an unpopular opinion? It discourages discussion, and is akin to censorship.
>> ARTICLE
Just like all art (styles) there are going to be people who love it and people who loathe it. I have to disagree with you on saying it would be better as just another trope harem anime, though. I'm not really a fan of bland tropey harems and I really appreciate how the Monogatari series uses art to create something different from the norm. I'm sure a lot of others will agree with me too.

Anything that is exceptional will set high expectations for things that follow. It's just how it is. I see where you're coming from having marathoned the entire series, though. I think Monogatari is a series that shouldn't be marathoned as a whole, but by arcs or seasons instead. The art style definitely gets repetitive and expected, but when you take breaks in between arcs or seasons it also brings something to look forward to when starting up again. It's like eating your favorite food every day vs having it every once in a while.
>> ARTICLE
I personally liked Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari much more. I can't really point my finger at what SS did differently but for some reason I liked it less.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the length of the season factored into it?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe. But I don't remember getting bored it anything so I doubt it.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely enjoyed Bake over SS. It was more consistent in quality and direction.

Nise was good, but compared to Bake, it felt like it didn't do anything new (ok, it had a toothbrush scene, that was new). But, good again. But still good.

SS felt very inconsistent in quality of arcs. Some were absolutely amazing (Hitagi End), some were almost boring.
>> ARTICLE
You liked Nise more because of the toothbrush scene. Don't lie.

It was the best oral hygiene scene in anime.

The thing about monogatari is that it's BY FAR NOT entry level.  A lot of great shows are something you can show anybody and they'll enjoy. FMA, Cowboy Beebop, etc.  Monogatari is a complicated show I would only show to viewers very well versed in the medium. 
>> ARTICLE
Completely disagree. I know plenty of people that have only watched one or two dubbed anime that are popular with westerners and they've completely understood Monogatari and gotten most of the jokes.
 
"Entry level anime" is such a stupid term. That's like saying "Oh he shouldn't watch that movie, it's not entry level."

>> ARTICLE
Why is it a stupid term? You wouldn't show Monogatari to anyone who doesn't understand anime and it's tropes, unless you're prepared for "the fight scene is like 2 seconds wtf" or "wtf is this hentai?"
>> ARTICLE
I really liked MSS, like for me its Bake=MSS>Nise=Hana>Neko. Hitagi end>every other chapter untill Kizu.

Yet my friend only likes Bake and hates everything else because "Its the same thing all over again, the animation getting worse and worse, hurr durr, i fucked your mom", what do you think about that?

Also fuck this Ougi - thing, i hope its end up that its some kind of evil spirit pretending to be Oshino's relative and then Meme comes back and saves the day.

And what do you think about Kaiki? I like to think that he is 'positive' character, despite being conman.

It's an interesting thing to translate. Usually the joke starts as '' *kamimashita* then goes to '' *kamimamita* 

So how would a translator show that extra syllable and maintain the verbal humor? 

All in all, the monogatari series has some of the hardest lines to translate because almost all of the plot AND humor revolve around clever word play. 

It's a nightmare to translate wordplay into English (or any language) and try to maintain clarity. 

Like the wordplay for Mayoi is how her anomaly/oddity is called a *mayoi ushi* or , literally 'lost cow'. One of the ways you can write snail in Japanese is  , *kagyuu*. The word play here is that they share the kanji  *ushi*, literally cow. 

The word for snail () also has connotations of spirals and is part of the word for the spiral shaped part of the ear (). 

This connotation of spirals is another piece of word play that plays into how Mayoi is always lost or 'going around in circles'. Bet that just blew someone's mind. 

Almost all the best parts of monogatari are the moments when you're reading or watching and you the dawning moment of realization of that particular anomaly's wordplay.  

It becomes immediately apparent in the novels and anime if someone knows Japanese but I don't know how the subs handle it. If the fan subbers tried at all to explain the wordplay, they had their work cut out for them, that's for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
Second Series was by far my favorite, I feel this only because of how the previous seasons developed each character and this season was the next stage of knowing more about the characters.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, especially the Nadeko Medusa arc. I've never seen the story of a descent into insanity told in such a fascinating way, in any medium.
>> ARTICLE
Bake:  
Gives quite a nice intro to the main female characters and established the relationship between Arararagi(sorry, I stuttered) and Senjougahara.

Nise:  
Continues a bit of character development of previous development, but main focuses are the Fire Sisters, Shinobu and Kaiki. More romance development.

Neko:  
Good backstory for Hanekawa that filled up some of the plotholes in Bake.

2nd season:  
Many twists and turns from the previous seasons, characters like Shinobu, Nadeko, Kaiki and Yotsugi have more character developments that gives every character a an equal pace about their backstories and interaction with Araragi.

Now all we need are Hana and Kizu to fill in the gaps before proceeding on to next arcs. Overall it was a nice series to watch, some arc are a bit long while some are a bit short, but they even out in the end. I just hope that the next few arcs won't be too depressing for me to take.

Also Kaiki is Best Girl.

i love em and think SHAFT is doing a great job. story-wise i prefer bake but overall i found nise to be most enjoyable. SS was great too but its the only one i havent rewatched yet.

i'm also reading the kizumonogatari LN right now. i have a feeling that will be my favorite ^^^if ^^^they ^^^ever ^^^fucking ^^^release ^^^it
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why, but the intro synopsis of Kizu gets me all goosebumps. 

> I think it's about time I talked about Kiss-Shot-Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade. I believe it's something I have to do. I met her in the spring break between my second and third years of high school. That meeting had such impact and was also quite devastating.

It just have this feeling that it will probably be the most epic story out of all in terms of size. Araragi turning into a vamp and all. Also, from the preview in the first episode of Bakemonogatari. I haven't read the novels yet though, I'd really just sit and wait and let SHAFT take me for a ride.

**WARNING: Long post and spoilers incoming.** 

To start with: Monogatari (Bakemonogatari in particular) is the anime that brought me into anime as a medium. So my words may be somewhat (completely) biased as Monogatari is my favourite series. 

I think Monogatari is all about saying usual things in unusual ways. Remember what Kaiki said to Araragi at the end of Koimonogatari (the last arc of the second season)? "I did nothing special, just said some obvious things". It is not about sending the message to us (though the messages are often on spot), but about the way *how* this message is presented to us. Another strong feature is its dialogues. Koyomi and Tsukihi talked for about ten minutes about love at the start of Nekomonogatari, but I was everything but bored. The dialogue was bizzare and had some unexpecting twists in it, but it was always on spot and never went too far from the main point - Koyomi's feelings towards Hanekawa. And this is only one example that came to my mind.

Now I can sing songs of prase to Shaft, but I'll try to make it short: Shaft did amazing, even outstanding job. Even if you end up not liking Monogatari, you know - that anime was something special, out of place, strange, odd. They made it memorable. I know, many were annoyed by all these flashy frames with (almost) meaningless text, but to me it made sense and added some charm, uniqueness. I think it is the best Shaft's visual work for today (SZS is really close, but it is a different story).

Breaking down the series:

**Bakemonogatari** was a complete blast for me. The relationship between Araragi and Senjougahara seemed odd and sincere at the same time. Yes, their relations are somewhat bizzare, but you can completely see *why* they are so strange. While I see Hitagi Crab as an introduction story, Mayoi Shail is where Araragi and Senjougahara interaction is in bloom (by the way, I think it is the best arc in the Bakemonogatari). To say the least - I was moved. Suruga Monkey and Tsubasa Cat are also great, superb stories that were focusing on some other great characters and their (jealosy and hiding the truth from yourself, known problems, huh?) troubles. Only Nadeko Shake was somewhat moderate, but Araragi and Hanekawa dialogue at the library made up for that. Oh, and the soundtrack was something special too. Listening to it once in a while. 

**Nisemonogatari**... well, to be honest, I was disappointed. It is not a bad anime by no means, but it is a step backward comparing to almost-flawless Bakemonogatari. The arcs were good, but not something special and pretty long (large part of the Karen Bee our fellow Koyomi was visiting his harem and just derping). New characters (Kaiki and especially Kagenui and Ononoki) were not quite interesting and deep at that particular moment (however Karen was shown really well). Fanservice... I don't mind it, but sometimes it was just too over the top. If Bakemonogatari was good at delivering fanservice, Nisemonogatari crossed the line when it was not enjoyable but disturbing experience. Do I think it could be better? Yes, I do. But what we get is also pretty nice.

**Nekomonogatari: Kuro** is a great prequel. I think it is harder to make a prequel than a sequel due to necessity in tying up the ends with the parent story, and Nekomonogatari was a perfect prequel in this sense. We've got some amazing (as always) dialogues, terrific story and reasoning why Araragi is so attached to Hanekawa (not to mention that she became really good character). There was a fanservice, yes, but the focus was on something else. By the way, OP was beautiful.

I was so afraid of a **second season of Monogatari**. My expectations were so high that I was almost sure that I will be disappointed one more time. Little did I know that I was totally wrong. To my mind, Second Season even surpassed Bakemonogatari. A Monogatari fan got all that he could imagine in his wettest dream: fleshing out old characters (Hanekawa became most developed charactrer in the series), bringing to life some other (DAE Kaiki best girl?), introducing mysterious new (Ougi and Gaen) and some incredible good stories. Nadeko, who was always looked at as a loli-part of Araragi's harem, became one of the best characters in the series. Same goes to Shinobu. I bet everyone was tearing up a little (or not a little) when Hachikuji left Araragi and when Senjougahara was trying her best to solve the problem with Nadeko. I think one of the strongest points of the Second Season was that the first time series was not only Araragi-driven, but we saw different points of view. It helped us to learn more about Hanekawa, Nadeko and Kaiki and internal motives of their actions.

I can talk about Monogatari for hours (shoutout to my friend who is also into anime and who always patiently listens to me). As I said, Monogatari is the first reason why I even love anime, why I'm even here. I completely understand that Monogatari is not for everyone and not everyone would end up enjoying it. But I think, at least, this anime is *special*. Hopefully not only for me.

P.S. Expecting Hanamonogatari and Kizumonogatari is so bittersweet experience.

P.P.S. Sorry for any mistakes, not a native speaker.

So I can tell that you agree that it would be better for earth to crash into mars while the sun turns into a black hole (even though it isn't supposed to do that)  than any dun of this anime be made.

as far as I'm concerned, this subreddit has a huge circlejerk going on with Monogatari, myself included. I **loved it** because it's a story about *bad* or *flawed* people, I mean, Araragi is a pedophile, Hitagi is cold and can be quite obsessive, Araragi sisters have a huge brother complex etc etc

Okay, thank you.
>> ARTICLE
You know that a series has great characters when simply uttering the words "best girl" can lead to large discussions and heated debates. Personally I don't think that any of the characters are bad. At all. In fact its probably my favourite cast of characters from any anime. They all have separate personality flaws that get addressed as their character develops, and since one of the shows main aspects is character development I think its executed excellently. 

As for the one I find most entertaining that would have to be second season as that was when we really got to see these characters change, and for some, very drastically. As well as answering a few questions from previous instalments it also opened up a lot more questions and theories about the show that I am excited to see get resolved in later arcs. 
>> ARTICLE
There is no debate over "best girl". It is unanimously kaiki.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite anime series undoubtedly. I think it's a close tie between Bake and SS. Bake was just really distinct in it's general feel and I really liked the character introductions. Some people say that Bake was more of a set up, which to some extent I agree but it's so damn good that even if it's set up it stands on it's own. I also really like Bake for having Oshino who was one of my favorite characters and I'm excited to (hopefully) see him back in Kizu (whenever the hell that is coming out). I also really like Bake for episode 12. Yeah, best episode.

Second Season was also fantastic for it's building and improvement upon the "set up" of Bake. I think some of the best parts are how it just messes with your perspective on characters. The first arc is completely devoid of the MC until the last episode, and it really plays on your perspective. This is even more notable in the last arc when we gain a completely new perspective of our favorite characters through Kaiki. There were also tons of amazing Shinobu moments. And even a really heartbreaking moment... 

There's just so much to this series that it's hard to put all of it in one comment. I just can't wait for the eventual releases of Kizu and Hana!

>> ARTICLE
Actually rewatching Bake right now and it's even better on rewatch. So many little details and visual cues missed the first time. It *has* been 5 years too, so my perspectives have changed a bit. 

IMHO the character development in this series is among the best in the medium. Bake set the tone, introduced the characters with small hints to their past and future directions. Nise I didn't like as much (lel fanservice), but was still good. Then Second Season came along and blew me the fuck away with the amount of development. It did for the other characters what Bake did for Senjougahara. 

Definitely one of my favorite series.

Monogatari Second Season, because of the last arc. 

Kaiki is shown as the exact opposite of the hero at that part, failing at a situation and worsening it where Araragi overcame it (Senjougahara) and winning where the hero lost and overcame it [](/s "(Nadeko)"). Also, their ideals and way of thinking are completely different - while one admits defeat easily after analysing the proper situation, the other just goes face first into it. One wonders what he might win with it, the other doesn't bother at it. One is trustworthy by his friends the other even warns the public not to trust his own narrations or his own story.

I feel like the Monogatari Series has the best use of fan service I've ever seen in all of anime. It's some high quality stuff that's for sure.

Take away the awkward and unnecessary sexualization of young girls and I'd consider the series perfect. Characters are phenomenal, and the series somehow manages to make what's mostly a bunch of talking genuinely exciting and interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I just binged the series over the last week and a half. I've tried to watch it a couple of times previously, but found myself really put off by the flashing text and some of the lazy animation. The animation in particular, it tended to go from looking just goddamn stunning to being a completely frozen or BARELY moving frame with text. I get that it's probably going for the artsy look, but...That can definitely be off-putting before you get used to it.

I'm glad I gave it another chance, because once I managed to get past the first couple of episodes...Well, like I said, binged it in a week and a half. The characters, the story, the art (again, when it puts forth an effort), beautiful. And now I finally understand why I keep hearing references to toothbrushes. You perverts.

Yeah, the only way it can be 6 episodes is if they drag it out, and they typically don't do that.

The oh-so infamous scene in Nise. But honestly, besides that, Shaft can be pretty bad at pacing sometimes. I felt like Kabuki was just an absolute mess, but that was expected. All arcs really deserved 5 episodes. It sucks that they couldn't make it work. 
>> ARTICLE
They compensated by not inserting any sister jokes in monogatari2. There was a lot of those in the books. Basically, the whole second season is one big story of how we should be really concerned about what's going on at Araragi's home, plus some adventures here and there to ligthen the moods.

It' based off of light novels, and those are just finishing up. So, in the future we have Kizumonogatari movie, Hanamonogatari OVA (was supposed to be this season, but was left out), and a future 3rd season.
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely see why Hana wasn't part of this season. It's actually the farthest out chronologically of all the released novels. Frankly I'm not sure how Isin plans to wrap up the series with only two more novels unless the next ones are long as hell. 
>> ARTICLE
Hana does serve have foreshadowing to later stuff though, such as Ougi's true nature. Now that Hana is gonna be released later, [the impact of](/s "male Ougi") is kinda gonna be lost.

There's also [foreshadowing of](/s "Kaiki's stuff throughout Koi") in Hana. This season is gonna have an abrupt ending without it...
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah forgot about that first point. Then again losing impact is something we're familiar with already. The last arc relied so much on knowledge of Kizu. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn it SHAFT!
>> ARTICLE
Have Nisio hinted or said what he will work on after?
>> ARTICLE
He usually does whatever he feels like. Monogatari started out as a hobby to fill in the time. Hell, one of the most recent books had this line from Nisio: ""This novel was written 100% out of whim."
>> ARTICLE
For a book written on a whim, [Koyomimonogarati](/s "There were some pretty fucking huge events though I guess those will have to fixed before Hana unless he decides to retcon it.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, dat ending especially.
>> ARTICLE
[Can't watch that gif after the last ep...](http://i.imgur.com/HYkqC.gif)

What about Snake arc? if I remember correctly didn't "end"
>> ARTICLE
This will continue Nadeko Medusa and there are so many great things about this arc
>> ARTICLE
About that...
>> ARTICLE
They must have realized how much pain they caused us last week and instead of making us relive that pain, they are just going to give us the next arc. Good guy Monogatari crew. I just cannot relive what I saw last week.
>> ARTICLE
Taking Hachikuji away was like a hard kick to the nuts. A sharp pain at first then a dull throbbing pain that never quite goes away.
>> ARTICLE
I will be sad when this series ends.
>> ARTICLE
So 5 episodes of Koimonogatari, and the last episode will be a recap? There's no way Koi can be 6 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't Karen Bee like 8 episodes? Why can't it be 6?
>> ARTICLE
I'm operating under the assumption that Hanamonogatari is going to be 4 episodes. It wouldn't make sense to remove it from this season and air recaps instead if they were going to make an arc longer than usual. 

Of course, Hana could be 3 episodes and Koi could be 6. But I doubt it, given how quickly they've been moving through everything this season.
>> ARTICLE
Reasons why Hana could have been removed:

[Minor Spoilers](/s "It happens much later and spoils the ending for the series")

Hana is gonna be a OVA/ONA or TV special similar to Kuro. It's probably gonna be 4-5 episodes long.
>> ARTICLE
While its the latest I wasn't under the impression that it was the end. [Hana](/s "it's the end of Kanbaru's story and it does spoil Koyomimonogatari but I'm pretty sure stuff will happen after it")

Also it shouldn't be more than 4 episodes. It's not nearly as fast paced as something like Kabuki
>> ARTICLE
Kabuki was only fast paced in the anime. It's the longest book of the series so it had to be that way.
>> ARTICLE
It makes sense for it to be after for the reason you mentioned, but that wouldn't be a reason to fill a series with recap episodes. The recap episodes indicate a rushed production, because they obviously initially planned for a 26 episode series. Otherwise, why buy 26 episodes worth of tv slots? 
>> ARTICLE
They filled it in with recaps because they scrapped Hana out at the very last second. I assume they also used that time to help make better quality stuff. I think it's been mentioned before that some folk over at Shaft admitted to being unable to handle 2-cour shows.

Minor Nitpicking- Monogatari came before Durarara!! Atleast the anime did.

Other than that a pretty damn solid review.

BTW for anyone planning to pick this up the [rewatch](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2z607c/monogatari_series_rewatch_update/) starts April 1st. Barring it's not some elaborate set up for an april fools day prank.

I can't tell if your MAL is a troll.

Dude you and me have the exact same scores for all of the Monogatari series 

[](#araragi-1)
>> ARTICLE
Kirito is an interesting protogonist, yet calls HxH a generic shounen! Definitely not a troll. /s
>> ARTICLE
Eh. In a lot of key areas, HxH was pretty generic. Not like, Dragonball Z nostalgia levels of generic, but it could have been better.
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Is it a or b? surprise, it's the unstated third choice") they used that like 3 or 4 times in the test arcs that I just stopped.
>> ARTICLE
That was the whole point of the test arc. It showed that they were able to think outside of the box, a skill which will prove to be invaluable all the time. 

All I can say is that you're missing out on one of the most thought provoking, well executed, well thought out *shounen* anime ever made.
>> ARTICLE
He isn't saying that it isn't the point. He is saying its an overused trope in the anime, which is accurate.

It also ignores the point that thinking within the box is a skill just as, if not more important, then thinking outside the box.
>> ARTICLE
Except that it really isn't. Both HxH and real life will hardly ever give you A or B questions. Infact, real life will often not even tell you you have options. Thinking outside the box is infinitely more versitile and useful.

Saying "hidden option 3" is an overused trope is like saying that fighting or character growth are overused tropes. If you think so, you're in the wrong genre.

But I wasn't judging the guy or anything, all I was saying that it's to bad that he gave up on it so soon, since it really is one of the best animes ever made, especially the Chimera Ants arc.
>> ARTICLE
I never said thinking outside the box was not important, just that thinking within the box is just as, or possibly more important. 

Thinking outside the box isn't ignoring A or B and choosing C, but ignoring the limitations that you set on yourself to solve a given situation. This is important to do, but equally important is to realize and understand the external limitations of a situation that you have to work with and find a solution that will work within the confines of that limit.

Thinking outside the box is generally a misnomer. You aren't outside the box, your just making the box as big as possible. You still need to fit your solution in the box.

Good review one of my top 5 anime

Kaiki certainly is best girl.  He was absolutely great in both Hitagi End and Hanamonogatari.  Even though I wasn't a huge fan of him in Nisemonogatari, he definitely ended up redeeming himself.

If only I could convince my wife to sit down and watch it all coz I really need to catch up but she refuses to watch it. 

Maybe one day she'll realise that senjougahara is best girl. 
>> ARTICLE
I am not sure how this is a review/recommendation, but just a long write-up on what the Monogatari series is about. You didn't really give your perspective on the show and *why* the reader should watch it.

Also: can someone help me "appreciate" the Monogatari series? I have only watched Bakemonogatari and it seems like a well-animated, but very boring show overall. 

Why do people love it so much? What am I missing? Or are people just blinded by beautiful characters needing to be rescued?
>> ARTICLE
I kinda fell into the same trap when watching bake, I thought the show was taking Araragi's side and saying he was right to go around saving everyone. It's only in second season where the ramifications of his actions become clear. All I can say is that the show really does an amazing job with its characters.
>> ARTICLE
Watch the stories, understand the characters, then pick your favorite AND DEFEND HER TILL YOU DIE! Probably excessive but only then will you truly appreciate the series.

I chose Shinobu. I appreciate when the show supports me by giving me material to work with. When the show shows other women, I think of it as competition. It wouldn't be fun if everyone knew Shinobu was best girl. Let the fools settle for less. I've already won.

.....ahh what have I become?
>> ARTICLE
I do not think the tendency of some to compare Shinobu to Senjougahara as direct competitors is fair to either of them.

Their appeals are different.  One is remarkable for what she is while the other is most remarkable for what she is not.

Shinobu is Arararagi's other half.  They are joined at the mind and the heart, and require close physical proximity for the benefit of the world itself.  She completes him in an odd way; that being that he would most certainly be dead many times over if not for her.  She is the bite to his bark, the firepower to his posturing.  Araragi does what he feels and challenges all threats.  His single urge is to protect, to care (and also to grope).  He has the fighting prowess of a normal human and gets his ass kicked constantly.  Good thing he has the healing prowess of a vampire.  Shinobu is the stick behind his gentle guidance.  It is likely no coincidence that her body is the perfect representation of one which triggers the urge to protect in him.

Shinobu is not a competitor in any real sense because they are rapidly growing to become one single entity.  What's even more amazing is that he fully understands and accepts this.

Do you love your girlfriend more than your right arm?  Is that even a legitimate question?

Senjougahara is different.  She is alarmingly-close to being (some people's...to include myself) a solid depection of the perfect woman.  She is strong, assertive, deeply loving, dedicated, scary-intelligent, romantic, resilient, protective, appreciative, powerful, witty, wily, and perhaps most impressive...a normal woman.

I understand her draw.  She is Batman.  She is the superhero with no special abilities, yet all her abilities are special.  In a world of supernatural phenomena she fights, AND WINS, using only the tools that we ourselves have.  Her exploits are legendary.  She brain-fucked a god while in the same conversation declaring her hatred for that same entity.

She is universally seen as intimidating and is respected by all who meet her.

Lastly, it is not a competition because both have the capacity to accept one another, and love Araragi enough to do so.

If I could have anything in the whole wide world of Anime it would be an episode where Araragi announces that he has to go somewhere alone for a few days, and that even Shinobu cannot accompany him, and he asks Senjougahara to look after her for him.  It would take only a brief conversation for each to realize that they love one another.  Shinobu loves Hitagi because she has spent so long sharing his emotions of love towards her that she feels them herself without his aid.  Hitagi loves Shinobu because she recognizes that her love for him has been at least in part to Shinobu's influence in his life.  he is stronger because of Shinobu, more confident, and most of all Shinobu feels like him.

Araragi would have a few inner dialogue scenes imagining them fighting and engaging in intellectual battles accentuated by some of the most poetic threats and insults imaginable.  He would wonder whether he should return early.

He would return to find that, if anything, he should have spent his time away in a fit of jealousy...of both of them.  He finds that Senjougahara has had no trouble filling his role as cuddle/bathing-buddy, and is terrified at the idea that he could be replaced...by both of them, before realizing that the perfect answer includes all three of them.

Perhaps cheezy and wreaking of fan service, but a guy can dream...
>> ARTICLE
I'm envious of the relationship Shinobu and Araragi has. Often has a wife or husband been called "your other half" and to see it in the most literal sense it really is quite like love. Not to say Araragi is particularly enamored with Shinobu, but I feel as if they were seperated they would miss each other or feel a bit more lonely.


As for Hitagi, its not a competition for Araragi's love. Its a competition for the viewers'. Hitagi is probably the biggest competitor thanks to Bakemonogatari and a few scenes from the others. Her nearly obsessive yet careful nature is definitely something reminiscent of what I can imagine the perfect girl might be like. I don't really like her style though, what a shame.


Thats a very specific dream you got there buddy. Why don't you write a fanfic or a (i think its called) doujinshi . It might please an audience that likes that sort of thing. Its pretty elaborate and it looks like you have the scenes all in your head already.
>> ARTICLE
Very well put.
>> ARTICLE
The beauty of Monogatari lies in its depth; while you could go through the show and just gawk at the pretty animation and strange use of colored frames for transitions, the more you look into its word play and character interaction, the more rewarding the show is. When people ask me what my favorite show (Monogatari) is about, I have the pleasure of responding "there's probably a plot, but it's just there to allow the characters to interact with each other," because Monogatari is so dam good at understanding the the dynamics of people.
>> ARTICLE
For me it was a combination of the visuals along with great dialogue. 
>> ARTICLE
> can someone help me "appreciate" the Monogatari series?

That is the point of this post. What better way to communicate *why* a reader should watch the show, indroducing the many elements of the show that entertain.
>> ARTICLE
> Or are people just blinded by beautiful characters needing to be rescued?

This is it, guys. The jig is up. /u/HyperLaxative has got us all figured out, time to pack it in. Trash the BDs and burn the body-pillows! Every man for himself!

>Also: can someone help me "appreciate" the Monogatari series?

To appreciate Monogatari, you have to accept that idea that the "story" has almost nothing to with Overt Plot. It is a Character Drama in the truest sense. A drama about adolescence and self-identity; about moving forward and letting go. It's about how we build up realities, but tear ourselves down. Monogatari is not a story about actual narrative, it's a story about actual people. Dynamic people with complex flaws, nuanced personalities, and contradictory desires. It is also occasionally about boobs and lolibutt. Nothing's perfect. Monogatari does feel like it comes pretty damn close sometimes, though. 
>> ARTICLE
Good explanation. I feel like Monogatari does a better job demonstrating human interaction and struggles than real-life dramas do.
>> ARTICLE
This is pretty well written and I'm suprised the post isn't that popular. I'm fairly conflicted as to whether or not its worth showing to someone I'd like to take interest in the show, as you said, it contains spoilers. So I don't really know what this is all for.
>> ARTICLE
/r/Anime has a weird opinion. Granted it is a lot of people, but my Ping Pong review and Director spotlights didn't do much better. If I put the WT! tag on, maybe I'd get more notice but this doesn't really fit into that criteria.

As far as the spoilers. I tried very hard to have 0 spoilers that would actually devalue the experiece, with exception for the Rainy Devil fight... that is probably a big spoiler to people. I've shown this to people who have seen the series, and others who have not. So far I'm 4/4 on people not seeing it before and then picking it up to see after reading this. So, unless they are a "spoiler baby" who cant stand knowing anything, I think this works as a review. 
>> ARTICLE
when you say wide cast, do you mean it has characters with a wide range of personalities or that it has many characters? this is just so i can understand what wide cast means, because i seen it in other reviews
>> ARTICLE
Lots of characters given focus. I'd probably use "wide cast" for anything with more than 5 characters given focus/arcs.
>> ARTICLE
In this case you could say.. both. 
There are a lot of characters, and all of them have amazing character development throughout the series.

EDIT: ... and couldn't be more interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Minor point of order: Shinobu's avatar creature is correctly Devil rather than Vampire.

*That could be wrong seeing as how I have not read the light novels and rely only on the Anime.  If it is correctly "vampire" in the novels then I stand corrected.

Really liked your write-up.  It in insanely difficult to convey the nuance of monogatari succinctly, and I think you've done as good a job as I've seen.

Also, I think the younger sister may be more correctly Bird, as she is not a phoenix.

*again, could be wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! 

Ya I originally had them named other things, but in Tsukimonogatari they list them as Vampire/Pheonix so I went with it.
>> ARTICLE
It's vampire in the novels that I read but that could be a translation thing

And the younger sister is a Phoenix but the oddity acts much like a cuckoo
>> ARTICLE
Ah,  I took their using "dying cuckoo" to mean that it was not a phoenix, but something altogether different.  Thanks for clarifying that.

Yay, peace peace! ...I said with a posed look.

Hanekawa's arc in Bakemonogatari should be Tsubasa Cat, not Tiger.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, thanks for bringing that to my attention!
>> ARTICLE
Second Season has 26 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
3 of them are recaps, though.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, personally I think that Hana should be watched after the first 2 arcs of SS, which is the book order. [Ougi](/s "not being human") is foreshadowed there, [and](/s "I feel that Kaiki's development progresses nicer that way, plus his relationship to Suruga is good to know for Koi.")
>> ARTICLE
To me it would be strange because of the whole [spoiler tag just to be safe](/s "they're not here anymore thing in Hana (you know, Senjougahara and Araragi not attending the school anymore cause they're finished with it)") and suddenly [again spoiler tag to be safe](/s "they are back in school again in the whole Kaiki x Sengoku arc.").

Maybe it's just my personal dislike with time jumps but yea, that would bother me the most if I had watched it in your suggested order
>> ARTICLE
It jumps around with the time anyway even if you watch Hana last, and the same problem will exist when we get season 3.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, watching Hana after MonoS2 felt really unbalanced, I immediately thought that it would have fit a lot better in the proper LN release order.

I don't think Suruga Devil spoils anything, since it was written and released first all it shows is information you're already supposed to know when you get to the arcs after it. Koimonogatari is really the ultimate climax for S2 that the entirety of Second Season (including Hana) leads up to. In fact, watching it in Shaft's order feels somewhat disjointed with things in Hana that were meant to be build up and foreshadowing for things later on in the season losing their purpose.

That said if they *had* to remove an arc from the original airing to animate and air later, Hana was really the only choice. But if I had to pick now that all of them have aired, I'd probably watch Hana the way you mentioned. I think the LN order warrants a mention in watching guides such as this.
>> ARTICLE
I would disagree. Even though the book was released between Kabuki and Oni, I think it ruins the surprise of the [Major Spoiler for Monogatari Series Second Season](/s "Kaiki thing.")
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'd rather good progress over surprises (plus it still is a surprise even if you see Hana first). If you do the anime release order, then Hana kinda repeats the same stuff you find out in Koi. If you do book order, then you find out stuff in Hana and then even more in Koi.
>> ARTICLE
I just don't think the LN order works as well in the anime. Personally I felt they made a better decision (in terms of visual entertainment and such) to show Hana after Koi as it plays up a lot of the drama and it makes for a better *anime*.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I think I just have to say that we disagree then and move on.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed.

New arc! *Man* has this season been some good Monogatari. I think Neko Shiro is probably my single favorite arc of the show to date, and Araragi-Shinobu: Time-Traveling Zombie-Fighting Buddy Cops isnt far behind. Ive written more about this goddamn series than any other by a [fairly](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/04/14/nisemonogatari-and-the-nature-of-fanservice/) significant [margin](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/07/03/blood-ties-and-nekomonogatari/), but its generally been a show I found more *interesting* than fully coherent - the style of storytelling was very unique, and the tricks of direction were extremely compelling, but it didnt necessarily gel into a cohesive production. This season has blown that complaint away, telling vivid and compelling stories that dont lean on either Isins wordplay or Shinbos cinematography, but instead make best use of each of their strengths in tandem. And now we have the Nadeko arc.

This is gonna be interesting. In Bake, I felt her arc was basically [a biting, caustic comment](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/04/20/bakemonogatari-episodes-9-and-10-2/) by Shinbo, but Nadeko herself didnt really have any presence. These first two arcs have been well-written and well-directed, but theyve also had the benefit of leaning on two of the Monogatari universes strongest variables, Hanekawa herself and the Araragi-Shinobu relationship. Since Nadeko is so loosely define, *this* arc could go basically anywhere. So lets go on an adventure.

**Episode 12**

0:52 - [Ominous.](http://i.imgur.com/EhdiDTJ.png) Also, they really did pick the worst possible show to do this goddamn simulcast for. Pausing and rewinding for the stills is just ridiculous

1:49 - [Seriously, this player is making me resent what a gifted cinematographer Shinbo is](http://i.imgur.com/MRGD53R.png)

2:14 - [Hey, look, identity stuff](http://i.imgur.com/ZjMZYyH.jpg). Good to see you again, Isin

2:38 - [Another version of the shrine.](http://i.imgur.com/rVksXXy.png) Getting great mileage out of that one threatening light

3:45 - [This scene is one hell of a teaser.](http://i.imgur.com/LOOwVo7.jpg) Of course the rest of the episode will be Nadeko deciding which shoes to wear to school three days ago or something

3:55 - [Shinobu brings her own lighting](http://i.imgur.com/A1i5CSf.jpg)

4:20 - [So? If the snake is to be believed, were all collections of people, after all](http://i.imgur.com/44i1qTx.png)

5:30 - Whatever your thoughts on this show, you [have to admit](http://i.imgur.com/p2Uazr5.jpg) it has some [striking images](http://i.imgur.com/SikPCbO.jpg)

5:51 - [Shes taking back the steps she took forward in Renai Circulation](http://i.imgur.com/a9oasnJ.png). In Monogatari, even the OPs are meta-comments

6:22 - [Another direct callback](http://i.imgur.com/4fMkEyk.png)

7:20 - [Another story from the girls perspective.](http://i.imgur.com/Hnd39Bi.jpg) Hanekawa was easily an interesting-enough character to handle the lead role (in fact, that was one of my favorite things about that arc), but well have to see if Nadeko can do the same

8:15 - [Hello again.](http://i.imgur.com/HpS51h9.png) Still not sure where theyre going with her

8:54 - [Well *thats* interesting.](http://i.imgur.com/OoOLuYX.jpg) And she was intentionally emphasizing Nadekos name, when it seems like Nadeko feels totally isolated. Positioning herself as a catalyst. Veeery interesting

9:08 - Oshino, huh? Well then

9:29 - [Yes, very trustworthy.](http://i.imgur.com/eH86zyB.png)

9:46 - [I was gonna say](http://i.imgur.com/7pIy04k.jpg) she seems to be treating this all as a narrative she exists outside of, but Isin of course points and giggles at his own ideas

9:56 - [The uniform not fitting at all is a nice touch.](http://i.imgur.com/hfI7RK1.png) Shes a spy, but shes not very good at it

10:08 - [Another meta comment.](http://i.imgur.com/xT9n4NK.jpg) Apparitions are very rarely pure antagonists, theyre generally just reflections of their targets own psychology

10:17 - [Is this more important regarding identity or agency?](http://i.imgur.com/4ftznS2.jpg) Clearly this a girl whose every line is worth paying attention to

10:35 - [Substantial shift in the lighting.](http://i.imgur.com/x4yWfi6.jpg) Reappearance of that blinding single light source from the opening. Also sometimes people are the victim and sometimes they are the wrongdoer definitely orients this on the identity line the opening was proposing

11:22 - [Isin likes talking about stories as much as he likes writing them](http://i.imgur.com/Wn2IIpF.jpg)

11:55 - [Well, there *was* that prolonged hypnotism shot](http://i.imgur.com/rzUVSpG.jpg). What is that girls game?

12:07 - [Lovely shot](http://i.imgur.com/iTvAiLJ.jpg). Shinbos got a whole new school to design, so of course he designs it to create a moment like this

12:32 - [Interesting choice.](http://i.imgur.com/NbVsR8v.jpg) All the characters are basically alone in this world, but this is the first time weve seen actual strangers, which might be because Nadeko is the only one who *feels* alone

12:55 - [Nice effect.](http://i.imgur.com/1FV45su.jpg) Shinbo definitely knows how to manage these monologues

13:40 - [That speech got to her, I guess](http://i.imgur.com/roR1MvC.jpg). Funny that an Araragi arc can start with a monologue by her and Araragi will just think Jeez, did that mean something, or was she just making a weird joke? Eh, forget it, whereas Nadekos whole arc might very well hinge on how she was affected by that criticism

14:35 - [I wish *my* middle school had sweet pneumatic tube walkways](http://i.imgur.com/mR9sZi9.jpg)

15:07 - [It really is a great effect](http://i.imgur.com/9UJBYku.jpg)

16:07 - [Another very nicely framed shot.](http://i.imgur.com/DQOK4nm.jpg) I like the color symmetries, and how Nadekos phone is deliberately separated from the rest

17:16 - [Looove these shots.](http://i.imgur.com/6sQiq7w.jpg) The quick jumps, the lack of focus. Her anxiety comes through loud and clear

We also might be assembling some clues here. It seems that with both the charms and this current snake, Nadeko is portraying her personal desires as some antagonist forcing her in specific directions. Avoiding responsibility for her own needs. It wont necessarily go there, but it certainly fits with the victim stuff

17:39 - I was worried about Nadeko carrying an arc, but [I guess I shouldnt have been.](http://i.imgur.com/VsvaoQJ.jpg) This did I say something awkward? Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry rings pretty goddamn true.

18:28 - [Another point in cant assign responsibility to herselfs favor](http://i.imgur.com/JVGkQ3W.png)

20:32 - [Oh dear](http://i.imgur.com/Mrpxzj2.jpg)

Again with that once you see the apparition, youre doomed from Tiger. But the apparitions are obviously manifestations of subconscious problems, so

21:29 - [This one might be outside of Araragis pay grade](http://i.imgur.com/cRQZtTk.jpg)

21:36 - [Striking images ahoy](http://i.imgur.com/fDgypzt.jpg)

22:06 - [Shes now in the Circulation color scheme.](http://i.imgur.com/qkYu7JN.jpg) Please dont ask me what that could possibly signify

22:16 - [That light again](http://i.imgur.com/kudnMLI.jpg)

**And Done**

Strong first episode! Fast-paced, some really nicely portrayed characters moments, many arresting shots, and plenty to dig into both visually and narratively. I like this theme of victimhood and responsibility were apparently focusing on, and I really like how theyre portraying Nadekos anxiety. Extremely on board for this one.

[Could they possibly be stage lights?](http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh636/Orangespike/1379791405394.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Very possibly - they definitely work as a signifier of "Nadeko exposed" moments, when she is not being allowed to play the victim.
>> ARTICLE
My favourite part of this episode was how well Nadeko's anxiety is being portrayed. The quick changes of focus _you_ need to do to be able to follow along with the text-on-screen and what she's saying, during the panic panic panic bit of the phone conversation, are actually _really really_ good at getting you in her shoes.

You've been saying all along that Monogatari2 is the first time the Shinbo Style has been _deliberate_ and _coherent_, and this is possibly the best (or at least most obvious!) example of that so far. 
>> ARTICLE
I really like how they're breaking out a whole different visual style of effects with Nadeko as the protagonist.  Monogatari's obviously always been quite stylistic, but normally when we get weird bursts of fantasy from Araragi it's clearly separated from the 'real' scene, often providing the visuals to a story someone else is telling him.  

With Nadeko, who may or may not be going crazy, those stylistic bursts are treated *very* differently; they're contained in the same frame as 'reality'.  When she's walking down the hallway and text is dancing in the windows, she's disintegrating and reappearing, the hallway itself is doing weird freaky things... It's very different than anything we've seen in the series before, and it's a wonderfully unsettling effect that reflects her confused mental state.  

Similarly we almost never see non-named characters in this show (which has been used to stylish effect many times before) but from Nadeko's viewpoint we do, and they're really [pretty detailed outlines](http://i.imgur.com/9UJBYku.jpg).  Normally when we DO get those rare outlines of strangers they're super stylized or just kind of blurs, but the way they're drawn here really gives you the feeling it's representing Nadeko's viewpoint specifically.  Araragi's lack of strangers creates the feeling of a creepy ghost town, Nadeko's strangers create the sense of alienation and being alone amidst a crowd.
>> ARTICLE
Well, to be fair, we _have_ seen stuff like this before - remember the first time Araragi and Senjou walk into the abandoned cram school? With the people's heads being opened and filled with spaghetti?

But yes, I completely agree that Monogatari2 (or maybe Nisemonogatari) is/was when this stylistic stuff started to be _coherent_ and actually driving to a point, so yes, your point stands.
>> ARTICLE
That was one scene I was thinking of that doesn't quite fit, but yeah, that was more goofing off than any kind of thematic messaging.  And even then the graphics were already going all silly even before the spaghetti showed up.

Actually though you do make a good point: Usually at least some of the constant Shinbo flair is done sort of humorously, with a knowing wink at the audience.  We're just having a bit of fun while everyone talks (which actually could describe the show's general attitude towards fanservice a lot of the time too).

Part of the reason why this episode felt so different was there was absolutely no humor in the jump cuts and other visual oddities, it was all in service to Nadeko's emotional state.  We spent that episode much further inside Nadeko's POV than we usually do with Araragi.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I really like how they're blurring the line of reality more with her. Particularly with those early, barely glimpsed shots of the snake, which did seem more like delusions and less like the normally readily apparent apparitions.

Agreed on how they're using the background characters, as well. Araragi only runs into the people he knows because that's all he really cares about, but Nadeko seems to care deeply about fitting in, and so she's constantly aware of all the strangers surrounding her.
>> ARTICLE
>9:56 - The uniform not fitting at all is a nice touch. Shes a spy, but shes not very good at it

This had been tickling my brain and I finally realized what's going on here.  It's not that she's wearing ill-fitting clothes because she's a fake, it's because that's a shout-out to traditional portrayals of [Japanese ghosts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%ABrei) having no hands:

> A yrei's hands dangle lifelessly from the wrists, which are held outstretched with the elbows near the body. They typically lack legs and feet, [floating in the air](http://24.media.tumblr.com/ccf1a96541518115e059c5c854e4a70e/tumblr_mtho17nG1b1r2r59eo2_1280.jpg). These features originated in Edo period ukiyo-e prints, and were quickly copied over to kabuki. In kabuki, this lack of legs and feet is often represented by using a [very long kimono](http://i.imgur.com/HpS51h9.png).

She's always had a creepy corpse look to her, and this is another part of that.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. Does that have anything to do with Nadeko's habit (pre-this arc) of wearing that oversized jacket that hides her arms?
>> ARTICLE
Probably not, I'm guessing?  Her jacket was a shout-out to her story animal, her hat and her hood emulating the hood of a cobra.  Most of the other girls do that as well, to some degree: Hachikuji obviously has her snail-shell esque backpack and twin tail hair, Senjougahara has her pincer-like stapler, Suruga wears those bike shorts which iirc in japanese are called saru, AKA monkey.
>> ARTICLE
Oh! Hanekawa had her cat pajamas, though they may have burned up in the house fire.


>> ARTICLE
R.I.P. Hanekawa's cat pajamas

Her hair clips were of cats, too.  She's a bit less obvious than the rest of the girls though, which makes sense as her craziness takes a lot longer to get to the bottom of.
>> ARTICLE
> portrayals of Japanese ghosts[1] having no hands

That's a real interesting possibility. If it is that then id love to see how this plays out and who this (person?) may or may not be. 

I somehow don't quite buy the niece of Oshino Meme story for some reason. Everything she has said gives a "I've been told to say this so i will say it" vibe or something along those lines. But who knows i may be totally wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, did not know that. That makes me even more curious about what Isin intends to do with her in the long run, or if her presence is going to give this collection of stories some cohesion in the last act.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of have some speculation on Ougi(please LN readers don't confirm or deny). It has been made pretty obvious this arc that she seems to be some sort of time traveller or manipulator. She also made a verbal slip this episode that seems to indicate that she has been travelling through various time periods in a non-linear order. Her prophetic allusions about Hachikuji in the previous arc combined with her seeming knowledge about what is about to happen to Nadeko further compound this...

> 8:15 - Hello again.[16]   Still not sure where theyre going with her

As for that, looking at it from a reductionist point of view, she is a plot device that explains or hints about events that may occur, whether or not they will come true is up to the audience to figure out, she was wrong about Hachikuji, but the way this arc was told beginning with a scene of its "final fight" seems to imply that she was right this time.

From an in-universe point of view, I am thinking she isn't actually Oshino's niece, she is the actual Shikigami (like Yotsugi is to Yodzuru) of Oshino Meme. He might have sent her on a mission throughout time, kind of like the Doctor Who of the Monogatari universe...
>> ARTICLE
I don't think much has been revealed about Ougi at all, even in the LNs.

There are a lot of speculations going around that she was pulling all the strings in Otori and Oni, but they are just speculations.
>> ARTICLE
take a look at her mannerisms and revisit bakemonogatari where Meme speaks. now notice the way she's speaking and the things she's saying to Nadeko.. would a girl *really* have as much trouble communicating with another girl, regardless how different she may be.
back when she was speaking with Araragi she had no problem saying whatever she needed and bouncing words around. then there's the fact Oshino conveniently left, never to be heard from again except in a letter from a different timeline. her introduction was plenty strange as well, without any sort of montage with various cues and Araragi's comments on her past.

here's what i believe, solely due to her encounter with Nadeko: Oshino Ougi *is* Oshino Meme. they are one and the same person somehow, whether reincarnation.. apparition meddling.. i have no idea.
>> ARTICLE
Valid conclusion, plus yet another reason to rewatch monogatari!

There is definitely something off about Ougi, I don't know for sure whether it actually IS Meme, if they wanted to give that vibe, they could have sneaked in one of his catchphrases like "Did something good happen to ya'?". All I can say for sure that it definitely isn't his niece, a Shikigami is likely.
>> ARTICLE

Maybe it was her who kept Hachikuji alive through the "zombie apocalypse" in the previous arc. I mean, the characters even commented on how that was a pretty big coincidence. And at this point, almost anything is possible. I wouldn't be surprised if the conversation between Nadeko and Ougi ripped a hole in space-time(Nadeko simultaneously felt like she hadn't been speaking to Ougi for a long time, but she also felt like she had been robbed of time, and the clock in the background moved backwards) and created a world where Nadeko is simultaneously the snake and not the snake.

Ougi is definitely the "wildcard" of this show.
>> ARTICLE
Now that you mention it, she only became present in the story about the time Araragi's time travelling shenanigans came into play. Immediately following this arc Sengoku complains that interacting with this girl felt like she'd literally lost time. 

That conversation may have been the catalyst for the appearance of the snakes, as if without Ougi interrupting her journey to school, life would have gone on as always. As if that sliver of time she spent talking with Sengoku got in the way of a critical event that would have other wise occurred, like the way Hachikuji's absence as a ghost got Araragi killed in the alternative timeline.

Now that I actually think about it, she does mention Hachikuji in her scene, and also reveals that she pretty much knows Sengoku already. She goes so far as to say "I haven't met you yet", which is a definite hint that she's a time traveler.

In fact, how can we confirm 100% that Araragi even landed in the right timeline again? They sort of hand wave it after Hachikuji bum rushes him.
>> ARTICLE
>Now that you mention it, she only became present in the story about the time Araragi's time travelling shenanigans came into play.

Exactly. Looking back at it, it's pretty obvious that she influenced him quite a bit during that one scene. The fact that he started thinking about Hachikuji afterwards was absolutely no coincidence.

>That conversation may have been the catalyst for the appearance of the snakes, as if without Ougi interrupting her journey to school, life would have gone on as always.

I'm guessing that it's the other way around, i.e. Ougi's intervention is/was the only thing preventing the otherwise inevitable deaths of Araragi, Shinobu and Nadeko. But, I have to agree,

>As if that sliver of time she spent talking with Sengoku got in the way of a critical event that would have other wise occurred, like the way Hachikuji's absence as a ghost got Araragi killed in the alternative timeline.

this is also a very likely possibility.

>In fact, how can we confirm 100% that Araragi even landed in the right timeline again? They sort of hand wave it after Hachikuji bum rushes him.

Well, about that, Araragi basically pointed out that it's probably the right timeline and if it isn't, it doesn't matter, so I'm almost certain that the ending of the previous arc will not be continued in that way.

However, the presence of Ougi at the beginning of the time travel arc hints at the possibility that the timeline that we saw there(at the beginning, before the time travel) was not the "right one", because we hadn't seen Ougi before, yet Araragi was completely familiar with her.
>> ARTICLE
Ougi's clearly up to *something*, that's for sure.  I thought it was interesting how completely weirded out Nadeko was by Ougi during their conversation, yet immediately after that hypnosis shot only referred to it as 'running into Oshino-sempai,' which is a weird way to refer to that bizarre conversation with a complete stranger.  And then later she forgets to mention Ougi to Araragi, even though things started getting weird right after talking to her.

It reminds me a bit of Ougi's first appearance, where Araragi casually mentions her as if she's always been around, when we have *no idea* who this strange person is.

Between Ougi and the vampire hunters in town that Hanekawa ran into, there's definitely something weird going down that we're not privy to yet.

A question for light novel readers (spoilers for Onimonogatari) [Ougi states that everything is out of joint because it's taking too long to find Mayoi but I was pretty sure that she's already disappeared by the time Otorimonogatari, chronologically after Onimonogatari, takes place. Or is there a massive time gap, of a few weeks, between the conversation with Ougi and the next scene of Nadeko arriving at school? Also is this a foreshadowing that Ougi is the dark shadow chasing Mayoi in Onimonogatari?](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers for Oni](/s "I believe it's foreshadowig that Ougi is the dark shadow that is chasing Hachikuji. Ougi is a balancer. She/he/it becomes what it needs to be when it encounters a certain person or thing to maintain balance. Also yeah Hachikuji is gone at that point in time already.")
>> ARTICLE
ah... [Come to think of it, it does make sense since Hachikuji disappeared of her own accord so Ougi wouldn't necessarily know she was gone. If the dark shadow is Ougi in another form then she would know that Hachikuji had not been deleted by the shadow and would therefore assume she was still out there. Thus provoking her to go on a futile search.](/spoiler)

if you make it to the end of S2, it worth it. in my opinion the last 5 episodes of S2 with the Kaiki arc were worth it, it really is high-quality entertainment if you get it there. i believe youd have to watch it all to fully appreciate it, the interestingness of Kaiki.

Obligatory: Kizumonogatari when?
>> ARTICLE
Never.
>> ARTICLE
It's believed that the song playing in the middle is the ED.

Looks like we won't lack for Hitagi in this one. I'm sure fans will be pleased.

For people who are like "Nekomonogatari? We already had that one"...there are two stories called Nekomonogatari, Nekomonogatari (Kuro) which was the story of Golden Week and thus immediately before Bakemonogatari, and this one, Nekomonogatari (Shiro), which takes place after Nisemonogatari and is part of the second season novels that are being adapted into one big 26-episode story.
>> ARTICLE
Nekomonogatari: Kuro is immediately before Bakemonogatari? I thought there was a gap between the two, of maybe a few weeks/months... It would be cool if someone made a timeline with the dates of major events in the series.
>> ARTICLE
the last scene of Kuro is senjougahara on top of the staircase and araragi ends his narration with "i climb the staircase" which is exactly how bake starts
>> ARTICLE
Watch out, there are spoilers [here](http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Monogatari_Series:Timeline), but I think this is what you're looking for.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, thank you, I was looking for something with dates, I have already seen the chart that /u/Pulsifer_ posted, but thanks anyway. I didnt read about events that occured after Nisemonogatari, but I am really curious about what these things like [mild spoiler](/s "Tsubasa Song and Hitagi Buffet") are for, since they arent labelled with a book number.
>> ARTICLE
I think they were part of a book of short stories that came with the Bakemonogatari BD-box. I may be wrong about that, but it was definitely a set of short stories.
>> ARTICLE
They are short stories, and kinda humorous, there is one for each girl.

Hanekawa is best girl.  Or maybe Sengoku.  Or Kanbaru.

Fuck it, Nisio is best author.

It took another watch-through for me to warm up to her.  Then Neko brought me right back to Hanekawa.

How can sexual attraction be stronger than pure perfection?
>> ARTICLE
I do think Senjougahara and Araragi make for a more interesting couple.  However, Hanekawa's whole arc stems from her being, in Araragi's words, "too perfect to live with," and episode 12 has the repeated monologue outlining Senjougahara's flaws.  Her flaws are, I think, exactly what makes her more interesting and attractive to Araragi.  Hanekawa is just my personal favorite.

But that's just speculation, as I haven't read the books.  I only know what I know, after all. :3

As proven by [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwYCcSnQhEc), among other things.

july 7-ish

July 7, one week from Sunday. I don't know it that means that we see it on Saturday or Sunday (or Monday), though.

Since it's being simulcast immediately after airing by Daisuki, if you live east of the date line and west of East Asia, it'll be premiering during Saturday July 6th.

Mildly interesting information: The premiere date is the birthday date of Senjougahara Hitagi.

I love how Nisioisin has a logo now.

He's had a logo for a while.

Has he? I'll admit I haven't been paying the closest attention, but I don't remember any similar logos on earlier PVs...
>> ARTICLE
It seems Hanekawa will narrate this arc just like in the light novel. Shaft has being truthful with the anime adaptation.

But they made me sad when they didn't animate the dialogue between Koyomi and Tsukihi in Nekomonogatari Black where they discuss the meaning of the colors of panties. It's the highlight of that arc lol.

As long as we learn about hygiene in this arc I will be fine.

I know this is a joke of sorts partially but in truth. It won't be as pervy as Nise. Nise was definitely the most out there of the series.

but this one touches a little closer to home for me, so it is for me. just imagine a genderswapped hitagi when she is going to sleep.

In Hanamonogatari. Although she does show up briefly in Nekomonogatari White.

Haruna Luna ED sounds great.

So excited for this! 
>> ARTICLE
I started reading Nekomonogatari (shiro) a while back, but stopped because it started referencing Kizumonogatari pretty heavily, which I had not read. That's why I found it strange they're adapting this first, but now I don't really mind anymore, I guess.

I'm really looking forward to it, Hanekawa's narration is really enjoyable and the interaction between her and Hitagi is absolutely great.

Such a few seconds of Senjougahara and still so many feelings going through ;_;

Someone could translate into english if they wanted. I wouldn't be angry.

I have no idea what she was saying most of the time except for that last sentence spoken by Senjougahara. That was all I needed to know to get even more excited. Seems Senjougahara will straight up confront Hanekawa about her feelings for Araragi. Aww yea!

Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, Nekomonogatari: Kuro, and finally this newest season.

Let's hope for less fan service. S2 got a bit tiring with it.
>> ARTICLE
Really surprised to see Kyoukai no Kanata place in top 5 Fall shows.  

Also, it's no surprise that SnK is the number 1 show of 2013, which is mainly due to its massive popularity.
>> ARTICLE
even more surprising that it's higher than kyousougiga.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata made Top 5 for Fall 2013, yet didn't rank on Top 10 for 2013 (whereas Kyousougiga did).

Interesting.
>> ARTICLE
This is probably due to the "choose 5 shows" format of the polls.  Since KnK was really popular in the fall, regardless of its actual quality, the more viewers it had the higher likelihood it would gain lots of votes.  Also, the casual visitor of /r/anime probably doesn't even watch 5 shows a season, so KnK would net a lot of default votes that way.  I think that if we could have only chosen 3 or even only 1 show, KnK might not even rank in the top 5.
>> ARTICLE
Hardly. It's been reiterated many times that Kyosougiga was underwatched. No matter how good it is, you need people watching it in order for it to poll higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's very true. I only started it last week and I regret not doing so earlier. Really good for only 10 episodes. Too bad I already voted by the time I watched it.
>> ARTICLE
I very recently finished Kyokai no Kanata and don't really see why it gets such hate. While the show itself is not particularly deep, and the ending is not the best, it still holds its own. 

To me the main appeal of the show was that it was entertaining and I think that is the most important aspect of the show. Recently I'm starting to feel that /r/anime is more of a hivemind than individuals when it comes to rating shows :/.
>> ARTICLE
It's fluff, well drawn and animated fluff and nothing else. Just disappointing it was nothing more.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I agree, which is why I'm really hoping we do get a second season!
>> ARTICLE
Well, with almost any anime there is dissenting opinion.  Even though I tend to see more criticism of KnK on reddit, the fact that KnK finished third place in voting probably indicates that the majority of /r/anime either liked it or didn't have a problem with it.  

Personally, I thought KnK was incredibly average in nearly all aspects.  My main concern lay with Kyoani adapting weak and uninteresting characters, which is uncharacteristic for an animation studio so invested in its shows' personalities.
>> ARTICLE
>Personally, I thought KnK was incredibly average in nearly all aspects. My main concern lay with Kyoani adapting weak and uninteresting characters, which is uncharacteristic for an animation studio so invested in its shows' personalities.

I completely agree with you, but we may differ is on where we place the show or how we rate it. Even with all of the flaws I enjoyed it way more than I should have, but the show just fit my personality, and judging by the poll a lot of other people thought so too.

That being said, I would love a remake or second season following the source material better with a more fleshed out end.

Ya that pretty much sums the large ones up.

/r/anime is a fairly large subreddit, and while I do agree a good portion of the things in that list, that doesn't mean they are facts. Personally I would like to see some more debate type (not argument)  comment threads than a simple Gurren Lagann quote or way status pun.

edit: I should also say that not being a very large contributor to the content of the sub makes me partially a hypocrite, but I'm ok with that.

Haha, I'm right with you on the contributor part. There certainly are some people saying these things, and I can't guarantee I've never said those things and never will. But I do think r/anime is a generally great place to be, and the discussion posts are great, with both serious evaluation and funny remarks. This balance between serious and funny here is perfect for me, and that's why I don't mind those few "Onii-chan, you're going to break me!" whenever I see them. 
>> ARTICLE

I love the balance too, and I really did laugh out loud seeing "Onii-chan, you're going to break me!" as the top comment. I just think sometimes we flame series like KnK or F/SN a little harder than needed and it turns people off to them, when I enjoyed both.

[We've had a survey recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1sf3ce/recent_fall_2013_anime_survey_results/) asking which Fall 2013 shows people watched, 9 weeks into the season.

Wonder if it'd have been worthwhile to add it to this survey - yes, it's a bit of a chore, but if a show is chosen by 300 people as a top 10 show when 350 people watched it all the way through, it's quite different to a show that had 300 people pick it as top 10 when 1,200 watched it all the way through.

Food for thought.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, basic research design says that this is the best way to measure performance.  The only problem is making sure the two pools are sufficiently well-identified that you can deal with people who didn't take the first survey.  Same thing with attrition.  But then again I didn't look hard at how this was carried out...
>> ARTICLE
And thus the suggestion is that going forward, you do it in one survey.
>> ARTICLE
Nice way of looking at it, if we look with this extra information 9 weeks more people were watching Infinite Stratos compared to White Album 2, yet in the end IS didn't even rank.

Which seems to say, that even if an anime has a lot of viewers, the majority may not always think it's the best I believe.

You sure? I'm not sad about it all, because I know that it was a huge hit in Japan, and that's what only matters. I'd rather have all of my favourite shows be unknown to countries outside of Japan, but is a commercial success inside it.

If only internet popularity could always translate to good commercial sales, *sigh*.

it only saddens me because we won't see BD released in the EU.

Yamato:2199 is a gem of a show, and having 30k+ per volume sales is pretty much a guarantee for continuations and/or movies.

Glad to see SSY and Psycho Pass holding their own. Was really blown away by them both, and am definitely adding them into my personal Top 5.

Hey hey, despite the ending, Valvrave still made it moderately high.

Kind of sad Little Busters couldn't break 200 but since it was a second season and would've required people to actually watch the first one, can't say I'm surprised.

Btw, minor note for OP, the picture lists Outbreak Company as 284 votes but you said it was 274 votes in this topic. This means the moe takeover was much closer to being a reality.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah LBs was surprising, I thought it would have had more of a following since it had the reputation of being made by Key.

Oh, thanks for the spot.
>> ARTICLE
It did have a reputation and hype from the whole Key thing but I also remember a lot of negativity because instead of KyoAni producing it, J.C. Staff did. I'm not honestly sure that would've changed things a whole lot but I can't talk about what didn't happen.

What did happen in my opinion, is the first part of the show was kind of mediocre. It did have some good moments, but I think a lot of people just dropped it, even I did really (in favor of Sakurasou, the other airing J.C. Staff show at the time). I just came back later to complete it.

But Refrain, I think all of that was better than the entirety of the previous episodes. 26 episodes. That's a Clannad level of time commitment. And while the payoff was good, personally, I think I still have a hard time recommending the show over other things.
>> ARTICLE
I get what you mean, if originally there was a lot of people watching the first season but stopped because they didn't find it interesting enough then it's only naturally Season 2 would have a lower user base.

But thats true, not only Sakurasou but it also aired along side Shin Sekai Yori, Zetsuen no Tempest & K Anime which were also highly regarded during the time, which over shadowed LBs.

Seems like a terrible idea to me. A lot of shows can start off spectacularly but turn into garbage as it progresses. Sure, we are *able* to change our votes at any time, but will we? Surely a few people would vote for things that don't end up holding up by the time the season ends, but completely forget about the poll and mess up the results.

Yeah, i was actually on the fence about it, but you points make sence, it could spoil the validity of each submission at this stage. I'll remove it and bring it back after the season.

Week 3 poll, week 6 poll, week 9 poll would also work, and then we could track changes.

Week 3/6 also usually have discussion threads for the season as a whole, so it'd be a good complementary thing to have.

That could  work, but would the poll ask what your favourite anime at that stage is, or would it ask what anime you are watching, so you could see the amount of people that dropped an anime over the course of the season.

Probably watching. I'd be loathe to ask "Favourite", because declaring something is your favourite can actually change how you look at it from then on - and we have the threads for that.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that makes sense, shouldn't really of used the term "favourite". But seems to be the better choice, then at the end of the season, you could then compared the percentage of people watching a shows vs the top 5/10 anime of season.

"the show needed more MISAKA imouto scenes/content" MISAKA responds begrudgingly.
>> ARTICLE
Only Non Non Biyori surprises me on Fall - not because I don't think it's deserving, but I didn't watch it, and I didn't know people liked it that much.

On top 10 list, I voted for 4 or 5 of these shows, one I didn't vote for due to not watching, and even the ones I didn't vote for I knew were pretty darn popular (And I enjoyed a number of them a fair amount, just not enough to make top 10 :))

I might be a tad surprised about the lack of Railgun S (Though with 120 votes it wasn't too far off). I might also be disappointed about the lack of a couple of shows, but as at least one of them (Genshiken Nidaime) rarely crossed 20 comments in the weekly discussion threads, I'm far from surprised. Gatchaman Crowds' lack also makes me a tad sad, but not too surprised, even though we've had lively discussion threads for that one :)

I am surprised by the *lack* of JoJo, considering how often it gets mentioned. It's harder to see what's *missing* rather than what is there, until you go over the full list.

Shin Sekai Yori is definitely deserving of all the praise it receives. I wonder how many people like myself only watched it a fair amount of time after it ended, and whether perhaps Kyousougiga, which I truly thought was magnificent, would've scored higher had we held the poll in a year's time.

Also, people often say one measure of "classics" or a good show is whether anyone remembers them a year later. Might be interesting to do this poll, with these shows, again in a year's time, or to do the 2012 equivalent poll right now, and see what withstood the test of (a small amount of) time.

If you're looking for a 20 minute break from reality in a happy place, that's pretty much what it is and IMO is pretty much what SoL shows are about. I'd describe it as a cross between Minami-ke and Usagi Drop but prettier and in a more developed setting. It also matches my sense of humor so I found it to be one of the most consistently funny series I've seen. It's not outright the best show this Fall (Kyousougiga and WA2 were *really* good) but it's the one I looked forward to most week to week.
>> ARTICLE
>I might be a tad surprised about the lack of Railgun S

Blame the Febri arc.  As great as the Sisters arc was, the Febri arc was just dull and took up a full 1/3 of the show.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the Febri arc, personally. I don't read the manga, but I've heard that Shinobu's fate was basically a dropped plot thread, and I'm glad J.C. Staff had the sense to tie it up. Misaka finally asking her friends for help was big step in her character development, as well. I can understand manga readers wanting to see more of the source material animated, but I thought it was a strong arc.
>> ARTICLE
It's because the "character development" that you claim is the exact OPPOSITE direction of her actual character development in the source material. Also, them calling some petty group of scientists doing unapproved experiments(meaning not caused by the higherups of AC) "The Darkness of Academy City" pissed a bunch of people off.
>> ARTICLE
AOTS is pretty much what I voted for.

AOTY looks alright, but imo is missing JoJo, Chihayafuru 2 and Railgun S: shows which I absolutely loved. They don't seem to have done too bad in the poll though, so I'm not mad.

I guess I need to finally catch up on Psycho-Pass :s.
>> ARTICLE
> Psycho-Pass

yes, you should. it's objectively better than the three missing shows you mentioned, which isn't downplaying them at all.

also: it's getting a second season and a movie (production IG president confirmed)
>> ARTICLE
You can't say "Psycho Pass is objectively better," that doesn't make any sense.  I didn't even like Psycho Pass, but that doesn't mean it's "objectively bad."

i didn't say i liked/hated Psycho-Pass. [feel free to look up the sense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_%28philosophy%29) and figure out what i meant on your own by looking up reviews or just doing an analytical comparison yourself.

I've seen Psycho Pass.  Your use of the word objective is incorrect.

[uh huh](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1uxekm/ranime_aoty_2013_aots_fall_2013_poll_results/cemrb52) 
>> ARTICLE
?  

Either way, reviews are necessarily subjective.  They are opinions.  Just like appreciation of a show is subjective.  Quality is not quantifiable.  That's why you can't say one show is objectively better than another one.  You may think it's better but there are no absolutes.

If objectivity actually existed in this sense then reviews would be meaningless.  A computer could just tell us what the best show was, what the best movie was, the best game, etc...
>> ARTICLE
i disagree.

- **singular reviews being subjective** simply means that if you're looking for anime you would love then you simply have to look for someone whose subjective tastes you align yourself with the most.. which makes them useful for a lot of people.

for example: if you're looking for symbolism, thematic depth and intrinsic meaning behind a series you should look for /u/bobduh 's reviews. you shouldn't trust him when it comes to action anime though and he has somewhat okay taste in comedy. ^(if you're gonna argue that i'm just being subjective - again -, look at his stuff yourself..)

- a computer *can* tell us **what the best show was/is** once you collect sufficient data because *objective truth* is only as relevant as the collective subjective opinions of the ones exposed to content. *true/absolute* objectivity does not exist when it comes to opinions/reviewing making it is also irrelevant - it's an abstract concept.

for example: most anime sites will rank Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood as the top anime of all time. what this means is that this anime is the most likely to be favorably viewed by any person, irrespective of tastes, which makes it objectively correct to say it is 'the best anime'. of course the title can change so it's only as relevant as the time someone makes such a remark.
>> ARTICLE
Wow.  Well, thanks for the thoughtful reply.  I completely, completely disagree.  

By your definition, if I said I disliked Fullmetal Alchemist then I would be in the wrong.  It's not a valid opinion because FMA is objectively the best anime of all time.  How does that make sense to you?

if you lookup [the entire comment tree](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1uxekm/ranime_aoty_2013_aots_fall_2013_poll_results/cempxiy) you'll notice i never said 1 word about your opinion (or anyone else's) being "wrong" or "incorrect" or "invalid". 

i realize for some people it is very important that their *opinion* be 'correct' but there is no such thing. it is not incorrect/invalid/wrong to have an opinion contrary to the objectively measured one, it is simply different.

for example: the most people in the world are asian therefore *objectively speaking the average face of a human being is asiatic* . does this mean you're an invalid specimen of a human being if you're not asian/have an asian face? no, that just means you can't accept differences/always look for validation and is the definition of racism, in this case. subjectively speaking you could say "everyone's white" if you live in a part of the world with caucasian people but that would just be your reality/opinion of the world around you. you couldn't say it's incorrect since it's an opinion relative to your location.

when you see someone write "you are correct" in a thread filled with opinions on any matter, it's trolling/shitposting/a gag meaning to highlight one's adherence to another's opinion.

I'm with you on Chihayafuru 2, definitely one of my favorites this year.  
>> ARTICLE
Definitely, it probably just to do with the unpopularity.

What shit taste r/anime
>> ARTICLE
What else did you expect?
>> ARTICLE
Aaaaand JoJo's Bizarre Adventure isn't on the top 2013 list. You guys disappoint me. 

Really though, if you haven't seen the new JoJo's Bizarre Adventure anime you need to fix that as soon as possible.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I was surprised as well, it seemed like the anime had a quite a big following.
>> ARTICLE
I think it ended early and then not many people discussed it - popcorn is popcorn.
>> ARTICLE
That's true, once the anime ended, it never really got talked about after that. So it seems popcorn shows don't last well in the long run, and that it might have ranked higher has the poll be made in the season it ended in.
>> ARTICLE
it also had no legal option for viewing.


it would have helped.
>> ARTICLE
No surprises at all. I disagree with a decent amount of the list but at least my favorites got placed, bar Gargantia.
>> ARTICLE
Really pleased with the results of the Anime of the Year. I never watched Shinsekai, I guess this means I have to now. Also quite surprised with White Album, didn't think it would outrank Kyousougiga, Sakurasou, and Railgun honestly. I think if Railgun had a better second half it would have cracked the top 10, the first half was amazing. I would personally rank SnK a few spots lower and Yahari in second. But other than that, solid list. Great picks guys.

> Sekai de Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai! - 14

That sounds about what I would expect for an AotS poll, on par with the discussion threads. Still a fantastic sports show with all the wrestling athleticism and drama at its finest. Gonna miss watching Sakura's in-ring performances, the Manami Toyota-inspired Misaki Toyoda, Chinatsu and Moe. And that whole Jackal Number One. And Sakura's ring entrance. Ooh, I'm "going to that place". I'm marking out.

> Sekai de Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai! - 3

I feel like I know all three people who voted for the show for AotY.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if I really agree with putting 2012 series such as pyscho pass and SSY on the list, since they both started in 2012.

Surprised Golden time isnt anywhere on the fall list
>> ARTICLE
The way the poll works is that only series that ended in 2013 were eligible, so although Pyscho Pass and SSY aired in 2012 they did not finished in that year and therefore could not be be judged accurately.

Golden Time and Kill La Kill etc. where not included in the Fall Poll or of The Year poll since they will end this season. So in the Winter poll i'll make at the end of the season Golden Time would be included.

Since you accurately say how good a show is, until it's ended.

TD;LR - The show has to finish within the "year x" or "season x" to be able to vote in "pole x" for it.
>> ARTICLE
Ah I see. Dont they do it the other way around in the polls in japan?
>> ARTICLE
I am not sure to be honest, havn't viewed any Japanese poll recently.
>> ARTICLE
Read again, it's about shows that *ended* in 2013.

So Shin Sekai Yori is in, but Golden Time isn't.

Shows can pick up or fail in their second halves, a complete "2013 only" poll can only be had around April.
>> ARTICLE
I'm very impressed, and pleased, to see Shin Sekai Yori rank so highly on the list.  It doesn't get the recognition it deserves.
>> ARTICLE
Some people make sure to keep bringing it up, and thus spread the love. It takes time, but it works!

Had this poll been had 2-3 weeks after SSY ended, it prolly wouldn't have placed, which makes the Kyousougiga placement an accomplishment, actually.
>> ARTICLE
Surprised shinsekai is up there. Thought it was a really good show not alot of people saw. Psycho pass takes it for me.
>> ARTICLE
replying to save thread for later
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai yori easily my favorite
>> ARTICLE
Is SnK really THAT good? I've never seen it before. I really do feel it is a bit over hyped...
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's quite over-hyped and has some annoying characters and terrible pacing. However, it's still a fun show and has some genuinely gruesome moments. Overall, it's a decent show, pretty solid, but nothing too spectacular. I certainly wouldn't place it over Psycho Pass, Uchouten Kazoku, Kyousou Giga, etc. 
>> ARTICLE
Its good, but whether you enjoy it is up to you, there are a few boring episodes but overall I believe its a worthy watch.
>> ARTICLE
It's incredibly popular and easily watchable for new comers, which makes it being on the list pretty understandable.  It's definitely good though, yeah, but it's over-hyped.  Don't ever go into a show with expectations and you'll never be let down!  Give the show a shot if you haven't.
>> ARTICLE
This entire list is made useless by the fact that Shingeki is somehow #1, and by a wide margin.  Leaving Shinsekai Yori in 3?  Kyousougiga in NINE?!  
  
Fuck this.
>> ARTICLE
It's a popularity vote, and as such isn't "useless".

Many more people watched Shingeki no Kyojin than had Kyousougiga or Shin Sekai Yori. The question is how many people of those who watched SnK voted for it, percentage-wise, and the same question for the other two shows.

Kyousougiga is also kind of recent, and I bet in a year's time more people will have watched it, just as many of the people who watched SSY have done so after it concluded airing.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking about for next time adding another poll asking people to tick all the anime they watch this season. That way we could get a percentage of people who watched it vs the vote, which could bring be used to view the poll in a new perspective.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like a better idea to me. It would make much more sense to do it as a percentage of people who've seen it, rather than how many people vote for something. Gives the less known shows a bit more of a chance
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, for the Winter 2014 i'll do a "vote" and a "watched" poll, so we get 2 sets of data to compare and contrast.
>> ARTICLE
Of course SnK is going to be number one in any poll, it was the biggest series of the year, by far and a way the most popular.
>> ARTICLE
3 Of my AOTY are on the list with 2 of them being Runner Ups. In order of best to 5th: SSY, WA2, Sakurasou, Railgun S, Oregairu

I guess i'll eventually continue on the Bakemonogatari series since it's almost loved by everyone. Found no special liking or dislike towards it the first time around and dropped it at 6.

I also don't really understand the hype for SnK. I can't seem to get into it fully. To me, it feels like it tries too hard to be dramatic/serious while still keeping a somewhat generic shounen setup. 
>> ARTICLE
Its no surprise that SnK won, every casual loves it.


>> ARTICLE
Well it was the show that managed to reach a population that never knew or watched much anime before.
>> ARTICLE
how the hell did Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru make it past white album 2? it was a show about *nothing*



>> ARTICLE
Seinfeld *prided* itself being a show about *nothing*, look how well it did.
>> ARTICLE
seinfeld was actually funny at times though
>> ARTICLE
That's not the point I was commenting on though, and is somewhat a moving of the goalpost at this point :)

Also, if we're honest, I don't think OreGairu is a show about nothing, and to me it's more of a drama/"real slice of life", than a comedy.

Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.

> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.
>> ARTICLE
Well deserved.

Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites.

I'd love to see this updated after every season. Maybe this can be a sidebar addition or something.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

Surprised I've never heard of rainbow considering its so high up this list.

In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

Holy shit.

You should, it's pretty great.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

IIRC it was at 8.70~ after it ended. It dropped only by a little bit.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.

> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Yay for Slam Dunk making in to the top 100. Very first sports anime that I watched and enjoyed. I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Oh wow, I dodnt even realize that lol

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Angels Beats is always rated high for some reason :/. I liked it, but there are many others that are definitely better.

The jokes can only be funny for so long and I didn't even find them that funny in the first place.

OPM is a really good show. But no way it should ever be above Code Geass.

It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.

A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.

I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.

>> ARTICLE
Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.

I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.

Unpopular opinion coming through: One Piece's Skypiea arc.

Dat Kagura fight tho.
>> ARTICLE
Yoshiwara was amazing, especially considering it introduced two of my favourite characters (Tsukuyo and Kamui).

Although four devas is my personal favourite. That graveyard scene..
>> ARTICLE
That scene is one of the greatest scenes I've ever watched.  

After that arc ended Gintama was without a doubt my favorite anime of all I've ever watched.
>> ARTICLE
Yoshiwara is 1st for me with Four Devas a close second. Then it would be Shinsengumi Revolution or Benizakura.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah...Shinsengumi Revolution is so good tho, the first arc I really loved.
>> ARTICLE
Personally i love the Red Spider arc. I hardly ever hear it mentioned when someone refers to good Gintama arcs.

Also the Obi Hajime arc is amazing and has one of the best fights in the entire series (even though it's kinda short)
>> ARTICLE
the newest arc in the manga is insane
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious, are the current manga arcs better than the other serious arcs? 
>> ARTICLE
I think so, these arcs are pretty huge, there's major character deaths and it's been really damn long. I think this arc could be 40 episodes in the anime maybe
>> ARTICLE
Definitely Marineford in one piece, definitely.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK! - the goldfarming arc, I think. it's hard to pick

Monogatari - Hachikuji's arc in SS, barely beating out Kaiki's arc [](/s "masochism may have been the deciding factor here")
>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf Nora arc
>> ARTICLE
I personally always liked the Amarti arc in Kumersun. There's some serious twists in that.

After reading the LN's: Eve's arc in Lenos. Eve is a really interesting character going forward.
>> ARTICLE
My fave anime is Code Geass but that doesnt really have arcs imo. My next is HxH and I liked Greed Island the most. It was like a video game and I loved that. It was also the most satisfying to watch through of all the HXH arcs.

Outside tat, I love Rokka and the Battle Within the Illusion Fog Barrier.
>> ARTICLE
The Greed Island arc doesn't get enough love in my opinion, maybe because [Spoilers] (/s "The bomber is a pretty shit villain compared to the antagonists in all the other arcs, i mean when you're up against Meruem, Hisoka and the Phantom Troupe what can you do?")
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, the others were more threatening. But I like that he was actually beaten strategically and fairly. None of the others had that, and that was what was so satisfying.

Also if you compare Gon and Killuas growth, I thought the change was very, very noticeable, and I liked that.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved the training part in Greed Island where you could visibly see them becoming stronger an stronger.
>> ARTICLE
I actually loved the endless eight of Haruhi.

Now before you guys think I'm just some crazy person, I actually have some reasoning behind it: 

1: I was watching the show via a like 3 hour video on youtube while playing some game with my roommates on our computers. After two or so episodes passed we all were somewhat confused, thinking something along the lines of, "wait, I feel like this just happened". We then actually started to pay attention and by episode 5 we knew 100% that it was repeating...but not exactly. There were minor changes and the entire concept just enthralled us. It was a memorable (And hilarious) experience.

2: It really defined the movie (Which I gave a 10/10 while I gave the show like a 7.) Without spoiling anything, the endless eight explains why the events of the movie even occur. I thought it was brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. When I finally get around to watching haruhi in my anime group, endless 8 will be their "Rite of passage".
>> ARTICLE
With full context, the movie deserve an 11/10 and in retrospective, I'm glad I watched the endless eight before.
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, enies lobby in one piece? Really can't pick a favorite but the enies lobby arc in one piece was fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Phantom troupe arc in Hunter x Hunter

Monogatari second season the arc with time travel.

DBZ the cell games 

Naruto shippuden not really an arc but two sets of conversations naruto had that I really really liked (idk how to block spoilers so it was hard for me to write my answer)
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori's final story arc.
>> ARTICLE
Chimera ant HxH
>> ARTICLE
This seems to be the arc that either makes or breaks it for HxH. And for me unfortunately it broke it. Shame to cause I loved Yu Yu Hakusho which is also by Togashi so I was expecting great things from it.
>> ARTICLE
That broke the anime for me. Too much build up for a conclusion that didn't feel worth it to me.
>> ARTICLE
I liked Yorknew City so much more.
>> ARTICLE
That one was very well paced when I cannot say the same about the Chimera Ants arc whatsoever. The Yorknew arc made me sing in agreement with people who were lauding this anime to be "shonen done right". I can't say I liked the Greed Island arc at all and the pacing the Chimera arc made me think "no, this isn't shonen done right anymore, this just feels like your usually way too dragged out shonen, albeit with still higher quality content". There were a few really, really strong episodes in the Chimera arc and it had a great conclusion but it dragged on way too much for me.

Yorknew City arc is lacking in regards to conclusion but just about kills it everywhere else.
>> ARTICLE
I'm torn between the Chimera Ant and Yorknew City arcs for HxH
>> ARTICLE
I believe that if you were able to binge watch chimera ant arc then that would most likely be your favourite however if you had to endure this extremely slow pace while waiting for an episode every week then you might have enjoyed Yorknew City better - but overall CA should take the lead.
>> ARTICLE
I binged CA in a week with it playing at at least twice the speed and it was still a pain to get through.
>> ARTICLE
This is an unpopular opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Really? Even the most diehard fanboys will still talk about the pacing.
>> ARTICLE
Idk about york.    
It wasnt bad but it just didnt hit me at all unlike chimera
>> ARTICLE
They're tied for me. Like I disliked how so much of the Chimera Ant arc was focused on Kite, who I disliked. I dislike Gon mostly so his irrational love towards Kite after only knowing him for a short period of time annoyed me incredibly.

Yorknew was awesome but the whole Hisoka fight never happened so that took a lot of steam out of it for me
>> ARTICLE
One thing Madhouse fucked up was not introducing kite at the very beginning of the anime like the manga. Kite was the genesis of gons adventure. That's why he was so important to gon. It really bothered me because I saw that shit coming when the 1st didn't have kite. I was like ok... How the fuck is the viewers going to empathize with gons if you don't introduce kite in the beginning so we as a viewer has memory of that mysterious character from episode 1. The character that launched us into journey.
>> ARTICLE
I was lucky. I watched the first episode of the 1999 anime on a whim and then  decided to go with the then ongoing 2011 anime.
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing: in the manga Kite appear at the start kinda, and in the anime for me was a little bit forced. Still loved the chimera arc though.
>> ARTICLE
Sora's arc in Yosuga no Sora. The other arcs are still good but they pale in comparison. The only thing bad about it is that I'll never find anything else I'll enjoy as much.
>> ARTICLE
* **Shirobako** - *The Third Aerial Girl's Squad arc* feels just right to me. A lot of feels were had, a lot of concepts on the industry were introduced, a lof of everything. Also, episode 23.

* **Spice & Wolf** - I'm really divided between the "bankrupt" arc and the lawrence x armin arc. Both have some gut wrenching tension and despair filling them, and showcase really well why Holo's my favorite character.

* **Monogatari Series** - *Tsubasa Tiger arc.* Apparently an unpopular opinion, but I always had doubts about Hanekawa as a character. She *seemed* like a great character, but we never got real development for her. Tsubasa Tiger settled it for me, even her "easygoingness" and "help everyone!" mindstate were great plot points which made for a really deep character. Granted, I've still not finished the show, so this might chance, but yeah.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari SS - Nadeko Medusa. That was fucking awesome. [Nisio knows](/s "how to use unreliable narrators.").

Katanagatari - Shichika vs [](/s "Nanami").

Yuuki Yuuna - episodes 8-12.
>> ARTICLE
Aincrad in Sword Art Online
>> ARTICLE
Most solid arc from the whole franchise. Too bad it was so fucking rushed in anime. But it was dynamic, pretty consistent and had its tension.
>> ARTICLE
K-On! doesn't really have arcs.  
  
So, I'll go with either Shinobu Time from Monogatari SS or Sisters Arc from Railgun S.
>> ARTICLE
\# 1. *Hitagi End* (Second Season)

^^Kaiki. ^^Nuff ^^said.

\# 2. *Mayoi Snail* (Bakemonogatari)

^^The ^^Crab ^^v. ^^Araragi ^^dialogue ^^and ^^Mayoi ^^v. ^^Araragi ^^shenanigans ^^in ^^this ^^arc ^^are ^^unbeatable.

\# 3. *Mayoi Jiangshi* (Second Season)

\# 4. *Shinobu Time* (Second Season)

\# 5.  Episodes 7 through 12 of *Mahou Shoujo Madoka*
>> ARTICLE
Having just finished Monogatari ss I can confirm this. Kaiki is best girl.
>> ARTICLE
**chimera ant arc** from HxH - the character development of the villains, the politics, the fights... everything was pretty much top notch. i consider it one of the best arcs from an shounen anime (eventhough HxH is not really shounen later...)

btw, you need to finish monogatari series second season, the later arc, *shinobu time* and *hitagi end* are both stellar. also, there is hanamonogatari and tsukimonogatari. then there is owarimonogatari coming this fall season
>> ARTICLE
TIL I'm the only person in this thread who though "Shinobu Time" was lazy and out of left field. 

~~that doesn't change the fact that adult Mayoi is best Monogatari~~
>> ARTICLE
Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail. Rock becomes a certified badass, all the other characters, major and minor, get their chance to shine, and the final battle is incredible.

Roberta was a bit too op for my liking but still the best black lagoon arc.

[Also that opening was killer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKDJn4g4B1g)

STEEL BALL RUN

but if it has to be something that's been animated I'll go with Yorknew in HxH
>> ARTICLE
Judging by the fact that the hype was most definitely certified when it came to Unbreakable Diamond I can't wait til I get to Steel Ball Run
>> ARTICLE
4 and 7 are most people's favorites ;) 

That being said, all the parts are fantastic and you should enjoy Vento Aureo and Stone Ocean

EDIT: if you're reading Part 5, it's being retranslated so make sure you don't read the old scans. 
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately I've been forced to read the old scans because of the speed at which I read. Hopefully they've gotten past where I am because I haven't been able to read it in a while, but regardless I've been enjoying Part 5 to the best of my ability. I understand why a lot of people didn't like it, but I'm enjoying it a lot!
>> ARTICLE
Honestly they aren't that bad. I read the last chapters in the old scans and they were fine. It's not great, but it's passable.

But only for a bit, and that's where you messed up!

I really like the inverted tsundere for some reason. Also loved Ami from Toradora. Unfortunately you don't seem to run into these kinds of characters much, people always seem to prefer simplistic taming of the shrew type stories to... well... the opposite, which seems to only be preferred by masochists like myself.
>> ARTICLE
I can't help but love Haruka's arc, it's just so damn funny and sweet. It's one of my favorite romance stories

She's cute but also kind of annoying (I tend to find Ginko girls annoying) and the romance felt kind of forced.

Arrancar Arc in Bleach. Say what you will, I love Bleach. The arc is full of badass villains that are Hollows with Shinigami powers, and then they have broken pieces of skull on their face. The powers are nuts. There is a guy with exploding spirit wolves, a jawbone around his neck, and duel-wield energy pistols. Another is just a straight up human jaguar.

episodes 6-8 of the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist series. The chimera arc, and its closure in the Barry the Chopper episode was the most gutwrenching three episodes of television I've ever seen. Hearing Ed's "we're not gods" speech at the end of episode 8 still makes me cry whenever I see it.

technically OP the best arc in haruhi is often considered to be the dissapearance arc or snowy mountain syndrome.

Hitagi End right?

I am looking forward to it. 
This season Senjougahara's been bumped from 1st to 3rd (by Shinobu and Hachikuji) as my favorite girl in the series, so it will be hard for her arc to top Hachikuji's. But Senjougahara's a great character and would be my favorite in many other anime I expect it to be as excellent as the rest of this season has been.

The final episodes of Clannad: After Story. The culmination of ~40 episodes of Tomoya's character development from a high schooler into an adult was incredible.

Oh yea if you consider that an arc I agree. I also like the Nagisa arc from the end of Clannad. From the point he moved in with her till they finally started dating was a great end to the season.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the lines between arcs are pretty fuzzy, but I feel like the tone of the last episodes had enough of a shift to call it its own arc.

That arc is also great; once the introduction of all the girls finished and we started to get deeper insight into the family life of the main characters, I feel like Clannad hit its stride.

TIL my taste is incredibly mainstream.
>> ARTICLE
Is it? The current response summary lists Kill la Kill as the most-watched, and even that is only at 11% of all responses. 11% is hardly what I'd consider "mainstream."

The percentages are calculated incorrectly. Since this was a multiple choice poll the numbers for each show should be compared to the total number of participants, not to the number of other pics. 

So out of 2038 responses 1488 picked Kill la Kill as one of the choices - that's 73.01%.

I'm watching a lot this season, but only caught up on the ones I've liked.

I'm watching 9 this season. Was 11 but I dropped Gundam Build Fighters and Walkure Romanze because I flat couldn't be bothered with them. I think about 9-10 is my limit before I start procrastinating.

I am watching 28..

Yeah I wouldn't have the strength to watch that many. Most of them come out Thursday-Friday and Saturday-Sunday, so I watch them pretty much all at once each week.
28 is just... wow.

Yeah, I am not up to date with all of them, thankfully. I am waiting for some of the episodes to accumulate so I can watch 2-3 in a row, instead of having to wait weekly for some.

I really like Kyousougiga, but I haven't kept up since episode 5. I plan on marathoning once the season finishes. That way I can keep the story fresh in my mind. With all the other shows im watching, plus games and books Ive started to mesh narratives or straight up forget things

Not a huge loss or anything, but no Pokemon XY?

It's more of a continuation than a new season, but it should probably be on there.

A few people on MAL have requested the Aikatsu 2 entry be merged into Aikatsu. Considering there was never a break between the seasons and the name never officially got a "2" in the title. So I guess it's like One Piece. Forever ongoing.
>> ARTICLE
It would make sense, but there are some arguments against it. The first season was a coproduction between Sunrise and Telecom, but Telecom left after episode 50. There was also a complete change in branding, as it's now adapting a newer series of cards and the second 3DS game. But yeah, the episode numbering has continued from 50, and it's a direct continuation of the first season (albeit with a timeskip).

MAL does need to sort this kind of thing out, though. Cat's Eye is listed as a single series, when it aired as two seperate seasons a year apart. If that counts as a single series, then Fate/Zero should be merged into one too.
>> ARTICLE
It's a goddamn fight to change anything on MAL. I wish there was a mod evaluation. There are a couple that are just not good mods. I'll show proof of why X should by Y and they don't do anything or reply half-heartedly with things along the lines of 'because I said so'. Then I want to back flip into the sun when another mod or Kineta waltzes and does the thing I wanted from the start and [I can't help but go](http://i.imgur.com/4Wo6Xm7.gif).

Sorry about my gripe. But your argument against it great and it's something not a single mod has said. They haven't replied to any Aikatsu post. It's a goddamn cold shoulder to those users.

I don't see Monogatari S2 there.
>> ARTICLE
Technically Monogatari S2 belongs in last season's airing list. It's the same way next season Kill La Kill will still be airing, but won't be counted in that season. 
>> ARTICLE
oh I see.

Then I'll have to vote for none.

I think Meganebu is missing from the list.

If you wanted an easy indicator on how each anime is stacking up against the others... [Here it is.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AliLvsQM-YqcdG1XRGE2bUZENlJ5MjM3R1VReWdCOFE&usp=sharing)
>> ARTICLE
Do those percentages really mean anything? They're only calculating by number of votes, not number of people who have voted. At 1243/1675, *Kill la Kill* should be at 74%, at 232/1675 *Magi* should be at 13%, etc...
>> ARTICLE
You did't add Gifuu Dodou... though I think I'm the only one on here watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Gifuu Doudou is a Summer season anime. Hence why it's not on the list. Along with the 50+ other currently airing anime from previous seasons.
>> ARTICLE
oh.  that makes sense, then.
>> ARTICLE
I think you forgot Meganebu as well.

No glasses, no life.

Holy shit, more people watch Diamond No Ace than Hajime no Ippo, man wtf, only 38 people watching Ippo, no wonder it took 4 years for a new season, so sad, if the general rates are similar to these we probably won't get a new season.
>> ARTICLE
I'm basically watching every sports anime this season except Ippo, because it's on season 3. Ippo's way harder to get into than even Kuroko no Basuke, which only has season 1 (25 eps) as required viewing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not watching ippo yet because I haven't seen any of the previous series, however diamond no ace is a first series so anyone can get into that maybe?

>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah that's a good point, but still, quality wise I know it's subjective and all but Ippo is regarded as a classic and one of the best sports anime there is, while DnA, well ehh, I thought it was pretty generic.
>> ARTICLE
I'm one of less than 50 people watching Gundam Build Fighters, apparently.
>> ARTICLE
lol "only one question"
>> ARTICLE
Almost 20 people still watching Phi Brain :D I was just Assuming I was the only one still watching aha
>> ARTICLE
It's a lot better than the second season, isn't it? The fact that all plots are related to amnesia is getting a bit tiring now though.
>> ARTICLE
Ya definitely better than the 2nd season, not even that I didn't like the 2nd season either. 
It does seem like it's coming to a point where we're going to find out about Jin's past finally, cause I can't see them going the whole 25 episodes with him still having amnesia.
>> ARTICLE
I started the season with eight shows: Miss Monochrome, Kill la Kill, Golden Time, Outbreak Company, Wanna Be The Strongest in the World, Gingitsune, Unbreakable Machine-Doll, and Galilei Donna, in order of which ones I started watching first. I dropped four weeks in: Wanna Be the Strongest in the World for being morally stupid torture porn, and Gingitsune for being a colossal bore with forced to no conflict. Later, I dropped Unbreakable Machine-Doll because while I liked the story, I didn't feel it justified the sluggish pacing, and while I haven't given up on Galilei Donna, the rather vocal distaste for it on the ANN forums has caused me to choose to wait until the flames die down. So now, I'm following four series: Miss Monochrome, Kill la Kill, Golden Time, and Outbreak Company.
>> ARTICLE
TIL that people are not paying enough attention to Nagi no Asukara! - It is in my opinion better than Kill la Kill in entertainment value - And that's putting the bar high, because Kill la Kill sure does entertain :D!
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually just starting Nagi no Asukara. The visuals in the first episode already are really capturing my attention, and it has great reviews.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised not many people (compared to other shows) are watching **Magi** or **Kuroko no Basuke**, even though they're sequels.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit I've dropped a lot of stuff. To be fair though, I've been a bit busy and have since updated my collection before the winter holiday.
>> ARTICLE
People are really missing out on Nagi no Asukara. Sad to see it so low compared to the other shows. 
>> ARTICLE
I've dropped loads of series this season, they just weren't as interesting a I hoped! 
Next season looks fantastic though can't wait :D
>> ARTICLE
No Onepiece? Arguably the most popular anime in the world?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, because this survey is for this season only.
>> ARTICLE
*One Piece* isn't airing this season?
>> ARTICLE
The point is that this survey is for *this season's* shows. That excludes things like *One Piece* and the second season of *Monogatari*.
>> ARTICLE
What's so un-fall-2013 about those shows?
>> ARTICLE
*Monogatari S2* started in the summer, and is therefore considered a summer show that has carried over to the fall. That can be contrasted with, say, *Kill la Kill*, which began in the fall and is thus considered a fall show. *Kill la Kill* will keep running during the winter season, but it won't be considered a winter series.

The current season of *One Piece* began back in January, for reference. That's because *One Piece* runs pretty much all year every year, forever.
>> ARTICLE
It just seems strange. Why limit a show to what season it began in?
>> ARTICLE
Because for the purposes of this survey, I don't care who's all watching One Piece. I already know that One Piece has a huge fan base. I want to know about the new shows.
>> ARTICLE
It's not just about *One Piece*. How big of a fan base does *Space Brothers* have? *Cardfight!! Vanguard*? *Gifu Dodo!!*?

But hey, if that's the data you wanted, that's the data you wanted.

Things I found surprising from the results:

* Free! did not break the top 5 in either category (but it came very close). Given that it has massive nameshare here, I fully expected it to take #2 under the unstoppable Monogatari train, but apparently there are plenty of people who aren't even slightly curious
* Really surprised that Gatchaman Crowds beat out so many other shows that people just talk about more here. I hadn't even heard of Gatchaman before just recently, but apparently /r/anime knew about it.
* The high popularity of Servant x Service was surprising. I didn't think people paid enough attention to know that it was by the author of Working!!
* I thought people actually liked Loliball and Symphogear, but they somehow polled lower than the yuri fluff, the strange mahou shoujo, the screwball hipster show of the season, and an obtuse animal abuse comedy.
* Not surprising, but all these people missing out by not watching Tamayura, Teekyuu, and Milky Holmes sequels...it's not like the first seasons aired *that* long ago. That said, a whopping 4 people (myself included) are most anticipating Tamayura.
>> ARTICLE
> I thought people actually liked Loliball and Symphogear...

I know! Only me and one other person picked Loliball as most aticipated?!
>> ARTICLE
It's because the rest of us don't want to have a personal meeting with Chris Hansen
>> ARTICLE
> The high popularity of Servant x Service was surprising. I didn't think people paid enough attention to know that it was by the author of Working!!

Actually I didn't even know that. It just looks pretty interesting. Shows about government workers going about their lives has ridiculous potential comedic value.

>> ARTICLE
Neither did I. I want to redo my poll entry...
>> ARTICLE
So you and me and two other fuwa fuwas
>> ARTICLE
It was amusing since all four of those votes were cast really early, so at an early stage Tamayura was in the top 5 most anticipated shows.
>> ARTICLE
>Symphogear

People seem to get offended whenever I've mentioned I liked Symphogear.  It was a very fun show, it's one of the shows I'm most looking forward to this season, but it gets a lot of vitriol on this site.
>> ARTICLE
Symphogear is the epitome of beauty, truth, and awesomeness
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say that the anime we say we're going to watch on this poll necessarily represents *all* of the anime we're going to watch. This season I came in only expecting to watch two series and I ended up watching thirteen.

I'm legitimately curious who the people are the are going to watch 19+ anime in one season. The 12 or so I have feels like overkill already
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching 19, with two or three on the "might pick up if I drop other stuff and I hear that they're good". I picked 10+ the last three seasons too, although in each case I dropped at least half of them. The last season I had fewer than 10 anime on my to-watch was last year's summer season.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching 20!

*I don't know how I'm going to do it either*. I watched like, 15 this season, so can't be... too different.
>> ARTICLE
The more people that are trying out Prisma Illya instead of dismissing it outright, the better
>> ARTICLE
I was disappointed by the lack of Fate/Stay remake, but I'm warming up to the idea of this show. Will have to see how it actually pans out, but it's in the right place to be a sleeper hit.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually pretty excited for Blood Lad. I've read the manga and I thought it was pretty entertaining. 

That said, I'm also pretty excited for TWGOK. 

I'm also a fan of 4-koma so I'm also looking forward to Servant x Service. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm one of 12 people who're watching way too many shows. Cool.

So seeing spot #1 and #2 got me intereted. I didn't watch any prequel of both. Do i need to or just recommendation?
>> ARTICLE
You should watch the prequels for both anime. They're good and you will get to know the characters, it's never bad. (Well, I don't know for TWGOK since I dropped S2 but it seems like a lot of people liked Season 2. For Monogatari, it's OK. Bake was good, Nise was more fan service-y but it was still enjoyable imho)

Edit : Neko was nice too ! More plot than Nise at least.
