I never expected the final episode to be like that. But at the end of the day, it wasn't about the sport, it was about their lives. That part when we saw a photo of the top 3 at the tourny showed it all: Smile was....smiling. It was a beautiful ending to an anime I picked up because I play the sport, and I'll admit the artwork at first put me off, but it took just 15 mins to get into the artwork and this anime, and wow, what a beautiful anime

I feel like the wanderer, please forgive me, lets start again

This is a beautiful analysis. Props to you for taking the time to write it. Have you been doing this for other anime?

I agree. The series took me by surprise. I hated the art at first, but it quickly grew on me. I have a question though it may be a bit personal. What do you do for a living? You don't have to answer.

Thanks for the read.

I'm literally tearing up from all this happiness. This show is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Its like the Wanderer was speaking to a lover, repentant after straying. I was cracking up thinking he was talking to his girlfriend or something.
>> ARTICLE
I didnt know whether to laugh or cry in happiness at that scene, it was just perfect
>> ARTICLE
Either's fine - joy is joy, my friend. 
>> ARTICLE
I think he was just talking about life and how he misses the environment he had so much fun and found so much comfort in without realizing it. It's an easy play on the "you don't know what you have until you lost it" cliche, but with a "no one ever said you couldn't go back" twist on it.

Still a beautiful moment out of a very pleasing finale episode.
>> ARTICLE
There was so many great moments in that episode, although [this was one of the things I was most happy to see.](http://i.imgur.com/fGMOYBN.jpg)

The ending really gave great closure to all of the characters, making for a really satisfying finale. Great series, and now Thursdays will be a little less exciting for a while.

Not only successful, but if that picture on the newspaper is him, he also apparently became a supermodel in the meantime. I mean, he was always one of the better looking characters, but, damn. . .
>> ARTICLE
Does the uniform and word "naturalization" mean that he's playing for Japan? If so, AWESOME!
>> ARTICLE
Yep. He played for Japan instead of china. Kong Wenge is based on 2 actual ping pong players (names combined)
>> ARTICLE
So... Kong Linghui and Ma Wenge? Interesting, thanks!

I was overwhelmingly happy when it showed Kong being successful

He become  successful only when accept he's situation, and  his purpose to play now is not to went back home. Man how i love this show!
>> ARTICLE
I never thought that a ping pong anime would be in my top 15 
>> ARTICLE
You accidentally added a 5. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that was a good ending. The "all grown up, follow your dreams" ending reminds me of Kids on the Slope, another one of my favorites. Ping Pong has made my top 5.
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, you're right, these two animes really are similar in many respects. Specifically, Smile reminds me of Kaoru in that they're both outsiders who have a passion and skill that are brought out by a catalyst type character: Peco and Sentaro.
>> ARTICLE
Kids on the Slope is easily the first thing that would come to mind if a Ping Pong fan asked me for a recommendation. I guess I now have to recommend Ping Pong to Watanabe fans...

Just kidding. I'm going to recommend it to *everyone* from now on.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, that was a perfect ending to this show. Pretty much everything was spot on the entire series, and I'm so glad it ended on such a high note. Just when I thought the OST couldn't get any better, episode 11 comes along.
>> ARTICLE
That time-skip was both unexpected and highly appropriate. Honestly, I'm sitting here trying to think of a single flaw, and the only one I have is a nitpick - I wanted a few more minutes of Smile and Peco's match, of them clashing, their rackets raging. 

Ultimately, this was a story about people, and their ambitions, and their fears. About their relationships with each other, and themselves. I'm sad to see it go, but unlike so many other great shows, I don't want anymore - their story is done, their narrative told. I will keep my fond memories, and make my greatest effort to let other people know about this show, so they can experience what I experienced, feel what I felt.

One last time:

*Hero Kenzan! Hero Kenzan!* ***Hero Kenzan!***


>> ARTICLE
> I wanted a few more minutes of Smile and Peco's match

You described my exact feelings
>> ARTICLE
Skipping over the match itself just reflects the consistent themes of the series: It's not about the sport, it's about why you play. Even more so than ever with this final match.

> I don't want anymore - their story is done, their narrative told.

I know this isn't true for all works, but stories often end with a dissatisfying "resolution." A real resolution like the one in this show is hard to come by, and, in my opinion, demonstrates just how great Ping Pong is.
>> ARTICLE
Also shows that when Peco and Smile play each other, competition goes out the window - it's just childlike glee.
>> ARTICLE
Notice how we never got shown the score even once. It's as if we are watching a duet, not a match.

Welcome to Pong Pong, where heroes are real and the points don't matter
>> ARTICLE
I'm crying literal tears of joy. It was so good. [That ending couldn't have been greater or more cathartic.](http://imgur.com/a/MUDEu)

>> ARTICLE
Whoa, I didn't even notice the Wanderer at the Olympics! Great album :)
>> ARTICLE
And he was wearing a team jersey! He made the team!
>> ARTICLE
doubt it. Most likely just a supporter jumper
>> ARTICLE
Disagree. Same shirt that Peco and Kong were wearing. I think he pulled a Peco, started over and became a top player

He wouldn't be in the general audience seat by himself if that's the case

you just don't have the talent. Give up, grow a pompadour, and get yourself a beautiful wife and 3 kids

Nice gallery. The only thing I would add is a picture of the Beach/Mountains guy cheering in the audience at the Olympics.
>> ARTICLE
Was he in the audience or was he part of the team? The polo threw me off.

>> ARTICLE
He was in the audience, but wearing a uniform. My guess is it's just the typical sports fan wearing the team jersey deal. I did have to go double check that he was surrounded by regular audience members because the outfit threw me off as well.
>> ARTICLE
Im just going to go ahead and believe that after reaffirming his faith in ping pong he went on to compete in the Olympics. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say he was in the team. 

He came back, decided he loved the sport and dedicated himself like Peco did. 
>> ARTICLE
But then why was he in the crowd? I would love to believe he was on the team, but it doesn't really make sense. At the high school games the athletes watched from the crowd, but I've never seen any athletes do that at the Olympics. At least not for a sport they participate in.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe yes... I was going that way *because* the athletes sat in the crowd for the inter-high games.

FWIW - the scene with Peco at the end may or may not be the Olympics. It could be a world championships or other international competition.
>> ARTICLE
It's changed! I didn't even notice him.
>> ARTICLE
Smile crying during the match got me going, then the rest just opened the floodgates. This was the best ending I could have imagined. 10/10 AOTY so far for me.
>> ARTICLE
Goodbye, AOTS. I'll miss you. I love ya!
>> ARTICLE
AOTY

FTFY
>> ARTICLE
What a beautiful way to end such a beautiful show. Without a doubt the best sports show I've ever seen; Masaaki Yuasa has certainly cemented his place as one of my all-time favorite directors. I just feel privileged being able to say I was here for the ride.
>> ARTICLE
Check out his other works if you haven't already. Tatami Galaxy, Kaiba, and Mind Game are all great. 
>> ARTICLE
That time skip was so unexpected but oddly satisfying, even though I never really liked them. Ping Pong was a great show, and definitely one to be remembered, even for non-sports anime fans. I will definitely be re-watching this show.

Fantastic end for a fantastic show. 

Ping Pong was fairly restrained for a Yuasa show, but that Peco vs. Smile match felt very Yuasa (probably because he also directed this episode). I loved how loose the movements felt after Smile had fallen into the barrier. Limbs and even the table were moving in really interesting ways, there was just so much energy.

And that musical sequence, ugh, so good, so emotional. Even just that pan to the photo of the high school tournament with Smile grinning even though he placed second really got me. Yuasa really knows how to tug on your heartstrings without it being cloying or unearned.

Kong Wenge made a comeback too! I'm glad my favorite character got a happy end.

>> ARTICLE
> I loved how loose the movements felt after Smile had fallen into the barrier. Limbs and even the table were moving in really interesting ways, there was just so much energy.

I'd say it was to indicate that both were searching for the upper hand and balance in the game. Peco and Smile tried to put each other in as difficult situations as possible resulting in a very fast-paced game where both players couldn't force a dominant game.

Its pretty disheartening that people will instantly dismiss this show because of its art and animation.  The characters are all so lovable, the soundtracks are amazing, the story and ending leaves me with a *smile* on my face.  The soundtrack uses the mesmerizing sounds of a ping pong ball getting hit back and forth to create unique and in the moment songs, And intense dubstep in matches was rightfully used to create intense moments. Not to mention the ending song between our two heroes ;) . The art grew on me through the series and by the end I don't think I would of had it any other way.  This for me was the anime of the season and a 9/10 for me.

This is what I don't understand. Masaaki Yuasa has one of the most beautiful and original styles in animation right now, and that people are turned off by it in contrast to a more 'typical' style... It doesn't really compute with me.

Damn this was amazing i can't even describe the [feels](http://i.imgur.com/KtHp0BH.jpg) i get when watching it. It's really sad the amount of people who probably skipped it because of the unusual art style.

Oh and that [reference](http://i.imgur.com/t8ryNqH.jpg)! god damn unexpected, made me burst out laughing

10/10 from me.

[Also, for a better understanding of the "Blood tastes like Iron" quote](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/1yat95/favorite_manga_quotes/)
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm coming in late but-I thought it was because he was finally playing as a person rather than a robot. "My blood tastes like iron." means "I'm human, I'm not a robot, this isn't about calculations and destroying my opponent-it's about enjoying the game."  That's what it was to me and that's the great thing about symbolism-everyone sees it in their own way.
>> ARTICLE
My understanding of that quote is that Smile has always consider himself being a robot because he's full of iron. Peco just showed that he can be both full of iron and be human as well. As for what iron means in this story it's up to personal interpretation whether it be the stone cold nature or something else
>> ARTICLE
I assume like that, too.
>> ARTICLE
The reference is perfect. A good nod to a classic with some similar themes and characters, even though they seem entirely unrelated at first glance (ping pong on the one hand and giant mechas on the other).

Also, as for the "(my) blood tastes like iron" quote, I definitely agree with that analysis. I just want to point out that those two aspects are definitely building on top of all the themes that have been developed thus far. Smile being a robot and Peco being an enthusiastic, carefree hero, not to mention Kong, Kazama, and Sakuma.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know that name of that song that was sung in the middle? It's now responsible for two of my favorite scenes in anime.
>> ARTICLE
I was so sure I would not cry in this episode, but as soon as it started playing, it was a tearfest. Brought back all the GITS memories. What a perfect way to end this beautiful anime!
>> ARTICLE
Reminded me of [this song from the anime film Colorful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKESt_WVMP0) that plays during one of the emotional high points towards the end. I love emotional choir-sung songs in soundtracks. They always seem to fit their scenes perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
It was an old children's song called "Tenohira wo Taiyou ni."
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. 
>> ARTICLE
It immediately threw me back to GitS.
>> ARTICLE
Was that in 2nd Gig?

>> ARTICLE
Yup
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, i had goosebumps before i even recognised it consciously 
>> ARTICLE
I immediately began tearing up, the first instant it began playing, took me another half a second to recognize it. That song is etched within me.
>> ARTICLE
In the end, Smile played ping pong to find his humanity (his blood), Kazama played for others (family), and only Kong and Peco played to be the best. Makes sense that they are the ones to make it to the Olympics. 
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Tell me about it, I have nothing against sports anime, but what with this being my first season, it was also my first one. Not that I won't watch more, but I don't expect any sports show to every beat Ping Pong.
>> ARTICLE
If you do ever feel like checking out another sports anime, definitely check out [Cross Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5941/Cross_Game). In a similar vein to Ping Pong, Cross Game is really more about the characters than the sport (which is baseball). I would consider it more of a slice of life/coming of age, and it's done really well. Just watch the first episode and I think you will be hooked :D
>> ARTICLE
The best sports anime I could name is Touch. If you do watch it don't read up on it at all as this series can be seriously ruined by big spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Then you will miss out on Ippo...


Ippo and this are probably 2 best sport anime without much competition.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
One thing I loved about Ping Pong was that it was very honest in how it represented talent vs hard work. Kazuma had been playing for his entire life non-stop. Hero-kun had been back in the sport after a long "break" of not caring, and still stomped him to the ground. It annoys me when Anime fall into the trope of "the one with the most work always wins!!!". That isn't how the real world works, almost ever.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like it's more common for anime to the protagonist "the chosen one."
>> ARTICLE
Sakuma or Kazama?
>> ARTICLE
Both actually. I'm just glad the anime stayed true to what it had earlier said about talent being the king of ping pong.
>> ARTICLE
To some extent, that's true. But that match was about more than talent vs effort. Kazama lost primarily because he was shortsighted, not because he wasn't inherently "good enough." If anything, Sakuma is a far better example of that theme at work, as he gave up ping pong because he knew he lacked the talent.
>> ARTICLE
I actually think TBNRandrew is so wrong about this. I think people actually overate talent soooo much. Hard work 99% of the time >>>> talent. The only reason people talk so much about talent is because it gives themselves an excuse for not winning.
>> ARTICLE
Of course, works of fiction exaggerate this trope of "I'm a natural genius; I haven't practiced in years but I'll beat this guy that's practiced five hours a day since he was three years old."

But it's absolutely true that natural talent varies, and it's not at all fair. Two people who practice the exact same amount are unlikely to be at the exact same skill level. Somebody who puts in less effort could still end up winning. It's not a rare occurrence. Still, I'd be more tempted to attribute this to luck than to natural talent. Competitions all involve elements of subjectivity and randomness.
>> ARTICLE
I think Ippo actually does a good job of explaining boxing and the pacing is rather good. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Sure, I can understand where you're coming from if it didn't work for you. The pacing and humour are what I think makes Ippo, but if that initial part doesn't grab you I can get that.

Personally I feel that sports series work that get translated to anime tend to suffer a little, as they need a certain amount of action for the people watching and tend to be lighter on the other themes. Given what you've said, I'd like to make a couple of suggestions that might tickle your fancy. Stick to the manga versions of each.

Slam Dunk is one of those. You're going to have to go through the short section at the beginning where it covers rules occasionally, but it's heavy on character development and how the characters resolve some of the conflicts that were created in the past between them.

H2 and Touch are again heavily character driven, with the sports side in there to lighten the story up. H2's best moment actually belongs to one of the side characters, and especially poignant given the way the character is portrayed throughout the rest of the series.

Baby Steps is a series that is not afraid to hand out losses. A lot of sports series will have the team lose once, as a way to give the team something they can build on or recognise their short comings. Baby Steps is not like that. It's not afraid to hand out losses, and while the main character works to overcome those obstacles, there are times where he loses, puts in the time and then almost immediately loses again. It also time skips a significant part of the main character learning the game, so you keep that early arc to a minimum.

At any rate, I'm glad you enjoyed Ping Pong. It's one of the best sports series I've had the pleasure of watching in a good long time.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong's central themes are completely opposite that of the typical sports anime. The show was never about who would win, just about why they played.
>> ARTICLE
[Chihayafuru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10800/Chihayafuru) is another great sports anime. Not Ping Pong great but still excellent and incredibly marathonable.
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely second the marathonable part of that. In fact, if it's the kind of show that you would like, I don't see how you couldn't watch it all over a short time span; the cliffhangers are really hooking, and they pull off the "I need to watch the next episode!" feeling great.

It must have been hard for the people watching that show week by week.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope they make a third season once there's enough source material but watching it week-to-week is going to be painful.

If someone could get a picture of the top 3 of the tourney, that would be extremely appriciated. I am on mobile and can't do it myself.

Note: This is my first really serious review, so any feedback is appreciated!

Where do I even begin. I've asked myself that question about that show time and time again. I guess the best place to start, as always, is the beginning. Be warned, there are slight spoilers although I try not to. It's hard gushing about a show I love so much now without talking about ALL of it.

I saw this show on the Spring anime list. I thought, "I like ping pong, that's pretty funny, I wonder what the show will be about." I had not read the manga, I did not know any of the backstory. Looking back at it now, I much preferred it that way. 

The first episode was good. Not incredible, but good enough for me to say "Hey, maybe this can go somewhere." As I continued to watch, every week, I thought, "No way, this just can't get any better. There's absolutely no way this show could be any more awesome." And then, just like that, it was over. It was 11 weeks but it felt like a flash.

What caught me initially, what really hooked me and continued to play a strong role throughout the whole show (and what I'll be focusing on in the review, for good reason), were the characters. Oh man, the characters. Smile, Peco, Kazama, Butterfly Jo, the mountains guy, Akuma, Wenge... all of them were amazing in their own way. This wasn't a show about ping pong so much as it was a show about who they were. 

Seeing all these characters grow and learn was a wonderful experience. First, there was Wenge who lost and got knocked off his high horse. That was something, but even more so was when he got back up and set his mind to bettering himself with the support of his new team. 

Second, seeing Kazama go from the "big bully" to learning about why he did what he did. He wasn't just a gigantic a**hole who crushed people because it was fun. He had a REASON. His backstory showed how much pressure was on him to win. And, towards the end, he remembered how to have fun. That was a pleasure to see.

Third, and more of a minor thing, is seeing Akuma freed from his chains. His thought process was so single minded that he seemed to have forgot that there was more to life than just ping pong. It seems like a strange thing to say when so much of the show revolves around it, but he found happiness without a wooden paddle.

Fourth, learning about the character's backstories was handled exceptionally. Bits and pieces were sprinkled throughout the show, never overwhelming the viewer with one character at a time. And they were put in where they were needed most.

There was a unique reason for each of these characters to play. They had their flaws, their strengths, their friends, and their foes. There were "main" characters in Peco and Smile, but after seeing Wenge and Kazama and even Akuma develop as I talked about, they felt like just as big parts of the story as Smile and Peco.

But don't get me wrong, the culmination of the story was all Smile and Peco. The show did an incredible job of showing why they're such good friends. It's not because Peco talks a lot and Smile doesn't. It's because Smile was always pushing Peco from the shadows, rooting for his success because he liked seeing his friend happy. And Peco supported Smile by being there for him whenever he was needed. He was the "Hero" in Smile's life. 

Smile seemed like he was a robot. The joke from the beginning of the show was that he never smiled. Why was this? Why would a kid who seemed to be well off enough never smile? Why did he never go all out against his opponents when he was young? Those questions were presented and answered in a satisfying way.

Peco was also on a high horse. He didn't handle getting knocked down as well as Wenge, but the support from the old lady and Smile (although extremely indirectly) let him get back up again. Would he have done the same thing without his friends help? Who knows. The thing is, he had those friends to push him. 

Among those interactions, the psychological aspect of the show was incredibly strong as well. Questions like "Why do we play ping pong?", "Who do we play for?", "Is it about having fun or being the best?" caused me to think throughout the entire season and those questions were reflected individually with each character. 

Kazama played because he NEEDED to be the best. He had no alternative. 
Akuma played to become like Kazama. He wanted to be that good.
Wenge played because it was his escape. He wanted to go back home.
Smile played because he liked seeing Peco succeed. 
Peco played... because it was fun. 

On to the art. Some people might have turned away from this show because of the artstyle. I'm incredibly sad at this realization because a show's art style doesn't determine how good it is (see: Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Aku no Hana). It's a shame so many people are so ingrained in how anime is "supposed" to look that they can't see the beauty of a different style.

And this show managed to be beautiful. The art direction, the color changes, the subtle and drastic shifts in tone showed what good directing can do. An art style doesn't have to be the prettiest in the world to be the best. There are other ways art can take shape. 

Continuing on, the way the art was used throughout the story was truly unique. Giving the characters their own "avatars" in a way, the animators were able to create scenes that added immense value and emotion to some of the scenes where the characters are simply playing ping pong. Dragons, planes, heroes, robots... if someone heard this show out of context, they might think it was an action show. 

The soundtrack was always top notch as well. The opening? Fantastic. An amazing visual and auditory sensation combined into one powerful opening song with lyrics that reinforced the idea of having fun. It was always changing too. From episode to episode, it matched the mood and the tone, even if it seemed silly at times. 

Story was a bit lower than the others because honestly the story was in the characters. At a base level, it can be described as "Ping pong players try to compete for the world championships" but to leave it at that would be doing a huge disservice to the show. The characters made the story. 

I can't express how much I enjoyed this show. After I let it sink in I'll know a bit better, but I'm pretty sure it's my favorite of all time now. Every week I was dumbfounded at how a show about ping pong could be so overwhelmingly awesome. The answer is that it wasn't just about ping pong. It was about the characters as well. 

What I'm going to take away from this show is that ping pong, as well as all sports, is about having fun. If you focus on winning all the time, you're going to feel hollow and empty inside even if you DO win. And sometimes, we all need a reminder that having fun is the most important thing.

Even with all its slight flaws I give Ping Pong the Animation a 10/10. The rating says 10 is a masterpiece and I could not agree more with that. If I ever find out how to write to the author of this manga/the studio that made this show I'm going to express my enjoyment and my thanks. They did something utterly amazing.

Ping Pong, you were truly a show that was enjoyable above all others.

I'm ultra competitive even though I cannot claim to be a master at anything. 

To see all these characters find complacency after trying to be number one at the same sport, forces me to think deeply about what do I really want to achieve in life.

Basically, I'm mid-twenties unemployed might go back to school, but then again maybe not. I could just chase after my old animation dreams. Who knows. 
 
>> ARTICLE
That was a fantastic conclusion to an amazing series. I wasn't excepting there to be so little focus on the final match, but in retrospect it makes a lot of sense. This show knows when to show the action, and when to focus on the characters, and this episode did it exactly right. Peco's victory was a foregone conclusion, because the hero has to win. But they showed just enough of the match to show Smile's growth and prove to us that this time he was not letting Peco win, but getting the match he had long been waiting for. 

The timeskip was unexpected but very welcome. I'm not surprised Smile did not stay with the sport as a real athlete, it was always a game to him, and now he has enough good friends who he can have great matches with even without continuing to the Olympics. Speaking of which it's nice to see Peco and Kong both on the same team and Kong embracing his departure from China by becoming a Japanese Citizen. It was also interesting to see that Kazuma was off the team, most likely meaning there are several players in Japan better than him now aside from Smile and Peco. His conversation with Smile really showed how much he has grown and changed after his lose against Peco and it was a joy to see.

Earlier in the episode the conversation between the coaches was interesting. They had been tricking us for a long time into believing that Koizumi through his match against Tamura since she had mentioned her bad knee a few times, but in actuality it was the president of Poseidon (I can't remember his name aside from Kazama). I'm sure knee injuries are not uncommon in the sport, and they also implied that Tamura's might have just been due to old age anyway.

Finally I can't not mention mountain guy (does he have a name?). His scene while watching Peco vs Smile was fantastic, and he was also in the audience at the Olympics. He has regained his love for the sport even if it's only as a spectator.

Does anyone know when this show's OST comes out?
>> ARTICLE
August 27
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Are you sure? I was under the impression they explicitly stated it was Poseidon's president which had the infamous knee injury.


>> ARTICLE
I don't remember that up until now. Whenever they talked about knee injuries it was almost always about Tamura. There may have been a hint or 2 I did not pick up on earlier, but I definitely don't think it was stated outright. Most of the conversation in these discussion threads about the issue were talking about how Koizumi-Tamura was being mirrored by Smile-Peco.

>> ARTICLE
I remember that koizumi stated it was kazama who he let win when told smile his backstory so it was explicitly stated
>> ARTICLE
yup, and kazama used the victory to help bring up his company 
>> ARTICLE
The sub didn't translate it, but Kazama suffered a stress fracture to his left little toe which didn't heal well, and that affected his playing.

It's ironic isn't it since after Ping Pong he doesn't have much else. This break could proven to be highly valuable to him

Wow, we're at the finale. Already. Funny I say that, cause thus far to me the show is closer to 9.9/10 than 10/10, because I just feel the whole dramatic arc would've worked better in a movie format, with everything being compressed, even as I don't feel we've wasted time. The plot-structure follows the usual sports show, but the way it handles things is as a drama.

Time for Smile and Peco. The same situation as Coach Koizumi and Kazama the Eldest, two friends with one of them being wounded. But the whole point is that they must play while giving it their all, to enjoy it fully, to *fly*, to *smile*.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) Donning The Past to Fight The Future:**

1. [Two lil kids with dangling feet, curious, brave, shy, gangly](http://i.imgur.com/s4A3Ovl.jpg). Buddies. I like it.

1. [Kazama had always been one to own up](http://i.imgur.com/qSHcrXl.jpg), to say it's up to effort, and talent. If you win, it's because your talent and hard work carried you. He lost, but he'd been at his *best*. You know why? Because he was *flying*. Playing against Peco, his restraints, which he hadn't even realized had been there, had been removed.

1. It's like a carnival, everyone is acting as if there's no more tension, "These players are good, Kaio lost, awesome, and we're out." Chilling, buying merch but *we* know, the real game is about to start, the game that it's all about. The game of friendship.

1. "Who do we cheer for?" - ["Both. You cheer whenever *either* scores a point."](http://i.imgur.com/pXn0jYl.jpg) Coach Koizumi, I love you. Some people root with their all when their team scores, or cry out when the opposing team scores. Me? I love the *plays*. I love those tennis matches where I'd go "YES!" whenever either player scored. This is the best way to enjoy a match, if you ask me, even if the emotions might not run as high.

1. For the last 2-3 episodes I've been calling it, that it's a rematch of Jou versus Kazama the elder, and now the situation is the same, [and in case someone didn't notice or forgot, the show reminds us what is at stake](http://i.imgur.com/4CP6J6D.jpg). Friendship - is it an act of friendship to not give it your all so your friend's dream will live on, or is it an act of friendship to give it your all so both of you could fly? There's no right or wrong answer.

**2) The True Hero (- *Ikari Shinji*!):**

1. "[What happens when you go after a hero's weak point?](http://i.imgur.com/3WWpYBY.jpg)" - "[Heroes don't have weak points.](http://i.imgur.com/bYdTh9w.jpg)" Which feeds into what I wrote several episodes ago. Smile became the big robot, the "Monster", to force Peco to be the hero and defeat him. Peco must prove he is the hero by defeating Smile, and in so doing will save Smile from having to be the monster. If Peco loses, then he wasn't the hero. This is the same situation as with Kazama, who killed the potential heroes, to show them that they are not.

1. "Third child, I musn't run, AT field" - [All those NGE references](http://i.imgur.com/Vfn2cbe.jpg). Peco as "The Hero" :D A hero who converses with robots, and sees them as family. Peco mustn't run away! He did, but he came back.

1. [Peco is still as he used to be, as a child](http://i.imgur.com/BxTEryS.jpg). Smile's excitement is at seeing his hero having fun, and how he could be like him.

1. "[It's fun just watching](http://i.imgur.com/sdCym11.jpg)" We know you want in, Smile! Good thing Peco roped Smile in. He gave him a *name*, he christened him, it was the birth of a new person, of a new road in life. One that isn't locked in the closet, out of sight. Time for the spotlight at center-stage, Smile.

1. "[Let's go partner.](http://i.imgur.com/dNHQYoZ.jpg)" - "Hmm." which is the same one he used when he was invited to play Ping Pong with Peco for the first time, when he was called out into the light. It takes *two* players to play, and have fun. It's a cheap thing you're doing here Ping Pong the Animation, making my eyes all misty ;_;

**3) Giving It Our All:**

1. [Coach Koizumi is shocked!](http://i.imgur.com/qK2DVXm.jpg) To say he'll crush Peco and drive a stake into his injury is one thing, but here he is, the consummate player, the *robot*, the best player who will let nothing get in the way of his victory. Or rather, the one who will ensure it's a hero appearing. Fast-paced music, and the two competing lines - "My blood tastes like iron" and "A hero is sure to appear." - He's a monster, but he still wishes to be saved from this cage of steel.

1. [Peco is so cool!](http://i.imgur.com/KDqFpmM.jpg)

1. [Smile breaks through his restraints](http://i.imgur.com/zqYpGOT.jpg). He's a robot, quiet where no one can see him and harm him. But one doesn't need to be a robot with one's friend. One doesn't need to be a robot when one can have fun. Smile is his own hero. He's *shining*.

 Even "My blood tastes like iron" is a reminder of time spent with friends. Of fun, of knowing oneself. It's not a sign of being a robot, but of being freed from being one.

1. [The hero is](http://i.imgur.com/lK95vfw.jpg), [the hero is](http://i.imgur.com/7vfGHT4.jpg) [the hero is](http://i.imgur.com/vk0RXtD.jpg) so human that he transcends humanity, showing humanity the most it can be. The hero is joy incarnate. The opposite of the darkness-bringing monster, and the fun-removing robot. The hero is *light*. Of course he can fly, for his body is made of light.

**4) Reflected Light:**

1. [Mountain-Sea dude needed to travel the world in order to come back home and realize it *is* home](http://i.imgur.com/Ngzh36F.jpg). Peco and Smile shine so brightly together that their light shines on all those around them, reminding them that loving the game so much as to quit it due to losing simply makes no sense.

 Ha! He now said as much himself :)

1. ["You won't have to move, I've got a great racket for senior citizens!"](http://i.imgur.com/PamAj9P.jpg) - So *lewd*! ;-) But seriously, those old timers. Kazama the elder looks menacing and serious to everyone, except his old friends with whom he can be himself. "I thought winning will make everyone happy." - His "toughness, grit!" message was aimed to make everyone happy by helping them win, but it put too much pressure on them, and took the fun out, *especially* when they've won. Good intentions and all that.

 [Kazama the eldest also looks younger and more relaxed here](http://i.imgur.com/CYSpIRd.jpg), when he doesn't have to be in his "Grit!" mentality, when he doesn't have to be a monster. Like Smile, he's reminded of his youth.

1. Fuck. *Fuck*.  "We're alive, all of us are alive, and that's why we sing." I have a conditioned reflex to crying when this song plays. I've actually watched that *other* scene with this song about a month ago ;_; "We're alive, that's why we're sad."

 Of course, now we see all the children playing, we see how all of life is connected, how all the players are connected to one another, via their ping-pong, via their iron-tasting blood, via their lives. "We're alive, that's why we laugh. We are all alive, and that is why we sing." - Smile can only feel alive, can only relate to others via Ping Pong, because that's how he was shown he's part of the community of the living. To Smile and Peco, to play Ping Pong is to *sing*. To sing is to fly. To transcend logic, and the boundaries of our lives.

**5) Life Goes On:**

1. Time-skip! Smile passing on the joys of ping pong, and the love of his prior coaches! Also, ["Today I'll teach you a sweet unhittable serve!"](http://i.imgur.com/ielcHHE.jpg) - He sounds just like Peco, the one he wanted to become like.

 "He hardly coaches, and he skips on top of that." - He *did* become Peco ;-)

1. Awww, love-struck Coach Koizumi, excited that Tsukimoto will come, *hours* from then.

1. [Kong made a home for himself](http://i.imgur.com/Hl5iGA5.jpg), no longer in exile. We're checking in on everyone.

1. [Kazama having no girlfriend] "Did I go wrong somewhere?" - That's what happens when the Hero arrives too late for you :P

1. "I don't think staking your life on table tennis is such a bad thing." - "No way." Growth comes to us all, with some help from a hero.

1. Smile throwing away the old and discarded racket, he's embracing his future. And Peco? Peco is still on his journey to the top. Will he get there? Does it matter? He'll have fun doing his best on the road, crushing monsters, giving off the joy of Ping Pong.

**Post Episode Thoughts / Show Summary:**

"It doesn't matter which of them wins" the old ones have said. As Smile said before, they didn't need to watch them, because they knew they'd win. Which one of them? Both of them. They won by getting to play one another, by going all out, and the other side reciprocating by going all out as well. The ping pong they love, with the people they care about.

I keep getting asked if I'll write an editorial on this show. Honestly, where does one even begin? So many threads, and all of them important. It's the tapestry of a life. And yet, it all ties together. This show's greatest strength as a narrative is how nothing in here came as a surprise, everything had been foreshadowed, everything had been built up to, and no matter what happened, it felt *organic*, as if it had made sense.

This episode had multiple endings. But it made sense. This show was about a journey, a journey to return to the start. A journey to bring the beginning into the future. It wasn't a journey where we lament our lost friendship, but where people fight to bring it back, through actions, and not through words. It's the story of Smile and Peco, and the story of previous generations.

It's a journey, and the journey of life never ends, which is why we had to see there's life after the match, that it's not do or die, that it is only the beginning of life, and of friendship.

This show had been a samurai drama up until the last arc, where the point was made that looking at life, looking at sports, and looking at friendships through the blade of a racket is no way to make friends, and lead a happy life. Through the match, they spoke, just like the samurai in manga do, but to them it wasn't a discussion that had to end, with one's swan song, but one that can be had time and time again.

It was a marvelous show, and I'm giving it a very hearty 9.8/10. I feel it could've been a bit shorter to make it stronger, even as I have enjoyed and thought everything that was there was good. It's not mutually exclusive. Think I'll check the live-action film.

Phenomenal show. I was putting off watching this for so long and caught up yesterday. I'm so glad I did. I would recommend this to anyone, even if they don't like sports or anime.
>> ARTICLE
I loved how the imessage chats before the match begins actually *dehype* the match. It just follows the theme that Peco and Smile create such childlike joy when playing that the "competitive" edge has pretty much been eradicated from the tournament. Everyone seems to be having *such* a good time at the beginning of the episode, everyone's so chill, it's just beautiful.

The only thing that I didn't like about this series is that it ended after only 11 episodes - how I long for more.

One of my top 10's of any TV Series, Anime or otherwise, just a class act from beginning to end. Full of heart and passion in the fluid artistry and story-telling, wonderful and diverse characters who all felt *human* - and that was the main thing about this show, you felt connected to their struggles and you wanted them to persevere through their adversity and achieve success.

And that's not to say that Peco's success was any greater than the others, not at all. Success meant something different to each individual, and they chased that dream even if they failed in the end because that's what being alive and human is about: We all have life flowing through our veins, prove you're alive and pursue your interests! Break free from your anxieties and fly! The last 10 minutes of this episode constantly reiterated that point.

A solid 10/10. It wasn't pretty, it was crude, vibrant, flowing and packed with emotion, it rejected the standard conventions of what an anime should 'look like' and established it's own personality outside the realm of mediocrity and delivered a truly compelling story that I shall not forget anytime soon. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked the ending, but it did feel like Hoshino was perhaps too overpowered.
Not only he defeated Kazama with a bad knee, he also proceeded to defeat Smile, which did not take it easy on him. And with a fraction of the training (though it did show he trained a lot when he was a kid)

Easily AOTY for me. Next two seasons need not apply. Also, OST release when?

I feel like Kazama vs Peco was the action epitome of the show; this was the feels epitome. in a general sense ya'kno?

ALSO! is there an OST out? I know it JUST ended but iunno~
>> ARTICLE
Man, I almost forgot how great anime can be. Ping Pong is just so good that it's on a completely different level from almost everything else. 

When this show started I knew it was going to be executed well, but I'm not a big fan of sports stories. I expected to watch this and enjoy it, but I really expected nothing special.

Ping Pong blew every one of my expectations completely out of the water. I have been smiling all through the last few episodes. This show has been consistently amazing each and every week. The ending is perfect too. The timeskip came out of nowhere and yet felt like the most perfect possible way to end this story. It wrapped up everyone's character arcs and gave solid resolution to the plot.

One minor thing I really loved was Kong fully becoming a Japanese citizen. You can only see it for a moment, but in the news it shows that he has a Japanese name now (Tsujido Wenge). He has really embraced his new home, and seeing him succeed is great after all he went through. 

I don't know if I can call this my favorite anime ever yet, but it's a very strong contender. It's in my top 5 at minimum. I'm still blown away by how good this has been.
>> ARTICLE
This episode brought me to tears... This is the most beautiful anime I've ever watched, the symbolism, the pieces of the puzzle all falling together in the last episode. When Smile broke free of his robot cage and turned into a being full of blood, it's just amazing. Seriously such a great anime, and it's true to its characters too. Smile became a teacher, that's typical! He was never going to be an athlete. It's just not his personality. Peco became a champion. Kazuma realises where he's gone wrong. I just love it.

10/10, I'm a big fan of sports anime but this was really something unique and special.
>> ARTICLE
HIGHLY unexpected fast forward and completely perfect for the ending. 

How everybody was sad that Kong would not make it? BAM there he is happy, Peco is going to be the world champion, Smile is happy, Sakuma is happy, Kazama will for sure be happy in the end...

What an amazing ending for an amazing anime.

My friend (who also watches this anime with me) from the other room: "come the match is starting!"

I rush to the room, with some football being played on the tv: "this aint no fucking peco vs smile, you better call me later when this crap ends, we got a real match to see later!"
>> ARTICLE
If only they've shown a bit more of the match haha.
>> ARTICLE
I almost teared up multiple times, this is such a good ending to such a good series.
But I can't figure out why Smile, after finding Peco's old paddle, would toss it back into the water. Any ideas?
>> ARTICLE
Kazama returning, talking about how good Smile could have been, was sort of symbolized by the old racket returning; sort of a physical "what if..". By throwing it away, he casts aside the past and the "possibilities" and entrusts it to the sea/Peco. 

edit: further paralleled as the same thing when Peco threw the same racket away; he is cutting his ties with ping pong as a player
>> ARTICLE
Well, that was so much better than expected.

The timeskip showed that they're all still friends. It wasn't until the ED started playing that it really hit me that it was over. I was crying tears out of happiness, which doesn't happen very often.

>> ARTICLE
Amazing final episode, I loved the timeskip.

I'm really glad I picked this show up.
>> ARTICLE
Well, everyone, it has been my pleasure to share this experience with you. Truly a masterpiece from beginning to end that will continue to be talked about in years to come.

It feels so incredible to experience a perfect show in 2014 as it comes out. I guess the hero always comes.

What are the odds of this coming to DVD/Blu-ray in the US? I loved it and I want to show it to my dad.

Holy shit. This anime.

This anime was fucking amazing. I don't even...how in the hell did an anime about *ping pong* manage to be so gripping, so thrilling, so *profound*? This is easily one of the best coming-of-age stories in a medium chock full of them. Tremendous work. 

Now I need to read the manga, because holy crap, this was amazing. I think this might be my first 10/10. I, I have to write a review on this anime or something, because holy fuck I love this anime so much, I don't even...

That amazing music hype at the beginning of their match. This show wasn't just about the sport, but rather the journey of each character and the development they go through. That is exactly what I loved about this anime. The epilogue at the end ties everything together well, and even shows who won which was neat, and leaves a feeling of happiness when it ends. At first, people may be turned off by the art, but story was what carried this. The ending match was like a "closer than brothers, now we need to fight each other" feeling (haha ygo). Great show, would go along the ride again.
>> ARTICLE
Love ya, Peco!

Best show of the season for me. Sad its over =( Will be a long time before another sports anime comes along of this caliber!
>> ARTICLE
Jesus fucking Christ, that animation was gorgeous.
>> ARTICLE
What a nice end to an extremely entertaining (and quirky) show
>> ARTICLE
Well I didnt honestly expect it to end like that, But was an rather fitting ending to the series none the less.

Woulda loved a bit more of the match, but ohwell.

Overall ping pong gets a solid 9.2/10 for me
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts:

Just when I thought Ping Pong couldn't get any better, this episode came and just surpassed all expectations. 

My Review (forgive my ramblings): 
This episode neatly and expertly rounded out the main themes of: A) Not holding back, B) Freeing yourself of any restraints that you may or may not have been consciously aware of and C) Finding your own version of happiness. All the other characters were simply amazing, but I think the shining gem of this piece was undoubtedly Smile.

**Smile's Characterization:** His shy personality caused people to bully him which subsequently led to him shutting off his emotions to protect himself. Thus, his persona of a "robot" was born and it became to dominate his life. Peco then came along and saved him from the bullies, which made him a "hero" in Smile's eyes. He projected strength, confidence, and most importantly, happiness. 

Once Peco introduced Smile to ping pong, it became their way to strengthen their bond of friendship. Being able to go all out in a sport you love was their version of happiness back then. When Smile was playing to the best of his abilities, he was no longer a robot and had the time of his life. However, Smile soon realized that he was becoming better than Peco -- shattering that image of an invincible hero. In an attempt to not hurt his best friend's feelings, Smile had to restrain himself and limit the way he played even though it made ping pong boring for him. 

Fast forward to Peco losing his match against Akuma and later quitting Ping Pong because of his inability to cope with loss. This was the breaking point for Smile and in his round-a-bout way to make Peco the "Hero" that shined with strength and happiness, he embraced the role of the evil "Robot" and began to train. A hero is not born from defeating the weak, a hero is born from triumphing over the strongest opponent. Smile needed to be that strongest opponent for the Hero (Peco) to rise. 

In the end, Peco did rise to the challenge and defeated the evil "Robot" and Smile was able to see his Hero again, an even stronger and happier Hero. Smile moved past ping pong because it was always just a game to have fun with. Also, through Peco's renewed devotion and later success with ping pong, Smile also accepted that devoting your life to one thing is okay and even admirable.

To be honest, Smile had the damn best characterization I have seen in a long while. I know this review probably doesn't do Smile's characterization true justice, but I just had to get it out there. Thanks for reading if you made it this far!

**tldr: Smile best character.**  
>> ARTICLE
Mmm. I love ya Ping Pong. This is definitely my AOTS and AOTY so far. At first I felt confused and a little disappointed that we didnt get to see the end of the match, but then I realized that it just reflects the fact that the story isn't about the sport, but about the characters and just like obaba said, it doesn't matter. Felt so good to see Smile smiling and being happy and breaking out of his robotic habits to be set free. The flash back scenes got me emotional. So nice to see how they became friends and formed a strong bond with each other. "Let's go partner." Loved that the wanderer finally found his place. He has such a small part in the show but I feel like he is still a very important character along with the other main characters that have gone on their journeys and learned about themselves. Then when we see how Smile and Kazama (especially) have changed in the future and are now friends is awesome. Nice to see everyone turned out alright. "Blood tastes like iron." "A hero is sure to appear." So many memorable quotes. This show is definitely in my top 5 favorite shows. I think now I'll check out the live action movie. Now if only I could get my friends to watch this.
>> ARTICLE
Just like how a certain series showcased what it means to be a hero,  Ping Pong showed what hero means to others.
>> ARTICLE
Solid point!  Although the anime did kind of show what it means to be a hero too, and that is:

* Being incredibly gifted and talented.
* Being the kind of person that everyone gravitates towards and befriends.
* Training your ass off and constantly working to be your best.
>> ARTICLE
I'm happy that I gave this anime a chance, I would have seriously been missing out if I didn't.
>> ARTICLE
What a great ending for a great anime. 

These days it's very rare for a hyped anime to meet all the expectations but Ping Pong did it and then some. 

Truly one of the best in recent memory.

No his knee was messed up, he's just such an unbelievable bad ass that he toughed through it and / or is so good that he adjusted to it just so he could be the hero that Smile always thought he was.

One of the best anime ever. Definitively my top 5.  Such beautiful style, story and characters. There are so many subtleties that make this anime even better. Unique style. Gonna miss this anime. Are there any other animes directed in this style?

I really hope more people will pick this show, really one of my favourite shows :)

Is this the end of the show? I'm going to watch it all now(stopped after episode 1 because it was so good and I didn't want to wait each week) if it's officially over, says it's only supposed to have 11 on MAL. How was it? 
>> ARTICLE
Yup 11 episodes is it. [Noitamina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noitamina) shows tend to be either 11 or 22 episodes long.
>> ARTICLE
Yurie still felt so out of place in this show because she doesn't have a role in the manga, but they wrapped up her story pretty well.
>> ARTICLE
Regarding to the ending of the final match, did the sorry explicitly mention how it went?

I assumed that both gave their best where Tsukimoto doesn't have to go easy on Hoshino for him to win.
>> ARTICLE
The best part is when Tsukimoto crashed into the board while returning, and instead of easing up Hoshino just bang one big one back so Tsukimoto can return it again. It was fantastic. Both sides giving their all, and both play another fantastic game together.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think anyone was expecting that kind of ending, but it was beautiful I actually sang along to "everyone is living". The moment it came on I was surprised, but it fit perfectly. What a beautiful end to what is a big contender to AotS.

Allthough I know what to expect because I've read the manga. Still, the anime had a great impact on me.

Is Kazama and the girl from Poseidon going out?

doub it, She's in Paris I think, and Kazama in Japan... they're already living their lives by their own.

But she said to her dad that she will return to Japan once she is successful(she already is in Paris), so it's up to you since the show already ended.
>> ARTICLE
In the epilogue, Kazama says "wonder if I went wrong somewhere". Take from that what you will, but to me that implies that they are not dating.
>> ARTICLE
That pretty much guarantees that they're not dating and Kazama is still completely oblivious.

SMILE smiled!  
And he became quite human.

Tsukimoto smiles the same way as Wenge.

check my video for the best anime ending song of all time

this anime took me by surprise and am shocked that its in my top 10 anime all time

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skhtDzvDeTw
>> ARTICLE

1) Why didn't Wenge become a coach or something? His ending felt forced and incredibly out of place
He had already accepted that he didn't have what it takes and had also started to enjoy teaching his teammates, but then suddenly he's a top pro in the end? Bullshit

2) Kazama had more talent and worked much harder than Wenge. Unless he just straight up stopped giving a shit, which is the exact opposite of what he looked like after his match with Hoshino, he shouldn't fall off like that.

3) I thought the entire "We are all human and love each other" part was kind of cheesy and completely unnecessary..

4) Yurie( anime original character) was only in there so that the show wasn't a complete sausage fest. I know She was key for developing Dragon and establishing the themes of moving forward in life and what you'll do to make it and blah blah blah but her character was poorly written  and obnoxious beyond belief.
Really fucking pointless addition. Could've saved so much time for other shit by removing her.

5) "Muh blood tastes like iron x100"
Sigh..

Well, what a goddamn disappointment. What the fuck are you doing, Yuasa. The manga end was perfect without all that corny shit.

6.5/10

This episode aired today.

I saw the exact same comments somewhere else.

Where exactly?

What.


The Anime and Manga endings where almost identical. The only differences was the anime only Chick, and the Kong bit (which is fine imo)

I needed a good pick-me-up, and seeing Kazama smile made me feel wonderful. This is becoming one of my all-time favorite series.

If this last episode is as good as the rest of the 10 episodes which all increase in amazing-ness, this will be my favorite show of all time hands down. I don't remember the last time a show made me feel like this. I don't even know how to describe it.

If I could meet the people who worked on this show I would shake all of their hands and kowtow several times. They have created a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, when I picked it up at the beginning of the season I didn't expect such an emotional ride.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I was certainly excited for this before it started airing, but I wasn't expecting it to be as awesome as it has been. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode reminded me of Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of  Being--the whole subject of "lightness" vs "heaviness". Kazama thinks power is heaviness, is burden, is how he *must* win because that's his identity. But Peco shows him that true power is lightness: doing something freely but with passion, flying around because his soul is light, very much like how Nietzsche used to described himself.

Kazama wants to win because he thinks it's his responsibility. Peco wins because he loves the very act of playing--so much so, that he frees Kazama from his own cage and reminds him the beauty and the exhilaration of Ping Pong. Hero kenzan.

Really fitting analysis; I wonder if Yuasa was thinking along the same lines, and if so where the other characters fit into that dynamic. 

I'd suggest that the Apollonian/Dionysiac binary also fits here, but that'd be contingent on the events that I imagine will occur in the next episode...
>> ARTICLE
The Apollo vs Dyonisus does make a lot of sense, actually! I think one of the reasons this series is a masterpiece is that it's made so that all the themes can be conveyed to almost anyone, but it's flexible enough to permit very complex analysis, too.

For example, I just commented elsewhere here that Peco vs Kazama might be a parallel to that classic fantasy story. You know the one: Hero slays Dragon to save the princess, except this time the "princess" is Kazama--nay, Ryuichi himself, who was enslaved by his Dragon persona.
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't until the ending finished playing that I realised I'd been smiling the entire episode. Good god the animation was incredible this episode, each and every rally was so awesome to watch. Really fell in love with Kazama by the end of the episode too, I've been waiting for him to[ have his moment](http://i.imgur.com/TlxUE8F.jpg) and it certainly delivered.
>> ARTICLE
agree brotha. most intense rallies YET and rewatching for detail i am pretty sure I see peco switch up the paddle's side MID rally like the coaches describe. 
>> ARTICLE
My favourite part was when Peco decides to just discard his injury and suddenly goes all out and jumping, that one time where he switches the side then returns the ball behind his back and gets the point was pretty epic.
>> ARTICLE
Man this [scene](https://i.imgur.com/hZ7YI0Z.png)

Best show I've seen the entire year. It's sad that so many people don't like it because the first episode wasn't very exciting and the animation isn't really appealing to many.
>> ARTICLE
Just watched this episode now. You're right they definitely don't know what they're missing. 
>> ARTICLE
So the hero slayed the dragon.

Interesting contrasting between Kazama who played as a way of remembering pain, and Peco, who plays for the fun. I don't have a long write up for this. It was great, bring on the finale. 
>> ARTICLE
In a way, he slayed the Dragon and saved the princess, who was Kazama himself, lol. True/classic hero story right there.
>> ARTICLE
The dragon had eaten the princess and the hero sliced him open from belly to neck to free her. Kazama was a damsel in distress this whole time!

"I gave him a bat which he can flip easily"

Someone tell me how the heck a Japanese penhold blade can be made easy to flip sides?! I couldn't do that! With Chinese style its so easy, but Japanese style has that lovely massive cork bridge.

Ok, rant over, I loved this episode! It was great seeing that little "dream" between Peco and Smile, the whole artwork was great for the entire match aswel. When you see a sports anime have those long stops in the game to do a meaningful talk it takes something away from the game, but the way they did these talks were great. That last one with the sound of the wind like they were on top of a mountain was a great touching moment!
>> ARTICLE
Usually it's used in doubles where you'd have time to flip. Peco is just a freak

Edit: Though in all honesty it was just a gimmick, which is why Ryu called it a toy. It mostly does more harm than good. Peco was just having too much fun fooling around and play like a Chinese player would (penhold with double sided). The flip is just for the fun of it.
>> ARTICLE
how has no one done it yet?

THE HERO APPEARS! THE HERO APPEARS! THE HERO APPEARS!
>> ARTICLE
I was legit sitting down in my basement nearly chanting THE HERO APPEARS. But there was no reason for me to, Peco has always been the hero.
>> ARTICLE
That was pretty incredible. Kazama's always been the most challenging character for me to grasp, but he fell into place this week. I always found his workman like attitude and tendency to isolate himself a bit alienating, but knowing that his father taught him ping pong and that he did once love it makes him more relatable. Peco brings out the best in his opponents. Playing him made Kazama fly, it made his cells sing with joy, it's just beautiful.

[Eunyoung Choi](http://myanimelist.net/people/20088/EunYoung_Choi) was this week's animation director. She's a very frequent Yuasa collaborator who I really like. On Ping Pong she serves as assistant director and did the ED. The animation still felt like it had some unfinished bits, but it definitely felt like the match this week had a lot of energy and personality. There was good weight to the movement and I like some of the rougher pencil lines. I'll need to re-watch while paying less attention to the subtitles to pick up on some of the nuances though.
>> ARTICLE
She even did that beautiful surreal Space Dandy episode. Yuasa are Choi are a fantastic team.
>> ARTICLE
You're right, she really is a frequent collab with him. I'm curious now to check out episode 9 of *Space Dandy* now. I wonder what'd it be like if Watanabe invited Yuasa to make an episode, too...
>> ARTICLE
I thought Yuasa was slated to direct a Space Dandy episode in the second half. Need to look that up. 
>> ARTICLE
Episode 9 of Space Dandy was probably the best looking episode of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Some great music as well. The story was a little lacking however.
>> ARTICLE
I took it as a bit of a minimalistic piece, but everyone has different views of course.
>> ARTICLE
I think you can actually see some of Yuasa's work in the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVde2A6zqUg) for the new season of Dandy. That part with the floating head strikes me as his, but I could be wrong. 

Watanabe and Yuasa have worked together before though. Watanabe did music for Mind Game, and Yuasa key animated [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TDu8kiz7Jo) in Samurai Champloo.

Holy crap, as some other people. This is turning into one of my favorite shows.

Kazama left his isolated place. He was able to fly. He discarded the weights put by his lineage and remembered why he started playing ping pong. **Because it was fun**. He was saved. He was saved by the "hero" and finally got some peace.

Season 6 Episode 7!
>> ARTICLE
Thank you :D!!
>> ARTICLE
aots by far over anything this season. what a ride. 

and now we hope smile will compete on the same level with peco, and no "his knee is injured ill let him win" crap
>> ARTICLE
Peco and Smile are two sides of the same coin. Where Peco's arc is about him overcoming his fear of losing in order to enjoy ping pong again, Smile's arc was about learning not to consider the emotions your opponent has. I doubt that Smile will let Peco win because to do so would undermine basically all of his character development.
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, getting over his leg pain with enjoyment was a totally legitimate excuse as well. 

I really really hope in the last episode it doesn't blow out or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much every episode has left me thinking, "Damn, next episode is gonna be **big**". Loved this one in particular. The rallies were really entertaining to watch, along with all the imagery and just the game on a whole.

Expected Kazama to win although I'm glad Peco managed it, which should guarantee a great finale. Once again and for the final time...next episode is gonna be big.
>> ARTICLE
this is contender for the best Anime i've ever seen. It dosn't help that i played the sport for a year in my youth aswell!

Edit: a word

I've said it before but if the last episode is a strong finish this WILL be my favorite show of all time. Lain is now, but damn, this show just evokes such strong feelings from me.

[Ping Pong The Animation Episode 10 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2014/06/ping-pong-animation-episode-10.html)
>> ARTICLE
Peco must win, not for himself, but for Smile, and to Smile Peco must win so he'll be Peco again. Yes, teamwork where Peco must win for himself, for his friend. What of Kazama? He's here to do his job, to fulfill his duty. Not a hero, yet still bound by honour.

Let us observe the clash of the hero and the anti-hero, the dragon. Will the hero slay the dragon, or will the dragon crush the already-wounded hero?

(Not all screenshots made it into the write-up, [here is the full screenshot album](http://imgur.com/a/dbMr1).)

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) Understanding Kazama: Longing for a Hero:**

1. "Overseas? Not me." - Though Ruichi goes overseas all the time, the coach is a simple man. Yurie is leaving, and Kazama did not want to speak with her, so he is left behind.

1. "Ryuichi will be fine, no one waited for a hero longer than he has." - YES. I so like this show for being "Simple", in the best sense of the world. Nothing comes out of left field, and everything is a continuation of information we've been given. Ryuichi gave up because his father, his hero, had been exposed as weak.

 Smile is a monster so Peco will have to become a hero and prove he is one by defeating him. So Kazama as well, he is a monster, so that if he's defeated, and if it's not by another monster such as himself, that he'll be shown that a hero appears!

 Then again, the hero appearing for Smile is his oldest friend, who will be Ruichi's hero? Peco? Or maybe it'd be his second in command.

**2) Living Kazama: To Suffer in the Solitude of Victory:**

1. [Kazama is a professional](http://i.imgur.com/qnwxuIz.jpg). He might not have the honour of a hero, but he has the dignity of a professional, caring for his opponent's knee, and will not put up when he feels his opponent is wasting his time with a toy.

1. [Peco will climb over his vanquished opponent](http://i.imgur.com/8QEGPlv.jpg). That's what a tournament's structure is. Each step you take is over the remains of your prior victories. Also a call-back to Kong. To win is to *fly*.

1. Kazama's position is a difficult one. He wishes for a hero to appear, but since he's certain one *cannot* appear, and how it'll mess up with his view of his father and past, he will crush all those who would claim to exceed expectations. It's only fitting, for them to be heroes, *his* heroes, they have to actually defeat him. The weak cannot speak as if they are strong, for these are but empty words. Ah, if only Kazama hadn't been this strong, crushing all those who wish to inspire him.

 Kazama isn't just playing to win, he's playing to *crush* Peco, the upstart who dared dream of flying, to claim he's a hero. Kazama's trauma is being shown reality, and now he's walking around, sharing that "gift" with everyone else, letting them carry the weight of the world alongside him. Misery loves company.

1. "I've waited for him for so long, and today he's coming back." And then Smile says in his mind "A hero appears" three times. You know what it means? Smile needs the hero *now*. The hero that will save him no matter how deeply he's locked, right? Smile is locked *now*, in a position where others think of him as a robot, where he doesn't get to smile. Smile is locked now in his tower of solitude. Smile is *hurting*. He's hurting *now*.

1. Peco's reminded of a lesson he forgot, you can be cool and climb higher and look down upon others, [but there's always someone stronger](http://i.imgur.com/AgrCvpr.jpg), and hubris and arrogance are bad. As he was reminded, so he seeks to remind Kazama of his mortality again. Kazama keeps saying there are no heroes, no immortals, but he thinks himself one, at least as far as crushing others is concerned.

1. [Ping Pong is a battlefield. This game is war.](http://i.imgur.com/xDe4sZU.jpg)

**3) The Sorrow of Kazama: Sharing Pain**

1. [Remember how I said Kazama is trying to find company in misery](http://i.imgur.com/RgmGNYd.jpg)? For all of that, [he's still alone](http://i.imgur.com/VTHS8O6.jpg). There can be only one who is "Invincible Under the Sun" (Miyamoto Musashi <3), and it's Kazama's role. He is *saving* the others from sharing his burden, even as he shares the burden of crushed memories. What's the alternative? They win and *then* realize their dreams are for naught? Kazama is lonely, even as he surrounds himself with his compatriots, those whose dreams had been taken away. What a sordid affair.

 "Victory feels hollow" he says, but "Defeat is death." He's fighting in order to keep fighting. He's winning because there's no alternative, and the only meaning is to keep toiling. Kazama needs to be saved. Will a hero appear for him?

1. ["I love ya"](http://i.imgur.com/y7dmFMB.jpg) spoken with admiration had never been filled with as much battle-thirst. Same as Obaba, recognizing the other's thirst for blood, and the sanctity of the match? Samurai showdown. Defeat is death. Fight with all you've got.

1. ["It never ends."](http://i.imgur.com/G0Hzov5.jpg) Man, [Kazama is Sisyphus](http://i.imgur.com/Az0jnwx.jpg)! Kazama is the opposite of a bird, which is why Peco's declaration angered him so. His father wished for an easy way out, to just fly over his obstacles, rather than put in the hard work, to conquer them one step at a time, and that had been his downfall. Kazama learned from his father, learned that the only way is through hard, and never-ending work.

1. "Defeat is death. You better cut your arm than capitulate." And then we see his mother capitulating to the naysayers, not standing up for herself or her late husband. Is that why Kazama turned his back on her, to not be met with her weakness?

 ["Win or get bullied, no one will save you."](http://i.imgur.com/ynCXtpa.jpg) The opposite of Smile, who had also been more bullied after winning.

1. "Does your knee hurt?" - "You're so sweet, does that mean you'll let me win?" - "Don't make me laugh." - "Then don't ask." - Peco the loudmouth, speaking against irrelevant chatter. Will wonders never cease? 

**4) Saving the Dragon - Learning to Fly:**

1. Back when Peco was at his lowest, he jumped from a bridge, saying he's *flying*. He was trying to run away from his problems. [Well, he sure is flying now](http://i.imgur.com/BYhIHjj.jpg)! And it's not about him crushing Kazama, but teaching Kazama what Smile told him - [the stronger the opponent, the more fun you're having](http://i.imgur.com/JdtjrpF.jpg), the more you can let yourself *go*. Kazama was alone at the top and had no fun, so he's being reminded what it truly means to strive with his all, and to have *fun*. Even as he's crushed.

 This is also related to the knee-bit; to fly high, they both need to give it their all, so mercy from his opponent will also rob Peco of his fun - as Coach Koizumi had said, no one wins when you go easy on your opponent.

1. "It's like he loves Ping Pong so much he can't hold it in." And we see Kong getting emotional. From Peco's story, we know it's the same for Smile, even if he can't show it right now. Perhaps Smile needs the hero to appear and play against him in order to feel alive again. Kazama believes he has no chance of attaining this feeling, but Smile knows it could happen again. He's crushing all his opponents not to crush them, but in hopes they'd fight back.

1. Kazama, freed! You know, two episodes ago I wanted neither Peco nor Kong to lose. Here? They'll both win, no matter how the game ends.

 [Kazama, actually excited, not a robot](http://i.imgur.com/CDvb3vI.jpg)! His burst of intensity gets his club to push as well!

1. Kazama repeats his lines, and it's fine. He's letting go, he'd been set free. Kazama is accepting his new position, with *relief*. "There;s no need to be afraid. I like this place." - This place in the light, away from his bathroom stall, where he hides. What does Kazama hide from? Kazama hid from victory. Defeat is Death, but to win is just to be forced to keep winning, to keep crushing others' dreams, and being lonely.

 Sometimes, defeat is death, and that's fine. [There is life after death.](http://i.imgur.com/EHPvWE9.jpg)

**Post Episode Thoughts:**

This was a great episode. *Another* great episode. And next episode just might be better? With Smile against Peco? I'm not sure my body is ready (don't listen, my body is *soooo* ready).

This episode was pretty clear. Last episode was about us being told the hero will awaken, and the hero regaining his memories. This episode was the hero proving he's back, by way of slaying the dragon.

Slaying the dragon? He set the little child inside Ruichi free, the one who wanted to return to the heady days of playing ping pong for fun, who didn't serve a life-sentence, hidden away, locked out of sight. Peco had done for Ruichi what he had done for Smile all those years ago, and what Smile is in need of once more.

You see, unlike Kazama, Smile knows his position, that he's locked into winning, into being alone. But he also knows fun is possible, and he just needs his *friend* to be there, for them to have fun *together*.

"You can't always climb high enough to look down upon others" has a new meaning after it all ends. Climbing is insufficient, at some point you need to *fly*. But once you fly, you don't try to keep others down. This isn't a rock where you fight for grip. Once you fly, you try to help others fly alongside you. To fly is to invite company. To climb is to fight for your sole spot.

I hope you do a huge review/write up for the whole show once it's over. I'm gonna try to do that myself, but it might be unpolished.

MAN. SO MANY FEELS. when that goofy ass music started to play and peco became speed and goofiness incarnate was the MOST hilarious and inspiringly amazing moment. ALSO when kazama hits that ball and EXXPLODES with that yell and smile. one of the most HILARIOUS scenes an I watched it repeatedly. the way he smashes out of his shell like that.. these two have a great dynamic; honestly I don't know if the final can beat this episode because this honestly gave me a roller coaster ride.

That soundtrack during the later part of the match. So fun sounding. Very fitting. Anyone know when the soundtrack is coming out?

Many thanks.

Best show of the season, hands down.

I can't remember the last time I've liked every main character in a show. Maybe never. And maybe 'like' is not the right word, but this show makes it so easy for me to understand the characters so well that I can't help but feel connected to them. It's nothing short of amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Only Peco is good enough and offbeat enough to have insanely crazy fun rally with Dragon. Ryu is fortunate that he's facing him not Smile.

This episode is just so liberating
>> ARTICLE
Just had to chime in and say that I adore this series. Matsumoto Taiyou's story and Yuasa's direction are truly made for each other.

And in all honestly, people who can't appreciate Ping Pong's art style are just too damn basic. Even if it's not your cup of tea, you cannot deny its bold, unique aesthetic. Anyone who stopped watching because of the animation missed out on a rare series with tremendous emotional depth... But I'm guessing whatever KyoAni's cranking out this season is probably enough to satisfy them.
>> ARTICLE
the animation is top notch. They are most likely complaining about the aesthetics
>> ARTICLE
Only 1 episode left :( 
>> ARTICLE
Wait...what! 

Well fuck I did not know this was only a 11 episode series I thought we weren't even halfway through it! Does anyone how much the animation is covering of the manga?
>> ARTICLE
This episode covered chapters 46 to 52. There are 55 chapters in total. So yea, next episode will finish everything.
>> ARTICLE
Fingers crossed for one massive epilogue so it goes out on an incredible high. 

I want to see Kong again. I want to see Sakuma again. I want to see Ryuichi again. I want to see Sanada again. I want to see the wanderer again. I want to see how Peco and Smile become the best buddies again after the final.

What a display of themes. It's not every day you see deeper themes delivered like this.

It's so fitting that the episode devoted to the fun of the sport is such a fun episode. I was smiling the entire time. That was a complete joy to watch.

Seeing Kazama's transformation was amazing and so uplifting, these last few episodes have been an experience unlike any I've had watching anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I was really expecting Peco's knee to give out at the end of the episode, let's see if it does next episode though, seeing as how the match isn't over as yet.

I've also been wondering this for a while, but can balls actually spin in on the rackets like it does in this anime?
>> ARTICLE
I'm just waiting to see if this moment happens. I couldn't help but feel bittersweet when Kazama asks Peco if he could ever take him this high again and Peco just replies with a smile and silence.
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know, it's more of an extremely slowed down image of a ball that has a huge spin on it hit back with long pips. I'm not sure though, seeing as I'm not that much into ping pong and what you see at the olympics is mostly fast balls :p
>> ARTICLE
but there's been times where I've seen the players just spinning the ball on their hand/racket before they serve for fun, not when returning a ball that has spin on it
>> ARTICLE
When they're using their hands, it seems like they're cradling the ball on thing fingernails so I assume it'd work like that. As for the racket, I have no idea - I have little experience with ping pong rackets, especially of the type, caliber, and quality I'm assuming they use.
>> ARTICLE
I love how I can never predict anything with this show. The obvious thing to do would be to have Peco's knee give out just as he was building a lead which would reinvigorate Smile's passion for the game and inspire him to beat Kazama in the final. 
>> ARTICLE
Magnificent is exactly the right word for this episode.

By the way, does anyone happen to have a gif of Kazama working the ping pong ball on his racket? That was some sweet looking animation.

And holy crap the music and sound this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I was a little disappointed that that sequence was all CG... I mean, even rotoscoping would be better.
>> ARTICLE
Firstly, what?

>... I mean, even rotoscoping would be better.

No it won't. The camera will be awkward, and the spin will be horrible, not to mention looking downright atrocious since you would have to disturb the style consistency.
>> ARTICLE
Are you sure?

Most of the rallies between Hoshino and Kazama, which I consider one of the highlights, look highly referenced from real life ping pong rallies, if not rotoscoped. They were definitely not CG.

I remember two instances of CG in this episode (other than the standard close up of the pips). At 12:37, where Hoshino's body is mapped to a frame (gives it a flash animation feel), and this scene. In terms of technical animation I would say these were, relatively, the lower points of the episode. To the staff's credit, the Kazama shot was done pretty well for CG, thus my disappointment that it didn't look more natural.
>> ARTICLE
none of the segments were rotoscoped btw. You can always reference to real life videos, but that's not rotoscope. The only part of the show that uses rotoscope is the ED, and you can easily tell the difference in style between that and the actual show.
>> ARTICLE
Rotoscoping is a versatile technique, and not simply limited to the Flowers of Evil look. Even roughly outlining a video would be considered rotoscoping, and we can't be sure what the animators did in the rallying segment without asking them. 

Anyway, I didn't claim it was necessarily rotoscoped. My argument was simply that the CG scenes consistently deviate the most from the show's rough style, and rotoscoping is just one of many techniques that would be physically accurate while still preserving a warm hand-drawn feel.

Every god damn second I loved this episode a little bit more until I couldn't contain it with this shaky heart of mine and a few tears escaped their cells.

I don't give care what you haters say, this anime is probably one of the best I've ever watched. Argue, point fingers, denounce all you like, you cannot clip the wings of my hero.

Right from the beginning I turned up my speakers for this one. Music in an anime is a key element in my enjoyment and I had a feeling that Ping Pong would deliver big today. When the early notes of 'the hero's song' started playing I got goosebumps. Much of the score this week was well timed and what had been somewhat forgettable background music finally took to the level of the show itself. 

I can't wait to see how this ends next week.

Haaaaa that was beautiful. I love this show so much.

Because the washroom is the only place where no one bothers you.

It's his pre match ritual. A place where he can find peace before carrying out the obligation and shoulder the responsibility to destroy all that comes before him. 

Ryuichi basically have a match day persona that he must assume, transforming from a soft-spoken gentleman to a fearsome Dragon.

This is based on the same series as the live-action movie by Fumihiko Sori?

The live-action movie is absolutely brilliant. I'll have to look out for the DVDs of the animation.

I just realized today that I'd seen the Peco v Dragon scene from the movie on YouTube before. 
>> ARTICLE
I will say it again and again about this series but oh my god, the art, the sounds, the strong voices you hear of their thoughts during a match, everything about this show is so great. I love it, this episode has to be one of my favourite anime episodes ever. The tempo that the match started at and then the coming of the hero, he truly is a hero at first in this series I disliked Peco but I have to say he has an amazing love of table tennis and it lifts his matches up so much, although this is based on a manga the way that the artists and voice actors convey the message is incredible. Although the last couple episodes have not aired I feel confident enough to say this is my favourite anime, would recommend to anyone.

God that was such a good episode. I was so excited the whole time because I really wasn't sure what direction it would take and who would win. The title of the episode also could have foreshadowed different things. "I Thought You Were the Hero!!" sounded like a disappointed Smile and I thought maybe he would have to become the hero to save Kazama or something. But now I gotta say I couldn't have asked for a better episode. The combination of the art and the music and the flashbacks and  the clashing of emotions and ideals and psychological outlooks and everything was just so amazing.

The game of Ping Pong was like a conversation between Peco and Kazama where they learned about each other and helped each other grow and became friends. So good.

This one destroyed me in the best way. If I could show someone a single episode of Ping Pong that might convince them how great this series is, it would be this one without a doubt.

Best show of the season, by far. Nothing comes close. That episode was beyond incredible... and to think I wasn't even originally planning to watch this show. Everyone who loves anime owes it to themselves to see this.

I started rewatching the series because I was showing it to a friend, you notice lots of small character moments when you know them better, especially when you initially thought they were absolute oneshot side characters. (Like Eyebrows glancing at Yurie)

Buttlerfly Joe turning Smile into the Robot because the Hero wouldn't come to save him had a lot more impact on me than on my first watch.

Has the new episode been uploaded anywhere yet? It's not on Funimation and Crunchyroll has it locked from my area.

HorribleSubs is usually on time.

It is on [Funimation](http://www.funimation.com/shows/ping-pong-the-animation/videos/official/i-thought-you-were-the-hero) now. It takes some time to display on their site even though it is up on their CDN (which is where HorribleSubs gets it).

damn that was a great episode.
>> ARTICLE
There really are a good number of interpretations you could make of the symbols; I really like both you've mentioned. I can't wait to see how Smile plays into things. Not that it'll decide the "right" interpretation (as if such a thing could exist), but I'm excited to see how his character evolution will culminate in this final episode. I have the feeling it'll be dramatic, since he's been just about bubbling in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I think Smile can't hit a ball like depriving Peko's career as ping pong player in the finals. Even if the point is chanpionship point.

No, CR in US doesn't have it either, its just on the list CR has for this seasons shows.
>> ARTICLE
So now we have Butterfly Jo all over again. Smile should be able to win the next match, but Peco won't be able to bring himself to forfeit. Smile won't either. Smile used to pull his punches when his opponent had something important riding on the match, but has his coach drilled this tendency out of him? When told the story of Butterly Jo, Smile said that he could win the match by destroying a friend's career. Will he be able to follow through?

Tune in next time, on another thrilling episode of Ping Pong The Animation!
>> ARTICLE
>You didn't watch me

>>No. I knew you'd win

>I lost

>...

>Just kidding

And people said that Smile didn't have sense of humour.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic personal experience just now: I mindlessly opened this thread while the episode downlo- I mean buffered and I read those first three lines. I closed the window thinking that I'd just has Tsukimoto's loss spoiled, and when he said "Just kidding" I lost it.

On top of that, 10/10 episode.
>> ARTICLE
I saw it too but I thought it meant kazuma lost and girl didnt watch.
>> ARTICLE
Haha his deadpan delivery absolutely had me for a split second, I pulled the exact face the coach did.
>> ARTICLE
Even when telling jokes he does it in the most robotic way possible.
>> ARTICLE
"Welcome back, hero."

I really feel for Kong. I was so excited to see him back with his coach, and doing so well with his teammates. I guess he's in a better place to accept loss now, but it's still sad. Somehow he became my favorite character even though he doesn't get the same amount of screen time as others.

On the other hand, it is fulfilling to see Peco on the rise. I'd love to see Smile and Peco renew their friendship. It would be nice to see them on more even ground, instead of the toxic co-dependency that they used to have.
>> ARTICLE
HERO-O KENZAN!

Anyway, I don't think we've seen the last of Kong. His teammates will back him up immensely. 
>> ARTICLE
This show is so good at making you attached to these characters, that when I saw Kong lose, it felt like the show killed the character off for me. I know he will still make future appearances, but I just felt so bad that Kong's career is over.
>> ARTICLE
This scene is actually confusing me a bit.  Initially I actually felt that Kong lost his motivation to win while playing for the last point against Peco.  "I wish I at least got to spend my eternal exile in Europe"; "Say hi to Kazama for me".  Kong has already given up when he serves.  At first I interpreted Kong's flashbacks/thoughts of home as a sign of him wanting to return home and stop struggling to succeed at ping pong.  I almost felt that he lost intentionally so he could go home and relax a bit.

But after rewatching the scene and reading comments here it seems more that Kong has finally matured enough to accept defeat respectably.  The intensity in his last hit also makes me doubt that he really gave up.  I'm not entirely sure if that last hit was his powerfully emotional farewell to ping pong, or if he'll return.  Anyone else have similar conflicting feelings about Kong's loss?
>> ARTICLE
> I'm not entirely sure if that last hit was his powerfully emotional farewell to ping pong, or if he'll return.

It was certainly a huge loss. His return to China is, I think, conditional upon his winning, not his loss. I believe it was said that he would be given a second chance of sorts on the Chinese national team, if he first "conquered" Japan.

His remarks during the match are just bittersweet asides, that he was fated to lose. But that simultaneously comes with an understanding that he might be better fit with something else. A truly satisfying end for him would be to see him become a world-renowned coach, rather than a champion player... I think that's the direction it's currently headed. He's experienced camaraderie, now, and it's given his character a near 180. 
>> ARTICLE
Kong had spent the year teaching the rest of his school how to play and was enjoying their success. He's found another way to enjoy the game.
No he hadn't given up in the end, but I think he might have resigned himself to falling short again this year. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the plane is a symbol of China, which has taken off without him, but not his home. His home is Japan now, which will soon include his mother and coach, as shown in the pictures.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's really just along the lines that he accepts that he's going to lose but he's not going to just give up, he still has pride. He'll play his best till the end, even if the outcome is obvious.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that Kong gave up.  He just knew that he was playing someone better than him.  The ball turning into the plane in the last shot showed that he was still trying his absolute best.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was quite telling that the ball had no spin on his last hit. Telling of what? I'm not quite sure.
>> ARTICLE
> I guess he's in a better place to accept loss now, but it's still sad.

It's tragic. The development that his character's gone through is remarkable. But I feel like now he'll be capable of moving on, and even being happy. His story just makes Peco's climb back to the top even grander.

Well put. Kong is #1 in our hearts.
>> ARTICLE
This show is legitimately sending chills up and down my spine every time I watch it. 

I started off thinking it was going to be a joke that was good for a few laughs for an episode or two and look where it is now. I have never been attached to so many characters at once. I don't even know who I want to win. Everyone has good reasons for what they're doing and I empathize with all of them.

That last point in the Kong/Peco match was amazing. Everything flashing before Kong, him talking to himself in his head, the shots of all the different characters. People realizing that Peco is a force to be reckoned with. 

Even before that, with Kong's first match, the side character up and realizing that he was no match for Kong because he wasn't nearly on the same level was intense. This show is just... I never thought I'd see something so good about ping pong.

When the series is done I'll do a huge write up on what I thought because I really think this show deserves it. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's what sets it apart from most other sports anime. Rather than just focusing on one person or group's success, it covers different contestants and their clashes with each other. Far more interesting and realistic approach.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I absolutely love that about this show. The people that usually wouldn't matter (aka the the Kaio student) are somehow built up into people who feel real, even just in the space of the match. The mountain/sea guy was an example of that too. 

They manage to make us root for all the characters at once, which is probably what makes the show as good as it is.
>> ARTICLE
>The mountain/sea guy

Haha holy shit what happened to that guy I miss him. :<

Isn't it kind of a major dick move that he's taking money to promote the shoes, but won't even wear them in a match? I mean, Tiger Woods used Nike clubs even when everyone was saying they were fucking-up his game.
>> ARTICLE
Well they probably made him use the clubs, I doubt it was just out of the goodness of his heart
>> ARTICLE
> Isn't it kind of a major dick move

Yes.

He knows it, too. He's too busy not giving a fuck because he wants to prove himself to his asshole of a grandfather.

It's exactly what Yurie is talking about when she interrupts his bath time. The grandfather is pulling all this ridiculous crap to make a quick buck off the sport, and Yurie thinks that's a terrible reason to play. Kazama wants to prove himself, but all he's doing is giving his grandfather a golden opportunity to profit, his grandfather could probably care less about him... He should be playing for his own sake, but he's blinded by his family woes.

Change "weird" for great. I'm loving the art style, the motion it conveys is breathtaking at times.

It's seriously beautiful. It conveys motion simultaneously loosely and with great confidence. It feels emotional, like not how you see the world but how you would remember it. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, It's really a breath of fresh air. It's trippy and creative at times. Sometimes I feel like the anime art styles nowadays are constricted. I can't think of one that has those figurative moments that Ping Pong has. The one that's on my mind now is the Kong vs. Kazama game. That was so awesome! It wasn't because it was literal, it was because it portrayed the desperation of Kong and the domination of Kazama perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
Oooh they added lyrics translations to the OP and ED. Good, OP and ED lyrics are often important to the content of the show. Hope this becomes a thing (since fansubbers do it anyways).
>> ARTICLE
On Funimation? Good for you guys. Crunchyroll still doesn't show lyrics.
>> ARTICLE
On the upside, Crunchyroll's typesetting is better than Funimation's. It's still *bad*, but it's watchable-bad, not "just write it all on one line at the top of the screen"-bad. TS for this show is a lot more important than OP/ED TL.

The translation on CR is way better in general... although this episode I think I heard the Kaio guy say world class, while the subs said national level.

Does CR put the English subs on top of the Japanese ones when characters are speaking Chinese like Funimation does?

If you mean 'on top of' as in overlaying, no. If you mean 'on top of' as in above, yes.

As somebody who is new to anime, I am in love with this show. I know it's been said a hundred times before, but the characterization is amazing I really feel for every character. The feels when Kong had finally given in to Peco winning...

Masaaki Yuasa (the director) is one-of-a-kind, so this caliber of great storytelling isn't too common. They're definitely out there though, and when they do come around it's a fantastic ride.

It's cool how the show is revealing that the visual motifs you thought were associated to certain characters are actually someone else's motifs. Last episode was that the butterfly motif was Koizumi's motif, not Smile's. This episode showed that the hero motif is Peco's.

Really interesting and complex characterization in this show.

"Welcome back, hero" made me happy.

Loved this episode.

I found the scene showcasing kazama's and kong's teammates about mat shoes very interesting. 

Kaio walk in a dark corridor behind Kazama's shadow, while Kong faces his teammates in a light room. Kong, in response to his teammate's buyer's remorse says...

>But wearing good shoes is good. Everyone should wear good shoes.

I don't know how to articulate it but this statement made an impact on me. Not a gram of resentment for kaio/Kazama. Kong is very wise. 
>> ARTICLE
Progress, effort, heroes, monsters, and the death of heroes. Playing to win, playing to win, playing to earn money, and playing to make friends. Worlds are going to collide, let us observe.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) The Aspirants Gather:**

1. "The school is using mats, for promotion, and playing branded shoes, for promotion. You should play ping pong for *yourself*." - Yurie is in love with Ryuichi, to her him acting for himself would give her more time with him, and cancel their grandfather's influence. She wishes it not just for Ryuichi's sake, but for hers as well. To do something because one wishes to. But his "Death of the Hero" and thus of the individual is what keeps him locked within this cage - he sees nothing outside, no dreams, no life. If anything, he's the robot.

1. [I sure hope Kazama is dreaming](http://i.imgur.com/mEl3aFe.jpg), cause him playing against *three* robotic hands while his floor keeps moving out from underneath him is scary. The world is shaking from underneath him, while he's fighting his faceless demons. You see, to him it doesn't mean who he's playing against, [because his goal, if not his "dream", is to best his past, to best his predecessors](http://i.imgur.com/d6L15NO.jpg). To show he is better than the father who followed his dreams and lost it all, and better than his grandfather who crushed his father's wishes and made him feel unwelcome.

1. What a devious plan! Get mats, tell people they feel differently, and then sell shoes that are "specially designed for mats" - of course, it's also there to help his team - these people have to play in a new environment, and with new shoes to boot? Greedy.

 [Here, the national team's coach says the same](http://i.imgur.com/qCCYSzQ.jpg). You *do not* change your shoes just before a big match, without having walked in them beforehand.

**2) Stepping Up to Pitch:**

1. [The return of airplane Kong!](http://i.imgur.com/7IlGV2P.jpg) The airplane taking you home, the airplane taking you away from home! The airplane of dreams. At least his old coach came for him <3

1. ["Aim for the top, and you'll run into monsters."](http://i.imgur.com/VN4KvKc.jpg) - So the only option is to become a monster oneself, or to be a *hero*. And as I said previously, I think Smile turned himself into a monster so Peco will be forced to remember his old Heart-Vow, and become the Hero. Smile is sacrificing himself, or so it feels. At worst, maybe he'll have to be the hero - for most of the monsters one runs into on the way to the top fancy themselves the heroes of their own tale.

1. [Peco is still Peco!](http://i.imgur.com/nPW46mF.jpg) All for the cool airs, all for wishing to have an easy road ahead of him.

1. ["I just want to beat Kazama and earn my ticket home."](http://i.imgur.com/It41Biw.jpg) - The airplane isn't the dream, but the way to the dream, which stands for home. Damn, is Kong going to lose in the 2nd round to Peco? I don't want anyone to lose :<

1. ["It's time to dance"](http://i.imgur.com/z9Ow2vX.jpg) after playing with his ball for so long. It's like I'm watching a showdown in the Wild West. And then his Kaio opponent speaks of how he himself is not that good anyway, of giving up the dream, that even playing is all he can aspire to. A difference in goals.

**3) The Hero Appears:**

1. Yessss! "Call me if you're in a pinch, chant these words three times: ["The Hero Appears!"](http://i.imgur.com/d3LIEbx.jpg)" - We're getting there, a *hero*. I'm getting slightly misty-eyed just thinking of it.

1. ["Bluff the strong, and not the weak."](http://i.imgur.com/oFOqsEC.jpg) - Not only do you not need to bluff the weaker players, but the strong ones try to foresee how things will go, which is required for bluffing. If you think everything's random, there's no bluffing to begin with. In fighting games, you can't mix-up someone who guards randomly.

1. Even Smile watched Peco, and waited for him to appear before entering the arena. Smile is here for Peco, and not himself, and in this sense he's somewhat similar to Kazama.

1. ["Welcome back, Hero."](http://i.imgur.com/qrQJx8i.jpg) - I've *told* you. Smile's hero, the one who saved him from the locker, the one who saved him from his loneliness, had *always* been Peco. But the Hero had gone dormant, and Smile took up the Killer Robot mantle to help wake him up, to *force* his long-lost *friend* to come back.

**4) To Every Dream, A Waking Moment:**

1. "You didn't watch me? No, I knew you'd win." - Kong's coach keeps saying he trusts him, but Koizumi displays true trust in Smile.

 And then Smile turns his back on Peco's game, saying he knows he'll win. Smile has the talent and skill, he can tell how a match will go. But more than that, you've got to *believe* in the Hero, and Smile wishes nothing more than to believe, and to be proven right. You can't doubt the hero, or it isn't one.

1. Kong's coach is departing before the match is over, for he too had known how it'd turn out. ["China" is leaving, and the airplane is as well](http://i.imgur.com/ktFgckr.jpg). Goodbye to your dreams, Kong. At least you've made friends here.

1. [If it'd been Smile, in the dorky mask](http://i.imgur.com/IeYFvUj.jpg), then it means it was his vision, and he acted it out, his dream of becoming a hero. But no, it all points out to it being Peco. Peco who had always been the hero, until he forgot. Peco who had been the hero, until he got enamored with the easy life, and with being adored, so rested on his laurels. A hero is only a hero when there are monsters out there.

 A hero *must* fight monsters to protect his allies, to protect Smile.

**Shorter Notes / Aside:**

1. I can't help it, [but Peco looks to me like some sort of Chinese Communist Party member here](http://i.imgur.com/iV4nMqD.jpg).

1. [A small world](http://i.imgur.com/WBMYnvC.jpg), the old generation is still competing with one another, through their trainees. A generational samurai drama.

1. ["No waaay"](http://i.imgur.com/EsXVqSv.jpg) - Coach Koizumi, I love you. Yes. Yes, my coach. Hm, so Peco has a lot of talent, we've always known it. Peco isn't like other players? And is Smile?

1. Oh shit, The OP and ED got subtitled.

1. Ah, yes, Peco's coach used to spend time in Obaba's dojo, so he knows Smile as well.

1. [Pretty-Boy Kong!](http://i.imgur.com/XTzR8uX.jpg) Reservoir Dogs (Tarantino in general) style introductions again.

1. [Peco is so cool!](http://i.imgur.com/u9aNHU2.jpg) All he needed was a new spine transplant! Obaba, your time and effort bore fruit!

1. Sport-show tropes! [Peco just learned a new style, in the middle of a match!](http://i.imgur.com/rgb0p1c.jpg) Opposition by strong opponents makes us strong!

**Post Episode Thoughts:**

The hero is climbing the tournament ladder, ascending the castle to protect the princess, but the princess is the toughest boss of them all. Who is Peco going to save? Is he going to save Smile from having to be a monster, or is Smile forcing Peco to save *himself* from a world in which he rests on his laurels and doesn't live out his dreams.

This is the tournament of destiny, where the hero breaks out of his shell, where he not only appears, but is *reborn*. Poor Kong, for he was a good guy, but that's life, and that's another message - dreams exist, but for one person to achieve theirs sometimes means the death of another's. Kazama though lives in this post-Dream world, to win he kills not only the other side's dreams, but his own. He lives in this sordid existence as to protect himself from heartache, but that means also protecting himself from his heart.

Smile is turning into a monster to save Peco's heart, but who will be the hero for Kazama, who will make him see that there are heroes, and dreams, when his position denies them to begin with?

im really glad the ending song is back to the way it was in the first few episodes. I didn't like the change they did to it and to see them change it back really brings joy to me ^.^
>> ARTICLE
Kong =(
>> ARTICLE
I'm sad for Kong, but at the same time... It's like he's reached some inner peace? I don't know. I hope we get to see him play again.

And whoa, welcome back, Hero.
>> ARTICLE
Really solid episode, the animation is amazing as always.

Could someone define RPB and some terms used in this episode too?
>> ARTICLE
The Penhold grip usually uses the same side of the paddle for both forehand and backhand. The Reverse Penhold Backhand uses the opposite side for a backhand. It's an awkward shot, so it is not normally used, but it can be extremely powerful, especially compared to the normal penhold backhand.

What other terms would you liked defined?
>> ARTICLE
What was special about the MC's racquet?
>> ARTICLE
Smile's? Nothing, except that he used pips out rubber instead of the normal inverted rubber that most other people use. This is useful with his defensive/chopper style because he doesn't need to worry about fast-spinning shots from his opponent.
>> ARTICLE
i actually meant Peco's, sorry
>> ARTICLE
Wait, which ep. are you on?
>> ARTICLE
Reverse Penhold Backhand. Referring to the grip, and which way he is hitting the ball (forehand or backhand). 
>> ARTICLE
Kong's return hitting the net I felt like represented his plans of getting back into China being denied.
>> ARTICLE
A couple days late, but [I've actually been doing little essays for each episode of Ping Pong](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/06/01/ping-pong-episode-8/) and was pretty happy with this one. Like the episode itself, it is mostly about shoes!
>> ARTICLE
This show takes every sports shonen anime and throws them out the window. There's no friendship, hard work or magic tricks that will ever save anyone's ass on a match.
>> ARTICLE
Seinen Sports and Shonen Sports are incomparable and each have their own charms. Taking this season for example, I love Haikyuu!! just as much as Ping Pong.
>> ARTICLE
"talent" tho.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but it isn't like the ''talented'' people just slack off like in other sports animes haha.

peco 4 president

This is one of the few shows I can think of where I equally root for the protagonists and antagonists. I was happy for Peco, but actually teared up a little for Kong. That last shot...
>> ARTICLE
Dam it Kong is one of my best characters in this show, I really felt sorry for him and the scene where his mother waiting him just touching.   
>> ARTICLE
I get completely overwhelmed by the haiku-esque scenes during the matches. I caught myself yelling out at the TV a little more than usual during this episode. Can't get enough of this shooow.
>> ARTICLE
THE ART IS JUST FKING BEAUTIFUL IM NOT EVEN LYING AND I LOVE PECOOO AND KOONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
not sure if I like this new Peco :o makes me uneasy for if tsukimoto and him have to play eachother

Also it seems as if Kong hasn't improved, while peco, smile and kazama just leave him behind
>> ARTICLE
>Also it seems as if Kong hasn't improved, while peco, smile and kazama just leave him behind

Perhaps not as a ping pong player, but of the four, he's definitely had the most growth as a person, and I think that's really more what his whole arc is about.
>> ARTICLE
I'm enjoying watching Kong growth as a person more than Peco's growth as a Ping Pong player
>> ARTICLE
Why is this series so fucking awesome? I think this is my new favorite sport anime, i absolutely love everything about it
>> ARTICLE
"The hero appears!" I wonder how many times Smile said these words.
>> ARTICLE
I come from planet ping pong. - Peco
>> ARTICLE
Peco vs Smile in finals would be amazing. But given how much Kazama is focused on training, I don't think Peco stands a chance. 
>> ARTICLE
Kong came to terms with himself and it was cathartic and bittersweet. All the coaches are still the most lovable characters, Kong included. Peco won with his talent and being as endearing as possible, and Smile and Koizumi's bond is strong and heartwarming as ever. Kazama is beginning to question himself, that's a good sign.

The hero will slay the dragon. ~~Sorry for saying that.~~
>> ARTICLE
That kong and peco match was hard to watch. I was rooting for both of them but one must of course have to lose. Either way there's a lot you can learn from losing
>> ARTICLE
So, in this episode, we discover (or can infer) that the hero is Peco, which has been implied in the earlier episodes.

Does this mean that Smile has just been waiting for his hero, or Peco, to get to his level this whole time?

This show gets better with every episode.
>> ARTICLE
When this show was first announced I didn't pay any attention at all - it looked like another generic sports show. When this show got a lot of hype I looked at it, but figured it would be a nice addition to my lineup rather than anything else.

Ping Pong has completely exceeded every single expectation I had. Everything about this show is amazing and executed incredibly. The characters are so well developed and magnetic and human. I'm blown away by this show every week. 

I also want to point out how perfect the music is. I've started really paying attention to the OST and it's stunning how perfectly on point everything is. Whenever an emotional moment is coming the music syncs perfectly to enhance the effect. The music naturally flows right with the story emphasizing every movement the show makes without being distracting. On top of that the ending song is one of the best I've ever seen. It reminds me of [Kyoukai no Kanata's ED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqc_YNOGDE8) with how perfectly it caps off each episode.
>> ARTICLE
Man, this show. This fucking show. Every week it gets better. How is it still getting better? Anime of the season by a country mile.

Is the soundtrack for this available anywhere yet?

"Welcome back hero." fuck yeah. Feels so good to see Peco back and better than ever. When they said there would be 4 finalists I had thought it would be Peco, Smile, Kazama, and Kong, but apparently not. I feel bad for Kong, but it also feels good to see how far Peco has come and has taught Kong he shouldn't have underestimated him as a talentless person he thought he was.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, that was amazing.

God damn being Kong is suffering.

Best sports anime i have ever watched.
>> ARTICLE
I wish they'd follow the chinese text more for subs, but i understand that there might not be any chinese subbing this. The final scene with Kong's mom opening the door made such a big impact on me. The text "" actually means "you're **finally** home". Kong isn't just being welcomed home, his mom/and family? have been waiting for his return. He himself has been waiting to go back. Finally. 

>> ARTICLE
Now, I haven't read all the comments of all these threads, but something that stood out to me this episode was the music. I hadn't noticed how good it was until this episode. Wow!

Kong bonding with his new team and singing karaoke is so heartwarming I could die
>> ARTICLE
The karaoke scene was so perfectly amazing, epically the way it linked in all the characters and showed where they were emotionally, Kong surround by his team mates, Peco getting drunk by himself and Smile all alone by himself.

It reminded me of "[Saa christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qyzQueWuU4)" from Toradora.
>> ARTICLE
>It reminded me of "Saa christmas " from Toradora.

YES! That's exactly what I was thinking, too. Except Minori turned into the like 5 people spending it alone.
>> ARTICLE
Saa Christmas, not with 500% less happyness.
>> ARTICLE
I think it showed what people sacrifice to try to be the best.  

* Once Kong took it easier and didn't focus all his attention on getting out of Japan, he learned Japanese, he bonded with his team, he spent time with his mother, and he was happy.  

* Kazama spends all his time training and practicing to be the best and live up to the standards and obligations that are attached to him; as a result, he spends little time actually as the team captain, and he doesn't see his cousin's interest in him.  

* Smile had Peco when he wasn't focusing on winning, and now that he threw away his sympathy to win, he is too cold to bond with the team.
>> ARTICLE
Especially when you compare it with the dynamics between Smile and the rest of his team. Too much competitiveness is toxic
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's competitiveness in Smile's case. At least, not with his teammates. He just knows he's better than them and doesn't sugar coat it, which in turn leaves him all alone. 

Show can portray some amazing relationships.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm in love with Kong
>> ARTICLE
This anime isn't really about ping pong, but why people play ping pong.

Kazama: It's his duty to be the best, the crown weighs heavy on him, and this episode really shows that he doesn't allow himself to have any fun, ever.

Kong: It's his livelyhood. It's the only thing he's ever known. This episode highlights Kong discovering life outside of Ping pong, the only thing he's ever known.

Sakuma: It's his passion. In any other shounen sports anime, he'd be the protagonist, who slowly works his way to the top. This episode showed how even though he knows it's hopeless, he can't give up ping pong

Smile: It's his way of changing himself. His admiration of Peco is what started everything, and his quest to change himself through ping pong is what drove him to this point. But as seen here, nothing has really changed. Smile can't be Peco.

Peco: I couldn't really figure out what Ping pong meant to peco until now. It's his identity. Ping pong is who Peco is. He draws his confidence from ping pong, his dream is to be the greatest ping pong player in the world, his whole life was ping pong. And when he lost that identity, he became lost himself, swimming in a sea of uncertainty, unsure of who or what he was anymore.
>> ARTICLE
 I would like to add that I think that whats driving Smile right now is the desire to bring Peco back in the game. Ping Pong was never Smile's life goal as he always said it. It was his saving grace when he was a child, it was through it that he met Peco his only friend and started living. He loves the game for it, but not to the point where he wants to be better than everybody else, all he probably wanted to do was to keep having fun with Peco and other with the game.

 But Peco slowly drifted away from all that when he lost his confidence in his skills, something which he always took for granted. The only way for Smile (who has very poor social skills) to help his friend see what he needs to do is to do it himself. In a way his trying to become someone Peco needs to aspire for and defeat. His becoming the Monster Robot that only the Hero can stop.

Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Oh my god. That karaoke song sequence... for as over the top and wacky as it can be at times, this is one emotional anime. Seriously one of the best series I think I've ever watched... Every episode is beautiful, inspiring, depressing in a strange indescribable way, and just... real. It feels so real. Which is crazy to say, seeing as how abstract the art style is.

Long live Ping Pong. This'll be one anime lovers recommend for years to come.

Oh man all the feels! From the love sequence, to Kong spending Christmas with his mother, to Peco almost drowning.

This is why I love the anime, its content is packed. AND WE GOT TO SEE SEA MAN AGAIN!!!

 I love that the main characters have now found their cause: Kong being a man who wants to help coach players, Peco as a guy who wants to relive his dream, and Smile....well, DAMN. That intro sequence describing a robot who is out of control was just perfect and a great way to describe Smile right now. The question is, who is that one man to help the robot control itself again? Peco?
>> ARTICLE
who is the "hero" from the movie

>> ARTICLE
Peco is definitely the hero. He's the one who saved smile in the first place, the "hero" we see in Smile's earlier flashbacks. 

Peco was definitely the kid who helped him escape the broom locker, and was the one who made smile accept himself. 

"All humans are robots" because "we have iron in our veins" 
>> ARTICLE
I am Peco, who lost his way.

I am Sakuma, who has no natural talent.

I am Kong, who looks for new meaning in life.

These guys are all so different, and yet I relate to all of them. 

Thanks, Ping Pong. 
>> ARTICLE
It's crazy how I initially thought Kazama was one of the people I'd like from the PV's...but as time has gone on, he's morphed from being that "goal" to being the reviled man you can't help but admire. It's a complicated feeling...

...which makes sense. This whole series is nothing but complicated feelings.
>> ARTICLE
Revile? I just straight up admire Kazama. I don't relate to him, but I definitely admire his work ethic. 
>> ARTICLE
He only does it that way because it's all he knows. In a way, that's sad. That systematic machine of a school has turned him, in turn, into a systematic machine. It's like he's a product on their assembly line. It hurts to watch him.
>> ARTICLE
I mostly just feel bad for him. He's so consumed with his goals that he has no time for anything else, and he might win, but if he doesn't keep winning, everything he has lived for will be worth basically nothing. And the problem is, everybody eventually stops winning. And meanwhile he could be having a relationship, he could be having a night on the town, he could be doing ANYTHING but doing upside-down sit-ups alone at home on Christmas, but instead he's doing that. I wonder if he'll actually approve of his own motivations when all is said and done...

I know your question is probably rhetorical, but generally people who aren't familiar with Taiyo Matsumoto's works find it ugly. Which is a shame, because I find his manga to be absolutely gorgeous. Tekkonkinkreet and Sunny especially.
>> ARTICLE
I don't find it ugly, to me it looks like western comics or painting. The other people who don't watch this because of the art style should look beyond pop culture art
>> ARTICLE
I know the art style was something I had a hard time getting used to for ep.1 but I'm glad I kept going
>> ARTICLE
WAIT WAIT, the author of the manga is the author of Tekkonkinkreet? And here I was giving all my love just to Yuasa when another one of my most-loved japanese artists is involved! I had no doubt the original material was fantastic as well, but now I'm thinking I'm going to read the manga once the anime is done.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, yeah, definitely rhetorical.

But that shot was such a wonderful example of color and angle to create beauty that I had to highlight it.

It's not like this is a particularly beautiful story by conventional standards, either. It's gritty, rough and occasionally brutal. I find that the visual style matches that tone well.

The beauty of this show is in its truth, not in its presentation.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I think that Yuasa is a great director, and just that - a great director. When the stuff he is directing has a strong story, like Ping Pong, it ends up really good. When the stuff he is directing is weaker, it just seems like an average (or worse, below-average) story dressed up in an exorbitant fashion, resulting in an anime that is praised for its art style above all else.

Same thing with the director Yuasa, I think their styles go well together.

That too. I had such high hopes and was not disappointed. It went so well together.

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YEAH!!! I've been waiting five episodes for this! PECO'S BACK BABY!!

Edit:

On a serious note, this episode once again proves that Ping Pong is a top tier show this season. A phenomenal story sewn together by superb character development, subtle yet encompassing themes, and wonderful pacing leaves me speechless after every episode. 

Probably my favorite thing that this series does (and sometimes the most frustrating thing) is how they juggle between all of these characters. Instead of having a very full and robust character or two interacting with a team of stand-ins, we have a full line of unique and wonderful characters. At certain times it becomes very difficult to explain my emotions about certain characters. Honestly, I cannot find a single character to hate in this show. Kong goes from cocky-douchebag to team leader and momma's boy. Akuma goes from annoying rival to a caring friend. It's all too great to express.

If this show can continue to progress at the way it does now, there is not a doubt in my mind that it will be my favorite anime of all time. Now excuse me while I go watch this episode again.
>> ARTICLE
> Honestly, I cannot find a single character to hate in this show.

Hate might be strong, but I have yet to have any shred of sympathy emerge from my heart for Dragon.

I posted that above in response to another comment. Thought you might welcome the different perspective, even if you already kinda know that's how it is. I definitely sympathise with him, even if I can't relate to his situation. None of it is really his choice, even though his determined attitude makes it appear to be his choice.
>> ARTICLE
Like others said, he needs to constantly show he's the best. He can't ever take mercy on someone, he has to always strive to be better or do more, and someone like that, if they're not thinking about Ping Pong every second of every day, they might consider it a waste. He's just tunnel visioned on it.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, from what we can infer a little bit from this episode, Dragon may be the main source of income for his family. So he must do whatever he can to make sure that he's number one and that the school he plays for is number one.

That's what I got from it at least.
>> ARTICLE
He certainly shoulders the responsibility and expectations of being the best. Sometimes that title can weight you down.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, hmm...I hadn't picked up on the family thing.

It's just that I personally haven't connected with him yet, but I have no doubts that if the show wants me to care about him eventually, I will.
>> ARTICLE
Just wanted to say, in the movie version of this, the scene with Peco jumping off the bridge was *the very first scene at the start of the movie*, I was really fucking curious how they would pull this off in chronological order, but it works just as well, perhaps even better.

I would also like to point out how adorable Kong and his mother are together, that entire singing scene was beautiful, [the small cut of Sakuma at the roadworks](http://i.imgur.com/l7y5HwE.png) tore my heart in two. We also got to see Kazama is actually quite a big softie when he wants to be too.
>> ARTICLE
>We also got to see Kazama is actually quite a big softie when he wants to be too.

Wait, what? I was under the impression that Kazama never showed up at the Needle, that his girlfriend (coach's daughter) only imagined it and she came home to find him training after deleting the message to him from his phone. How was he a softie?

I just watched episodes 5 and 6 at once so I don't remember which episode this part happened in, but Wenge crying as the train left with his mom outside waving goodbye, that scene hit me very squarely in the feels. Powerful stuff.

On that note, Wenge's character development has been really stellar. I mean, everyone's had great development, but Wenge, man. Wenge might be my favorite character of this show. I also really like Sakuma. It's very refreshing to see the "hard worker" character archetype subverted; usually you have some guy like Naruto or whatever who claims to work hard but in the end has a bunch of inherent bullshit powers that end up saving his ass time and again. Here we see Sakuma work really, really, really hard, and then end up failing, badly. The show is painfully aware of how much talent matters in the real world and it wants to make its viewers painfully aware of it too. It really makes you feel for him, especially since his character archetype is usually one of the most annoying kinds in anime. He and the rest of this cast all feel so human.

God this is a great anime.
>> ARTICLE
Gosh it's like Smile is the antagonist to Peco becoming the protagonist now. Or rather it was always like that and I only just realized it. What a great show.
>> ARTICLE
That's not it at all. They are both protagonists. Smiles became the antagonist because he wants to inspire Peco to improve his ping pong and become the protagonist. At least that's what I got from the episode.
>> ARTICLE
I had the same realisation. In this one episode they flipped the character's role with how Tsukimoto changed after he realised his potential. I'm guessing Peco will eventually get as strong as Tsukimoto but idk. In the end though the two are the main characters, a pair with a big gap in ping pong.
>> ARTICLE
anime of the season right here

This episode was excellent! It felt less sloppily animated than last week's as well.

That Christmas karaoke segment was gorgeous. The music in this series has been consistently good, and that felt like a great choice. The colors used in that segment were really great as well, definitely nailed that cold, kind of artificial brightness that Christmas lights give off. I think that's going to be a scene that'll really stick with me once the series is over. It was just really lyrical and bittersweet.

I loved that great robot action at the start, there's something about that robot music and the sound effects used with Smile that really works for me. I also had a little chuckle at  "Attack on Robot."
>> ARTICLE
Last episode wasn't about conflicts, as much as it was about fallout of conflicts, and about acceptance. Accepting that being at the top means you're being alone, and the only ones who can understand you are your rivals. Friends, cast away; allies, discarded.

Smile is a lonely robot, he can do it on his own, but then, why did he lose to Peco, to stay around him? Why did he idolize Peco with his sure manner and quick tongue? And Peco is heart-broken and alone. Without his old friend, without Ping Pong to affirm his status as a victor, rather than a cry-baby.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) The Destroyer is Here - But He's Nice Inside:**

1. *Yesss*, the first scene in the episode follows my pre-amble! [The giant robot is attacked by gnats](http://i.imgur.com/EUF5hCP.jpg), who keep poking at him, drawing his attention. But he doesn't care, he'll just smash them all. That's Smile, and the others are his weak opponents, and his weak teammates, and perhaps his own emotions, which he eliminates, in one fell swoop.

 ["Only the legendary hero could defeat the robot, but he is absent!"](http://i.imgur.com/sLfyKmA.jpg) - First, I love the 40s (?) cartoon style narration we've got going on here. Second, it shows the war within Smile's soul, for both the hero and the robot are he himself. He needed to win, he needed power, and he couldn't let the hero burst out, and put himself out there, so he drew even farther in, and had allowed the robot to envelop him in its cold and nerve-deadening embrace. This is the demon-angel dichotomy, and as one rises, the other fades.

1. "Robots are cool! What do they mean when they say "hero" anyway? [The robot is cold-blooded, but he's really nice on the inside!"](http://i.imgur.com/ozqtRVt.jpg) - Aww, kids sure are cute, idolizing the powerful one, and not following the nebulous idea of a "Hero" they had never met, before being corrupted by how narratives are *expected* to play out. Power lurking is a powerful concept, but so is an all-powerful character, who is actually kind, but hides it behind a cold shell. One can see how a child will grow to idolize the most powerful character in a narrative (and then grow up to write an LN about it, making the heartless and all-powerful "robot" its protagonist, and call it "Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei" :P)

1. And now, just in case you somehow missed it, the high school students speak of the robot, and then without missing a beat we realize they're speaking of Smile.

**2) Team and Member:**

1. ["It's fine you lost, I don't expect anything from you anyway."](http://i.imgur.com/FPza07i.jpg) - That *burn*. It burns all that much more because it's said so matter-of-factly, there is no vitriol here, just saying how it is. He doesn't even try to be mean, it's just how he sees things.

1. Sakuma living up to his nickname (Akuma = Demon), and also to the "Samurai Show" sensibilities. He wasn't thrown out of the team, so now he's planning a betrayal, a coup! "I wish you were the captain!" - He's got a point though, just as antler-hair is still Smile's captain. The captain doesn't have to be the strongest player, but the motivator. And yes, when your school is founded on "Strength!" as a concept, it might lead to picking the wrong captain.

1. Man, this show is structured *so well*, every time I make a point, they move to a scene that is directly an answer or a continuation of it - here we see Smile and his team, ["Whether you're right or wrong doesn't matter! You're pissing us off!"](http://i.imgur.com/ovomdPh.jpg) - Smile thinks of objectives and objects, forgetting you play games and form clubs with *people*. Alone at the top, only increasing the distance - as the distance in skill increases, so does the interpersonal one, and vice versa.

1. "I just want him to do his job." - ["Humans aren't perfect."](http://i.imgur.com/6KmzCuR.jpg) - Smile must accept weaknesses from others, and to accept he has flaws within him as well - failure to accept others' flaws, for instance.

1. Hm, so he *did* quit, and that was someone else? Kaio is hard, with all of them having shaved heads :P

1. Are they truly going to turn Captain Ota ("Antler Hair") into a character? He does care for his team, and for Smile as well, and now he's told - "It's fine if Tsukimoto stands out, his goals and ours aren't the same. We're here as a side-dish, and he's here as the main-course." Time to make everyone co-exist, *Captain*.

**3) Dreams and Reality - Talent and Loneliness:**

1. [Thinking-man statue, and a thinking man to go alongside it](http://i.imgur.com/JQSzS1l.jpg). The shower is indeed one of the two best places for some heavy thinking. From one captain, to another.

1. This little chat between Kazama and his cousin touched on so many things. [Those without talent shouldn't follow their dreams](http://i.imgur.com/qutyhZX.jpg) - was this about his father, or himself? It's possible he turned his talent into his dream, and his original dream was otherwise, such as taking care of flowers? And while [his cousin adores his father for following his dream](http://i.imgur.com/qreUpxB.jpg), which is the spiel they always sell us on athletes, [Kazama isn't as appreciative](http://i.imgur.com/J8D0Hfu.jpg) - heroes are "heroes" because they don't bend to reality and always follow a predetermined course of action, like Don Quixote. To win, one must adapt - which makes me think he perhaps had indeed given up on his dream.

 What of Smile, then? "The Robot" doesn't truly adapt, only changes how he demolishes his opponents, but demolish them he shall.

1. So, why are we here with Peco and his "girlfriend"? Remember how I said the scenes in this show follow one another perfectly? Earlier I spoke of objectives and objects, of having subjects, instead of friends. Kaio's president is treating the players as people he hires or bribes with gifts, rather than as people with dreams - and Peco's girlfriend shows us there isn't much difference between [those who *demand* gifts](http://i.imgur.com/EXjqqfc.jpg), and those who foist "gifts" on another, and demand tribute.

1. [Coach Kong! Awesome!](http://i.imgur.com/n2iUSMb.jpg) He knows how important coaches are, and how terrible it is to be alone. Yes, he could be better served by ignoring his underclassmen, but he helps them. Good guy Kong.

 See? Kong's teammates *want* to come and be in his presence. [A lively dinner-table, a *family*.](http://i.imgur.com/aIAZKIu.jpg) - As stark a difference as possible from [Smile's lonely dinner-table](http://i.imgur.com/Rw27gDo.jpg). He ends up not eating the cake either.

1. Kaio's 2nd in command dreams of Kazama's cousin. Hue. Yeah, everyone in Smile and Kazama's school is all alone, but Kong gets to have fun with others. Is it because he *lost*, so he knows there is life after Ping Pong? I think so.

1. [Kazama isn't completely alone either](http://i.imgur.com/B4uTAgS.jpg). And here is Beach Boy. Hm, with the whole "Christmas Break" episode, I take it things will become *explosive* soon.

 Oh shit, that was her *visualizing* being with Kazama. He didn't join her and instead is busy training :O

**4) "I'm a Golden God!" - Rekindling the Flame:**

1. Oh man, [Sakuma looks like someone who is ready to join the army!](http://i.imgur.com/Wy5ymBp.jpg) "You've got talent, so you keep playing!" - But who said it's his *dream*? You shouldn't do something just cause you're good at it. Poor Akuma, wanting to, but not having the talent.

1. Earlier we had Kazama speak of "[adapting to reality.](http://i.imgur.com/XtNoUAp.jpg)" Running away from it is something both Akuma and Peco had done - Akuma by thinking he can achieve his dream without talent, and Peco by acting as if he doesn't have talent, or thinking his talent will enable him to not put in any effort. Interesting how this exchange showcases the difference in their personalities - "You can't keep coasting on talent" - Peco took it as "Quit, since you're going to coast" but Akuma meant it as "Get your ass in gear! Become worthy of your talent!"

1. Melodramatic Peco is hilarious, ["I used to be golden god! No one could compare to me!"](http://i.imgur.com/u9hv8ro.jpg) - Dude, you're a first-year student in high school, and you didn't break anything, physically. Stop running away!

 LOL! "I'm a Golden God!" - and then he leaps into the water - how *fitting* :D

1. [And here we see as Peco falls into the depths not just his history, but Smile's](http://i.imgur.com/F4UHHqS.jpg). Their history and fates are intertwined - after all, Smile wanted to be like Peco, and picked up Peco's dream from him. Smile wanted Peco to be happy, so kept losing to him. We see that Peco used to have a dream, he wanted to be the best, but as he had just told Sakuma, he never even *considered* someone could be better than him.

 And Smile? [Smile wanted a simple world](http://i.imgur.com/c2MPN88.jpg), a world where you play Ping Pong to pass the time, a world without having to make trade-offs, a world without *emotions*. But what is Smile's dream? If it is to win at Ping Pong, then his adaptation is to make trade-offs, to accept emotions, even as he crushes them. But if his dream *is* to live a simple life, than why Ping Pong? Unless he plans to lose it all, until he has nothing more to lose. Seeing him sit alone in front of his Christmas cake didn't feel one with a sense of contentedness, after all.

1. [Serial-smoker Old Lady Coach!](http://i.imgur.com/6GI64Gk.jpg) Coaches are the best in this show! 

**Post Episode Thoughts - "The Hero Awakens":**

It hit me! I know what's going on! "I don't want to see Peco being lame." - Peco realizes his dream may intersect with Smile's. Perhaps it is Smile's dream for Peco, his *hero* to win.

I thought that Smile thought he's the hero, and the robot, and the two are fighting with one another. But then we've seen "The Hero from Planet Ping Pong" in Peco's mind as he was sinking in the depths (well, the shallows). The Hero? It's not Smile, it's Peco.

Smile had been bullied, and lonely, until a hero came and saved him. That hero had been Peco, to Smile. Smile will be the monster, and Smile will crush all humans, *until a hero will appear*. Smile will be the villain, so Peco will have a reason to come forth, to train, and *slay* him.

The strong monster is only there, and only *so* strong, so as to accentuate the power of the hero that eventually defeats it. Yes, Smile let Peco defeat him, so Peco would be cool - but the stronger the opponent, the more glorious the hero will eventually be.

Heroes and monsters, that's what our main 4 characters are. All of them are somewhere on the range, willing to kill their hearts, to destroy others; willing to sacrifice their happiness, to take down other monster/heroes. To some of them, they are always the hero, and the opponent always the monster. They live in order to fight, the only time they truly feel alive. And so, as they defeat other monsters, they appear as monsters in turn, and help foster the seeds of new heroes, who perhaps will turn into monsters again.

It's a lonely path, and that's what seeing the image of himself next to Smile (unless it was the Old Lady with Coach Koizumi) awakened within Peco - that they should be there for one another, *together*. [Why does Peco want to learn ping pong from the beginning?](http://i.imgur.com/onnLsQl.jpg) Because he has a lot of bad habits to unlearn, and it's up to the old hero to pass their knowledge to the new one. The grizzled and smoking veteran, who is also a bit of a *dragon*. Also, during the episode we talk of dreams and before he leaped into the water, I asked if it's been Peco's dream to be good at Ping Pong - talent without dream is as bad as dream without talent, but we've seen him recall his old dream.

I don't think that was Sakuma who was training. Remember he got kicked off the team, so it was probably some other lookalike.

Yeah, I always write these as I watch the show, well, usually. I sometimes go for post-episode mini-editorials, but I usually note it in my opening paragraph :>

Before this show started I thought Smile was the protagonist. Now it's clear that all five of them are, especially Peco
>> ARTICLE
Wow Smile's desire to play ping pong has changed so much. He's gone from just playing for fun to training to his fullest extent. He's arrogant now and its costing him, which was pretty cool when showed him during the karaoke scene as he spend Christmas alone. Even the other players who had been shown to train hardcore like Kazama were able to be with others.

I also can't wait to see Peco's comeback, as well as what happens with Sakuma. On an unrelated note does anyone know the name of the song in the karaoke scene? Was it an original?
>> ARTICLE
I think the idea this show is getting at is that to succeed you have to sacrifice everything. All your friends, all your family, everything you care about, they all come second to ping pong, otherwise you will never be able to reach the highest levels of the sport. Its not just Smile as well, its also Kazama, him missing his cousins text because he's to busy training, that's what you need to sacrifice to get where he is.
>> ARTICLE
On the other hand, is that the life they are willing to live? We see in this episode just how much joy Kong is having right now that the competition is no longer the no.1 priority

That's not Kazama - I thought it was too. But if you look at his eyebrows, that's actually Sanada, the other buff baldy who was on the team; earlier, someone else at Kaio said they wished Sanada was captain instead, because he's a lot nicer and more encouraging compared to Kazama, if significantly less talented.
>> ARTICLE
1) That was not Kazama with the tissues. That's the guy who is holding together the team in Kazama's stead.

2) Kazama did not actually join his cousin. That was her imagination. In reality, he never even saw her message because he was too busy training.

I started watching this week. Having never read the Manga nor having heard much about it, I didn't expect it to be so technical with the actual table tennis. It made me quite excited to see that noitamina is actually working with JTTA and making it as accurate as possible.

There are some things I'm a bit confused about:

Why is Smile putting effort into ping pong and practicing now? 

Is Kong back home now? I thought he said he was staying in Japan but I can't see any reason for his mother to be there.

He's still in Japan, which is why you saw him pick up his Mother with her baggage and why all his guests are speaking Japanese.

Did Kazuma masturbate to poster of the girl on his ceiling? It shows a frame where he is looking up at it with a couple used tissues next to him on his bed.

Apparently that is Sanada, the guy who was told he should be captain. And, I think you are right. He was masturbating to her picture.

>> ARTICLE
Can't recall exactly, but something like 'worst animation of the season'.
>> ARTICLE
Worst anime or animation? I'd agree that the animation is not the greatest thing I've seen in anime. But when everything else is so good, I just don't give a shit anymore. 
>> ARTICLE
> Id agree that the animation is not the greatest thing I've seen in anim

Well, the actual animation its self is simply top notch. I think its the art style you have issues with.

Personally I think its one of the most awesomely unique series ive watch in a long time
>> ARTICLE
I would argue and say that the animation is fantastic. Its so unique and different and so abstract! Its awesome! It proves that the style of the animation trumps how smooth or pretty it is. Honestly, I have no complaints about this show. I think it could be the best anime of this year if it gets any better!
>> ARTICLE
There are some frame rate drops in certain scenes
>> ARTICLE
> It proves that the style of the animation trumps how smooth or pretty it is

It really doesn't prove that, because what you are talking about is art style and design, not animation.
>> ARTICLE
I think the word you're looking for is art. The animation is the fluidity of the movements, which I would definitely agree is the worst this season.
>> ARTICLE
>the style of the animation trumps how smooth or pretty it is.

Yup. It's true. For me, "good animation" means how smooth it is. Anime looking like Ping Pong but with the animation of say... I dunno SAO or SnK's best episodes would still get a "good animation" mark from me. 

But in Ping Pong's case, I don't care since I have something else to care about. 
>> ARTICLE
SAO had pretty bad animation overall, they just had flashes of smoothness when kirito needed to upgrade his badass level. And the choreography was pretty bad even then, so the animation felt wasted ;(
>> ARTICLE
Heh, you know what I mean though :p
>> ARTICLE
> But in Ping Pong's case, I don't care since I have something else to care about.

That's very, very well said.

Prediction: Peco blows his knee out and [this happens to everyone](http://i.imgur.com/4iKLrDj.png)
>> ARTICLE
Definitely.

I think that Peco will have a good showing against Kazama and his effort will be obvious to Smile. Just as we begin to think that Peco may have a chance, his knee will fail him and Smile will be forced to slay the Dragon for his fallen hero.
>> ARTICLE
My prediction is that Smile forfeits in order to prevent Peco from injuring himself.
>> ARTICLE
I think Smile will throw the game, like his coach did for his best friend back in the day. 
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, I don't see a way for Peco to win a game against Kazama. Sure, Peco has improved a LOT, but he's already exhausted and his knee is already screwed. We could see what destructive power Kazama's shots have. Peco probably won't last very long unless he gains some super powers.
>> ARTICLE
There really is no way Peco is gonna lose against Kazama. It just doesn't make any sense storytelling-wise
>> ARTICLE
Again, unless he gains some plot super powers, he can't possibly win such a matchup. We'll see next week.
>> ARTICLE
That being said, Wenge's characterization was so rapid, and so hyped, and yet he bombs out early. That was surprising to me as well... A typical sports anime would have had a Kazama/Smile + Wenge/Peco semi-finals, with a Smile/Peco final. 
>> ARTICLE
Very true. I also was very suprised when Wenge got utterly destroyed by Kazama and now got beaten in the first round. I guess Peco losing is indeed a possibility
>> ARTICLE
Isn't all these scenes with Kazama showing that he questions his reason to play? Peco has a bad knee, but the Dragon has no treasure to guard. The Hero has a small advantage here.
>> ARTICLE
That's true. We'll see how it goes next week. This anime after all, never stops surprising me.
>> ARTICLE
I think that next week he needs to lose to Peco. When he loses, he will be released, just like Wenge. Because he's the hero.
>> ARTICLE
bold prediction, but I'm saying episode 11 is Kazama vs Smile
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I feel like this is the only way it can end. It'd be cool if Peco beat Kazama and all, but it's just unrealistic with an injured knee, and if he does, it would kind of just kill the show's realism so far and feel too much like a shounen "you can do anything with the power of friendship" ending.
>> ARTICLE
Power of friendship?  
Hasn't Peco been intensely training, maximizing his huge potential?
>> ARTICLE
The industrial robot sounds are nice at adding to Tsukimoto's theme.

So much buildup so much hype, the hero vs the dragon next week.

>> ARTICLE
Ocean dude is back!
>> ARTICLE
And with a crazy tan, too.
>> ARTICLE
"They won't even use my footage..."

And he's as positive as ever.
>> ARTICLE
"Am i the footage?"
>> ARTICLE
Well there we go, the real reason Smile is called Smile, why him and Peco are friends in the first place, and the true reason why Peco is working harder than he ever has before.

Back when Peco saw the photo in ep. 6 I just assumed it was showing how much fun he had with Smile and Demon, but instead it was actually showing us the very nature of their friendship. 

Every episode I say this, and for every episode I will continue to say this: Absolutely stunning. 

LETS GO PECO!!!
>> ARTICLE
I don't even know how I want this to end.

I don't want Peco to fuck up his knee... But I don't think he has a right to win at this point, either.

And this series just continually gets better. I feel like the whole cast is developed every episode. Even though Peco and Smile are the protagonists, we never lose sight of what makes all the other characters human... Kong's losses, his coach, his team; Kazama's fears and uncertainties; Demon's acceptance and empathy; Sanada's hopes and dreams.
>> ARTICLE
If Peco wins against Kazama, he's going to be in a really bad shape. Then I expect Smile will give up, sort of mirroring the coach's story. Except it won't matter nearly as much (they both still get to go to the championship, right?)

Or Kazama beats Peco brutally and Smile wants revenge... But that sounds kind of cliche.

Whatever, I just want the two to reunite. It's clear that Peco isn't holding any hard feelings against Smile, but they're both still keeping their distance.
>> ARTICLE
expect the unexpected :P amazing ending read d manga hehe
>> ARTICLE
 I dont know if Smile would lose on purpose on a match vs Peco... I would like to think he learned how much worse for the opponent that is. Even with Pecos knee on the line.

 In the end Smile may end up going for the olympic medal to fulfill Pecos dream, because I dont know if there will be any recovery for him after Kazama.   
>> ARTICLE
I'm expecting Smile to be Smiling throughout the match and he will force Peco to use his good knee in order not to bust his damaged one.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that Smile won't go easy on Peco. Everything in the story up to now points towards them facing each other in the final. I think that's the crux of the narrative conflict. Although Kazama's inner demons are interesting I don't think they're compelling enough to deserve the spotlight in the final.

I really hope the writer(s) don't go easy on Peco's knee, but sadly I don't see how they can turn that into a fulfilling resolution without killing off knee-chan. Well, they've been knocking it out of the park so far so I'll just have to wait and see.
>> ARTICLE
The outcome's already been written. This anime is based off of the original manga, if you're interested.
>> ARTICLE
Hm, I'm gonna put my fingers in my ears...

But being serious, has it followed the manga to the letter so far?
>> ARTICLE
One of the few anime's that not only follows the manga closely, but adds a lot to it.  The manga and movie are both great, and the anime somehow is even better.
>> ARTICLE
Read the manga. So far, it's moved a few things around and added in more character details, new people and backstory (especially with Wenge, who was actually REALLY IGNORED in the manga), but the main elements and plot have all remained there. Is it following the manga to the letter? I'd say yes, but it's definitely an improvement on it.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, I'm glad the writers were brave enough to add their own flavor, and competent enough to pull it off.
>> ARTICLE
Thats an interesting point, seeing as Wenge is kind of the best character in the whole show. With very tough competition, of course.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely my favourite character as well, as a Chinese speaker I can tell you that Yousei Bun is absolutely killing the role. When I read the manga like a couple of episodes into the show, I was genuinely worried it'd follow it exactly and I wouldn't be seeing much more of him - but I'm glad that the show decided to give his character more time and development. Yurie and Sanada aren't featured in the manga either (Yurie is anime-only) and I feel that both of them *also* add a lot to the plot and the themes on sport and what it's for. I'd strongly recommend the anime over the manga any day - not a lot of series I'd do that for, but this is one of them where the adaptation beats the original by miles. 
>> ARTICLE
Can't help you on that one. I've only flipped through a couple pages. I think the anime has taken certain artistic liberties and done a really good job at it.

The rules of ping pong has changed since the manga was written too. I guess it used to be on a 21 point scale. The anime uses the modern 11 point system.
>> ARTICLE
How the hell is it possible for a show about Ping Pong to be THIS GOOD? 
>> ARTICLE
All 9 episodes so far have been godly, and it's going to be even better in the last two. It has been a while since there's a series that's this amazing
>> ARTICLE
Credit to the writer of the manga and the director of the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Because there is more focus on character development of Smile, Peco (and Wenge, Kazama), only it is shown through the sport of ping pong.
>> ARTICLE
The chills I got at the end, absolutely amazing.

The theme of this episode seemed to be continuing exploring why the players play.

Kong no longer playing for himself but for his teammates, Peco playing for Smile, and Kazama playing for his family's sake (?). This episode was a bit light on actual ping pong but I have no doubt the next one will more than make up for it.
>> ARTICLE
That last image of Peco... fucking epic as fucking fuck.

[YOSHA!](http://i.imgur.com/kCeC8c0.png)
>> ARTICLE
I think the big question we get as viewers then is:
"Who does smile play for?"
>> ARTICLE
Peco said it himself, that Smile has been calling for him for a long time. It even kind of alluded to that the first time Smile "summoned" the hero and just wrecked his opponent, but we progressively find out and are reminded that the hero is actually Peco. Smile calls to Peco through his play.


>> ARTICLE
This was touched on a bit in previous episodes but it wasn't very conclusive. For me it seems he plays to fill a void, to feel some purpose and maybe to an extent for Peco. 
>> ARTICLE
Kazama is lost, I think. He's too afraid to face up to his true motivations.

He said it was for himself when Demon asked him, but for his team when Sanada asked him. That he would just outright lie like that says a lot.
>> ARTICLE
I could take it a few ways:

- he is playing for himself, but doesn't want to appear to be a selfish prick to his teammates/wants to keep the team moral high.

- he doesn't know what he's playing for.

- he's playing for something he doesn't want to speak about and is telling convenient lies to everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Is he? As viewers of the flashback sequences, it's clear that Kazama plays for his dad. He just doesn't tell anyone. 
>> ARTICLE
That ending scene made me pump my fist in the air. So great. I got weirdly emotional about seeing Smile actually smiling too.

I still love how much subtlety there is in the character writing. That one line that Peco said about Smile's absentee father giving him the video games adds even more weight to his constant usage of them. Sakuma's conversation with Kazama was similar, it doesn't hold the viewers hand, but it gives you just enough to fill in the rest. 

In terms of the visuals, I dug the curved panelling that wiped in from the top and bottom of the screen during Smile and Sanada's match. We hadn't seen that before and I thought it made things a little more dynamic.
>> ARTICLE
Which scene did Smile smile? I watched the ending of this episode again and didn't see that happen.
>> ARTICLE
Flashback. Go rewatch the last part, it's heartwarming, hearing how Peco and Smile became friends and the reason for Smile's nickname.


>> ARTICLE
Holy crap those feels at the end! We all knew it would come to Peco damaging his knee badly but now we see what it was all worth. The hero is finally here!
>> ARTICLE
Knee injuries are no fun, I had a minor one, and now even after 4 years it still creaks.

I really really hope Peco bails before fucking himself up.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like he's in a mindset now where he's literally gonna play until his knee gives out or until someone else makes an intervention and stops him playing. Hopefully Smile does. But then again I think he's going to win next round but his knee is 100% done for the final with Smile and that's when it's going to be the big decision of whether Butterfly Joe's history is repeated.
>> ARTICLE
Peco is going to go all out like a hero should regardless of the final result. He held an unspoken promise with Smile and he's going to hold up his end of the bargain no matter what
>> ARTICLE
Other than being an enjoyable watch, Ping Pong has given me something else.

Because of Peco, I tried learning the reverse penhold backhand, and it's a pretty satisfying shot to hit. Not going to replace my shakehand grip, but it was fun learning to hit the RPB.
>> ARTICLE
I tried the RPB back when I played penhold......yeah I really struggled with it and gave up trying. Now I just play shakehand, alot easier haha
>> ARTICLE
It's such a weird shot but somehow my loops with it are pretty consistent.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the RPB really can mess with people because of what is 'expected' with penhold in terms of their backhand. To absolutely belt it is amazing
>> ARTICLE
I teared up hard. I can't deal with a smiling Smile. Episode 11 will probably kill me.

Kazama just makes me sad. It's just not a great situation. I want to hate him, but it's impossible. He can't be honest with himself, and just him holed in the bathroom like that hits a chord with me. I like that it's such a parallel to Smile in the past. He's a monster, and no hero will save him. The fact he's called a monster and is a poster boy for ping pong, it sort of reminds me of the games Smile played to pass the time and make it through the day. In this case, ping pong for Kazama, Maybe I'm looking at it wrong, but yeah. I'm sure there's other parallels that I'm not noticing, since parallels are literally everywhere in every scene.

Kong is still awesome. 

Peco's gonna fuck his knee up, and it will be heartbreaking and glorious. Spit is not going to fix that emotional devastation. The quality of this show's characters is still astounding to me.
>> ARTICLE
I think its almost a given that he will cede the championship to Peco in the final... he is his teacher's student, after all.

In the end, all he wants is to have fun with his friend.

damn my opinion of Peco has changed seeing those last few minutes, hope he beats Kazama, which I don't expect to happen seeing as how he struggled in the quarter finals, unless Kazama's off his game because of his cousin or Sanada

In some way I'm really glad this series is using this art style. The bromance between Peco and Smile is one of the best I'd seen and so primed for fujoshi intervention if this show has a more mainstream artstyle.

i know the anime is only like 11 episodes or something but i still find it really amusing how they spent like ~30s on smile vs nekota

everything else is just how i saw it in my mind when i was reading the manga

the music tho, it still gets me everytime it starts playing
>> ARTICLE
I love how everybody is convinced of Smile's victory. Coach closed his eyes, Peco states his trust and even Ota, captain antler, remains chill through "struggle" against Sanada because he trusts him. Beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
More sea/mountain guy! I knew he would be back!
>> ARTICLE
In this week, I just caught up starting from the first episode and reading the past episode discussions. I've also seen the movie just over a decade ago, so I'm a little iffy on some of the finer details but still remember the general story. I just gotta say that this is damn good. I haven't felt this way about an anime in a long time. It's not the same feels as watching a shounen or slice of life, but just satisfying.   
The characters are very human ~~every character is best girl.~~ The soundtrack is amazing as I've also been trying to update my electronic music catalog. 

Kinda ashamed to say that this is my first experience with Yuasa's work. Maybe I should watch Tatami Galaxy and Kaiba...^I ^should ^buy ^a ^boat

After this episode, it seems like they pretty much went in depth about everyone's reasons for playing. Eagerly anticipating the Kazama vs Peco match and if the foreshadowing is correct (and for story completion), Peco vs Smile. Just one more cameo of beach/mountains/explore the world guy and the series will be complete for me.
>> ARTICLE
>Maybe I should watch Tatami Galaxy and Kaiba...

You should!  Both of them are every bit as good as Ping Pong is.  I'd reckon Tatami Galaxy is even better, though it'll take a couple months of retrospect before I'll reach a final verdict on Ping Pong.
>> ARTICLE
Tatami was pretty shitty, all the flashback episodes were definitely not worth the minor plot twitst. The music and setting had great potential but the story is not even close to Ping Pong.

Welp. More to the backlog.
>> ARTICLE
SO I have not read any of the comments on this, but I just have to say thank you to the /r/anime community for putting me on to ping-pong the animation. This is what I have been looking for. An Anime truly out of left-field. Normally I would never watch anything like this, the closest I have gotten to a sports anime is Hajime No Ippo (Which I love). I saw the discussion thread, looked it up, just finished the first episode and am absolutely hooked. 

Any more sports anime you could recommend? Thanks again!
>> ARTICLE
Hungry Heart, Whistle , Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu and Sakimichi no Apollon(not a sports anime but similar to what you seek)
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru is great. 
>> ARTICLE
Funnily enough, Ping Pong is about everything except Ping Pong. While there is a lot of specific Ping Pong jargon in it, the story itself focuses on the characters , not the sport. 

Sakimichi no Apollon mentioned above is a GREAT Example. Its a show where characters are brought together by music. Its not about the music itself. The music is the vehicle that you travel on. If you liked Ping Pong you will like this as well. I haven't watched any of the others but they're seemingly shounen sports anime, so I wouldn't go for those either.
>> ARTICLE
I very very strongly agree that, if you've loved Ping Pong like the rest of us, you should watch Sakamichi no Apollon.
>> ARTICLE
So, Kong's out of the individual competition, but there's still the team competition for him. Soon it'd be Kazama versus Peco, and then Smile versus the winner. Kazama is a dragon, Peco is a hero. Heroes are there to slay dragons.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) Tying Up Loose Threads:**

1. Smile tastes his own blood, and it tastes like iron. Makes sense that as he imagines Peco to be a hero, he imagines himself to be a robot, made of iron.

1. [The return of beach guy](http://i.imgur.com/CF54LNp.jpg)! Looks like someone just back from a trek in South America, around here.

 "[I wandered everywhere, but couldn't find a place that agreed with me.](http://i.imgur.com/KMi6M7j.jpg)" - Because you don't agree with yourself, and you carry yourself everywhere you go. And now he finds a solution. He's been *running away*, from his defeat, so now he will go there once more to close the circle.

1. "[I have to go teach my lost ducklings how to fly.](http://i.imgur.com/JEuRwZ9.jpg)" - Coach Kong, and I've said it before - the coaches are the best characters on this show.

1. [Sakuma got some glorious hair going on here](http://i.imgur.com/eUwVda4.jpg). Everyone is reuniting, all the threads of fate that got frayed last year, coming back to find their place.

**2) Old Friends and Dead Heroes:**

1. Kazama and his dad, and flashes of seeing him grip his head and try to make sense of the numbers. Did he think his father wished to be like the birds, free of the ugly wars and worries of humanity and committed suicide? Did the memories of the business failing come from later, with the grey hair, or just different lighting?

 Well, it does answer another question. This is the last time, or the *only* time, in fact, where we see Kazama *happy*. His father was his hero, and then he went away. Kazama thus lost his faith in the beautiful things such as flowers, and in heroes. As opposed to Smile, who dedicated himself to bringing his hero back. But you can't bring back the dead, though Kazama could've become the hero he dreamt of himself.

1. Smile has friends. [Peco's coach is really excited about Smile](http://i.imgur.com/1s2szDT.jpg) :)

1. "A monster, eh?" - That's what Obaba said of Sanada. Then look how she speaks of Smile - ["He's brutal and merciless, do you understand?"](http://i.imgur.com/aUotTsZ.jpg) - Smile is the true monster. Most people here think of their victory. Smile knows he's crushing the dreams of his opponents, and he's playing to do just that. "The Smile Monster".

 And we get the mechanical clanking and whirring whenever Smile moves. The Robot is here.

**3) Chasing the Heroes:**

1. Speak of irony. That's how heroes are made. Sanada realizes that Kazama puts his all into the team and ping pong, and that he doesn't dream of Yurie because he's too busy giving ping pong his all. Sanada wanted to take Yurie by being the best at ping pong, but by dreaming of Yurie as his goal he gave up his chance. And now, Kazama who dreams of the death of heroes is made a hero as well.

 To follow this show's arc, Kazama the hero must die as well. Or perhaps it is that others will idolize you, but it doesn't mean the hero isn't a normal person as well, just like Kazama's father had been.

1. But [Sanada of Kaio](http://i.imgur.com/0AVWDYa.jpg) still sees himself as a hero!

1. Kazama, are we using his questioning what a hero is to shed more light on Smile and Peco, or as his own character? I think both, just as their example of what heroes are reflects on him. Sakuma idolizes Kazama, and thus wishes him to be a true hero. Is he seeing him as one, or is it merely his wish?

1. ["Who do you play tennis for?"](http://i.imgur.com/NUCIQ44.jpg) - Same as Kazama's uncle and coach asked him before, "*What* do you play tennis for?" - Trying to find a motivation, not to see what is there, but to infuse one within him. Kazama hides in the toilet, he *voids* himself, he voids *himself*. He doesn't play tennis for himself, it's not a question of whether he plays for someone else, but that he sees his own self as a non-entity.

1. Sakuma, going to cry a bit. What a man <3

**4) Chasing the Monsters:**

1. [Behold Smile, Destroyer of Dreams](http://i.imgur.com/do8HVAX.jpg). His *destroyed* opponent asks whether he even has blood, which we know he does.

1. "It'd be dangerous for him to keep playing." - Holy shit, the past is going to repeat itself? Kazama the elder, busted knee, Coach Koizumi played to his hand and let him win, and then could never play again. Now Peco has a busted knee. But he still has to defeat Kazama to meet Smile in the finals, and as Obaba had said, Smile's strength is that in he has no mercy. But didn't Smile tell us he has feelings like everyone else? He did.

1. ["If you want to make it to the top, you need to learn the courage to raise the white flag."](http://i.imgur.com/bAvqqRH.jpg) - Are heroes those who lack *this* particular courage, or those who mastered it?

**5) The Hero and Monster's Beautiful Friendship:**

1. "Why can't you quit?" - "Smile is calling me." - [What a](http://i.imgur.com/NH5CZm4.jpg) [beautiful friendship](http://i.imgur.com/D5EWUsW.jpg).

1. [Smile's *smile*](http://i.imgur.com/Wepif4x.jpg), not because of ping pong, [but because he got to be like Peco](http://i.imgur.com/y8oalS1.jpg), and to be his *friend*.

1. "[It's not that he's "Smile" because he doesn't smile](http://i.imgur.com/pu8s1ML.jpg). [I called him that because he smiled when he played ping pong.](http://i.imgur.com/RNLjLCO.jpg)" - ;_;

 This also ties to Smile's opponent and the blood. Peco knows Smile, while everyone else does not. Peco is somewhat wrong, I think. Smile isn't there for ping pong, Smile is there for *ping pong with Peco*

1. "Peco, are you playing for smile?" - "No way! I'm doing it cause I'm the hero!" - [To which there can be only one reply (though I'd get rid of the cigarette) :)](http://i.imgur.com/sj5kvc9.jpg)

**Post Episode Thoughts:**

So, should one play ping pong for oneself, or for others? Why not both? One should play for oneself and thus also for others - Smile and Kaio would be happy if Peco and Kazama won, respectively. Play for others, and thus play for yourself.

I dunno, there's sacrifice here, and there are heroics. Peco is sacrificing his knee, and Smile sacrificed all his games where he lost to Peco, but never gave up hope. Hope Kazama hadn't had when his hero departed, who could never come back.

It's hard to say what exactly I like about this show, but the characters, the delivery, the relationships, all shine through.

> "A monster, eh?" - That's what Obaba said of Sanada. Then look how she speaks of Smile - "He's brutal and merciless, do you understand?" - Smile is the true monster. Most people here think of their victory. Smile knows he's crushing the dreams of his opponents, and he's playing to do just that. "The Smile Monster".

This statement really clicks for me.  The show established that giving your opponent a victory out of sympathy is wrong.  But this victory rings hollow because victory can only be born from the defeat of others.  To give another the victory really means that you were not serious, which actually humiliates them.  Basically, Ping Pong establishes that, in the world of competition, the best path for everyone is to try their hardest, to struggle until they cannot anymore.  Only then will the players be happy, proud, and not have any regrets from 'what ifs'.

>> ARTICLE
Wow that ending... I'm in awe. My guess is Peco will loose to Kazama but then Peco and Smile will face off at nationals
>> ARTICLE
I kind of feel that I want this anime to end at 12-13 episodes. I wouldn't want it to go any longer than that. To drag it all the way to Nationals? I wonder if the source material goes that far.
>> ARTICLE
yea i was also thinking about that... maybe theyll just have peco beat kazama and then Smile loose due to peco's knee
>> ARTICLE
Any word on when the soundtrack for this show is coming out? Or if there is anywhere I can get any of the music from? It's so freaking good... This show constantly gives me chills. That ending has me so pumped.

27th August is the earliest date I can find

The manga is as exceptional as this anime.  I know we will all thoroughly enjoy these final episodes for all they are worth!

Goddammit peco, don't be a fool and just don't play. Busting your knee is the worst thing that can happen. I busted mine 4 months ago and I still need 4 months of revalidation to go.
>> ARTICLE
Im going to miss this show so much.
>> ARTICLE
[This moment](http://i.imgur.com/lQF632C.png).  Oh man, this show keeps ramping it up.  I desperately want Peco to beat Kazama, but if the show wants to keep consistent with its brutal reality he has to lose.  Damn, I can't handle this show.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, we've come full circle, Smile and Peco, eternal friends, eternal rivals.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they were ever rivals. I truely believe Smile is honestly the happiest when Peco is playing his best , and they have fun playing ping pong.

Ping Pong The Animation, ^_^ Was worth watching and the animation got progressively better throughout the series.

Peco needs to destroy that guy and become a hero.

At this point, I'm 100% sure sea/mountain guy and his arc will somehow be tied to the series ending. Which I'm extremely happy about.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone noticed at the end how Peco switched to a paddle that can be penhold in both directions? Time to go for some trick shots next round
>> ARTICLE
Calling it: Kazama will forfeit!
>> ARTICLE
"I'm the hero and don't you forget it!" god DAMN I love Peco. 

I have no idea what the real outcome may be. There are so many plausible possibilities. 

I'm thinking maybe Peco will defeat Kazama because Kazama will be hesitant due to him  seeming to feel lost lately and there is kind of a parallel to the original fight between the 2 best friends and one with the knee problems. The one with the knee before was Kazama's dad and his son is on the other side of the conflict this time. Then Peco will face off with Smile and go all out and they will have fun and Smile will once again smile before he inevitably defeats a worn down Peco and not make the same mistake that coach did. Peco may lose, but he will still be a hero as he saves Smile from his robotic alter ego.
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else notice the poseidon mat shoes that Kazama were wearing in his scene with Sanada? I think it shows that Kazama is really playing for the team.
>> ARTICLE
Pecooo.... Fuck I'm crying. 

Let me draw your attention away from that fact with this [screencap](http://i.imgur.com/qacP6CD.jpg). Normally this show doesn't show the physical details of ping pong and instead opts to have a series of well-framed shots to convey the thematic or symbolic aspects of matches. 

Well, this shot does the same thing but this time we actually get to see the mechanics of the game. See how in both panels he's leaning over with the trajectory of his arm originating from his center of mass? This is what really happens when you defend against a shot aimed at your middle. Wow! Such accuracy.

Unfortunately I don't play ping pong in real life, so I'm pulling that completely out of my ass in standard Reddit fashion. Though if someone with actual cred can vouch for my claim please do so.

Man, I was a little heartbroken for Sakuma. No matter how much passion he has and no matter how hard he trains, his astigmatism and lack of natural aptitude hold him back from competing at an elite level. He breaks down, takes out his anger inappropriately, and finds himself kicked out of the thing he seemed to love the most.

Peco's adrift, both literally in the inner tube, and metaphorically. I liked the juxtaposition of his paddle with the moon's reflection in the river. Smile's always been associated with a crescent moon, but this time it was full. Right now Smile's finally taking his training seriously and playing closer to his full potential, so it had to have been an intentional choice. When Peco said farewell to his "partner," it seemed like a farewell to both his paddle and to Smile.
>> ARTICLE
I hope Sakuma makes a comeback, like Wenge seems to be doing.

That part when Sakuma got off the train with the Kabuki chanting and the cross-cutting with the samurai imagery... god damn, this is a pretty, smart, beautiful anime.

Wenge is back. I legitimately thought he was out of the show after last episode. 

I'm so happy with this show right now I don't even know what to do.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad we get to keep seeing his perspective on things. We have so many different people playing ping pong for so many different reasons. It's so cool seeing what makes each person tick, and what that means for their ping pong prowess.

Also, is Wenge's VA gonna switch over to Japanese now?
>> ARTICLE
I love the constrast between the reason Wenge uses his glasses and Smile uses his.

Wenge's are the shut the world out, to protect himself and to avoid showing weakness.

Smile's are like a symbol of his robotic nature; metal attached to his face.

And then Sakuma's glasses are a symbol of his weakness.

Damn, that's freaking great stuff.

This is super late... but what does it mean? I feel like I'm missing something obvious

I'm in love with every character in this show; even the antagonists win me over. Kong has become my favorite character and even Sakuma had me feeling sorry for him at the end here. Poor guy just wanted to be good at ping pong.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm in love with every character in this show

I totally agree, the characters are amazing and they totally carry this show. [little manga spoiler](/s "It's the first anime/series with equal amount of character dedication I've ever seen/read. You will actually find out that there is no true antagonist/protagonist in this series.")
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, so it seems like Kazama's "flaw" is that he lacks empathy and suffers from tunnel vision. He's not interested in winning glory for himself - he worries about winning glory for the club and the school. Hence why he's willing to call his teammates trash if it means he can bring strong players to boost the team. Also the reason why he's so willing to give up on Sakuma. 

So, who's right? Kazama's coach, who praises Sakuma's hard work ethic and appreciates his dedication, or Kazama himself, who is interested in talent. In the context of winning, Kazama is obviously "correct," but I do wonder if there's not some merit to Sakuma either...
>> ARTICLE
If you are willing to put pride over skill there is pretty much every other ing pong club available to you. 

If you join Kaio you are there to be the best no compromise.
>> ARTICLE
Put some weight on Peco?

Loving the recap of whats happened, with the reintroductions of the players from the tournament and where they ended. Loved how Sakuma in his jealously decided to take on Smile just to prove a point. And the artwork stays the same with this awesome idea of one player being a persona on the "battle field". Smile really wanted to get revenge and the look on his face of anger was a great sight to see.


So now Wenge has said goodbye to his coach, yet keeps practicing, why? And what now for Peco? he's put weight on and thrown his bat into the river, is he done? Or will he get a new bat and play a new way, finally learning? How about option 3: He learned something about himself when Smile told Sakuma that he isn't good.

Although I don't like how they're so far ahead with little explanation. Peco goes on holiday, grows hair and gets a tan, and it took me a little bit to realise it was Peco.


I would of done a breakdown of some of the stuff about the sport like I've done for the last few weeks, but there wasn't anything related to the sport here. Which might be a good thing moving on. The match they had was done quickly to show the dominance
>> ARTICLE
I think Peco just "offered" a bat to the river for Sakuma since he quit.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, that was his bat, You could tell because Peco plays classic penhold, and his bat had a square patch on the back for his fingers to rest. Sakuma plays reverse and has a rubber on the back. That bat that Peco chucked into the river was defiantly his

That was Peco..... I went most of the episode wondering who this guy was.

I felt really sad at the end when he threw his paddle into the river. Ping pong is about having fun with friends. :(

It's also not fun playing with friends miles better than you. :(

I've always felt like thats an immature stance. You should count yourself lucky having friends much better than you.

Ha. Okay. I thought I missed something in the episode.

wasn't expecting this anime make me have the feels ;__'

but wow, didnt know that Peco was a smoker, pretty interesting

also Smile seems to be more heartless now :( pls go bak to ur old self and just play ping pong to pass the time
>> ARTICLE
I think Peco traded candy for cigs :(
>> ARTICLE
He's still eating sweets, only now he's added cigarettes to his list of vices. 
>> ARTICLE
Smile isn't heartless, shown by how he threw the game with Kong. One reason he dumps on Sakuma is that Sakuma bullied him in the past.
>> ARTICLE
Very good point. He was a bit heartless, but I did love the ridiculously blunt retort "because you haven't got a talent for table tennis, Akuma".
>> ARTICLE
Another reason is that seeing how Kong got completely destroyed when he played the dragon, maybe part of Smile realizes that no good will come out of going easy on others, since they'll eventually lose one way or another. Smile was not particularly cruel going about this either, he just told things as they were.
>> ARTICLE
Wenge is one of the most likable characters in anime, I'm glad that they're keeping him around, his scenes are always brilliant.

It's a great shame that Peco is sliding into obscurity, hopefully he can realise his potential before he gives up on his dream altogether. I suppose for him, the idea of being second to Smile is unacceptable, so why even bother?
>> ARTICLE
I feel the realisation that he had been "losing" to Smile all this time without him noticing would be an even bigger blow. It didn't seem like Smile just suddenly improved, but he was just sucking on purpose, while both he and sakuma treated him as an inferior.
>> ARTICLE
kazama looks like sexy squidward
>> ARTICLE
Ok, nap and having to finish writing something put me several hours behind, but Ping Pong will surely wait! Time to see where we're going this time around. I'm expecting a lot from Peco, who had lost, and who had seen what Smile is capable of. Is this gonna be Peco's episode, or one where he acts as a supporting character for Smile? Or will it be something else altogether? Well, time to find out.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) The Previous Showdown's Fallout:**

1. Sakuma, nick-named "Akuma"? The whole pre-OP part was all of his moments from the previous episodes. So, will we get to learn more of the world and characters through a tertiary character? Show me what you've got.

1. [A parting between master and student](http://i.imgur.com/IxJ5npB.jpg). Usually, they break apart when the master has nothing left to teach, but here it's the student leaving, even if it seems otherwise - to find his own place in the world, to prove his own worth.

1. Wow, talk about a rude awakening, and a call-out, to his own school. Almost like the master of a dojo slapping his students awake. "My disciples are weak! We need more players like *that* person, from the other school! Look to him!" - I'm actually not too fond of the message he's sending to his disciples, and I can understand why Sakuma is pissed. Peco - talent without effort. Sakuma? Effort to overcome lack of talent. Smile is a combination of not caring about effort, and not caring about winning. Smile currently is almost a raw ball of talent. The message Kazama is sending is you're either born good, or you don't matter.

 And now reality, as opposed to the message to the media, ["You're World Champion, but you've got it rough."](http://i.imgur.com/Fx6uFBl.jpg) - Everyone has their own problems.

1. Hm, this dude who is an ass, complaining about the prices, looking at Ping Pong news over rubbing lotion over his girlfriend (!), then calls for ice-cream and leaves his girlfriend to pay? Sure sounded like Peco. The long hair though? Makes me think we've had somewhat of a time-skip, as Kazama got to go to the Juvenile Olympics as well.

 Also, the dude selling them the ice cream? [That's the beach lover whom Smile crushed](http://i.imgur.com/BDZ0Pxu.jpg). He's a nomad. He doesn't know his place, he doesn't know *himself*, so no matter where he is, [he thinks he should go elsewhere](http://i.imgur.com/izYF7OR.jpg). But until he finds his core, his roots, he'll keep wandering.

1. Peco, [you look like such a little kid](http://i.imgur.com/L7AWpgp.jpg). And now Peco is [all washed-out](http://i.imgur.com/N51tYft.jpg). Peco, you've let yourself go! I guess the loss, and the realization about Smile hit *hard*.

1. [Sakuma is unhappy](http://i.imgur.com/lPQ4U1g.jpg). I don't think we've ever seen him happy, since he was a child and admired Peco, alongside Smile. Even when he defeated Peco, he was filled with venom. Not a good life to have. He's looking to find someone better than he himself, and to be recognized by that player. He wishes Kazama to acknowledge him. He would've wanted Peco to acknowledge him, but here is the thing - to be acknowledged by a player, he needs to defeat them, and then that person is no longer better than him, so acknowledgement becomes meaningless.

**2) A Brand New Smile:**

1. The same scene we've seen of Kong leaving his mother behind, but where before he seemed cool and uncaring, only caring for his future and destination, [here we see him crying for his abandoned past and childhood](http://i.imgur.com/RsBCw4U.jpg). A *child*, alone.

1. The small chatter amongst the upperclassmen - "Oh boy, you get to work in a convenience store. I'm so jealous! I get to go to college!" - "You don't know how rough it is, man" coupled with Peco, "Wandering Hairdo Dude", Kazama, and last episode with Coach's little speech about how "Talented people who know themselves never crave anything." - Everyone here is looking for something, everyone is unhappy with their current lot.

 And Smile? Supposedly he cares for nothing, [but look at him staring at the retreating backs of his upperclassmen](http://i.imgur.com/4gWUAdv.jpg), after he just finished running, and ended right where he began, and after we know of his dream of being like Peco. Smile has desires, and they are to have emotions, to be part of a group, even as he rejects it, in order to protect himself. The Hedgehog's dilemma. Or perhaps, he just looks at those so unlike him as to be a different species.

1. [Smile moving the practice, being into it](http://i.imgur.com/ZnzgkDp.jpg). How things had changed. So, what is it Smile wishes for? Or is it just to play ping pong?

1. Smile gained a Father-Coach, and Kong had lost one. Kong is moving mechanically. No change, no emotions, no friendship. Will he be able to grow like this? Or perhaps quieting down his emotions is what he needs.

**3) Alone in the Crowd:**

1. ["There is no "team" in this club anymore."](http://i.imgur.com/0sR7ttS.jpg) - Very interesting. Notice what was said before, Smile can't play against other schools on his own, so his fellow team-mates have to play against schools out of their league. Either Smile, or the rest of them will suffer. One for all, or all for one, but not both - one or the other will have to sacrifice for the others. You can't get better playing against people infinitely superior to you, but you also can't get better by smashing those infinitely inferior to you.

 "He's the one man-army, and we collect the balls." The warrior who can defeat a hundred men, and his standard bearers.

1. This conversation made me think of Kaio academy. Kazama is thinking of his school, he's thinking of his team - but he's not thinking of his *teammates*, who actually *make up* the team. Is he there for them? His victories give the whole school a reputation, and they're not really doing anything for him, but the school still thinks of itself as a team, including its constituent members. Kazama's little speech is a bit problematic here, even if it's born out of love, a tough love, to his disciples.

 And here, [Kazama's trusty lieutenant tells him as much.](http://i.imgur.com/eIs0NdK.jpg)

1. "Clinging to old ideals in time of crisis. Winter will come soon." With the birds, and the flowers. Is this a haiku writing primer? Not literally, but in terms of style. Also, [notice how Kazama already speaks of Sakuma as a has-been](http://i.imgur.com/wZLxP9R.jpg). And that is why Sakuma is going to try and defeat Smile, to show their club still has what it takes. [It is all about honour](http://i.imgur.com/3zXbuem.jpg).

**4) Best Coach - A coach for life, a *life-coach*:**

1. Man, the coaches in this show are so awesome, "Is this guy good?" - ["Any art gallery running an exhibit about "Awkwardness" would snap him right up."](http://i.imgur.com/6Jq2kNN.jpg) The coach's daughter? To me she's not bored, [but going to sleep with the soothing sound of her father talking of what he loves](http://i.imgur.com/BQnweVQ.jpg) - Ping Pong, [and his *students*.](http://i.imgur.com/oBTuMPt.jpg)

1. Here it is, "But table tennis is a sport where natural talent really matters." - Sakuma wanted to be like Peco, who was all talent and no effort, and then Kazama, who's talent honed by endless hard work. But what Sakuma wishes for is something he can never have, as he doesn't have talent himself.

1. Interesting. Kaio's coach has a strong team, with an ultra-strong player, and would be fine with less victories, so long they feel like home. Coach Koizumi has an ultra-strong player, and a weak team, and chooses the player over the team.

**5) Showdown and Truth:**

1. [Samurai Showdown visuals](http://i.imgur.com/GA9bQDq.jpg), and soundtrack. I've told you guys this show, especially when Sakuma is involved, is a samurai show/manga, using Ping Pong. Well, here it is, out in the open.

1. Ah, now it explains why Kazama was talking of Sakuma in a past tense, ["If I lose, I'll be expelled from the club immediately."](http://i.imgur.com/cjELCjP.jpg) - So it's not about the rules, it's about *power*. Should Sakuma win, he'd get to stay in the club. It not being about the rules also explains why Kazama's lieutenant was saying he should be allowed to stay.

1. I really wonder how it'd turn out - not wanting to destroy another's dream of Ping Pong is perhaps why Smile had lost to Kong, but this is a new Smile, much more driven to victory, or is he?

1. [Shinsegumi](http://i.imgur.com/FR2fq62.jpg), committing [seppuku](http://i.imgur.com/8N8XTn1.jpg) more samurai show notions! It's more than that - he left on his own to defend the honour of his dojo, so if he loses, he'll have to sacrifice himself so his dojo won't end up even more shame-faced than it'd been prior.

1. Honestly, my favourite part about Sakuma, and which I really loved when he and Peco faced off, [is their trash-talk](http://i.imgur.com/SBAtMgH.jpg), the checks their mouths write and which they can't cover. Smile is like Kong here, [reflective glasses](http://i.imgur.com/yxgCoAK.jpg), no emotions. One does not converse with the bugs one is about to crush.

1. The breakdown. [Everything he cries out, I've covered above](http://i.imgur.com/rkZhMCl.jpg). Yes, this is his role in the story, this is his burden. No matter how hard he works, no matter how long he chases after acknowledgement, he just wasn't born good enough. Why do we see his childhood? No, it's not because he has some inborn "fault" of stigmatization that keeps him from winning, but that he doesn't have the inborn talent. He keeps chasing after others, but he has a loving father, and his childhood didn't seem too bad. But that is life, chasing after that which you do not have.

**6) Consequences - As We Begin, So We Close:**

1. Smile replies the only way he can, [with a truth-bomb](http://i.imgur.com/lsmvzMB.jpg). Perhaps Smile truly is merciful - he's dashing Sakuma's dream which he could never realize, so he could go after something he *might* obtain. Is this why he spared Kong, whose dream follows his talent, even if not its scope?

 I truly think Smile simply saying it, [especially considering Sakuma's shocked mien](http://i.imgur.com/sl17bK5.jpg), is an act of kindness, rather than one of cruelty.

1. [Sakuma's life sentence](http://i.imgur.com/Jp1BlZ1.jpg), is it written out in the form of stitches on his samurai cloak, or as thorns and brambles, to tear his soul apart?

1. Hm, Peco throwing away his racket, and it's only the 5th episode? I'm surprised. I'm almost certain he'll pick it up again, or at least have some discussion with Smile, some witty one-liner that'll change everything. Also, "Goodbye, partner." - Is he talking of the racket, or of Smile?

**Post Episode Notes:**

This episode hammered the final nails into the "Talent versus Effort" coffin. Peco and Sakuma are both kids, and we could see how similar they are in attitude when they faced off against one another. Both wanted to prove something with their Ping Pong, and both had been *lacking*. One was all talent and no effort, and one was all effort and no talent. In the long run, effort beats lazy talent, but neither can stand up to the places where talent and effort combine.

More than that, this episode was about the situation of being alone at the top. Does Kazama wish for Smile to join Kaio for the sake of Kaio, or so he won't be alone? A case of "One for all, or all for one?" and these superstars being put out there. Why do Smile, Kong and Kazama play? Kong plays so he could return home, to the home his game had driven him out of. Why does Kaio play? Is he trying to make a new home, a home for people such as himself? And what of Smile?

They all play for the same reason. They play because they can use their rackets to hold discussions. But only with their equals. They all play so they'll get to the highest levels, where others such as them exist, others who could understand their lonely existences, and in so doing perhaps alleviate the sense of loneliness. They fight, because through their rackets, they can have a dialogue, and they are all oh so hungry for it.

Late to the discussion but better late than never!

 Wow, that was one of your longest write ups yet but I guess this episode was worthy since it packed a lot of themes, events and symbolism into every minute. Very good read nonetheless. In regards to Smile to 'truth-bombing' Sakuma, I don't really think it was out of kindness. I see how it could be and it may very well be the best thing to say to him given that he really should just give up all hope at this point but I think it was more of him not caring enough to avoid the question whatsoever. He could've answered "Because I'm out of your league" or something like that which would be true but not as straightforward but I think he just immediately said the most accurate answer he could. Either way it was a great line and I feel it really needed to be said. He had quite an ego to come all the way down and challenge him and it served him right that he got floored.

> You can't get better playing against people **infinitely superior** to you, but you also can't get better by smashing those infinitely inferior to you.

Little exaggerated. 

They should be enjoying the benefits of going up against better schools, they're too busy focusing on the fact that they're playing better schools because of Smile. Stood around talking and eating ice lollies, yet complaining that they have to play better schools because of Smile's talent. The fact that Smile is putting enormous amounts of effort into Ping Pong is going over their heads, it should be a wake up call for them. They're complaining that they're losing *because* of Smile, when they're hardly putting in their best effort to attain victory.

You can improve by playing against people who are better at the game. As you can in most sports. Playing against anyone is better than playing against nobody. Peco would have been a much better player if Smile had actually fought him from a young age with his full potential, playing against better people allows you to analyse their plays first hand and pick up good habits. Playing someone good *repetitively* is even better.

Of course they're going to get smashed for a while, but with the right motivation, and an actual good amount of effort, anyone can level the playing field somewhat, and even surpass the better players. I've done it myself.

Great write up by the way :)

Another strong episode of Ping Pong. Once again a timeskip, seeing as Kazuma has won national tournament to qualify for Youth Olympics, and it has changed Smile. I don't know if I missed anything, but I'm wondering what exactly made Smile change his mind about things. First he lets Wenge win on purpose, and now he crushes Sakuma without even showing a hint of remorse knowing the consequences he'll face for losing. A flashback is mandatory, and I'm betting my money that it is because he once again went to visit his coach.

Sakuma's rage because of his exchange with Smile, Peco's indifference to everything he once hold so dear and Kazuma's calculated outburst on TV - Ping Pong surely has risen above expectations I dare say, and most certainly has been one-upping itself every episode so far.

I don't feel sorry for Sakuma, but I also didn't want to see him fail per se. The same goes for Peco really. Ping Pong isn't trying to play on emotions, it's merely showing the hard reality of how life works. Not everyone can be a winner, and people interpret who is a winner as they like to. For Kazuma it is the result that counts, for his coach it is the journey. Neither are wrong, both are right in their own idea, but they don't work together as an ideal as they're build on different foundations.

Peco's a supporter of the first theory. He used to be a winner, and now he's out of the game. He never cared about the road he traveled, he kept glancing towards the horizon hoping to catch a glimpse of the destination.
Smile on the other hand wasn't a believer of either theory. He simply didn't care about the concept of winning or losing, it was 'an activity' and results were 'an outcome'. Both participating and the results that ensued were meaningless as the memories of them weren't meant to be treasured, they were merely and simply there, waiting to be forgotten. Now however results count, shown by his lack of empathy towards Sakuma when telling him he's not fit out for the job even after all his work, and that he should finish the game or leave instead of holding up his scheduled training regime.

I can't deny that Ping Pong took me by surprise this week. The visuals effects were once again sublime, just as the content has shown itself to be a masterfully done at portraying the depths of human reasoning but the story itself is solid and every episode feels natural, as a step towards the right direction, a part of the journey - a step towards the final destination we hope to catch a glimpse of.

|  I'm wondering what exactly made Smile change his mind about things.

Someone mentioned in the last 

week, and I agree with, was that the turning point for Smile was after Peco got thrashed by Sakuma. In that moment he realised that his "handicapped" play did not help Peco improve, and that the reality of it caused Peco to suffer.

The issue here, though, is that he has now taken the extreme opposite side in an effort to compensate: why go through all the pain and suffering and effort only to crash at the end? Let me end it for you right here, by showing you why you will never be good enough. I feel that Smile sees this as a form of mercy-killing.
>> ARTICLE
That's an interesting way of looking at it. And it's a good theory, but I still feel that a flashback to Smile visiting the coach's house is warranted because a storyline built on insinuation feels a bit sloppy.
>> ARTICLE
That Shinsengumi exchange was next level. Everything about this show is perfect.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the Shinsengumi references.

For once, all of my Gintama binges have some use! Kaio's coach as Kondo and Kazama as Hijikata are absolutely perfect, Sakuma as Okita is rather ironic because Okita is known as a prodigy of his craft, just as Sakuma is not.

Something about this show [COMPELS ME TO WRITE.](http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/05/09/ping-pong-episode-5/) This time I rambled a bit about the wonderful scene transitions all through the first half, and of course how this show is about so much more than ping pong.

Nice post. Subtler stuff like transition shot selection always go over my head completely, so it's cool to read about.

It almost has nothing to do with Ping Pong. Its all about life and living. Ping Pong is just the setting... could very well have just been tennis, bowling, or equestrian. Definitely not a sports anime, despite the name.

Ah man, I love this show.

Did anyone notice the ending was different?
>> ARTICLE
Smile and Peco are tue opposites . Smile simply enjoyed the sport and lacked the drive to win, while I doubt that Peco actually enjoyed playing , just winning .

I think for Peco to move forward Peco has to discover the passion for the sport, which won't let him give up on it So easily . 

It 's ironic. Sakuma is the only One who Plays Ping pong without Ulterior motives, Yee he's the least talented. Everyone plays for a different reason only Sakuma plays because he wants to be a great player

If he loses he will be expelled from the Table Tennis club?

Doesn't sound like a big deal right, but to most of these characters (excluding Smile), Ping Pong is their life, and its almost equivalent to a death sentence. Let the suffering begin!

That's probably not a game of thrones reference. It's a fairly common statement with some fairly universal meaning. I've seen that sentence in plenty of things that predate Game of Thrones, sometimes used literally, sometimes figuratively.

The line is [from the manga](http://i.imgur.com/IHeCvuv.png) which was released the game year as the first ASOIAF book, so the chances of it being a reference is effectively 0.

Fuck it, Obaba x Peco is my new OTP

Also, has anyone else noticed that Peco's gum in the OP has been changing color? This episode it was light blue, but before it used to be bright pink.

Post-ep notes:

- Well, we finally got Kazama's backstory, and it was pretty much exactly as I suspected - he's carrying the sins of his father on this back, and using the power of his ping pong to lift. He believes there are no heroes, as expected. 

- I can't help but think Koizumi's choice to throw the match to Ryu was incredibly disrespectful. And as Obaba pointed out, that's his fatal flaw - he cares too much. It was the same flaw as Smile's, one that he tried to push away when he took on Akuma. 

- Cycles, huh? It seems like the show is forshadowing Peco and Smile's conflict as a redux of Ryu Kazama and Jo Koizumi's match; Peco has a knee tape just like Ryu had. Will Smile be able to make the choice that Koizumi couldn't? To not be timid, and grasp his destiny at the expense of others? 

I just...there are too many feelings. Shit. What the hell, Yuasa - stop making me *feel* so much for this show :(

Oh well. It's not every season I get two 10/10 shows. 



>> ARTICLE
Funny how the last three shows I've watched have had "cycles" as a strong theme. First Psycho Pass and Sword Of The Stranger, Psycho Pass as a series has scenes in the first and last episode which are almost identical, and in Sword Of A Stranger, if you've seen it you'll know about two particular scenes from the beginning and end involving a horse that are yin and yang to one another. It's such a beautiful storytelling technique, although sad at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, good work on the comparison of Jo and Ryu with Tsukimoto and Peco. 
With the knee tape, and as Tsukimoto pointed out while they were on the ferris wheel. He knows how to beat an opponent with that flaw. But then again is it too much to "spoil" so early in the series. Like do we already know that they are going to play and its going to be up to Smile to be kind hearted or not..
>> ARTICLE
I think that there's been too much foreshadowing and discussion of Smile's unfortunate "kindness" to not resolve it with Peco's match. Furthermore, to NOT make Smile's kindness figure into the climax would kind of make the whole sequence involving Koizumi. worthless.
>> ARTICLE
What's the other 10/10 show?
>> ARTICLE
*Mushishi: Zoku Shou* is fighting pretty hard for my top spot. 
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed Kazama's backstory. Everyone last week was talking about how he was cold and distant but I was hoping there was something else behind him. And there is. 

This show is just... incredible. On so many levels. Everyone's backstory is interesting and revealed at a good pace, and the analysis that can be put into each episode is insane.

Peco's knee injury and his rivalry with Smile seems a little similar to the Coach's story...
>> ARTICLE
I can already see the ending.

Peco is training hard to be #1, whereas Smile doesn't have that. He's just someone who enjoys table tennis. Plus the obvious comparison with the story of Butterfly Jo. Peco will become a hero and defeat Smile. It's also what the kids on the train were talking about in episode 6... Only the hero can beat the robot or something like that.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree I'm thinking Smile isn't going to make the same mistake as coach and is going to go all out, but so will Peco and he will win. Maybe. Seems like his leg might become an issue though.
>> ARTICLE
That's how Smile wants it. He wants to sacrifice himself so that Peco can be great, because Peco was the one thing that made life tolerable growing up. He sees himself as indebted to Peco. At least that's how it seems at the moment.
>> ARTICLE
Seems like such blatant foreshadowing. At least they're still in high school, so a loss wouldn't ruin their potential careers... I think.
>> ARTICLE
That wasn't the career ruining part, I think. The reason coach didn't play agressively across the table is that it would put strain on the hurt knee and do more damage. Instead of a 6-months recovery it would be a career ending injury.
>> ARTICLE
I think /u/deirox meant that it wouldn't ruin Smile's career if he lost.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that was a great episode. We finally get to see smile become a little more human again. And then we see Wenge not only teaching the game, but still wanting to beat kazuma, and trying as hard as he can.

But what about Peco eh? The kid has got his grove back and even better. Its a good key plot about his reverse penhold backhand (RPB). I've mentioned it before in older posts but the fact they mentioned him being able to switch from forehand to it so quickly is a sign of his improved strength. The the carbon fiber blade to put his rubbers on, never expected that. You can see how the show has moved with the times as I don't think the carbon fiber blades were out back when the material was written

But I fear for poor Peco's knee :(
>> ARTICLE
RBP is also relatively recent style. Most penholders back in the day used to just block and push on their backhand.
>> ARTICLE
I also don't think they had ping pong robots when the source material was written either ;)
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, I think the technology was primitive, but the style they had is way to advance and futuristic. Ball Machines can only feed you balls, not return the same ball
>> ARTICLE
So we finally get an explanation of that [butterfly man](http://i.imgur.com/Pto3VZB.jpg) image we've seen popping up throughout the season. Makes me want to re-watch this whole series to see what else starts to click after it's explained further in. 

The legend of Butterfly Joe seems like it might be repeating itself, given Peco's knee injury... 
>> ARTICLE
if you watch episode 2 again, you'll see a lot of butterflies in the match between Kozumi and Smile. He even has one on his chest.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is great at humanizing its cast without lingering too long, laying the sap on too thick or condescending to its audience. 
>> ARTICLE
URGH. Why is Ping Pong so damned good. Great episode. 

However, I'm starting to get afraid of a repeat in history. They're foreshadowing it, what with Peco's knee, Koizumi asking Smile if he could have ended his friend's career, etc.

I think Smile and Peco might re-enact what happened between Koizumi and Ryui Kaio, and that would really suck. 


>> ARTICLE
Last week had had an episode about being a part, and being apart. About teams and loneliness, and how to be with someone, to be with a group, then both sides must be willing - you need to reach a hand, and have the other side accept it for friendship, or it's a long fight ahead.

Peco is back for Ping Pong, for he remembered not only his dream, but that he had one. He also reminisced of old Smile - is part of his goal to fulfill Smile's dream, by being someone for him to aspire to? Hm.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) Training Your Guts Out:**

1. The episode opens with Kong, teaching techniques to his friends, without technology, and Kazama - alone, selling the superiority of technology, of relying on others' skills and effort. No, he doesn't believe it, but that's the image he is selling.

1. [Poor Peco](http://i.imgur.com/4QwP5qg.jpg), the old lady is [running him ragged](http://i.imgur.com/tmK9xAE.jpg). Poor Peco? He's getting not just [what he asked fo](http://i.imgur.com/HWv36xv.jpg)r, but what he *wished* for. Immanuel Kant had said that those who want something also [want what it entails](http://i.imgur.com/YqsanES.jpg) - you can't wish for something without wishing for its required conditions, and for its required outcomes.

1. "When am I going to play Ping Pong? I want to get my instincts back ASAP!" - Silly Peco. First you become someone who can play, whose muscles are *capable* of having instincts, and acting out on what they see they need to do ("Shit, I can't get to the ball!") and then you can play. You asked the old lady last episode to teach you Ping Pong *from the beginning*, didn't you? Part of what she's teaching you again is that there are no shortcuts, and demanding that you *prove* your drive, your dedication.

1. This isn't about *fun*, Peco - Ping-Pong is serious business, and if you succeed, [you might even get a little kiss](http://i.imgur.com/7gr7Wyn.jpg) ;-)

**2) Smile and Others:**

1. [Everyone just messing around, having fun](http://i.imgur.com/8jUPcwV.jpg) - because to them Ping Pong isn't serious business. [Smile looking from the outside in](http://i.imgur.com/bRDZeVj.jpg) (looking like an Agent from The Matrix). Does he want to play along?

1. [Koizumi, looking forlorn](http://i.imgur.com/UGH7KHk.jpg), even as the enemy coach tries to poach his best player, who reinvigorated him.

1. [This is Peco, in a nutshell](http://i.imgur.com/7Y5Tirl.jpg). When he wins, he's all smiles and love. But he can't handle losing, or putting in the work.

1. The phrasing here matters. "In terms of Smile's future, it's a very clever idea." - But that doesn't mean he likes it, not one bit.

1. Oooh, all the imagery of butterflies when Koizumi spoke. [He's "Butterfly Jo"](http://i.imgur.com/ow5aKbe.jpg). Yes, adults have or had heroes as well.

**3) Why Do We Fight?**

1. "There are many reasons to play ping pong, aside from for money and success." and then we see Kazama's history, where his father or grandfather died alone, with people denigrating him for not succeeding. That had apparently left a mark on young Kazama. He has no heroes, including not his family - no one to look up to. His is a solitary existence, governed not by what he wants to be, but by what he does *not* wish to be.

1. Kazama's coach isn't worried about his weaker players, as he said before - they are driven. [He's worried about Kazama](http://i.imgur.com/AgdojgP.jpg). Kazama who is empty inside, who is going for a "future", without believing in it. [Kazama has no heroes](http://i.imgur.com/BBAz2qc.jpg). He lives a post-modernist existence, with the "death of the father", with the death of God. There is only himself he can rely on.

1. This scene has several layers. Smile as opposed to his image - [he has feelings](http://i.imgur.com/WbjzFUA.jpg), not just that he can feel happiness or be depressed, but that he cares what others feel, and doesn't enjoy being hated. One can be happy and depressed, while still not being affected by the same things others are - but no, Smile doesn't want to go to Kaio, where he got one of them ousted. He has feelings [*just like everyone else*.](http://i.imgur.com/pcPwB6l.jpg)

 That sentence actually refers to how the scene opened as well - feeling abandoned by his coach, and feeling grateful that his coach is thinking of his best interests. Smile can appreciate these things.

 And the final meaning of this scene is that unlike Peco, [Smile is driven to train on his own](http://i.imgur.com/VPGYKnZ.jpg). But why? He's not driven by the thought of "success", unlike Kazama. It's because unlike Kazama, he believes in heroes. One would say that he wishes to *become* said Hero, but after last episode, I think he will want to be the strongest monster, so a hero will arise, or alternately, even if he's not a hero, he will pose as one, instead of the absent hero.

**4) Learning The World Isn't Easy:**

1. Old Lady's son is a national-level coach, cool.

1. Peco introduces himself, "Fast offense", and then we see him immediately after [complain about how harsh his training is](http://i.imgur.com/zFAai48.jpg), how *fast* it is. Peco has a strength, but he's only strong compared to those who lack skill or talent. He has talent, he has *potential*, which is recognized, but he has little else.

 ["Don't hit with your guts! *Look*!"](http://i.imgur.com/Ou6qW6T.jpg) - See, he has to unlearn relying on his talent. He has to learn how to do things properly, and then he could also power it up with his talent. No shortcuts, only hard work.

1. "Smile ran away. I tried to be considerate, but" - "[That's why people run away from you.](http://i.imgur.com/Y8waLm6.jpg)" - Old people who know one another. No dancing around the issue. Being with other people is hard.

 "You're always acting timid, worried about how they *feel*. That's the hardest attitude for them to deal with." When you can't deal with your feelings, you also can't deal with others dealing with them. When people are always considerate of you, you must consider yourself, and also be considerate of them.

1. ["If you love him, then don't act timidly, but *act*."](http://i.imgur.com/N6cpx35.jpg) - I see now. The problem is Koizumi is forcing the other side to act first, to say how they feel, he confronts them with their feelings. He should just envelope them and let them feel *his* love, and act on it. Spoken like the true Old Lady, and how she treats Peco ;-)

 But, isn't how she says Koizumi is acting is sort of how Smile is towards Peco? Hm.

1. "If you won't give him any loving, get out of his life." - Man, this sentence. *Maaaan*. You can write whole books about it.

1. Did Smile "run away"? [He feels like Forrest Gump here](http://i.imgur.com/C9Bp4vq.jpg), who *did* run away. Feels like he's giving it his all, letting his energy be sapped away.

1. "I'll smack you (next time you make me worry so much)" - That's a form of love, and waiting for Smile is a form of love as well. And Smile responds! ["Yes, my coach!"](http://i.imgur.com/Yvn4RUb.jpg) :o

**5) Duty Bound Freaks - Preparing for Showdown:**

1. Hm. Kazama is trying to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders. But he doesn't think of himself as a hero. He sees himself as being beholden to duty, of making it up for his predecessor's weakness, of doing what he must. He doesn't enjoy life.

1. [His 2nd in command is so duty-bound as well](http://i.imgur.com/whZmgVR.jpg), so very stiff. I almost thought he'd present the flowers as if they came from Ryuichi. So, he calls Kazama "A table-tennis obsessed freak", as the 2nd in command in a place where that is the whole point. He thinks Yurie likes Kazama due to Ping-Pong? "I'll defeat you and then take her from you." - He wishes to leave Kazama with nothing, or to leave him Ping Pong and take the girl - I think Kazama might be fine with it

1. [Sad Butterfly Jo](http://i.imgur.com/i22oUN4.jpg), and I thought this scene before was about Smile. Now I see - "Don't go easy on your opponent, no one wins in a game like that!" - He went easy on his opponent, and in so doing he also robbed himself of the will to win, *forever*, and his old friend probably wasn't overjoyed either. Truly feels like someone ready for a duel for life and glory.

1. Oh, Kazama Ryu, the rich man, is Coach Koizumi's old friend, his old rival. One match, to decide the fate of two men. Samurai battles again?

1. Old Lady's son remembers Peco from long ago, in the Dojo. But his excited narration of his talents, skills, and progress - it's like watching Speedwagon or Stroheim from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure :P

1. Heh, [Peco's siblings](http://i.imgur.com/2vFwWEa.jpg). When Smile passed Peco earlier and the kids tried to wake him up, I wondered if it's an illusion, since they all had Peco's face :D

1. Hm. Smile training with another player, and Kong training with a robot, against Kazama. With a robot, with Smile? Hee. Ota worried needlessly, [he looked like someone heading to the gallows](http://i.imgur.com/DA6Oyin.jpg) - He plays ping-pong for fun, but being crushed isn't fun.

**Post Episode Thoughts:**

Another good episode. Peco is made to earn his progress, and Smile admits to having feelings, and is confronted by them. We see some more of Kazama's past, of his *burden*. He doesn't play tennis for a dream, and he doesn't play tennis for fun. He plays tennis for honour and duty, and not his own. He plays because he must.

This episode isn't as much about themes as it's about confronting one's past, and building for the future. It's playing the beat of "growth", for the challenges and fights that are to come.

This is the first episode of Ping Pong that I can't say was the best episode so far. It was by no means a bad episode, in fact it was a pretty great episode, but it was a training episode. We learned Coach's backstory, and we saw everyone progress. We even got a bit of character progress on many of the main characters. But there was no defining moments like with the previous episodes.

Smile won't hold back even against Peco's knee, because there's a reason Smile has been trying to win even though he doesn't care about competition.

He wants to believe that Peco is the invincible hero, yet at the same time, he's too pessimistic to believe in heroes. He wants to resolve this conflict one way or the other, with his own hands. It's what this show is building towards.

Another fantastic episode. The music this week was mostly recurring pieces from older episodes, but I thought they fit in really well. There's something about those electronic pieces delicately building in the background that really does it for me. It's not the kind of music that often turns up in anime soundtracks, but it's very welcome.

Those scenes between Koizumi and Smile were really nice. Smile is vulnerable, and after Coach hurt his feelings they've come to a new understanding. In return, Koizumi opened up about his past and we now understand more about his intentions and motivations in coaching Smile. We've seen Smile alone for so many episodes now that it's nice to see him have someone on his side, and maybe someone who can even act as a father figure to him. Though of course tough times are ahead for him with all of that injured Peco foreshadowing in the episode...

The OP and ED of this show come second to none.

Lol, everyone is so worried about that knee. Can we all just take a moment and realize that it's SEVEN episodes in and they are just showing Peco (a main character) with the ability to improve? Clearly the writers of this show are not going to spoil a major climax with this blatant foreshadowing. At most, I would have to say that it'll be a minor climax that brings Peco and Smile together.

In the flashback in Episode 2 when as a kid Smile said he wanted to be like Peco, I don't think he meant in terms of skill and talent. I don't think he saw him as a hero in that way either. I think for him, to be like Peco is to love and enjoy Ping Pong. Smile probably did enjoy Ping Pong but as he watched Peco's passion for the sport fade way so did his enjoyment along with it.

What I think Smile is playing for and chasing after is that enjoyment for the sport that he used to share with Peco.

It's a pretty amazing show, this. Engaging and has a lot more depth than I first expected. Really impressed.

With Peco now firmly sits in the protagonist seat, and his face off against Smile inevitable. Wouldn't it be great if he can exact his revenge against Kaio by beating Dragon?

Though where does China sit in this whole scheme of things though?
>> ARTICLE
Obaba is best girl. 

Great episode despite the distinct lack of Wenge. Still though, loving how we are moving to the climax of the season, but still introducing new characters and subplots. It will be interesting to see how Kazama's love triangle will affect his play, if at all. Kazama and Smile are a direct comparison to Koizumi and Kazama senior, but I'm expecting more than just a revenge of sorts. 

Koizumi wasn't as considerate as Smile in the game he lost and I think this is something we'll build on. Koizumi changed his game out of consideration, whereas Smile simply stops trying. Finding a middle ground, another path is what I think we'll find here. 

Side notes:

Eyebrow-san is going to be a thorn for someone. 

Peco is cool as shit when he's not annoying. I hope he becomes a genuine rival as a representation of what being able to change (or go through a metamorphosis if you will) can lead to. 

This show needs more Wenge. Guy is fucking cool as shit. I want to see another karaoke scene like the ones in [*Only God Forgives*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK0iQyEt24A). 

**TL;DR Great episode, lacking Wenge**

At the end I thought she went to visit Sanada in his room, then I relook and she was back at her house... and there were flowers outside the room. So I assume Kazama left them there. Aww he's a little puppy inside as well.

I just want to say that I'm watching Mushishi Zokushou, Mekakucity Actors, but this season's anime has got to be Ping Pong the Animation. The art, the symbolism, the burning feeling of youth.  I loved Tekkon Kinkreet and this is just a brilliant combination of Masaaki Yuasa's style with Taiyo Matsumoto's original manga.  I love it. And this just keeps getting better.

>> ARTICLE
honestly...i doubt there is an anime with better animation than this..they are so realistic. 

Am i wrong?
>> ARTICLE
Its hard to call it the "Best". Best can be very subjective, and in animation I dont think it is necessarily a good idea to pin one thing as "Best". Compare Ping pong to something like Redline and Its hard to say definitively which is better (animation, not plot-wise)  

I think it is better to measure a show's animation by it's appropriateness, in which case I would say Ping Pong's animation is pretty darn appropriate.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the scene where Wenge and his translator were just analysing the entire match just by the sound while making badass poses, accurately, unlike the verdict of the Hoshino/Tsukimoto matchup given by the captain at their own club.

Oh and then they are like: THE WIND MAKES IT TOO HARD TO HEAR!

A nice little touch was the [ball going up in the air](http://i.imgur.com/dccG51j.png) changing to a [plane](http://i.imgur.com/pkWrfw4.png), right before Wenge bitterly reminisces about his own country.

Also, you mentioned on twitter that they changed the coach? How so?

> Yeah, the "The wind makes it too hard to hear" line was actually kind of hilarious. 

It was an unexpected humor and I liked it. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, from the 2002 movie version, haven't read the manga, but I assume its the same there.

The Coach was younger, more eccentric, rigorous and very invested in making sure Smile doesn't waste his talents.

Not saying the current coach can't fulfill this role, perhaps it was an intentional change. Also, that angry guy at their club? He wasn't present, maybe he will take the role of the coach from the film?

Another change was the fact that Smile is playing that Gameboy thing, in the movie he was constantly preoccupied with a Rubik's Cube.

There was one other change I can't mention which is extremely spoilerific.
>> ARTICLE
I just read through the first 4 chapters of the manga and the anime seems more accurate than the movie based on your description. The biggest changes I noticed was Rubik's Cube to video game and 21 point to 11 for victory (which is a change to the actual game a number of years ago).
>> ARTICLE
They only played up to 11 points because Peco got skunked. In a 21 point game they only play up to 11 if one person has zero points. [skunk rule](http://tabletennis.about.com/od/glossary/g/skunk_rule.htm)

[ITTF Handbook](http://www.ittf.com/ittf_handbook/ittf_hb.html) 2.11.01

That is the new rule, yes. When the manga came out the rule was still 21 points with the skunking clause as the post above mentioned.

[In the manga](http://i.imgur.com/d8MU9XH.jpg) the game goes to 21 points, which was my original point. Also I don't think Skunk was ever an official rule.
>> ARTICLE
In that case, you are correct. Apologies if I misunderstood your post.
>> ARTICLE
The movie's decision to use a rubik's cube is pretty interesting. It's a more classic studious-nerd/perfectionist motif. On the other hand the gameboy emphasizes Smile's slacker non-confrontational personality. It'll be cool to see how closely the anime follows the manga and whether that pays off in the end.

It's pretty articulate Beijing Mandarin, so I'd assume he is fluent.

He's [from China](http://myanimelist.net/people/29835/Yousei_Bun), so that isn't a surprise. His native tongue might be Cantonese, though, since he is from Guangdong Province.
>> ARTICLE
It sounds pretty damn authentic 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that might be it. There's something about his Mandarin that's just a tiny bit off, so it's probably the Cantonese influence. Listening to Wenge and his interpreter makes me so grateful that the Mandarin in Ping Pong is good, unlike Night Raid. Now *that* was an ear sore. 
>> ARTICLE
Came here to mention that "tiny bit off" quality too. My Chinese listening skills are fairly good (but not perfect) and I was detecting this sort of clipped, abrupt quality to his words and lilting in the tones. Couldn't tell whether he was actually speaking strangely or whether I was hearing things - good to get confirmation from others online though.

Not much of a problem at all, though. If anything, I think it contributes to China's character - the fast style of speaking is in line with is brusque, arrogant temperament and the lilting has this sort of oddly compelling rhythmic quality to it. 
>> ARTICLE
For what it's worth, all Chinese walla in Night Raid was spoken by actual Chinese voice actors. The seiyuu for the main characters actually had a Chinese language coach, but I guess there's only so much you can do with a language you don't actually speak (and that is so different from your first language).
>> ARTICLE
It's hilarious to hear the normal Chinese by the soldiers first and then that horrible ones by the main characters as they tries to infiltrate. Where's the immersion?
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah, but I guess here's where suspension of disbelief comes in... :D After all they're also supposed to be fluent in English, German and Russian, no seiyuu could pull that off .
>> ARTICLE
Wenge's voice work is really expressive and complements the writing beautifully - you can hear the disdain dripping from his voice.

While I'm not a good player, I've played a fair bit of ping pong and the dialogue they throw around is quite accurate - no crazy made-up techniques, just fundamentals. The ping pong animation is likewise very true to life, IMO - the footwork, the movement, the sounds.

The scene where Wenge and his translator are judging the two players from sound alone seems like fiction, and it's probably exaggerated some extent, but you can definitely evaluate different kinds of shots by the sound of the impact. For example, flat hits make a sharp thunk and topspin and chops each have their distinctive sounds as well.

Yuusa's done his homework, and I'm expecting a brilliant show.
>> ARTICLE
Ex ping pong player here.  
I thought the match between Wenge and Hoshino was fairly real. Chinese professional players are above japanase ones. I imagine myself playing against a chinese player and the same would've happened. About the sounds, a bit exaggerated but accurate enough.
>> ARTICLE
They made a note in the credits that they consulted the Japanese Table Tennis Association for various aspects of the show. 

Also, while I don't doubt Yuasa did research of his own, remember this is adapted from a 1996 manga series. The author did most of the legwork for them, probably!
>> ARTICLE
The thing about Masaaki Yuasa is that you can immediately tell that his direction simply oozes with confidence.

Common problems that most anime productions face- sloppiness in editing, pacing, color timing, composition- he makes them seem *trivial*. They just aren't an issue. Combine that type of direction with a confident, self-respecting source material completely dry of common anime slip-ups, and you get something of the likes of **Ping Pong**.

Writers, take note: there wasn't any burdensome exposition, and we were introduced to a diverse cast of characters with varying ambitions and perspectives, a mess of scattered conflicts that aren't black and white, and banter that is sharp, witty, and developed the characterizations. That's the type of excellence I like seeing in my anime.

It's a little too early to say that it's better than Yuasa's previous work, but with just this episode you can tell that *Ping Pong* is already on another level from the rest of the season. I'm looking forward to it.

Could you elaborate on this a little? It's been over the top praise similar to this that's caused me to approach Ping Pong with apprehension.  

>Ping Pong is already on another level from the rest of the season. I'm looking forward to it.

Praise so effusive feels almost satirical. Is Ping Pong flawless so far? That's what I'm lead to believe by your comment and others.  

>> ARTICLE
Not the person you are responding to but let me add my 2 cents.

Yuasa seems to treat anime more like a medium than a genre. He doesn't care about various stylistic criteria like whether the eyes should be tsurime or tareme and just overwrites it with his own distinctive style using the frames as canvas for his imagination. 

In that sense his shows are closer to western indie/art productions that tap into animation as a means to be even less artistically constrained than a live movie (on a small budget). I do not claim that his work is perfect, but it definitely stands out and he is very proficient as a director.
>> ARTICLE
That was fantastically synthesized. I easily gained as much from your answer as /u/temp9123's in far fewer words. 

>Yuasa seems to treat anime more like a medium than a genre.

There needs to be more of this. Off the top of your head, can you think of any other directors/studios/etc. that are known for doing this?

I'm trying to get a group together to watch Monster. I've seen some episodes but never finished it. What I saw was fantastic. 

Kaiba though...I could not abide by that art style. Is there any rationale behind that art style choice? Like I said for Ping Pong, it's art style allows for dynamic ping pong sequences and extremely expressive faces during close-ups. It's weakness is showing full body shots, which make people look blob-like. As for Kaiba, *everything* looked bad. Through 3 episodes I didn't find a single instance where Kaiba benefited from it's art style. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Your justification for Kaiba's art style sounds reasonable. 

>It might just come down to a matter of taste

This may be it. I'm probably too judgmental. Kaiba's art style made me so apprehensive to it that I didn't want to enjoy it. If I was able to open my mind a bit I bet I could appreciate Kaiba better. Maybe I need to make use of some "mood enhancers" and try Kaiba again. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah, it's understandable.  Every Yuasa work I've ever seen has had an element or two that makes it difficult to penetrate at first.  I wouldn't recommend mood enhancers though - maybe it's just me, but I think that'd make Kaiba incredibly confusing.
>> ARTICLE
Jumping in on this, I'd say the late Satoshi Kon. I've even noticed that Kon has some fans in the arthouse cinema community. People who don't watch anime can appreciate his films because they really are like a cool indie movie that just happens to be animated. It's telling that Darren Aronofsky has literally (Requiem for a Dream) and figuratively (Black Swan) used Kon's film Perfect Blue as a creative inspiration. 
>> ARTICLE
Good question. Off the top of my head I can only think of:

* Mononoke
* Inaka Isha
* La Maison en Petits Cubes
* Memories
* Genius Party & Genius Party Beyond
* House of Five Leaves (although it retains some anime cliches)

There would be also a lot of movies that stylistically remain anime but thematically aim for "live drama" territory so you kind of look past the stylization, e.g. Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday, Wings of Honneamise or, as pointed out below, Perfect Blue. 

>> ARTICLE
I think the statement is fairly self-serving. But since you asked...

Let's give an example of a well-received series with some of those aforementioned problems: *Shinsekai Yori*.

Hear me out first. *Shinsekai Yori* is a novel adaptation by A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary to Sony's animation production/distribution corporation, Aniplex. A-1 Pictures is notable because they set up staff on a per-project basis, and as a result, the staff often isn't attached to the studio, leading to some very dramatic inconsistencies to their lineup. [Take a look yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-1_Pictures#Television_series)- they've created some of the most liked (eg. *Space Brothers*) and least liked (eg. *Fractale*) shows in the entire industry. Now, *Shinsekai Yori*, as it turns out, was assigned **9 separate episode directors, 13 animation directors, 6 storyboard writers, and 4 script writers**. 

That's quite a bit for a single project, and it shows. The art style is inconsistent (notably episode five), the pacing jumps all over the place (I write about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/21iam8/what_animemanga_has_the_worst_pacing/cgdj4yr)), and certain episode directors decided their time was better off spent producing giant exposition time sinks. That isn't to say that *Shinsekai Yori* is bad by any means, in fact- not only do I think the finale of the show was [one of the best moments in all of 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/22n18n/what_was_the_most_powerful_scene_in_anime_of_2013/cgoeofq), I personally abhor the manga for turning what is essentially a fantastic novel into a smutty mess. However, the anime series does have production problems that, in the end, stem from poor and misguided direction.

The thing about notable directors is that they're often held to a higher standard. They're expected to have mastered the basic principles in cinematography, film narrative, and editing. Could you imagine a director like Kurosawa, Sidney Lumet, or Kubrick creating a B-rated sci-fi flick? Or, in more anime related terms, could you imagine a director like Osamu Dezaki, Satoshi Kon, or Otomo Katsuhiro directing a run-of-the-mill LN adaptation? Yikes, even the thought scares me.

Masaaki Yuasa sails in a similar ship. People expect great work from him and they don't want to spend time analyzing sloppy rookie production errors, but instead want to look at the extent he can push the narrative capabilities of anime as a medium. They want to say "The themes at the end of the series are inconsistent to its detailing and the choice of using a handheld console rather than a Rubick's Cube took away from its gesture as a symbol for patience," not "The second arc felt like filler and the protagonist's character was both inconsistent and underdeveloped." Remember *Shinsekai Yori*? Yuasa doesn't make those errors. **His work has the confidence to focus on itself knowing that its core principles are already strong.**

To put it plainly, Yuasa delivers. Now, I could talk about his work for paragraphs, but the internet is already flooded with it anyway. Look at his track record: *The Tatami Galaxy*, *Kemonozume*, *Cat Soup*, *Mind Game*, and *Kaiba*. That's a seriously impressive resume. In a single episode, *Ping Pong* shows a lot of that exact type of directing that makes his previous work so well regarded. I once [wrote a little writeup](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1qupco/so_what_are_your_aoty_2013_contenders/cdguq3q) on why *Kyousougiga* and *Uchouten Kazoku* demonstrated the strength of anime as a medium- *Ping Pong* exhibits those same principles and its production very heavily supports it. It shows exactly how good anime *can* be.

Is *Ping Pong* flawless so far? **Definitely not**. There are a couple unnecessarily reused scenes and the opening looks like it was scrambled together overnight. I thought his execution of the older members of the club could have had more tact. Wenge Kong's characterization was not only delivered a little too fast, but it was simply a little plain. There was definitely some room for improvement.

However, is *Ping Pong* clearly a cut above the rest of the shows this season? The last time I counted, I'm watching more-or-less 26 airing shows for Spring 2014. I've watched the pilot episodes for nearly most of them by now. Has anything even come close? Well, the closest was perhaps *Mushishi,* which comes close in confidence, but trades its ambition for a less impressive consistency.

So my answer? **Definitely.**
>> ARTICLE
I read your response twice, and after doing so I think I have a much better grasp than I did before on the effect good direction can have on a show. 

>Now, I could talk about his work for paragraphs, but the internet is already flooded with it anyway.

There's a good many commenters/bloggers/critics that could benefit from such self-reflection(I'm looking at you, /u/tundranocaps ;) ). Thank you for holding back and keeping your response more focused with what you felt to be essential information. Synthesizing information is a HUGE part of effective communication.

I should mention that having an army of directors and writers for a single TV series is normal given the generally messy state of things in anime studios. Due to time constraints each episode is assigned its own director/storyboarder, scriptwriter and animation director, although some of them usually return to work on other episodes. The chief director, scriptwriter and animation director (usually also the character designer for obvious reasons) still have overall control of the production.

A special case is Space Dandy where a group of individuals are given the freedom to express themselves for an episode. Only the first and last episodes of the first half share the same director.

Sometimes schedules get so bad that the staff are forced to get more than one person for the key positions in order to finish an episode on time. This is something that tends to happen in a lot of A-1 anime (including SSY) partially because of the aforementioned per project basis of hiring.

Oh, Wow.

Also, Masaaki Yuasa, fuck yeah.

Well, technically, the name is *video*.

GIF is a kind of an outdated format with a few antiquated features (namely the limited color palette and bloated encoding). Considering that most modern browsers can play web video (eg: WebM [VP9], mp4 [h.264], etc.) fairly easily and that web videos have smaller file sizes with greater visual fidelity, I figured I might as well make the transition over.

Plus, [4chan started accepting them too.](http://blog.4chan.org/post/81896300203/webm-support-on-4chan)

If you want to make your own, [try this tool out.](https://github.com/WebMBro/WebMConverter) It's important to note that they're just like any other video format: mp4, mkv (although webm doesn't support softsubs, I think), avi, mov, etc. Personally, I find making high quality WebM videos a lot easier than making high quality GIFs.

WebM is based on MKV so it should have inherited some of the subtitle embedding. They may have restricted it to only SRT and no ASS. At least when I edit captions in YouTube videos they want it in SRT formatl.

Note to people trying this out -- remove '-an' from the arguments in the advanced tab if you want to keep audio in.  It looks like they added that by default due to 4chan disallowing audio streams.  I like having the option for either case.

Man some of those shot sequences were beautiful.  It certainly is a Yuasa show.  That was a nice first episode, even if I find the fact that they can hear what's going on to be a little ridiculous.

So Smile intentionally loses because he doesn't want Peco to cry?  That small gesture holds a lot.  I'm excited to see where the show ends up going.  I'm in love with this ED, it might be one of the few I actually sit through every episode.

The execution reminds me a lot of Monogatari, except instead of exploring the mind of a sexual deviant/anime subculture, it explores Ping Pong.

Hell, I even saw the special episode 'Noximilien l'horloger' for the French cartoon Wakfu that was directed by Yuasa (interestingly Wakfu also had another special done in cooperation with Ghibli and MADHOUSE.

Man, I knew this was gonna be good, but that was SO GOOD. Gorgeous, wonderfully paced, full of vibrant characters and energetic scenes... I was just smiling and laughing the whole goddamn time. This is what anime *could* be. Goddamn.

Are you gonna do a write up for this show? 
>> ARTICLE
Right now, I'm planning on just doing Week in Review posts and essays. We'll see if that changes, though.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, this exceeded my (unreasonably high) expectations. How they handled the characters was something I was particularly impressed with. The CM previews made it look like the characters were all cartoonishly extreme, so I was surprised by the amount of subtlety in handling Smile and China in particular. I watched the whole thing with the biggest grin on my face.

By holy crap Yuasa has done a good job with the art this time. While it almost looks like he's using his older aesthetic that he started off using in Mind Game and Kemonozume, this time around it not only oozes chaotic style, but *refined directorial control*. Mind Game and Kemonozume were crazy but it almost felt like Yuasa blew his own brains out and smeared them on animation cells (which unfortunately at moments in Kemonozume put a little bit of a damper on the fantastic noir atmosphere). And sure that has its own setting, and it worked well for him in the past, but this time around every shot and every misshapen line has *purpose* and it works so well for the story and the characters. It's like Yuasa moved through his Francis Bacon stage, to his surrealist stage, and now onto the point where he has his own sense of style which gives him a new kind of creative control.
>> ARTICLE
That was incredibly amazing.

Both beautiful and ugly, with great characters and nice animations.
Quite frankly I can see why Aymeric Kevin is in here : it looks like a "french-style" animation movie. (You know, like the Sylvain Chomet ones : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOi5OF7gAiM)

I loved it. Didn't really know what to expect, except a "strange" ping-pong anime, but it seems that there'll be moRe than this.

8.5/10, Will watch.

I totally agree. There will be moe. I'm looking forward to it! In our age, an anime can't succeed without moe!

Woops. Good catch :p
>> ARTICLE
That was a lot more low-key than I was expecting, but I enjoyed it a lot. The characterization of the 3 mains was great, lots of showing with only a little telling via exposition from the coaches. Peco is overconfident due to lack of strong competition, Smile is talented but has no competitive drive, and China is incredibly skilled and arrogant. 

The visuals seemed pretty restrained for a Yuasa show, but I doubt it will stay that way for long. I laughed when Peco's return hit flew up to the rafters and they showed a plane flying through the sky. The scene with China and his coach/interpreter listening to Peco and Smile play was also really well done. 

I really hope that the OP is just a placeholder, as it was almost entirely footage from the ep. The ED sequence was great though. 
>> ARTICLE
I did not expect to enjoy it, but man, talk about never judging a book by its cover. I read the first chapter of the manga and couldn't get to caring about any of the characters, but giving them a voice and mannerisms really distinguishes them from each other and makes them more human.

Does anyone know if China's VA was ad-libbing? His lines didn't match the subtitles, and I think they don't actually even match the Japanese ones. IMO, they actually lost of bit of his "voice" from that, because the way he spoke was more flavorful in Chinese than the subtitles allowed for. A few examples... 

* When he was insulting Peco's abilities, each aspect got a different insult, not just "Your backhand is weak, and your forehand, and your ..." 

* Instead of being stuck in "this eastern end of the world," he said "this puny backwards island."

* Instead of just "Now let's go inside," he said "No more talk. Let's go in and take a look."

And the exchange where he and the translator are talking about Peco and Smile's match was peppered with minor changes that alter the meanings a little. I'd be happy to translate each line he says, if anyone's interested in knowing.

I'm a mandarin speaker, and IMO, he's got a bit of an accent, but it's pretty damn light. Sounds a bit southern, which matches where he comes from - though the Shanghai accent is actually much stronger and has a bit of a "lisp" in comparison to northern, which he doesn't have.
>> ARTICLE
I was not excited for this show before watching it. I was definitely a skeptic. Why? Most of the hype surrounding this show felt pretentious to me. 3 episode rule was in full effect going in...I needed to be converted because a lot of the hype had left a bad taste in my mouth. That said, Ping Pong has definitely exceeded my expectations thus far.  

The most immediately noticeable aspect of Ping Pong is the unique art style. I felt the art style benefits the ping pong aspect of the show but detracts from the characters in all scenes that don't focus particularly on their faces. This art style allows for extremely expressive faces in close-ups, but scenes showing the entire bodies of people look a bit blob-like. 

Ping Pong's music was the biggest surprise for me; it was fantastic. There were no epic pieces, but every scene with music used it to perfectly accentuate the scene. 

Overall, I was impressed. The 3 episode rule is still in effect, but as long as  Ping Pong continues to have episodes of at least this quality I'll continue to watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes there is a 'pretentious hype' for a reason! Masaaki Yuasa is just really, really, *really* good at directing an anime.

I like how unconventional it feels.

There aren't any shonen protagonists, no declaration of intent, and there's even a disgraced prodigy with his own issues to work out. 

I look forward to more!

Man, that was brilliant. Could already feel the intensity of the characters' interactions/relationships. And everything else is polished perfectly - as we'd expect from Yuasa Masaaki. Music and cinematography especially were amazing. Want to play some ping pong now, as terrible as I would be.

Wow that was amazing. I love it. I really want to see what Smile can do and I actually kinda liked that Wenge guy too, even when he did come off as a bit of a dick. That's cool though, there's a lot of potential going into this show already! 

I really like the music, art direction and characters so far as well. The direction of this episode was pretty good as well, the only thing this show feels like it's lacking so far is an actual plot. I can say I'm definitely looking forward to the next episode. 

EDIT: Oops, I forgot to mention the animation is particularly spotty as well. It's not awful or anything, it's just not noticeable with the art style which they chose to go with (similar to the manga) which is a pretty good thing.
>> ARTICLE
Great first episode, didn't quite grab me and take me for a ride like the first episode of Tatami Galaxy, but it still pretty much delivered what I hoped it would. 

I love Yuasa's style, Peco's movements while he played were really fun. Yuasa likes to play with perspective a lot, and I'm hoping that ping pong will give him some interesting things to do in that regard. Kevin Aymeric's backgrounds were as lovely as I expected. 

I really liked the ED animation which looks like it was Eunyoung Choi's. I like seeing her stuff when she doesn't have to fit into a show's prescribed art style. This felt more like her doing her own thing than we usually get. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I'm going to have to temper my excitement, so excuse me while I drool from every orifice.  I'll do my best to be levelheaded about it.

This is definitely a Yuasa show, replete with scrawled, amorphous backgrounds and deliberately bizarre visual perspectives.  That said, it's probably the *least* impressive visual work I've seen from him (apart from [Slime Boukenki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8664/Slime_Boukenki:_Umi_da_Yeah!) - yeah, I've watched a lot of Yuasa).  The atypical designs are par for the course, but the movements are stilted and seem hampered by a low budget, perhaps.  There's an unusual amount of visual repetition.  The OP, for example, repeats several shots from the opening scene alone.  Hard to say whether that's a budget thing or a purposeful visual motif, but it's not too farfetched to bet on the latter, knowing Yuasa.  Some of the pseudo-3D aerial transition shots looked *awesome* though, and combined with the scraggly outlines gave it almost a papercraft look.  The silent shot of the white sky, transitioning to China and his translator/coach(?) analyzing Peco and Smile's play by sound alone - I'm a total sucker for that kind of avant-garde shit.

The voice acting is great.  Peco's newcomer VA seems perfectly suited for the role, and I love Smile's [dry detachment](http://i.imgur.com/xnBBNmp.png).  I love that they had the balls to have China actually speak Chinese, and from what I've heard, the VA is a native speaker.  I wish the sound design was more distinct and weird.  But the great soundtrack makes up for that.

The China/Peco match makes me want to renege on what I said about the visual style not being very impressive.  That was cool as hell.  I wasn't too hooked on the first half of the show, but by the end I remembered why I was so pumped for this show in the first place.  Wonderful tone, atmosphere, characters.  The train ride home.  The back-and-forth between Peco and Smile.  *The wind makes it hard to hear.* China's intensity.  The "stop after next".  I haven't read the source manga, but you know the character development here is going to be something special. 

There I go again, drooling from my orifices.  Anyway, I'm so excited about how this plays out.
>> ARTICLE
I'm normally not one for sports shows, but that was pretty good. I of course know nothing about ping pong terminology, but I got the gist of what was being said. I guess the hype for this show was correct, which makes sense because the hype was more based on the director and other staff members than on the content itself.
>> ARTICLE
Well, here's my new favorite show of the season.

I wish the linework in the ED were a little darker though. I know Yuasa wanted a sketchy nostalgic feeling, but I think the contrast could be raised slightly.
>> ARTICLE
this season flood with intense sports anime , including this one. im 'full' already! bless this season
>> ARTICLE
Massaki Yuasa does it again. I love his style, like in Tatami Galaxy, and it continues to impress. It's already mentioned but I cannot get over how GOOD the Chinese is. As mentioned, it does have a weird accent, but it's completely understandable. The translations are pretty good for the Chinese but not entirely accurate.

Subs: "No, he's got speed but leaves himself wide open."
My version: "Not quite, it's true his speed is real but there are many openings."

I wonder if they're translating from the translations or directly from the dialogue. 

Will Peco learn humbleness and Smile a sense of competitiveness? 
>> ARTICLE
Your version is fairly literal, and has worse flow than the version they chose in the subs. Not quite instead of no could be an alternate phrasing, but the second half is just a literal phrasing of what he said. I would try to mimic the parallel construction that the Chinese had in the subs (they tried to do this when he remarks about Peco's footwork, forehand, etc). Yes, he literally says his play leaves him many openings but "leaving himself wide open" is similar enough to sacrifice accuracy imo. Something along the lines of: "Not quite. While he's got speed, he's also leaving himself (wide) open".

As far as accuracy goes, the "You don't deserve to be at the same table as me!" line missed his second exclamation completely. I would've phrased it as "You think you deserve to be at the same table as me? In your dreams!" or something similar.

God, the writing is brilliant. Probably at least 90% of shows have hackneyed writing, and you can often tell from the first one or two lines what camp it falls in. The dialogue and characters feel organic and real, and for me that's one of the biggest factors in how good the show is.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely think it's a really great first episode. All the quality I expected from something under Yuasa's control.

Very excited to see where he's going to go with this. Rarely do you ever see some well-written characters in sports series, and even more rarely do you have their attitudes be so prevalent in their playstyle, especially in a believable way. Smile's chop is always so firm and gripping, and yet is so casual. It's how I see him, always looking as if not caring, but serious at the same time. And Peco's character is reflected heavily in his erratic, playful play style too.(as well as his childish demeanor in defeat)

I'll be following this show to the end of the world.
>> ARTICLE
Might i add that while Yuasa is amazing, let's not forget the author of Ping Pong. Taiyou Matsumoto is amazing and the animation style you see in Ping Pong is definitely based off of his art style. I really hope his latest ongoing work, "Sunny", will get picked up sooner or later too. If anyone is interested, definitely try the film, "Tekkon Kinkreet". 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I'm so impressed by this first episode. I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did. I think it's mainly because of the two main characters and "China", I found the three of them to be quite interesting and definitely liked them more than I'd expect. Also, as someone who's practiced ping pong and it being a sport I love, I found the whole episode quite interesting. I especially liked when they used terms uncommon to non-ping pong players (not saying I knew them all, didn't/don't know many in fact), in a way showing that they're professionals. That's one thing I like as well, them being pros makes it so much more interesting and enjoyable in my opinion. I think in all sports anime I've seen (haven't seen that many actually), the main characters always start as beginners, or they're still kind of new to the sport. These guys being pros at the get-go, I'm very interested in how they will develop, in contrast to characters in sports anime that start as beginners and work their way to becoming pros.

I really like the unique style as well, not only because it reminds me of The Tatami Galaxy, but also because I think it's unique in a very good and likeable way, it's also very refreshing in a way. I think, because of this fact and because I think this will become a highly rated series, but still not as highly rated as The Tatami Galaxy, people might compare the two in the same way people compare Kill la Kill to Gurren Lagann, as they both have unique similarities.

Seeing "China" doing drives/spins in the match between him and Hoshino really makes me want to play ping pong and practice some drives/spins myself. I'm so excited for the episodes to come.

Ok, this Peco guy is an overconfident prick, and I am *so* going to enjoy watching him pick up his pieces. 

I liked how Smile keeps going on and one about how he's not Peco's keeper, and yet he covers for him, follows his plans and picks him up when he's down. Very good characterization - doesn't treat me like an idiot. 

Also, the music when Wenge landed...oh man. *Oh man.*

On the other hand, Kong Wenge's a badass and I'm looking forward to seeing just how good Smile is.

I loved how Peco said earlier "effort is for those without talent." And yet, while Kong was beating the shit out of Peco, we had Kong's flashbacks to his youth, talking about all the training he did.

Yuasaa has a new show. I've never finished one of his shows yet, but I've seen segments of them, and he's a name to follow, alright. I also heard the source material is good, I mean, why else would you adapt a manga from 1988 with a live-action film from 2002? All in all, it screams to me that this is a work someone *wanted to do*, rather than doing so "because money" (though we can never disregard money).

That's more than enough cause to check it out.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) Artistic Introductions:**

1. [Dem old school mecha superhero things, and the flying bird-mecha hero-man with the cheese-moon](http://i.imgur.com/OTJJrkw.jpg) :3

1. [The music as we'd been introduced to "Smile" with all the data on screen](http://i.imgur.com/AoEN99m.jpg)? Really felt like a Tarantino flick, some mixture of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and Kill Bill, heh.

1. [Look ma! We're artistic!](http://i.imgur.com/1ctA48A.jpg) We're breaking our action down to components, showing it in all of its slo-mo glory, but back in 1988, we didn't really have bullet-time, so we stopped on each frame, one at a time! :p

1. [Mr. Fabulous Pink, in all of his flamboyant glory.](http://i.imgur.com/27gauiJ.jpg)

1. I know they're nothing alike, [but the spartan minimalist feel still reminds me of The Tatami Galaxy.](http://i.imgur.com/7O3NwCf.jpg)

**2) Mr. Smile - On Friendship:**

1. "Having fun at your club?" - "The game is the same wherever I play it." This is like Bamboo Blade's Tama-chan and Free!'s Haru all rolled into one guy. Either you like the game, or you don't. All there is, is the game, and the game is the same anywhere. Well, Tama-chan ended up liking the club and played the game because of the club. Yeah, much closer to Haru, who also had issues with showing emotions. And in the end they all find out that the place, and the *people* with whom you play matter. I suspect it'd happen here as well.

1. ["Old Man Smile"](http://i.imgur.com/P19Srsx.jpg) - That's why he hates people, he thinks of them as kids, and he's scared of what he doesn't understand.

1. "So that's Smile-*san* to you, *fool*." - Oh my, I laughed out loud here. I like these characters.

1. Oh man, that broken English was so good. You go, old teacher man! Also, such a line for a teacher/coach, "No man so good, but another may be as good as he." - It's all about *together*, about who you are playing with, or competing against. I wonder if he thinks Smile is not giving it his all when playing against Peco.

**3) Tennis is The World:**

1. [The Enemy! This feels so much like Kill Bill.](http://i.imgur.com/3Ip1MqZ.jpg)

1. Badasses! Yeah, sports shows and samurai shows are so very similar, in so many ways. The true badasses, the masters of the game, the Chinese people, can hear their lessers play, and tell how the game is progressing, based on sound alone. It's like two samurai fighting, or people in a dojo, and those sitting at the sides explaining how the match is going.

1. "The chopper is losing on purpose" - *Yes*! Exactly as I suspected. Old tennis coach may not be the best tennis player, but he knows what lies at the heart of his students. That small question of his before whether they've been friends for long? He *knew* Smile is losing so Peco, who cares about being "The Best in Ping-Pong" will get to retain that feeling!

1. [Wenge! Wenge lives for the game!](http://i.imgur.com/ZKdf16L.jpg) He is the competitive drive of players (and Haru and Rin-chan's). To him hell is playing bad games. Playing with someone much better or much worse than you is no good for those who want to get better, to those who live for the game. So if this is Hell, then Wenge will punish everyone else as well.

1. "Crying when you lose is a bad habit." - And here we see why Smile loses on purpose. I'm also not surprised Smile is so indifferent about Ping-Pong. As Wenge had said, if you play like it, it becomes a habit. The habit isn't playing badly, but "not playing to win", which entails "not caring about the game." - I think Smile is *all too aware* that the game isn't the same wherever you play it, or rather, with *whoever* you play it. He doesn't care where he plays, so long it's with Peco. And that's why he's willing to lose.

**OP** - Wow, that came out of *nowhere*. So much energy. The style reminds me somewhat of a mix of Aku no Hana and The Tatami Galaxy, visually. Very energetic, very vibrant, sound-wise. A lot of movement without much change. It's charming, but not exactly my cup of tea.

**ED** - Nice visuals, a good amount of energy, but all in all, forgettable, as most EDs are.


**Post Episode Thoughts:**

This show was basic. This show was simple.

Now, how many of you think that's me badmouthing the show? Silly people, you're all wrong.

This show is a sports show about friendship, with all the fat taken away. Spartan style? Yes, because it will live and die based on its characters, based on its story.

What we have here isn't unique, it's not a story we hadn't seen countless times. But we don't come to shows for a "new story", and we do rewatch shows, where we're promised not to have a single plot-twist to surprise us. We come to shows for a crisp and clean execution.

This show is promising us that. Anything else is dust in the wind.

Also, "Old Man Smile"? He doesn't hate kids. His best friend, Peco, is one.

(If you'd like to read more of my episodic notes,[most of them are collected here.](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/episodic-observations/))
>> ARTICLE
Another nice part of the show is actually how they play Ping Pong. People can say about the art whatever they want but the actual animation when they play is awesome. I did Ping Pong for a while when I was younger and you can really see that the people who did it know what they are doing, the stuff that happens on screen is really good gameplay.

Tatami Galaxy, for one. I tried to watch it with an anime club, then fell behind, then stayed behind. I just need to watch it without taking notes, then I'll manage - due to how often I need to pause due to speech-speed, pausing even more for note-taking was its death.
>> ARTICLE
Haha yea I hear you. I know taking notes is a big thing for you, but it might be worth doing yourself the favor of just watching it through the first time without multitasking. One could argue that a rewatch is necessary for Tatami Galaxy, and that might be the perfect time for your writeups.

Oh, I'm definitely planning to watch it without notes. I know where the limit is.

Just as I'm waiting for Monogatari Second Season to be out on BD fully and then watch it without taking notes. Took notes for Hanekawa's arc when it aired on TV, didn't enjoy it.

You gotta pick what's right for each show.

Hm, looking at it, barely took any notes for Tatami Galaxy. It was more falling behind and that each episode took 40 mins to watch due to speech-speed, heh.

Um wow. I have totally fallen in love with this show. I would call this AOTS but there's Jojo.

A really compelling storyline and the animation just fucking oozes of style and the ping pong game was seriously intense. 

I do enjoy that the Chinese VA sounded pretty darn authentic to my ears which is nice.

A lot of good characterization and symbolic contrast throughout the episode and it was the first one. Seriously hyped for more.

so mushishi finally has competition for show of the season, this ruled

Hey! Jojo 3 is good so far!
>> ARTICLE
We're introduced to the three main characters. Peco, carefree, overconfident and childish. Smile, serious minded and talented at Ping-Pong. China, arrogant, but apparent suffered some sort of disgrace and is laying low for awhile. Seems a little awkward using exposition from the coaches rather than through the characters themselves in the first episode, although the way Smile apparently lets Peco win at Ping-Pong to spare his feelings is nice unspoken gesture between two long-time friends. Art is a little rough and realistic with nice stylistic touches, especially some of the shot sequences. Will keep watching. 
>> ARTICLE
This anime has everything I hate, ugly art and its a sport anime.
But still for someone reason it captivated me I even got goosebumps, i'm guessing its because it has a chinese character in it.

Also probably the first anime i've seen with no girls introduced.

6.68/10 on MAL.

Really?
>> ARTICLE
And then then we have a 8.38/10 for No Game No Life...
>> ARTICLE
It seems that people who rate a show early are those who love it or hate it. 

I quite liked No Game No Life, it was beautiful to look at and it reminded me heavily of *Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They?* which I liked a lot. In contrast, I hated the style of this show, but I love the characters. 

That said, I wouldn't rate either show after a single episode. If I was forced, I'd probably give this show a 7 (which is "Good" according to MAL) and No Game No Life an 8 ("Very Good"). Both of these could change over time.
>> ARTICLE

I mean, I wouldn't even be so mad at incest if it was handled mature and serious, but we actually have more pandering, perverted Brother/Sister relationships this season than there are honest, caring siblings.
>> ARTICLE
And we're already at 8.35 for NG,NL, and 7.22 for Ping-Pong.

People react too quickly about these things. I mean, when he posted about Ping-Pong's score it had less than 100 ratings. That No Game, No Life has close to 4k ratings already is mind-boggling, however.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you can't really settle on a final score after the first episode. It's still crazy how fast No Game No Life was able to draw in viewers though. On the biggest German sides it's already established itself as the biggest anime of the season. But those guys also classified The Tatami Galaxy as ecchi, so...
>> ARTICLE
I plead guilty, As I wanted to check a lot of anime this season I started to note them 4,5 or 6 depending 1st impression, (except Mushishi that got a high note straight away) just to get a base line for the next 2 ep and see if it improved or lived to expectation or just did not.

In no way this is final rating but an aid to classify shows.

I noted Ping pong 5 because I am not a fan of sport shows and I still have high expectation and want to be impressed (I am waiting for it to improve in my eyes) even though if I was to rate it for what I think of it it would be a solid 7 (even if I eventually drop or hold watching it due to the fact that I am mot the ideal target for this show)
>> ARTICLE
Well, Mushishi is probably just going to stay the way it is now, and that's what makes it great. The other big ones this season for me would be JoJo's or Ping Pong actually. I used to play it when I was younger and even though I never watch sports anime it got me more invested on the games and characters than most of the other shows this season can dream of. Not to forget that the writing and actual animation is excellent. It would probably be around eight at the moment, with everything but JoJo's, Mushishi and Isshukan Friends sitting at 5 or worse and No Game No Life, Bokura and Mahouka at the bottom.
>> ARTICLE
exactly but this is not how I rate...

I did put for example no game no life at 6 because I want to see how it goes and I am prepared to be disappointed...

Basically it is a ranking that makes no sens but to me.

As for jojo (I'm waiting vor the shitstorm of downvote if anyone read that) I dropped the first season because I couldn't make myself enjoy it I am not even trying to watch it now (or rating it)
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, JoJo's is pretty much love or hate. Either you're in for the melodrama, self seriousness and fabulous colors or you just shake your head and drop it. Don't try to watch it if you cant stand it, that perfectly fine.

As for the ratings, my scores from above were entirely based on what I was expecting from the shows. 

JoJo's while doing nothing big, showed that it would take its time rather than being rushed and promised lots of very sweet, diverse action and pacing for the show. 

Mushishi established that it will just stay the same as always, thus being very unlikely to fail. 

No Game No Life/Black Bullet promised us lots of flashy animation and action but, for me, featured to many of the usual tropes, unimaginative conflicts and rather bland characters, which usually don't disappear halfway through (even though It still might happen). Especially NGNL was so hard on the Games pay off, protagonists winning everything and Loli fanservice that I half expect it to turn into a parody. Well, just my opinion. 

Ping Pong and Captain Earth both promise good writing and proper handling of their themes, with Ping Pongs first episode way more conclusive and instantly enjoyable, whilst Captain Earth prefers to keep everyone in the dark for now.

But I can certainly see where your ratings are coming from and it's actually a rather interesting way of looking at it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you summed it up well,

It is a first try on that rating type because I intend to follow a lot of show this season.

I am back in anime after a quite long time and discovered MAL not so long ago.

I actually don't like rating because most of the time it make no sens retrospectively: I loved suzumiya back in the day just as much as I did mushishi for VERY different reason, I cannot rate them the same though or at least not according to the same standards... well you see the issue.

Most of my rating on MAL for shows are approximation, some show I barely remember or just remember I had a good time.

Now I had a good time watching some show for the fan service only and some for the actual anime...

I am hoping that this slow evaluation of rating through the season will help me have a better rating system overall.

Also I can already see the rating I put for shows from this winter not being what I would rate them now... rating is confusing and should not be what you use to determine if you want to see a show or not.

Not even your own rating (in my case at least) and even less the ones from stranger on the internet that may have very different tastes.

But let pass a few month/years and you will always see evangelion and such at the top and Pupa at the bottom... this means something still...
>> ARTICLE
That's almost as bad as Uchouten Kazoku being defined as furry slice of life comedy, or Kyousougiga as a slice of life comedy about a highschool girl. One user of our subreddit described them both that way.

Also, especially for LN/manga adaptations, early material often starts great and then they run out of ideas. I *really* liked Outbreak Company in the first 5 episodes, and then.... *yeah*. Also, though original material, the first 5 episodes of Angel Beats! were some of my favourite anime, but then I felt the rest was a huge letdown, though I know many disagree here, it's still a fact it's so silly to render judgement at this point.

Though you *could* say "The show up to this point." I only really consider scores from episode 5 or so, and only give them before that if I end up dropping the show.
>> ARTICLE
Well, as long es there are still people on the Internet you can have a reasonable discussion with and there are enough little shows that keep me interested I'm fine.

I'll try to stick to every medicore show I started this spring hoping for them to improve in some way but I'd probably have more fun just clearing the shows in my Backlog I'm sure to enjoy. Lets see where this get me.
>> ARTICLE
> I'll try to stick to every medicore show I started this spring hoping for them to improve in some way but I'd probably have more fun just clearing the shows in my Backlog I'm sure to enjoy

Yeah. Winter *really* struck this home, combined with looking at some people's "Top X Shows" lists. The best of the season was "good" but not "great", and most of the season was mediocre to "slightly above average".

We watch all these currently running shows, most of them rightfully forgotten in even 6 months, when our backlogs have shows we're much more likely to both enjoy and appreciate.

I'm cutting down my episodic notes for most shows this season beyond the first episode, and the next step is to drop most of the shows as they air. I enjoy marathoning shows more as well anyway.

Coming to a season not as it ends, but 3-9 months afterwards allows you to see what's worth your time, and you can still follow a handful of shows as they go.

This season's premiers had been pretty great. The worst shows are "mediocre", but nothing screamed at me to insta-drop it. Well, some shows are terrible, but I predicted them being so and didn't bother ;-)
>> ARTICLE
This season is actually the first one where I tried to grab more than 2-4 airing shows at a time, and I have to admit that it  gets into my way of enjoying something to an extend. My current plan is to watch everything as it comes out, and then sneak in an episode of older stuff I want to see when I have the time, and its just not as fun as powering through a whole show in one go.

Still, I'll probably going to finish everything I started up to now, if only to keeping my "Dropped" section clean, and then just pick my 4-5 favorites for summer and have a go at some classics I want to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I felt like I'd seen the premise for no game no life before. Also, the loli pissed me off. It was like she was crippled by her own uguu-ness, she couldn't fucking speak properly. I dislike the design aswell, she doesn't look human.

However I can see why people might like it, but I gave it 6/10.
>> ARTICLE
Scored by 108 people right after the first episode. It's basically a pretty unsignificant score heavily influenced by those who didn't like the visual style and are going to drop the show after the first episode.

Never trust people who rate based on one episode, honestly.

The knee-jerk is strong within them, in both directions. Much of that has to do with "Ew, dat art!"

So i tried watching the first episode of this. I saw the previews from before and thought meh maybe it's just the previews. Nope. I could not stand the artwork at all. To me it looked horrible. The next thing i couldn't stand was the voice acting. It was just so boring to listen to. These guys sounded like they were just drawling on. Now that may just be me used to other more excitable animes. But i don't be watching this one anymore.

>> ARTICLE
> I just got a little pissed that someone would stop watching this because the art-style is unusual.

I don't get this. People watch anime for a lot of reasons, and one of those reasons is their enjoyment of a certain art style. I know art is a *huge* part of what I love about anime, so when a series doesn't have good art I tend to not be able to get into it. I mean no offense, but people who criticize what other people do/do not enjoy tend to come across as full of themselves and/or placing themselves above others.

I only watch what I enjoy, and I can't control what that is. If I find a show that I like for its content, but I can't enjoy the art/animation style, I simply don't watch it and go straight to the source material (I did the same with Aku no Hana). It really irks me when I get looked down on for not liking something.

P.S. Nanami 4 life!
>> ARTICLE
People drop shows for all kinds of reasons all the time. If they stick with it and complain about the art style every episode, that's more of a reason to be pissed. In this case, it's the first episode, so people (like me) are giving it a try, possibly without knowing anything about it in advance (also like me).
>> ARTICLE
They have a style that I think needs more frames, the first half of the episode was not too great, but I found the later half to be much more enjoyable. I don't know if they animated it better, I got used to the style or if it was just emotional investment but it became a lot easier to watch as the episode went on.

Edit: I completly forgot to mention, the introductory scene before they started practice looked great, it just took a dive in quality afterwards.

As someone who plays the sport, watching the anime is something Ive been really enjoying because of the detail to the game they have, Chinese Penhold, Japanese penhold, long pips, defenders, choppers, etc etc. Im loving the new OP and the animation once again is just amazing.

Never understood the switch coach made for the long pips on the rubber. Smile was attacking for the first two matches, then they put on something which is designed to slow the ball down and reduce all the spin. Let me tell you something, if thats me, and someone did that change to my racket with no practice on those long pips, yeah, I'd miss a lot of shots at the start like smile did (another shoutout to the animations with the ball digging into the pimples). 

The question is, is he gonna keep losing because he cares about the opponent winning?
>> ARTICLE
I think part of the reason for the pips as well was Kong's amazing spin he is able to put onto his balls. Slowing that down would be very advantageous. 
>> ARTICLE
True, but long pimples makes it impossible to apply spin, what you can do with them is keep the spin or remove it. I know back in the old days the pimples could make the ball move in the air (that was a good time). So if the source material is old, this could be the case
>> ARTICLE
The source material is from the 1996.
>> ARTICLE
hmm, 96. Thats interesting, back in '96 the rules were best of 3, first to 21, instead of best of 5, first to 11. Plus a lot of other changes that I could mention but would probably put people to sleep. One of them includes banning a style of long pips. Which makes me thought "maybe he was using those", but if the anime has it to 11, then maybe its been modernized 
>> ARTICLE
Why did they ban Long Pips?
>> ARTICLE
They banned a type of long pips. There used to be a type called "frictionless" which basicly is what it says: the surface of the pips had no grip on them, so the ball would slide off, causing all kind of weird stuff to the ball like making it move in mid air
>> ARTICLE
the anime has at least modernized some things - in the manga he's playing with a rubik's cube in his downtime, the anime he's playing a game boy.  i don't know enough about ping pong to talk about that aspect but at least some of it has been changed.
>> ARTICLE
If that is what long pips do then it sounds like it compliments smile well considering that machine like accuracy he has. I think slowing the ball down would allow him time to pin point locations to hit the ball to.
>> ARTICLE
For a defender, long pips is what they love to use, and the fact he is a chopper means it a great combination. The more I think about it, the more I understand why he gave him the long pips: to stop smile from playing that aggressive style 
>> ARTICLE
We should be upvoting you to the top of this thread.
>> ARTICLE
What exactly does it mean to be "a chopper"?
>> ARTICLE
not a ping pong player, but from what I can tell from the show, it means a person who hits the ball with a chopping motion. If you pay attention to how smile plays, he almost always tries to hit the ball with a chop, compared to wenge or peco who seem to hit more with a swinging motion. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone who applies backspin (which is the opposite of top spin) onto the ball using a slicing [spelling] motion, it does look like you're trying to chop meat or something like that. It's the basic way a defender plays: stays away from the table and hits the ball in this motion at the latest possible moment, causing a lot lf backspin, causing the ball to drop and makes it hard to return

I hate to play against choppers, but sometimes they're wonderful to watch
>> ARTICLE
Thank you. Might have to re-watch all three episodes with this knowledge.

Praise the lord! Actual OP animation!

The OP animation is really damn beautiful, but I'm not gonna lie - I think I preferred the recycled footage OPs. They fit better with the song, and the song is the best anime opening theme I've heard in years.

Ironically, I think Smile is the only one with emotions there. Wanting to win, and being sad by losing is just foolish. Smile is the only one considering others feelings, and the only one that sees table tennis by what it is: just a game. He is the anti shounen sports hero.
>> ARTICLE
God, I love the mandarin in this, even the swearing is on point.
>> ARTICLE
Yes!!! The acting and emotion is so on point when they swear, it's great. My favorite is the line where the teacher was yelling at Kong about not coming here on vacation, the swearing was so. Chinese. 
>> ARTICLE
Good to hear things on this front is pretty solid.  I don't know Chinese so I couldn't really tell you one way or another if it's remotely good acting.  But it *sounds* authentic and is miles above the typical Japanese guy doing a bad impression of a foreign language.
>> ARTICLE
Tsukimoto let Kong win because the manager was shouting "It's all over if you lose here" and "Won't you show the team that dropped you how good  you are" and shit, letting Smile take into account China's feelings and losing so that he could go on in his career

On a side note, just because everyone in the show calls the dude 'China', that doesn't really make it OK for us to do so.  Can we not do that, pls?

You're joking right?
>> ARTICLE
http://imgur.com/r/upvotegifs/Tau2fxX

Yeah I thought the same thing because I knew Tsukimoto couldn't lose. Also the coach did a "tss" thing that hinted at him knowing he was throwing the game because China needed the win. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow great catch. Now that I think back, the zoom up to Smile's ear connotes a lot.
>> ARTICLE
lol how is that a great catch? I'm pretty sure the fact that Smile threw the game was the culminating point of the episode.

Haha yea it's pretty obvious, but somehow I completely wooshed. I thought Kong was able to bring his A-game because Smile hadn't realized his full potential yet.

This also raises the question: Can Smile understand chinese ? He also greeted Kong in a more serious manner in chinese than Peco did

Edit: Changed beg to raise
>> ARTICLE
> This also begs the question

No it doesn't.

>Can Smile understand chinese ?

Maybe. Yet it's possible he was just putting two and two together here. It seems like most people know Kong's situation, but the coach's angry outburst may have driven it home.

Eh, language is fluid, and I think that begging the question is now thought of as the same thing as raising the question. I don't understand why so many people are intent on keeping the true meaning for this phrase.

Don't forget first episode. Smile may not understand Chinese, but he understood Kong and his coach *perfectly*. He lives in the same world as they do, he talked to Kazama, he knows what is at stake.

They talk through their rackets, and after that dialogue, Smile understands Kong. Kong - "Can he read me?"

I was waiting for Kong to curse him out over letting him winning as Smile calmly walked away.

Naw, I think he was humbled by the experience.
>> ARTICLE
It may not happen at the tournament itself, but I'm pretty sure he's going to call Smile out about it eventually.  There's nothing more shaming than being given a pity win for a game you take as seriously and with pride as Kong does.

That isn't to say he won't appreciate being given an opportunity to keep playing though.
>> ARTICLE
The animation of the pips and the spinning ball. Holy shit.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not surprised Smile let Kong win. In fact it's too early for him to have completely overcome that habit, there would be too little character growth left for him. He put on enough pressure to show Kong he could have won if he wanted to, and then let him take the win because it means more to him. I doubt Kong will overlook this. Smile needs to learn that letting someone win is not good sportsmanship, and can be downright insulting to the other player.
>> ARTICLE
You are one of the few who can see with a creator's eyes. It really would be strange to have him go from water to fire in so few episodes. If he actually won that, he would have forever abandoned his old self. And this anime would turn in a generic shounen sports one, where all the MC does is looking for stronger opponents. But it isn't. Our MC is a normal person, he plays the game to entertain himself, he see's it for what it is: just a game. And now I am really excited to see where this is going!
>> ARTICLE
I'm just not surprised from a narrative perspective.  If Kong loses this early, and his career is over, the show would kind of lose its whole purpose.  He's very clearly a central character who we'll see a whole lot more of later as the show progresses.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that going easy on someone can be insulting, but in this situation was it really a bad decision in the grand scheme of things? If Smile were to beat Kong here, Kong's career would halt three games into his first ever *regional* tournament Japan. No one in China, or even Japan, would care that Smile was a genius-level dark horse. The rest of the world just sees Kong slipping only a short while after being kicked off the national team.

If Kong (understandably) feels smited by the easy win, he should man up, train, and take his Japanese opponents seriously. Although it may not have been Smile's intention I think Kong should see the match as a good life lesson.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I was not saying that smile was "wrong" for letting Kong win, it was his choice, and it fits his personality. In the same way he would not be "wrong" if he went all out and destroyed Kong. Taking his opponents into account is not necessarily a sign of weakness, but he should also be taking into account his school. From the sounds of it it would be a pretty big deal if his school won anything, let alone if they had the player that beat Kong. I can understand why his coach is so frustrated that he doesn't take winning seriously. But at the same time Ping Pong isn't a team sport so he should be free to play as he wishes, even if he ruffles a few feathers along the way.
>> ARTICLE
That last shot when Kong has his hands held up above his head in celebration.

Doesn't look happy at all. I'm pretty sure he knew Tsukimoto lost on purpose, and hates both himself and Tsukimoto for it. 
>> ARTICLE
> I'm pretty sure he knew Tsukimoto lost on purpose, and hates both himself and Tsukimoto for it.

Nope, he doesn't.

When you're blinded by the will to win like Wenge was, you don't see nuances like that.
>> ARTICLE
Look at his face. You can even see half of his frown. Someone who's "blinded by the will to win" would be celebrating. He even celebrated points he won in his games. He knows Smile gave him that win. Especially since he was able to tell Smile was holding back against Peco just by the sounds of their rally. 
>> ARTICLE
Naw he definetely does. He realizes though that because Smile gave him the win that he is able to continue playing with honor. He may hate Smile throwing the match, but without that wenge would have a miserable life ahead of him
>> ARTICLE
Damn, smiles going beastmode. Finally finished OP is glorious as well
>> ARTICLE
Argh, Mr Tsukimoto, why did you let him win?
>> ARTICLE
He's just playing to kill time, and Kong's playing because this the only chance for him to return to his country's team. I'd imagine his empathy got in the way yet again and he felt too guilty about crushing someone's dreams on a whim.
>> ARTICLE
It was sympathy, and that's exactly what happened. It was the very thing Kazama was talking to him about too. Smile could have very easily won this match, but his weakness kept him from doing so despite being a cold, calculating machine. As for now, he's just a cyborg. 
>> ARTICLE
And despite being this cold, calculating machine, he is the only one who has feelings there. Why care so much about a game, this feeling is just empty. Smile cares for others, and thus is the only one who has feelings.

Also this also shows why he has allowed Peco to win all this years, Peco is an ego guy, a loser whose only achievement has been being a great Ping Pong player. Tsukimoto is like sure.. i dont care about winning if letting you win makes you happy and allows us to be friends then so be it. During the game Peco is scared because he is slowly realizing what the coach and Wenge knew all along

Im looking forward to see how Peco's relationship with Tsukimoto evolves im sure Peco is going to be mad jelly and Tsukimoto might actually be a bit sad for losign Peco's friendship
>> ARTICLE
You got it so well, I loved the relationship they created. Smile is Peco's friend, and so, lets Peco win because he knows his friend actually cares for it. But what will happen now? Will Peco still accept the fact that Smile didn't win out of pity? Will Smile be lonely if Peco abandon him? Or will Peco stop seeing the game as a wicked shounen character where all that matters is winning, and just keep things as they always were?
 Hey, was this ever created before? I really think we have something original here.

[Someone needs to make a deal-with-it gif with Kong at 13:04](http://i.imgur.com/UcfDCEB.png)

Hmm, so, Smile's machine is a robot. Kong is an jet airliner?
>> ARTICLE
Last time I tried making a gif it turned out horrible. Hopefully someone else here is better at it.
>> ARTICLE
> Kong is an jet airliner?

Makes sense. Kong doesn't want to be where he is; he wants to be in China. Japan is just an annoying detour, and because of that attitude, he didn't take the possibility of defeat seriously whatsoever. Kong played right into Smile's tactic of losing the first round to figure out how to read Kong's moves.
>> ARTICLE
It would also work great as a metaphor for how high he flies above the others - he's just on a completely different level. 
>> ARTICLE
and his strong desire to return home to China too. Ping Pong is on point with their visuals

Tsukimoto ;-; Why u do dis?

I was getting super hyped when he pulled ahead, but this was kinda expected I guess. At least we know who's better though.
>> ARTICLE
the music for this is great man
>> ARTICLE
Right, Ping Pong. Great stuff. Last episode we've had Smile don his super sexy robot metal samurai suit of doom, and vanquish the coach, who *loved* it. Last episode was great, with everyone shocked out of normalcy, including the ever-smug Peco. Smile is now on his road of conquest, but he only ever got on it in order to *not* be forced to go on the warpath. Let's see how this plays out.

P.S. Coach is a great character. Amazing, even.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) Unleashing the Samurai Monster:**

1. Awww, [Tsukimoto and Coach's wife](http://i.imgur.com/NnZiYQM.jpg). Each met their match. A boy who speaks his mind and won't play nice, and a nice woman who will give him affection anyway. The old lady is going to crush his defenses. Also, he only came to check the coach is fine, which he found out. Mission accomplished. *Next time*, he'll come for the company.

1. [Just look at coach here](http://i.imgur.com/hxs3jsO.jpg). It looks like some old dude in a french caf :P He knows what Smile is like. He knows Smile to be a swordsman without peer, and he's pushing him there. Coach wants to win, and he doesn't care that he'll unleash a monster. Coach and his wife Coach wants to nurture a monster, while his wife will nurture a tender boy. Too bad they share the same body.

1. The *music* of all the different players playing and training. Very well done. We skipped past the whole training regime, what was it, 6 weeks? And we're at the tournament. As Kaio's teacher had said, "In Victory we find truth." There's no reason to dwell or worry about the road. Victory or defeat, in the fires of combat we'll find what they are truly made of.

1. [Boisterous, belligerent, challenging behaviour](http://i.imgur.com/362PBBd.jpg). This is a samurai show through and through, they just happen to have tennis clubs instead of swords.

**2) On Winning, Losing, And the Caring Heart:**

1. [Everyone watches Kong, but not Smile](http://i.imgur.com/7TigYhv.jpg). Smile is playing his game. Smile doesn't wish to be here, and he'll destroy those who forced him to be here, and in so doing will grow to like this place, even as he loses reasons to be here. Kaio? He too says Smile doesn't hide his emotions. But only Coach Koizumi knows. He may not hide them, but he doesn't reveal them either. Smile unleashed isn't a different Smile, but is *more* of himself. Greater in every way. Great and terrifying.

1. "Those who consider their opponents' feelings in combat are not fit to hold a racquet. [You disgust me](http://i.imgur.com/kJPzum0.jpg)" - This is a samurai show, I'll keep saying so. And then we move to the game Smile is playing, [where he crushes his alien enemies, blowing them into tiny bits](http://i.imgur.com/iMT8hnj.jpg).

1. Smile plays a game where it's all about the scoreboard, about beating scores. Now *it's on*. And yet he sounds so detached. That's the type of monster Smile is.

1. A big deal was made of considering the opponent's feelings, of how they have wishes, of how these wishes can be *crushed*, [and now after Tsukimoto had said he'll *crush* his opponent](http://i.imgur.com/N9ApL7r.jpg), [the match is set from the opponent's perspective](http://i.imgur.com/2rIM6vQ.jpg).

1. [His opponent, the gloomy poet](http://i.imgur.com/hI1i94l.jpg), [and the visuals of this show rock](http://i.imgur.com/myBOBzy.jpg). [This was lovely, and short](http://i.imgur.com/15KE0di.jpg). This is like the toneless counting of poems or haiku in samurai films.

1. Smile had answered Kazama, but they were talking of Kong. Smile is playing tennis to pass the time. He knows crushing his enemies in this setting will deprive them of hope, but it only has meaning when they *care* for tennis. Smile cannot be crushed, because he does not care. Smile crushes his opponents, even though he doesn't care. Smile is a monster. There is understanding, but no compassion.

**3) "A Hero Can Save Us - I'm Not Gonna Stand Here and Wait:**

1. Interesting phrasing, "A hero will save me, [no matter how *deeply* I'm locked away.](http://i.imgur.com/w8Q2kpJ.jpg)" Smile knows his weakness, that he hides away, that he ends up buried. Those who save you are heroes, those who crush you are monsters. Coach is trying to unleash a *monster* though, not a hero.

1. [Dat style.](http://i.imgur.com/eJMHSCd.jpg)

1. [Engage hyper-drive](http://i.imgur.com/q3RZ03T.jpg). Man-killing machine at the ready.

1. [Tsukimoto, hero of Japan](http://i.imgur.com/cYvbv7q.jpg), will crush down the invader.

1. In the end, Tsukimoto not caring still matters, and the time he gave up early. We're only at episode 3, we've still got room to go, you know. We don't need to win the right *now*. Tsukimoto lost when China's coach shouted at him. Did he consider his opponent's feelings? He might find it "revolting" to stake your life on ping pong, but he still cares. Or is it that the coach's shouting, something he *hates*, had thrown him off balance?

**Post Episode Thoughts:**

I thought Tsukimoto would lose, once I thought mid-episode "Wait, we're on the third episode". We still have Peco's match to go through. This is a sports show. This is a friends' drama. How Peco does, and the confrontation between Peco and Smile, they *need* to happen.

Peco should know smile better than everyone else, and even he was surprised and disbelieving Smile might beat Kong. Peco sees only what he wants to. The other old hands can recognize talent.

Can't wait for next episode.

I love your comments, but I can't fully grasp the comparison with samurai shows and since you seem to have a considerable amount of knowledge about it, I would like to know which show you would recommend. Some that really shows why you compare this anime to them.
>> ARTICLE
Most of it is actually with real life samurai movies from my youth, most of which watched at movie festivals, conventions, and local cables.

Ping Pong is a manga, and has the same conventions, which also appear in basically all such manga. Pick up the currently running Vagabond, it's great. You should see what I mean.

Ah yes, it has a bit of nudity.

Nice catch on the comparison of the invasor/alien and the china guy. God, I love your comments, you catch so many details, and even say the obvious ones, which many times aren't obvious at all. Thank you!

I'm only watching now for the first time and reading these discussions retrospectively. Pls no spoilers :(
>> ARTICLE
I disagree with you too. I think Smile has emotions, and that he chooses to hide them. He's closeted, he's hiding his emotion, hence the nickname "Smile". The reason he's hiding them is because he doesn't want to draw attention to himself. He wants to fade into the background, with nobody bothering him. Ultimately, he's scared.

He's scared that if he shows his emotion, people will notice him. He idolises Peco, because Peco is not scared to put his emotion on display. It's shown in episode 2 how he wants to become like Peco. You see some of his admiration when Peco and that other guy bash heads in this episode. 

It's very interesting that we have such vastly different opinions on Smile, it shows that this anime is very thought provoking. I love it so far, it has none of that otaku stuff that most animes have, it stays true to its genre. I'm so sick of tsundere characters, fanservice and protaganists who all the girl's are attracted to. Ping pong stays very true to its intentions, without lowering it's standards for the Otaku fanbase.

>> ARTICLE
I think that's over-sensationalist that he "nearly kills" the coach. The coach nearly killed himself, it's not like he forced him to keep going. 

I personally feel like you've completely misinterpreted Smile's character. Smile is just scared, it's been said multiple times that he's scared, that's why he's not willing to show emotion. He's not willing to smile because he's scared it will gather attention, he just wants to be left alone. The coach pushes him harder and harder in episode 2 until his real self appears and he unleashes his true personality.

Smile talks to Peco about how he doesn't want to win, I see that as an excuse to hide away. He does want to win, he just refuses to let himself believe it. He talks himself down because he's scared. He's scared of letting the world know of his ambitions.  

Smile cares too much, not too little. He cares so much about Wenge's feelings that he backs off and lets him win. The problem is, he doesn't care enough about himself, only for others. The coach and player from the other school dislike this about him, because it's humiliating to win against somebody who has no desire for victory but is the better player. Smile will notice that in the upcoming episodes IMO, and he will mend his ways. 
>> ARTICLE
If your observations are this good (and the way it's written too), nobody will care for blog spam. Smile really is the anti shounen hero, and by being anti human he actually is being the only true human. Why care so much about winning? Can't we just hold hands and try living peacefully for once? I knew this since the start of the show, but i didn't realize he was jesus all along. I guess i'm just bad at recognizing tropes. http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsJesusInPurgatory
>> ARTICLE
The ending...I really hope that guy doesn't go commit suicide in the ocean.

Also man, it was great how they directed the last minutes of the match. The humming stopped as soon as Smile heard the yelling, no music, just the game going on, it's then the game turned around. Even the end it goes for the close-up of Smile and Kong's face. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious, is the chinese well spoken or they took some voice actor who were capable to pronouce not too badly chinese ?
>> ARTICLE
as far as my knowledge from Chinese is concerned, it's pretty well. Especially in the way they pronounce Wenge. Might be completely wrong though, don't take my word for it.
>> ARTICLE
Kong's VA is Chinese, so I'm guessing it is pretty accurate.
>> ARTICLE
I think the voice actor is fluent in chinese because he's a native speaker, actually. [Link to his MAL listing] (http://myanimelist.net/people/29835/Yousei_Bun)
>> ARTICLE
You can basically consider them completely native, and good voice actors on top of that. You can speak accurate Mandarin and still have bad acting, but their acting isn't awkward to listen to at all. Even the wording used in their lines is very natural. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm Chinese and the VAs for the coach and Wen Ge are definitely by people who're native or near native speakers.  I literally don't even read the subs I just listen and I can understand them easily; it's that good.  
>> ARTICLE
So, basically I put off watching this show until about 2am on Wednesday night, watched a few minutes of the 1st episode, and now I'm hooked. The animation is glorious, it reminds me of the fucking terrifying stuff I watched as a child, like Watership Down, in just how much character goes into them. Also, the use of music in general is amazing. This is one that I will want the OST for after I thinks. 


As for this episode, we got more of an insight as to who our major players will be in the season. The other school's team captain is an interesting one. He's right to say that Tsukimoto's play style disgusts him, but why would he still be trying to recruit him? In competitive sports, ruthlessness is needed, and unless he has something that can make Tsukimoto wake up, isn't it all a bit futile?


Kong's development continues to be strong here. His emotional instability and arrogance likely is something to do with his fall from grace. It's understandable that he want's to return to china and follow his dream, but ultimately, Tsukimoto letting him win is crueler in a sense. Talent doesn't go to those who want it the most. 


Overall, I regret putting off watching this straight away. This episode was great, this show is great.


>> ARTICLE
The animation quality went up drastically. It's so fluid and the use of CG was astounding.


I think they know about the 3 episode rule guys
>> ARTICLE
They also probably want to show that the reason theyre animating like they are isnt because their lazy or bad at it but because of a stylistic choice.
>> ARTICLE
I do wonder if what they're doing could be an interesting approach to conserving animation budget.
>> ARTICLE
Na, its just keeping more in line with the more realistic/grotesque style the manga goes with
>> ARTICLE
It's not style, it's a way of life!
>> ARTICLE
This anime seriously likes to split the screen, heh.
>> ARTICLE
I'm liking the animation style more and more. Pacing is also great for now!
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so I know that both Peco and Smile are sharing the spot light, but from the first episode I was thinking Peco would be the "main" MC... But after all the attention on Smile, I'm having some doubts. Can anyone enlighten me, preferably without referring to the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes shows pull a fast one.

Peco is a supporting character, in the classic meaning, he is there to illuminate aspects of the main character's personality, and to help drive the story forward. Peco is Smile's history, what he wanted to be, and the reason he's playing to lose. Peco is the emotional crescendo we're building towards, and the step that once Smile passes, especially if it's at first rejection and then acceptance, he could conquer the world.

Note: Hadn't read the manga/watched the movie, that's just how these stories quite often play out.
>> ARTICLE
Dem foils once again, and Peco is a good one.

I particularly noted how he's so perceptive of Smile's changes.  He responded to Smile being unusually emotional prior to the match, and you see him just sitting quietly in the stands watching a match between two monsters -- one of whom he naively thought he could compete with.

I imagine this changes everything about the relationship between Smile and Peco, and I'm eagerly waiting to see how they both adjust as a result.  The next episode should be a good character builder for Peco, I hope.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, okay. I guess that makes sense. Still, it just seems a bit off to me...
>> ARTICLE
I love recognizing voice actors. The guy who wanted to go to the sea I believe was played by Kenjiro Tsuda, the same guy who played Vince in Space Brothers.

The opening is amazing. Can't wait for the full version.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite episode of the series thus far.

Animation was top notch. Loved the new OP. The episode opens with a rhythm of Ping Pong noises. The competition vibe was there. Multiple perspectives. The match between Kong and Smile. The result.

If the rest of the series is like this or even *better* then this anime is going to be on my *list*.
>> ARTICLE
This is the sort of show that keeps anime at some degree of respectability, it's fucking brilliant.

The 'hand drawn' style is so crude and full of character, it's really beautiful, fitting of the themes of the show - I hate shows that are glossed over. It's quite similar in style to Tekkonkinkreet.

Ping Pong is just the tool allowing you to empathise with the characters, the overall themes of the show can be applied to the majority of peoples' lives. Peco I can relate with the most. He continues to put forward a ridiculous facade in the hopes that he can forget his inferiority to those with *talent*. No amount of effort or money will allow you to obtain that 'spark'.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like they blew the animation budget on a few cuts and the OP. And what an OP it was!

As much as everyone acts like Smile is a robot, he's actually more of a hero. Super strong, cares way too much about others, and willingly sacrifices himself for them. He's like Japanese Ping Pong Jesus.

Something tells me Kong knows Smile went easy on him, and he wont be happy about it.
>> ARTICLE
A win is a win in the record books but as far as sportsmanship goes it's insulting. I smell a conflict incoming with Tsukimoto and Kong. Nobody wants to win like that even if it means that your competitive dream is still intact. 
>> ARTICLE
Smile doesnt care. The other guy valued the game way to highly, and failure would brutalise him. Smile recognises its really dumb to bet your life on something inconsequential like ping pong, but he's kind enough to throw in the event that thats what you've done rather than take a life to prove a point.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone please clarify some confusion I have?

From what I saw, Smile was up 2 games to 1 (in a best of 5 I guess?). Then it looks like Kong wins a game and takes the series. Are there rules I'm not understanding, or is it inferred that Kong just won two games in a row to take it 3-2? 
>> ARTICLE
Kong won 2 games in a row, but they dont show it. There is no rule which can make you win 2 games by just winning 1.
>> ARTICLE
Dammit Mr. Tsukimoto.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so glad the guy at the end made it to the beach. Loved that dude.
>> ARTICLE
He went full human. I would've loved to have seen him do his robot thing, but his consideration for other players proved to be way too much.

I probably would've done the same. After all, Smile really don't have much on the line compared to Wenge.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Gonna have to disagree with you entirely on this one.

Smile is *very* human in this episode, especially in comparison to the past two episodes. While he doesn't care about winning or losing so much, he actually does care about other people, despite not showing it out right. That much is quite obvious. Lets try to not associate incredible passiveness with being a robot, either. He may be calculating and cold, but his consideration for other people is very much present and what makes him very human this episode. Consideration is empathy. Empathy is an extremely human emotion. But, it seems to me that he is only considerate because it is most logical, thus making himself seem like a robot. His incredibly passive personality also feeds the image of his robot like persona. But he himself is not being a robot by any means, he's just dressing up like one.

What I meant by doing his robot thing was being merciless. He could've won the match regardless of what happened on Wenge's side of the table if he'd gone robo-mode. Not because he had the intention to win, but because he would feel no mercy and not consider the other person's position.

>  The only reason he allows Wen'ge to win is because he himself DOESN'T CARE about winning.

Pretty similar to what I said, Smile really doesn't have much on the line compared to Wenge. He doesn't have any grand title or reputation, so it doesn't matter whether he wins or loses. He's ok with giving the game to someone who's actually got something to lose. He gives the win to Wenge out of empathy.

He was incredibly human this episode form the very beginning, simply by showing he actually does care about other people.
>> ARTICLE
But what about the way he treated the coach's wife? He really seem just to be an egoistic and cold person, who ended accidentaly on the "good path". Seeing other people cry bothers him, so he avoids winning. He knows the coachs wife won't cry, so he just disregards her, since actually staying would be boring. But after seeing how nice she is, he realises that devoting some time to her would make him happy, so he actually truly says he will visit again. I think this can be wrong too though, so I really look forward to this anime, let's see how it will develop.
>> ARTICLE
Lots and lots of interesting panelling this week. The scene where Dragon and Akuma were speaking in the bathroom and Smile tapping his foot turning into the overlapping panels before his match with Kong really stick out to me. I imagine it's a good cost cutting measure, but it gets used so effectively. I also loved Smile's humming throughout the match with Kong, it ramped up as the match did, but it's still that same old song from episode one. Once again, this show is just so well constructed.
>> ARTICLE
Im loving the different take with Smile as the protagonist. Usually in sports shows, they'll be strong but cocky, or weak but improve with effort. Smile is strong, but he chooses not to win. Having his personality clash against those with actual desire to win makes for a kind of surreal feel to the show, as we are generally not presented with this kind of character.
>> ARTICLE
Not available in the US for crunchyroll? ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Funimation has it in the US.
>> ARTICLE
Really great episode. I thought it was neat how Kong's theme played as he was dominating, but he got dumpstered as soon as Smile started humming. I wonder what it was he was humming. Anyway, Smile clearly still needs to take everyone's advice and be a little less nice. I think the repeated metaphor with Kong and the airplane is really great. Kong's play IS the airplane because it's what will get him home. 
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoy this anime personally, because my personality is pretty similar to the mc's, really annoys me that my friend doesnt wanna watch this show because of the animation style though
>> ARTICLE
DAT OP.

Wow.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the manga style sequences in this one. It's a really ingenious way to incorporate every aspect of a competition in the same frame. Reminds me of the way actual sports broadcasts use split screen. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god, the match between Wenge and Smile were perfect. That bit about Smile dropping a game to download Wenge's play style, then withdrawing into his shell and basically playing solitaire ping pong using the data he collected for the rest of the match is so similar to how FGC commentators describe the highest level of competitive fighting game play. I'm in love with this show.
>> ARTICLE
I just love Masaaki Yuasa's use of metaphors, both visually and in the dialogue. He leaves small hints at what's going on before telling it to you directly shortly afterwards, it's a small mental exercise for the us.
>> ARTICLE
I'm used to seeing the drama of a match more technically visualised in sports anime, so that you can follow exactly how the players react to each other. This show takes that half a step towards abstraction, opting to convey the feeling of the match instead. There were only a couple moments when they chose to illustrate Smile's strategy of aiming for a specific spot, and in small panels to boot. I think the departure from sports anime tropes mostly works for the show's style, but I do hope they bring out more of the mechanics in the important matches.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't expecting Tsukimoto to be outclassing Kong so easily. As much of a dick Kong might be, it's clear that he's put a lot more effort and training into ping pong, and to have Tsukimoto's "natural talent" beating that is a little disappointing - in real life, dedication and hard work usually trumps talent any day.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree. Having less natural talent just makes working hard harder, and you get much less gains for much more effort. Kongs more serious about Ping Pong but both boys have played it for a while. Smile has the natural talent advantage and Kong was let down by his pride
>> ARTICLE
Dat Tsukimoto humming though.
>> ARTICLE
He is a chirpy little slayer of men.
>> ARTICLE
Can't think of the last time i enjoyed a Sports anime this much. Ping pong really is something else
>> ARTICLE
Jesus christ, the segment immediately after the OP ended, with the ping pong beat and the images scrolling and lighting up and playing soundbites as they went was phenomenal

I love this

The most beautiful direction ever

Oh god
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, that OP is fantastic.  Yuasa loves ugly beauty.

This show keeps getting better.
>> ARTICLE
Noo~!
>> ARTICLE
Finally the op is finished and it looks amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Tsukimoto's strong sympathy for his opponents is a big weakness but equally so is his view of ping pong as something inconsequential to him. Even if he can become a stonecold player there's really not much that drives him to win, after all this is just a hobby to him. Once he meets his match talentwise he wouldn't have as much resolve as someone who loves the sport, committed to excellence and have a strong will to win.

Weirdly enough Tsukimoto reminds me of Nodame (a pianist) from Nodame Cantabile. Both are talented at their craft but for differing reasons they have trouble committing to it and seeing it as more than a hobby.
>> ARTICLE
Why should he commit? Its ok to do things just for fun. I think throwing the game like he did was a really noble thing to do. I would prefer Smile adopt a more positive view on life, not just doing things in the time before he dies, but recognising the importance other people place on the games throwing them is admirable I think.
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't have to commit and it might remain that way but I'm just pointing it out that it's a weakness.

Throwing a game is disrespectful to the opponent since it belittles their effort and pride. I highly doubt Kong would appreciate being pitied like that.
>> ARTICLE
In terms of a weakness at playing ping pong, yeah if he was a merciless Robot slayer of men like he was last episode he'd be better. BUT AT WHAT COST!?

I dont think Kong would appreciate being belittled like that, but I think his table tennis career being abruptly ended would sting worse. If he realises that he only one because Smile was pulling punches, he can build himself up from that, learn some humility. A second second chance.
>> ARTICLE
anybody know what song is playing around 7 minutes onward? pretty damn awesome

We were so close to a breakthrough. But Smile went back into his shell.

The hero hasn't come yet, Smile.

wow that opening is so sexy
>> ARTICLE
Copied from my [blarg](http://flightlesstakeoff.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/spring-2014-week-4/): 

You know, if there's one thing about the show that I really enjoy, it's how wondrous it is. Honestly, I really can't think of a proper word for it. Realistic seems too serious, slice-of-life doesn't seem serious enough, and relatable seems too trivial. This show is life itself, with no underhanded motives or agenda about it. Yeah, it focuses on table tennis, but table tennis isn't why this show is good. It would be impressive enough if it were just the ping pong, but it has something even stronger, the characters.

It's rare to see such nuanced and believable characters in anime these days. Yeah, the art is "ugly", but that's entirely beautiful in a sense. Real life isn't nearly as pristine and "beautiful" as anime is, but there's beauty to be found in real life. The struggles of people as they try to find a purpose to living. Or even something even smaller than that, just trying to meaning in what one's doing. Why am I sitting through school, taking classes I don't care about? Why do I hang out with people I don't really like? Why does Smile play ping pong really?

Everyone in this show is a person, not a convenience to the plot. Kong isn't here as the super-rival-motivating-factor, he's here because he screwed up somewhere in China, and was sent here. And understandably, he's not happy about it. Even the player who Smile beat has his own problems, he's unmotivated, confused as to where he wants to go. And in the end he gives up and ends up where he thinks he wants to go. But it's obvious to us that it's not really where he'd rather be. He's simply wandering. But of course, it's easy to see from an outside perspective. In reality, everyone struggles internally, we just choose not to see it.

On a side note, here's my (rough) translations for Kong's coach's little peptalk; I didn't agree with the translations given too much. Perhaps they translate directly from the subtitles? 

Coach: "There's no way back, Wenge! If you lose this match, then it's really over! Don't you know that? Step it up, and show the people who kicked you out what you're really made of! Stop fooling around! Are you listening?"

Kong: "I'm listening." (Yeah is more conversational so that fact that Kong used a full sentence shows how genuine his response is to his coach's seriousness)

Coach: "You're not freaking here for sightseeing, you idiot!"

I was hoping they'd blur reality even more by having Smile engage thrusters when he dived for that ball. Woulda been a great visual treat. But, I guess he has to restrain himself a little, eh?

I respect Yuasa for restraining his madness, while he isn't my favourite director (Hideaki Anno / Akiyuki Shinbou), he is without doubt the most talented, refined and dare I say *the best* director I have seen the work of.

With the whole transformation scene with the 8 bit imagery you can just feel the style of this anime is still being restrained for now. It's going to get crazy for the eyes soon and I can't wait.

Since when did Chitanda Eru turn into a cute [old man](http://i.imgur.com/PRkW2z3.jpg)? Even [I'm curious](http://i.imgur.com/WIlUE26.jpg).

Well, this episode was fun, it definitely was all smiles from the beginning to the end. Normally, I would find what would basically be considered a battle-shounen powerup a vapid, expected character development, but the writing in this show is so on point it's hard to not at least appreciate it. 

You simply can't overstate how sharp and powerful the banter and dialogue is- the well written lines really gives **Ping Pong** the dexterity to illustrate such a simple, predictable sequence of events in such an entertaining fashion.    
I gotta say, Masaaki Yuasa, your delivery is entirely on point. 11-0.

[This one frame in particular had me in stitches.](http://i.imgur.com/zzXCcrj.jpg) *Your chuunibyou is leaking, Smile.*

You might be wondering- I've seen that island before in *Tsuritama*! You're right, it's [Enoshima Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoshima), the small island that served as a model for *Spirited Away* just a few stops away from Kamakura, the setting of *Elfen Lied*, *Squid Girl*, and a few other anime. I just happened to have written [a post about it on /r/trueanime](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/233qgx/tuesday_nonanime_discussion_thread_415/cgtdhrr).

To continue the trend, let's have some webms (warning- there's audio):

1. [**14:05.064 - 14:22.830** - *Wan-wan-wan!*](http://a.pomf.se/cszxwm.webm)
2. [**15:26.388 - 15:45.611** - Playing the Opponent](http://a.pomf.se/qbwyka.webm)
3. [**18:24.800 - 18:24.800** - Full throttle. Restrictions lifted.](http://a.pomf.se/qzdydg.webm)
>> ARTICLE
Chitanda seems the same as he was in the manga as far as I can see. I agree with your comments on the writing, first episode was good and this episode held that torch very well.
>> ARTICLE
When you learn about Enoshima Island, you start noticing it in every anime. It's not as popular as Akihabara and a few other places, but it's definitively one that come back very often.  [Tari Tari](http://i.imgur.com/l4llZA3.jpg) took place near the island, and so did [Natsuyaki Rendez-Vous](http://i.imgur.com/ZznvoNw.jpg).  And  here is  [Tsuritama](http://i.imgur.com/LflwmXN.jpg)'s and [Ping Pong](http://i.imgur.com/4Zeok84.jpg)'s version of the island.

It's pretty fun to compare all these different styles to the real one from [google street](http://i.imgur.com/gVE590i.jpg). It gives a whole new dimension to the place.


>> ARTICLE
I adore Yuasa, but I feel like we should be giving more credit to Matsumoto than we have been.  The source manga is supposed to be great, from what I hear, and it shows in the writing and character development.
>> ARTICLE
That's always what happens with anime (and movies), the director gets all the attention. (Just look at Watanabe Shinichirou getting all the credit not only for Bebop and others, but also for Kids on the Slope, which was basically the manga abridged and animated.)

That said, I think in this case Yuasa adds a lot to the (apparently already excellent) source material, so the credit is not undeserved.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, this show keeps on impressing. There's none of your typical shounen believe-in-yourself motivational nonsense here - Tsukimoto just wants to be left alone but reaches his breaking point after being pushed by a stubborn old man who sees his talent. He doesn't behave admirably, but does behave in a very human way.

Some of the coach's lines this episode were top-notch:

> ["You can't cross the sea on such thin wings."](http://i.imgur.com/L2leTla.png)

and

> ["There are some views you can't see until you stand at the top."](http://i.imgur.com/jU4G43j.png)
>> ARTICLE
> believe-in-yourself motivational nonsense

Sure it's overplayed in the sports genre (across all mediums) but I wouldn't call it nonsene. Top athletes don't reach the highest level of their craft without self-confidence, self-motivation and being pushed by someone.

Solid story, solid characters, exceptional pacing. Let's see how long before Smile unveils his might and takes on King Kong, who dethroned Mr. Peco.

**Episode:**

**1) Reintroductions. Retreading Old Pathways:**

1. [Peco is a whiny brat](http://i.imgur.com/zKxL2w2.jpg). He's used to always winning, so he values his winning as an important 
core of himself, and now it's been taken away from him. This is why Smile always lets him win, but him being like this is also a *result* of Smile letting him win.

1. Interesting, [Peco is introduced *again*](http://i.imgur.com/HxbovKw.jpg). In a manga, it's a form of recap. Is this a nod to the manga-source, or showing us a "new Peco"?

 [Kong introduced again](http://i.imgur.com/mm3nc4O.jpg). Kong is in rage, Peco is in dire mood. And Smile unlike both of them will show no emotion.

1. Hm. [Smile is locked in a closet, so he's weaving a tale that he wants to be there](http://i.imgur.com/BzLMb4d.jpg). Smile doesn't show feelings, he wants to be like a robot. He doesn't want to be released. He doesn't want to be found. He doesn't want others to see his shame, and to give his tormentors access to him again.

 Oooooh, that was *young* Smile. Smile seems cold, but he thinks of himself as someone with fire flowing through his veins, he thinks of himself as a hero (ally of justice). Smile is biding his time. He has glasses and seems calm, right? [He's *Superman*. And then he'll go all-out. He's hiding his true self from the world.](http://i.imgur.com/NGkXOfc.jpg)

**2) Relationships are Hard. Two Tales of Unrequited Love:**

1. 5 am, "I'm proposing to you here." "No problem, I'm the devoted husband kind." First, it's nice to see that indeed, the coach knows what's up, and had picked up on it, after all, I began seeing how things are between Smile and Peco from his off-hand comment last episode. Second, he's such a charming old man ;-)

1. ["Sucks to be you, getting harassed by the upperclassmen whenever I skip."](http://i.imgur.com/80jTDTt.jpg) And he keeps skipping, *what a friend*!

1. ["Nonsense! What good can high school English do for anyone!"](http://i.imgur.com/OI7UGTp.jpg) - Says *the English teacher*. Now it makes sense why the coach keeps spicing his speech with English words. And what he cares for.

1. ["Ping pong and English are both just ways to kill time until I die."](http://i.imgur.com/qChHNtP.jpg) Wow, Smile sure is *something*. He's a kid, and he's just sulking. What happened to the kid with fire in his veins saved by flying birdman? :D

1. Wait, is this coach his devoted husband, [or his devoted mother](http://i.imgur.com/WWoEQxk.jpg)? Sure is devoted, though.

 [Oh my, "Virgo" and pink for the teacher-coach's introduction](http://i.imgur.com/V6kG8Ki.jpg) ;-) Well, he's fired up with the desire to win, with feeling he can finally bring forth change and victory, I guess. They also spoke of it being Spring, so it might be pink for the sakura trees near Fuji mountain.

**3) An Ode to Non-involvement, *with life*:**

1. "I'm only in it for the fun. Fun is enough." You don't look like you're having fun. Tying it up to what you said before, Smile, it seems to you "fun" means "Not suffering". You're doing Ping Pong or English, things with rules, to run away from suffering.

1. "I don't want to sacrifice things or drag people to win." I see, it's like when I played tennis, he wants the endless back and forth, what people use to warm up. [He wants to lose himself in the endless flow, which one side winning would break.](http://i.imgur.com/QLPCYul.jpg)

1. More introductions. [The gopher](http://i.imgur.com/vijdM35.jpg). Oh, that's a badass, so the *gimp* from Pulp Fiction.

1. "For me, it's simple. I hate losing. So I want to win, and I don't care what happens to the other side." "That's a cool line, Peco. I'll root for you."

 LOL. You never know whether to take Smile's word for anything, with his deadpan voice, but man, Peco indeed has "Type A" personality, the sort you need to win. Now we just need to implant Peco's personality in Smile's body.

**4) Full-Robo Samurai-Showdown!:**

1. [Time for a face-off!](http://i.imgur.com/Sh4D7Ic.jpg) Oh man, but Coach is a smart one! Smile says he doesn't care about winning, and what Coach is trying to teach him is the drive to win, so even if he "loses" to Smile, he'll achieve his goal. In actually agreeing to play, Smile gives Coach what he wanted.

1. [A shift to the butterfly](http://i.imgur.com/oX3eseP.jpg), this is like Wenge and his coach's analysis of the game, something taken straight out of a samurai manga.

 [And we even have analysis from the sidelines, as well as the coach's narrative](http://i.imgur.com/Ih4a7nC.jpg). This is exactly like samurai shows :D And they take it seriously, Peco, Smile and Coach, the serious fighters, the one who fight, rather than just play in dojos. Coach is putting on an act, and the regular students don't understand it's psychological warfare.

1. [No hero, full machine?](http://i.imgur.com/b8pmJgN.jpg) Accept your weakness, and turn it into your strength, rather than hoping to change from one end of the spectrum to the other? Hm. Hmmmmm.

1. [As Coach is defeated, it's a *love song*, his defeat is Smile's serenade to him](http://i.imgur.com/rkOnvOE.jpg). He didn't care about the victory, as much as the game being played, which is exactly what Smile wanted to keep going. Yes, their game is a dialogue of sweet nothings to Coach, even as it's the crunch of metallic boots for Smile.

1. Smile says he wants to be like Peco. Peco doesn't care about his vanquished enemies. Smile thinks that's cool. Smile defeats Coach and just leaves.

**Post Episode Thoughts:**

This was one of the most beautiful samurai fights I've ~~read~~ watched in a very long while.

Coach is a great character.

Smile is pretty great as well. Peco is having his eyes being opened, now that the blinders are removed. This was a great episode. Kaio came, but he didn't care for little-boy Peco, only for cold-robot Smile. Cold-robot Smile, which houses a nuclear reactor within his heart. Superman bird? The nuclear reaction will burn you up, cold fission for you!

Smile's power is from accepting who he is, rather than denying it. Change, or lack of it? Uncertain. Need more data.

([You can see my notes for episode 1 of Ping Pong here.](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/ping-pong-the-animation-episode-1-notes/))
>> ARTICLE
Seeing as how there's a broom in the cleaning tools locker door thing, I think it might be Smile being bullied trying to deny the fact that he's being bullied and likes it in the locker. 

At least that was how I saw it, instead of him "hiding in his shell"
>> ARTICLE
Err, my point is it's the exact same thing.

He's creating a shell and acting as if it's fine there. The shell of indifference, of self-sufficiency. The shell he created where he has no emotions, and thus can't be hurt.

First episode was good. It got me interested in the show and raised my expectations for the show. 

But this episode... Something about it just blew me away. The amazing soundtrack is definitely worth mentioning, but the match this episode had ALL of my attention. The entire focus around Smile's character is what made it shine. This might become my AOTS now. (Sorry JoJo...)

No worries. JoJo takes the AOTY.

Well that was just *great*.
>> ARTICLE
Copied from my [barg](http://flightlesstakeoff.wordpress.com/2014/04/18/spring-2014-week-3/): 

A confession, I read this manga, but I speed-read it, so I didnt really get much except the main plot points. But honestly, Im still going to enjoy the anime because of the beautiful visuals and the sound of Kongs voice actor.

Kongs still frustrated and looking for a challenge like Smile. But Smile doesnt have any desire to play him or even get better in general. It turns out Smile was bullied when he was younger, but was saved by a hero. A hero named Peco. A very common thing actually, for kids who are bullied, to lose confidence and find it in another inspiring person. Enter the Hero, indeed. Its not surprising Smile defers to Peco so much. For Smile, he exists only to pass time and chase after Peco. When Peco wants to quit, he even tells him that theres no need to force yourself because ping pong is not the issue, Peco is. And even though he says he wants to be like Peco, Smile shows no desire to actually achieve that. After all, its easier to admire and fantasize becoming a hero than to exert effort and reach that pedestal. Hes a robot constantly repeating actions, but with no feelings whatsoever behind them.

But his coach, Koizumi, sees his potential. And he wants to awaken it. His coachs love and dedication is endearing actually. Not only does he use English randomly and funnily, but hes completely serious about what he says. Hes definitely an experienced old-timer who knows how important a strong heart is needed to survive. The world is not so kind as to allow someone like Smile to exist peacefully. Unless he gains some drive, the world will grind him down to nothing. And ping pong is somewhat of an allegory for that.

Koizumi does fall during his match with Smile. But although his fall seems like a traditional defeat of a master by his student to symbolize a student surpassing the master, its not. Koizumi simply provoked Smile enough to care about winning, which is exactly what he wanted. Koizumi may have lost the match but hes won the battle. Even if Smile only felt passion for a little bit, thats all that matters.
>> ARTICLE
When they did the battle to get him to enjoy winning, I was very skeptical and was about to say Initial D clone, 10 years too late. But the way they executed it just gave me chills. I love how he just straight up flips and breaks from being a passive bitch to total bm. It was great.
>> ARTICLE
A much better episode than the previous one, using imagery like the butterfly and the robot did a lot to improve my enjoyment of the show, and Smile is just generally a really interesting character, especially when compared to the kind of characters you usually see in sports shows.
>> ARTICLE
Extremely nice character development. Tsukimoto's last line of "I'm going on ahead, Peco" really shows just how much he's transformed in a single episode. Nicely done.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I'm a bit disappointed that there isn't really an OP sequence and it's just scenes from the episode, but this show is looking so good I can't really complain. Smile is such a great character.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this is on the fast-track for AOTY. And in the year of yuri, that is truly a feat (EDIT: unless we also get *Yuri Kuma Arashi* this year, in which case even Ping Pong doesn't have a chance).

I knew this show was going to be inventive and interesting, exploring sports anime thematic turf about passion, what it means to win or lose, etc. in insightful ways (like it clearly does with Peco - usually when a character loses and then ends up in a pathetic pile of tears we're supposed to sympathise for them and hope they bounce back as a new and improved stronger person, but with Peco it just seems like the necessary result of his immature and egotistical babbling) but I *did not* expect the level of psychological complexity that comes from Smile. We don't usually get to see any multi-layered quiet and passive protagonists who don't make a spectacle out of their withdrawn personality, but Smile shows us fear of others, admiration for Peco, and existential anxiety and resignation. Smile for protagonist of the season.

Not only that but this series is just straight-up *funny*. In fact, I think it's elicited more out-loud laughs from me than any of the *comedy* series this season. The humour is handled so expertly - there aren't any simple comic relief characters, they all have something substantial to contribute (plus, every time I see Akuma's character design I crack up; the one shot of [him in middle school](http://i.imgur.com/RdAXpNc.jpg) this episode was just too much).
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been following much anime lately. What makes this year the year of yuri? Just curious.
>> ARTICLE
Well actual yuri (rather than implied yuri) tends to pop up only very occasionally (less than once a year). This year we had Sakura Trick in the winter season, Akuma no Riddle and Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san this season, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya 2wei (which, according to manga readers, starts to get a lot of actual yuri) will air in the summer season, a Yuru Yuri OVA was announced for some time this year, and potentially Yuri Kuma Arashi. That's more than one yuri-themed or yuri-heavy show per season, and there's been plenty of yuri popping up in non-yuri shows too. Hence, 2014: the year of glorious yuri.
>> ARTICLE
More anime to add to my to-watch list. :D

Any more good shows of this sort that you can recommend that are not from this year?
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean sports anime like Ping Pong or yuri anime? If you're looking for good sports anime I'm definitely not the person to ask (except that I'd recommend *Chihayafuru* which is about karuta).

But with yuri, on the other hand, I may be able to help...

*Strawberry Panic* (2006) is a classic of the genre. It's beautifully emotional with lots of great character development and just the right amount of comedy and anime tropes sprinkled in, so it certainly deserves that classic status. However it's very, very melodramatic (like, soap opera level dramatic - there's amnesia, overly dramatic love triangles, fits of mirror-breaking rage, etc).

The previous seasons of *Yuru Yuri* (2011-) are often touted as *the* great example of yuri comedy. It's good, but if you don't like the style of comedy there's not much else in there.

*Maria-sama ga Miteru* (2004-09) is another dramatic classic, albeit a much, much more subtle on the yuri/lesbian themes and a lot less soapy than *Strawberry Panic*. The character and relationship development in this series is what truly shines.

*Revolutionary Girl Utena* (1997) is a true classic, though yuri isn't necessarily the *main* theme. It's an almost perfect adventure/drama series with lots of aesthetic and narrative experimentation and feminist themes; but if you can't swallow the old-school shoujo aesthetic it may be difficult to get into.

But my personal favourite yuri series by far is *Aoi Hana* (2009), but this is pretty controversial. Some people see it as a bit of a rip off of *Sasameki Koto* (also 2009) which also gets lots of praise (which is really weird, because the source material for *Aoi Hana* started long before the source material for *Sasameki Koto*). In my opinion, while *Sasameki Koto* has some great content and story, the execution can be downright pitiful at times (lazy animation, cutting corners on art, lukewarm voice-acting). *Aoi Hana* on the other hand is a beautifully told story with a really realistic set of developing relationships and gorgeous art (particularly the watercolour backgrounds).

Those are the first openly yuri series that I'd recommend, there are a few other notable ones, and plenty of series with implied yuri too (it's becoming more and more frequent for magical girl series to have yuri elements).
>> ARTICLE
I can't usually stand too much drama because they frustrate the hell out of me. But I'll check some of those out too. Thanks! :P
>> ARTICLE
> unless we also get Yuri Kuma Arashi this year

The manga was kind of disappointing to be honest. Of course it's only one chapter, so I can't really make a judgement at this point.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain the hype behind Ping Pong to me? I don't really get what's so amazing about the visuals. 
>> ARTICLE
have you even watched it?. If you did and you still don't understand it, then you have some shit taste, go back to watch haremshit and low quality shnens, maybe some day you can actually enjoy something good 
>> ARTICLE
It's a hot-blooded sports anime! What's not to get hyped about? You have all the awesome stuff like:

* Childhood rival / the team ace (Peco)
* Mysterious powerful rival (China)
* Unbeatable opponent from high-end highschool (Baldy)
* Middleschool rival (guy who beat Smile in the tournament)
* Dramatic glasses readjustments
* Hidden power level MC
* People with strong enough power levels that they can detect the hidden potential of MC
* Badass antihero protagonist (did you see how he manhandled the coach after transforming into a robot?)
* Crazy training programs (both for Smile and China)
* Visuals are unlike anything else, and have a lot of exaggeration and absurdity to them
* Side-splitting humour
* Yuasa directing

It's like a shounen sports manga, but it looks different and is actually based on a seinen manga, which allows people to be okay with enjoying it because its more artistic that way.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I find the art style to be incredibly gorgeous. The use of expressive, rough lines gives a lot of life to the scenes, especially when combined with Yuasa's god-tier directing
>> ARTICLE
It's been hyped for the director behind it, who's behind a number of highly respected shows.

We focus on the execution of the directing, on the acting, not on how the art looks, which is... *distinct*, which is more than could be said for most shows.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the answer. 
>> ARTICLE
i like the op, i wish the entire anime was in black and white

the ed is really good, too
>> ARTICLE
The colors in the outside segment, when they passed by the shore, looked very nice.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like they change a bit of the OP each episode to include scenes from it in different colors and/or sped up, which is really neat. A little more real life ping pong strategy showing up too. I hope the matchup between Kong and Smile isn't too far off, I want to see a lot of matches between them.
>> ARTICLE
Koizumi, mai waifu!

Brilliant. Last episode was good but this is just brilliant. Who would've thought that you can develop a character in such short time. Coach just unleashed the robot.

Easily the most interesting sports anime ive watched for a long time

Coach is gonna be ok right?
>> ARTICLE
I love finally getting to see Smile actually playing. The visuals for this show are intense. Really pretty and really ugly at the same time. Also the characters have been pretty 3d so far, although none of them have been given the time ti develop yet
>> ARTICLE
Real TD;LR: Just get over the art style and watch it.
>> ARTICLE
2nd best anime of 2014 after Hunter x Hunter (2011)
>> ARTICLE
I had heard really great things about this anime and yes the art did turn me off at first but I figured hell there's that much raving about it then it would be worth checking out.  Well I dropped it 4 episodes into  the series.  I just couldn't get interested in it.  Sorry guys I tried. 
>> ARTICLE
You have to finish it to understand it's excellence. It's main focus is consious development of completely different characters, which you won't get from 4 episodes at all. It's only 7 more episodes, 2 and a half hour is not a big additional time investment so go for it.
Also the first four eps don't represent the rest of the show accurately, it changes and evolves a lot by the end and focuses less on the sport and more on the characters.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry if I can't get interested in an 11 episode series after watching a full third of it I have to say its just not for me.  There is way to much other content that I enjoy that I would rather fill those 2 and a half hours with.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm just saying that those 4 episodes don't reflect the rest of the series at all. It's about the payoff. Those couple of episodes are a lot better time investment than the whole series of Cross Ange or Aldnoah.Zero or most of this season for example. 
>> ARTICLE
So the ending makes it better than series that haven't finished yet?  Might want to compare it to something else.  
>> ARTICLE
the ending makes it better than the rest of generic anime coming out. 

this is the best anime ive watched in a year
>> ARTICLE
I'm the only one who find that art was great not just the director respect the art of the manga but deliver it in original and very amusing way.

No, you're not.

You really should have phased that as a question instead of a statement.

I think that's what he meant to do, in his defence the way this is written suggests English isn't his first language.

I can agree with that as the most likely outcome of this.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who hasn't seen Ping Pong, it's one of my biggest gripes that people refuse to watch it because of the art style. It's not the highest quality, and yes, the action can look a bit strange, but in between those parts, it's absolutely fucking gorgeous and unique. [Look at this shit, that's just a damn incredible shot.](https://shibirerudarou.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/horriblesubs-ping-pong-the-animation-02-720p-mkv_snapshot_16-19_2014-04-18_14-19-14.jpg)

What do you mean about it not being the highest quality? I thought it was fantastic. They accomplished exactly what they intended.

I've seen some screenshots of frames that can't be attributed to the style - obvious budget issues, in other words. But as far as I know they're few and far between, and what few there were weren't terrible.

I had no idea people hated the art style. It's stylistic and fitting; it would be like complaining about Zetsubou Sensei. Do people really get upset when anime doesn't look like generic KyoAni stuff?

>> ARTICLE
Don't Dead, Open Inside

The best TL;DR imo is that "it's not a sports anime but an anime about the characters who play ping pong and their motivations, dreams, and aspirations for doing so."

Definitely the AOTY for 2014, excluding HxH (2011), and a must watch for anyone who's interested in some of the best character development I've ever seen. The intro to the OP is also the most hype thing I've ever heard and always got me excited to watch it each week when it was airing!

Ping Pong is one of my favorite anime, it did almost everything right.

Every character is amazing and the actual ping pong games are very nicely animated and intense. Characters' struggles and conclusions were executed so well that they actually made me cry(which happened with like 5 shows in total)

The opening is my second favorite OP ever, Hero Theme[[hype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohdLiyiY-Nw)] is probably the best track I've ever heard and the ED is one of the best as well. Overall the music is perfect

Only problem I had with it was Dragon's storyline which I found quite boring, I just didn't care. Also Wenge is objectively best boy.

That being said, I am not sure how much Ping Pong deserves a WT considering how new it is. Most people already know about it and how well received it is.

True.  Then again, that can apply to a lot of the other WTs too.

Wow. Little disheartening to see so many people diss sports anime in order to praise Ping Pong. Ping Pong indeed is a masterful show, but sports anime is a really solid subgenre as well. I think there's a lot of misconceptions about sports anime going around.

I fucking love the voice acting. It really saddens me that a lot of people missed it because they can't handle reading and listening at the same time. But at least they watched it. You can really hear the emotion in the voices. 

And it was really interesting to hear chinese, especially in contrast to japanese.

The OST is superb!

?? people cant read and listen at the same time? i just listen to the tone of the voice and end up remembering it as them speaking the english words in the japanese voices

This is one of those shows that I think piling it into a genre is a disservice to it. This show is as much about ping pong as it is about competition between high schools (hint: it's not all about the sport). Like you said, ping pong is used as a plot device, more than anything.

This show is about the characters and how they grow and change, for better or for worse, around the sport of ping pong. The show could've been about golf, racquetball, or archery and the tone and the writing wouldn't; the only difference would be in the pacing of the story to accommodate for those sports.

Ping Pong The Animation is not a show about ping pong; it's a show about the journey and growth of its characters, which are ping pong players.
>> ARTICLE
It's a character drama, just happens to be about ping pong players
>> ARTICLE
Many sports anime are actually coming of age stories in disguise. Sounds like that's true for Ping Pong as well.
>> ARTICLE
There's more focus on character developments outside of games than the actual score keeping in matches, and we aren't talking about trainings and such, which gives that particular impression. It won't make new players pick up the sport, but will make ex players revisit that feeling again.
>> ARTICLE
But ping pong is used as a driving force behind the characters' motivations, right? From all the things I hear about ping pong it does sound like it condenses all the qualities that normal sports anime have but takes out that "shounen" aspect to it.
>> ARTICLE
That'd be the best TL;DR for what I meant to say, I guess.

Character Development: The Animation has definitely been THE show that needed a "Watch This!" thread.

Unique art styles like this make it easier to watch a show for me, not harder. Is it really that big of a turnoff for some people that you have to defend it? It's should be one of the selling points.

Yes.  I think it's due to people wanting more "style" than actual substance.

There's no reason not to add style onto substance.  That's an absurd concept you're suggesting.

I don't think I made it clear enough.  I meant that people value style more than actual substance.

I think people value style and substance, both in great measure, and Ping Pong intentionally goes on a detour on the style column.

Hey Zudsi (  )
>> ARTICLE
personally not my type of anime, in fact i dropped it after 4. Just couldn't get into it for reasons.. but i can see why others like it. 
>> ARTICLE
I getcha. It's a very strange show, and personally it's the reason why I love it. But it can definitely be very polarizing.
>> ARTICLE
That's a weird time to drop it. I feel like episodes 1-4 specifically were kind of a prelude to the actual plot. I'd give it one more episode before deciding on dropping it. I can understand if you still don't like it though. It can be hard for some people to get into.
>> ARTICLE
it may seem like an off place to stop, i agree, but it was like a number of factors for me that i decided to drop it.

1. **Hype**: picked it up in December when everyone and their mother is making a "Best Anime of 2014" list. Ping Pong was everywhere, everyone was jumping up and down screaming like it was a Capri-Sun commercial, that it was the best thing since slice bread. "It's So Different from everything else!" - for this 2014 i agree, but some of these opinions pretty much came from people that can't get into older animes "because they can't take the animation". So odd.
2. **Pacing & Character Development**: Pacing was rather slow, each episode seems like, the MC would go into his emo phase. Uninteresting persona, I can't really relate to his #Feels, so it did nothing for me. 
3. ~~**[This gif (NSFW)](http://i.imgur.com/fJXUXe7.gif)**... (Throws up in mouth). "Poor you, can't handle old saggy boob nudity", no it's not that, it's... why even throw something like that in the show at all. I get it may be a cultural thing, but it can stay out of mine. that gif was like the only thing i could think of after seeing it in a thread ~episode 2. so +2 episodes after that + slow pacing+Uninteresting developments, i was like... nope... i can survive not seeing this show, ever.~~ I was master trolled aparently. GG
4. **Sports Genre**: I played 10 years of Football, 6 years of Track and Field. Grew up in San Antonio, Tx, where "San Antonio Spurs" decals are everywhere you look (Jerseys, Car Stickers, Commercial Ads, Products in the store, etc). I love sports, but i can't get into Sports anime for some odd reason. It's like, I get "teamwork, integrity, hardships!", i lived through it. Including loosing in a state championship finals my freshman year (6'5 280 lbs lineman, was easy to become a varsity freshman). It may be that i just lived enough of sports in my life that i could care less anymore, is the way i feel about sports genre anime. 

So generally, with all this combined, these are the reasons why i dropped it. Everyone has their own tastes, i have my own. like i said, i can see why others may like this, but it wasn't my cup of tea


>> ARTICLE
> I get "teamwork, integrity, hardships

That's odd that it's one of your reasons, because Ping Pong didn't focus on the typical sports anime clichs of friendship and hard work, in fact one character was flat out told that he will never succeed as he is physically incapable to beat his competitors.

As I'm sure has been reiterated to you, it's a show about players having their own approaches to the world, and displayed through Ping Pong, rather than about the sport itself.
>> ARTICLE
Le Humb**le**brag
>> ARTICLE
1. You dislike stuff when it's hyped? What does anyone else's opinion have anything to do with yours? I don't blame you for dropping it for personal reasons but damn, what a way to short sell it.

2. "MC" gets his focus for a few episodes and it's gone afterwards. There's at least 5 MCs in this show.

3. Not sure how you were "trolled." Did you assume the gif was Ping Pong because of the similar title, or did someone link it to you with such a malicious intent?

4. This ain't even sports. There's no team shit, no unrealistic power training. This isn't Free.

No offense, but I don't think you watched enough of the show to understand why others like it. You can keep it on your dropped list if you want, but you're making some broad, nonsensical arguments against its value.

that gif was never in the show lol

I think it's more well founded because this show has such a large barrier of entry, mainly its whacky art style.

If I didn't watch it with friends I would have missed a truly fantastic experience.

> Aren't WT! threads supposed to be for not very well-known anime?

Not really, we've a few popular series getting recommended and there isn't really a rule to recommend only unpopular ones. That being said, Ping Pong is rank 879 when it comes to popularity on MAL while Welcome to the NHK! is rank 85. The only reason why one of them gets more talk than the other is because one aired in 2014 and the other in 2006, recent series are usually more mentioned than others.

PONG PONG. Nuff said funny as hell.

Oh, simple note, but overall, in any anime sports you cited (well, Kuroko No Basuke and Haikyuu), you could also replace the sports by another one and have the same dynamics, character development (even if it's almost non existant). The argument does not truly work only for Ping Pong the Animation.

It's funny for you guys who dropped this anime because of "ugly" artstyle. I mean, did you guys even read the first 10 chapter to get used to Matsumoto's artstyle and know what was the story about?

Do you guys even know who directed this anime? Or even the animation director is? It's a complete match for Maasaki Yuasa to directed this show.

Honestly, I don't even know who is this Matsumoto and untik 4chan suddenly got freaked out when they announced Ping Pong The Animation.

Heck, I just need 5 chapters to change my mind from "what the heck with this 5 year old artstyle" to "What a wonderful point of view this artstyle trying to tell to the readers"

Ping Pong is one of the anime that are great on every imaginable level - structure, visuals, music, character development, atmosphere and the idea of a "hero" figure is something that I still remember every now and then (heck, I sometimes myself chant "The Hero Appears" in my mind just because it is *that* cool). Would recommend/10.

Nice little review, you touched essential points of the show, I enjoyed reading it.

The art bothered me in the first episode but after that I didn't even think about it. One of the best shows I've watched, 9/10.

My favorite anime so far, and one of only 3 things (and the only non-movie) that I have given a 10/10 to on MAL

It's been in my t3 ever since I finished it, and I don't see it moving any time soon. It's so close to perfection, even more so than what I ranked above it (S;G, Monogatari). Good write up, but I'd also like to note the fantastic use of imagery and symbolism. Here are two of my favourite uses:

Kazama [](/s "as a giant monster and a dragon to Kong, showing how helpless and intimidated he is in their match, while also being an obstacle to him returning home (the dragon taking control of the plane)").

Smile [](/s "breaking free of his robot skeleton, along with the fantastic "my blood tastes like iron" quote, to show that he is having fun, passionate, and desperately trying to win against Peco. It shows his new found humanity"). 
>> ARTICLE
I'm about half way through this right now, and it's pretty damn good. It's about the characters more than the game. They don't even explain the rules. Definitely warrants consideration in the discussion over best sports anime.
>> ARTICLE
I love Ping Pong to no end. Kong has one of the most compelling character arc's I've seen, and so does pretty much everyone. They all make sense. 

> The biggest barrier to watching Ping Pong for some people is the artwork. While some people might find it "ugly", I feel that Ping Pong would not be the same without its unique art style.

I see this so much as an excuse brought up (heck on the YouTube episodes almost every ep someone was like "this show looks ugly"), I'm thinking I am going to rewatch the show with a focus on visuals, and later post a full writeup analyzing the various aspects of the animation (shot composition, fluidity, design, consistency) and talk about what it does well and poorly.

Yeah it was really great. I think I cried.

I made it 45 seconds into the first episode before dropping it, which might be a record for me.  The art style is terrible, to this day I can not fathom why the r/anime hivemind likes this show so much.

I don't really care how good the plot and characters are, the art style is simply un-watchable to me.  But hey we're all entitled to our opinions right?

side note:  in before negative karma.  The hivemind does not like its favorite artsy animes being put down.

Yeah I tend to fall into the camp of 'all I really care about is if the female characters are appealing'.  Ping pong fails this test pretty hard... I don't think it has any female characters at all!

Over the years I've been so consistently disappointed by badly written anime plots that I've simply given up on that style of anime.  I'm sure there are exceptions; anime's with great plot, and maybe ping pong is one, but I'm unwilling to give it a chance.

That's a real shame.  While the artwork is also unorthodox, maybe you'll enjoy The Tatami Galaxy?

>  I personally value character growth and good story more than a visually appealing anime.

I do as well, but Ping Pong is not a "not visually appealing anime"; it's an intentionally ugly anime.  There's a significant difference and I don't care for a producer to scratch my eyes.  If I really want some good characters and story without shoving a knife into my eyes, I'll rewatch LoGH.

I personally didn't mind the unique art style, and I actually think Ping Pong would be worse without its defining artwork.

I'd just like to thank everyone here for convincing me to watch this show. I averted it like the plague at the beginning because I thought I would hate the art style and because it is a sports anime, but now I am hooked to its pacing, voice work, character development, plot, and even art work.

Eh I can relate to your disappointment. Problem is, stupid shit is always the most popular. Protagonists who attract every single girl they come across, who have amazing skills etc. Basically people want to be that protagonist and that's why they watch those types of shows like SAO. 

Then you have Black Bullet like you mentioned, which is such a cringey anime holy shit. Like the whole premise is that there are young girls who are really KAWAII~~Desu, and as a detective you get to have one all to yourself and they'll protect you!! Seriously..? It's just wrong on so many levels. 

Idk anime just panders to the lowest audience atm, it's great to see an anime like Ping Pong with some actual depth.

..That's not the plot at all, in fact it sounds like you based your opinion  and summary solely on the first episode.  You are obviously welcome to an opinion but how about we get our information correct prior to attempting to trash a show. BB isn't my favorite of the season but I find it to be pretty decent.

Ain't that just elitist.

I'm not trying to be elitist, I wish I could enjoy animes like Black Bullet but every time I'm forced to endure "ecchi" scenes with are blatant fan service or cliche character development I feel like killing myself. 

And I've seen 3/4 of the black bullet episodes so far. So no. I guess technically it's "aliens invading humanity" as in a direct copy of Attack on Titan but with a twist, even the OP sounds like Attack on Titan. Then they added some cute girls with powers they get from a virus. 

It's actually disgusting seeing a 5 year old girl ask an older teenager to sleep with her, like its close to child porn. I don't see how anime fans see this as acceptable. Good god.

>I'm not trying to be elitist, I wish I could enjoy animes like Black Bullet but every time I'm forced to endure "ecchi" scenes with are blatant fan service or cliche character development I feel like killing myself.

So don't watch them?  Seriously, if a genre is not your thing then why bother.  On that note, don't trash an anime just because it isn't your thing.  Also I'm not entirely sure what ecchi scenes you are referring to in BB because I can't actually remember any.  Maybe Rentarou's 3 second flaskback to the bathtub?

>And I've seen 3/4 of the black bullet episodes so far. So no. I guess technically it's "aliens invading humanity" as in a direct copy of Attack on Titan but with a twist, even the OP sounds like Attack on Titan. Then they added some cute girls with powers they get from a virus.

Heavy generalization.  If you want to go down that route then Susei no Gargantia = Attack on Titan I guess but the whole humanity being invaded by an alien/unknown force has been a key thing in anime for decades and exists everywhere so this is hardly an argument.  The sole reason people are comparing it to AoT is because AoT was so popular and very recent but this sort of trope has existed for a very long time.

>It's actually disgusting seeing a 5 year old girl ask an older teenager to sleep with her, like its close to child porn. I don't see how anime fans see this as acceptable. Good god.

Enju is actually 10 for the record though that does not tend to help my argument.  On this side of things, either try to not take it seriously or stop watching it.  These scenes are meant to be humorous in my eyes, not even close to something as disgusting as CP.  This also goes with my first argument, however,  as to why you are even watching a show you clearly don't like.  No one is forcing you to do these things.  

>> ARTICLE
So your argument is pretty much "if you don't like it, stop watching it" which I will. Doesn't stop the fact that it's a show with little merit though, and it's stupid how it hit #2.

There was no way Peco was going to win his match. Smile lets Peco win because of his attitude. But not having someone better than himself to play against stunted his growth. In contrast Sakuma has been playing against Kazuma, so he has grown a lot. Smile needs to realize that going easy on Peco is not good for him, and Peco needs to realize that more can be gained from losing than winning.

The great thing about this show is that you don't need to understand the intricate details of Ping Pong to enjoy it. All of it's lessons can be applied to any sport. I practiced Karate in College (for self defense rather than sport), and I know I learned a lot more sparring someone much better than me than someone much worse. However it was also important to spar with the newer students as well, it gives them opportunity to grow and challenge themselves, and it also give you an opportunity to more calmly try new techniques in a practical setting than a match against someone better than you does. In any sport pitting yourself against opponents of various levels of skill and with various tactics and styles is the best way to improve.
>> ARTICLE
Midway through the episode, the coach brings up a good point about competitions.

At the core, when two people compete, what are they trying to accomplish? Regardless of medals, money, prizes, fame, or whatever else an official competition might offer. When two five-year-olds race each other, the only thing that they're trying to prove is that one is better than the other.

At its core, that's what competition is. That's also where a major conflict of Ping Pong comes into play. Smile doesn't actually want to prove anything. He doesn't want to prove that he's better than the others. Smile already knows that he's better than most of them, so he won't ever feel the need to prove it.

One of the major reasons he even competes is because other people push him to. I'm just wondering how long that will last.

Okay, since I occasionally see people complaining about the Chinese subs and I myself am bothered by them, I have taken it upon myself to do some translations of my own to show what exactly is off about them. Hopefully this'll give you a better idea of Kong's tone during these scenes.

Are the Japanese subs similarly questionable? Could someone who speaks both Chinese and Japanese comment?

Some examples: 

Original: 

Translated: Show me your weak point!

My Translation: Where's his weak point? (in a desperate, pleading tone)

Translator took a pleading question and turned it into a command. Changes the entire tone of the sentence.

Original: 

Translation: I can't afford to end here! Not here!

My translation: I can't let it end here, like this! I absolutely can't afford to let it end like this!

Translator takes some liberties here. This one is actually debatable as maybe the translator thought the repetition didn't work in English (I don't really see a huge problem with it, though).

Original: 

Translation: My... My drive will...!

My Translation: Take a look at... take a look at my drive! (still desperate, but he's obviously summoned his bravado for this line)

I can understand the translator taking liberties here (my translation certainly isn't perfect) but you need to convey that despite being in desperate straits, Kong's summoned his last reserves of confidence as he shouts this line out. That's why translating it as a command like "Take a look at..." "Why don't you look at..." or even "Watch this!" works better. This is basically the opposite mistake as the one before where the translator took a desperate question and made it into a confident demand. This is taking a bravado-fueled demand and diluting it slightly.

Original: 

Translation: No, my mother. She made me carry it.

My Translation: No way, my mom. She made me carry it.

 is said in kind of a dismissive tone, so "no way" works here. "No, my mother" is just way too staid and dull in my opinion, doesn't reflect Kong's personality.

Original: 

Translation: You didn't like anything she brought?

My Translation: What was your favorite?

This is just inexcusable. This isn't taking liberties with the translation, this is changing the entire sentence for no reason.

Original: 

Translation: Her homemade wontons were great.

My Translation: The wontons she made were all right, I guess.

... changed the entire tone of the sentence. This one is in a neutral, reflecting tone. 

Original: 

Translation: I'm done for.

My Translation: I (already) don't want to (play ping pong) anymore...

My translation wouldn't suffice here as due to differences in Chinese sentence structure, he omits something like "" (play ping pong) at the end while still conveying the "anymore." There's also an already in the Chinese sentence that sounds off in English. Translator was certainly justified in taking liberties here, but I think they went too far and kind of altered the meaning.

Original: 

Translated: It helps.

My Translation: Hearing that is comforting.

Here's an example where I'm fine with the translator taking liberties. The cadence of "it helps" is along the lines of the original (though I think it's slightly bland), and translating it fully would, in my opinion, alter the rhythm of the line.

So yeah, there's some subtle (and a couple very obvious) altered meanings and tones in the English translations. Disclaimer: I'm a heritage speaker but nowhere near native, and while I'm reasonably confident in my analyses, there could be mistakes in my translations/interpretations. Do point them out if you see any please.

^(oh yeah and this episode was sick i just like bitching about trivial things)

As someone from a chinese heritage and speak with friends in china all the time, thank you for this post. The subbing for the chinese dialogue was really really bothering me. I can read japanese too so i could tell that the subbers were basing off of the japanese subtitles. Still, it definitely brought wen ge out to be not as relatable as it should be. You can tell he has a soft spot for his mom and that he was desperate, but he seems to come off as being really mean in the subs. 
>> ARTICLE
Funny thing is I don't know Japanese or Chinese, but I still got the correct impression of Kong. Just with the flawed English translations and his tone of voice and facial expressions you can pick out the correct view of the character.
>> ARTICLE
I suspect the CR translators were working off the Japanese subtitles on-screen rather than translating the spoken Chinese (not being Japanese literate I can't tell). The fansubbers like Commie are just editing the incorrect CR script, and they don't have Chinese translators on board to make those corrections either.

> The fansubbers like Commie are just editing the incorrect CR script

Actually I think they're using a mix of funi and CR subs, with TLC.

I'm loving this show more and more every week. Thought I'd try and write down notes during the show. Sorry if it all looks silly

[4:20] Ooooh Reverse Penhold! Man its been ages since I've seen this been used. I don't think its a widly used style anymore. But with the Penhold, you have one side, and use that on forehand and backhand, but with the right wrist action (and trust me, I used to play Penhold and I couldn't do it) you could use the back of the blade to hit by adding another rubber. Its tricky to do but very effective. But I still don't get why theres long pips on Penhold. I was always taught that Penhold was always attack attack attack and with long pips, thats hard

I'd explain Penhold and the reverse penhold shot if people would like

[5:30] lets play speed eh? Oh I know as an attacker that speed is what you want, and playing slow is not fun. So what does he do? throws the ball into the air to slw the game. Giving that classing high smash. But look, hes returning everything! a NIGHTMARE for attackers. H actually has Peco on the roops with this slow defensive play. The addition of breathing between shots is a great thing.

[7:00] Sakuma wins the first game using lobs and blocks, just as I expected when Peco asked for speed. You can see how frustrated Peco is because of him calling it petty. I don't call it petty, blocks are wonderful!

[7:14] a fossil?! Rubbish!

[7:30] I love thuis flashback, Sakuma reminds me of me, always learning through books and playing a counter attack game when its needed. Its great

[8:40] Its great to see Peco get frustrated at losing a game like that. Its great to see Peco lose and learn how to lose and be outplayed. Sakuma played the game Peco hates, and it worked

[9:30] flashbacks with the old players. You go from Sakuma saying attacking is outdated, to the two older people saying the game is still the same-ish

[10:30] does he want to make him good or make smile into a clone of him?

[11:40] is smile finally getting what it takes after seeing the Kaido school so focused in this one game?

[12:10] I still dont get how a Chinese player would lose to someone from Japan, when you think the Chinese made the game it is now. Also, Im loving the crowd shouting.

[13:10] ok, this is why I'm loving this artwork now, because you don't need to have every point drawn for the anime, but to have these long animated rallies just shows the level of the game here.

[13:30] followed up by "he's a monster?" straight into this amazing artwork showing how much of a monster he is!

[14:20] ok, this is almost like a nightmare or something now, but for Wenge it is a nightmare to be controlled and destroyed in a game like this by an opponent of such skill

[15:20] and ofc smile is watching this, the guy he SHOULD of faced. Now Wenge understand how good the Japanese is, and now Smile understand the level he could play at.

[16:00] Nice touch here, you don't need to show the finals, its already clear what happens. From going about trying to be a Chinese player, the focus now switches to trying to be like THAT guy from Japan. Its these little touches

[17:00] Wenge has a heart to heart moment with his coach, just to add to the plot. Now he's lost, what more does he do? Just go on with life. Loving the addiction of the plane all the time.

[18:10] Kaio, a place for skilled table tennis players, its a dream for those who want to learn and improve. Take it up Smile! I envy the people who had access to all that equipment! Even custom blades for you! I was sold at the fact they had an endless supply of rubbers you could use and apply to your bat, but the fact they then had a way to create the wooden blade you put those rubbers on was enough for me

[20:00] Kazama wants Smile, but Smile won't make a move, typical Smile! Waste a chance of a lifetime

[20:30] haha love it! Everyone thinks thats two people trying to get together, turns out they're cousins

[21:30] And finally we see Peco cry, old habbits never die!


4 Episodes in and we're done with the first big tournament, Most sport animes I watch don't go this fast but Im enjoying the pace, the quick showing of the matches, then with the score at important times put over the artwork just has that feel. Table Tennis is a game where it can be all one sided or its a back and forth encounter, with the Peco Sakuma game you could tell it was a little back and forth with a comeback. But that Wenge Kazama game was one sided and the artwork for that was just amazing to look at! So what now? Wenge looks like he doesn't want to play anymore, Peco now wants revenge (and probably a lifetime supply of Kleenex) and Smile....is still Smile
>> ARTICLE
Right? I don't get why they are using pips with penhold. You almost never see a penholder with pips, especially attacking players like Peco is supposed to be. 

About reverse penhold, it's actually not that difficult with enough practice but it's not a shot you hit regularly. I mostly used it for a surprise attacking shot. Regular backhand is much easier for blocking. 
>> ARTICLE
They upgraded the technology in the show, but don't forget the manga is originally from 1988.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it still doesn't make sense about them using pips. On the other hand, however, I don't think reverse penhold backhand was a thing during that time. It was made popular during the 90s and later. 

Edit: So I did some research and seems like "Pimpled Hitter" was a traditional style of play for penholders back in the day. 

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've never seen a penholder use pips, however I never knew that it was something popular back in the 90's. I knew that the reverse penhold was created around that time. You are right about using it for a surprise however I think people who use it now have about. 60/40 on using the reverse instead of the front of the blade
>> ARTICLE
Yes please!  I'm loving this show and have played ping pong casually for a while but all of these different styles go way over my head.  I would love to see an explanation for the different styles
>> ARTICLE
Ok, lets see what I can do. First lets start with this, [the ways to hold the bat/styles](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-G9d2NCOIzJU/Tb6z0qAVcAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Rj-rPA0-kKM/s1600/4.jpg)

You have your "shake hand" - The classic style for Europeans (and some Asians) and what Smile uses, its how you're taught from a young age and is just the standard way

Then the Penhold - This is funny because there are two styles, and this is why I love the Anime, because you can actually notice the styles! You have the [Chinese Penhold](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UoIkl9ube2E/ULKEelvylxI/AAAAAAAAADM/pVr4ApjLmxo/s320/WangHao-penhold.jpg) and the [Japanese Penhold](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTAwWDUwMA==/z/3fYAAMXQ-3NRj9HZ/$T2eC16d,!%290E9s37HlbOBRj9HYecDg~~60_35.JPG) - Theres not actually a difference between the two styles, just that Chinese is a shorter handle to a normal shakeband bat, and Japanese has a square-like shaped bat with a large block at the end where your fingers rest. Penhold is like the name says. You hold the bat like a pen.

I've explained the [Reverse Penhold](http://images.beijing2008.cn/20071217/Img214217358.JPG) above but TL;DR: "Penholders" only use one side of the bat and hit forhand and backhand, reverse guys have rubbers (its what we call the side of the bat, the rubber is the red and black) on both sides and use a wrist action to use the back of their blade. 

Penhold players are usually attacking players, which is what Peco is, Sakuma is what I call a counter attacker - all he does is just block the ball, get the ball back, and waits for the chance to strike, instead of doing what Peco does and attack from the start
Smile is the defender - the ["chopper"](http://www.allabouttabletennis.com/images/table-tennis-techniques-backspin-chop.jpg) so to speak. It does as it says on the tin, you hit the ball in a chopping motion while standing away from the table, causing the ball to backspin, making it harder for the opponent to return the ball

Feel free to ask more questions or tell me "none of that made sense" so I can re-word it. Its been ages since I've been able to explain the sport I play haha
>> ARTICLE
You know sports or action shows often have that one character who has to explain whats actually happening, so the audience understands the stakes and back-and-forth? Ping Pong apparently forgot to include that guy, so instead they decided to illustrate conflict so that audience *can actually understand it themselves.* This was clear in the second episode, where they framed a practice match as the battle to ignite Smiles spirit - everything necessary was conveyed through the robot imagery and the expressions of the contestants. It was clear last week, when, in spite of every set of eyes being on Smile and Wenges match, we only received muttered asides from the spectators, and the match largely spoke for itself. And it was clear this week, when Sakumas strategy is made visually obvious as Peco returns lob after lob with his same unthinking intensity. Its brilliant work, and indicative of how good Yuasa is at playing to his mediums strengths to convey necessary information. As an avowed fan of Speedwagon, I am continuously impressed by how gracefully Ping Pong demonstrates that the Speedwagons of the world are generally a crutch, not a necessary variable.

On the plot end, Pecos humiliating defeat here demonstrated the truth of Coachs opening words to Smile - holding back betrays *both* players. Smiles empathy might have protected Pecos ego until now, but its done his play no favors.

And then back to the ping pong! This episodes *second* match was actually the real setpiece here - instead of the distant, consistent perspective used to inform us of Sakumas tactics, *this* time the show trapped us in Wenges head, demonstrating the drama of this match by forcing us to live it ourselves.

The show shifts effortlessly between subdued character exchanges and expressionistic flourishes like Kazamas lightning, but it all fits within the shows incredibly fluid, flexible visual style. I talked last week about how the show embraces its own manga roots - to me, that seems indicative of a larger artistic choice, the decision to allow the shows constructed nature be utterly apparent if that serves the shows goals. It's the same thing Kill la Kill often did, actually - "screw 'the camera as a window to a consistent reality,' this is *animation*, let's abuse perspective like crazy!" This might be a choice the show can afford specifically because its character designs seem so human and unheightened - the unvarnished characters, colors, and environments ground the show, meaning any visual flourishes introduced can be taken as emotional metaphor without the show losing itself in abstraction. Or it also might just be indicative of the excellent back-and-forth between this shows visual flourishes and its *writing* - they both seem to be adept at shifting comfortably from naturalism to poetry and back again.

And again, sound design. That building chorus of Kazamas monstrosity as Wenge begins to panic, all snapping back to the squeak of sneakers and shallow breaths as Wenge regains some perspective. Hes not a monster, this isnt the end, these are the sounds Ive heard all my life. In the silence after the match, his coach ends up telling him the same thing he learns in that terrifying moment - that winning really *isnt* everything, and that dreams dont need to come true to make you strong. As Smile and Pecos own coach muses this episode, the urge to win might do more damage than good - but its only through seeking what we cant reach that we find out who we are.

Meaning that in the end, its a very good thing Smile doesnt take Kazama up on his offer. Kazamas team is very good at seeking the dream, but Smiles coach doesnt want him to win because winning is important. His coach wants him to *want* to win because you cant learn anything until you lose with everything on the line.

well said. there are so many touching little moments and reflections in this show that I love.
>> ARTICLE
I love how [the airplane has become a symbol for Kong](http://i.imgur.com/y4f6L5v). But it's interesting, because now that he's lost, is he done? I wonder if we'll end up seeing him again, or if losing here means that he's got no place left in the story.

Looks like Peco has the most growing up to do out of anyone. To be honest, I think I might find him the most sympathetic character, simply because he's a good guy. I want to see him grow and become a greater person and a greater ping pong player.

[That last shot](http://i.imgur.com/d6vcwEg) of the episode was awesome. The two who were really defeated (with the airplane standing in for Kong) stuck into little tiny corners of the world, alone. 
>> ARTICLE
Well this was the weirdest version of a bayblade duel I've seen, but this is million times better than that, so no complaints.
>> ARTICLE
Last episode left us and the characters with many questions. First, why did Smile lose? For Peco, the question is "Why did Smile lose all the prior times?" or "Why did he *win*?", for Kong, the question of why Smile lost also matters, because if he went easy on him, then it goes to what he asked of Smile in the first episode - why does he go easy on Peco? And said behaviour can only lead to the deterioration of skills on everyone's part.

But Peco still has to play against an old rival, first.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) False Victories:**

1. Yup, someone pointed it elsewhere and the episode opens with it. [Kong doesn't seem at all happy with his win](http://i.imgur.com/VY67ZHO.jpg), even though he was looking for games that will challenge him. He feels his victory is unearned. [Coach isn't impressed either](http://i.imgur.com/sxnReZ2.jpg). Throw the game, when your opponent knows you did, and rather than heal his heart, you just wound it further.

 Perhaps that is Smile's goal, to make Kong realize he shouldn't place it all on the game, because his career right now is a sham, as Smile allowed him to progress without him earning it? If so, then Smile is cruel, but it might just be that he doesn't understand people, so his attempt at kindness will not go as planned.

1. [Angsty Kong](http://i.imgur.com/ZQXm6Sw.jpg). Hiding his depression behind his mirrorshades.

**2) Peco is His Own Worst Enemy:**

1. Peco tires himself out, and Sakuma barely moves. He's playing right into Sakuma's hands, trying to overpower him. He's trying to make a statement, that he'd play straight at Sakuma till he won't be able to return, to show his unrivaled strength, but he's squandering his ability to win. He's not thinking, and is motivated by the petty drive to crush his enemy.

1. ["Just using blocks and lobs."](http://i.imgur.com/CcbWn3D.jpg) - Sakuma knows who Peco's worst enemy is, and that's Peco. His childishness, his petty drive to humiliate his opponent. Sakuma is letting Peco defeat himself. Perhaps Peco will be able to leave Peco behind and grow stronger and wiser

1. [This is Sakuma's role here](http://i.imgur.com/ahezskG.jpg). Peco is a genius. Peco has talent. But since Peco has talent and never had to work hard, his skills are lazy. That works against normal opponents, but not against dedicated players. To be at the top of one's field requires a combination of talent and dedication, and Peco doesn't know what dedication is. Look at Sakuma's line, "Your game is dripping with laziness and compromise." The compromise bit is what Kong spoke of in the first episode, he never had to exert himself because Smile went easy on him.

 Peco only cares to win, but having been handed his wins, it meant he didn't have to develop his skills. Smile's gift, his friend's downfall.

1. While Peco can do nothing but look in amazement at his loss, [Smile isn't even looking](http://i.imgur.com/6tYRWBd.jpg). He knew this was coming. I think Smile had been awakened by the coach, when he commented on the laziness of Peco's play. His blinders are off.

**A Philosophical Interlude:**

1. ["The only way to never lose is to never fight."](http://i.imgur.com/1yxvI1j.jpg) - This truly feels like I'm reading Vagabond or Lone Wolf and Cub, here. The other option is to only play with people who will let you win, but you might then think you can win against outsiders, as happened here.

1. More pieces of wisdom with naturalistic shots: ["Talented people who know themselves never crave anything."](http://i.imgur.com/vKfy3FN.jpg) - Along with a butterfly leaving chrysalis. Those who seek victory are those who need constant proof of their worth, who seek to use others to measure themselves. If you know your skill, you don't need another in order to gauge it.

**3) Crushing Superiority:**

1. [A secret observer](http://i.imgur.com/s4vwEdt.jpg)! Non-black hair! A western scout? Hm.

1. [And the match is set.](http://i.imgur.com/rsFkOBS.jpg)

 Holy shit! [Kazama the *god*](http://i.imgur.com/JQ95t5K.jpg)! So strong, so fast! Like lightning! Is his the electricity to awaken and power-up the doom-robot that is Smile? Pretty great music too, during the match.

 [A monster, a fraknestein, a *titan*](http://i.imgur.com/J5NUC82.jpg), and I mean that in the classic Greek Mythology sense. A veritable Ping Pong superman. Kong has the look of a young mortal hero, but will he do it? Or will Smile's "A hero appears" will be necessary? I can already see the imagery for when Smile and Kazama go at it.

1. Art, [showing us what overwhelming superiority looks like](http://i.imgur.com/s7ZA1hu.jpg). Ryu(uichi) the dragon, reaching across the table, casting his mighty shadow over his enemy. Kong realizes he's a dragon, and all dragons should have a weak point, at least in western mythology.

1. [Dragon versus dream.](http://i.imgur.com/41A0fHR.jpg)

**4) Life After Ping-Pong:**

1. Silly Kazama, he is offering Smile to turn Ping Pong into his life. Kong had just been told that there is life after Ping Pong. But to smile? Ping Pong had never been life. He lives a life that contains Ping Pong, he's not a Ping Pong player who also happens to live.

1. "How dare he have a life?" - As befitting a school where "Ping Pong is Life!" :P

1. [Small Peco, just like a helpless child](http://i.imgur.com/NO7GSSB.jpg), crying when he loses, just as he did as a child - all alone. Sakuma called him "Candy-addict". Peco is still a child, he never grew up. Kong received candies which he never ate, he had never been a child, for he had given his life to ping pong. Two who had lost, one that never tasted sweetness, and another who never did without.

**Post Episode Thoughts:**

Ok, so the Peco and Smile scene will have to wait to next episode. Peco, not cool in defeat. Kong, pretty cool in defeat. Kazama, the dragon of Kaio, a super-human, a *monster*.

Yes, there's now a potential goal for Smile, to defeat Kazama, but Smile? He doesn't seem interested. This is the real question. What is it that Smile wishes for? He wished to be like Peco, but is it to just be Peco's friend, which requires losing, which Peco will now know of, or to be the shining star of Sakuma's past, who never loses, and who sets the tone?

The music was great, the acting was very good. Another great episode.

I was worried early in the episode because it seemed like there were a lot of animation short-cuts and reused bits, but they were obviously saving up the budget for Kong vs. Kazama. That was really an incredible sequence. Of course, a fair amount of it was just cool dragon and lightning stuff, not actual Ping Pong, but it was still effective.

The show is still hitting all of the right emotional notes, especially that conversation with Kong and his coach. Smile may have taken the backseat, but it's still nice to give some depth to the supporting cast.

Smile losing on purpose turned out to be completely pointless, since Wenge failed to qualify for Inter High anyway. I hope he regrets it now.
>> ARTICLE
My opinion copied from my [blarg](http://flightlesstakeoff.wordpress.com/2014/05/01/spring-2014-week-5/):

Ping Pong is not about ping pong. It is about life. About how your intentions and willpower are more important than the events that occur. Smile lost on purpose, that much is obvious, but he wanted to lose. It may have been unsportsmanlike, but I believe his intentions override the honor of the sport. "The winners write history, and the losers are history", the grandma says, but it's clear that she thinks this in the past tense. It's not about winning, it's about wanting to win.

And the personification of that is Sakuma, the "Demon". Always eating Peco's dust when he was younger, he could do nothing but envy Peco's talent. But his intentions to become better, his willpower to push himself through the hellish training at Kaio, proves that hard work can indeed overcome natural, but unpolished talent. It's a harsh slap from reality for Peco, but better to learn the lesson earlier rather than later. You can't stand on top without any effort. There will always be someone out there, who might not be better than you, but will be working harder than you. "No man so good, but another may be as good as he," the coach notes early on.

Another example would be Kong. He's worked hard. Yeah, he definitely had natural talent to rise above all the other kids in China, but there's no doubt that his childhood consisted of nothing more than ending ping pong practice. He supported his family with his ability, which for an Asian is the greatest honor one can have. But after his loss, after he realizes his professional ping pong days are over, he's at a loss. What does he have to live for? He lives and dies for ping pong. But his coach thinks otherwise. There's more to life than ping pong, than whatever hobby, occupation, or passion you have. If you find yourself at a dead end, it's not the end of the world. It may suck, but humans were blessed with the ability to reset their life. It's true that you cannot change your history, but it true that you can change your future. 

Kaio High is full of serious people, and they're backed by the technology, funding, and staff too. The ultimate combination. The high school is practically a pro-training facility, not a high school. Kazama is right in that Smile is best suited to go there if he wants to make it to the world stage. But although Smile plays like a machine doesn't make him one. Just because you're suited to a place doesn't mean you belong there.

I for one don't know if Kazama himself is happy. Sure, he's an absolute monster at ping pong, but did you sense any sort of passion from him? Is it elated at his victory? Is he enjoying the match? No, because he's a monster. He destroys opponents and wins because that's what he was bred to do, that's what Kaio High had instilled into him. The mental and physical stress his twisted his young face into one of a 30-year old. In my eyes, he has no real intention for winning, he is just fulfilling his role.

Coach doesn't want Smile to win just to win, he wants him to learn something from his victory. "Talented people who know themselves never seek anything." Smile is talented and so he doesn't seek anything. Smile has no desires, he is like Buddha, a god. But there's a difference. Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama, more accurately) had desires originally, but lets them go. Smile has never had desires so in other words, he is ignorant. Desire is one of the sources of suffering according to Buddhism, but ignorance is another. Coach hopes that with Smile obtaining victory, he will learn that even with talent, there are things worth searching for in life. "I just want to take him there. That's all. If he gets there, something in him will change."

My translation of Kong and his Coach's conversation after the match. I think it's a very important conversation that should be handled delicately. I believe my translation maintains as much of the nuance as possible, but may lack readability.

Coach: "Your girlfriend?"

Kong: "What are you saying, it's my mom. She made me bring it... My mom, she's your typical mother from the countryside."

Coach: "When was it that you started living alone?"

Kong: "Around 8, when I joined the provincial team... After that, my mom brought me food every week... She even brought a bunch of candy from the factory she worked in."

Coach: "What was your favorite thing to eat?" [Incorrect translation of "You didn't like anything she brought" from WhyNot? subs, probably because it was from the subs, not the Chinese dubs]

Kong: "Well, the wontons we made were all right... In the past, I often dreamed about losing my keys. If I didn't dream about being the only one without a ticket, it would be a relief."

Coach: "Wenge, your life has just begun. Right now, you've only just reached the starting line."

Kong: "I already don't want to think abo-"

Coach: "I'm not talking about ping pong, I'm talking about life... Don't take this as advice from your coach. Take this as advice from your friend."

Kong: "Ha ha. That's comforting to hear."

I knew that was the intention when Peco was returning those long returns. I am surprised he didn't change the direction so the guy would have to run left and right at least.

The character development and the depth of the characters never cease to amaze me. It's great seeing what a show can do with four episodes.

Fantastic portrayal of Kazama's match as well. The style is really something else.
>> ARTICLE
Kong vs Kazama was fuckin epic. Fuckin dragons vs planes!
>> ARTICLE
This show just keeps getting better.
>> ARTICLE
*Holy crap, that China v. Dragon match was a Kemonozume finale-level terrifying trip*

Glad to see that even in refining his own style, Yuasa hasn't lost his monstrous surrealist/post-cubist artistic edge. If he keeps showing this much versatility, he might just edge out Shinbou as my favourite director.

And that match between Akuma and Peco, despite being a whole lot more subtle, was also pretty intense. For what looks on the surface to be pretty repetitive (damn those lobs), they did an excellent job of building the tension and showing Peco's growing frustration. The question is if Peco will recover from this loss like he did against China (egoistically wallowing in tears for a few days, then seemingly forgetting about it completely), now that it's someone he *knows* he should be better than. Can Peco's ego take that beating?

Dammit. Of course Peco and Kong get crushed...

I never thought I'd get so emotionally attached to fictional ping pong players. Hopefully Peco can rediscover his talents.

I love the show and the animation. But it does feels pretty obvious where the Smile - Peco relationship is heading. Looking forward to how they're going to get there though.

I am glad Peco did not win either. Because then there is not much growth on him as a character to make through the season. I am just feeling the last episodes its going to be a final between Smile and Peco

I'm still salty that Kong Wenge got the 256th seed in the best guy contest and promptly lost. Hopefully the show gains additional fans in the next year and he goes stronger next time out.

He got in at least. I tried to campaign for him with all that I had, so it felt like sort of a triumph.

***[OH YEAH!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZrm7e6Ly14)***

**[Hold up the telecaster, light up the lights, 'cause I'm gonna sing, it's time to get emotional!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqxzXesDHu0)**

I don't know about you guys, but I'm extremely excited to start this re-watch! When I first watched Ping Pong, it absolutely blew me away, even with some high expectations, the reason for those being that the show is directed by Masaaki Yuasa, the same guy who also directed my favorite anime of all time, The Tatami Galaxy. And since I did write-ups for that show during the last re-watch, I can't pass up on the opportunity to do the same for Ping Pong! Similar to those write-ups, I will again try to focus on a particular aspect of the show in each write-up, but since Ping Pong has a much more straightforward narrative, yet a much more developed cast of characters, it won't be entirely the same.

Of course I won't be able to say everything, as I think there is a LOT to discuss about Ping Pong... and suffice to say I'm not the only one who thinks that. There have been lots of things said and written about this show by all sorts of reviewers, so before I open the ball, I want to make a general remark concerning one particular point that comes up often:

---
A lot of people have remarked that Ping Pong is not really a sports anime, but more of a SoL with a sports backdrop, as sports 'is not the focus of the show, the characters are'.

I heavily disagree. In fact, I'd argue the opposite. Sure, Ping Pong is not interested in the intricacies of table tennis itself, nor is it really focused on things like match tension or tournament progression, instead opting to look at the players behind the table and their lives. But deep down, at its very core and essence, Ping Pong is more about sports than perhaps any other sports anime out there. It's just not about ping pong specifically: it's about the act of playing a sport itself, at a competitive level, and all that it entails. Most importantly, Ping Pong strives to provide an answer to the most fundamental sports question of all:

**Why do we play?** 

I will revisit the subject in time, as it is the core of the show: for now, let's just get this show on the road!!

---

Ping Pong's first episode wastes no time at all getting into the story: before the opening has even started we are introduced to the our main duo, Smile and Peco, a slightly odd one at that. One is extremely introverted to the point of being aloof, the other extroverted to the point of arrogance with a side of mischief. 

In fact, most of the episode is character introduction: we meet Obaba Tamura, Coach Koizumi, Captain Outa, and last but opposite of least: Kong *'China'* Wenge, a character I will be fanboying for hard... seriously, like, just tell me to stop if it gets too embarrassing. I fucking love the guy and you **will** know why... *I'll make sure of that^^^mwahahahaha* 

Anyway, today is too early to talk about characterization, so let me start by tackling one of the most controversial things of the show: the art style.

First of all, STOP... ~~hammer~~ disclaimer time: I'll be honest and admit that even now, Ping Pong's art style is not aesthetically pleasing to me. It just doesn't appeal to my visual palate, so to speak. But art style can bring more to the table than just mere aesthetics and it wouldn't be like Yuasa to sacrifice something without reason. And to me, that reason is threefold:

1. As I have already mentioned, Ping Pong is a character study. Its principal aim is to make characters relatable, detailed, likable if possible and most of all, **human**. The art style is of fundamental importance to all this!! By adopting a different style, the show distances itself from the distinctly anime quirks and looks, differentiating the characters: by doing so, it forces the viewer to examine characters more closely to look for more subtle hints and expressions, adding to the unique personality it wants to give each character. Considering its aims, a show like Ping Pong needs to avoid as much tropes as possible and the art style eliminates visual tropes altogether. 

2. But that's not all! In addition to that, this specific style is **very** suited to subtle facial expressions. Take a look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/k3kFwYe.jpg), [this](http://i.imgur.com/cFGFyMo.jpg) and especially [these](http://i.imgur.com/yiAqP3K.jpg) [two](http://i.imgur.com/gUjfWcp.jpg). The emotions in these (specifically contentment, arrogance and resentment + anger) get across perfectly without any need to resort to exaggerated movements. When the show does add movement, it creates an extremely high level of detail for facial expressions: take a good look at the OP for an example. Nothing is more important to making a character relatable than getting across their state of mind to the viewer and Ping Pong's art style is unsurprisingly strongest there.

3. The other benefit of the messy style is that the wavy and 'dirty' lines allow for very easy and simultaneously fluid full body animation, something a show about ping pong desperately needs. This is already apparant in the matches we've seen so far, but we can get even crazier. The loose style sacrifices body detail for something much more malleable, the full extent of which we have not even begun to grasp. Expect the show to exploit this to the extreme, though I'll refrain from specific examples... first timers should experience them for themselves unspoiled. 

Of course there are monetary constraints that have to be taken into account, certainly for a show as obscure as Ping Pong. Simply said, a show without sky scraping budget has to make choices. Yuasa chooses to sacrifice conventional aesthetics for more subtle, less easily recognizable assets he feels are more crucial to this show's success, while keeping in line with the art style of Taiyo Matsumoto's manga. 

It's a bold, risky gamble... but those kind of gambles often have the biggest pay-offs. We are in it for the long con: as Smile said, 'not the next stop, the one after that'. The road ahead is still long...

**OST OF THE DAY:** I had almost forgotten that the first episode already had so many good songs in it, but a few of them will get more powerful later on. So today's choice is... **[Like A Dance!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn2NtSKaFwY)**

**SCENE OF THE DAY:**  While today was mostly introduction, there was still some amazing characterization. The highlight to me, is **[Kong Wenge's monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcSuAhbtIFg)**: in that moment his arrogant facade breaks and the ugly bitterness and anger at the centre of it all becomes visible. He's not just smug, he's seething through perceived injustice, seemingly disproportionately so... there seems to be more to it than this. Props to Yousei Bun: his voice acting here is fantastic, the way he snarls and spits his lines is absolutely superb.

I agree entirely with your point about what Ping Pong is about.

I have never seen a show that so perfectly captures the emotions of competition. I don't see how anyone could have played a sport at competitive level before and not see how this show embodies that so well. Without a doubt the backbone of this show is its character development but at the end of the day it all revolves around competing and how different people approach it. To Konge and [Ping Pong Spoilers](/s "Kazama") it is their entire character. Everything about their characters revolves around competing and being the best. [Further Ping Pong Spoilers](/s "The fact that they come to terms with this and amend their attitudes towards the sport is the meat of this whole thing")
>> ARTICLE
Agreed completely on the art style.  On a pure surface level, I found it rough and off-putting at first.  And there were times where I was legitimately confused at what I was looking at (for example, I couldn't recognize characters at a couple points).  But on the whole, those are very minor complaints.  

When it comes to expression, the art style is hugely successful.  It contributes significantly to the understanding of the characters, and that is what really matters to me.  The show is able to communicate everything it wants to, which is pretty much the point in the first place.

Thank you. People might say that the Ping Pong itself isn't really important, and I might agree, but to say that it isn't about sport is absurd. It's an emphatic celebration of sport and everything that goes into it. The show will go into all of the details of course (and in only 11 episodes!) so I'll avoid the spoilers.

Thats the reason why I could relate to it.

 ***OHHHHHH YEAAHHH!!!***  (*cue intro music*)

First time watchers, you're in for a treat. It's gonna be an incredible journey over the next dozen episodes or so; pay special attention to the character development, as it is second to none.

Also, if anyone is a melee player or follows the pro scene, let me know. I really like to draw parallels between the characters in this show to the current top pros. Analyzing character traits helps me get into both scenes more.

This anime is a masterpiece.

Said that, we get the introduction of our main cast, with Wenge being most people favorite, I always prefered Smile as a character over him (China is still best guy).

>> ARTICLE
Oh man. This is one of my favourite series. Having played the sport competitively, I really appreciate how they treated it seriously rather than as a joke.

Here's a bit of relevant background info about the sport in case anyone interested:

**China**

As you might expect, in the real world competitive table tennis scene, China fucking dominates in both the men's and the women's categories. The other top countries fighting for 2,3, and 4 are generally Japan, Germany, and South Korea.

In China, they have table tennis focused schools where kids can start learning and training from an early age. So not surprisingly, there are a ton of highly skilled players in China and they are all constantly competing for spots on the provincial and national teams. The provincial level players from China are probably good enough to make the national team of pretty much any other country where the sport isn't as popular (here in Canada, one of the top players was a teenager who used to be on a provincial team in China).
>> ARTICLE
Participated in the Tatami Galaxy rewatch as a first-timer and had a blast, so I'll be doing this one too. I tried picking up Ping Pong back when it was airing back in mid-2014, but I dropped it mainly because of the art style and the weird storytelling. Since then I've seen a whole lot more shows and I've heard nothing but praise for this series, so it's about time I got around to watching it.

&nbsp;

Smile and Peco already remind me of Watashi and Ozu, good lord.

This is a surprisingly upbeat OP considering how grim the lyrics are.

*Actual* Chinese in an anime? God bless.

I LOVED that transition into the title screen. I seriously can't stress how much I love the Chinese in the show either - I'm Chinese and it's such a weird change of pace to hear it in an anime. Wenge's my favorite already.

Really solid first episode. It didn't really start to hook my attention until Wenge came in, but time flew by after that. Definitely looking forward to the next 10.

&nbsp;

Oh, there are discussion questions. I should probably respond to those.

**Smile** - He seems to be the "main character" but from what I've heard, that's not strictly the case. Very stoic but good friends with Peco, who I'm assuming gave him the nickname "Smile" in the first place. Wenge says he's been throwing his games against Peco, but we don't really know why - so I'll stay silent on that, for now.

**Peco** - Ozu, is that you? Cocky as hell and has the talent to back it up but doesn't seem to practice much, which I suspect is why he's a weaker player than Smile and Wenge. I figure that the show will deal with the concept of "hard work vs talent" at some point down the line as many other anime have done (Sakurasou and Chihayafuru, to name two off the top of my head). I liked the scene in the train where he sarcastically and off-handedly remarks to Smile that conversations with him are always interesting - it did a great job of characterizing both of them with just one line of dialogue.

**Wenge** - My favorite character already (national pride, bruh). Fairly standard backstory and character so far, but the execution of the show was unique enough to keep me on the edge of my seat during the entire (short) match with Peco. Looking forward to how he develops.

&nbsp;

For those of you looking for a subbing group whether you're watching legally or sailing the high seas, I'm using WhyNot's subs. They're great so far and show both the Japanese and English subtitles whenever Chinese is being spoken, and are also the best rated subs for this show on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
Smile and Peco remind me nothing of Ozu and Watashi.
>> ARTICLE
It was definitely more of a "first impression". As the episode went on, the similarities started to vanish, especially between Smile and Watashi.
>> ARTICLE
Wenge was always one of Ping-Pong's selling points. Aside from being a great character he's actually Chinese [future episode spoilers](/s "he even starts to 'learn' Japanese later on and the VA does such a good job pretending not to know the language")
>> ARTICLE
> Wenge says he's been throwing his games against Peco, but we don't really know why - so I'll stay silent on that, for now.

It's also interesting that he was able to pick up on this immediately, despite it being pretty foreign to him, yet some of the other guys and Peco himself just assumed he was controlling the game. You can really get a feel for his experience and ability to analyze the game.
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher here. First impressions

- First off, something that's probably a common complaint. I don't really enjoy the art at all. In fact I kind of hate it. But this is where the complaints end for episode one.

- Despite not liking the art at all, the action shots are fantastic.

- I enjoy the characters so far. They seem interesting, and I'm excited to see how they get developed.

- The music fits the series really well and they did a great job of where they played each track.

- Holy shit the OP is good.

Final basic thoughts for episode 1. I liked it. I wasn't blown away, but it's only episode 1. It did a good job of getting me excited to see where things go from here.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the same way my first time through, in that I wasn't blown away. Rewatching it I was sooooo hyped and happy and excited, so perhaps a lot of what they do isn't appreciable until the next time around, or perhaps I'm just looking forward.

The art never bothered me, but I've never really cared about the style of art as long as it was decent quality and the animation wasn't hurt by it somehow. In this case, like someone said above, it probably makes the action and animation that much easier to direct and take in.
>> ARTICLE
I think the style just needs a few episodes to sink in. I remember my first time watching and I thought that all faces and characters were drawn ugly. Now third time watching I see little details that make me love it even more.
>> ARTICLE
> They seem interesting, and I'm excited to see how they get developed.

The character development was my favorite part of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Oh damn, I forgot about the rewatch. Well I guess I'll join in the next thread proper.

Also China is best Pong.
>> ARTICLE
Favourite part of the episode probably comes from the episode title. Wenge and his coach can not only tell what's happening by sound alone, but they can barely even hear what's happening. That always caught me as pretty cool.

[Peco at peak confidence.](http://i.imgur.com/NjpIG1R.png)

[This kid.](http://i.imgur.com/EBqmsNA.png)

[Understandably, Wenge has supreme focus on the game.](http://i.imgur.com/2putUm2.png) It's basically his life, after all.

Thank Funimation for the 480p screenshots. Anyways, hope you first time watchers enjoy this as much as I did! It's been a year and a half since I watched it and it's been one of my favourites ever since.

Edit: words 
>> ARTICLE
I thought that scene was so cool, It's awesome how much they can tell about the players from just hearing the sounds from outside. Definitely one of my favorite moments from the episode. 

I also adore the short exchange between Smile and China. Smile states that a match between them will only end in defeat, and China's shocked "who's defeat?" line is excellent and get's you really excited for their inevitable showdown.
>> ARTICLE
First-time watcher here. Wow. Just... wow.

This is amazing. I just watched one of the best first episodes I've ever seen. Solid character introductions have already given me a good idea of each personality. Wenge is already my favourite, and not just because I'm hearing actual Chinese in an anime. That monologue of his displays some incredible voice acting. I can't wait to see his match with Smile, and find out why he's throwing matches against Peco. The art style doesn't bother me at all, but I loved Tatami Galaxy too so maybe that's a factor. And Smile! The second he started talking, I knew that voice. Uchiyama Kouki does the apparently apathetic character really well. Tsukishima is one of my favourite characters from Haikyuu!!

I just... I just *need* to watch that again, and then I'm going ahead. Because if the rest of the series is this good, there's no way I can hold back. See y'all on the other side!
>> ARTICLE
I've been looking forward to this one! Within the first 30 seconds I could already see some resemblance to Tatami Galaxy, and that's a damn good sign. The art is rough as hell and I love it. If it wasn't already there, Kaiba just shot to the top of my PTW list, because I officially love Yuasa.

The character designs are all simple and realistic (except the fucking bird guy) but really easy to tell apart. And I love the dynamics that they all have already. Smile and Peco are perfect complements to each other -- I just wonder how they became friends in the first place, with how different they are. During their scene on the train on the way to the academy, their relationship was established really well. It was easy to see that Peco gets on Smile's nerves sometimes and Smile bores the hell out of Peco sometimes, but they're tight enough that it doesn't matter.

Kong is already my favorite. Started out hating him when he was shit-talking the academy team, but the conversation with his trainer turned that right around in record time. I don't know how realistic it is for even a top-level player to gain that much information by listening to the bounces, but it was very impressive. And Kong's reveal that Smile loses to Peco on purpose was genuinely shocking, which is really impressive for a "twist" in the first episode when we've barely even see Smile play. I'd seen the Kong/Peco match on YouTube before, so I knew how it would end, but it felt very different in context. On its own, Kong seemed like a fucking jackass. After watching this episode, I was honestly more sympathetic to him than I was with Peco. This is already shaping up to be an excellent show.

By the way: if anyone knows enough about ping pong to explain what the grips and play styles on the characters' introduction cards mean, it would be awesome to get an ELI5 when new people are introduced.
>> ARTICLE
Aside from what the other guys said about grip styles, the pips are the little nubs on either side of the paddle. You'll get a better look at them a few times in later episodes, and they usually explain a little bit as to what they're for but basically, pips out is when the little bits are faced outwards and free, when the ball hits them it acts like a tiny net to slow the ball down and give the hitter more control. Pips in is when the pips are inverted and the side of the paddle is flat, this gives the paddle a trampoline-esque feel and causes the ball to be hit further and faster.
>> ARTICLE
They're not as highly rated, but Yuasa has done other things as well. I highly recommend Mind Game (a movie), and I hear that Kemonozume is pretty decent. Both have the somewhat trademark interesting art style.
>> ARTICLE
For table tennis, you can tell the general skill level of players from the sound of the ball by listening to 

1. How long the rallies last and how consistent the timing is
2. How fast they are rallying
3. The combination of timing and sound of each bounce (for example the rally between a skilled attacker and chopper has a distinct pattern to it that you can easily recognize due to the difference in timing for the attack and defense)
>> ARTICLE
I watched this last year, so my memory is a little foggy, but IIRC, a couple of the grip styles shown are handshake, pen, and chopper

Handshake and pen are pretty self explanatory. Handshake is basically just a regular grip with your whole hand wrapped around the handle, and pen is just holding the paddle like a pen

Chopper is more descriptive of Smile's style. He literally makes a chopping motion to hit the ball, imparting lots of backspin. It's a very defensive style that slows down the pace and gives him lots of time

Kaiba has arguably the strongest start of the three animes you mentioned, it's fantastic. Only negative is that it doesn't finish nearly as strongly as The Tatami Galaxy or even Ping Pong, but it's a great experience overall.
>> ARTICLE
I generally rate Kaiba over Tatami Galaxy because Kaiba has some of my favorite things in an anime ever, and it just is so powerful. The only downside is that the last 2 episodes feel very rushed.

Counter to that, I thought Tatami Galaxy took a fairly well known premise and delivered some varying episodes along the way, which were entertaining and at times meaningful, but really came together in the last couple of episodes to tie it all into a meaningful, emotional conclusion.

But Kaiba had stand alone episodes (several of which) which rank up there with the finale of Tatami Galaxy to me, and had better music/animation. So, presentation wise, ranked higher.

I generally introduce them to people as opposites, since Kaiba can go extended periods without dialogue, and TG has blistering fast paced talking.

Ping Pong is a masterpiece, and Kemonozume is a must watch to anyone who has ever watched something by Yuasa. It's silly, eccentric, fun, quircky, and a mature take on a well written story with unique animation and artistic merit out the wazoo.

I always found the little things in the dialogue and voice acting to be super entertaining, from Ota ending most of his lines with "-Korraaaa" to Koizumi's hilarious Japan-glish.
>> ARTICLE
Crap, I just binged this over the weekend!!

For anyone in AU/NZ; It's available to watch on [Animelab](https://www.animelab.com/shows/ping-pong).
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely could not wait for this rewatch. I had been planning on rewatching PP anyway, and I am really excited that I get to rewatch it along with everybody here.

A bit late to the thread, but I love how this episode is laid out. China is the real star of this episode, and I love the scene where him and his coach listen to Smile and Peeco play from outside the gym. It's also revealed in this episode that for some reason Smile holds back while playing against Peeco. I also really love how Smile reacted to China wanting to play him, "It'll only end in defeat" and China's shocked response "Who's defeat?!" is my favorite moment of the episode. 

I'm excited to keep watching with everyone here and I hope the first time watchers enjoy every second of it.

EDIT: I also want to mention that I love the airplane imagery that they use when China plays. We get to see a bit more of it in the coming episodes and I plan to elaborate on that when it becomes relevant. I love the motifs that the characters have, each has an object that represents their goals, personality, past, or playstyle in some way. Which I also plan to talk about in the coming episodes. Anyway long edit aside, see you guys tomorrow!
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I absolutely love the motifs and symbols! They do cuts so well, so it's easy to figure out what they're trying to express but each character has their own "thing(s)" that defines or at least differentiates them, and it's often used to explore their character more or to draw parallels. Wenge's got China as seen through the airplane motif, Smile has the whole robot thing going on in like 4 different ways, and Peco's got food/candy as an indicator of how he lives his life and what he cares about.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely looking forward to the next episode. Smile, with the PSP, might prove to be really interesting character is wenge is right. Highly anticipating their match

Can't see how people let the animation bother them, thought it was just fine
>> ARTICLE
I just watched this series for the first time a few weeks back. I just wanted to say that a lot of people mention that they are turned off by the art style for the show. And, I completely disagree with all of those people.

They went for something different with this show. They did a lot of the animation in Flash, and it looks incredibly weird and awkward (compared to mainstream anime), but I think that lends a character to the show that a lot of anime don't have. I like that it's not pristine, with sharp edges and smooth curves. The animation, especially later on in the series, feels wild and evokes emotion of its own. It feels like the animators are just letting loose and it gives so much weight to the actions of the characters.

And honestly, who are these anime fans who are such conformists that they want everything to look exactly the same? Relax your bias just a bit, and enjoy something that went out of its way to be unique.

---end animation talk---

After watching the first episode, I felt it was very clear that Smile was the main character and the hero of this series. It seems set up that way, but it turns out to be much more interesting than that. 

But, let me just say that I LOVE Kong. Kong is my DUDE. He's easily one of the coolest characters in any show that I've seen for a while. He's the guy in the series that I most identify with, and the reasons for that will become clearer as the show goes on. I really liked that they made the choice to just have him speaking Mandarin Chinese, rather than just Japanese as a Chinese native character. Again, this is something that lends an authenticity to the series that makes it feel more realistic to me.

This show starts off a little strangely. Personally I love it. But, if you were turned off by the art style or the characters, or anything else...please, give it a few episodes and I guarantee you will be hooked. If you can make it through to the final few episodes, you will see something truly special develop. This is an incredible story of competition, friendship, overcoming tremendous odds, the terrifying nature of hugely talented people, and the clashing of titans, when someone really talented and hard working runs into a once in a generation talent. 

Easily in my top 5 sports anime, with other shows like Cross Game and Chihayafuru, but this one might be the best of them all (and anyone who knows how much I fanboy over Chihayafuru might be surprised to hear me say that).

Loved this anime. One of my all time favorites. Re-watched it recently and it feels like the emotions I felt while watching it the first time are still there. The unique art style, how the characters interact; they start to grow on me from the first episode itself, the anguish in Kong's voice, the music (oh man, one of the best osts), it all just comes together amazingly. This anime definitely has a special place in my heart. Going to check out Tatami Galaxy next.

Oh, please let me know what you think of Tatami Galaxy! I love that show so much.
>> ARTICLE
Sure thing!
>> ARTICLE
wait what? this is happening? count me in.
>> ARTICLE
Well, that started just all right, but gained my interest when the Chinese player commented that the chopper is letting his friend win.  I guess there will be drama about that soon enough.

Chinese dude certainly has some frustrations to work out, doesn't he.

Welp. First time trying to join a re-watch and I've already failed, I'm most definitely watching ahead. D:
>> ARTICLE
We'll see you in the final, whole series discussion thread buddy. Enjoy!
>> ARTICLE
I swear I'm trying to hold myself! Got up to episode 3 and trying my hardest to resist the urge, ughhhhhh. :(
>> ARTICLE
I know how you feel, episodes 3 and 4 are very good too. Thankfully I've been short on free time, otherwise I would have watched it all weeks ago.

Take it slow, and carve out some time in your day where you just have time to watch one episode. I usually watch an episode of something right before bed, that way I'm too tired to binge, even if it does get really good.

I haven't followed too many rewatches, but I had a ton of fun keeping up with the Shinsekai Yori rewatch a while back. It's totally worth taking it slowly and keeping up with the threads.
>> ARTICLE
> For first time viewers, what is your first impression of these three characters?

Smile is best grill, and Peco and China are both arrogant wankers. I love it.

As for the art style, I'd heard it was bad, but I wasn't expecting *this*. Not that I mind. By the second half of the episode, when I was over the initial shock, I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
We were having a rewatch? Damn, didn't know. Alright, I'll be back in 25 mins.

Am back. "It's about three centuries too early for you to challenge me."

Peco's cockiness is so lovable, it hurts to see Kong crush him while feeling nothing but resentment. There are several great characters in the show, both Kong and Peco are among them, so it's hard to have a favorite. Both of their themes are awesome (even though China is far more badass while the plan is landing and when the match with Peco starts) and they both get amazing development later on. Our candy connoisseur tries out some brand new stuff, for example.

I'm just glad this rewatch got more people to watch Ping Pong. Best soundtrack of 2014, my 2nd favorite of all-time. I might write longer replies on days when I'm less busy, but what we got in the first episode was pretty straightforward. Character introductions (well, most of them), a little bit of foreshadowing and the first important match. Some character symbols were introduced as well, but I'm not going to spoil them for you. They become fairly obvious later on and trying to figure out the exact meaning behind them is fun.
>> ARTICLE
Day late but oh well... I like the idea of episode prompts, that's a great way to kickstart discussion.

Obligatory artstyle comment: the first few minutes, my knee-jerk reaction to the artstyle was kinda bleh but as the episode continued, I actually started to like it. I think it even goes so far as to add some depth of character by being originally a bit off-putting.

As for our main three, it's actually really interesting to see these different approaches to how people feel about their own talent. We have the obnoxious ego-maniac, the humble and soft-spoken prodigy, and the super serious, no-nonsense exemplar.

I'm not sure if we're supposed to dislike Wenge, but I actually really like him. That scene where he's just listening to the other two play and discussing it was *really* intriguing but I can't put my finger on why. He's definitely best developed at this point, I can't wait to get more into his character.

Last comment, I love hearing the actual Chinese, I hope we don't stop with that. Plus, Peco's pathetic attempts to communicate cracked me up. I'm really into this.
>> ARTICLE
Really liked the first episode, excited for the rest!
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I finally got to watch the rest of the episode, and color me impressed! The art style is growing on me a lot more now, and I have some more empathy with Peco now, having been so utterly dominated by Wenge. And that is quite the revelation that Smile has been holding back against him, I want to see him go all out, especially since Wenge was right, that it's not good for your opponent either to make them think they're better than they are. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit, I would have totally joined the re-watch on Day 1, but I just had to not lurk on this sub that day. :p

I'll post with my thoughts so far when the next thread goes up.

Hello all, First time viewer here.  I'll try to comment on all the posts, but I'm already 2 days late =O Oh no!

This is my second rewatch but man there are a lot of text walls here compared to Berserk so I'll skip some of the commentating except for my impressions this time.

Wow!  This show was very interesting.  It's hard to say why, but not too many shows grip my interest this hard in the first episode.  Maybe it was partially the hype, as fans of this show have made their opinions very frequently on this sub just how good the series is.  But it lived up to the hype, at least in the first ep.  

Kong and his coach listening to the ping pong match and following along merely to the noise was very novel.  Kong is a really interesting guy, arrogant but with serious skill, looking forward to easing the boredom of his 'punishment', whatever it is, by playing with Chopper, Smile, the most skilled player he's met since he landed.  But his coach... sugar-coating everything Kong said was quite amusing XD

Well, I've got another episode to watch for yesterday's, and then another for todays =D Looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Even as a diehard Yuasa fanatic, this show really stands out for me because it finally allowed even some anime diehards to try  out a  sports anime and give it a more serious look to its sports hook, its potential depth and the character focus that sports anime are infamous for but it doesn't seem to have that superstar status the genre has in Japan. 

This show really showcased the general artistic flair of Yuasa works in general, sports anime as a genre and also one of the most intense 1 on 1 sports in East Asia, Ping Pong. Not to mention it is one of those incredibly unlikely anime adaptations of a mid 90s manga too.

It just had so many unique things going for it and this episode itself really showcased just how well the adaptation works. I think it's pretty fortunate that the manga's visual style already had a lot of similarities to  Yuasa's usual style as well.
>> ARTICLE
It's fortunate, yes, but my guess is Yuasa chose to work on it for its style or while considering its style as a factor. I doubt they just randomly assigned him a manga to direct.
>> ARTICLE
I think ping pong has the best opening credit of ALL TIME.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I'm a huge fan of this anime, hence my username so being able to rewatch the show and being able to discuss it with le Reddit is going to be great, last time I watched this anime was probably like a month ago and it just never gets old. Can't wait to watch and talk about this show with you guys. :D
>> ARTICLE
I actually didn't get a chance to finish the episode before I had to leave today. So far, both the best players at this school have their personality issues, I like Smile a little better but why hate kids man? You were a kid once too!

I am sure I would like this art style a lot more if I wasn't spoiled by how much I enjoy the regular moe big shiny eyes with lots of colors. As it stands though, even though I am not loving it I do appreciate the difference a lot. It's creative, and I think it's funny whenever something starts to get a lot closer to the viewer you see it swell up in size. There was a moment when the jerk's arm look like it got at least twice as long as it was changing perspectives! 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is in my opinion, the anime of the year from 2014. I was a little off-put by the art style at first, but by the end I absolutely loved it. And now I fondly remember it as one of those absolutely unique experiences and styles, like with TTGL, Shinsekai Yori, etc.

It was my first sports anime and convinced me to give that genre a chance. I'm slowly getting my close friends from my swim team, and other friends who really got into their sport(s) to give it a watch, anyone who played a sport for a few years will see themselves in at least one of our characters by the end.

The [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJgH0yHz-Hs&list=PLu_ACHb5UXf5vcsrxHk1ClBTXkKq86dcz) is what really brings it all together. It's glorious and suits the style and mood so well, it's a frequent cause of goosebumps for me. Some favorites are Hero Appears, Ping Pong Phase, Peco, Night Cruising, Sweet Pain.
>> ARTICLE
I've already watched this six times, the last time is only a month ago and I marathoned it in one day. I can wait for another time.

Buuuuuuut I will give the show a big critic once the re-watch is over.

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/QMW7Z) for today. I didn't take any screen shots of the karaoke scene, because honestly I'd probably be capping every single part. It's that good (also I was lazy).

Peco eating the chocolate says that people are forgetting the classic, cheaper bars. Kind of parallels his unevolved game. 

[Does he agrees, or is he a bit upset at his teammate here?](http://i.imgur.com/74jQSPa.png) He has a clear change in facial expression.

[Smile doesn't want Koizumi to smoke.](http://i.imgur.com/Q6OidSt.png) For health reasons or does it remind him of Peco? [He's out of control, just like the robot at the start.](http://i.imgur.com/FHbNZKc.png)

Before we pan to Kazama/Kaio, we've often gotten shots of a sculpture or statue first. It's a pretty good way to represent their history and the absolute ideal that they/he must live up to. We get a bit of backstory on Kazama's family, on his father specifically, as well as heroes and reality. He has a cynical view, so we might be able to foresee some family troubles for him.

Kong seems to be embracing his role. Compare this to the first few episodes and we have a new man. It's good to see. His Not a chance is much calmer and less arrogant than it would have been, and then we see his teammates/new friends help him and his mom out with the wontons. Very heartwarming.

We end that scene with them having a drink, then it cuts to something on the other end of the spectrum: Peco is having a drink, but it's in a much more lonely, and less classy, way.

Sakuma taught himself the chop. That's good, he doesn't have a laser focus on the other guys anymore which gives him room to breathe and develop as a person.

Is Peco the hero? This is what Sakuma says at the end. It seems like Peco's in it to win it now, as he's had his baptism/rebirth as well as a great conversation with Sakuma. [And what could the photo mean?!](http://i.imgur.com/o9kMypd.png) It said the hero is the only one to stop the robot... Could Peco be the only one to stop Smile (assuming that he *is* the hero)?

I do want to point out some connecting threads throughout the karaoke scene (and ep in general): 

* We have flowers connecting Kazama, his cousin, and Wenge's mom. In talks about family, heroes, and family members doing what they love. If we asked her, I wonder if she would say that Wenge is her hero. That might seem a bit odd. Perhaps it would be the other way around.

* We have Peco at an aquarium with his gf (or a date, at least), and he sees a Santa underwater  he, and Peco, don't belong there. They're in the *wrong* place. Smile gets a Santa mask  it's cold, lifeless, and without personality. His room is empty, dark, and something is missing. We later see Sakuma working at a site, a Santa is there as well. Though it looks calm and at peace, reflecting Sakuma's change (at least a little bit).

* Smile is eating cake, but it's a much different scene than the one with Kong and his friends. Later on we see Oota on the outside looking in at a family celebrating eating cake. Unlike Smile or Kazama or Wenge, Oota doesn't focus that much on ping pong anymore. He has his own job and is focusing on that front. However, he does sigh and look away, so it's possible that he wishes he could be like them, [but he can't.](http://i.imgur.com/eE3dBxF.png)

>> ARTICLE
On your last bullet, I don't think that's Kazama, I believe that's the no. 2 on the Kaio team.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, you're right. I get them mixed up sometimes (it must be the baldness... Or something). I guess that makes it a bit less weird and is why I don't remember it from my first watch.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's a combination of the baldness and the art style. But still you can't deny the cousin feels some attraction to Kazama, fantasizing about him spending Christmas Eve with her. I think in Japan that isn't as weird or something. Never looked into it.

**'You love table tennis more than anyone else!!'**

After yesterday's heavy episode a couple of other characters in the show need to reorrient themselves, as do we, the viewer. For one person this was extremely apparent and this person is the subject of today: today I'll discuss **Peco**.

Up until now, Peco has in my eyes been absolutely infuriating to watch. He's a guy who lives and plays to win and there's nothing he enjoys more than that. But the strange thing is, even though he loves it more than anything else, that hasn't given him the motivation to do everything in his power for it. He eats unhealthily, skips practice, smokes, lazes and still proclaimed himself the best around.

Those we actually know him had him pegged for what he is: like Demon says, he is a big fish in a small pond, subsisting on beating up small fry while unwilling to step up to the big leagues. When Kong utterly obliterates him in a practice match, he wallows in defeat, but it never makes him work harder. Later on that same Demon completely has his number in the tournament, which collapses his world entirely: he gives up on table tennis, starts eating even more, smokes regularly, he even gets drunk today. He's an utter wreck of a person, a winner without winning mentality and a generally feeble person in terms of moral fiber. 

It's extremely frustrating, because all the elements are there. He certainly has the raw talent, considering his youth dominance. He loves nothing more than winning and is an extremely sore loser. When he plays, his game is filled with joy, more than any other player we've seen. He relishes in competitive sport, but why, *why* can't he step up to an environment where he seems to be born for?

I hope you got a good finale planned. I really enjoy your posts!
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately, that is a question we don't fully know the answer to, though we can make some very well-informed guesses. Honestly, it's not so much that I can't answer that question, but more that I don't want to: you'll find out why when the time comes.

Anyway, today we see Peco at his absolute lowest. His conversation with Sakuma is one between relatively obvious opposites: the guy without a shred of talent who worked harder than anyone else versus the kid prodigy who can't expand on it. Sakuma pleads with Peco to continue playing and see where sweat can take him, while Peco waxes nostalgically about how he used to be the man. He's just so consumed by self-pity at that moment that there is no talking to him. 

Sakuma tries anyway. So he runs again. By jumping off a bridge. The scene takes a turn for the depressing when Peco semi-voluntarily drowns. While sinking to the depths, he has some seemingly unconnected memories pop into his head, the first of which we can't completely make sense of yet. As the thoughts progress we come so, so close to stating the actual reason why Peco doesn't step up. As a viewer, you should be able to figure out the answer, but Ping Pong leaves it in the air for now. 


>> ARTICLE
Sakuma saves him, which seemed to have some effect on him. But at the very close of the episode, suddenly something gets through to him and he finally gets his ass into gear. The episode ends with a few crucial dangling plot points: why is Peco unwilling to step up and what made him change now? First timers, remember these scenes, as they are seeds Ping Pong plants to harvest later. Consider them the wind-up for a haymaker that's still to follow. 

In any case, Peco has finally gotten over himself. He's reached his nadir, the point where change is most likely to happen. We're halfway through, guys: the closing half is upon us.

**SCENE+OST OF THE DAY:** For today I'll combine the awards since the moment is so entwined with the music: I'm talking, of course, about [the music montage of All Alone on Christmas Eve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i93vXUKqnI). Like the song says, the episode is a fantastic comment on the loneliness our characters exhibit right now. Back around episode three I said that Ping Pong was diverging the plot, and by the time this scene rolls around everyone's arc has led them to entirely different places and moods.

It's also a great comment on the importance of accepting your circumstances. Smile is forced to spend the night alone because of circumstance and attitude, as well as Koizumi's misplaced kindness. Peco refuses to engage his talents: he spends it alone getting drunk. Sakuma is still in the process of accepting his lack of talent: again alone. Kazama's situation is more complicated, but he is also slave to his own ambitions and responsibilities: take a guess. 

The only one who doesn't spend the night alone, is the loneliest character of all. Kong spent his entire childhood alone, was banished to being alone in a foreign world, but now that he has accepted those circumstances, he spends the night having fun with people in a karoake booth. The only one who doesn't spend the night alone, is the one who isn't bogged down by (misplaced) sense of duty or inner turmoil. A powerful and extremely ironic scene indeed and another one to showcase 'show don't tell'.

*Side Notes:*

- This episode was hard to write about because the focus of the plot is so all over the place until the musical scene. I wanted to discuss Peco at some point, but you have to understand that his arc is just now at the halfway point, so like that arc, discussion on his character is incomplete. 
- Yeah, my personal situation is sort of 'out of the frying pan and into the fire'. I'm writing this in the middle of a blizzard with an internet connection that works on a 'whack a moving pinata'-basis. So no screencaps for now and a limited write-up. Maybe I should accept my circumstances like Kong, but I'm still hoping for better times.

So it seems like the show is setting up Peco to be the hero that ultimately takes down the robot, Smile, and claims victory in the end. I don't know how much I like that idea at the moment, given how hard it is to root for Peco, but this show has been full of surprises so far so I have faith that I'll be satisfied by the end.

I love how basically every character is a foil of multiple other characters at the same time.

* Sakuma and Smile are both been trying to be like Peco their entire lives (when it comes to ping pong, anyway) - but Smile has the innate talent that Sakuma doesn't. The lack of astigmatism helps, too.
* Smile and Peco both have this talent, and it's pretty clear that Kazama does as well, but Peco's the one squandering it while Smile and Kazama are practicing "until they shit blood" every day, as Sakuma so eloquently puts it.
* There's also the obvious contrast between Kong and Smile (and the others, but Kong and Smile are the focus of my attention here). Kong is a noticeably warmer person now than he was just a few episodes ago - as a user in the airing discussion thread commented, "He knows how important coaches are, and how terrible it is to be alone. Yes, he could be better served by ignoring his underclassmen, but he helps them." That just makes [this next shot](http://i.imgur.com/Rw27gDo.jpg) all the more gut-wrenching.

Speaking of Kong, I've only got one real gripe with the show so far, which is that it's not showing us enough of how Kong matures. We've seen him be vulnerable during his conversations with his coach, but I would have liked to see a little more of his transformation into the Coach Kong we saw today.

Peco's and Sakuma's monologues today were both very powerful, and I'm excited to see what the more verbose users have to say about them.

[This is also a hell of a beautiful face.](http://i.imgur.com/DLNuLXF.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
I don't know that Kong really matured as much as it originally seems.

He's confident enough in his Japanese after losing in the national tournament (between ep 4 and 5) to stay alone in the country, which shows that he had been working on his Japanese skills *probably* the entire time before that, even though we just see arrogant Kong all the way up to the regional qualifiers (that we saw in eps 3 and 4).

So, even though we *really* get the impression that Kong had no intention of actually training the Tsujido High School team that he was brought in to do (a pretty big expense from the school), I'm pretty sure that he was going to honor that commitment to the best of his ability regardless.  If he really did intend to just stay a year and fly back to China to join his team (his outward goal), he wouldn't have bothered to learn the language.

The team accepted him as coach/mentor because it was evident to them that he was really trying to help them.  It seems sudden to us because the show really doesn't care about the Tsujido High School team, just Kong Wenge.

Kong Wenge is the best, pretty much.
>> ARTICLE
For Kong, the development we see is plenty I think. You see, during his match against Smile, then against Kazama, you see his belittling self plays less and less of a part of his persona. He was looking at his whole experience in Japan as being forced to walk through a garbage dump. It's not fun, doesn't lead to anything good, but it's something easy to take care of. You see in his two matches, that illusion is slowly being stripped away from him.

His conversation with his coach at the end is really just a true revelation of his character, rather than the developing moment. It's him, after his facade of superiority is gone. He's been forced to face the fact that Japan isn't a garbage dump. It's somewhere he's going to have to stay and live in. He can't just brush it off as temporary unpleasant business anymore. His whole superiority complex was a shield to protect him while he was passing by. But he's not passing by anymore. He's staying. So he has to live with it.
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling that Smile *wants* a hero to pull him out of his robotic rampage.
>> ARTICLE
I had the biggest shit-eating grin when Kong and his mom were getting help with the wonton. 

Then, of course, comes one of my favorite scenes in an anime. Absolutely loved everything about it. Even the little things, like the brief Egami appearance, and Sanada in deep thought after fapping to Yurie, were all awesome. 

Also gotta love when Sakuma, who at this point in the story is probably the most developed and grown, being a boss and throwing away Peco's smokes and saving his life.

Watched the first 6 episodes of my favorite show ever earlier today to catch up with this rewatch. First time I watched it was actually during my senior year of playing basketball in high school. I felt I worked extremely hard to get better but struggled anyway, so you can probably see why this show hit me so hard. It would probably be an exaggeration to say this show changed my life, but it definitely changed the way I viewed life at the time. It might come off as pessimistic at first but in these last couple episodes we are beginning to see the positive message that is present in the show. 

There isn't a bad character in Ping Pong, I'm not sure that I can say that about anything else I've seen. I can relate to just about all of them. I just hope more people can enjoy this show as much as I did. I was happy to see that this rewatch was getting a good amount of attention.

This is one of my favorite episodes solely because of the Christmas Eve karaoke montage. Seeing Kong build a relationship with his team, and how everyone spends the night differently, the music, it's all just great.
>> ARTICLE
	This shows transitions are so good. So Demon is really nice on the inside but he went berserk, huh? And Smile is the robot hero. I dont know about that, Tsukimoto isnt feeling much like a hero to me right now.

	Captain Oota seems like a decent enough guy when he isnt hazing freshmen. I like that the show gives us looks at people who arent like our main characters. They arent very good at ping pong and they dont particularly want to be. Theyre just playing to pass some time and have some fun.

	These fucking shoes. Sporting equipment is a crazy field of business. How do you design shoes specifically to be worn on ping pong mats?

	Why is Santa scuba diving? And wow this girl is a bitch.

	Awww, Mama Kong came for Christmas! Shes the best. 

	Wow, that musical montage scene was incredible. Lets unpack some of this stuff: 

	Kong can sing. He truly is the complete package. And its really nice to see him getting along with the other guys on his new team. Why doesnt his mom just stay in Japan? Im sure if she was around Kong would be happy.

	Peco pulled a Chitanda by getting drunk off an entire box of alcoholic chocolates, and then got into a fight with an inanimate object. Dude is rapidly heading towards rock bottom. 

	Does Smile have parents, or anything? Him sitting in front of the cake watching the candles burn out was lonely as hell. There are consequences to becoming a machine. I know Koizumi has good intentions, but I wonder if hes noticing what all this training is doing to Smile and to the rest of the team.

	Dragon is a mess. He missed his date with his cute cousin, and instead we saw him lying in bed surrounded by used tissues  was he crying, or were they for something else? In a previous episodes thread, when we saw Dragon locking himself in the bathroom, somebody pointed out that there was a strangely rose-shaped pile of tissues in the trash bin next to him. With the lilies in this episode, flower imagery is becoming more important to his storyline. Im definitely going to keep my eye out for this one.

	Demon is working in construction now. Poor guy. I have really mixed feelings about him. Hes a fucking dickbag, but he has astigmatism, its implied that maybe hes a little autistic, and even for people at the pinnacle of physical and mental development, having all of your hard work and dreams disdained and humiliated as thoroughly as Smile did to him is not easy.

	Ahh, hair guy. It seems I was right. He will just randomly show up and travel the world as a side plot. 

	Youre one to talk about living large post-table tennis Sakuma you dirty fuck.

	Peco, you ***FUCKER!*** Listen to him! Stop lighting new cigarettes, dont fucking walk away, dont be a cunt to somebody whos opening up and sharing this sort of personal pain with you! God damn it!

	Thats some teen spirit right there! Is this show poking fun at itself for following the overly-dramatic heartfelt confession in a public place trope?? And here I thought it couldnt get any more perfect.

	Hooooly shit, could Peco be any more of an idiot?!? Is he still drunk or what? Thank god for Demon. I really thought it would be China to give Peco this pep talk about talent and hard work and priorities and dreams, but so long as somebody finally beat it into his head, Im happy.

I honestly can't think of much to say about this episode. Peco has finally gotten it through his head that he needs to work hard to reach his ambitious dreams, but it remains to be seen what will come of that. So far Peco hasn't done much for me except piss me off with his egocentric self-pitying bullshit, so at least I'm happy to have seen the tail end of that ridiculousness. I hope things start picking up for one or two of our other main characters, I didn't sign up to watch all these guys be sad.

>Theyre just playing to pass some time and have some fun.

Ironically, this is the entire reason Smile was originally on the ping pong team as well.  The first few episodes, he practically beats it into everyone around him that he's playing for fun and doesn't care about winning.  I really got the impression that Tsukimoto would have gotten along with the rest of the team a lot more if Koizumi didn't recognize how talented he was.  They never really got a chance to know him before he was turned into the ping pong robot.

That actually wasn't Dragon in the bed with the crumpled tissues. That was another Kaio player who happens to like the cousin. You can tell because Dragon's eyebrows are non-existent, but this guy's are super bushy. Also, after she came back, she saw him exercising, and the puddle of sweat means he's been there for a while.

Stupid bald guys all look the same.

Sorry I missed last rewatch thread; to make up for it, I'll do a longer one today with a focus on the big topic from last episode, effort vs. talent. Anyways, let's begin:

# Comparisons of playstyles from this episode and the pro players of SSBM:

Instead of focusing on individual players and their styles, we'll shift over more towards player mentalities as those also play a huge role in terms of competition and competitors. Let's take a look at today's topics:
 
* Effort vs Talent
* Teamwork vs Flying solo
* Knowing when to quit vs when to keep going

-----------

From last episode, we saw Sakuma get trounced by Smile and told that he lacks talent and that despite his hard work over the years he just won't be able to catch up to Smile. In a daze, Sakuma heads home only to beat the crap out a random dude he bumps into while walking. As a result, he's suspended from school and kicked off the ping pong team at Kaio. It seems that his time as a player has ended.

So what is it about him that doesn't let him advance to the next level? We have seen that his work ethic is as good as anyone's, definitely better than most. His teammates at Kaio regard him as someone who'd play through terrible sickness, his coach loves that if asked to do ten he'd do a hundred. So why is he unable to go as far despite his hard work? Unfortunately in sports and life, there are always people that are better than you. And even if you put in thousands of hours to perfect your craft, there still may be people better than you. It's an unfortunate fact of life that many stories like to gloss over. 

Remember that time when you were a small kid you were told that if you work hard enough you could achieve anything? Ya, that isn't true. What is true is that the hard work you put in does pay off. In Sakuma's case, he definitely got better compared to when he began. He became the opener of Kaio's team, he got to play alongside one of his idols in Kazama. But what he expected of his hard work was to reach the stars, and unfortunately it just wasn't meant to be.

TL;DR: Effort brings you far, but talent can make you go further. Sucks to suck :/

-----------

In today's episode, we get to see some different aspects of player mentalities that also play a big role in how one plays the game. The issue of playing as a team or focusing on yourself really takes off in this episode. While ping pong can be a team game (doubles, team tournaments, etc) the main focus is on singles matches, 1v1s. However, how you mesh with others can still affect how you play your individual game. Looking at Kong, he has accepted his 'fate' that he probably won't be playing back home in China anytime soon, so he decides to actually do his job and help teach his team. He seems to be enjoying his time, and his teammates are opening up to him more and more as well. Team support really does help a player's mentality and good team chemistry usually translates towards better performance.

On the complete opposite side of the spectrum, the team at Katase seems to be in shambles. It's really only Smile playing well, while the others are suffering by playing those at his level. The team chemistry isn't there, his teammates hate him, and it seems Smile isn't having fun just watching him. He has embraced his robotic nature and let go of emotion, his gameplay is all calculated technique. 

But he still wins. And he wins a lot. So what is the downside of flying solo if you can handle its consequences? Are there even any downsides? To Smile, it doesn't really seem like it. But even now, something just feels off with him; that scene with the celebrations with Kong singing in the background showed everyone's emotions, yet Smile.... didn't really have any. I wonder if he feels fine with his current game, and maybe he's longing for something. Maybe... a hero, perhaps.

TL;DR: Being friends with your teammates is fun and great, but what is the benefit if you're just that much better than them? Also, Smile is a robot.

-------------

So what happens when you realize you're either not having fun or just wasting your time? Do you stick with whatever you're doing or do you drop it all and do something else, like going to the beach, the mountains, or abroad? In Peco's case, he isn't winning effortlessly anymore. He doesn't like to lose, so he drops it all and quits. Sakuma realizes he'll never be as good as Smile and also quits. And to be honest, both of their choices are fine. You can do whatever the hell you want to do; if you want to quit, do it.

But Sakuma doesn't like the fact Peco, the most talented of all Tamura boys, just drops his paddle without giving a second effort. Sakuma, the one who put in thousands of hours just to catch up with Smile and Peco only to still just lose to them - he would give anything to be like Peco. He can only dream of having the talent that Peco has, and it kills him that Peco is throwing it all away. Peco doesn't understand what's wrong with just quitting, but he finally understands why Sakuma wants him to keep playing. 

Meanwhile, Smile is working Koizumi-sensei to his death. Guess there aren't any brakes on the Smile train. Dude needs to chill.

TL;DR: You can quit if you want to. You leave your game behind. But if your friends want to play and if you don't play then you're no friend of mine

--------------------

#Comparisons to Melee:

While most of these 'lessons' apply to everyone and not just top level Smashers, it's easiest to see the results of choices by watching top players. In the case of teamwork vs solo play, the two are actually very, very different in Smash. In singles, it's all on your own skill with your character. In teams, however, you can fall back on your teammate to help you. Sometimes, you even need to rely on them. In teams even the less skilled individuals can topple the better players if they have synergy. Yes, skill will eventually trump even the best teamwork, but having a good teammate makes you play better - you learn from them, they teach you things about yourself that you normally can't see on your own, and they give you another reason to play better. No one wants to lose, and no one wants to be the reason their team loses.

In terms of effort and talent, there are definitely more talented players. At the top level, that's Mango. Mango started as a Jigglypuff player but just seemed to translate really well to literally any other character he picked up. In terms of effort, that's M2K. There's a bunch of people, M2K himself included, that will attest to the fact that he sucked butts when he started out; apparently he played like a CPU level 10 - better than a computer AI, but himself played like a computer doing very predictable stuff. Now the guy is considered one of the best Melee players of all time, and definitely the best overall Smash player across all games (maybe not 64, though. Definitely the other 3 games + PM). 

Some games to wrap up this absurdly long post:

* [Mango v Leffen TBH4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AhkPaHUh0A). This shit's just *good*. Watch it.
* For M2K, probably the most famous of his games: Revival of Melee (ROM) LF, aka [Match 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qna80MbcAAc). This is a while ago, right when M2K was actually *losing* his number one spot. He was definitely in a slump, and DaShizWiz just seemed to have his number and was set to bring it to game 5. Then M2K happened. Just... that last stock always makes me clench. It's a great game, my goodness.

Yo. Super long post, so I posted some TL;DRs along the way. Hopefully someone actually reads all of this, haha.

I should probably type these ahead of time, haha

As a fan of the competitive smash scene and Ping Pong The Animation I can assure you that I seriously love these posts. I'm not even much of a player of smash but as of late I've really been interested in the competitive scene. It's the only esport that I seriously enjoy watching.

Sakuma rescuing Peco shows that everyone needs a hero sometime.

Also, that he probably should look into swimming, because he's pretty talented at it.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching this anime with the rewatch but after seeing a few episoedes I ended up just binging the whole thing.  ._.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who started liking Peco a lot more after he quit ping pong?  He almost got a Darwin Award there though.

Interesting dichotomy (is that the right word?) between Kong's and Smile's relations with their respective teams.  How long has Kong been in Japan now?  He's learned Japanese - is he fluent?  Does he have an accent?

I guess Kazama and his cousin really *are* a thing?  It always surprises me how Japan seems to accept this as normal (at least it's always accepted as normal in anime anyway.)  I don't like how she deletes text messages from his inbox just so she can monopolize his time even more... [Edit: apparently I misunderstood and she deleted her own text]
>> ARTICLE
>  He's learned Japanese - is he fluent? Does he have an accent?

Can confirm, he has an accent. Also, his grammar and way of talking is slightly stilted. It's pretty convincing.
>> ARTICLE
Cool, thanks!

Huh? She's just deleting her own message so he doesn't feel bad about skipping out on the date.

My bad, she's cool :)

Man what an awesome anime. I really love this because I can relate so much. I loved art and I love the characters! So inspirational! Also, really love how this episode showed a bit about everyone!!!! Can't wait to watch next one!!!!
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe I let myself be this late again, I'm sorry. 

This was a slower episode compared to the last two. Sakuma admitted he wasn't suited to be really great at ping pong, that's a little sad but better for him in the long run. I really loved that song that Kong sang in the Karaoke, I haven't heard a good new Christmas song in a long time.

**'Blood tastes like iron!'**

And here we are, the final episode where Ping Pong has to finish the narrative. Well, like I said, by this time the show has already ensured that the story is a success, but you don't exactly expect a show of this caliber to phone it in on the last episode. And as expected, it doesn't in the slightest, so let's dive in as fast as we can.

It might come as a slight surprise, but among the main cast, there is one person that hasn't specifically been the subject of a write-up and that person is Smile. It's odd, since it's the closest the show comes to choosing a real protagonist, though if you put a gun to my head and ask me who the main character is, I'd say Peco and Smile's friendship. In any case, his character arc was the first to get started and the last to end and even though I've already conveyed plenty of his persona in the write-ups about the dynamic between Smile and Peco, it's still high time I correct that mistake.

However, he won't be the sole focus of the last write-up. When I started my first write-up, I began with a general remark that Ping Pong tries to find an answer to the quintessential sports question: **'Why do we play'?** Today, we can finally go into Ping Pong's answer. So today's subjects are **Smile and the answer to the core question of (competitive) sports.**

But first Smile. I'm not gonna tell you what Smile is like since we've seen plenty of that already, but it is immensely important to understand why he is the way he is. Smile as a child hailed from a loveless, empty home and as a result he wasn't able to clearly express emotions which only made his case worse. The bullying and general asshattery prompted him to use his 'emotionlessness' as a shell, an armor against harm: if he only exists, then nobody will bother him.

This attitude is immensely sad of course: what's worse is that it's the same attitude he had at the start of the show. After the Koizumi match, Smile unleashed the full power of this robotic defense mechanism, seemingly impervious to harm... but also impervious to life. There's only one thing that can break through his armor and it's facing him today.

We've seen the scattered flashbacks over the episodes in which Smile is in a locker. Today, Ping Pong finally expands on that memory. It first displays Smile's defense philosophy of 'if I don't do anything, not even act like a human, then they will leave me be', but Peco exclaims that Smile's wrong, because 'you know, Smile? Blood tastes like iron'.

To me, that line is a two-fold sentiment. The first thing it means is that no matter how 'emotionless' or 'robotic' Smile may seem... he's still human. Blood may taste like iron, but it's still blood: Smile can experience all those emotions just like everyone else, because he's human. The second part is that there's strength in being human. Smile used his robotic armor as a defense measure, but there is also strength to be had from expressing emotion and fighting with your heart on your sleeve, even if it's just during ping pong. 

Smile only fully realizes it during his match against Peco, but he too, is a human capable of experiencing raw emotions. The moment he breaks free from his armor during the match is the moment where he breaks free of his own armor to finally, finally become human once more.

And with that, all character arcs have been resolved: it's time for the big finish which presents itself as one of the most happiness-inducing and stunningly put together musical montages I've ever seen. And like a supercomputer that has pondered its answer for 11 episodes, Ping Pong provides its answer to the big question of sports: 

'Why do we play?'

In my write-ups I've talked about drive, talents vs. hard work, about pressure, stakes, 'the zone' and the dark side of competitive sport. And taking in all this information, Ping Pong presents its answer, which is as simple as can be, but also the undeniable truth.

'We play because we love it.'

We love to compete, to strive, to dream of grand stories and fairy tales, to laugh, cry and scream, in the joy of victory and the pain of defeat. We love to give our everything and pit it against one another under the roar of the crowd, to be everything that we can be, regardless of the outcome. 

We love to play because it makes us feel alive, because we ***are*** alive. We are alive and that's why we feel joy. 

Don't you ever forget that. 

With that, I end my last write-up. Again underneath all the symbolism and heavy messages, the ultimate core message is surprisingly simple, but the message is given weight by exquisite symbolism and a stellar cast of characters that puts to shame some casts of shows more than twice Ping Pong's length to shame and which makes the show's emotional punch remain even after repeated viewing. I've said all I wanted to say, so I hope those who read my write-ups found them worthwhile: I know I certainly enjoyed doing them. Until another re-watch.

Or maybe when summer is coming, and things will get lively again.... 

**OST+SCENE OF THE DAY:** It has to be the musical montage. [We are all alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDeca52TDZE)... what a beautiful scene. 

*Side Notes:* 

- Kong became a player for Japan and made it to the Olympics... I can't tell you how happy that made me. I may or may not have shed a tear... probably the former.
- The childhood friends reunited, just like the good old days. What an amazing scene that was, so natural.
- The actual ending with the epilogue had so many details, I can barely mention them all: give it a good second look, you might catch things like the hawk of episode 2 claiming a second victim in Kazama or Egami (beach-mountains-travel guy) sitting in the crowd at Peco's match.
- Once more I'd like to say I loved doing these and thank you for all the positive feed-back these write-ups got. I do it because I love it, but those comments make me love doing them a whole lot more.

Thank you for all your write ups. We interpreted a lot of things differently and you gave me a new perspective on things I thought I fully understood.

Sayonara, FLCL. You've been officially booted out of my top five.

This was a very sweet, cathartic note to end the show. It feels like it followed the same pattern as The Tatami Galaxy here: dramatic emotional climax in the tenth episode, and take one more to bring the story home and tie up all the threads. I really, really love how the show came full circle here: we started with two friends playing ping pong, branched out and met new people and experienced all their stories, then came back together to end with the same two friends playing ping pong. Tomorrow for the final discussion thread I think I'll do a bigger write-up, so for now I'll just say that I'm so glad to have participated in this rewatch. It was definitely one of the most enjoyable show-watching experiences I've ever had, and slowing down to take it one episode at a time, write out all my thoughts every day and see what everybody else was thinking, let me do Ping Pong the justice it really deserves.
>> ARTICLE
I knew it would make it into your top 5. Ping-Pong is truly a masterpiece and it's a shame that it's underwatched on this sub. People really don't know what they're missing out on.

It's just the artstyle. Anything that doesn't look like 90% of the anime you see these days immediately puts people off and they drop it within the first 5 minutes. Takes Ajin for example.

I'd like to note that in the first episode the old lady asks Smile if he had considered her offer to be a teacher, and he says no he hates kids etc. I thought it was a nice touch. 

Also, I haven't watched the episode yet today (I ended up marathoning around episode 7 lol), but I remember hearing Kong was wearing the Japan jersey (after the timeskip). Is this true or am I misremembering?

Yep, he was.

Ah, nice. I love that

The paper at the end calls him Tsujido Wenge and mentions that he got naturalized.  Guess Japan wasn't as bad as he thought after all.

i still have one last project due tomorrow, but once that's done i'll type something up for the final discussion thread tomorrow. hopefully  people would still be interested in smash comparisons.

pretty sure i'm just gonna link a lot of awesome sets, anyways. it shouldn't be too bad.

Please link Mango's run at Genesis 3.  The Mango vs Armada rivalry is amazing, and to see everything unfold as it did at Gen 3 was awesome!  It mirrors Ping Pong: TA so well.

Can confirm, I'm interested in the smash comparisons. Those were my favorite part of the thread in the early episodes.
>> ARTICLE
The hero, made of flesh, represents the blood. The robot, made of metal, represents the iron. Peco and Smile have their differences and yet "blood tastes like iron." What they have in common is that they are both alive, Peco just needed to show Smile that he is alive.

"We're alive, that's why we feel joy"

Smile coaching, just like the old lady saying he'd be a good coach early on. He's solving rubik's cubes, he might still be part robot, guys...

Kazama said in an earlier episode that only some flowers were worth decorating with (or something along those lines) when Yurie said mountain lilies were the best. Now that his father's death, which we saw had mountain lilies on the path to where he jumped, no longer burdens him, he's at least okay with them now. It's possible that he's in the family business too, but I doubt it. He did just get kicked off the Olympic team. But if he was, he'd be with his mom, right? That'd be nice if so. If he isn't in the business maybe that's the next step for him.

Butterflies flying around Kazama and Smile. They've both been liberated by the hero, are no longer isolated, and have developed from their chrysalises. Or yeah maybe they just like the pollen.

Smile and Koizumi are still in good contact. [The people we meet and connect with, the friends we make >](https://i.imgur.com/EcsHMqa.png)

Kong on the Olympic team. The *Japanese* Olympic team. What a guy, you can't help but be happy for him.

Kazama's uncle is the Olympic coach! Egami the goat! Good to see him find his passion. Yurie didn't end up owning the flower shop. She found something on her own, through her own hard work and desires. 

Papa Sakuma :)

Aaaand finally, we have Peco's old racket wash ashore. That was something I either didn't remember or didn't catch the first time through, and oh my god that's so good. The giving up and unwillingness to change is thrown away, with the new Peco giving it all he's got. 

God I love this show. One of the easiest 10s I've given.
>> ARTICLE
I only ever gave one 10/10. ;)

I would compare my initial feelings about the ending of Ping Pong to how I felt when I finished playing The Last of Us. The way it ended was an unexpected turn; a harsh reality that was based deeply on how the characters in the game are written, and ultimately unsatisfying on the surface.

But, once you look at the ending of this show, or the end of TLOU in the full context of the narrative of each work, I feel like those stories could only have ended that way, and I was foolish to want more, because everything that was presented was a perfect coda that encapsulated the journey of all of these characters.

The show is a 10/10 in my eyes, and it has permanently lifted my standard for what emotional storytelling can be.
>> ARTICLE
The first time I watched Ping Pong, I lowered a lot of scores on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
Smile's VA really channeled his Meruem voice during his monologue about Peco, around 13 minutes in. 

Hold up, the time-skip is supposed to be 5 years. These guys were 16 years old in the series. Does that mean Sakuma had 3 kids by the age of 21???

[Gotta give some points for giving a shout out to another one of my favorites with a heavy focus on character development](http://i.imgur.com/t8ryNqH.jpg)

[So damn happy to see that Smile.](http://i.imgur.com/ugMAShT.jpg)



>> ARTICLE
I really loved finding out that Sakuma and Kazama go to Tamura's every now and then.  Maybe just to play with Smile, or maybe they also give some pointers to the kids, passing on their love of the sport to the next generation.

Also, Kazama brings flowers when he visits...  Maybe he went into the family business after getting kicked off the national team.

I think at the end of ep 10, when the old guard talked to each other during the Smile-Peco match, Kazama's grandfather might have remembered what Peco told Kazama: Ping Pong is a freaking blast!
>> ARTICLE
I am so confused. How long after playing Peco did Tsukimoto stop playing? I wanted them to stay together for a while longer. Smiling so hard that he was brought to tears by the game was exactly what I was hoping for Tsukimoto for when his hero came back, but was that the end? Smile didnt need Peco anymore after that? Is he going to be okay, strong, and happy without playing like that anymore? 

Im glad we got to see that one student who quit after losing returning and remembering he loved the game, he had quite a journey since his loss. And Kong is playing for Japan now, huh? And it's nice to see Sakuma getting along well too.  I wish I had thought to watch this while it was coming out, or some time sooner. This was one of the best things Ive ever seen. This actually hurts, I dont know what else they can do after that ending, but I dont want it to be over. 
>> ARTICLE
>How long after playing Peco did Tsukimoto stop playing? I wanted them to stay together for a while longer. 

It's not said in the anime and I don't know if it appears in the manga neither, but, you can expect that Smile played at least one more year in high school and maybe played in college.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I hope he kept having fun
>> ARTICLE
I believe so, otherwise he wouldn't have been smiling and laughing when talking to Kazama on the beach.  To hear him laugh after Kazama lost his burger to the eagle was the moment I knew that he's not the same person who hides his emotions anymore.  
>> ARTICLE
I hadn't noticed there was a rewatch going on, but I just finished the show this morning anyways. Great show, a 10 in my books :)
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget y'all, he said in episode one that showing emotions was tiring for him :)
>> ARTICLE
"Heroes don't have weak points."  I guess to Mr. Tsukimoto, Saitama would be the only real hero these days.

Why didn't the two coaches watch their students play?  I understand that they didn't care who won, but wasn't the *game itself* worth watching?  Or did they not want to be there to watch Peco cripple himself (as they thought it might happen)?

I'm glad everything worked out for Peco (and Kong ofc), but I still don't understand why he had to be so reckless with his knee.  It was pure luck (~~plot~~ hero armor?) that saved him I think.

I guess Smile is enjoying himself, looks like he's no longer a robot so that's good.  Sucks for Kazama, especially since he "found his wings" in episode 10.
>> ARTICLE
**'You get it, don't you, Mr. Tsukimoto? That you don't chase the ball. The ball chases you.'**

I have to admit that I largely forgot what happened in this episode save for the match between Koizumi and Smile at the end, which is a testament to the quality of the episodes yet to come really. I was also slightly surprised how many core scenes and seeds the show already plants at this stage... okay, now I'm lying, I knew that that's one of the reasons this show is special. 

The show is advancing nicely, which for Ping Pong means that it's characterizing and advancing the plot at every turn in a rapid pace: as such I can already discuss characters for the first time today! And I don't think I'll surprise anyone with today's subject: today's subject is Smile and Peco's dynamic and difference. 

Those with a keen eye and an understanding of the Japanese language (which doesn't include me btw) may have already noticed one repeated piece of symbolism regarding these two. Peco's real name is Yukata Hoshino, which contains the kanji *Hoshi*, , that translates to *star*. Smile's real name is Makoto Tsukimoto, which contains the kanji *Tsuki*, , that translates to moon. The symbols are also shown a lot in the show (their sports equipment has the symbols, the OP shows them) so in principle you could have also picked up on it without the Japanese.

Anyway, many cultures depict the two as inseparable and exactly opposite, with the two keeping each other in balance: indeed, both of them are at the center of the concept of ying and yang. In fact, the sun and moon have been used for so many concepts in culture that I'm gonna go ahead and stop right here before I lose myself in the plethora of references. 

So, back to Smile and Peco. Yesterday I already talked about how they are utter opposites... I could just use the age-old adage 'opposites attract' and leave it at that, but really, where's the fun in that? Their personalities align nicely with their respective symbols, Peco always being bright and energetic and Smile being more subdued and calm.

But something is wrong in their dynamic. They should complement each other, like the sun and the moon, but they don't. Wenge already remarked it yesterday and Koizumi too: Peco's play is sloppy and Smile is holding back and losing on purpose. They aren't complementing each other: they're dragging each other down. Somewhere along the line mutualism became slow synnecrosis (I always wanted to use that word).

In looking for a why, we have to examine their attitudes towards ping pong: here too, both of them are opposite. Peco derives his pleasure from winning: as he said in the first episode, [it doesn't matter to him as long as he's winning](http://i.imgur.com/TYUlK16.jpg). Smile on the other hand doesn't care about winning at all: [he just wants to have fun playing](http://i.imgur.com/q4iGsn9.png). These two attitudes should be able to boost each other, but instead they do the opposite. Peco is playing sloppily, but doesn't care because he still wins, yet he only wins because Smile lets him; Smile lets him win because he doesn't care about that and wants to have a good time, which he knows his friend has if he wins, so he thinks it's best to hold back. Smile denies he does it, but deep down he knows what he's doing and he knows he's depriving himself of fun, as evidenced by his conversation with Peco today. You have to wonder if Peco doesn't know as well.

In any case, clearly something's gotta give. Surely everyone reading this, at some point in their life, has had to hold back at something in order not to blow away someone far inferior, whether that thing is playing a sport, a game, a musical instrument, whatever. We all know that such events are generally a Catch 22 for all involved: do you blow them away, risking hurting their feelings and putting them off of ever playing again, or do you hold back, risking insulting them and hampering your own enjoyment? That's not to say that you can't get enjoyment out of these situations, but it's never fully there either. 

Koizumi sees all of this. He senses unused potential and a student who is pulling himself down, so he tries to pull him up, regardless of Smile's protesting and refusal to cooperate. But Smile's defense is nigh impenetrable, not because it's so tough, but because he seems to deflect his attempts rather than take them head on. So he needs a scheme, which takes the form of a challenge to a match. The lure is Koizumi's promise not to bother him ever again, the catch is Smile's complete obedience... or so it seems. Koizumi is more clever than that. He doesn't care about the win. The true catch is the match itself, a venue where Smile won't run away because of the lure, so for Koizumi it's an opportunity to mount a frontal attack on Smile's shell without him running away. He attacks Smile's personality through ping pong, which is easy since his personality has bled so much into his playing habits: he shirks away from aggressiveness, defaults under pressure, yields easily to hardship. Until he finally, finally snaps. He puts on his armor and becomes a coldhearted machine. The defense has become bulletproof instead of bullet dodging. 

Which was not actually Koizumi's point or reason. To return to the earlier paragraph: when you have to hold back, you are not able to experience the full joy of doing something. That last scene which contains today's quote that started my write-up, is a really beautiful way of saying it. So many people who don't like sports describe it as 'chasing a ball', which demeans and trivializes the activity. Here, the show turns that line on its head. 

There is a moment in sports and in many, many other areas as well, where you are so engrossed in and focused on the activity that you sort of reach a heightened state: a common term describing it is 'being in the zone'. It is a magical, beautiful place. It's the pinnacle of enjoyment. When you're in the zone, time seems to slow down. Everything you do is right, almost as if you're acting ahead of everyone else's schedule. You're faster, stronger, smarter than everyone around. In that place, you feel like a superhero. In that place, you feel like a king. In that place, when you're truly, truly playing at your maximum, truly fulfilling all your potential... you don't chase the ball: the ball chases you.

For all the things the show has already made clear, there are so many things yet left unexplained. For one we have the slightly surreal scenes with Smile's childhood, chock full of symbolism which we can't quite explain yet. In today's match, Koizumi's monologue contained loads of allusions to a butterfly, a symbol which is also on his own shirt... there's more to Koizumi that we haven't seen yet. 

And to close off: after Smile 'defeated' Koizumi, [he said something strange](http://i.imgur.com/ekvxCvi.jpg). Peco reacts to the unfolding events with shock at Smile's level of playing, but was it really shock that caused [this reaction](http://i.imgur.com/MrTeaqO.jpg)? 

Find out next time on Ping Pong: The Animation!!

**OST OF THE DAY:** Again there is one song which I didn't know already played this early in the show. Maybe it's because I've listened to them regularly that I now recognize them... Anyway, today's piece is obvious: it has to be [Butterfly Joe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS7Rg089Qfk)

**SCENE OF THE DAY:** [The end of Koizumi's monologue](https://cdn.streamable.com/video/mp4/cfxb.mp4) is absolutely beautiful (sorry for lack of subs). I've already conveyed its meaning (to me), but the way in which it's conveyed is amazing. You don't chase the ball. The ball chases you.

*Side notes:* 

- Koizumi's Engrish is fucking hilarious. That burger scene always cracks me up. 
- Speaking of scenes that crack me up, I love the random hawk bit. Completely unexpected, but it shows how diverse this show is (there's also some symbolism there...)
- Today we were also introduced to Ryuuichi 'Dragon' Kazama, another main character. With that, our main cast is almost complete (the fifth one has already been shown, but will come up more later)
- A general note: don't be intimidated by my write-ups!! If you have thoughts, remarks, or if you think I'm full of shit, feel free to comment. I love to hear your thoughts as well, I think everyone has insight that I might not have!

The word you are looking for to describe their relationship is foil. One's qualities serve to highlight the other's.

Oh DANG that's what's with the crescent on his shirt... I gotta start paying more attention to the polos. 

I'm loving these write-ups, by the way! Please keep it up!

>But something is wrong in their dynamic. They should complement each other, like the sun and the moon, but they don't. Wenge already remarked it yesterday and Koizumi too: Peco's play is sloppy and Smile is holding back and losing on purpose. They aren't complementing each other: they're dragging each other down. 

I want to say that it was Steph Curry (regardless, it was some pro athlete) who said that a strong influence in him becoming so good was that his dad never let him win when he played with him. It taught him to strive for better, what being professional means, and that being where you want to be sometimes means more than passion or having fun.

[Ping Pong spoilers](/s "If you want to go far, you need to put in the effort and challenge obstacles  that are above you. You'll either fail or you'll overcome them, but you don't know until you try. And even if you fail, often times the effort itself makes the experience worth it. We end up seeing that reflected in some characters, of course.")
>> ARTICLE
My dad did the same with me no matter what I played him in. He always says that you don't learn your weaknesses from winning. 

I like to think that it's made me into a harsh critic of myself, something that comes in useful often.

New watcher! Here are some rather rambly first impressions~

This show is really awesome when it comes to characters. When other sports anime present these personalities, they feel like tropes: Im just here to have fun! these other characters might tell you, and you accept that as a trait. But in Ping Pong, you can see these characters personalities through their mannerisms, play styles, and even their facial expressions. These characters personalities are manifest in every little detail, and it really stands out. 

LOL the hawk with the poor girls hamburger. Maybe Im reading too deeply into this but even the food these characters are eating do a lot to tell you about their personalities. The coach (Koizumi?) is doing his best to set Smile apart, going so far as to replace his hamburger with a healthier bento, saying its to improve his table tennis. Meanwhile we see Peco eating candy both before and after this event, all the while asserting hes going to be a world champion; but hes ignoring what hed heard from Koizumi. Peco may want to be a champion, and he may think very highly of himself, but hes disinterested in putting work (eating well) into this venture. Similarly, we see a background character eating a hamburger, as if to say this is for the undistinguished. Its entirely possible these assumptions are all completely unfounded, but these details were nice to see anyway.


I love the coach! Getting Smile to show his competitive side by annoying the shit out of him--excellent. Lots of little details to enjoy though, Coachs polo has a butterfly, his love letter was sealed with a butterfly sticker, and now we have this butterfly imagery. [But who is this?](http://imgur.com/AgYQiXW) The coach long ago? That other coach guy? It doesnt look like Smile.

Interesting to learn that Smile learned from Peco as a childI smell drama incoming on that point.

>> ARTICLE
The hawk is the final boss.
>> ARTICLE
Damn lol, you sure you're a first-time watcher? I'm not going to go into specifics, but your analysis is on point so far. 
>> ARTICLE
Lol! I promise <3 I guess [ping pong spoilers?] (/s "the coach is the butterfly") then d: I look forward to that  reveal and a bit of back story, it's a character I'm dying to learn more about! 

On that point, I'm really loving how the narrative plays with time: flashbacks you don't realize are flashbacks, flashforwards to bring the story full circle, it's done in a way I've never seen before and it's incredible. 
>> ARTICLE
I love that image so much. Ping Pong's art style might not be pretty in my eyes, but goddamn if that particular image isn't beautiful, also because of the imagery and symbolism.

You'll find out the context in time. Just be patient, though I understand it might be hard.
>> ARTICLE
It really is beautiful. Everything about it, the colors, the lines, it just stands out among everything else. I'm even more excited to learn more about whatever meaning it holds as a symbol though.

It's quite tempting to binge, but it's more fun to discuss between episodes, I'll hang in there :)
>> ARTICLE
Please do, I love to see a fly-by-fly of someone's first impressions going through. Especially in the later episodes. So hang in there!
>> ARTICLE
The art style might not be appealing but God it fits the show so well. I wish more anime would dare to go outside the box of the standard character design and setting like this show.
>> ARTICLE
> The art style might not be appealing

Well, me and all my friends instantly picked it up upon seeing the art style.
>> ARTICLE
You're absolutely right. I was offput at first, but honestly I think the style adds a certain depth to the characters it'd be impossible to get from the standard "anime" look.
>> ARTICLE
You're right to notice Coach and his butterfly motif. All of the characters have their own recurring visual symbols, keep an eye out for them.
>> ARTICLE
Ooh! I love that kind of thing, I'll definitely stay alert, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Man I just love how accurately ping pong gets portrayed in this show.

Here's some relevant background info about the sport:

**Training**

A common misconception about ping pong is that it does not require much athleticism.
While this may be true for casual and low level play, it is absolutely not true for professional athletes.
Having [strong and agile legs](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vfpXuiYap94/maxresdefault.jpg) is a must because you have to be able to quickly get to the ball no matter where it goes and you have to be able to recover fast enough to get to the next shot. So even if you ever see a chubby professional table tennis player, I guarantee you that he/she will have the leg muscles to make up for the extra weight.

In order to practice both footwork and stroke technique, table tennis players will often train in [multiball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YZgsDDAKss) which is what we see Wenge and Smile doing in this episode. In addition, much like any other athlete, table tennis players will usually do physical training off the table (hence the [training regime](http://i.imgur.com/OBb2k8P.png) that the coach writes for Smile). [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOMzE5QRU_A) shows a bit of both on and off table training that the Chinese National Team does. 

**Brand Names**

The logo on [Wenge's racket case](http://imgur.com/PjdZblx) is pretty much the same as the company [Butterfly](http://www.butterfly-india.com/images/Butterfly-logo.png), one of the biggest brands in table tennis. They are generally known for making quality products.

[Nittaku](https://www.myactivesg.com/~/media/consumer/images/sports/table%20tennis/gc176_2.jpg) is also a pretty recognizable brand.

#Comparisons of playstyles from this episode and the pro players of Super Smash Bros Melee:


This episode we were introduced to the playstyles of Smile and Koizumi-sensei, or [Nickname spoiler](/s "Butterfly Joe. Not really a spoiler, but it's explained later as to why he is called this" ). 

On one hand, we saw the immense talent and skill still possessed by Koizumi despite his old age. We were also told that back in the day Koizumi used to be pretty darn good, and it still shows given his ability to give Smile a run for his money. Another aspect of his game we see is his ability to tell the tendencies of his opponent: 

* Koizumi understands how Smile tends to go for backhand chops when a ball is hit towards his middle. Koizumi anticipates this return and intercepts it with a hard smash for the point.

* As a coach, Koizumi is able to tell the weaknesses of his student both in and out of the game. During the match, he knows just what areas of Smile's character to press in order for Smile to unleash his true potential. This is something indicative of a great coach and player - manipulation of their student/opponent.

The second player we were introduced to was Smile. Initially, Smile is a somewhat passive player who has the skill to hang with the best, but usually folds under huge pressure from opponents. however, once Koizumi pushes him past the edge, we see an incredible display of aggression and control that *surprises even his long-time friend and practice partner Peco. This potential and playstyle have caught the eyes of Koizumi, Peco, China, and a briefly introduced character Dragon (more on him later in the series - he's cool too).

------------------

#Now the fun part: Melee comparisons.

The Melee pros that most closely resemble these playstyles and players are PPMD (Koizumi) and M2K (Smile). Let's start with PPMD.

Dr. PeePee aka PPMD. Falco/Marth dual main, more Marth as of late. PPMD is known for an incredible punish game and his technical prowess, being able to overwhelm his opponents with pressure. However, outside of the game PPMD possesses a skill of understanding his opponents much like koizumi-sensei; I've heard from an interview that he mainly uses CPUs to practice his tech skill and watches YouTube VODs of the top opponents to better understand what their tendencies are. Despite being from a Melee-deprived region, he has been able to rise to the top tier of Melee players utilizing his skills of knowing his opponents in order to crush them.

The other player we can compare to is Mew2King. Marth/Sheik/Fox(?) triple main (his fox is really only against Hbox's puff, though). If you have ever watched a match of M2K playing, you'll understand why we can easily compare him to Smile other than the fact that he is literally called "The Robot" of Melee. M2K's playstyle can be described only as optimal. We are talking about a guy who spent thousands of hours looking at the frame data of moves across all characters in the game in order to better understand the moves he and his opponents can use. It's been said about his playstyle that he always knows what the best option for the next move is even down to the exact frame (mind you, Melee runs at 60 fps - knowing frame data and timing requires extreme precision). Another thing that makes Smile and M2K so similar are their auras - when both are playing their absolute bests, it looks like they're untouchable and you start to wonder how anyone can get so goddamn good at a game.

Looking at these players, we an turn to one of my favorite sets to watch of theirs: [Apex 2014 WF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAyMqJPY8jI). This doesn't necessarily show how these players are so similar to the Ping Pong characters, but damn it's a good set. Also, M2K was playing on fucking fire this tournament; he isn't sandbagging in this, PP's just playing so fucking insane.

--------------

I'll try and continue this little series in the next thread as well. It's too bad that I didn't start this with the first episode, because then I could have talked about Kong Wenge and his Melee counterpart (imo) in Leffen. Don't worry, there's still more Ping Pong and Melee to play.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like it's hard to compare the characters to Melee in some cases. I'm assuming to you Peco is Mango, and Kazama is Armada?

It is interesting that this show has such a presence in the Melee community though. 
>> ARTICLE
While Ping Pong was airing I couldn't believe how comparable it was to melee haha. It's seriously crazy how perfect it is; oh and Peco=Mango.
>> ARTICLE
I'm mentally prepping the Peco/Mango comparison for when Peco really starts to shine, haha. And I need to prep thoughts for the next time Kong shows his stuff, cause he is literally leffen
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for this, the first time I watched Ping Pong I couldn't help but notice the striking similarities between it and Melee, and you do a good job of putting it into these comparisons.
>> ARTICLE
As a fan of melee, I appreciate this.
>> ARTICLE
wow, you guys do love really well written analysis! Could never do it myself, but I love reading all of them.
>> ARTICLE
Here we are, at episode 2 of the rewatch.

**Peco and China, the Aftermath**

 The episode starts out right about where episode 1 leaves off, with Peco sulking after getting skunked by China, once again skipping practice to hang out at Tamura table tennis. We cut to some shots of Chinas training regiment, and I really love how these scenes were juxtaposed like this. While Peco is lazing around skipping practice, China is training intensely. After seeing this its no surprise that Peco couldnt score a single point in their match. Its clear that China still has Smile on his mind, leading to a pretty funny moment when he asks to see the Chopper with Glasses. we see a bit more of Peco still lazing around the ping pong hall later in this episode. He states that hes going to quit ping pong, only to find out that the championship qualifiers are only two months away and he doesnt even have time to feel sorry for himself.

**Coachs Star Player**

We cut to practice as coach (Im going to call him Joe from now on) informs Smile that he shouldnt play Peco anymore because he always lets him win. Joe also informs him that he wants to have special training to foster Smiles drive to win. Joe continues to try and make Smile commit to practice by pestering him. After several, unsuccessful but comedic attempts to get smile to come to early practice. Joe decides to challenge Smile to a match. But Ill talk about the match in a bit. While all this is happening,We learn that Smile really only plays ping pong so he can have fun and pass the time. He has zero interest in winning, and Joe knows this. During their training, he even remarks that There are some views you cant see until you stand at the top. This is one of my favorite quotes from the episode.

**Enter the dragon**

We get to meet Kazama for the first time this episode, he is without a doubt one of my favorite characters in the series. His confidence and strength are almost palpable. He tries to convince Joe that Smile would be a better fit at Kaio Academy the top ping pong school in the area. After Kazama confidently proclaims that there is a zero percent chance Smile will be able to beat him in the championship qualifiers. Immediately after this we cut to Peeco stating that he wants to be the best player in the world. I cant help but think that they put these two declarations next to each other for a reason. Peeco hates losing, and winning is everything to him. I find myself comparing Kazamas confidence with Pecos, but Ill bring that back up when it becomes more apparent. Keep it in the back of your mind though, confidence can take many different forms.

**The Match**

The stakes are set, and its time to play. Right away they turn up the imagery, with a butterfly representing Joe, and later on a robot representing Smile. These will become more important later, but something else to keep in mind. Early in the match, Joe turns up the fire and tries to challenge him aggressively so he will get scared and play defensively. As Peco remarks, Joe knows exactly what Smile hates and hes using it to teach him a lesson. Punishing his predictability and passiveness with every volley. Smile calls out for the hero to appear, but as the robot inside him remarks, the hero isnt coming. The robot calls for him to release his power, as he gives in and detaches himself from the situation. We also learn from a flashback that Peeco was the one that taught Smile to play ping pong. Just as Joe is about to fall over, the cut to a brief single line from Smiles past. Think I can be like you Peco? Shortly after that, we end the episode.

**Character Rundown:**

I thought it would be fun to come up with a list of each of the characters as they appear and list their motivations, goals and symbols as we find them out. I encourage anyone who is interested to help me add to this so we can keep it up to date for the rest of the episodes.

**Smile - Makoto Tsukimoto**
Wants to have fun, plays ping pong to pass the time. Not serious about winning, able to enter robot mode to turn off his emotions and release the power of apathy.
Symbols so far: Robot, Hero

**Peeco - Yutaka Hoshino**
Hates losing, desires victory above all else. Wishes to be number 1 in the world, but thinks his natural talent is enough to get him there. Rarely practices, eats poorly.
Symbols so far: Candy?

**China - Kong Wenge**
Kicked off Chinese team, stuck in Japan until he can prove himself as a good enough player to return home. Strong willed, practices hard, but seems to underestimate the Japanese players.
Symbols so far: Airplane

**The Dragon - Ryuuichi Kazama**
The star player at the top Ping Pong school. We do not know much about his motivations so far, but he seems confident that he is the best player around.
Symbols so far: Dragon?

**Coach Koizumi**
The coach of the Katase high school team, we dont know his nickname yet or many of his motivations. He sees great potential in Smile and wants to give him the drive to win.
Symbols so far: Butterfly

I will be adding more to this list when we learn more about the main and side characters, let me know if I missed anything or you have something you want to see added. I really enjoyed writing this up and I hope you enjoyed reading it. Lets get some discussion going!

P.S. I dont know if Ill have time to write this much for every episode but Ill try my best to at least give my thoughts and update the character rundown with each passing episode.
>> ARTICLE
Nice analysis. Concerning Wenge, I thought the context was that he was paid to go to the school in order to bring everybody's level up. When did he talk about getting good enough to return home?
>> ARTICLE
Krud, that might have been an oversight or a detail from a later episode. I always remember him wanting to prove himself in Japan so he can make it back on a Chinese team. He gets a bit more screentime in the next couple episodes, that should clear it up.
>> ARTICLE
Wenge is so arrogant. Can't even let ~~the plebs~~ your teammates have fun watching for a few minutes?

I'm a bit like Smile in the way that he doesn't like the Coach... Coaching him. With tough love at least. When I played I always hated that. If anything, them getting on me like that would make me play worse. I know I messed up, I know that my team knows I messed up. I can deal with it. It's probably counter-productive, but it's not a conscious "fuck off coach", it's my natural reaction. Though it *would* be better at practice than at a game.
 
I like how Peco just *knows* when Smile walks out and he follows him. It's his cue. He can be a burden, but he cares. He's a good friend.

> Wenge is so arrogant

In the manga he is not that arrogant, or at least we are shown his insecurity. In the first episode he says something like "It's pathetic to have a talent and not use it. But maybe it more pathetic to believe in a talent you don't have."

In the manga translation I read he says "Maybe I'm more pathetic for believing in a talent I don't have."

Just shows that he isn't self-confident anymore and he really wants to prove himself to get back home. He is under a lot of stress and pressure.
>> ARTICLE
> He is under a lot of stress and pressure.

I think that's the key point for his character at this point. It's his supreme focus on only the game and getting home, a lot of it he puts on himself. It makes his reactions more understandable and easier to empathize with, but they're still not healthy reactions.

Interesting about the manga translation.
>> ARTICLE
This is my second time through the series. I have to say, this episode has so much going on that I didnt necessarily catch the first time around. The interactions between coach Koizumi and Smile are loaded and complex in ways that you may only be able to appreciate by the end of the series. In the extended scene where he goes head-to-head versus Smile, he analyzes both the technical aspects of Smiles game and his overarching attitude towards table tennis and life. But what I didnt understand during the first watch is that [](/s "watching Smile is like looking into a reflection of his younger self for Koizumi"). Once you know Koizumis own backstory (which is elaborated on late in the series), these lines of Koizumi have much more impact: 

"There are views you can only see from the top, Koizumi says, [](/s "summing up one of the very important themes of the show.")

He knows exactly what Smile hates, Peco notices, perhaps realizing that Koizumis challenge to Smile has deeper meaning.

Accepting defeat so easily makes you naive Koizumi says as the butterfly [](/s "which later comes to symbolize him") floats across the screen aimlessly with the disorienting lights of a big cityscape in the background. You cannot fly across the ocean on wings so thin. During my first watch, I thought this was something we really needed to know about Smile, but in retrospect [](/s "it's just as much about Koizumi and how he can see Smiles own inevitable parallel trajectory stretching before his very eyes.") "I can read you like a book," he says.

Ill show you, Mr. Tsukimoto... the strong heart you need to win! as the scene cuts to [](/s "a sullen Koizumi in the past, the butterfly wings attached to his back, heavy and cumbersome, not yet allowing him to fly. He wants so badly for Smile to break the cycle, to avoid the same mistake he made.") Really brilliant direction here; subtle but so very meaningful. The kind of direction that is rare to come by in anime these days.

And as Koizumi goes on with his careful verbal jabs, the passion builds in Smile. He prides himself on staying even keel, almost never showing emotion, so that nobody can ever hold anything over him. [](/s "But deep down he cares about those around him and empathizes deeply with them. He doesnt want to crush anybodys dreams.") But the more Koizumi blabs, he feels anger that people cant see that or accept it. That they all see him as a cold-hearted smileless person. Something in him clicks and there is a desire he didnt have before. Enter the hero! Enter the hero! Enter the hero! Suddenly Smiles shots are no longer defensive chop shots. He is on the attack now, focused and driving his shots with top-spin and purpose. He has found the will to win. To be heartless and robotic at the table. To forget his empathy as he plays. Im going on ahead, Peco, Smile says, letting him know that [](/s "he can longer hold back to protect Pecos feelings")

I choose to believe that Koizumi knew precisely what he was doing, what buttons he was pushing. Because he [](/s "was once that kid across the table")

TL;DR: Koizumi is really a more complex character than I realized upon first viewing.
>> ARTICLE
I'll advise people to revisit this match between Smile and Koizumi after they have seen his backstory. It makes it so much more... tragic, I think.

[Spoiler](/s "The match is Koizumi's way of letting off steam against his former self. He's searching for his own redemption through Smile.")
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely agree. I'm appreciating him a lot more on the rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
More first-timer thoughts! (updating as I watch)

I love the storytelling and the way the show chooses to show the events that unfold - the scene with Smile in a locker doesn't mention that it's a flashback, that Smile is a frequent victim of bullies, or that he sees his rescuer as a savior figure - yet it's all made quite clear without any third-party narration. It's definitely a "show, don't tell" style that I'm not used to seeing in more mainstream shows.

"There's no reason to force yourself to continue." Jeez. That's not a line I'm used to hearing in anime in general, much less sports anime.

Joseph-Joestar-san is my favorite ping pong coach.

The coach definitely has some of the most quotable lines in the show so far. The show does a fantastic job of developing its characters through gameplay, and reminds me strikingly of Chihayafuru in that aspect.

There's symbolism *everywhere*, wow. From hiding in the locker he was trapped in to his PSP game, it feels like there's layers and layers to this show. I didn't expect Smile's strength to come from his "inner robot". He's *heartless*, holy shit.

----

I found it fascinating that Smile's response to the constant provocations from Coach is to **put on his shell** instead of breaking out of it (to the user from yesterday's thread asking about Melee followers, it seems like this guy is basically Mew2King). He plays with total disregard for the Coach's well-being and wins because of it, but ends up leaving a bit of a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. The coach loses the battle but wins the war in a way that is very atypical of most sports anime or shounens; Smile's "awakening" is hot-blooded and passionate but cold and robotic at the same time.

Most of the contrast is, I feel, not between Smile and the coach, but between Smile and Peco. /u/watashi-akashi already had a great writeup on this: Smile and Peco are holding each other back, and it seems that Smile realizes this after his victory, saying "I'm going ahead". With any other show I'd say that Smile finds the game fun again and continues to play, which fires up Peco to start putting in the work to catch up - but Ping Pong is pretty unpredictable so far.

Real thoughts: I love how real this show feels. Nothing is over the top. A nice change of pace from the sports shows I'm used to that are extremely fast paced and show ridiculous levels of skill.
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit this is a thing?

Time to do this rewatch with yall! Luckily ive already watched ep 1 a while ago
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm calling it now, this show is going to be a 10. I am so caught up in the characters already, it was hard not to keep watching after this episode.

So obviously this one was all about Smile and Koizumi-sensei's attempts to drag him out of his shell, but I want to talk for a little bit about Peco instead. I do not like Peco. It was obvious in the first episode that he was an over-confident, lazy, callous idiot. But this episode hinted displayed two even more infuriating character flaws, which are that he's a bitter loser and a fucking attention whore. There are two ways you can respond to getting destroyed as thoroughly as China destroyed Peco. You can say "Holy shit, I'm not as good as I thought I was" and get to work, or you can cry about it. Peco chose to cry. This is bad enough in and of itself, but what drives me crazy is that he didn't just refuse to change, he actually got worse. Instead of showing up to practice on trying to improve, he decided he was going to quit the team altogether. He's not quitting ping pong -- he still says that he's going to become the world champion -- he's just decided to drop the last pretense that he actually cares to put in the effort that that requires. He wants the world to fall into his lap, and if he seriously believes that it's going to then I can't wait to see his comeuppance.

Now obviously, Peco did not actually end up quitting the team. While that's a good thing, I somehow find his reason for not following through on the threat even more infuriating than the threat itself. He makes a big deal out of this decision to Smile, but Smile responds with apathy. You can tell in that early scene in the table tennis hall that Peco is trying to get a reaction out of Smile, that he wants Smile to tell him "No, don't do that! You're so good! The team needs you! I don't want to do it if you're not there!" When he doesn't get that response, he shuts right the hell up and goes to practice the next day. I hope Peco realizes how much of an ass he is and sorts his shit out, because he would be a fun guy if it didn't make me so mad to watch him parade his bullshit around.

Just a couple other notes: the sound design in this show is awesome. The robotic noises of Smile's movement after "the hero comes" and he starts wiping the floor with Koizumi were an excellent touch. And damn, for an Engrish-spouting westaboo, Koizumi really has a strong prejudice against hamburgers.
>> ARTICLE
> You can say "Holy shit, I'm not as good as I thought I was" and get to work, or you can cry about it. Peco chose to cry. This is bad enough in and of itself, but what drives me crazy is that he didn't just refuse to change, he actually got worse.

I mean, ping pong is pretty clearly tied to his own self worth. I've cried over losing before - it just happens. Getting shut out too, when you can usually joke around and still destroy everyone? That has to hurt. And people react to loss differently (not just in competition).

I'd make an NGE comparison here but it seems that you haven't seen it. 

Not trying to defend him, but part of being a human means that you are flawed. It makes for interesting characters!
>> ARTICLE
Oh, absolutely. Peco is a clearly a great character (I wouldn't take the time to write multiple paragraphs about a character I thought was shit), but I really dislike him as a person. There are a lot of reasonable ways to react to a loss that devastating. Start working to prove you're as good as you say you are. Or keep your lifestyle, but reevaluate what you expect to achieve that way. Continuing to praise yourself as the best in the world and reaffirming your delusional belief that you can get there without trying is not one of those healthy options.

I cant wait to see your reaction in future episodes then! It only really gets better from there.

Smile killed coach!

Oh wow I didn't even know a rewatch for this show was going on. A friend and I just started it so we're a day ahead of this schedule lol
>> ARTICLE
All the robot/hero stuff kind of passed over me, and I'm surprised Smile didn't just quit soon after the coach started hassling him.  If he only plays for fun, and the harassment is removing the fun, why remain in the club?

The ping pong was great though.  I guess they were playing best 2 out of 3?  It wasn't mentioned, right?

BTW, anyone else catch that that sign at the waterfront said "Beware of Hawks" in English, but subtitles said "Beware of Kites"?  Or did it actually say "Beware of Kites" in the Japanese text?
>> ARTICLE
It's hawks if you're wondering. It's also a jab at Koizumi, seeing as he stole Smile's burger earlier in the episode, implying Koizumi is now a hawk (instead of what he used to be).

I'm super late on this rewatch, and I have a lot catching up to do on other things too. 

The robot came for him instead of the hero? That seems kind of ominous to me!

Nice episode.  Coach succeeds in making Smile play seriously!  And does a damn good job of it.  He does live a very quite, unemotional life, so it's easy to see why he draws inspiration from robots.  

Looking forward to episode 3... right now actually =D
>> ARTICLE
The more I watch this show (admittedly, I got kind of hooked and one episode per day just will not cut it, but it's fun to follow along none the less) the art style becomes my favourite part of this show. The brilliant writing makes the show fascinating, but the real intrigue, for me, comes from the visual story telling. The raw, almost aggressively unattractive, character designs make it feel like we are not seeing the character's faces, but indeed their very souls laid bare. This really steps up for me the first time we really see Kazuma play. It really adds another dimension to the characters. Loving this show a lot, glad I hopped aboard this rewatch.

**'I used to always dream that I lost my key. It'd be a relief to not have any more dreams where I'm the only one without a ticket.'**

I've been waiting for this episode. For many characters, today's episode is the start of their character arc: in a way, today's episode is the real beginning of the story. But I have to be honest: that's not the real reason I've been waiting for this episode.

The real reason is that today I can finally, *finally* let out my inner fanboy. That's right guys: today's subject is perhaps the realest character you'll ever see, the one [I campaigned for to get into the Best Guy Contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/447wm4/bestguy_contest_2_unlimited_salt_works_round_4/czo5tvm) (he made last seed, which simply won't do) and my favorite anime character of all-time. Today's subject, is **Kong motherf*cking Wenge.** 

***CUE THE MUSIC!!*** 

... what's that? You're telling me I already played it as yesterday's OST OF THE DAY? Well, shit. Then we'll have to do it without music. Perhaps it's for the best, as this is about to get real.

We've seen a lot of Kong over the past few episodes and have come to know him extremely well already. The first thing that we have to describe him as is arrogant. He's a confident, even cocky dude, he knows he's [fabulous](https://i.imgur.com/26DFGWh.png) as [fuck](https://i.imgur.com/mJyi4zo.jpg) (which no one can deny^^^^causeI'llkilleveryonewhodisagrees ), but there's an edge to his confidence, a sour side-effect. Over the past episodes he's not just been cocky, he's been downright disdainful, not just to players he thinks are inferior, which is bad enough in and of itself, but to his entire environment in Japan, even to the hand(s) that now feed him.

Of course we already know where the disdain comes from. It's a side-effect of his plight as a ping pong player, forced to go to Japan because of a small mistake (as he himself explained in episode 1), cast aside like a piece of silver when only gold is good enough. He is still angry, seething with rage at this injustice and more bitter than a grapefruit doused in tonic water. 

Yet for all of these partially negative traits and emotions, he still comes off as immensely likable. I happily admit that I cannot completely explain why. But my theory is that it is because of the fact that we get to see everything. 

Let me clarify what I mean by that. Kong's arrogance and anger make him extremely blunt: the effect of that is that he shows every single emotion that he feels. He is an open book which we can read easily. Simply speaking, he is emotionally naked.

But with nakedness comes vulnerability. He's actually so filled with and overwhelmed by emotions that it has become his main weakness as a player. [Kazama remarks as much when Kong is faltering against Smile](http://s15.postimg.org/v7xejw8ka/Kazama_Kong_emotions.jpg). His arrogance makes him sloppy, if that underestimation comes back to haunt him it morphs into frustration which throws off his game even further. And finally, when he feels the pressure rising, his anger becomes despair: pure and unadulterated fear choking him out (the desperate gasping for air). 

Yesterday he could escape, though not through his own power but Smile's "kindness", kindness that only brought him shame, as evidenced by [the screenshot I posted yesterday](https://i.imgur.com/TRyI2eq.jpg). His coach tried to pull him back on track two times. First by cussing him out during the match, giving him a much needed wake-up call. And now by trying to dispel Kong's thoughts on the possibility of a thrown match, which is the last thing he needs right now. 

But for those of you who thought his coach succeeded and that Kong had gotten a break: congratulations, you were dead-wrong. His match against Kazama is a nightmare straight out of hell. A match he has to win, but doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell to. [The dragon mauls the airplane](http://s15.postimg.org/bif47g0nu/Dragon_plane.jpg) and the despair he felt against Smile is amplified by 1000 and is [now](http://s15.postimg.org/k6xo14qxm/Kong_despair_1.jpg) [almost](http://s15.postimg.org/belar6v6i/Kong_despair_2.jpg) [palpable](http://s15.postimg.org/jqh1sfska/Kong_despair_3.jpg). At the ultimate point of this despair, he looks at his coach and sees the acceptance on his face:[ he can finally, *finally* accept things as well.](http://s15.postimg.org/btwkk7h3u/Kong_acceptance.jpg)

And POOF, just like that, the smoke screen fades. It turns out we've been tricked all along. All of Kong's outward emotions, his arrogance, his disdain, his posturing, they were all diversions and distractions, smoke and mirrors. It all served to hide his most important emotions, which are the ones he's feeling about himself. Because oh boy, those 'distractions' pale compared to Kong's inner torment. 

What does that say about us? We didn't stop to think about how he must be feeling about himself. For all the outward arrogance, don't you think his banishment didn't cripple his inner self-esteem? For all the outward disdain, don't you think he hates himself for failing to live up to expectations? And for all the outward despair, how much fear and grief do you think is inside of him? 

That grief and fear all comes pouring out in one of the best and most heartbreaking scenes I've ever seen: [Kong's talk with his coach after the defeat.](https://cdn.streamable.com/video/mp4/obwm.mp4) With all that has been going on, we never truly realized the heartbreaking fact that Kong is unable to return home to his family. To his mother who lovingly and wholeheartedly supported the dream he was unable to fulfill. Whom in all likelihood he supported financially: [this shot](http://s15.postimg.org/fl656iusa/Kong_mother_1.jpg) strongly suggests that his mom is a single parent, while [this shot](http://s15.postimg.org/re3yaqr8a/Kong_background.jpg) and [this declaration from episode 1](http://s15.postimg.org/e4umodrve/Kong_statement_family.jpg) suggest that they hail from a poor background. Even if those circumstances are not true, his plight is still devastating: all alone in a foreign land, unable to return home to those he cares about most... and his defeat just sealed that fate.

His conversation with his coach is him finally putting it all up for show, all his fear and sadness. The conversation is so honest, so natural, so real, I can't watch it without choking up. I have to give gigantic props to both voice actors: Yousei Bun perfectly conveys the utterly defeated state Kong must be in, while Tei Ha's extremely gentle tone is the only way a good friend and mentor would approach their devastated protege. 

So where does Kong go from here? That's a question neither we nor Kong himself can answer right now. But like his coach said: his life has only just begun. We've only just reached the starting line. 

**OST OF THE DAY:** [Kazama's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxK4flTeynw) is absolutely awesome, but today's spotlight goes to the amazing piece playing during Kong's conversation with his coach: embrace the [Sweet Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5K4qhKlkBI)

**SCENE OF THE DAY:** It has to be the conversation to me, but from an animation perspective I have to give some attention to [Kazama vs. Kong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX7CydebMQo). Remember when I mentioned in episode how the art style hasn't been stretched to its limits. Yeah, this shit was what I was alluding to.

*Side Notes:*

- Since today's focus was on Kong, I wasn't able to highlight all the other stuff that happened. Today was also the start of Peco's arc in a way, as well as Sakuma's: the latter will be discussed very soon.
- I love the fact that the start of the episode highlighted points I already made in previous write-ups. We start with the coach mirroring my closing statement of the last write-up to Smile, followed by a firm confirmation of Peco's attitude towards Ping Pong versus that of Smile. 
- I hope I can keep upcoming write-ups slightly shorter... but what can I say? I just really love Wenge and I want everyone to share in the China love. He deserves so much better. 
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't able to post my thoughts today since I had an exam, but you said basically everything there is to say and then some. Fantastic job with these so far.

At the end of an episode we see an airplane fly away from the stadium as the camera pans out from Peco. That's not Wenge actually flying back to China, is it? If not, is there some hidden meaning there that I missed?

One last thing - would you be able to use Imgur to host your screencaps? Some of your current links don't seem to work with RES.

Don't worry, I normally use Imgur, but for some reason it was being a raging asshole against me yesterday and I couldn't upload anything. Hopefully it will be better the coming days.

> But with nakedness comes vulnerability. He's actually so filled with and overwhelmed by emotions that it has become his main weakness as a player.

Great paragraph. I really do feel bad for China. He's an asshole for sure, and I wouldn't want to know him in real life, but I can't help but pity someone who's had it that rough. Watching him get demolished by Dragon was a strange mix of awe and despair, as I really didn't want Kong to have his dreams destroyed so thoroughly, but Kazama is just so incredible. What really struck me, though, is how immediately after the match ended Kong's reaction was one of relief. He didn't break down in tears, he didn't rage, he didn't try to make excuses or plan how he could still get to go home. He was happy to be done, happy to no longer have this burden on his shoulders. I find that to be extraordinarily interesting.

One quick question: Do we know why he was kicked off the Chinese team and exiled to Japan? I don't think it's been explained, but I really want to make sure I'm not missing anything.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say happy, but he was relieved. I mean, imagine what that kind of pressure must be doing to you, how much strain there had to be on Kong. To me, his posturing seemed a way of dealing with that load. 

Now that that load is gone, there has to be some relief, even though the floor has just collapsed underneath him. It's a complicated state of mind he's in right now. On one hand, his dreams have been destroyed extremely thoroughly and all his work seems to have just been for naught. On the other hand, the pressure of having to return is now gone and him not standing a chance against Kazama also makes way for acceptance, like I said yesterday (the honesty part of competitive sports).

I still think that Kong is mostly devastated being unable to return home, but this defeat will help him to loosen up a bit. I'll be dedicating one of my posts on the role of pressure in competitive sports, so maybe you'll see what you're looking for there. And about him being an asshole... I'd withhold judgement on that until the end.

As for your question, as far as I can remember it never gets stated explicitly, but I have the feeling it has to do with a simple mistake in terms of losing a match he wasn't supposed to. Just like in some competitive sports, you can be the best there is, but sometimes you lose a crucial match and miss out on everything.

	Wow, that was a lot of stuff in the first minute and a half. Lets recap: Demon was a fucking dick as a kid, but good on Peco for standing up for Smile. Then Koizumi gets in on the slapping. Definitely not a good episode to be Smiles face so far. Now its Smiles turn to threaten quitting, Peco is pissed because Smile stole his I quit because Kong beat me schtick. More subtle hints about Koizumis past, and OHHH YEAHHHH! Ping Pong episode four, Im ready!

	How old is Kong even supposed to be? It somehow feels very wrong that hes competing with high schoolers. 

	The biggest complaint I have against this show so far is in how they depict these matches. They only show one player scoring over and over again, then reveal the score and it turns out that theyre only up two or three points. Lets see the other guy when he gets a point in here or there. I think there would be a lot to unpack from how somebody reacts to scoring when hes behind.

	Interesting match. Demon definitely knows how to get in Pecos head, and it was so frustrating to watch Peco futilely beat the same shot straight at Demon again and again. Then Demon goes and rubs salt in the wound? Hes clearly riding high on himself now. Meanwhile, Peco has just been humiliated for the second time in recent memory. I hope he takes this loss to heart and starts to fix his shit.

	Those who dont know themselves struggle hardest to win, because they want to prove a point. That sounds like a spot-on analysis of Demon, and China too. And maybe Dragon? He definitely puts in the struggle, but he seems more comfortable and self-assured than the others. I cant wait to see him play Kong.

	Is Kazama bulimic? Not that I think he has an eating disorder, but that green flow going down the toilet really seemed to suggest that hes making himself vomit to deal with stress.

	Ill say it again: Dragons theme is badass. How is every match this fucking hype?

	If this isnt the soundtrack of the day Ill be shocked. Kazama is terrifying. [This is some Shingeki no Ping Pong shit.]( https://i.gyazo.com/3428dff6824ec7ff2e7812611d8fbe0e.png)

	And Kong is out. Im both happy and intrigued though that he seemed to smiling as he walked away. I guess even if its a major setback for his career, China can appreciate a good opponent. And on a certain level, if he has enemies like Dragon and Smile to test himself against, playing in this tiny island country cant be as bad as he assumed it would be.

	Why the fuck are all the Kaiou guys bald? Well it seems to be working for them, since they monopolized the top four. Somewhat surprising though to see Demon knocked out by some no-face character weve never even seen before.

	This is some impressive stuff Dragon, but you clearly have no idea who youre talking to. Smile isnt interested in any of this shit. Hes probably disgusted by the thought of living like that. And hed look *dumb* with a shaved head.

	YO ITS ANOTHER GIRL! And this one looks like shell be an actual significant character!

	Ahh, I see. Kazama is the coachs nephew. That explains a lot of the pressure on him.

	And we end with Peco crying and Kongs plane leaving without him. 

A heavily plot-focused episode this time around, not much in the way of character development compared to previous days.  Dragon is quickly becoming my new favorite character. Hes a monster at ping pong, huge and terrifying, but seems like a genuinely nice guy. He has talent, drive, and a heart, though not so much of one that he goes easy like Smile. And on top of all that, he has an as-yet unknown tragic backstory that has created enormous pressure on him and given him some serious mental anxiety. I said in one of my notes above that Kazama seemed more self-assured than the rest of our main cast. Im having a hard time assessing whether I still think thats true. Smile is an introverted loner who fears the entire world and what it would take to actually get invested in anything. Peco was certainly self-assured at the shows beginning, but that faade is clearly crumbling all around him now. Chinas entire life has been devoted to a career which has just been demolished; his pride and his vanity have been crippled, and I dont know if he knows where to go from here. Demon is an obsessive freak who seems driven primarily by a misplaced, jealous anger towards Peco. Out of all of them, Dragon strikes me as the only one who A. knows what he wants, B. has the proven skill to get there, and C. is driven by a healthy, positive motivation, not pride or anger. And yet, this anxiety is the wrench in the works. Healthy, confident, motivated people do not lock themselves in the bathroom and purge before every match. And so the question becomes, what is really motivating Dragon? Is it a genuine love for the sport and the thrill of competition? Or is it fear?

Well, Act One is over. I dont know where the plot is going to go from here. I assume well have a stretch of relative downtime, for our losers to come to terms with their setbacks and our winners to fret over and prepare for what comes next, and then? Will Kong, Smile and Peco somehow get another chance at nationals? Will our climax be of a different nature than just another ping pong tournament? Will the timeline move even faster than Im expecting, and we wont have another convergence of all five players until next years competition? Were officially more than a third of the way through the show, and Im already upset that were getting this close to the end.

Sports anime tend to do this, at least from what I've seen. I think it's a bit odd, but it's probably an easier way to keep tension for later in the match while still keeping the content relevant.

I'm on mobile so I can't type up a proper response. You are going to enjoy yourself a lot in the coming episodes. 

As for two of your points. 

>why are they all bald?
 Aeorodynamics 

>why do they always show one guy scoring one after another only to find out he's just 2 points ahead?

This is to show who is in control of the game and to cut down on the time spent watching ping-pong matches. The show is classified as a "sports anime" but it's main focus is character development and psychological impact. It's also to help people who don't really follow ping pong to know who's ahead. If you saw even scores and it looked like everyone is putting up a good fight and you wouldn't know who was winning. After all just a few points is a close game right? But this show focuses elsewhere, it's not about who wins or how they did it, but why. What happened that made one player just good enough to win. 

You aren't going to find the answer to that question by watching them score 8 easy points.

#Comparisons of playstyles from this episode and the pro players of SSBM:

Aight. So despite their first appearance being the last episode, this episode really introduces the final two of the five main players that the show focuses on: Manabu Sakuma and Ryo Kazama, both players from the stronghold that is Kaio Academy. While Sakuma is the vanguard of the main team at Kaio, Kazama is the best player there and in Japan as well, having won last years championships. Let's look at their playstyles, shall we?

Sakuma, the Demon. It's easy to tell that he has been envious of Peco since they were young, and from the brief flashbacks we could see that Sakuma wasn't actually that good at the game back then. He also remarks on effort, and how in the end it pays off. Guess what he says is true.

To accompany his incredible work ethic, Sakuma has a playstyle that seems to counter Peco's aggression and raw talent. At first he plays a slower game, lobbing and blocking such that Peco tires himself out. This defensive style was immediately followed by his own aggressive play once Peco grew frustrated and was playing sloppily. In a word, Sakuma is manipulative.

Kazama, on the other hand, seems to be power incarnate. He's just too fucking good. He has immense power, speed, and his presence really makes you question the legitimacy of his body - he seriously looks like he's in his mid-twenties and juices in a way to make Barry Bonds envious. Anyway, Kazama also plays like his life depends on it, but it seems like instead of trying to get back to former glory such as Kong he seems like he'd literally die if he loses a game. it seems for kazama, ping pong isn't just a game - it's his life force.

#Comparisons to Melee:

#Hungrybox
 * Florida, USA
 * Jigglypuff main
 * Sponsor: Team Liquid
 * MIOM 2015 rank: 2

Hbox reminds me so much of Sakuma. Originally Hbox was (and still is) seen as the devil of melee, given his campy playstyle and repetitive motion of back-air, back-air, back-air. Since his character is the lightest character in the game, aggression and getting in his opponents face is likely going to get himself killed without doing much to his opponents since Jiggs is slow as heck, which is why he has to play very defensively most of the time and only go aggro when he's sure he can secure the combo. 

This isn't to say that Hbox can't play an aggressive style - he most certainly can wreck opponents by going in, but in general he has to bait out his opponents and force mistakes. His ability to do so has grown steadily over the years, and lately it seems that almost no one has been able to consistently get past him and beat him. Of the few exceptions, however, is the next topic of discussion.

#Armada
 * Gothenburg, Sweden
 * Peach/Fox dual main
 * Sponsor: [A]lliance
 * MIOM 2015 rank: 1

Armada. This fucking guy. Rising to international fame and legitimacy with his incredible showing at Genesis 1, he is the reason why freakin Princess Peach is considered 'top tier' in Melee. Armada is just incredible at what he does. His punish game is probably the best this game has ever seen, his tech skill is great, but what makes this guy so damn good is just how consistent he is. I don't know the hard numbers (and I'm a bit lazy to look p the info), but I'm pretty sure he has won every event he's attended for the last six months except for Dreamhack Winter a few months ago. 

Armada hardly loses in the game, and almost never loses his composure outside of it either. He seems to be the embodiment of greatness, and wherever he goes you have the feeling despite his calm demeanor he could easily kill you. Remind you of anyone? That's right - the fucking Dragon of Ping Pong, Kazama. Both are such powerful players, you can't help but feel scared knowing you'd have to fight them.

------------

To end, I'd like to showcase some matches of both Hbox and Armada that really show off their play. For Hbox, I'd point to [Top 8 Losers bracket of Evo 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiX9CYrNb6c) for a slower, more patient playstyle and [The Big House 3 LF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlMapo2JZGI) for a more aggressive attitude (for this one, look specifically at the transition from game 1 to game 2). Also, check out this fan made video showcasing some Hbox highlights, it's pretty good: [Hungrybox - Yeezus](https://vid.me/cgBX). 

For some Armada clips, let's choose a recent tournament set at [Genesis 3 GF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWdueibcRgg). His opponent, Mango, the GOAT melee player, was going on a TEAR and playing out of his mind; I wonder if we'll see more of Mango in these posts of mine... Maybe. As for another clip of Armada being just insane, let's look at a clip of [Apex 2015 Doubles Loser's Finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74r12PR3cQA). Just...wow. I highly suggest looking up that entire set too, as it's an incredible doubles set which in all honesty is a completely different game from singles.

Thanks for reading, sorry for not being super in depth on this one! Hopefully the vids can show it off!

Honestly, from what I remember the more impressive Armada stat that preaches consistency in my eyes is that he hasn't dropped a serious set to anyone outside of the current top 6 in something like 5 years iirc.

Anyways, I really enjoy reading your write-ups every thread. It's fun to see Melee outside of the smash scene.

[Kazama's presence too strong.](http://i.imgur.com/9H7E5CR.png) There's always those larger than life players that seemed to dwarf the competition. It can definitely be intimidating to play against.

[Peco could have learned something from these guys.](http://i.imgur.com/9uiJOCW.png)

[His world is empty, lonely.](http://i.imgur.com/SzXROVk.png) He always cries when he loses, but this could be something more. The plane has past as well, so it's tying Peco and Wenge, the big losers today, together. Wenge seems to be taking it a bit better though; he has a good coach and friend to comfort him and tell him that things are just beginning. Perhaps Peco has already reached his peak?

I always thought that last image was really powerful. It conveys so much without any words or action. In the foreground you have Peco, crushed under the weight of his broken dreams. In the background is the plane overhead, the image we know to be a symbol for Kong Wenge's heartbreaking exile and homesickness. All these tiny details are brilliant directorial touches.

You're kind of backwards on Kong...  He wants to be back in China because he was "kicked out" for making some unnamed mistake and is trying desperately to win back the honor he lost by winning in Japan.  This isn't some field trip for him, it's his last shot to get back into the big leagues.

A lot of character development.  Get to see a lot of Kong....

Meh.  It's not even worth commenting since watashi-akashi is posting a fucking essay at the start of every one of these.  Nothing left to be said.

Please, please still comment!! No matter how much thought I put into these, I'm just one person with one viewpoint, I'd love to hear and read your thoughts on things: for example, several people made some comments about Kong's relief, which I hadn't fully taken into consideration.

Chiming in on behalf of the whorde of lurkers who have seen this phenomenal show already. These threads are dipping in participation quickly, but don't think that means any less people are reading your posts. First-time viewer comments especially, that's like the cocaine of comments for us fanboys.

**I beseech all you other lurkers, if you won't comment, at least vote on these threads. Let's make our presence known**
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been very active in these threads as I'm unfortunately a lot busier than I thought I would be when I scheduled this rewatch back in mid-January, but I've at least had the time to read all of the comments.  I'd like to thank everyone who has been participating so far as I've really enjoyed reading the first time impressions as well as the essay dumps from people who have seen this show before.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the lost match of peco has so much more weight (doesn't stick out from the other comments I think, since everyone is jerking off over wenge, lol no offense, I like him too)

He was better than demon all his live, and since he builds his ego on wins (and earlier wins against demon) he starts to lose trust in himself (or lost all of his confidence). For me, this is one of the two main story points of peco.
>> ARTICLE
It really is, but Peco's story is that [PING PONG SPOILER](/s "of a hero. He hasn't reached his nadir yet, I'll be discussing him more in detail then.")
>> ARTICLE
yeah, I just wondered why nobody seemed to pick up on it ;)
>> ARTICLE
You're right, but to me today was the best time to discuss Kong. There's a lot of people to focus on since Ping Pong's cast is so fantastic, so I have to make very specific choices. For instance [PING PONG SPOILER](/s "if I had chosen episode five to discuss Kong, I would miss the best chance to discuss Demon's role in the show.")
>> ARTICLE
you're right. can't write about everybody all at once.
>> ARTICLE
All four of the top spots were from Kaio Academy? Well, with a training regiment like they just showed us at the end there, it makes a lot of sense. Demon got so much better, I feel bad for Peco losing, but hard work and training do almost always trump natural talent when they're put up against each other like that. And I like it that way very much more. 

I almost couldn't believe Wenge lost too, I thought they were setting up Kazama to be someone who would be within Peco's reach and Smile would be able to beat, but his performance was amazing! I thought Wenge was going to dominate the whole thing, he wasn't even talking much about Kazama, it was all Tsukimoto that he was worried about. But didn't Wenge play against anyone else from Kaio? Is Kazama so much better than everyone else at Kaio that Wenge and Tsukimoto really were the other two best players there, or was Wenge just unprepared for Kaio's players altogether?

And now Kong starts on his road to becoming Best Guy.

**'You are not fit to hold a racket.'**

Today's episode marks the start of the balancing act of plot lines. So far the plot has been tight and straightforward, with clear focus on one and the same goal: Inter High. But now that we are finally there and all our mains are in the same place, it's time to start diverging the plot lines, fraying the rope so to speak, the anti-thesis to tying up loose ends. 

That also makes it quite hard for me to tackle a single subject today since there is no extremely obvious choice. And since a lot of the characters still need to truly start their arcs (the only one who is already on the way out of our mains is Smile), I can't focus on that either, which puts me in a small bind. 

Luckily there's no need for a Houdini act or anything. Today's episode did show a lot of one specific theme, so that is what I will discuss: today's subject is **the dark side of competitive sport.** 

And by that I don't mean 'talent vs. hard work,' which is the darkest most sports shows are willing to turn. That whole shebang will come around later, as no show examining competitive sports can avoid the subject, nor would it want to. Anyway, by 'dark side of competitive sport' I mean one simple fact: reality can be harsh and uncompromising. Only one person can win a match, only one team or player can win a tournament. There is only one spot at the top of the podium. 

That means that it is inevitable that there will be losers with similar ambitions, hopes and dreams compared to the winner(s). Sports movies, shows and even real-life broadcasts of large sporting events like, nay, *love* to portray tales of heroes prevailing against all odds, fairy tales that warm the hart. But often we forget that for every such tale, there are dozens of failures, disappointments and nightmares. Most people cannot achieve their dreams, through whatever reason, but no matter how understandable the reason, it doesn't make reality any easier to swallow. It's not a painkiller hidden amongst the candy, it's a suppository delivered by cannon.

Ping Pong places a lot of emphasis on that today: it reminds us that the losers are also people. The first time they do it is with the first round opponent of Smile. I kinda want to give him a name, but the usual name I give to him is sort-of spoilerish... so let's call him sea-guy. I really want to give sea-guy a name, because he is one of the most memorable throwaway characters you'll probably ever encounter. His introduction here is sort of brutal, well, you can replace 'sort of brutal' by 'all sorts of brutal'. He's a third year whose dream it is to reach the nationals in what will be his final tournament...

And just like that his dream gets destroyed in a farce of a game by a first year opponent who insults his hard-earned skill because he wanted to 'blow off some steam', such is the skill gap between the two. It's brutal to the point of cruelty, he even gives up on Ping Pong altogether. [Like he says himself](http://i.imgur.com/nqf8qhJ.jpg), reality is harsh and if you're not good enough, then that's it. 

The second time makes that statement clear enough: I'm talking about Kong's second round opponent. In desperation at seemingly overwhelmingly low odds of success, he receives a pep talk from the girl he likes and starts believing in his chances: Goliath is not perfect, he has weaknesses and he can be defeated! He gets himself all rallied up to face the giant... but he's no David and Goliath is still Goliath. A fly doesn't crash an airplane, it gets obliterated. Power of love? Get that shit out of here! Reality is reality: there's nothing anybody or anything can do about it. Of course, there are a lot of factors determining the outcome of reality, but the message is loud and clear: miracles are one in a billion and dreams are mostly just that. 

With that knowledge firmly ingrained we go into the third match, the main event and first battle of consequence: Smile vs. Wenge. Up until now I've discussed the common, but relatively inconsequential concept of dreams and how reality is incompatible with most of them. But inn today's main match, as is the case with competitive sports, the stakes are much higher. For Kong, winning doesn't just mean winning: to him, it's his last chance at redemption. Forget small dreams like 'making nationals': here we're talking an entire career, the culmination of an entire childhood sacrificed for the sake of livelihood that's at risk. He loses and it's game over.

But reality (I promise this is the last time I'll use this word today) doesn't care about stakes. It is uncompromising, unstoppable and inevitable. Kong starts out mighty and confident, overly so: we can already tell that things are bound to go south. When they inevitably do, desperation sinks in and Kong's coach reminds him exactly what's at stake here, a well-needed wake-up call for Kong. 

And then, in his hour of need, he pulls off the comeback. But wait, you say, doesn't that go against everything you've been saying in this post?! Well let me ask you: does [this](http://i.imgur.com/TRyI2eq.jpg) look like the face of someone who defied reality (I lied again...) and rallied himself to a miracle comeback? 

Or is the truth behind the avoidance of the seemingly unavoidable outcome of this match not just as ugly as what would probably have been? 

So with all of that said, let me end this post with the reason I chose today's quote. For all the cruelty in the world of competitive sports, there is always some comfort to be found even in defeat, however little. Comfort in the fact that you did all you could, comfort in the fact that the opponent showed the truth and nothing but the truth, no sugarcoating or salt-rubbing, opening up a sort-of 'c'est la vie'-acceptance that provides a platform to move forward from.

But someone like Smile doesn't provide that. He doesn't care about winning, he doesn't adhere to the moral code embraced by all who are serious about a sport. Against Peco he sugarcoated, against sea-guy he rubbed salt. Losing against such an opponent is insulting, winning against someone like this is patronizing. 

Playing against an opponent who doesn't play to win is the worst thing possible: Smile doesn't have the right to hold a racket. He makes a harsh world that much uglier: he needs to change.

**OST OF THE DAY:** Not as clear cut as previous or upcoming days, in fact, there's no favorite at all. I'm going with a piece that has been long overdue for the spotlight: today's choice is [China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ_fVM3R0R4)

**SCENE OF THE DAY:** I'm going to go ahead and leave today's award blank, nothing stood out to me especially. I'll save it for future episodes in which I'll be spoiled for choice really

*Side notes:*

- Today's episode really introduced Manabu *'Demon'* Sakuma, the last of our main five cast members. I'll be talking about him more in-depth in a future write-up.
- I had little time today to really polish my write-up, but tomorrow will hopefully be different, so hopefully others can add more today. Sorry if anyone's disappointed, not exactly happy with this one myself.

You could say this isn't even your final form :P

Man, I'm super hyped for your next posts. This is exactly the type of thing I like to see in rewatch threads. 
>> ARTICLE
I just want to say thanks for the commentary, makes it more enjoyable. 
>> ARTICLE
So I just found out about this rewatch and am so glad to see that you are taking part in it. Your comments on the tatami galaxy rewatch played a large part in making it my favorite show of all time, so keep doing what your doing!

Just out of curiosity, what is your favorite Yuasa work? Since you're obviously a huge fan.
>> ARTICLE
That's... that's a lot of praise. You're making me blush

[](#flattered)

My favorite Yuasa work is still The Tatami Galaxy, Ping Pong really gives it a run for its money though. They are both nigh equal in terms of how much I think they are perfect. The reason I prefer The Tatami Galaxy is because of its narrative structure: it's so creative and ambitious, and executed so flawlessly, I can gush about it for hours (which I did in the re-watch threads). Ping Pong has the better cast by a huge margin, but The Tatami Galaxy is ever so slightly more ambitious.

Kaiba was fantastic at the start, but didn't nail the ending. I need to re-watch Mind Game as I wasn't in a good state of mind for it at the time. Still need to watch Kemonozume.




>> ARTICLE
I love Ping Pong because it doesn't gloss over the tragedy of defeat. Between Peco last episode, and Beach Dude this episode, the show has already begun to show us how the harsh sting of defeat effects our characters.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, it's one of the discerning factors of Ping Pong compared to other sports anime. 

I think it's one of the easiest ways to tell that Ping Pong takes its subject matter (competitive sport) seriously. Defeat hurts. People who don't understand sports will say 'it's just a game', but to the people playing at this level, it's not anymore. It represents more than that. 

Ping Pong gets that right. Defeat at this level is, like you said, tragedy. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not a fan of sports anime but ping pong feels much more than that for me it's my favorite anime of all time seriously cried once or twice between episodes 9-11
>> ARTICLE
	Opening up with some nice butterfly symbolism. Interesting mixed metaphor from Koizumi: Smiles chrysalis will break open soon, and hell become a monster?

	Dragons theme is badass. From what little weve seen of him so far, I wouldnt be surprised to learn that hes as good as China, but he seems much less arrogant. The fact that hes concerned about Smile being a threat when he doesnt even know if Smile is any good is interesting. This guy is serious business.

	YO THIS PING PONG BEAT IS RAD

	Ooh, wow, a Smile vs China match being set up already? I wasnt expecting that for a while. Also, A NEW CHALLENGER HAS APPEARED!!! He looks kinda like what would happen if you took Dragon and Smile and smooshed them into one body, and threw in the creepy vertical Ozu eyes. I hope he gets a cool nickname too.

	Interesting characterization in this scene for Kazama. If Smile is a machine, then Id say Dragon is a soldier. Unlike China he seems like a nice enough guy, but he has the same ruthlessness and drive, plus the discipline to take every opponent seriously. Interesting shot here as well: after a long talk with the bald and dead-serious Kazama, we end the scene with a shot of Kong smirking and combing his hair. It seems that China is driven by pride and arrogance. What drives Dragon?

	WOW KONG THE FUCKING SAVAGE. I love this guy. I dont even love to hate him (even though hes a FUCKING ASSHOLE), I just love that he exists. This is a weird comparison, but hes really reminding me right now of Kotomine Kirei from Fate. Just an irredeemable, unapologetically arrogant piece of shit, and its *awesome*.

	Ill worry about that when I get there. Random hair guy confirmed to lose this game. If theres such thing a death flag for a ping pong match, its that right there.

	YO THERES A GIRL IN THIS SHOW? I really was not expecting that.

	Ah  Demon. That must be the new guy. Fitting name for this guy, since I was just thinking of him as Ozu2.

	I wonder what exactly the story is behind this robot hero. 

	Kong is nervous? I am so hyped for this match. I legitimately have no idea whos going to win But if I were a betting man (and I am) I would put my money on Smile. I think theres more drama to be had by getting him to Nationals and knocking China off his high horse.

	Do your best, Kong. Im good. What a fucking badass. Where did this Smile come from?

	That shot of the ball turning into an airplane turbine was so cool. Thats the kind of stuff that turns a show from a 10 to an 11.

	Falling numbers? Weve entered the Matrix. Tsukimoto the Machine is about to harvest Chinas power.

	The humming stopped, and Kong is getting angry. I sense a turn-around coming. It was implied back in episode one that Smile understands Chinese, right? Is he going to start feeling bad for China and let him win?

	Yep. God fucking damn it, Smile. 

	Hair guy made it to the beach. Good for him. I wonder, is this just pure symbolism, or will he be back in the story again? I do hope he returns.

So, there was a lot of story development in this episode. The plot is moving much faster than I expected, which is great. I wish we had been shown a full bracket for the competition at some point so that I could make more certain predictions, but Im feeling that Peco will lose to Demon next episode. Then either Dragon or China will knock Demon out, and those two will meet in the finals? Probably with China taking the whole tournament  implicitly suggesting that Smile could have won the whole thing if he had actually tried.

Demon is the new addition to our cast. We didnt see much of him today so its hard to make any serious analysis, but Ill throw out some speculation. I think that hell be the main rival and dramatic foil to Peco. The way that they butted heads (literally) shows not just that they have some history, but that they seem to have similar attitudes towards the game. Theyre both energetic and confident, not afraid to talk shit. But while Peco is flippant and carefree, I bet that training under Dragon has instilled a lot more discipline in Demon. He also seems like an angry guy  does he have something to prove? Against Peco specifically or the world in general? Its an attitude that can get him the leg up over somebody like Peco, but wont help much against, say, China. Ill bet that Demon is an even more bitter loser than Peco is so my final prediction for this tournament is that next round, he gets skunked by Kong in just as dramatic and brutal a fashion as Peco did. Well see what happens to him from there. Demon seems to be great material for a serious antagonist, not just a rival. Im excited to see more of him tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
Thankfully we get to see a bit more of Beach Guy in the coming episodes. He is my favorite side character, and it's surprising how much development he gets in the short moments of screentime he gets. Great speculation, I love hearing this stuff from first time viewers, don't want to confirm or deny anything, but I really did enjoy reading it.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed writing it. I am absolutely loving this show so far. My daily anime routine has become an episode of Ping Pong, an episode of Texhnoloyze for that rewatch, and then whatever aired that day and whatever I want after that. The only issue is that I can't focus on other shows, because by the time I finish Texhnolyze, I just want to go back to Ping Pong again.
>> ARTICLE
I know how hard it is to not watch ahead. I've been watching ping pong off my Blu Ray set, and it autoplays the next episode after one finishes. It's super hard to press pause and eject the disc just so I can stay with the watch group. If I didn't stop myself, I'd have finished it in two days.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 3
Alright, now things are heating up! We dive into the first tournament of the series, the championship qualifiers. Top 4 move on to nationals.

**The Robot With a Heart**

As the episode opens up we see Smile going to visit Joe after his collapse during their match. Just outside the house Smile runs into Koizumis wife. Smile decides not to come inside after she tells him that Joe is doing alright. We see a brief shot of a bird flying away, which I think might be a symbol of Smile not wanting to confront his coach after what happened during their match. She invites him to come over and visit sometime, and surprisingly he says yes. We then cut to Joe and his wife talking, he remarks that he will become a monster one day, his crystalus is about ready to burst, and he just needs a push in the right direction. I love this scene for a couple reasons, because of the slow pan down to the roomba and [Slight PP Spoilers](/s "it shows how much Smile reminds Joe of his younger self. He is trying to push smile to become a butterfly and realize his true potential, just like Butterfly Joe when he was younger"). The camera panning down to the roomba is a great way of sneaking in that symbol of Smile.

**Kaio Academy Meeting**

This meeting is a cool scene, and it develops Kazama a bit more. The man talking to Kazama tells him that he needs to be a public success to advertise the prestige of Kaio Academy. Kazama mentions how he is interested in Smile, and the man appears to know who coach Koizumi is. This man is clearly very trusting of Kazama, because he allows him to choose the players he believes are a good fit for the team. However he also follows that up with the line If we lose, you will take responsibility which sets a great amount of pressure squarely on his shoulders. Well come back to this idea, in a little bit.

**Tamura Table Tennis**

Not much to mention in this scene, but I noticed a really neat detail that some rewatchers might have missed. Pay close attention to the motion that Peco makes with his arm when he wins. Also its interesting that the old lady at the table tennis dojo mentions that she doesnt like it one bit that coach Koizumi and Smile are working together.
I absolutely adore how the the music and the animation cuts are put together in the first scene after the OP finishes. One of my favorite tracks in the series, over an awesome, comic/manga style of images showing the practice and setup for the tournament.

**Headbutting Rivals**

Heres the first scene where we get introduced to the Demon also known as Sakuma Manabu. He has a brief mention in the last episode where it is revealed that he grew up playing at Tamura Table Tennis, alongside Smile and Peco. Him and Peco will be facing off in one of the later rounds. Demon is another favorite character of mine, and we will learn a bit more about him in the next episode. At the end of this scene when Demon and his coach are walking to the bus, the coach mentions that Kazama is in the bathroom and that youll understand how hard it is for him someday which alludes to the incredible pressure to succeed that is put upon him.

**Harsh Words From the Dragon**

Here we see Kazama sit down in the isle next to Smile and talks to him for a bit. Before they get into the meat of their conversation, they take a look a Kong in his match. Kazama remarks that with such a gap in skill levels, Its actually harder to tell how good Kong really is. Smile remarks that hes gone too far, and that someone cant bounce back from an embarrassment of that level. Kazama explains that Kong knows the terror of table tennis more than anyone, because this is his last chance to succeed. If he fails to produce results, its basically the end of his career. It is at this point that Kazama states that he hates the way Smile plays. He finds his regard for his opponents emotions repulsive, and bluntly calls him out for it.

**Smiles First Round Match**

Leading up to his first round match, it is clear Smile is upset with what Kazama said to him. He claims he will have his match finished in 5 minutes, half the time that Kong took in his match. Here we meet Egami as MAL calls him. Im just going to call him Beach Dude though. Smile takes out his frustration on this insecure, gloomy, senior. He reminds me a bit of myself when I played sports back in high school. So Ive got a soft spot for him. After being crushed by Smile, he decides to give up ping pong, and visit the sea. Definitely my favorite side character. Immediately after his match, Smile looks up at Kazama and says devoting your life to table tennis is nonsense, its revolting I absolutely love this sequence, it shows the differences between the outlooks both of these characters have on the game.

One thing I really like about Ping Pong as a series, is that it also focuses on the losers. I think that it adds a lot of realism to the series. These people our main characters are playing against are characterized enough so they feel like actual people and not generic cannon fodder. The brief scene with the girl telling Kongs next opponent that he might have a chance is cute and give an otherwise nameless faceless character that little bit of sympathy.

**Brief Talk About Heroes**

Smile talks with Peco a bit about if he believes in heroes, it doesnt make much sense now but its important later. Peco says that those kinds of heroes only exist in manga, which I thought was a bit cheeky seeing as Ping Pong was a manga series, though I could just be reading into that a bit too much. Its a little sad to hear Smile say that hes been waiting for the hero to come for a long time. I also think its interesting that the text my name is keep popping up with the footage of the hero. We really dont know what all this hero business is about yet.

**Robot Mode Disengaged**

Here we see Kazama and the Demon talking in the bathroom right before Smile and Chinas match. Here Kazama drops my favorite quote of the episode, the thing is, talent isnt something given to only those who want it. We move on to the match, with is played over Smiles humming. Smile seems to be up against the ropes, losing a game to Kong. However he was using the first game to analyse Kongs style and get him to predict the wrong strokes. He quickly comes back until he hears Kongs coach yelling at him. This snaps him out of his robot mode and it seems that Smile lost on purpose, but was this a good idea? At the very end of the episode, we see that Beach Dude made it to the sea.

Overall this episode was really good, Im very much looking forward to the next episode as its one of my favorites in the series. Its time for the revised character rundown!

I thought it would be fun to come up with a list of each of the characters as they appear and list their motivations, goals and symbols as we find them out. I encourage anyone who is interested to help me add to this so we can keep it up to date for the rest of the episodes.

**Smile - Makoto Tsukimoto**
Wants to have fun, plays ping pong to pass the time. Not serious about winning, able to enter robot mode to turn off his emotions and release the power of apathy.
Symbols so far: Robot, Hero

**Peeco - Yutaka Hoshino**
Hates losing, desires victory above all else. Wishes to be number 1 in the world, but thinks his natural talent is enough to get him there. Rarely practices, eats poorly. Has an ongoing rivalry with Demon.
Symbols so far: Candy?

**China - Kong Wenge**
Kicked off Chinese team, stuck in Japan until he can prove himself as a good enough player to return home. Strong willed, practices hard, but seems to underestimate the Japanese players. If he loses before nationals he has almost no chance to return home and his career is essencially over.
Symbols so far: Airplane

**The Dragon - Ryuuichi Kazama**
The star player at the top Ping Pong school. Has tremendous pressure put on him to succeed, spends time before matches in the bathroom. He seems confident that he is the best player around, and despises Smiles way of playing.
Symbols so far: Dragon?

**Demon - Sakuma Manabu**
One of the Vanguard players at Kaio Academy, childhood friend of Smile and Peco. Has an ongoing rivalry with Peco. Admires Kazama, and is jealous of his interest in Smile.
Symbols so far: Demon?

**Jou Koizumi**
The coach of the Katase high school team, we dont know his nickname yet or many of his motivations. He sees great potential in Smile and wants to give him the drive to win.
Symbols so far: Butterfly

**Beach Dude - Egami**
Senior, disgracefully loses his last high school tournament in the first round to Smile. Decides to give up on ping pong and go to the beach. Fickle, insecure, gloomy.

I will be adding more to this list when we learn more about the main and side characters, let me know if I missed anything or you have something you want to see added. I really enjoyed writing this up and I hope you enjoyed reading it. Lets get some discussion going!
>> ARTICLE
Back at it again ~~at Krispy Kreme~~ with more first-timer thoughts!

- So it's more or less confirmed at this point that the coach is [the butterfly from the last episode](http://imgur.com/AgYQiXW), right? The straightforward train of thought here is that the coach made some mistake in his past that cost him his professional career, and wants Smile to avoid making the same decisions that he did.
- Oh, Peco's already playing again. That was fast. ~~I'm not too clear on how much time has passed between last episode and this one.~~ Apparently it's two months, according to a comment in yesterday's thread.
- Judging from Kazama's conversation with Smile, I'm guessing not too many people have actually seen The Robot in action.
- Wow, this show is absolutely blazing through this tournament.
- The Robot is out in full force and it looks like Smile is going to take the match - but then Wenge's coach shouts and Smile's immersion is broken. He realizes what winning this match will do to Kong and falls back into his bad habits, ultimately losing the match.
- I liked the beach guy but I don't exactly know what to say about him, so I'll leave that to the other users.

----

This show makes a very deliberate decision in terms of what it shows to the viewers and what it doesn't. We don't see the two months that pass between this episode and the previous, which includes Smile deciding to play to win and Peco deciding to play at all. I guess the show has already made that quite clear by the end of episode 2 and decides to cut out what would basically be a training montage.

We get to see bits and pieces of Wenge's match - not much, but enough to understand that he's determined to win and that he's head and shoulders above most of the others. We also get to see bits and pieces of Smile's match - again, not much, but enough to understand that he's *mad* about Kazama's accusations, and he's got talent and skill as well. Most of these two matches aren't shown, because we don't need to see them. Peco's matches aren't shown, nor are Kazama's.

Finally, we get to the climax of the episode - Smile vs. Wenge, and we're treated to three (well, two) games of the Robot in action, before Wenge's coach unintentionally snaps Smile back to reality. More interestingly, we *don't* get to watch Smile lose, because we've seen everything we need to. The show cuts to the aftermath: [Kong's arms are raised high, but he's not happy about how he won](http://i.imgur.com/Hw2nh4q.jpg). Smile doesn't look too fazed, but Coach is pretty disappointed.

I'm rambling at this point, I don't really know what to make of this. Good episode overall. The animation during Smile/Wenge's match felt a little lacking; overall it felt like Wenge's game vs. Peco in the first episode had a lot more "oomph" to it for some reason.

Let me just say this: It's really freaking hard for me to not binge watch all of these episodes. I think this is my fourth time watching the series, and no matter how many times I've tried before I've always ended up binge watching them... Ugh this rewatch is killing me!


Anyways, onto the main point:

#Comparisons of playstyles from this episode and the pro players of Super Smash Bros Melee:

Today's episode introduced us to two new characters wearing the uniforms of Kaio Academy: Ryo Kazama and Manabu Sakuma. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see either [Nickname spoilers](/s "the Dragon or the Demon") play in this episode, so we'll have to wait until they do before I get into their playstyles.

However, today we got to see a match showcasing off someone who I forgot to cover in the first episode: Kong Wenge, aka China. Let me tell you right now, Kong getting eliminated in the best guy contest first round after being seeded the lowest is a fucking disgrace; I'm not kidding when I say Kong is one of the coolest characters I've ever seen across any form of media, and I can't wait to see how first-timers react to his development.

Anyways, onto his playstyle. Kong's gameplay doesn't have anything super special about it, to be honest. However, that's not to say that he doesn't have a playstyle, he just has a generic one. I like to deem that style as, simply put, *good*. That's all it is: Kong has the skills, experience, and the confidence to shake fear into those who just watch him play, let alone those who actually have to go head to head with him. His punish game is amazing, he has technical prowess, and is overall a strong player.

However, we see another side of Kong that can be a good or a bad thing. If you haven't noticed yet, Kong is a man playing for his life. Every time he picks up the paddle, he knows he risks never being able to return to China in a dignified fashion. His situation is already one foot in the grave to begin with, being kicked off the Chinese national team for some undisclosed reason. In order for Kong to return to his homeland, he needs to prove to everyone there that they made a mistake for dropping him; should he lose to people in a small country that isn't even that good in the ping pong scene, he can kiss his chances of playing back home goodbye. Having this sense of urgency in his playstyle can either rile him up to play better or stress him out and make him play worse. Only time (and future episodes) will tell us whether or not he utilizes this for his benefit.

#Comparisons to Melee: Leffen

 * Stockholm, Sweden
 * Fox main
 * Sponsor: Team Solo Mid
 * MIOM 2015 rank 3




My fucking god, the resemblance between Leffen and Kong is insane. First things first, their attitudes are almost identical. Kong and Leffen both have a level of arrogance that piss people off to no end, yet they also have the insane skills to back it up. Leffen's trash talk isn't his only strong point in his gameplay: Leffen has the ability to switch his styles between campy and extremely in your face, all while executing tech skill with such precision and technique that you have to respect his play no matter how much he pisses you off.

Not only are their similarities in play and person, but Leffen was also banned from his home scene as well. If you want, you can read up on the notorious [evidence.zip](http://smashboards.com/threads/leffen-is-banned.333990/) scenario that played out a while ago (note: Leffen has gotten considerably better between that thread and now; he's still very brash, however). TL;DR: Armada, currently ranked best player in the world and arguably Best of All Time (BOAT), and others banned Leffen from their Swedish tournies because he was a huge dick to people IRL. Not quite the same reason as Kong (maybe? idk) but still very similar in that they were ostracized by their homes.

And finally, the biggest similarity is their sense of urgency in their play. Leffen is bold, confident, and at his best unwavering in play, no mistakes being made. However, it is really easy to tell that Leffen plays with the goal in mind of proving to everyone else that he is the absolute best - his ban definitely didn't help how others viewed him, and now many years past that incident he's trying his hardest to say to everyone else that he is worth watching, that he is changed for the better and that people need to accept him for his prowess in the game; I doubt he actually cares too much how people personally view him, but he definitely cares about the respect he deserves for being so good at the game he plays.

Unfortunately, the community hasn't had the ability to see too much of leffen as of late due to visa problems (large majority of tournaments are in the US, and he can't easily get a work visa to travel). However, everyone knows that if Leffen is at a tournament he has a damn good shot of winning it all.

To end the comparison, here is one of my favorite sets of Leffen's from right when he was announcing to the world that he is now entering the list of 'Gods': [BEAST 5 GF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO0SqKSsZcQ). Note: this set also features the current ranked 1 player, Armada. Crazy set overall, and I can't wait to see more of Leffen in the future.

--------------------

Idk if y'all can tell, but Leffen is one of my favorite players to watch. I love how he brings a sense of rivalry to the scene, since so many other top players tend to clash with him For a relatively recent incident, look up the twitter beef between him and Chillindude from about a year ago; fucking hilarious stuff, ending in a set that spawned a [diss track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhsOW-_TwfU) and the birth of a Smash meme: [My B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i0PUCX7VEw) (note: that's a set that isn't necessarily the best in terms of gameplay, but holy shit is it a great set). Anyways, I can't wait to get some more episodes down so I can talk about more player comparisons. This shit is honestly really fun, and idc if no one is reading this cause it helps me understand both Ping Pong characters and Melee pros better. Thanks for reading!

I mean Leffen hardly does any trash talking anymore. Pretty much people just trash talk him, money match him, and lose lmao.

Wow, that set was unbelievable. Game 4 was one of the hypest things I've ever seen. Thanks so much for doing these posts. I love Smash but have never had any real understanding of the competitive scene, so these are absolutely fascinating.

no problem! if i can get people interested in the scene, that's fine by me

[Here's](http://imgur.com/a/0isuX) the album of the images I used plus some that I didn't. There's not too many, but most of them are relevant.

[Kazama is under a lot of pressure.](http://i.imgur.com/7i3IrLp.png) And later, Kazama is in the bathroom with [some hints that not everything is hunky-dory.](http://i.imgur.com/zRGkmRt.png)

[Nice way to introduce the tourney.](http://i.imgur.com/rrHqKhZ.png)

[He's really spitting some truth, isn't he?](http://i.imgur.com/vI581yo.png) Peco beats up on his team and everyone else where he usually plays, but that's pretty small time. How could he do any damage at Nationals (if he makes it)? He got destroyed the moment he played some player who is supposed to be good.

Smile is feeling confident, but it doesn't seem like he has the same faith in his friend. Peco feels threatened at how Smile was that aggressive in his match, maybe he's starting to come to a realization here. And the hero talk is always good.

[That glare.](http://i.imgur.com/GHaOF4x.png) Smile *hates* the way Kazama and Kong play. The guys who stake their life on ping pong. The way he has to unwind after Kong's match, he wants to one-up him, due to Kong's mindset and how he embarrassed Peco in their game.

[The ball seems to be coming to him, and his returns feel controlled and effortless.](http://i.imgur.com/Z4K6620.png) Not only that, but he's humming without taking many breaths or breaking his tone... He really is a monster.

[Peco's face here.](http://i.imgur.com/9MudYBZ.png) Is it surprise he's feeling? Maybe even disgust? What happened? He got beat by Wenge so bad but Smile is making it seem almost effortless right now. Again, he could be coming to the realization that Smile is better than him or that Smile let's him win they play each other.

[The shot starts low and comes to an extreme close up, invading his comfort zone just like Smile is.](http://i.imgur.com/iByXMIk.png) He knows he could lose and it just caught up to him. 

[The difference between the coaches, and the way the camera looks down at Peco and his body language makes him look almost child-like](http://i.imgur.com/hPSQ1Nh.png)

[Contrasting his usually smug smirk.](http://i.imgur.com/wcswT37.png)

[Koizumi already knows what's going on.](http://i.imgur.com/MAeo1LT.png)

[Kong knows he didn't truly deserve to win that game.](http://i.imgur.com/Y1VUJOY.png) It wasn't a battle of endurance (with Smile's unbroken humming while playing, he probably could have kept it up for a while), Smile's kind heart thought Wenge looked pathetic and that winning the match would be worse than Wenge winning. It's like what he talked about with Kazama earlier.

That look is sadness mixed with confusion. Peco is realizing that he was being lied to by someone he calls a friend.

http://i.imgur.com/ruEBN5b.png

This was probably part of my favorite shot of the episode (the zoom before it included).  The look Smile gives towards Wenge's coach is just so full of contempt.  It just fits with the title of the episode so well.
>> ARTICLE
Aww shit it's Egami, the GOAT side character.
>> ARTICLE
He is awesome, I love how much characterization they manage to squeeze out of his very limited screentime. He also reminds me a bit of myself back when I played sports in high school.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing too analytical or intellectual to say in regards to first impressions, this episode had me too sucked in to do much thinking.. hah.

First time seeing the actual OP, its legitimately awesome.
Also that song with the rhythmic bouncing of ping pong balls is fantastic. The OST is truly magnificent.

Candidate for [sketchiest guy ever right here.]( https://imgur.com/pyv3nZ4) I mean, what the hell, he looks like some kind of terrorist, how is nobody around him bothered by this. 

The scene with Smiles first opponent speaking with no music or anything in the background is really powerful. I liked that guy and his crush (? Girlfriend?), Im hoping its not the last of them (seeing him on the beach at the end was vaguely... uh, suicidal looking). This show has built up even the side characters incredibly well though. 

Hm, so at the end, Smile conceded to his old ways, having too much consideration for his opponent. Im very much hooked. Intrigued to see the fallout of all this.

>> ARTICLE
It's actually common is Japan and some other Asian countries to wear masks like that when you get sick to prevent spreading illness. Japan also tends to get cold sometimes so keeping a jacket on-hand isn't uncommon either, and sometimes people just wear hats, nothing suspicious about that.
>> ARTICLE
In this episode, the coach switched Smile's racket to one that uses long pips on the backhand side for the match against Wenge. This helps to demonstrate just how talented Smile is as we see he was obviously skilled enough to beat Wenge with very little time to get used to the completely different rubber.

**Rubbers**

In ping pong, there are inverted rubbers which have the pips on the inside and pimpled rubbers that have pips on the outside. Generally, inverted rubbers are most commonly used as they are good for generating a lot of spin. 

With pimpled rubber, there are two main types: short pips and long pips. Short pips are used more for offensive play and can still be used to put a bit of spin on the ball. Long pips on the other hand, are used mostly for defensive play. With long pips, you don't generate the spin yourself but instead, you borrow the spin from the opponent. So if the opposing player makes a really spinny topspin, you would be able to chop it back with even heavier downspin. On the other hand, if an opponent puts no spin on the ball, the ball you return using the long pips would not have a lot of spin either.

**Etiquette**

In this episode, we see Wenge beating his opponents 11-0, which Smile describes as "going too far." In ping pong people will normally give a courtesy point to the opposing player if they are up 10-0. Also, players will sometimes end the game with an [exhibition rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeyxggPkmHQ) if there is a huge score difference.
>> ARTICLE
>In ping pong people will normally give a courtesy point to the opposing player if they are up 10-0.

Very interesting to know. This is like my 3rd time watching this episode and I've always wondered why Smile said Wenge was going too far. Thanks for that!
>> ARTICLE
Smile kicks some ass until he hears Kong's Coach yelling at him.  As soon as I heard the hero theme song hum end, I immediately knew what was going to happen.  Kong won, but looks pissed at the end.  Did he realize that Smile threw the match?  Or was he just tired from that intense match?  

I can't help but feel like going easy on his opponents is going to come back to bite him in the ass, some day.


>> ARTICLE
You know the first two episodes really didn't impress me. But it was just the beginning, expected it to really get into it once the games started. And oh man did it deliver.

This episode blew me away. Even just from the start with the music direction having made a beat with the ping pong noises. That was fantastic.

The way Tsuki grew in this episode was great. You got to another side to him, the smug side.

The line that I absolutely loved was "Oh I know. Kong won his game in ten minutes. I'll just win mine in five." This really showed Tsuki's love for the game. The first two episodes made it seem like he really didn't like the competitive aspect of the sport. But this line showed he had thrill for competition.

I'm really excited for the rest of the series now.
>> ARTICLE
interesting thoughts. I've always interpreted Smile's comment about ending the match in five minutes as him angrily wanting to crush Kong the way Kong crushed that poor kid eleven to zero. 
>> ARTICLE
I usually wouldn't even think of trying a sports anime but everything about this series seems so **different**:

* The psychological aspects of this show are awesome and not too shoved in your face
* I wouldn't say that all the characters are likable but they all have backstory and reasons for the way they act, especially Wenge
* The animation has completely grown on me, I've pretty much gone from very disapointed by it in the first episode to seeing its beauty in its own odd way
* I hope this series delves deeper into the motives/backstory of these characters even more
* Also I love the English VA for Hoshino, i think he was in Zankyou No Terror
>> ARTICLE
When Smile said "Fuyukai desu" I had a Beyond the Boundary flashback.

Smile's "Hero" looks more like a demon, does he not?  Well, nothing wrong with a demonic hero.

The first truly unrealistic moment here, as far as I can tell - playing someone very strong in a tournament with type of paddle that you've never even held before.  Wouldn't you lose the game before you could get used to the paddle?

I guess that's why he lost the first game.  Were the first two rounds best 3 out of 5 too, btw?  They certainly didn't announce the change up...  I think this is the first sports anime I've seen that doesn't mention game rules or tournament structure at all.  I mean I'm not a fan of info dumps, but when you have the viewer thinking "oh he lost a game, it's over" and then they continue playing the next game, that's not very good.

And what's up with the guy who "went out to sea."  Since they showed him again at the end of the episode, I guess he'll either be a recurring character or a suicide.

One thing I like about this show is how realistic the dialog seems to be.  Kudos to both the writers and the translators for a great job done!
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I should finally be caught up and comment nearly on time tonight. 

Was it really a matter of stamina, or did Tsukimoto throw the match so Wenge wouldn't lose his chance to return to China?
>> ARTICLE
Tsukimoto threw the match on purpose. We saw earlier in his first confrontation with Kong that even though he can't understand Chinese Tsukimoto is smart enough to understand the tone of language. 

When he heard Kong's coach yell he realized the gravity of the situation and backed down.

**'People *can* fly'**

Even though I personally like yesterday's episode more (as well as the next one) because they have more emotional impact to me, from an overall critical perspective this episode is nothing short of a masterpiece on all fronts. It showcases everything Ping Pong has in full glory: killer animation that uses the art style, a fantastic OST, great themes and of course an incredible cast of characters.

I've ignored him for a long time and I've said multiple times that I would cast the spotlight on him when the time is right. It should be no surprise now that this was the time I was waiting for. Today's subject is **Kazama**, as well as the aspect of competitive sport he represents: **pressure**

Kazama is quite an unusual character in the sports genre. He starts out as a being so far above the rest in all aspects that no one seems to be able to touch him, which is not unusual in itself: god-like figures are not that uncommon. What's unusual is that his character from then on doesn't 'grow', but rather 'shrinks': he is gradually broken and cracked down to maybe the most pitiful member of our main cast. Even more unusual is the fact that the cracks in his armor come from within himself, from his own state of mind and personal situation.

In one of my previous write-ups I talked about drive and I mentioned how Kazama paradoxically has both the best and worst drive of the whole cast: I clarified that this concerned quantity and quality respectively. In previous episodes his motivation has already been hinted at, but today lays it out in full. 

To put it bluntly, Kazama plays ping pong for the worst reason possible. His father was a failure career-wise and when he died, his family (read: mother and him) was looked down upon and shunned by their own. That is, until Ryuuji's talent for ping pong was discovered and he could contribute in worth to the family through it. His grandfather tried to protect him against the harsh reality by instilling in him an indomitable winning mentality: win, at all costs, never waver, then nobody can ever hurt you. 

Of course, this backfired immensely. With winning and contributing comes expectations and responsibility, and for Kazama a truly humongously disproportionate amount of it, something his little shoulders could not healthily carry. He had to grow stronger and win at all cost, so ping pong became solely a burden to him. He told Sanada yesterday that he played ping pong for the team, which is true at the surface, but an obvious lie beyond it. He told Sakuma that he played ping pong for himself, which is half true but clearly not the whole story. In reality he plays for his family, for the reputation of his father and the status of his mother. He plays out of obligation, out of duty, and out of fear for the alternative. Kazama doesn't know the joy and the freedom anymore: all he knows now, is the pressure.

Pressure in competitive sports is something I haven't seen any sports show do right convincingly. The protagonist simply always steps up in the heat of the moment, rises to the occasion and delivers when he has to. But they never show the other side: the raw anguish it can bring, the crippling, debilitating fear of possible failure churning your stomach, eroding your joy, gnawing away at your state of mind. Ping pong does do so as it is necessary to understand competitive sports.

Because for a lot of people, it's like that. I've played competitive sports when I was young at quite a high level, high enough that some people I played with and against will probably be at the Olympics this year. I miss the excitement and pure joy it can bring, but the singular thing that I miss the least is without a doubt the immense pressure. The having to calm yourself before each match, easing yourself with the backwards thought that 'it's okay to have a bad day', the inability to do anything else with an ounce of conviction before the game. i won't pretend that I could have ever made it big: I simply lacked the talent. But even if I did have it, I still never would have made it because that attitude to pressure means it would have broken me before long.

Kazama is kind of like that. That's why he locks himself into the bathroom before each match, to struggle with the pressure and the fear behind closed doors. Ping Pong displays it as him climbing the wall of an abyss: falling down is no option, so he has to climb up... but with each climb upwards the abyss only gets deeper. The pressure only mounts and never disappears. He can only climb to stave the fear: he can never escape it. He has waited so long for somebody to save him from it that he has stopped believing anyone can truly escape the pressure. He uses the pressure, fear and anguish and throws it at his opponents in the form of his desire to win... only for the loop to start again. Eventually it will break him: his uncle and coach knows and fears it. 

For me, the pressure was something I could never really come to terms with: I never would have succeeded in the world of competitive sports. Because those who succeed are not Kazama or me. The ones who succeed are the ones who never feel the press of the pressure weighing them down to begin with, they feel it lifting their wings. They thrive under it, get the best out of it. The higher the pressure, the higher they can fly. Because they love the game so much that they can never get enough and the pressure only leaves them wanting more. 

Kazama doesn't believe those players to exist, but they do. Peco initially gets overwhelmed by the circumstances, but child Smile and his hero song remind him that none of that ever mattered to him: all that mattered is his immense love for the game. He always flies. 

And so comes the beautiful second half of the game between Peco and Kazama. Peco's flying so high that Kazama has to break his (toilet) cage to follow him: he flies for the first time in a long while. Peco teaches him how to fly, but there can only be one winner and someone has to fall... and that's okay. I wish I could quote the entire ending speech of Kazama, as it's absolutely fantastic writing and voice acting: Kazama is finally free from the weight and fear of pressure and discovers the joy of playing in the moment with all you have, even when losing.

Humans *can* fly, as can dragons... but what about robots?

**OST OF THE DAY:** I'll get some flak for this one. It's not [Peco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yybGF4PmaRo), like most would think. Today's choice is a song that has been played a lot of times already, but never at a more effective time than today: long overdue for the spotlight, it's [Hero Appears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dY4Y43WmXc), the 'awesome stuff is going to happen'-song.

**SCENE OF THE DAY:** It's cheating, I know, but I can't single out anything, so here's the entire [second half of the Peco vs. Kazama match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFV3XzooB3I), even though the ending is the absolute best part for me.

*Side Notes:*

- Look at Peco's shadow in [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/RSzfAmi.jpg). So cool: he really is the hero who becomes stronger in the face of danger. 
- I can't believe we're almost at the end. Tomorrow's write-up will be the last one probably... will any show bring me here again? I see...
>> ARTICLE
finally we know what gives you the energy for these write ups. I also can relate, since I do a sport competitive and this anime pretty sums up every emotion I ever had at competitions. Happiness, optimism, feeling lucky, everything goes right. But then there is the dark side, and thats where this story made me bawl my eyes out, just as I did at my lowest point some years ago.

One more to go! :)

Hero kenzan! Hero kenzan! Hero kenzan!

Hoshino did it! He made Kazama enjoy Ping Pong! I love ya Peco! You did it! Youre the hero! Now you have to save Tsukimoto! The hero did better than slay the dragon, he taught the dragon how to fly with him! 
>> ARTICLE
I started doing a bullet point observation post like I've done for every other episode, but today I had to stop just a few minutes in. This episode was so thick with symbolism and character development I couldn't possibly write down everything I was seeing, and the atmosphere was so intense that pausing every thirty seconds to make another point was ruining it for me. So I watched this one raw, and... wow. If there was any doubt left in my mind that this show was a 10/10, it's gone now. Ping Pong has officially secured its spot in my top five, and has a damn good chance of reaching my top three. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it can make it. The best episode has yet to come. 
>> ARTICLE
I love how under such heavy symbolism and themes, there's a simple core message of "just have fun doing what you love, and you will be happy." How could anyone not smile after seeing Kazama get saved by the Hero?

And yea in case some of you don't already know, the tune that Smile has been humming this whole time is called "Peco" in the OST.
>> ARTICLE
And it was at this episode when I realzied that this is the best show I've ever seen.

I have a question about this episode: is it implied that Kazama's father committed suicide? For all his hatred, "people can't fly" and shit like that, it certainly gives the vibe that his father jumped off that cliff.
>> ARTICLE
It gets pretty muddy when you look at what they show.  His father is talking to him like a small child, and Kazama even *sounds* like a small child in that scene.  At the funeral, he looks a lot bigger, like he does now.  I mean, that could mean his father didn't die then, but it could also just represent a loss of innocence/childhood after his father died.

I think you could honestly interpret it either way and not be wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I missed this on first watch but after this rewatch I'm certain that's the case
>> ARTICLE
Yep, that's the implication. Lost his hero that day and stopped believing ever since.

>Can we watch the last episode already? Thank you.

here it is. the big one. this ep is among, if not my favorite anime ep ever, beating bake's starry sky, tatami galaxy's finale and a others

While this was running someone asked for an anime to cheer you up, I said currently Ping Pong the animation was pure bliss
>> ARTICLE
I loved everyone's reaction when Peco started flying.  Interesting that, like Smile, Kazama was waiting for a hero.

And Smile isn't even watching the match.

I still don't understand why Peco is risking ruining his knee here, instead of letting it heal and doing what he's doing now when he and Smile both move up as part of the Best 4.  What's the hurry?  What's worth the risk?

**'I wish I at least got to spend my eternal exile in Europe... Sweden or Germany or someplace. Japan, huh?'**

Good news, everyone! Somehow the internet connection has recovered sometime today, so I should not have any problems with the coming write-ups. I can't say anything for sure for the future of course, but right now it looks like at least posting them should be fine. 

Speaking of good things, boy was today's episode chock-full of plot. Ping Pong has finally brought our main characters (save Sakuma) together again in one location: that means that it has tied the plot together again and we're heading for the close. As a matter of fact, today's episode already closed one of our character's arcs. So today's subject is, for the second time, my favorite anime character in existence: Kong *China* Wenge

Over the past weeks I've had to mostly ignore Wenge in favour of other characters who deserved the spotlight. So let me start by saying this: man, has Kong changed since the last time I discussed him, or what? I mean, he's still [bad](http://45.media.tumblr.com/3d32e92ec6f1f61cba9d065890323d5b/tumblr_n6ta68LErr1qj5jqso3_500.gif) [ass](http://i.imgur.com/mMlgOch.jpg) and [fabulous](http://i.imgur.com/STOcSQn.jpg), of course, but he's definitely become an entirely different person.

The whole episode is structured to highlight that change, at least the parts focused on him. To begin, his introduction in today's episode is a carbon copy of the one we got in episode 3 at the start of the previous year's pre-lims. That is, of course, highly intentional. It's the same trick I highlighted in one of my write-ups for The Tatami Galaxy, though this time used much smaller in scale: use repetition to simultaneously hammer home the repeated, as well as draw attention to what's different.

In this case,  the latter is really hard to tell, as the scenes are nearly identical... but to me, the most important and perhaps only different thing is that this time, after Kong's coach asks him if he's homesick, his laugh is actually genuine. It shows he has become more open in attitude towards others, both those close to him and not very much. He's displaying his own emotions instead of posturing to hide them. 

The following conversation with his coach is also proof of that. Back in episode 3 he also had a conversation with his coach around this time, but back then he was posturing and generally being an ass, while his coach had to warn him not to lose focus. In this conversation, there's none of that: the scene is so much different. Instead, he talks about how much confidence and belief he has in the progress of his team. He's so much more open, so much more positive and relaxed. He openly states his intentions for the tournament, but they aren't stated with bitterness, but with a hopeful attitude. His coach only encourages him a little and states he has complete faith in him.

All of this has also changed his playing style for the better. His game against the Kaiou player is him in complete focus and treating his opponent like a worthy one: no underestimation, no holding back, no loss of focus. It's entirely different from what we saw in the first tournament. 

To make things even more apparent, there's the conversations he has with his team members. Earlier there's the discussion about the shoes, in which he doesn't looks down on the idiots falling for the marketing trick, but instead spins it into a remark to boost their self-esteem. Then later, there's the whole conversation where his teammates are celebrating victorious matches. The whole conversation is just so good-natured and warm, it's hard to believe that the guy at the center of it all is the same as the one who despised every single person on his own team at the start. Just take the last remark he makes about slumbering talent: Kong Wenge from episode 1 would never, *ever* make that remark to anyone he considered not worthy. 

Kong has become a calmer, more open and honest person. This is again evident in the match against Peco. He starts losing points and losing the match. But he doesn't panic or choke, or writhe in despair. He stays calm and collected, focused on his game, tryin to overturn the match, even trying to (unsuccesfully) unhinge Peco mentally.

But this is reality and change doesn't magically ix things. Not all tales can end in perfection. As I said, there can only be one winner to a tournament and Kong is not the one meant for the honor. Peco is, as we all either knew or at the very least expected, freakishly talented and Kong is again denied his ticket home... this time forever. 

It's a tragedy... but is it really? Kong accepts his fate without anger, fear or despair, but with a heartfelt goodbye. He'll never return home like he hoped too, but looking at his screaming teammates, he still has a home, a place to belong, so he can let it go. And that's a victory if I've ever seen one.

**OST OF THE DAY:** It's slightly cheating, since the full glory if this track on the OST doesn't really come to the fore in this episode, but since I'll be spoiled for choice in the next episodes, I'll put it here anyway: the glorious and ultimate hype song [Hero Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62qWI7CpIds)

**SCENE OF THE DAY:** It has to be the end of Kong and Peco's match, but specifically [this moment](https://45.media.tumblr.com/fb50a17eae11d6924d5057ce340d92b3/tumblr_n6cy7qGJ7G1qenvj9o1_500.gif) is absolutely fantastic: Wenge's dream of returning home being let go in the form of the airplance flying away without him. Him having a smile on his face indicates that he has accepted it and that we should too... oh who am I kidding, I'm broken inside ;_; Wenge is amazing, he deserves to be happy GODDAMMIT!!

*Side Notes:*

- There's a LOT of stuff to see in this episode and therefore also a lot to miss. One thing I never noticed before this viewing is that in the scene between Obaba and Koizumi, when Koizumi agrees to sign Peco up for the tournament, the letters start appearing before Koizumi starts writing. Perhaps it's just budget saving and I'm reading too much into this, but to me this represents the fact that Peco was 'destined' or born to be in the coming tournament. 
- Notice how Smile doesn't watch Peco's difficult match against Kong: he 'already knows he will win'. Blind trust, maybe more than that: remember this first-timers, cause it will be important.
- Kazama is the only one who I've mostly ignored up until now: don't worry, he'll get his focus in due time. 
- The next three episodes will be amazing, I'm so excited to discuss them with all of you!

	The Interhigh comes again! My hype knows no limits. My biggest fear is that since one dropped match means elimination, there are still so many matchups I want to see that might never come about. Although I guess now that Demon is out, a final four consisting of our remaining main cast is theoretically possible.

	Peco, you *fucker*. Im glad youre taking ping pong seriously now, but go to class! Have you actually learned nothing??

	Tamura thinks Peco can slay the Dragon, huh? Im really excited to see how he does at the Interhigh. Smiles reputation is spreading, but nobody thinks to worry about Peco. Koizumi didnt even know hes still playing. Its so frustrating how I want to see Peco, China and Kazama all play each other, and I also want all of them to win.

	Wow! All that, and we just hit the opening! I cant believe how much this show sucks me in.

	Does Smile have his glasses belted on around the back of his head? I guess its useful to keep them from falling off while he plays, but it still looks pretty goofy.

	How do these practice robots work? Its a cool idea, but I have a hard time imagining that they can really, accurately replicate the playstyle and skill of a specific person.

	Poseidon making mad cash today. Asshole Grandpa Kazama is truly an evil genius.

	THE PECO/KONG REMATCH! ITS HAPPENING! ITS HAPPENING! I have no idea who I want to win! Kong still needs his revenge on Smile and Dragon, but Peco cant have a life-changing epiphany followed by a training montage only to lose in the second round!

	Best coach is back!  C H I N A B O Y S !

	Ooh, so whoever wins the Peco/China match is going to face down Kazama, and whoever wins that can get to the finals against Smile. Assuming that Smile beats Sanada at least, which is pretty likely but I really cant count anything out in this show, especially after Sanada had his moment in the spotlight with Yurie last episode.

	China is so proud of his team! Thats adorable.

	Ball tricks immediately followed by Its time to dance? Kong is truly the Ultimate Cool.

	These are all the same shots as we saw in Kongs first match against Peco, arent they? I definitely recognize the topspin bounce into the wall and the return that goes way too high. I wonder if this guy will become significant at all after his match. I kinda hope not, there arent many episodes left, so Id like to focus on our main cast. And having to keep track of a third muscle bald Kaiou dude would be awful.

	China with the classic victorious hair comb. Hes feeling himself right now.

	Dragon in the bathroom. Hold in there, buddy. Im becoming more and more certain that his arc is going to end in defeat, but hopefully with his loss hell be finally free from the pressures that his grandpa and uncle put on him.

	Ni hao! Peco you cocky *fuck*. Dont get ahead of yourself now. Chinas still a badass. You might have received a training montage, but he was giving them.

	Peco with the secret backhand technique! Comeback denied, China!

	Smile made a joke! Its character development, guys!

	Rest in peace, Kongs dreams. Fucking shit, man. He better get some happy resolution in the last three episodes or Im gonna be mad as hell.

The tournament episodes of this show are so incredibly good. Theres so much tension, and I can never say with any degree of certainty who I think will win or even who I want to win. Today I think I have a fairly confident prediction, but I wouldnt be surprised at all if I turn out to be completely wrong. Smile will make it to the finals. If he throws against Sanada I will be shocked and frustrated to such a degree that Im not even willing to think about it. Peco has to beat Dragon, for a number of reasons: Tamura said that she thinks Peco is better than him (and as a tough but kindly old mentor figure in a sports show she definitely knows what shes talking about), and Dragon needs to lose in order to examine why he plays and whats important to him. Finally, the Butterfly Joe story is pretty explicit foreshadowing. Peco will injure his knee in the process of winning his match against Kazama, but he is now so motivated by his dreams that he will insist on continuing to play in the finals. Smile will be faced with the exact same decision as Koizumi all those years ago, and will make the same choice. It will be a return to his old self who cares enough about other peoples feelings to play down for them, and will prove that he is not just a robot, he is a human being with his own emotions and desires and empathy. Peco will go on to win the gold medal, Smile will find meaning in life and smile, Dragon will quit ping pong and start a flower-arranging business with Yurie, and Kong will keep training until he successfully wins nationals next year and gets to go home. Everybody is happy.

Except me, because I never get to see the Kong/Smile, Kong/Dragon, or Smile/Dragon match-ups I crave. And also because this incredible show is over.

The end.

I cant wait to see how wrong I am.

I agree with your first point. Double elimination would probably take too much time for a high-school tournament but I sure as hell would want to see it. Loser's bracket finals would be soooooooo hype leading up to Grand Finals

I think the finale will leave you quite satisfied, even when your predictions are wrong.
>> ARTICLE
My predictions being wrong is what made me give this show a 10/10. If I can guess the ending before the final episode I usually knock off a point or two depending on how hard they were trying to hide it.
>> ARTICLE
that's an interesting condition for 10/10, but I think I get what you're saying.
>> ARTICLE
It's not as harsh as it sounds, but a 10 has to be perfect and predictability isn't a good quality. 

There are exceptions to the rule for certain occasions though. If the ending is heavily foreshadowed or even directly stated and the show is more about the journey and not the destination then the rule is usually exempt. 
>> ARTICLE
And so ends Kong Wenge's dream of winning his way back to China, huh? He's come such a long way as a person though, his coach was right, it really was just the beginning of his life, his loss last year. 

Peco has gotten so good! I can't wait to see how he does against Kazama. Kazama's training was freaking crazy, so many ping pong robots, on what looked like a moving floor, shooting multiple balls. No wonder they call him the monster. But the Hero can defeat the monster, can't he?

Let's ask the question ourselves, then: Who does Kazama play ping pong for? he clearly plays like his life is on the line, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he's doing it because he wants to.

he plays for his family and their honor, he plays for the team such that they don't become washed up. he plays for his granddad and Poseidon, in order to promote sales and help business grow. but after all of that i wonder if he is really doing it because he wants to, not because he feels obligated.

have you ever done something because you felt obligated to do it instead of you just wanting to do it? that's Dragon's main dilemma here. i'm pretty sure he hates the game right now

edit: also, is that even this episode? lol
>> ARTICLE
I am not sure yet, since I just saw it a little while ago for the first time. I think it might one of two things. It might be that he is playing to bring back honor to his family and his school, he thinks that if he doesn't win everything he will be keeping his family in shame. My other idea is that he doesn't even know why he plays, but from when he first started to do well he got the idea somewhere that needed to keep playing, so playing for himself to please his cousin and Sakuma, playing for his team because he knows they work hard at it too, playing for the school because he wants his school to still be good, and he plays for business so his father's mats and shoes can be successful; they are all actually true in a way, but in reality he doesn't even like it at all, so he just gives which ever reason is best for who he is talking to. 
>> ARTICLE
I think he's giving Sanada the answer Sanada wants to hear. His answer to Akuma is what he really believes, but it's not true. When we see him training on his own against three robots, on a treadmill, he falls and gets back up and says to himself "I will become stronger." Kazama is motivated by a need to prove himself the best, but he doesn't want that for himself. It traces back to what that guy told Yurie last episode. After Ryuu's father's death, his uncle's side of the family shamed them over his failures in business. Ryuu loved his father, but has had it drilled into his head that the man was a failure; thus his "there are no heroes" attitude. So he's not trying to be the best because he wants to be, he's trying to be the best because his uncle and grandfather have forced him into a position where his family's reputation is entirely on his back as a player.
>> ARTICLE
In the manga it's a honest answer. He is only playing for himself. The anime fucked up.
>> ARTICLE
Well said. 

To Sakuma, anything other than "for myself" would probably hurt him. Kazama might think it demean Sakuma's hard work. Though yeah, he's probably lying to himself about that if he believes it.

There's no major spoilers here, and most of it we already know. Just being safe.

[Ping Pong The Animation](/s "In the last episode Koizumi asks Kazama's grandpa why he plays Ping Pong. He says "for all of us, of course", and the old lady calls him a liar. Being the face of Kaio and his team, saying the team is a similar answer, and it's Kazama's only answer. It's the answer that's expected of him. In addition to the family stuff, he's lying to at least one person to please them and maintain expectations. I'd say that at this point, he could also be conflicted about his answer. Especially given his reactions to his uncle and Yurie asking him about it. Even if he knows he's not truly playing for himself, he wouldn't admit it.")

When did he say that to Sakuma? I don't really remember, but context and who was around might be important. 
>> ARTICLE
When I first watched this episode sometime last year, this is the part of the show where I saw very little reason for me not to give this a 10/10 rating. And of course, the last 3 episodes delivered and it became one of my favorites. Those final moments of Kong accepting defeat were directed beautifully.

I'm super busy this week, so the posts will (probably) be shorter and I'm going to have to limit the screen shots.

Even Yurie is asking Kazama why he plays, with his team and the merchandise (or all together: grandpa) being her tools for questioning him.

This is the second time Koizumi has asked what are the chances are that "x beats y". First he asked Kazama about Smile's chances of beating him, now he's asking the old lady about Peco's chances of beating smile. The situation is completely opposite, really; from Smile being the underdog to being favoured, to asking a player to asking a coach, to the answers. The answers reflect the players in question though. Kazama must be supremely confident and unwavering, whereas Peco is more volatile and it's easier to tell his mindset. So this and the hero talks sets Peco and Kazama up as opposites, and we might be able to predict the outcome of Peco v Kong just from all of that.

Kazama's training regime. Holy shit. And he's playing against 3 (?) Smile's? Impressive... Scary.

I love Kong and his coach together.

So everyone except the top players bought the shoes. Suckers. Kazama was dismissive about them to his team, Kong was trying to look on the bright side and keep his team positive.

Kong's footwork practice has paid off. Really does look like he's dancing in his first match.

Kazama in the familiar spot. Isolated, away from the team, trying to keep/get himself in the dragon mentality. 

Kazama's team has been weaker since he came to the forefront (comparatively of course), Kong's team has improved a lot. Maybe he's sowed the seeds for a successful ping pong program going forward. "Maybe talent is sleeping somewhere inside you." - good Kong, he'd make a good coach.

The hero posing/taking flight with the moon in the background. Seems important, no?

"Go over the data on Hoshino of Katase again" - bish please, your data is irrelevant now.

[Hell yes, love it.](http://i.imgur.com/dhp7U3o.png)

[This kid right here.](http://i.imgur.com/RtRuQub.png)

Gotta admit, [this hurts a bit.](http://i.imgur.com/bzEphj2.png)

[What a great transition.](http://i.imgur.com/UwXeO79.png)

[The hero has appeared.](http://i.imgur.com/hNTnOTY.png) So signs are certainly pointing to a Kazama v Peco game, but Kazama doesn't believe in heroes. The clash of ideals.
>> ARTICLE
It was funny how the top players ignored the special mat shoes, including the shoe spokesman.

I loved Smile's trolling sensei with "I lost".

How does the tournament structure work?  What's the point of having "Best 4 move on" if all it takes is a loss against a single opponent to be knocked out?  Kong is probably one of the top 4 players skill wise, but he's eliminated by another of the top 4 in the second round...  Or am I misunderstanding and only the *winner* of this tournament counts as one of the Best 4?

I gotta say, Peco started out extremely annoying, but he's my favorite character now.

its just a normal single-elimination, bracket-style tournament. they say "best four" but what they probably mean is "final four."

**'Who would your hero be?'**

Maybe some of you missed it, but some unfortunate circumstances are leaving me unable to have a solid internet connection, so posting write-ups has been a huge difficulty. Simply said, submitting any reddit post has become a game of chance in which I suspect the odds of success become lower the more data I send at a time. I'll still try to send them in full, but in all likelihood I'll try to post them in split parts, so forgive me for doing multiple posts in response to myself, or even double-posting sometimes. Believe me, if I could do this any other way I would, this has become a real pain in the ass, but I want to finish these write-ups if I can.

Anyway, with that logistic announcement out of the way, it's time for today's episode. Again the episode is a bit over the place, as Ping Pong now needs to tie its threads together again as it gears up for the finish. So today, let me talk about another immensely important aspect of competitive sport: **drive**. Drive is hard to exactly define, because it's actually two different concepts. 

The first is how far you are willing to go to accomplish something. It's easy to see how immensely important that is to any player on a top level. Without a sufficient drive, you'll barely ever make it in the world of competitive sport, unless you can offset it by huge margins elsewhere... and I'm talking insane margins to make it as an average player on the top level. Drive is insanely important.

For Ping Pong we have seen varying levels of drive among our main characters and it's easy to see how much influence it has had on their respective roads. Peco has had by far the least amount of drive in this sense and it has led to him being the worst player out of our cast up until now, even with huge margins of talent. Sakuma has had huge amounts of drive and has led to him having access to the world of high level players despite having no talent whatsoever. Kazama has the most amount of drive in this sense and it has brought him the Youth Olympic Gold medal and title of best player so far, the guy having an inhuman work ethic and setting aside everything for the sport.

Up until today, we have only seen Peco as an example of how insufficient drive can destroy the prospects of a player. Today that changed with Koizumi's backstory. Do yourself a flavor and PLEASE, go back to the match between him and Smile. There is a whole layer underneath that battle that we couldn't decipher yet, but we can now and it's really worth it. 

Anyway, Butterfly Joe had everything, the talent, the work ethic, the image... but his story made clear that he didn't have the drive. He never could climb over others to reach the top. He was too fragile, too gentle. For all his grace, his thin wings could never carry him to the top. The butterfly metaphor is just so beautiful and apt for him. The point is this: you have to be a killer to reach the top. 

Message received. But there's another side to the word *drive*. It also means the thing that is pushing you towards your goal, your reason for going where you want to. It's a subtle difference, but a very crucial one.

Take Sakuma. His reason for pushing himself was revenge and jealousy to Peco. But how much can you get out of that before it becomes stale? Sure, he never made it because he has no talent... but let's look at Kong. Kong's motivation at the start was to conquer Japan so that he could return to his home country and make a comeback: lose and it's over. Now, think about how much pressure this put on him. Sure, it gives a lot of 'drive' in the first sense, but in difficult matches, when push comes to shove, do you think his 'drive' in the second sense of the word will propel him forward, or stifle his play? We've already seen the answer.

So not only is the amount of 'drive' in the first sense important, the 'drive' in the second sense is also a huge part of the equation. There's good drives and bad drives. Skimming across the rest of our main cast, we see that Peco's drive is the healthiest of all. He wants to be the best, he wants to always win. If that is sincere and the talent is there to back it up, it won't waver. Now that he's found the quantity of drive to match the quality, he can become a force to be reckoned with. 

And then there's the last two of our cast. Kazama's quantity of drive was huge... but now we think about the quality of that drive. What does Kazama play for? Turns out today that his 'second' drive is horrible. He doesn't play for anything worthwhile to him: he plays because he has to, for honor and his family's status. We'll see more of that in the future.

The last one here is Smile. He used to have no quantity of drive whatsoever, but obviously something changed. But the root cause of that change is unknown: his quality of drive is a mystery. We're gearing up for the showdown, folks. Who would your *hero* be?

**OST OF THE DAY**: Today's choice is a fantastic 'training' song: enjoy [Night Cruising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9pn6tLLtcs). There is one imo better piece of OST in today's episode (and some previous ones) that I want to highlight, but I'll wait for the bast time for that.

**SCENE OF THE DAY**: Yeah, no surprises here: I loved Koizumi's backstory. Tragedy in the world of ping pong, but it never made him bitter towards the sport: just a desire to show Smile the view from the top. I love Butterfly Joe.

*Side Notes:*

- Today's episode also focussed on the story of Kaiou vice-captain Sanada. Tbh, I feel he's a redundant piece to the story, as is Yurie to some extent. I won't be giving him much attention: other people are simply more interesting.
- The comments of Kazama's coach are immensely interesting and the inspiration for this post. He sees the way Kazama is approaching the sport and it worries him. And not just for his ping pong: he worries about Kazama as a person. Whether that is justified... time will tell.

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/VciMr) for today.

Kong is continuing to connect with his team, the [weight of his loss to Kazama](http://i.imgur.com/jO0VQX9.png) is still there, however.

Koizumi and Smile is great, with Smile admitting that he has feelings and (indirectly) that he enjoys Koizumi's company and coaching. [Koizumi shows some vulnerability throughout the episode](http://i.imgur.com/kXyvVco.png) and admits that he might not be the best for Smile, and we also get Smile taking and interest in him and asking about his back story. [That's entering a complex topic](http://i.imgur.com/T7yCejz.png), and it gives us a connection between a past generation of ping pong stars. The people we meet, come in contact with, and connect with through sports are sometimes more important than the game. Those connections can last long after the players stop playing. And it makes sense that Koizumi yelled at Smile early on for letting Kong win, and being too kind, since the same thing happened to him. He asks him if he could do what he couldn't - drive a stake into a friend's injury. The Smile of the past clearly wouldn't, has that changed?

We get a bit of information on Smile's family situation as well, and we see Smile have a fun little back and forth with Oota; Oota's smiling, so it's evident that he does still like the game despite the focus on his job, and it's a friendly connection between the two that we haven't really seen yet. [Oota simply enjoys the game, is having a good time, and same as he does with Smile, he gets involved with his teammates.](http://i.imgur.com/jA9sX4N.png)

We get more personal between Kazama and several people, some in his past; his coach, his grandpa, and also in his history with his mother and father. Kazama's coach asks him an important question going forward: [does he play ping pong for the right reasons?](http://i.imgur.com/FNPOY1x.png) Maybe he should reflect and consider *why* he's playing ping pong. We do see Kazama look up/open his eyes, so he at least acknowledges this. Given the info at the end of the episode, we can notice that Kazama's coach's hero is not his father, but Kozumi. Does he like Koizumi's playstyle or attitude more?

We know that Kazama locks himself in the bathroom, and here we see part of the reason why: [given how his talent more or less kept him in the family](http://i.imgur.com/unjUB61.png), he needs to embody that Kaio/championship ideal, so he isolates himself from his weaknesses. [Any nerves that he has, any negative feelings, they all must be shut away and kept in private. So he traps himself in a box and doesn't let people in.](http://i.imgur.com/IevRtQR.png) This is also made pretty evident with how his cousin is trying to connect with him. This is one of the least, if not the least, intimate character relationships that we've seen.

Kazama's isolation isn't healthy, obviously. The same thing has and will continue to break people irl (I never liked that men don't cry spiel). I also want to say that the lilies from last ep being a connection his dad was a nice touch, it makes it easy to see that the funeral is for his dad before a word is even said. [However, this is a bit mysterious, isn't it?]( http://i.imgur.com/AK6XFAn.png) And we also have his cousin saying that she wants to arrange flowers, could that be her focusing a bit too much on Kazama and/or his dad, or is this something that she believes in? She does seem serious about her plans going forward, and without her grandpa's help, but she also has very deep connections to both of them: Kazama's dad is her hero, she likes Kazama, and Kazama's dad's death and her birthday both fall on Valentine's day. That's about as tied together as you can get.

Peco and the old lady have some great chemistry too, and it's nice to see Peco working hard for once. Apparently he's picking up on some of this stuff easily, with the change in his game being dynamic and fast; where was this Peco before?! And he has a bandage on his knee, could that be some [foreshadowing/a mirroring of Koizumi's past?](http://i.imgur.com/TUvyseJ.png) The old lady seems a bit worried about it.

The hero talk is starting to come to the forefront a bit, as I think it has at least been mentioned by every major character except Kong(?).

**This episode is all about intimacy and connection, mostly - but not only - between mentors and mentees (is that a word?), and it's wrapped up in a nice Valentine's Day bow.** 
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, oh no, oh goodness no. Please don't tell me that what's happening is that Peco is going to wind up having hurt his knee and he and Smile are going to be up against each other, making it become a repeat of what happened between Sensei and Grandpa Ryu!

Lots of build-up, foreshadowing, and of course character development in this episode. 

Can't decide which pairing I enjoy more, Obaba x Peco or Koizumi x Smile. So many likeable characters in this show. 
>> ARTICLE
	Ooh, Chinas still salty about that loss. Its good that hes settling in to his coaching role so well, but theres definitely unresolved anger there. I cant wait to see a grudge match. I hope we get one.

	Yes! Peco cut his hair! Old lady confirmed best girl!

	Ping Pong baseball looks awesome. Can we get a sequel about that game?

	Tsukimoto you buzzkill. Well, whatever pisses off that asshole with the cylindrical head makes me happy. I find it interesting how he was introduced seemingly to make Oota less of an asshole by comparison. Im really interested in where Ootas story goes.

	Oh shit, Dragons in the gym!!!

	Dragons plot thickens. Why is he playing ping pong? At the beginning of the show I thought he seemed like the one who was most motivated by pure love of the game, but thats looking less and less true as we go on. Its become obvious that what keeps him moving forwards isnt passion. Hes afraid of his uncle and afraid of failure. So how did he start the game in the first place? Judging by how old he was in the flashback to his fathers funeral, he must have already been playing by then.

	Smile still has feelings. Im really grateful for this scene. It made me realize that in the last few episodes, weve been moving away from Smile and focusing on everybody else, to the point where it seemed he was really turning into the robot. I dont want him to become a bad guy, so Im happy to resume his character development.

	Yeah Peco! Feel the burn! Put in that effort, kid! Im so happy to see him not being a lazy sack of shit!

	Run, Smile, run!

	Changing to plastic? What are balls made out of now?

	So, is Chinas ping pong robot supposed to be foreshadowing or something? Since, you know, the shows main character is also a ping pong robot? Or is it just supposed to show how China is still obsessed with how he was defeated by Dragon?

	Man, poor Kazama. Fuck this uncle. Im with Yurie, I dont like how business uncle is forcing him to carry so much weight on his shoulders.

	UH OH! DONT DO IT SANADA! LOVE TRIANGLES NEVER END WELL FOR THE SIDE CHARACTER!

	Oh shit, he knows its her birthday! Im emotionally conflicted now, fuck! I want Kazama to have a happy end involving sweet, sweet cousin-cest, but Sanada is all of a sudden a really cool guy, and he really cares about and pays attention to Yurie!

	Well that super aggressive mental shouting at Kazama just killed the vibe. Damn Kazama, its tough to be the ultimate ping pong stud when everybody around you has a jealous inferiority complex.

	ARE YOU FEELING IT NOW, MISTER TSUKIMOTO?

	This Butterfly Joe backstory smacks of foreshadowing. Poor Peco. I give him two or three episodes until he has a serious injury.

	PLOT TWIST! Asshole uncle knows Koizumi!

	So what happened to uncle-san after the qualifiers? I assume his knee didnt get any less injured before the next round, so when was he knocked out? Did it wreck his leg?

	Chump is old ladys son, huh? He seems like a cool dude. Pecos development here is interesting, I cant help but wonder just how good he really is. If he had been putting in the effort all along, would he be on Smiles level? Dragons? Just how do those two compare to each other exactly? There are so many matchups I want to see that Im afraid will never come to be.

	Wow, zero episodes before Peco has a knee injury! The blinding speed of ping pongs plot advancement has confounded my predictions once again.

	I have a nasty feeling that bad things are going to happen to Yurie. For some reason, whenever I see anybody driving a car it makes me paranoid that theyre about to crash. It doesnt matter how safe they are, how fast theyre going, or whether its the kind of show that would introduce that sort of drama. In a show like Ping Pong, with a person as energetic and volatile as Yurie doing donuts in the middle of the road? Thats a recipe for tragedy.

Work during the weekend really messed up my ability to get timely in-depth first timer analysis up, so I'm afraid there won't be any today. If anyone was enjoying my thoughts, they should be back in full swing tomorrow!

> Changing to plastic? What are balls made out of now?

Up until a couple years ago, ping pong balls used in competition were made of celluloid. Compared to the new plastic balls that are currently used, celluloid balls are a bit faster and have a bit more spin.

Minor correction: the grandpa is the douche who knows Koizumi, and the uncle is Yurie's father and Kazama's coach.

> So what happened to uncle-san after the qualifiers? I assume his knee didnt get any less injured before the next round, so when was he knocked out? Did it wreck his leg?

It says he shot up the ladder to world wide fame.

I'm pretyping this one, cause they take a surprisingly long time. For once, I'm ahead of the curve! Haha

#Comparisons of playsytles from this episode and the pro players of SSBM:

This episode doesn't really show much gameplay overall, nor does it really focus on player mentalities. What this episode does really well though is focus on player relationships - with other players, with their coaches, and even with themselves. So with that in mind, let's take a look at what this episode has to teach us.

This episode starts out with a shot of Kong and his teammates trying to 'keep their eye on the ball'. It's a good bonding moment for the team, as they all seem to be taking quite well to Kong and vice versa. In the middle of their practice a commercial featuring Dragon shows up advertising new shoes designed for mats. While one of the players is quick to mention how cool Dragon is, another is even quicker to shut him up given Kong's attitude towards Dragon. I'd bet in the past, Kong would have stormed right out of the room, maybe even have yelled a bit. However now that he is closer with his team, he's comfortable with the little remarks that normally would have tilted him. It shows amazing growth in his character given his whole situation.

Next up we have Peco struggling to climb a mountain of stairs (Ooh, metaphors, gotta love em!). He has a new resolve in wanting to be like Ash Ketchum and ~~catch all the pokemon~~ reach the top, but first he has to go through a grueling exercise regiment with Tamura; he has to run to her and prove that he really does want to become better, and if he can't even get through this small challenge he doesn't deserve to play the game. On the other hand, we've got Smile running like crazy, away from his own coach. After doing some soul searching he realizes that Koizumi really is doing things for Smile's best interests, and then decides that listening to him is probably the most beneficial thing to him right now. I like to think of these two in this episode as a visualization of work hard, play hard - Peco was playing around a lot earlier, now he's got to go to work. Smile was a robot, and now he needs to cool his jets. Balance is key to a healthy lifestyle.

----------------

In this episode we also learn about two key figures' background stories. First, let's start with Koizumi-sensei, aka Butterfly Joe. Turns out, Mr. Coach here used to be *preeeeetty good* at the game, even being considered as Japan's strongest player. However, when faced with a former friend he couldn't bring himself to win over him. Should he have decided to win it out against his friend, who just so happens to be the President of Poseidon and Kaio, his friend's knee would have shattered and his career would be over. This seems to be a large area of regret for Koizumi - he definitely didn't want to destroy his friend's career, but what if he won? That decision is the kind of thing that follows you for life, whether you want it to or not. After telling his story, he turns to Smile and asks if he'd be able to do the same, if it were a friend. Coincidentally, we find Peco to be sporting a knee wrap. ***Hmmm......***

The other character we learn the history of is Kazama, the Dragon of Ping Pong. This sad, sad man. His father, a failed businessman, shunned by his family, dying and leaving his wife and child to be recipients of his shame. Only because Kazama is good at ping pong is his side of the family able to shed that sense of failure and gain respect. Granted, a lot of it isn't even justified, as the Kaio coach says. However, it is what Dragon has to shoulder. To him, it seems the game isn't a game but a necessity. He can't take it lightly at all, or his family will be shamed once again. He isn't playing for himself, but the question is if he even wants to play at all. Dragon's strength as a player comes from his burden, which he can't put down; does that kind of motivation make a better player overall, or will it eventually break his back and cripple him? I guess we'll find out how the Dragon handles it.

--------------

#Comparisons to Melee:

Surprisingly, Melee does require a lot of self-maintenance. You wouldn't think that  having a healthy lifestyle and mindset would be that beneficial to a video game, but in reality those two things are just beneficial to every aspect in life. When you don't have that kind of relationship with yourself, you start to see effects that take a toll on your game. For example, two of the current 'gods' of Melee are in what I would call troubled waters. I don't want to get into it too much, but from what I understand PPMD suffers from depression and as a result we've only seen him compete probably at ten different events max over the past year; each time there is a big event that is announced, the discussion always shifts to "I wonder if PP is gonna come" > "Oh probably not" > "Ya, that sucks... I wish him well, though". We as a community miss the guy, but we all understand that if he isn't feeling up to it then he shouldn't stress himself out. The mind is what matters most, in the end.

That isn't to say the body doesn't matter, either. The other god of Melee that's kind of messed up right now is M2K. Over the last year and a half, his hands have gotten significantly worse to the point where he needs to go see a doctor. Many people keep telling him to go see one, but for some reason he still hasn't. At this point, it's [become a meme to the community](http://oddshot.tv/shot/mvg-league-20150915194251673), and we're all just gonna keep telling him that without really expecting to see any change. The day he actually goes to the doctor is the day the robot gets fixed and wins EVO, I'm calling it right now. ^(M2K pls as a huge fan of yours go see the fucking doctor)

In terms of friendship, their are definitely some rivalries out there that I can think of, like TempoStorm.Westballz and Leffen as of late. But they don't seem to actually, legitimately hate each other. Maybe, I don't know, I'm not them. But their games are super interesting and exciting to watch, because you can see and even feel how hard they want to destroy the other. For example, let's take a look at their last meeting at Beast 6 just a few weeks ago. They met twice in bracket, and **ho. ly. shit** was it a spectacle to behold. Here are the sets: [Westballz v Leffen, BEAST 6 Winner's Semis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5ylEIq5FQQ) and [Westballz v Leffen, BEAST 6 Loser's Finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPSN1PKCmzE). Just watch the playercams, too. Golden stuff, right there.

* Quick edit: a [synopsis of the drama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C24GW5w-JU) that was Westballz/Leffen at BEAST 6. lol
* Edit of edit: finally linked the vid FailFish

On the actual friendly side of things, nothing gets more real than the friendships between the NorCal homies CLG.PewPewU and CLG.Sfat and between Mango and Lucky. In both cases, the pair have been childhood friends and gre up with the game; Lucky and Mango even grew up down the street from each other. PPU and Sfat are known for having such great teams synergy that they are always top contenders to take the teams competitions wherever they go, even beating legendary teams like M2K/Armada. In singles, whenever any of the two pairs face each other in bracket, everyone watching dies a little inside. No one want to watch two friends beat each other up and send one packing. However, the sets they play show us the skill that they've learned from each other over the years, and damn are they some good sets:

* [PPU v Sfat, Genesis 3 Losers bracket - loser gets 9th (out of the money)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38G1fLiGA74). This one really hurts: two best friends, teams partners (they got 2nd overall in teams together, lost to M2K/Armada), sponsored by the same org. PPU is kind of known as a '9th place hero', meaning he almost always chokes. Sfat does that too, but not as much as PPU. This was really heartbreaking to watch cause I didn't want either to lose, but it's a good set.
* [Mango v Lucky TBH4 Losers Quarters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=325Nbl98Mtc). The Norwalk homies. Same neighborhood, same street. So much history. So. much. ***style***. Fucking amazing set

Something no one's mentioned so far is that Smile only goes back to Koizumi after he sees Peco lying exhausted outside the training facility. At that point, he starts walking back while humming his strange song.
>> ARTICLE
Smile's "Yes. Yes, my coach" reminded me so much of Seras Victoria's "Yes, sir, my Master!"

What's with all these old coaches putting the moves on their students though?  I know they're joking, but still. I thought it was just an idiosyncrasy of the old dude, but it looks like the old woman's the same way.

Peco's knee bandaid is very ominous.

Wait, is that robot actually returning the balls, not just serving them?  That doesn't seem likely.

The coaches see a lot of their old selves in these young guys, and I guess it's just their way of showing affection. I find it so damn adorable, especially with Obaba.

**'Because you haven't got a talent for table tennis, Demon. That's all there is to it.'**

Well, that was straight-up depressing. Quite a few of our main characters are in a very low place after this episode, but as you all know, I only focus on one subject every write-up. And today's episode leaves me simply no other option. Today's focus is on our last main character, Hanabu Sakuma, and more importantly, the aspect of sport he represents: **talent vs. hard work**.

It's a topic as old as man itself, maybe even older than that: all it takes is the recognition that someone else is better at something than you are and that things come more natural to some people than others. In the realm of competitive sports, it's a topic that one simply cannot avoid, so much so that I'd bet every sports anime, or even sports show ever made has touched on the topic in one way or the other. It always comes up and that's neither bad nor good, but just something that comes along with the territory.

There are, however, different ways of approaching the subject. A lot of times the subject is approached exceedingly optimistically and the narrative is spun such that anything can be overwon by sufficient hard work and suffering. That sort of sugarcoated message belongs in the same realm as things like 'the power of friendship', or 'the power of love': narratives that are spun to 'teach' us positive morals and to seek out the triumphant cases. It's there to tell us that we must work hard to achieve our goals and... well, that's basically it.

Those sort of narratives are, of course, immensely oversimplified at best and bold-faced lies at worst. Like most subjects that are often spun as either black or white, the answer is most often gray. Friendship and love don't conquer everything, but they do provide strength and comfort in the face of adversity. Hard work certainly has its place among the factors of success, but it's not all-powerful. And that is a depressing realization. 

Ping Pong presents the age-old question in the form of our last main character, but it takes a different approach to the subject. Often the subject is presented as 'one beats the other', but Ping Pong goes a layer deeper and tries to examine all the possible combinations in the conflict. 

But on to our main character. Demon is an awkward figure... okay, he's kind of an ass, but one has to admire his passion for the game. He puts his everything into the sport, though his motivation for the motivation (you still following me?) is questionable: he is mostly driven by jealousy at Peco's success as a kid. His objective is simple: become stronger. Yeah, you know, if he wasn't such an ugly and unlikable dude, he'd remind me of every cardboard cut-out shounen protagonist ever, so I guess it's a good thing he's a dick, huh?

Jokes aside, his arc is nothing like those shounen protagonists. He's similarly presented as a 'not especially talented kid', but not because he has this 'hidden awesome supertalent waiting to be uncovered'... he just simply has no talent. He's got the same unwavering work ethic, but it doesn't bring him 'unbeatable determination'... it barely makes him a passable player.

It's something he has been trying to deny every single day. That's why he worked so hard and why he was always so angry... he's in denial about himself (remind you of Kong, anyone?). But at a certain point he just can't do it anymore. He battles with Smile because he simply can't accept it, but the truth gets thrown into his face as Smile doesn't hold back (growth for Smile!!). 

When he finally can't take it any more, when he pours out all his frustration, Smile puts words to what I called 'a depressing realization'. He puts it bluntly and directly, without sugarcoating. He adds that 'it's nothing worth shouting about', which can be interpreted as cruel and Smile certainly doesn't sell it as anything else.

But how can you sell something like that? How can you essentially tell someone that what they are is not good enough and never will be? I've seen conversations like these play out and they are never pretty. It's something best handled with a modicum of dignity, but it's still one of the most painful pills to swallow regardless. 

Ping Pong knows that 'talent vs. hard work' encompasses more than just 'one versus the other'. Talent can be present in those who piss it away (Peco), those who never wanted it in the first place (Smile) and those who have it and use it, but never enjoy it (Kazama). And it can be absent in those who wish it more than anything or anyone else in the whole world. Life is random and cruel irony is present in the random matrix. That's all there is to it. It's nothing to shout about.

**OST OF THE DAY:** Not a really impressive episode for the soundtrack, but if you ever have the depressing realization that your wish will never come true, then [Wish Upon A Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux8S1znpz8Y) is your jam.

**SCENE OF THE DAY:** ... You didn't think I'd forget to mention it now, did you? Yesterday I called Kong's conversation with his coach a heartbreaking scene, but [his flashback today](https://cdn.streamable.com/video/mp4/i0yz.mp4) was maybe even worse. It's also just as impressive and a scene I want to discuss, because it perfectly embodies 'show, don't tell'. The entire scene is devoid of dialogue and lasts maybe 45 seconds, but it manages to elicit emotion regardless. 

That's because it lets the images and OST do all the talking. I've already gushed over the OST piece yesterday, so I'll focus on the former. The scene starts with Kong receiving a package of candy, obviously from his mom, which tells us that she still supports him no matter what. He then finds the hair that is half-grey, half-black from hair paint. This is so beautifully done: the gray tells us that his mom is getting older and that he is forced to spend the years where his mother slowly grows old away from home, a realization all kids fear (I know it hurt me to watch it). But the paint makes it even worse: it shows that his mother knows that the realization would devastate Kong, so she paints her hair to keep up appearance and not worry her son. Of course Kong sees through it and realizes all this... which results in him breaking down crying alone in the train ;_;

That's how you build a scene people. Because goddamn is it powerful.

*Side Notes:*

- One thing I didn't mention about Kong's scene is how he puts on his glasses in an obviously difficult moment. We saw it yesterday as well: it's actually a recurring symbol in the show. Both Demon and Kong use their glasses to protect themselves against reality. For Demon, it's the realization that he's not cut out for table tennis. For Kong, it's the realization of the very likely possibility that he might not be able to return home. Of course we know another character with glasses, which leads one to wonder: what is Smile protecting himself against?
- No screencaps today, Imgur is still being a bitch and I need to catch a plane tomorrow, so my apologies: hopefully tomorrow will be better.

i've seen ping pong twice now and i missed the hair until now. thanks for this excellent analysis. there's so much story jam-packed into this 1-cour anime, and this is just one great example.
>> ARTICLE
Wonderful analysis. I watched this show last summer and it's gotta be one of my only 10/10's. I'm not rewatching the episodes but I am popping in to read your posts. I intend to watch the Tatami Galaxy soon, partially because I hear you've also made write-ups for that show too.

To actually contribute to the topic, I think that subject of hard work vs talent comes up in many more areas than sports, as you imply. I'm reaching that point in my career where hard work helps but the true superstars had that right combination of talent and luck *along* with the good work ethic to succeed. And there are just too many people working towards the same goal to make room for all the hard workers. The people who get the jobs or positions are the best of the best, and infinite effort might not be enough to break into that league.

I never really thought about how the show compares/contrasts how the different characters handle their talent or lack thereof. Great connection to make.
>> ARTICLE
God damn.....that Kong flashback. So much emotion from a 10 second scene that needed no dialogue. 

And now we get to hear one of the most hard-hitting truths in the show, from the now cold-blooded Smile: Sakuma (who we find out has astigmatism) lacks the natural talent to play the sport at a high level. 

Guys. Already more depth and development than most other shows in their entire season(s), and we're at the fucking **fifth** episode.

#The Tortoise and the Hare

**Introduction**

This episode show us one of the most dark faces of life. That when you compete with someone else, it's not like in the fable of The Tortoise and the Hare, where the hardworking turtle can stand over the lazy rabbit, but instead, the world is filled with different kinds of turtles and rabbits.

**About turtles and rabbits**

Is like this how Sakuma, the hardworking turtle, could defeat Peco, the lazy rabbit, in the tournament, but now he faced the ugly face of truth, as hard as a turtle run, if the rabbit try he will win no matter what. Smile have the talent and the training to defeat him with ease, just like Wenge and Kazama, they work hard even with the talent they have.


**Duel of Rabbits**

We saw what happens when a turtle try to stand around the rabbits and is burned out, just like Icarus flying to near of the sun. Now, what happens when a rabbit is against another one?

Wenge played against Kazama and Smile, both players were better that him, yet, he stayed in Japan instead of going back to China, in the pursuit of the faster ones. Peco, in the other hand, is quitting altogether, after being defeated not only by Wenge but by Akuma, this last couldn't even damage Smile's defense. He, who have never even tried to train seriously yet is the most natural of all the main cast, find it weird that everybody else is surpassed him in his own game and is suffering of the lost of his own identity and accepts this outcome instead of overcoming this mindset.


**To finish**

We have seen the face of victory and defeat and we started exploring the characters reactions. Now, we just need to spectate the rebirth of the guys into their newselves, with the resolutions they get from this experiences. Sakuma's experience hits close to reality, next episode will be crucial for the character and us watchers.

Good write up. Tbh I didn't think my write ups were that long, haha. I guess I just like the topic so they don't seem as long.

Also idk I can post my analysis. Definitely not for another six our seven hours tho. So I really appreciate yours!
>> ARTICLE
	OHHH YEAHH! Looks like a Demon episode today! Im down for that, hes by far the least-developed of the big five characters up to this point.

	That was a really nice conversation between Kong and his coach. Ill miss that guy, but its really cool to see China accepting that he can still play in Japan and having a little good humor about it. Also, Dragon won Worlds already?? This timeline is moving so much faster than I expected.

	This girl is hella cute.

	Is hair dude just going to intermittently show up and travel the world as a sideplot? You JUST got to the beach in your last on-screen appearance dude, what are you even going to do in the mountains?

	Awww, poor China :(  Youve really got to feel for the guy.

	China and Smile both putting in the work. Peco *still* isnt coming to practice. Something is eventually going to break through that kids stupid head, right? God I want to smack him in his dumb bowl-head face.

	WAIT WHAT THATS PECO? Peco your hair is STUPID! Go join Kaio!

	Discontent in both camps, apparently. Captain bird-hair (Oota? Is that his name?) is a dick, but he has some legitimate grievances. Dragons personal success has apparently only made him tougher. The Kaiou guys are used to discipline and grueling training, but theyre also used to being the best. If theyre not putting up the results Dragon wants, then things are going to get rough.

	Demon is a rabid fucking dog. This guys inferiority complex knows no bounds. Hes been seething for years with jealousy against Peco, and now that hes won that match I guess he needs a new target to motivate him. Thing is, he thinks hes Dragon Junior but hes delusional. Smile could grind Demon into the dirt, but will he?

	Smile hits one return. Demon thinks: Ive made a terrible mistake.

	And Peco walks out. This is the second time now that Smile has proven himself far superior to an opponent who humiliated Peco. Not only that, this opponent is one who Peco once had to protect Smile from when they were kids. Come on, Peco! Have your epiphany!

	Smile: Youre mad cause youre bad.

	Ow. Demon is a sack of shit, but that was rough. I dont have any sympathy for him like I do for Kong, but Demon has definitely earned my pity.

	[PECO, YOU ***FUCKER!***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H050JksyFao) Pick up that *FUCKING RACKET!* 

I am so upset right now. Nobodys character arc is in a happy place. Dragon is the youth world champion of table tennis, but hes so overwhelmed by stress and anxiety that he looks like an 80 year old man who winces from pain every time he moves. Chinas dreams have been crushed into the dirt, and even if he no longer has the arrogance to see himself as above everybody around him, he still cant be happy in Japan with this homesickness. Smile is at the top of his game, but I dont like Robo-Tsukimoto. Its just a vague feeling, but theres no way that this unempathetic ruthless streak ends in happiness for anybody. Demon has been kicked off the Kaiou team and suspended from the academy, wasting the thousands of hours of effort he has put in to this game over the past decade or more of his life. Peco is the worlds most infuriating piece of self-pitying shit. Well, judging by the preview it seems that hell be a focus of the next episode. My hope and prediction is that he runs in China. I bet they would have a lot to talk about right now.

I dont have a ton of time today for analysis, so Ill close it off with one small thought. I bet Dragon had to beat a few of Kongs former teammates on his path to the Olympic gold medal. I wonder what they all thought of him, and if they know that hes the one who beat Kong. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode hit a lot harder than I was prepared for. I don't think there's much I can say that hasn't already been covered in the big write-ups. It's weird, at just the end of last episode, I was liking Kazama a lot, the imagery of him as a dragon playing against Wenge was powerful and I admired the dedication he had to this sport. But now that I see how little faith he has in the rest of the team, even though they aren't international-play material, it's not good. Looking down on them like that is keeping them down, in one way it might motivate them to play harder for his approval, but I can't help but think that if he drills into them that they can't win because of who they are and not things about their play that can be fixed then they'll never grow beyond the limits he thinks they have. 

But right at the end, wasn't that Kazama in Sakuma's flashback telling him that he looked forward to watching him play? If so, is that supposed to mean that Sakuma did have Kazama's attention already, even if he would never possess the natural talent to be a great player?

That lesson that Sakuma needed to learn, and how he started acting after, that was very strong. That was honestly painful. I can't wait to see where things go from here. I hope Sakuma is going to be okay. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch the episode eventually, I swear. 

Until then, anyone have a favourite character so far? Who and why? If you haven't seen the show before, do you have any character/plot/thematic predictions? 

This episode felt like it was over in five minutes. We have an emotional goodbye from Wenge's coach, though it's not overdone or melodramatic. I always sucked at goodbyes. Later on in the episode we have a continuation of the shot from last ep, of Wenge leaving his mother. He breaks down in the extended clip. She's getting grey hair but trying to hide it; you can tell her stress and how Kong being away from her for so long affects her, and just from a few simple seconds.

We have Sakuma going to challenge Smile, and as he's walking towards the school, it shows him as a samurai (?). Makes the seppuku comment from Koizumi feel like an inevitability. I wonder if Sakuma earned those few points he got, or if Smile just didn't want to pull a Wenge. He saw what that did to Peco. And in the flashbacks, Kazama says that he has high hopes for Sakuma in his match. Is he humouring him or did he actually mean it? We saw how quick Kazama threw him under the bus and wanted to fill his spot, and what he thinks of his teammates in general.

"Why did it have to be you?" to Smile cuts deep... Sakuma became too focused on ping pong, on winning, and on his competitors. That's where the eye and glasses motif comes in, as Smile, the other guys with glasses, doesn't struggle nearly as much as he does despite Smile not putting in the same amount of effort. His coach praises him for his tenacity and hard work, but he calls it adorable: this along with "a beep beep not a choo choo" hints that maybe Sakuma doesn't *just* have astigmatism. Plus his memory of the matches and general awkwardness could also reinforce this idea, though that could simply be used to show his obsessive nature. 

Since last episode, it seems like the moon on Smile's shirt has become closer to being full. If that's true (I haven't checked), then it could mean two things: simply showing the passage of time, or showing that Smile is closer to "completion". I like the second one because at the end we have Peco throwing his racket into the water under the full moon, and he drifts away from it. Powerful image. And it contrasts how at the start of the episode Peco was in the waves, where maybe he was undecided and was battling with the decision to quit. With the water at rest, could Peco be at rest with his decision as well? 

I'd also like to point out how much of a mess Peco has become. He's getting fatter (still chowing down on the junk, so it shows he not changing for the positive). His hair is scraggly. Doesn't even look at his girlfriend(?), but the fact that he has one shows that his focus could be drifting. He started smoking. His phone is cracked and doesn't bother to get it fixed. *He's* cracked, and he's upset at Smile. Smile's upset at him, too. Their friendship, and Peco in general, are not in a good place. The worst part is that Peco doesn't even seem to care.

Oh yeah, and since I was late there'll be no screenshots. Maybe tomorrow, but I'll be pretty busy tomorrow as well.

This is my second time watching, my personal favorite character is still the old lady, [Obaba](http://myanimelist.net/character/20364/Obaba_Tamura) according to MAL

My favorite main character is Peco. I think his arc starts at the end of next episode which I'm excited for

Obviously my favorite duo is the mentor/student combo of them two

I can't really explain why I like them, they're just cool [peco more so towards the end though]

Favorite character: Smile, I love how and why he is the way he is.

Best character: Wenge, no contest.

I really like Kazama so far. Kong is a close second, but Kazama's struggles with anxiety despite being huge and tough and the best in the world are something that I've never seen before in anime. I can't really identify with him (I'm much closer to Peco, which is probably why I hate him so much) but his troubles really speak to me. 

As for plot predictions, I'm not even going to try. I spent like five minutes while doing my writeup yesterday wondering how Smile and Kong were still going to get a chance to attend Nationals for the show's climax, only to start this episode and discover that not only were Nationals over, they didn't even mention it because Dragon had just won the fucking Olympics.
>> ARTICLE
As I asked that I was thinking about it, and I don't know if I have a favourite so far... It could just be because I just finished the episode, but Sakuma has been "great" in his limited time. 

Kazama is fantastic. I can identify with his nerves; I often got sick before games and I still occasionally get sick before tests and midterms. Plus his theme is great.

I've watched that show and that even caught me off guard. I couldn't remember that (or much of this ep actually, maybe that's why I got emotional).
>> ARTICLE
Up early since I have to work, but let me comment really quick.

This episode really shows one underrated aspect of the svow: the voice acting. Underrated. Because it's utterly fantastic but no one is actually listening. Check out the original discussion thread, nobody recognised peco despite his unique way of speaking. I only needed two sentences to realise it. 

That's why I prefer dubs. With dubs you can freely and easily follow the visuals and most people can't manage to read and listen anyway. 

This episode also features one of the worse departures from the manga. Peco went to the arcades, still money matching people and calling himself peco-San. It shows that he has a constant competitive drive, but remains the big fish in the small pond due to his insecurity .
>> ARTICLE
So, one thing I don't get, why is Smile suddenly taking ping pong seriously?  Training starting at 5am, running 10km/day, constant matches?  Why?  What changed?
>> ARTICLE
There was a bit of a time-skip. Keep watching.

Pepsi. Not Bebsi? Or Popsi? They actually used the brand? What is this, 1996?

Yeah that's exactly when the manga was made lol.

Let's just pretend that was intentional.

**'Smile is calling me'**

I love this episode. It's just amazing how much they invested into getting to this point without the viewer knowing and then cashing in on it today. Today's subject is the sequel to my write-up of episode 2: today I'm revisiting the **Smile-Peco dynamic**, but I also want to pay a lot of attention into how the show builds up its moments.

But first Peco and Smile. In the previous write-up about the two, I already pointed out the moon vs. star symbols of the two and how their dynamic which should be complementing has become destructive, dragging each other down instead of the opposite. I talked about how Peco didn't improve his play and Smile let Peco win so both could be 'happy', how you could tell that Smile knew deep down that what he was doing couldn't last and how Peco should have noticed as well.

There have also been many flashbacks to their shared past, puzzle pieces laid down on the board but not precisely in place, so we couldn't get the whole picture yet. That said, there were a lot of things inferred, but never said out loud, so parts of the picture were uncovered: it's just that the show moves at such a blistering pace that we never had the time to dwell on assembling a full picture, or even just storing the complete pieces in our memory bank. Ping Pong demands our full attention, so time spent puzzling is time missing crucial developments, both character and plot-wise.

So for the write-up, let's do just that: let's uncover the parts of the picture in a row.

- After beating Koizumi, Smile said to Peco that 'he would be going ahead', with Peco exhibiting shock at Smile's play. Now take into account that Smile always let Peco win and that shock closely resembles other emotions.
- Some flashbacks involve Smile being inside a locker, only for that locker to be opened. Others involve Smile asking Peco whether he could be like him one day. Obvious admiration there.
- Smile is always humming a strange song, including when he was beating Kong at the previous Inter High. 
- Smile's home is empty as all hell. No loving parents and we've already seen he doesn't mix well with people. He only plays games his dad gave him. Isolation overload.
- Peco bitterly reminiscing of his childhood ping pong career where he had so much success. In the subsequent flashbacks he seems to reassure Smile of something as well as exclaim that he wants to go away after Smile said that 'table tennis is getting more complicated' and Obaba had some harsh words regarding half-baked excuses.
- Smile doesn't need to watch Peco's game: he knows he will win. Complete trust there.
- A small boy exclaims himself the hero: everything indicates it's Peco.

All of these pieces and more are just one angle the show introduced to us over the episodes. The parallel to Koizumi's past is one, Obaba's knees is another. Point being that the show has been carefully putting all these things in place like planting seeds to grow. When I first saw this episode, I already recognized the build-up and I also recognized that it was time for harvest. At the end of the episode all the questions come together: why is Peco playing, why can't he forfeit and rest his knee, ***why***, as Michio screams? This is the scene Ping Pong has been building towards, it has to make it count!!

And Ping Pong knocks it so far out of the park, you can probably see it from orbit. Peco's monologue connects the pieces and pulls away the curtain to reveal the staggering beauty at the base of his relationship with Smile, the true symbiosis between the two. Smile got bullied because he never showed emotion, but Peco *saved* him, saved him from a loveless isolated life with ping pong. Playing in full focus with Peco, loving the game, it's where he is most happy. Somewhere along the line Peco lost his drive and Smile became unhappy as well; Peco lost his drive because he was scared, scared that his talent wouldn't be enough to stand at the top, where he always wanted to be.

But for Smile, Peco is his hero. And it's his job to always believe in the hero, even at his lowest point. He waited a long time until he couldn't anymore, so he became the impervious monster the hero had to vanquish: reality is that he wants Peco to save him again. Peco needed to get over his fear, but eventually the hero always goes to slay the dragon, even if he dies trying.

So the only question remaining for us is: do *you* believe in heroes? I'm with Obaba: I love ya Peco. 

Hero Kenzan!! *Hero Kenzan!!* **HERO KENZAN!!**

**OST OF THE DAY**: I mean, there's just no contest. Today it has to be one of the best pieces of the entire OST, that delivered when the show needed it to most: [Childhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmv4yMQqwa4) is beautiful in every sense of the word.

**SCENE OF THE DAY**: Do I need to repeat myself? Of course it's [Peco's monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK-4217yNQo)... it made me cry the first time I saw it. But I've still left out one of the main reasons why this is such an amazing scene. To me, this is the point where the show had already completed a succesful narrative. Because with this monologue, the show has managed to get into a position where every possible outcome is a successful narrative!! Peco blows his knee and loses to Kazama? Tragic tale and Smile will be up for revenge. Peco wins? Smile will be faced with Koizumi's choice, which can lead to apprentice resolving the master's mistake or Peco overcoming that. The show has managed to exclusively have successful options for a narrative left and that with two episodes to spare. Absolutely amazing.

*Side Notes:*

- I love Kong's dialogues with his coach, they're so natural. And again Kong displays his growth as a person by moving on to 'his ducklings'. God, this guy is an amazing character. I love you, China.
- Kazama's dialogues with Sakuma and Sanada are worrisome and depressing... well, his whole attitude is. I'll get to him later, you can guess when.

Great write up. Can't wait for tomorrow's 
>> ARTICLE
I can't post too long here cause I'm busy as hell, but I really love this episode. Sakuma shows up and asks the most important question any and every athlete must eventually ask themselves. That scene is quite amazing.


Hopefully I can find some time to write up my final post that I need to do to wrap up the Smash comparisons. However, it really doesn't look like it's gonna happen :/

[Screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/VtmRr) Only a few, but I just had to get the Peco and flashback stuff in. 

[You know, I'm surprised how many little details about this show that I forgot that really add to the show as a whole](http://i.imgur.com/u9rXuLG.png)

Kong taught Peco how to fly, he's trying to do the same for his team.

"You'll get pollen on yourself ..." - we've heard this one before, from Kazama. Repeating the line from his father. It looks like Kazama's dad had a drinking and/or drug problem. Was that the bad business his father was doing, or did the poor business drive him to that point?

All of the initial shots of Kazama in the bathroom are canted angles, and I'm no cinematography expert, but I'm pretty sure those are often used to show (reinforce in this case) a character that's uneasy, tense. 

Sakuma *and*  Sanada dropping the bomb: asking Kazama why he plays ping pong. So that's four people that have questioned him. Sakuma's become pretty adept at reading people as well - Sanada, Kazama, he knows when to back off from Kazama, and he even has a girlfriend!

Knowing all of this stuff about Kazama makes it a bit tough to swallow. I'm sure he wants Smile on the team so he's not he only one to carry his and Kaio's burden. Sanada thinks he's naive compared to Kazama, but that'snot the case.

[The robot takes on all challengers. Alone.](http://i.imgur.com/FaZj8kE.png) Peco changed that, maybe he can again.

[This show.](http://i.imgur.com/f2J1bI3.png)

And of course we get the "why do you play table tennis" or some other variant for Peco. He's much more confident about his answer than Kazama is, however. He's the hero!
>> ARTICLE
;.; I think Im gonna cry a bit

I never thought I would get this invested in either ping pong or these characters, I seriously think Im at the breaking point. I knew that Tsukimoto smiling was going to be an important plot point, but for some reason that backstory really caught me by surprise. I feel really bad for not believing more in Peco, hearing about how much he cares about Tsukimoto and his memories of playing, the feels are too strong.  We had some major foreshadowing in an earlier episode where someone said something like only the hero can defeat the robot, but did Peco really already get good enough that he can beat Kazama even with a hurting knee? Im really tempted to watch ahead. 
>> ARTICLE
Pace your hype so you can experience it with everyone else here. This is by far one of my favorite episodes in this series but it's still getting better. 
>> ARTICLE
it really does. next ep is among my favorites eps in anime
>> ARTICLE
You know the episode is going to be amazing when the first few minutes features Egami (who has now traveled EVERYWHERE), ready to return to the beginning of his aimless journey.

The only one who's still actually having problems is Kazama, and we sort of see why through a brief flashback. He had a hero once, and then something happened that made him stop believing. He's in need of saving now. 

It's gotta be like my fifth time watching this scene, but Peco explaining the nature of his friendship with Smile still made me tear up. I really appreciate how well-done the flashbacks are. They're simple, subtle and get to the point without dragging the scenes out. 

And on another note, I tried listening to the English dub for this episode and I just couldn't get into it. The Japanese VAs are just so much better in the delivery of their lines, and using actual (good) children voice actors for the flashback scenes was a fantastic move on their part. The English dub just used women and had them try to sound like children, which didn't turn out very well.

Wow this episode was so good!

* This episode delves so deep into every character
* Even the antagonists get their own side of the story
* I really do want to see Wenge get the ending he deserves
* Can't wait to see Peco and Smile finally meet again
* I really want to know more about the ginger girl also, I feel like her story is being randomly shoved in and needs time to flourish
>> ARTICLE
My god that "Ma-kun!" woman was annoying.  I guess she was intended to be.  I still don't know who Ma-kun is though - it feels like we're supposed to know?  Was he introduced before and I forgot?  Was he the ex first string Kaio player that was bumped off?

I have to say, I think Peco is a moron to risk permanent injury and never being able to play again.  He says he's doing it for Smile, but can't he be there for him anyway when they move up to the championship together?  What's the point of wrecking his knee now *and* laying that guilt on Smile?  Does he really think that will make Smile smile?
>> ARTICLE
> I still don't know who Ma-kun is

That's Sakuma. 

>What's the point of wrecking his knee now and laying that guilt on Smile?

I feel like you're missing the entire point of this episode and all the build-up from the past 9 episodes if you're actually asking this question and not being rhetorical lol. 
>> ARTICLE
Sakuma?  Was that their old buddy who beat Peco in the first tournament then challenged Smile "against the rules"?  He looks rather different then.

And no, I'm not being rhetorical.  Smile, for whatever reason that has still not been explained as far as I know, has decided to take ping pong seriously.  He turned himself into a robot, hoping a hero will stop his rampage or something.  Is seeing his friend cripple himself supposed to pull him out of robot mode?  Wouldn't the guilt that his friend crippled himself "for him" drive him even deeper instead?

Or is Smile *intentionally* being the robot just to bring Peco back to ping pong as the Hero, in which case Peco is even dumber since he'll have to quit ping pong after wrecking his knee anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely fantastic. From the tragic episode 2 to happy end of episode 11. Amazing. What's so great about Ping Pong is the fact that nobody loses. In Ping Pong everybody wins at the end. Akuma was never meant for Ping Pong. It may hurt but he faces the truth, meets his girl and has kids. Dragon meets a worthy enemy who shows him that ping pong can be fun. Dragon for the first time enjoys playing it, instead of thinking about winning and being a ping pong death machine. Peco almost gives up but Akuma reminds him that ping pong is amazing thus reminding him of his dream becoming a world champion. Wenge accepts that he is not the strongest and throws away his arogance, becoming coach for his team and embracing his life in Japan, which in the end leads to him being on Japanese olympic team. Peco saves Smile giving him joy in life and showing him that everything is not as it seems. Blood tastes like iron. Red,fiery blood tastes like cold,gray iron. He doesn't have to be robot. He can live. He can be happy. The characters save each other throughout the series. It's a great ending and a message. Taiyo Matsumoto and Yuasa Masaaki gave us a masterpiece that entertains and inspires us. Reminding us that life is beautiful, that we are not alone and that there is always a bright side of things. We sometimes don't notice it, but it's okay because others can point it out to us. Because we are all alive. That's why we are happy. 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been posting much in the watch threads because I didn't think I was capable of doing write ups without hinting at spoilers, but I have been following along and all I can say is how glad I am with how well this went. 

I know only a handful of new people were drawn in but I'm under the impression that they all loved the show. I know most people are turned away by the artwork but it's truly their loss. Not everyone can enjoy something that is truly a masterpiece. 

With that being said, this is by far one of my favorite shows of all time and the only 'sports' anime that I have ever watched. This is because Ping-Pong focuses on so much other than sports to the point where 'sports' could be considered a secondary theme of the show. 

It's well shown throughout that this is now a show about how people play sports, or what makes them good. This show is about *why* people play sports and what it means to or for them. It used Ping-Pong as an example due to how well it fits in with east Asian professional scenes but the same message could be applied to any sport in existence. Even E-sports as we've had someone compare the show to the way professional SSB is played. 

But beneath the how and the way there is another layer to this show. A second theme which is "How much will you sacrifice for the ones you love?". The entire show we see Smile, from the very start he expresses his dislike of people who take sports too seriously. How he doesn't want Ping-Pong to become complicated, he doesn't want to play to be good, it's just a way to pass time. Fame, money, tourney wins, none of that interests him, and yet he reaches out for them. He says "I don't want to have to sacrifice things", but he does, he sacrifices time and effort and even a bit of his mental wellbeing all for Peco. 

For basically his entire life Smile has admired Peco. He want's to see Peco succeed because Peco is the best player he knows and also his best friend. Peco is the hero, and he has always come to save Smile when he was in a time of need. This show is about the time Peco was in need, and what Smile had to do against his own wishes to be the hero. To save the man who always saved him. 

Along this path of two friends helping each other out we get to see the world around them change through the gravity of their actions. We see Kong learn to be humble and through dedication he climbs the steps back to where he belongs and through him we see that defeat isn't always the end.

 We see Akuma strive for greatness, dumping thousands of hours into work at something he's no good at only to hit his peak far below everyone else. Through him we see that there is more than one path in life, if what you're doing isn't working out for you, there's nothing wrong with quitting and becoming something else. 

We see  Kazama try to shoulder the burden of an entire company and his family's name only to have it all fall down around him. Through him we see that there is no point in life if you don't enjoy it.


We see Egami, defeated he travels the world looking for what will take him, only to return to ping pong and wonder why he ever left. Through him we see that life is meaningless without the things you love. 

All of these different things are shown in such a way that it culminates to a glorious ending which leaves the viewers and characters satisfied and tells a story with such deepness that it can hardly be compared.
>> ARTICLE
There's a lot to comment on here, but I really feel like Sakuma is more to show that you can enjoy the sport without being competitive at it.  After he quit, he still taught himself to chop for fun, went to tournaments, and visits a local ping pong place often enough that Kazama and Smile keep in touch with him.

I think that sometimes when you're focusing on the too-end competitors, it can be easy to forget how fun it can still be to be involved in a sport.  Sometimes, you have to take a step back and just enjoy the activity, like Peco showed pretty much everyone throughout his whole life.  That's what made him a hero.

edit: 
>This show is about the time Peco was in need, and what Smile had to do against his own wishes to be the hero. To save the man who always saved him.

This is kind of just semantics, but Smile became a monster that could only be stopped by a hero.  Definitely, not a hero himself.  He needed to give Peco a reason to be the hero that Smile knew he could be.

Honestly, Smile had a pretty sad life at the beginning of the show.  He hadn't smiled so long playing ping pong that even Peco forgot that it wasn't an ironic name.  :(

Last night I also found a bunch of Ping Pong wallpapers to add to my collection, which I want to share [here.](http://m.imgur.com/a/izYmF) If anybody has more, please send them my way!

Thanks for the wallpapers.

You know whats really cool, clicking through those wallpapers and upon seeing the sixth one realizing it was me who made that one like 2 years ago.

It's almost impossible to not put either Pevo vs Smile or Pevo vs Kazama as the best matches.  Those two just have so much going on for them that it's hard to put any of the others above them. **edit:** Wenge vs Kazama has amazing visuals, though.

Having said that, I think one of my favorite moments of the whole show is when Koizumi is playing Smile and the robot comes out.  Peco just gets amazed and he just starts rampaging.  You really have no idea how good he is up to that point, because we had only seen him playing against either Peco (sandbagging) or people he outclassed in practice.

What an amazing show. Any news on Yuasa's plans lately? I need more masterpieces.
>> ARTICLE
Yuasa's apparently working on a movie with his studio Science SARU 
(they put out a hiring notice for animators on Twitter a few weeks ago), so expect more flash animation. The original movie news was announced about a year ago in an [award acceptance statement](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-03-22/ping-pong-director-masaaki-yuasa-makes-new-anime-film/.86255). The guy that runs the Catsuka animation news site apparently visited Yuasa's studio, [got a sneak peak at some work](https://twitter.com/catsuka/status/650366727025352704), and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/catsuka/status/671065221419675649) that while the movie's an adaptation, Yuasa has multiple potential projects. So I guess we know that the movie is a thing and it is actively in production.

Keep an ear to the ground for the upcoming noitaminA conference on the 17th. His last two tv series ran on the block and they've been making a larger effort to release more films like Project Ito, so there's a non-zero percent chance that they're involved with whatever Yuasa is doing. ~~watch me be wrong and there's no Yuasa news~~

Wow, thanks for the response. I think you're on to something, I'll keep my eyes peeled for any news!

#Comparisons of playstyles from Ping Pong: The Animation to the pro players of SSBM:

So sorry I haven't posted a long analysis in a while; school has really fucked me up, but now I'm done with work and it's my break! There can't be a better way to start it off than by pouring my love of both Ping Pong and Melee into one last post. So let's get started, shall we?

#Peco: The Hero

As we all now know, Peco is the hero Smile was waiting for. Incidentally, he was also the hero that Kazama needed, same for Kong and Sakuma. What Peco brings to the game is not only his sheer talent for the game, but more importantly is the fact he brings out the fun in it. The main characters, and really all characters played the game for their own reasons - whehter it be to kill time, to make friends, or become a god. But at the very core of their playing, each and every competitor shares one thing in common: they all started to play because they simply had fun. Over the course of playing, they may have lost that feeling of fun they had when they first started; Peco didn't win, Kong was exiled, Kazama was forced, Sakuma wasn't good, Smile didn't have friends to play with (he and Peco played, but it wasn't the same). What Peco symbolizes is that having fun is the true hero of the games we play. You can play for whatever reason you want, but in the end you should be having fun.

#C9.Mango

* Norwalk, CA, USA
* Fox/Falco dual main
* Sponsor: Cloud 9
* MIOM 2015 rank 4

The GOAT. The Kid. NEO. Captain America. The Buster. These monikers describe perfectly the man we know as Mango. Mango, like Peco, probably has the highest skill cap out of all players in the game. When he is playing his best, it looks like he solved the game - which in Melee is really something, since after 15 years we're still discovering new tech to be implemented into the competitive scene. Also like Peco, Mango tends to ride momentum, and in both ways. There is what we call Winter and Summer Mango - Summer Mango is Smash incarnate, he can't be beat. When winter rolls around, he becomes the biggest Buster you've ever seen. It's a cycle, I guess.

But what is the most impressive thing about Mango's play is by far his clutch. He's got so much clutch, he beat Ryan Lockwood's clutch and finished Streets in 1:11 (if you don't know what I'm talking about, watch [Streets 1:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYmqJl4MoNI) and read the description; so goddamn hilarious). Mango is kind of known for going on what are called Losers Runs - he gets sent into the Loser's Bracket really early, and somehow he comes all the way back to win the entire tournament; it's really something to behold.

My first introduction to Mango (and the competitive scene as a whole) was the amazingness that was EVO 2013. Knocked into Loser's early on by Wobbles, a strong ICs player, Mango had to face off against Ice, then PPMD, then Armada, then Hungrybox, and finally Wobbles once again. And he fucking did it. Holy shit, for those who don't know, all those people rank in probably the top 20 of players worldwide, and PPMD/Armada/Hbox being other gods of the game and at the time were ranked 3/2/5 respectively. Guess who was 1 that year.

Since he first started as a Jigglypuff main, Mango has seen the top of the Melee world as well as the lows. After entering as such an unbeatable player, he started to slack off and not take anything seriously; there was also a period of inactivity when he had a kid. However, in recent years Mango has matured and taken the game more seriously. He also now has multiple people who can take sets off of him at any given time, including people outside of the top 6 players. At the end of the day, we know Mango as an incredible player. But also, we know the Losers Mango is even scarier; that's why the community always says to "Never sleep on the Kid".

# ~~Ping Pong~~ Smash is a freaking blast!

So if you couldn't tell, I really love Smash. The creativity you can show in your playstyle, the filth that you emanate from your movement and combos, and the camaraderie that forms between yourself and the opponent that sits right next to you - everything about playing the game, I love it. To that end, I'd love to share some of my favorite sets and most iconic moments from the history of this great game.

* [Mango highlights from EVO 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxX8eIf6LvA). Everything after the first wobbles clip is in the losers bracket. everyone after that is really fucking good. Mango is just...too good.
* [Axe v Silent Wolf EVO 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZIxUjct3uo). As much as it pains me to watch this one, being from SW's area and all, it's just such an amazing set. Game three though.... holy crap.
* [Kage v MattDotZeb ROM 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JpcxpHZG0E). This set is actually the one that made me follow the competitive scene, and also made me choose Ganondorf as my main. I love this set, the hype and all.
* [aMSa v DJNintendo at the Apex 2014 Salty Suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbQAkbswxyI). This is really just a showcase match between the two masters of each character played here (DJNintendo doesn't actually play Bowser in tournament, unless he's tryna surprise someone). For those that don't know, Yoshi is a terrible character. But when aMSa came around, he sindle handedly shoved Yoshi like five spots up the tier list (out of a game with only 26 characters!). He also has an incredible set [v Mango at Apex 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTD5sgsoMKA) and it's such an insane set. aMSa is also known for just being such a happy guy, and you can see it in the playercams when he plays that he is smiling like none other.
* [Bizarro Flame v Eikelmann at the Apex 2015 Salty Suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9QdMmIZCQk) As a Ganondorf main, I definitely jizzed at least twice during this set. The start is kind of cringey, but this is Melee meets the WWE haha (BTW, Eikelmann didn't speak Russian, he said 'Your evisceration is imminent!')
* [Lord v S2J at The Next Episode's Falcon Round Robin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKfGNdSxy5E). WATCH TIL THE END. WATCH TIL THE FUCKING EENNNNNND GAAAAAAH


There's too many other sets that I'd like to link, but if I continue the list it'd become waaaay too long and I still would probably miss something. I encourage you to search up other sets if you're interested, as well as scrolling through my other discussion posts for the sets I linked in those.

If you're interested in the history of the scene, I encourage you to watch the nine-part documentary series by Samox titled [The Smash Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSf2mgkRm7Q&list=PLoUHkRwnRH-IXbZfwlgiEN8eXmoj6DtKM&index=1). This documentary spurred the insane growth that the scene experienced in the months after EVO 2013, and is largely considered the reason why so many of the top Smash icons are in their esteemed positions today. Without this documentary, we'd still be playing in basements and not in the Mandalay Bay event center for EVO 2016. Samox also has a new documentary/follow up, focusing on Armada, PPMD, and the growth of the scene after this first documentary. I highly, highly encourage you to watch this one and await the next.

If you now wanna play the game, go find your local scene. Most people are more than willing to let new players try it out, cause in the end we all just wanna play the game.

Thank you for reading these posts of mine, and hopefully I've conveyed just how amazing this game is.

I wasn't able to keep up with the second half of the rewatch due to schoolwork, but I marathoned the last few episodes today and caught up on the threads. I'm glad to see that you managed to do the writeup for Mango; it's almost scary how many parallels there are between Ping Pong and the Melee scene.

On a miscellaneous note, it's funny that you mention Streets 1:12, because [Streets 1:11 was accomplished just a few days ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnqvtUWxRNA).

I didn't post when the threads went up, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading everyone's well thought out posts. As a first time watcher, I really helped along the way. This is a great show, and I'm upset at myself for putting off watching it so long. Severely underrated. On another note, this was my first sports anime. Are they all this good? Lol

Many thanks to the host for the rewatch
>> ARTICLE
Well, this was a character driven drama in a sport setting. Many aren't like that, though, a lot are actually. 
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of good sports anime, some great sports anime. Ping Pong is at it's own level. Most sports anime are really long shows, too.

From what I have watched (most of them are shonen/sports/comedy):

[Cross Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5941/Cross_Game), a highschool baseball show by Mitsuru Adashi, who have dozens of sports manga written and 3 or 4 anime shows based on some of them. Watched it right after Ping Pong and I still gave it a 10. Best first episode ever, IMO. 50 episodes.

[Slam Dunk](http://myanimelist.net/anime/170/Slam_Dunk), a high school basketball show, an absolute classic, great characters and story. Downside, it doesn't cover the last arc from the manga. 101 episodes.

[Hajime no Ippo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo), a pro boxing show, goes forever, first season came out in 2000 with 75 episodes, there are canon movies and 2 other seasons, last one from 2013. Manga is over 1100 chapters and could keep going other thousand episodes if the author feels like it.
>> ARTICLE
That's quite a list, thanks pal

I can second all of these, but recommend he reads the Slam Dunk manga rather than the show. It feels bloated compared to when you read it.

I am not sure what I should say about it. I loved this show a lot. I was digging it from the first episode, and I got more invested as it went on but it was episode 4, when Kong faced Kazama when I was undeniably hooked. I don't usually marathon shows, normally I really can't even bring myself to, even though I like anime getting myself to sit down and pay attention to an episode takes considerable effort, but I think Ping Pong: The Animation is a show that might be willing to watch through in a day on more than one occasion in the future. By the way, would it be improper for me to just call it Ping Pong (when in the context of talking about anime of course, so people wouldn't think I just mean the sport) instead of Ping Pong: The Animation?

I'm a fairly impressionable person, and I am not critical of most art, I find that I am usually able to enjoy myself even with stupid, trite, and not particularly well done pieces, and in addition my memory isn't the best, so trying to think back of other shows to compare this to wouldn't be very meaningful; so sometimes I feel as though me being extremely impressed by this anime isn't giving it high praise. But I honestly don't think I've ever seen anything *better* than Ping Pong: The Animation, although it won't be replacing my number 1
>> ARTICLE
I've compared this show to PMMM before and I really think that the comparison fits. Not the themes or outcomes, of course, but merely that the show accomplishes everything that it needs to in such a brief span of time. I think brevity is one of the most difficult things to pull of in a narrative structure and was just shocked at how much I loved this show. I'm picky, I'm pretentious but something about the way we see each and every character grows and change resonates in me in such a way that I don't think any other anime has captured before. Bravo! 
>> ARTICLE
Had a blast rewatching this for the first time. Gave me an excuse to finally open the Blu-Rays. 
>> ARTICLE
This is my favorite anime of all time! Hopefully everyone that was new to this anime found something they could enjoy. Whether it was the intense matches, the interesting character, the unique art style and direction or the lovely OST.

I've been watching heaps of different anime since I got into the medium a couple years ago and Ping Pong the Animation is the only anime I've watched multiple times. To be honest, I've watched the show 5 times over now and I find it still has plenty to offer regardless of how often I watch it.

In the end, what I liked the most bout this show was how it's ability to make me connect with the characters. This still is the only anime that had me completely emotionally invested into all the characters, and the only anime that has made me shed a tear (or 20)

Frankly, sports anime the past 10 years or so has been incredible. Not that many 'rote sports shows' and most are pretty interesting takes on their respective sports. The most 'rote' sports show nowadays is Ace of Diamond but it's a fantastic baseball anime and arguably one of the best of its kind. Maybe Yowamushi Pedal fits that bill as well, but it's another fantastic show that puts in unexpected twists and does a great job building up the characters.

But yeah, Ping Pong is a tad different to how many sports anime is. Most sports anime follows through on entire tournaments, but Ping Pong races through them a lot quicker and instead, focuses on the character more intensely with what few episodes they work with.
>> ARTICLE
Just the killer moves that in Shounen they bring out for Villians/Opponents. After a while it gets staid for it enters a pattern.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's the thing. They may have 'go to moves' but it's usually not that bad with many sports shows these days. I think many sports anime/manga writers learned not to abuse it the way Prince of Tennis did. Kuroko no Basket has some of that, but the super moves are always combated with other super moves, it kind of evens out. Or in the case of Ace of Diamond or Big Windup, they have actual quirks as sportsmen and just use mindgames to get one up on eachother. Actually, baseball anime tends to be good with the mindgames aspect. Even with shows with the 'killer moves'.
>> ARTICLE
AotD is too shounen like for me. Some great baseball anime would include Major and Crossgame. If you're up for some older animation, touch and H2 are great as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I love all those sports anime. Though Touch and Cross Game could pass more as romantic dramas than pure shonen. AotD does have some really good matches recently so I really like that about it. Not to mention it's good when an anime actually has the ability to go 50+ episodes to fully flesh out tournaments. I realize that's not for everyone though.
>> ARTICLE
11 is the number to win a match (also the number of episodes).

I don't even consider Ping Pong a sports anime, it's more of a character study using sports as sort of a lens. They honestly could have used anything else as the basis, and it still would have been fantastic. That being said, I really enjoyed the matches so I'm not sure how I would've felt about it.

Other than that I pretty much agree with everything you said.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I found interesting about it. It just uses the sport as a tool to study the characters instead of you actually caring about the sport. The matches were great but watching the characters develop is what made the show amazing.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't even consider Ping Pong a sports anime, it's more of a character study using sports as sort of a lens.

So it's every sports shonen ever? I'm sorry but I find this particular claim about Ping Pong so incredibly obnoxious. This is literally what pretty much ever shonen does, with varying levels for proficiency. (Some are less mature, but they still have the same aim, to develop their characters through their relation to sports)
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong focuses more on the characters and less on the sports, unlike many other sports anime that bring the rules of the game and the way it's scored into the picture. The only anime other that Ping Pong that does this is Haikyuu in my experience, so it's a legitimate point. 

And your comment is the one thats obnoxious, shoving your chin at someone who is simply stating their opinion,
>> ARTICLE
In my first read over of his comment it came off as a lot more condescending to the sports anime that it actually was, I had a exhaustion fuelled knee jerk reaction.

>The only anime other that Ping Pong that does this is Haikyuu

I disagree, my point is exactly the opposite of this, Haikyuu is an example the shows that most sports shows aspire to do the same thing as Ping Pong (Cross game for example), Ping Pong is just impeccably excecuted



>> ARTICLE
How is it obnoxious? I'm just giving my opinion of Ping Pong, I didn't even assert my opinion nor claim it's better/worse than any other anime. If you get salty over that, I'm not sure how you survive on the internet.
>> ARTICLE
You come off as trying to disassociate it from the sports genre, as if it is somehow separate from the genre. (rereading your post it doesn't seem to imply that the sports genre is somehow below Ping Pong like a lot of similar posts do)

I actually reacted a bit harshly due to previous trauma, my bad :p
>> ARTICLE
I never tried to disassociate it, I simply said I don't consider it a "sports anime," as in the anime's primary focus is the actual sport. You're just assuming things from reading my comment, try to read what I actually said without putting words in my mouth.
>> ARTICLE
I see "not considering it as a sports anime" as disassociating it from the genre. I think I snuck it into an edit before, but I definitely overreacted and your tone wasn't at all like the tone of a lot of other posts i've come across.

It's more of a character study than a ping pong focused show. But I guess it would add to the experience if you actually like the sport. I mean, I finished the show and still know very little about the mechanics of the game lol.

Yeah, most people get turned off from its visual style (which I'm not a huge fan of myself), but it was deliberately set up that way to suit the show's tone. The characters are interesting anyway; that's what I most need to enjoy something, so I ended up really enjoying this series.

I feel like I say that about 85% of the anime I watch......I've probably gone soft.
>> ARTICLE
Regarding the original design, you sure must not be rebuked by bold drawings to appreciate the show.

Not only were the colors flat, the lines rugged, or drawn where you wouldn't have some in anime normally. But you got those simplified (usually for far away background) drawings used for mid-range scenes... I had difficulties differentiating the bald dudes, because they wouldn't show the eyebrows (the only way you can tell which is who visually) so often.

But at the same time the action scenes during matches felt so right. The style became spot on for fast moving characters, its simplicity made it all more readable.

I'm really curious of what animators will learn from it.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh I didn't enjoy the show that much like most of people do. The show is great, but there was some sort of "generic shounen" going on at several last episodes.

[Spoiler](/s "Kazama is a pro player, and at his age he achieved gold medal in Olympic young age. So it struck me as unrealistic when he lost to Hoshino because the guy just started to practice seriously in a few months and wanted to become "a hero". Table tennis, just like any other mechanically intensive sports, requires a lot of time to practice as well as having talents. Kazama has both, unlike Neko. So I really don't see any reasons why he should have lost the game. It's like asking a pro player to lose to a random-highschool-but-having-talent dude.")
>> ARTICLE
Adding to the comments already made, Kazama was sad? I don't know how to put it in a word very well, it was clear that he was getting tired of playing all the time, and being at the top all the time, he wanted a break. He used to lock himself in the bathroom during the tournament, Peco, who WANTED to play, and also did it for fun instead of money or fame or being at the top, "showed" him the truth about the sport, and made him play less seriously, or poorer. Not to mention Peco was said to be more talented than Kazama, and yeah, although he took a break, he had been playing Ping Pong for his entire life up until that point, and after HEAVY training for some time(don't really remember how much) he was able to reach his maximum potential, and also learned discipline.
>> ARTICLE
Well as someone who has played ping pong competitively I can say that after you reach a certain skill cap, its more about how you feel on a particular day and how playstyles match up than actual level of play. There are some people who I regularly beat in practice that would simply up their game during competitions and dumpster me. Also its not like Peco was a noob or anything. He used to be at a national level and just needed to get back there
>> ARTICLE
Peco was already extremely talented. Tamura even mentioned that [Spoiler](/s "his potential surpasses Kazama, so it didn't really bother me that he was able to make a comeback against him.") And honestly the result of the game itself was never the focus, it was all about how they developed.
>> ARTICLE
its not like peco just started to play table tennis, and you forget he was incredibly motivated to meet smile and that kazama was stressed out.

In my opinion, the art style added to the charm of Ping Pong the Animation ,though it definitely did not help sales. I really need to watch Aku no Hana. The manga is so cathartic.

Haha, while catastrophe may be too strong of a word, I definitely wasn't expecting the hounding I received in the thread! But I stick by what I said.

> Although it's a shame the art style kills it a lot of people which hinders it's popularity.

That's true, and it's something I was skeptical about myself before going in. But when you see *why* the art, camera, and composition is done the way it is, it makes not only more sense in relation to the story being presented but also that much more rewarding.

However, as you say, if people don't care to see the purpose and only take it at face-value, then they are all seriously missing out on something truly special.

Weeaboo! I was waiting to see your thoughts here (I know you are one of the biggest fans of this one)

> If you wrote this in an attempt to win some points with me, you succeeded

Ha, so I'm not going to lie: your name popped up in my head a few times while writing this one out. I had read a conversation between you and M8 about your favorite episodes (10 and 6, respectively) and I was eagerly waiting to see what was going to go on within them, and they most certainly did not disappoint. Showcasing [PP Spoilers](/s "everyone's own kind of Christmas Eve based on their lives at the moment") to [PP Spoilers](/s "Dragon finally finding a hero in Peco") were fantastic moments to see.

I wanted to find fault with it myself, but the characters were so incredibly well done and the story essentially boiling down to [PP Big Spoilers](/s "Smile being the hero that Peco needed") made me awestruck to see.

> ...since I usually always try to at least find something to nitpick.

*Finally.* :P

From reading comments here, I think how much anime watchers are accustomed to a certain kind of art style which dominates current anime industry. For me a lot of shows nowadays are generic but I liked some of these. Ping Pong tells me power of story or story telling. Or power of characters. Also some people regard quality and quantity of drawings as quality of the show. But Ping Pong also tells me that gorgeousness doesn't always assure good experience. Difference and simplicity also work brilliantly when these fit in its content. What if Ping Pong has another art style of GitS, Fate, Haruhi, Oreimo, SAO, Chika, Kankore, Aldnoah or any others? The experience might have changed a lot - been degraded imo. 

I'm not forcing others to watch this. Different people have different tastes. But we'll see quality stories of quality characters when we accept this art style. And we can accept broader tastes when we finished this.

Just curious, are you ever going to ditch the standard format? Personally, I feel like breaking a review down to different sections ruins the flow of the narrative. It also gives lazy readers the option to skip right into the score.    
    
Regardless, this was another good review. Looking forward to more. 
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, the format does not matter as much as execution and substance in the review. You notice how this is a generic format used by unfortunately too many people in MAL but executing and writing barely anything without backing up their claims. /u/BanjoTheBear here does it well enough to "get away with it", I mean if you just read his review you see that the substance shadows the format. Also keep in mind he might be targeting a broad audience, some of the "general viewers" like it this way, while some like flow as you and me. I have to say it is decently balanced and well done so far.

Although.. the summary part would be in favor of my preference if he wrote it instead of tl;dr it. We all have our ways of doing things.

[:3](http://i.imgur.com/Yw9pCoY.gif)

> Although.. the summary part would be in favor of my preference if he wrote it instead of tl;dr it. 

I've actually never considered doing it that way. That section was an "invention" of mine when I first started out, because I thought to myself, "There are people who probably just want a quick 'here's everything that I just wrote, condensed' type of review.

Because as you say, I try to hit all audiences at once: the invited, the interested, and the truly invested. And what I have -- more or less -- does the job nicely and to my satisfaction. :)
>> ARTICLE
> Just curious, are you ever going to ditch the standard format?

Curiousness is definitely a boon to have. :)

Short answer, no. I like it this way, even if it is "standard" or "generic" in its presentation. It makes it easy to both collect my own thoughts and to allow people to peruse particular sections they may be having interest in.

> It also gives lazy readers the option to skip right into the score.

Believe it if you will, but this is one reason why I do it this way. I don't mind if people are just looking for a score, want a quick synopsis of what I've written from my summary, or take the time to read over everything that I've written. If someone is willing to take time out of their day to show me some satisfaction by even considering what I have to say, I'm very appreciative of that.

Now, obviously, I'm going to be *more* grateful to the people who sit down and take their time reading the entirety of my article; someone who spends more time digesting my words in turn deserves more praise from me. But my format allows anybody -- from the lazy to the patient -- to take a look at what a random guy on the Internet has to say. :3

Thanks man. I appreciate the kind words and compliments.

When I was going into it, I was really wondering how strong it would be throughout. But it really demonstrates just how powerful characters can be when it comes to anime. Not only in what they represent, but how they progress as people.

Thanks again for support. I hope I can continue living up to expectations! :3
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure that if I watched it, which I probably will eventually, it would score either a 9 or a 10 on my scale. However, even with that being said, something about Ping Pong doesn't make me want to watch it. I don't think different is *bad* but since it's so different I don't really want to watch it because it doesn't feel like anime anymore. In that case, it touches the border that makes it another masterpiece in a medium that I don't have a particular interest in.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't think different is bad but since it's so different I don't really want to watch it because it doesn't feel like anime anymore.

It's interesting that you say that, because it isn't inviting.

For me, I didn't find Tatami Galaxy galaxy to be that strong, the art/animation is known for being ugly, and it just screams "different," as you say. But once you really sit down and start watching it, you really start to forget about everything else and begin focusing heavily on what it has to offer.

I think you would definitely find it worthwhile, Rice. This one seems right up your alley in regards to story and character importance.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'll watch it eventually. But as you know, I'm coming back from a hiatus so I have to catch up on stuff from the last 2 seasons that I missed as well as stuff that was already clogging up my plan to watch list.

Gah, don't remind me! I saw a nice fellow's list recently that had over *500* anime in his/her PTW. Me at 70 already feels overwhelmed. :P
>> ARTICLE
I was waiting for this review. I was actually writing you a message a few days ago to recommend watching ping pong next, but then I saw that you were already watching it and didn't send it.  

I don't have anything to say regarding the story/characters because I agree with pretty much everything you said about them. I do want to say something about the art/animation though. I can see why people dislike it, but I think the art fits ping pong perfectly. I also absolutely love those panels they are using. However, I sadly can't say the same about the animation.  
It's very obvious that they didn't have a huge budget to work with. There are tons of recycled scenes and movements which were too obvious to not attract my attention. For example, background characters always did the exact same movements when playing ping pong. Those aren't huge problems but they made me enjoy some scenes a lot less.   
I think the story/characters are a lot more important than the animation, but in this case it was enough to prevent me from giving the show a 10.

> The soundtrack for the anime is amazing.

It really is. I watched ping pong a few weeks ago and since then I've listened to the whole soundtrack more than 15 times. I don't even have a favourite song, the OST just has too many great ones to choose from. 

> Smile is so aptly named because he never smiles.

That actually isn't why he's named Smile. Peco said that [Spoiler?](/s "he gave him the nickname after Makoto smiled for the first time when they won a tournament when they were young")

Overall another great review and I'm glad you like the show.
>> ARTICLE
> ...but in this case it was enough to prevent me from giving the show a 10.

Yea, I can respect that. For me, I went the other way; I felt that everything else was way too well done to really fault it for the lower animation at times.

> I don't even have a favourite song...

It's gotta be "Dragon" for me; I'm such a sucker for choir singing like that. :P

> That actually isn't why he's named Smile.

You are correct, but I wanted to avoid spoiling *too* much with what I've written. Obviously I allude to specific moments in the anime, but I felt that that was a pretty big one that really revealed what the story was about, and refrained from giving a completely faithful answer. :)

Hrmm! What are your other two? I'd like to know! :3

> ...but aren't you limiting yourself a bit by only using four different categories...

*Five;* "Enjoyment" is factored in as well.

Regardless, I find the way in which I segment my review to be fitting for the way I look at different anime. I think this is my 75th or so review, and using this same format for each of them has given me (more or less) a good feel for the analysis/rating I give each show.

That is, I don't feel constricted by doing it in this particular fashion because...

> Your examples

...I do take into account these types of elements. I apply leniency where I feel it is warranted. Your Mushishi example is good, and would cause me to look at it in a different light than this one. Or something like Monogatari, where the characters matter a lot more than the narrative, would again be looked at differently. Obviously my "leniency factor" has no real grounded value, nor is it infallible, but I do make sure to take the genre, purpose, and direction of an anime before fully reviewing it.

> Also animation and sound aren't really that important in the big picture

For you, maybe. For me, both are highly important, as much as the story and the characters involved. Ping Pong contains a unique art style, but it's more than that: it's panel-like views and two-paneled conversations aren't there to be special, but serve a greater purpose in the grand scheme of things. While the animation itself may get low at times, I found the art and rest of the animation to be strong enough to forego some of the more obvious examples.

In short, my reviews/rating take *the entire package* into account, and all of it matters in the end.

Good questions and insight, and thanks for the kind words! :3

I don't think it's right to say that Mushishi doesn't have a story. It's just episodic. Also animation and sound have a lot to do with an anime, anime is a visual medium first and foremost. Also sound plays a large part when it comes to setting an atmosphere. He mentioned a lot of positive aspects about Ping Pong's art.

Probably gonna get heat from saying this, but i actually **dropped** Ping-Pong after episode 4. I'm not into sports genre anime's, whether it's basketball or ping pong, it all feels the same for me. I gave ping-pong a shot after hearing so much about how "It's not so much about the sport itself, it's so good because of how MC's strive to overcome the odds and the hardships they go through.." yada yada yada. 

It may be relatively short (11 episodes) but watching this anime, i really was just saying in the back of my mind, "i'd much rather be watching something else right now". Pacing was a bit slow imo, as good as everyone claims the Animation is, i really wasn't feeling it. 

**TL;DR**: i was watching this only to check out the hype for myself. I felt pretty pressured into saying i liked it. To those who don't respect others (Shit) tastes in anime...  (&#3232;_&#3232;)

Hey, Thornnn.

> Probably gonna get heat from saying this, but i actually dropped Ping-Pong after episode 4.

No heat from me! I respect what you have to say and how you think, so what you write here is very interesting to me. I always enjoy reading a differing opinion on the subject in question.

> ...it all feels the same for me

This is a very good point, actually.

So, while I was writing this review, I was thinking back to my first ever "10/10" review way back in August of last year, which was Chihayafuru. Which, if people don't know, is another sports anime.

I was thinking to myself, as I started to compare them, "are these the same thing? They're both shows about 'weird' sports that have crazy good characters and a good story to boot." What I concluded was that they are, in fact, different. Chihayafuru spends a nice amount of time utilizing the *actual game* to develop the characters playing it. As in, the cards, the poems, and the play-styles shape and develop the characters in Chihayafuru. For Ping Pong, the sport doesn't shape the characters, but merely gives them the *opportunity* to connect and be shaped by their opponents.

It's a slight difference, and while they obviously aren't entirely restricted to my descriptions there, my conclusion is that sports anime can most certainly be separate from one another.

> Pacing was a bit slow imo, as good as everyone claims the Animation is, i really wasn't feeling it.

That's alright. Sometimes certain anime will resonate more clearly with you than others, and Ping Pong wasn't one of them. I can attest to this; my love for Chu2Koi is off the charts, to the point of insanity to some people here! :3

> To those who don't respect others (Shit) tastes in anime...

I know we all joke about that all the time, but seriously, just know that when you are dealing or speaking with me, I absolutely and 100% respect your stance or opinion on a particular show. I think it's awesome to see differing viewpoints or perspectives on varying anime, and yours here gives me a lot of insight about Ping Pong in general.

Thanks for the nice comment! :)

> my conclusion is that sports anime can most certainly be separate from one another.

That's real interesting. I think it could be a mixture of "checking out hyped anime" & hard-headedness on my behalf that disallows me to get into Sports Genre Animes as a whole. 

IRL i played 10 years of Football *(love Football, but got a huge concussion in my 3rd to final game my senior Year in highschool, had to opt out of a College Football Career, it'll follow me to my grave)* and i enjoy mountain biking *(ever since i first got on a bike at age 5, i been on many Bike Meets/Runs and such).*  

There's just some sports i can't learn to love like: Basketball *(Grew up in San Antonio, Texas.. Spurs being shoved down your throat for 15 years in hard to take in)*, Baseball *(only like watching it live at stadiums, Can't enjoy watching it on TV if i tried)*, and i hate Soccer with a passion.. etc. 

So with all that in mind, i probably wouldn't mind a Football Anime, **which probably will never happen.** 

When it comes to Ping Pong and other sports genres, i guess i just can't relate to what the MC's are feeling cause my interests and past experience don't match up irl.

Well there *is* Eyeshield, but it's really nothing like football.

I find I like some sports anime about sports I don't even like.  For example, I hate boxing but love Hajime no Ippo.

If I may be so bold as to make some recommendations:

Chihayafuru: card game, super fast paced, literally like crack once you get past the third episode.

Major: I know you said you don't like baseball, but it's not like watching it on TV, it's a lot more condensed and feels more exciting than watching baseball on TV.  It's a long anime so you literally see the mc develop from child to adult. Also, the feels

Hajime no Ippo: Boxing, great character development, more comedy than other sports anime, but had a slow start

Yowamushi Pedal: cycling anime, it's a pretty average sports anime though

>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the recommendations, I'm always down to try things out. 

putting Chihayafuru and Hajime no Ippo on my PTW list, look interesting enough. 

I think the closest to a Boxing Anime i've seen was [Grappler Baki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/287/Grappler_Baki_%28TV%29) which i recommend if it interests you, just thought i'd throw that out there: [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDq0Svi2GaA)

Ping Pong was great, but I just couldn't get into it as much as Yuasa's other works. The art style was the worst he's ever done in my opinion (I usually love his art styles) and I didn't like the way every character's struggles are resolved via [](/s "a timeskip that came out of nowhere. Kind of defeats the purpose of a show about personal growth if we don't get to see it in action"). Yuasa is still my man, but I'll stick to Kaiba and the Tatami Galaxy.
>> ARTICLE
> The art style was the worst he's ever done in my opinion

All of his works look pretty "bleh," to be honest. :P

I took the skip in similar fashion to TTG's [TTG Spoilers](/s "nonchalant, off-hand comment about Watashi's romance 'not being important' and therefore not being shown or mentioned after all was said and done.") That is, what was important wasn't so much the actual growth but *how* they came to grow as people.

> ...Kaiba and the Tatami Galaxy.

So, Kaiba is one I really want to get to -- I'm huge on romance. But TTG is one that I don't find to be as strong as other people make it out to be. So for now, we stand at a cross-roads. :3

Pfffft, the Tatami Galaxy and Kaiba (again...) were absolutely gorgeous.

In Tatami, we actually got to see the cathartic moment though. It makes sense to breeze by the aftermath, but [](/s "we didn't even get to see the climax in Ping Pong")

You don't need to see them in action since we had already seen the moments that motivated them to change. Wasting two episode on the run of the mill stuff is pretty unnecessary.

Yeah; AFTER it happened.  I don't want to see the aftermath, I want to see the climatic moment where everything you went through actually paid off in the end. That's one of the many things that makes his other works, like the Tatami Galaxy, so superior in my opinion.

It happened already on screen though. We saw the exact climatic moment when they reached the epiphany

They've been having epiphanies throughout the entire show. The plot was 90% epiphanies. A climax should be something more

And funny enough none of the matches in the second half of the series ended with score shown, but of the defeated realising something greater. The entire series was building up to the "rescue the princess" within Tsukimoto, and just like Dragon his personal liberation is the key moment in the series as he finally witnessed the triumph return of his hero.

And yet, again, we never see the hero actually win

All those points he took from Tsukimoto, the absolute dominance, all the momentum is with him. If it wants to waste time to do the usual sports series shenanigan drama sure I can see what you mean, but he already won back his respect

I might be one of the few who thinks Ping Pong was mediocre to ok.
 I didn't care for most characters (except Wenge who might be the reason I didn't drop the anime), the art was ugly as hell and animation wasn't great either so I couldn't even enjoy that. Not to mention the visual direction which actually annoyed me - there are only so many split screens I can take.

In short, I don't care about Ping Pong.
>> ARTICLE
> I might be one of the few who thinks Ping Pong was mediocre to ok.

And that's an okay stance to have. From what you have written, it seems you take issue with a lot of the characters involved, causing your overall investment with the anime to be minimal. Being more a character piece than a story-driven one, it's understandable how you view it this way.

> (except Wenge who might be the reason I didn't drop the anime)

Kong was pretty cool, and was someone I didn't expect to have the development that he did. Same for Akuma; I didn't expect the two of them to be as worthwhile overall to what was going on in the long-run, but seeing Akuma and him grow from defeat was very special.

My favorite character probably goes to Dragon. I can't particularly relate to constricting isolation, but seeing him go from completely grounded to "higher than a kite" was quite exhilarating.

> Not to mention the visual direction which actually annoyed me - there are only so many split screens I can take.

See, I found this to be endearing; just the really unique way of showing the "motion without motion" as I call it in my review. Making it into a moving/talking comic book was very peculiar but seemed to click with me the entire time.

> In short, I don't care about Ping Pong.

Hopefully for you (and me!) Yuasa's next work brings about the magic that he everyone knows he can direct.

Ha, well, if we want to be fair here, and since we are talking about a Yuasa work, I rated The Tatami Galaxy a 6/10, which I guess is kind of unheard of when people talk about that one.

Granted (and being fair once more), it was one of the "first" anime I watched -- somewhere in the first 20 to 30 or so -- and at the time I was not dissecting anime/reviewing them like I do now. My guess is that that score will go up when I sit down and watch it one last time.

Hey Banjo! Thanks for taking the time to write yet another fantastic review, this sub really needs more quality content I feel.

You've captured pretty much everything I loved about this show. I must say, I have become a huge fan of Masaaki Yuasa after watching this show and his other works.

While I think Tatami Galaxy was better than Ping Pong in some aspects like the impact of the show, this is still my favorite from 2014. All in all I'm more than okay with the false advertisement :p

Hi, IC.

> Thanks for taking the time to write yet another fantastic review

It was my pleasure. I had a fun time going through this one, both the anime and the review itself. :)

> ...I have become a huge fan of Masaaki Yuasa after watching this show and his other works.

He's growing on me. I'm probably going to re-watch The Tatami Galaxy to get a final, definitive look at it (as in, properly review it), and I really want to give Kaiba a shot at some point here. For now, though, I'm at least a big fan of Ping Pong. :P

> While I think Tatami Galaxy was better than Ping Pong in some aspects like the impact of the show...

That's true, TTG does have a stronger message in the end, but the characters in it come nowhere near what Ping Pong has to offer. As in, one has a pretty strong story while the other has pretty strong characters.

Meaning, what he has to do next is make "The Ping Pong Galaxy," causing a space-time rift to occur and imploding anime as we know it. :3

Thanks for the kind words, and I hope to see you in my next one.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say 10/10 is a bit too high. Even with Yuasa's unique style, the animation just simply wasn't good. I do understand your argument that this was a "hero comic book," but the animation was just poor.

Recycled scenes, single movements, poor game pace...and especially during these ping pong games took some of that enjoyment away when watching some of the matches (although the important matches were done well). I also didn't really agree with the staff portraying Dragon as a dragon, but *that* part is pure personal preference. I feel like saying they were panels is a bit of an excuse for lack of quality.

I did love all the anime-original stuff the added, especially to Wenge and how he was "saved" at the end. Sound was amazing, characters were amazing, and so was the story. Really a 10/10 adaptation there.

Just the animation quality took a bit some points off of the entire experience, so I would give it a 8.5~9/10. Great review as always, though. Very nice read, and you make a very good argument for rating this anime a 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
>Even with Yuasa's unique style, the animation just simply wasn't good. 

it's Matsumoto's art style, but yeah the animation was my only gripe with the anime. So many static crowds and reused scenes...
>> ARTICLE
> ...but the animation was just poor.

It's hard, because with something like this -- with it already looking quite shoddy and rough in the first place -- one might argue that poor animation "fits" it perfectly. That it falls in line with the style that the anime was going for.

While I don't believe that to be the case, I was in the same boat. I was contemplating for a long time, wondering if the animation, from what I had consumed and experienced, was bad enough to warrant a docking to the overall score. Obviously in the end, I decided that the art and its direction were strong enough to eliminate or at least forgive some of the more obtuse examples, but believe me when I say that I struggled coming to this conclusion.

> I feel like saying they were panels is a bit of an excuse for lack of quality.

And it most likely is; their ability to make the show like a comic book was probably both a tactic done on purpose and as an easy way to avoid animating more than they had to. Which just adds to the cleverness of it all.

> Great review as always, though. Very nice read...

Thanks, ss. Yea, if the art wasn't as strong or as purposeful, I would be right there alongside you. While I'm not against modern-day looking anime (Chu2Koi :3), I appreciated an "experimental" style that was more than just trying to be different.

And maybe to elaborate further on the topic. For me a 10 doesn't necessarily mean "masterpiece; flawless; perfection incarnate." No anime is perfect (except Chu2Koi/Ren! :P), meaning as long as it can perform remarkably across the board (even with a hiccup or two along the way), I'll give it that top score.
>> ARTICLE
>It's hard, because with something like this -- with it already looking quite shoddy and rough in the first place -- one might argue that poor animation "fits" it perfectly. That it falls in line with the style that the anime was going for.

This is plain bullshit Banjo. You might want to look up nave art style, since it's something Matsumoto is quite known for using in his works like Ping Pong, Tekkon Kinkreet, Sunny and Blue Spring. It's fair enough that you consider nave art to be shoddy, but the animation was definitely not made to be shoddy/fit a shoddy art style. They obviously don't consider nave art shoddy themselves, so this argument is just plain stupid. Budget constraints (and the studio isn't exactly known for consitency) are the cause, and they fixed a lot on the BDs. If it was intended to look "bad", then they wouldn't need to fix it. Also there was tons of undeniably beautiful background art in it.
>> ARTICLE
> This is plain bullshit Banjo.

:O

> (What I say in my previous comment)
>
> While I don't believe that to be the case...

Just want to make sure that we are on the same page, niea. :3

Yea, I don't excuse the lower animation quality at times to be purposeful in context of the anime itself, simply because they are/were capable of showing some rather average to above-average quality animation during certain segments.

> ...(and the studio isn't exactly known for consitency)

Perhaps this is something that I need to look into further when doing my reviews. I usually look at some of the cast involved -- director, sound composer, etc. -- and take note of the voice actors/actresses that perform well, but rarely do I delve into the studio besides just seeing who made it. As in, I don't always take their track records into account. But if that will help with formulating my reviews in the future, I should probably consider doing even more research.

Thanks for the input, niea. Even if your initial sentence caught me off-guard a little bit! :P
>> ARTICLE
Not sure how I missed that sentence, sorry.

I don't think it's necessary to include a track record or directly comment on it in the review. It's just good to at least take a look at it first, as it may dispell some theories one might have (like the one about the animation being deliberately bad). I would definitely say it's important to take a look at the creator (Matsumoto in this case) though. So many people assume it's Yuasa's art style because it's very in-line with the rest of his works. With Ping Pong it's also interesting to note how much of the work was already done by Matsumoto, as his paneling is extremely convenient for adaptation. He's very good at creating movement and flow in his manga, and especially in his works here he uses his nave art style. The art creates a big focus on expressions in general, as he can go off model to symbolize feelings with more than just the face.

I still feel the manga for Ping Pong was superior, but the anime was fantastic as well. The soundtrack was so good.
>> ARTICLE
> From the outset, the art is, bluntly put, ugly. It's literally rough around the edges and characters can have misshapen figures at any given time. But this is part of the allure, the "charm," that it exudes.

"Charm" like cutting off my dick with a spoon.

Edit:

From all that I've read, including your review, I would probably love to watch it.  But that's pretty much never going to happen unless they re-release with different art direction.

Edit2:

There's a concept on forums where flaming and trolling happens -- there is the type of troll who acts stupid and acts like an idiot, and when you corner them and call them on it, they turn around and say "I WAS JUST PRETENDING TO BE STUPID, FOOLED YOU!".

When you try really hard at being stupid or looking ugly, and you succeed, **that is not generally a good thing**.  Despite the fact that Ping Pong can pat itself on the back for "succeeding", it still looks like shit.
>> ARTICLE
> When you try really hard at being stupid or looking ugly, and you succeed, that is not generally a good thing. 

I see what you mean. And honestly I don't fault anyone for taking issues with the art or animation that it presents.

However, after finding connections and purpose with at least the art, and seeing how the style can actually play a part or have meaning besides just being there for visuals, it made the overall experience that much more worthwhile to me.

I hope maybe at some point you do give it a shot -- you've seen quite a bit of anime already, so I think one anime that looks a bit funky when compared to the "norm" shouldn't be too hard for you! :3
>> ARTICLE
Funky and unconventional is fine.  I'm not *M* enough to watch *bad*.

Edit:  After reconsidering the fact that I'm actually watching Majin Bone, I should rephrase:  I'm not *M* enough to watch *horrifically bad*, because apparently I can watch pretty steep levels of bad.

I guess what it comes down to is that I watch anime for entertainment, not for art.  Ping Pong strikes me as an anime trying really hard to be artistic, to the point of sacrificing its entertainment value for it (either that or the artists are just lazy; I don't know if that was a decision point in that way).  That goes against the fundamental reason why I hit the "play" button, so it's just likely never going to happen.

From an abstract perspective, if the art of Ping Pong is the "barrier to entry", I have to ask why the artists are so bad or incompetent or self-defeating that they want to set up an artificial barrier to entry to reduce the appeal, accessibility, or enjoyment of their product.   Barriers to entry are normally things that are unavoidable.  By definition they hinder "good".  The art for Ping Pong is something determined by the artist/studio/whatever.  Are we talking budget constraints?  If "art" itself invokes a barrier to entry, then that art is fundamentally flawed and incomplete.

Man you fuckers are LATE!!! I rewatched Ping Pong last week!!! 

...I guess i could do it again :P
>> ARTICLE
My favorite show of all time. Might join you guys but having recently rewatched it I'm not so sure.
>> ARTICLE
Will I enjoy Ping Pong the anime if I don't like Ping Pong the sport?  I am not big into sports anime or sports irl but I did like Kuroko no Basque?
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong the Animation isn't a show about ping pong, it's a show about a bunch of characters who all happen to play ping pong.
>> ARTICLE
For me, who grew up in the #2 holy land of Ping Pong but who hates the sport, the answer is a resounding "YES".

This isn't an anime about sports. This is an anime about duels to the death between men, and some light sporty stuff on the side.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is a character study first and foremost. I can't ever guarantee anything, but if I'd hazard a guess, I think you should watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a huge fan of Ping Pong the Animation that I switched almost all of my IGNs to Peco the Hero
>> ARTICLE
I've been waiting for this, for sure I'll follow the rewatch as well as do some write-ups.
>> ARTICLE
I've been meaning to watch this show for a while.  Glad to finally have an excuse to ~~get off my ass~~ sit my ass down and finally watch it.  
>> ARTICLE
I'M IN!
>> ARTICLE
Well I'll join for my first watch of it, I was going to start earlier, but I guess I'll wait.
>> ARTICLE
Really liked this show, so I'll try to make it for the rewatch! 
>> ARTICLE
hope all the newcomers like it! I absolutely love Ping Pong, it's my favorite anime released in the last 10 years easily.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong rewatch? Let's fucking gooo
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna join as a first time watcher! Hopefully it'll get me interested enough to post some huge essays of reactions :D.
>> ARTICLE
As a first time watcher, I'm pretty pumped for this rewatch! It's so much more fun watching and having discussions with others when venturing into something new.
>> ARTICLE
Can confirm, am genuinely excited! I'll be a first-timer, but as soon as I learned it's by the same guy who wrote Tatami Galaxy I knew I had to check this show out.
>> ARTICLE
...Uh? It's not the same guy. The shared mind with TTG is the director, Masaaki Yuasa. Ping Pong is a manga adaptation, the anime that adapts another novel from the same writer as TTG is Uchouten Kazoku.
>> ARTICLE
Writer, director, whatever

My 7th rewatch in 3 months? LEGGO. It acts as my motivation for life in general.

I think this means it's your destiny to become the greatest ping pong player the world has ever seen.

Yeah, I'm guessing that's for the 90s manga.  Pretty awesome though.
>> ARTICLE
If it was made before 2014 it's more of a Ping Pong shirt than a Ping Pong the Animation shirt, I think.
>> ARTICLE
Would not be surprised if promotional wear was made in the early stages of production for the anime. Totally possible, I can't imagine the characters on the shirt being a random coincidence.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is almost 20 years old.
>> ARTICLE
I have not watched the anime and was unaware that it wasn't anime original.
>> ARTICLE
Oh come on, that is clearly Peco and Smile.    
The manga is from the 90's and there is also a movie from 2002.
>> ARTICLE
No shit, it is Peco and Smile. It's not from Ping Pong *the Animation*, though, which didn't exist until this year.
>> ARTICLE
> it's more of a Ping Pong 

Ahah, my bad.  
When you mention Ping Pong I read it as the sport, not as the manga..
I though you said this was a normal ping pong (sport) shirt 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, now that I think about it the shirt just says Ping Pong.
>> ARTICLE
Still an awesome shirt!
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty cool.  Uniqlo sometimes puts out really cool and well-designed anime/manga related tees.
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently staying with relatives in Japan (I'm from Canada). Would you happen to know if this shirt is available to buy in Tokyo? It's really cool. I would also think there would be a moon one for Tsukimoto. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if it's available in Japan, but I do know that the shirt is from Uniqlo.
>> ARTICLE
That's good because there are a lot of Uniqlos here!
>> ARTICLE
I can imagine you being so excited and trying to explain it to your dad and he is just like, "oh, yeah... cool...(I don't understand what my dumbass son is talking about)"
>> ARTICLE
cool
>> ARTICLE
Always will take another chance to rewatch Ping Pong, count me in if that happens
>> ARTICLE
Totally down for a Ping Pong rewatch.

I'd love to rewatch Ping Pong. Surprised I haven't yet now that I think about it

I was also planning on polling interest for a Ping Pong rewatch, except instead of March, I was thinking May since it's more in line with the show's last lines [Ping Pong slight spoiler](/s ""Summer is coming... Things will get lively again."") and overall atmosphere. 

Would still be down for it if you want to organize one for March, but just wanted to throw it in there. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen FLCL so I'm keen. I was planning on watching it after finishing Gakkougurashi tonight

edit - in march tho... i dont think i can wait that long, damn it all 
>> ARTICLE
Its a show that most people recommend watching twice, so if there's enough interest to make this happen (and you don't hate the show...it can be polarizing), then you could always just rewatch it with us.
>> ARTICLE
twice isn't nearly enough times to watch flcl.

>> ARTICLE
Awesome, I wouldn't mind re-watching with you guys in March
>> ARTICLE
I need to finally get around to finishing ping pong in order to cover the OP, so I'd be down for that
>> ARTICLE
I will watch Ping Pong every chance I get.
>> ARTICLE
Have never seen Ping Pong and upon getting the soundtrack (and ADORING it) I should have rewatched FLCL the 2nd time.  

I will now.
>> ARTICLE
I need to watch Ping Pong, so...
>> ARTICLE
Sounds perfect to me. Both shows have been sitting in my PTW list for too long.
>> ARTICLE
Quite interested in both... By that time, I'll probably have more free time than I do now... *probably*
>> ARTICLE
I would love to rewatch FLCL. When I first watched it, I wasn't in the proper mindset for it so I feel this will give it a fair second chance.

I've been meaning to get around to Ping Pong. I've heard so many good things about it so I would gladly join that rewatch!
>> ARTICLE
Because of the shortness of it, I wouldn't mind if FLCL was rewatched twice, as bookends before and after Ping Pong, except the second time with free reign on spoilers throughout the show*. Not sure how much interest there'd be in that, though.

*(mostly because a lot of the things I'd like to include in an episodic discussion, like Digibro's writeups on the plot beats in each episode, assumes you've already seen the show at least once)
>> ARTICLE
Reddit circlejerk shows rewartch? Count me out.
>> ARTICLE
Massive support for the FLCL rewatch. I'm in 
>> ARTICLE
I'd be up for both honestly.
>> ARTICLE
I love both, so yes.
>> ARTICLE
Yes and yes to a Fooly Cooly rewatch!
>> ARTICLE
I'm down for both. 
>> ARTICLE
One of my favourite animes? Nah m8, no chance. I'll end up marathoning ping pong the moment I start
>> ARTICLE
Agree to the Fooly Cooly rewatch 
>> ARTICLE
You could probs just burn through FLCL in like two hours so I'd feel a little weird doing like a day by day rewatch. Ping Pong I still haven't gotten round to watching though and I was planning to start it next week so I would be down for that. Either way good idea man.
>> ARTICLE
I'm down for the FLCL rewatch because I've never seen it but as for ping pong I love it so much that if I start episode 1 I'll end up finishing 6 or 7 at once. So yes for both
>> ARTICLE
If someone does want to watch Ping Pong I recommend the dub even if you've seen it in sub. It's such a good dub!
>> ARTICLE
I'm down for Ping Pong
>> ARTICLE
Ping pong is in my queue so I vote for that
>> ARTICLE
I'd love to watch ping pong for the first time, like I already have it, but there's too many other shows I'm watching this cour.  
>> ARTICLE
I haven't ever watched either, so I'm in!
>> ARTICLE
Ping pong is a freaking blast! Sign me up
>> ARTICLE
I wouldnt mind re-watching FLCL for like the 7th time
>> ARTICLE
I'm down for both! Love Ping Pong and would love a chance to rewatch it. I've also been meaning to watch FLCL for a while so this would be a great chance to check it out!
>> ARTICLE
I'm up for a Ping Pong rewatch. Watched it for the first time 3 weeks ago and I can't take it out of my head.

For FLCL, I started watching it ages ago, but then I couldn't find any subbed version and the spanish dub was done in spain.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure I've ever heard of Ping Pongo the Animation  but I love FLCL and I wanted to find new shows to watch so I'd be down for both.
>> ARTICLE
I've rewatched Ping Pong recently so I'll pass on that

Totally down for an FLCL rewatch though. 
>> ARTICLE
China best character

also just to put it out there, PPtA is one of the few shows where the Chinese is legit, right down to the accent, unlike the wrangled stuff from Sword of the Stranger. i can close my eyes and still understand what China and his coach are saying.

Yes, we often joke about how Japan has shit taste ^^^it's ^^^not ^^^a ^^^joke , but even a broken clock shows the right time twice per day.

>> ARTICLE
Wow, such a gangsta!
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching this now... This is unlike any other sports anime I've watched and I'm loving it so far.
>> ARTICLE
Largely because it's not really about the sport at all. You could substitute basically any competitive activity for ping pong and the characters and their relationships would still make the show awesome.
>> ARTICLE
the art/animation quality seems fresh too.
>> ARTICLE
"Fresh". The manga original is from the 90's and the anime did a perfect job [adapting the style](http://imgur.com/a/7OWxQ). 
>> ARTICLE
oh I see, I didn't know that. Thanks
>> ARTICLE
Taiyou Matsumoto's style is definitely unique. If you've watched or read blue spring or tekkon kinkreet you can see the same art style. 

Personally I like it even if some people find it ugly (very valid opinion).

Hi there,
Thank you for your interest.
I'm Kensuke Ushio who is a composer of Ping-Pong The Animation.
I hope you enjoyed the music of the series.

Let me introduce myself.
"agraph" is my own solo project.
https://itunes.apple.com/jp/artist/agraph/id322356337
www.agraph.jp

And I'm a member of the band "LAMA".
You might know LAMA as a OP of "No.6" or ED of"Un-Go".
www.lama.jp

And as "kensuke ushio", I made ~~some~~ a few tracks for the OST of "Un-Go","EurekaSeven AO",and "Space Dandy".


Sorry for my poor English.
Thanks,
>> ARTICLE
cool
>> ARTICLE
For a second, I thought you said you were the composer for Ping Pong Club.

If that were the case, it would be good to remain anonymous.  
>> ARTICLE
Your English is perfect!
>> ARTICLE
Your English is completely understandable, don't worry. :)
>> ARTICLE
"New!" was one of my favorite album discoveries in a long time, the second half is beautifully done. Speaking of discovery though, I used to work in college radio here in the states, and lately have been wondering: are there any student-run or just plain independently owned and operated radio stations in Japan that simulcast over the internet? It's definitely not the easiest thing to try and find when you're as new to the language as I am.

Also out of curiosity, do you guys ever press vinyl?
>> ARTICLE
huge fan!!! I really enjoy your music!! :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh damn. I just wanted to say, Ping Pong the Animation was easily one of the best shows I've seen in the past few years. The soundtrack was definitely one of the things that made the show stand out in particular, especially in the last two episodes. Great work on the soundtrack, and great work by everyone else who worked on this show. Seriously, it was fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Ushio san

Love your music, big fan of LAMA, I often listen to NEW!. 
>> ARTICLE
Love the Space Dandy music so far.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT YOU DID SPACE DANDY I LOVE YOU
>> ARTICLE
Lama is one of my favorite Japanese rock bands ever. I'm happy to be able to personally thank you for creating great music.

No 6's Opening is really good!! Im impressed now. Thanks for your music.

Kensuke Ushio please let everyone responsible for every aspect of ping pong the animation know that they made an amazing show that blew away my expectations.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you!
>> ARTICLE
Yesss, Eureka Seven! Fabulous work, sir!
>> ARTICLE
Thank you.
But what I did for Eureka Seven AO is a few arrangement and track making.
So please remember "Koji Nakamura", main composer of EurekaSeven AO ,instead of me :-)
>> ARTICLE
I will remember both of you! Thank you both for making Eureka Seven what it was. I very much enjoyed it as a kid and I still enjoy it today!
>> ARTICLE
I would also like to thank you so much/u/agraphjp  for what you are doing with LAMA, as a big fan of SUPERCAR and especially  it is one of my big regrets of not having been able to ever see him and  live the times i was in Japan. When I heard of the forming of LAMA, I cried :) 

I really like the direction you are taking LAMA and am looking forward to more, and maybe a new album soon!

Thank you!

OMG your soundtrack for the Un-Go ED is amazing! It really opened me to really listening and appreciating the music of anime series.

Thank you.
I love the piano phrase of Un-Go ED "Fantasy".
Now,I dont know that why i can compose such a piano line.:-)
>> ARTICLE
The hero theme is the best soundtrack I've ever heard in any anime. Keep up the good work!!!
>> ARTICLE
Thank you.
I re-composed the hero theme for full-length version.
It's included in OST.
>> ARTICLE
I've really enjoyed your music in all the anime you've composed for. thanks for posting!

Also, please tell Hisako Tabuchi that I am a huge fan of hers! I live in the UK and it can be very hard to get music from her bands. Recently I have been listening to lots of Number Girl, Bloodthirsty Butchers and Toddle!

Holy crap, I can't believe it! Just wanted to tell you that you, and your music, are awesome! I think Ping-Pong had very powerful moments, and two of the defining factors were the characters and the music.

> poor english

I wouldn't have known you were Japanese (or *any* non-English nationality for that matter) if you didn't say your name was Kensuke.
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's 'poor' by the standards of how a native speaker would speak English. One easy way to see that he's Japanese is how polite his style of English is. It's something I've noticed after years of being exposed to Japanese culture. You can see it even among the well-educated Japanese that can speak English fluently.

It's extremely noticeable, and the only way to drop that way of speech is to do things like getting a native speaker/someone who has studied English overseas to teach you English, watch a lot of English movies/series, talk to native speakers frequently or read English novels.
>> ARTICLE
Really, man?  Yes... The politeness *is* noticeable... *everyone* noticed it.  That's not the point.  It was grammatically correct.

I was complimenting his command of the language.  Japanese and English are highly dissimilar in structure and origin.  It's no small feat for one to be fluent in both languages.

Don't be *that guy* who says "Well *I* could tell he wasn't a native speaker."
>> ARTICLE
There were some small mistakes, but that's just the English teacher in me.  That isn't to say his English isn't very good, because it is.  I would be happy for any of my students to go into adulthood writing like that.

Hi Agraph, I made an account just to let you know how much I enjoyed the music in Ping-Pong, definitely one of the most memorable soundtracks of the year. If you don't mind me asking, what production software do you use? I'm currently trying to learn using Audacity/Renoise and it'd be interesting to hear what the pros use.
>> ARTICLE
Hi,Thank you so much.
I use Cubase and many software plug-ins and hardware.
>> ARTICLE
Hello Agraph. I have a question for you. Who is this 5years that remixed some of your songs and where can I know more about them?

Hi,Ringtailsz.

Sorry for confusing.
"5 years" is remix title.not musician's name.
All "5years" is remixed by me myself :-)

Holy crap, I can't believe I'm actually getting to talk to you. Could I make a request of you? My brother and I both fell in love with your music on the show, so I was planning on getting a copy for him for his birthday. Is there any chance I could get you to sign the copy?

You should ask him again in Japanese. In case he misunderstood your question. 

My Japanese is very rusty, and was never that good to begin with, but something like  - ,

EDIT: Just to clarify for everybody - I have a degree in Japanese and Asian Studies. And Honors in Comparative Literature. And despite those qualifications not giving me a job, I feel confident enough having traveled through Japan at least seven times, and spoken many times with my English speaking Japanese friends, that often times they misunderstand my questions despite giving me an answer in (almost) perfect English. And often times I do the same in reverse. 

I only wished to help the guy who was a fan by suggesting that he might try asking in Japanese just to make sure there was no misunderstanding. The Japanese I posted, (roughly and not perfectly), said something along the lines of, "Just in case my question was not clear, would it be possible to get a signed album if I paid for postage as well. Thank you for considering it." All written in the polite form. (And I specifically avoided the past tense of the thank you as it would have implied pressure to accept the proposal.)

Google Translate's inability to translate this for some people who tried to check it gives me some hope there is a job for me out there somewhere.

~~You're not wrong man, you're just an asshole.~~  

Edit: having read your thorough explanation (albeit a little smug at the end)  I retract my statement.

how is he?

>> ARTICLE
What makes a person an asshole for translating something for you for free, just because he thought that your question was misunderstood. Also imo it's more polite to speak to someone in their native language in a situation like this
>> ARTICLE
nope, he's wrong too...
>> ARTICLE
Really he is, but the dude quote seemed so appropriate at the time
>> ARTICLE
Honestly curious as to what is so asshole-ish about this. Is it because he suggested that there might be a misunderstanding? Or because he suggested asking again?
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps it was a bit presumptuous?
>> ARTICLE
Its that he did it after it was abundantly clear that no misunderstanding took place.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's clear that he understood the basic idea, but he may have interpreted certain logistics of it in a different way.
>> ARTICLE
Still not approaching asshole.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was a misunderstanding, /u/thejellydude was talking about having a signed CD mailed to him while /u/agraphjp was thinking about meeting in person.

edit: Or maybe it was a misunderstanding in the other direction, and that was the polite way of saying "I don't have time to mail out signed records to fans, even if you pay for it".

Yes, looked like a misunderstanding of the question. The translation I thought was meant to be helpful. -130? Sad.

>> ARTICLE
Hi salty_d0ge,

I would suggest this: Nobody was implying ignorance on anyones part. But simply understanding what words mean what does not necessarily convey meaning. So just because the words were understood does not meaning the the entire statement was understood. Especially since there are cultural differences with these types of things.

For the record, I'm not the one who downvoted you, and I'm gonna upvote you back to 1. I also don't think anyone was really being passive aggressive.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I have to amend that second statement as well, same as I did to the first. The original fellow whom I was addressing gave a rather lengthy explanation, so I struck through my original post to him. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious, what exactly makes him an asshole?
>> ARTICLE
So I'm not the only one wondering where the -130 came from... I mean, I guess it could be somewhat rude, but it's not that bad.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah.. Not worth -144.. Here's what he said in Japanese (I used google translate) - If, my question is, was not clear, the album that signed Is it possible? I will be able to pay the postage. Thank you
>> ARTICLE
If google ever translates Japanese perfectly, it's not real Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
It sounded to me like the composer didn't understand the question. I thought the translation was helpful and not rude at all :(
>> ARTICLE
Why are you getting down voted? 
"My question might not been expressed correctly, is there a possibility of getting an album signed. I'll pay for the postage. Thank you"
>> ARTICLE
"Would you do this thing for me?"

"Sorry it would be too difficult to do that thing, but maybe someday I can do another thing"

"You didn't understand me. Please do the thing."

Is rude.
>> ARTICLE
Read the conversation again, please. Then you'll maybe catch the misunderstanding where the composer thinks that he wants to meet him anywhere to sign it personally. The demand was something else. Just to be clear on this. 
>> ARTICLE
This was not what I was saying at all. What you have said would sound rude in English, but that was not the conversation that was going on. 

I genuinely believe the guy might have misunderstood what was being asked of him. So I suggested a politely worded question in Japanese just to clarify if that was the case. I made sure to put absolutely no pressure on the guy he was asking. Please don't trust Google translate if that's what you're going by. See my edited response for the correct translation.

His response 'It is difficult' is so vague. In Japanese it could translate in to something like an awkward pause. This could have meant any number of things - That he thought he wanted him to sign it in person, that he didn't want to sign it at all, or that he thought he had to send out a free album, etc... 

Yes, your interpretation that the guy said it would be too difficult might be correct, but then he goes on to say "if there is a opportunity to have a event in US,please catch me :-)", so obviously he is not against the idea. Plus he doesn't capitalize the sentence and uses 'a event' not 'an event'. Not to pick on his English (because it's very good) but that suggested to me that his English is not perfect and that a misunderstanding of the original question may have occurred. 
>> ARTICLE
Google translate says that it is at least topically related and not offensive or about something completely different.

My favorite author, Isaac Asimov, would sign anything that was sent to him in a flat envelope with a prepaid return envelope.  He wouldn't sign books because they had to be taken to a post office and mailed, but a book jacket would always get signed.  Maybe you could send him the CD insert with a prepaid return envelope and just see?

If possible ask him if there's a studio or a manager you could address a letter to and send him a very plainly worded request reminding him of who you are and how much it would mean to your brother and that you provided an easy way to get it back to you.  I don't know, just thought I would share that it may be possible that way.

Yeah mine too. "Hero Appears! (5years remix)" is pretty awesome as well.

PingPongPhase2 is one of those that uses the sound of a ping pong ball as the basic beat. It's clever touches like that which make Ping Pong more polished, in its own way, than typical, high-budget series.

Speaking of the OST, is it going to be sold seperatly? I know it is bundled with the BR/DVD box set, but I can't exactly afford it or speak Japanese. If it gets a US release I'd be ecstatic, but I doubt it. So my best hope is for the OST to be sold separatly for a reasonable price that I can get shipped to the US.

Hmm...I don't think so? There's a decent chance that the anime will get a release from Funimation (although they still haven't released *The Tatami Galaxy* yet, just streaming it.) But the OST is unlikely.

Good ol' bahi JD. It's common for him to tweet something and then delete it. :P happened when he first announced that he will be working on pingpong and tweeted a photo of the first episode's storyboard cover page. For this, i think he said something about not having enough time in the production and it didn't make it into the final cut. He mentioned that "roughs are okay to show". Which means that these rough animations are actually done. Maybe they couldn't fit all the things he wanted to do into an episode. 
>> ARTICLE
What do you mean? The animation is great!

Just compare the gifs to the show. Of course there are parts of the show with very good animation, but it's not consistent.

It's the artists style probably. It's the exact same on The Tatami Galaxy.

The style doesn't look like Tatami Galaxy at all, it's a replication of Matsumoto's style from the Ping Pong manga.

I'm not saying the style in which they are drawn, just the style of animation. You can look at it and see that the same people who worked on Tatami Galaxy are working on this. It's honestly not that different.

An episode isn't animated by just one guy. An episode is split and they have numerous different artist working on different shots. There are bound to be inconsistencies. Just like space dandy.

If I remember right these were supposed to be in EP. 3 but were cut due to time. Bahi is good but he needs to stop being slow and git gud like [Hironori Tanaka] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9a2x-3IIc0) or [Teysuya Takeuchi] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4SekJXXhmo).

But it wasn't even the best anime of it's season - [Mushishi s2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21939/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou) was.


>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, you're very funny.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is an example of a fairly typical genre executing fantastically. I don't really agree with the people who say that it isn't like other sports anime - because it is. The same themes that permeate throughout Ping Pong - friendship, coming of age, etc - are hallmarks of the genre. The reason why Ping Pong feels so much more original than other sports anime is because of its execution - it's got great characters, great direction, and a memorable art style.

Mushishi, on the other hand, is Mushishi. There are few other shows like it - Natsume Yuujinchou being probably the closest thing there is. Each episode is capable of telling a different story with a different meaning (though some definitely to overlap). It really is one of the best explorations of human nature that I've seen in any form of art or literature.

Ultimately, of course, it comes down to personal preference. But hey, that's what all "best anime" lists are about. What you see as best reflects what you value. Since I personally am more attracted to Mushishi's exploration of human nature than I am Ping Pong's sports anime themes, I consider Mushishi Zoku Show to be my AOTS and potential AOTY.
>> ARTICLE
Except that the theme was that the game doesn't matter. If anything it was a sports anime subversion. The way it didn't even show the score of the final game, or the game itself to fully dive into the idea that we're just people, and the things we do should bring us together. It was taking the ideas of a standard sports anime and grounding them in reality, and exploring what they really mean. It's what Fullmetal did to shonen, and TWGOK did to harem. It's an interesting subversion plus all the direction, writing, and animation you mention.

I feel like you can't really nominate Mushishi S2, because it's just a steady continuation of S1, all the greatness, and awards should be put on the first season since the concept isn't getting any better. I would argue Kino's Journey, and Natsume are similar, and maybe go even as far to say it's spiritual ancestors are Golden Boy, and GTO. Where our hero faces a new situation, and set of characters each episode/arc and has to use his particular skills to help.
>> ARTICLE
>Ping Pong is the best anime of 2014, no other anime is even close, what a deep story line.

For future reference, when talking about inanimate (or not alive) nouns, you use non gender pronouns, (It, or they instead of he, or she). Also, assuming English isn't your first language, I would try and simplify your sentences, the more complicated you make them the more cluttered it becomes, the "i simply" and "can't catch" make the sentence difficult to read. The simpler it is, the more fluid or natural you can make it sound

Also 2014 isn't over yet, I wouldn't be 100% sure Ping Pong is the best, yet. We still have fall, and winter seasons, some cool shows are in the works, not to mention how great Terror in Resonance is so far.

English is a universal language because its parent culture is the most proliferated - colonization and sociocultural power are the causes for English being widespread, not ease of access.  English is a pretty unintuitive language for most foreigners and is chock-full of irregular conjugations.  In fact, your "teached" mistake highlights that perfectly - why is "taught" the past tense of "teach"?  "Teached" would make much more sense, no?  English is full of anomalies and exceptions; this makes it rich and beautiful, sure, but very difficult to learn.  A large part of that has to do with its origins as a hodgepodge of Germanic, Norse, Celtic, Greek, and Latin influences.

And anyway, lingual difficulty is not objective.  English is much easier for Dutch-speakers to learn than for Chinese-speakers, for example, because Dutch is far more etymologically related to English than Chinese.  [Relative comparisons](http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty) make more sense than blanket statements.
>> ARTICLE
Most languages have irregular conjugations and, more generally, exceptions to its rules. English is no different in that regard.

I would say English is very easy to start learning, specially if you already know how to write the alphabet. Then, depending on your experience with other languages (the relative comparisons bit you mention), it's probably medium to hard to achieve proficiency.

In any case, English grammar is as straightforward as that of other popular languages. What's not so simple about it are its pronunciation and its spelling. So getting to at least read it and understand it is a relatively quick feat. Then you can take advantage of that great, non-intrinsic characteristic of the English language: it's universal. People all over the world learn and teach it, you can find a plethora of movies, books, podcasts, internet videos and websites, subtitled works... that you won't be able to find, at least not the same amounts, in other languages.

For the record, I know three languages and plan to learn Japanese.
>> ARTICLE
I'd argue that English is a bit more grammatically messy than, say, the Romance languages, but hey, I'm no linguist.  And we agree on the overarching point that what's more important is where you're starting from - making the jump from Japanese to English is equally as difficult as English to Japanese.  Good luck on your studies!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like English is super hard to learn, its so situational. I hear all the time how hard it is. And I'm pretty sure its a universal language because of America's scientific, military, and economic dominance, as well as US/UK imperialism.

To be honest, if you weren't into it by episode 4, that probably won't change - as much as I loved Ping Pong, it might just not be for you.  Maybe come back to it later if you feel up for it and see if you get used to the animation/art style.  Did you enjoy the story and the characters and it was just the animation that put you off?  Or were you just lukewarm on the entire thing?

The strength in Ping Pong is it's character development. Episode 4 I believe is just after the first Nationals tournament? If so, shit only really starts hitting the fan and characters start really getting explored after that.

If you think it was just a "sports hero" anime with "boss of the week" episodes, I encourage you to have a relook. 

| I just didnt connect enough with the MC

You might realise that there isn't strictly a main character at all. Its a story about different people. 

The art style stays the same and pretty consistent throughout so if that is your major gripe with it, perhaps you might be interested in the live-action movie instead.

Hmm, I can kinda see why you would think that, the second series has much less action initially, and focuses more on the friendship of the characters, instead of killing them off repeatedly like season 1. Maybe you liked that more, I don't know. But goddamn, the ending of the last arc is so, by Higurashi standards, simply epic.

It's the only show i've dropped so far... i'm probably going to finish it at some point but maybe someone can convince me. Personally I couldn't find a single thing to like in it, the dialogue, characters and story just were awkward and made me uncomfortable. OST, animation, art design were bland. Help! Everyone seemed to enjoy this show or put it on the same level as Toradora.
>> ARTICLE
Golden times plot is very weak. If you want to continue it, you have to get used to the characters continually overdramatizing things and getting mad at each other for silly reasons. It can't compare to a show like Toradora, or many other top tier romance drama/comedies in terms of plot.

It sounds like I don't want to continue it  :) thanks

I was the same at the start, hated the 2 mcs because they displayed the traits of people I knew and got pissed off by in university (seriously clingy/ stalker girls, I aint having none of that shit, and house mate who decided to spend the rest of the year with afformentioned stalker girl, y u make things uncomfortable?) The latter half is definitely more enjoyable, and worth experiencing but I wouldn't put it up with Toradora! personally.

Fairy Tail. You can't do it can you?
>> ARTICLE
It's just one of those I watch now with my brain off and predicting everything and seeing how right I am. I'm spot on for 5 episodes straight now. I'm still watching it, but once the current arc ends it's probably gonna join the drop club because Tartaros was the only thing I was hyped for.
>> ARTICLE
This is my only dropped anime. That and naruto because I finished the manga and only watch the big fight scenes.
>> ARTICLE
It's good at first, but it gets so formulaic. I stuck around long enough for the magic games arc, but after that it just all went to shit, at least for me. I'm not a critical watcher, but when every arc feels the same, it doesn't take a critical watcher to know that something's not right. 

Also the animation is sub-par. 
>> ARTICLE
A lot of of fairy tail isn't even animated its just still images with graphical fire effects.
>> ARTICLE
:l I dropped it too. 
>> ARTICLE
Curious: Why *did* you drop it. Because I dropped it too.
>> ARTICLE
Well I dropped it while only the first season was out. It started off very promising. And then... The same things kept happening. Girl gets kidnapped, MC saves her. He uses the same attack to end every fight, and it just got old. I hear season 2 is better but I'm not gonna watch it in the near future. 
>> ARTICLE
I know exactly what you mean. It does get better but my question would be how slow does it have to be before it finally has an actual plot? I dropped t after episode- what? Definitely beyond season 3. 
>> ARTICLE
Slow pacing has never really been much of a problem for me. I didn't really get into One Piece until episode 20. I didn't like the beginning arcs. I just don't like every arc to follow the same format, unless it's gonna show me some cool power ups. 
>> ARTICLE
Fairy Tail is like a lovechild between Naruto and Dragonball Z. Problem is... it's too damn predictable. I was actually too- intoxicated to realize that. And I don't mean intoxicated as in drunk, I mean I was too engrossed. I liked the world it took place in. I watched it, got really into it, enjoyed it and when I spent three days away from it, I slowly realized how bad it was.

Predictable

Death is cheap if it's even existent.

No real main villain until far in, after a clumsily done time skip. 

Like I said, clumsy time skip. Kind of useless really. I dropped it after that.
>> ARTICLE
Im sorry but how does Kaiji or Ping pong have bad animation?
>> ARTICLE
The animator of Ping Pong is known for making frequent creative use of off model animation. Some (boring) people see that and think it's bad because everything isn't on model.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're bad. But it's a popular opinion. The only show that I haven't been able to watch because of the art is God Eater. God it's so weird.

I dropped God Eater because it's boring as shit, not because of the animation.

God Eater looks amazing. I love the look it has.

Bakumatsu Rock is TTGL and Free!'s pop-obsessed lovechild.  Get through the bit where they have a concert in fundoshis in the middle of an onsen (ep 3 iirc) before you make the decision to drop.

Terra Formars can be fun if you want to see people beating the shit out of giant bug people.

World Trigger is actually pretty good. I think for the first 8 episodes it's pretty mediocre, but after that it manages to right itself. If you prefer, you could read it and it's actually a pretty great shounen focusing less on 'MAH POWERLEVELS' and more on tactics and strategy. If you want to skip those episodes, you could sail the high seas and read up until volume 2 ends and start around episode 9. More or less.

If you watch one of these then I will be your friend.

I have enough shit to deal with with my current circle of friends, thanks.

While I'm not gonna say that you should finish Mahouka, I think that you should at least finish the arc that you're on. The show got bad ratings because the first arc was absolutely horrible, but the second one is pretty cool in my opinion. I just love how OP Tatsuya is. 

The writers made a mistake by trying to give everything an explanation, as if it actually made any sense. They tried to mix science with magic and made the whole anime a chore to understand. But the fight scenes are cool
>> ARTICLE
The irregular at magic high school is the most watchable show on that list. But if it's not for you, it's really not for you. 

I enjoy "Badass saves the day" and found the magic system interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
As nerdy as it is, their take on the whole magic system was one of my favorite things, plus the raw bad ass of Tatsuya.
>> ARTICLE
I'll pass the gilding. No human should be forced to watch most of those things against their will.
>> ARTICLE
I'll give a shot at some:

Motomete is the poor man's Steins;Gate. While a few episodes focusing on the characters whose route are not the focus are a bit out of place, it's an enjoyable story overall. While not an amazing series I think it's worth watching.

Mahouka and Terra Formars are weird cases. They are amazing to watch while airing, joining the discussions and laughing at the Magical Jesus and censorship festival respectively but now? My only argument is that both series are likely getting a S2 and watching the first season to be able to join the S2 live discussions might be worth it.

Now for the big one, Military!. Find the version subbed by Mori and watch that one and check the alternative subs. If that doesn't get you to watch it, nothing will.
>> ARTICLE
Wait... Mori subbed Military? Goddamn it, I'm calling technical foul on the grounds that it's not originally part of the show.

The others I'm still not convinced about, but I will check out the subs for Military and just watch it that way. Give me a while and you're getting gold.
>> ARTICLE
Well if you force yourself through at least one of them, imagine how much more you'll enjoy a good anime in comparison.

You'd put yourself in a "There's no way to go but up" situation.
>> ARTICLE
I've just never approached media that way. I can appreciate high quality shows just fine without watching bad ones, so there's no reason for me to watch things I don't enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
It was mostly a joke. I don't ever watch something intentionally bad either, unless it's really short(Mars of Destruction) so that it's not complete torture.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped GATE after three episodes. It was going slow for me and the premise wasn't all that interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I really can't say much about this anime, but I love it. It's a great anime in my opinion, but it doesn't get too much love from others. And I got super downvoted on like 5 comments trying to defend it the other day. I honestly think that the first 4 episodes are pretty weak, I even dropped it when it first aired in the middle if the second episode. By episode 5 and especially 6, I was ready to jump into that world. 

Just know that you have not witnessed the full glory of Rory Mercury -  Best girl of the season. 

In terms of pacing, I'd compare it to a roller coaster; some episodes are really intense, then it'll go back to being what others would call dull (politics basically). I just really love world building anime, and this one has a good mix of action as well. 
>> ARTICLE
> It's a great anime in my opinion, but it doesn't get too much love from others.

wat. It regularly gets >500 comments on each episode discussion thread. It's one of the most looked-forward-to shows on this subreddit. 

Also, it looks like the reason you got downmodded for defending the show was because you claimed it wasn't completely one-sided. GATE has many things - balanced fights are not one of them.
>> ARTICLE
It's 24 minute installments of JSDF auto fellatio 
>> ARTICLE
I won't say the manga is better (as I haven't really seen the anime), but I might suggest reading the manga for this type of series. I tend to find that unless it's just a particularly great adaptation, these kind of obviously dumb, power-fantasy type series are far more enjoyable in manga form as you can pace them however you please.
>> ARTICLE
It helps if youre in the military in real life. I am in the Canadian Forces, and all the little details, from the weapons, tactics, dress regulations, even sitting on your helmet in a helicopter so you dont get your balls blown off, just makes the whole thing sugar coated for me.
>> ARTICLE
It didn't get better. In fact, it got worst. There is no real plot and the entire premise revolves around "Omg medieval characters exposed to modern Japan" and "the JSDF is the best and everyone else is evil".
>> ARTICLE
If only it had been set in America. We woulda nuked the shit outta that portal before you could say "Rory best girl."
>> ARTICLE
Nah man if it happened in the US we would have sent an army in taken the capital by the end of day 1 and demanded unconditional surrender along with access to all natural resources.
>> ARTICLE
It's pure fantasy fulfilment. If you don't enjoy watching medieval armies get curb stomped by modern military then it's probably not for you. 
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Clannad after 4 episodes because the characters were all awful and the character designs were atrocious. Tell me why I'm wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Because Clannad isn't out to look pretty.

Also because the first four episodes are slow as all hell. Everyone knows that. Even when you get into actual story, it's only mediocre. Pretty good, but nothing amazing. 

Then you start After Story. I can't explain why After Story is good without spoiling it. The best I can do is tell you that it's all worth it. The reason there's a season of normal stuff like that is to build the characters. It takes a while, yes, but it is worth every second.
>> ARTICLE
I'm generally one to say that early portions of a series are basically always indicative of the overall quality - it's not like the creators are suddenly going to become good at what they do if they weren't originally. There might be variance, but nothing to the extent some people seem to indicate. 

Clannad is probably the largest exception to that rule. About 30 episodes into the series (both seasons) the series suddenly becomes ridiculously better than it was previously. Those first 30 episodes are really mediocre overall (generally just very generic and poorly executed - even outright terrible at points, but with some surprisingly decent portions generally stemming from the romance aspect). Past that point though, the character writing suddenly becomes much stronger and the series games some really great thematic focus, allowing the drama and just about everything else to actually work incredibly well. You get about a 12-13 episode section of legitimately fantastic storytelling. And then the ending happens and it completely destroys any thematic coherence the show had. 

I'd really recommend putting in the time to watch the series because the great section really is fantastic, but it's completely understandable to not want to spend that much time sitting through the crappier portions.
>> ARTICLE
You really have to like slice of life shows to like Clannad. Slice of Life tends to be a bit dry at times, and characters have very very exaggerated personality types. 

It's a show you can't expect much beyond a feels trip. 
>> ARTICLE
The comedic wiring gets pretty good as the series goes on,  and some characters (particularly Tomoya) gain depth with progression. 
>> ARTICLE
If nothing else, you need to watch just to see why people recommend it.

it, evangelion, and Madoka are kind of just shows you have to see.

like reading shakespeare.
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't agree more. Was really put off by Madoka at first, but after a few episodes it got me hooked. The art style and animation were afterthoughts to the story being told.
>> ARTICLE
The art is fantastic in Madoka. I admit the main series had some QUALITY moments, but all the movies (especially Rebellion) were absolute eye candy.
>> ARTICLE
If you watch the BD versions of the series the animation and art is all great as well. Not quite movie level from a technical standpoint, but still fantastic (hell I'd argue the presentation is better overall).
>> ARTICLE
Haven't watched the movies, but for me the style of the show was something I had to get used to. It was really good and amazing work, just wasn't something I was used to, so it took me by surprise.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. The Witches do have this creepy storybook vibe for their art, and that's something that was a little weird at first.
>> ARTICLE
I actually found that to be the most interesting part of the art style of the show. It really broke away from what you expect and it was really unique for an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Not really sure Clannad belongs in, or honestly even close to that tier. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen After Story?
>> ARTICLE
Have you read shakespeare? 

Sure Clannad is great and all, but do you really think it matches up to literature that has survived hundreds of years? 
>> ARTICLE
I have read shakespeare.

Survival doesn't necessarily mean it's great.
>> ARTICLE
But it's survived for a reason. Just because you didn't like it, doesn't make it any less of a substantial piece of work. 


>> ARTICLE
Hence why I was recommending Clannad.
>> ARTICLE
The first ~12 episodes of Clannad are so boring, I also dropped it at around episode 8 then forced myself to watch and at ~15th episode it becomes really good. It's one of those series that you force yourself to watch until the interesting stuff starts to happen. Believe me, all that silly and even cringey stuff that happens in the first episodes goes away later on.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad starts weak and steadily improves on and on as it goes.  

It is the like, the Dratini of anime.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is a tough one. It's not for everybody, and the first season can definitely feel slow at times. For me, I remember not liking the characters and the design at the start as well, but I ended up forgetting all about it after 6 or 7 episodes. Do you normally watch slice of life shows? I think to watch Clannad you need to just relax and go with it, and not think too hard about the little details. 

Anyway, pretty much everyone will agree that making it through After Story is completely worth it, whether or not you liked the first part of the story. It's some of the best character and story development in existence.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've heard a lot of people saying they didn't like the first season but that After Story was one of their favourites, so I know I'll have to get through series at some point. I like Slice of Life, so maybe I'll have to approach it with a different mindset and just power through it.
>> ARTICLE
**Highschool DxD BorN**

I used to love the earlier installments of this series, but for some reason it just lost its charm to me. Maybe I've been jaded from watching too much anime, but I can't really say that when I'm having a blast watching Okusama ga Seitokaichou and MonMusu.

Maybe because it had too much actual plot? I don't really know. I heard that it goes way out of line when it comes to silliness too, something akin to Seikon no Qwaser.
>> ARTICLE
It's not a good season overall. Definitely watch it if they announce a season 4, but if they don't it's ok for you not to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Born attempted to adapt volumes 5,6 and 7 instead of the usual 2 volumes per season as before. This resulted in the other half ( and non training point of the entire volume) of volume 5 being completely removed, and replaced for the anime original own arc (which has left me refusing to see the last episode) taking place after both the other volumes which are also underdeveloped and slightly altered to fit the time restraints.

This resulted in the season being more plot driven and less classic ecchi fun mixed in as before, yet the plot focus is under developed resulting in this season being atleast in my opinion generally worse than the others.


 However if they faithfully adapt what should be next season, it will probably be the greatest DxD season made.I don't know at what point you dropped this season but the end of episode 9 finishes the original material for the season.
>> ARTICLE
SAO II
>> ARTICLE
SAO's just one of those series where people seem to love it or hate it.

There are 3 arcs in SAO II; 2 main and 1 short one. The final arc is Mother's Rosario, the one everyone's been raving about. It has a completely different feel/atmosphere compared to the rest of SAO, and isn't focused on the adventures of Kirito. 

Phantom Bullet/Gun Gale Online is alright. The big turn off (or turn on for some people) is the fanservicey parts of Sinon, but she's a great character overall. It wasn't my favorite arc. There are 3 episodes for the Calibur arc; it's a very chill casual arc about friends playing video games where no one's life is on the line, so it brings down the tension. After all, teenagers in a modern setting can't be expected to fight death over and over again, right?^jk

Overall, SAO II might just not be your thing. If you tell us why you dropped it, maybe we can get some better insight.
>> ARTICLE
Gun Game online was probably my second favorite part about that anime. If anything, at least watch that. 
>> ARTICLE
GGO was great, I kinda stopped following SAO 2 after it and only finished it after it finished airing. Honestly Mother's Rosario was not as good as everyone touted it as.
>> ARTICLE
GGO was definitely the best arc of S2. 

I get the feeling that people really liked Mother's Rosario in the LN (I did not read it myself), and then liked the anime adaptation by association. I mean, the discussion threads were always talking about how sad every episode was, but I couldn't bring myself to care about someone we just met. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked Mother Rosario arc, GGO was an okay arc at the beginning and then got kinda better. I finished it for the sake of finishing it. Now, I watch the first arc and pretend it ended after that. Like Star Wars, in my head there is only 3.
>> ARTICLE
-Monster: I stopped at like episode 32 because the pacing was soooooo slow. I might pick it back up later or just read the manga instead.

-Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai- This was season 2 of Higurashi. I think I got to like episode 5 or 6, then dropped it because it just got too boring and I really didn't like any of the characters.
>> ARTICLE
You'd probably be fine reading the manga for Monster if pacing is a problem for you. I thought the pacing was great but then again I binged watched most of it in a few days...

>> ARTICLE
The first arc of Kai(which is 1-5) is a filler chapter that didn't exist in the VN. It's there to fill in gaps left by the adaptation of season one and pad out the season. Literally the next episode goes into the start of the finale(Minagoroshi) and starts explaining a lot of the unanswered stuff. If you don't like the characters by that point, fair enough, because a lot of the reason Higurashi works is because the characters are so likable, but otherwise, stick with it a little longer and the loose ends will start tying up.
>> ARTICLE
I would love to tell you to continue Monster, but it really is a show that burns a little too slowly.  As twisted as Johan Liebert is, the show can never make him twisted enough to compensate for how much time is spent telling you how twisted he is.

But it seems you made it pretty far, it feels like a waste to not finish it.
>> ARTICLE
Bleach
>> ARTICLE
What episode did you drop it on? If you haven't gotten past the first season, keep watching. This show is like the ultimate shounen. It just gets crazier and crazier. And the Soul Society arc is one of my favorite arcs in all of anime. I'd just so intense and badass. And every character is badass in their own way. Plus the fight scenes and power ups are pretty damn cool. 
>> ARTICLE
http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/bleach

Skip the filler and it gets a bit easier. However the ordering for the arcs is just downright horrible. Namely the whole Aizen arc pretty much ruined all build up by sticking sequel arcs in the middle of it.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped season 2 of K-on! halfway through because I got bored of it. 



>> ARTICLE
i dropped k-on on episode 4.

it was the episode where they were literally counting cars the entire episode.
>> ARTICLE
My whole beef with K-On (and it's a filet fucking mignon) is that it never made an attempt to have its "precious moments" mean something. There was never any sense that these characters were going to grow and learn, they were offered no challenge. At the end of the show, we find out they're all going to the same fucking college, to do the same pointless shit they've always done? Talk about being held the fuck down! We enjoy the little things because they're so easy to miss among the big fucking shit that life slings at us. What the hell am I going to do with the rest of my life? When do I look in the mirror and see an adult instead of a child? The world is changing around me, what do I have to do to keep up, to not be left behind? These are the questions that make us give a shit about characters, and K-On tells us that it's okay to be complacent, you don't have to change or leave your friends or try to make yourself better. Life is an adventure that kicks your ass through the mud and the rain and you come out stronger for every inch you claw and scratch for. K-On wants to sit inside where it's comfortable and drink tea and eat cakes and pretend to play music and pretend that it's all okay.

TL;DR I hate escapism. You mustn't run away. 
>> ARTICLE
do you have more rants or a youtube channel?
>> ARTICLE
Have you even watched the show? Each character experiences growth, the series just never deliberately tells you "this character made that experience", and yet it's clearly noticeable through their actions. 
>> ARTICLE
So you watched 20 something episodes of K-On and now you got bored of it?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. It was a slog to get to their. I just lost intrest and never finished it.

I dropped Plastic Memories at episode 2. None of the characters seemed interesting at that point. The drama felt very forced and I did not find the comic relief very funny.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped at 7. It doesn't get better.  
>> ARTICLE
The first episode was awesome. The last episode was awesome. Everything in between is irredeemable garbage. Huge waste of potential.
>> ARTICLE
Only garbage if you didn't enjoy the romance, like I did. 
>> ARTICLE
Aw man, all these people saying it doesn't get better make me sad.  I loved Plastic Memories and have no regrets about watching all the way through.  If you don't like predictable romance or melodrama then stay away but if you do then pick it back up.  Character development is decent, not great, the romance is sweet, and the ending is great.  
>> ARTICLE
It is super predictable, just need to shut your mind off and enjoy it. Remember we watch anime for enjoyment not to review it like it is our job
>> ARTICLE
If a series is of poor quality why not just drop it and watch something better? There's no reason to suffer through a series that you have gripes with when there is likely a ton of exceptional anime you haven't watched yet. Like you said, it's not our job to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just saying thats what I generally do and it leads to me enjoying most animes. Obviously you don't force yourself to watch an entire series if you don't want to. 
>> ARTICLE
Do whatever works for you. I used to watch anime a lot more liberally and only drop series I strongly didn't like. I found I started enjoying the medium a lot more when i just dropped every series that didn't consistently impress me or at least manage to be very enjoyable. I just filled the time I was watching the dropped series with stuff from my PTW list and watched a higher caliber of anime overall.
>> ARTICLE
Only watch this anime if you don't think too much about why things are the way they are. Just accept the premise and the things shown. 
Don't try to ask why too much and you might enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
Good call mate, just keep it that way.

I'd rather they just deployed some guys in funeral black suits that would throw onions at my face while playing sad violin music instead of this forced drama about androids :|
>> ARTICLE
I stopped watching after episode 5. Same reasons as you, the characters weren't interesting and I didn't feel for any of them at all. It doesn't get any better after that. Only reason I continued after the second episode was because people kept saying they were crying after every episode but I didn't feel shit, not even a little bit sad.

Trigun

Dropped after 3 episodes because it was too goofy
>> ARTICLE
Give it a few more episodes. I was feeling the same when i watched it, but it just starts to grow on you, and it changes to get way better after a while.

The first few episodes are really only there to get you used to the characters imo, they start worldbuilding and developing backstory after that and it gets great.
>> ARTICLE
It changes tone a little bit before the halfway point as we learn more about Vash.
>> ARTICLE
How drastically? Maybe more like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly?
>> ARTICLE
It's never quite that grim, but Trigun really does go back to its gritty Western gunslinger roots when you are introduced to a group of characters called the Gung-Ho Guns, who more or less live to make Vash's life a living hell.  

Early Trigun is designed to rope you in with a deceptively light-hearted tone and deliberately pull the wool over your eyes about how much trouble Vash is really in.

* TTGL - I dropped it on episode 13. I didn't care for any of the characters. I heard that [](/s "there's a Tim skip and that Simon turns into another Kamina and I hated Kamina. I know that the white haired girl dies, Yoko becomes a teacher I think and everyone ends up miserable and alone. I also hear that Kamina makes some kind of spiritual appearance towards the end.") 

* Ao Haru Ride - I disliked the main guy. 

* Bokura ga Ita - same as Ao Haru Ride-.

* Hanasaku Iroha - I hated every single character especially the main girl, I disliked her personality.

* Sayounara Zetsubo Sensei - I didn't like Kafuka's personality and the humor didn't do anything for me.

I figured I'd also post my [dropped list](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Unorthodox_&status=4) just in case there's something else worth picking up again.

Durarara!! on episode 8. 

Not enough action, story and characters were spread thin. That was tolerable, but what made me drop it was a love interest character was introduced, and I hate romance so I dropped it.

>> ARTICLE
There isn't really that much romance in Durarara and soon the action will start picking up.
>> ARTICLE
I guess it's all about point of view. I personally love seeing all the different kinds of love that series shows :p
>> ARTICLE
I also enjoy that part of Durarara, but it never really felt like it's a big enough part of the anime to the point where you can drop it, because you don't like romance. Romance in Durarara is like a side thing going on.
>> ARTICLE
If he said romance wasn't his thing I'd agree but the fact he said that he **hates** romance makes me worried to push it.

If he truly hates romance then yeah, I just don't really take that word seriously, because I feel like people don't really mean it.

Ah I personally try to only use it for when it really applies but yeah others have definitely sensationalized it.

That's pretty fucking hillarious considering how much hate Brotherhood gets on /a/ for having a too fast paced beginning compared to the 2003 series.

Once you meet the main enemies of the series, the show really picks up. Some of the fight scenes are really badass, and the show doesn't focus on the main 2 characters, so everyone gets a chance to be badass.  Plus episode #1 is filler if you didn't know.

Horizon in the middle of nowhere. Tried to give it a chance but found it to be a confusing mess.

Ok, so when I name the Anime, I'm likely going to get shot. *takes deep breath.*

Cowboy Bebop. I dropped it after fifteen or so episodes and then my cousin and brother convinced me it was worth watching so... I watched it. I like it better now but still, I prefer Kino's Journey honestly (which was recommended to me after I finished Cowboy Bebop.)

As for Anime I dropped and never watched again. You can try convincing me to watch Gurren Laggan. That's the only one I can think of. Dragonball Z could also count but I don't think I'm interested in that. Gurren Laggan. If you've seen it, convince me. But... I need to know *why* I should watch it. Because I also have a prejudice against superpowered demigods or giant robots duking it out with each other.

Eureka Seven at episode 12. It seemed so recycled, kid falls, blue haired chick saves him, he throws up, kids beat him up. The animation even started to stagnate a bit.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a few years since I finished Eureka 7, but from what I remember Renton does get better. His failing is still kind of a thing iirc. The animation imo gets better as you get closer to the end.
>> ARTICLE
Eureka seven has a painfully slow build, but it's got it's moments when things finally start to pick up
>> ARTICLE
I would say that the first 12 or so episodes are definitely the worst of the series. That being said the character development starts to happen shortly afterward and doesn't keep following the formula they used in the episodic episodes. Also after episode 15 it stops becoming episodic type thing and the animation starts to pick back up aroudn then as well. 
>> ARTICLE
One Piece halfway through the first episode :p
>> ARTICLE
The first 3-4 arcs are the weakest in One piece. I dropped them so many times that I think I've seen these arcs 3 or 4 times each before I made it passed it. Those arcs introduce the characters and their back stories, which honestly wasn't that interesting until Nami's arc. I hate Usopp and I hate his arc and I think Buggy the Clown is a total joke character, but the series does get a lot better and more serious. 

The art style at the beginning is weird, but you get used to it. And it totally gets updated and changes for the better at one point. 

The world building is great and there are so many unique powers. Some are incredibly OP and others are incredibly dumb, but it really depends on how the user uses it. 

It's a classic Shonen, so you'll see the main characters get beat up *a lot*, but the fight scenes are pretty damn cool. I suggest you try to marathon until you get  to Sanji's arc (episode 20), because that's where it really starts to pick up. 

SKIP THE FILLER. It's incredible how bad it is.

Hyouka, half way past season 1. I liked the characters and the actual animation, I found the subjects of the mysteries very mundane and it bored me too much. 
>> ARTICLE
Same, I started watching it. For some reason or another got distracted and just never had enough desire to finish it. 
>> ARTICLE
>  it bored me too much.

Hyouka is a show about boredom and how the show gets more and more 'interesting'. Invest all your attention in the characters and it's a blast.

Watch it to the end and then you'll understand why you were right to feel 'bored' by the mysteries, but wrong to give the show up based on them. It's quite a meta show.

I dropped Gurren Lagen, but on episode 22 so there's probably nothing you can say to convince me to continue. I only made it that far on hope alone.

>episode 22

Are you me? Because that's around where I dropped. I plan to finish when I'm in the right mood, though. Maybe some liquor to dull the brain.

I had brought it up in a similar thread a while back. Someone who had his own complaints of Gurren Lagann suggested finishing, not that I'd love it, but supposedly not horribly painful.

Yea if you can get past episode 8 and still hate it, its not for you. I can't believe you made it all the way to 22 though then stopped.

episode 8? i dropped it around 3 because i just found it FAR, FAR, FAR too episodic and the whole over the top "FRIENDSHIP! THE POWER IS WITHIN YOU" shit drove me up the walls with my groaning.

does it get any different? i MAY be able to stomach it for a few more episodes if it does.
>> ARTICLE
It stops being episodic soon after that, and while the whole BE BADASS AND JUST GET STRONGER vibe never really subsides, I will say the show gets darker and more intelligent to an extent later on. Especially the second half, it has a very different tone.

Watch until episode 8, then decide.

You can't drop Gurran Lagann until you have at least reached episode 8.

Man, I'll forgive you for saying all those offensive things if you watch JoJo until Battle Tendency. You seriously just summarized one of the greatest anime in existence as "big muscley men striking poses" and "vampires, ew".

I was the same way. It had been recommended to me so many times but I just couldn't get past the first few episodes. What finally did it was a friend who told me this: "Texhnolyze has a depressing ending. The most depressing ending I've seen in an anime. Or a manga, or a movie or a book. Actually, it might be the most depressing ending that's conceivably possible."

I finished it driven by pure curiosity.

He was right.

TTGL around episode 10. Found it boring, could not stand the lack of explanation for most of the stuff they were showing, hated Kamina from the very beginning. ; it's nor for me. If you are able to make me watch it to the end, I guess you have some sort of magic powers or something.

I can't make you watch it, because I don't like the series either. I never really understood all the hype it get in /r/anime

I think its one of those shows that if you let it immerse you in its world its really hype and gives you a lot of feel-good moments of being powerful and everyone can do it attitude.

I dropped Code Geass at about episode 13.  It bored me and I felt like I was forcing myself to watch it.

Cowboy Bebop.

Every chapter was the same, it feels formulaic and plot less.

I dropped Hibike! Euphonium around episode 6. I didn't really understand what the big deal was. A lot of the characters seemed very dull and boring, (I hated Kumiko with a passion) even [best grill](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e3/99/3a/e3993ad6c294de6384a5d736e7e1c6d8.gif) wasn't that enticing. Also I wasn't a massive fan of the art style.

Dropped because the show seemed more like a chore to figure out what everyone liked about it.
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, part of what makes the characters seem dull or boring is that they are much more understated(or normal) compared to a lot of other anime.  There's no extremely outrageous personalities, no mecha fights, no heavy supernatural drama.  Its an anime that often  favors realism instead of epicness and not everyone enjoys that.

Personally, i loved how the anime had lots of care put into pretty much every moment, down to even the most minor details of background scenes, and how Kumiko acts more like a normal high school student instead of an anime high school student (monosyllabic at home, often unsure of her own motivations).

Frankly that's true for the first two cours... "Hunter Vocabulary", ffs... And don't get me started on the recap episodes.

Madoka Magica. 

I have watched two of the episodes and I dislike the setting and the characters. Watching a show about little girls does not interest me at all.

And yes, I know that there it supposedly gets darker later on, but I have attempted to pick it back up twice and failed to make it more than a few minutes into an episode.

Tell me why I should try watching it again without simply saying "it gets much darker" or "you should watch at least three episodes".
>> ARTICLE
Well honestly man the only thing I can tell you is to look forward to the better episodes. It starts a little bit in episode 3. 

I enjoyed the series. It was a complete mind fuck by the end. 
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Fate/Zero after like 4 episodes. The characters seemed really angsty and the dialogue made me cringe a little bit. I've been in the mood to watch a really good show lately, so if someone can convince me otherwise I'd seriously give it another go. What am I missing?
>> ARTICLE
F/Z is a dark action show that looks amazing and has a great soundtrack. I thought it started slow but the second half was more interesting plot wise and more engaging pacing wise.

That said, I still didn't like the show that much and I completely agree with what you said about the characters and dialogue. So continue if you want to see cool action and/or see shit get real. 
>> ARTICLE
How did you drop it in the middle of the first fight of the series? 

If you like flashy fights with a good story, this is your anime. Episode 4 is a lot of talking, and honestly Saber is far from my favorite character as she can get pretty annoying (I actually really liked her in Unlimited Blade Works). But God, the other characters are so great. Gilgamesh looking down on everyone as subhuman, Rider being made of pure testosterone, Lancer being such a great bro, and Caster just being insane. And contrary to what most people on this sub say, I don't think Fate/Zero should be watched first (I'm not sure of  you've read the LN, or watched any of the other series), I would start with UBW. This anime can be pretty confusing at first and it's almost a chore getting through those first few episodes if you don't have any background on what the Holy War is. Otherwise, I'd say stick it out. If you're not hooked after seeing episode 11, then I would go ahead and drop the show. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for this! I tend to enjoy shows with more of a build up and characterization, so perhaps starting with UBW will get me invested in the characters enough to enjoy Fate/Zero. I hadn't seen or read anything about the Fate series before, so I'll take your word for it.
>> ARTICLE
>  I hadn't seen or read anything about the Fate series before

Yep. That right there was your mistake. Not that you'll be seeing too many of the same characters necessarily, but it does provide crucial context and dramatic irony.

It's like trying to watch the Star Wars prequels without having seen the original trilogy, except if the Star Wars prequels were really good.

(also read the VN)
>> ARTICLE
I didn't drop it *per se* but have been dragging my feet a lot to go back to it.

**.Hack//sign.**

Why: It's not all that old but the animation and art are pretty terrible. I like the soundtrack a lot, and the MC is okay, but I just couldn't really find anything that made me want to keep watching.

Did you like watching the original Evangelion? It's kinda like that in a way. Kinda avant garde for anime. It tries a bit too hard to be physiological and "deep". Now that I think about it, I only watched that and Evangelion because I was an edgy teenager when they both came out.

Shimoneta is pretty dumb, but once shit hits the wall in episode 4, I got hooked. If you like yanderes I'd suggest that you keep watching it, but the humor isn't for everyone. I think that the jokes are pretty shitty to be honest especially since I'm watching a censored version. There are some scenes that are insanely funny though. 
>> ARTICLE
I initially held off because parody shows tend to rely on one gimmick for 12 episodes, but Shimoneta is solid. It's actually created a dystopian story with actual progression, albeit absurd. I'm not caught up yet so I can only speak up to ep 6.

Frankly it's only funny because it's censored. Like a buzzing sound in place of "vibrator".

I can see that it was one of the more middling episodes and the costumes weren't doing the show too many favors. But, you should give episodes 3 and 4 a watch cause those two episodes tell you what the show is about a quirky, occasionally bleak adventure focusing on the meaning and power of family.

So I read the beginning of the Chobits manga at a relative's house a while back, and enjoyed what I managed to get through in that short time. Recently, I was searching for an anime to watch, and wondered if it had been adapted into a show yet. It had, way back in 2002! Anyway, I began watching, loving the opening and the characters. However, about twelve or thirteen episodes in, I eventually lost interest at some of the more slow-paced parts. I haven't resumed it for a couple weeks now.

I tried really hard to like Yuki Yuna. So, I'd be fine with someone trying to sell the show to me.

What ep did you stop at? I think it only really picks up at 9+.
>> ARTICLE
My thing about Yuki Yuna is, ignoring the fact that I'm extremely biased, I feel like Yuki Yuna is one that gets a lot better as it goes on. The show has a certain way of guiding your expectations, then twisting and shaping those expectations. The characters were all really likable for me and each one had really interesting and deep character development, while also featuring some of my favorite fight scenes from any show. The soundtrack grows on you as it goes on, I feel, and after they warm into the roles, the voice cast delivers some of the best raw emotion I've heard in any show.

I hope this helped to maybe convince you to give YuYuYu another chance. If you want me to say anything else about the show, please ask!

For me personally, I saw a lot of what Tomoko was dealing with as problems I dealt with in High School and could relate to her struggles(even if her social anxiety is far worse than mine ever was). That said, while I think you're supposed to sympathize with her, she's kind of like classic Seinfeld or IASIP where she's a jerkass and part of the humor is supposed to come from her not dealing with her problems. I can easily see why someone could not like the show--it is still the only show where I had to step away due to the sheer awkwardness of some of the moments, though.

Alright the first arc sucks and is definitely the worst of the series. I'm gonna copy paste sone thing I typed earlier. 

All I need to say is [Misaka mutha fuckin Mikoto](https://youtube.com/watch?v=MHW3TvCVeq4) 

The thing about Index is that it has Magical arcs and Science arcs. The Science side is soooo much better. I felt like I had to force myself. To watch the magic side; I just didn't like them. And it rotates between them. The unfortunate thing is that the magic side seemed to always last longer than the science. But this show has one of the best antagonists of all anime - Accelerator.


There's a spin off called A Certain Scientific Railgun where the main character is Misaka Mikoto (The 5th most powerful person in the city). It's a lot more light hearted than Index, but it's all science, so I actually enjoyed it more.

It does start out pretty episodic, but there's an overarching plot which is currently in full swing, and even the early episodes are actually kinda relevant to what's happening now.

Believe it or not, To LOVE Ru. Friend gave me the entire first and second season, and Darkness. I tried so hard to watch it in the beginning then I just gave up. I couldn't for some odd reason. Must have been the animation or just how dated it looked.

If anybody wants to try some manga, I dropped Berserk after the first volume (pretty sure that's blasphemy, but I found it gratuitous and just not well put together), DearS after the first volume, and Mai-chan's Daily Life after three chapters...

This feels weird since I've seen a lot of people give this a 10/10 but I dropped Shinsekai Yori after 7 episodes. They did that 3 episode arc about the mole/rat people and I 100% did not care about anything that happened in those 3 episodes, so I stopped there and haven't picked it up again.
>> ARTICLE
I can see that, looks like you made it through the first arc which is pretty focused on setting up the world and introducing you to the monster rats. I wasn't a huge fan of those 3 episodes either even though I loved the show as a whole. The monster rats play a pretty important part in the story and you'll probably find them a lot more interesting next time they show up.

With a lot of the basic world-building out of the way, the next arc should start revealing a lot more of what's going on in the community, and several major things happen that will be huge in the final arc. I'd give it a few more episodes and see if it gets more interesting for you.

Black Bullet is. Currently on hold for me. I've made it to episode 8. I got distracted as well...  Watching better anime

Yeah that's the thing it was good but... There was just better anime to watch

I have dropped:

Fruits Basket: 2/26

God Eater: 1/?

Mobile Fighter G Gundam: 4/49

School Rumble: 21/26 (Loved the show until I was spoiled on ending... Not gana get me to watch this one again)

Its REALLY heartwarming, and the characters are fantastic, its an easy 9/10 to me.

Akame ga Kill at episode 13, it's the worst anime I've ever watched so far, rated at a 3/10, I don't think anyone could convince me to watch it honestly. AoT at episode 22, yes, it honestly isn't that bad I just completely lost interest, got too boring for me. Samurai Flamenco at episode 11, yes, that episode, it took too big of a turn there and I heard it gets better after that arc but honestly I am not sure.

Here's my drop list: [MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Azyure?status=4&order=0)

Are there any that I *really* should go back and see? 

Convince me, please.

Plastic Memories. After it did nothing for like 3 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Nana eps. 4 - I loved everything about this anime except for pixie Nana. Totally ruined it for me

Berserk - I'm between a rock & a hard place, here. I stopped at around the halfway point so I could switch to the manga, but at this point it looks like I'm more likely to quit watching anime altogether than start reading manga

Ai Yori Aoshi eps. 9 - I just can't be bothered to continue with it

Ushio to Tora eps. 2 - Same thing

Ao no Exorcist - 3 random episodes on Toonami - it seems cool, but pretty run of the mill at the same time

DanMachi eps. 2 - I got bored with it, and I havent heard any reason to continue

Punch Line - an absolutely godawful first episode has crippled any chance of me continuing this, no matter how much i'll probably like it
>> ARTICLE
triage-x, so far my only dropped show ;) 
>> ARTICLE
Im really sorry. But i tried to get into A Certain Magical Index but nothing shone out at me, the concept was fairly interesting but i only saw a few moments that made me keep watching. I would like to finish, but by episode 9 I was bored and had forgotten the storyline enough for me to let it go. What exciting thing am i missing?
>> ARTICLE
Before I start I'm going to let you know that episode 1-9 suck. Because they are  magical arcs. Episode 10 is the start of a science arc and it's one of best arcs in the season. You stopped right before it got good! 

All I need to say is [Misaka mutha fuckin Mikoto](https://youtube.com/watch?v=MHW3TvCVeq4) 

The thing about Index is that it has Magical arcs and Science arcs. The Science side is soooo much better. I felt like I had to force myself to watch the magic side; I just didn't like them. And it rotates between them. The unfortunate thing is that the magic side seemed to always last longer than the science. But this show has one of the best antagonists of all anime - Accelerator.

There's a spin off called A Certain Scientific Railgun where the main character is Misaka Mikoto (The 5th most powerful person in the city). It's a lot more light hearted than Index, but it's all science, so I actually enjoyed it more.
>> ARTICLE
funny thing is i started because someone said that accelerator had one of the best powers for a villain, seems i forgot about that halfway through. Thanks! ill start again tonight at 10 then

Oh yea. His power is ridiculous. So OP

Nisemonogatari. To be honest, there's nothing really wrong with it, I loved characters, their interactions. I just couldn't shake away the feeling that I'm missing half of it by watching it in english instead of japanese. It just feels wrong, all those impossible to translate jokes and even full conversations. Also, I heard that Second Season is easily the best season of the show, is it worth to keep watching for all the good stuff that happens in the future?

Dropped *Ergo Proxy* years ago after 2 episodes. Then I picked it up again after I saw people showering it with praise. I forced myself to watch it until episode 12 before giving up again. The reason I watched it this far is because I normally like shows with this kind of dystopian setting, such as *Psycho Pass*. For *Ergo Proxy* however, everything fell flat.

I have dropped Fairy Tail, Kyoukai no Kanata, and Gintama.

NGE. Please don't kill me. 

I felt that, after 17-18 episodes, the plot was getting nowhere, and the characters weren't developing. Maybe mecha anime isn't for me.

Considered dropping the new show Charlotte because it seemed too slice of life even though its supernatural. But then was told to watch through the current episodes and my opinion of the whole show has changed completely. It is now one of my favorite simulcast shows.

One piece. I couldn't get past the art/noses.
>> ARTICLE
The art gets way better eventually. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright I guess I'll say everything that I've dropped over the years.

* Arslan Senki - Found the main character uninteresting

* Bleach - Got too repetitive

* ClassroomCrisis - Seemed kinda generic and I was pretty bored while watching the first few episode.

* Fairy Tail - Far too generic, fans overhype it, mediocre animation, No real sense of story or direction, very repetitive.

* Fate/Stay Night - The direction of suspense, art, and exposition was horrible

* Gakkou Garashi - This show makes me feel sad inside

* Naruto - I just found the Chunin Exams sort of boring but I was really digging it until then

* Sword Art Online - I couldn't stand Kirito. The show takes itself far too seriously, it's also uncreative while nothing seems to be expanded upon despite having a premise with unimaginable potential.

* Trinity Seven - Didn't like the art, not a fan of extreme ecchi that tries to have a story (we all know why we're watching this don't try to hide it with a plot)


Have fun trying to convince me
>> ARTICLE
ClassroomCrisis has gotten really good, its the surprise of the season for me; I've been wait for a good non-war political/school thing.

I think I'll give it a shot, it's just one of those shows that got on my list unfairly because I was interested enough to keep up with it weekly this season because there is a lot that I'm watching this season.

I'll probably binge it all when this season ends

What didn't you like about Akame Ga Kill? I really enjoyed that series. 

And I think you should watch episode 2 of Black Bullet before you give up on it. It's tone is way different than episode 1, which came off more as a joke. 
>> ARTICLE
Akame ga Kill just got kind of predictable, and I found its attempts to switch between harem comedy and Very Serious action show too jarring. It started strong, but couldn't keep my interest once it got settled.

Black Bullet was in a season of other particularly strong (or at least distinctive) shows and lost out to Ping Pong, Isshukan Friends and Mekaku City Actors. Though I also watched all of Akuma no Riddle that season, so maybe my standards weren't *that* high...

Neon Genesis Evangelion.

Simply over-hyped; baby's first "deep" anime. Felt beyond pretentious. I almost regret watching all 26 of the series.

Rebuild 1/2 was nice. The animation budget helped quite a bit.

Though, it can be argued that I didn't see it in 2000 when the DVD's were released, or even in the Adult Swim days 5 years later (I was familiar with FMA, though, just not in the age demographic yet), so perhaps, I am not part of "the generation".

I have been familiar with it since around 2007; just that the title and all the merchandise feeling of complexity put me off.

However, there are plenty of younger kids on here, in middle school/high school even, that dig it.

Maybe its *because* (?) it's for 12-15 year old kids, that they find it so profound?

Anyhow, when I got around to watching FMA the spring before high school, 6 years ago (**Woah**), I may have read a bit of the manga already- but still perhaps a bit too old for me, I stopped after 3 episodes.

Just could not handle it.  I only finished it (and Brotherhood, which as-of-yet was only *announced* to be in English) a winter ago.

If manga counts: I dropped HxH in 2010. Far too many hiatuses. I was even on the late US releases. Just too long waiting for anything to release. I recently saw that revamped animated version. They also took *that* version to axes.

It's great, but it doesn't finish. ?


So, **really, I've only quit on Neon Genesis Evangelion, and only when including the OVA's and movies**

Naruto about 80 times because of filler.
Bleach because of the Bount Arc. (I picked it back up afterwards)

Log Horizon, after 3-4 episodes I couldn't take it anymore. Probably the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Of all the "stuck in a game" anime I've seen, Log Horizon does it the best. It seems like it's actually an mmo. The main character is very competent and probably the smartest character, but not too strong on his own. No one in the anime is really OP, because most of the main characters are maxed level. There's a lot of politics involved, where they're trying to make the world livable, rather than let everyone kill everyone. But there's still a good mix of action. I've only seen season 1, but every episode made me want to watch another. 
>> ARTICLE
>Log Horizon does it the best

Overlord.
>> ARTICLE
I think they've made it pretty clear that's it's not a video game. At least not the one he played. 
>> ARTICLE
Neither is Log Horizon? 
>> ARTICLE
It is though. The npcs remember the MC from when he first started playing the game. 
>> ARTICLE
So do the NPCs in Overlord.
>> ARTICLE
No they don't. Have we been watching the same anime?  Isn't the MC's goal to spread his name around? Doesn't everyone that meets him say "who is this guy". 

The only npcs that know him are the ones programmed to follow him because they're part of the guild. And in those NPC's minds, their creators are "Greater than God", meaning they think of them as some divine force rather than players. 
>> ARTICLE
Shalltear remembers a conversation between Ainz and Peroroncino from before Episode 1. 
>> ARTICLE
Yea the whole guild was transported into the world. They've claimed many times that they aren't in Yggdrasil anymore. On the first episode, the butler went outside and confirmed that the entire surroundings of the guild were completely different, meaning they were in a different place. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it did that part really well It constantly reminds you that you are in the game. That's what SaO lacked. (you could actually remove the being "stuck inside the game" in SaO and it would not really change anything (in the first season)

*whispers in r/anime's ear* Hyouka. 

reason simplified: MC is a boring little shit. Something something energy conservation. TELL ME WHY IM WRONG.
>> ARTICLE
i'm 12 eps in... don't really want to continue, but I watch it every now and again.
>> ARTICLE
it appeals to me a another calming slice of life, yet has an interesting plot and character development.

I'm not sure what you were expecting, but it probably didnt happen till the halfway point
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka is slow and the plot is a bit dull.  It's mostly about a group of four people solving mundane mysteries that don't matter/have no real weight (unless you consider interpersonal relationships of THE MOST DIRE VALUE).  All that being said, it's in my top five.  Granted, I watched it SLOWLY.  (took me three months - 2 episodes a week).  I absolutely love the art direction, animation, character design, and all artistic values of the show (I like kyo-ani's stuff).  It is also a very fun slice-of-life IMO and the character's relationships are very real and entertaining.  Chitanda is super cute and I love every moment spent with her.  The MC is a bit relatable for me, personally, and his crush on Chitanda is fun to watch (don't expect too much romantic development, though).  All-in-all, it certainly isn't action-packed and I almost never recommend it to people IRL, so if you ABSOLUTELY couldn't stand it past episode five, that's fine.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
> MC is a boring little shit

That's his character flaw. The point of the show is watching it because we want him to stop being a boring little shit. And Chitanda.


>> ARTICLE
I dropped Code Geass because I fell asleep watching it, and also I hate mecha.

I dropped Magi after the first episode because Aladdin was too annoying.

CG has a slow start, if you dropped it in the first 3 or 4 episodes.

For Magi Aladdin slowly matures through out the show and becomes less annoying.

eva-- i mean by "someone" i mean everyone on the internet. i have dropped it three times. i WILL FINISH IT... later.
>> ARTICLE
ARE YOU (NOT) ENTERTAINED?

lol if you made it past the first few episodes with Asuka, I don't know if I'd still bother with it, but its definitely a great show
>> ARTICLE
If you dropped it three times, I think it's time to give up. You really don't need to force yourself through something that's supposed to be for entertainment purposes.
>> ARTICLE
haha, i feel i gotta endure it just to have seen it, i guess. plus i'm interested in this convoluted existentialism ending everyone harps on about.

...but other than that, i've never made it past episode... 8 i think? maybe this time i'll skim the ones i've seen and SLOWLY progress up.
>> ARTICLE
The show never gets full on mindfuck until episodes 25+26 and end of evangelion.

I think starting from episode 15, the show gets a lot deeper and more mysteries are brought up and solved from the point on. But I watched it all in one day so it just turns into one blob in my head and I can't remember which episodes things happen, so don't take my words as fact.

Also, I believe if a person can't relate to the character (experienced the same feelings they have had or similar ones) you'd just view them as ridiculous and nonsensical most of the time. Which isn't really anyone's fault, just saying so. 
>> ARTICLE
i wonder about that... i'll have to try one more time.

i can definitely find angst interesting, it's just the pacing in general that for me killed it so early on. you wouldn't really get much progress of any kind early on, and the battles made it feel slightly episodic at times.

...i bet i'll actually enjoy it once they go further. or not. but i'll watch it and see, at least.
>> ARTICLE
The battles are there just for them to be built upon, they never actually make a big part of the story (or at least I don't think so) but the things that happen during them is what's important.

Also, I think that the beginning battles are supposed to feel like a chore because they are to the characters, they're just going through them because they have to.

And that is true, it is very episodic in the "angel is here, angel is dead" fashion early on, which all boils down to personal preference if you enjoy these types of things.
>> ARTICLE
I dropped Mahouka on episode 7. Tatsuya just pissed me off, saying that the system separating the students was right and everyone just agreed with him, even students that were fighting against it.
>> ARTICLE
well tatsuya was kinda right,[maybe spoiler, just explaining that specific situation](/s  "there wasnt much of a difference between the student, the problem was that the ones with power where smug about it and bullied the others The others agreed with him because he was right, the students that were fighting didnt even know what they wanted to fight for ")

i think this series suffers from a bad reputation and people dont give it a second look, its not a masterpiece but it has interesting points that people tend to overlook 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not gonna say that anime is great, because I've dropped it twice around episodes 23-24 both times, but you dropped it at the beginning of the best arc. The series puts its worst arc in the beginning. I'm sure that you've realized by now that Tatsuya is OP, but you haven't seen anything yet. I'll just leave it at that. 
>> ARTICLE
show is stupid. I still wonder why I completed that series.
>> ARTICLE
Baccano!

I was very confused after the first episode. I want to watch it but I couldn't follow it.
>> ARTICLE
I think everybody finds the first episode confusing. Just try to keep track of all the characters, and the story should start making more sense by episode 3 or 4.
>> ARTICLE
ef first season
dropped cause voice of main character(dunno what his name is, he met girl with eye patch) was irritated 
and main female characters also irritated me so much
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi- I don't care about art or characters who only show up for 1 episode. I found this show to be the most unrelaxing anime I have ever watched that does not contain action. How can people relax when people have life threatening illnesses. Do they honestly think that being a doctor is a relaxing job? The main character is boring and 1 dimensional, and I doubt there will ever be character growth. My disinterest in the main character and the episodic patients makes me not care about the the series at all. The atmosphere doesn't mean much if you don't care what happens to the characters.

I've watched up to episode 10.
>> ARTICLE
Death Note. I just couldn't take it serious after 'hurr all criminals deserve to die *cue orchestral music* [dramatic writing]'.

[ ](/s "Fite me")
>> ARTICLE
[Minor Death Note spoiler] (/s "Light gets pretty crazy. He develops a God complex and eventually evolves from criminals to anyone who gets in his way")

Once this show picks up, you'll be on the edge of your seat. It's so dramatic, and the 2 main characters are incredibly intelligent while constantly trying to 1-up each other. It's a battle of wits that gets more intense every episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Dropped KLK after episode 3. I had high hopes because I love Gurren Lagann, but I just wasn't hooked by the story/characters. And the fanservice was pretty ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
The fanservice is supposed to be ridiculous, it's pretty much an anime on drugs. Like TTGL, it gets a LOT better towards the end. (I nearly dropped TTGL since I don't really like mecha anime but after that one part involving Kamina early on in the series, I got hooked)
>> ARTICLE
Alright man. I know exactly what you mean, but hear me out. 

I first watched this show about 4 months ago and I didn't know what to expect because I went in completely blind. The amount of fanservice actually shocked me, because I never watched ecchi before that (this was a gateway anime for me). I dropped it after episode 5, but decided to give it another try a couple of days later and I realized that it was a pretty good anime. Like Gurren Lagen, it gets pretty intense, each fight becoming bigger and bigger. There are a couple of scenes that I just wanted to yell "HELL YEAH!!". There are even a couple of twists and some super powered characters that are pretty badass. There's even a couple of episodes that are too deep, considering what show it is. 

I honestly think that you should give it another try. The later episodes will get you pretty hyped up. 
>> ARTICLE
^same thing happened to me.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean by fan service. I really do but it's worth the watch. Trust me. I watched the Anime really recently. Like, couple weeks ago. Once you get through a few episodes, you're able to just ignore the fan service. In the show's case, the fan service is almost justified considering the way things go and damn if it isn't hilarious. Honestly, it's there for comedic purposes. Since 'fan service' is something put in primarily to please the fans, and this is for comedic purposes, it sort of defeats the definition of what fan service is to begin with so one could also use the argument that it *isn't* fan service. In short, just finish the Anime. You'll see what I mean. *Trust me.*
>> ARTICLE
It's more like parody-ish of fanservice/magical girls. It's kind of Captain Underpants about it. Also the last 1/4 is amazing.


>> ARTICLE
Dropped NGNL after ep 4 cause the chess game was irrational and took away from what Chess really is. I felt like it was a BS "emotion" based victory, like the kind in a typical crap shonen.

Convince me otherwise?
>> ARTICLE
Because it wasn't chess after all...

"A world where games decide everything" the show is obviously comedic, with some twists here and there, I think you screwed it up by taking it too seriously.

But it is my opinion that said "chess" game was just clever, for it really did apply human emotion and morale to it. If you think soldiers can fight without morale or emotion, you're mistaken.

But "ridiculing" an old game won't happen again in the show, nor will this "emotion based victory", as far as I remember.
>> ARTICLE
If you watch NGNL, you can't take it seriously at all. It's more of a comedy than anything, and I loved it. The second major Game is probably regarded as the best (wasn't my favorite) because it's closer to a mind game than anything else, but everything else is pretty much an ass pull. 

And the chess game was by far the worse moment and had the biggest ass pull in the anime, so it just gets better from there. 

I've heard that this show will be either good or bad depending on what type of expectations you have going in. Just don't take it too seriously and you'll probably like it. It's one of my top 10 purely because it's one of the few animes that made me laugh out loud multiple times. 
>> ARTICLE
I see. I had gone in expecting something like Liar Game and a protagonist who was clever like how Lelouch or Light would be, so everything just felt bad to me.

I don't think Ill watch it then, since I didn't find the show funny. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong. They are clever. They even explain real life pro tactics in some of the games. It's just not a serious show overall.

bikini warriors

gangsta

Highschool DxD

A.Z
>> ARTICLE
Gangsta is cool if you like mafias and what not. Fair bit of action but mostly character development. Could get boring for people who wants more action than plot though.

A.Z no
>> ARTICLE
Gangsta is turning out to be a very enjoyable show. I dont know how far you got into it but, the action stays pretty consistent and exciting, if anything the fights get harder and more in favor of the "bad guys". As for character development we get more backstory on how the main two got to be where they are, and its done pretty well imo.

What made you drop the show?
>> ARTICLE
mostly no motivation to watch it and probably the animation, especially in ep 4 or 5 i dont remember it was pretty bad. I have 6 episodes under my belt, i just didnt feel it. I was actually liking it but i never got the motivation to watch the newer ones 
>> ARTICLE
I'm still watching Gangsta but I'm honestly disappointed the past few eps; it's dropping in my rankings as nothing has really developed story-wise. It could still pleasantly surprise me but I have my doubts, so I don't blame you for losing interest.
>> ARTICLE
> bikini warriors

If you were too blind to recognize its perfection then don't bother picking it up again.
>> ARTICLE
honestly the problem with it for me was that it tried to have a plot like they are helping a king or some other random shit, if its about the fanservice just fucking show boobs for the 3 mins it airs no time for some half-ass plot

I don't think it has any plot, it's basically just parodies of RPG's.

Owari no Seraph

Good luck convincing me to pick that trash up. 
>> ARTICLE
How far did you get into it? I enjoyed it, but it was by no means great. It had some nice action and great animation. I think the second part is going to be really intense. If anything finish the first 12 episodes to watch the second part when it comes out. 
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, the main character is the 3rd Eren Jager of this season, I don't like the vampires as villains, and the character design is sooooooo cliche/bland. The setting is boring. And there are a lot of "Quality" aspects to the animation.

I watched the last episode after hearing that it was interesting, only to see "Next Level Deus Ex Machina Powerup". And of course he went insane and nearly killed his friends, or else it wouldn't be dramatic enough.

I think I've just seen this show 3 times already, and this is the halfass adaption by a 3rd rate director leeching off the title's popularity.

it wasnt trash it was very average, the fighting scenes where smooth, some characters where interesting, they dropped the highschool setting after some episodes, overall it was enjoyable

**Steins;Gate**

I heard a lot of good things about it so I want to like it, but I watched the pilot a while ago and I found it pretty boring (nothing attention grabbing happened in it for me). I should also mention that I usually don't like time travel stories because I find they're generally not well executed.
>> ARTICLE
The first part is SLOOOOOOOWWW AS FUUUUUUUCK. However, you really, really appreciate it later since it built up the characters so much for you. Episode 9 is when things kind of start to kick into gear, and i think episode 11 or 12 is when things really kick into gear. It's not really time travel and more time loop as well if that interests you.
>> ARTICLE
Dropping it at the first episode is a pretty bad idea. Try and get to episode 9 where the tone starts to change (although personally I'd tell you to watch it to episode 12 to make the judgement call). Steins; Gate is known for executing the time travel story EXTREMELY well. It's pretty ingenious if you ask me.

I can say too much about it, because I haven't finished it yet. But honestly, the only complaint over heard about the show was the slow start. Everyone that has seen it through has loved it. 

And from what I can tell, it's not a time travel story. 

It's *the* time travel story. 
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy after 1 episode. It just felt too random and I wasn't sold on the humor.

Classroom Crisis after 2 episodes. I felt like I had more than enough shows to keep up with this season, and I don't typically go for political intrigue type shows (which seems to be its usual selling point).
>> ARTICLE
For me, I don't really find that I drop a show because I don't like it, but because I want to watch other stuff instead.

So its better to say I have indefinitely paused:

* Nichijou
* Guilty Crown
* Watamote
* Overlord
* Gangsta
* Steins Gate
* Death Parade

And a few others I can't name of the top head. I'm also a huge fan of the monogatari series, but the constant talking/subs drives me crazy after a few episodes so I take breaks of weeks or more between bouts of 2-4 episodes
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari at episode 4. It was so boring I couldn't even stay awake.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you on this, I watched to episode 7 or 8? It doesn't seem to get any better, but I feel like I must be missing something considering it has like 4 sequels and the most DVD sales ever or some prestige like that
>> ARTICLE
I've dropped Steins;Gate at least three times now. I have no idea what people see in it.
>> ARTICLE
The first third is really slow because it sets up all the relations and mistakes that the group makes. This means that the last half (that is very well executed) is really powerful. I had to skim like two of the early episodes, but its very good.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't actually managed to get to this point, but people claimed about halfway through the show some real stuff happens and they basically had to keep watching it from there.
>> ARTICLE
Stein's Gate. The whole series was a fking snorefest about absolutely nothing until the middle....then it's just a god damn rollercoaster. One day when you decide to rewatch it and realize that...like a good detective show...all the clues were right in front of you the whole time...
>> ARTICLE
Steins gate after 1-2 episodes because I didn't know what the fuck was happening and it all seemed quite boring.
>> ARTICLE
The first third is slow as its builds up the relations between the characters as well as their mistakes, by that point, its ROLLS. The final half of Steins;Gate is very well executed and why everyone loves it, if you can make it, I skimmed a couple of episodes because of the pacing.
>> ARTICLE
Alright i'm going to try it again! 
>> ARTICLE
Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season(ep 5), Angel Beats(ep 6), Elfen Lied(ep2), FMA(ep4) and FMA:B(ep15).


>> ARTICLE
Don't finish Aldnoah. I only finished it because I like Mecha a lot.

Its ending is utter crap that makes Soul Eater's ending perfection itself.
>> ARTICLE
You dropped FMA B and angel beats I don't know what to say but why?
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats just felt weak all around, the characters, story, visuals, sound etc. As far as FMA:B goes it's not really dropped, it's more like I put it on hold for a really long time and I have no motivation to watch it again.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh ok fair enough 
>> ARTICLE
> As far as FMA:B goes it's not really dropped, it's more like I put it on hold for a really long time and I have no motivation to watch it again.

It's so good. It really is.
>> ARTICLE
You won't really miss out on anything by not watching A/Z till the end. Elfen lied is a great show imo if you don't mind some gore (quite a lot of it) here and there, it starts out a bit meh.. but it gets a lot better. You've only watched 2 episodes, I guarantee it'll be a lot better 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, A.Z I agree fully. If anything watching it to the end will only annoy you. Horrible horrible ending.

Angel beats you finished right around the point where they realized there isn't a second season and just finished the story. It's where the feels trip begins.
>> ARTICLE
My problem with Elfen Lied was not that it had too much gore which I tend to enjoy in anime but the way it was presented. It just seemed like they splattered gore around to make it look darker and more mature, which is the opposite of what I actually got.
>> ARTICLE
Elfen Lied is pretty edgy by today's standards. Dont feel bad about dropping it, you are not missing to much. 

FMA:B is a really good shounen though. It stays strong to the end. If it's not your cup of tea, i wont make you watch it. But if you do get the hankering for a shounen, i recommend it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll admit I dropped stein's gate after episode 2. I've heard so many good things about it, but I still can't bring myself to keep watching. Help me
>> ARTICLE
Gunslinger Stratos.  Started off REALLY interesting, but then slowed down and got boring as shit.  I can't really  explain it, the formula looked right, all the action was there.  But I hated the show =(

Dropped at episode 5.

It's my AotY I'm not complaining by a LONG shot. Chiyo is on my list of top 5 favorite characters from anime.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't place it at AotY personally, but holy shit it's good. I think I preferred Barakamon this season. It wasn't as outright funny but it really felt like it *went* somewhere - and I'm partial to SoL which also had something to do with it.
>> ARTICLE
AotY as far as how much I just flat out enjoyed it is what I meant. Completely personal opinion. Not AotY as far as objective show quality that is for sure. Something like Barakamon, A.Z or from a different season would be a better fit for that.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah for sure, I get where you're coming from. After all, even voting-based "Thing of the Year" contests are just whichever item garnered the most favorites.
>> ARTICLE
It'd be great to see Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, especially with all the attention and art that /r/anime is giving.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure that would be one of the most hilarious possibilities, given his talent already. If he can make shows like Fate/Zero and Psycho Pass funny, what could he do with something like Nozaki-kun?
>> ARTICLE
I think I've asked bofore, but can't remember the answer. Is this anime actually finished? Or will it have another season?
>> ARTICLE
It's done. It's based on a manga, I think, of which there was already a live-action movie adaptation. I don't think there's any more material.
>> ARTICLE
It's a complete adaptation of a manga which is done. It's a nice, complete package in 12 episodes, just the right length for this sort of highly character driven story.
>> ARTICLE
It's finished. AFAIK, It won't have another season.
>> ARTICLE
I think it adapted the whole manga, so I don't think there will be a second season.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I'll probably watch it soon. I've heard a lot of good stuff about it. Also Happy Cake Day!

Since everyone has Tatami Galaxy, FLCL, and Ping Pong, which I agree with, I will pick some others: Katanagatari, Kino's Journey, Kids on the Slope. 

Bonus: Haibane Renmei
>> ARTICLE
So I replied with my three, then scrolled down and saw your comment, only to see that the three I picked were the same three you said everyone was saying haha. Guess /r/anime's taste is starting to shape up :p
>> ARTICLE
Kids on the Slope. Top 3 anime regardless of length.
>> ARTICLE
Kino's journey, what a great story. Strong message in every episode.
>> ARTICLE
> Katanagatari

lol that's about twice as long as a regular 1-cour anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Still technically qualifies though!
>> ARTICLE
Technically, the best kind of correct.
>> ARTICLE
1. Katanagatari
2. Baccano!
3. Death Parade
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari and Baccano are both kinda cheating sincr Katanagatari has hour long episodes and Baccano has 3 post show Ovas to follow up the story
All three though are grear choices with Death Parade my favorite of the three
>> ARTICLE
1. [Hataraku Maou-sama!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama!)
2. [Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun)
3. [Ao Haru Ride](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21995/Ao_Haru_Ride)

Ao Haru Ride is incredibly underrated. If you like romance, you should watch it.
>> ARTICLE
first I wanna say that i love your username. second Hataraku Maou-sama is one of the first animes that I've enjoyed.
>> ARTICLE
I wish all of those animes would get another season.

I need more Hataraku Maou-sama!

Especially GSNk, imo. I've never laughed so hard so consistently while watching an anime before. It was like full belly laughs at least 3 times an episode.

Have you seen the Specials? It's like getting another two episodes.

I just read the manga for that as well. We NEED a second season.

Nobody ever mentions Book of Circus on this sub. I'm not even that big a fan of Kuroshituji but it definitely got me into it.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of want to watch it but I found the whole of Kuroshitsuji S1 mediocre, could I skip right to BoC? 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry I felt the same way. If you've watched the first season yes. BoC is apparently true to the manga whereas the anime has an Original Ending around episode 15. As long as you remember roughly the characters and the setting you'll be golden.

The first episode of BoC will give you a refresher for the most part as well.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still waiting for the next arc after Book of Murder
>> ARTICLE
Though if you watch Baccano! You need to watch the postseason episodes too.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I thought the ending was a good place to stop. Didn't see a reason to watch the extras.
>> ARTICLE
They're fun. The new character introduced can be kind of annoying, but the episodes are still a lot of fun.
>> ARTICLE
* Gunbuster
* Aria the Origination
* Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket
>> ARTICLE
Never seen Aria but if it is being grouped with those other two I need to watch it **now**.

There are 3 seasons and ova of Aria though for a total of 53 episodes

Aria is basically a mech series. I mean, with cats, and Venice, and jazz, and no mechs.

It's awesome.

Diebuster is also great as a sequel to Gunbuster.

1. Madoka Magica

Ga-Rei Zero is one of those animes I try to get all my friends to watch. When they come back and tell me the can't get into it, I just don't understand. IT'S SO WONDERFUL! Like a glorious train wreck.
>> ARTICLE
1. Madoka
2. FLCL.
3. Kyousougiga
>> ARTICLE
I still cant believe that Madoka is so short. They fit such a good story in so few episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
That pacing is just perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see some love for Kyousougiga. That's one of my favorite shows and I rarely see people mention it.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, but obscure :)
>> ARTICLE
It aired at the same time as Kill la Kill so that's not surprising. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it was kind of an underdog in a season of some pretty heavy-hitters, so it's not surprising a lot of people overlooked it. It also started with a rather confusing, breakneck speed episode 0, which might have turned some people off.

It's a shame, though. It has such a cool visual style, an interesting cast of characters, and a satisfying ending. Not to mention pretty tight thematic focus.
>> ARTICLE
Try FLCL. Only 6 episodes, but one of the best-crafted stories I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
I have "never knows best" on my left arm.  I absolutely love this show. 10/10
>> ARTICLE
And ahead of its time.
>> ARTICLE
In what way? I love it but nothing about it feels out of place for the time it was made.
>> ARTICLE
It was a testbed for a lot of new animation techniques pioneered by Gainax at that time that were later used in stuff like Diebuster, Gurren Lagann etc.

Edit: Not to mention how uncommonly popular it became in the U.S., it's probably more popular here than it is in Japan and Adult Swim even solicited Gainax with money to make a second season (which they turned down) 
>> ARTICLE
If memory serves it wasn't very big when it was released, at least in the States. I watched it with a friend who was way into Anime then but never heard it discussed. A few years later it became more popular.
>> ARTICLE
You think so? To me it felt like it was at its most popular when it was first released, and while it's still well known and regarded it's popularity has only waned since then. I guess it's all a matter of perspective and what parts of anime fandom you engage with.
>> ARTICLE
It grew in popularity mainly because Adult Swim ran it over and over again nonstop for years, allowing so many people to hop aboard the FLCL bandwagon over time. But when it first came out, I can see how it wouldn't be as popular.

Plus, it was contemporary with Toonami, which is most peoples' first gateway into anime itself. I think before Toonami anime in general was a really niche medium. 
>> ARTICLE
Try Pale Cocoon. Only 1 episode, but one of the most intersting stories I've seen.

I mean, there are a ton of good OVAs. I love [Riding Bean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1NAhlVRaZ4).


>> ARTICLE
RIDING BEAN IS AWESOME.

More people need to watch this OVA.  It's super short and highly rewatchable. It's silly and tons of fun.  A  comedic Japanese take on the cheesy American 80s action flick.

- 1) Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches

- 2) White Album 2

- 3) Noragami


>> ARTICLE
Eh, Yamada was pretty entertaining, but it was also quite forgettable and quite difficult to absorb just because of how rushed everything was in the anime. It just skipped from scene to scene, and skipped out on a bunch of scenes and backstory details that fleshed out the characters **a lot** more in the manga.

Most of the witches were literally just skimmed through, and the anime offered no reason to really care for them. 

It is probably one of the best examples of shows that would benefit **a lot** from more episodes and a much slower pacing. 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, those witches that were "skimmed" were not really fleshed out in the manga either, and mostly just served as plot points. I think it was a very good adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
There is going to be a season two of noragami btw. If it ramps up like the manga does, it's going to get even better too!

3. Sora no Woto
>> ARTICLE
1. Sora no Woto.
 * It starts off lovely, then it gets cute, then it gets dark, and then suddenly it's the most heart-touchingly beautiful ending I've ever seen. Probably the only show to feature an ancient spider tank made of future and then have the balls to be a non-action show and let the thing sit in a shed until it's needed.

2. Baccano!
 * Probably the craziest storytelling I've seen, nothing does fun and exciting quite the same way. Take a bunch of great characters, then grab their storylines and tie them all together in a big knot. Slather the whole thing in some fantastic prohibition-era flavour complete with the best damn jazz soundtrack around and a dub full of genius. Then cut your creation up and serve it in completely the wrong order but somehow get everything to wrap up nicely at the end. That's Baccano! Technically 16 episodes but the last three are OVAs and I'll take any excuse to recommend it here.

3. Girls und Panzer.
 * Imagine a Moe slice of life show about a bunch of girls living through school life. Now think up some absurd gimmick that no one will ever expect. Something ridiculous like the girls drive tanks around after school. You are now ready to ride the moe bandwagon all the way to money town. Except you're not going to do that. You're going to kick that "slice of life" nonsense and turn this thing into a god damn sports anime. A good one. With tanks. Come up with an absurdly big cast of characters, structure the plot around a major tournament, the protagonists surprisingly grim backstory and some serious stakes. Then throw them into some actually really fun tank battles with real strategic depth. Now direct this thing like a champ. Master the pacing. Know when to build the tension, and when to deliver. If you can do this, you can create Girls und Panzer.

>> ARTICLE
What is it about?
>> ARTICLE
27 year old business dude falls in love with his 15 year old sister, not much more than that.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough
>> ARTICLE
As has been said it is about a brother who falls in love with his younger sister. But it is the way the show handles the subject of incest and age difference which makes it so good in my opinion.  
The show gives you something to think about, it knows incest is not accepted but what if you are truly in love?
>> ARTICLE
It is much more than that, it takes incest seriously unlike shit such as Oreimo.
>> ARTICLE
replace incest with pedophilia, and sure.
>> ARTICLE
Next thing you know, you'll be saying Lolita is a terrible book because it's about pedophilia.
>> ARTICLE
it is about incest, you learn that very early on. But I think it treats it more seriously than other shows and is definitely worth a watch.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching Koi Kaze without any prior knowledge to it. I didn't grasp that it was about ACTUAL incestual love until the very end in which it left me both disgusted and amazed how good the series actually was.

>> ARTICLE
What did you think it was about?
>> ARTICLE
It was a while ago I watched it... But if I recall correctly I thought it was more about misunderstandings. She wanted to be more with her brother and him trying to avoid weird shit happening, I never undrstood they had deeper feelings towards eachother (except maybe she having a small crush on him) until the last 2-3 episodes when they made it super obvious.

Edit: It was more I who was oblivious to the fact that it was an incestual relationship since I went in to the anime blind (as it isn't a common theme to be serious about). So I kinda neglected every bit of info thrown at me.
>> ARTICLE
I see. The reason I'm genuinely curious is because the premise of the show is made pretty clear in episode 1 (at least I thought so).
>> ARTICLE
I mention it all the time! :P (I seriously post about it in almost every romance thread.)

But yeah, it's a really good series.

Hope it doesn't turn out sour.
>> ARTICLE
There's been plenty of negative comments (especially one guy circlejerking his hate here for it), trust me. It's one of those "It's not for everyone" type anime like Trigun, Monogatari, or Space Dandy.  I and some others really love it for the atmosphere and lost history of the world, while some others do find it overall boring and wish there was more to the world and lore. If you don't like it that's completely understandable.

Personally I think I'm just on a moe overload. I need to balance that out... maybe with Kaiji.

Also, don't miss out on the OVAs (not available on Crunchy if that's where you're watching). 

7.5 is good fun, but the second OVA, Episode 13, is absolutely essential.

1. Hibike! Euphonium  
- For a twelve episode series, this one had perfect pace and absolutely beautiful animation. And a big factor for me in shorter series is how rewatchable it is, how many hints there are to pick up later. H!E is a masterclass on small details, and it's larger themes are executed perfectly as well.   
  
2. Madoka Magica  
- self-explanatory. What a brilliant work of art and storytelling.   
  
3. Sora No Woto  
- One of the greatest examples of "show don't tell" done right. Complete with a perfect soundtrack, fantastic voice acting, and broken yet hopeful characters, Sora No Woto doesn't waste a second of its allotted time. In fact, it just makes you wish you had more.

#1. Barakamon

My go to relaxing anime, Barakamon is a slice of life with an overarching plot of a calligrapher moving from urban to rural Japan. He befriends the inhabitants, including a lovable little scamp. 

#2. Sakamichi no Apollon/Kids on the Slope 

A coming of age story where the protagonist, an amateur pianist, is introduced to jazz by two classmates. The mood of Sakamichi no Apollon reminds me a lot of Ghibli movies. 

#3. Baccano! 

Set up similar to Pulp Fiction, Baccano! involves multiple linked stories presented in an achronological fashion. While confusing at first, lovable characters and a fun OST kept me watching till everything started coming together, and then the plot had me marathoning it till I finished it.

[Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8795/Panty_&_Stocking_with_Garterbelt)

I'll admit that the enjoyment they bring might be up to your personal taste. I would find myself unable to explain that those are masterpieces objectively but I'd say that they may proof quite worthy for their respectively short duration.

Okay, I would like to second (third, fourth, whatever) The Devil is a Part Timer (Hataraku Maou Sama). Great show, I absolutely adored it. The humor was spot on, I laughed out loud tons of times. 

Also, no one has said Eden of the East! Very interesting story. It's funny, genuine, and just extremely intriguing. I was drawn in from the very beginning, and I think you will be too.

Oh, this isn't a suggestion thread... my bad.

So little No Game No Life in the comments :O

 I haven't seen many that you all quote though.

* Death Parade
* Barakamon
* Madoka
>> ARTICLE
One very underrated show that, aside from one cringe-worthy voice-acting scenes, is an absolute masterpiece: [Zankyou no Terror](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror)

Another that is also a masterpiece, but thankfully did not go under the radar, but deserves more attention: [Death Parade](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade)

Another great one would be a prequel; whilst it had a very weird first episode that had almost no link to the entirety of the show, it managed to deliver a very great standalone story: [Ga-Rei: Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4725/Ga-Rei:_Zero)

Those are my Top 3 Picks.

Probably:

>> ARTICLE
I guess I can't include Baccano since it's technically 16 episodes.

1. Usagi Drop (10) - Warm fuzzie incarnate.
2. Barakamon (10) - Somewhat similar and just barely inferior to Usagi Drop. Handa and Naru some of the best characters in anime!
3. ...Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (9) - Had to decide between this, Nichibros, and Anohana. I feel the characters have more to them than Nichibros and I guss Nozaki-kun's hilarity trumps Anohana's cryfest.

or alternatively, if Ultimate doesn't count due to 50 min episodes, then 3 = Death Parade. But I think it counts. I'm counting it.

I think there's something to be said about a show that can tell a full story in a short 13 episodes. If you can keep it sharp, dense, and engaging and make maximum use of screen time you can have something as epic and powerful as Madoka unfold in a mere 4 hours, and honestly that's where a lot of the impact comes from.

3. [Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21843/Shingeki_no_Bahamut:_Genesis)

Interesting notes about Maoyuu: It feels a lot like [Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou) in that it simultaneously places focus on the main characters' relationship and the mundane but realistic-feeling fantasy world instead of action. To add to this feel, the two main characters are voiced by Jun Fukuyama and Ami Koshimizu, the VAs for Lawrence and Holo respectively from Spice and Wolf. Additionally, the story was written by Mamare Touno, who later went on to write [Log Horizon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon). So if you've watched either of those two anime and liked what you saw, go ahead and give Maoyuu a try. If you haven't watched either of those, **WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? JUST DO IT!**

TL;DR Maoyuu slightly fills the hole that the end of Spice and Wolf Season 2 left in me.

If you haven't watched this show, well move it to the top of your list and watch it immediately. The art style takes a small amount of time to get used to but it is truly a beautiful show, one of those that transcends genres and stands by itself as a work of art

This, Death Note and Kill la Kill are my top 3. They cover like everything good about anime.

the music though. so catchy and upbeat.

Oh I loved the art style instantly, truly great and perfect for the show.

Agreed. The combination of Taiyo Matsumoto's writing and story with Yuasa's brilliant direction is pretty perfect.

Too it's not region free or at least A+B as some of their other stuff.

Guess I'm sticking with my Japanese Blu-Ray box for now.

EDIT: Turns out it may actually be A+B and just mislabeled. Haven't seen it so I can't know for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Okay I've never paid attention to something like this before but that doesn't affect an American, does it?
>> ARTICLE
No, NA is Region A and EU is B. This turned out to be A+B anyway, so there shouldn't be a problem for either.
>> ARTICLE
It arrived yesterday and it was A+B for me

Oh, it just said "Region: Region A/1" on Amazon.
>> ARTICLE
Got my copy from Amazon, can confirm that it says A+B on the box.

I bought it from Rightstuf if that changes anything, though I doubt it would.

If it really is A+B then it's most likely just mislabeled on the linked site.

Mmm. As an Australian I was stoked. I have a region-free player regardless, but it was still unexpected.

[Madman will have a B region Blu Ray out in August.](http://www.madman.com.au/catalogue/view/33118/ping-pong-bluray)
>> ARTICLE
Never mind. Marathoned it today. Totally worth it. Unlike other sports shows which always rely on the power of the team, friendship, special abilities... 

You've got that. You need talent to be good. But it's a story about the hard work, ruthless world, and most importantly, the fact that humans can change.

I started out hating some of the characters, but in the end you're reminded that everyone's people. I thought I saw the ending coming, but it threw me for a very satisfying twist.

Overall, it managed to cram a *lot* of content into this short period of time, and did it really well. No need to spend time looking at the pretty scenery and the huge animation budget. 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone have any idea what the blu-ray box contains? I've been waiting to see if it's like a "collector's box" or if it's just a normal blu-ray edition.

Glad I waited though, seems like Amazon's copy is cheaper than buying through Funimation. 
>> ARTICLE
I got it. It's just the standard blu ray case with a cardstock sleeve, like most of Funimation's releases.

Thanks! Was hoping for a collector's edition (besides the 250$ JP one) but I'm still definitely picking this up.

Good thing I have some money left.

Only $45 canadian for shipping and the whole series in bluray HD! This is a definite buy for me, no questions asked. Most popular shows in Blu ray usually exceed $100, hopefully this more reasonable pricing schemes becomes more popular.

"great"
>> ARTICLE
Did you hear it? How did they handle Kong? Still Chinese or... else?
>> ARTICLE
yeah it's still in Chinese but they got someone else to re-dub it..
>> ARTICLE
Kong's English VA is a major downgrade if you actually speak Chinese. I didn't think his pronunciation or tones were all that great so I didn't understand some of what he was saying without the English subs. His coach sounded like a native speaker so there were no issues there. I guess the integrity of the language barrier with his team is still intact so it could be worse.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's because I don't speak Chinese, but I actually liked Kong's dub performance. I don't know; it sounded professional to me. Plus, it's not like the guy was half-assing it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't want to sound overly negative because the dub as a whole is perfectly solid, with the rest of the performances ranging from competent to pretty good. The intent of having Kong's character speaking Chinese to highlight his isolation and gradually learning to speak Japanese (or in the dub's case English) as part of his growth as a character remains and is still conveyed perfectly well. And honestly, the existence of the dub doesn't take away what I consider to be a very good original audio version.

But believe me when I say that a lot of his Chinese line readings are very stilted and wooden in addition to being inaccurate. The most likely situation is that they cast a young guy of Chinese descent who was probably born in or has spent most of his life living in the US. It's not surprising that his Chinese isn't amazing and his English performance is much better. But nobody making the casting decisions or working in the booth spoke enough Chinese to realize his shortcomings. So yeah, somebody was definitely half-assing it in that regard. It's genuinely a bad performance and wasn't a good casting choice. But the fact that all of the non-Chinese speaking characters mispronounce Wenge's name ("wen-gay" instead of "wen-guh") tells me that nobody cared or knew enough to correct that aspect of the dub. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the Chinese VAs spoke slower than they could have, but I haven't watched much Chinese TV. Just surprised that I can keep up with it since I'm a Cantonese speaker.

Kong's VA in the English dub... yeah, not exactly impressed.
>> ARTICLE
I can't complain about the speed of dialog in the original because I'm not a native speaker. Admittedly I kept up with it better than I do when I try and watch Chinese TV. It had good performances and the dialog was pretty solidly written too. I had a good chuckle when Kong called Peco , Chinese insults are great.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I like the dialogue - I don't understand Japanese, but the Chinese writing seemed pretty good. It sounds natural overall. 
>> ARTICLE
I just watched this the other week. Such a good show!
>> ARTICLE
Huge fan of the manga and the live action movie, and of Yuasa in general, but I wound up watching only the first episode. It seemed like Peco's voice actor leaned too hard into annoying, while Kubozuka Yousuke managed to balance that with juuuust enough charisma to keep you going through the rougher early parts of his character arc. The movie's speedier pace also helped.

May have to give this a second chance, but if you dug it, it's also well worth checking out the live action movie. Viz released it here a few years back.
>> ARTICLE
God damnit, I envy you. Been to a store just this week end and there were a lot of rather new shows with a German dub, like Tokyo Ghoul, Terror in Tokyo, Psycho Pass, Nisekoi, and Aldnoah Zero, but sadly no Ping Pong. And as far as I know nothing has been announced yet.

Fuck. I just might buy this even though I know I'm not going to have a bluray player to play it.

It's actually really cheap right now for a blu-ray (a complete one no less) isn't it? (Amazon currently has it at $34 for me)

So I was at a funimation panel at a con this summer where they showed a trailer for this anime. I have never heard of it before. Nobody in the panel seemed to be very interested or excited about it at all. The animation style looked very... Different? Doesn't look like anything I have watched before. It seriously worth my time? It just looks so bizarre with some seriously hideous character designs, but I am oddly intrigued.. 
>> ARTICLE
> animation style

What is so different about the animation style. A lot of people point that out, but I don't see anything different. It always surprises me that people notice a different animation style, but not the art style. Maybe the style isn't so unusual.
>> ARTICLE
People mid use the term animation style when they mean art style.  Everyone thinks the art style is unique and a fair amount find it unappealing.  I would still argue that it has a unique animation style with its choice of shots and angles.
>> ARTICLE
> shots and angles

Aren't those more stylistic devices of a director and less animation?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I suppose those are also styles.  Is it even possible to have unique animation then?
>> ARTICLE
Well, nowadays traditional animations entirely drawn by hand are fairly unique. Or how about animations with [oil paintings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5ih1IRIRxI). So called [paint-on-glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint-on-glass_animation) animation.
>> ARTICLE
It is definitely underrated. It's good. I love it. If you like anime that's different then this is for you.
>> ARTICLE
>underrated

Lol, no, not at all. And consindering what it is, it is not even unknown. It's a niche anime, can't really get popular, especially in a community where SAO is hot shit.
>> ARTICLE
So you mean it is less popular than it should be.  Underrated works fine in this sense.  It is underrated by the masses who miss judge it before watching.  Or would you prefer the term undervalued.  
>> ARTICLE
Calling something with a [score of 8.69](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_The_Animation) from 25'000 user underrated or unpopular just doesn't sound right to me. Undervalued is defintiely a better term. Even the [discussion threads at the time](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/search?q=ping+pong+discussion&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) were fairly popular. It is ofcourse quickly dismissed by a lot of people, but at least they have heard of it, so it's not unpopular. Yeah, I think undervalued is really the right word.
>> ARTICLE
Well if you look at its popularity on Mal it isn't that high.  Outside of the small community here on reddit I don't think it is nearly as big. Personally I would consider something that is critically acclaimed but not widely popular to fit under the term underrated but for better under the term undervalued.
>> ARTICLE
Okay. Whatever you wanna describe it as ya nerd
>> ARTICLE
It starts off quick, and the art style is clearly intentional. It's cartoony in a way that makes it feel very realistic - deformed proportions with movement make a 2D work feel more 3D. 

I rather like it, 10 minutes in. Certainly beats Hibike! Euphonium and its really slow plot for me. There's so much action that the art style doesn't bother you as much. Watch an episode and see how it goes.
>> ARTICLE
One of the best anime to come out last year. It did win the Television Show of the Year award at the Tokyo Anime Awards Festival.

Fantastic characters, fantastic soundtrack, and while the art style may be weird and even kinda ugly at first it really grows on you.

It's easily my favorite anime of 2014. Legit masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
One of my four 10s, it'll stand the test of time easily

Partially because it *doesn't* appeal to certain art styles/themes. Probably going to be marathoning it these next two days.

Does the blu ray fix the deformed foreskin art style?
>> ARTICLE
Whether I agree with you if that's the way the story should have played out not, it was definitely another great write-up. Very interesting analogy with sports fans and people's "dream profession." I really liked the breakdowns of all the ingredients and identification of which one each character lacked as well.

I won't ever call Ping Pong The Animation the best anime out there because that depends heavily on the personal experience of the viewer, but it remains the most impactful one to me. I personally relate it to basketball, the sport in which I played my whole life until my last high school season ended. There are just so many parallels between my experience with the sport I loved and Ping Pong The Animation. I could ramble on about them but I think I'll focus more on the parallels I saw with Peco specifically, since he is the character you are more critical of in terms of how realistic he is.

I can definitely see why you wanted a ending with a more brutal reality, I know why first-hand based on how my "career" in basketball ended. Growing up I was pretty similar to Peco in some regards. Playing basketball in elementary school all the way through middle school I was was always one of the best on the team, just as Peco was the best player when he was young. I had pretty big expectations, anyone involved with the basketball scene in my town probably knew who I was (it was a fairly small town). Where I differ from Peco is I never quit on the sport and I was always playing it and getting better, hell my parents pretty much forced me to practice all the time. Long story short I never ended up being that good and never played that many minutes on my high school team.

A close friend of mine at the time reminds me of Peco in his later stages. After what were disappointing freshman and sophomore basketball years for him he ended up quitting basketball and not even trying out for the team when he was a junior. After that he started smoking and got a little chubby, but decided he would try out again when his senior year (when I was also a senior). Eerily similar to Peco right? I remember how we all laughed at how out of breath he got when he first started playing again, but by the end of the season he had beaten me out of my spot. Unlike him I played basketball all four seasons of the year, my parents pushed me to play AAU basketball in the offseason and meet with different basketball trainers for 1-on-1 practice. I dedicated so much time of my life to that game but it didn't manifest into anything, meanwhile the hero (my friend) defied all logic. And just to clarify, my friend was playing better than I was and my coach was perfectly justified in playing him over me. By any measure I was pretty awful, though I doubt my parents will ever come to understand that. I think they're still upset over how much money they wasted funding my career for it to only get wasted by my coach not playing me. Alright, now that's enough of the blogging.

I'll admit it's not a perfect comparison, it's not like my friend was the star of the team or anything, but the similarities are there. I don't see what Peco ended up doing as completely unrealistic, and more importantly I don't see it as a cop out for having a happy ending. The way Peco's career turned out doesn't suddenly take away the message shown through various harsh realities in the show. It doesn't change that most of the characters in the show failed. In some cases there are people out there that are like Peco, but most of us are like Sakuma and Egami. It's really more of a happy ending for Smile, and *if anything* the show is being disingenuous to people who are like Smile (I don't believe this, but I think it would be more justified to believe this). What I mean by that is people who are "robots" and don't know what they should be doing to find happiness may not ever be saved by a hero like Smile did. For some reason you seem to think the happy ending is based around Peco, but really it's a happy ending for Smile. At least that's what I thought. I do very much appreciate the different perspective you come from though, as I've already read a ton of Ping Pong write-ups.
>> ARTICLE
I actually found a LOT of room for self-insertion in this show, and by the end I was surprised myself that the magic hadn't happened and there wasn't a real, special connection. It's hard to explain, and I almost got into personal stuff with this post, but a couple paragraphs in decided it wasn't worth anything and left it out (plus this was already long enough). Suffice it to say, due to multiple personal experiences, the severity of the consequences wasn't satisfactory to me- I didn't see people really get rekt hard by investing their life in Ping Pong- the very thing Smile mentions as not being understandable in the early episodes.

I have a similar history with wrestling to what you had to basketball, except my parents were poor when I was young and lower middle class when I was in high school, and had 5 kids. I was in the middle, and if you know much about birth order stereotypes, the middle kid is generally the one overlooked, and who develops largely in response to that fact (learning attention-seeking attributes and whatnot). None of us kids had much money spent on us, but with me in particular if it wasn't something handed down to me from my brothers, or a free program that they were attending as well, I didn't get to have/do it. That said, I still put in way more hours pre-high school, and went the extra mile in my training.

I don't know how things were for basketball, but with Christmas break being right in the middle of the season, wrestlers treat that time as a "turn it up to 11" training period: the practices are meant to be the opposite of a vacation, and you were the only person at the family meals who was on a strict diet. My freshman and sophomore years I made major improvements from these sessions/practices. The match before Christmas break my freshman year I faced a kid (who was probably older than me, it's just my term) who beat me by 10 points- a slaughter by all accounts. I faced that same kid the last match of the year and lost by 1 point- on a call that I still disagree with, and the coaches were none too happy about either. Regardless, it was good to see I'd improved markedly. My sophomore year showed more improvement, I was started to head places.

My Junior year over Christmas break I tore a ligament in my left ankle, which definitely hindered my ability to participate fully. I still went to practice, the trainer just taped it up before practice each day until it got better. Unfortunately I compensated for my week leg too much, and ended up putting too much stress on my right knee, since I was already right legged and used it more. Now, you have to understand, wrestling necessarily makes you hurt all the time. It's normal to have cuts, scraps, burns and whatnot on the outside, as well as various internal owies. You learn to just ignore it, because it's always there- sort of like how your nose blocks your vision, but you never really notice it until you start thinking about it. After it'd been the same pain for a week or two I said something to the coaches, but neither they nor I thought much of it.

By the time I did realize it was something I should be worried about, the end of the season was coming up, and my second half hadn't shown the improvement that the previous years had. The last thought on my mind however, was backing down to preserve my health. I pushed harder, agitated it more, and on the first match of the district qualifiers took a shot and felt something in my knee tear. I lost that match, somehow won the next, and I can't remember what happened in the 3rd, but I think I won that too because I felt like I always got 5th place. Not that any of that mattered, I had wrestled my last match and gotten an inconsequential placing. On the bus home my knee filled with fluid- it was like a water balloon the way it jiggled. Goon that I was I thought it was funny and shook it around and poked it and stuff. I missed most of Track that year (or was it all of it?), and while the doctor said the fluid should get re-absorbed it didn't, so he drained it out with a syringe. It filled back up, they drained it again and then shot some steroids in, which is basically a patch job that I use to this day. 

My knee filled back up a couple times, they did the same patch job. They did an MRI and an X-ray and maybe some other tests, couldn't figure out why it was still messed up, and 6 years after the fact I still can't stand on my feet for several hours at a time, or do pretty much any physical activity except for biking and swimming (and I HATE swimming). I've said all that to say this: not taking injuries seriously is dangerous, and can cause damage that you never recover from. It's not until you lose something you can't get back that you realize how much you depended on it, and therefore how safe you should have kept it.

"Well that's a touching anecdote, but..."

No. I've been competitive in many things throughout my life. I have detailed anecdotes for a lot of things, and I know how to reconcile my own case study with the overall body of data. While my wrestling and knee injury story most closely pairs up with Sakuma, (while I was good for high school, I was by no means good enough. Wrestling was going to end my Senior year one way or another) and his fatal flaw, my piano career more closely resembles Kazama- where unnecessary pressure of it kills any enjoyment for it. While I still have a part of my soul that only music can express, my own piano playing is like poison to my ears, and other people complimenting it does not help. If you look back in my reddit post history you'll see that a couple months ago I was posting articles to Heroes of the Storm, and in the first line I would generally put "the #1 HL support main," because I was. I spent almost 3 years of my life full time (and by full time I don't mean 40 hours a week, I mean 60-100, literally) pursuing pro gaming, and that ended in failure. There I think I resembled Kong, where I just had 0 support both in real life and with my digital compadres, and eventually collapsed (that's still a very fresh wound, and what I estimate to be the reason why Ping Pong hurt while I was going through it, it was seriously depressing at some points, just because of hurt it was dredging up unintentionally).

My point is, there is a permanent and impactful cost to the failed pursuit of these ambitions. I am permanently physically crippled (albeit, in the smallest sense of the word) because of my dedication to wrestling. I am permanently musically crippled because of my pressure-driven relationship with the piano. I am permanently professionally crippled because of my dedication to gaming. It's not just losing more time than you like on a hobby that's at risk. Now, I don't let those disabilities hold me down in the dirt, but they do hold me back from the things I enjoy most (which adds up to be a lot), and the recovery process to get to that point is easier said than done. Not everybody makes it either.

Bringing it back to your story, the characterization of Ping Pong was fairly on point, and people like your friend and Peco exist plenty enough, I can think of a couple offhand in my own life (I don't mean to diminish the value of your story, just explain why it's "errily similar"). That's both realistic and going to improve popular appeal. The problem isn't in characterization, but in the plot that happens to those characters.

Finally, Smile's happy ending is up to author preference imo. What I mean by that is it can be realistic and meaningful to give him a happy ending or a sad ending. Just because something is *improbable* doesn't mean its *implausible.* Are people going to let you down? Absolutely, so having Peco not respond to Smile's hopes could happen in any number of ways. But sometimes friends come through in reality, not just in shows, and do terrific things that cynical people like us never expect. There's much good that can be said of the message "even if you don't fly high you can still get by" that Peco's ending provides. There's also cathartic merit in not giving him a good match with Peco, and as a result never becoming a beautiful butterfly: socially capable of coaching kids, catching up with an old rival, or getting a girlfriend, and generally having a pleasant life while maintaining his quiet personality.

I don't know why everything I say gets so long these days.

I suppose the story in Ping Pong The Animation was never meant to demonstrate the consequences of trying, but rather overcoming the consequences of trying. And that's just where it inherently fails in your eyes. In the end all the characters have at least become content with how their Ping Pong playing careers played out. I guess it comes down to whether or not this message worked for you. When I talk about my basketball career ending in my last year of high school, that is something that just happened last year. I actually watched the show during my season. The wounds are fresh, but I'm pretty much completely content with my sports playing days. Its uplifting message really helped me at the time, but when a show has an uplifting message end off on and the viewer isn't moved by that message I can see why it could be annoying.

So I have to ask, how much does the demise of these potential "dream professions" still bother you today? It would certainly be nice to make a living off of gaming or playing the piano (if you enjoy playing the piano that is). But for me when it comes to basketball I pretty much always knew it wasn't going to be something I would make a living off of. I only lost pride from my failure, while you lost more than that. So we differ a bit there, I can see why Ping Pong was less effective for you. 

What struck me the most from what you said was this: "Now, I don't let those disabilities hold me down in the dirt, but they do hold me back from the things I enjoy most." This is essentially what Ping Pong The Animation is about. For me, I still absolutely love basketball. I go to games, I watch it all the time and I'll occasionally play some pick-up. Just like the characters in the show I feel like I overcame the consequences that come with trying. Maybe things would have turned out different if I didn't have asthma or didn't get strep throat during the season (I also had knee problems but it didn't really affect me on the court due to adrenaline and painkiller, which might be why I'm okay with Peco being able to play through his knee injuries). Despite that I can still move on from it peacefully and without regret. It's a happy ending, and maybe an overly optimistic one, but it's an ending I can relate to. And that just goes back to personal experience being such a huge factor in the enjoyment of this show.

Also I'm curious as the what game it was you tried to become a pro at and how it went for you. My younger brother is trying to be a professional gamer so I was just wondering.
>> ARTICLE
I think where our analyses differ is in popular appeal vs. focus on select individuals. For example, around Christmas I started my physical anime & manga collection. Those are not cheap things, and I am not a rich man, so I hunted for deals like crazy, watched prices on a several series for *months* and negotiated already low-priced people down further. If you were to look at a standard bell curve distribution (like you see in commercials for TrueCar, if you use Hulu), I consistently was the guy who paid the least and got "the deal of a lifetime." Why? Because I'm wired to be excessively competitive and try 100% on pretty much everything.

That's the type of people I'm concerned about, who have a similar drive and are prone to taking things too far without a realization for the consequences. That generally leads to them being high achievers, so it pays out a most of the time, and with that success comes that attitude of "whatever does go wrong I'll be able to handle it." It's not until something is forever lost that they realize otherwise. Is it a lot of people? No, but they're important to me nonetheless.

I started with League of Legends, and was a founding theorycrafter (BlueNoseReindeer) of the site Cloth5, which got mentioned on LCS a couple weeks after launch, several times afterwards, and eventually (after I left the game) became a private consulting something or 'nother. Launch was in season 3, and I quit the game some time mid-season 4 (patch 4.10 sounds about right). Unfortunately they only paid us writers once, and other attempts to monetize my content elsewhere were met with an abrupt end to communications that anyone in e-sports learns to get used to (and hate). Nobody tells you no (if you have X qualifications), they just lead you on and then suddenly don't return messages.

Heroes of the Storm was the game that I shone even better in, ranking as high as #9 on the NA leaderboard at one point. By the time I quit I was about #50, but still #1 support more months than not, Blizzard just decided to castrate my role so that it was pretty useless in SoloQ. There's also a distinct lack of popular interest in support play that makes streaming generally unfeasible. I was in some big tournaments with team play, and we placed 4th in NA in a major tournament (our team's first together) with all the top teams, but getting 5 people to stay together is like trying to nail jello to a wall. Writing once again proved too difficult to monetize. I did get to meet Voyboy, play on his team in a publicity match, and we're on a first name basis, which is cool. But it doesn't put any bread on the table.

If your younger brother is serious about it, tell him that being good is easy compared with being able to generate interest in that goodness that equates to money. If he's still in high school I'd say it's fine to spend all of his free time on it, and sacrifice things like sports and clubs to do it, but definitely have a backup plan. And fun doesn't exist outside of the game- you don't have time for other hobbies, except reading books that will in some way increase your skill in the game or your ability to monetize it (like video editing, a skill I really wish I had). It's not something you treat as "oh I do X work and see how it works out" that's fine for testing, but if you're actually going to succeed you have to put every second into it. There's also a certain type of person that can work with that type of 24/7 relationship, but many can't. If he's not wired that way, I wouldn't even bother, it's not something that "love of the game" will fix, it doesn't take that long for that love to turn to hate if the relationship is something more intense than you're naturally capable of doing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, what you are saying completely makes sense. There really isn't anything else I feel the need to comment on. Thanks for the well thought out post and replies.

I'm always interested in the lives of people that are trying to be great at something like gaming because those people are chasing their dreams and I admire that. My brother dreams of becoming a top player in Smash Bros and our family is in complete support of him. It's probably a long shot that he ever makes a living on it because it's a smaller but growing community where only the very best make enough money to do it full-time. He does spend so much time on it and he goes to as many tournaments as he can so I hope for the best for him. 
>> ARTICLE
> our family is in complete support of him

Glad to hear it, and to see that his aneki is looking out for him. Pro gaming leads to fewer and phonier human interactions, keep an eye out for him for when he needs to connect with another human. Even if he doesn't make a living off it, there can still be some rewarding experiences from trying.
>> ARTICLE
> Even if he doesn't make a living off it, there can still be some rewarding experiences from trying.

Definitely, and this has already shown to be true. He's not the most sociable person but he's made a ton of friends and connections from getting involved in that kind of community.

Thanks for letting me know.

Cool writeup! One critique would be that the transitions between sentences and paragraphs are kind of choppy.

e.g:1st and 2nd paragraph,"The fourth ingredient is love of the game- intrinsic motivation. This is necessary to adapt faster than your opponent, and to innovate."

Your metaphor with the relationship is gold though!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the feedback, I'll pay more attention to that next time through. However, these are more or less rough drafts, so there will always be quality control issues like that. That one in particular was probably because I wrote part of those paragraphs then came back and fleshed them out a second time- so it wasn't all one creative flow. I try to proofread, but you miss stuff when it's something you recently wrote, and you're partially seeing what you *think* you said instead of what's actually on the page. Anyways, I'll be thinking of solutions, just don't have one right now.
>> ARTICLE
Props on the write-up. I too was moved by Ping Pong The Animation and urge anybody who hasn't seen it yet to go watch it! I think anybody who has ever had a dream that didn't quite pan out will appreciate the deeper themes presented in Ping Pong. The art might put some people off but if you are looking for a short series with outstanding direction, well developed characters, and a superb soundtrack, look no further. And then go watch Yuasa's other works too.

just wondering, did you actually read their write-up? they didn't seem particularly "moved" by it.

Everything I know about sports I learned from sports anime and manga.* Seriously, I knew nothing about baseball but after Cross Game, Diamond no Ace, Rookies, and One Outs, I have a pretty solid grasp on the rules. Diamond no Ace probably helped the most. Slam Dunk felt like an education in basketball, and Haikyu made me realize that there was a real depth to the sport of volleyball. Same goes for Ping Pong, Baby Steps, and even Eyeshield 21.

Hikaru no Go taught me about Go, and Bakuman taught me about manga. Also, I learned little about historical events (esp. 7 warring states period China) from historical manga.

*With the exception of hockey... I am Canadian.

Initial D taught me about cars while also showing that automatic cars are shitty and that you should go manual all the way.

Historical Anime showed me different sides of Japan, China, and Korea from all sorts of eras, even if supernatural, fantasy and such. War based ones allowed me to 'fill in the blanks' with what wasn't taught in school, even if fictional. The setting and the way characters acted was enough to imagine.

Space Brothers showed a side of space travel, slice-of-life and such that you get a crash course into how being an astronaut is really like. Maybe not fully, just enough to grasp the idea of things as if you're taking a basic level class or similar.

Jormungand and Black Lagoon both showing how brutal our world is when it comes to weapon and war. Tons of research was done for Jormungand that it shouldn't be underestimated. It's the Lord of War for the Anime world that shouldn't be over-looked. All that knowledge about weapons and war......Insane.

All the Anime work with one another that you basically loosely learn the Japanese language, scenery, habits, customs, cultural things, environmental norms (Cicadas), festivals, music styles, and the author's way of life. You can learn lots when you pay attention to various Anime. The historical bits as well, the scenery, and etc taken from real world context spun into a fictional world. All the little and big things that the author but into the anime by taking their experiences by exaggerating it into a fictional enjoyable world we can enjoy. Their life-style we can view with tons of research added.

There's just too much to note so I'll leave it at that.

Oh man, probably any sports anime, except for Kuroko Basketball because I play basketball, but like Ace of Diamond, Yowamushi and Haikyuu!! Taught me positions and rules and how hard the sport is even if it looks simple.

While I didn't watch the anime, reading Bakuman taught me a lot about the anime and manga industry, and specifically Jump and their rankings.

Sports manga taught me a lot about their respective sports and how they worked at a competetive level, like all the details about aces and climbers and things from Yowapeda.

But most importantly, Death Note taught me to not only to always plan for your opponents plan, but also to make that plan a plan planning against the plan they planned in response to your plan planning against their plan.

Yakitate!! Japan.  I learned tons about breadmaking technique, history, even local Japanese foods.  The show is silly, and much of it impossible, but most of the basic stuff behind it makes sense.  The show is also awesome, impossible to explain yet everyone I know who's watched it has enjoyed it.

Fullmetal Alchemist taught me lots of things I had no knowledge of, particurly alchemy. I've never understood what it was until FMA helped out, with the rule of equivalent exchange, the philosopher's stone, it's fake but in a way it IS real (people were really trying to make a philosopher's stone, to avoid equivalent exchange, thus make gold out of shit). Beside that, I now know the seven deadly sins and the ingredients a human is made up of
>> ARTICLE
The really ironic thing about alchemy is that atomic physics makes it very straightforward. Use a particle accelerator.

The problem is, we have also learned that energy and matter are convertible at a fixed rate of exchange; e=mc^2

Which means that you can convert lead into gold- or indeed any other element into pretty much any other element. It's just going to cost so much energy that it's not actually worth doing for practical mass production of that element.
>> ARTICLE
True, there is a chemistry-wise "inequivalent exchange" in the fact that after reaction a product has gained or lost mass due to energy being converted or vice versa respectively, however you can't just say that out of nowhere new atoms are produced so that you can make one gold atom out of a single lead atom (without 3 protons as end product, you know. That's real inequality). I do not know the specific reaction, but since gold is 79 and lead is 82 it probably involves electrons and protons/neurons. Eventually, the sum of the amount of particles or the sum of the amount of protons would be equal on both sides, despite the change in mass. I think in alchemy it's more like trying not to be bound by these rules of nature, I could be wrong since I don't know a lot about it, but that's what I make up from what I've learned
Edit: I mean it involves the splitting off or the collision with protons,neurons or electrons since a nuclear reaction is bound to be involved with them ;)

>"Ping Pong is no sports anime, but a story about characters." 

>A line that starts nearly every Ping Pong review, and it is complete horse post-chew grass. This show is everything a sports anime aims to be. Though often derided, the sports genre has always been firmly about friendship, overcoming obstacles, and reaching your potential. The Shounen Show for people who are "meh" on the whole swords and lazer beam thing. 

Thank you! Whenever I see someone say that re: Ping Pong I get the distinct impression they don't actually watch that many sports anime. Which is fine, it's not everyone's thing, but don't make sweeping generalizations about how this is so different from all other sports anime without a passing familiarity. 

Having said that, what makes Ping Pong special to me is *how* it's told. The writing is so tight, and the parallels between the past and the narrative present are almost as beautiful as the direction itself. The visual metaphors for each character are just gorgeous, and especially Smile's robot segments are an absolute joy to behold.
>> ARTICLE
I like to look through reviews on series from all the major sites, and at least 7/10 started with the "It's not sports!" style opening. SO I thought to poke fun a bit. :P

Usually these pieces will be pretty focus, in order to keep the timing/message correct. But I could go on for days about how great the music, shots, transitions, lighting! oh god the lighting is so beautiful.

Glad you enjoyed. :)

OH believe me, I [noticed.](http://i.imgur.com/8mvk3.gif)

Mind Game and Kick-heart are the only things of his I haven't seen I think.

If you want a sneak peek at Mind Game, you can watch [this love scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtLJhfQCTy0). Then imagine the entire movie is that, but in magnificently different ways.

>> ARTICLE
While I haven't seen Ping Pong, I understand it's mix of 2D art and CG has made some people not want to watch it. Aku no Hana is another adaptation with a "watchability" problem due to rotoscoping, but at the same time it only covers about half the manga. Considering Ping Pong is a 5 volume manga from 1996, I wonder if it's able to cover everything with an 11 episode one cour.
>> ARTICLE
It most definitely does cover everything. I really liked Aku no Hana's art style as well, off putting but perfect for the aesthetic that they wanted.
>> ARTICLE
Not only does it cover everything, it actually adds to the story. Kong Weng and Ryu Kazama are seriously underdevelopt compared to the anime and the manga is lacking all the metaphorical scenes. Overall it's pretty damn [faithful](http://imgur.com/a/7OWxQ).
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is a great show because Yuasa is an amazing director, and the original author of the manga Taiyo Matsumoto is amazing too. Their sensibilities are well suited, and while I like the Tekkon Kinkreet film, it's hard to imagine anyone managing to translate Matsumoto's very idiosyncratic art better than Yuasa.

The source material is strong; it has top notch character writing, powerful visual metaphors, and doesn't overstay its welcome. What Yuasa specifically brings to the table are a few original sequences, like the deeply emotional [karaoke scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i93vXUKqnI), and a good sense of how to fool the viewer into thinking that some of the more static scenes are visually dynamic. Ping Pong was by all accounts a very rushed production (and I do think that it shows it at times), but Yuasa's usage of manga style panelling allows them to use more limited character animation while providing something interesting for the viewer to see at every point. The show did use the limited resources it had well, as the most important sequences like the final Ping Pong match have much more full and interesting movement. The time constraints did force Yuasa to storyboard every episode himself (if you've seen Shirobako, you know that's quite an undertaking) because he didn't think he could properly explain his vision to other artists. However, I think it ultimately led to a more cohesive and consistent product. 

For more on the show's production check out this [interview](http://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/delivering-quality-on-a-tight-schedule-an-interview-with-ping-pong-art-director-aymeric-kevin-101497.html) with Ping Pong's art director, Aymeric Kevin. I think their use of color scripts is another reason that the show worked so well.
>> ARTICLE
Tekkon Kinkreet - LOOOOVE this show.

I didn't know that the karaoke scene was an original, that's pretty awesome. 

I really like comparing Kill la Kill and Ping Pong, as the first big "low budget" offering from a new studio. One aimed for grandeur and used sloppy editing/animation to get it, the other focused on a really simple, small scope story. That plus seeing Yuasa vs his old student Imaishi is pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
This is the best thread I've read in a while. 

Great job OP, great use of gifs (the Peco playing his friend Smile is one of my favorite scenes in anime). 

God this show is fantastic.

Thanks! Look forward to more, as I move through my Directors. I already have a Monogatari piece written, waiting for when I reach Shinbo.

Great writeup!

Excellent show! Glad you did a feature on it.
>> ARTICLE
It really bothers me that you English speaking people apparently don't know what a Charakterdrama (character drama) is. A drama focusing on characters. That's what Ping Pong is and the sport setting is excellent suited to portray character development.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how to respond to this.... You use racism to mock people, and act like we do not understand what a character drama is... 

Are you just trolling? Do you think "Charakterdrama" is a widely recognized genre tag? Do I not mention 8-20 times that this is about the characters? Does the central focus on Ping Pong, its skill, styles, training, competition, and relevance, not count for anything? 
>> ARTICLE
It is an widely recognized genre tag in German and the words just translate so well into English that I am surprised your language seems to lack vocabulary to describe this very kind of a drama. In no thread about Ping Pong that I read, did anyone use such a word to discribe this anime, which confused me, because it's the perfect discription. I mean, yet again, you wrote a rely elaborate recommandation for this any, but you don't even use the word drama. I'm just surprised.


I do think calling Ping Pong a sport-anime is right, but it's only the secondary nature of the story.

You probably got some problems to work on if you think this is racism or trolling.
>> ARTICLE
> you English speaking people

Judging based on Race or affiliation...

> Charakterdrama (character drama)

In fact we DO have a term for it, you use it right there.

> you don't even use the word drama. 

Because the series doesn't use drama to move the story, nor build around tension inherent to characters in order to create a dramatic moment. The series uses Sport to move the story, and tension is related to skill and determination towards said Sport.

You are perfectly fine to think of this as a Character Drama, but the way you argue your point is so poorly done that you will receive backlash on it.

I didn't care about sports anime till I watched Ippo. If you haven't tried it yet, Haikyuu!! is also really good this season but unfortunately, just really started picking up steam at around episode 11. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll always upvote a comment about Ippo. I started the series thinking I'd hate it like every other sports anime and it ended up being in my top three favorite fighting anime of all time. 
>> ARTICLE
I hadn't binged a series that hard since who knows when. I'm kind of disgusted at how fast I went through the whole thing then was all depressed cause it was over. It was such a well rounded series. It was the first sports anime I tried after failing to watch Kuroko. All the character building, the rise from nothing, the comedic timing. It's the perfect sports anime. Kuroko was just... basketball. I did end up watching all of Kuroko and it was pretty alright but it pales in comparison. I've tried some other ones like Diamond no Ace but they just can't match Ippo.

It's ridiculous how hard it is to get some people into Ippo due to its length too. I've just hit chapter 1000 and I'm pissed at myself for not going slower, I want more already.

Considering the shit-ton of praise for NGNL on this subreddit + many other places, I'm scared of what that implies...

Ping Pong, OTOH, was amazing. Before, Hikaru no Go was my favorite sports anime, but now, for me, Ping Pong beats it by a landslide. 
>> ARTICLE
It implies that people have different opinions? :o
>> ARTICLE
Haha, no. I don't mind people having different opinions. It's just that he said that NGNL is good if you like underage ecchi, and I said I'm scared of what that implies because it seems to be praised by fans everywhere. 
>> ARTICLE
But that's not even the main part of the show. I'm watching Ping Pong now and I like it so far, so I'm not even trying to bash on either. It's just funny how certain things seem to be blown up by people as if it's the main focus. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say that something doesn't matter just becasue it isn't the main focus. Imagine a show that stars an extremely sexist worldview, but only every once in a while. Even if it isn't the driving force of the the show, people could still complain that it's sexist.

Yep. I can also understand overlooking its flaws and enjoying the ride, but I don't exactly understand the jump to "best anime of the season".
>> ARTICLE
Like I'd said before, that show is the SAO of that season.

Minus having an extremely shitty protagonist and a multitude of other things that made it completely different. Not saying you have to like NGNL, but it was absolutely not anything like SAO.

With that username I expected you to have more refined taste in characters really
>> ARTICLE
A bit pretentious, but I can't really deny that JoJo has some pretty great characters. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that's taking it a *little* far. At least NGNL doesn't try to make it's premise believable. It's also far less sincere about its pandering and stereotypes.
>> ARTICLE
Let me just point out the fact that its very well animated, has some really great twists when it comes to the episodes about games, is full of references to anime in general, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Using sao as some sort of description is lazy and just goes to show that people lack the intelligence to actually point out real flaws. NGNL isn't a show for everyone so quit hating on it like its sao
>> ARTICLE
> is full of references to anime in general

I don't generally see this as a positive quality.

...Though the one reference that actually made me laugh was the [Ace Attorney](/r/AceAttorney) one.
>> ARTICLE
Its an attribute that many people enjoy, and does a really clever job of subtly referencing them sometimes. If it doesn't float your boat that's fine
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call the references subtle though. Most of them are really direct and just in there to make the fans happy. They seldomly play into the show on more than a very basic level.
>> ARTICLE
Hence my use of the word sometimes. Its nice to see a reference and get the joke/allusion, even if its pretty obvious
>> ARTICLE
Yep, there was very little subtlety in NGNL's references.
>> ARTICLE
No need to get very defensive about NGNL.

Both are featuring similar type of characters dominating a fantasy world, has crazy colours and has a legion of female characters after the MC. If you at the appeal of both series they are very similar.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't give a shit if it was NGNL. Its just stupid how people are now using sao as an adjective. I couldn't care less if you're drawing lines between them, but just leaving it at "its the sao of the season" is pathetic. 
>> ARTICLE
good work ignoring my post. Read them first please.
>> ARTICLE
I read it, and I'm not getting in a reddit argument over sao again. NGNL and sao have some very similar qualities. That doesn't mean sao is a valid form of describing a show. Who the hell says stuff like "its the nge of the season" or "its the school days of the season". This whole entire sao thing arises from the huge circle jerk of how sao is supposedly one of the worst shows ever

Well, No Game No Life wasn't liked because it had a super intricate plot or because of super deep themes. It was liked because it was pure dumb fun, kind of like Kill La Kill. 

Try turning your brain off while watching it, its a lot more fun.
>> ARTICLE
I do agree that there's a ton of random ridiculousness interjected into each episode that is there solely to be entertaining. However, the games in the show are setup to challenge the viewer to try to think one step ahead of Blank. The clues are there and if you're a good enough sleuth, you can figure out how they'll win the games (I'm not a good sleuth fyi lol). Considering this, I'd hardly say turning your brain off will help you enjoy the show anymore than you already have been.
>> ARTICLE
The reason I like the show is because it got a lot of good twists. Its fast paced. The characters are good. The main characters do these ridiculous things that hype me up which is something I really like in Anime. They got good build up making the climaxes feel intense. 

I feel like different animes focus on different feelings they want to express. Some are sad and makes you want to cry. Some are dark where they kill of characters and stuff. Some are happy and makes you want to laugh. And this anime is the typical one that gets you pumped up and really excited. If people are not into that kind of anime then thats fine. Im not into the sad animes or comedy anime unless they are pretty good compared to others in that genre. 
>> ARTICLE
Yah, I totally agree with the "gets you pumped up and really excited". I think its that aspect of NGNL that's most similar to Kill la Kill. 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't really challenge me to think much considering I kind of found the overall victory predictable.
>> ARTICLE
Right, you always know they will win, but its another story if you pause the show after learning about the premise of the game and ponder HOW they will win. 
>> ARTICLE
Really? You knew how he was going to beat the angel?
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they state in the show, Blank always wins. I did enjoy the show though.
>> ARTICLE
Yes the main cgaracters did say that. But its how they win which is important. Its not them spouting some emotional nonsense and getting stronger. Its about them having these well thought out plans using whatever means available.
>> ARTICLE
Never really thought about that honestly. 
>> ARTICLE
> Try turning your brain off while watching it, its a lot more fun.

Oh, I did... Still didn't enjoy it, but that's mostly because I kinda hated the main characters. (I'm neutral on Jibril and those other two whose names I forget.)

The only one I kinda liked was Steph, and she was the one constantly being made out to be an idiot or just generally being harassed (except for those 5 minutes where they showed her competently dealing with the populace and avoiding an uprising of some sort).
>> ARTICLE
I watched both and enjoyed both. They're marketed toward difference audiences. Ping Pong has artistic flair and symbolism and is an overall more mature show than NGNL. NGNL is tropey and campy, but it still provided a different form of entertainment. It's an easier to digest show aimed at an audience who doesn't want to think too much.

That said, I really loved Ping Pong and would highly recommend it to many of my friends.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. I keep trying to decide which of the two shows I liked better, but they're simply too different. They're both really good at what they're trying to do.

This show is so fucking good, and is a perfect example of how you can develop a large number of characters so well in just one season.  This scene showcases that aspect of the show pretty well too.

I think a big part of why this worked is because there was a lot of passage of time throughout the season, so you can actually believe that the changes could occur.

Wow we really do have similar tastes.

I told myself I need to get some suggestions from your list so I scrolled down our shared anime page to your unique animes, and the first thing that caught my eye was Infinite Stratos...

...but that's okay because you also have LOGH and Hikaru no Go, which have been floating around my to do list for a while ;)

IS is mostly a joke. Hikaru no Go is wonderful.

I always like how your style is flexible enough to do stuff like this. It really looks like the original art.

Thanks man! I feel like that's because I haven't developed a strong personal style yet hehe. Btw, for some reason I love it when r/animesketch meets on r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't matter if you don't have one though! This style is definitely more suited towards drawing manga (which is mostly what you do these days), so it's all great. Anyway you've been drawing for more than 4 years I believe? Your style should have already been developed. It's actually very pronounced in your original sketches.

Ah yes, it's also nice to see some "homemade art" on the frontpage among the other professional ones :)

Huh I didn't realize I had a style o__o I'll have to do more original sketches and try to see what you see :)

[Masaaki Yuasa](http://myanimelist.net/people/5068/Yuasa_Masaaki) is a wonderfully creative director and animator and this hopefully means more stuff from him, the anime industry needs it.
He is known for:

[Mind Game,](http://myanimelist.net/anime/875/Mind_Game) his feature film debut. [Trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU4EfF85u60)

[Tatami Galaxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei)

[Kick Heart](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16149/Kick-Heart), the first kickstarted anime. [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXtTMtka5og)

[Kaiba](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3701/Kaiba)

[He also recently made an episode of Adventure Time.](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/adventuretime/video/food-chain-episode.html)

If you can read french more info can probably be found [here](http://www.catsuka.com/news/2014-06-17/science-saru-nouveau-studio-par-masaaki-yuasa-et-eunyoung-choi--plus-opening-d-adventure-time-facon-food-chain)

[Eunyoung Choi](http://myanimelist.net/people/20088/Choi_EunYoung) is an animator and sometimes director. She directed episode 9 of Space Dandy and collaborated on all Masaakis stuff since Kemonozume.
>> ARTICLE
Unless that YouTube episode was uploaded by the official license-holder, then it is against the rules to link to it.

Edit: And reinstated.
>> ARTICLE
This is great news. More Yuasa is exactly what everyone needs.
>> ARTICLE
This is very interesting news. What's also interesting is that the website has everything in English as well as Japanese, and the fact that they have "works" and "clients" tabs, but both are password protected. I'm guessing sometime in the not so distant future they will announce their first project.
>> ARTICLE
I think Choi speaks English?  [Kevin Aymeric](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=117120) is also a Yuasa collaborator. Not to mention, Yuasa directed a recent Adventure Time episode. I doubt the guy speaks much English, but if Kick-Heart and Adventure Time are any indication, he seems into doing things in an unorthodox manner.
>> ARTICLE
Woa, that's pretty great, didn't expect that at all, hope we get more yuasa in the future :)
>> ARTICLE
[OH MY GAH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dA7SC5T99I)
>> ARTICLE
Thus guy seems to be really popular and here I am having not seen any of his works, I seriously need to watch Tatami Galaxy already 
>> ARTICLE
Thats great I loved the Tatami Galaxy. 

Probably a silly question but this just means we're very likely to see more stuff from him right? Or will something else come from this that I'm missing?
>> ARTICLE
I'm so hard right now.  And they're using Kemonozume's "saru" (i.e. [best girl](http://www.veoh.com/watch/v21171195YQHKP5kZ?h1=Kemonozume+-+Monkey+%26+Peach)) as their logo!  Not sure if Yuasa's used that monkey in other works.

Anyway, can't wait to see what they do in the coming years.
>> ARTICLE
This is amazing news. I can't wait. :D The announcement couldn't have come at a better time too, especially after Ping Pong's phenomenal ending.  
>> ARTICLE
Pretty excited about this. Yuasa is always an interesting director to see work.
>> ARTICLE
Science Monkey?
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain in detail the montage at the end of 'mind game' where it is all linking them all together, I picked up on most of it but some of that went over my head..
>> ARTICLE
My question is when are you planning this? September is pretty much filled and I can tell you October going to fill fast (as I'm thinking of doing a Planetes rewatch then or November).

I'd honestly be interested in this, been told to watch it by many people, I really liked Tatami Galaxy, and could be my start into sports anime.

Where is the rewatch calendar ?

On mobile, but it should be on the bottom of the sidebar.

Same on mobile,okay thanks will keep it in mind when i get on pc

I love you for giving Masafu Yokoyama some love
(not enough Hayashi Yuuki for my tastes tho :3)
>> ARTICLE
Yoko Kanno also did a really great job on the Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex OST but I think Yuki Kaijura's work on Kara no Kyoukai is my favourite.  In my opinion it is simply perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Yuki Kajiura's OST for Madoka Magica is absolutely perfect at establishing the right atmosphere and tone for the show.
>> ARTICLE
Also, her work in SAO made the show exponentially better.
>> ARTICLE
Also [Kara no Kyoukai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XwQcXFFVkE).
>> ARTICLE
It's old, but her soundtrack for .Hack//Sign was exceptional. I believe it was her claim to fame work as well
>> ARTICLE
Came here to say this. .Hack//Sign might have been a snore-fest story-wise, but Kajiura's work saved that anime for me. one of the only OSTs I actually bought.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed. She actually composed most of the .Hack main series music IIRC.
>> ARTICLE
She is also doing a really great job with 'Boku Dake ga Inai Machi' this season.
>> ARTICLE
So glad she did the soundtrack for ERaSED this season. Hope she does soundtrack of HF
>> ARTICLE
I would kill for an Emiya Version by Kaijura
>> ARTICLE
HIROYUKI SAWANO

Attack On Titan, Kill La Kill, Guilty Crown, Aldnoah Zero, Gundam Unicorn and Seven Deadly Sins--his work is spacious and epic in scope while meshing rock elements with classic strings and occasionally disjointed melodies.

If there's ever an apocalypse I'd want him to direct the music.
>> ARTICLE
I love his music, but I feel like the animes don't live up to the music. Unicorn came close and maybe Aldnoah. I await the day an anime so epic as his music shall be paired with him.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, the shows he works on are absolutely epic in scale, guess it might just be a matter of personal taste.

I thought his soundtrack work on Kill La Kill and Attack on Titan in particular were a HUGE PART of the reason I enjoyed watching them.
>> ARTICLE
I think we're on the same page, I felt the music carried the show a bit is all.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la kill really lives up to it I feel.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't like it much, didn't finish/can't judge.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. KlK had some of my favorite music out of all of Sawano's work. Especially the way he writes for horns.

I also really liked the Nanatsu no Taizai soundtrack, particularly for [Eri0ne$](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbv4l0HOjOY) and [Gong4N - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNXMhStAlMk). I like the 100Knights theme from Owari no Seraph as well. His name scheme is slightly insane (for most of his work), but there are two versions of 100Knights. One is for Yuu and one for Mikaela.

His stuff for Ao no Exorcist might be his best, though.
>> ARTICLE
I love all of his work, but nothing beats the atmosphere created by MKAlieZ playing at the end of Aldnoah.Zero's first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Blue Exorcist has an amazing soundtrack too. All of Hiroyuki Sawano's compositions are amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
The Attack on Titan track was amazing. It sounds amazing and was extremely versatile at displaying the correct mood. Vogel im Kfig in particular is used in many different scenes masterfully. 
>> ARTICLE
Glad someone said it! :D
>> ARTICLE
I've always liked the **Mushishi** soundtrack. Most of the tracks accentuate the landscape and its general atmostphere beautifully.

Example: 

[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6wyotbVdxc

[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-NRPfEfxl8
>> ARTICLE
was going to comment this, but you beat me to it :) I especially love how each episode has a new ED, just shows the amount of care and effort put into the show, and each one is just awesome! one of my all time faves for sure
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I'd like to point out [Shinen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puLnIQ-plR8) as a personal favorite of mine.
>> ARTICLE
Everything about Mushishi is beautiful, and the soundtrack is a huge part of that. I can't recommend it hard enough.
>> ARTICLE
Just little details like the mushi be animated on a smoother frame rate to give an alien feel... incredible show
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori
>> ARTICLE
[SSY ep.23](/s "-SHUUUN!!!") my god, the music alone gives me chills.
>> ARTICLE
Use of Dvorak's "From the New World Symphony" was genius...I didn't even connect the two until after, but man that soundtrack was on point.

Not to mention that Wareta Ringo probably my favorite OP/ED ever
>> ARTICLE
[Traditional Song of Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1LpZ5I8Iks) is one of my favorite non-OP/ED pieces of soundtrack music of any show.
>> ARTICLE
Oh sweet god, I forgot how good the music in that show was till I re-listened to that.  Gonna have to rewatch sometime now lol
>> ARTICLE
a rewatch is great for Shinsekai as you probably suspect. On a rewatch you'll notice how *dense* it is, there isn't a single useless scene or filler moment. It's obvious it's based from a novel rather than a game, light novel, or manga.
>> ARTICLE
Gives me chills and makes me have to look over my shoulder at the same time. Bookended by the gorgeous Wareta Ringo, Shinsekai Yori's soundtrack was beautifully chosen for the feel of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
Every time someone mentions Shinsekai Yori, or Wareta Ringo I have to say it.

Freaking Wareta Ringo was so damn good at making me uncomfortable/unsettled at the end of an episode. I dont mean that in a bad way, just that it set really helped sink in that "holy shit wtf just happened".

I guess it might be because of the way the chords cut off so suddenly, it sounds kinda strange and different.
>> ARTICLE
I'm very surprised that no one has mentioned Berserk

[Behelit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEvtnqh5OsE) does a great job at setting the overall dark fantasy atmosphere.

[Forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkYYYew8CUI) greatly embellishes the battles in this anime. It's just epic. Unfortunately it's only in the first four episodes then after that it's only in the previews.

[Guts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWt5WB7wtJ0) is very moody and eerie, perfect for certain parts of the series especially regarding the characters.

[Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCsqGkmVMJw) is another great one.

In regards to presentation the manga is infinitely better when it comes to art, but the anime is second to none when it comes to capturing atmosphere in an anime. The manga is the actual thing but I highly recommend watching the anime (as an add-on) for the atmosphere and soundtrack if nothing else.

Have you watched tsuritama? It has a lot of Irish whistle in its soundtrack, and is also a comfy Sol about someone moving to a new place.

As soon as I read NNB, I immediately heard that flute that's always playing in every episode
>> ARTICLE
NNB has one of those OSTs thats not brought up much, but it fits perfectly in with the quiet, relaxed country atmosphere the anime is all about.

[I Think I Can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4OvA06bVi4)

[Crazy Sunshine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FibzBy7G5Gw)

And a lot more. The soundtrack reflects the general feel and attitude of the show.

Perfect choice. Such an unorthodox soundtrack for an unorthodox show. Gigguk said it well when he said that the show sometimes felt like a perfectly choreographed extended music video

Zankyou no Terror

Sora No Woto's Soundtrack is very fascinating. I especially love [Servante du Feu](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sora+no+woto+servante+du+feu)


If we're talking about entire soundtracks, Madoka Magica's Soundtrack is great at setting up atmospheres.

>> ARTICLE
Even the character themes, a la [Hisoka's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l_x9R6yAxQ), are great at setting the mood.

Although my vote goes to [Legend of the Martial Artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6BV-UdQiG4) as the best BGM track.

The whole Aria OST, done by Choro Club Feat. Senoo.

Mostly acoustic guitars and piano pieces, I think it does a good job melding with the scenes instead of just setting the tone, just complementing the setting instead of making the setting.
>> ARTICLE
I think Attack on Titan's OST does a really good job; not only is it really epic, but it's got a note of desperation to it - with all of the discordant electronic sounds and the chanting - which I think really fits the atmosphere of the show.

[Just listen to this entire scene \(spoilers\)](https://youtu.be/qmNdErA8PMc?t=31)

Disappearance's soundtrack was an absolute masterpiece and by far my favorite score from any anime I've watched.

Hibike! Euphonium didn't have one specific atmosphere the whole way through, but I thought the OST did a perfect job of setting the mood, especially for every vital scene/episode in the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
You got that damn right! I get them shivers and a big giddy grin from listening to the OST from *Hibike!*

It's just fantastic. Tracks 19, 26 and 27 are definitely my favourites! Don't think I can link them, unfortunately.

Angel Beats OST. 

Especially the [OP](https://soundcloud.com/sakurafairy/angel-beats-my-soul-your-beats) and [Ichiban No Takaramono](https://soundcloud.com/angel-beats-osts/ichiban-no-takaramono-yui) (<-- Heads up, 2nd song has Angel Beats spoilers). But, Idk if you wanna be working with sad songs playing...

As I've been progressing through the Monogatari Series over the past couple months, I feel obligated to mention it here. Some specific tracks that were really memorable were [Jinchiku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVztsp1fLo8), [Kaiki's Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY3ufkZPm1s), [Ika, Kaisou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e15VUsxqtbY), and [Mukashigatari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3aSWJq8S6s).

I'm going to go with Akatsuki no Yona/Yona of the Dawn. Ryo Kunihiko really did an amazing job. [I feel like this fits the adventure portion of the show really well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9-SejaR4M8) Meanwhile, he can also capture characters; [I think this fits Jeaha perfectly.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGva5-Cm1w) He also captures emotions so tenderly, as heard [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFPjhukK93I) And on top of that, he can do [epic and powerful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cqRd9yXmuk) fantastically as well. That's not even mentioning the main theme/first [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0KWvg8g4K0) which is fantastic in its own right. 

...I really can't say enough good things about this OST. 
>> ARTICLE
Last Exile, Vision of Escaflowne, Earth Girl Arjuna, Noir, FLCL, Serial Experiments Lain, Kids on the Slope

Has nobody mentioned the OST from Gakkou Gurashi!? It's by far some of the most heartfelt, yet intrinsically eerie soundtrack I've had the pleasure of listening to. This is especially the case with the insert songs. 


>> ARTICLE
Some links? The soundtrack didn't stand out to me, but then I have that problem a lot. The other day, someone linked me an NGNL soundtrack that I have since listened to on loop for hours at a time on 2 occasions.

Tsuneo Imahori's OST for Trigun is a masterpiece! I have a few links for you to check out in soundcloud:

[Trigun: First Donuts](https://soundcloud.com/cloud_23/sets/trigun-ost-the-first-donuts-cd)

[Suna No Hoshi (Sandy Planet)](https://soundcloud.com/tapehappy/the-second-donut-suna-no-hoshi-sandy-planet)

I highly recommend these songs within these playlists: H.T., Scattered Rain, Big Bluff, Knives, Philosophy in a Teacup (My personal fav), Cynical Pink, Nerve Rack.

**Edit:** The song in this video actually starts at 0:22

> Ctrl+F "Ergo Proxy" 0/0

Ok let's change that. You can say what you want about the anime itself but the OST is just SO atmospheric, it fits perfectly. It would even fit in things like metroid prime. Great work of Ike Yoshihiro

Some examples:

[New Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMobOPSmZjc)

[No.724FGARK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_138a0Z33I)

[Domecoming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5b2xAa1VXU)

[Deus ex Machina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wAkVtS1We4)

And these are just examples, the whole soundtrack is wonderful.

/u/pozswirf thanks for making the thread. I'm a huge soundtrack fan for work and for schoolwork. I simply can't perform as well with lyric heavy music as I learned as a college freshman, so I started becoming a soundtrack geek. Totally agree about the ping pong soundtrack, I've listened to it from start to finish god knows how many times as I write essays and such. Hero Appears, Ping Pong Phase, Peco, and Sweet Pain are all in the top two or three dozen most listened to tracks on my ipod.
>> ARTICLE
Came in here specifically to mention Ping Pong, only to find that you've already covered it OP

I guess that just goes to show how excellent Ping Pong's soundtrack is

Hiroyuki Sawano is out of this world good.
The composer for Aldnoah Zero, Attack on Titan, Seraph of the End, Kill la Kill, and many more.

[Kyoukai no Kanata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEyVsqxWSgQ&list=RDY2wCmbFw00o&index=2). This very first song accompanied by Akihito's monologue perfectly establishes a very mysterious, kinda Halloween-esque tone of the show.
>> ARTICLE
My go-to answers for good OSTs are either Madoka or Nagi no Asukara. Since someone's already mentioned Madoka, I recommend Nagi no Asukara. [Mirage of the Sea](https://youtu.be/Mq2O2QK5kn4) is my favorite, but everything else is good too. I've listened to it many times while studying.

My favorite example of this is Casshern Sins.  The plot was nothing too special, but the soundtrack perfectly encapsulated the atmosphere: a dying world with no hope, with survivors holding on and squabbling over dwindling resources for as long as they can before they inevitably rust away.

did a very good job of setting moods, be it relaxing, tense or energetic. 

Personal favorite: [Hyouka OST 43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBSz5Npj4Bs&list=PL03ZsRFzw8T38XHm2NUfBLH9AWuuD6fBJ&index=43) made the hopeless/mysterious atmosphere seems real.

[The first town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CGtGpe2eH4) make me just wanna jump straight into a MMO game and/or rewatch the series. It also represent the anime very well.

[Yuujin A kun wo Watashi no Bansousha ni Ninmei Shimasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtOOk0IKixM) is all the anime in its song.

>> ARTICLE
A lot of the big names have already been mentioned, but I feel like the [Hurricane Suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5Hp42y7gVA) from Naruto Shippuden is worth mentioning. It's very different from a lot of the other music in the Naruto soundtrack, and is also quite long.

But I'm not sure if this does a good job of establishing the atmosphere, because Shippuden wasn't always as dark as this track might suggest
>> ARTICLE
Y'all mofos need to watch Bleach.

Anyway jokes aside, Bleach really does have a superb OP that really sets the atmosphere. Dark and gritty moments? You have the perfect OST for that. Action? For that too. Light hearted? You bet. Espada, what's that, sounds spanish? Here have some latino insipired music. 

After all the anime I've watched, still remains the best OST IMO. It even makes up for the pacing and fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely FLCL. Such a perfect track list for that show.
>> ARTICLE
Wolf children, hands down.

The soundtrack combined with the heartwarming music will leave you in tears. 

The orchestral bit when ame and yuki are running in the snow makes you feel so fuzzy and happy...

If you are interested in the soundtrack, just take 2 hours of your time and watch it. Absolutely amazing.

Lots of good suggestions already, but no-one's mentioned [Noein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au8Jo371oWM), which has some unusual music (besides the OP/ED which are pretty standard). It juxtaposes early western folk cues with literally epic choral and orchestral themes.

The one that comes right to mind would be Code Geass. 

The soundtrack is so damn good, creating this imperial, classic and timeless feeling with the orchestral compositions. The violins, cellos, horns, trumpets, harps, even the lyrical singing. As a music appreciator and student, I just love it all.

[*Ghost Hound*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2596/Shinreigari__Ghost_Hound)! It's a show that seems to prioritise atmosphere ahead of everything else and the soundtrack is the most important part of creating that unsettling vibe. As well as the music it uses lots of sounds like radio interference, electrical feedback, shrine bell chimes. Very much in the same vein as [*Serial Experiments Lain*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain) and [*Boogiepop Phantom*](http://myanimelist.net/anime/369/Boogiepop_wa_Warawanai__Boogiepop_Phantom).

I'm watching this now, I'm on episode 9. Holy shit this soundtrack/effects!

Due to the regions its available in, its likely it will go the same way as Break Blade TV version (no-1 is subbing it, no rip available) and most will be watching the Funimation version anyway.
>> ARTICLE
So this begs the all important question...

Is Break Blade good enough to be worth the trouble of watching it?
>> ARTICLE
> no-1 is subbing it, *no rip available*

CR is doing it in the EU, HS has servers in the EU. Do the math.
>> ARTICLE
It's not subbed by HS yet, do the math.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong hasn't even fucking *aired* yet, why the fuck would you expect it to be subbed already?

edit: Unless you misinterpreted my comment to be about Break Blade, for which my explanation is "I have no care about such show"

edit2: I can get access to Break Blade on CR but only languages Spanish and French, so obviously HS (who rip English) would not do so.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope someone ends up subbing Break Blade :(

If it weren't for the holdback on French subs I'd have gone for it over Funi. Why did they have to sub WEAKSAUCE and Daimidaler (though that one's good) but not pin pon?

Just started Kokoro connect without knowing anything at all about it (besides that masturbation gif that gets posted everywhere). Only seen the first episode so far, but it seems interesting. I hope it does it's supernatural theme better than Henneko.
>> ARTICLE
Like others have said, I thought the show had some good ideas, but it was just good, nothing special. I just thought the anime didn't really hold its own and became a bit to focused on the romance side of things, but it seems that for whatever reason people are jumping on this show. At leas the show was good enough to persuade me to read the lite novels, which are actually really good. 
>> ARTICLE
It really steps up from it's first episode. Character development was done right in this anime which is what I cannot say about some others.

However, I have not been able to watch the Final Four episodes. The legal trouble or whatever Kokoro Connect got into made it impossible to view it. I have no idea how to see it for myself. I went to Youtube and see a clip that made me realize that the anime had a wonderful ending.

Recommended, keep on viewing, like the rest of us on team masturbation.
>> ARTICLE
I've just looked up that masturbation gif, and I'm now very eager that to watch that show....this would be strange out of context wouldn't it.
>> ARTICLE
I just watched that recently, I seriously don't understand Inaba's popularity, nothing about her really stands out to me.
>> ARTICLE
how far in did you get?
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first season, gonna get around to watching the other episodes soon.
>> ARTICLE
When that show was airing it felt like a rather sizable percentage of people (myself included) were seriously disappointed and unhappy with that show, but it seems lately that show has gotten terrifically popular for some reason. Was there some kind of blogger or something gushing over it?
>> ARTICLE
I watched it for the first time a few days ago and I definitely agree. The character development was really whack and the romance was lame. Too many people deciding they love one another out of nowhere. Also, [spoilers](/s "seriously the worst character conflict that comes up *more than once* is Iori acting like a different person than what she feels she really is?? It felt so over dramatized and the entire time I was watching it I couldn't help but think, 'That's your problem... really... that's it?'")
>> ARTICLE
I watched it after seeing a few of the gifs.

I went in not expecting anything good, but was blown away; the character development was better than anything I had seen before.

What was disappointing, can I ask?
>> ARTICLE
I picked it up when [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/21stwc/im_rewatching_kokoro_connect_and_this_scene/) thread popped up. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched it recently and really enjoyed it. Especially after the last 4 special episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I think the "Michi Random" arc was the weakest part of the story.  It had the least interesting "phenomenon," and it made Iori the focus, for the third time - completely undermining her character in the process.  I would've been happier with the show if those episodes never existed.
>> ARTICLE
I am still in two minds about the whole Michi thing, as I was also completely shocked how the writers messed with her character, it was really melodramatic and completely pointless. The "phenomenon" was only ever good due to the scenes with Inaba IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
On the other hand.

[Kokoro Connect Michi Random spoilers](/s "It features Inaba winning at the end which is such a better ending.")
>> ARTICLE
I wanted Iori to win ):

Meh.  I still maintain that Yui was the "best girl" in the series, despite her clear B-team pairing.

I started and completed **[One Outs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5040/One_Outs)** this week. It was a brilliant series. **8/10** I highly recommend it.

I as welll started **[Texhnolyze](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26/Texhnolyze)** and **[Slam Dunk](http://myanimelist.net/anime/170/Slam_Dunk)** today. I hope great things from these.

**Edit:**

I forgot about **[Uchouten Kazoku](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=17909)**. I finished it as well this week.

It was something rather unique and was written by the [same guy](http://myanimelist.net/people/13775/Morimi_Tomihiko) who made [The Tatami Galaxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei). I recommend it as well.

I have started technolyze like 15 times, but never finish the first episode. There is no good reason for it, i should really get off my ass and finish it.

I'm watching The Eccentric Family and it is breathtakingly beautiful. I love animes that have the same feeling and Tomihiko Morimi is one of my favorite writers. I would love him even better once my Japanese reading gets better.

His two stories that have been anime adapted are in my top 5 animes of all time.

I liked Slam Dunk. But I probably have nostalgia goggles on because I used to watch it with my dad when I was still in primary school.

**Neon Genesis Evangelion (11/26)**  
Pretty surprised that I like it. I'm not a fan of mecha or "old" shows, but still, I'm not bored at all watching this.  
So far, it's kinda "angel of the week" episodes, but there's some hints that something bigger is gonna happen.  
For all the complaints I heard about Shinji, I find him okay as a character, not as whiny as people make him to be. (Maybe it's because I've seen Accel world..)  

**Sakasama no Patema (1/1)**  
I loved it. It's just .. beautiful. 
The story kept surprising me. And while I was slightly confused at the end, I managed, thanks to this subreddit/MAL forums, to understand everything.  
The only big flaw is the characters, mostly the bad guy, who is just.. bad. But that's understandable since the movie isn't that long.  
**9/10**
>> ARTICLE
I think one of the main reason Eva holds up so well is it had pretty amazing animation quality for it's time. It definitely looks amazing compared to most shows of the same era.
>> ARTICLE
While watching the series, I didn't find Shinji to be very whiny (or at least not too much. There were some parts where he expresses how much he dislikes piloting an Eva, but overall he wasn't too bad). But in the movie (End of Evangelion), I hated him so much. If I were a character in that movie, I would have slapped him in the face so hard.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like out of context, yes. But after the last episodes of NGE, he couldn't really be expected to do much.
>> ARTICLE
Shinji is by no means a *bad* character. He is a very well written one, but that doesn't count for people saying they don't like him. That's only based on his appearance. 

In terms of *real* character, Shinji is by far one of the strongest (best written etc.).
>> ARTICLE
I think he is a really well written character I still do not like him, (because of his actions later on in the series and in 3.33) 
>> ARTICLE
I binge-watched both *Psycho-Pass* and *Fate/Zero.*I was (pleasantly) surprised that *Psycho-Pass* lived up to the hype.  Being honest, when a series is much-ballyhooed, I usually watch it with undue criticism.  Yet, with *Psycho-Pass,* my only annoyance was the sound effect used when what appear to be spent shotgun shells are cast onto a hard surface - it sounded like brass casings.  That's it.*Fate/Zero* was a bit more within my preferred genres.  I realize it's a prequel, and it *has* to end in such a way that ties it to the existing material, but I felt the second season failed to deliver on the promise of the first in terms of storytelling.  It's still good, but I think it's weaker.
>> ARTICLE
Oui, the second season of Fate/Zero was unfortunately bridled to the beginning of Fate/Stay Night. The story had to pave it's way to set up the beginning of FSN and as a result, it suffered. 

Admittedly, I read the FSN visual novel post F/Z and watched the anime because I was hoping for F/Z levels of brilliance. 
>> ARTICLE
**Log Horizon S1 (completed)**

I started watching this after seeing one too many Akatsuki gifs and deciding that I needed to see her in action. My full writeup on this show ended up being over 1500 words long, so I'll just sum it up more briefly here.

Log Horizon was a pretty great story, and it really nails quite a few things that allow it to do its job. For one, its execution-of-concept is *spot* on. It aims to be a story taking place in a vast MMORPG world, and it never lets the viewer forget that. The world has politics, it has NPCs and inhabitents, it has problems and crime, it has class issues, culture, and cultural differences, it has social dynamics, it has an economy, and more. Although not all of this is explored in any depth, it's all *there*, and the viewer sees it and knows something about it.

On top of this, names of very distant, unvisited cities, of powerful guilds in other lands to the west and north, and rumors about what's going on in these places come up every few episodes. You're always aware of just how much there is in this world beyond what you see and know, making the world feel vast and unknown.

The character work was, in my opinion, appropriate for the show, but I can see some viewers not liking how it was done. To go along with the huge world they created, they gave us an equally huge cast. This naturally means that most characters aren't particularly deep or developed as individuals, but Log Horizon makes sure they're strong as a unit. The show uses this well by dividing up its cast into parties (sound familiar, MMO players?) and telling big, multi-faceted story arcs with lots of parallel events going on in different places, all working toward a goal. They also managed inter-personal sub-plots all over the place on top of this, including up to four distinct romantic subarcs, mentor/student relationships, developing friendships and bonds of trust, and more. Some of it was really touching and realistic, too.

The show's weaknesses mainly come down to one thing: Cliches. Log Horizon is full of them. Bad guys look ugly and evil and are bad because they're bad, the show severely overuses recurring gags in its first third or so (but does tone this down appropriately later), and while its world-building is great, its method of exposition was ham-handed. The whole "monologue to the viewer through your thoughts" thing was used constantly. Log Horizon should take a lesson or two from Hitsugi no Chaika, a show that knows how to do exposition if nothing else.

Animation, artwork, and soundtrack are not stand-out, but of high quality throughout and definitely do their jobs, the OP is as ridiculously infectious as the fanbase would have you think, and the glasses sheen is real.

If you're okay with a load of cliches and occasionally repetitive, predictable humor in exchange for one of the most vibrant worlds you'll find and a sense of wonder and adventure with a great group of people, give the database a shot.

**Humanity Has Declined (5/12)**

I don't have much to say about this show just yet, mainly because it does absolutely no explicit exposition. It really just dumps you in this world as seen through the eyes of our cynical, sarcastic nameless protagonist and has her solving interesting but bizarre problems. The world's state is very, very slowly coming into focus as bits and pieces of information are given to the viewer as time passes.

The artwork is extremely distinct and the color palette is vibrant and gorgeous, it has my [favorite ED in recent memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13w2SGFz0c), and the protagonist is just a fantastic, quick-witted character who reminds me a lot of Kyon from Haruhi Suzumiya or Araragi from Monogatari. I've heard that the show contains a lot of social commentary, but unfortunately I'm horrifically uncultured in general, so this is not something I'm noticing.

Jintai is great to pick up alongside other series because it so far has a very even, purposeful pace. It's told in 2-episode arcs that are pretty disjoint from each other, so you can easily squeeze in an arc when you have 40 minutes to spare and come back later.

I actually do recommend this series to anyone reading for much the same reason I'd recommend Monogatari to anyone: I've never seen anything else like it, and if it's your kind of thing, it's a real treat.

**Sankarea - 8/10:** Finished this one after starting it last week and all the time I had this one spoiler (Which I'm not even sure is true) in my mind. I found it overall pretty good and really liked Rea although her father was really creepy. I've added the Manga to my PTR list and I hope I'll get to it before forgetting the series.

**Yosuga no Sora:** Next on my list was this show which picked my interest after I saw it under the "Heavy incest" category on the recommendation wiki. I've barely finished the 5th episode and I think it's decent so far.

I definitely recommend reading through the manga for Sankarea. Just about everything picks up and the English translation only has something like six chapters left.

**White Album 2** (1-6/12)
I'm liking the romantic tension in this show. After watching a good number of drama romance animes, this is the first one where I feel the characters are being the most realistic with their emotions. It is honestly turning into my favorite romance anime. 

**Casshern Sins** (9-11/24)
I started watching this a while ago because I really like the setting the show takes place in, but the pacing of the story was really slow so I put it on hold. Picked it back up and it's still really hard for me to keep up with it. On the other hand, the action is great, and Cassherns relationships with other characters also feel very real.

**Angel Beats!** (1-5/13) - Started this show on recommendation from friends and colleagues on the internet, enjoying it quite a lot. The ending to the Iwasawa episode made me sad.

**Spice and Wolf II** (Complete) - Wow. Just. Wow. I loved the second season of S&W so much. I had watched the first season the week before and marathoned Season 2 while a friend was away. Now, left to appreciate what I've watched and wallow in the sadness of no Season 3.

> Now, left to appreciate what I've watched and wallow in the sadness of no Season 3.

I'll offer the same advice given to me: go read the light novels! They're quite good as well. I'm just now on the final one and it's been a great ride even after finishing the anime months ago.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching Oregairu (8/13) and I'm surprised, why this show is so hyped around here. I consider the writing and the characters sub-par and the author doesn't hide the fact very well, that this is actually a RomCom, even with some people here telling me that there's no RomCom. 
>> ARTICLE
It's probably because Hachiman and Yukino their interactions alone made me really like the series. It has a decent social commentary but I find Haciman to be a good MC, he isn't afraid to speak his mind nor is  he is afraid to share his views on the society(as twisted they may be). How much you enjoy a Romance is really how much you like the characters, Hachiman is a really likable MC so I can see the hype centered around it. He also gives some pretty decent monologues, although truth to be told there hasn't been much romance. Guess we have to wait for S2. 
>> ARTICLE
I definitely agree with you on that one. A lot of people here act like it's a super sophisticated social commentary, but it's not too much more than a romantic comedy with harem and satire elements. While it's not bad by any means, it shouldn't really stand out, especially as far as characters go.

**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha (13/13)**

**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's (13/13)**

**Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS(4/26)**

I like the series so far, but I'm a sucker for Magitek and lasers. I haven't seen much magical girl anime, so I can't really compare this to the genre as a whole, but it is certainly different than what I've seen so far. Also, Fate is absolutely adorable.

**Cardcaptor Sakura (70/70)**

Madoka Magica aside, my only other foray into the magical girl genre ended in a strange way. The plot resolved nicely, and it was nice seeing Sakura grow a little more confident in her abilities. I was not happy that they ended Sakura's romantic subplot without any actual resolution, though. Hopefully the second movie will give me the ending I was hoping for.

**Gungrave (1/26)**

That is a terrible dub.

**Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (26/26)**

That was everything I never knew I wanted. Lots of extremely muscular men named after classic rock bands killing vampires with weaponized sunlight.

The story telling is very engrossing, the characters and their VA's have huge chemistry and the pacing is fucking fantastic.

**Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann** (27/27)


I just want to start of by saying I've always said Cowboy Bebop was the best anime ever and considered it my favorite of all time. Gurren Lagann beat it by a longshot.


I've never seen such an epic, uplifting, entertaining, and amazing thing in my whole life. You don't just watch Gurren Lagann: you experience it. Not only did I enjoy it immensely, I also feel extremely inspired to strive to be a more confident person. It just does that to you.


All of the characters were memorable, and the protagonists were super likeable. I loved watching the Team Dai-Gurren operate, and I loved watching them win battles. 


Not only that, but for the first time in my life, a work of fiction made me cry. Episode 26, when [spoiler](/s "Kamina reappears. His death hit me surprisingly hard. I saw Episode 8 at night, and I spent the entire day after feeling really bummed out because of it. No character death has affected me like that before.")


And that final battle? That had to be hands down the most epic thing I've ever witnessed. Seriously, it blew my mind.


The show's funny, epic, ridiculous, inspiring, stylish, emotional, manly, entertaining, and about a billion other positive adjectives. It is, without a doubt, my favorite anime of all time. It just upsets me because I'm not aware of anything that can come close to topping it. It's been several days since I finished it, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It's that good. Ten outta ten.


(Oh, and I had a hard time taking Lordgenome seriously. He was a badass, but... he had the same voice as Jelly Jiggler from Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo. I grew up with that show, so I couldn't unhear that goofball Jelly Jiggler's voice.)


**Baccano!** (2/16)


I honestly knew next to nothing about Baccano! going into it, other than it's supposed to be good.


So far, I'm really liking it. Two episodes isn't really enough to form a solid opinion on it yet, but it's very enjoyable nonetheless. I like the characters a lot, especially Isaac and Miria. I'm not totally sure what's happening, but I'm guessing it solidifies a little later. 


And I need to make a mental note on downloading the theme song, cause that's a damn good tune. 

>> ARTICLE
Have you seen the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann movies yet? The second one really makes the final battle from the series pale in comparison. 
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind with Baccano that even though it jumps between timelines, *each timeline is presented in chronological order*.  You'll never be fed a scene about the Flying Pussyfoot that happens chronologically earlier than another Flying Pussyfoot scene.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann is the most energetic and heroic work I have seen so far. And I share the same feeling with you about episode 26 (I think I had tears of epicness in my eyes for the last third of the series especially [](/s "when Kittan made his final King Kittan Giga Drill Break")).
>> ARTICLE
Baccano can indeed be pretty confusing. Try to keep track of the dates so you know what happened before what, but after it goes on a bit it gets easier as you start to get to know the characters better. Still, it is very much worth the watch.

From my comment in the /r/trueanime thread:

Got off my ass and started watching episodic stuff that I've had on hold for the past 4-5 years. I'm terrible at watching episodic shows so I figured why not watch them the way they were intended to be watched: episodically?

**Mushishi** (5-10)

I definitely appreciate Mushishi more now than when I watched it before. It's stunning how the show develops and makes you care about a character that is only there for one episode. 

The animation and music are extremely deliberate and calming, meshing well with the whole "go with the flow" vibe. 

The voice acting also stood out to me, since it was much more subdued compared to most commercial anime, and it worked to the show's benefit. It just goes to show that you don't need to be yelling, screaming, or crying to show deep emotions of sorrow or anger. 

I like the whole theme of self-acceptance and self-actualization, but I'm not sure if I agree with some of the outcomes in the show (episode six), some of which too easily accept their respective fates.

I'm enjoying this one the most so far, it's very contemplative, reflective, and introspective. Doesn't hurt that the mushi themselves have interesting concepts. 

**Cowboy Bebop** (1-5)

Watched the first two eps however many years ago and put it on hold because of its episodic nature. Looks like I dropped it just before things start picking up more. Episode 3 was solid. Then episode 5 had a huge tonal shift from the previous ones. I'm guessing I'll be fed bits and pieces of the main casts' pasts and they'll all be similar to episode 5 in some ways. 

Animation: great fight choreography from Bones. The OST stands out too, contributing to the whole space western theme. 

I've got really nothing bad to say about it so far. Looking forward to see the characters develop more. 

**Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex** (1-2)

I actually watched the first two episodes before but forgot most of it. I enjoy scifi for its examination of the human condition and the questions it posits about what it means to be human. GitS:SAC certainly delivers on both counts so far. I like how the worldbuilding is presented. Instead of shoving expositional narration/dialogue in your face, it simply shows that some of the stuff just *is* in this universe, like cyberized brains, cyborgs, etc. Very efficient and concise storytelling. Looking forward to the thematic ideas here. 

The Major's outfit is ridiculous though. 

I've also been watching Chu2Ren for the weekly "anime" anime dose. Nothing much to say about that one. 

Still rewatching **Fate/zero** with /r/anime. I forgot how much I liked the Lancer episode with Kiritsugu's speech. Also the flashback episodes were great again.
>> ARTICLE
SAC picks up as the series gets rolling, and is probably my all-time favourite. Though personally I feel the second season was the stronger of the two, the continuing story in the first season is really good.

Also, hang in there, because the Major isn't going to put on some damn pants until 2nd gig.

Good to know. I stopped watching the first time I tried because it was a bit slow.

*Recommended by: roommate*

> If you could give form to happiness, what would it be like?

Started off in a weird place, but soon kicked back into that signature overdrive of pacing after some callbacks and parallels to the first season. There are a lot of dealings with international relations and politics which lead to some grandiose battle sequences. A lot of double-crosses and challenges to motivations. If I had to complain Id say that the presence of the subtext in the dialog isnt as strong as before and the focus is much more drawn to the drama in the plot developments, some of which had me giggling more than anything else. But there is a sense that something very large is culminating and god damn I cant wait to see it. C.C. best pizza girl. Flow best openings. Chinese Eunuchs worst voicing.

[Episode 5](/s "A seasons worth of fanservice with some extreme camera positioning.")

**[Bakuman.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7674/Bakuman.) (1-13/25)**

*Recommended by: relative*

*Theme: scout out a show that the other has not seen but is interested in*

> The future will be nothing more than an extension of the present

Infectious. Right from the start the show exudes this pure, unfiltered excitement from its main duo  and later from the secondary cast  that really ropes you in and leaves you wanting to return. The scenes in the studio are a stand out as we bear witness to the process of creation and the formation of an artistic identity. We also get some understated insight into and commentary of the manga and anime industries through Mashiros uncle and Hattori as a member of the editorial staff. The humor is light but effective and serves the tone of the show. The more drama-intensive segments range from silly to engaging. The romantic aspect is actively frustrating though charming in its own right. Ive also heard enough Ganbatte!s to last me a lifetime. Excited to see where this goes.

[Episode 4](/s "God dammit Mashiro you faked me out twice on that hill I have no sympathy for you anymore.")

[I could listen to Lawrence & Holo banter all day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wINa_YZj-kg). So the visuals look a little more pristine on the production side of things. Structurally we get two main arcs where the main merchant duo arrive in a new town, meet a new contact, and get involved in a dealing that introduces some risk not only financially but also to the stability of Holo and Lawrence as partners. There is a little more depth thematically and within the actual transactions themselves which was a welcomed change. As always, top-notch romance. Probably picking up the light novels in the future.

Great comedy, with a pretty good sibling reconciliation relationship thing. Some hints of romance, and it's about a 7-8/10    
**Puella Magi Madoka Magica Rebellion 3**    
As per usual, the artstyle brilliantly conveys a feeling of general creepiness and unease. I didn't enjoy it as much as the anime series, but the story was still good, and the open ending wasn't done in too much an unsatisfactory way. 8.5/10
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Spice and Wolf, both seasons. I would recommend it. The second season ending was not what I had expected but it really did fit the show. I watched the dub for the first season. I tried watching the sub for the second, but I really didn't like Lawrence's voice although I liked both Holo's. 

In the English they both sound a lot older which makes sense since they are both pretty old compared to most anime, while in the sub they sound a lot younger especially Holo. 

Would recommend 9/10

**[Kyoukai no Kanata](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18153/Kyoukai_no_Kanata) (1-10/12)**

I liked it early on but things started getting weird towards the end. Honestly there's not much to say, it's enjoyable but doesn't really stands out in any way. I'll probably try to watch the last 2 episodes soon and just get over it. 

Score: **7/10**

**[Nagi no Asukara](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16067/Nagi_no_Asukara) (1-11/26)**

I expected nothing from it because the cover on MAL is pretty generic, but I'm really enjoying it. The visuals on this anime are just amazing, and I'm really enjoying the story and characters. I'm really looking forward to marathoning the last 15 episodes.

Score: **9/10** - Has the potential for 10/10.

**[Prince of Tennis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22/Prince_of_Tennis) (1-5/178)**

This is my new "filler" anime, something that I watch just to kill some time. There's not much to say about it, I expected a normal shounen-sport anime and that's what I got, and that's fine.

Score: **7/10**

**[Hitsugi no Chaika](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20853/Hitsugi_no_Chaika) (12/12)**

I really liked this one, but definitely needs a season 2 to close the story out. The show has potential and I like most of the characters.

Score: **7/10** - Probably a 8/10 if the second season closes the story out. Also pls more Red Chaika.

Nagi no Asukara is kind of an oddball, I loved it but by the end it wasn't what I believed it would be, whatever is the reason you are liking it so far I suggest keeping your expectations in check.

**Yuru Yuri** (Complete): All in all, a pretty nice season. Decently amusing, and some pretty nice character chemistry. Episodes 10 and 11 were pretty nice, but the attempted drama in the second half of Episode 11 didn't really work for me.  
And then there's **Episode 12**. I already had some idea of what to expect (the [tomato](http://i4.minus.com/ibpPJtvRn4P5cL.png) and the [murder scene](http://i1.minus.com/ibdPFfbJtnZFQO.png)), but never expected it to be this insane. It's like they saved all the craziness for this single last episode. Well, not complaining, this episode singlehandedly bumped the show to 8/10 for me.

Also, not many shows can go out with a literal bang.
>> ARTICLE
I finished Non Non Biyori just yesterday and wow, I enjoyed it. I'm not too much a fan of slice of life shows like this, but I feel like I enjoyed it because of the setting, and the difference in age between all the characters made it feel refreshing. Needless to say, I can't wait for season 2.
>> ARTICLE
**The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.** I just finished the Endless Eight arc. It wasn't as bad as I anticipated given people's complaints about it. I got a little tired of the dialogue after a while but I enjoyed picking out the differences in each episode and trying to figure out how it all was going to wrap up.

Also **White Album 2.** It's my first real drama/romance anime, and the tension is real. I'm not looking forward to how it ends because I know I'm going to end up sad for somebody.
>> ARTICLE
My biggest problem with Endless Eight is that they spent 8 episodes out of a 14 episode season repeating the same thing.  If it was a 26 episode season, that'd be different, but they spent literally over half the season repeating the same events over and over.  That was unforgivable, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It was definitely a huge risk on the creator's part to invest over half the season on the same set of events. But I look at it as the creator trying to make us empathize with the character of Nagato. She remembered and lived through every repeat, but couldn't do anything to stop it; she merely had to observe the events. Just like us. All we could do was watch and see what happens. The show hints that Nagato was starting to become emotionally compromised from the ordeal, and I think they wanted us to feel those same emotions. I don't know how they decided that eight episodes was the right number but whatever. 

The thing that bothered me the most, is the events that took place are never mentioned again. It's as if repeating the same two-week cycle over 15000 times had absolutely no effect on the characters afterwards. 
>> ARTICLE
**Haibane Renmei (13/13)**

This was a nice, poignant, slow-paced show. I enjoyed it, but I couldn't help feeling like it missed quite a few opportunities to develop itself further. 

Don't get me wrong; there's nothing wrong with leaving things unexplained in order to preserve a sense of mystery. But for instance, I thought one of the most thematically interesting sections was [spoiler](/s "early on, when we see Rakka trying to stay strong and deal with her emotions after Kuu's departure, and all of the 'normal' townsfolk just see her as a 'lucky' Haibane who ought to be bright and cheerful all the time. That was a really clever parallel to the way you often hear people with depression describe being treated, and I was hoping the show would explore it further, but it just sort of got dropped.")

**Hunter x Hunter (23/148)**

I've been putting this one off for months, just due to the sheer intimidating number of episodes. But now that the finale's aired, I'm diving in and giving it a shot.

So far I'm not blown away or anything, but it's pretty enjoyable. It feels like the show *ought* to feel very formulaic, but the details and plot twists continue to surprise and entertain me. As it is, I'd probably rate it at least a 7/10; but from what I keep hearing, it gets even better around the Chimera Ant arc, so I'll definitely keep watching to see how that plays out.

Also, [spoiler](/s "I know Killua comes from a family of assassins and all, but *holy shit* I did not expect there to be this much straight-up murder.")

About your spoiler x spoiler: lol.

Good luck with the rest of the series if you're surprised about that.

**Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun**: One of the funniest shows I've ever watched. As everyone's already said, this show really is a deconstruction of a romance show, but in a humorous way. The characters, gags, art style, voice acting, and music (OP and ED) were all fucking awesome; there aren't a lot of things to hate about it really (in fact, I hated nothing about it at all), unless you're going to be extremely critical, which I wouldn't bother. I nominate Mikorin as BEST GIRL of this show. Hoping for a second season. 10/10

**Rail Wars**: Well, well, well. This show got a lot of shit because of the forced Ecchi. But honestly, it wasn't a bad show. Sure, I can critique it for being bad as an Action show (or a show about trains, in general), but once I've figured out that this show was obviously meant to be a Ecchi/Harem with women mysteriously falling in love for the wimpy MC, I just stopped caring and enjoyed it for what it was. **TL;DR Failure as an Action. Succeeds at being a Harem/Ecchi. An OK show in general.** 7/10

**Hyouka**: I liked it a lot. This show is like a SoL version of Detective Conan (being a lot tamer in both setting and cases they're involved). We have a 8man-esque protagonist, except a lot less cynical. All the other characters are likeable and are interesting in some way. I like how one of the mysteries they solved isn't a completely happy resolution, and I think it helps Houtaro realize of what he's actually capable of. Also, that OVA (Ep 11.5) was really good. I mean, it wasn't anything special compared to the rest of the episodes, but I love how they handled the fanservice. It was tastefully done in a way that it doesn't violate the characters. Good stuff, KyoAni. Last episode wasn't much of an ending, but it'll do. [ ](/s "God damn it, Houtaro you should've just succumbed to a rose-colored life with Chitanda.")  9.5/10

**Rokujouma no Shinryakusha?! (ep 10-12)**: I was very pleased with how they handled the harem. [Potential Spoiler](/s "Every girl was happy in the end and everyone's happy just by living alongside Koutarou.") Speaking of Koutarou, he was a very competent harem MC. Probably one of the best I've seen. I heard that this season was only a Prologue to the real plot, so I'm hoping that people would support this show so we can have Season 2. I want more Yurika in my life (seriously, she's always saving their asses but never rewarded. I want to give her a huge hug.) Also, I haven't read the LNs yet, this is just a speculation, but I'm pretty sure [ ](/s "both Koutarou and Sakuraba, being the Knight and Princess, are immortal beings who can travel through time and dimensions. I bet the guy which every girl in the harem seem to look up to is and was actually Koutarou.") All in all, an enjoyable anime as long as you don't expect too much out of it. 8/10

Edit: I forgot to mention that even though most of the VA cast for Rokujyouma were first-timers, they were all really good, especially Sanae's and Yurika's. I just hope none of them somehow fall into H-titles like most beginners do.

I watched the first OVA Episode for Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito. I'm glad I kept it tucked away for a Saturday night watch, it was surprisingly good. 

I liked how it wasn't as Shonen-y as Code Geass and I liked how it fit inside the timeline nicely. Aside from that, I like the fair portrayal (as of now) of each side of the conflict. Plus, the CG was Arpeggio of Blue Steel levels of tolerable and it was woven in pretty well.   
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I quite enjoy the way the OVA presents something that is recognisably in the same extravagant world but has a colder, chillier mood. IIRC the outfit that does the 3DCG work for it is Orange, who did a decent job on Majestic Prince, too. The second episode has some of the finest 3DCG mecha action I've seen in anime, though I'm not quite convinced that they get the cloaks to work.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched the second one. I'm planning to keep it on hold until 2015...the one year gaps between each 40 minute episode is almost unbearable.

Quality over quantity I guess. It's like waiting for a new Berserk chapter! 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes. Gundam Unicorn was a similar experience. But spare a thought for people who watched Giant Robo as it was [coming out](http://puu.sh/bRJGN/870f8bf0e0.png) that gap before the last episode is fearsome.

Haha that 3 year wait was like me waiting for the 3rd Evangelion rebuild movie. 

And as a Berserk fan, there was a period of time where we only got a chapter a year.....

Not a whole lot, thanks to grad school starting up this week. 

[**White Album 2**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2) **8/13**

Really enjoying this so far! I decided I'd stop because I was afraid it was going to start getting sad, based on everything I've heard about it. I'm probably going to end up finishing it later tonight though... I didn't actually think I was going to enjoy this as much as I am, because I never thought I'd like something that was focused around music. 

**EDIT**

Finished it. Fuck that. I didn't cry at all, I just rolled my eyes and got really angry [because](/s "Haruki is a fucking asshole. You don't just cheat on someone because you've 'loved someone else for longer!!!' like whatever, yeah you slept with another girl and then went with your current girlfriend to say goodbye to the other girl and kissed her and yeah fuck that. And Setsuna is blaming herself and trying to tell Haruki it's okay, when it's just clearly not."). Liked the first 3/4 of the show, but fuck that ending, man. Brought what would have been a really high score for me down to a 6. Would be even lower, but the first 9 or so episodes were amazing.

I finished **Initial D** through the fourth stage as it's being taken off Netflix as of October 1st. I also finished **Eden of the East: King of Eden**, **Dance in the Vampire Bund**, and **Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne** for the same reason.

I've started **The Rose of Versailles**, **Macross**, **Psycho-Pass**, and **Bakemonogatari** because of /r/watchinganime.

I really like *Initial D*, but I don't think binge watching is the best format for it. *King of Eden* wasn't as good as the series and I wasn't thrilled with the ending of *Dance in the Vampire Bund*. I have mixed feelings on *Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne*. I think there's some good things in there, but they kind of get lost amongst the sex and gore.

So far, I'm not a fan of *Rose of Versailles* as I don't like most of the characters other than the lead. *Macross* is as fun as I remembered it, while I haven't really got interested in *Psycho-Pass* yet. As for *Bakemonogatari*, I'm not a fan of Hitagi.

I remember putting Baccano! on hold because of all of the airing shows.  Now that I finished all of them, I decided to watch some Baccano!

I'm now 13/16.  This is because there are 3 specials and I look forward to the last 3 over the next few days.

Overall, it was such a great ride on the Pussyfoot.  [Spoilers](/s "There was like 7 opposing forces at once on that train, holy shit and was it god damn entertaining.  If I can remember there were: black suit guys, white suit guys, news paper people, rail tracer, Jakuzi's gang, Isaac and Miria, Immortal kid.")

The amount of gore, blood and swearing as well as a great English dub just couldn't make me any happier for this show.

All characters are best.  If I could choose my favorite, it's got to be the pair of Isaac and Miria.  I can always be happy whenever their presence is around on screen or off screen.
>> ARTICLE
I think Baccano had one of the best English dubs I've ever heard, but I can't get over how amazing Isaac and Miria are in Japanese.  It's a shame their classic intro dialogue wasn't really translatable.

"Nee, Aizakku~"

"Nandai, Miria?"
>> ARTICLE
Do you recommend watching Baccano in Japanese?  I'm real curious on what you're talking about in terms of their intro dialogue for Issac and Miria.

I believe Baccano was like the only English dubs I've watched all the way through besides Clannad, Angel Beats!, Kanon and Air.  The only other good English dubs I hear is this one, Welcome to the NHK and Cowboy Bebop, that's about it. :/

X-post from TrueAnime:

**Cardcaptor Sakura (complete)**

---

I can't remember the last time I watched this many episodes of a single franchise. It was fun, but honestly kind of exhausting. Even emotionally draining. It's sad to see some of these character go after spending so much time with them, but at the same time I'm kinda glad it's over with. It was interesting to get back to the "heart" of the modern Magical Girl genre, as CCS is often seen as one of the cornerstones of the genre. And you can definitely see a lot of the now ubiquitous tropes at work. Though in a surprise twist, I actually thought Kero was one of the most compelling characters in the story, a feat I wouldn't see repeated until Madoka. On the other hand, the monster-of-week format certainly felt less refined than what I'm used to in this genre. How many cards show up at Sakura's school, honestly? Not a single one decides to fuck around at the high school? It's awfully considerate for so many of them to cause mischief in places that Sakura has easy access to. I would have liked more break-in style and problem-solving. I'm also used to the episodic conflicts being more reflective of the victims or the protagonists. In CCS many of the cards felt like they just showed up because the plot demanded it. Episodes like the Silent or Dash episodes felt much more effective to me. I have to confess that after a while, I just threw on the terrible Animax dub and let the episodes play in the background. Not that they weren't enjoyable, but it was alarmingly easy to predict which episodes were going to be substantive enough to warrant full attention. 

One of the other things I liked  about CCS was definitely its design aesthetic. From Tomoyo's many outfits to the individual Clow creatures. Everything felt distinct and fresh, drawing ideas from tons of different sources(Chinese and western mysticism particularly), but also felt believably grounded in a singular vision. From the adorably feral Dash(which I can't help but feel looks like early concept art for Espeon) to the feminine beauty of cards like Mirror or Song, and everything in-between. The character designs were equally distinctive and recognizable even after costume changes, which is sometimes hard to pull off in animation. 

I've already talked a fair bit about the characters, and I think they got a pretty satisfactory amount of development. This was a long show, and it definitely used that to flesh out most of the cast into believable people. Most of the the cast. Some late-arrivals and a few supporting characters didn't really evolve beyond their single-note personalities. Meiling in particular was "girl who likes Xiaolang a whole lot" right down to her final big character moment. The final villain also felt bafflingly inconsistent in terms of personality. Swinging from masterful troll to wise mentor sometimes in the span of a single episode. Nakuru felt more consistent and vibrant in her(his? Its?) interactions with Toya, and I think that's a bit of a problem for a show's big baddie to have. Overall though, definitely likable and well-realized characters for children's show with such a large ensemble cast.

I gotta say though, my biggest problem with the show was the romantic subplots. Most of them felt incredibly forced, and directionless. It felt like most of them just existed for the sake of the big reveal in the Act Two finale, and they didn't know where to go with any of them for the last arc. The romance I felt most invested in was Toya's romantic subplot with the Mirror card, and that doesn't seem like a good place for a story's romance elements to be in! Sakura and Xiaolang's relationship was too clunky and jokey for me to really buy into their feelings for the final episode. Really good, close friends? Definitely. Romantic partners? I wasn't feeling it. Tomoyo's largely unspoken love for Sakura felt far more natural by the end of the series. I didn't mind the conclusion, but it definitely lacked the impact that the show intended. 

Anyways, it was quite an enjoyable stroll through Magical Girl history. Certainly more so than SM:Crystal has been. CCS has an essence of unrefined beauty to it. A landmark series that paved the way for dozens of successors, and ironically can't quite to live up to its own legacy. But there is still plenty of good, even great, things at work in this show! And it's a testament to those things that CCS continues to stay relevant after so many years. 8/10.

**Petite Princess Yucie (12/26)**

---

Continuing my adventures into old anime for little girls, Petite Princess Yucie is an odd little show. Ostensibly an adaptation of the Princess Maker RPG, this honest-to-goodness shoujo anime comes to us from good old Gainax. And I mean literally the good, old-Gainax. This show's staff list is kind of mind-boggling. It's directed by now ex-Gainax alumni and Trigger co-founder Masahiko Ohtsuka. Yeah, really. It's also scripted by Steins;Gate writer Jukki Hanada. And those aren't even the most surprising names attached to this show. Credited under "Supervising Director" is none other than Mr. Mindfuck himself, Hideaki fucking Anno. [I shit you not.](http://i.imgur.com/gp7tMDS.png) That's right, The creator of NGE plays what I assume is equivalent to a Producer position on a cutesy-poo fantasy Magical Girl show. I don't even. 

But sure, names aren't everything. What is this show about, exactly? Well, it's the story of the naive, child-like Yucie who lives with her adoptive father Gunbard and her steward Cube in their quaint little home in the forest. Yucie is stubborn and quick-tempered, but she's a happy child with an overly doting father. And one slight problem. She's not actually a child at all. For some mysterious reason, 17-year-old Yucie has never physically aged beyond her 10-year-old body. Fed up with always being treated like a child, she wants nothing more than be a real grown up. She gets her golden opportunity when she unwittingly stumbles upon a magic tiara hidden deep within her kingdom's castle. It is an omnipotent magical item known as the Eternal Tiara, and will grant one wish to whoever possesses it. The catch is that only the chosen Platinum Princess can claim the tiara and make her wish. And Yucie has just been named a candidate. She's enrolled into Princess Academy where she'll learn what it takes to be a princess. She'll have to overcome many challenges and the other candidates in order to get her wish. 

So, to put it simply, a young girl who wants to magically become an adult must first overcome a quest and grow as a person. That is about as straightforward as these things can get, I think. The moral of the story is built into the friggin' synopsis! "You don't become an adult by growing older, but by growing wiser" Real subtle guys! In fact, it's pretty easy to draw parallels to FLCL here. Being superficially "adult" doesn't make you grown up! But this is a kids show, and that's a pretty important lesson to learn. What follows is mostly a lesson-of-the-week style story where Yucie works part-time jobs(part of the academy's curriculum), makes new friends, and travels to the other magical realms to gather the pieces of the Eternal Tiara. It's a surprisingly engaging little story with fun characters and just enough individuality to be refreshing.

I love Cardcaptor Sakura. I used to watch it with my sister when it used to air on Taiwanese television when I was in elementary school. I've since then revisited it and it still holds up.

**[Itazura na Kiss](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=3731) (13-25/25)**  
7/10. Pretty cheesy but that's what I was looking for so I can't complain! I enjoyed the two main characters but everyone else was pretty weak to be honest. The second half was more like a slice of life which I enjoyed.

**[Fate/Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=10087) (7-13/13)**  
7/10. I started this two months ago and put it on hold because I wasn't really feeling it. But after picking it up again I enjoyed it more, I'll definitely watch the second season sometime.

**[My Little Monster](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=14227) (13/13)**  
7.5/10. Better than I expected, a good rom-com with a solid cast. The MC is a nice change of pace from some others I've seen. Definitely worth the watch, hopefully we get another season.

**[Ao Haru Ride](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=21995) (12/12)**  
7.5/10. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, I think I'll watch more shoujo romances. I wish [Ao Haru Ride](/s "it didn't have such an open ending though, they really built my hopes up for some romance. Guess they just want you to buy the manga to find out. But I suppose an open ending is preferable to an original ending, so I can't be too mad."). Worth watching, definitely!

**[K-On!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On!) (1-5/13)**  
I was told there would be cute girls doing cute things and that's pretty much what I'm getting! It's a nice change of pace from my usual choice of dramatic shows.

Woo one of my favorite parts of the week!

[Ano Natsu de Matteru:](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=11433) (12/12)

I dropped this show a while back for some odd reason. I went back to it and realized that this is one hell of a good show. I still have a little bit of a problem with some of the characters that i'm not really gonna go into but no matter what this show is great and gets a 8/10 from me. [Ano Natsu spoilers](/s "That ending tore my heart out, cooked it for dinner, and then fed it to a mangy mut. Poor Glasses-kun")

[Kaichou wa Maid-Sama!:](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=7054) (26/26)

Easily my favorite Shoujo show. Everything about it was so likable and there never was a dull moment. Usui is 2cool4me and Ms. Tsundere is really indecisive but that doesn't matter because they go pretty well together. 9/10. Don't tell me that Kimi ni Todoke is better because I've already been told that millions of times. I'll get to it someday. 

[Noragami:](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=20507) (12/12)

Easily the best show I have watch this week. I really couldn't find anything wrong with this show. I feel like this show is perfect in every way. I may just have a shit taste in anime and can't see the flaws in it, and that's probably true. I mean it even has a reference to my favorite game series Monster Hunter, like Noragami you didn't need to earn these extra points but you did it anyways. 10/10 

[Jormungand: First season](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=12413) (12/12)

Explosions! Muscular men and women! Guns! This show is really fun and reminds me of my first time watching Black Lagoon. Little lighter on the cussing though. Koko is the best character of this show and really pulls everything a long. And Jonah is a beast for just being a kid. I'm excited to watch the next season and I feel like it's gonna get a lot heavier then what this season was, and I'll accept that. 9/10
>> ARTICLE
That's how I felt about noragami, exemplified by that fact that monster hunter is also my favorite game series. Season 2 is also really good but hopefully the novels pick up pace and we can have a final season soonish!
>> ARTICLE
In the past week I watched:

Zero no Tsukaima (all 4 seasons)
Started it knowing nothing, but it may or may not be a good idea unless your into stuff like heavy fanservice, or just a big fan of romance/comedy.
Literally half the show was fanservice, but the other half was a good attempt at plot...  Enjoyable enough, and has some feels to it [S2 finale i think](/s "Main character dies, so yeah. Feels. ") 

I also began a rewatch on Mobile Suit Gundam 00.

Ok so maybe it wasn't this week, but LAST week, I watched Log Horizon and enjoyed it, though at some points it moves a little slow (not necessarily a bad thing)
>> ARTICLE
So I have an exorbitant amount of free time right now due to my class schedule this fall. I've absolutely been powering through anime and manga like it's my job (because I haven't started my job yet), so I'll only talk about a few I watched this week. I've also recently found out what josei is so that's predominately what I've been watching as I happen to be 24/F who loves me some romance. 

[*Kuragehime*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Jellyfish)- This is a truly a fabulous anime with an excellent opening and ending song. I love the animation on the [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJoeGEEu5L4) especially. I think the characters are endearing, the story is a little something different. I've never been so excited about a cross-dressing male lead before, with the exception of Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club. If you like comedy, slice of life, and a scootch of romance please give this a try. You won't regret it. That being said, the anime sort of gives up the last episode because there was no chance for a second season. The manga is much more intricate and allows for more character development of the other Amars. Considering that I give it a 9.5/10

[*Natsuyuki Rendevous*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsuyuki_Rendezvous)- This is another josei. This is much more romance oriented. There is some humor in the form of the main man, Hazuki, and the deceased husband, Shimao, getting into funny spats. Hazuki sort of reminds me of a more self assured Hachiman. I thought the animation was gorgeous. I liked the first 6 episodes especially, be then it kind of fell off for me. Overall I would recommend this one. It was visually pleasing, romantic, and somewhat introspective. It gets a 8/10.

[*Kokoro Connect*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoro_Connect) 10/13 episodes- Like most people on this sub, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about after the best girl contest. I mean, how can this chick beat **Shinobu**?! Freaking *Shinobu*!! So I had to find out. Honestly, I dig it. I think the show does an excellent spin on a somewhat well established body switching scenario. I definitely will finish it soon. However, Inaba is no kiss-shot acerola-orion heart-under-blade. That being said, I'm thinking 8/10 at this point? It could get more points depending on the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter :(

Steins;Gate - It was just as good as everyone said it would be. 10/10

Ben-to - Silly and somehow entertaining. It was surprisingly good. I think I gave it a 7 or so.
>> ARTICLE
**Bakuman** has been my current "older" show watch. Since it's 3 seasons and 75 (?) episodes it's taken me awhile. I think I just hit the finale to season 2.

Really enjoying it. It does seem kind of slow at times, but I enjoy the quirky characters. I've never been a big fan of slice-of-life, but for whatever reason this story really drew me in. Started watching because of a comment from one of the Nozaki episode threads when someone asked if there were any other series that dealt with mangaka.

Also, so far, this series has one of the best bromances I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman. Amazing show, easily my favorite manga of all time.  But God dammit, pretty much all of the problems in that show would be solved instantly if the characters would have just fucking talked to each other about their problems.
>> ARTICLE
**Samurai Champloo.** I enjoyed Bebop quite a bit, so I thought I'd give its spiritual successor a try. I'd It has the same primary problem as Bebop did: the episodic structure of each plotline. However, it works a bit better here, since the plots tend to be less serious in this show. It's more about the dialogue and music. 
>> ARTICLE
I finished Durarara last week and gotta say I really like the show. I am looking forward to the second season I heard about.

I started Katanagatari as well and am watching 1 episode per day because those many dialogues are exhausting after an hour. It's a pretty good show but I was let down by the off screen fight in episode 4.

**Nodame Cantabile**

**[White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2) (2-6/13)** - Well, that's one of best romances I've ever watched, even tho it's pretty obvious how will it end (unless I am wrong).

**[Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9379/Denpa_Onna_to_Seishun_Otoko) (7-10/12)** - I love Shaft, I really do. Every single anime from this studio is awesome and this one is no different.

**[Haiyore! Nyaruko-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11785/Haiyore!_Nyaruko-san) (3-9/12)** - Great parody, laughed really hard few times, also love this opening, so catchy.

**[The Tatami Galaxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=7785) (4-6/11)** - It's just impossible to describe this anime, every single episode is really big dose of mindfuck. However this is enjoyable show.

Just marathoned Psycho-Pass due to my friend telling me I should watch it since Season 2 is coming out in a week away. Really liked it but I just wished some of the characters had better backstories. 
>> ARTICLE
Over the past 3-5 days, I've marathoned pretty much the entirety of the Monogatari series. Bake > Nise > Neko > Second Season > Hana.

Jesus christ some of these episodes. All in all, I loved the way the shows were paced and I especially loved the various animation styles and quirks. But some of them... the stories ended in ways that just made me shake my head and think, "That's now how this is supposed to happen..." The episodes which made me think like this seemed to exclusively be in Second Season. I'd love to talk more in terms of specifics but there is far too much to sift through now that I've marathoned it all.

The two arcs in particular were [Spoilers for Second Season](/s "Nadeko Medusa and Shinobu Time. Nadeko Medusa was simply jarring because I simply did not expect Nadeko to go quite so insane; I thought she would at least be talked out of it by the end of the arc. But that didn't happen, and no satisfying resolution was reached until Hitagi End. At least there's hope for her. As for Shinobu Time, I was enjoying it as one of my favorite stories in the entire series up until it made me cry. Although I've looked ahead at chapter names in the LNs not-yet adapted, apparently there's one called Mayoi Hell which gives me hope that we'll see Hachikuji again. I just hope that the name doesn't imply a sad end for her, and if someone's read the LNs I'd honestly love to be spoiled and told if she gets to come back from the afterlife.")

One thing's for certain though: if Taiga Aisaka had to lose to anyone in the best girl contest, I'm glad it was Shinobu. Also Kaiki is a worthy challenger for best guy.

**Yowamushi Pedal (38/38)**

I don't even remember why I decided to watch the first episode. But damn am I glad I did. This anime is WAY to hype to be about bicycles, and every single time someone activated another freaking trick during a race to "power-up" I couldn't help but lose it. The weakest part for me is the MC, and although he's pretty lame all around, when he starts to get serious I can't help but smile. Also it might seem insane to have 4 episodes to get to the first checkpoint of a race, but I felt like they filled the time well. Super fun watch, and I'm dying til Grande Road next week

Macross Frontier, just finished the first Macross and Macross Zero a few days ago and am about to start frontier. Not sure if I'll like it, I don't like the design of the Main characters.

**GJ-bu**: Eh, it was there. I don't really have much to say about this show because not much actually happens in it. None of the characters really stands out as all that great and there were one or two scenes that were decently amusing. I didn't keep a count, but I think there were a total of maybe 5 scenes that took place outside of the clubroom.

**Hanasaku Iroha (15/26)**: Characters! Plot! More than one setting! I've watched 15 episodes of this in the last 3 days. Its fair to say I'm enjoying it, at least more than I did "Nothing Happens The Animation." Honestly, this has been on my 'to watch' list for a while, and I finally got around to watching it because of something an anonymous user said in the last Glasslip post. Thanks, random guy/girl!

**Hanayamata** was disappointing. The whimsical and fantastical tone of the first episode, particularly the opening and when Naru first meets Hana was different, and I would have liked it if it continued in that direction, however the rest of the episodes are straightforward cute girls doing cute things, dancing, and quite a bit of contrived drama. There's not a whole lot of Yosakoi dancing, but there's a good sense of progression start learning how to dance, making their costumes, suffering setbacks and continuing on. The drama is where I felt the show really fell on it's face most of the time. It felt very fake, drama for the sake of drama, and dealt with in way that seemed just too neat and tidy, like [spoiler](/s "Machi's issue with her sister"), and [spoiler](/s "Hana's leaving for America and then returning just as they were going to perform"). 6/10

I started watching [Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari) for the first time the other day. Everyone on this sub seems to love it so I decided to give it a shot. Its seems alright so far.

I went through Gunslinger Girl's first half. Great story, and definitely one of the best relaxing animes I've seen.

I started watching Oreimo. I almost finished season 2 and I feel like it's weird that I have mixed feelings given the type of show it is. 
>> ARTICLE
**Toradora (Completed)**  
I really feel the need to talk about this, as it left the biggest impact on me I have experienced from anime in a long time. This is a fantastic show. Easily one of the best romance anime ever. The sheer amount of emotion it can pack into a scene when it needs to, while remaining largely lighthearted and comedic the rest of the time is truly an impressive feat. The characters are brilliant, and the way they interact with each other is just delightful. I may not have enjoyed it to its fullest extent, but that's mainly because of stupid shipping reasons (Minori best girl, all the way). Overall, it's a very special experience, and something nearly everyone should watch.

**Mahoromatic**  
This is a fun show. I'm only 6 episodes in, but so far it's pretty good. It's a fanservice-filled, easygoing show, with a dash of Gainax awesomeness. It suffers from early 2000s animation, but it doesn't detract too much from my enjoyment.
>> ARTICLE
I did the first season of **Maria-sama ga Miteru** in the last week. To be entirely honest I'm not super sure about it, it feel like its a comedy but I don't know if I'm laughing at the right parts of it or if its just sort of awkward (I mean, it is awkward, but is it supposed to be funny awkward or is this just me reacting to situations as I see them instead of what they want)

I'm ready for season 2 though, to see more Very Good Friends
>> ARTICLE
Comedy? Marimite is a character drama. It doesn't shy away from humour, but they're not really the "point".

Also you should watch the DVD specials (Maria-sama ni wa Naisho).
>> ARTICLE
the bloopers, right? I caught those

but I dunno, there was something about the first season that made me think that they were sort of winking and nodding over some of the more over-blown yuri/class S cliches, a little bit of self-parody I guess

I might just be in the wrong mindset/too old to take high school drama seriously
>> ARTICLE
**Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei (2.5/12)**

Kind of funny, but not really pulling me in. I thought I would like it since I liked Welcome To The NHK and WataMote. 

>> ARTICLE
After the Aldnoah.zero ending and recent akame ga kill chapter I decided I needed something funny to watch, so I started watching Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun). It's hilarious.

i watched the entirety of Neon Genesis Evangelion, plus the end of Evangelion. I'm probably going to watch it again, and another time after that. I barely got the plot, i didnt even try to get the *symbolism* and *2deep4me meaning*

yeah, i'll just watch it again. Definitely one of my favorites.

Blew through [Hataraku Maou-sama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama!) this weekend. It was pretty enjoyable but I honestly think it was more slice of life than I was expecting.

I've been watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and I am almost done with it now.

**[Baka to Test to Shokanjuu (6-13/13)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6347/Baka_to_Test_to_Shoukanjuu)**

**[Baka to Test to Shokanjuu: Ni! (1-13/13)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8516/Baka_to_Test_to_Shoukanjuu_Ni!)**

I found this to be much more enjoyable than I first expected it to be, it is (as far as I know) as original concept (with the whole ranking system and summoned beasts). The characters aren't anything too special but they don't make the show worse either. Overall for both series I would give it a **8/10**

---

**[Welcome to the NHK (13-24/24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/NHK_ni_Youkoso!)**

I finally got around to finishing this quite depressing series. If you haven't seen this anime, then don't take what I said in the wrong way! It is an extremely good show with a realistic insight on the ongoings of a hikkikomori's (probably spelled that wrong) daily life and the struggles he faces. Overall I gave it a **9/10**

---

**[K-On! (1-5/13)](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=5680)**

One of the two animes I watched this week that focuses more on the daily life of high-school friends. For this one it specifically gears towards the revival of the light music club. I've mostly avoided the 'music' genre of anime and was at first reluctant to give this a try, but I decided to go for it and I don't have any regrets so far, I would give a rating but I haven't really watched too much yet.

---

**[Lucky Star (1-20/24)](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=1887)**

Another cute anime following the simple life of 4 (3 really) high-school girls. The comedy is good and original. It has a sitcom feel to it that works really well. I'd say it is a **8/10**

---

**[Clannad (1-5/23)](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=2167)**

I haven't watched too much of this yet to give a good opinion on it so far, but it seems like it will be a good anime.

---

**[Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru (1-6/13)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14749/Ore_no_Kanojo_to_Osananajimi_ga_Shuraba_Sugiru#MoLYyMsdyvx1Xvto.99)**

I only chose to give this is a shot as it was listed as a recommendation under [Oregairu](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=14813) as the main protagonists were both anti-social people forced to join a club (for completely different reasons). I'm not too sure whether I really like Oreshura or not, it isn't really terrible but it doesn't give me anything new either. I would say it is a **7/10**

**Mars of Destruction** (Completed) 


I wonder what their thought process was when they made this OVA. I like to think that they made this anime terrible on purpose. Imagine a group of the most imaginative minds in the world come together in a single room to create one of the worst anime to ever exist. They piled together all of their lunch money and hired the nearest person they can see to do the VA, Art, and effects. After everything was finished, they all watched it together and had a good laugh and released it to the rest of the world for all to see the master piece they had done. 



**Pupa** (Completed) 


I thought the art was nice but their execution of literally everything was off the mark. Sadly, I enjoyed this show too much. I don't know why, but I somewhat liked the story.



**Issho ni Sleeping: Sleeping with Hinako** (Completed)


I have never felt so awkward and pathetic because of an anime in my entire life. I tried to RP together with the girl in the anime and sadly, the girl in the anime was successful. I fell asleep because I couldn't stop not looking at the screen. She was looking at me the entire time and it just felt too awkward, but I did respond to her words. I'm never gonna RP with a video for the rest of my life. Never again.



**Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World** (Episode 1-5)


This was a breathe of fresh air. After binge watching all of those terrible anime, I couldn't help but feel ecstatic when I started watching this show. The story is great and the characters are lovable, but the art is sub par. I'm a huge fan of Mushishi, so watching this show which had the same feel as Mushishi but a bit more realistic is really great. I can't wait to watch the other episodes tomorrow.

>> ARTICLE
**[Fate/Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10087) (13/13)**

Probably the best contemporary fantasy I've ever seen (not that I've seen any others...) **7/10**

**[Fate/Zero 2nd Season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11741) (12/12)**

Better than the first season, still a **7/10**

Also, the soundtrack is godlike.

**[Fate/Zero: Please! Einzbern Counseling Room](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13263) (6/6)**

These are probably the longest specials I've ever watched. **5/10**

**[Fate/Zero Remix](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13183) (2/2)**

Good summary, although I probably shouldn't have watched this right after the series. **7/10**

**[Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5114) (13-19/64)**

**[Ao Haru Ride: Unwritten](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24151) (1/1)**

More Kou middle school backstory? Yes please. **7/10**

**[Squid Girl Specials](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9888) (2/2)**

They took the best episode of Squid Girl and expanded upon it in two specials. I'm happy. **8/10**

**[Yama no Susume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355) (12/12) + [Yama no Susume: Kabette Kowakunai no?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17341) (1/1)**

Beautiful (and short) slice of life series. Onto the second season! **8/10**

**[Fate/stay night](http://myanimelist.net/anime/356) (24/24)**

I liked this more than Fate/Zero, which probably goes against what everyone thinks. That or I'm literally Satan himself. **8/10**

**[Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6922) (1/1)**

So we'll be getting a TV version of this route? Should be interesting, but I didn't like it as much as the first route (maybe that will change with the release of the new series?). I plan to play through the VN sometime soon anyways. **7/10**

**[Gundam Build Fighters](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19319) (1-9/25)**

I also started watching this with no knowledge of what I would get. Even if it seems to be geared towards kids, I'm still enjoying it.

**[Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081) (1-2/15)**

This is a very strange show. I was expecting something similar to Mekakucity Actors (which I disliked), and I can say It's somewhat similar, but it's nowhere near as bad thus far.
>> ARTICLE
How...how did you like Fate Stay Night more than Fate/Zero? Be honest, was it the moe? Or the basic shounen protagonist? Or the horrible melodramatic romance? 

Sorry, I can't control myself when I think about how bad Fate/Stay Night is. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm reading the Fate/Stay Night novels right now and they are definitely worth the time invested. I've finished Fate and I'm on the last day of UBW and it's really, really good.

I have yet to watch any of the animated stuff ( Fate/Zero, Deen F/S N, Deen F/S N UBW ), so can't really say if all the hate the stuff Deen made is justified, but I'm definitely super hyped about the ufotable UBW adaptation.

From what I've been told, most hate seems to come from the bad animation quality and mixing up all 3 routes in to one. 
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero a 7, and DEEN's fate/stay night an 8/10? I'm... I'm conflicted, on one hand I believe you've committed sacrilege of the highest order, and should be burned. But on the other hand I feel compelled to pat you on the back for being brave enough to say it. 

Touch Approva, touch.

Danshi Koukousei no nichijou. 

I love comedies and especially nichibros because the anime reminds me of my highschool days and the weird stuff we used to do back then.This anime is hilarious. Great characters and excellent voice acting add to the appeal of the anime.

Giving it a 11/10 wouldn't make much sense but, for me this anime is on a different level when i compare it to my other 10/10 rated anime on my list(total of 11 out of around 180 anime i've seen).
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't give it an 11/10 but damn if I didn't love this show.  The characters acted the way teenage boys actually act, and it was so relateable in the funniest way.  I still wish there was more, there can never be enough Nichibros

Shirobako is the only one I could think of since that anime has no flaws at all (I haven't found one bad thing about it), all the characters are likable and have their own unique personalities and there's no single thing I hate about that anime. Also, it really describes the anime industry almost accurately, from the Director's draft to the dubbing, it's somehow educational in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I'd rather have a mind blowing, reality shattering show with flaws than a tame "flawless" anime.

Not to say that Shirobako's boring by any means, of course. I just think your argument is invalid. It's like saying a picture of a perfectly drawn circle is superior to Guernica, to take a famous example.

Well it is my opinion, though the way I explained it is really... bland since I suck at expressing my opinions to the fullest, but still, I really respect your opinion about *my* opinion. Cheers :)

I'm not saying your opinion is wrong at all. Give Shirobako an 11/10 by all means; it's a great show.

Gunbuster for me, very easy choice.
>> ARTICLE
Could you summarize gunbuster in one sentence to me? I head the name alot around here and would like to know what it exactly is.
>> ARTICLE
It's 6 eps long. You could just watch it whenever you want.
>> ARTICLE
It's the predecessor to Gurren Lagann AND Evangelion with a tinge of Interstellar and Pacific Rim along with having one of the greatest endings to anything ever.  

For being only being 6 episodes, it's utterly fantastic. Don't go in expecting the same amount of depth as a 26 episode series, go in expecting a 6 episode mecha anime. I reccomend watching it in one sitting, like a long movie. First 2 episodes might take a while to get through.

Then the sequel, Diebuster, is more like a mix of FLCL and TTGL. Again, only 6 episodes too.

>> ARTICLE
Wow, sounds really cool. Is this the kind of anime and think about the plot indepth or just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride?
>> ARTICLE
> turn off your brain

no
>> ARTICLE
I don't really have any "favorite" anime, since I just watch for the experience and hardly ever rewatch anything. What I do instead is structure my scoring system around what I liked the most. If something comes along and tops everything, then I'll just shift everything else downwards. I started with 6 as my lowest score and I'm down to 2 already. If I had to chose though I'd probably go with Madoka Magica, since it has everything I look for in an anime.

There are many anime that i would give 9/10 or 10/10 but one that I felt that deserves an 11/10 completley based on the Beautiful way they portrayed such an awful topic..... **terror in ressonance**  definitely gets my vote for this one, I would also have to agree with OP on **FMA:B** being a top anime aswell
>> ARTICLE
I think terror in resonance is one of the best anime to come out in recent years and is currently placed at my number 5 spot of favorite anime of all time.

People om this sub seem to hate it but I think it's one of the most beautiful audiovisual experiences out there
>> ARTICLE
People in this sub seem to hate on alot of great animes that really need to be watched in full depth and view its true colors, terror in ressonance was so beautifully balanced in all aspects, music, dialogue, characters design and background, and the underlining meaning of the whole show

I just realised I didn't put it with the list I mentioned in the description. 

I'm definitely adding it now.

Why do you even need an 11/10? Why isn't 10 good enough? Just adjust how you rate. For example I've only seen an EXTREMELY small handful of shows that I would consider 10.

Sorry that i snooped on your list, but 3/60 is 5%. Not extremely small.
>> ARTICLE
I have 5  "10's" out of 95 Anime watched...I think 5% is pretty on point tbh.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, 5% is pretty normal, not extremely small. There are guys with 1000+ shows watched, with 1-3 10s. That's extremely small.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's like 'this show poops on the rest of the shows'
>> ARTICLE
When that happened I had to tone down all the other series in my list 1 point. And now, when I rate, I think "okay, this felt like a 8/10, now let's take out the 'Not A Masterpiece' tax, so this is a 7/10".
>> ARTICLE
I'm the same way, if a show really is that great, sometimes it will change my opinion of previous shows. There were a few that early on I thought were absolutely perfect, then after seeing a few different shows, I came to the realization they were not as good as I previously thought.
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari for me. That show affected me in such a way, that I'm not sure I could emotionally handle a second watch through. 

The ending took me a good month to get over, and every time I think about I get stressed out.

Since I rate mostly on enjoyment, I really want to give mine to Oregairu, but I still think the second season could have done more stretching and may have even been too dense at times for anime-only watchers (despite it being my definite #1 favorite right now.)

Clannad AS or FMA:B is a really hard call, as I thoroughly enjoyed nearly every single minute of both series, but I loved them for very different reasons. Ironically neither of them are actually my favorite anime (Death Note), but that series I see enough of the flaws to realize it isn't actually a better series than the other 2, but I'm a huge fan of the psychological theme of that show which is why it's my favorite.

11/10 isn't flawless. Everything is subjective in art. I personally find NGE to be more of a masterpiece because of all of it's flaws 
>> ARTICLE
Explain.
>> ARTICLE
10/10 doesn't mean flawless. Citizen Kane is one of the greatest movies of all time but it's got a major plot hole. The point is that the plot hole doesn't matter to what the movie accomplishes.

This is similar to how NGE plays out. It's plot is a fucking mess and it's got so many wasted epiodes on stupid shit, but it doesn't diminish what the series really does or how much impact the final few episodes plus EoE had. The same goes for shows like Bakemonogatari and Madoka Magica. They surpass regular series because they're art, they aren't just your run of the mill 9/10 series. They do things that elevate them past just a show with a good theme or really good characters. They feel human, they resonate with people in the most amazing ways, and to me that's what elevates them past shows that you would just say were "flawless". 

For NGE specifically I was saying how you could really feel all the odd changes in the series and reading about what was going on during Anno's life and what was going on during production makes it very special. It really feels like it reflects the director.

no, bad Chun, you don't laugh at someone's taste. you're better than this!!                      
                     
as for whether or not any audiovisual work can be regarded as perfect, I think you have a point, and it stands on some interpretations of film studies and lit criticism, but, that doesn't mean you should posit it as fact, when that view is no longer one regarded in academia as being totally right. asserting that perfection is intangible and that there is no work above perfection makes sense when viewed with a traditional approach that regards factors like consistent delivery of formal and functional elements into the Mise-en-scene, but ignore the emotional, cultural, and humanist implications of how works may be able to delivery formally and functionally beyond the constraints of a medium, as post-structuralist and post-modernist critics emphasized through the 70's til today. perfection can be achieved between a retentive viewer and a work of art under the tenants of New Historicism, for example. relativist schools of critical theory in that same vein will argue that interaction between an artist, through their work, and the audience, through interacting with the work, establish meaning outside of quantifiable terms. I can pull up a few textbooks on the issue if you want me to I guess, but the generally accepted shift in current scholastic trends is that perfection *is* qualifiable, because of extenuating factors that cannot be understand through direct critical discourse. 
                    
                     
attempting to dissect a work on its technical merits will reveal this, as a work can easily be graded positively for how it conveys meaning in a way that reaches one audience (perhaps the intended audience) just as it may be considered a fault in the eyes of another audience (take the anime fandom buzzword "forced drama" and its wild implications when one tries to explain how drama "works" and how it doesn't; if it worked for someone, how can it be said it doesn't work? if it didn't work for someone else, how can it be said that it does? you and I have disagreed before on the delivery of OreGairu season 2, for example, and just as someone might side with you but go on further to say that it captured the emotional characterization of its cast *perfectly* and have that make sense in their own mind, someone on my side may go further than me and say it did so *worse than any work ever made* and have it make sense to them.)

> no, bad Chun, you don't laugh at someone's taste. you're better than this!!

I mostly agree with this. I just wanted to add that there is no inherent fault for an audiovisual work to be an imperfection because our assessments and analysis on them are based on subjective methodologies that may or may not work in favor of the anime we are focusing on. Does this anime resonate with this particular viewer? Is it compelling? How were the themes delivered to its audience? While one interpretive approach may classify a particular anime as perfect, others will most certainly find flaws found within its overall form. 

> you and I have disagreed before on the delivery of OreGairu season 2, for example

I don't remember this. Is it related to the shift with tone in Oregairu's narrative?

So! [Lets use this as reference](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3340) I know, it's the dub. It was the first one I saw on youtube.

So! Let's clear some things up as we begin: Right = Past. Left = Future. I can prove it but just take my word for it for the time being. And also: this is from the perspective of Takaki Tohno. I mean the singer is parallel to the point they he Takaki might as well just be the singer.

***

We begin by showing both characters stepping to the right as they begin this journey into the past(*It's like that's what this montage is going to do! wooo!*).

At [56:35](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3395) we see Takaki sitting ON THE RIGHT(*I actually really love that image. The second act is by far my favorite. The matching cuts of the first scene(26:05) and last scene(47:32),showing that even though he has physically grown up he hasn't moved on in any way since he was with Akari.*) being all reminiscent as we see what he was truely thinking about every time he sat up there on the hill: Akari.

At[ 56:44](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3401) we see that both did actively write letters back and forth and did actually look forward to receiving letters. at 56:46 we see a match cut that(*and if you look back on the previous images*) that show the passage of seasons. Sunny to rainy to snowing, you get the picture. This shows that it wasn't that the two had some great big falling out. They simple drifted away from one another as time passed.At 56:51 we see Takaki walk TOWARDS a mailbox signifying that he still believes that he will see Akari in his future. We then see Akari walking away from the mailbox and looking back. She has moved on. She will look back and remember Takaki from time to time but she is still moving forward with her life.

[57:18](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3438) is an interesting shot. He's boarding a plane to travel back to Tokyo. Leaving Kanae and returning to where Akari lives. Pay attention to placement and location: walking to the right(past), then we see Kanae in the center of the shot, stagnant. A couple images flash by and we see Kanae leave, once again, center of screen: stagnant.

[57:55](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3475) Things start moving fast now, I might not link to the specific times but I shall do my best! Nice quick little cut MOVING TO THE RIGHT of Takaki reminiscing about Akari.

[58:06](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3486) This scene I like more of how it tells a story of their entire relationship in under 5 seconds.She (Idk her name atm, I think it's Riza.)...Riza is dedicated to their relationship and pictures him as her future. However, While Riza is thinking about him, He's drinking at a Bar. We then get a glimpse of their actual relationship. They shared a bed but slept as far away from one another as possible. 

Continued: As he picks up to take a drink we see Akari, Happy and with another man. ANYONE who has gone through a bad breakup imagines this. (It's awful. Like seriously, when you are sitting alone at night, wallowing in your lonliness and there's that nagging thought in the back of your head that's telling you the woman you love is happy with someone else. It's shit.)

Next we had some nice little cuts of that match Takaki to the singer of the song. seeing Akari in places she simply wouldn't be.

[58:41](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3521) We have sort of an inverse match cut? Basically, what this scene is telling me is that back when they were both children Takaki believed he was always the one moving forward. She was the one that initiated with her letter after they had moved away. He believed that she was clinging on to him. We have a series of quick cuts that actually sort of illustrate that. It's brief but telling.

[58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5eMYyCYwVg&feature=youtu.be&t=3401) It's a bright new day! I believe this is signalling the turning point. Takaki has more or less moved on. He's gotten his life together.(*See end of post for details*) We see both main characters catch a cherry blossom(*The symbol of their childhood relationship*). Akari holds it for a second before releasing it, turning around, smiling, and heading inside. Takaki closes his hand around it. Not tightly but he doesn't let it go. He hasn't quite moved on entirely. 

At [59:12](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3552) there is a very unique angle to this film. I don't believe this style of angle is ever used before this scene. It's meant to imply mystery, or a question. You don't quite know how Takaki will end up. He's, at that very moment, in a state of not decisively left or right. He's been working to move toward the future and let go of his past but here he is, literally within arms reach of his past. 

Then at 59:21 we have the famous train scene. I love it. It's going right. And as I said before, Right is the past. That train crossing is the symbol of his barrier. He has crossed beyond his slump of dwelling on what cannot be( Once again, I'll explain after) but he still has the choice to run back to Akari. And then the train shifts to moving to the left.(*In my head I imagine him taking a deep breathe and holding it as he debates internally what he should do. Internally he agrees to accept this as they are and continue moving forward as the trains switch and he releases his breathe. His posture relaxes, and there's no one there. There's no longer that chain holding him back.*) 

He smiles faintly, and takes one final step to the left.

Also: It should be noted that the ending theme song reflects almost exactly how I believe Takaki felt about life in general( and how I feel about life.)towards the end of the film. Yes, it's slow, and plain. And he sometimes fall down and stop moving forward. But those are the times you need to push yourself the hardest.

 If you listen to the song, it doesn't have a steady pace. And it moves fastest after it falls. Whenever I listen to this song I imagine a person, walking . Slowly, speeding up a slightly at times. Then at [1:00:30](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3630) He falls. collapsed on the ground, he doesn't move and begins to cry. And then he starts to crawl forward, still crying, inch by inch. Then at [1:01:19](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3679), he stops moving forward. He gives up and remains motionless. Then at 1:01:35, he wipes off his face, stands up, and continues. Still simply walking, but standing taller than before. At [1:02:11](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=3731) he begins to leave the frame of the shot. Continuing towards whatever his goal is, standing tall.

People say that 5 Centimeters per second is a sad movie, sure. It's somewhat sad. But life is that way. Life is hard, and it really is those little steps day by day that help make you through it.

***

So, this has gone on for a while, but I said I'd inform you why it's happy. Flashback to 48:48, Takaki is working in a clean work space at home. His whiteboard says it is March, and he has work due April. During the rest of Act 3 (minus the very end when colors get bright again) it is February. The dates on phones indicates as much. Yes, Takaki quit his job and hit a low point, but he already bounced back. So I'm tired of people raving about how they think he offed himself after the movie ended. That is all. 

Anyway, I promised my friend to do ranked with him about an hour ago so I should stop. Feel free to message back with any responses or the like.

Edit: I forgot! little bit of a Fun Fact. Place of Takaki during Scenes:

Act 2: Left: 14 vs Right 33

Montage(minus the railroad Xing scene):

Takaki: Left: 7 vs Right: 15

Akari: Left: 7 vs Right: 15

Interesting eh? 
>> ARTICLE
I agree with some of your points. The one thing that I definitely agree with is that the film is not as depressing as people make it out to be especially because of the final cut revealing Takaki's smile.

> Right = Past. Left = Future

I'll have to watch the film again to see if this is true. This connection isn't continuous throughout the film's narrative from what I can remember. Thanks for the answer.
>> ARTICLE
The right/left is continuous in a sense. I mean, during Act 1 there was still a semblance of reality in the hope that Akari and Takaki would be together. But a point comes where they both actually accept that they won't be together. and at that point it shifts. Even Kanae has this, if you remember The Day following the ["Take one step at a time" thing Takaki told Kanae....](https://youtu.be/D5eMYyCYwVg?t=2363) Kanae runs from right to left. 

If you do rewatch it, literally hang a string to cut your screen in half. It makes you notice more.

Ping Pong the Animation is quite well-liked in /r/anime. It's episodic discussion threads often topped 100 comments, [with the last one topping 200](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/28kbjw/spoilers_ping_pong_the_animation_episode_11/). That's small fry compared to some of the more "mainstream" things like last season's NGNL or this season's Zankyou no Terror, but it isn't nothing.

As for its Japanese popularity, it should do reasonably well for an anime that is based on a manga that has been out of print for 17 years, but it is hard to say for sure because the volume 1 sales figures aren't out yet for Ping Pong. The Tatami Galaxy, another Yuasa work, [averaged 5665 per-volume sales](http://www.someanithing.com/142), which is actually really good considering that the source material it is based on was quite obscure. On the other hand, Kaiba, another Yuasa anime, didn't rank (meaning that its sales were likely very low). My guess is that Ping Pong will be closer to The Tatami Galaxy than it will be to Kaiba in terms popularity.

Thing is, it won't get popular past it's small following. It most likely reached it's peak popularity during its' run, not to say it doesn't deserve more popularity. It does, but it definitely has a cult following now though, where it'll be mentioned and recommended a lot by the people who watched it - like The Tatami Galaxy but smaller. Also, the animation really *was* terrible at many points, ignoring everything else. It's not unorthodox, it's just that Ping Pong was put into a really, really tight schedule:

>"For the whole animation process, an episode schedule could vary between two to three weeks. But that includes Genzu (Layout), Genga (Key Animation), Nigen (Second Key Animation), Sakkan (Model/Animation Correction), and Douga (In-Between), which means the pace is incredibly fast. " [\(source\)

The style's great, so is the cinematography - but the animation itself was not at points. 7 isn't unreasonable.

Impossible to tell. Shinsekai Yori was also unpopular while it was airing but after people realized it had a lot more meat to it, it is now #151. Ping Pong doesn't have that much of a hook though; it is a sport anime with slice of life and some psychology.

People will write it off because of its animation, just like people who refuse to watch pre-2000 anime for having "old" animation. I personally really liked the visuals, but there were plenty who didn't and I've also seen quite a few people say they hate sports anime. I think Ping Pong will just be a niche, yet highly regarded series. Sports and character driven series will never be as popular as action series are.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you(but I don't want Ping Pong to remain obscure ;__; ). And people don't understand that Ping Pong is not all about Table Tennis. It's more about the characters. People are more attracted towards anime that are about escapism (that's not bad) but, they should watch anime that give us an insight of life. They should try out new stuff. sorry for my incoherence. I am a bit distracted atm. xD

Is Tatami Galaxy praised here as the best thing since sliced bread? No? Then this sports anime has no way in hell becoming anything amazingly popular, despite its small cult following.
>> ARTICLE
hmm.. the opinion about animation is very subjective imo. I understand that you don't like the animation, but there has to be something to it that at least some people like it. For me, it was the raw custom brush strokes, which were quite visible in the BGs, and the panel type setup during matches. and yeah the expressions too.  
>> ARTICLE
I actually tried to show the "reason" why people are turned off by it. I personally love the aesthetic and the art, it's watercolor making it bright, it's vibrant, the characters look unappealing, which is deliberate, people aren't exactly always pretty, even more so if they are old. It gives off this genuine feel that it's *by actual people, by artists*.

The animation frames have a lot of inconsistency to the lines, it gives off that it's *flawed*, again just like real people are. The choppiness of the animation is also given some thematic depth. And ofc since the director is Masaaki Yuasa we can't go along without an expression on raw human nature(Kazuma climbing, Peco flying).

And the opening, it's just ***hype***!
>> ARTICLE
lol xD sorry, my bad. didn't see "/baseless hate" my apologies. and the opening is pretty cool. i love the scene where Peco is serving. His expression looks just so real. It's almost as if a real video scene has been edited and made to look like an animation.

For real, The Tatami Galaxy is quite popular on this sub.  It's more obscure than something like Attack on Titan of course, but it's not really a "hidden gem" anymore, at least not here.  Ping Pong was also pretty popular during its run, but I suspect it'll become more obscure over time.
