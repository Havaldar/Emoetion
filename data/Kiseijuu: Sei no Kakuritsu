The animation in some of the scenes was incredible. And there's like no censorship (as far as i can tell). Story is interesting, the weird snake parasite is funny and the MC has a lot of room to develop. Hopefully this becomes an amazing show
>> ARTICLE
One or two bits of censorship. When the drunk stumbles onto a body(?)in the alleyway, the stabbing scene towards the end, and I think a bit of touching up of the gore on the laundry rack, though that one was still easily recognisable for what it was.


Not bad, all in all.
>> ARTICLE
How can you tell?
>> ARTICLE
Censorship was really lacking here. I mean its there but its really hard to notice that a scene is being censored. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's at least not glaringly obvious(see Tokyo Ghoul)

See terraformers just big black circles on screen.

I haven't seen the episode yet but wanted to confirm if it had censorhip or not but I guess not since Parasyte took Hunter x Hunter time since it didn't had any censorship, and plus its Madhouse.

It reminded me of the little clips at the start of every episode of Kemonozume, right before the OP plays.

Nope. but fumoffu and ABP are both animated by KyoAni. so they're probably just referencing a previous work.

That's a bit closer to reality.

It doesn't take much to get any subreddit into an uproar.

I guess. As i said, I felt it was tolerable. Wasnt speaking for others. Pupa's censoring on the other hand was a deal-breaker for me.
>> ARTICLE
And then we realized how good we had it when we saw Terraformars absolute censorship barriers.
>> ARTICLE
I was so hyped for Terraformars, then dropped it by episode 2. The censorship was on Pupa levels of censorship. 

Honestly though, Tokyo Ghoul's censoring wasn't *that* bad, a lot of it was still bearable; but with Terraformars, it's like I'm just staring at my monitor while it's turned off.

Extremely pleased with the visuals of this show. I haven't read the manga (though I probably will when the anime ends) but it looks to be pretty promising going forwards.

I'm also very happy they used Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas for the OP. Not my favorite piece of music ever, but I do like seeing them around.

That explains why it reminded me of HxH's first opening, same band.

I think you'll find it was actually the first ED.

They've definitely adapted it to a more modern day. Though I've only read the first chapter or two

Manga is from 1988-95

Smartphones and Tablets, I feel like they are trying to make a point of its modern update. The father could have just as easily been reading a newspaper, whicg might have been easier to animate and made it more timeless
>> ARTICLE
in the manga, the teacher threw chalk at shinichi to get his attention and he caught it and crushed it with his hand instead of him playing games on his cellphone.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he was playing games... It looked like the right hand (Migi) was looking up human anatomy.

The teacher just made an assumption.

Not sure if would make it more timeless, Newspapers are beginning to disappear. I'm sure the next generation will think of them as a novelty of a bygone era.

Your face when a weird alien snake tries to climb up your arm to get to your brain, you think of doing an imprompt tourniquet, but when you locate your earphones [they're a fucking tangled mess: ](http://imgur.com/OZkFGoK.jpg)

See, that would have been the realistic thing. But then the show would be over already, wouldn't it?

Actually I neatly place my earphones on my desk before I go to bed, now I have a reason to though...
>> ARTICLE
gotta hand it to him, for an MC that seems very realistic, he sure thought quickly on his feet, I would be panicking so hard.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have thought of the tourniquet solution in that sort of adrenaline/half-asleep panic state and would just ineffectively try to block it with my hands. That said, once it was clear that the situation wasn't going back to normal, the thing makes its logical "no empathy" nature pretty clear pretty quickly, so I'd probably not bother trying to argue with it about leaving. I'd just ask about how it reproduces - you really don't want to wake up in the middle of the night to find out that it buds and the new thing is making a beeline for your ear again.
>> ARTICLE
I probably would have grabbed something and start hitting my arm really hard until the bug stopped moving, way to go me

The reason he did react appropriately though, was probably because of his arachnophobia jacking his entire body into high gear.

I was really hyped about this one, and I think I was right to be! A completed Manga being adapted by Madhouse, and visually it looks like they're bringing their A-game to this. I definitely can't wait to see more. 
>> ARTICLE
Is it supposed to adapt the whole thing? I noticed it has 24eps. Just started reading the manga
>> ARTICLE
I certainly hope so. I mean, I can't see why they wouldn't, even if they have to move into a second season. 
>> ARTICLE
The manga only has 64 chapters, that can easily fit into 24 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
How many chapters did they do this episode? I'm hoping for a complete adaption as well.
>> ARTICLE
Can't recall, but I believe its less than 3 chapters.
>> ARTICLE
The episode covered the first two chapters. It was almost a panel for panel adaption with some scenes taking place out of order, but only to build interest.
>> ARTICLE
As manga ready, I felt awkward that the order get thrown around like that, and at first I thought my source cutted out the first 2 minutes.

But pacing for the episode as a whole, I'm happy with it.
>> ARTICLE
God, I love Madhouse's work. Hunter X Hunter was nothing short of a masterpiece. And this is mostly the same team now doing Parasyte afaik.

Don't forget Death Note!

I thought there'll be more emotion into it like "ouch, that's cold".

But then it make sense to have little emotion consider that he is still adapting.

The timing was impeccable that made me laugh. After all that fight and no empathy and crushing the heart of his own species who he saw for the first time, it actually displayed concern when it was being washed :D

That corgi was so cute and creepy at the same time. I loved while it was flying it's little chubby legs were still trying to walk.
>> ARTICLE
This is a show that was being hyped by those here on the subreddit, and if the first episode is any indication, I believe it has at least gained everyone's attention.

The OP is pretty hardcore. It's hard metal with that iconic, throat-screaming  singing, but it is also quite good.

The premise seems very interesting. At the moment, all we know is that some alien life form attempts to invade a host and take it over completely. For what purpose other than living, we don't know yet.

In Shinichi's case, he was able to stop the attack in a clever way but still "lost" his right hand. At the moment, both he and the Parasyte will be working side-by-side.

Madhouse does a wonderful job again in terms of animation. One of the things I liked a lot here was the atmosphere. It's hard to describe but it felt like things were taking place during midday. As in, the lighting wasn't too bright or too dim, but just right.

Last note, it seems the mother has a past. Not only does the OP feature a small segment with her, [but this small frame here](http://imgur.com/6WmUEVn) is perhaps her dealing with a similar situation as her son? Obviously we can't tell at the moment, but it is interesting none the less.

Should be one of the better ones this season. Looking forward to where it is going, because at this point, it can really do anything. Oh, and the lack of censoring is great. Hopefully it continues this trend throughout the show!
>> ARTICLE
> The OP is pretty hardcore. It's hard metal with that iconic, throat-screaming singing, but it is also quite good.

I'm glad they chose Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and I think the song was average but very appropriate, but I'll be the first to say they still suck ass. (HxH ending is an instant classic though)

[What the fuck CGI, this is creepy!](http://i.gyazo.com/7771fc65e1ab40d4da5128f6699a8f5c.gif)

Clearly a parasite.

stuff of nightmares...
>> ARTICLE
That's [Norm!](http://i.imgur.com/CFwoZcI.png)
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming they did the background characters in CGI to cut costs. It looks creepy but if they keep up the high quality animation and use CGI for minor stuff then it's all good.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Ive seen it on the last ep of Zankyou when theres a lot of people on the street! And btw, is it a lot the difference of money between CGI and normal animation?
>> ARTICLE
CGI is cheaper. If I remember correctly, almost everything nowadays is traced over a CGI model to keep consistency, skipping the tracing and just doing CG is cheaper. With animation, though, it's much easier to make things smoother, where as the CGI looks very choppy unless it's 60FPS.
>> ARTICLE
>CGI looks very choppy unless it's 60FPS

You find Pixar movies choppy? Those are animated at 24 fps.
>> ARTICLE
Funny thing about frame rates.

Most films are shot/screened at 24 fps (or thereabouts).  For a long time, this was mostly because that's right about the point where the human eye starts perceiving it as "hey that thing's moving, neat!"

Eventually, high frame rates were feasible and available.  Problem is, people are used to 24fps, and so 60 seems, oddly enough, amateurish and silly.  Part of that may have to do with the way TVs handle 24fps on a 60fps display (even old TVs were 60fps!)

60fps TVs (or 60Hz, if you want to use that wording) use what's called a 3:2 pulldown for the display of 24fps sources, since 24 doesn't really divide even into 60.  Basically, using 3:2 pulldown, the first frame is displayed for 3 refreshes of the screen, while the second is only displayed for 2 refreshes of the screen.  What this means, effectively, is that the first frame displays for a full 50% longer than the second.  While this is barely perceptible, it seems to be enough to make things a bit of an issue, and is likely the main reason why 120Hz TVs seem so much better than 60Hz models.

On another note, the frame rate in Pixar movies (or in anime, actually, since most anime is also done at 24fps) likely isn't really an issue because there are certain things animators do (and specifically *avoid* doing) to make animation smoother at a lower frame rate.  The choppiness you see in CGI is likely because the computer is purely mathematical -- it doesn't really think "Hm, this needs corrected slightly," like a good animator will.
>> ARTICLE

No on the bolded part. Yes there's 24 frames in each second but with most anime only 12 out of 24 are unique frames and the rest are repetition. It's animation done on "2's." With cheaper anime it's done on "3's." This is aptly called Limited Animation.

Pixar movies are fully animated, meaning 24 unique frames per second or done on "1's"
>> ARTICLE
I don't know the exact figures but I think it's significant. it definitely helps to reduce costs
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that was really bizarre, it was just the one scene with really bad CG.
>> ARTICLE
thank god it was only 2 seconds long. it was a blatent attempt at saving animation money and i hope its the last we see of it.

Yeah I was like why did they even bother putting that in there when they could've just used a still shot of the city, school, or even his house to burn 5s.

Ah I believe I remember reading about this a while back. 

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas doing the opening.

A likeable main character. And is that? I-is that no censorship? Seems like it from what we saw.

Seems like we have a winner folks! (For now, we'll have to see how it goes.)
>> ARTICLE
Time to see how it compares to the manga.

Besides from shuffeling the scenes and not adding the bully scene + date and the penis joke its staying true to the manga. Also next episode is gonna be awesome.

Obviously they're going to cut the penis arm.

Dubstep in anime? Hell yes. Loved it in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, loving it here. Did it fit the situation? Eh, not entirely. But it sounded sweet.

Also, this show gives me a really Toyko Ghoul feel with the setting, am I the only one that feels that way?
>> ARTICLE
This is much, MUCH older than Toyko Ghoul. The manga is from the early 90s. It's pretty legendary in Japan. I'm sure Tokyo Ghoul was inspired by this.
>> ARTICLE
I think he was talking about the setting regarding "Monsters eating humans"
>> ARTICLE
Well, he didn't say either inspired at all. Just said they had the same feel/setting.
>> ARTICLE
i loved it, a great adaption but oh god the dubstep.
>> ARTICLE
Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas did the OP right? I recognize the singer from HxH ED1 and the Opening for Gundam Extreme Vs. Maxi Boost.

Also, no censorship! The beginning scene was crazy!
>> ARTICLE
A great first episode! I was afraid it wouldn't live up to some of the hype it was getting but so far it has me intrigued. 

Animation quality is top notch and with a show like this, with constantly morphing body parts and dynamic movements, it really is great to see the studio work so diligently in making it look good. 

I've heard the manga is pretty old, and it seems the anime is doing all it can do make it more modern from its setting all the way down to the soundtrack. I personally like the approach they're taking on this.

Premise is interesting so far and a lot of potential in how the character relationship between Shinichi and his right hand will play out (not in the usual way!). Definitely looking forward to more Parasyte! 
>> ARTICLE
This was really good. All I can say is corgis are gonna freak me out now.
>> ARTICLE
Hope you guys enjoyed the debut.

- the musician of OP sounds like from Hunter X Hunter ED 1
- the beginning of the story was a bit confusion, but I guess it did wrap itself up by revisit the night of 'invasion'.
-  'the hand' sounds to squeaky to my liking but hey I should be able to get used to it.
- there's a scene that bothers me about the 'the hand' [minor explanation spoiler](/s "each Parasyte can only 'expand' so much (it cannot morph into a dinosaur or a truck), but the telephone pole scene where his hand materialized into trunk-like structure, felt a bit off for me.")
- the animated art is better than I expected. It is also refreshing from modern cookie cutting templates.

Can't wait for next episode!
>> ARTICLE
The Artist for the OP is Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which is the Artist for Just Awake (Hunter x Hunter ED1) too.
>> ARTICLE
Ha great, thought so! Thanks for the info :D
>> ARTICLE
It was a pretty good first episode, I'm digging this already.

The only thing I thought it was weird was the dubstep which doesn't feel right with what is happening.

>> ARTICLE
So, this seems like a case of "what the fuck did I just watch?"

This looks really interesting, let's hope it stays this way.

And Jay for no (Tokyo Ghoul-like) censoring!
>> ARTICLE
Best premiere this season for sure. I love the attention to detail they put in, just in the first episode. [For instance](/s "the scar on Shinichi's mother's hand"). An absolute fantastic modernized adaption, thusfar.

For those who have read the manga, is this what you imagined Migi's voice to sound like? I always imagined his voice much lower and really slow.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really happy they're playing it "straight" without a lot of cinematic effects or fancy editing, but going for old school naturalistic build up. Solid beginning. 
>> ARTICLE
Strange how I didn't shed a tear for that poor dog. I'm guessing JoJo made me too used to these things. 

Anyhow its pretty solid so far. I love the animation in this episode, the character's movements are so fluid. Only gripes I have with it is that the pacing seems off (seems to transition from present to past too awkwardly) and the soundtrack doesn't really fit the overall mood. 
>> ARTICLE
The entire episode, whenever he was talking to his parents, I expected them so say something along the lines of "so did you take over his brain?" or just turn into creepy face traps and eat his head like in the beginning of the episode...
>> ARTICLE
This was pretty cool , the opening was awesome but i feel like its just one masturbation joke " did you find the snake?" without context that was a weird thing for a father to say to his son 
>> ARTICLE
Never striked me as a masturbation joke, he said a snake went through his arm, that's why he asked to see the hole in his arm to see if it was true or not.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, the accidental boob grab. That's number 2 in one day. It's my least favorite anime cliche... God I hope this doesn't turn into a harem. 

Also, I love the fucking MIB alien shape-shifter/skin-wearing type baddies. God, this whole show has a very MIB vibe. I'd be cool with a MIB style campy horror anime. It looks that way so far, and it's fucking cool, in a, "I'll suck your brain out through a bending straw" kinda way.


So far, it's definitely made my list. I like the world, the plot, the OST, and the art style. Can't wait for next week.

Didn't read the manga, but I really love how down to earth every character is so far. The MC isn't too good looking nor too shabby, no annoying pervert best friend and no oversized boobs anywhere!

Read it in a comic book shop when I was like 9 years old. Pretty sure I read it backwards with only one eye open and probably only looked at the pictures, though, so I can't really comment except to say there will be blood. 10/10, would ruin my childhood again.

Quick question? Is this a faithful adaption of the manga?

Just asking, because I believe that the manga was written in the early 90's. But characters are using smartphones.

Is it just updated for modern day?
>> ARTICLE
It's amazingly faithful so far. The manga was in chronological order, without the skipping, and a couple scenes were left out. The technology is just a cosmetic update - in the manga the earphones were plugged into a Sony Walkman instead, for example. Surreptitiously browsing the web on a smartphone during class (obviously) didn't happen in the manga, but is totally something Migi would do.
>> ARTICLE
Looking over the first few chapters, I'd say if anything the changes are an improvement - smoothing over some initial unevenness - and are faithful to the spirit of the manga as a whole.
>> ARTICLE
For example, before the scene with the knife, [he](/s "accidentally provokes a gang and his hand lashes around knocking them out") instead of the saving-the-kid scene. The former didn't really work for me in hindsight because [Migi](/s "would have killed them just like the dog.")
>> ARTICLE
I think that is the first time I have heard dubstep used in an actual anime for an action track... i like it!

The plot sounds like Animorphs.

So came into this without hype, not expecting anything and was pleasantly surprised. Got to say, after that very strong first episode, I will be looking forward to how well it can keep it up.

I was really hesitant to keep watching after the ['lolcomedy'](http://i.imgur.com/kdC1RuI.png) boob grab 4 minutes in, but goddamn they did a nice job with this. The foreshadowing, the crispy animation, and even the character designs are all way better than I was expecting. The music is kind of odd but I was surprised how well it fit; even that dubstep interlude near the end I enjoyed and felt it worked to convey the atmosphere properly.

I'm really, really looking forward to seeing how they do with the adaptation from here on out.
>> ARTICLE
The first episode turned out pretty well. Visuals are nice (based Madhouse) and all of the wubs. I'm still sceptical, but I'll see where it goes in the next few weeks.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I had low expectations of this coming in but it turned out to be great.  Good animation and art, loved the character designs, good music, a decent start to a plot and an MC who reacts believably to a crazy situation?  I'm sold.  Definitely my favorite first episode of this season's new anime.
>> ARTICLE
WOw, good stuff. Was a bit worried it'd get censored after Tokyo Ghoul, but they're at least masking any restraint they had well. Only things I can complain about was the awkward crowd scene of the people walking around the street. They looked really out of place. And the boob grab, I just feel like they're out of place 90% of the time in anime and the way people act around them is just dumb. But whatever, still a great first episode.



>> ARTICLE
Oh I had no idea that this had an adaptation starting up!

I loved this manga, and am glad to see that it'll reach a wider audience now.
>> ARTICLE
Solid start. I always commented that the manga was almost a perfect storyboard. To a fault. It lacked a lot of the depth that could be expressed in any written medium. However, an animated adaptation seems like a good way to flesh out the emotions and personalities of the characters.
>> ARTICLE
An exciting start at the very least. I didn't really like the first few minutes, but once it got going it got good!
>> ARTICLE
It was awesome ;_; So happy Fear & Loathing are back, I love their work. The animation was excellent, and so far a very faithful adaption. The breast-grab aeemed a bit unnecessary,  but hey. Anime junk.
>> ARTICLE
Aya hirano as Migi is fucking spot on
>> ARTICLE
Im hoping that this, Shingeki no Bahamut and Ufotable's new Fate series save this season for me. I'm not into harem comedies, glad there are still some series i can watch.
>> ARTICLE
That was pretty sick, not on like a explosive level for first episode(looking at you Tokyo Ghoul, still can't believe how hard you fucked up) but still a very good episode.

The ost is very daring in there use of Dubstep but the risk paided of an it really made the show even more amazing.

Don't know how I feel about the op but that ED is 10/10 for me
>> ARTICLE
Holy smokes, I'm so excited for this anime! I read this manga back at the library when it came out when I had no idea about manga and anime. The Nostalgia. Plus the first scene and the OP, that was awesome. Hyped for this 
>> ARTICLE
I was watching this show only because Aya Hirano was in it. But now I have a shitton more of reasons to watch it. Pretty awesome first episode!!
>> ARTICLE
Heck yea! This anime has an outstanding cast, dream like even. 

First episode looked good, can't wait for more.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that was intense. OP is some heavy shit, opening scene set the tone reeeaal quick. Animation is A++, typical madhouse. This story can go in so many different directions when you think about the big picture. The nature of the parasytes or alien thingamafucks is unknown, which makes me excited for what's to come.  The ED was unexpectedly soft after what just transpired, but I LOVED it. Fantastic ED. 

Also, the very first frame we see is of the earth as seen from space, and then "Someone on Earth had a sudden thought" and at the end of episode it finished the statement with ""Life must be protected" followed by the parasyte descending to Shinichi's house to take control of him. Is he "destined" for something? Does he subconsciously have an ultimate goal in mind? Lots of cool stuff happened here, looking forward to next week for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
Well this is wonderfully disturbing. I don't know if the manga this is based on got inspiration from it, but this definitely reminds me of The Thing (the John Carpenter film), especially the scene with the dog. Also; Kana Hanazawa is in this! (and Aya Hirano is the hand!)

Just finished reading the first couple chapters of the manga to see how it compares to the anime. Glad to see they didn't pull any punches with the anime adaptation. Also the changes made to the order of events made for some rather nice pacing and gave the reveals more weight. So far so good.

Tl;dr Madhouse is awesome as usual

That opening is definitely one of the best anime openings I have ever watched. I already need to hear it again.

This show is so freaky, I mean those weird aliens, the MC commented about it felt like he was talking to something without empathy (= mass murderers).

Wonder if the MC is going to turn into some kinda hero, taking out all the villains whilst finding out the truth behind their existence and reason for coming to Earth.
>> ARTICLE
Perfect adaption so far.

This is going to be good.
>> ARTICLE
Most impressive first episode after UBW for me 
>> ARTICLE
A little put off by the weird farting sound effects they gave Migi, but besides that everything was great.
>> ARTICLE
.........god damn, this and UBW has me so hyped.  You know an anime is reeeallly good when you are really bummed that the episode is over.  Something tells me this is gonna be one crazy, fun ride.  I love this sound effects for the parasite when it morphed and zipped around, it was weird, a little gross-sounding and flatulent in nature; it was fun to listen to.  I'm hoping the MC and the little guy really bond :)

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as the OP? Best OP of the season already.

I was so hype for this anime, but now I can easily say it will contest for best anime of the season. The first episode was just amazing.

I cant say i like the stereotypical anime troupes being added to the story but all in all it was a good premiere 
>> ARTICLE
The only thing that disappoints me is how they changed his character design. His manga-counterpart looked a lot more badass than the guy we got here. Still, it seems to be a really decent adaptation -- and they took the time to modernize some things! (As long as they don't step away too far from the source material, things will be fine).

Ok, manga readers is it worth spoiling myself ahead of the anime? Or is the show going at a good pace?
>> ARTICLE
This is the sexiest character Aya Hirano has ever voiced.

I went into the episode with absolutely no idea what to expect, within the first 20 seconds i had a pretty good idea where it was going...

Guess the MC wont be able to fap anymore.

He still got his left...

Nice, I'm liking this so far. Dupstep was unexpected, but I loved it. OST  seems to be great. 
>> ARTICLE
They didn't include the part where his hand becomes a huge penis.
>> ARTICLE
No they did not.

They cut out a lot of slice of life to fit in the dog fight.
>> ARTICLE
reading it out of MixxZine in the 90s, and then seeing this show come to anime in 2014 is pretty nostalgic.

if this show does well, hopefully it convinces the producers in japan to tap into more 90s anime.
>> ARTICLE
This guy can give head to himself..... no Mami...
>> ARTICLE
It's been so long since I read the manga it's based on, that I've forgotten most of the plot details (except the ending).  Which is great in a way, because the anime adaptation can be fresh and exciting.

I do recall thinking to myself, "holy shit this was awesome", upon completing the series.  If this show follows the source and maintains the visual quality of ep 1, then I think many people will like it as well.
>> ARTICLE
OMG. Had no idea what this show was about.

That opening scene took me by complete surprise, haha.
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh that episode felt so creepy but so good at the same time. 
I think that was the first time i hear dupstep in a anime
>> ARTICLE
I read most of the manga in my teens, and remember it as good.  The anime was really good!  Looking forward to the rest, a lot.
>> ARTICLE
I've never read the manga, but this was an excellent start to a highly-anticipated adaptation. I've heard the manga is fantastic.

I thought the episode was generally well-paced, and the soundtrack was quite good. No obvious censorship, and the animation is otherwise excellent as well.

All in all, the episode was quite good. I am looking forward to this show a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Great animation,awesome soundtrack,no censorship .... fuck yeah Madhouse!!

Want to know how dark TERRAFORMARS is Like OMG for real. At one point I stopped watching and stepped back. I noticed it was so black it was like I had my eyes shut closed. Ohh wait......?

Midori Day flashback. Less cutesy and more gruesome ofc
>> ARTICLE
Man, after Tokyo Ghoul and Terra Formars, I was looking at this adaption with a bit of dismay. I'd read the manga about a year before, and really enjoyed it, with its body horror, intense fight scenes, and sweet story of the invaders. So, I very much hoped for a good show, but was equally as concerned about stupid censors ruining everything.

I queued up the video...

... And then they animated the husband's head splitting open, and my worries were *gone with the wind*.

Dat OST. Dat animation. *Dat Mugi.*

**Fucking hyped.**
>> ARTICLE
Deforming monsters are more accepted than human bodies being cut up
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really like that they seem to be skipping a lot of the character development and jumping straight to the battle scenes.
>> ARTICLE
I would put this as a must follow even after just one episode.  The premise is very unique to me and I definitely want to see where this is going.  Psycho pass and this will probably be my series anime of this season.
>> ARTICLE
THAT WAS FUCKING NUTS
>> ARTICLE
Glasses... Huh....

You know what, I like it, fits his character. And I'm guessing he will start looking more and more like his manga version as the show goes on (The intro seems to hint that).

Also, the dog, I could not stop laughing at how different it looked XD.
>> ARTICLE
They changed a bunch of stuff and toned down all the gore, let's hope they make an anime original ending 
>> ARTICLE
Well, that was kinda creepy. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
I gave an ultimatum about this anime especially seeing how bad censorship was with Tokyo Ghoul, and I'm glad I was proved wrong. Great soundtrack (Dubstep made me laugh but it worked so well, plus I love dubstep) great animation (from the freaking eggs to the expressions on his face) and it seems faithful to the manga. The MC has been significantly anime-fied from the way he looks in the manga, but I'm cool with it. 
>> ARTICLE
gettin some kyubey vibes from that hand yo
>> ARTICLE
great animation!
>> ARTICLE
Shame that the trailer made it seem as though it was more of a horror anime.

I personally hated the dubstep and thought ruined the moment entirely, maybe with a longer fight scene it would've been hype but it was just a guy walking down alleys with dubstep as background..

The visuals and animation were pretty great (except for the CG crowd; god those were awful.) and the monster design for what little we've seen kind of reminds me of Nickelodeon's "Aaaah Real Monsters!" which is in my opinion pretty great to have (I'm down for **ugly** monsters for once and just not mythical 10/10 looking magnificent beasts.)

I'd say 6/10 for this episode, I really hope the plot gets something interesting otherwise I won't be returning to this one I think.
>> ARTICLE
Anime and Dubstep. This is the next stage of entertainment. 
>> ARTICLE
Loved to see how faithful this adaption was to the manga. Sure, they did skip some parts, it's still great. Also am I the only one who thinks that the screen transitions were amateurish? I mean no it isn't the worst way to do a screen transition, but I only wanted to point that out. The OST seems cool but it doesn't fit the anime imo (I like the style of the ost though). Parasyte is more an psychological thriller than a action anime. There are fighting scenes throughout the series but overall it's more psychological than anything. Don't get me wrong guys I liked the episode, but because I expected alot of this anime (well it's the replacement of HxH) it let me down. Eh 8/10.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed the large number of sudden transitions as well, though I'm not sure how they could've handled it differently.  I think this is the only show of the season so far that made me actively aware of it (kind of reminds me of live action dramas).
>> ARTICLE
I've only watched the first episode of Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, but the cuts in that were so bad that I don't think I'll be watching any more. The first scene cuts in the middle of a loud ballad! No fading of the music or of the screen, just BAM, next scene in a completely different setting with completely different characters. Very amateur.

I didn't notice it as much in Parasyte, but now that you've pointed it out to me, I'm sure I'll be looking for it in future episodes. Haha!
>> ARTICLE
Some of the cuts were just not integrated well. I'm thinking in particular of the transition where we suddenly go from Shinichi to the infected man from the opening scene. Was really jarring.
>> ARTICLE
I would never judge the genre of an anime on the first episode. 

First episodes are always designed to entertain more than anything else, and this is usually done through action scene and/or fights as seen in parasyte(among MANY others)


The show will get deeper and more psychological as it goes on. 
>> ARTICLE
Best premier I've seen this season thus far. Didn't think much of the dubstep or the OP but these are superficial things so they won't stop me form watching. I hope it'll be a decent story though rather than going the shounen battle route.
>> ARTICLE
This is pretty good. The OP and ED are good. I like it so far. Glad there's no over the top censoring. Overall, I'm enjoying it. They know something's up and they're on a quest to find out. A symbiotic relationship, nutrients from human, his hand keeps him alive. 

For those who've read the manga, how's the adaptation?
>> ARTICLE
Not that big a fan of the manga, but this was quite a good adaptation. Was initially weary of the modernizations, but they ended up not bothering me much at all.
>> ARTICLE
It was an okay first episode, but all I really expected from this episode was for it to introduce the plot. This is probably the anime I have the highest hopes for this season. I haven't read the manga, but I have heard good things.
>> ARTICLE
This show has a lot of potential but this first episode was very messy, in terms of editing, structure, soundtrack and the random out of place boob grab. The tone is all over the place. I would much prefer a more grim, ambient, dark soundtrack and a lot less jumping from one scene to the next so sporadically. The characters are also so oblivious and cheerful, even the MC is pretty calm for the scenario he's in. I think it'll improve but it just seems a bit off and I hope it can iron those problems out because visually it looks great and the premise is interesting and the scenes between the MC and the parasite are all good but everything else and the way they sew it all together just rubs me the wrong way.
>> ARTICLE
~~Just me that only gets 480p off crunchy?~~

Edit: Nvm, im just impatient.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to say a lot of negative things so ready that downvote button.

It's been a while that I've read the manga but I don't remember Migi being this nice that early on, also I don't like the voice but I'm probably going to get used to it.

What I don't like at all are the character designs, I remember them looking a lot better in the manga.

Also that dubstep tune felt really out of place, I don't have anything against dubstep in general though, it just felt weird.

The animation was a lot better than I expected it to be though.

Overall this episode was pretty disappointing but I loved the manga so of course I'm going to continue to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I don't mind the character designs other than the glasses they gave him only to make him look more fragile and weak. Didn't like Migi's voice either, I expected him to sound more normal, like a bro. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey dude. Finished the manga before watching this. I'm disappointed as well. What is up with the glasses? And the original character designs in the manga were better. They got Migi's appearance down pat, but the voice is off putting like you said. A few things out of order as well, but oh well. 

I just watched the first ep so hopefully I'm not as disappointed going forward. 
>> ARTICLE
Watch the OP again. In the last seconds after Shiniji fell and looked up he had his original manga design (after his change). I think they changed design is just to get a bigger contrast later on.

And I personally didn't see a difference between Migis behaviour in the anime and the manga. 

The dubstep thing......yeah it was weird....but maybe because it was something I haven't seen in anime yet...I think I will get used to that
>> ARTICLE
Go watch JJBA and Gatchaman CROWDS now
>> ARTICLE
When I first saw preview pictures of the anime, I was disappointed by the character designs, but I did a 180 when I saw them animated.
>> ARTICLE
Yay! Finally a mature anime that doesn't pander to the moe and cuteness fans! Let's hope the story is good. So far it's excellent. Damn, such gorgeous animation (despite that bad 3D cgi at the beginning)

>> ARTICLE
Great premiss but I really don't like the main character. It's going to be hard going to empathize with anything in this show. Just my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not very familiar with the source, but I think he gets a lot of development. I think he gets really bad ass.
>> ARTICLE
Hope so. It's just my opinion but I don't think the main character responded to the parasite the way 99% of people would. I think the writing is more that a bit off in that respect. It's hard to suspend my disbelief at this point. 
>> ARTICLE
It was alright, probably the weakest first episode of the ones I've seen from this season but I definitely see potential all the same. Didn't really care for the soundtrack, either.
>> ARTICLE
So is going to end up as a mix of valvrave and kill la kill? 
>> ARTICLE
No, it ends up as an absolute masterpiece way better than either of those combined.

Let's see whether they animated *the hand*.

The dubstep playing in the background during the fight scenes raised the hair on my back. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought the dubstep felt completely out off place last episode. This time around it (or rather the experimental soundtrack in general) was utterly fantastic most of the time. Especially the tense moments, hot damn.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the dubstep itself is hit or miss, but there's couple parts of the song that have good instrumentals to me, namely the beginning of it at 14:40 and at 15:52.  If you notice, they time these specific parts of the song to match the animation too (or vice versa -- though nothing too dramatic).

>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
I think she felt something like a fucking eye ball was touching her hand. Dunno guys but i have a bad feeling about her :(
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the parasyte doesn't produce any heat after eating his real hand and when she was holding his hand it was cold. So she ended up switching over to the other hand because it was warm. 
>> ARTICLE
It feeds off his blood right? So heat should still be circulating through it from that regardless 
>> ARTICLE
Damn that is a pretty realistic point I didn't consider. I was leaning towards migi popped out and there was a mouth or to her a weird sensation. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the questions are because he feels like a new person. She didn't expect him to save the cat at the end and deal with those bullies. So she was just surprised by how manly Shinichi is.

The hand switch at the end was probably because his ~~left~~ right hand was uncomfortable for her. Migi doesn't have the same skin as a human so it doesn't feel the same as when you hold a hand with normal skin on it.
>> ARTICLE
> ... his left hand was uncomfortable for her ...

It's his right hand she's holding at first.

So myself, along with other commenters are definitely suspicious that Murano knows something. The double " Are you really Shinichi-kun" along with her looking at his hand, then switching to his other hand really throws some weird signals our way. I guess only time will tell though

I don't know if there's enough evidence to be conspiracy-worthy.  I kind of assumed it had to do with his random competence in sports and standing up to the guys throwing rocks.  Both feats seem completely at odds with his character and that's likely where her surprise comes from.

Can we take a second to appreciate how good that OP is?

This is going to be the deciding episode for me, my mind tells me I'm overhyping it but my body just wants more. I'll edit this after I finish.

EDITS: *I PROBABLY MISSED A SPOILER TAG READ AT YOUR OWN RISK* 

Migi looking out for the homeboy, sinking mad baskets yo.

The dubstep use is meh, could have at least put a better track in. Also, phallic Migi is...... interesting.

These fight scenes are pretty good. I'm definitely enjoying all of the animation even if the whole eyes on a hand thing creeps me the hell out. Migi for best character in the series. I definitely like Migi a lot, his curiosity is intriguing and the fact that he will threaten Shinichi at any moment adds to why I like him. Migi also adds a bit of comedic relief here or there, even though it's not hilarious, it's still there and I like that. This episode was more of a filler episode it seemed like, maybe a bit of character development involved from Shinichi and Migi. I think I'll enjoy this series personally as long as the story stays interesting, I'll have my mind made up in the next few episodes.

The next episodes title seems like shit is going to get real really quickly. 

ED was really good as well, look at you Parasyte, giving us good stuff, you're alright Parasyte, you're alright.

I dont really think the OP is that good tbh.
>> ARTICLE
You don't like the music that much? Is it the genre?
>> ARTICLE
For me it's because he only sings with effect on his voice. That's my problem with the band in general. I don't mind voice effects being used occasionally for the effect, but when you always use it it just renders it pointless and irritating to me because I find a person's actual voice to be so much nicer to listen to. 

TBH, these guys would probably be one of my staple listens if it wasn't for that because the instrumental and screams are great.

I don't listen to that genre much and I have no idea who the band is, I just liked the music paired with the animation for it.

One thing I love about Japans music is that they dont draw useless lines between "hardcore", "experimental" and "pop". Its almost expected for such a heavy band as Boris (to put an example) to write pop tunes every now and then, and imbue pop within some of 
their most extreme songs.

In the case of this opening, the autotune vocals put me off for the first 20 seconds but as soon as the first heavy part hit I recognized it was going to be an excellent mix of a cathcy melody with heavier elements. Great stuff!

The OP is from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I feel that their music is very unique and I have to say my favourite is "Just Awake" from the first Hunter x Hunter ED

[This kind of stuff](http://imgur.com/omKRVFs) isn't even [the point of the show](http://imgur.com/p855GbC), but [it is easily](http://imgur.com/zMFJSbI) my absolute [favorite part](http://imgur.com/YpGDPnO) of the [show right now.](http://imgur.com/l2soyyX)

Sure, it's nothing complex, since it really isn't a romance anime, but just seeing them be happy together, as what looks to be an actual couple, just puts a big grin on my face. On top of that, Kana Hanazawa does wonderful work once again as her VA. :3

But guess what this means? They are making me love not only the relationship but also Murano. Which means, even if it happens next episode, I'll already be extremely pissed off and sad if they kill her off. I don't want it to happen, but the way things are shaping up, I wouldn't be entirely surprised.

Edit: Forgot some important words!
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if I've heard her before.. But her voice is very comforting. Its a bit like Madoka where you get this warm and relax feel having her around.

[From the intro](http://i.imgur.com/XuqoEsD.jpg) I'd say she'll be around for awhile.

> I'll already be extremely pissed off and sad if they kill her off

I think it almost seems like the OP is hinting that she's going to be his main reason for fighting, the way he's hugging her. It seems very protective, so I think most likely is that she's his main reason to protect people.
>> ARTICLE
To add to that, I think Shinichi is losing his shit a little so she's going to end up being something like his anchor to humanity.

I think "best girl" doesn't fully capture Levi.

Also the second I heard her voice in the anime I looked up her VA and was like (   )

The thing I like about this kind of romance is that it isn't forced and it's not the MC or Best Girl pandering for the entire series. It happens immediately and THEN we get more story. So good.

Yeh. In the second episode already this relationship evolved much farther than any relationship in Nisekoi most likely ever will.
>> ARTICLE
This show isn't nearly as dark and hardcore edgy as I thought it was going to be. A lot of this episode was "A Boy and his Parasite Pal" getting into awkward or cool situations while techno remixes of elevator music play in the background. The gruesome stuff and battles are still there, but I feel like there's a good balance, so everything feels important. I think I like that~

So where's the doujin where Izumi uses his Parasite's, uh... *shapeshifting talents* to, uhh... do *seedy* things to Murano?

...Actually nevermind. *Don't* find me that doujin.
>> ARTICLE
Really, because i found Migi's conversation with Shinichi quite interesting. Im talking about the one were Migi says that ite has never considered the life of any other being valuable, if you think about it its the same way humans think. Shinichi says in that same conversation that human life is precious, but why really, its only precious to other humans(and thats not all the time). Here they present this other inteligent life form that couldn't care less about a human's life, other than its host's of course, and that is something that not many shows have. This has great potential and i disagree that its about "A Boy and his Parasite Pal".
>> ARTICLE
This pretty much how senin manga works.

They explore a concept from various angles.

It's not just horror for horror's sake.

The OST for this show is pretty good. 

Oh, the hilarity. Migi's got an interesting mind. The shenanigans that could ensue.

Migi, seems a bit OP, but that's to be expected. From that last scene, I'm thinking may be transferring is possible.

Well... I for one am really glad I'm watching this. So far the series is going really well, and while I've never read the manga I'm thinking about doing so after watching the series through. 

I have a really bad feeling about what's going to happen with Shinichi and Murano, that ending was just too happy and cute for them to stay that way. 

Love the idea of them just being among us casually, very sinister - it gives me chills from the idea of these things just being out there. And it's been executing music and such really well.
>> ARTICLE
**My thoughts on Migi at the moment:**

Migi is turning out to be more of a mutualistic symbiote than a parasite. While he's taking food from Shinichi (shown in the first episode with Shinichi's increased appetite), he repays Shinichi through protection and assistance in daily endeavors. At this point I'm not sure if Migi is assisting Shinichi in small ways as part of his research or if he genuinely wants to assist his host. 

I'm guessing that Migi forms attachment to Shinichi throughout the series and slowly begins to grow more human himself. Migi himself is an organic creature with basic instincts like self-preservation. His lack of moral compass and emotion may be that he simply hasn't interacted with others enough to form these concepts for himself. Perhaps his connection with Shinichi will help him form his own desires past self-preservation and make him ultimately more powerful than his other Parasyte brethren.

**Thoughts on Shinichi:**

Shinichi is essentially useless in a fight. Migi is the one who does everything from attacking to defending. A Parasyte moves too quickly for Shinichi to avoid, so he has to depend on Migi for everything during fights at the moment. I'm guessing that this will change later in the series. For now, though, I personally am not fond of Shinichi jumping into dangerous situations just because his big brother Migi can win all his fights for him. He's getting more badass since the first episode so hopefully that will translate into more power for both himself and Migi.

Very interesting characters, hope they keep up these interesting developments!
>> ARTICLE
You can clearly see Migi his somehow messing up with his nervous system, and that's why his behaviour is changing.
>> ARTICLE
Not only biologically, Migi is also feeding him a different perspectives through out their conversations. Shinichi is mentally changing very slowly as we see at the "want me to eat you?" scene.

"Mincemeat murders" for example. Migi found it strange that human harbor hatred towards those who wants to resolve their own hunger: human is doing exactly the same toward other species (and mince them too).
 
>> ARTICLE
It ticks me off a bit though that point about preservation of life could be easily argued and logically explained to Migi: Humans are so successful at reproduction and survival (arguably dominant species on the planet) because they form groups and work together. Thus, by helping other individuals with self-preservation, one increases their own chances too.

Parasites, by being really efficient predators of mankind are a potential threat that would only escalate once they start multiplying, thus eradicating or helping eradicate them would be in interest of every single human, and by proxy also Migi's.

It's interesting how little Migi knows about itself. A good question for Shinichi to have asked when it was going on about parasites being more ecologically friendly than humans would've been, "hey Migi...how do parasites reproduce?"

I definitely noticed the hard/fast cuts more in this episode. The dramatic change from Shinichi laying in bed to the pancake restaurant was super fast as well as the last cut to "the two lovers."

The whole hamburger thing was left out as well, but that's okay. Not everything is going to be a direct adaption of the manga.

Fucking loved it.  Just loved the episode! Seriously it's good. I loved the part when he's like "You want me to eat you?!" with a rape face! On another note, that end of episode 2 showed what seems to be a parasyte hosted human about to mate. I am curious if that would create some kind of human-parasyte natural hybrid? Maybe I'm thinking too much?

I'm really sorry for this anime having to premier in the same season as Fate/Stay Night. Any other season and this show would be the top of the season, easily, with no competition.

Calm down tiger. I love Ping Pong as well but it's too early to dismiss this show outright

Well, that's a little unfair to say when Parasyte is only 2 episodes in.

Shingeki no Bahamut is looking pretty damn good as well. Terra Formars, despite the censoring, is quite interesting. Psycho-Pass 2 seems far more promising than this show too...

Honestly, so far this show and World Trigger are both on the bottom of this season for me (among the shows I'm watching, there are many I don't even bother with).
>> ARTICLE
There's so many good looking shows this time around. Unless some of them start tanking halfway through, I'll probably end up ranking this one of the stronger single anime seasons we've had recently.

Really? The quality of writing in Parasyte is far beyond Terra formars or PP2.

Top three for me is this, UBW and Bahamut.

Well it might be, but so far it's nothing really mind blowing for me.

Half of this episode felt like how a Hollywood adaptation of Parasyte into a romantic comedy would be like.

Which for the record Im okay with, since Migi is the best alien buddy one could hope for.

That whole "WANT ME TO EAT YOU ?" part was great! :D

>> ARTICLE
After reading through the comments I've notice slice of life scenes seems to be the least popular, at least for this genre.

One element i really like about this material, is how it knits everyday life with its sci-fi, you begin to relate "Parasyte universe" with our own. Try recall what Migi said in this episode, there are few good quote for thoughts.

Today's audience may not be as into multi tier story plot and just want some hot action (this may certain be applied to Japanese audience too), hence IMO it has been a difficult material to adapt all these time.

Young viewers, I recommend you to do some rewatch if you enjoy this anime, and focus on Migi's speech and the "parasytes' evil intends". The philosophy in the story started early and you will enjoy more as those words start putting more weight in later half of the series.

* "Its cold, Shinchi" please let this be a running gag  
* raising the real questions and contrasting points of views  

* I thought parasites with full control were stronger or did Mugi just kill him off guard?  
* nice catch but that dubstep playing in the background cracked me up  
* A little suspicious when Murano keeps asking him if he is him  
* Last scene looks like both of them have parasites, are they planning to create more parasites or some messed up baby?  
* That ED is a really nice way too cool off after watching this show.  
and im done, hopefully someone with knowledge can add to this so far?  
So far so good no censoring and the pacing was good waiting for next week

The obvious explanation for the hand switch in the end is that migi did something that she felt and she was freaked out. But my guess is she did something similar to what sichi did and has her parasite located in her left arm and felt nervous about it. EDIT this explains also the main picture where we see sichi holding his hand so we can see migi and next to him we have her holding up her left arm ( the arm she switched from holding hands with) in a weird for no apparent reason. http://myanimelist.net/anime/22535/Kiseijuu:_Sei_no_Kakuritsu  
>> ARTICLE
I had the same thought that she's also got a parasyte... but Migi would have alerted Shinichi if there was another one nearby, so I think that's a no go. 

I'm guessing migi feels funny/wrong and she wanted to change hands. 

Edit: that's shinichi's other hand in the picture, not the girl's.

>> ARTICLE
Is it me, or are the structure of the episodes kinda like the original Pokemon series? Shinichi does his own thing, then comes face to face with a parasyte then bam bam he wins. 

Kinda like Pokemon in the sense that they go about doing their own thing, then Team Rocket comes in and then does some baddie thing. Then at the end of the end of the episode, Pikachu goes zap zap then they win. 

So unless the anime starts to have any cool plot developments it'll get boring real quick.

I didn't think this show would be good but was I wrong it's a great show. Migi best wingman in the game 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely shaping up to be one of the better anime this season (along with UBW, of course), but that's to be expected given how popular the manga was.

I'm definitely curious about Murano asking Shinichi if he's really Shinichi. I doubt she knows his arm's been taken over by Migi, but it's obviously meant to make us wonder. I suspect that she just thinks he's acting much differently than usual...

Some comedy in this episode as well; the dick-hand that everyone brought up before the anime even started, of course, but jerking him off in the bathroom as well. This show is handling the balance well, unlike a lot of other shows.

I'm definitely hooked on this show so far.
>> ARTICLE
Loving the anime at the moment! The manga was fantastic and being able to see it in anime is even better. I am liking the dubstep music for the intense moments and humour in this anime. Can't wait for the next episode!

Why is this season so damn good?

[The definition of this season summed up in one gif.](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/stop_penis_erect_archer.gif)

It's nice to hear Hanazawa Kana's beautiful and angelic voice, again. 

This is certainly turning out to be a lot better then I thought it would be.
>> ARTICLE
The difference between a very good story and an absolutely amazing story can be hard to pin down. I generally think of resonance - every aspect of a story working in unison - as the major difference provider. And right now Parasyte has this resonance.

This episode focused a lot more on the parasite's sociopathic outlook. They are creatures of self-preservation and logic. More than that though, they are creatures of very little experience. When Shinichi and Migi were talking you could see this lack of experience - Migi's logic  had a lot of holes that are obvious if you understand human psychology. It felt like a child who thinks they found a loophole in the parent's rules.

I'm interested in seeing where this goes too. A lot of stories about a sociopathic worldview tend to fall short, but so far this show has impressed me with how well it's portrayed the parasites. I'm just hoping that Migi didn't protect Shinichi out of caring and empathy and that it was for self-benefit (although not necessarily just survival - enjoying the conversations with Shinichi is a sociopathic reason to protect him.)
>> ARTICLE
Not really digging this dubstep OST but other than that this is really quite enjoyable.

Though I don't like dubstep personally (god, I actually full on hate it), but it makes the show seem extremely unique.

I read that as:

Eh?.. What's slow about it exactly. 

Not only did the MC make up with the girl who was upset with him but their romance progressed quite quickly. 

All the while we learned more info about the parasite, got a peak at possible antagonists and had the first fight with a human parasite that offers some curious info.

Wait what?! When did that happen?? Is that editted?

It happened, but it was very brief/covered in the anime. They showed just the tip then cut out. I think it was in episode 2 when Migi first becomes interested in human mating rituals/sex.

Edit: [Found it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxdchWDdCRc&feature=player_detailpage#t=21)


>> ARTICLE
Thats hilarious. I kept wondering why Migi never asked about the whole sex thing, thinking it was his first time finding out about it or at least in an attempt to explore it further.

it happens in an earlier episode in the anime as well. I think it was the same episode that Migi tried jacking shinichi off at the urnal

Satomi gained so much respect from me this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Finally! I never liked her that much, and more than one scene like this would have been better. But at the same time, if she died I think a little of me would have died with her. I just don't think I could have taken it ;_;
>> ARTICLE
and it only took 24 episodes for them to make her a real character.
>> ARTICLE
You're all making her out to be a one dimensional paper thin character when she was just scared to fucking hell someone she once knew and loved was floating away from her.

Being scared, being a coward, afraid, confused, these are all perfectly human reactions. But in an anime? Nope, you're an annoying bitch, quit your bitching, bitch.
>> ARTICLE
Come on, annoying characters can be real characters :D
>> ARTICLE
Which is funny, because everyone started the "Kana best girl" circlejerk when her entire character design was to simply be a stalker.  Me thinks people mistake character development for simple character interaction, and don't look very deeply when someone like Murano actually develops while Kana is only there to provide Shinichi with slight character growth.
>> ARTICLE
She was handled much better in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
But we're talking about Satomi's character in the anime series :\
>> ARTICLE
I know, I am just pointing out a flaw in said anime series.
>> ARTICLE
How so?
>> ARTICLE
I still don't really get people's criticisms of her. 
>> ARTICLE
She's a sideline damsel in distress who's main line is "Are you really shinichi?"
>> ARTICLE
People make fun of that line... But something was legitimately different and wrong with him. Heck, even the ending theme played on that fact.  As far as the damsel in distress thing... I've never really understood that complaint. There are plenty of girls who fit that description, it's a realistic character type. She played childhood friend who wasn't built to deal with the trauma surrounding their lives and was scared of shinichis character changes. Makes total sense to me and I thought she was an admirable character. 
>> ARTICLE
Her repetition of the line turned into a device for the author to easily write about "muh human" shinichi. She wasn't a character she was a plot device, and people focus on her because she stands out next to Migi and Shinichi as 2 relatively well-fleshed out characters.
>> ARTICLE
She wasn't a device. She is just a normal school girl, so she is supposed to act like that at the start. But in the end she stands up for him 2 times, actively **joining** the story, instead of just moving it forward and letting them carry it by themselves.

One with the cop saying he doesn't need to tackle problems bigger than himself, and the other with the speech. Also by simply deciding to stay with him, instead abandoning out of fear.

Her dialogue was bad, but it didn't take away that much from her character in the long run to deserve being called a plot device.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the line that's the issue. It's that it's repeated over and over again with no direct help from her. 

And those descriptions point out why she's not an admirable character in this kind of series. 
>> ARTICLE
honestly I didn't really see where they would have fit that in anywhere without requiring at least a few more episodes. I think they handled it as well as they could have.
>> ARTICLE
I would have been devastated if she died.

Shinichi and Migi relationship is one of my favorites. They try to understand each other and became stronger together.
>> ARTICLE
It would have been so pointless to do something like that at the very end of the story.  That's just being grimdark for the sake of being grimdark and would have hurt my chances of buying Parasyte when Sentai releases it.
>> ARTICLE
Plus actual romantic development.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i like the Shinichi/Migi Bromance.
>> ARTICLE
I was fooled! Totally bought it for a good 5 seconds when Shinichi missed grabbing Murano's hand. I was so pissed they were going to kill her at the very end of the last episode! Then it clicked and I realized I'm an idiot who's easily fooled.

At a time where it is normal for anime adaptations of source material to be little more than teasers, I must applause Studio Madhouse taking on Parasyte as a project no less than twenty years after the manga completed its run. The animation was fantastic, the music was #360NoScopeMLG420Blazing Dubstep but somehow enhance the overall show's atmosphere and the way they modernize everything while being faithful to the manga is nothing less than stellar. To a show that does justice to its highly acclaimed source material , I say...

Thank you, Studio Madhouse.

Have you watched Hunter x Hunter? It's what the Parasyte team did before it started and was given the exact same brilliant treatment.
>> ARTICLE
I felt like HxH is way better than Parasyte in terms of animation and quality of art. At first Parasyte looked pretty good and flowed well animation wise but it just got worse and worse to me, not ever as bad as Tokyo Ghoul or something but still much much worse than HxH.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly don't think they had anywhere near HxH's budget for Parasyte too.  I liked the show overall, but the animation was always just a 'good enough' rating to me.

If they give the same treatment to OPM as they did to HxH, the art will at least be up to the incredibly high standards of the manga -- as impossible as that may seem to readers.

How is One Punch Man?

edit: Started it. 1 Chap in, love it already
>> ARTICLE
It might be my favorite manga. It boasts Yusuke Murata's amazing art and it manages to be hilarious while keeping up the badass action. It will be one of the shows that /r/anime will be talking about the most when it airs.
>> ARTICLE
Good enough that people are worried that the manga will have better animation than the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Mangas have still panels so the artist can concentrate completely on how it's going to look. OPM has a very intense, vivid and detailed look that is rare in anime to see because the extra shading and lines would  take a lot more time to draw and color as well in animation which is done frame by frame. And as we know anime is 24 frames even if they do everything to improvise a workaround to do like 6,8 or 12 frames if possible.

And in this case they also need a lot of in between frames in order to convey the intensity and vividness putting even more strain on the key animators and giving extra work to the coloring crew.

Basically yes, I don't believe that the anime can even hope to match the manga's vivid detail, but I can hope that they give this to a passionate director who understands said vividness and can convey it through cinematography.
>> ARTICLE
It's *fun*.

One Punch Man takes the idea of Superman being "too strong for there to be any challenge" but *doesn't compromise*. It doesn't try to contrive any weird plot devices (e.g. Kryptonite) that do introduce a challenge, Saitama (the titular One Punch Man) wins no matter what, yet the writer always manages to create something that grabs your attention.

All that said, the main reason this manga is so popular right now is because someone else took the original writer's [art](http://i.imgur.com/gxX5z9i.jpg) and turned it into something [incredible](http://imgur.com/a/UoW6F).

Was glad we got somewhat closure on what happened to [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/0tYP0fs.png), but still wonder why Migi had to leave Shinichi while Uta's parasyte got to stay with him
>> ARTICLE
If you've seen the movie Her, I think it's a similar reason. Migi has pretty much transcended the physical world by all the knowledge he knows. By being constrained as just a talking organism on a dude's hand is no longer fulfilling. From what I can tell, Uta's parasyte was pretty dumb in comparison and nowhere near as receptive or calculating as Migi. He was probably content.
>> ARTICLE
Remember when Migi had to perform surgery on Shinichi's hearth? Similar thing, too much time out of Shinichi's body and inside Goto's changed Migi's structure.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think it really drained him. And he wanted some time to think on everything that's happened. He basically locked in with like 5 or 6 or maybe more others of his kind, and basically they all shared each others' souls and entire memories and life with each other. That's gotta be a *lot* to take in. Also he was already weakened from closing up Shinichi's wounds and everything, too, yeah.
>> ARTICLE
The manga explains a bit better that Migi wasn't weakened in that sense but that being a smaller part of a larger organism just gave him a different perspective than he had before. All the information flowing through him allowed him a different type of consciousness that he wanted to pursue further through "becoming" Shinichi's arm.

Ahhhh, okay, cool. That makes sense, too.

Btw, [Murano](http://i.imgur.com/rraSlyD.png) looks way better with her bangs down, IMO.

The last week of the season always feels so empty, there is always a drought of no episodes, for a few days, and it makes me feel sad when a great series ends. However, at the same time, I feel very excited for the next season, I'm sure there will be good series from the Spring season as well. (But honestly, why are almost all of the Fall seasons of anime so great?)

Farewell Migi, we will always remember a true bro, and a hero.

it was the ending of act 2, so to speak. Not at all uncommonly the emotional climax of a story

I don't think the creators would disagree with you, since a major theme of the show was shinichi wrestling to find himself, which was concluded at tamuras death. But the rest of the story was important for wrapping up the plot and examining some of the morality surrounding the parasites.

It was an awesome run!

Migi is gone, because [he is now a Village People](http://imgur.com/JT9WFWy)

So it started with Uragami killing people... And ended with Uragami killing people. *Neat.*
>> ARTICLE
Wait I can't remember that far back. Was there a scene of Uragami killing someone in the first episode?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.  Like in the very last scene before the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Migi MC of the year.
>> ARTICLE
Usual conclusion considering the seiyuu.
>> ARTICLE
I really would have preferred if we had a clearer sense of what Murano or Shinichi's dad thought of Shinichi knowing for a fact what he was.  It's hinted that Murano knows and doesn't care, because she still thinks he's human, but I would've liked it to be more overt.

Also, does anyone have any thoughts on where Migi actually "went?" He says that he basically has absorbed enough information and is going to try to figure out something greater about himself. Is he going into Buddhist self-reflective meditation basically? 
>> ARTICLE
I think Migi just recessed back into the subconscious of Shinichi's mind so that he can sit and think about everything for awhile. Maybe try to figure out what's going on and just process everything.  

I think that's exactly what Murano thought in the end, though. He wasn't one of the monsters because he behaved like a human, he had ethics and a conscience.  

Think of it like this, we have in the end of the series a face off between a full blooded human who is in every sense a monster, and a human who has an actual monster living inside of him who has more compassion and human traits than the actually untainted human holding a knife to Murano.  

I think that speaks well for how she felt. He doesn't need to be a human, he just needs to act like one. It's not who you are that defines you, but your actions and choices, to paraphrase that Mewtwo quote from Pokemon The First Movie.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I completely agree with you. After some more thought, I think your explanation is exactly what the show was trying to do showing Shinichi vs. serial killer dude at the end.
>> ARTICLE
It kinda took your comment to spark me to think about it, but, I think that's exactly what it was trying to convey, yeah. Humans don't have an exclusive right to being humane. Some of us are just downright monsters. And maybe all the Parasytes aren't bad, they're just trying to survive like the rest of us.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I just realized they just didn't mention his dad this episode.  Kind of an unfair thing to do, he went through a lot himself and makes the viewer believe he doesn't actually think that much of him.
>> ARTICLE
Murano has to know at this point. That conversation on the roof wasn't particularly cryptic, and probably just confirmed the suspicions she already had. She definitely knew something was up with Shinichi.And, yeah, I assume Migi is just floating around inside Shinichi, being cute little Migi cells and thinking about the meaning of life. A bit like he transcended from his physical state, maybe. 
>> ARTICLE
I like to think Migi is like Leto II at the end of God Emperor of Dune: pearls of awareness, lost in an endless dream. Aware, simply not awake. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so last week, I did some bullshit analysis of Shinichi's "philo sophia" jacket through the lens of Platonism, but this week, I'm thinking I might not have been far off because his shirt is also a reference to a philosophical concept. 

"Aporia" is a term used in philosophy which basically means that a dialogue or debate has come to an unsatisfactory conclusion, e.g. Plato's *Theaetetus*, in which Socrates and the titular interlocutor spend the entire dialogue attempting to define knowledge but never succeed. It leads me to ask, just what is the aporia of Parasyte? Most of the series' philosophical themes were tied off with a nice little bow at the end of the series. All except one: interspecies understanding. Shinichi being who he is, probably the most complete hybrid of human and parasite (vis a vis, Migi's cells inside his body and the dormant[?] Migi in his right hand), he is essentially the best hope for understanding between the two species, yet even he admits that the two will never fully understand each other. Shinichi and Migi's struggle for understanding ended in aporia, so Shinichi wears that "Aporia" over his heart.

This got me thinking about Uragami's hat, "Maxime." I think this can be thought of as a reference to the subtitle of the show, "the maxim," as "maxim" seems to be a derivative of "maxime," an early English/French word. Which got me thinking, what is the titular maxim in "Parasyte: The Maxim?" If a maxim is a proposed ethical precept, then what is, in short, Parasyte's ethical message? I don't think it truly has one. Perhaps, it goes back to the original meaning of the word, that being a self-evident axiom (hence the Latin term maxima, going back to the phrase "proposito maxima" or "greatest premise," according to Wikipedia). If we use this definition, it's much easier to identify the Maxim, as it is expressed at the end of the series: "We try to get closer to someone else until our lives someday end."

But if this is the case, why is Uragami the one wearing the Maxim instead of Shinichi at the end of the show? Well, I went back and watched the ending because I had a hunch, and sure enough, the last time we see, the "Aporia" on the shirt is when he has Murano's hand while she's hanging over the edge. After he pulls her up, we don't see it. We also see that Uragami's hat has fallen upside down when he's hit, so we don't see Uragami wearing the Maxim" again after that moment. Could it be that this signifies Shinichi finally gaining understanding? Shinichi taking down Uragami symbolizes his struggle for understanding, and by defeating Uragami and saving Murano, his Aporia is usurped by the "Maxime?" Something to consider.

Or this might all be bullshit. You decide.
>> ARTICLE
WHAT THE FUCK!?  
  
Should have known things were going too quietly for Parasyte. Don't you go getting yourself killed now Murano, you are all Shinichi has left now.   
  
Migi's gonna save her right? RIGHT!? OH GOD, YES!    
  
Damn, what an amazing end to an amazing series.  
  
I should probably rewatch this series again at some point. It should only take about an hour to finish the whole thing, due to how short these episodes are.

Some of the things Shinichi said in this episode were pretty deep but understandable and made sense. One of the many reasons why this show was one of the best this season.

>> ARTICLE
You know, I thought the previous episode was just a little bit better. The whole plot contained in this episode felt a little out of place. Not necessarily in the Man vs Monster theme, but there was just something weird about it. The conflict was over, but it had to introduce another conflict that could be resolved in ~12 minutes. Oh well, solid series, I've really enjoyed watching it.
>> ARTICLE
The only problem I had with the final episode is that it was somewhat preachy. I'm pretty sure there are some other things that bother me but regardless, I thought the final episode was a nice aftermath to the climax shown from the previous episode. Murano wasn't as annoying in this episode like from her previous appearances, Uragami's presence solidifies the notion of the complexity behind what it means to be truly human, and Shinichi embracing Murano at the end of the episode was a touching moment (even though their relationship could have been presented better in the anime).
>> ARTICLE
Is their relationship shown better in the manga? 
>> ARTICLE
The manga is from the 80s. Female characters were not ever well developed beyond damsels in distress. In the manga she has less lines overall imo. Shinichi is even more the focus and everyone else is just sorta there..
>> ARTICLE
I think it was just doing the job of tying up loose ends. This end being the serial killer dude.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I somehow completely forgot about that asshole. I thought he was just a Parasyte stalking Shinichi for a bit, until they did that brief flashback and I was like "Oh. OOOOH. *Shit*."

Yeah, the previous episode was really the climax. This one just tied things up.

I think there's a term for that.  "Epilogue" or something.

So, I didn't see anyone else point it out, but the sky when Shinichi falls and has Murano on top of him, it's the same sky and clouds as the final credits screen.  

I actually thought it was just going to end there. I'm glad we got a little bit more before then, though.

Oh man, such a good ending imo. Put a nice little bow on the series after the "final" battle of last episode. And this episode, in my opinion, really enhanced my disagreement with all the complaints about murano and her role in the story. True she couldve used more screentime, but the story is about shinichi and migi, and this episode (other episodes as well, but especially this one imo) showed how she has affected Shinichi and the story as a whole. From early on it felt like his feelings for Murano was what Shinichi was using to hold on to his humanity, and to watch him basically show his "monster" side of himself in front of her, just for her to stop him mid-sentence and tell him that he isnt a monster in spite of it all, man it makes me smile....despite the knife held to her throat. Anyways i liked Murano's character beforehand (because we were supposed to based on how Shinichi felt for her from before the series started) so i really liked how it all played out for those two. And Migi, of course, is the best wingman ever for making sure his pal keeps getting pussy.
>> ARTICLE
week of final episodes won't go easy on my feelings it seems

did this fully adapt the manga now, or is there some extra stuff to read up on?
>> ARTICLE
this is the full adaption of manga
>> ARTICLE
For me, I think that this show was a 10/10 not because it was perfect by any means, but more so for the some of its parts. I think the soundtrack and animation were consistently good throughout, and the biggest draw, for me at least, was characterization. 

Watching Shinichi evolve as a person was the most interesting part of the shown and, to me, seemed genuine given the situation he was thrown into. The characters in general were great, I loved Reiko and her humanization, and the message behind the show is clear cut and is pretty powerful as well, though not necessarily a message we've never heard before. 

In general the story was pretty cliche and there wasn't any point where I was **shocked**. Every death was foreshadowed like you would not believe, and with scenes like Migi's "death" two episodes ago, the emotional impact that Madhouse could have brought was not present. I will say however, that Murano's fake death this episode actually shocked me, and given this show's themes, I had no reason to think she would have lived. It also would have made for a great message, that the person Shinichi loves the most was not killed by the parasyte's he tried so hard to protect her from, but by a human being's actions instead, that irony would have made for a heart-wrenching ending, but I'm glad to see the author went the other route and gave our hero a happy ending. Regardless, Parasyte never took any risks, but it still managed to tell a stellar story, though nothing revolutionary.

So in conclusion, the excellent character building, animation, music choice, occasional action scenes, and occasional emotional impact (namely Reiko's excellently directed death), as well as the fact that I just plain enjoyed every second of it, is enough for me to give this show a 10/10.

But what do you guys think? The show has it's flaws, no show can be truly perfect after all, but for me none of them detracted from the experience personally. What did you guys rate it?

Great ending to a fantastic series. Every episode delivered in one way or another. No filler, just awesome awesome stuff. Props to Madhouse for another masterful adaptation. :)

I'm a little late to the party but i noticed something pretty cool.  Early on in the series Murano is in Shinichi's right side but she looks at his hand funny and then moves to his left.  After that every other time the two are together in the series she's on his left side and he never touches her with his right hand.  The only exception was in this episode, first when they were walking into town she was on his right and then obviously after he grabs her he hugs her with her right hand.  I thought it was pretty cool that they kept that up the whole time.
>> ARTICLE
Easily best anime I've ever watched.
>> ARTICLE
Well guys, it look like it's over. But what the hell happen to the baby? 

Edit: I thought Shinichi and Murano were going to take care of the baby :( I wish the anime expanded their relationship.

And also the glasses girl? We had a mini arc with her and she saw a damn parasyte right in front of her then the parasyte went on a rampage and killed a bunch of students. After that she became irrelevant and we only saw her here and there. 

**My final thought on this show: Parasyte is a great anime series with good animation, a good story, great characters, and very good character development. The OST is not for everybody and the director is mediocre. The director does not know how to take an emotional scene and make it better.** **Seriously! He should have taken Reiko death scene and put it near the end of the episode instead of having it in the beginning of an episode. That would have been much better. Leaving the viewers with an emotional scene.** **Migi "first death" wasn't sad at all. Migi should have gotten flashback about all the things he has done with Shinichi as he was dying. It would have had more impact like that.**

Also I felt like it got a little too preachy in the last couple of episodes. But overall this is definitely anime of the year (2014).
>> ARTICLE
I can forgive glasses girl becoming irrelevant because I didn't really care about that particular part of the story. But the baby thing kind of annoys me. I think Tamura Reiko's arc was easily the best and in the end she died entrusting her baby to Shinichi. I realize he was still a high school student, but it annoys me that the baby was immediately handed off after that and then forgotten.
>> ARTICLE
> Migi "first death" wasn't sad at all.
  
Are you shitting me? I was bawling my eyes out when I thought Migi had died.

Unless I'm forgetting something, I would assume the police took custody of the baby and put it up for adoption.

And it's over. God, what a ride.  
So Migi's gone to sleep, and Shinichi's life is now back to normal. Except for, you know, his mother and everyone else who died.  
Did he get a new haircut? I honestly didn't recognise him at first when he met up with Murano and the others.  
Uragami shows up, which is good, as we were kind of left hanging last time we saw him.  
This show decides to get all philosophical at the end, which I suppose is logical. Quite a few ideas have been tossed around, and I guess explaining them all through dialogue can't hurt.  
Christ, that Murano "death" scene. When she was talking about "catching up" to Shinichi I was like, "Oh God, those are death flags." Don't do that shit to me Madhouse. Shinichi deserves a happy fucking ending!  
And we're done now. Thanks Madhouse, it was fun.

Can't help but feel empty :( For the past few months Wednesdays have been a blessings for the anime season Y.Y Great series 10/10 ALL THE WAY. 
>> ARTICLE
The final episode is better than the previous episodes but I can't see why people praise this show very highly. It currently has an 8.79 average rating from MAL but it seems like people are overlooking its flaws probably because Parasyte happens to be comparatively "better" than the other airing shows. I do think Parasyte is a good show but it is not a masterpiece by any means.
>> ARTICLE
If a lot of people enjoy it or it makes an impact on them, the MAL score easily goes way up, look at Shigatsu. And there are some shows that are way higher rated on MAL that I thought were worse than Parasyte.
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts exactly. Superb show, but calling it a masterpiece or an instant classic is a bit of a stretch for me. I gave the series a 7/10, which to me is more than fair. 

 
>> ARTICLE
....How isn't it a masterpiece?
Besides Murano's constant "You are Shinichi-kun, right?" I've found very little flaw to the show.
Everyone's motivations are in check, Music is amazing, Animation is amazing, Pacing is pretty damn good, Don't recall a 'filler' episode.

Protagonist progression was Great, Migi's Bromance and learning about empathy was awesome, the philosophical questions about Life, and humanity's role on earth.

What's not to digg?
>> ARTICLE
The following includes comments Ive made in previous discussion threads along with some changes and additions (this is not organized well so I apologize for that):


[Comment 1]: Personally, I think Shinichi, Migi, and Reiko are the only good realistic, well-developed characters in Parasyte. It was interesting to witness Shinichi transform from a regular High School student to a cold-hearted character who resembles closely to the parasites. On the contrary, Migi and Reiko become more 'human like' as the series progresses. Of the three, Reiko would probably be my favorite character in the series because Shinichi's transformation is the only thing interesting about him (he's more like a test subject in an experiment than a character I should be caring about) and Migi primarily exists to contribute to Shinichi's development and explain the bodily functions and mindset of parasites. Even so, Reiko's character conclusion could have been better. I can see why she changes her face to look like Shinichi's mother but it would have been better if Reiko reserved her original form and gave the baby to Shinichi so that we can easily identify Reiko as a motherly individual rather than Shinichis mom. The dialogue in Parasyte is pretty standard when it comes to narratives found in anime but it can be quite annoying to listen and read at times because of what people are saying (example: "Are you really Izumi" x 5, "my shining white knight" (or something along those lines from Kana)). Reiko's lines are the most engaging to read and listen to since she is a fairly unique parasyte who likes to remain observant and practical among her group of parasites.


[Comment 2]: Madhouse did a great job showcasing Parasyte in a modern style because much of the issues and overarching themes found in the anime (and manga) series are absolutely relevant today. The story is very promising as well and it has a lot of potential to engage anime watchers into a horror-like anime with prevalent social and moral issues. It's too bad that Parasyte's presentation is lacking in polish and this can be easily noticed when you recognize the declining animation quality and mediocre shots of animated scenes. Consider this, the opening scene for the first episode of Parasyte reveals the parasites as monsters that can morph into disfigured and horrifying abominations (the parasite that ate the lady's head and the dog-parasite thing). Now, the animation quality of parasites morphing into combat forms or anything else is only decent and the show slowly loses its body-horror elements (Reiko splitting her head into two in front of a couple). While Parasyte may not try to be a body-horror anime, it could have been one and it would mix really well with the themes it has going with it (monsters being humans and humans being monsters).


[Comment 3 (this comment is on the sex scene)]: Shinichi and Murano's relationship 'highlights' have been Murano's constant questioning on Shinichi's identity and her later realization of Shinichi's human character still intact (during Reiko's death- that was another ridiculous scene). Placing a sex scene after having those scenes in mind makes the sex appear meaningless because before that happens, Shinichi and Murano's relationship was bland and disappointingly pretentious in a way. We get it, Shinichi is slowly losing his human-self thanks to his parasitic partner and body. You don't need to spoon-feed us all this information through Murano's annoying questions. The original source material (manga) also didn't do an excellent job with it but Madhouse could have adapted this scene better. Look at the mayor's speech for instance. It was done better in the anime despite having some flaws in execution (specifically, the actual death of the mayor).


[Additional comments]: Like most anime series, Parasyte suffers from pointless monologue and lack of subtlety. Yes, it seems like a standard for almost every anime series to include main characters using first-person narration for explaining why he feels bad for killing Gotou or how he doesnt feel human anymore but that doesnt excuse Parasyte from using the same format of storytelling. The anime and the manga spoon-feeds us information that we can easily derive ourselves. Its pretty obvious that we can recognize what the author is trying to do with his work (role of humans on earth, identification of apex predators, humanity vs. monstrosity, symbiotic relationships, etc.) so I dont see why he or she thought it was necessary to explain us everything that is happening. The mayor tells us why humans are bad for the environment, Shinichi tells us why humans are bad for the environment, and once again Shinichi tells us why the humans are bad for the environment.

EDIT: Formatting. I can also make more comments on why I didn't like Parasyte as much as the people praising it very highly.

And you can totally do that dude. Thank you for collecting your opinion in one place giving me an easier take on reading it. It's always interesting to see how other people see the show :)

That will change soon. Happened with NGNL. Those ratings came out last year which makes MAL hilarious.

Let's not forget about the people who review anime series without watching them completely...

Yeah those guys are DA WORST.

All those 10/10's for the series. Makes you laugh when people use MAL as the go to for top animes and x is higher then y so thus it's better.

It is perfectly normal to think someone will rate a show 10/10 based on how much they enjoyed it and not on some technical merit or some idea that the story is an objectively well constructed masterpiece. If not then no one would rate anything a 10 because nothing has ever been made that couldn't be improved in any way. (except sakura trick)
>> ARTICLE
I'm talking about the reviews for the first part of the series. I rate series 10 too just on my own preference but reviews for the series shouldn't be up till the end on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
you should just blame MAL, they should just not let ratings until a show is completed airing
>> ARTICLE
I think it's an above average story. That being said if you read the behind the scenes stuff about the manga you find out about how the author was trying to make a profound statement about man's relationship with the earth. You can see where they were going with that, but it never resonated with me. Just came off as a lot of long winded monologues about the earth.
>> ARTICLE
The introduction of "Eco-friendly" messages would have been better if they were more subtle rather than "in-your-face." Sure, the anime medium is filled with monologues and direct explanations for an anime series' overarching themes but that doesn't excuse Parasyte from doing the same thing. It's also rather disappointing that something like Parasyte had a lot of potential with its premise but never reaches it at the end of the series.
>> ARTICLE
The "in-your-face" arguments weren't even that good. It seemed just a bunch of strawmans set up so the MC could break em down.

The story was great and then became directionless for a little bit. The high point of the series for me was Tamura Reikos death and even that was a random spike in a rather dull grouping of episodes.

I enjoyed the OST but I felt going a more traditional route for some music selections would of been better.

I give it a 7/10. Which for me is pretty good but the second half and the preachiness of it really dragged down the score.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was just above average as well, hence I rated it a 6/10.

Just like You lie in april was a mediocre melodrama and its score still skyrocketed to the top. MAL scroes are always like that. It's a site where 6/10 is considered garbage.
>> ARTICLE
Meh I think it deserved a solid 8. The only problems I had were with the CGI crowds at some times and Murano and Hayase being treated better by the adaptation. Definitely a solid anime and one I would recommend. 
>> ARTICLE
I personally always wait until the last episode to rate a show (except for long running series like one piece); but I rate based on enjoyment. If I rate a show 10, it doesnt mean it was perfect, it means I enjoyed the whole thing and nothing actually annoyed me much. It just means that it's one of the series I enjoyed a whole lot. 

Idk if that's why MAL has it super high or if it's people rating after a few episodes, but this is why I am rating it highly

EDIT: Just to clarify, it's not because I dont want to be critical of it, it's that, well, I dont really have a critical mind... Ive never really judged anything like anime or manga or video games or things like that, by anything but enjoyment; even if I do try to be more critical and analyze and all... I just, cant do it.
>> ARTICLE
Admittedly I'm just happy it was a good show that had a fucking ending. I'm tired of all of the manga adaptations that go unfinished.
>> ARTICLE
These are the early scores coming in. It'll normalize in about a week. This happens often with anime that have strong, conclusive endings (just look at Shigatsu). Pencilhands mentioned NGNL, but my favorite example is Mekakucity Actors, which went from somewhere around 600 on finale day to 2000+ within a week. Though my favorite counter-example is Shin Sekai Yori which went from ~800 to ~100 within 2 days.

Beautiful anime <3
>> ARTICLE
I'm on my phone so I can't write the fucking essay I want to, but this show has been absolutely amazing beginning to end. Easily 10/10, and probably sits in my top 5, if not my top 3. Expect a dissertation on this shit post-haste.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte... Such an amazing anime... MadHouse, you did a fucking great job with this one. I don't think there could of been a better ending to this phenomenal anime. Sayonara, Parasyte.

Felt like an epilogue, thought it would after last week's. Still, a nice episode and one last badass Shinichi scene to go out on. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about you guys, but that was a pretty fantastic anime.

It was, to say the very least...
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit I think I had a miniature heart attack at the end
>> ARTICLE
IS MURANO A BAD CHARACTER NOW, PEOPLE???!

What an ending and what an anime this was; everything feels so finished and complete - it's the right time indeed. I was never expecting such a relatively slow, thoughtful and 'happily ever after' ending to be the kind of ending that would fit an anime like this but it really does; this ending was well deserved.
>> ARTICLE
That was a very okay ending. Not great, not terrible, it's okay. Got to say though, I was at the edge of my sit when she fell. And I can't help but wonder how he lost his strength. Aren't all the mini-Migis inside him disconnected from the main Migi? Why did they all fall asleep with the main Migi if they're disconnected? Anyway, a very okay ending.

Score: 9/10
>> ARTICLE
Damn. Really thought we were going to get a sad ending there for a second.

I think we can all agree that this is AOTS and a likely candidate for AOTY

Gotta say I'm pretty impressed with this cover, usually english covers are un-listenable, I guess its because its not trying to be the original.

That was quite simply one of the best anime series I've ever seen to date, every single episode had me wanting more and I'm so very sad to see it end.

I can't believe this series is over... the last episode was just perfect. I thought it will be another cheesy and boring epilogue and then I realised that in Kiseijuu nothing is cheesy and boring. And Satomi.. She gained my respect this episode. 
I'm gonna miss this show. Goodbye, Migi! :(

Thank you, Madhouse, for producing such a faithful adaptation to the source material. You did the series justice.

Thanks and goodbye to Migi and thank you madhouse for an amazing adaptation and the original author Hitoshi Iwaaki.

Awesome series, will be one of my all time favorites for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Was an interesting series of I guess an older manga that had a decent adaptation. I was curious how the show was going to end itself when it handled Goto in the last episode, but right before the murderer guy showed up, I thought to myself what actually did happen to that guy? 

I have a lot of thoughts on the anime. Want to praise the parastye characters, music, animation, and a few of the human characters, but gotta give some negatives to other characters and many directions the plot went. This weird focus at the end of human life and how compares to other forms of life and how we're an arrogant species that deserved parasytes to eradicate us got a bit too repititive. Epilogue final boss guy also felt like he was included as a more shock and awe kind of event rather than anything important to the story besides a hint that Migi is still alive. I did really enjoy seeing some of the past characters show up in Shinninchi's mind when he said goodbye to Migi.

In the end, was a good season that I would advise others to watch if they didn't mind the medium-ish level of horror gore that goes along with the show. It is a definite edge of your seat kinda story and was a great ride for these past two seasons. 8/10.
>> ARTICLE
And the saddest ending  ever goes to... Oh never mind then.
>> ARTICLE
GG WP madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
Such a great series. Madhouse did an awesome job making this into an anime.
>> ARTICLE
She did it! Satomi managed to survive despite possible death flags. Yay!

What a wild ride this has been. I can say that this'll be an anime I can rewatch sometime. That doesn't happen often with me but I really enjoyed this show despite the few flaws it has. 

Looking forward to seeing how Madhouse does with Onepunch Man.
>> ARTICLE
We all knew when it was the right arm that was hanging over the side that Migi had taken care of it.
>> ARTICLE
I am of course curious as to the origin to the parasites and all the unanswered questions that come with it. But a part of me likes the open ending of it too, leaving you to ponder. Well done to the end. Tokyo Ghoul A needs to take some pointers. 
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte is seinen, adault manga design with taste of adults.

Tokyo ghouls is kids playing with blood.

I really like Shinichi's Philosophy that Humans protect the environment only so that they can survive. 
>> ARTICLE
I really love this adaptation. Even though I didn't read the manga, I know how well it was adapted (thanks to /r/tsumethai).

Also, it was awesome how character desings change a little after the timeskip, they really looked older, like they should, loved it, thank you, Madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
It was 6 months ago when we started this show. Time really flies.
>> ARTICLE
After finishing Tokyo Ghoul and Parasyte in the same day, thank the gods for at least one of them having a good ending. Parasyte, you will be missed! :D
>> ARTICLE
I find it kinda funny how once it ended and Shinji finally goes on a date with his beloved.

He technically got his right arm back, then the producers wanted at least a few more deaths, so they killed two people with one trying to help and the other an innocent screaming woman.

Kinda funny, but great ending to a great show.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really sad it ended, I have not been in engaged in a series as much as I was in Parasyte for so long. Although I expected more from the last episodes of the series to be honest but nevertheless they were great.

Damn, just thinking of all the nights I stayed till midnight to watch it although I have to wake up early the next day for uni, and then although I promised myself I would go to sleep as soon as I finish the episode, I stay another hour up high on adrenaline rush reading all the comments here in the discussions, and also sending texts to my friend complaining of how much I want the next episode to be released now and how the episode felt like 1 min. [The feels ...](http://i.imgur.com/bSBhOkR.jpg)

I'm late to the party because I wanted to binge watch it.

Well deserve 10/10. So many people said how good this work is throughout all the discussions threads, so I will only say how much I will miss this anime and the best girl arc: Kana!!

This anime was the best thing I've seen in years.

I was expecting Murano to say "because you're human"

but when I heard because you are Shinichi, I lost my shit.

SATOMI WORST GIRL

this (except the last line)
>> ARTICLE
Of course that was satire, but I'm glad someone agrees. :)
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it was too obvious to let her say because you're a human. ;D
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I found this ending weak compared to the rest of the show. I found that it simply didn't fit in. The atmosphere was completely different compared to the rest. It felt to me like they just wanted to show that humans can be monsters too, but this was already showed with the attack on the city hall. Before, I would have given this show 9/10, but will only give it 8/10 now.
>> ARTICLE
This series will definitely go down as one of the best anime out there.
>> ARTICLE
what a ride boyz
>> ARTICLE
Personally, the final episode was so satisfying, because significant scenes weren't cut out, and the story followed the original manga faithfully.  
Thinking back to the overall story, if this anime (or the manga) was finished at the last episode (Gotou's death), it might have ended up as an ordinary anime. Or rather, the manga wouldn't have been made into anime 20 years later.  
There was no parasite (except Migi and Joe) in the final episode, and it was a story of humans, but this episode was definitely an essential element to put an end to the Parasyte story.  
>> ARTICLE
Very solid end, though I wish we could have seen Shinichi tell his father and satomi about Migi and the parasytes- I believe, however, that it's implied he will tell them with the whole "I don't care if she saw him" thing.


Also, I loved the end with Satomi standing up for Shinichi. He was going to out himself as a monster, but after Satomi's words, I think he accepts himself as a human.
>> ARTICLE
Man I was gonna be so broken if Satomi died. Great show with a nice ending. I'm gonna miss watching the cliffhangers every week. And hey it actually ended with a ~~cliff~~building hanger

A very well adapted anime of a manga series that explores the nature of our humanity and how we live our lives. It's been an interesting 24 weeks. Here's a CR guest pass, enjoy: 6MS54HBABGM

So the team that worked on this also did hxh. Anyone with more knowledge than me know what their next project is?

Holy shit that ending they almost fucking got me fuckkkkk I'm so relived.
>> ARTICLE
So in the end a human was the most despicable character. Overall its been a very enjoyable series, had its dark and gory moments but it never relied on that solely unlike some other anime. A good take on the Man vs Nature theme as well. Character development was great, not only from Shinchi but also Murano at the end, and a lot of the parasytes (tamura reiko, gotou, Migi especially).

Rank 29 (10/10)
>> ARTICLE
This was by far one of the better endings Ive seen in anime, I liked the closure usually everything just gets left upended.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely one of my favorite anime.

I couldn't help but laugh at how adorable migi was on his two feet
>> ARTICLE
What a fucking scare that was at the ending. Man, it really got me good. Migi best hand :')
>> ARTICLE
I loved the ending. I clapped when the credits came up.
>> ARTICLE
Wow this has been one hell of a ride. Every minute of it. Thank you Shinchi and Migi 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the premise just sort of sputtered out "well the parasites stopped being bad, here's some spurious last episode character development, and we're done".  The series built and built and just kinda didn't really end up going anywhere.    
    
Yes, I am prepared for the downvotes.  I can take it.
>> ARTICLE
I know that everyone seem to think that it's a really great anime, but I really don't like the direction it took on the second half. 

It feels like the story have too many plot element and characters that are only relevant once and put aside. The alien threat shouldn't have been changed like that, I don't see why putting a badass looking parasyte with 6 arms bring anything to the story. Tamura reiko and the mayor were way more interesting. I don't care about shitty fighting scenes with Shinichi killing the "unbeatable" boss on his own like in one of these awfull naruto fights. 

The old lady character was one of the most useless character of the anime, the policemen are just killed and nobody cares, and Murano (and her friend) have no character development. 

For me it's really a big disappointment, I thought it was a 9/10 or 10/10 but now it's a 6/10.

Edit : seriously, you're downvoting me for that ? It's not a troll, I just explain what I think. At least you could contribute to the discussion.
>> ARTICLE
You're going against what most other people are saying, that means you're objectively wrong. /s
>> ARTICLE
Murano is a static character, not necessarily bad. We aren't following her story.

Goto (the unbeatable parasite) represents that experience changes people (after his "parents," Tamura and the mayor, were killed off, he saw that nothing can be done with trying to co-exist with humans, so he turns into a killing machine. He developed emotions and was no longer just killing for eating or survival. What emotions did he develop? Unfortunately, anger. Migi said his anger prompted and inspired his killing. Goto also said that he MUST kill shinichi to find CLOSURE. These are emotions and they came about from the horrific things he had witnessed.

Policemen: The story wouldn't have been as tight if we followed so many tangents.

The old lady represents human altruism without any motherly ties. Here we have someone who just met a stranger and she cared for him like one of her own. Isn't that what being human is all about?
>> ARTICLE
I agree with all of this, although I only had it at an 8 during the "good" part of it.

Another 10/10 for MAL

Oh man, this was great. A very reflective episode. Honestly, nothing could have happened and I would have been happy with it ending that way. Sweet dreams Migi.

Migi, you the real MVP

Thought that maybe the ending might be below par, happy to be proven wrong

it seems everyone is the same opinion as me, this episode has similar in some ways to NGE's final episodes and i liked it

Whoa this last episode nearly gave me a heart attack, but satisfying end to a great anime :)

"I felt been raped over 24 weeks yet I'm happy" that good.

10/10 also shinchi has the most devastating punch in the world he makes joe Frazier look like a chump

Perfect ending.

You did that because you're.... You're Shinichi kun.

And people die when they are dead...

Eh, I liked that line.

Her asking him if he was the real Izumi/Shinichi kun symbolized him fading away from his humanity. Her saying that he's really Shinichi kun marked his return to a normal life.

Overall disappointed in how this anime ended, started off with such high hopes. I can see why people like this sort of route though.

What a great series. Between Parasyte and Your Lie in April my weeks aren't gonna be the same anymore. So glad he caught Murano in the end. Was not going to be able to take it if he didn't.
>> ARTICLE
Oh the feels.

I dont know if there will be a second season or not since I haven't read the manga idk how much story is left if any.

But I am mixed about the ending.

Not whether its good or not, it was great. But I feel like they left some stuff unexplained but they also didnt seem to leave the series open enough to make another season in my opinion. 

Very very good show though.

That's the end. The manga ends right there, too, 20 years ago...

Interesting catch... But maybe just a stranger...

The sceptic in me was convinced that after shinichi pulled murano up, the screen would pan to her body on the floor beneath, dead, and it was revealed to the audience that the murano he pulled up was migi using his new intelligence/w.e to placate shinichi... 
>> ARTICLE
The voice of Uragami also voices Tarou from Shirobako. Can confirm he plays annoying but highly entertaining characters.
>> ARTICLE
This last episode kinda reminded me of Samurai Flamenco's last episode, in that the most high-tension situation occurs after the 'main villains' are gone, and the hero has lost his original powers.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta take a spot to say goodbye to this almost half a year of waitings and cliffhangers.

Too scared of spoilers to post in earlier threads. Goodbye Parasyte, goodbye Migi.

Anyone have the piano version of "Let Me Hear" that was played in this episode? It was too good
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi, Tsumetai.
>> ARTICLE
On the portuguese translation that I watched, the guy that shows up at the rooftop says "three people on the ground!" shinichi asks "three, did you hear?" and murano says "yeah, they think we're dead", I don't know if it was shitty translation or if both murano and shinichi actually fell. Help, I wont be able to sleep like this.
>> ARTICLE
I think they just meant on the ground of the roof, considering they wouldn't have been able to see all the way to the bottom of the building. If that's what you're asking anyways...

Migi became one of my fave characters ever.

Migi will be always the best wingman.

From someone that didn't watch the anime, but read the manga. Did we get the busses, military guys and big shotguns?

Yeah
>> ARTICLE
It just isn't right without the suspenseful guitar playing during the ending.
>> ARTICLE
so how long was the whole time-span of Parasyte? he was like a freshman at the beginning i think? and by the end they spoke about college so im assuming 4 years? 

>> ARTICLE
The story was like half a year ish, then there's a 1 year time skip in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I will never forget this anime, it isn't the best, but it just had everything I wanted from it and more
I will always recommend it.

Its biggest fail: it really couldn't develope more than 1 character at a time.
the lesson here:
We're just ordinary people... and that's awesome

Oh and thanks /r/anime for making me notice it, had a great ride with you all week by week

Step back for a moment and think about how you would act if you just nearly died from a knife to your throat, then nearly died from falling off a building, then suddenly find that you're still alive and some random people make a silly comment.

Being alive after nearly dying twice is probably one of the happiest moments of your life.  Why wouldn't you joke and laugh?

i just noticed in this episode that the criminal uragami has the same voice actor as shirobako's tarou (because finally he has a lot of lines for me to pick it up). it makes it that much funnier rofl.
>> ARTICLE
That arm grab at the end was such a ridiculous tease, I was like "no nO NOOOOO FUCK...wait...OH THANK GOD".  I was really looking forward to this show and I'm glad that I was.  I can't really think of a flaw, it was awesome start to end.  I wasn't speechless like my 10's in my list buuuuut a 9 out 10 is still an awesome score and this show deserves it :)  *applause*
>> ARTICLE
Anybody found it weird that the murderer guy didn't bother slicing Satomi before engaging Shinichi, and instead even throwing her out of the way? It felt almost odd for it him not to kill her. Or did he attempt to throw her off the building and that's why?
>> ARTICLE
What I Really hoped for was an explaination of where the parasite came from. Was it an alien life form or human created?
>> ARTICLE
The show implies they were a natural evolution somewhere on planet earth.  E.g. not human created and not alien from outer space.
>> ARTICLE
Awh, okey, interesting! Thanks for explaining.
>> ARTICLE
Hey anyone else thinks Migi sounds like Hatsune Miku?
>> ARTICLE
Amazing ending, probably the best anime of 2014

Now that its finished however and the loose ends have been tied, i still have a question. How was Kana able to "sense" parasytes? Knowing where the parasytes came from isn't important, and for any work of fiction the origins aren't that important, but how was Kana able to have this ability to sense them?
>> ARTICLE
Kana and serial killer-kin both had the trait. It was weird.
>> ARTICLE
After reading through this thread it seems I might be alone in the regard that I felt the wrap up of this series was a little weak and predictable. I expected a little more from this anime since it had such a wonderfully strong start.   
C'est la vie  
Regardless, a wonderful adaptation. MadHouse kicks some major ass as usual. 
>> ARTICLE
Time to shit on what everyone likes and state that while a pretty solid show, I honestly felt that the second half was a little bit weak and not nearly as interesting as the first. Still enjoyed it but I'm hard pressed to call this one AOTS, way too many extremely average or mediocre episodes in the middle where I felt it just sort of floundered about plot and character interaction-wise.  

That being said a pretty good effort for an adaptation of such an old and beloved manga.
>> ARTICLE
Idiotic ending. He didn't behave even close to how his character was portrayed before. Went full stupid at the end.

Whatever, overall good anime anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recall any other anime where the protagonist and heroine move really quick in their relationship without getting completely fucked over.
>> ARTICLE
A phenomenal end to the series. All the real action was resolved last episode, so this week's finale just focused on Shinichi, Migi, Murano, and the themes the show has focused around since the start.

This has definitely been one of my favorite shows this season. I like that it focuses on broader themes instead of just mindless action or being "thrilling" (or melodrama). Plus it has a great soundtrack...
>> ARTICLE
Sad to see such a great anime end. Still can't get over how Murano acts when someone dies close to her, she didn't seem to care at all that there were 2 dead people and a knocked out serial killer lying by them.
>> ARTICLE
Can't believe its over. Really had a great time watching this. I'll definitely miss Parasyte. 
>> ARTICLE
Did the anime finish the whole manga?
>> ARTICLE
This anime had a great general idea, and totally blew it. I mean, the last 4 episodes are full of such bullshit, I had really tough time watching till the end. Basically it's the typical japanese propaganda of 'being a good human and self-sacrificing for the community". PUKE!

And at last, when Satomi falls off the roof, I thought to myself, well at least the girl is dead, it was worth seeing that (good starting point for a sequel), but no - fuck - had to spoil it too with the fucking miraculous happy ending. That anime is a perfect example how to take a great plot idea and completely fuck it up. The guy who wrote it is a fucking brainwashed moron propagandist. I don't get anime anymore. Even the more ambitious ones end up just so fucking fairy tale wonderful pollitically-correct - makes me sick.
FUCK!

FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

I marathoned this series in 8 hours and it felt like 5 seconds. 

Literally five seconds.

That's it? I wasn't expected much, but that was really underwhelming. Overall 6/10 at best.

agree. good initial idea totally crapped by the writer into generic pulp. almost on purpose. like the guy wanted to push some pollitical-correct bullshit. annoying reverse trolling.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I'm ready to accept that Parasyte is over. I loved the manga as a teen, and the anime is doing it justice in so many ways. I'm so happy that it found a new audience, but absolutely heartbroken that today is the airdate of the final episode.

I'll need to watch it through again down the line.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I read this in my teens and it has always been a part of who I am.
>> ARTICLE
THis may seem like a pretty bold statement but in all honesty I have to say that Parasyte is perhaps the best show I've seen. I know that when people say that its usually a lazy way to say a show is masterful but I mean it. I cannot even sum up how I feel about this show other than that Mad House did a superb job of keeping to the source material and not pandering to what the main stream thinks is good *cough Tokyo Ghoul (which is not bad imo but nonetheless). It has truly been a pleasure watchin this show every week and I can only wait for MAd House to bring me back something to look forward to every week. Sayonara Migi

I have to admit I really really wanted Satomi to die. I really hate her.

oh and wtf:



random dude : -"There are three people on the ground there, too!"

Shinji:               -"Three, he says"

Satomi:           -"Yeah, they think we're dead."

Satomi:           -"hihihihihi" (laughing casually when there 2 dead people just next to them)
>> ARTICLE
I agree. They should have let her die and then show how Shinichi managed his life without Migi some years later... He could have become an author of philosophy books :D
>> ARTICLE
We all knew she'd be saved the moment his arm was out of view on the ledge. Anyone who didn't see it coming needs to go to their dark corners and reflect. I did expect Megi to actually appear tho.
>> ARTICLE
That's it, what a ride guys, Hope all of you truly enjoy this amazing story.

Been a manga ready, I'm very happy with what MadHouse has done for the series. It has its flows but I'm confident to say that the end result is capable to last few decades just like its original source material.

Now you guys are done with the anime, I highly recommend you to go through the manga if you haven't already. The anime skips few fine details as well as redesign some of the character develops, so expect more philosophical panels, light hearted talks/jokes, **Kana character development** and full on uncensored gore.

>> ARTICLE
The animation, the music, the characters, all of it fantastic. I'm so glad I picked this show up. I'd love to see more shows with this level of quality more often. Migi and Shinichi are easily some of the best anime characters of the season.

Came from the MAL forums, and damn you people are like a breath of fresh air compared to those haters. 

My god, all my favorite anime this season are coming to an end this week. Until the new season fully starts up, I'll absolutely be missing shows like this. 
>> ARTICLE
If shinichi didn't catch her I would've dropped the series.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped it harder than Murano?
>> ARTICLE
This show was great, and Madhouse did about as good a job as possible with the source material, and since they basically adapted it verbatim, any faults in the show are usually also in the source material.

  In the manga (and by extension, it's essentially carbon-copy anime) I though that the development of the story was awkward and strangely paced.  Some of the characters had traits that bothered me, too.  However, most of my criticisms are subjective and aesthetically based.  Otherwise, nothing glaringly wrong with the plot has stood out, and the themes of the anime are well explored.  I'm also a big fan of high quality animation, and this show did pretty well in that category.

I would probably consider this another victory for Madhouse.  With HunterXHunter they have shown themselves to be great at adopting battle-genre anime, and I can't wait until One Punch Man in the fall.

They couldn't go without that one last tense moment, could they? Jesus, I almost believed Murano was dead. What an awesome ending. What an awesome series. Madhouse delivers, yet again.
>> ARTICLE
This is truly the end of an amazing series. Shoutout to Madhouse for giving a great manga the anime adaption it deserved
>> ARTICLE
What a great wrap-up. Man, I'd be thrilled if they ever decide to make a spin-off of Migi and his dreams. I'd watch the fuck out of that.
>> ARTICLE
And now I have to deal with that hollow feeling one gets after saying goodbye to something precious. Make no mistake, Parasyte was precious. God what an anime. It started out as a story about us vs them, but in the end, it was just a story about "us". Didn't matter what the parasytes were or where they came from; they existed. As human animals we're always imposing our feelings on non-human animals, as if their lives adhere to the standards we give ourselves. Some species just live to survive. Us humans? We gotta put a label on goddamn everything. But it is impossible to truly understand other species. All that matters is that we find a way to co-exist. To graduate from parasitism to symbiosis. 

OK now I'm rambling. Sorry, I just can't accept quite yet that this show is over. I don't know if there will ever be anything else quite like it ever again. 10/10.

Thanks for the suggestion!  I've heard great things about it, but sadly I won't be making time for 148 episodes.  Work and other commitments aside, I'm just transitioning out of anime; I started the season with seven shows + Parasyte and ended up dropping all but said show.  This show was the darker sci-fi/horror modern-day show I've been looking for for a while.

Am I the only one who was bothered by the last scene? Shinichi just saved Murano, he has a knife lodged in his arm, the guy who just tried to murder him is lying on the ground 10 feet away, and so he starts talking about the puppy from last month? Shouldn't he be in excruciating pain right now? Or for that matter, why are they so calm?

Eh, maybe I'm thinking too hard about it. Overall, 7/10, was alright.
>> ARTICLE
> Shouldn't he be in excruciating pain right now? Or for that matter, why are they so calm?

No.  I'd probably laugh as well.  He'll probably be in pain in a few minutes when the adrenaline drops.

It's surprising how many people in this thread think that scene is strange.  I guess that's either a lack of life experience or a low exposure to fiction that depicts high stress life and death situations realistically, or with laconic variety.

The puppy conversation is not surprising.  Murano almost died twice over.  She's alive.  Shinichi realizes that he wants to tell her things he regretted never telling her before.  Just because the puppy scene isn't important to you doesn't mean it wasn't in the back of Shinichi's mind.  It's probably highly cathartic for him.
>> ARTICLE
> He'll probably be in pain in a few minutes when the adrenaline drops.

Ah yes, I do have to admit I overlooked this. I need to go back to Biology class, it seems...
>> ARTICLE
Or read / watch more fiction ;).

Adrenaline rush is often used for the characters to finish fights and such even with heavy injuries without breaking down until afterwards.

Probably a bit over-used tbh, but /shrug.
>> ARTICLE
You're not thinking too hard I'd say. He thought he lost his girl who means the world to him. He recalled that puppy scene when he thought he lost her so he brought it up. Also, why the fuck would he care about a mass murderer's corpse when he (or to be precise, Migi) just saved his girl. And who cares about the knife when we already know that he is not an ordinary human.

Also, to add to the puppy scene's relevance: sometimes random things make people remember completely irrelevant things. I wouldn't call the puppy thing completely irrelevant though because they had a pretty big fallout there.

It was going to be a perfect episode... Until Satomi survived. I liked her, and I think she was cute with Shinichi, but SHE SHOULD HAVE DIED. Give us somthing to feel sad about (I know, Migi and all but still)...
>> ARTICLE
Personally I found the whol episode a bit weak. I found that the atmosphere simply didn't fit with the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
I personally believe that it would be a nice ending if she had died, the rest of the episode is vert good.
>> ARTICLE
Drama in this episode felt forced, characters acted idiotically, pseudo-philosophical ramblings from Shinichi while appropriate to some extent felt overly long and redundant, Migi's fate felt cheap and Murano is still a terrible character.

This episode was mostly pointless, you get to see Shihichi and Migi give a poorly done farewell and some horribly forced drama where they try to build suspense with a laughable death. Murano is one of my least favorite charcters in a long time and most certainly in recent memory. I hope for Madhouses sake she's this terrible in the manga too because otherwise they are just awful at writing and directing female characters, this show had some of the worst I've ever seen. Very disappointing show overall, the second half in particular was pretty damn awful. Add this to the list of super hyped up but incredibly disappointing shows that I've watched the last 2 years. 

6/10
>> ARTICLE
Just finished the series, and I know I'm late. I'm just asking why you gave it a pretty decent score of a 6/10 with all the negative points in your comment. 

Did you think the first half of the show was really good then the second half was just that bad? 
>> ARTICLE
Well 6/10 is the lowest rating I can give something while still thinking it's watchable. More specifically I really enjoyed the show in the beginning, I'd say when Shinchi's mom died was around the time the show peaked. I didn't like how they developed pretty much everyone outside of Shinichi and Migi, but at that point so many emotions were high, a lot of intense and interesting scenarios were occuring(almost dying, Migi sacrificing himself a bit to save him, etc). As it went on the stupidity of the female cast was getting too be incredibly frustrating to watch, I forget her name but the older female parasyte was ok, but as for the students surrounding Shinichi I absolutely hated almost everything about them. I considered this show an 8 for the first half, but the last arc and the ending as a whole were terrible to me. 

Basically to stop myself from rambling, the beginning was good, the ending was bad. It always had problems but I felt everything was better early on. They didn't develop characters or plot in an interesting way to me. I was very disappointed in how it turned out and it felt like a huge quality drop in animation and artwork as well. It was still watchable though, it just went from a really interesting concept with good animation and good main characters to, ok main characters with a stupid plot, stupid side characters, and bad writing. Which is basically like most anime shows. Had it stayed consistent the show could of been an 8 or 9, it just didn't end as well as it started unfortunately.

Sweet, gonna have a parasyte showdown next episode. It'll be interesting to see how Shinichi adds to the fighting.  
  
Also I know they are a cannibalistic alien race, but damn, having the plan be that the bodies of the students will slow him down enough to stab him in the heart, is pretty hardcore.
>> ARTICLE
I think they both, Shinichi and Migi lack things from each other. Migi does not understand human empathy and how it actually works. Shinichi thinks they are monsters just because they eat humans. With his logic humans would be monsters as well.
>> ARTICLE
This isn't a plot spoiler but to be overzealous: [themes in the series](/s "cold logic vs. 'human' empathy is definitely a recurring theme in Kiseijuu, along with survival").
>> ARTICLE
I don't really get why Migi thinks he is functioning on pure logic. Yes he is fairly logical in his planning, but his goal is self-preservation, which is not defined by logic as much as instinct. I would argue that Utilitarianism is also based on cold logic, it just takes into account that you are not actually that important from a objective view.
>> ARTICLE
I think this is already pretty evident by now. Theyve addressed this in every episode thus far.
>> ARTICLE
Migi's lack of humanity is pretty interesting in that it contradicts the hell out of Shinichi. I think it's going to lead to a few conflicts and crisis points further down the line for sure. Probably going to end up getting one of them hurt.

another really great episode, as expected this is a real contender for AOTS. Next episode is going to be great
>> ARTICLE
If this ran in any other season this year it would be the clear front-runner for AOTS. Only in this ridiculous season does this show have so much competition.
>> ARTICLE
The only real competition for AOTY Parasyte has is Ping Pong.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/stay night? Does it still count for this year if the second half is in spring? If it does it seems it would be the clear aoty for most seeing how popular and hyped up it was. It is also backed up by beautiful animation, kickass action, a great story, based ufotable(with F/Z as evidence we can trust them not to fuck it up) and of course best girl.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, because the masses are always right...

I'm pretty sure F/SN won't be as good as Ping Pong or Parasyte. It will most likely look better, but It won't have characters on the level of Ping Pong or the highly acclaimed philosophical discussion of Parasyte.
>> ARTICLE
Out of curiosity, is the moral debate in Parasyte similar to that in Shiki? I just finished that series and it seems headed in the same direction. It was quite well executed in Shiki I find.
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, because the masses are always right...

While i agree that popular shows arent always objective great, there are plenty of shows that are both. As for my own opinion, i dont think ping pong was the greatest anime of the year. It is honestly quite difficult to say whether or not parasyte or f/sn will be as good, or perhaps better, than their source material. But just from the episodes we do have, and the good reputation of madhouse and ufotable, i believe that they can achieve that, and if so then both shows will be better than ping pong. I mean just comparing these episodes with pingpongs first 3, to me fsn is the clear winner of them all. But of couse that is a purely subjective opinion. And if everyone were to be 100% objective when ranking and reviewing the 3 then it is likely that parasyte would be voted aoty with pingpong in 2nd. But objectivity is not the only way ppl look at anime, nor should it be. So yeah i stand by my belief that if there is to be a 2014 AOTY tournament on the subreddit, or if we just look at mal scores, then F/SN would probably win(if it does indeed count as a 2014 anime). 
>> ARTICLE
I'm looking at the anime I'm watching quite objectively and I'm comparing the Ping Pong anime with the source materials of Parasyte and F/SN with other works of Madhouse and Ufotable regarding their faithfulness in mind.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe its just a difference in taste then. While ive never read the parasyte manga, when comparing the fsn source material(though i dont remember it all) to ping pong, i feel that the fsn anime will be better. Even putting aside the fact that i find pingpongs visual style very offputting while fsn is just beautiful and the differnce in the ost, i still feel the same. The only thing ping pong does better is characterization. And even then it is not like its a glaring difference, fsn does it quite well. Add in the amazing fight scenes(if we are to assume it will not drop in quality from what weve seen so far) and what i feel is a more interesting story overall then yeah i feel it will be the overall greater show.
>> ARTICLE
I loved Ping Pongs art style, but that's because I'm a sucker for weird styles. Whilst the only thing Ping Pong does better is characterization it is the only thing it tries to do and it does it masterfully. The only time if seen so greatly developed characters was in LoGH and this show was 110 episodes long. It doesn't try to be a sports anime, as the sport setting is only there, so that the characters can meet and interact with each other.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i agree that it does good, its the best of the year, but i feel like other shows, while not as good in that aspect, do better in others. I guess for me having a show with solid 8's across the board of anime rating criteria warrants a better overall score than a show with a solid 10 in one area, but 7s in the others. But to each his own.
>> ARTICLE
I think all of you guys are kind of short sighted. I mean this year had Kill la Kill (the second half), No Game No Life, Hanamonogatari, and Zankyou no Terror. If there was a poll, it would end up being between those and F/sn and Psychopass 2. Parasyte and Ping Pong might be good, but they don't have the hype of those other shows to pull poll numbers. 
>> ARTICLE
Well you can't say the masses are wrong? That way of thinking is much worse than being part of the masses. There is generally a reason why something is popular, and by not agreeing with other people that doesn't make their reasoning invalid...
>> ARTICLE
They're popular because they appeal to many people e.g. DN, SAO and CG, but that doesn't mean they're good.
>> ARTICLE
It all depends on what you consider to be "good". Generally a show appeals to someone because they consider it "good", even if you don't. It's impossible to say one show is better than the other without directly comparing elements, and even then it's all a matter of opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes you can distinguish between good and bad shows, e.g. Monster and Pupa.

Normally when a person likes a show I don't recognize as good, it's because they like the premise or they find the MC or the cast "cool" and they haven't looked into the psychology of the characters or the quality of the writing.
>> ARTICLE
AOTY is subjective is it not? While you might say F/SN is AOTY, I would say Parasyte is far better. I even love Trinity Seven to the point where it's an AOTY contender, most people would say it's just a harem, there's nothing special about it but I think it's one of the most enjoyable things I've seen in a while. AOTY is a personal thing you give something when you really enjoy it. 

Yeah something could be super popular but that's not what AOTY is. You could have a most popular anime of the year, but AOTY is definitely subjective. Yes you could have a vote on it, but it's still just a popularity contest.
>> ARTICLE
I think you have a point but, I believe AOTY and to a lesser extent AOTS go by a sort of unanimous sort of criteria. Most people can agree that Trinity Seven has been a fun series so far, don't get me wrong I'm loving it, but the story so far really leaves something to be desired. Granted it's 3 episodes in so obviously it has room to improve.
>> ARTICLE
> but the story so far really leaves something to be desired

Totally agree with you but the point I'm trying to prove there is the one you see. While yes it's lacking in story, I still think I've enjoyed it to a point where it could be AOTS for me, I have 4 right now that I can't honestly choose between and they beat out all the other anime I've seen this year.

It's just a really subjective thing, yeah Parasyte has a very good story compared to Trinity Seven, but I like the Trinity Seven characters way more and I love the humor in the show so it balances for me. It's all just subjective opinionated taste which isn't *bad* it just shows that we can't have a definitive AOTS/AOTY because people have different choices and tastes.
>> ARTICLE
With the shows that have finished so far I agree with you. Ping-Pong is also a completely different genre so it's difficult to directly compare it to parasite.
>> ARTICLE
Whoah there, we are 3 episodes in, I wouldn't say that it's a front runner for AOTY just yet. Barely even AOTS.
>> ARTICLE
I know the source material of both F/SN and Parasyte and I could see how faithful they've been adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Either way, it's not like there weren't any other good series this year, for example Haikyuu!!. Sure I don't know the source material for Parasyte but I do know that UBW should hold up fine, it's not nearly as superficial as Fate. The production quality from Ufotable definitely outshines Parasyte by a country mile though.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu was good, but it was nothing more, nothing groundbreaking or thought provoking. UBW is great, but Parasyte is a bit better. And I have to agree with you that the production value of F/SN is great on all levels, whilst Parasyte has to fight with a smaller budget and bad OST-placement. 
>> ARTICLE
I have been really impressed with the use of unconventional music in this series. They seem to make a variety of different genres fit each situation very well.

I was watching it with my brother and he had to shut me up about how impressed I was with their use of diverse but really modern music in an adaptation of an 80`s manga. This is truly how reinterpretations should be, really.

The only fucking thing this episode was missing to be the ultimate cockblock is an announcer saying "NEXT TIME ON PARASYTE!"
>> ARTICLE
Migi, despite being smart and knowledgeable, seems not to understand the concept of camouflaging very well. If Shinichi'd killed A along with his classmates, Migi's "cover" would be blown and they'd have to run and hide. Which would lead to all sorts of trouble for Migi itself.



>> ARTICLE
I also don't get why migi would think that A would blindly slaughter the students. They've met before and A knows that Shinichi can't change his face. Seems like he would be able to pick shinichi out of a crowd before attacking.
>> ARTICLE
The [idea](http://i.imgur.com/CawWNQh.jpg) is that Mr. A isn't the type to patiently search a screaming crowd for Shinichi's face, and would just chop up everything in Migi's general direction. After all, there are plenty of intelligent and rational ways he could have gone after Shinichi without charging into the school and cutting down the teachers who got in his way.
>> ARTICLE
Is Shinichi more proactive in the manga? From that single page it seems like he's less of a wimp compared to the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he's less of a wimp in the manga early on, but I think they're doing it to make character growth more obvious.
>> ARTICLE
I think the idea was that in the midst of the chaos no one would really notice if one of shinichis finger just quickly and stealthily pierced A's heart.
>> ARTICLE
I figure everyone would be running in fear of the dude whose head split open and scythed down a bunch of their classmates like they were nothing, instead of standing around to see if anyone would stop him.
>> ARTICLE
What you talking about.... I just saw a knife...
>> ARTICLE
the reason the people said that was because they arrived after the fact and the people they saw were cut up and bleeding everywhere. I would assume a knife was involved aswell.
>> ARTICLE
Not 100% on this but I think Migi's point was to sneak attack him in the midst of the crowd. Remember he has the ability to stretch and it's likely that people would be too panicked to notice Shinichi's hand.
>> ARTICLE
At that moment, Migi doesn't take that aspect into account. The most important thing is to stay alive, even if it means to reveal their identity.
>> ARTICLE
He'd kill any witnesses.

-and can conveniently blame "A" for the massacre.

Someone who is not hesitating to slash away at people definitely invokes such a responce and it's in school where there are kids 'n shit. I haven't seen someone pull a knife on someone in my life and most people haven't so it's an appropriate responce.

Well you wouldn't normaly assume that intruder has shapeshifting head.

Also, japanese word "hamono" literally means "thing with blade", so knives, daggers, hatchets, swords, razors - anything goes under that. I guess "The intruder is armed" or something like that would be more broad.

[Another love interest?!](http://imgur.com/oZIEmEq)

This time we get some interesting insight as to what happened last episode and what it means to be "human." There are three "types" of the Parasytes so far: the half-type (Shinichi), the rational type (Tamiya), and the irrational type (A). Their conversation is small, but it helps to highlight a central theme of the show.

My guess would be that next episode Murano finds out about Shinichi's secret, because she will more than likely head back into the school to see what he is up to. There's no way he can keep Migi a secret forever, and confiding in the person he loves is more than likely a safe bet (as long as she is understanding/doesn't overly freak out at the situation).

Three episode rule verdict: must watch. Interesting ideas at play combined with Madhouse's animation quality are shaping this one up to be pretty darn good.
>> ARTICLE
If i was in an anime i would be the oblivious type of character, i just now get what she meant -_-
>> ARTICLE
>the half-type (Shinichi), the rational type (Tamiya), and the irrational type (A).

If we look at it from Parasyte's viewpoint, A is the rational one and Tamiya is an odd one. 
>> ARTICLE
That's actually a good point.

One of the things they are trying, at least for right now, to drive home is the idea that, while Shinichi looks at the Parasytes as "monsters," the Parasytes just see us in the same way that we see cows, pigs, chickens, etc. That is, as lesser life forms.

So in a way, you are right. To put it in our terms, A is just a normal "omnivore" while Tamiya is a "vegan" because she selectively eats only certain things from among the entirety of the food available.
>> ARTICLE
Rather than lesser life forms the Parasytes treat all life forms other than themselves as expendable and not worth preserving. I think it has to do with their cannibalistic tendencies.

Imagine a world where the Parasytes "win" and only Parasytes are left on a planet. They'd have to start consuming each others' host bodies to survive until some of the species evolved a way to spore off their home planet and invade other planets. That necessity to kill each other means they evolved to prey on each other, which explains the evolutionary arms race of becoming so efficient at combat. Only the ones best able to fight their own species survive.

The nature of their reproductive biology is still a mystery though. I theorize that the spores (that can survive space) are released once the planet becomes underpopulated with native species to consume.
>> ARTICLE
I would argue that there aren't two distinct rational and irrational types, but rather a spectrum of intelligence, ability, and knowledge. 

Tamiya is extremely intelligent. She quickly learned enough math and human sociology to fit in as a high school teacher, and she started researching the nature of her species to give herself an advantage. She's also careful not to do anything that would attract attention to herself. A well-acclimated parasyte in a human host of high social standing is extremely powerful and dangerous. 

'A' on the other hand, doesn't think too far ahead. He's relatively sharp in identifying that Shinichi is a threat. However, his rash personality and slightly lesser intelligence led him to make a less optimal move. 

I imagine we'll run into a variety of parasytes with a range of smarts and quirks.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. Perhaps for the moment it would be wise to refrain from segmenting the Parasytes into only two groups.

Using my previous example, humans are not segmented that way, too. We have everything from geniuses to vegetables and everyone in-between. So it wouldn't be unheard of to have Parasytes follow the same type of logic.
>> ARTICLE
I like how you characterized Tamiya as a vegan though. I'm guessing that in later episodes she'll play a big role, and it'll help to set her apart from other parasytes due to her unique skills and adaptability.

She's got zero chance though. Murano is clearly best girl and Shinichi is well aware of it.

>My guess would be that next episode Murano finds out about Shinichi's secret, because she will more than likely head back into the school to see what he is up to

I agree that she'll go back into the school, but I think it's still too early for her to be finding out about Migi. This is a two-cour, so there's probably several more episodes of Murano suspecting something's up but not knowing what it is. Developing their relationship further will make the reveal more dramatic.

**EDIT:** Someone's PMing manga spoilers for Parasyte, so be careful when looking in your inbox if you've posted comments in this thread.

Bullshit. Migi is best girl.

The temptation to read the entire manga is absolutely killing me, but I really want to enjoy the story through the anime so I'm just gonna stick with it.

I did exactly the same thing after watching episode 2, I could not wait to see what happened next so I just marathoned the manga. By far the best manga I've read, shit was so complete, definitely worth it. Also I don't feel like the anime has been spoiled for me, in fact it's even better to see the characters moving from the manga, it makes me appreciate it that much more.
>> ARTICLE
Just thought I'd let you all know that /u/TL151 has been banned from /r/anime already, for exactly the same reasons (sending out spoiler PMs) - if you receive a message from him, I can only advise you to block him, and/or report him for harassment. (Although the Reddit Admins are not likely to care, unfortunately)

Anyways, there's nothing more we can do past banning him :/
>> ARTICLE
This is happening a lot lately especially in regard to Fate/stay night.

Any idea why people are doing this?

Is it like a new troll trend or something?

People did the same thing with Game of Thrones back before the Red Wedding happened. People are dicks.

I think it's just people being assholes for fun, unfortunately :( I haven't seen it outside of /r/anime, though - maybe it's because we try to be *very* very strict with the no spoiler rule and they're trying to ruin that? :/

Of course! Seeing the amount of commenters in here I would've expected a ton to have been sent.

I know it's tempting, but as a manga reader I say wait. There are certain things you don't want spoiled for you.

manga reader here. I'm curious what's the content of the PM?

Mind PM me?

ditto. from what I'm seeing, it will have a fun(?) ride for anime watchers.

I feel like there's a chance she's going to go after him and see them fighting. Then there relationship can progress past him having to constantly hide Migi from her and she can have a more active role in the story.

Still want to know more about them. Seems interesting two parasites and a human baby.

Human society is based on reciprocity. Each person helps the greater collective whenever possible, and in return other people do the same, thus increasing the average life span of the race in general.

Damn, great episode. It seems to me that the show is going on a route where there are parasites that have different types of personalities, and that not all of them are mindlessly killing humans. Is anybody else feeling that this has the same kind of vibe as the Chimera Ant arc from Hunter x Hunter?
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I'm loving this anime, can't wait for next week.
>> ARTICLE
That was an intense episode, I was on the edge of my seat through most of it. And some people are complaining about it, but the dubstep is great. It really gives the show a unique feel and adds to the tension.

I love the parasite and human similarities, differences, and the interactions between them. Good stuff.

I was reserving judgement after the first two episodes, but I'm now convinced. This is good.

The new teacher being one of them was somewhat predictable. Do most of the infected have deadish looking eyes?

> it won't be a surprise

For reader, or for the people in the story?

It's not a horror manga/anime, hence the author has no intention to hide their parasyte identities... that been said, there are still few exceptions.

First two episodes they use Dubstep now they are bringing in Trap Music into the BGM, this show is on another level.

Around the 9 minute mark I was like "is that Suicideyear?" Lol

Suicideyear- Gleetchie, that song is fucking gucci.

I'm a huge fan of slower tiempo (sometimes fast) bass with great use of snares in the beat. Songs like : Hucci- Ball so Hard and RL Grime- Trap on Acid, are things I remember when I was watching this episode.
>> ARTICLE
This episode got me thinking, why can Migi survive on nutrients but the other parasites need to practice cannibalism?? The only real difference between Migi and the rest is the organ parasitized; hand/arm vs brain/head. 

Furthermore, from the baby conversation, we know that "only" the parasitized organ is of parasite nature. This is supported by the fact the parasites can only weaponize the taken-over organs (I don't recall seeing any parasites that weaponized their arms/legs/etc).

So the difference is that Migi can survive on regular crap while there's something "special" required by parasitized brain that can only be found in the same species. It's also not a question of digestion; if the sex organs/arms/legs are of human origin, the digestive system should also be the same. Ultimately, the big questions are "what is this nutrient" and "if and how this nutrient contributes to the reproduction of the parasite".
>> ARTICLE
1. This will be covered later on.

2. This is suppose to be covered this episode but got cut out. [I'll spoiler it just in case](/s "correct, parasyte only consists of neck and above, rest remain human. In manga, Mr A throw a punch at the wall and broke his arm only where he learn that human parts are not good as weapon. ")

Kiseijuu is 24 episodes not 13. Or did you mean Bahamut is 13 episodes?

Yes, Bahamut. And for me, Fall 2014 are the months of October, November, December, Lagman is speculating about the *2nd opening* for the *2nd cour of Parasyte which will be Winter 2015*, which I attribute to that season, not the one *now*.
>> ARTICLE
I like it, but I don't like it being SnB: G's OP. It feels so out of place. I mean, you have this angsty, rock heavy song play, and then the episode starts and it's just the goofy (albeit pretty great) MC and whatshername walking around in a peaceful setting. I mean, unless Bahamut itself gets released by like episode 5, it'll still feel out of place because Bahamut is the only thing that makes sense being in the OP. Unless the anime takes a **really** dark turn **really** fast and becomes dark, serious and bloody it'll still be weird.
>> ARTICLE
Far from it, I find even [Psycho-Pass 2](http://youtu.be/_DLU5qLXv-E)'s to be less angsty.

Doesn't come close to Bahamut's and [GARO](http://youtu.be/t8KW2PD1_BA)'s still surpases it effortlessly(Seriously why is no one watching that? It's awesome!).

previous 2 episodes has been 2 chapters per episode while this one covers almost 3 chapters, the pacing is faster than my liking as they have trimmed away a lot of scenes. I guess there's a lot of give and take to fit all in 24 episodes consider this material is dialogue heavy.

I guess we'll not going to see [this scene (gore, nsfl)](http://i.imgur.com/VDscsqa.jpg) or similar on anime...

I think we will. Judging by the fact that they didn't skimp out on the gore for the last 2 episodes, I think we'll see plenty of hardcore stuff.

So hello and welcome to [Fallen_Glory's pointless live](http://media.giphy.com/media/Byzxt2ompZJyE/giphy.gif) edit/wrap up post that I make every week on the Trinity Seven and Parasyte discussions. I talk about stuff that happens and it's really disorganized and pointless. [So let's get this pointless talking started!](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me7selYAoH1r4qjd6.gif)

**Live Edit I PROBABLY MISSED A SPOILER TAG BE CAREFUL READING**

I know a few people didn't like the OP from last week but damn, that is one good OP in my opinion. Trinity seven is KILLING it with their OP/ED and this show is definitely matching up with an equally good [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RNBn-pPqiA)/[ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uIZpQPFdgw).

[Here is Trinity Seven's OP if anyone is wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_ibHw7WJrk) 

[I bet you it's that girl, I told y'all it's that girl.](http://i.imgur.com/Xsb5ac1.jpg) EDIT: Nevermind, it was further away.

OH SHIT THERE IS ANOTHER ONE IN HIS SCHOOL

[Why did Shinichi look..... why. This scared the hell out of me when it first popped up](http://i.imgur.com/b16SNYF.jpg)

This teacher one is interesting, she's the first one to actually be curious instead of just wanting to get ahead.

Looks like there is going to be a [bunch of "types" of them.](http://i.imgur.com/u6OXS3B.jpg)

Oh shit, what if [they can reproduce?](http://i.imgur.com/1y25phk.jpg) 

And this just got really weird, would it be [a parasyte baby?](http://i.imgur.com/AOue8DF.jpg) 

A-San doesn't seem to be to bright. He's quite an idiot.

Migi still seems to have no humanity, obviously but I do like how he gave Shinichi a weapon since they are two separate entities. 

Cliff hangers are the bane of my existence, I can't wait for next week. Madhouse is doing such a great job.

**WRAP UP**

Holy shit, this episode was insane. One quick critique I have is the CG students used at times, they look unnatural and it takes away a bit of quality but it isn't to big. Now, we just got information overload. We learned a lot about Parasytes from them having what seems to be a large amount of types to learning that some of them can be very mature and seem like normal humans. Shinichi still retains his humanity and Migi doesn't seem to get to incredibly upset that he has it, which I like. Migi giving Shinichi the weapon and telling him to fight effectively was interesting, I don't think Shinichi has a chance but it was interesting nonetheless. 

Great anime again, great audio again. The plot moved and it moved a decent amount, the story was pushed forward, I liked it. Last week we had some movement but it was small, this episode seems to be our catalyst and it's going to start getting more fast paced from here I think. Someone is going to find out about Migi soon, definitely going to be a friend maybe even the girl that's his love interest, it'll be interesting to see. I really want to know if there are more half bloods like Shinichi, I doubt it, but I hope there is at least one other one because I'd like to see if that other one loses his/her humanity or not.

Madhouse is doing a great job. An amazing job in my eyes. This is a contender for AOTS whether you are watching it or not. I'm impressed.

10/10

Thank you guys for reading this week. I wish I could make this post more like my Trinity Seven one where it has pictures and gifs throughout it making jokes but this show is far, far, far more serious so I can't really do that.

Seriously why don't their classrooms have doors? It's not completely logical in this scenario but it would have been best to have locked down the campus! If they were right, and there was a man with a knife on the campus it would have made total sense to lock all the doors and wait for security to handle it. In modern society the students could also call the police if things got too out of hand. This is an actual security plan in some campuses, so why not in Japan?
>> ARTICLE
Many US K-12 schools (well, my former high school, at least) generally do have policies of locking the doors and ducking down/by the wall - presumably to reduce the risk in case the person has a gun. As you said, better than clustering in the halls.

Japan probably doesn't have the same history of attacks to need such policies, though.

I can't believe no-one has picked up on this yet- the hidden Easter egg in Episode 3 hidden in the logarithms on the board. If you solve the 2 lines on the board at 6:26, you'll obtain the numbers 2 and 14. I think this is a reference to the year of release- 2014. Or maybe it meant 14/02 (DD/MM), referencing Valentines Day! What do you think?

>> ARTICLE
Honestly I disagree entirely. That article also honestly isn't even providing a real argument. It just focuses on a single random (and relatively meaningless/small) aspect of the show and applies some abstract standard to it and then tries to say something about the show in its entirety based on that. Not to mention what it is saying, that the show "has no soul," is inherently abstract in and of itself as well. It seems like it is trying to grasp for any reason to make the original seem better. Even then within that aspect the side-by-sides seem to be pretty significantly better in the anime version (but that could be just me). 
>> ARTICLE
There's nothing wrong having opinion, except I felt it is important to state so rather than out right express it as a fact.

I always keep the following in mind when I see something dislike in an adaptation:

- I'm a single person and a studio is there to please majority. So "hit and miss" does happen.
- this (anime) is a project, not an art. Budget (time, manpower and finance) distribution is so hard in real world, there is bound to have low moments. 
- most importantly, there's ulterior motive behind this project: to promote its franchise. If you think this anime as a promotion campaign instead of a product, then it make sense (and very sad) that they can tease or side tracks so the anime itself does not replace its original manga/LN/VN.

Even though opening and previews had massive hints I was living in denial that something so huge could happen so soon. My first reaction for a few seconds was similar to Schinichi. Why they had to take out best mom ever ;__;

I'm sure Schinichi was like: damn this day sucks, I got beaten up twice, some pesky stalker started following my tracks, didn't get laid and got to eat shit food for dinner and on top of that I had to hear my grumbling parasyte, surely this day cannot be more fucked up.

I'm probably not the only manga-reader who noticed this, but the intro does actually contain the huge spoiler that Shinichi's mother gets replaced by a parasyte. I kept good and quiet though.
>> ARTICLE
Arh you see.. Anime only viewer does not know that parasytes can open up their head/mouth/weapon that way until episode 3.

People interpret that as "she is been cut". If you compare her eyes in OP and this episode, in OP her eyes are not starring dead 
>> ARTICLE
Or maybe most people actually tend not to watch OPs for the exact reason - spoilers. I know I do it for anime like Parasyte. Usually I just listen to the song.
>> ARTICLE
This is precisely what I do. It's unfortunate because some OPs are really good otherwise.

Even intros that have 'red herrings' annoy me... you sort of expect some cool scene you see in the OP and then it (or something similar to it) never arrives.

This anime is my personal 'anime of the year', for two major reasons:

1) Unlike most animes we've been having this year involving magic, fantasy and thrillers I have yet to see any actually logical storyline like this one that doesn't have any Ecchi, Harem, stupid/shallow characters and there's literally nothing I don't like about it.

On the other hand I can point out so many themes this anime delivers in a truly unique and splendid manner: the soundtrack (Dubstep anyone? don't take it for granted!), the almost-love relationship with Murano that is being developed slowly, the mystery behind the parasites and the way they differ from humans, Shinichi's development as a character, the setting of the story etc.

2) Madhouse delivers top-notch quality at everything they choose to go with: Hunter x Hunter's anime adaptation (that just recently ended T_T) left a hole in my heart and the only option I had is to trust them and give this anime a deserving chance and boy did they deliver!

 Not to mention they also made many other popular anime hits: Death Note, Hajime no Ippo, Monster, One Outs, Chihayafuru etc. etc.

Based Madhouse delivers once again with the kind of shows only they know how to put up.


>> ARTICLE
>animes
>> ARTICLE
what are your top fives this year?
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I would consider the following, not based on order:

- (5 stars) Ping Pong The Animation

- (5 stars) Hunter X Hunter (T_T brings me to tears just to think about how sad it is to not have any more episodes for at least 10 years; which is the least time required to write a saga-worth manga content)

- (4 stars) Hajime no Ippo: A good all-rounder shounen with likable characters, often has a motivational theme together with deep characters/settings that make it totally worth it. only ranked 4 since its not as perfect as the other 5-stars.

- (5 star) Parasyte obviously as I mentioned.

**Candidates to be included:**

(between 4 and 5) Shingeki no Bahamut: MC is a badass, plot seems interesting so far and the animation is great.

(between 3 and 4) Nanatsu no Taizai: plot is interesting, though characters lacking and MC is emotionless and quite overpowered; but still has potential (its only episode 5 yet)

**Honorable mentions:**

-(3 star) No Game No Life: too much fan service.

-(2 star) Akame ga Kill: plot is really dumb, characters shallow and a lot of fan service as well. (had high potential though)

It's been overall a disappointing year innovation-wise, but this season has provided some good surprises unlike its predecessors.

Well, that episode started off with a bang.  
  
I would have liked Shinichi to actually be able to fight back in one of those two fights, but not backing down is rather cool too, in a way. Standing up for Murano, gained him some major points.  
  
This new girl is interesting as well, she can see/sense Migi.  
  
Oh god, I didn't expect the woman that parasite would take over was his mother, that was horrible AND IT FUCKING STABBED him.

>Oh god, I didn't expect the woman that parasite would take over was his mother

Me either, though in hindsight, I probably should have. I thought it was headed back to the city and was going to end up taking over Kana or Murano until I saw that sunset. Realization hit, "Oh, no"s were had. Then shit hit the fan.

It's actually not bad. The art style and animation is a bit dated but the story is a cute SoL-like romance/comedy. And it has a conclusive ending, so no "go read the manga" blueballs.

Hmm, I might have to watch that then. Thanks for the heads up!
>> ARTICLE
That is such an awesome art. I'm gonna have to pick up that manga/anime up one day!
>> ARTICLE
I'm really looking forward to Shinichi's future badassery as [shown.](http://i.imgur.com/iRyKxju.jpg)

Anyways, expecting the mom to be [](/s "dead") by the end of the episode.
 
***Episode thoughts :***

* I am now shipping Satomi x Shinichi.

* [Nice try, Shinichi. Maybe next time.](http://imgur.com/a/sK3xK)

* Alright, expectations are true. Saw that coming a mile away.

* Shit. My hair stood up the whole time in the last few minutes.

* Done with the episode. ED made me cry. I need my Inou Battle later. ;_;

***Opinions :***

Best episode of this season so far for me. I was left speechless by the end and cried during the ED. I didn't expect this to make me cry at all. The ED was perfect this episode. I was wondering why the ED was off from the atmosphere in the anime but now, I understand. 

Parasyte now climbed up to my favorites this season with only Shigatsu above it.
>> ARTICLE
I loved this episode too but never so much have I wanted to see someone grow a pair in an episode.  Can you please stop getting your ass kicked Shinichi!?
>> ARTICLE
He's only a ten, dude.
>> ARTICLE
he kinda looks like kyouma from steins gate in that pic
>> ARTICLE
I've always thought he looked like a weird combination of HOUOUIN KOUMA and David tennant in that frame. No idea why. 
>> ARTICLE
[I always thought Murano was cheeky in the manga](http://i.imgur.com/6JntAdz.jpg?1)
>> ARTICLE
What chapter of the manga is that?
>> ARTICLE
Ch 10, page 35.  This episode went up to Ch 12 page 17.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, thank you. 

Definitely going to start reading the manga after that cliffhanger. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, the manga looks really different.
>> ARTICLE
It's a late 80's/early 90's manga, so the designs will probably seem strange nowadays.
>> ARTICLE
That coy, smiling, motherfucker.

Actually, it's not even coy.  That was pretty blunt.
>> ARTICLE
[Sometimes the stupid thing is the *right* thing to do.](http://imgur.com/aIzZrbP)

[Don't cry, Murano! He's your knight in shining armor!](http://imgur.com/JSfnbEz)

[No sex, but a little snuggling never hurt anyone. :P](http://imgur.com/nq0m0U2)

So there are people capable of detecting the "wavelengths" that the parasytes give off, and that Kana girl and even Murano have the ability (some more than others).

Death flags were going off all over the place last episode, and it looks like the Mom bit the dust. The preview seemed to show the Dad still alive, however, so we'll see if he comes back to save the day!
>> ARTICLE
>that Kana girl and even Murano have the ability 

Murano doesn't. Migi calls her perceptive, and contrasted her with Kana, but said that Kana's ability was on a different level, so that she could detect Parasytes.
>> ARTICLE
What this guy said. Murano is just able to tell he's acting very differently. He went from a pretty shy guy to being pretty aggressive
>> ARTICLE
Well I mean it's pretty easy to tell that your super SILENT FRIEND becomes aggressive when he says... " DO YOU WANT ME TO EAT YOU?!" 

I mean if I heard anyone say that I'd say they're pretty aggressive (TO ANYTHING, unless it's a sweet sweet sexy donut) 
>> ARTICLE
their ability is that they're female.
>> ARTICLE
The twist!
>> ARTICLE
I actually think they have been trying to heavily imply that females have the inherent ability to "pick up on"  the parasite wavelengths to different degrees. Females have been the only ones to even slightly catch on so far. 
>> ARTICLE
...

The cliffhangers in this series are so well placed. A week is too long!

In other news, we got a Sawashiro Miyuki character, so I'm reasonably happy with the episode.
>> ARTICLE
[That scene where she looked into his eyes and saw the inner Parasyte was neat. ](http://i.imgur.com/TheI9d1.png)

IT'S OVER...... 10.

>> ARTICLE
This makes me want to read the manga so badly.... SHOULD I READ IT OR NO?
>> ARTICLE
Yea, after that episode I really want to read the manga. Gonna try not to, but I'm pretty sure I'll cave.
>> ARTICLE
I feel the exact same way! I think I'm going to just bend and read it from the beginning, I can't wait another week!
>> ARTICLE
I would say yes, I am currently reading it myself and while the anime does a fairly nice job, the manga in my opinion just handles atmosphere and pacing better.
>> ARTICLE
As I usually would say. 

- Anime did an awesome job capturing the vibe with animation, vocal and soundtrack. Mad House also doing great at staying faithful to the original content.
- The story is 24'ish episodes long, it's a decent, enjoyable length. half a year goes pass really fast. You also have something to look forward to.
- Back to the vibe... **you get the different emotion comparing reading manga and watching anime** You want to watch the anime first, THEN come back to manga (as it goes into some details that anime bypasses).
- If you know the manga content before watching new episodes, all you can think of is whether they going to portrait the scene same as how you imagined, or spending way too much attention comparing scene/storytelling with manga.

.

**TLDR; Stick with anime. Read manga when anime finishes ~18 weeks later.**
>> ARTICLE
in my opinion the anime feels like a Psychological action thriller, while the manga was more of a Psychological Horror Thriller with the grotesque artwork. 
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind that the manga is from 1995 so the art is very dated, worse than AOT. It also takes ages to get going as there's 64 chapters in total and anime wise we currently passed 11. of course this is just my personal opinion. also the characters are also a tad different in the anime than the manga i could go into more detail but that would make this post spoiler-ish. I'd reccomend watching the anime for now as it's a much better experience since the general pacing and the art is alot better. 
>> ARTICLE
After that ending, I don't think I can wait a week to see what happens, but at the same time I don't want to see what happens; even though it's pretty obvious how this situation will develop. 

So it's a loss either way, fuck.

I did previous to watching the anime. The manga is a lot more brutal.

I wouldn't say the art is "worse", just different. What was considered normal manga drawing was considerably different back then (more "realistic", somewhat Tezuka-inspired) compared to now (big expressive eyes, clean lines, shading, crazy hair)

The art in the parasyte manga reminds me a lot of western comics.

Can you honestly blame the guy for going hysterical over seeing his mom like that?
>> ARTICLE
I really liked that. I mean, I didn't like his suffering, lol, but I really thought his reaction was well-done.  
>> ARTICLE
Same here, it's realistic. It annoys me when people complain about characters not being sudden badasses in those kind of situations because, while it'd be satisfying, it's just completely unrealistic. Same reason I don't understand why everyone complains about Shinji from NGE; not every character should be a badass for no apparent reason.
>> ARTICLE
This is true. His reaction to his not-so-mother was realistic.

Having said that, remember in the first episode when he stops the car from hitting the girl? (Which doesn't even make sense in itself because the force of the car would still throw back the rest of his body even if his right hand is reinforced, Newton's Third Law and all that.)

Why wasn't he able to channel the same strength in the fight against that gang of wannabe thugs? That's what annoyed me. He can surely ask Migi to stay in vaguely the same shape as a hand but just reinforce himself. It wasn't annoying because he got beaten up, but because any person in that situation would have hardened themselves with the resolve to beat the shit out of them if someone they cared that much about was in trouble. Him letting himself get beaten up really pissed me off.
>> ARTICLE
we all knew it but fuCKKKKKKKKK

damn the end was so intense............ WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
>> ARTICLE
Fuuuuuuuck! Finished manga almost 7 years ago and Shinichi's [spoiler](/s ""mother's" blank stare") was stuck in my head ever since. This episode just brought back those unpleasant memories...
>> ARTICLE
Without spoiling do you mind telling me if the manga had a conclusive end? Just curious.
>> ARTICLE
It was not very conclusive, more like a bittersweet ending that gives food for thought.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh i think the ending to the manga was perfect, i diden't drag along for ages or introduced uneccesary characters it all summed up nicely, honestly if it had kept going i might have dropped it because no matter how much i loved the plot the fucking art killed me. thank god the anime did not stay true to the manga art wise.
>> ARTICLE
personally i dislike happy endings in serious story's, so when the end came and it let me choose what ending i wanted is was marvelous, it transformed parasyte in a real masterpiece. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, manga is 24 years old. That's 4 years older than me. You can't blame it's art quality, it had that deep 90's vibe.

Author is currently doing Historie. Terrific manga in almost every aspect except art. Recently, in most panels, if it isn't the subject, it gets half drawn at best. Guy needs some assistants.
>> ARTICLE
FYI Much like Togashi with HunterxHunter that art gets completed for the Tankouban releases.
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: author initially had multiple endings prepared (and he narrated them in an post-series essay). Although slim, it may be possible for Mad House to pick alternate ending.
>> ARTICLE
I don't suppose you have a link to that post-series essay do you?

No. 

May dig around to see if I can find anything online...

Without spoiling: yes.

Shinichi is having one hell of a bad week

Damn ok so is it alright 5 episodes in to say I really like this? I mean all the things I've seen so far tells me that this is going to be absolutely great: the tension is high, the characters are all likable and have plenty of room to grow, and hopefully it appears they are setting this up to be rather deep psychologically and philosophically. I'm not holding my breath exactly for that last part, as very few manga truly go anywhere into that realm (of course with notable exceptions) I just think its definitely set up if it wanted to go that way, which if it did would probably make it a top contender for anime of the year. If it doesn't however I'm rather content with a pretty good thriller too
>> ARTICLE
He was pretty cool even though he was just getting beaten up the whole time :P
Migi's comment about his classmates being better animals than him, made me giggle xD

And there goes his mom... I was just waiting for it. And they end it with a damn cliffhanger after all that!
>> ARTICLE
Interesting as always. Maybe they really can tell a difference. Have a feeling Kana is gonna be super relevant later on. 

Well shoot. Things aren't going well for him at all. 
>> ARTICLE
I love how they handle the fiction in this show; honestly the only reason Shinichi went so far was because he is trying to prove to himself that he is still human. This show has been really good at portraying  the characters as real; it feels like this is how people would react to these crazy situations. I always enjoy some reality in my fiction.
>> ARTICLE
What... the... fuck.
>> ARTICLE
Having a bad week? Let's take a look at Shinichi's day then:  
  
  
- Gets beat up, twice.  
- Takes a girl home, gets denied shortly after.  
- Mom dies, parasite takes overr and sticks a blade through his chest(pretty sure that was right near his heart).  
  
Still think you're having a bad week?
>> ARTICLE
And that was just a single day. If we take entire week into consideration he was also assaulted multiple times by deadly man eating monsters and learned that he is taking lessons from one too. 

Then his school got wrecked in a broad daylight and was forced to make a choice between sacrificing his classmates for a bloody human meatshield or fighting for his life against insta kill monsters with a pipe.

And it's only episode 5. He's in for a bumpy ride.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call it denied as much as taking things slow, she obviously like him and has told him as much to an extent so it's not exactly something to take in a bad light.

Though granted, personally, if I was already having a bad day, for the next couple of days I'd be looking at it as the worst thing ever.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Migi was just going to go in for the kill right as the person turned the corner at the end. It may have been less painful to do it that way for Shinichi. 

Not that they knew who was going to come around that corner. 

Also that girl they introduced today, Kana, gives me a bad vibe. I'm so suspicious of everyone now, they could all be parasytes!
>> ARTICLE
If you haven't notice, paeasytes have personality, Mr A is full on killer mode while teacher and Migi are more curious. It make sense that Migi wants to check out this parasyte first before taking it out.



>> ARTICLE
Wow didnt think Shinichi wouldnt recieve both physical and emotional suffering.  

His parents were portrayed very realistically constantly worrying about him, and Shinichi's reaction and Migi's attempting to logically calm him down was a really powerful scene.  

Also new girl Kana seems to be an interesting character and potential love interest?  
Idk but she is voiced by *Sawashiro Miyuki* and possesses some kind of parasyte sensing ability
>> ARTICLE
> Wow didnt think Shinichi wouldnt recieve both physical and emotional suffering.

Oh my God.

It seems like Shinichi is trying to be more "human" by fighting a losing battle so he doesn't become like the parasite. The end scene was also pretty traumatic and seeing Shinichi like that is just emotional. So far the show has been my favourite this season and hopefully it keeps it's momentum
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know where I can find the music that pops up around 6:56? Whenever she is looking into his eyes, Kana that is. I can't get it out of my head, it just sound so cool.

Edit: Fixed the time.

Damn, that was a brilliant episode. Loving the pacing, I just hope the episodes maintain this quality. Btw does anyone know how long this series is going to be?

WOW I'M SURE *NO ONE* SAW THAT COMING.

But seriously, great episode, it was a little slow at the start and I noticed some animation jitters, but Jesus fuck, that ending was intense. Too bad we didn't quite get to wub wub point. Parasyte is one of those anime that makes the week feel agonizingly long.

Also, anyone else comparing this to World Trigger? I honestly think their premises and setting bare quite a few similarities, but the difference in quality is astounding. Parasyte is just so much better in every single aspect...

Damn Mama Shinichi is now a parasyte. You guys called the death flag miles away. Shinichi will get in his cocoon next episide or episode 7 and will soon join the competition for best MC. I'm not surprised he snapped so quickly. If that was my mom I'd ignore the truth as well...

I can't wait for next week. Can you tell me (with spoiler tags) how he survives that wound?

Well, that was fast. Didn't his mom to die so soon.  

I hope this is what pushes him over the edge and allows him to transform into a mega death machine from outer space

I can't believe that I never saw his mother like that in the opening, I only noticed it when my friend was catching up on today's episode. It told us what was going to happen but no one I know caught it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still so hype for the fact that Shinichi at the end of the OP looks like manga Shinichi.
>> ARTICLE
My jaw hit the fucking floor.
>> ARTICLE
Loves those Shinchi and Murano moments, Murano was one of my favorites in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just glad there's no farting noise when the parasyte strikes shinichi's heart
>> ARTICLE
I can't say I didn't expect the mom to die with those death flags, but I'm surprised Migi didn't strike it down the second it walked in. Maybe he has a grasp on Shinichi's personality and thought it would be beneficial to get Shinichi on his side before he strikes?

EDIT : I have so many more things to say on this. Why the hell doesn't Migi just make him punch harder, I mean he fucking stopped a car before. I get so anxious any time Shinichi gets in a minor fight. This show leaves so much setup.

My predictions for the future are that Shinichi is going to end up having to kill a human because of what they've seen, Migi's going to kill Murano because she sees him, and all of Migi's mishaps are going to drive Shinichi into madness. A decent ending would be Migi beginning to feel emotion, but this show could be a 10/10 if it somehow ended up that Shinichi ends up trusting and liking Migi through all of their battles and triumphs, only for Migi to kill him and relocate to a new host, completely betraying Shinichi's trust
>> ARTICLE
Schinichi's mom sure knows that the shorest way to man's heart is through the rib cage. 

I can't wait till he and Migi will pull themselves together and go full-Mercer on those parasyte things.

>> ARTICLE
I know Migi only truly cares about the MC's wellbeing because if he dies so does Migi, but I kinda felt like when he was telling the MC to put down the knife he wasn't only looking out for survival purposes, but it kinda felt like his words went a little deeper... I'm probably looking to deep for only episode five though.
>> ARTICLE
And Sawashiro Miyuki joins the cast....
>> ARTICLE
OK, I think I can now see how the theme will unravel. Migi and other parasites often mention how different their species is from ours, often to the point of being polar opposites. However, some of us see that Migi *might* be displaying unnecessary concern or even sympathy for Shinichi. And of course, many characters have mentioned how Shinichi *has changed.*

In a classic case of Don Quixote and Sancho Panzathe "quixotization" of Sancho Panza and "sanchification" of Don Quixotewe will see how our OTP really start influencing each other. It's still too early to tell, but I at least expect Migi to have few to no chances of saying [this,](http://i.imgur.com/xEnxneb.jpg) but I don't know if there will be a time when Shinichi is more like Migi than Migi ~~her~~itself.

The end of the episode is the catalyst, is the emotionally intense experience that Shinichi needed to be more open to Migi's influence. I'm not sure how he survives that, although [next episode predictions: ](/s "I expect Migi's ability to leave the main body for three minutes to be of use next week. Maybe she will kill the mom and/or call an ambulance and administer first aid.")
>> ARTICLE
That is a pretty cool prediction. Kind of want to see it.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck me sideways and call me Migi because that was one of the most shocking moments I have experienced in anime thus far! Hopefully the great pacing and action can continue and the plot can get even darker...
>> ARTICLE
Really enjoying the show...but really annoyed that Migi doesn't shut up about the how "illogical" altruism is. Not only is it something found throughout the animal kingdom, its an evolutionary trait. Exactly why was even showcased in this episode ("You stood up for our friend? Cool, you ever get in trouble with them again and we'll kick their asses"). Migi doesn't act like an animal, if anything it acts like an insect.
>> ARTICLE
I thought in episode 1,  author has already established (through Shinichi's monologue) that migi's thought process is insect-like.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's true. I'm just referring to how they repeatedly say "humans are the only animals to act this way. Its so illogical" which is complete BS on every level.
>> ARTICLE
I have few possible explanations for that inaccuracy:

1. This manga is like 10 years old so maybe at the time of writing it,  research in this field was not as advanced as today or maybe author didn't have good access to it.

2. Altruism in nature is more like "I give you something, you give me something" or "let's help each other".

IIRC completely sacrificing your life for another members of the same species is more rare and happens usually in case of colonial organisms that throw their life away for others because they all share genes so benefitting other is beneficial from evolutionarily point of view (individual dies but their genes survive in the rest of colony). Ironically this applies to insects, but then again it's not emotion based like humans but cold, logical and calculated. 

So human altruism is kinda different from that of animals, maybe migi is right :P

Probably my favorite episode so far.  Only complaint is that I have to wait a god damn week until the next one. ):
>> ARTICLE
I was definitely pleasantly surprised to find out Kana is voiced by none other than Miyuki Sawashiro. 
>> ARTICLE
Why exactly didn't Migi kill Shinichis mother?
>> ARTICLE
Migi needed for Shinichi to pull together and tried to reason with him that his mother is dead.

Remember, Migi is on defense and Shinichi is on offense. That is the team dynamic that has saved them so far.

Might also be showing how Migi is gaining more empathy.
>> ARTICLE
I think it  had more to do with Shinichi holding a knife in front of Migi, in his unstable state he was an even more immediate threat and one who couldn't just be killed
>> ARTICLE
Exactly, Migi even said that the knife was in his way. Migi also said that he could kill the intruder himself in one hit and that Shinichi wasn't needed.
>> ARTICLE
Wanted to see those punks getting theirs ass woop
>> ARTICLE
Great episode :D Enjoyed the interaction between Shinchi and Murano.
>> ARTICLE
........holy fuck do I feel bad for the MC, and now we got a 7 day cliffhanger wait on our hands.....if any show to tie with my bias AOTS nod for F/SN it's this show, it's been so god-damn *awesome* so far!
>> ARTICLE
Someone predicted the mother being taken over last week based on a screenshot from the OP... I was really hoping it wouldn't be true (at least, not so soon). That scene with "her" and Shinichi was heartbreaking. :(

And then the episode ends with him getting stabbed in the chest... I wonder how he will survive.
>> ARTICLE
yo what is going ON right now holy fuck
>> ARTICLE
Wow, the OP actually spoiled the climax, COME ONE!

I'm really liking Shinichi's attempts to prove Migi wrong by doing all of that out-of-character altruistic stuff, really interesting to watch.

I just wish that the OP didn't show Okasan in Kiseijuu form, it kinda took the impact away.
>> ARTICLE
And that's why I skip OPs until the season is over. Although someone did say it as a theory on one of these discussions and I went along with it. For me, as soon as the parasyte said it needed a female body, Okasan's deathflag was raised like there's no tomorrow. It was still shocking.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck this, I'm gonna go read the manga. A week is too long.
>> ARTICLE
Hell yeah, Shinichi's going to become badass. I can't wait.
>> ARTICLE
Yes Shinichi, HATE the xeno!
>> ARTICLE
this past couple of days my emotional state while watching entertainment are exhausted as shit... just finished Bojack Horseman on Netflix, this show, Liverpool yesterday, Interstellar screening... fuck me. I need a good pick me up  after this. Well time to rewatch some Gintama episodes 
>> ARTICLE
I read the anime but I still didn't expect to feel so tense watching the ending. Madhouse is doing a great job.
>> ARTICLE
I don't read the anime either.
>> ARTICLE
Okay,

how come no power punches this episode.  And then parents die, more death flags.  And his mother comes home.  Ah, so frustrating how he handled that at the end, he's was in a serious emotional wreck at the end..  Since its episode 5, I would suppose the wound isn't fatal.  Or maybe he has some healing powers.
>> ARTICLE
The next episode preview gave hints on Shinichi's fate.
>> ARTICLE
Preview is way too spoilery, I'd suggest avoiding it, next week will be much more awesome that way.
>> ARTICLE
Well that was great.  I really like the new girl, Kana, that was introduced in this episode.  Poor Shinichi though..  
>> ARTICLE
I love Migi's remarks so much though.
>> ARTICLE
Having read the manga, I feel like the scene where Shinichi really started to lose it after seeing his mother didn't have the same impact. It was probably mostly the music choice. The electronic/dubstep/whatever that is coming into anime is almost never executed correctly, and I can say for a fact that was not the time. Overall I'm still pumped for the series, though.
>> ARTICLE
Mother dies, Main Char probably is going to die like Eren 5. episode...dis gun be good.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT

HOLY SHIT

HOLY SHIT

... That's all I have to say to that.
>> ARTICLE
Man this show is gonna be so fucking awesome.. I'm so fucking hyped right now.
>> ARTICLE
Well shit. that ending. Guess the show is over then.
>> ARTICLE
This was the exact thing I was hoping absolutely would not happen. I was hoping his parents would be fine.

I can't help but feel that in that situation I would react exactly as Shinichi did. There's no way I could ever attack my mother. Jeez man that's rough.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, some nice music started playing when Migi said that someone is coming at the end of the episode, anyone know if the OST is out, or anything about this particular track?
>> ARTICLE

Oh my god... Things are happening, and they're amazing.

>> ARTICLE
The feels. So many feels. 
>> ARTICLE
As someone who so far isn't very impressed with the anime adaptation I have to say that this episode was very good, easily the best yet and brought back some heavy feels from when I was reading tha mange. In fact I forgot the whole stuff that is going to happen next week but now I remember. It's going to be great.
>> ARTICLE
I feel you Mighi. I too was hoping to see some human intercourse.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one that was a tad bothered that Shinichi practically just stood there and ate punches? 
>> ARTICLE
I know i'm a bit late but does anyone know the song that was used when Kana and izumi meet eye to eye. it was right after he got beat up (6:55)
the OST came out, and i didn't hear the song in it. that song was the song I was waiting for.
>> ARTICLE
My heart is beating so fucking fast and hard right now...
>> ARTICLE
They display humans as such irrational and self-harming beings that I feel more respect for calm and logical parasites. If they weren't so instinctive at eating, there would be no reason for humans to fight them at all. I imagine a possibility when he accepted his mother's new head. After the real one has died, nobody can do anything about it. Everybody has his own faults, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
My mouth is still open whilst writing this after watching the whole episode.

WHAT. THE. FUCK!!!
>> ARTICLE
And on top of all that we have to wait another week, the wait is becoming [painful](http://www.bf4-emblems.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/BibleThump.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
MAH NIGGA SHINICI GOT DDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEENIED
>> ARTICLE
I'm starting to look forward to the point they add inappropriate dubstep into each episode now.
>> ARTICLE
Awww SHIT! [](/s "DEATH FLAG CONFIRMED")
>> ARTICLE
I know we're supposed to feel bad for him, but this entire episode was just full of frustration for me. God damn it, Shinichi, her being a parasite is the first thing you should suspect.
>> ARTICLE
He's only 17, and put into his shoes you may not be able to stay calm/rational in that situation.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't make it any less frustrating to watch. It's also just a *tad* off kilter. If this is something he's been dreading will happen, it should be more grief and terror rather than shock and disbelief. 
>> ARTICLE
True, but it's still infuriating to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Aka/ drama :)
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi's behavior at the end really pissed me off. Yeah, he's going through a pretty traumatic experience but there was no reason for him to act THAT poorly in the situation. 
>> ARTICLE
>  Yeah, he's going through a pretty traumatic experience but there was no reason for him to act THAT poorly in the situation. 

His mom was just killed and was taken over by a parasite... what do you expect exactly? 


>> ARTICLE
If he had been cool and collected it wouldn't have been any diferent from a shonen MC; this show seems to like real reactions in its characters and its working great imo.
>> ARTICLE
You have two choices: Believe the person who looks a lot like your mother is a monster that took over her body (meaning she's dead), or believe that the person in front of you is your mother who you have felt guilty towards your whole life and wanted to make up for everything you did. 

Oh and your hand is the same as the thing that killed your mother. I don't know your age but being a teenager and finding your mother is dead sounds very stressful. Having  her for 17~ years compared to people who lose their parents at 30/40/50 years of age sounds more difficult as well. 

Not everyone has years of training to avoid poor behavior under shock. Please understand that people are going to do stupid things when dealing with their loved ones. 

I don't mean to come across as upset or uptight, like, don't add a harsh tone to my toneless words please. 
>> ARTICLE
People go into full shock and snap from less hardcore events. And this one was pretty hardcore. 

[I mean even migi was kinda shocked](http://i.imgur.com/kjvqivy.png)
>> ARTICLE
Oh come one, you would have been in the same exact state as he is in.

He is in shock by his mother being a parasyte and at the same time in denial, it is completely natural to be that way.

What, did you want him to say "oh well, she's a monster now. Time to kill her!"??
That's just stupid. He's 16 or 17 years old ffs.

and now I remember people hating on Shinji from EVA for being "such a pussy" without actually thinking about how he is and what he has to go through.
 Thanks for that...
>> ARTICLE
exactly, i'd be just as fucked in the head if I knew my mother was no more like his.
>> ARTICLE
He is in denial and shock. He didn't WANT to believe that his mom is a parasyte.
>> ARTICLE
I expected him to be a lot more hardened to it. I mean, unlike most other victim's loved ones, he's FULLY aware of the signs of a person that has been taken over, so his complete denial was a bit jarring. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like we need to be completely conscious of the situation though. All of the "people" that Shinichi has seen that were Parasytes boil down to a Dog, 2 men and a woman. People he had absolutely no connection with,[spoilers ](/s "so seeing his mother, his own flesh and blood just blank stare and very blunt with her speech with no emotion,") he didn't want to believe it. ESPECIALLY after his father called him frantically. If I ever had to do that I don't know if I could've. Shinichi being more hardened to it would mean he'd have to have actually gone through something with it. This right here is his moment to become hardened and maybe even cold by it. 
>> ARTICLE
*Maybe even cold by it....*


"It's cold Shinichi."
>> ARTICLE
can u blame the guy? Who wouldn't act like that
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi's stupidity makes my blood boil more than that guy from world trigger.

Him getting beat up for Satomi was fine, but getting beat up for that classmate without fighting back and him stopping Migi with a knife was WTF! At least the guy from World Trigger saved people's lives with his stupid "because it is right" bullshit, but this shit is preposterous.
>> ARTICLE
Because obviously, you would just be able to believe your mom is dead and kill her with hesitation amrite. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why but I got the urge to start watching this show and started in the middle of this episode. I don't know what is going on but damn this is some dark stuff. Gonna go back and start from the beginning now.
>> ARTICLE
That's an odd way to dive into a new show...
>> ARTICLE
I saw the episode was updated on a streaming site. Decided to check it out. In my mind it was like flipping through channels and stopping at a show that looked interesting lol
>> ARTICLE
It's an intense, mature show, source manga dated way back in late 80s and is my all time favourite.

You may have already find out, it falls under horror action thriller, its story is in depth: on the surface you have your alien invasion plot device, then there's character developments from different perspective of this event (event parasytes themselves) and then there's moral of the story behind it on what the author trying to portrait.

Highly recommend.


>> ARTICLE
I'was disappointed 'cause this seires didn't end with his death.

fuck u shinichi how dare u try to harm the best girl.

I VE FUCKING SEEN THIS ANIME ON REDDIT, I SHOULD TRY IT. I SEE COMMENTS LIKE "iT SHOULD BE A LONG WEEK". NAH WHATS WRONG?? 

STARTING IT, ALREADY IN 5TH EPISODE... 
SHIT GOT REAL!!
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK I CANT WAIT MORE

FUCK YOU REDDIT :(
>> ARTICLE
Was okay episode by my standards. I figured lots of characters would be dying pretty soon and with Shinichi's ignorant way of thinking got on my nerves more than the bullies. Of course I know full well that I would probably be acting the same in a situatuion like that. Just got worn out on the "pussy main character going through a lot of stress then suddenly turning badass" plot.
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't turn badass just because of "stress" just wait and see. And if your fucking mom dying isn't reason enough for you to change your life I don't know what is.
>> ARTICLE
Haruki (onii-chan): " So these guys go around killing and eating people. See this drawing here? These are blades. Sharp, lethal blades."

Yuko (to herself): "I know, what I will do: I will confront him directly all by myself."

That girl would be fine in a zombie apocalypse.
>> ARTICLE
damn Lizzie
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi's gonna have to make her look at the flowers.
>> ARTICLE
I did a legitimate double-take and had to pause the episode for a minute at that point. 

That was the single most idiotic decision/chain of thought I have ever seen in an otherwise good series. 

That shit came out of *nowhere*. 
>> ARTICLE
> Yuko (to herself): "I know, what I will do: I will confront him directly all by myself."

To be fair to her, I don't know what's in that bottle but she intends to use it as a weapon. She's just *seriously* underestimated her opponent. 
>> ARTICLE
I know that Yuko's thought process and actionbs were just for the sake of escalating the plot, but did it really have to played out in such a retarded manner.
>> ARTICLE
So 'Plotdevice' schoolmate isnt the greated thinker. Hope she at least will be tasty because she deserves to die with her logic.
>> ARTICLE
It's even worse at the "what if I get it wrong", but she saw him change his face and hair... 
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts exactly. Who in their right mind would confront a suspected alien killer, *especially* when she's seen the evidence first hand?! I like Yuko, but she definitely isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.

>> ARTICLE
She'll be looking at the flowers in a zombie apocalypse.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah ... i mean come on. I hope she learns her lection when she dies.
>> ARTICLE
I have never commented in this subreddit. I've never even really read it to be honest except but a minute or 2 a couple of times. I came here just to post about this and say what an idiot that girl is. This anime is absolutely awesome, but seriously, why do so many people in horror-typed things have to be such damned morons?

They could do better than this with the writing, given how well they have written the rest of it.
>> ARTICLE
It was a terrible decision. However, in defense of the writers, it's not 'anime logic' bad. She's a high school girl with a crush on him. Human history is nothing if not full of staggeringly bad choices made by teenagers too inexperienced and screwed up by hormones and emotions to know better.

To be honest, I had such low expectations from her that I expected her to go weaponless and get eaten whole by Shimada. The fact that she at least took out a bottle raises her from 0/10 to 1/10 in the scale of intelligence.

I'm pretty sure there's a TV trope for this kind of stupidity and naivety, but I can't find it (no surpise there).

Yeah seriously, it's disgusting how stupid she is.

Well she had a plan with the thinner (or whatever it was) bottle and she couldn't have really know what they are completely capable of. And of course, love makes blind.
>> ARTICLE
Kind of makes me wonder if a make-shift molotov would be the best bet against a parasite. I mean they can probably deflect bullets with the scythes since they're bullshit and OP, but how do you deflect a flammable liquid? I'm hoping to see a makeshift flamethrower at some stage in this series.

I know it's a bit of science fiction monster film clich, but I really do love seeing grotesque things from outer space being set on fire.

\*Sees a zombie eat a person* "Let's peacefully go to them and talk without any weapons, it'll be fine don't worry I'll just ask them to leave if they are actually killers. It's not like they'd kill us if they kill humans right?"


>> ARTICLE
She's got a bottle of mystery liquid, it's gonna be okay...
>> ARTICLE
I can't tell if anyone else thinks so but I'm pretty sure it was Chloroform and she thought she could knock him out with it before he attacked her.
>> ARTICLE
The thing about chloroform being useful for incapacitating unsuspecting victims is a myth caused by pop fiction. It doesn't actually work the way it does in the heads of buy one get one free crime writers.

Here's an excerpt from [an article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2044.1998.528-az0572.x/pdf) published by the Professor of Anaesthesia at the University of London:

> "Accordingly, in 1865 in a brilliantly perceptive and caustic annotation, the Lancet took to task the then popular press about their refusal to accept the evidence of an experienced physician that anaesthesia by chloroform was not very quickly or very easily effected
upon a nonconsenting person and that with the utmost
resignation and good will some 5 min or more was requisite
to produce anaesthesia, yet were willing to accept the
evidence of an individual who was utterly drunk at the
time that he claimed instantaneous insensibility following
exposure to a handkerchief impregnated with chloroform."

Basically, you'd need the right dosage, and you'd need to be sitting there patiently holding the rag against their nose and mouth for at least 5 minutes. For the real kicker, they'd have to allow you to administer it. In other words, with any sort of struggle on the part of the victim it's impossible to use in such a fashion.

Maybe you were joking, but I said I'd clear up the misconception anyway.

As for the bottle, it's probably some kind of acidic paint thinner or something like that used to clean brushes, it came out of a case of art supplies after all.
>> ARTICLE
It's more likely to be acid, I think. 
>> ARTICLE
Acid to burn the face, for proof that he can faceshift
>> ARTICLE
*Would* it prove that though?  So far the aliens (aside from Migi) have not been able to heal physical damage to their bodies.
>> ARTICLE
to the bodies not the head. The head itself is the alien. the body is still human so he could cure the acid wound on his head.

Also migi didnt heal anyone. He just let him live and he healed himself over time.

>> ARTICLE
I facepalmed so hard at that logic. Shinichi is losing it though.
>> ARTICLE
But according to Migi, Shinichi stays calm no matter what happens.
>> ARTICLE
It was kind of funny how Migi said that he stays calm no matter what happens right after he got done screaming at his girlfriend to shut up.
>> ARTICLE
Migi has become increasingly irrational, hasn't he?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I literally facepalmed when she said "I should talk to Shimada-kun first".
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't even facepalm lol. I was just stumped with how dumb she was, I honestly couldn't believe she would actually throw herself in that situation.
>> ARTICLE
This is my first post on /r/anime. I logged on right after watching ep 09 just so I can find a place where I can vent at how dumb that character is. I switched stances towards the end from "No! Don't be dumb!" to "She's about to be Darwined out of our gene pool and I don't feel bad about that."
>> ARTICLE
I screamed "You dumbass!" at my computer. I then had to explain my outburst to my mother who is sitting in the same room as me. She agrees that Yuko is a dumbass. She also wants to watch this show, now, so there's that.

**Edit:** Since people seem to like my mom, here's some more info about her. She's 56. She loves anime and always watches with me when I'm home from break. So far she's seen and loved:

1. Angel Beats!

Having family watch anime with you is the best. One of the best memories I have is going to blockbuster to rent and watch Evangelion with my mom when I was a kid.

Why would someone show Evangelion to a child?

Well the first few episodes are pretty tame. I wanted to watch it because it had robots on the box cover. I was definitely impacted by the end of evangelion though.

I would love to see your mother's reaction to the toothbrush scene in Nisemonogatari. I've watched some anime with my step-mom but I don't think I can ever show her Monogatari. She would probably think I'm in to incest/lolis

Dude that's great. Both my parents think I'm weird for watching "cartoons" as a thirty-something. I would love to be able to watch and share my love for anime with them. Treasure what you have with her (as I'm sure you do); it's truly invaluable.

Yeah, it's not bad. Improves in pretty much every way in the second season as well.

It was actually a gag in manga.

My translation was something like:

"urhh... this hole... in my chest..."

"you can also describe it as a hole in your back!"

Izumi losing it at random places is just hilarious. So many misunderstandings!
>> ARTICLE
The "Shut up!" part gave me goosebumps though. That was fucking cool lol, she fucking annoyed me as well by questioning him again and again.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but that is pretty much like the central question of the show, what it means to be human and all that. Has he stopped being Shinichi, and if so, when did it happen? So it's a question that should be posed a lot. I really liked that outburst, showed how deeply it was affecting him too, as he becomes cognizant of the fact that he's becoming less human, her forcing him to confront that issue is upsetting.

My insight: This kinda reminds me about how animals can't hide their emotions.
>> ARTICLE
They can't? Was there a study or something...? 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure he's wrong, or that it doesn't apply to *all* animals.  Birds can definitely hide things like pain or distress.  A while back I saw a video where a hunter with a pellet gun shot a bird but it hit off target and ended up shattering the bird's wing.  Even though the bird was probably in some serious pain and could no longer fly, it just continued to forage for food on the ground.  This is because showing that you are injured or in pain is a sign for predators to move in for the kill.
>> ARTICLE
Good catch. Most likely his more complex processes like sympathy have been hindered, while his more instinctual ones like anger have been heightened, or become more dominant through the lack of compassion or something. The limbic system is one of the oldest structures of our brain, and it contains the amygdala which controls our fear and anger.

It's pretty much textbook sociopathy/psychopathy. Diminished emotions, lack of empathy, lower impulse control, low stress/remorse/fear, etc.

She's gonna feel like a dick when she finds out his mum died
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why he doesn't tell her that. He doesn't have to tell her the whole story, just be like, "my mom died in an accident during the trip." 
>> ARTICLE
Because that would make perfect, logical sense and clearly be completely out of character for our remade MC...
>> ARTICLE
MC never wants others to worry about him.
>> ARTICLE
\- Every anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
She's aware of the "mincemeat murders".  All he would need to do is tell her that his mom was killed that way and the whole puppy thing would be a non-issue anymore.  She would think that his attitude towards the dead dog was the result of him coping with his mother getting torn apart.
>> ARTICLE
Because he loved his mother, and would probably not want to pin the changes within himself on her death, as that would be shoving away the responsibility. He has long ago been catagorized as the "strong-silent"-type after he became superhuman himself, and actually guilt tripping Murano with his moms death would make no sense, what so ever.

My two cents.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't think of it as guilt tripping, but when you lose someone so close to you (i.e. a parent) wouldn't you want others to empathize? It seems like they're not going to hold a funeral or anything, but wouldn't you at least tell your close family and friends when your mom passed away? 

I also wouldn't think of it as shoving away responsibility. People change after someone close to them passes away, and though his changes are more because he, himself almost died and merged with Migi more closely, but I think part of his changes are also because of his mom's death. For one, he's more cautious and more willing to fight than before. I think even if he didn't have super human strength he would still want revenge for his mom and kill all the parasytes he can.
>> ARTICLE
I personally know a few people who lost a parent and pretty much never mentioned it again. It's not something you want to talk about. Notice how earlier he was talking about how his mom is "missing".

Also he is pretty cold now, he knows he has changed but can't tell when he is doing something that's cold anymore. So he might not even think logically explaining that his mum died to be a reasonable response.
>> ARTICLE
Why would he want to have sympathy when he can't feel it himself?

Don't, I've read the manga myself before. The anime presents the story much better in my opinion; you'll be losing out if you do.

>> ARTICLE
Quick question as an anime watcher: 

Do you think all of the manga will be covered in the anime? I looked on MAL and the manga is only 60~ish chapters, and the adaption is 24. With about 15 episodes left, do you think they'll cover all of it?
>> ARTICLE
Probably all of the plot elements will be covered but i'm not sure *every* little thing will be.  Some things will be left out or simply implied.  For example, [](/s "there is a sex scene in the manga that I'm pretty sure won't be making it into the anime"), but it's possible they will imply what happens without showing it.

They already have left some stuff out but it wasn't really terribly important.  When Shinichi was staying by the hospital where his father was, that girl was pretty much into him immediately without much explanation, but that's because the anime cut out most of the scenes in the manga that explained why she liked him.
>> ARTICLE
Sex scene? Moar spoilers pl0x.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Shinichi had sex with Murano(tits shown) before he went for the final fight against the strongest parasyte.")
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm definitely reading the manga.. the only question is whether to read it now, or wait 3.5 months for the anime to end.... ughhhhh decisions decisions.
>> ARTICLE
Well if you're going to read it even tho anime SURPASSES the manga AND the art is outdated as fuck, you can probably just do it right now. However, again, I wouldn't read the manga at all if I were you.
>> ARTICLE
The outdated art would probably irk me a ton, but I'm near the point of going crazy from cliffhangers!
>> ARTICLE
wow. Dunno what I thought I would get but that spoilered more than I expected o.o
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "this scene NEEDS to make in to the anime, it is the most powerful sex scene I've seen in manga (in movie it was terminator 1) as it is all about survival as individual and knowing he has to protect his 'family' gave him the courage to face the antagonist.")
>> ARTICLE
I agree with them pretty much cutting her out, I mean she never shows up again, unless they go anime original (i hope to god not, the ending is pretty good) 
>> ARTICLE
When they skip parts, would you be so kind as to tell us, so we can look them up and read them in the manga? Pretty please please. I'll think of other ways to make you feel better for later
>> ARTICLE
I've actually just re-read the manga recently and have been somewhat feigning ignorance in my episode comments to not spoil future plot points.

Now it's possible they will reveal this next episode and just left it out in this episode for an increased dramatic effect, but [](/s "Glasses Girl is *not* as stupid as she appears to be.  She's already deduced that physical blows or stabbing attacks won't hurt the parasyte or make him reveal his true form, but she *wants* him to reveal his true form so he can be captured.")  This information was given to us previous to her confronting the parasyte in the manga but in this episode it was not explained ahead of time, making her look kind of stupid.

One thing I can say without spoiling anything is that the anime is more tense and serious than the manga.  This is not a bad thing, but the anime has made some minor changes to make things more dramatic.  For example, in this episode Shinichi is talking with Murano when Shimada confronts the thugs, forcing Shinichi to run away from her without explanation and making Murano concerned.  She was not there in the manga, nor was there back at the school sadly waiting with his bag.  Later after confronting Shimada with Murano with him, Shinichi does **not** yell at her to shut up.  Instead they joke a bit and they go out to dinner together (although he loses his temper shortly after that).

At this point in the manga she questions Shinichi's "change" in a far more lighthearted fashion; at this point in the anime she seems sad and very concerned.  At this point in the manga Shinichi's "change" is far less noticeable.  In the anime he appears somewhat expressionless while almost forcing himself to show emotion, but in the manga his demeanor hasn't changed much and he shows emotion nearly all the time, but sometimes he forgets or does something odd (the dog incident for example).  The anime probably changed this to speed things along.

Sure I will point out the changes when I see them but I often won't be able to watch the episode immediately after it airs due to work. 
>> ARTICLE
Anime vs Manga difference in scene with Kana [Ep. 8](/s "When Kana asks Shinichi to escort her to the train after seeing Murano passing by, in the manga she wraps her hands around Shinichi's left arm. In the anime she just has her hand on his back. It's subtle but I thought it was interesting why they decided to portray it that way instead. Also, when Shinichi tells Kana about her ability and that he is also dangerous the scene ends abruptly with Kana's '...' expression, however, in the manga her reaction is extended with her saying something like 'I'm gonna laugh to death! HAHAHA!' so loud that students in the surrounding area can't help but notice. After that, she walks slightly ahead, giggles to herself a bit more, and then turns around smiling and says "Goodbye!" to Shinichi.")
>> ARTICLE
Man, I should probably not have read that spoiler (though it only spoils something from the next episode), but I am glad to hear it nevertheless.
>> ARTICLE
You are a good reader. Every manga reader I came across seems to ignore the minor details the anime cut and says it's unimportant. I disagree with them because I felt the anime and manga has a very different feel to it.

Definitely. I am very confident they will finish unless they plan on making a movie of the ending or something like that.

The manga is old and dated, the anime updates the presentation a lot.

As can be seen when Shinichi's dad has a tablet next to him during pretty much every scene before they left for the trip.

Dumb girl! I wonder what she thought that bottle would do for her in that situation...she even saw the monster drawing

I like the way you think..have an up vote 
>> ARTICLE
She was looking for a weapon, and she was like "Nah, he'll see that coming. Oh, shit, what's this?"  

It's a bottle of acid. Probably Sulfuric or something. It's going to mess that guy up good.  

That shit can eat metal. Pretty quickly, too. I think she's going to hurl it at his head, and because he was dumb enough to go and expose all his tender bits and eyes and weird shit, it's going to splash all over him, and it's going to get into his tender bits, and probably his creepy, lidless eyes.  

Dude's gonna get totally messed up.

I was gonna say it's probably paint thinner because the box she took it out from had paints in them, but there was a *chisel and pliers* in that same box. Like why do you need such tools for painting..

Madhouse would literally never take on something like One Piece. They just don't handle indefinitely long series (no, Hunter x Hunter is not INDEFINITELY long, they knew it was going to end around ep 150). 

Yes, Madhouse would probably be an improvement over Toei, but it wouldn't be as Godlike as you would think.

Toei Guy: Guys, guys! You know how we make 4:30 of intro and flashback to consume our 23 minutes? I got an idea, what if instead of wasting peoples time doing that every episode, why don't we just have an episode every 30 episodes or so to give a flashback on the arc so far so people who already know whats happenning can skip and episode and they would get a ton of content in the ones relevant to the plot?

Higher-Up: Great idea. You're fired.

They can only animate so much per One piece episode at this point without stopping production for a year or three.. They are REALLY close to current manga chapters..That's why it doesn't bother me as much..

2 episodes of Parasyte. Today is just a really good day.

__________________

* I'm starting to think the "Shinichi, tsumetai" gag was subtle foreshadowing of Shinichi's cold attitude we're seeing right now. 

* There's one thing I don't understand. If Shinichi doesn't have emotions anymore, why does he get angry? Isn't anger a part of our emotion?

* Death flag on that glasses girl is more obvious than the Shinichi's mom. EDIT : Nvm. She's so dead. Stupid move, glasses girl.

**Opinion :**

Damn, I want more. If Parasyte was already done, I would've marathoned it in one day. The animation is great and the music is just perfect.

Only problem I have so far is that the glasses girl did such a really unrealistic move. Noone in their right mind would do that after hearing plausible rumors. Murano's reaction to Shinichi's development is very realistic though.




>> ARTICLE
> There's one thing I don't understand. If Shinichi doesn't have emotions anymore, why does he get angry? Isn't anger a part of our emotion?

Perhaps he's becoming more calculating/logical than just "unemotional". Mugi said he's become "stronger, not so much as a human, but as a life form". I think he's more strongly experiencing emotions that help with his survival as a life form(like anger), while emotions that don't(like sadness) are being suppressed. 
>> ARTICLE
The problem with his emotion is not that he has none. What we know so far is that he can't cry anymore, but still feels a bit sad. He still has anger but can quickly recover. He still feels happiness (when talking to Murano for example). He also seems a lot more doubtful and suspicious towards others. He is alsomore likely to show his power (and I get a bit of a feeling that he somehow enjoys it). All of this seems like an improvement if you see it in a way similiar to Migi: Survivial. All of this would help him surviving in nature. And considering there are no real laws for Parasytes, also in the environment he is in. This is supported by the fact that his physical abbilities also drastically improved, which also helps survival.

On another note, the behaviour of the girl is interesting. Without a doubt it is a stupid move that seems unrealistic when you first think about it. However, you shouldn't forget that she loves him, something that doesn't just go away if she has the *suspicion* that he may be a monster, especially since his looks didn't change which is obviously the main reason she loves him, considering she barely knows him. She is also a teenager and a really shy one to boot. It is probably her first love. She is indulging in wishful thinking hoping and telling herself that he is not actually anything like that. I mean she even has doubts after *seeing him regenerate a part of his head right in front of her*. She is also really naiv. She doesn't grasp just how strong the monsters are and how much danger they give of (pretty hard from a *drawn* picture). So she thought that whatever liquid is inside of the bottle is enough to defend her. This is also shown by how she *still* has doubts and doesn't take the bottle  after he has basicly admitted that he is a monster.

Overall it is not what most humans would do, but I could think that someone might do that in her position. I have also seen/heard of people do way more stupid things for way less reason, so I could even think of some idiot doing that without actually having a reason besides curiosity.
>> ARTICLE
The part about the power show off, I don't think it's enjoyment, but more like he's simply superior to these thugs, like adults feel annoyed and scold children when they don't listen. 
>> ARTICLE
But he shows of his power when he doesn't have to, something overall not beneficial to him. I don't think you can say he is *superior* to the other men, but I get the feeling he *feels* himself superior and is enjoying that position. I am not sure yet though, since there are also other possible ways to explain it. I will look furhter into it.

But I am quite sure he is not interested in scolding them or trying to show them how wrong they are.
>> ARTICLE
No i don't mean he is interested in scolding them or anything. I mean his position, as a guy who knows how stupid what those thugs are doing. 

And by superior I mean in a physical way, and he is also more informed of the situation. Both Shinichi and the Parasyte guy can defeat or end them without trouble, and they are simply unnecessary meddlers in the two. When he tries to use strength to scare the thugs off, it's simply so that they know to leave, and it's for the good of both Shinichi and these thugs.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for misunderstanding you. This was one of the other ways to explain it I was talking about. I am not sure yet, but yours is probably more likely to be the case considering where his developement seems to be going. However, I still think that if his main intention was to end the conflict fast and effective, other means would have been better. Choosing to reveal his really sudden gain of strength in not only his physcal, but also mental state (immediatly recognizing who the leader is, for instance) is not necessarily a good idea.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he has lost all emotions otherwise he wouldn't get angry, care about human life, or care about being human. He is just more logical than emotional, but he still has them.
>> ARTICLE
They explain it very well in the manga

Man, this show is so brilliant. Madhouse is really putting in a lot of effort to keep the quality of this show high and it's showing!

On another note, as much as I love seeing Shinichi be a badass, him not showing emotion is rather heartbreaking to me. It makes me feel as though he truly is heartless, after seeing all the emotions he went through in the earlier episode.

I wonder what's going on with Shinichi though... It kinda seems like he lost all his empathy or something but he's constantly flipping out these days. Well I'm sure we'll get some sort of explanation further down the line as to why his personality changed in the particular way it did... atleast I hope we will.

OMG WHAT A CLIFFHANGER I CANT WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK!!Seriously whoever decided to animate this manga from the 90s i would like to give them a hug. Parasyte is easily becoming one of my favourite animes, Even after 1 hour special its still not enough the time flew by like it was nothing. As manga reader madhouse is doing a amzing job with source material so it doesnt feel to outdated and the same time faithfully adapted the important parts.

TWO EPISODES? STILL NOT ENOUGH.

Now that I've been spoiled with a bonus episode today and still want more, I wonder if I can make it the rest of the season without losing my mind.  Should I go into hibernation until the rest of it has aired?

Anywho...  as much as I wish we could see Shinichi being a badass saving that girl, her stupidity makes me kind of hope she dies so she doesn't fuck everything up.  Either way will have its pros and cons I guess.

she has a disposable face and terminal stupidity.

Wow these 2 episodes were way too good. So much progression. I'm not a manga reader but was that like the final boss that's on the poster that was talking to tamya ryoko. (don't answer me lol)

It's pretty cool how humans are aware of Parasites and perhaps are already developing some countermeasures. Parasites' complete lack of concern for human life might be their downfall. However, it's also a problem for hybrids like Shinichi. His father's reaction to his son being half-alien probably wouldn't be pretty. Worst case, he'd become hunted by the government along the rest of the Parasites, and he isn't even able to change his face.

[Rouko getting re-introduced with a different appearance.](http://imgur.com/a/OXRhF) Now should be safe to mention, this was already foreshadowed in OP.

I'm literally walking around the house recapping hard on these two episodes. The fact that we have this cliffhanger as well is DRIVING ME BONKERS.

I love this show. Keep up the good work :D
>> ARTICLE
Amazing amazing, I like Kana a lot. sadly he will not choose her ( guessing from The OP)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that was really great idea with those 2 ep in a row.....like hell it was! THe best part is that we will see another one in two weeks, not earlier. I'm a bit mad cuz it really is a great anime, and the tension that 9th ep built was enormous with so many twists, but as I said: C U IN 2 WEEKS... ;((
>> ARTICLE
Why again double episodes in two weeks?
>> ARTICLE
I cringed so hard at her dumbness. Looks like next episode we'll bath in blood !
>> ARTICLE
I really dislike Murano.  It's been a damn long time since I have read the manga so I am thankful I barely remember anything from it so I can watch it and be surprised.....  but...  This girl Satomi..  

I can't stand female characters like that..  Also what the fuck kind of question is "Are you really X person?  I get for plot, but how would anyone react to those questions.  Ffs someone pls pm and tell me Shinichi is done with her because I cannot remember.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's going to be a long week until we see glasses girl get slaughtered.
>> ARTICLE
Worst case of "Will Senpai Notice Me" ever.

Also, I'm loving the angst and inner turmoil Shinichi is going through. His metamorphosis into something resembling Migi is truly fascinating and ironic: what he detests most about the parasytes (that they are incapable of human emotion and reasoning) is exactly what he might become himself. I think he's more than capable of straying from that path but it's gonna be tough. Yelling at Satomi like that is not going to go over too well I'm afraid. There goes my OTP!

Everyone has their own theories on Shinichi not having feelings but I'm pretty sure he has just lost his empathy.

It seems pretty obvious with how he treated the dead puppy.

I forgot how dumb the glasses girl was when I read the manga. Best logic: talk to the seemingly dangerous person alone in a room instead of your brother who works with the police. 

Anyway this adaption has been great so far. Can't wait for next week for some badassery. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to make a prediction; hunky monster-man kills/near fatally wounds glasses girl shinichi kills him at which point Murano walks in on the massacre (migi might injures her) she freaks the fuck out resulting in shinichi becoming a fugitive with a guilt complex. His dad will turn him in to the law and denounce him as his son.  OR murano aids shinichi in hiding the truth.

Okay, I don't even care if it's a huge spoiler or anything, I just want to know.  Does Shinichi ever tell Murano about Migi? I don't need to know what happens, or why it doesn't happen, I just feel like a lot of conflict between the two could have been avoided had Shinichi let Murano in to the situation somehow.

Yes or no?
>> ARTICLE
Episode 9? I thought episode 8 was the one that came out this week... I could've sworn I watched last week, so I must've been one episode behind for at least two weeks! Well, at least I don't have to wait this time!

This week we have a double episode (episode 8 & 9). That's why you're getting confused.

fucking cliffhangers AAARRRGGGH this show is TOO good, when they pull stuff like this it leaves me like a ravenous dog trying to comprehend that I'm gonna have to wait for my next meal lol.  I hope the MC's friend turns out Ok and that he can patch things with Murano :O

There was a hint somewhere, even manga reader won't expect *this* to happen next episode...
>> ARTICLE
Heh, this Shimada guy. For a Parasite, he sure knows how to pick a spot to morph his face.
>> ARTICLE
Has anyone else noticed that Migi seems to be becoming a bit more human-like, just like how Shinichi is becoming more like a parasite? It's getting a bit of a sense of humour.
>> ARTICLE
Must be Christmas. Didn't think there'd be another episode. 

Man his transformation was pretty good I forgot how he was back then. 

I bet she'll be a good guy due to that baby. At least I really hope so. 

This guy, he can't do anything. Can't explain the situation to Murano, gotta save those people.

He's gone, far too gone. Shinichi you might be too far gone to be saved. Yelling at Murano. 

Well looks like Glasses girl might die or be saved.

There is a limit to how stupid you can be. Honestly wtf was she thinking, did she really think that would work...

Are there actually two episodes being released?

Yes. Episode 9 is already up on Crunchyroll.

Well.. Shinichi said it all at the end.
"That idiot!"
Darwin Award for her plz

Also. Murano is getting pretty annoying.
"You used to be cute and shy!"  *10

Is it just me, or does that same music always play around the 14 minute mark when there's a sudden revelation?

It makes me really mad when Shinichi does/says stupid things to Murano and she gets all upset! Why can't he just tell her about his mother? It will make a lot of his actions more clear and understandable.

I also wonder how it seems like no one notices the absence of his glasses, and how his hair gets all puffed up without them! xD

If he's not human, he can easily do that. However, at that point of time, he's having a struggle with his inner self and those punks should find themselves lucky.

I thought for sure they were gonna fight this episode... well there's always next week. Also RIP Shinichi's harem 2014-2014.

Blessed double episode.  Holy shit though, that was really intense.  Shinichi has really become "insect" like with the biggest difference between him and the main parasites being that his human body is enhanced whilst they can only shift forms.  Pretty neat advantage.
>> ARTICLE
God these FUCKING CLIFFHANGERS.
>> ARTICLE
I've been trying to wonder, what was the significance of Shinichi saying to Murano that he's changed but that he's "not trying"? Was that something lost in translation?
>> ARTICLE
No, he pretty much said the same thing in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
She means he's trying to hard to look cool. His change was so sudden that she's saying there is no way you're not trying too hard.

I'm about 80 percent sure that the next universe will reveal Shinichi's hand to the overall populace

This shows is actually very good. I haven't read the source material myself but I understand it's old and really like the way they've adapted it to not show it's age. In Japan it's getting some stick but this is so well done, I'm a fan of Madhouse now.

Well, shit. I understand you want to be in denial about all this, Yuko, but that does not seem like a great plan. Hopefully she lives :/

It was sad to see Shinichi's dad descending into alcoholism, but I'm glad we got confirmation that the government is aware of and is doing something about the parasites. If only Shinichi could do something to help without, you know, getting experimented on himself.

I don't know how we will manage to wait for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
And then the classic "I should confront him about it without telling anyone" scenario.  People in real life aren't that stupid - why make your anime characters that stupid?  Show just lost some points for this.

Why does Shimada transform in public? He does it right in front of the billboard and again in the alleyway when he could have just done it while changing?

Any explanation?

Why is Murano such a fucking bitch?
>> ARTICLE
Why do you think so?

I think she's really sweet when she wasn't insecure.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you, Murano is incredibly sweet and really cares about Shinichi, but Shinichi is too unaware why she is so worried about him.
>> ARTICLE
I have never felt [this frustrated](http://i56.tinypic.com/sf835x.png) with the dumb-as-fuck logic of a character EVER in any form of media. I'm not saying she *deserves* to die, but man, she even saw the parasyte regenerate and morph his head and still has to ask him about it.

Anyways, it bothers me that Murano is so focused on Shinichi being colder. We get it, he is colder, but can't you talk once without going "are you shinichi?" "you've changed" every five minutes?

Glasses bitch deserves to die
>> ARTICLE
I want to like this show a lot, and I still kinda do, but there's a lot that's bugging me. 

Shinichi talking real loud to Migi right in front of people like that isn't really obvious and weird, over and over again. It's become some power fantasy of shy weak kid turns into badass, with every girl wanting his D. All of the main characters seem to be in exactly the right place at exactly the right time to observe exactly the right thing in order to advance the plot. Everything seems sort of....childish? Immature? I'm not sure what the word is exactly, but it's a big contrast to the mature gore and violent nature of the show. If someone knows what I'm on about and has a better way of putting it, I'd love to hear.
>> ARTICLE
The thing you're supposed to take from his development is not him being a badass but someone who is less than human and lacking in some emotions. 

He's also whispering to Migi, yes it's weird and it adds to everyone who thinks he has changed. 
>> ARTICLE
Wimpy, mild mannered glasses-wearing nerd who gets bullied by street punks gains powers from a parasitical creature, becomes bad-ass, loses parental figure, takes off glasses, beats up street punks, suddenly popular with long-term crush/es, then loses her. 

This is Spiderman.

At least I have Amagi this week, but I'm always on time for that one.

I have no idea if [Vivid] is actually going to put it out tomorrow though.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, to be honest I saw that coming. Kana got way too involved and was becoming obsessed with Shinichi, it was only a matter of time before something bad happened. Damn that was an epic punch, and it was even his "human" hand that did it.
>> ARTICLE
"I can only sense Shinichi", she said. After mixing up Shinichi with Shimada and even that random female parasyte in the previous scene...
>> ARTICLE
I feel her death was very realistic. They could have easily spun this into her being right, but nope. She got it wrong, and paid the price ;_;
>> ARTICLE
While watching, I sometimes felt spiteful about how realistic it was.

As an observer, you can see what's wrong, but it's actually so fitting that she'd overreach because she's at the perfect age to still be experiencing puberty, teen angst, young love, and all those things that boil over reason.

Once I remembered how jumbled teen years can be, the story became undeniably compelling all the way through to Kana's tragic end. It's so good! ;w;
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I really liked that aspect of it, too. Despite the supernatural themes, this show isn't one to slip into sentimentality or escapism.

The Parasyte senses work in pretty specific ways, Kana was sensitive, but she wasn't superhuman or "different". She sensed them in the same way, but without a clear understanding of it, she had no idea what to expect. She already probably had a pretty borderline personality - look at her group of bully friends before she met Shinichi. She was attracted to risk, she went overboard, and she died for it.

It's actually ridiculous when you think what Shinichi has gone through, he would be seriously fucked up if it wasn't for Migi making him less 'human.'
>> ARTICLE
"Migi, handle the defense, I'm in the mood to *fuck this guy up*."

Honestly, I kinda have to agree with Migi at the end there, this was bound to happen as Kana became more and more deluded. That scene after the funeral was the best part of the episode though. Those moments contrasting Shinchi's struggle to retain his humanity with the reactions of those around him are what make me like him so much as a MC this season. Though seriously, couldn't you have like jumped over a building or something to convince Kana earlier?

Next episode is titled "Hello, Sadness." I'm sure that bodes well.

Am I the only one who feels bad for [him](http://imgur.com/JI1BCeX) :'(
>> ARTICLE
I feel bad for him, for multiple reasons.  I think him and Kana could have been an okay couple, had Kana not been a psychotic retard.  Despite the fact that the dude was a douche, he truly cared for her and she walked all over him and is now gone.

I felt worse for him than I did for Kana, for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Yeh, even if hes an asshole sometimes. horrible shit is always happening to him and he never understands it D:.
>> ARTICLE
His character is a lot more interesting than Kana's character, for me anyway. He is relatable and is a rather well constructed character (for a side character especially good). So yes I actually felt sorry for him, compared to Kana dying where I was afraid they would pull some shit to get her to live which I would have hated.
>> ARTICLE
This show doesnt really seem the type to pull that kinda thing. Even when they brought Shinichi back from a heart wound earlier, it was done in a fairly believable manner. 
>> ARTICLE
And when he was brought back, it was done in a way that had real consequences.  

Migi wouldn't have been able to fix her. Even if he could, he would have had to split his body, and it would have significantly weakened him.
>> ARTICLE
Thats one of the strongest suites of this show. They make everything have weight because it seems believable.    

And we all know migi wouldnt weaken himself unless hes gonna die from it like before. 
>> ARTICLE
No, you're not. He was a dick, but he genuinely cared for Kana, and she paid him no mind and focused on Shinichi right up until her death. Yeah, I feel bad for him.
>> ARTICLE
I still think he is a dick, but yes, I feel bad for him
>> ARTICLE
Kana threw out so many death flags this episode, if the parasyte didn't kill her the sheer weight of them would have crushed her to death.

RIP in Pieces Kana :(

Edit: words

Never has my mouth been left open so long after a characters death. This was truly one hell of an episode, shame she had to go so soon too. I guess we should all feel lucky that [best girl](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/migi_parasite_5933.jpg) is still alive.

The SS Kana has been torpedoed multiple times on it's way toward Shinichi island. I repeat, the SS Kana has been torpedoed. Reports coming in are hazy, but we believe the ship is lost. No survivors. 

May the sailors on that ship rest in peace, as I doubt they would abandon their ship. 

Now back to your regularly scheduled show discussion. So Shinichi is slowly losing it. He's flipping tables at every little provocation. He's going for the kill shots himself rather than letting Migi handle it, and he's completely comfortable with it. He's looking down on the human race now, whereas before he was all "We can fight it! Go humans!" Hell, he's starting to hate himself for it. I don't think he recognizes he still has emotions. Just a lot more anger than sadness. And next week's episode is called 'hello sadness' so I'm guessing he's going to figure that out very soon. Heh, the entire episode I was thinking to myself "Goddammit don't get yourself killed trying to prove you're more worthy or some shit like that". And looks what she goes and does. Goddammit. It was watching a mountain goat climb up those intensely steep cliffs. It's all fine and dandy despite how dangerous it looks, and then poof gust of wind and the goat falls off. Then it's like "Well shit, I knew it was a possibility, but now it's happened and it still sucks."

Murano seriously needs more development.. at this rate, she's on par with Maki, that girl who works at the inn near the Sakurazaki hospital.

I thought Maki was cuter and much more adorable than '~~ARE YOU SHINICHI~~ HONTO DA IZUMI-KUN?'

I know, right? Even though they're both one-dimensional at this point, at least Maki's concern was more energetic.

Don't piss off Shinichi, this dude ripped out a guys heart. The anime ripped our hearts as well ... :'(

FUUUUCK!! I liked her. I liked her a lot more than Murano. Why didn't he choose her? Why didn't she listen? She got herself killed. 

He could easily have showed proof, instead of showing his right hand. He's got that chest scar, he can leap over fences, speed, strength. 

Ugh, this sucks. What a way to end it. Now we just gotta wait. So upset she's gone. 

EDIT: By the way, the OST is out for the show. http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/VPCG-84988

A girl like Kana in real life is easily one of the most annoying people you'll ever meet. Kana was stupid and totally wreckless. "OH I CAN ONLY FEEL YOU SHINICHI!!!" Even though she never got it right and nearly died like 3 times. It was so satisfying to see someone dumb die from their dumb decisions. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah, fuck that girl.  I'm glad she's gone.  That bitch was retarded, through and through.  Way too crazy, doesn't listen to life-saving advice.  Fuck her.

Pshhh, Murano is so bland. I'm waiting for a personality trait beyond "I like nerdy Shinichi, why is your hair like that, blah."

Not awful though.

Ugh I wish that the OP came out sooner because my OST ships with the OP ;__;

Only problem is that the OST doesn't include one of the best songs, the one which played when he first met her in that abandoned building , which is the same as the one when she first looked into his eyes and played a few other times as well, with beeps and shit :(

>> ARTICLE
In the end she got herself killed, and that's what makes her death really sad.  If she had trusted him as much as she believed she loved him she would still be alive.
>> ARTICLE
Would you mind explaining why you like Kana over Murano? I think both aren't great characters but I would consider Murano a better character and more likeable. Kana seems really shallow and basicly her whole character can be devided into: Has a crush on Shinichi, is really obsessed with her crush on Shinichi, and hides her insecurities in her crush on Shinichi. And she looks rather good.

While Murano is also defined primarily with her relation to Shinichi, they share a backstory and she also has some character traits not neccesary to have a crush on Shinichi. The constant repition of how much Shinichi changed is kind of annoying as well, but at least it's put in a little different context each time and that actually progresses the plot as well as makes Shinichi reflect on himself, and indirectly changes Shinichi's and Migi's dynamic, which is for me the main appeal of the show, together with the topics resulting of their dynamic.
>> ARTICLE
Well, by no means are they great characters, I just liked her better. Sure she had less screen time than Murano, but in that short amount of time, I found her better than Murano. As far as I know she's still doubting him.

Kana was unique, she could detect others aside from Shinichi, she could more or less, emit a transmission that could call them towards her. If anything, that's useful, especially when Migi is sleeping. I was expecting that to be a vital part of the storyline, but I guess not.

Aside from that I have no real concrete answer to why I like her better, I just do. It's the more or less the same as shipping characters. 
>> ARTICLE
My answer for it is because I am getting real tired of Murano's "Are you reaaaaaaaally Shinichi?" bs.
>> ARTICLE
At least to my taste, the extension of the OST is horribly asynchronous with the rhythm set forth by the TV size and amplifies a screamo-drum-electronic completely distant in atmosphere and is thus a complete disappointment.

I liked her character design much more than Murano's, but yeah, Murano's the better choice on account of not being flipping insane.

Murano at least knows enough to be distrustful of him and everyone else at this point.  
>> ARTICLE
Nah I like Murano a lot more. Kana freaked me out with her stalking and "it's fate" stuff. Murano is a lot calmer, more personal to Shinichi and would pair better with him.
>> ARTICLE
Murano doesn't actually love him. She's constantly going on about how he's changed, whereas Kana loved that spark inside of him when he stood up for that one noob when they first met, loved him even more when he turned into super Shinichi. 

Meanwhile, Murano is still bitching about him not being Shinichi. I don't think she deserved the attention, she just had a huge advantage with being friends for so long and Shinichi was stuck on her. 
>> ARTICLE
> Murano doesn't actually love him. She's constantly going on about how he's changed, whereas Kana loved that spark inside of him when he stood up for that one noob when they first met, loved him even more when he turned into super Shinichi.

This.

>> ARTICLE
> Murano is a bitch for noticing a change and asking why he has become so cold

She noticed a MAJOR change in someone close to her and is wondering why he has changed so much because it seems he can't explain it. I would be freaked the fuck out if my best friend started acting like Shinichi is now, shit would be crazy!
>> ARTICLE
Well I didn't say she was a bitch just that she was whining incessantly about something she had no control over as if she were ungrateful while it was the opposite for Kana. 
>> ARTICLE
It's the closest word I could think of for your description. Especially coming from your she doesn't love him part. I feel that she does love him, but knows him for his old self, not his new self which is the only side Kana knew. You have to place yourself in her shoes and experience what she is experiencing instead of looking in from the outside with the knowledge of what Shinichi is doing and going through.

Also how is she whining ungratefully? Her friend has completely changed in to a new person. Does she wonder if he is involved in selling drugs or maybe the Yakuza has brought him in as a member. Why is my friend acting so cold and taking a 180 degree change from how he was. It's like I don't know him anymore.

That is what she's thinking. You have to look at it from her perspective.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's just the "you are shinchi, right?" over and over again thing that could come off as whiney imo 
>> ARTICLE
I generally put myself in their shoes when thinking about how they might feel about it, but I'm so far removed from her personality I just can't identify. His mother was murdered by a monster and his father was hospitalized by it, you'd have to a be a fool to think that won't change someone, nevermind a high schooler. She expected him to be exactly the same, in spite of the fact that it's high school and people change *drastically* in just 4 years. In spite of the fact that someone he loved with all his heart, someone he's never been apart from for the entirety of his existence was *murdered* and then essentially came back and tried to murder him. 

Put yourself in Shinichi's shoes and then look at Murano from his perspective while also having our 3rd person perspective and knowledge of the situation. How would you feel if the person you were crushing on started to question who you were, while you were struggling with your own existentialism about even being human? How would you react, wouldn't you feel shitty? Let's not forget that they're teenagers and their emotions are cranked up to 11.

TLDR: Murano sucks. I'm not saying Kana is better(I think she is, but objectively they both are pretty craptastic), she's a whole other set of problems. 
>> ARTICLE
> I generally put myself in their shoes when thinking about how they might feel about it, but I'm so far removed from her personality I just can't identify.

And that's not bad, it's fine actually. I was just trying to show you what she could be thinking.

> His mother was murdered by a monster and his father was hospitalized by it, you'd have to a be a fool to think that won't change someone, nevermind a high schooler.

This is also a great point, one that I had not taken in to account.

> She expected him to be exactly the same, in spite of the fact that it's high school and people change drastically in just 4 years.

I'll go back to my point here and bring up her lack of experience with these events. She has not experienced what has happened to Shinichi so she might not know how huge of a toll that takes on someone, since she has never experienced it. I for one do not know what this is like as both of my parents are still alive.

> How would you feel if the person you were crushing on started to question who you were, while you were struggling with your own existentialism about even being human?

Well obviously I would not enjoy it. But it does let him know that others are seeing his change just as he is noticing it.

> Let's not forget that they're teenagers and their emotions are cranked up to 11.

Am in that stage of me life (18) and I totally agree. It can be difficult to think of others instead of yourself at our age due to emotions.



I also just want to say that I'm not trying to be an asshole here and this is totally a calm discussion. Some asshole is downvoting my shit like I'm trying to be an asshole to you or something.
>> ARTICLE
In that episode where they end up going on a date and she realizes his mom got killed she just brushes it off like "lol whatevs quit bein a bitch shinichi" and she realizes she fucked up but doesn't really care, I guess. Really, all of this just makes me not like her at all and if anything, the girl at the beach should have been the one they developed on instead of Murano, who I believe should just fuck off somewhere. 

Only saw one of these posts downvoted but I went ahead and upvoted it to set it back to one if that makes you feel better :P

Seeing her spiral into complete obsession was very well written. She already had some issues, as you could see from her previous friends being delinquents. she wanted to feel special and she realizes she has a special power. She got completely obsessed with wanting her power to be useful.

She might not have believed the chest scar was from a parasite attack. It might've been from some accident he had while he was a normal human. Maybe he had a bad heart or something.

I do agree her death sucks, but she should've listened. 
>> ARTICLE
Y'know, I don't usually buy OSTs, but I love the soundtrack to this show so much I may as well throw some money at it, if only to have on in the car.
>> ARTICLE
Considering how totally in love/obsessed she was with him, I think she would probably be too overexcited to even notice the scar if Shinichi started stripping down infront of her... and then Murano would walk in at just the right moment.

But seriously, I also wanted her to live. How can she be hearing about all these rumours about parasites and police advice about hair pulling and then not believe Shinichi despite having a 'superpower' herself. She at first seemed much more composed and sharp, but eventually she became completely lost in her fantasies.

I was hoping for some miracle Migi-the-surgeon rescue operation with Shinichi having a hand stuck in her chest area for a few days... but then of course I realized that this anime is too good for that and I was being foolish in having that thought.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking shit i so wanted her to live. Back in the agk finale thread i talked about how pessimistic that show made me with characters dying, damnit kiseijuu. But at least we get to see how Shinichi deals with it which hopefully will be something along the lines of wanting to murder every fucking parasyte in the city.
>> ARTICLE
> But at least we get to see how Shinichi deals with it which hopefully will be something along the lines of wanting to murder every fucking parasyte in the city.

Nope. I'm hoping for the polar opposite. I'm hoping he finds more friendly ones and "teams up" with them to kill the bad ones. I don't think Parasytes are inherently evil. They focus solely on survival, they just lack ethics and morals. They aren't doing this to be evil, they are simply trying to survive.

A few have been evil so far like the one that went in to the Yakuza house to see how many he could kill, but I don't think he is inherently evil. I think they became evil just like how some humans become evil.
>> ARTICLE
Yakuza killer parasyte wasn't just killing to be evil, he was gathering information.  He mentioned that it was an experiment to see how a parasyte could do against a group of humans with weapons.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair that could be seen as an evil act. Yes he is gathering information, but he is doing it in a way that pointlessly kills people (even if said people are evil).

> experiment to see how a parasyte could do against a group of humans with weapons.

Kana had death flags waving all over the place throughout the episode. It sucks that she died, and for a moment there I thought Shinichi was going to actually get sad and shed a tear or two. 

Yeah, she should've listened, but she's a teenage girl in love, how can you expect a teenager, let alone one in love to listen? It sucks that Izumi didn't feel the same way about her, but that's just how love works sometimes. No matter how "special" and "connected" you are, sometimes the person you love will look and love someone else instead. 

That aside, was the person Shinichi killed just a random parasite person? Or was it someone from the "gang" of parasites following around the politician?
>> ARTICLE
> but she's a teenage girl in love, how can you expect a teenager, let alone one in love to listen?

Spot on.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain to me why everyone called this [girl](http://myanimelist.net/character/112065/Yuuko_Tachikawa) stupid over nearly getting herself killed by a parasyte...

...but Kana gets to be called best girl even though she ignored multiple warnings from Shinichi and actually did get herself killed?


>> ARTICLE
Kana only got herself killed. Yuuko started a massacre in her school. If I were to make a metaphor, it would be someone committing suicide by hanging themselves, opposed to someone committing suicide by driving into oncoming traffic.

They were both dumb, Kana just chose a better place to be stupid.
>> ARTICLE
Yuuko was being called stupid before the massacre started. And why does she get the blame for it? Shimada made a conscious decision to kill after saying he wouldn't.
>> ARTICLE
You are assuming Shimada was nice enough to not kill people, when you write this. He hadn't killed anyone in the school up until he was pushed into a corner where he wasn't able to change his form back. When pushed into a corner, any predator will attack.

She chose to do it at the school and not elsewhere, which endangered everyone in the building. She might've been the victim, but she was also the cause.
>> ARTICLE
The counterargument is that she has no idea what the parasytes are capable of. iirc all she knew is that he was basically a super-zombie with regeneration and transformation, nothing about being able to move that fast.

That said, she had no fail-safe to alert everyone if things went wrong, and there were always better ways to handle it. She probably thought having more people nearby would make a killer hesitate, since that's what a normal person would do.
>> ARTICLE
Kana was pretty stupid too. I do understand though, like if you think you can "feel" when someone is nearby you would think that person is special and then go nuts. Also remember that she is just a teenager, so escalating things to that level was expected.

Yuuko on the other hand, was just plain stupid. She knew he was a monster but still chose to confront him, getting half the school killed.
>> ARTICLE
I never liked Kana... have always thought she was stupid.  Was ready for her creepy stalker ass to die honestly
>> ARTICLE
I think they both were stupid.
>> ARTICLE
If it helps I think both of them are pretty stupid. However, as others have said already, Yuuko not only almost killed herself, she also caused 17 other deaths. At least Kana was somewhat self contained. Besides, Kana actually died, making her a bit more sympathetic. 
>> ARTICLE
Pardon my intrusion but who's Yuuko again? 
>> ARTICLE
paint thinner grenade girl 

AKA artist girl 

AKA saw a parasyte and asked him whether or not he was one.
>> ARTICLE
Stupidity is the combination of ignorance and arrogance. Clearly Kana was stupid for thinking that she would be protected by Shinichi. But so was Yuuko for thinking that she could take on a parasite without backup. Kana got herself killed. Yuuko got a whole lot of innocent people killed. Kana suffered from teenage love dilutions and it cost her her life. Yuuko suffers from dilutions of grandeur and it cost a lot of innocent lives. 
>> ARTICLE
That chick got others killed not just herself, that's why I don't like her. Honestly Kana was a little too creepy for me.
>> ARTICLE
boobs op
>> ARTICLE
though i didn't like kana as much. She at least had decent character development and potential benefit to the main character.

The other girl confronted a major threat during school which caused an unprecedented massacre. And her biggest link to the plot is that she is related to the guy that kind of sorta knows what is going on with the parasites

While I don't think you're wrong, I still find her to be a better character. I know people are sick and tired of hearing her say "are you really Shinichi" and trust me I am too. But I'm okay with it because as a character she is fantastic. She's conflicted because she wants to know that this is Shinichi. And to be fair, he has changed. It's something that I completely understand both sides and she honestly hasn't really done anything stupid. Just my 2 cents.
>> ARTICLE
> Murano

That's a weird way of spelling Tamiya Ryoko.

>> ARTICLE
I like you.

Cause that girl knew exactly what she was dealing with.

She had no reason to confront him. Nothing good would come out of it.

Kana was madly in love with Shinichi and wanted to prove that they were went for each other. 

Granted they both fucked up. 
>> ARTICLE
She was an intelligent, interesting before the past two episodes (I just watched them both in a row), but you could see how she got more and more attached to Shinichi and her personality started falling apart. She got way too obsessed over wanting to prove that they were right for each other, completely blinded by love. The way her personality changes was done really well.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, it really was just a matter of time before Kana got killed. I'm glad they didn't spend a bunch of time keeping her alive, it would be really stressful to see Shinichi having to run protecting Kana all the time.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand it either. I binged the Manga in one day and just reading through all her chapters made me like Murano more. Sure Murano is annoying, but at least she's not a stalker.
>> ARTICLE
I also binge read the manga because of the break last week. I didn't like Kana before, but in the manga she seemed way stranger/creepier. Also the faces, the manga artists made them so creepy.

That's 80s seinen for you. The illustration was as important as a the story plot.

This is the sad truth. Kana is attractive and crushes on the MC in a very cute way, while Yuuko does not.

And even beyond that, Yuuko was actually able to fight a parasyte and indirectly kill it.
>> ARTICLE
I can't call keeping a strand of his hair, stalking him with literal telepathic powers and having some freaky ass dreams about him, while he already has a girlfriend, a cute way to hit on someone.
>> ARTICLE
> Kana is attractive and crushes on the MC in a very cute way

She wraps his hair around a finger and kisses it. That's not cute, that's creepy as fuck.

>> ARTICLE
Well to be fair, Yuuko was never really given a chance to have a personality. If she were more than a plot device side character, she would've at least gotten a "fuck yeah" point for taking a parasyte down.

Instead, look at what happened: she triggers a massacre at a high school and narrowly escapes.. only to be pushed out of the spotlight to make room for the other main characters. We don't even hear about what happened to her until way after the event ends.
>> ARTICLE
lmao and Kana isnt a plot device? her whole purpose was to develop shinichi as a hard character that doesnt feel and this event is making the police keep an eye on him.
>> ARTICLE
And what purpose does Murano serve exactly?

In a sense you can literally make a case that every character in any show is a plot device.  
>> ARTICLE
lmao i never compared kana to murano but ok. Murano is there to only fawn over the main character. Murano is a little bit better because I at least see her talking to her friends. I dont think I ever seen Kana talk to anyone about anything other Shinichi. She never grows she is just there. Kana was there to fawn over the MC also. We have Shinichi grow and change. We have seen migi change. I love anime but I don't think I will ever see a well written women character. 
>> ARTICLE
You don't think you've ever seen a well written woman character?

It's your choice in anime that's to blame, there.

ANIME WITH WELL WRITTEN WOMAN CHARACTERS:

1. Shinsekai yori

2. Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World

3. Katanagatari

edit: Found it after a simple google search - [Moribito](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1827/Seirei_no_Moribito). Best anime I've ever watched with a female leading character.

>> ARTICLE
I'm not disagreeing with the fact that the female characters are written as side characters. They are. 

Just because they are used to advance the plot isn't a bad thing. 
>> ARTICLE
Especially the protagonist.
>> ARTICLE
 I always saw Murano serving as sort of an anchor to to his humanity and what he once was before all of the parasyte stuff started
>> ARTICLE
They're both plot device side characters. They, like all characters besides Shinichi and Migi have personalities like a wet paper bag.
>> ARTICLE
I would not say Kana had a wet paper bag personality.
>> ARTICLE
The interesting part is that she's barely even mentioned before the event in the manga, while in the anime they gave her more backstory. You either make them faceless one-time characters or underdeveloped side characters.
>> ARTICLE
Actually Yuuko is still kinda cute AND I think a lot of people are irritated with how dumb Kana was this episode. I liked her a lot previously but the past 24 minutes got me over her pretty fast. 

Though a lot of people have made the valid point that Kana was delusional and thought she was actually going to find Shinichi, whereas Yuuko knew pretty much *exactly* what she was facing and still thought the best idea was to confront a possible monster on her own without telling a single person.

Basically, a lot of people think they were both dumb, but we feel sorrier for the character we spent more time getting to know.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but there's another point in Yuuko's favor.

* Yuuko knew what she was walking into, came prepared, and survived.

* Kana was warned ahead of time (and also apparently knew to some degree already from online research) yet still walked into something 3 times in the same damn episode and finally got herself killed.
>> ARTICLE
I think the part that makes you forgive her is that she was crushing so hard on Shinichi that she became delusional about her power and completely obsessive about shinichi.

Kind of hard not to pity her.

Holy shit, Shinichi gets more and more badass every episode. His human hand literally punched a hole through that parasite. He could probably handle a parasite by himself if he had to at this point if Migi happens to be asleep.

RIP [best girl :(](https://jikman.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/parasyte-the-maxim-ep-11-kana-cute-face.jpg)

>> ARTICLE
Man, I liked Kana so much more than Murano. She got too involved thinking she had a special ability to only sense Izumi. Although Izumi is turning into a badass.
>> ARTICLE
I did too, but after this episode, I think I can see where they were going with this arc.  

Simply put, Kana was too much for Shinichi. I'm not sure she would have started listening to him even after he showed her Migi - it's pretty well established by her being friends with the street gang that she was attracted to danger. 

I'm not a huge fan of Murano (thus far), but at least she won't go running headlong into 14 parasytes the instant Shinichi says "don't do that" in an effort to prove she's special. That was liable to get him killed as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Murano's so boring. We saw even less of her than Kana, she showed 1/10th of the emotion, and all she did on-screen was bitch and complain like a broken record. Justifiably, maybe, but they could at least give her some character development. She serves no purpose besides being a regular girlfriend, which doesn't fit in this sort of story at all.
>> ARTICLE
Kana was pretty much a broken record for the last few eps too.
>> ARTICLE
At this point they kind of have to give her some development. They're running out of other characters.
>> ARTICLE
> Although Izumi is turning into a badass.

It's nice to see his human emotions coming back a bit more while he is also becoming more badass. Even Migi said it was impressive which surprised me.
>> ARTICLE
I was with you until she started wearing his hair as a ring.
>> ARTICLE
And the stalking and the "we have a special connection" thing.
>> ARTICLE
God, this show is so god damn good. Holy moly.

Shinichi is so blinded by his human emotions so much he thinks he isn't actually human. What is more human than feeling grief, remorse, frustration, anger and then lashing out when it all comes tumbling down.
>> ARTICLE
Dammit Kana, why couldn't you just listen.   At least entertain the possibility that the signal you're sending might just be from something dangerous.  She runs right up to them every time.  I was hoping Migi could repair her chest since it has experience with that wound already.

Ohh well.  I was expecting Migi to kill her in the meeting anyway.  All the death flags were set.

Yes, Kokoro indeed. I like how even though shinchi's emotions level out quickly its still enough time to punch a hole in someone's chest with his bare (human)hand. 

Good episode, enjoyable, interesting and action! The later half did a good job of creating tension for the viewer. I was literally on the edge of my seat. 

Kana was kind of a creepy stalker but in this episode it was amped up to 11. Ultimately I'm conflicted on her death. On the one hand she was warned several times to avoid the signals, but she kept digging so its kind of her fault. On the other hand, would you believe a high school student who told you there were parasites who look like people eating people with no proof?


>> ARTICLE
Is it ever explained why Kana can feel the parasites? It's been bothering me for a while now.

Sure there were flags, and like Migi said, it was kind of inevitable... But why!? I didn't think it would happen in this episode at the very least.

And damn, this episode had some of the finest use of tension yet. I was on edge during most of the second half. Plus that piano song played during the bigger moments is SO good. Great episode.

Anime of the season so far.

I can't believe no one said it yet, but FATALITY! Flawless Victory.

Does anyone feel bad for Shinichi? As he becomes more of a BA he's slowly losing his humanity, his emotions are turning into pain, sadness, and rage. For him, is strength worth the loss of his humanity?

That punch to the ribcage made up for what happened in this episode, if we could get a whole Sinichi vs parasyte army episode that would be surely amazing

Does this anime continue next season?

Yes it does, thank goodness

I mean, if she really wanted to see couldn't shinichi just have waited that couple hours migi was asleep?

Either way, there was too many death flags for her not to have died, shame really, her outfits are much cuter than muranos.

Jesus woah, what an episode. I really can't add anything to that.

Hey, Merry Christmas everyone

One of the best episodes so far. I really liked Kana in the manga and I really liked her in the anime. 

The moment when shinichi said ''Migi.. Handle the defense'' and those last scenes with the ending song were awesome.

One best girl down. One to go.

Swore so much this episode, spoiled myself looking on the wiki site so i knew it was coming, but fucking fuck I was still pissed. Don't care what people say, I still liked Kana and her dramatic irony plot pushing her towards her death this episode and I was as pissed as Shinichi was right before he killed the parasyte that got Kana. Been a fucking while since I gave so much of a crap about someone dying. Hope Shinichi just becomes a hunter now and takes care of BUSINESS!!!
>> ARTICLE
manga was perfect, and anime just keeps getting better. props to the voice actor of shinji.
>> ARTICLE
God damn, Shinichi, you got off so easy you have no idea!

I can't believe he was so stupid to tell her about her powers. Moreover, I can't believe Migi stopped being so genre-savvy for a second there and actually allowed him to show Kana. She was way too dangerous and a few steps away from becoming a crazy psycho stalking bitch. I swear I could just hear her say "Well, maybe you should finally choose between me and Murano and you better choose carefully or else **I'm going to tell everybody!**. That was seriously the vibe I got from her from day one.

Shinichi should have known at this point that if you happen to have super secret alien powers, you do not tell anyone. Anyone! Because 1) they're gonna betray you or 2) they will be put in danger.

The fact that this manga's already been finished and being adapted just makes the emotional weight of the anime even better. Studio's don't have to rush or guess on character and character traits.

>> ARTICLE
Was it ever explained how Kana could sense parasytes and give off a signal at all? Did she have some parasyte in her or something? It's sad that she died, even though she unfortunately brought it on herself, but I'm still confused as to how she has these powers at all.
>> ARTICLE
And that boys and girls is how you resolve a love triangle. Good guy Madhouse saving us all the drama. I'm gonna miss Miyuki Sawashiro's voice though. 
>> ARTICLE
So many fine sailors were on that ship...
>> ARTICLE
I want this to be a catalyst for Shinichi to start actively fighting the parasites. I am not sure how the relationship with Migi will play out but hopefully it ends the passive conflict between Shinichi and the parasites. I am wanting some all out war. Though, that's probably expecting a little too much. Oh well.
>> ARTICLE
I'm honestly relieved that Kana died to a random Parasyte because I'm pretty sure that when Shinichi told Migi to show Kana his abilities next time they meet, Migi was going to kill her.
>> ARTICLE
I was pleasantly surprised by the Kana-arc.

Initially, I thought she was keen to the dangerous element of parasites, but as we've been shown repeatedly, she went in a completely different direction with what she sensed.

This annoyed me endlessly because it contrasted typical portrayals of teens in fiction (which is polarized to either imbecilic or sagelike)

But... The more I reflected on it, the more it made sense. These guys are teens, a time of angst, hormones, etc.. The roundabout way Kana explored her emotions made sense in a most adorable and pitiable way.

This was a fantastic episode, the way Parasyte portrays human emotion is refreshing in a genre filled with bombastic psychologically bent brats.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi to Kana "I want you to keep your distance, even if you feel the signal" 


Does complete opposite... ****sigh**** 

>> ARTICLE
After double the waiting time, death welcomes us :(.  Sad, but he told her so many times to NOT do the thing.  She does the thing, and whaddayaknow the worst happens, if only she put hormones and teenage love to the side she would've thought with a rational mind...  and now for another extended waiting time.....fuck!
>> ARTICLE
Dang, he could have at least sexed her once before she went. Ah well.
>> ARTICLE
I always figured that Shinichi would end up 'dating' kana so he had a way to detect parasites while migi was asleep.

RIP best girl
>> ARTICLE
RIP in pieces, Kana. You kinda brought that death upon yourself. And people said Yuko was stupid - but she at least had a plan. I feel bad for Mitsuo for having fallen for her.

Shinichi grabbing the parasite's body's heart was badass. Especially preceded by him commanding Migi to take care of defense... Even Migi was surprised.

Next episode is called "Hello, Sadness" - because, you know, there wasn't any sadness up until now. Maybe Shinichi will finally start to feel some sadness again and possibly cry?
>> ARTICLE
Once Next to You starts playing, get ready to go on a feels trip.

Now wasn't the right time for best girl

I'm a little late, but I liked Kana and thought she would detect parasites for Shinichi while Migi was asleep, covering his weakness.

I'm at a point where I don't really want to wait anymore so I have a question or 2 for those who read the manga.   
a.) Where would I have to start the Manga if I wanted to read from the point where we are at?  
b.) is the manga really that bad compared to the anime (read that in some earlier discussion)  
c.) can I still enjoy the anime if I read the 'inferior' manga?
>> ARTICLE
Manga fan here, this material is amongst the top manga of all time, nothing "inferior" about its story or art style in the manga.


a) this episode concludes chapter 31

b) manga is the original. Anime refresh the character design, mordenize the SoL (eg/ introduce mobile phones and internet) and did ~15% trimming for better pacing. The manga is not worse than anime, but in a different flavor.

c) You can enjoy the anime with or without reading the manga. I generally telling people not to read the manga until the series is over, otherwise you will spend unnecessary efforts thinking about difference between the manga and anime where you should enjoy the drama and the underlying story behind scenes.

>> ARTICLE
agree with him ^

The only thing I found difficult about the manga was that it was hard to distinguish some of the characters. Might have just been me though, but I found myself getting a bit confused as to who was who without enough variety in physical appearance of some of the characters.

That said, the manga is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
a.) I'd advise you to read it from the start. It's not that long and you will see some stuff the anime skipped, or did differently.

b.) Not at all. They're different mediums, with their respective strengths and weaknesses, but apart from the modernisation, the adaptation is quite faithful to the original material.

What were the arguments against the manga, if I may ask?

c.) Sure. I read it years ago, then again just before the anime started, and I'm enjoying the anime very much. :)
>> ARTICLE
Damn those last 5 minutes were something else...I think I know why people say its the best show 2014...

God these females in this show are so poorly written, it's pathetic. Glad she's dead in all honesty, creators can't handle love interests well at all. They need to sick to the only thing they've done well so far which is the the dynamic between Shinichi and Migi. Now we just need Murano gone and all will be great.

Her mind's child, Gotoh, lead by Kuroro, hasn't reached his apex yet.

They were given desire to live and sent to fight the strongest species on the Earth. The defeat is almost certain with their numbers. This means that they weren't meant to eradicate humans but change our understanding about our position among other species. Anyway, it's so cruel to use intelligent tools. She was a fail as a tool but she succeeded at being manifestation of the mindful will.

>> ARTICLE
A part of me is screaming that Migi lied about Kana losing too much blood. 

Shinichi took that parasyte down within seconds. It's arguable with Migi's help, Kana could have been saved. However, Migi likely would not have been willing to put in the effort, as he feels no obligation.

>> ARTICLE
It's also an objective risk to migi -- last time he diffused himself through a bloodstream, he couldn't collect himself back together again and now has to sleep the 4hr or w/e.  If he repeats that with Kana, who's in a completely separate body, he'll probably be unconscious half the time if not more, if he even succeeds in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Damnit, I knew that was coming and yet it was still painful.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that was a really solid episode. I suppose I should feel a little bit more sympathetic to Kana's death, but she totally had it coming. 

Overall her death is a pretty good thing. Not only was she a very dangerous character in terms of knowledge and motives, her death also serves as a great catalyst for Shinichi's descent into parasyte aided insanity. It's also been a while since we've had a good death, and although there was some pretty heavy foreshadowing, it's nice that you couldn't see this one episodes before it happened, unlike Shinichi's mom. 

Also, I wouldn't be lying if I said I didn't really like Kana. A bit *too* creepy for my tastes.
>> ARTICLE
predictable death, but I'm glad this show is uncensored so we could see the heart ripping scene
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else think that Parasyte will go the way of Attack on Titan? Praised and hyped to high heaven while airing, then 6 months later no one will really care.

It's fun to watch but it comes off as just an easily digestible action/thriller with some shock factor thrown in. Forgettable when next season's big blockbuster hit starts airing.
>> ARTICLE
we all saw that coming. she was becoming almost a yandere, I started to fucking hate her because she was being reckless and stupid without considering Shinichi's warnings and feelings. what kind of girl loves a guy because she can "feel" him? that's lack of childhood love or something like that. she became obsessed with the idea of belonging to someone, not with Shinichi himself. anyway, now he's gonna goddamn blame himself for ther death. fucking dumbfuck Kana.

I have both negative and positive things to say about this show up until now. 

- The positive is that I like to see the development that Shinichi is undergoing. 

-Migi is still my boy. 

-Music is always entertaining 

- and I love the animation. 

Negative:

 I have been disappointed with the supporting cast. I don't really care much for them. Especially our female cast which has up until now have been two girls whose only ambition have seemed to be a romantic relationship with the main character. They really feel like plot fodder. I want to know more about the supporting cast. They get a lot of screen time but the only  relationship that feel genuine that I can possibly stand to care about is Shinichi and Migi which is definitely the most important relationship so props to them there but other relationships like Shinichi's relationship with his parents, his schoolmates, and other characters that show up often feel shallow and/or undeveloped, leaving much to be desired.   

TLDR; Two main characters get great development but no one else.
>> ARTICLE
The development for Kana leading up to this was worth while. RIP KANA<3
>> ARTICLE
Finally, the OST for the credits is out. It's been stuck in my head for months 
>> ARTICLE
Every fight in this anime is short but amazing, i don't know which i like the most, where migi pulled that dog's hearth, where Shinichi threw a rock from like 300 meters, where that 1 parasyte killed 20+ yakuza, or this episode. Overall this episode kept me on edge, it was kind of unpredictable because if i ware to bet on a character that would last near or till the end it was this girl.

I liked Kana way more than Yuuko but I can't even be mad at the way she died. Now I have no more feels to give for this show and can watch without being too stressed. WOOO I'm so excited for the next episode!!!

I actually was hoping Shinichi would leave Murano for Kana, considering they got together somewhat early, that was a possibility.
>> ARTICLE
Glad the bitch is dead.
>> ARTICLE
As great as this episode is, something I'd remark on is the total lack of direction at the moment. Shinichi's got no real goals, there's nothing happening in the impeding future to anticipate, both Shinichi and the viewers are stuck in a state where they're pretty much just waiting for the potential complete demise of Shinichi's humanity, or for the politician parasites to start killing people on a larger scale. If I had to describe the sorts of feelings I at least sort of have, I'd characterise them primarily with both a feeling of motionlessness and powerlessness. It's like I'm stuck with nothing to do but wait and see what happens. Is that a good thing, because it allows us to better empathise with Shinichi, or is it a bad thing because the scenario should have momentum? I can't say, but that's just how I feel.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that the sense of direction seems to be wavering, but I think it's intended. Shinichi is in a position where he isn't really able to do much except try and protect the people he cares about. It is more so that he has to be on the defensive rather than the offensive like trying to take out the politician or other parasites since Kana is snooping around, but it's too late now :(

You can see the frustration in him as well, his remorse for getting her involved in all this even though it's not really his fault. I think it's a great way to show how human he still really is, losing control of his temper, frustration, grief. He can't see he still has all his human qualities because he is blinded by them.

Considering that the Parasites have achieved political power, I have a feeling that their motives extend beyond that of "feeding grounds".

Shinichi's stuck in a limbo, where he wants to kill all the parasytes but hasn't really committed himself to doing so. Give the show some time to develop Shinichi's character; this show is a 2-cour and doesn't need to be rushed like all the 1-cour shows out there.
>> ARTICLE
I avoid collateral damage to my heart just by assuming everyone's going to die. I'm surprised Murano isn't dead yet, I'm pretty sure they're going to save her for the finale. Shinichi will either:

1) Be able to cry

2) Become a full parasyte because of madness
>> ARTICLE
Weird. I'm still holding out hope that Kana isn't actually gone.  If she is, it would drastically hurt my opinion of the show, for practical reasons.

The show spent a lot of time developing the link between Kana and Shinichi.  Especially in this episode, they greatly expand on the fact that she has a special power where she can detect other parasites and it has become so strong that other parasites can detect her too.

If this goes unexplained, I'll be very disappointed.  I thought the show missed a huge opportunity to justify this power with something like, either she had been the host to a weak parasite...or, even better, because she had spent so much time around Shinichi, the parasites that are flowing through Shinichi's blood had been jumping to Kana as a new host.  Obviously, they would be able to sense Shinichi's signal above all other parasites if that were the case.

That would add to the connection that Kana and Shinichi were developing and give it a bit more depth.

Besides all of the practical reasons, losing Miyuki Sawashiro from the show is devastating for me.  She's one of my main reasons for watching.

Pulling a parasite hair out sounds like a surefire way to get your arms lopped off.
>> ARTICLE
In the manga people pulling hair was depicted as like a joke trend. However, people DO it because they know there are psychopaths causing the mince murder among them. People are starting to suspect each other but can't go full witch hunting mode because they lack the proof and the government is staying calm. It's similar to the zombie prank that people did after the cannibal incident in Miami occurred.

>> ARTICLE
[wow](http://gfycat.com/FailingFixedBarnacle)
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious as to how you did your math, if you don't mind sharing.
>> ARTICLE
Read /u/sistershaniqua's comment on why the folliowong is wrong!

Notice: I'm going to redo the math as I type this to see if I get the same answer.

So, I applied what we're shown in the show to their real-life actual values, and fit them into F = ma. What we see is that Shinichi throws an apple-sized rock hard enough that it passes clean through Hamada with little-to-no resistance, and impacts the concrete wall behind him enough to annihilate a square area at least the size of the rock thrown.

According to [this site](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/concrete-properties-d_1223.html), a regular mix of concrete has a maximum [compressive strength](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressive_strength) of 6000 psi(lbs per square inch). That means that concrete can take at most, 6000 pounds per square inch before it fractures.

Because physics problems are in metric units, I converted that to Newtons/meter^2 ( N/m^2 )

6 000 psi = 41 368 468.952964 N/m^2

With our N/m^2 we have the force exerted over one square meter. Since our hole looks to be the size of the rock thrown, I'm going to assume the rock has a diameter of 10cm. 10 cm is 0.1m, so if I'm making the m in N/m^2 = 0.1, or, in other words, multiplying that **1** by 1/10, I need also multiply 41 368 468.952964 by 1/10.

 41 368 468.952964 x (1/10) = 4 136 846.895 

So there we have our force, **4 136 846.895 N**/0.1m^2

Now that I have F, I need one more variable to solve the equation for acceleration. Luckily, it's an easy one.

Mass, m, counted in kilograms, kg, is the mass of the rock. It's about apple sized, probably heavy, but not too heavy. I *assume* that it's the rough weight of a bottle of water - 500 grams, or 0.5 kg. If that's not a good assumption, please correct me. 

m = 0.5 kg

Okay, there's our equation, where a is acceleration: 

4 136 846.895 N = 0.5 kg x a

Dividing the right side of the equation leaves us with *a*, and dividing the left by 0.5 leaves us with 8 273 693.79. The equation now looks like this:

8 273 693.79 = a

*a* is measured in m/s^2

Here's another equation, which is how we figure out the velocity of the rock.

a = delta*v*/time = vfinal - vinitial / time

So in this equation:

a = 8 273 693.79 m/s^2

vinitial = 0 m/s (you don't count initial velocity until the object is fully begins it's movement)

time = the amount of time between Shinichi letting go of the rock until it's impact with the wall. My count was 3.5 seconds.

8 273 693.79 = vfinal - 0 / 3.5 or simply vfinal / 3.5

To solve for vfinal, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3.5.

Simply put, we get a ridiculous answer.

vfinal, the velocity of the rock as it touches the concrete wall, is 28 957 928 m/s.

Because that's fucking ridiculous, I think my math is suspect. To put that velocity in perspective, that's about 1000 times faster than the Earth rotates around the sun.

Corrections are welcome!

If you know distance and time thats all you need. Distance = 300m, time = 3s, v = 100m/s or about 200mph. Twice as fast as a major league baseball (4 times the energy).
>> ARTICLE
Your calculation is wrong.

the a = 8 273 693.79 m/s^2 you found is actually the **deceleration** of the rock after it hits the wall. It depends on both the initial speed of the rock before the impact, as well as the deceleration time. Force = impulse/time.

You can't multiply this acceleration by the travelling time of the rock to find its "initial speed", since obviously the rock is not accelerating at all during the 3.5 seconds after it leaves Shinichi's hand.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the correction, then :)
>> ARTICLE
We got the distance (300 meters i think) and the time that it took from throw to impact, so it's an easy calculation (V=D/T)

It travels the entire distance in a little over 4 seconds (I'm going to say 3.5 due to cuts in the scene.)

300 meters / 3.5 seconds = 85.7 Meters Per second. or 308 Kilometers per Hour

/u/anangrywom6at is very wrong by an order of magnitude.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think either of you have gotten it right so far. Well, /u/Echo104b, has a correct velocity by the information presented in the show. However, the rock would be moving too slowly to impact the concrete if the above's velocity is used. Therefore, the time that the show presents must be inaccurate. 

I'm going to take a different approach and work the situation through energy.

As before (kind of, /u/anangrywom6at forgot to use area):

4.137 * 10^7 N/m^2 * (pi * .1^2 ) m^2 = 1.2997 * 10^6 N = F

I am going to estimate that the material was compressed .1 m (in other words, the hole was .1 m deep). The above F is both the force of the impact and the force that is stopping the rock. F would probably increase the more the wall is compressed, but then this would start to tread into calculus territory. Assuming the force is applied evenly throughout the compression, we can calculate the work it takes to stop the projectile by:

W = F * d

W = (1.2997 * 10^6 N) * (.1 m)

W = 1.2997 * 10^5 J

This is the energy exerted by the wall's compression on the rock to bring it to a halt. It will also be equal by conservation of energy to the initial kinectic energy of the rock after it is released from Shinichi's hand. 

W = KE = .5mv^2

1.2997 * 10^5 J = .5 (.5 kg) v^2

v = 721 m/s


For kicks, the time were the anime realistic should have been:

x = vt

300 m = (721 m/s)t

t = .41 s

^^This ^^is ^^technically ^^inaccurate ^^as ^^velocity ^^here ^^is ^^not ^^the ^^horizontal ^^velocity, ^^but ^^I ^^am ^^imagining ^^that ^^the ^^vertical ^^drop ^^due ^^to ^^gravity ^^and ^^the ^^height ^^difference ^^are ^^small ^^enough ^^that ^^it ^^would ^^not ^^matter ^^too ^^much.

For comparison, this is about twice the speed of a bullet. It may not be as fast as /u/anangrywom6at's answer (Shinichi cannot, in fact, throw a projectile at one tenth the speed of light), but I'd say it's still damn impressive. My answer is still probably incorrect, if not from method, then from the fact that we have all ignored that the rock flies through a human body on its trajectory. I am perfectly happy, however, to go my life without knowing force required to punch cleanly through a human chest. Some physics questions do not need answers.

I feel like they would actually be fairly easy to weaponize.  They're intelligent and want to survive.  It's probably easier to cooperate with the government than oppose it, all things considered.

Their relationship is more complex than those in most romance anime I've seen.

I know, I wish more romance stories did this kind of shit. So sick of tsundere's and moe-shit for every single show now. Shinichi is now a badass and Murano liked him from the get-go. Their relationship had rocky turns but it's not typical at all, I love this show.

Hell, look at Hunter x Hunter's Chimera Ant arc. That has the best romance story I've seen in anime, and it's a freaking battle shounen. It's weird that romance anime can learn a thing or two from series that are don't even have romance listed as a subgenre. 
>> ARTICLE
Chimera ant was also excellent. I think the problem is genres like romances, slice of life and harems are just too formulaic now. You can pick out a romance anime and guess most of the plot based on the setting. To make it even worse people bitch when they don't have an obvious ending. 

Basically it's more than learning, it's just they know the shit that sells.

Parasyte is easily one of my favorites. The mid-90's manga itself was great but seeing it in modern animation is absolutely delightful. Shinichi's back story reminds me so much of Spider-Man but in the sense that his power is more similar to the villain [Carnage](http://imgur.com/8HiJiLA). There are actually so many similarities we can draw from Shinichi and Spidey but that's for another time...

In any case, this episode was awesome. I expect to see this anime rise in popularity since Shinichi and Migi are so bad ass together.

My friends and I decided that it was Spiderman crossed with Midori Days if written by H.P. Lovecraft... and like really well written.

how very cold and analytical...mind if I pull one of your hairs out?

Likely how it would have played out had she not had the paint thinner is something like:

*Parasyte kills Glasses Girl*

*Shinichi/Migi kill Parasyte*

So in this case actually probably not.

Yeah but this prompted the government to finally do something about them, potentially saving future lives.

I love this whole chain re:causalty. No wonder Migi reminds Shinichi "blame" is a ultimately random human concept.

Glasses girl's thought process has been cut from the manga, so nobody was able to understand what she was thinking, and just called her stupid.

On top of my head.. I think this episode concludes volume 3.

This anime is an excellent example of quality adaptation meanwhile not directly replacing the manga itself: quite a lot of background story (say 15% of entire story) has been trimmed. You will still enjoy and learn new stuff in manga after you watched the anime.

My recommendation is to finish the anime before picking up the manga.

Nah, not a day. I doubt that the school reopened just after a few days. They probably spread the information right after the incident and I guess the school reopened a few weeks later or so. So there was probably enough time to make this hair pull thing "go viral".

There was a time jump, they just didn't do a great job of showing it. They probably had a couple weeks (still bad for suspension of disbelief, but at least plausible).

Also I really doubt she bought it entirely... but I'd also assume that she's kind of in denial that there is something serious going on with him so she chooses to believe it. That was my take.

It turns out Yuko (glasses girl) is the kind of fool that is too dumb to die, though her actions indirectly killed 17 people.

Also, this new way of greeting can lead to two non-exclusive consequences:

1. Parasytes become recluses because they don't want to greet anybody. In this scenario, a human could develop antisocial behaviour. If the parasystes are similar to humans, they may become binge eaters or develop other kinds of antisocial behaviour.

2. So you greeted a parasyte. Great! What do you do know? Do you happen to have thinner? No? If you are not in a public place, you are dead then. Also, if parasytes go bald because of this I don't see people greeting them by removing their eyebrows or noise hair.
>> ARTICLE
Some speculation: In previous episode Migi told, that it can order parts of it's body something before separation. Parasytes could possibly order hairs to remain in a hair form and just die. I can bet, that somebody from government officials at the conference was actually a parasyte. 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't he say that the part of the body it separates has to be a sizable piece for it to maintain the orders? The smaller the piece, the harder it is to know what to do? A hair would barely have enough sentient cells for it to remember what to do so wouldn't it wriggle before dying like it's been said?

>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure she knows that something is up with him but she still trusts him.
>> ARTICLE
I dont know and at this point im too afraid to ask!!
>> ARTICLE
It's up to how you guys interpreted at this stage...
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure that's her thought process.

Again, Parasyte proving to be the best of the season so far.

First, they explained how Shinichi survived really well. Now, it's how they morph. I love how they explain these things plausibly and logically.

I wonder if Shinichi gets affected by the "hair-removal" method though. If so, he's in trouble.
>> ARTICLE
I would still say that Fate/Stay Night is the best but if it keeps these kinds of episodes up, I'll be hard pressed to disagree with you again. 
>> ARTICLE
There are too many good shows this season to pick a best.  Parasyte is my personal favorite though.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man. I'm right there with ya. Your Lie in April, Parasyte, Fate/Stay Night UBW, Rage of Bahamut, Grisaia, Inou-Battle, Log Horizon S2, Amagi Brilliant Park. So much good. 
>> ARTICLE
Legend of Korra may not be considered anime. But it takes the cake this season when it comes to animated shows
>> ARTICLE
It is very objectionable though. See [here](https://i.imgur.com/DEy3eeo.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
hahaha
>> ARTICLE
For sure, I have never been so profoundly sad as I am now, knowing we wont get an animated show as well done as Korra for... years. No more Avatar, who in America is going to try and make something look as freaking awesome as Korra?
>> ARTICLE
How good is the animation? Like is Ufotable level?  Cause I've refused to watch it until its completed which by the sound of it, it has finished. So I got a good wkend coming
>> ARTICLE
Nah not over yet, couple more weeks left. I'd say it is Ufotable level, though it is different. Less gloss and shine, more painted look. I think it is easily the best action animation out there.
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely not Ufotable level in my opinion, but I think it's very well animated, and even the story of the latest 2 season (1.5 technically) is great!
>> ARTICLE
It's nearly finished - last three episodes still remain. The animation is very high quality, but that's to be expected from Western standards: the higher framerate and attention to detailed body movements (lip-movements, for instance) is quite distinct from Japanese animation, which relies more on stills; unless it's Ufotable's fight scenes, but those are fueled by Unlimited Budget.

Either way, it's definitely worth a watch. If you watch a season a week, you should be right on time for the finale.
>> ARTICLE
I've only watched through episode 5 of the 2nd season looks like I'll have a lot to marathon when winter comes.
>> ARTICLE
Seasons 3 and 4 so far have widely been considered great and much less polarizing than the earlier seasons too, so you're in for a good watch.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed season 1 but then got a little put off by the second season. Pretty hyped to see what happens in the later arcs.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that was the general sentiment for most people I think.  

I'm just glad others and I weren't crazy in thinking LoK could set itself to a much higher standard, and I think they've been able to pretty much do just that since then.
>> ARTICLE
I love Korra and last weeks episode was great. I'm still waiting for "Poop" to go down though. :P

Psycho-Pass 2?

And Cross Ange!
>> ARTICLE
Ooh. I haven't seen Cross Ange. I've heard good things though.

I was willing to die on the hill defending it for the first few episodes, then by episode 6/7 all the detractors had pretty much converted. And this week's episode was amazeballs.

You are now tagged as Cross Ange Prophet. You will either be a Heretic or a Prophet. When I watch I will decide.

Sorry i cant see what you wrote, my eyes just blew up. (Also F/SN UBW has one of the best fictional storylines ive ever seen)
>> ARTICLE
So for everyone familiar with the VN route, Fate/Stay Night is awesome, though I question whether I would call it best of the season, but for anyone watching the anime as their first exposure, I can only imagine they've found it pretty boring. There have been some flashy fights, and some infodumping, but so far only one thing of consequence has happened, and it was just this last episode.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, to be honest, I'm watching it and just hoping that it's just setting things up to be amazing in later episodes.  I've watched Fate/Zero (I know, I know, don't tell me I watched them in the wrong order) and I liked that a lot better than Stay Night so far.
>> ARTICLE
Thankfully, everyone can enjoy them both.
>> ARTICLE
ARE YOU INSANE?!
>> ARTICLE
A little, sure. It takes a maverick to watch two different shows at two different times.
>> ARTICLE
But Saber is.
>> ARTICLE
Come on. there aren't even twintails or a ridiculous plotline!

But seriously, Your Lie in April and Nanatsu no Taizai are definitely my faves this season. Parasyte is extremely good, but I would not place it as the best.
>> ARTICLE
Even if they found out Shinichi was infected, I'm sure they'd try to question him first.  Worst comes to worst he'll start fighting other parasites with the police.
>> ARTICLE
Since most parasites inhabit the heads of most victims the hair pull method will identify they. Shinichi should be safe as his parasite is in his hand leaving his head relatively human. 
>> ARTICLE
It actually shouldn't really. Since he now also has migi's cells across his whole body (and if they are 'joined') it should cause the same effect. Even though migi is only in his right hand, his cells are not anymore. 
>> ARTICLE
It's questionable how far migi's cells have permeated throughout Shinichi's body.  Also it's not clear how much material it would take for that squirming effect to work.
>> ARTICLE
As long as they don't rip out his hand-hair...
>> ARTICLE
Or start clipping his nails...
>> ARTICLE
I would imagine that migi has control over how his hand looks so it should always look like it's been cut recently.

Am I the only one that really appreciates how they do the next episode preview? I really like how subtle the preview is.
>> ARTICLE
Man the opening gets me so HYPE every time
>> ARTICLE
I can't even describe how much I absolutely love the soundtrack, it's out of this world!

This episode was pretty fucking good, I didn't expect glasses girl [/s]("to survive") but we don't know what's going to happen there. Shinishi is an amazing MC, every scene with him is just amazing! The dramatic feeling in this episode was stunning, the scenes with the blood and the parasyte was brilliant.

The next episodes name is "the blue bird" I don't have a clue what to expect for that episode, but I know that I will love it!
>> ARTICLE
[How does this work?! running with your face covered](http://i.imgur.com/4DSIoEh.png)

I would imagine she is just running away from the massacre and not caring which direction she is heading, anywhere but there is better atm.
>> ARTICLE
she can probably see through her fingers

>> ARTICLE
You can't blame her, I bet she witnessed the massacre.
>> ARTICLE
So basically the goverment finally made a move. I would expect shinichi to fight killer B , but that rock throw was awesome. However doesnt Muranoo thinks its weird to jump from that high and be like "No big deal"?

My guess is next episode someone will pull his hair or something and find out. I cant wait to see the reaction to that!!

Another week boys and girls, another hard week to wait for. 
>> ARTICLE
He's human so his hair would test negative. They'd have to pull hair from his right arm/Migi for it to test positive.
>> ARTICLE
And we all thought glasses girl would get herself killed. It was kind of like how a drunk driver rarely kills themselves in a wreck...
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit that rock throw! I'm glad Shinichi showed a bit more humanity in this ep. I was getting a little worried about him completely losing it  
I love that everything is logical and explained well, this show is so fucking good.  
I'm probably alone in this but I miss Shinichi's old hairstyle.
>> ARTICLE
I was expecting a full-blown duel this week and everything to be forced out into the public, but I can't say I'm disappointed with what we got. It's a nice change of pace to not have a crazy cliffhanger this week, too.
>> ARTICLE
I found the first half of this episode incredibly frustrating to watch. Mainly because it seemed so unbelievable on so many levels.

1. Why was Shinichi walking so believably slow to every destination? He wasn't even walking at a brisk pace, and he knew his friend was in danger.

2. Good for glasses girl for avoiding all those death flags - however why didn't she say anything, nor any of the students who witnessed any of the murders? I'm sure some sort of rumors would have sprouted by then.

3. I felt as though this time Shinichi's and Migi's conversations did not flow that naturally and seemed very slow, while they were trying to push some obvious points onto us.

4. Pull the fire alarm if you want to evacuate the school! Also I love how cops are rendered useless in almost every show haha.

However, I still enjoyed this episode and love the anime. The rock snipe was pretty hype, and I enjoyed how they figured out a method of identifying potential parasytes. Until next week 
>> ARTICLE
I had similar feelings but let's attempt to evaluate those issues:

> Why was Shinichi walking so believably slow to every destination? He wasn't even walking at a brisk pace, and he knew his friend was in danger.

He wasn't rushing at first, maybe because he's more calm after his change and was trying to be less suspicious or maybe because migi said he was still attempting to pinpoint his location. Later when he finds out not everyone evacuated safely and shit hits the fan completely he just runs in anyway...

> Good for glasses girl for avoiding all those death flags - however why didn't she say anything, nor any of the students who witnessed any of the murders? I'm sure some sort of rumors would have sprouted by then.

They'be been visited by mib's just like Shinichi's dad for sure.

> Pull the fire alarm if you want to evacuate the school! Also I love how cops are rendered useless in almost every show haha.

Now this may seem weird but their reaction was depicted right. In case of countries without violent incidents at schools people are not accustomed to emergencies and just as we see in this episode students are slowly walking out of school, not taking situation seriously and teachers are confused and not really prepared to handle the situation. Source: me, I've seen enough 'fake' alarms back at my school, it looks exactly like this even when people are not sure whether it's just a drill or a serious sitation.

About cops, well that's what happens when you try to bite you can't chew. They haven't been told and were not prepared, hence REKT :D

Point 3 I sort of agree, this episode is a bit slower paced.
>> ARTICLE
Having been in several iffy situations you would be shocked at how people act when they are frightened.

I actually didn't see much wrong with how the students acted when shit hit the fan.
>> ARTICLE
Furuya ain't got nothing on Izumi. Idk if its just me or does Migi speak in less of a commanding tone now and in a more cooperative tone. As if Migi and Izumi are on the same wavelength..
>> ARTICLE
Love how they came up with how to identify parasites.  No doubt based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsST9EKTGic) scene.  Spoilers for The Thing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad that Shinichi is badass, but not too badass. (Not enough to make him a jerk, just enough to get the job done)

Also, lol Japanese government. When I read the word 'fad' I immediately thought of Twintails and whether an Elemelian would show up.

poor guy hasnt got much hair to pull out
>> ARTICLE
I love how the fear of the students and the terror felt real. It wasn't overdramatized or played off as nothing, just perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi nearly did a 360 no scope across the map. 
>> ARTICLE
How exactly did the goverment spread the news about pulling hair?
>> ARTICLE
they probably released some huge publicity thing involving idols, or huge public icons. think of it as though Canada and the US got a bunch of popular bands, internet famous people, and public figures to take part in a video or several videos where they pull out each others hair as a greeting. some could be for a comedic effect, some could be dead serious, it could even be a shampoo commercial. a guy pulls out a few of her hairs and smells them saying "you smell amazing" etc. etc. this is a bad example but should give you a general idea of how it caught on so fast
>> ARTICLE
But how would people know to examine the hair and report it, if need be?
>> ARTICLE
well, I guess the general idea is that eventually, after everyone pulling your hair and having it fizzle people avoid you. also is someone gets taken over by a late parasyte, when their hair didn't fizzle before it would know and you would know something is different. It will most likely result in a lot of deaths where the person asks questions as to why their hair is fizzling and the parasyte doesn't know what to say so it kills them to keep them quiet. However this works for the government as well because you can't cover up impulse killings like that and they will eventually be caught
>> ARTICLE
Using the citizens as bait? I like your style, Japan.
>> ARTICLE
They could also release a public announcement that a new highly contagious and life threatening disease is going around that causes your hairs to fizzle when removed from your head. This would cause citizens to report a parasyte. however it would most likely have the same effect of the parasyte killing them to keep them quiet

Yeaaaah I've been waiting for this fight for a long time. Shinichi's school is so screwed cause of him lol Killer A and killer B now.

Also I know it's a significant question, but I think they're beating the 'are you human? What does it mean to be human?' question to death here.

Still a cool ep this week though.

Aww, what a sweet episode. Everyone's all happy and playing games. A new fad is introduced and everyone loves it. What a time to be alive. 

So tense during this episode. Glad that's over with. But wow, that change in tone. One minute you're like "this thing is gonna kill us all" and then you say "yeah, we'll be fine."

Man what a great anime holy fuck this episode was spot on everything was good.

Sure, adrenaline helps you jump from the 3rd floor and remain unscathed X'D Great thing Murano was in too much of a shock to bother about that.

Ah Shinichi is back on track, got his girl back, Shimada dies, and the police can now distinguish parasytes from humans, this episode had all good things going for it ^^^^^minus ^^^^^17 ^^^^^dead
>> ARTICLE
The first mistake in this anime that i noticed was the trace of blood below Shinichi's shoes when he stoop on it, had he walk far enough to not leaving behind any spill of blood?

Nonetheless, this episode was intense as fu..
>> ARTICLE
the whole time I was waiting for Sinchi to kill the parasite, it took him soo long. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess luck was really on her side. She went looking for death and paint thinner saved her life. Hope she learned from her mistake.
>> ARTICLE
The anime definitely does the manga justice! I love it!
>> ARTICLE
This episode was exceptionally awesome, it had me nervous the whole time about if his enemy was going to kill Murano or if he was going to get away.  Haven't been this absorbed by a show for quite some time (although Shigatsu comes close), this stuff is crazy good.
>> ARTICLE
I have to say so far Madhouse are doing a great job with this adaptation. The pacing is good, the character designs are far more pleasing to the eyes and nothing all too drastic has been changed yet compared to the original manga.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, this show just continues to impress. It's probably one of if not *the* best thriller that I've seen. I thought the Murano scare was a good way to inject some tension, since it doesn't really feel like anything will happen to Shinichi. Speaking of Shinichi, he had kind of been pissing me off recently with his anger and outbursts, but naturally AOTS Parasyte solves it immediately with this episode. I definitely like to nitpick shows, but I'm having a hard time finding any major flaws with this one.
>> ARTICLE
If I wanted to nitpick I feel like the music use early on was rather poorly done (even then that has gotten better).
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know the name of the song wich is playing at the previews

Let Me Hear by Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas

I don't mean the opening, i mean the song at the very end of the episodes, the last 10 seconds, with this dark music and vocals

oh, my mistake! Hmm... i don't know, i thought it could have been a soundtrack.

I ended up reading a few chapters ahead a little while ago and was so excited to see the rock throwing scene actually animated and it was just as awesome as I was hoping. Another great episode!

Would a school really be back in session any time soon after that?
>> ARTICLE
Reading the manga this chapter seemed a lot more badass then I thought it would be, I knew it was a bad idea to read they 90s shit lmao
>> ARTICLE
I see a lot of comments about Shinichi changing because of Migi, nobody's seemed to address the reverse. Migi seems to be becoming more human by the episode. Migi knew what Shinichi would've done to the dog even though Shinichi had become more like Migi. Migi questions Shinichi's actions less and makes more analyses like "So this is what it means to be human."

It's possible to just chalk that up to Migi becoming acquainted with or learning more about Shinichi; however, I like to think that's becoming influenced by his host the same way Shinichi is influenced by him.
>> ARTICLE
Izumi carrying Murano bridal-style like a boss! 
>> ARTICLE
Manga readers might have noticed a very subtle fore-shadowing in this episode. Parasytes are portrayed to be extremely irritated when they got any sort of poison inside their body. This is an important piece of information that is relevant to the fight at the end of the show. 

I'm just saying if you didn't notice that til now.
>> ARTICLE
The hair pulling thing seems dumb. 

The parasyte is just gonna slice you in half if you're close enough to pull out a hair. 

Although I guess it would blow their disguise. 

Also: cops/Feds don't even ask the question of how this big hole got in the parasyte dudes chest? (And the wall behind him)
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe that this is an anime adaptation from a manga that is from the late 1980s.. HOW CAN I MISSED SOMETHING AS AMAZING AS THIS?

Oh man. That was an episode. Shinichi moved annoyingly slowly at the beginning in terms of tracking down Shimada. I'm glad Yuuko was okay... I guess the tree cushioned her fall. I was worried for both her and Murano this episode...

Definitely interested to see where the story takes us next. I'm guessing we'll see more of Kana and maybe "Tamiya Ryoko".

What's with all the forwards, and some backs, wearing the scrum pack? Why are they practise scrumming in jackets?! How do you grab properly on those jackets? Why are there no balls put in if they are doing practise on two packs? Why don't you take off the scrum cap when getting off the pitch? Who plays rugby in pants?

What is this

I associate that they are showing more of rugby, but I wonder if the animators know what it is like. Perhaps the standard of practise in Japan is that different? Was it like this in the manga as well?
>> ARTICLE
That rock throw was so hot

>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong i love this anime but wasn't it a bit stupid that at then when it was revealed that pulling out a strand or hair can identify a  parasite it just so happened that pulling out a strand of hair is how everyone is going to greet each other from now on ...like come on, BUT HOW ABOUT DAT ROCK THROW.

This anime just officially won at everything for me this season. Up to this point it was on top in character writing and storytelling, but after this episode hype factor just went through the roof. Depending on how well it progresses this may end up being one of my favorites of all time.

A high school massacre?. we seinen now. 
>> ARTICLE
It *was* seinen
>> ARTICLE
So who thinks that the parasyte identification test is a lie? I somehow feel like it's something that was brought up to keep the government contained since Migi talked about being able to issue commands if he split off parts of himself (they were just less intelligent on their own).
>> ARTICLE
yes but when the hair is too small it does not follow commands, recall when migi fused himself with sinchi. Parts of migi body were soo small when diffused into sin chi's blood stream they couldn't follow their objective. Also if some one pulls the parasites hair off spontaneously they wont have enough time to issue a command.
>> ARTICLE
You know, I initially came into this season thinking "Fate's going to be the best this season, I know it." The first episode came out, and I was certain.

But now, after Parasyte, I have to change that statement. Even though I've been pumped for FS/N since the announcement, Parasyte has blown me away. I never really expected to enjoy this series so much, and now I cannot wait for the next episode.

Parasyte is AotS and possibly AotY for me. I've been tempted so many times to read the manga, but I think I'm going to resist until the anime finishes.
>> ARTICLE
MC should dress up as a superhero so he can try to enter crime scenes. 

Also, I'm thinking shinichi will probably eventually join some sort of government task force filled with parasyte users to hunt down parasytes.

This will really get exciting if the government is capable.

The hair pulling becoming a fad is so clever! Love this show

I loved it when Migi said "You're saying weird things again," and also "So this is what humans are."

By now it's my favorite show of the season.

Before the anime was even announced I kept hearing about what a great manga series it was... I was just about to pull the trigger on the first few volumes on Amazon when the Anime adaption was announced & I decided to wait... I both regret and love that decision now... Is episode 11 out yet? Haha!

There's a fucking killer in your school massacring your friends. Get a move on dammit! Murano, why the fuck did you jump into Shinichi's arm. And those guys!

You expect more when you're openly criticizing Reddit's favorite show? Your comment honestly looks like trolling.

Several of your points were addresses elsewhere in the thread, though, might wanna check them out.
>> ARTICLE
Right, the circlejerk lives on. And why would I be trolling? Any comment not praising the greatness of the show is trolling? I'm honestly trying to express my feelings after watching the first half of today's episode and it's not easy when you're seething in rage and can't even form words. Why am I so angry? Because this show has let me down. You'd never hear me say something like this if, for example, Twintails did something like this. But when a good show throws everything away and turns to utter shit in the span of 15 minutes, you can't expect me to just ignore everything and keep pretending it's the best. I'll check out the other comments but I don't think there's anything to explain how stupid today's episode was. All you can do is make excuses.

I responded that way not because he was criticizing the show but rather he was throwing a fit. He thought that we cared whether he was going insane or that we gave a shit that he's leaving.

Shinichi, I love you, I really do, but that is definitely a dude in a tracksuit and not your mom...???

Yeah, it occurred to me that Shinichi/Migi don't know about her relocation issues.

But the idea of him flying in raging about his mom to some random parasite just going about its day is really hilarious to me. 
>> ARTICLE
She has problems relocating to males, and relocating is extremely risky, so unless she was nearly dead its highly unlikely, i suspect it to be another parasite and her mother creeping in to the hospital from the other side
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi and Migi don't know that.
>> ARTICLE
Good point, but they also don't know for sure that relocation is safe in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Already been said she can't handle being in a mans body
>> ARTICLE
I though parasytes could change their faces if they wanted.
>> ARTICLE
Also keep in mind that Migi never state that he able to detect specific parasyte. He just able to sense existence of parasyte in general.
>> ARTICLE
It's actually not the existence but the special brain waves that the parasytes exhibit. Shinichi is not a parasyte but he is also starting to exhibit a different brain wave, which is why Ryoko held back on killing him. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, they can change the area were they are in, but "she" can't change the whole body into a guy. But Shinichi probably knows at this point that it is possible for them to switch the host, because obviously his mother was beheaded and not just taken over. 
>> ARTICLE
But it seems as though they can't change into hosts of different sexes, right?
>> ARTICLE
We know that but Shinichi doesn't.
>> ARTICLE
* No asspulls just to keep Shinichi alive and instead, explained it thoroughly and did it logically. That is amazing. Nice job, Migi.

* The [badassery](http://i.imgur.com/m7lmWGf.png) starts now.

* Migi has undergone changes. Shinichi is now in a riskier spot as Migi isn't available at all times anymore.

* Guess there's quite a few modifications to his physical abilities aswell. This makes him capable of handling himself even with Migi asleep. 

Opinions :

The way they handled Shinichi's survival was amazing. It was very well thought out and executed perfectly. The 180 degree turn of Shinichi's character is great aswell. He's shaping up to be one of my favorite characters in anime. I hate how he's being really reckless right now but that's understandable as he just lost his mother.

Overall, great episode. The ED still hits hard due to the events of the previous episodes. 


>> ARTICLE
>The way they handled ~~Shinichi's~~ Migi's survival was amazing.

fixed that for you ;)
>> ARTICLE
Very well said, agree with all of that.

I was going into this thinking "okay, so how are you gonna fix this mess? Asspull incoming?"

And instead I've gotten one of my favorite sequences...ever? Don't wanna oversell it but it was amazing. When Migi fed Shinichi sugar water I had a huge smile on my face.

>> ARTICLE
I like how Madhouse redesigned his character to have glasses at the beginning, it made his "transformation" even more dramatic and gritty when he took them off.
>> ARTICLE
[trope!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlassesComeOff)
>> ARTICLE
Though it does have a rational explanation given that his entire body is enhanced now...he probably can't even wear his glasses anymore.
>> ARTICLE
...360? So he's exactly the same? 

I really like his character too. But I have to says the recklessness is something I also like. There's so much energy and rage in it. It's quite nice. At the same time, I don't feel he's completely changed either. He's always had those idealistic views, and that desire to do something. It's just now that he's doing more about it. 

As for his new superpowers, I'm guessing when Migi repaired Shinichi's body and recruited his other cells to help, they might've been affected by Migi's abilities. Hence the super speed and super jump. 

Also, the new girl is quite sweet too. Hopefully we see more of her and she's not killed off by the end of this arc.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for pointing that out. Kind of drowsy since it is 11 pm here and I haven't gotten much sleep lately due to college entrance exams. 

His recklessness is definitely a positive thing. It's the most realistic change. Noone will stay sane after seeing their mother turn into a monster and attempt to kill them. As a viewer though, you know he's not thinking things properly so you get that feeling of hatred to his actions.
>> ARTICLE
No prob. Yay for entrance exams. Those are years past for me already. The college part is much much harder. 

Get sleep, keep calm, and watch Anime. Keys to success yo. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn, Migi just gave Shinichi a +20 to all stats buff.

I'm kinda surprised his dad said nothing about his glasses, but I guess he is shaken up quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
His dad did mentioned that Shinichi did not look so well... Also the anime did not explicitly mention that Shinichi has been lying in his blood for 3 days.
>> ARTICLE
that one they didnt specifically say the date but you could pretty much guess, the other friends where talking about him being gonne and they said days which meant it was at least 2.

but yeah it could be more
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, with the missed calls, day/night cycles, and him looking severely malnourished upon waking up, I think it was safe to assume he was lying there for days.
>> ARTICLE
i figured migi forcing his body to regen so fast only subsisting on sugar water caused that more than anything.
>> ARTICLE

I want them to end up becoming dependent parts of one another, the same way that Migi was dependent on Shinichi, I want Shinichi to be dependent on Migi's life.

Augmenting the alien characteristics in it's human part, and creating the humanizing traits in Migi, therefore fusing into the ultimate bro bond.

The anime is looking very promising, I hope the show keeps this coming.
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone think of Spiderman when Shinichi realized he didn't need the glasses, or was that just me?

Either way, I originally thought it was a huge mistake to change his character designs so much from the manga, but now I think it was the correct decision. The contrast between his looks before and now make that symbolism of "maturity" that much better.

I just hope Maki-chan doesn't...you know, collateral damage.

EDIT: Grammar. Jesus, I swear it was the parasyte on my right hand that was typing the words.
>> ARTICLE
I think the dad is in more danger if the parasyte, Shinichi went after, wasn't the right one.
>> ARTICLE
It's kinda of a cliche.  [](/s "Homura") did the same thing in [](/s "Madoka") (though she conciously fixed her eyes with her powers).
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of a fan of little cliches that make a character badass. I don't think that the word should have such a negative stigma around it personally. Plot cliches can be frustrating, but I think little cliches like this can make a character very interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't trying to be negative.  It's common because it's extremely useful in getting a point across succinctly. Just like how killing off a parent is a good way to give the MC some motivation.
>> ARTICLE
And that is why you never want to be a parent in a Disney Movie.

That maki girl is seriously wants that D. He needs to hit it and quit it before she dies

I feel like he's going to have to make the decision of killing her if she runs and sees him.

wtf isn't she like 10
>> ARTICLE
what's your point? (   )
>> ARTICLE
She asked if Shinichi had a girlfriend, so I assume that she's a similar age or at least the age different isn't taboo.
>> ARTICLE
In the manga Maki's a middle schooler, so 12-14.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it's said she's a 3rd year middleschooler, so 14 or 15 is most likely.
>> ARTICLE
Ejaculate evacuate 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I got a huge Spiderman vibe from that, plus the generally enhanced physical abilities thing. I'm really hoping Maki makes it through too. I'll be pretty sad if she dies.
>> ARTICLE
My spidey senses are still tingling.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sad that they took out the small, but nice parts of his interactions with Maki-chan. On the boat, he stopped her from being caught because she was skipping school. Then her family was talking about how Shinichi looked like Yakuza or the son of an important figure and he's protecting his dad. Also the interaction of her family teasing her for liking him. They also took out how she saw his scar when she lifted his shirt because he talked about the beach and she was wondering if he wanted a tan. 

Those tiny things made me like Maki-chan being in this part. It was great. Oh well. They animated everything else very well. I didn't like the glasses at first for a character change, but now that he doesn't need them and his actual personality is a little more forward, it was a great choice to show contrast. 
>> ARTICLE

spoilers man
>> ARTICLE
damn really wanted to see those scenes:( well nevertheless still a great episode
>> ARTICLE
Well, from what I saw with people's calculations it would have taken a bit over 30 episodes to cover the manga and they only have 26. I guess this is the part that they're sacrificing. I hope this means certain other parts will get completely fleshed out.
>> ARTICLE
Being a manga reader, I'm constantly bothered by stuff outside of story itself. The pacing is one.

I'm quite happy they skips certain scenes like the lion scene or interactions in this episode and make up the time for later on.

Despite Mad House is generally covering 3 chapters a episode, there are really ~75% of manga contents while rest been trimmed away. There are way better side scenes towards the end and I really REALLY hope they gets to cover them. Eg/ [manga spoiler](/s "male changing room scene, sex scene, mafia experiment scene etc.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but in this case they kind of made it so that Maki-chan is awkwardly there. I mean she is for some reason really helpful to Shinichi despite sitting next to him for a ferry ride in which he barely spoke to her. Then she continues to interact with him and seem to like him for no apparent reason. At least in the small interactions with her from the manga we can see somewhat why. If they didn't want to show her developed even a little, they might as well put a bunch of random people that he could have asked. Or just not show it at all. 

Eg/ Shinichi finds the hospital himself and shows up there. He doesn't need to be shown there by someone so why even have her in the episode if they aren't gonna develop her even a little. He could've just run in the direction of the parasyte signal and jumped around any obstacles. He didn't need to ask anyone, so why is she there if they aren't gonna develop her. Things like this just bother me. Either have her there and show why she's being helpful, or don't. She just seems there for no apparent reason and likes him for no apparent reason.
>> ARTICLE
Would I be able to jump into the manga just to read that part, then back to the anime? And if I could, what chapter is it?

Thanks a lot! The last time I read Parasyte was years ago, so I don't remember a lot of these little details. Now to try to stop at chapter 14...

Well damnit. I may or may not have now read most of series after being linked to this page... 
>> ARTICLE
I was really hoping to see the part where the teacher caught Maki-chan and her teacher catches her skipping school. Then the teacher also confronts Shinichi but gets scared by Shinichi's killing intent.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, It couldn't fit in my head how can anyone be so helpful to a stranger who you just met in a boat, she even took him to the hospital and it was already dark... now this reliefs my mind. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I liked Maki a lot and they kind of just throw her into this episode. Why even have her in the boat scene if they're going to skip over Shinichi sticking up for her. That scene shows her out-going character a lot when she makes him hide the things she bought at the shops instead of going to school. If I hadn't read the manga, I would be wondering why she bothered to chase him down to the sea wall for no reason.
>> ARTICLE
She wanted him to show her the wall (   )
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has not read the manga, it made perfect sense to me: to tell him how to get to the beach. And she bothered because she liked him and wanted to be the one walking him there.

>> ARTICLE
Ughhh that superhuman jump, make it more obvious that you're not a normal human will ya, Shinchi? I seriously think it would've seemed cooler if he jumped like to almost the height of the wall then pulled himself up. 
>> ARTICLE
I was hoping he'd run up the wall, was kinda disappointed when he just jumped it.
>> ARTICLE
That bugged me out as well, not really because of hiding his identity but jumping vertically as they show it just seems retarded, should've grabbed the edge.
>> ARTICLE
It's fine, he's just not thinking clearly at the moment. In any case, if a normal person witnesses a single "superhuman" act, psychologically speaking, they'll probably try to rationalize it out somehow. Like if I were in Maki's position, I'd probably wonder if maybe there was a automatic grappling hook and cable that I looked over, or something like that. Though, obviously, if she continues to witness more and more of these acts, the cognitive dissonance will get overcome and she'd have to face the reality of the situation. But we're not at that point though.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing he's thinking about is killing his mom's murderer, looking normal is the last thing on his mind.
>> ARTICLE
The explanation for Shinichi's non-death was done really well, and Migi's new deep sleep will be interesting. Nice to see a badass side to Shinichi who's finally ready to deal with these Parasytes, with some new speed and strength tied in. [The real fun starts now...](http://i.imgur.com/hmvzZW0.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
That music at the last 3 minutes were pretty fucking good. I don't really have a good ear for music/OST but this one stuck out and set up the mood for Shinichi's determination of avenging his mother. Have they played this piece before?

Also my heart screamed "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" when Maki started following Shinichi. pls dont kill her
>> ARTICLE
I LOVE THIS FUCKING SONG HOLY SHIT
>> ARTICLE
Yea, totally agree. The music wasn't flashy, but really captured the mood of the manga really well.
>> ARTICLE
I hope it becomes sort of a theme song -- it just works really well at ramping up the drama.

I personally loved the music timing exactly at [08:10](http://i.imgur.com/fsKFvwC.jpg) right before he went all badass mode.

They've done such a good job matching the animation with the OST.

it's the same song that played last episode when shinichi wakes up and walks towards the door. it fits SO PERFECTLY OMG... such feels

Wait, I was under the impression that he just wanted to kill any of them that he could find, not specifically the one that killed his mother. Why is everyone complaining about this? I didn't notice anything in the episode that implied that he was only trying to kill that specific one.
>> ARTICLE
You are correct.

Shinichi wants to kill that fake mom parasyte at same time harbors hatred towards parasytes as a whole (migi explicitly stated this).

When migi alerted shinichi about a parasyte nearby and shinichi (along with viewers) automatically associate it with his mom. And when migi question shinichi's resolve, it should be more like: "(if this parasyte is your mom,) will you able to kill her? (Because if you are not, then this is a death trip and we should turn back)".

Also regarding to the parasyte they encountering [difference between manga and anime spoiler](/s "that person is actually in hiding, oppose to sitting there chilling. That person also sense migi and wants to hide to survive, so before shinichi caught up with that person, shinichi and we viewers has no knowledge of that person's appearance.")
>> ARTICLE
Well, I kind of called that Migi would detach to administer first aid, which is about as hard as performing some kind of heart transplant in under three or four minutes.

Migi earns extra cute points for nursing Shinichi ~~back to~~ way beyond health.

And lastly, I can't wait for Shinichi to enact a mincemeat murder next week, or maybe two as that parasite was obviously not his mom.

This show is so captivating, and it handles the drama its themes very well. Every episode is so hype and I wish the wait for each ep was shorter. Great show, possible AOTS (I still love SnB).
>> ARTICLE
My god, the music for this show is just amazing. I need it!

As someone who wears glasses, I wouldn't mind having good vision. I wouldn't mind those changes.

I was thinking if he can change his body that much, why not have it affect his entire body instead of limiting it to his right arm?

I'm betting that's not his mom, but someone else. Guess we'll have to see next episode. 
>> ARTICLE
The OST was on point this episode
>> ARTICLE
I have an extremely bad feeling that by taking matters into his own hands, Shinichi will end up killing his mothers parasite, but in a way that makes him look like the murderer/monster. It would certainly lead the show in an interesting direction if that were to happen, and by the looks of right now, Shinichi is not exactly making extremely logical choices. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt a little bit disappointed with the ["I'll kill her"](http://i.imgur.com/cnUJG0Y.png) shot in anime, it looks like he's generally pissed. Where as [in the manga](http://i.imgur.com/7c5Njr2.png), I can feel a strong hatred.

Shinichi is gonna make some killing here on, enjoy!

Oh and anyone catches the preview, would love to hear theories from it. ;)

EDIT: Also, was it too comical to add [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/r3hVNhk.jpg) (where his face was glued to the floor for lying there 3 days)? I thought it's a nice touch.
>> ARTICLE
I think the manga version of that shot looks like he needs to take a huge shit.
>> ARTICLE
I think the "I'll kill her" shot is just as good in the anime version as it is in the manga.  Perhaps even more so because Shinichi looked even more "nerdy" before so it shows a bigger contrast with his character.

Crazy little episode. Shinichi is "saved" by Migi, and now the two are even closer than ever. With his newfound heart surgery, it appears that Shinichi has also gained a few power-ups: great speed, higher jumping, etc. Should be interesting to see him and Migi take on the Parasytes as time goes by.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi seems to have been reborn badass. Getting stabbed through the heart seems to make you twice as hot, tones your body, fixes your vision, and tightens up your cheeks. He even looks taller. Basically he became Spider-Man.

I gotta try it.

Pls don't try
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else notice the change in tone of Migi's voice when telling Shinichi about the incoming enemy? His voice had more emotion now compared to the monotonous warnings he gave to Shinichi the previous episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Yay Shinichis turning cool, just scared if the change is due to side effects from Migi passively affecting his personality rather than just him growing as a person in his own right.

Either way though, need vengeance for mommy.

I'd say it's a bit of both, Migi and Shinichi have become more alike one another, but he's still infuriated about his mother's passing.

Anyone realized the change to Miki? I feel like he/it started to become more "human". That part of talking with Shinichi, Miki seems to express more than usual in his movement, I don't think of him as just a logical coldhearted creature. I start to think that Miki and Shinichi will eventually balance it other out, Shinichi becomes more mature while Miki becomes less emotionless.

Migi*
>> ARTICLE
He actually has a nice body xD
Migi is pretty awesome. He fused with his heart and even fixed his eyesight. We finally know why he doesn't wear glasses in the opening.

His dad got hurt and all, but his fake mom went back to hotel and lied that he left? Why doesn't police suspect her for attempt of murder or something. It would make sense that she tried to kill him by pushing him off the cliff or whatever :P

Shinichi became a badass! Yay 
He even has superpowers it seems. Or at least enhanced human abilities :D
>> ARTICLE
In the manga they do (They asked if his dad has life insurance and maybe that's the reason he was pushed down the cliff).
>> ARTICLE
No spoilers, but having just finished the manga I highly recommend that none of you drop this anime at any point, it's an amazing story and it only gets better. The animators have done a great job so far. It's a guaranteed top 5 or maybe even a top 3 anime for me and I'm sure will be for many others after it's done. I can answer any questions anyone has if there is any. I'll try my best not to spoil anything if needed.
>> ARTICLE
>it's an amazing story and it only gets better

It can go even better than that? Holy crap AOTY confirmed.
>> ARTICLE
That piano music got to me all throughout that episode and it wasn't particularly sad or anything. OST soon please
>> ARTICLE
A monster is born. 
>> ARTICLE
Migi said once the only being in the world closest to the concept of demon is human being. Fake mom just released the kraken. Prepare to get REKT!
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda hoping eventually he comes across someone like himself. Another person living in symbiosis with the parasite. Also I fear for Maki, cute and vulnerable = certain death in these types of anime.  
>> ARTICLE
Guess Shinichi just leveled up.
+4 to Strength, Dexterity and his perception checks are much better too!
I guess Migi isn't that much of a horrible prosthetic arm after all
>> ARTICLE
Guys, I think we finally have ourselves a more mature and badass Shinichi. The fact that his face looks way older is signalling that he has matured and that he is ready to stop the Parasytes, specifically [Parasyte episode 5-6](/s ""his mom""). Symbolism is cool.

Guys.... I'm really excited. GUYS I'M REALLY EXCITED!

EDIT: HOLY SHIT HIS FUCKING RESOLVE AT THE END TO KILL HER YEEEEESSSSSS NEW SHINICHI IS THE BEST SHINICHI!
>> ARTICLE
You don't need to spoiler past or present episodes in the episode discussion thread.  But it's a good habit to have!
>> ARTICLE
I just wanted to make sure, I didn't know if we had to or not!
>> ARTICLE
To manga readers, please answer in PM or remember to spoiler tag properly, is that actually the mother or another parasyte? cause it didnt look like her to me at all tbh
>> ARTICLE
It's great to see they've actually tried to justify how Migi kept Shinichi alive, and the fact that it seems to have made changes to both  their physiologies is definitely going to keep things fresh and unpredictable.

Shinichi's character continues to grow and gains more depth with each episode, and now I'm really looking forward to seeing how things pan out with his father and Murano.

Seriously hoping Maki doesn't get killed off anytime soon either!
>> ARTICLE
cant get enough of this ost
>> ARTICLE
OH man this episode was amazing!! The piano OST is really good. I fucking love you, madhouse.

The music in this show is way tooooo good. My god

You can tell the amount of stress his body went through just by looking at his face damn.
>> ARTICLE
There's only two shows this season that I cannot wait a whole week to watch seriously. It's FATE/SN and Parasyte every week I cannot wait to see it. The other shows I watch are good but I can wait a week to watch it. But yeah thank god this show is 24 episodes long man it's so good
>> ARTICLE
Murano remains to be the best girl both in the Anime and Manga.
>> ARTICLE
Waited  1 week to see some 1v1 with his mom and i got a badass turn around on shinichi. 

Even if im dissapointed cause 1 week was a looooooooooooooooong period of time waiiting for the fight, i hope the next episode will give us a lot of bloodlust fighting spirit. 
>> ARTICLE
The amount of death flags on that girl.

>> ARTICLE
I gave in and read the manga after the last episode. Let us just say that my favorite part of this shows started this episode...
>> ARTICLE
That scene at the end: "Hey, I'm detecting another parasyte coming my way, with *killing* intent. Oh well, better sit down and enjoy the view"

This makes me think it is not the mother, but who knows.
>> ARTICLE
The parasyte is Migi, we don't know if Migi had a killing intent, but shinichi did, shinichi isn't the parasyte tho
>> ARTICLE
we know parasytes can have a killing intent, as Migi can detect them.

Now, the questions is: does Migi has a killing intent? I would say yes, given that the last conversation they had was basically him asking Shinichi if he has blank check to kill the mom
>> ARTICLE
Everytime the show is over I want to read the manga but I can't it's not fair
>> ARTICLE
ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!!! I cant believe I doubted this show at first.
>> ARTICLE
The show keeps getting better and better!
I have the feeling that this is going to be on my top 5 favorite anime of all the time *o*
>> ARTICLE
This IS one of my top manga of all time. So wouldn't be surprised if that does turn out so.
>> ARTICLE
Pffft, there's no way Maki-chan can compete with Murano.  
Also, Shinichi has superpowers apparently.
>> ARTICLE
oh ffs, i was so confused at the start of the ep

.. somehow i managed to skip ep 5 last week

ugh, out of order watching.

strange that it all made sense though..
>> ARTICLE
I have to admit, I started watching this because I heard mad house was making it, and after first episode I was ready to drop it. 

Having stuck with it, holy shit this is getting good. I feel like shinichi is the perfect mc for this show. He is everything the guy in evangelion wanted to be, a normal person stuck in an impossible situation (and willing to actually stand up). 

This episode he was just a complete badass, I was in shock when he jumped 10 feet over a wall. Looking forward to the character change when he fights his mom. He's fucking awesome when he's not a nerdy weakling. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuck this show! I can't wait another week to see this conclusion, I want to see it now!! How am I going to get through the week?
>> ARTICLE
obviously shinichi had most of the development this week, but Migi got some notable moments as well.

In particular the moment he asked Shinichi if he could kill his mom showed a lot. Previously Migi wouldn''t have bothered or thought twice about killing her.
>> ARTICLE
Guess Migi's improvements to Shinichi did not extend to his vision... oh wait they did.

He must be blinded by rage to not realize that is a guy in a tracksuit.
>> ARTICLE
That was an amazing episode. I loved how Migi saved Shinichi and that they explained it really well.
>> ARTICLE
Migi is best doctor. 
>> ARTICLE
I have an extremely bad feeling that by taking matters into his own hands, Shinichi will end up killing his mothers parasite, but in a way that makes him look like the murderer/monster. It would certainly lead the show in an interesting direction if that were to happen, and by the looks of right now, Shinichi is not exactly making extremely logical choices. 
>> ARTICLE
The BGM from last time when Shinichi went to confront his mother and now as he departed from Murano and then as he went off to chase the next parasyte really made this episode. There's just something about those tunes.
>> ARTICLE
 This episode has made me marathon the entire manga.. which was quite a ride. Can't wait till it's all animated. 

I'd probably recommend anyone reading this to wait for the weekly episodes, I can see this being much better when animated. 
>> ARTICLE
That episode was actually so badass!!!. i wouldn't be surprised if this anime becomes my all time favourite anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah another episode of Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritus. Or as I like to call it [Theseus's Ship: the Anime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus). 

Seriously. This show is great. When Migi started replacing his heart, it was awesome, and they're doing a pretty good job exploring what makes up our humanity in a not heavy handed way. 
>> ARTICLE
Shiiiiiiiiiit.

It seems Migi and Shinichi are becoming more alike than either would probably want. I'm guessing that's going to continue as the show goes on...

Maki seems like a prime candidate to get accidentally murdered. The sweet, innocent characters never survive these sorts of shows.

Shinichi seems to be a bit blinded by rage, though... That person at the end looks like a guy in a tracksuit, not like his mother at all.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi for Peter Parker confirmed.

Pretty good episode as always, much better than the previous one. The only thing I could complain about is Shinichi's complete 180 going from "okasan's not dead" to "I need to kill okasan's killer" in a matter of days. The small amount of action was also pretty good, can't wait to see Shinichi become a bigger and more reliable part of fights.
>> ARTICLE
You could say that shinichi's character somehow adjusted itself , first the question was " are you really shinichi kun ? " now the question will probably be " are you the human shinichi (lastname) ?"

He'a becoming more like migi , atleast that is what it looks like to me
>> ARTICLE
Well Migi was floating around in his bloodstream, maybe that caused more than just a physical transformation?
>> ARTICLE
I can't belive how much I like this show. It gets me all hyped. I really like it. Can't wait for next week!

I bet his ass is going to get whipped because of his recklessness and cockyness.

why do you refer to migi as a she?

This new Shinichi is like a way cooler guy than the old one. Now he's stronger physically and has improved senses, and is more of a badass. I love new Shinichi.
>> ARTICLE
Man this is definitely my anime of the season so far!
>> ARTICLE
The ost for this episode was soooo good. I can't wait for it to come out!!!
>> ARTICLE
Another fantastic episode.
>> ARTICLE
Well this episode was beautiful and really kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved the raw emotions of the characters and Shinichi's ability to be a complete badass and we haven't even seen half his powers!

Likely the person at the end is going to not be his mother and just be another one of migi's kind who will get a shit tonne of anger poured onto his face. I just hope nothing happens to the dad... because if it [does](http://rustledjimmies.com/)...
>> ARTICLE
Makiko is such a best girl.

The cliffhanger is strong within this serie ! Things are getting more and more exciting !

That Maki girl is probably the other parasite he was talking about.
>> ARTICLE
That one piano track is amazing, this is turning out great. 
>> ARTICLE
Should I watch or wait until next week? I really hate it to stop in the middle of a climax.
>> ARTICLE
It's going to be a harmless parasyte, I'm calling it now. Nevertheless, Shinichi will butcher it to pieces in flying rage.
>> ARTICLE
I love this episode. And it's completely logical that Shinichi can run faster and farther, as he no longer has the constraints of a human heart. 

The character development is fantastic as well.
>> ARTICLE
That look on Shinichi's face, now **thats** what I'm talking about, great episode.
>> ARTICLE
I think parasyte has to be the show that "flys by" the most when i see it.

This episode was pretty great, i really liked how the whole Dr. Migi thing was explained.

My only concern still is wether or not Migi will end up being an ally to humanity. I also think that it would be a little bit shitty to add "human empathy" to Migi just because they underwent that "fusion". We'll see.
>> ARTICLE
Regarding to parasyte emotion, back in manga text are static and does not convey vocal tune or volume, hence the emotion from those text are up to your imagination.

IMO Mad house is conflicting whether it is too risky to get a VA to monotone throughout the entire series (given that migi talks a lot).

So just keep this in mind, parasytes we knew so far has no emotions, that applies to migi. 
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know the song after the ending song? The one playing during the preview for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know what manga chapter to pick up on? I don't think I can wait another week...
>> ARTICLE
The anime is skipping way too much from the manga =/
>> ARTICLE
Fucking amazing episode. Fucking amazing show.

The progression of Shinichi from mild-mannered student to badass hero is coming along quite nicely. I love how the pacing of this show keeps you hooked; revealing just enough to keep you invested but leaving out enough to keep you wanting more (what's that other thing you need to tell Shinichi, Migi?). I have a feeling this Good Samaritan Miko (sp?) girl will have a part to play next week. And clearly Shinichi's target is a dude, not his parasyte mom so WTF is gonna happen there?

Goddamit the wait is going to be unbearable for next week. Ugh.
>> ARTICLE
We're finally getting to see the transformation of Shinichi to how he looks at the end of the OP!
>> ARTICLE
Okay, allow me to say *holy shit*. This show really knows how to pace itself well, the episodes just seem to be going by at a mile a minute. 

Also, this seems to be heavily influenced by Marvel superhero comics, Spiderman influences being especially present. Everything from the tragic death of his loving mother, to getting the girl by fighting off one-dimensional thugs. I can't really say I enjoy being able to predict Shinichi's story arc like this, but it's not like it's unenjoyable. 

Overall, still a strong episode. I'm never finding myself not wanting to watch because the show does such a good job of raising the stakes, and I'm actually interested in where things will go once this whole arc is done.

I would post this in episode 5's thread (and I'm sorry if I should have, but just found this subreddit and only thought of this today), but is there any significance behind how we see the earth inside Tamiya Ryoko's eyes in some previous episode?  We see the parasite inside shinichi's, but that could be cause he's becoming part of him and living in him, but don't know about the meaning of the Earth?
>> ARTICLE
That was cool watching Migi gain human emotion. You could see it on his hand face that he was sad or depressed when they talked about how he didn tlike migi. Migi also takes time to confirm whether or not its ok to kill from shinichi unlike last with his the meat shield.  
Migi by being with shinichi is making him learn human emotion and consideration.  
  
Shinichi on the other hand(see what i did there) is becoming the parasyte. He is gaining advanced speed, endurance and a overall increase. He doesn't even need his glasses any more due to the bonding him and migi did. His agression is also increasing however as the episode before he didnt want to hurt anyone but this episode he was ready to ham
>> ARTICLE
I'm really liking the way this was written. No shortcuts, no asspulls, and every action (or lack thereof) has a major consequence. I bet Shinichi's going to get something bad in return for acting solely on his emotions.

Confirmed AOTS
>> ARTICLE
MADHOUSE YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARDS. THAT THERE is the character design he should have!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the thing Migi was trying to tell Shinichi is gonna haunt it I already know it...
>> ARTICLE
When shinichi first got stabbed in the heart I though Migi was going to kill his mom and take her heart and replace his with it but becoming his heart works too.
>> ARTICLE
"Gentleman, I can rebuild him. I have the power. I have the capability to make the world's first human-parasyte man. Shinichi Izumi will be that man. Better than he was before. Better...stronger...faster." 
            -Migi
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking Migi's psychology might be a bit altered too. We see Shinichi becoming more like Migi, maybe now we will get the reverse. Migi doesn't seem that concerned that Shinichi is willing to actively pursue a fight instead of avoid it, which doesn't seem like him...maybe we get a bit more of a bond.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know what chapter the the anime is at now for the manga?
>> ARTICLE
shinichi was badass in this episode specially when he jumped
>> ARTICLE
This anime is easily becoming top 3 this season for me. How bad-ass is Migi to be so independent when Shinichi was down to healing him completely and changing him? The evolution of both Migi and Shinichi is unreal. 

The uneasy feeling I get when seeing that girl, especially running AFTER Shinichi towards the beach... so many death flags I really hope she doesn't get killed.

We can relate to this series because its kinda set in our time - and we can realistically connect with the tragedy that happened is one of the things that really sets this anime as a unique one for me this season.

And now I will go read the manga because I cannot wait another week for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Does anybody know songs like the one playing for the last minutes? It makes me so pumped up and at the same time relaxed, which would be really good for when I'm doing my homework or playing league etc.

Enjoying this series quite a bit, really happy with the adaptation so far :)

The piano music during the scene with Shinichi and Satomi was beautiful. Anyone know if there's a name for the track? Same goes the track played during the last scene.

I read the manga in early 2000s and could not believe myself pull up for so long to read it!

So could Migi give Shinichi the control over his hand when he is asleep. Like transforming into razors and stuff to fight himself?

That sounds feasible.

It's a book by Ernest Hemingway from the 1920s. I looked at the other episode titles, and it seems they're all references to books. The Metamorphosis (episode 1) and the Stranger (episode 5) in particular are some good reads I can personally recommend. --English nerd out.

Wow Not-Okaasan really got screwed in the parasite department

edit: CRAP, I really like Uda and Parasite, which means I have to worry about *someone else* dying now, too. Hope they show up again (I assume they will). 

One of my favorite parts in the episode was Shinichi closing his eyes so he didn't see his mom's transformation from woman to monster. I am thoroughly loving how he's such an emotional character without being completely stupid. He doesn't spend 5 episodes crying about having to kill his mom, he gets his shit together to put her out of her misery because *it's no longer her*. Well done. 

The shot of his dad crying was pretty horrible though. I feel so bad for that man. 

Looks like Shinichi's transformation into badass is fully complete by next episode! THE TIME OF SEXY HAIR IS UPON US.

I said it last week but he's the perfect character. He faces challenges unreasonable for himself and handles them as a human, while not collapsing from pressure like most other characters in similar stories do. 

I feel sorry for uda, what an uncomfortable part of the body to lose. He can't even talk or eat without permission. Still he's a welcome character considering he's shinichi's first real ally. 
>> ARTICLE
For sure, love how human his reactions are compared to the average anime character. He's one of my favourite protagonists now. Much better than that whiny Tokyo ghoul guy >_>.
>> ARTICLE
tbh he gets his shit together way earlier in the manga. the anime made him out to be a puching bag D: "accidentally beating someone through clumsiness" gig
>> ARTICLE
If the anime follows the manga for the rest of the Aogiri arc, be prepared for more badass Kaneki. I also don't want to sound like a broken clock but [Tokyo Ghoul Manga vs. Anime comparison](/s "Hes much less whiny and is actually fairly intelligent and less of a wimp in the manga. Even before he became white haired Kaneki, he was already pretty badass, but in the manga he becomes straight up insane, especially once he became White haired Kaneki.")
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul's anime went out of its way to make him a crybaby. In the manga he's generally more calm.
>> ARTICLE
Not really. They didn't add any scenes where he was whinny, they just cut out some scenes that show him being more intelligent. It's important to humanize him in season 1, they'll be plenty of time for him being a badass and a strategist in the second season.

Are we going to get a season 2 though? I don't want a repeat of Deadman Wonderland where MC gets his shit together and then the anime just ends on us. 
>> ARTICLE
We are getting a season 2 but I believe they said it will be almost completely anime original so the manga readers like me won't really know if the badass Kaneki from the manga will be shown in the same way in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who's completely new to manga(other than Kuroko no Basket) would you recommend Tokyo Ghoul?  I really wanted to like the anime, but I couldn't stand the censorship and the blu ray version is hardly an improvement from what I've seen.  I've been looking for a good quality manga just to see if I enjoy the medium and would love to hear your opinion on the matter. 
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul was actually my second manga (The first being Gantz) and it was really good, theres quite a lot you miss out in the anime and if you watched the whole season there is a LOOOOOT of character development you miss out on which ends up changing the character for the better. I'd recommend giving it a go.
>> ARTICLE
That whiny Tokyo Ghoul guy's transformation simply took 4 times longer than Shinchi, but at the same time he's 4 times more bad ass.
>> ARTICLE
He really is in that sweet spot of freaking out *just* enough (like anyone would do) without it going into impotent MC range (which is frustrating to watch, even if it is realistic). 

I really like that Uda and Parasite are the funny, yet still badass bro duo to Shinichi and Migi's calm-and-collected partnership. Really looking forward to seeing some fun fight scenes involving the 4 of them teaming up.
>> ARTICLE
At least he's not Shinji from evangelion. *shudder*
>> ARTICLE
True, but Shinji's entire life fuckin' *sucked*. Not that Shinichi's isn't super rough, but at least he has/had (sadface) two loving parents and friends who care a lot about him. Even random passersby like the guy (Maki, Uda, scary bully girl maybe?)!

Perhaps that's the difference? Usually in anime where everything is going wrong for the MC, literally *everything* is going wrong, down to all the people they are surrounded by, so they just end up flipping out. It's not really that way in Parasite, which I'm enjoying, but also dreading, because I'm really afraid the people close to Shinichi are going to die. But he's motivated because he has people to protect. It's very effective storytelling!

Shaft has given us unrealistic expectations of ~~female bodies~~ neck anatomy, but even such "light" head tilting as portrayed in that picture is extremely uncomfortable. You can try yourself.

Of course, sasuga Shinichi-sama is above us, lowly humans, so that might be nothing for him.
>> ARTICLE
I must be an alien or something,  I find that pretty easy to do
>> ARTICLE
I think the point is that even though you're seeing him from the back, almost all of his face is visible. Although, his back is turned slightly towards the camera on the side he's turning his head to, so any exaggeration is very small. 
>> ARTICLE
his body is slightly turned to where he is facing, so he isnt actually turning his head as far as it might seem. If you turn your body the way his is and tilt your head, its only slightly uncomfortable
>> ARTICLE
Looking from behind their back, you shouldn't be able to see that far side of the edge of their face, ouch my brain.

I just tried it, my right eye can't see past my left shoulder.  His head is twisted about 15 degrees too far.  Of course that's easily explainable by the 30% of migi swimming around inside him.

Got to say that I like the anime character designs quite a bit more. Well, I'd probably get used to it if I actually read the thing.

The manga came out in the 80s, it's just how characters were designed back then. See, for example, [this redditor's work](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1640ej/i_morphed_together_a_bunch_of_anime_faces_to/) in morphing groups of faces for the generic "look" of each of the past few decades.

You're doing god's work.
>> ARTICLE
It's the perfect episode. I want another one like this one but I have a feeling shit is going to hit the fan and it's going to happen fast.
>> ARTICLE
I hope eventually Shinichi can control Migi's morphing while he is sleeping.  Otherwise he's stuck with whatever he leaves him before napping.
>> ARTICLE
I assume thats what the explanation about splitting off with a 'directive' is for. Little bits that form a weapon in his body that he can pull out or something like that.
>> ARTICLE
That mouth...

EDIT: God, that was so fucking satisfying. And the first time I haven't heard "Next Time on PARASYTE!" In my head. 

After Credits looks like Shinichi is gonna fuck up Beanie Bully. So ready for next Wednesday. ITS A DOUBLE HEADER! AHHHHHH
>> ARTICLE
We're going to get so spoiled with two episodes next week, I'll want two every week.
>> ARTICLE
We got two episodes next week? Is this true or you just high on this episode epicness? Is this a Christmas or something? ;D
>> ARTICLE
It's in celebration of the release of the live-action movie adaptation. I'll probably never watch it, but yay for double anime episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I think they announced that they're releasing 2 episodes to celebrate the release of the Parasyte movie
>> ARTICLE
There...there's a...Parasyte...MOVIE...   
\\(TOT)/
>> ARTICLE
Wat?

2 episodes and we also get a movie? T_T This is too good, the dream. 
>> ARTICLE
You got it wrong, it'll be 2 movies...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, live-action. 

Edit: For those curious, here's two trailers of the live-action movie:

[Trailer 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn30pP-VAI8)

[Trailer 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPHCQop8nng)
>> ARTICLE
Dude, idk if you've been watching but for 2 weeks when F/SN was 40 minutes I had to hunch over. 
>> ARTICLE
>hunch over

Mind explaining? I'd never heard the expression before Amagi, and google doesn't seem to know what it means
>> ARTICLE
Haha, it means they have a boner. At least that's what I've gotten from it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he's "hunching over" to hide his boner.
>> ARTICLE
> I had to hunch over.

Ah, so I'm not the only one who's using that expression. 

Based Amagi. 
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully Maki doesn't die. I don't want to see such a sweet, innocent girl get murdered.

* Big man has big mouth and big chin. Wow.

* She lives! [Rejoice, boys!](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140308140236/disneycreate/images/d/d6/Rejoice.gif)

* [So many Migi. Oh well, the more Migi the better, right?](http://i.imgur.com/uTMK8B1.png)

* I'm liking Maki more and more. Please let her live throughout the whole course.

* Holy shit. Shinichi might probably be my favorite badass character now. The way he doesn't hesitate to succeed in his objective and his greatly improved abilities make him one hell of a great MC.

**Opinion :**

What an episode. It was intense, comedic and at Maki's scenes, cute. The OST is still fantastic and that ED is still hitting me in the feels like a truck.

That scene where Shinichi saw his mom again was just painful. I'm glad he realizes that it wasn't her mom and doesn't hesitate to kill her. Not seeing Maki for awhile is gonna be sad though.

Also, [I think I may have gone gay after this smile.](http://i.imgur.com/E1Z7hXl.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I wonder what the point of including Maki even was. It seems clear that the main love interest is Murano. This episode he barely even acknowledged Maki. I just ended up feeling sorry for her :x

Also no one has acknowledged the end. Both Murano and bully-girl are able to sense Shinichi's presence now. That's definitely some plot relevant shit right there.
>> ARTICLE
Maki's role is much bigger in the manga. What you saw was the residue of where they made big cuts (in this arc) to make space since they only have 25 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Maki basically notices Shinichi's struggling and tries to find out more about him/help him. The crying on the inside line was basically the entire point of her character. She sees him as human, and keeps Shinichi feeling human after this mess he's going through. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure Murano just saw him from behind, but yea that other girl definitely sensed him.  
>> ARTICLE
He gets more badass. You'll love it.
>> ARTICLE
I refuse to believe you since that's not possible. He is at maximum badassery after that fight
>> ARTICLE
Someone told me that Breaking Bad gets more intense after season 1. I laughed at them and went "Dude just blew up a freaking building!...In episode 5! How can this get any more crazy?"  

Believe me, it *does*.  

So, when people tell me that this show gets more insane, I absolutely believe every word they say of it, and I'm giddy with anticipation.
>> ARTICLE
The season of the badass MCs
>> ARTICLE
I love badass MCs. Care to list who you think qualifies from currently airing shows? The ones who come to mind from what I've been watching are

* Grisaia no Kajitsu
* Nanatsu no Taiza?
* Amagi Brilliant Park?

though the last two don't quite fit the mold.
>> ARTICLE
Shingeki no Bahamut has amazing characters.
>> ARTICLE
Well after a season of totally emotionless MCs, this feels like heaven.
>> ARTICLE
Every week, I hope that they bring back the "Shinichi, it's cold" gag and the last three episodes have failed to deliver. I'm hoping this episode is different.

EDIT: I am sorely disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi... tsumetai..

[Where did my boy Shinichi get all these bitches](http://imgur.com/xeEYp9Q)

Reminder double episode next week!!!

I had forgotten but now I really can't wait for 2 episodes next week. 
>> ARTICLE
Next Wednesday is the day before my B-day. Gonna be good!
>> ARTICLE
WHAAAT? Double Episode! I'm so EXCITED!
>> ARTICLE
Frame 5 is the bully kid, Frame 6 shows him blocking a punch. Looks like aside from the boner I'll have from watching 2 episodes in a week, I'll also have to hunch over for a justice hardon.
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait to see the guys face when the tables get turned. I doubt it'll happen but I want Shinichi to pound his face and say the same thing he told Shinchi while beating him. "I hate posers like you." For some reason, that statement made my blood boil.
>> ARTICLE
Oh God, THIS!!! I can't wait to see his ass get beat by Shinichi.
>> ARTICLE
What the preview looks like:

> Teacher's pregnant

> Bully confrontation

> Shinichi being badass

> Childhood friend officially joins the love shape

Looks like a good episode.
>> ARTICLE
Ambiguous love shape of the harem.
>> ARTICLE
[Uda and Parasite being adorable as all get out](http://i.imgur.com/ZV7scXl.jpg)

Man the parasite fights are so glorious animated, this adaption isn't dissapointing me.
>> ARTICLE
This is a weird thing to comment on but I really liked the eye color of Uda's parasyte.

Also I really like how Uda dealt the finishing blow on Shinichi's mom so he didn't have to live with the guilt of killing her.  I've read the manga but I was still on the edge of my seat watching the fight.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi's already too OP! Pls nerf!

After that conversation with Migi, it looks like his toughest battle will be a psychological one. Seems like he'll continue to doubt his humanity as he changes, and I bet that'll effect both his battles with other parasytes and his relationships with other people. 

Bet this'll cause him to have doubts about his relationship with Murano and slow down their romantic progression. Too bad too, because you can tell she's totally head over heels for Shinichi now. Dude's not just a badass now...he's a total stud!
>> ARTICLE
Hella op. Did you see his new technique in action? "Ovary Explosion." it must be a passive skill since the long hair chick got hit without being able to see him. 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure she's pregnant with triplets after getting hit with that. 
>> ARTICLE
anime spider man is so close to being my favorite mc. That new look man pretty much seals the deal.
>> ARTICLE
His character transformation is so similar to Peter Parker. The dork with glasses becoming a badass without glasses saving people.
>> ARTICLE
> anime spider man

If we go into superhero territory we may as well sing:

Parasiteman, Parasiteman,  
Does whatever a parasite can  
Spins a blade, any size,  
Catches cannibals just like flies  
Look Out!  
Here comes the Parasiteman.  

Is he strong?  
Listen bud,  
He's got parasitic blood.  
Can he swipe alien head  
Take a look overhead  
Hey, there  
There goes the Parasiteman.  
>> ARTICLE
You are my hero man. 
>> ARTICLE
[You mean this?] (http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/23841.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
That was an interesting episode, the first half felt more comedic, with Uda. It of course turned pretty serious near the end, it was pretty cool to see how Shinichi would handle his mother on his own (with a little Migi help). Parasite pulled a nice move, keeping Uda alive by shifting his organs.  
  
At least now Shinichi has someone in the same position as him to talk to.   
  
RIP Shinichi's Mom.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I thought last episode was almost perfect but this one is one more milimeter closer to perfection.

So, with the last scene containing epic culmination of shinichi's transformation and reaching final closure on mom's case the badassery process is complete.

We kinda knew that opening is basically a huge foreshadowed character development - falling down the pit is a symbol of dealing with horror/losing innocence and when he lands he is already changed forever.

[Now let's compare starting Shinichi to the current one.](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141018080544/kiseijuu/images/4/4a/Shinichi_Izumi_Anime_Before_After.png) Damn.

Btw. Is it just me or he's a bit taller than before? Or maybe it's just an impression coming from his skinnier figure.
>> ARTICLE
Shit! I didn't realize it like that! Good observation!
>> ARTICLE
So happy Shinichi didn't have to kill what was left of his mother. 
>> ARTICLE
I called what was going to happen, and was so happy when it did, but then Uda had to crawl back up and deliver that line, which I was *not* expecting, and damn if I didn't just about cream myself from how good this episode turned out.
>> ARTICLE
Based Uda/Parasite
>> ARTICLE
Interesting how Migi doesn't know for sure if his fragments merged with Shinichi's brain. I wonder if this will cause him to have a major personality shift later on
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion there was quite a bit of foreshadowing towards a change in personality within this episode.  I imagine it's going to be a bigger topic next episode with his already suspicious 'girlfriend'.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, I think he's lying so he wouldn't piss off Shinichi.
>> ARTICLE
Super Shinichi now has sword arm? Fucking awesome. I love this new model!
>> ARTICLE
And he had to hide from civilization for the next 4 hours to wait for Migi to wake up...
>> ARTICLE
This is one of those things you cut out a story, like bathroom breaks.
>> ARTICLE
This show became a harem so slowly I didn't even notice.
>> ARTICLE
It's boiling frog effect.

They just slowly adding new average girl and gradually making them awesome one by one...
>> ARTICLE
This is like the happiest episode yet.   Shinichi gets to make a friend, avenge his mother, and look badass to his friends.

I really like that Shinichi gains an ally in a similar situation.   I never really liked the idea of the MC always being the chosen one.
>> ARTICLE
Next week on Shinichi, The Panty Dropper.  Shinichi gets in a fight and makes panties drop.  Tune in next time!
>> ARTICLE
Poor Maki-chan. Her ovaries were left intact. 
>> ARTICLE
The little tidbit of the preview made me realize that we might be getting a little of one of my favourite (anime) tropes in the following episodes: a super-badass MC dispatching lowly humans like it's nothing. If they can put a few people being surprised, it'll be perfect \*having Mahouka recollections\*
>> ARTICLE
Except this time its actually earned badassery and not generic self-inserting power fantasy. I don't think anyone wishes to go through what Shinichi has; and even though he may have "because he's the mc" plot armor as we've seen its clearly not enough protection to stop horrible things from happening to him 
>> ARTICLE
When he died they actually gave a good explanation and way to bring him back instead of the magic of friendship and love, i dont even know if that count as plot armor
>> ARTICLE
That's just lazy author.
>> ARTICLE
*SAO*
>> ARTICLE
But Kirito never died. And anyone who died in SAO never came back.
>> ARTICLE
[SAO I spoiler](/s "Kirito's physical body never died, but his HP definitely hit zero when Heathcliff stabbed him.  He started disintegrating but then reformed his body through sheer *willpower* to counter-attack Heathcliff. Kayaba mentioned that Kirito somehow exceeded the limits of the system and did something that shouldn't be possible.  The author goes back to try and justify this later in the Alicization arc in SAO and in the Accel World series.")
>> ARTICLE
Wait, Accel World is written by the same author as SAO?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, and they place in the same world, just a few decades apart.  Popular fan theory is that Kuroyukihime is Kirito and Asuna's daughter.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I never knew that. Looks like I need to watch it then.
>> ARTICLE
wait same world.. is accel earlier or later? since accel came out years before, so confusing.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure if authors truly use their mind, they can sure comes up with logical and fitting explanation, since their imagination and creativity is really good, instead of just neverending friendship power.
>> ARTICLE
Wich one? Parasyte or example?
>> ARTICLE
friendship and magical love
>> ARTICLE
Fairy Tail must be the laziest series of all time then.
>> ARTICLE
Been awhile since I've felt an episode so satisfying without any losses to go along with it. New chin dude seems alright glad he lived, very little chance I see of him betraying MC at the moment too. 

MC also sexy now building his own harem it seems. Middle school girl looks like she lost already though. Can't wait to see him kick prolly the bully's ass next episode based on preview.

Even the reply in the anime is more badass.

'Yo', instead of, 'Hi'
>> ARTICLE
I would bet money that he said "Yo" in the original Japanese.

The speech bubble is to small for much else.

edit: [Yup, he says "!", which is just "Yo"](http://i.imgur.com/4DGB2tU.png)
>> ARTICLE
> Oretachi no Shinichi ga Konna ni Kakkoii Wake ga Nai!

Japanese -> english google translate

We're of the 4th there is no reason to this is cool!
>> ARTICLE
Isn't it "Our Shinichi can't be this handsome/goodlooking"
>> ARTICLE
I think it's supposed to be cool rather than cute but i dunno just started learning 
>> ARTICLE
It is indeed, the original title is My little sister can't be this cute (Oreimo), and he basically swapped little sister with shinichi and cute with cool
>> ARTICLE
 (kakkoii) = attractive; good-looking; stylish; "cool" according to jisho.org

cute is kawaii..

>> ARTICLE
I am happy Aizen found a job after Bleach, I have a bad feeling though, there are three girls and one guy, this isn't a harem so I think something bad is going to happen = \
>> ARTICLE
Well. Maki-chan is a bit too far plus Idk if she knows where he even lives. (which makes me kind of sad, I kind of liked her.) 

Long hair chick got caught in the Ovary Explosion before she even saw him so I think she might be done for! 
>> ARTICLE
Well damn, looks like he came back as a badass. 

The fight was awesome. Kinda hilarious Parasite is on his lips and he was just flailing around during the fight. Glad he has an ally. Thought he'd do the same deal as what Migi did when he got hit. 

I was hoping he'd tell dad, but maybe next time. 

Next episode please. 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else really liked the melody just at the episode's ending? Not sure whether it was played for the first time.  
 Anyhoo, I really like the OST.
>> ARTICLE
its a variation of the theme that plays whenever shinichi and murano are being cute together
>> ARTICLE
Episode 2, starts from 00:20:09
>> ARTICLE
My favorite OST is when Shinichi first confronts his mom that chanting music that plays is amazing. I can't wait for the OST to be released.
>> ARTICLE
[yup, also my favorite so far](http://youtu.be/NumVrbn5CRg)
>> ARTICLE
That is pretty badass sounding. I want to find the version with all that bad ass gregorian chanting in the background.
>> ARTICLE
This show! This show! Every week it just leaves me wanting to come back for more. Easily AOTY for me. Now I can't wait for next week to see how Shinichi's new personality fits in with his friends.
>> ARTICLE
its gonna be epic.
>> ARTICLE
Sinichi is a beast. It was interesting to see how Migi healing him altered his body and emotions. 

I wonder if his impact on emotions will make him cold/uninterested in Satomi if anything.
>> ARTICLE
I fucking love this pussy mc to badass mc clich...next episode is gonna be EPIC.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi 2.0, here we come!




>> ARTICLE
ohhh the shinichi transformation i love it now shit gets even better

>> ARTICLE
Had to read the manga after seeing last weeks episode, and honestly madhouse has done simply the most amazing job at adapting the story for the anime. It's nearly flawless, I'm enjoying this anime so much. Badass Shinichi is hottest Shinichi, I love it
>> ARTICLE
After reading the manga, I'm glad as fuck Madhouse did the adaption for this show. They did everything right and so far is making this adaption better than the manga.

The OST is Best by far for the whole year as well.
>> ARTICLE
Holy SHIT. That was an awesome episode. Even though I've read the manga, I just can't believe how well they're adapting this.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
first few pages of Chapter 17
>> ARTICLE
One person died this episode, and it is not human. 

Shinichi is back, and badass mode has been unlocked.

This episode has been too nice. I am afraid of what lies ahead
>> ARTICLE
Hot Damn. The way his voice goes from a rasping trembling right before the fight to a completely different deeper voice gave me chills. "I wont waste anytime killing you." I'm loving this transition to badass.
>> ARTICLE
I hope his personality didn't change too much i liked how nice and sweet he was and would hate if he became like this flat cold uncaring cool guy.

And also GANBATE MAKI-CHAN!
>> ARTICLE
He's blending in with Migi, I feel like he's going to turn colder and colder. Notice how big mouth was pretty similar in character to the host in some ways?
>> ARTICLE
Well that was the parasite environment,so to say. He lived with the guy and took in lots of info and way of talking from T.V so he'd have a lot more cheerful tone (tho I think deep down he is just as logical as migi)
>> ARTICLE
At the very least he has the same fighting sense as Migi, seeing the pattern that not-mother was doing in their fight and adjusting appropriately, as well as choosing a good place to have a fight. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll say its bit of both: parasytes born with personality, that is then shaped by  the environment it grew in.

Migi is book heavy but he didn't turn out to be like Ryouko.
>> ARTICLE
Hot damn Shinichi became a badass.
>> ARTICLE
People don't forget we get two episodes next week so get hyped episode 8&9
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi's voice was different in the end when he talks to Murano???
btw, this anime is so fucking good!! 

>> ARTICLE
Another great ep. Anime Spider-Man's power to attract the ladies grows stronger day by day.
>> ARTICLE
Called it last week that the person would also not be fully controlled by the parasite and got downvoted. Whoo! suck it nerds!
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps they downvoted you thinking you were a manga reader and just "subtly" spoiling the next episode with outside knowledge.
>> ARTICLE
Worst part about discussing episodes on this sub, I know a lot of people don't do it intentionally, but you'll see someone say something like "Susan is a great character I really like her and hope she sticks around" then someone will post "(   )" and it's like, you don't know for sure it's a spoiler, but you'll always be brooding over it until it happens.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you are talking about expectation spoiler

That's something really hard to control as manga viewers also wish to share the excitement and certain time it is hard to resist putting out more then one should.

So after this episode we get an hour long special of both episodes 8 and 9.

Anyone else love the Drum&Bass during the fight scene?

I NEED THIS OST.
>> ARTICLE
Goddanm he's a full fleshed badass, migi is still best girl
>> ARTICLE
> migi is still best girl


I think you mean *girls*, since he can separate into more Migis.
>> ARTICLE
so migi is a harem in the palm of your hand ? 
>> ARTICLE
I wish they had expanded on Maki's interaction with Shinichi. I feel like there could be more added to deepen their relationship.
>> ARTICLE
Maki pls no
>> ARTICLE
BADASS MC YES.
>> ARTICLE
I still can't believe he didn't tell his father. At the end I figured he'd reveal migi, but I guess not. Still he's one hell of a lady killer, dem glasses. 
>> ARTICLE
Telling his father could have a major backfire. Confirming that his wife was turned into a parasite would be very traumatic for him and if Sinichi reveals Migi, there's the possibility of his father becoming very afraid of his son for a while. 
>> ARTICLE
His father knows that something's wrong with Shinichi, he's just in denial. And he's mentally unstable because nobody believes in what he saw.
>> ARTICLE
does anyone have a before/after transformation picture?
>> ARTICLE
Almost everything I want to say about this episode (and show, for that matter) has already been said. I just want to know this: how does Kana know? I don't want to be spoiled, but that is the question squirming around in my mind.
>> ARTICLE
I knew it! When the CD with Parasyte's OST comes out it'll be great! Can't wait for another episode, damn they end so fast...
>> ARTICLE
But but but , i cant fucking wait for the next episode..!! So much cliff hanging im gonna fall :/ Who is the new best girl in the end? How cool is the new shinichi!!
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, that episode was so incredibly satisfying! So much happened! And our MC has grown up, what a bad ass!
>> ARTICLE
Well, I just need more of Uda's parasyte, I love Migi but Parasyte is fucking awesome too
>> ARTICLE
This show has transformed in the last 3 eps, every ep is top quality. So exciting
>> ARTICLE
Does that make Uda the bro of the season?
>> ARTICLE
Damn that's the kind of character development I love!!
>> ARTICLE
Definitely one of my top favorites this season and a strong candidate for my anime of the season. 
>> ARTICLE
That was a satisfying episode.

The ending wasn't a huge teasing cliffhanger, and it was good in atmosphere.
>> ARTICLE
Migi: "Oh, I don't think that having 30% of me floating around in your body will affect you too much."  
Shinichi: *Ninja powers* *Perfect eyesight* *Badass makeover*  
Maki: "It seems you have also lost the ability to outwardly cry." 
>> ARTICLE
When migi said 30% of his body went unaccounted for I was thinking shinichi got a prehensile penis.
>> ARTICLE
The episodes are too goddamn short
>> ARTICLE
Another great episode. Not a fan of the battle music though (it also played during the fight with A). I feel like it didn't fit in very well with the scene at all...
>> ARTICLE
Okay okay going to that manga hair style now I see you
>> ARTICLE
This was such a hype episode, that battle had me cheering along the whole time! I hope that the new parasite and host get more screen time because I can see him and Shinishi being an awesome tag team. Can't wait for more great episodes!
>> ARTICLE
Great episode aside from how Uda's parasite talked. I would have thought it would be like a fat goofy man's voice, considering its humor in the manga. They also decided to change its name, which I thought was an odd choice, but that's a small complaint.
>> ARTICLE
the name is correct. [Minor spoiler](/s "rename happens next time they meet.")
>> ARTICLE
Yo!
>> ARTICLE
anyone know how this anime is doing in japan? I always find it interesting to see if there is any disconnect between them and us western audience pplz.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know the song after the ending song? The one playing during the preview for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
What is the OST that starts at around 14:50 on CR. Just as the fight between Shinichi and his Mom starts.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of liked adorkable Shinichi though...
>> ARTICLE
The Sternritter makes it's appearance! 
>> ARTICLE
This show is so good. But enough can't be said about it's opening. Every week I watch and it comes on I get goose bumps; it's got that vibe that lets viewers know that you are about to get into some *serious* shit. It's already too long a wait for the next episode. 

Also, is Mamoru going to play War Machine to Shinichi's Iron Man (Hand)?
>> ARTICLE
UDA u da man! 
>> ARTICLE
Weekly dose of Hirano Aya.
All is good with the world. 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know where i can get the music that plays during the preview montage? diggin that gregorian + tron sound.
>> ARTICLE
I miss Shinichi's original Bill Evans look already. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
A parasitic neck? God that must be inconvenient.  
Looks like not only does Migi make Shinichi stronger and faster, he also makes him sexier. Good job Madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
> A parasitic neck? God that must be inconvenient.

It comes with an unique ultimate tho: It able to shift locations of Uda's organ.
>> ARTICLE
Garshinichi comes.
>> ARTICLE
really intrigued by Shinichi asking Migi if the cells altered his brain. 

I think the effect of that is Shinichi is slowly losing his emotions
>> ARTICLE
So what now? Please dont tell me he is now CRAZY OP and the story is just over.
>> ARTICLE
look, this has the potential to be the best manga/anime in its genre... you think it's going to be that clich?
>> ARTICLE
Well... so far it feels totally like a Japanese adaptation of Spiderman so yeah.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't even dare to touch the manga yet so I know nothing but basing on what our more experienced colleagues said in previous threads in a non spoilerish way we've just only saw the tip of the iceberg. 

I mean, author would be a madman to build this much character develompent and then end it too soon.
>> ARTICLE
Just the tip!?
>> ARTICLE
Bawk bawk.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, anime is like 17 chapters in. There are 64 chapters.
>> ARTICLE
Is this one cour or two?
>> ARTICLE
It's two cours! :D 
>> ARTICLE
And now I'm kind of rooting for the psychic girl :/

I CAN'T WAIT A WEEK FOR THIS FFS
>> ARTICLE
The psychic girl is awesome as hell but I am scared what she will do if/when she finds out about the parasites and with a hype new partner joining the scene I am aware he might be put under the bus too! Let's hope she doesn't do something crazy.
>> ARTICLE
This is so cruel...

Best girl doesn't deserve to be ignored this much.
>> ARTICLE
How long was Shinichi away for him to change? Or was this change all accelerated by the fragments of Migi running through his bloodstream?

>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck I love this show. Anyway, I wonder why Migi didn't kill the other human host. Migi said that he would cut Shinichi's tongue out if he tried to tell people about his hand, but he allowed some other guy to know. I wonder if it's Migi's thirst for knowledge, or the negative impact it would have on Shinichi's mind, but I doubt it. 

In fact I kind of wished the other Parasite couple died. ^^^Don't ^^^kill ^^^me.
>> ARTICLE
Migi always put information first before killing instinct.

Perhaps it implied that it's more valuable keeping Uda & co. alive so they can exchange information periodically.

Also, Uda & co. are not hostile toward Shinichi, so Migi doesn't need to kill to protect his host.
>> ARTICLE
They may not be hostile but didn't Migi threaten Shinichi that he would incapacitate him for simply speaking of him? Isn't that why Shinichi planned to tell his father about Migi while he was asleep originally?
>> ARTICLE
And now another 7 day wait.....MC is finally badass and his progression was logical and greatly paced in my eyes!  MC of the season perhaps?
>> ARTICLE
Boy am I glad for two episodes! 
>> ARTICLE
Best scene was when he turned around and said sup like nothing happened and everything was cool. Also by the time preview of next weeks episode it looks amazing that bully I forgot his name goes after him again and just stops him. This is going to be badass 
>> ARTICLE
That was an excellent episode.

Uda and Parasite seem like a good duo. I like them, which means that they, too, will (presumably) be inevitably killed to make us all suffer :( I was worried that they really were dead this episode, which would have been disappointing, but I'm glad they stuck around. Plus I loved Uda's quote about how Shinichi shouldn't have to kill her, even if he knows it's not actually his mom.

It seems like Shinichi's found some peace now that he's dealt with his mom's killer. Looking forward to seeing what happens next.

Looks like that black haired girl has a parasyte too judging by the ending!

It's called sixth sense yo.

I'm pretty sure Migi said that some humans are more perceptive of the brain waves parasytes emit, such as Murano and Kimishima.

Hence sixth sense. An extra sensory function separate from the five senses normally present in human beings.

Man, that detective must be getting paid really well if he still wants to follow Shinichi after almost getting sliced in half.
>> ARTICLE
i don't think so. i mean you see someone becoming a monster and attacking you, and likely they still want to kill you. can you run away? not really, could be a single monster, could be many(people don't know of the parasites but they know of all the people being killed around) and they all look like people. can you go to police or ask anyone for help? not really, unless you have some evidence.


in the end the best thing is try to figure out wtf is going on, so you can actually come with a way out of this mess.
>> ARTICLE
Idk I'm pretty sure showing up outside a monsters house visibly wounded is not the way to stay alive long enough to figure out anything lol but I do see what you're saying. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I gotta agree with you. Assuming he's some kind of private investigator, this random lady shows up hiring him to look at a seemingly normal kid and then he turns out to be a "monster". It's obvious she knows something about him being a abnormal so if you really wanted to find out info the safer course of action would be that you'd ask her (of course we as the audience would probably assume she'd kill the PI at some point but he doesn't yet know that).
>> ARTICLE
In addition to Alchnator's comment, there is also the part that, because humans don't know about parasytes, that he would feel like he has the chance to safe humanity of a monster. He could saven thousands of lifes.

He better have a shotgun tucked away in that sling if he is hoping to be some kind of hero lol

well it is a 'normal' human being, but i mean, let's face it, it's not going to be normal. That is uncanny obedience for a baby that probably isn't even a year old and if it was truly normal then Ryoko probably wouldn't want to experiment on it like a lab rat

That last scene where Shinichi was behind Murano with Migi, man I fucking lost my shit.
>> ARTICLE
Was Migi actually doing that, though, or was that like a waking dream thing? Cuz he had a scene where everyone was like "you're a monster!!" that never happened, either. I think he's just starting to crack, honestly.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty confident he isn't infected my Migi and is in fact suffering from PTSD.


>> ARTICLE
Little of column A, a little of column B?
>> ARTICLE
No, I truly think he's exhibiting all of the calling signs of PTSD, and Migis  repair job is negligible.

Havin delt with it myself, and having dealt with vets who suffer, this is genuinely how they sometimes act.

Disconnected and lack of emotion

Disinterest in things that used to interest you.

Vivid dreams of past experiences

Feelings of Panic and anxiety as if something bad will happen

Feelings that people may be out to get you

Disconnection with family and friends

The inability to talk about past experiences (some of this is because of Migi)

Avoiding talking about the problems, and brushing it off or stepping around the issue.

**INABILITY TO FOCUS ON ONE THOUGHT**

Anger and a short temper (walking out I the classroom when asked to read)

Jitteriness and Hyper sensitivity (compounded by his new powers)

Lack of sleep

There's more that I'm forgetting.


The fact is that he is exhibiting many, many traits of PTSD. In fact I can't see anything non-physical that stands out in the change he experienced. And rightfully so. Combat vets don't usually have it this bad. He was almost killed by his own mother and watched her die. He lost a friend that he feels responsible for.

Even *Murano* is acting the same way that many people in close contact with the victim do. Because it is a huge change, but from an outsider viewpoint you "can't quite put a finger on it".

**WE KNOW** what Izumi went through because we watched it happen, but others (besides his father) do not, because he won't tell them.... Because his problems with avoidance... ***WHICH IS A CALLIN SIGN OF PTSD***.

The disorder is truly this bad.

No, with the weight Migi has his claw would've gotten stuck in his flesh. A slice was the best Migi could do at that time.

Was it just me, or did Migi get really [out of hand](https://imgur.com/a/jvgqK) in this episode?
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't really make sense for Migi to not have been able to stretch enough to kill that guy. 

[This was Migi in episode 1](http://i.imgur.com/51py8FV.png).  Even after losing 30% of its mass that guy should still have easily been in range.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi was holding him back this time though.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh maybe.
>> ARTICLE
and do keep in mind this is the shinichi that can leep over fences while holding another person. I think this conveyed poorly, but Shinichi probably hgad a lot to do with it.
>> ARTICLE
Animes are bounded by its own physics, but here's my take:

- the first strike was interrupted by Shinichi pulling Migi's trunk causing it to miss critical hit. (this was specifically illustrated in manga)
- after Migi detached himself from Shinichi, he chased for a bit and did a slice. Migi should be as if he is suffocating in this state (as if human are underwater), he is also lack of a pivoting weight (used to be Shinichi's body) for him to swing and hit with force.

>> ARTICLE
Migi's used to using Shinichi's weight to create force behind his strikes. That's why he didn't think to just go for the vitals.
>> ARTICLE
Also remember, Migi had to fuse some of his body to repair Shinichi's heart. We could infer that Migi is not as strong as he used to be, especially because he now has to sleep at times during the day.

Gorgeous artwork and top-notch quality animation, as what you'd expect from KyoAni, with a good storyline. You'll like it if you like romance with a hint of cute girls doing cute things and a tad of comedy. Being a fan of RomCom myself, it's one of my all-time favorites. However, IMHO, the second season pales in comparison compared to the first because of the lack of progress. It's not bad, but not amazing either, albeit still being pretty enjoyable to watch.

>> ARTICLE
I doubt she will die, she is the only thing that's been consistent in his life throughout this ordeal. She is the last shred of his humanity. Then again that's an even bigger death flag.... shit.
>> ARTICLE
From a writer's perspective though, her death would be really detrimental to the show. 

Like you said, she's the last shred of his humanity. She's the show's only representation of the whole "Human Emotions vs. Cold Reason" conflict and that's the entire show's theme. Murano's the only reason that Shinichi ever does a double-take at himself and his behaviour, if her or another character like her didn't exist Shinichi would've gone full "Parasyte Logic" by now.

Sure it's possible that they could introduce a new character or element to kill Murano off and then replace her but with how the development has gone, I can't imagine it being done without looking like an ass-pull.

**edit:** Just to point out to a lot of people, the series has always focused on the Human Emotion vs. Cold Reasoing conflict. Way more than any action sequence. Think back, the 'fights' were pretty tame and not super adrenaline rushing unless there was an ulterior reason; for example the first Parasyte fight (A I think his name was?) was a good way to instill fear in the audience so we actually felt that Parasytes are dangerous, Shinichi's mom was more of an emotional hurdle, that weird smiling guy versus the Yakuza might be an exception but even then he was a solid way to present the "organized Parasyte" as incredibly dangerous even for the Superhuman Shinichi. The show overall has shown it's not a "Shounen Anime" and with Madhouse producing it, it's unlikely that they'll have a sudden change of pace with the show. It's just not consistent with what we've seen so far. That's my opinion but feel free to question it!

She is the Gwen Stacey to his Peter Parker. The only difference is that I see Murano alive at the end of the series.

As it thought it was great to finally get back to parasite and its heart racing action. Kinda surprised how quickly Shinichi has bounced back after the death though.

I dont think Shinichi has been 'infected' by migi...

I think hes so fucking human and he doesnt realize it. I've been suspecting it for a while, but this episode was the nail in the coffin.

He has mother fucking PTSD.

Having gone through the ringer before, this shit is *that* serious.

Even in interpersonal relationships people notice things are different, and even though Murano might have been acting like an annoying  ass people DO respond like that. 

"You arent the same"

Even when confronted about it you respond with 

"yah, no worries, I'm cool."

poor shinichi cant even human, and hes being the fuck out of one. If he wasnt so human he wouldnt have tried to stop Migi from going after that guy.

but shit, chances are the writers arent going to take the opportunity to expand on human problems and emotions to that degree and it will probably just be "migi did it".
>> ARTICLE
It's good to be back. After what happened last episode they really made us look forward to the next. 

Wanna know how to train your kids? Become one with a parasite. Kid won't stop crying, just grab his skull and tell him to be quiet. 

Now that others are gunning for Shinichi. Wonder what their plans are. To think they'd keep getting humans involved, they're pretty sure of themselves.

See Shinichi ran past Murano at school, Kana wouldn't let that slide, she'd confront him then and there. Now Murano is getting more and more nervous about him. I wonder how he tells her in the future.

I don't see it as stupid. Yes the man's a threat, but to just kill him is immoral. Perhaps not the best decision for self-preservation, but the whole theme of Shinichi's behavior is that he his goal isn't purely self preservation. He is willing to sacrifice himself for others.

Well, the secret is out, the investigator knows about Migi, so the organization he works so probably does too.  As much as you want to side with Shinichi not wanting to murder him, it was a terrible idea not to.  
  
Doesn't look like Murano and Shinichi are going to last much longer, I'm surprised she hasn't left earlier, due to the fact that he can't open up about anything to do with Migi. Migi would kill Murano if Shinichi told her the truth.
>> ARTICLE
I guess it won't be the last time Izumi has to decide if he wants to spare an 'innocent' life in order to protect his identity. I wonder if he will get as cold as killing a human or if he keeps valuing human live enough to spare them.
>> ARTICLE
he works for parasite mom, and likely once he talks to her about Migi she will just kill him and hire another guy, she surely don't want people to know about them

Well apparently people started liking it so I have even more back-up karma!

But yeah that's the main reason I try and build it up, if I want to say something and be straight up about it I don't have to worry about losing a shit ton of it.

And we are BACK!

I have always liked the sound of that OST that starts playing when Shinichi walks out of the school building, but it kinda hit me today. How sad, yet wonderful it is.

God I missed this show.

Are we ever going to see Uda again ?   
It seems like he is the only person Izumi could relate to and talk right now.  
 I dont get why he didnt stay in touch with him ?

Looks like detective guy is on the case! I doubt he'll make it through next week.

I think he will survive. He can't be that stupid to get anywhere near Shinichi again..Unless the parasyte who employed him(can someone tell me her name again?) kills him...which I could see happening.
>> ARTICLE
Her name is Reiko Tamura.
>> ARTICLE
> He can't be that stupid to get anywhere near Shinichi again.

Already did...
>> ARTICLE
That was surprising, he had a crutch and a sling.. Yet, he still got near him. And when he was found, he just tried so damn hard to run whilst Shinichi just stood there yelling like a mad man.

Hopefully, he talks it out next episode, before Migi wakes up..

I hope not...I like this OP...also, it is mostly still appropriate....only if Murano dies would it need to get changed.

for the love of all OTP, plz no. Please don't kill Murano

Ah, finally. It feels like forever since we got a new epis- aaaaaaaand it's gone
>> ARTICLE
Migi leaving the body + fighting with Shinichi in the future confirmed?
>> ARTICLE
This show is so tragic.

Kana got the reveal she needed, but didn't deserve. Murano so deserves a reveal, but doesn't *need* it, so she won't get it. 


>> ARTICLE
Murano can't fucking die PLEASE. Also fuck you migi, I can't deal with this lack of empathy
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad to see you still donning the KT-flair. Fun to see you on this subreddit as well.
>> ARTICLE
If Migi does something that people don't like in the future, they cant even hate him properly, they have to hate him like [Madoka Magica Spoiler](/s "Kyubey")
>> ARTICLE
He in some ways seems like a reverse you-know-who. They are both confused by emotion, but Migi is based purely on self preservation, meanwhile YKW isn't concerned for himself, but rather for the universe as a whole, and is willing to sacrifice some for the greater good.

Underwater is 2 episodes behind, fuck it.

HAPPY PARASYTE DAY BITCHES!!!! 

Will edit when I get out of the gym! But it's been too damn long! My Kokoro couldn't take it ;.;

EDIT: I feel so hurt right now. This series is such a god damned whirlwind of emotion. I just want to say that while everyone fucking hates her apparently, I absolutely love MuranoxShinichi dynamic. She wants to be let in, she wants to know and Shinichi will not budge. Meanwhile, Murano is the only humanity that Shinichi has (he feels) and if she's gone he's terrified that he will have lost that. It's one of the best dilemma's I've seen in any Anime. I feel like when Migi is asleep Shinichi WILL tell her, but man oh man, it was fucking terrifying to see Migi nearly try to kill Murano. My heart was pounding, my eyes were wide and I swear I was read to punch a dolphin (don't ask). It's this kind of show that is so gripping that after every single episode I want more. I'm starting to get real tired of Migi's shit man. Real damn tired of it. 

Lets not forget crazy Parasyte mom and the Parasyte equivalent of the Legion of Doom. This is getting really scary guys. Like, character dying scary. I foresee a hole in my heart...and I don't want to see it.
>> ARTICLE
Why Shinichi? Why are you such a blockhead? His inner turmoil is understandable but why the hell won't he try at least to tell Murano that his mother is dead?

He was obviously almost ready to reveal the whole mind blowing issue that would either get Murano killed or terminated their relationship forever. Yet he won't consider telling her about mother. That would explain his resignation, isolation and numbness to feelings.

Because he changed he is able to deal with emotional stuff fast but he stubbornly refuses to go that way, the only explanation is he lost a lot of empathy and isn't able to comprehend that telling about it would redeem him a lot. Maybe not entirely but a lot. Too bad.
>> ARTICLE
There are some things I do not understand, despite having his feelings "changed" and stuff, I guess it's norm for a human to say that his mother died, I'm not even talking about mentioning that she was a parasyte cause that's a bit too much information. Imo this will end like it did with Kana, she wasn't informed about sh*t and then what? She's dead. Well, I can't wait to see what happens next nonetheless. 
>> ARTICLE
You'd think the guy would have learned to not trifle after almost getting killed by a parasite.  Yet, he goes back to his goddamn house to continue spying on him.  Dumbass needs to be taught a lesson.  Taught all the way.
>> ARTICLE
I'm appreciating the soundtrack so much more now that it's been awhile, I actually missed it and was happy to hear it all again :)

I really gotta say that the PI doesn't seem very sneaky just standing next to telephone poles like they completely hide him.

God the ending made me so uncomfortable, migi was so damn annoying, I really need a satisfying ending to this please :"( I don't want to see Murano dying ...

Dam'it, why's this show so good?!! I wasn't expect to tear up on the last scene but ;-;

THAT BABY IS GONNA FUCK SHIT UP
>> ARTICLE
That's some serious dedication from that detective. He was sliced up by a creepy alien monster, has to use a crutch, and is still trying to investigate. Not sure if a champ or an idiot.
>> ARTICLE
A calm episode. I really can't wait to see how Murano finds out about things. It's also interesting how we got to see Migi actually try to kill someone for seeing them. Also, that "trained baby." The nanny was terrified. That internal conflict at the end there was great. I don't even think Migi's claws were really out, that was just the conflict in Shininchi's mind and what would happen if he actually told her. 
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion it was Migi showing Izumi what would happen if he comes out their secret. Migi would probably be fast enough to vanish at the moment Murano turned around. 
>> ARTICLE
daumn thats some character development!
>> ARTICLE
From the episode Title I expected some sort of emotional breakdown for shinichi or some kind of emotional release that he just cant have since migi repaired his heart.


>> ARTICLE
KUYASHI!

He hat-nevermind

It's been a long time.  :') 

Great episode as usual.  
>> ARTICLE
After these past few eps I think I see why its one of the best 2014 shows
>> ARTICLE
I'm really loving the dynamic between shinichi and migi, And it looks like there's going to be a few massive conflicts of interest coming up in the next few episodes. I'm loving it.

That last scene had me hyperventilating though, fuck you Migi, not Murano. >:(


>> ARTICLE
I think that Murano needs to have a Hatoko style breakdown where she just vents her feelings all at once to Shinichi so that he'll understand more about here situation and concern for him. A situation like that would pose as a really good ultimatum for Shinichi so he can choose the path his relationship with Murano will go. I personally didn't really like Kana as much as many people seemed to just because she somewhat stuck her foot in the door known as Shinichi's life, then proceeded to pretty much stalk him, not follow his instructions to NOT use her power as it would be very dangerous [Parasyte Ep. 12 Spoilers](/s "and then get killed"). In my opinion, Murano could really benefit from something big happening to her character in terms of strengthening her relationship with Shinichi. I'm somewhat new to watching anime regularly, so I'm not seasoned in understanding well thought character developed, so this just states my opinion. Feel free to disagree :D Btw, I don't think I can get enough of the OP :P

Well if you don't like it you could just leave.
>> ARTICLE
\*Actually leaves\*
>> ARTICLE
So, Shinichi is somewhere between Spiderman and Batman now. Having those he cares about die? That's to get him going. Having those he tries to protect die *because* he was close to them? That's to make him buckle up, and fill him with reminders of his mortality, but you know you only made it when you have to turn away those you care for, when you do it *yourself*.

The price is being paid.

Also, damn, that poor baby.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just curious, how well is the anime following the manga so far? And if there are some differences, how significant are they?
>> ARTICLE
It's staying pretty close to the manga save for some modernization changes and side character info (Maki's backstory was cut out, for example). In fact this episode had one of the biggest differences (imo) so far because in the manga after Shinichi sees the detective run away a second time [chapter 34 details](/s "He actually pulls out a knife and is about to chop his arm off before realizing that he sort of sees Migi as a friend and can't do it.") Not too big a change in terms of overall plot, but it makes for a rather different character portrayal.
>> ARTICLE
Finally, some more Migi action again; I was starting to get worried that Migi was becoming redundant and going to get completely replaced by Shinichi. Murano continues to act like a normal concerned person would for someone that they care about and don't understand (and is still somehow continually hated for that acting like that by most of the audience, unlike Darwin Award-worthy Kana).
>> ARTICLE
> Murano continues to act like a normal concerned person would for someone that they care about and don't understand

I don't think that's how she acts -- normal person would have more intelligence behind the questions.  At best she is a caricature of normality.  Edit: Up to before this episode.  Haven't seen it yet :(.

Dammit, Shinichi really needs to sort his shit out with Murano. Just tell her and everything will be fine! Or possibly Migi will kill her. Maybe.  
Also, Tamiya Ryoko is a terrifying parent.
>> ARTICLE
I like how nobody cares about how fucked up that baby scene was. Overall this episode hit the spot.
>> ARTICLE
Had to wait two weeks for a new episode and it did not disappoint. I was right there with Shinichi emotionally; I'm loving the battle happening within his emotional framework. Having the ability to recover from any emotional or traumatic event almost instantly must wreck havoc on one's psyche. When he wanted to come clean with Murano so badly in the end I was dying inside, hoping he would just do it. But he stays the course feigning innocence. Really felt for Murano; it's clear she's an intelligent and observant gal and it sucks seeing her get the runaround (even though it's for her own safety). I really hope it works out for those two at some point.

That Tamya...she freaks me out. I don't expect a single good thing to come from her as this show goes on. That scene with her kid pretty much summed her up: everything is a plaything for her to manipulate. 

Is it next week yet? I need more...
>> ARTICLE
I like how that detective "hid" behind a pole that can barely cover half his body

He is a prisoner in his own body schinichi

Honestly, it isn't entirely unrealistic that someone would act calm and cool after witnessing a murder. Some people might be desensitized to this sort of thing after already watching their mother die. At the very least, tt certainly isn't enough evidence to think "yeah, this guys definitely hiding something".
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I've written about animeI dipped my toes into critical writing about anime last season with the first two episodes of Parasyte, but quickly found myself overwhelmed with other work. I'm pulling the socks off again and trying again, this time trying to produce something a bit less demanding of time. I'm used to taking extensive notes for my [Digimon podcast](http://podigious.com), and figured I'd take some inspiration from /u/bobduh and turn those notes themselves into the final product.

I was pretty pumped by Parasyte in my initial reviews ([Ep 1](http://jeffinitelymedia.tumblr.com/post/99637365999/parasyte-ep-1) | [Ep 2](http://jeffinitelymedia.tumblr.com/post/100226418444/parasyte-ep-2)). In some ways, my excitement has cooled since thenI still think the show is consistently good, but not great or amazing.

### Episode Notes

 - [00:39](http://i.imgur.com/QvjCZWt.png)  These flashbacks clearly imply his mind is still capable of a decent level of regret and sadness, regardless of whether his physical body is capable of manifesting that with tears.
 - [00:48](http://i.imgur.com/PzCUzYG.png)  Yup, he stumbles into Satomi while feeling regret about Kana -- I always found the "rivalry" between Kana and Satomi odd, because the affection was so one-sided, and seeing Shinichi's concern for her not dying misinterpreted as affection was kind of annoying, but it's interesting to see her ghost still hurting his relationship with Satomi (we'll have to see if it actually will or if this is just in the days immediately after her death)
 - [00:56](http://i.imgur.com/MUHaDDb.png)  Um, that's not what okay looks like, Murano
 - [01:26](http://i.imgur.com/5vddKWf.png)  That foot doesn't look ominous at all.
 - [03:12](http://i.imgur.com/a89xv6x.png)  The situation of parasites at this pointhow we've mostly settled into a world where a host murdering out of immediate hunger is the exception, not the normreminds me of The Walking Dead and how, as time elapses, more and more of the remaining survivors should be those that are very smart and able to adapt (or, you know, it could just remind me of evolution).
 - [03:26](http://i.imgur.com/wrWJvAU.png)  Really like the idea of the parasites thinking strategically about how every discovered parasite gives the humans more information.
 - [04:51](http://i.imgur.com/ptYl7Sr.png)  Wow. My cat's been whining endlessly the past couple days, and I've been so tempted to do this to shut him up. Also, he started reacting to the baby crying by whining even more.
 - [05:02](http://i.imgur.com/Gs8q8Fo.png)  Pretty cool how they played with our expected reaction of "oh god she's abusing the baby!"
 - [05:15](http://i.imgur.com/2Bleu4G.png)  The stark contrast of the cute baby face and Tamura's extremely cold observational face, combined with the line treating the baby as a scientific experiment is great.
 - [07:08](http://i.imgur.com/h8UHG4U.png)  I'm trying to figure out the significance of the classmate asking this stuff about Satomi (except that he doesn't get along super well with his other male classmates, which we kind of inferred). I think it's another side of the coin of everyone trying to pry him to find out stuff about himcomplimenting Tamura's hiring a PI to investigate his life and thugs to test his combat ability by showing that even his classmates are curious about his life.
 - [08:17](http://i.imgur.com/7U6nato.png)  I've read a couple complaints about last episode for the series reducing another female character into cliche motivation for the male protagonist (and piling on the "I want to cry but I can'tttttt" train that the show's been riding for a while now), but I'm starting to think that that's not what Kana's death was about at all. I think the major point of it was to take the seed of doubt Satomi had about Shinichi's relationship with Kana, drive it deep into her heart, and seal it in there. In some respects, Kana being dead should be a relief to Satomi's suspicions, but, on the other hand, it means that she can never confront Kana and hear the full story, and the one side of the story she can hear (Shinichi's) is the one side she's increasingly becoming afraid of fully trusting. And then there's the added complication of all of this doubt and anxiety of betrayal being mixed and tainted with murder and supernatural powers (*and* Shinichi being unreasonably calm about everything)all signs point to Shinichi being involved in the murder somehow, which is just an added layer of complication to Satomi's feelings. So, yeah, the more I think about it the more it seems Kana's death was to add emotional complexity to Satominot Shinichiwhich makes me much more comfortable with the whole fridged woman problem.
 - [08:53](http://i.imgur.com/LtJK6wF.png)  As I suspected, Tamura was trying to read into Shinichi's combat performance. But I'm still curious of her intentwas she just trying to determine his non-Migi combat ability (recall Migi performing combat ability calculations when he was fighting the rival school thugs in episode 5), or was she trying to see at what point he would break and resort to using Migi?
 - [09:20](http://i.imgur.com/vQDMWuF.png)  Gotta love how Migi made a little mini-hand in order to use a mouse. I wonder if he'd have any trouble using a right-handed mouse, since his little mini-hand is a left hand.
 - [09:28](http://i.imgur.com/YpExjgl.png)  I love how he came to the realization that of course Satomi is upset about Kana after thinking about it for a while, like it was a problem he was working through and solved. So very different from a normal emotional reaction.
 - [09:35](http://i.imgur.com/GGSHjbg.png)  Also love how, from Migi's perspective, Shinichi still seems completely human. It's interesting to contrast this Satomi's constant questions about whether he's changed and the ability of Tamura's mother's host to detect herhumans seem to be much better at detecting minor differences in behavior and able to detect when something is "off". And yet we also have Turano's PI being unable to notice anything suspicious about Shinichi earlier in the episodeI guess it comes down to professional vs. personal relationships.
 - [09:52](http://i.imgur.com/DvyhQhp.png)  Why has this never been a problem before?
 - [10:15](http://i.imgur.com/lBeiYYr.png)  Totes not suspicious. I barely even noticed there was a person there. 
 - [11:37](http://i.imgur.com/wxY928E.png)  This show is so totes about growing up. Who hasn't had a pang of guilt and regret realizing that something they consider minor and unimportant used to be an extremely big deal? It's a little unsettling how so much of Shinichi's transformation into an alien monster mirrors our transformation into adults.

 - [12:35](http://i.imgur.com/PdACFQn.png)  Even though it's a bit on-the-nose, I love how it's the moment when Shinichi decides to force himself to act more human (several studies show that putting on a fake smile increases happiness, blah blah blah) that he gets discovered and has to make his first really difficult decision of whether to kill someone to keep his secret. Suddenly his whole world is flipped from emo manpain to weighing murder against the possibility of keeping someone silent.
 - [12:51](http://i.imgur.com/liyEUEX.png)  I remember this scene in Tokyo Ghoul.
 - [13:14](http://i.imgur.com/VQfoJTm.png)  Awww, he's so cute. Parasitesgotta catch 'em all!
 - [13:34](http://i.imgur.com/yaNK0dD.png)  I love how Migi devotes 2 eyes to staring down Shinichi, and pops out a 3rd (quivering) one to try to follow Tamura's dude, who's gone out of sight.
 - [14:10](http://i.imgur.com/6KAwdKp.png)  It's quite convenient (for the writers) how quickly his fatigue sets in
 - [14:14](http://i.imgur.com/EGh0vmI.png)  Something tells me there will have to be a dramatic exception to this proclamation before the series ends.
 - [15:40](http://i.imgur.com/UWer9Vd.png)  Huh, so he's still incredibly afraid of being exposed and people rejecting him because he's a monster. That's very surprising. I would've thought he'd be long past the opinions of his classmates, but I guess he's still so unsure about his own humanity that the really important part isn't the classmates but about them considering him a monster.
 - [15:42](http://i.imgur.com/7ujWd99.png)  Yeah, but they taste really good. Don't judge it until you try.
 - [15:58](http://i.imgur.com/qWN4972.png)  This dream sequence and snapping out to realize the teacher is calling on him felt extremely juvenile compared to the rest of the show.
 - [16:10](http://i.imgur.com/BoAwj6d.png)  Seems like Shinichi's losing the ability to read subtext (everyone seems surprised he interpreted the teacher's "I don't want you here" to actually mean he should leave)
 - [16:22](http://i.imgur.com/jBGrGgu.png)  It's interesting how emotional his reaction to being potentially discovered seems, *especially* in comparison to his reaction to Kana's death. As his ability to feel empathy decreases, his inclination for self-defense increases.
 - [16:31](http://i.imgur.com/7i7rtNt.png)  Why is he so afraid of becoming a lab rat? I recall speculating way back in episode 2 or 3 that his reasoning of not going to the police to maintain his peaceful way of life would eventually be turned on its head as he got more and more entangled in the parasites' affairs, and would eventually long for the days when he could have just come clean and avoided so much death and destruction (and at that point going to the police and/or doctors and losing a hand or being studied would feel like a small price to pay). Some of that speculation has come to pass with his mother's and Kana's deaths, though the former was much more impactful and wasn't directly caused by his parasitic involvement. So I find it bizarre that he still fears being tested. I could understand not wanting to turn himself in because of fear of not being believed or of being accused of murders he didn't commit, but worry over being studied feels like an odd concern from the show's very early peaceful days.
 - [16:33](http://i.imgur.com/Tm7Gojp.png)  Ah, interesting. So being studied would actually put him more at risk because other parasites would want to keep that information secret. I hadn't considered that, and it does make some degree of sense. Though I do wonder if it would be natural to assume that parasites were banding together to protect the publicly leaked information about themselvesbut I guess it's a natural assumption once Migi learned multiple parasitic hosts won the recent election.
 - [16:47](http://i.imgur.com/ZjCe8Ak.png)  Cutting off his arm while Migi was asleep could kill Migi, but it would never reverse the bits of Migi that are inside Shinichi's blood. It's oddafter that transformation, I kind of assumed the two were irreversibly linked, so it feels very strange to me to be back to this position of Shinichi considering whether to go to the police and whether to betray Migi. This all feels like deja vu of the first couple episodes. I'm not sure that's accidentalbut where is this deja vu headed? Are we supposed to realize how much has changed since the early episodes?
 - [16:54](http://i.imgur.com/f5U4uHg.png)  Awwww
 - [17:26](http://i.imgur.com/xi2O2kq.png)  So. damn. incospicuous.
 - [18:49](http://i.imgur.com/ypdElNz.png)  Do you know what series you're in, Satomi?
 - [19:33](http://i.imgur.com/N73v9Uk.png)  This just makes me think about how superhero comics so rarely portray real relationships, because writing a healthy relationship where both sides share everything and yet experience pain and misunderstanding and drama is much harder than forcing one side to keep a Big Dark Secret that he must brood over and drawing most of the emotional conflict from that.
 - [21:08](http://i.imgur.com/mur9WRj.png)  Um, what? I guess the point of the climactic lead up and abrupt drop to this was symbolizing the danger she'd face if she were to tell her the truth.
 - [21:20](http://i.imgur.com/dsWOu0N.png)  The attention to detail of their eyes in this series is really great. I'm kind of sick of very detailed shows like Darker than Black and Fate/stay Night UBW that frequently feel like they should be using eyes to convey information about the character, but that are held back by art styles where some characters just have soulless eyes for the fun of it. It's especially great in this series because we have examples across a wide spectrum from the human characters, to Shinichi, to the parasites that blend in (but feel a *little* off), to the parasites that don't pass for humans (and then there's the eyes of humans who have had the love sucked out of their lives, like Shinichi's dad).

### Concluding Thoughts

So what actually happened this episode? Shinichi regrets not feeling worse about Kana, gets caught by Tamura's private investigator, contemplates how to react, and buckles down on not telling Satomi about his secret. In light of some of the series' epic roller coasters and (albeit very telegraphed) surprise deaths, this week was *very* slow. And yet I thoroughly enjoyed it, and felt like I learned a lot this episodethough this is almost undoubtably because this is the first time since episode 3 that I've kept detailed notes. Parasyte is at its best when its attention to detail allows it to explores themes while balanced against horrific parasite transformations and menacing battles. The horror and the battles may be simplistic and rather mindless at times, but they help make an episode stand out, and with a notable absence of both, this episode felt extremely unmemorable, despite how well I thought it competently iterated on the themes and questions the show is tackling.

Kind of a calmer episode but I liked it nonetheless.

It looks like the struggle to maintain humanity is real. Even Shinichi's trying to convince *himself* that he isn't slowly losing it.

Migi continues to be the paragon of logic before morality

Best Murano scene in the show so far by miles. This character was starting to bug the fuck out of me so hopefully we're going to start seeing some redemption here. Unfortunately it looks like the death flag is slowly climbing.

Curious to see where they're going to go with what I'm assuming is the endgame with this organized coalition of parasytes. They've paid the most attention to Ryouko so I'm assuming that that will be the next big conflict that we see.

How long did we just wait for this episode? Feels like forever
>> ARTICLE
Getting real tired of Shinichi's transparency and Murano in general. This episode was in poor quality compared to the rest of the series but damn if it wasn't good nonetheless.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else think migi was really daft to try for a slicing motion when he attacked? Surely a stabbing motion would be the way to go? And for migi, the king of logic that he is, It felt like a mistake he wouldn't make.
>> ARTICLE
It was well worth the wait and now the story is really coming together.

Curious to see how the parasites will fit into society since this is what their group is going for currently. I will say.. that baby scene just showed how socially awkward they are as it stands.

And of course Migi's existence might leak out now which adds a whole new layer to the tension.

On another note Murano x Shinichi interactions have evolved past the 'you really are Shinichi right?' which is also pretty great.

Overall, I'm looking forward for more episodes!

What do you guys think? Was it the right choice to leave the investigator alive? The evidence was destroyed and Shinichi still passes the hair test. I wonder how Ryoko would have reacted if Shinichi and Migi killed the investigator...

Parasyte is back from taking a week off, and it does not disappoint. I was worried for Murano there... But it seems like Migi would not be willing to trust her (or anyone) with Shinichi's secret. I'm not sure they're even familiar with the concept of trust.

Looking forward to seeing what happens next, especially now that this PI has seen Shinichi's hand transform.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, if anyone does find out their secret, Migi is basically dead. From Migi's point of view, it's entirely reasonable to cut Murano down if she found out, as it simply isn't safe. 

That said, someone kind of already found out so any further action in either direction seems somewhat pointless.
>> ARTICLE
> To be fair, if anyone does find out their secret, Migi is basically dead. From Migi's point of view, it's entirely reasonable to cut Murano down if she found out, as it simply isn't safe. 

I'm saying Migi and the parasites aren't really willing to trust other humans with the knowledge of what they are, for pretty much exactly that reason. I'm thinking that Shinichi might be willing to trust her not to tell anyone the truth, but Migi is not so willing.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi seems to definitely trust her, but he really can't tell her 'cause there's a real chance that Migi will kill her. He's in quite the situation.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, pretty much. Especially bad for Shinichi because it seems like he's barely holding on to his sanity at this point.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's probably more likely that Shinichi breaks and gives into the Parasyte ways before Migi gives into the human ways, but that's only as of right now. I can't really tell with the tone of the story whether there will be a happy ending or not, and that will probably determine what side the coin falls on.

Another really cool episode ! Parasyte does not disappoint. 
>> ARTICLE
11/10 would rate again

I feel like Shinichi and Migi are going to go head to head (or head to hand) pretty soon and Murano is going to end up seriously hurt. Letting that investigator live is definitely the catalyst. Can't wait to see what next week brings.

It's not like she could know her questions being dangerous enough for Migi to threaten Izumi with her death. I find it rather understandable that she wants to find out about his problems.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was bullshit. It's already been established that Shinichi can detect human beings with ease with his enhanced senses, and yet he can't detect a private investigator that's right on his ass. This episode is completely contrived, it is inconsistent with the established plot points and I am very disappointed in this series because of it. 
>> ARTICLE
He was heavily distracted about reminiscing over Kana's death and his own humanity.  He could only pick out the PI's heartbeat later because he was listening specifically for it.  While it's a slight stretch that Shinichi didn't hear the PI *during a quiet-ish night time context*, it's not completely batshit crazy.
>> ARTICLE
I can see that, but you still have to admit, he has to be *really* off his game if he can't detect this guy when they're more or less completely alone.
>> ARTICLE
> he has to be really off his game 

Shinichi still persists to blame himself for Kana's death. I would say he is quite off.

Also, the detective is a professional himself, we reader/viewer can assume that he knows how to minimise his existence in a scene. As long as he is not emitting malicious intends, he should be able to stay low profile.

Lastly, what's already been mentioned... It is explicitly stated that Shinichi can only go into super hearing mode when he really focus on it. 
>> ARTICLE
> I would say he is quite off.

I'm kind of debating if this is a good enough excuse though. He *is* off, without a doubt, but just because hes off doesn't me he should be completely oblivious to his surroundings. Is being traumatized a good enough excuse to ignore the fact that someone has tailed you on a completely empty street and building compound? Maybe, but it definitely is weak. Same goes to Migi, hes usually quite observatory and he has no reason to be off his game.

The detective, I argue, while professional, is not completely low profile. He didn't seem to be any less noticeable than a normal person and didn't seem to do anything incredibly stealthily. There's also the fact that he screamed when he saw Migi, which, while completely normal, is probably not the wisest/most low profile thing to do. Again, he *could* be low profile, but as the point above, this can really be seen both ways and isn't clearly stated.



>> ARTICLE
You can always make up context for the mangaka but that doesn't excuse anything. If they really cared about consistency, they would have emphasized how distracted he was.

I also would care to mention that Migi, who is the most careful person in the series, also didn't notice him. You would think that he would, even if he wasn't a parasite. I wouldn't be surprised if later in the series Migi or Shinichi will notice someone who's much more conspicuous, just because it's convenient to the storyline.
>> ARTICLE
\>I also would care to mention that Migi, who is the most careful person in the series, also didn't notice him.

In one of the episodes migi comments on shiniji's hearing for noticing something he himself did not hear.
>> ARTICLE
The whole problem is people are saying shinji's hearing is like that of a normal person if he's not concentrating. Which is just absolutely ridiculous. My point is working under the assumption of that being true.
>> ARTICLE
\>The whole problem is people are saying shinji's hearing is like that of a normal person if he's not concentrating.

This is correct. He doesn't hear "louder" he can focus in on specific sounds.

It's kind of hard to explain it.

Your brain subconsciously ignores a lot of sound waves that enter your ears.

For example: I'm listening to music, but if I concentrate on other sounds I hear my AC, my keyboard as I type, my chair creaking. 

Shinji can more easily activate his hearing to translate soundwaves that his brain would otherwise ignore, but he needs to concentrate.

You need to picture his ear drum as an instrument that is more precise.

Try this next time you are in a crowded room: See how many conversations you can listen to at the same time.

It's extremely hard, and you have to choose which conversation you want to eaves drop on to hear it.

Normally your brain just ignores the sound waves as unimportant, but they still enter your ear.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, so your previous point is now invalid, since you agree that Shinichi's hearing was normal during that scene.

edit: Also, your reasoning is flawed, since he can hear something as subtle as the PI's breathing from outside his house. You can't do that no matter how precise your hearing is; the sound waves are too weak to even register for a normal person. He can definitely hear better than a normal person if he tries to.
>> ARTICLE
My god do I ever want to slap Murano in the face sometimes. Like, you know there are murderous parasites kicking around, you *clearly* know Izumi just found somebody killed by one and you must at least think there's a chance he's a parasite too. Why would you keep prodding and prodding?? 

And poor Izumi, just [unable to do anything he wants.](http://i.imgur.com/iQ1EASP.png) Migi's really taking it up a notch this episode with the whole "let's kill everything" side of him.
>> ARTICLE
Migi doesn't have anything close to a "let's kill everything" mentality, he simply highly values self preservation.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, everything threatening*  An important distinction for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that Murano not thinking he is a parasyte is quite natural. After all, almost noone knows anything about them. Coming to the conclusion that he cheated on her with Kana is a lot simpler.
>> ARTICLE
I understand that and it's a valid point. So why not just ask him straight up? "Was there anything between you and Kana?"   
Granted, she wouldn't believe him anyway. I don't know. If you can never trust somebody how can you continue to be with them? I'm shocked she hasn't left already.
>> ARTICLE
\>So why not just ask him straight up?

lol... Directness like that is actually shunned in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
Could be that she doesn't want to ask and trusted him enough for there to have been nothing.

And I'm fairly sure their relationship is over...unless Shinichi somehow manages to tell her without Migi ever realizing...and thats unlikely. The risk of telling her would be too high.

>> ARTICLE
Kana was a stalker with complete disregard for her own safety despite being warned numerous times.
>> ARTICLE
how was kana supposed to know that she had the ability to detect parasites? she was never directly told, hell all she knew was that she had an uncanny ability to locate people (including shinichi) and since she was already interested in shinichi beforehand because of his irrational bravery, there's no reason to blame her for acting the way she did imo. she's curious, who wouldn't be in that situation?

she's also a high-schooler, but then again so is murano. and since she's a high schooler, she thinks that her detection powers are ordained or some shit, but that's fine. for me, kana's powers and curiosity > murano's empathy (an empathy that [i personally think is inherently selfish](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2rnh70/spoilers_kiseijuu_sei_no_kakuritsu_episode_13/cnhjgd9))
>> ARTICLE
She was told in the episode she died. At roughly the 7:50 mark Shinji hits his hand to confirm Migi is asleep and explicitly tells her "You're sensing monsters that will kill you, and that includes one in my right hand". Its paraphrased as Shinji narrating "I told her everything I knew about Parasytes" and cuts to him finishing talking about how Migi failed to get his brain.  
>> ARTICLE
but the issue is that she doesn't believe him right? the way I saw it, she just went along with it,  but she wanted proof... it's been a bit since I saw that episode,  but wasn't the plan for migi to reveal himself to her but then she died suddenly. I mean realistically speaking,  it's easier for her to think "we are fated that's why I can detect him"  than for her to believe "my right hand is a parasite that's why you can detect me"  because she was told without proof

also those fantasy dreams didn't help..maybe that's why I liked her so much,  those dreams were fucking hilarious, and the way that her death mirrored it was also really cool (aside from the fact that she died in the first place).  i really just think the way kana was built into the show was so much better than his current love interest, she's much more interesting and feels less generic 
>> ARTICLE
You're right in that she didn't believe him, but she had been told/warned and there were clear indicators that her "ability" to sense him wasn't because he was her destined partner. Primarily the fact that she runs into other people while sensing "him" on a regular basis. 

I preferred Kana over Murano as a character, but she was blinded by her emotions and that lead to her death. Not a lack of information. A young girl got lovestruck, acted irrationally, and got herself killed. Its not unbelievable and fits in quite well with the shows theme which IMO makes her an even better character. 
>> ARTICLE
everything can be argued to be inherently selfish. but if you see things that way then you lose all faith in everything.
>> ARTICLE
While I liked Kana more, I find Murano a better character. The relationship between Shinichi and her is much deeper and unlike Kana, she actually shows signs of being concerned. Kana simply acted out of curiosity all the time.
>> ARTICLE
Both Murano and Kana were caricatures of their archetype.  I think that Kana had a lot more development so far, to Murano's expense.  Up through ep12 Murano was basically a foil for Kana, and a really flat and shallow one at that.

In other words, I don't think Murano is a better character.  She's basically a broken record and the one highlight event prior to this episode was Shinichi going on a date with her, focusing on Shinichi's attempt to maintain his connection to humanity.  That's very little contribution or demonstration of "depth", etc, IMO.

But, best girl 2014 was set up to die and accomplished her goal per se, so ...
>> ARTICLE
i mean both of them are pretty selfish to be fair

kana's motivations and curiosity were (in the beginning at least) motivated by "oh why didn't he back down even though it was a lost fight". after that the curiosity enhanced because she had an extremely unique ability for a human. 

murano isn't unique in any way, and her motivations are, imo, much more base because it's so romantically involved. her thought process feels like this: "oh i like you", "oh i like you but you're not the same guy that i started liking so now i'm confused", "oh i like you but since i'm meek i have trouble communicating", "oh i like you but suddenly there's this other girl that you cancelled our date to meet and then she died but i thought you liked me why can't you tell me everything even though you've probably been through emotional hell".

for me, that feels so selfish of murano, and i'm much more sympathetic of kana and her attachments to shinichi because the detection aspect really makes her much more unique. not to mention that until this episode, migi had no reason to care about murano; kana on the other hand was an aberration and of great interest to migi,it could have brought a really cool dynamic between the three of them if she wasn't killed off so early

also sigh downvotes for opinions w/e

This episode felt a bit lacking to me, and it had the ARE YOU REALLY SHINICHI again. I feel like this is a death flag for murano, i really hope it is. They kill kana who was unique, fun and understanding but they leave such an annoying prick alive.

He was actually saying "or "Masu demo kaitetanoka?"  which is an old, figurative way of saying masturbating.

What's the literal translation in that case?
>> ARTICLE
The  in that sentence, is it the "to scratch"-?

Plus, what would be a more modern way of saying it? Not exactly the most important vocab, but I'm curious.
>> ARTICLE
The old version of this idiom was kind of a slang that started in the Japanese middle age.  It was never assigned a proper kanji, so it is always written in hiragana. Therefore, it's quite difficult to determine whether it means to scratch or it's just part of the phrase that meant something else back in the day. 

But based on the only available kanji that fits the context, I would say that the  in this case means to scratch. 


There are various ways of saying it like in English but here are some more "modern" ones:

" (as in the german word Onanie)
"(Shorten version of "")
" (it's actually an onomatopoeia for masturbation like "fapping")

" or "" also work.

To say jerk off "" is very common now.

Well, remember the way Tamiya Ryoko was perplexed by how her host's mother saw right through her actually being Tamiya Ryoko? I've a feeling that was sort of a theme of this episode. That there was something more than just how a person sounds and how a person looks that makes them who they are. The parasitic species isn't able to comprehend things like personality or "the soul".

So perhaps the flashback/backstory was to demonstrate how close Shinichi was to his mother, so that she doesn't seem like some crackpot when she basically goes "Are you even my son?" I assume this is so that Migi gets a first-hand account the same way Ryoko did that humans have a way of noticing slight changes in a person's behaviour when they know them intimately. The very fact that his mother notices or even cares that something strange is happening to her son probably perplexes Migi, and these creatures seem incredibly curious (KININARIMASU) about why humans do the silly things they do (silly from the objective view of a parasitic species, that is). Perhaps it's to foreshadow the parasitic species exhibiting a human quality at some point. Another piece of evidence to support this possibility is the last scene showing Ryoko holding her tummy, saying "It moved".

I hope she doesn't eat it. ;_; WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THIS TURNED INTO A SLICE OF LIFE COMEDY SHOWING THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF A PARASITIC ALIEN CREATURE RAISING HER ADORABLE HUMAN DAUGHTER? It'd be like Usagi Drop, only with more indiscriminate slaughter. "Moooooom, that's the eleventh person you've eaten just because they're bullying me. I'll have no classmates if you keep this up. T_T"

Anyway, that tangent aside, every time a main character gets backstory, it's not always for the purposes of killing them the next episode. A lot of the time it's to illustrate something completely different. Also, it's not like his parents are background characters!

>> ARTICLE
> That there was something more than just how a person sounds and how a person looks that makes them who they are.

This isn't just a theme, this is an actual human thing. You have the sound and look but you also have a personality/psyche. Tamiya's parasyte was not able to replicate this personality and was seen through by someone close to her host. 

The second paragraph is a lot of shit that is right so I have nothing to add.

> I hope she doesn't eat it

You jinxed it, she's going to eat it now.

> WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THIS TURNED INTO A SLICE OF LIFE COMEDY SHOWING THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF A PARASITIC ALIEN CREATURE RAISING HER ADORABLE HUMAN DAUGHTER? 

This would make parasyte the GOAT for that insane plot twist.

> Anyway, that tangent aside, every time a main character gets backstory, it's not always for the purposes of killing them the next episode. A lot of the time it's to illustrate something completely different. Also, it's not like his parents are background characters!

The parents will DIE, trust me, I'm a self proclaimed expert in the study of death flags, those in my field consider me the best /s

But seriously, one of them will die I'm almost positive, this show is going to make Shinichi have to deal with shit fast and it's going to be difficult stuff.

I'm enjoying watching Shinichi slowly change. I figure its the abrupt personality change and sketchy behavior that his mom noticed. Parasyte reminding people everywhere that moms are mind readers. I wonder what Shinichis directive is...
>> ARTICLE
["Mom, knock first!"](http://imgur.com/f1tRV4q)

Shinichi's Mom is worrying about him, and she definitely knows that something is up. If Ryoko's Mom was also any indication, it seems to be the "mother's intuition" that is letting them know that something just isn't quite right.

An important question they brought up this time was a rather philosophical one: what does it mean to live? What is our purpose in life? It's a strange question because for many people you are going to get many different answers. Even Shinichi wasn't really able to answer the question right away.

I had one gripe with the episode, and that was the pacing. It seemed rather off for the first 12 minutes, but the second half was fine. Something about them just skipping everything after the battle and Ryoko confronting Shinichi after "quitting" didn't flow very well.

Today's episode focused on mothers a lot, and I think there's a reason for that. It's cliche as hell, but I betting they will have Ryoko join the good side in a couple of episodes when she realizes she's developing these same "motherly instincts" for the child she's carrying.

Now that would certainly be interesting.

I think it's great that his parents actually care, I've seen so many Shows, where Parents are not even shown once, it makes the whole Series really feel alive.
Sadly they probably die soon, I guess? I see some death flags waving :/

Also... Not only do his parents care... **THEY ARENT FUCKING RETARDED**!!!

They aren't just some silly plot device, they actually feel like real human beings.
>> ARTICLE
That was a good episode. The parents tripped some death flags. I've noticed Shinichi is becoming more assertive now and less afraid of the things. I'm curious to see how he changes over the course of the show. At the end of the OP he looks completely different.

Also the beating the monkey was hilarious.

Yup. In fact in the opening we see Shinichi no longer using glasses. I'm guessing that means he'll get his vision corrected by turning more parasyte-ish soon.

Perhaps. Though apparently in the manga [not a spoiler](/s "he's never wearing glasses to begin with"). I haven't read it, though, just going off people's comments from the original PV.

I've seen a couple panels from the manga while looking over a friends screen in computer class. [Not a Spoiler] (/s "Can confirm that he doesn't wear glasses.")

> Ryoko said Shinichi wasn't 'pure' anymore.

Not only that, they zoomed into his eye and showed a similar image to what we saw when it zoomed into her eye. Combined that with the cat incident, I think that while Migi failed and only took his right arm/hand, having Migi connected to him is probably slowly infecting him, or mixing the two together.

they did a good job of making the parents feel real. i'm guessing that burn is going to play into the story somehow, it sure seems like it will. another migi perhaps?

perhaps if/when his mom dies and becomes a host, the parasite won't copy the burn and it'd signal to shinichi that his mom that returns from the trip isn't actually his mom.

I love the ED !

The large contrast of ED to its episode reminds me of Hunter x Hunter ED4 (first one for ant arc). 

Imo It's hard to pull it off, but when done right the mellow song further dramatize the while event. I really really enjoying it.
>> ARTICLE
Jeez, the death flags are too strong!

Also, it saddens me that Ryoko has Lost Her Way.
>> ARTICLE
I have a wild theory about migi species. I haven't read manga at all so please no spoilerino beyond this point. Imho basically they are sophisticated bio weapon of alien origin.

What we know so far is they are versatile parasites. Even though they are strong and their livespan is propably long they cannot reproduce and their instinct makes them take over human body and eat humans continuously. They also like to avoid danger of being exposed. 

In this episode Tamiya parasite provides us with particularly interesting piece of information that they possess some kinda special sense of purpose - directive to consume human species. I had this theory for a few episodes but now I'm almost certain.

What supports this theory is also their airborne origin. In a short amount of time in various places on the planet there were reports of weird murder cases. And we know they came from weird flying spores which propably covered all continents on the planet in a short amount of time. Seems awfully convenient, too organized and widespread for a random asteroid with "the thing" inside. Parasites are also quite customized to our biology, and they claim targeting anything else than human is not their objective.

So in conclusion I think invasion of migi species is just a bio weapon used for the first stage of an alien colonization.

Since bio weapons are least invasive when it comes to collateral damage they can propably take over earth and eradicate humans with minimal environmental and infrastructural damage. 

Since that invasion is so subtle aliens propably don't even need agressive terraforming in the first place since that would propably kill us too.

Once the invasion is complete and human race is done they will simply wait till their parasyte weapons reach expiration date and inhabit earth with all it's fauna, flora and mineral riches, maybe even take over desolated cities and all what it's left of infrastracture with minimal effort and destruction.

Terribly ruthless and extremely efficient.

And scary.


>> ARTICLE
What about the parasite consuming the dog?

Seems more like they are going for the first species they come into contact. 




>> ARTICLE
Didin't both Migi and "dog" said they were failures? Dog missing the intended host and Migi eating wrong part of it's host body?
>> ARTICLE
Ryoko said her 'directive' was "Devour this species". I think that's why that thing happened with the dog.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that blade battle was intense. The teacher's plan with the oxygen was great, and the directive idea is interesting. Can't wait to see the different morph patterns they come up with. I wonder how the mom figured out Ryuoko was a parasyte. Possibly the eyes? Or maybe its reactions and expressions?

[Aww, how cute](http://i.imgur.com/hoWSEUP.jpg)

[Looks like Migi is trying to come up with some more offensive forms.](http://i.imgur.com/Xj7jiA2.jpg)

 Shinichi  has some great parents. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I just can't get over how silly that whole part was. One, after losing that much blood, A shouldn't have been able to take more than a few steps before collapsing. Instead he made it all the way to Tamiya Ryoko's room. Second, why did she go to all that trouble. Clearly A was in no position to fight anymore and she could have finished him in one strike. And last but the biggest logical flaw, how did she trigger an explosion using *oxygen* tanks? Oxygen does not burn by itself!
>> ARTICLE
I think that trying to unearth the scientific reasoning in a show where a human body can somehow create metallic blades out of its head is a bit silly.
>> ARTICLE
Presumably the other tanks were... things other than oxygen...

Also I thought she did it to destroy evidence. "There was a gigantic battle and people got sliced, also we found this body of a human mutant thing" would raise some questions. Of course as to what happened to the big pool of blood and bloody footsteps... I guess she rushed back up there with a mop and speed-cleaned that shit.
>> ARTICLE
Remember, as a parasite he has full control over not only the skeletal muscles but also the [autonomic nervous system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system), and things like pain and exhaustion are no more than sensory information. He can constrict blood vessels and redirect blood flow from organs. Presumably more effectively than a human in hypovolemic shock, anyway. Causing permanent damage doesn't matter to him, since he's just trying to buy a few minutes.

Regarding the oxygen, it *was* a lab, so maybe the gas for the Bunsen burners or something was turned on? A room full of natural gas and oxygen = boom.
>> ARTICLE
Well the explosion was so if an autopsy was performed no one would find out about the parasites.

At least that's how I interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Its just intuition of the built personality and precedence of the person. She looks like her, but she doesn't communicate or act like her.

Can anyone tell me how close this thing actually is to the source material? Because I'm interested in reading the source, but this is one of those series I really wanna see animated and if isn't very close to the source I can read it care free.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was adapted pretty much exactly how it was in the manga. 
Especially the interactions with his parents. I actually expected the scene with his mom burning her hand to be cut.
>> ARTICLE
Having read the series, I can say it's adapted very faithfully (even got a semblance of the penis scene in) and judging by hints that have been dropped so far, it looks like they're going to continue to do so. If you don't want to spoil anything that happens in the anime, stay away from the manga.

Ohhhh that's kinda sad, I wanted to go read the manga, because even though it's old the art seems interesting, ohh well... Just gonna stick with the anime I guess.

SO what i gathered from this episode.  
Migi is changing shinichi physiology. This made it difficult for his mother to recognize him properly as her son.  
The teacher noticed that shinichi was different and decided to let him live.  
The teachers host mother noticed the same way shinichi's mother did that it was physically her daughter but not her daughter mentally.  
Also Migi is advancing at a frightening rate being able to produce fire arms and well as go mobile for a short amount of time from his host.
>> ARTICLE
After Ryoko gave her little speech to Shinichi, I swear the music sounded like someone was about to start rapping. They just dropped this phat beat out of nowhere.
>> ARTICLE
Haha yeah didn't notice it the first time though.

I love this anime so much, that OP , that OST, that ED, and that migi. So good.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, I cringed when A shoved that pipe through his back...that whole fight was pretty cool
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else find the mom's VA kinda... off? I'm not sure why but something sounds weird when she talks. Maybe I just don't associate the character design to the voice or something.
>> ARTICLE
Just bad acting. You can't really tell the emotion in her voice
>> ARTICLE
This post has spoilers.

Wow. This episode moved things along quite a lot. We got quite the nice fight scene, the speed of it was incredible. We saw Shinichi grow as a character a bit through killing A, which is hard to believe considering he's been very sheepish the last few episodes. We even see the parents develop as characters a bit, they are quite different personality wise.

I don't know how I feel about the electronic music used still, during the fight it was alright since it wasn't dubstep but the electronic is still a weird fit. The OP and ED are so damn nice once again, I just can't get over it.

To hell with 2chan, this series is honestly amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I respect your opinion but I honestly can't stand that ED... to me it sounds like a bad boy band and doesn't fit with the twisted nature of the show. At best it seems like a passable way to calm down after the show. 

I prefer the dubstep, I can't think of better music to accompany such a jarring experience. Maybe something like Aku no Hana.. they did some nice work with experimental music... I don't know. 
>> ARTICLE
Everyone has their own taste, I'm usually cool with whatever I just like the contrasting natures of the OP and the ED.
>> ARTICLE
I like how Shinichi is growing as a character. At the end of the OP he looks like a completely different person. I'm curious to see Shinichi and Migi change. I feel Migi will grow compassion and Shinichi with be alot more cold hearted by the end of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Blood running through a pipe was pretty cool :D  

I really liked the part where Ryoko's mom realized that it wasn't her daughter and it made parasyte question how she knew it. They underestimate humans too much and it's interesting when they learn more about them unexpectedly.

This episode was all about mother's instinct :D
At last we learned how she got the scar. I thought it would be more dramatic story than that when they first showed it. And his mom's voice sounds kinda unfitting to her, or at least it sounds like it to me...

Masturbation jokes just keep on coming and they make me laugh every time xD
>> ARTICLE
> And his mom's voice sounds kinda unfitting to her

Exactly. She looks young but her voice sounds too old and haggard.

I hope I'm not the only one who can't get enough of that OP. Really enjoying this so far, I've been sorta reading the manga to keep up with the anime, and it's been really good so far. Don't wanna get ahead of myself, but it's getting harder to resist reading it all now. Can't wait to see how well Migi+Shinichi can work together later on

love the OP too 
made me remember the Kaiji S2 OP ... pretty sure its from the same guys.
>> ARTICLE
It's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. They also do an ending for HxH
>> ARTICLE
Well, we learned something new this episode, they can detach themselves. Though for a short time. Imagine all the tricks he could do.

I'm pretty sure something is gonna happen to his family. You just don't go talking about babies, a mom recognizing her daughter, which then gets her killed. 

I'm wondering if Ryoko has two instead of one like Shinichi. Maybe she had successfully transplanted another?
>> ARTICLE
I felt like I could really connect with the characters from this episode. Felt heartbreaking to see the mom struggle and the fact that we know MC can't talk about Migi sucks as well. Hopefully nothing terrible bad is gonna happen to anyone except nameless side characters.
>> ARTICLE
What's shinichi's mom's name again?
>> ARTICLE
They did mention it once this episode, I believe, though I don't remember it. So she's not nameless.
>> ARTICLE
You are right, I just wiki it (which anime viewer should never do! They literally spell out end games in character profiles) and her name is Nobuko Izumi.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. And yes, never look up stuff about an anime based on existing material that's been out for a while; you'll only spoil yourself. I spoiled the major twist of UBW when playing the visual novel after I'd beaten the Fate route by reading a Wikipedia page.

I'm sure she was also credited in, uh, the credits, but I didn't feel like going back to check :P
>> ARTICLE
I'd love this soundtrack if it was standalone but to me it just doesn't blend very well with the scenes.
>> ARTICLE
Why not? I think those dubstep wubb wubbs and bass drops go very well with the fight scenes.
>> ARTICLE
This is just an speculation but I think all the mom thing this episode is for Ryoko's character development in the future, maybe once she becomes a mother she will have another purpose for her life which will be his newborn baby aside of "killing people".

^(Please don't kill Shinichi's parents)
>> ARTICLE
damn the ost is so good, makes me pumped
>> ARTICLE
Really enjoying the ED song for this show! I can't believe the full version's only released in December! Ah!
>> ARTICLE
damn, that was good. That was REALLY good. Animation was awesome, esp in that fight scene, you could feel his fear as he placed his life in migi's hand. Only now we have to wait a whole week! :(
>> ARTICLE
Eating food while watching Kiseijuu is *always* a bad idea. But I never learn. *slurrrrrp*
>> ARTICLE
Man the pacing is a little to fast for my liking. I think the thing with Shinichi's family should be done a bit more subtle - with casual hints here and there, not throwing a giant flag into our faces like this. Anyway, I'll still be looking forward to what this anime has to offer. 
>> ARTICLE
that sound when migi is going into attack form is weird xD
>> ARTICLE
Great episode! Good to see the MC not being a wimp during a fight. I also like the theme about the directive of life. The parasytes are animalistic, and operate by instinct. Humans however, are capable of a "higher" level of thought, involving logic and emotions. An animal acts on its instincts to follow its directive, but humans apparently have no such thing. It's going to be interesting to see how things turn out with Shinichi, who has a human mind, but talks to an emotionless parasyte everyday. 

Also, gun Migi? How does that work? Does it shoot ... bits of Shinichi?
>> ARTICLE
Only about 5 minutes in, but something bothered me a bit. 

This manga was made in the 90's right? A lot of things wouldn't have existed back then like Google, but they've modernized it. Since it's modern, surveillance cameras should be installed in schools, right? Shinichi would have been easily found out like this.

It's just a small thing that bothered me
>> ARTICLE
Asking a manga reader how strong is the plot amor of the parents ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Hahahhahahahhahhaha...

;-;
>> ARTICLE
The Parasytes' inability to understand humanity is a little far-fetched to me. 

What Ryoko describes [here](http://imgur.com/QeIHfdG) is a basic genetic instinct. Spiders can spin webs because they evolved to hunt a certain way that was effective for them. She describes this phenomena as some kind of "directive." She [muses that humans have no such directive](http://imgur.com/UD8EsTc) which doesn't seem like a valid conclusion coming from an incredibly logical and intelligent Parasyte.

Humans have plenty of instincts similar to spiders and flies, one of which is connecting to other humans. Our social aspect is part of what makes us the dominant species on the planet.

The Parasyte's seem to learn incredibly quickly and have a natural curiosity. All Ryoko would have to do is google "human" and read an article on Wikipedia. She'd have a much better understanding of humans than she does now.

The Parasytes' inability to comprehend human nature is a pivotal theme that creates tension between Shinichi and Migi. It's hard to ignore a plot hole this large, though I'm sure the rest of the anime is going to be interesting regardless.




>> ARTICLE
She may be talking about humans right after they are born. The way she talked about spiders seemed to be at this early stage too. If this is the case then she would be correct, newborns can't really do anything they can't communicate effectively or share ideas all they seem to have is an innate curiosity about the world kind of like parasites, but at such a low level that it may seem insignificant to her. It will be interesting to see what she thinks of humans after she has the baby(assuming she doesn't make him/her lunch). 
>> ARTICLE
You have to consider the paradigms of the era in which the source material was written.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. There was no Wikipedia, widespread internet, or cellphones back then. The parasites had to learn everything from the source. Plus, even if she could browse Wikipedia, would you trust a species' own self-analysis over your own research? It's like autobiography vs biography - sometimes the former covers details up, while sometimes the latter doesn't have as much information.

Really good episode, as always. Only one gripe; why did Tamiya sensei give up on hiding so easily?

I think she just didn't want to deal with human "culture". The other teachers were gearing up some serious "inappropriate behavior" (for a teacher to be unmarried and pregnant) bullshit and Sensei just said "fuck it - I'm outta here"

I just realize mother's VA sounds really sweet, Like what I'll expect from a japanese okasan.

Also did anime ever mention what the fathers job is? It looks like he's just bumming around with his Microsoft surface...

"I don't want to be Tamiya Ryoko anymore." Now that's some cutting social commentary. Of course, being a parasite, she can just get a new face instead of committing suicide.
>> ARTICLE
Great show 
>> ARTICLE
I was really hoping Shinichi would tell his parents about Migi after having a talk with Migi about how doing so could prevent a lot of stress.  His mom is obviously worried, and I'm sure something could be done plot-wise to make the parents keep the secret somehow.

Also, I just am really tired of "Main character has a supernatural secret he must keep from EVERYONE" drama.
>> ARTICLE
well in this case its justified because migi will prob give no shits and just outright kill them otherwise

migi for best waifu.

man for those last 5 minutes, i thought the taxi driver was gonna be a parasyte for sure.

Anyone else find it suspicious how quickly mom moved to grab the falling pot? It didn't show her arm, just her hand, and she didn't feel pain until reminded of it.    

I think it's a bit far fetched based on her character development this episode, but I think there's still a small chance that she is already one of "them."
>> ARTICLE
Nope. The point was just that she was concerned only about Shinichi's welfare, and made sure he was okay before even worrying about herself.
>> ARTICLE
You're thinking way to hard 
>> ARTICLE
Nah, man. I don''t know how old you are, but when it comes to their kids. Parents have some weird ass reflexes. 

Granted the animation may have not reflected that, but I don't find it so far fetched that she managed to grab the pot on time.
>> ARTICLE
I'm amped to see how that parasyte-human mad ebaby is going to turn out with it being fed humans instead of "regular" food.  The MC definitely has a great advantage with Miji at the helm, the battles are looking to be more interesting and maybe have some more tactics between the 2 thrown in.  That preview tho,  it seems like its gonna take longer waiting for the next episode out of dread for his parents :( .

I wonder if Shinichi could take advantage of Migi when disconnected, it said it could only survive for 3 minutes so far so he could try to trap it/Escape and let it die off.
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or is Shinichi kind of a fucking idiot? I mean his complete inability to rationally follow what either Migi or Ryoko are saying is ridiculous. Every single time they're having what seems like what could be an intellectual conversation he's always "HUH WAH, I DUN GET IT WHAT U MEAN?" and "HUR DURR UR JUST ANIMALS" like damn. Is he meant to be such an idiot or is it more of a tool to explain every single thing the parasites are saying? Then he keeps saying shit like I have to protect humans from these things and kill X or Y but when it comes down to it he can only stab him near the heart and watch the thing basically bleed out but he won't kill them? Can't he at least be consistent?

Here's my review of the episode, and if you want the opinions in a more in depth fashion, I made a video about it [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IKGTU_MSKs)

Thus far, I'm not a huge fan. The animation is fine, I like the story concept of parasites coming to earth, but the big thing stopping me from enjoying it is the bad writing. Even in this episode alone, I can count a couple dozen plot holes. 

Not to mention, the foreshadowing is so unsubtle, they might as well be shouting "Ryoko is going to eat Shinichi's mom!" with a bullhorn. And no, just giving her two minutes of backstory will not make me feel sorry for her when she inevitably dies. 

Oh, and the action scene the spent the majority of episode 3 building up lasts for a minute, and is entirely just awful Dragon Ball Z -esque punching will speed lines. 

That said, I still think it has promise, and I hope that it will get better, but man, the writing is just killing it for me right now. 
>> ARTICLE
I honestly have seen absolutely no plot holes at all, i mean how can there be plot holes when the show hasn't even had the time to even explain things. 

Makes me insanely curious as to what do you consider as a plot hole.
>> ARTICLE
I really agree that the fight scene was a huge dissapointment. Although I'm not really surprised after the "fights" in earlier episodes.

I also find the music completely takes me out of immersion. Even though it is good in its own right, it doesn't fit well as background music.

And like you said the foreshadowing is way too heavy-handed.

But I am the fence on this Anime overall, I love the premise, and it has nice animation. I also really like most of the characters other than Migi.

Overall I'd say this anime has a huge potential, but it isn't really living up to it.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, agreed with pretty much everything you said. That said, I think Main Character Dude is way worse than Migi. I'm told he gets less wimpy, but right now I just think he's really annoying.

R.I.P. Tamura Reiko - Anime Mother of the Year 

Went from [this]( http://i.imgur.com/dFg7h75.jpg) to [tanking a barrage of bullets.]( http://i.imgur.com/uOiLUn2.jpg) 

>> ARTICLE
Tamura Reiko introduces the deep questions that make this show better than a mindless action. Her along with Migi pose the question of the meaning of humanity: Why do we value the lives of our species but happily kill all others? What does it mean to live for someone other than yourself?

The show implies that the pure logical nature of the parasites is inadequate. However Shinchi was unable to produce an answer himself earlier in the show. I hope that through the character arc of Tamura Reiko, the humanization of Migi, and the parsitization of Shinchi, the show can produce a satisfactory solution.

Personally, I hope for more questions along these lines on top of the badass fighting (though I can't discount Tamura's and Migi's battle strats). And ofc the pants dropping: "Migi, handle the defense"

Treasure your mother man. You never know what cards life can hand you.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I do. She's a nice old lady now.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I mean, I didn't really think they were going to fight it out.  

Her and Shinichi are two sides of the same coin. On one end, there are humans that want to eradicate these "monsters", on the other, there are the mindless eating machines that want to just overtake and destroy humanity.  

But her an Shinichi exist in the middle ground of more of a symbiotic relationship than a parasitic one. They adapted to the other side, and became something in the middle instead of one extremity that was poised to fight the other side.  

I think she represents a peaceful solution to the end of this all, and I think that there's actually a legitimate end game where everyone can be happy together.  

When I saw the first episode with her in it, I never thought that I'd actually be sad when she went. She had an excellent character arc, and she became a much better person throughout this series.

Yeah, I thought she ended up being a really fascinating character. Much more than what I initially expected out of her.

Murano what the fuck....

Easily the worst character. Useless, emotional crutch, easily freaks out, needs rescuing, not even cute.

I don't say this often, but I think the manga handled this scene better.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the same xD
>> ARTICLE
From the beginning I figured something was different about her, why does she ask Shinichi so many times if he's really him? I'm thinking there is a little more to her than what we've seen so far, something similar to  Kana's ability. How could she tell Shinichi was back before she even saw his face to know he was crying?
>> ARTICLE
You may be onto something here. I remember Migi saying in an earlier episode that Murano was "sensitive" (or perceptive? don't remember exactly), just not as much as Kana.

It'd be great if she was; finally, a reason to care about the chick.

Thats what I was thinking. Everything about that scene was amazing, then she walks up and ignores literally everything to say 'you are back'? Damn girl thats some ignoring skills u got there. Teach me it so i can ignore my parents better?

How old are you 12? 

 I found it funnier how shinichi responded with "my tears are" 
>> ARTICLE
Funny? He was fucking torn apart about the fact he didn't feel his heart anymore, all his emotions was gone, empathy etc. Now he cried, which I imagine was big for him.

Maybe you're 12, since it seems you didn't understand what he ment at all.
>> ARTICLE
Also found it strange how he only cried out of one at first, that creeped me out
>> ARTICLE
he shortly after that cried from both eyes.
>> ARTICLE
I cried from both eyes. :')
>> ARTICLE
Man, I actually *liked* that line. Seems like it's only me, though.  

I think that she's kind of got tunnel vision, like...she knows that something's been seriously wrong with her friend for months, maybe going on a year now. And I thought it was really touching that even with the entire world falling to shit around them, she still could only see him, and know that he was truly still the friend she remembered.  

Plus, we're forgetting all the other weird shit she's already seen. She was around when a parasyte carved out a hallway of kids and just made it a total gib fest. I think she's kinda desensitized to it at this point.  

I mean, while you guys are all busting this show's balls about it, I saw a really powerful scene where Shinichi finally has the ability to run the whole gambit of human emotions again. For the longest time, he was kind of broken. He couldn't find the tears for all the terrible shit that's happened to him. And he actually gave a genuine smile to her, too.  

So, for the sake of poetic license, yeah, I'll let her ignore a police shooting and a dead lady that looks kinda like beef jerky because she shriveled up. Hell, I'll let her ignore the crying baby in his arms (although last week I was kinda hoping she'd think he fathered a bastard child because that would've taken a very sharp turn in tone of the show). The only real important part about all of that is that her closest friend is finally himself again.
>> ARTICLE
You said it best, my friend. It's poetic, and the whole show is symbolic. You've got each character representing something and it really is about artistic direction, and less about literal, real-life reactions.
>> ARTICLE
They could've done a much better job in my opinion if she saw his tears, had a bit of realization, then asked him after a bit of a pause.  He wasn't even facing her when she asked, so the scene was awkward instead.


>> ARTICLE
I think it makes sense with how the show has been presented so far.
Murano has the woman's instinct thing going on...
Kind of like when tamura reiko's mom knew she was dead out of instinct, and Murano knew shinichi was different somehow after returning based on her gut feelings as well.  In the park Murano realizes something about shinichi changed back and didn't really need to see the tears. 
>> ARTICLE
yea, i agree with all that. Though the response from shinichi (although it didn't translate well since sentence fragment) showed just how much he was surprised/relieved that he was affected. He didnt even think he was ABLE to cry anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they could've had him say that first, then she asking him if he was back, and it would've worked just as well.

For a second I thought Ghost Kana was taking notes from Ghost Banri by holding back Murano. It's like she was saying "go towards the gunfire, nothing could possibly go wrong" lol

This episode tugged at the heart strings pretty good. I really loved the scene with Tamura handing over the baby to Shinichi. Right Time playing over the scene was great. Really sad to see Tamura go, she was a really interesting character.

Also, that super serious face at the end. This guy should be fun
>> ARTICLE
Fuck that guy Ghost Banri.
>> ARTICLE
>"go towards the gunfire, nothing could possibly go wrong"

Well she would be right, we would have one character that has no purpose but calling out the protagonist's name less and that's about it.

Cue Murano fanboys downvoting because they feel that there is a valid reason for her to be taking up so much screen time yet not develop as a character anyway.
>> ARTICLE
She's had less screentime than Tamura though, also her character has been on a rollercoaster in this story. She has had development but your bias makes you forget that. First episode thanks to migi she thinks that Shinichi is a pervert but eventually forgives him. She then begins to notice him changing and rightly questions it(despite it being seen as annoying to a lot of people). Shinichi was cheerful, shy and an innocent person at the start and he has become much angrier, colder and generally less human as the story progresses. Of course everyone watching this sees that as badass and get annoyed when she points out how much he has changed. Even though he has drastically. He threw a dog in a bin, shouted at her, saved her by jumping out of the school building among others. Her character is there so Shinichi won't lose the remainder of his humanity. She didn't get upset with him meeting up with Kana even though they had a date as it must have been important. She feels guilty for even thinking about it as she feels it's selfish since Kana had died. This shows growth and maturity as she is not a shallow person who doesn't get upset and jump to conclusions. Her friends think there is nothing wrong with Shinichi which causes her to think that she is being paranoid. You are hating her for being a normal teenage girl. Even if you see her as annoying consider her a necessary evil.

>Cue Murano fanboys downvoting because they feel that there is a valid reason for her to be taking up so much screen time yet not develop as a character anyway.

I don't think such a statement was necessary when you are not only wrong but very immature as well. The anti-Murano circlejerk is blown way out of proportion. At least she isn't a stalker like Kana who is seen as the best girl.
>> ARTICLE
Would you take yourself the time to read your comment again before you spell out the word bias?

>You are hating her for being a normal teenage girl.

Well said, this is my issue with Murano(not mentioning the  fact that she doesn't question Shinichi's ability to leap from buildings and instead keeps on ranting about his identity in every tiny wee bit of screen time that she gets.)

The reason to why I'm excessively annoyed with Murano in this episode is because Tamura was one of the key parts in this show, she was a reflection of Shinichi's "parasitic behaviour" and there was so much potential to her character yet she died without resolving nor achieving anything. Instead we have a teenage girl running up to someone, surrounded by guns, who is standing besides a corpse just to ask if he is "back".

You may fanboy all you want, but as much as you try to add to her character, the fact that she is a normal, annoying teenage girl wont really change. Shinichi wants Murano to be safe, she might as well lose interest in him(which any normal person would do as there were several cases hinting that he is no human) and as long as he keeps her safe and she doesn't affect screen time we have a win-win situation! Look at it from an objective perspective, this time could actually be used to progress the plot or add character development to other characters that may actually change throughout the course of the show.

Also, really? You call me biased but you would use a term such as "best girl" in this context? It's quite clear you've taken part of many discussions regarding Murano being an amazing character as opposed to Kana.

You're right about me being immature though, but I don't feel that I'm wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a fanboy for stating facts that disprove your claim that she hasn't had any character development? Kana was much worse than her as she basically killed herself even though he told her to stay way from him. Look at Murano and Kana and tell me who is more competent. Kana was the one running after him, following him, stalking him not Murano. She wrapped his hair around her finger ffs. 

>doesn't question Shinichi's ability to leap from buildings but instead keeps on ranting about his identity in every tiny wee bit of screen time that she gets.

She does question him hence her asking if he really is Shinichi. You just contradicted yourself.

>this time could actually be used to progress to plot or add character development to other characters that may actually change throughout the course of the show.

Have you seen the last 2 episodes, this anime has progressed quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
>She does question him hence her asking if he really is Shinichi. You just contradicted yourself.

Take the word "question" with a grain of salt, after all, he did leap from a building which would probably instill fear in most people if they saw it happen, yet she did not even comment or regard it as  something unusual(because if she did, it obviously wouldn't be in the form of a question... assuming she's reasonable).

We could continue doing this for all eternity, but I still won't understand how you regard her as a character that serves to improve the show just as you will wonder the opposite about me.
>> ARTICLE
>there was so much potential to her character yet she died without resolving nor achieving anything.

I don't know how you can say that. Yeah, i'm sad that she died. She was an amazing character. But to say that she died without achieving anything...

The last few episodes have been exploring the humanity of parasites. You have parasites building a society.Parasites expressing emotion. Tamura Reiko was the pinnacle of the humanity within parasites. The episode wouldn't have been nearly as good if she hadn't died. Her death served an important purpose; to show that parasites are capable of altruism. And I mean... Shinichi cried for the death of a parasite. I could go on and on about significance of her death and how meaningful it was. It was a fitting climax to an amazing arc.

On the topic of Murano...

I agree that Murano has become annoying and there are issues with how she's portrayed in the show. I also think that her character does serve an important role in humanizing Shinichi serving as a contrast to his "new" personality. More than anything, the shows's portrayal of Murano is the key issue and the concept behind her character is sound. 

It seems like you're just really biased against Murano. I understand where you're coming from, but you don't do a good job of articulating your feelings. Rather than addressing her role in the story, as /u/PakiIronman did, you keep repeating how you find Murano to be annoying. 

>You may fanboy all you want, but as much as you try to add to her character, the fact that she is a normal, annoying teenage girl wont really change.

You say that, but it's really hypocritical. You just focus on the superficial aspects of her being annoying without addressing the real issues. You ignore the role that she serves and the perspective that she brings. I think you're the one who is fanboying against Murano. Rather than resorting to an ad hominem, and dismissing /u/PakiIronman's points with a personal attack, explaining why you think he's wrong would have been much more credible and convincing.
>> ARTICLE
A few reasons to why I'm biased against Murano which you seem to be dismissing, yet they are in my posts above:
>this time could actually be used to progress the plot or add character development to other characters that may actually change throughout the course of the show.

She simply hasn't changed. Her actions follow the same pattern in every single scene she gets.

>Instead we have a teenage girl running up to someone, surrounded by guns, who is standing besides a corpse just to ask if he is "back".

>(not mentioning the fact that she doesn't question Shinichi's ability to leap from buildings and instead keeps on ranting about his identity in every tiny wee bit of screen time that she gets.)

She doesn't make any sense, her curiosity extends as far as walking to his home to see if he is there, if he's not then she just goes home and keeps on wondering about his identity(coincidentally only when she has screen time) whereas other characters start stalking or become very cautious of people they suspect are acting weird considering the fact that they are showing signs of non-human behavior.

Regarding the issue about her being an important role in humanizing Shinichi, i addressed this also:
 
>Shinichi wants Murano to be safe, she might as well lose interest in him(which any normal person would do as there were several cases hinting that he is no human) and as long as he keeps her safe and she doesn't affect screen time we have a win-win situation!

About Tamura:

>The episode wouldn't have been nearly as good if she hadn't died. Her death served an important purpose; to show that parasites are capable of altruism.

She committed an act of altruism before she died by saving the baby, an action that baffled both herself and the detective, this is why I'm saying that there was room for her to change even more as a being that was born a parasite but "evolving" towards that of a human.

> I could go on and on about significance of her death and how meaningful it was.

Going by the reasons you listed which were basically either lacking sense, repeating after me or adding the quote above, I doubt you would make good points. Shinichi didn't necessarily cry for her, I don't understand how you can go as far as saying that.

You say that I was attacking him but you disregard the fact that he was dismissing my first post as me being immature and wrong(just as you are), you two are so deeply obsessed with this excuse of a character and because of your Murano-goggles you fail to see that you are part of a minority. You may keep on ranting about what you feel regarding Tamura(what I said was that there is more to her character which you again seem to be dismissing because of your bias), but that doesn't change that fact that Murano's character doesn't make any sense, she is freakier than Kana; the top comment in this thread is very relevant, you should read it to get a perspective from the majority of the people who watch this show on this sub since you feel that I am wrong and biased, maybe that'll broaden your take on Murano.
>> ARTICLE
>A few reasons to why I'm biased against Murano which you seem to be dismissing, yet they are in my posts above:

>She simply hasn't changed. Her actions follow the same pattern in every single scene she gets.

I don't want to be bothered to list them when /u/PakiIronman has already listed multiple points. Your'e just ignoring the arguments presented and attacking a strawman. I'm not ignoring it. It's already been resolved.

>She committed an act of altruism before she died by saving the baby, an action that baffled both herself and the detective, this is why I'm saying that there was room for her to change even more as a being that was born a parasite but "evolving" towards that of a human.

Attacking yet another strawman. I don't disagree, but the scene wouldn't have been as impactful without her death. That's my point and you didn't address it.

> You may keep on ranting about what you feel regarding Tamura(what I said was that there is more to her character which you again seem to be dismissing because of your bias)

Stawman. I never said there was no more character to develop. I said her death made the scene much more meaningful. I never said she couldn't develop further as a character. You're welcome to disagree with me, but you're trying to disagree with an opinion that i don't even hold.

>Shinichi didn't necessarily cry for her, I don't understand how you can go as far as saying that.

There is no, one answer. It's open for interpretation. Regardless, even if we assume shinichi didn't cry for tamura, her actions and her death triggered an emotional response. His crying alludes to her humanity, whether it's because she died or whatever other reason. They draw parallels between shinichi's mother and tamura. There's the juxtaposition of migi's beliefs and tamura's actions. Do i really have to explain everything step by step?

>you two are so deeply obsessed with this excuse of a character and because of your Murano-goggles you fail to see that you are part of a minority.

I wrote that "I agree that Murano has become annoying and there are issues with how she's portrayed in the show." I dislike Murano. I don't like the way they use her in the show. That doesn't mean that i can't recognize the role that she plays in the show. 

You say that i need to broaden my take on Murano's character...

* I think she's annoying

* I dislike the way they portray her character.

* I like her character, but her portrayal does not effectively juxtapose shinichi's character. It's just too repetitive and there are better ways to humanize shinichi.

Whereas you have nothing but hate for Murano. You refuse to admit that she does anything to further the plot or character development. I believe that she does, but there are better ways to do it, with or without her.

>Regarding the issue about her being an important role in humanizing Shinichi, i addressed this also:
Shinichi wants Murano to be safe, she might as well lose interest in him(which any normal person would do as there were several cases hinting that he is no human) and as long as he keeps her safe and she doesn't affect screen time we have a win-win situation!

If she leaves the show then she isn't really humanizing him. Murano serves as an annoying reminder that Shinichi is not the same person he used to be. This isn't even the issue though. This is the issue:

>Well she would be right, we would have one character that has no purpose but calling out the protagonist's name less and that's about it.

I never said she did a good job of humanizing shinichi, just that she serves that role. You're ignoring the things that she does and pretending that they don't exist. 

>you should read it to get a perspective from the majority

Bandwagon argument... Let's say 33% of the world is christian, 33% buddhist, 33% atheist. They are all fairly large majorities of people, but they can't all be right. Why not judge an argument for the quality of it's content rather than bandwagoning behind popular opinions. 

>Murano's character doesn't make any sense

It makes perfect sense. You're contradicting yourself once again. /u/PakiIronman said that she's a normal teenage girl and you agreed.

>You are hating her for being a normal teenage girl.

>Well said, this is my issue with Murano...

It's perfectly fine to dislike teen agnst. Most people have very little tolerance for it. But you go from "she's a normal teenage girl" to "she makes no sense." Your opinions are wildly inconsistent, and you seem more focused on winning the argument than expressing your beliefs and promoting meaningful conversation. Much like i am right now. The key difference between you and me is that i don't have to bend what i say and change my opinions to win an argument. I'm done, this whole conversation has become ridiculous. You're like Clint Eastwood arguing against the empty chair. Half of your arguments aren't even responding to my opinions. Your perception of my opinions and my actual opinions are two very different things.
>> ARTICLE
aww i actually missed your response and i guess its too late now... but could you just do this for me please? since trying to reason with you is futile, please read the top comment in this thread to get but a fraction of the reasons to why her character is devoid of any rational human behavior whatsoever(hence why her character doesn't make any sense), thank you.
>> ARTICLE
This happens every time i make a post regarding Muranos character. They just reply with more hate and repetition, I binged this anime from episode 1 to 12 and while she was annoying early on you can see development later on. Since people judge characters mostly on first impressions they haven't let go of that hate. As they are watching this week by week they forget the impact she has on the story. An example being whenever i bring up that he threw a dog in the bin, some people admit that they have forgotten about that. It's become a circlejerk, and most of the people who hate haven't got a reason other than "she is annoying". Instead of explaining why specifically other than the question she has the right to ask. Even if you don't like her, you have to see that she is necessary to the story. Ultimately that's it. 
>> ARTICLE
read the top comment in this thread and you will understand, its not rocket science; her character doesn't make any sense, you are part of a minority who believes otherwise and this should help to serve for you to see that you are wrong.

if you would read my posts I include OTHER reasons than her being "annoying" which is putting it lightly, could you please try to take it from another perspective than your own? it's utterly hypocritical of you and the other guy to go around calling other people biased when you are the few who feel this way about this character.
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely understand why he doesn't want to respond to you anymore...
>> ARTICLE
I like her and i dislike her. I like her character, but i think that the way it's played out is annoying.

>you have to see that she is necessary to the story

I think that the role she plays is irreplaceable. Whether or not they could have done the same things without murano is debatable in my opinion.

People really seem to like taking things to extremes. I mean it's fine to have your own opinions, but people flat out ignore the things that have happened and act like they don't exist. You can argue whether or not murano has good character development, but to say that she has none is extreme. You can argue whether of not she serves as a good foil for shinichi's character, but i don't see how someone can say she hasn't done anything to further the story.

I have mixed feelings for murano, hopefully things change for the better in the last few episodes.

You bring up some valid points. I admit she is kinda stupid. Although I find a lot of the arguments on here to be really stupid so I kinda just went out and started one... Seriously, why is everyone so pissed at Murano? Then they try to claim that Kana is completely fine. She was a stupid stalker who wouldn't listn. That girl confronted someone dangerous stupidly, and Murano has been slightly unreasonable. Although not as bad as others.

I feel like a lot of the discussions here have devolved into best girl contests like it's a harem. Can't people stop being unreasonable and hating on any character that isn't their favorite? I mean the argument about Murano is people claiming she is stupid for worrying about her crush and wondering what's up with a complete personality switch. Kind of stupid to complain about her not being all over this new strange person.

what are these sort of gifs named, i mean the anime gif suddenly going to the manga version.

I wanna try to make some once.
>> ARTICLE
I believe they are known as "anime gif suddenly going to the manga version gif's"
>> ARTICLE
Crazy-stare guy forgot how to earphone.
>> ARTICLE
Man those wider faces sure make the ladies look masculine.


>> ARTICLE
Fucking 80's hairstyles man
>> ARTICLE
Kana what happened?
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the only thing that wasn't improved was the crying scene. He looks pretty silly in the anime while the facial expression in the manga perfectly conveys, at least in my mind, what breaking down the wall holding back emotions would feel like.
>> ARTICLE
thank you
>> ARTICLE
These are so cool.
>> ARTICLE
I love seeing these. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Damn you're fast. Really nice as always!
>> ARTICLE
damn murano is way cuter in the anime

but shinichi is worse in the anime imo
>> ARTICLE
Manga shinichi looks fatter.
>> ARTICLE
I think Shinichi is cooler in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
those 4 hairs on his forehead bother me but apparently thats in the manga too
>> ARTICLE
Huh madhouse always seems to take some liberties in the art style department. Like for the better too imo.
>> ARTICLE
You won't hear me say this many times: the anime is far better than the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
In terms of overall style, yeah. It's probably compounded with the fact that I just plain can't identify with the original style, having not been around when all that bullshit was popular, but I just feel like some minor tweaks to the style have made it so much better looking. Especially given that a major theme in the show is humanity, it really helps to have human-looking characters.
>> ARTICLE
I lol'd on that last gif.

Also, so Murano didn't keep her bangs up in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
This manga was made in the late 80's or 90's so that hairstyle was the bomb yo. 
>> ARTICLE
Those comparisons make me so happy the anime was made today.  
Can you imagine this anime with people who look like they're from Initial D?
>> ARTICLE
How do you earphones. 
>> ARTICLE
They didn't have separate mic arm for some styles of headphone; it was built in to the band.
>> ARTICLE
It's because of the microphone.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda remember people wearing headphones upside down back in the day as a fashion statement.  This is an old manga.
>> ARTICLE
He's back!!!
Now he's in jail.... great
>> ARTICLE
Back? Who was he again? I don't remember him from the past episodes
>> ARTICLE
He does appear in the very first episode, at the end (I think?)
>> ARTICLE
The guy that killed the prostitute ? That felt so out of place in the first episode, but apparently it was foreshadowing.
>> ARTICLE
Yup!  I read the manga before the anime and was happy (?) to see him
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's who he was? That scene seemed out of place, maybe people who were outside and exposed to or witnessed the parasites have a higher chance of this ability?
>> ARTICLE
I meant the regular Shinchi
>> ARTICLE
When that music kicked in at 9 minutes, my heart skipped a beat...
THEY CANT END IT HERE
>> ARTICLE
With the episodes only feeling like 2 minutes anyway, I totally didn't find it surprising that the ED music was starting.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I actually thought that they were going to end it there. The fight just ended, why would they use non-insturmental music?!
>> ARTICLE
That episode was definitely not 20 minutes.
>> ARTICLE
One sign of a good story teller is that they leave you wondering where the time has gone.  This show is by far the best at that this season.

While I like Durararararararara, it doesn't immerse me like this one does.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if the two can really be compared. 'Syte is mostly about telling a compelling story whereas Durararagi is about building an interesting world then watching quirky characters screw around in it, like the anime equivalent of a D&D campaign.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I prefer Duralalast more, but that's just because I love the plot.  (S2 seems to want to make it harder for me to watch it.  I like lesbian twins in my porn, but it's not something I can watch with my kids.)

Given the kind of story Dance Revolution Revolution Revolution tells I don't think it's possible to use the same level of focus in the narrative that immerses me like Parasyte.  But a part of me wishes it was possible.  Especially with that author.
>> ARTICLE
Drrr! deffinitely does that for me.
>> ARTICLE
Imo Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso also does this brilliantly.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Parasyte, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Nanatsu no Taizai are all good.


>> ARTICLE
I feel like durarara is meant to be watched in chunks of 3-4 episodes
>> ARTICLE
More like chunks of 24-36 episodes

Yeah they should have released all 3 cours on one day.  My productiveness would effectively crash to zero.

* Tamura Reiko was such a great character. Thought she was going to be a badass antagonist at first but then her monologue just made me feel bad for her. I like her a lot. The background music that plays also really added more emotion to the scene.

     RIP Tamura Reiko. You will be remembered. 

     [The feels are real.](http://i.imgur.com/PfBHkSI.gif)

* Damn, thought Shinichi was going to be saved just because Uragami fell asleep. Would've been pretty disappointed if they pulled that stunt.
_________________________________________________

Manga readers, please keep your opinions to yourselves. I don't want to expect anything out of the anime. Wether it be good expectations, or bad. I just want to have my own personal uninfluenced opinion as I go through the rest of the episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you that I want my opinion uninfluenced, but as an anime watcher I'm curious as to where the show will go now.

Tamura Reiko was clearly the best character in the show besides Shinichi/Migi.  Now that her storyline is wrapped up, all that is left is the likely storyline of Shinichi's dad, Murano, and the police finally finding out about his true nature.  

I assume Shinichi's response would be to try to help the authorities track down the parasytes and maybe try to make them see what Reiko found out at the end of her life, that she was a daughter of humanity. But, will the police accept that point of view after the countless lives lost to the parasytes? Not easily.

I see Murano raising Reiko's baby. That one's coming a mile away. I think she'll accept Shinichi for what he's become, and I think Migi will accept that she knows about him, if Murano acts the right way about it.

I have no idea how Shinichi's father will react to his son being partly one of the monsters who murdered his wife. That is probably the realization I most look forward to.

Anyway, curious how other anime watchers think it'll play out?
>> ARTICLE
Why would a girl in high school want to adopt and raise a baby? Come on
>> ARTICLE
Because it's anime.

Trust me, I'd love nothing more than if Murano were to say "screw this, Shinichi's way too much trouble, I'm going to move on with my life."

Do you truly see that happening in this show?
>> ARTICLE
You think she'll drop out of school to take care of a baby?
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi being "too much trouble" and raising a kid are entirely different issues. We don't even know yet if he's even going to be involved with this kid in the future. The police have it right now, and it would honestly make more sense for them to give to some other nice family that's looking to adopt. Let's say that they give to Shinichi anyway though. Wouldn't it be more plausible that his dad would raise it? Murano dude? Really though? 


"Oh yes, I would love to be the nurturing mother of this parasite orphan. Let me just let my teachers know that I'm dropping out."
>> ARTICLE
I went from being uneasy about Reiko's character, to a sort of weird unease/admiration for how smart she was, to terrified at her coldness, and now I'm ending with a sort of respectful admiration - in a cast full of antagonists that aren't concerned with much more beyond their next meal, she stood (mostly) alone as a thinker, and that made her stand out in a big way. While I enjoyed her end on a storytelling level, I'm sad to see her go.
>> ARTICLE
It's quite amazing to see just how advanced of a parasyte Tamura really was.

So far, the anime audience has seen plenty of Migi's capabilities and development. It's clear that Migi is quite adept in strategic combat, and is knowledgeable about weaknesses of his own kind. Furthermore, Migi is extremely cautious when approaching other parasytes, a trait that doesn't seem to be universal based on some parasyte encounters. We've even seen traits of empathy in Migi, when he goes out of the way to defend Shinichi after the detective slandered him.

But Migi's on-screen development doesn't even hold a candle to Tamura's. Tamura seems to have researched quite a bit into the biology of her own kind, proven by her most recent 1v3 battle where she abused her ability to invade other bodies. Her dialogue with Shinichi also demonstrates that she was having an existential crisis, when most of her kind was only worried about feeding. Furthermore, Tamura has developed maternal instincts that are on par with a human's.

To lose such an intelligent and human parasyte who still had room to grow is really tragic.
>> ARTICLE
I think there was even more to her sacrifice as well. I felt like she knew that her death, although a massive loss in a few aspects, could yield large steps forward for the humans in their fight with the parasites. I almost feel like she knowingly betrayed her own kind in an effort to have a world that would be more safe for her child to grow up in.
>> ARTICLE
As I said above, I like how her end was written in from a storytelling perspective, as with her dying monologue she shot her proverbial load in terms of themes she had to bring to the table. Now it's up to the rest of the cast to work out the issues she laid on the table.

But I am going really miss seeing her. She was a great character, and simultaneously fun and terrifying to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I fully agree with you! However on the bright side it looks like Migi is going to be heavily influenced by these events and his development will be as profound.
>> ARTICLE
Beautifully said...

It's like Tamura gave her humanity back to Shinichi again as she died ;_;

That was kinda the point with the flashback to the fortune teller and the Shinichi thinking that Tamura was his mom.

This episode was really emotional :'(

[I'm not crying.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGes7FDmHAM)
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think I would cry for an antagonist but Tamura Reiko was such a well developed character that I just felt lost when she died... I kinda don't want her to go since she is just so damn interesting, probably one of the high points of any episode
>> ARTICLE
She went from this cruel and dark antagonist who couldn't care about another human being to this caring, almost humanlike mother who enjoyed scaring humans and cared about her human child. 
Not only caring about him, but willing to take a barrage of bullets while devoting energy that could've been used to shield her to protect her child.  And when she knew she was dying and couldn't heal herself, she entrusted Shinjii to watch over him. Went from cruel monster to mamma bear in style. 
May she find rest in some heavenly place.

"It's the right time..."

NO IT'S NOT GODDAMMIT!

RIP Tamura
>> ARTICLE
So parasytes can survive on normal food, huh? And yet them gourmet bastards eat only humans. 

I guess it's their primary directive to do so. Even then, there's must be a reason why they received such a directive to thin out the human population. 

I smell a complex origin story coming
>> ARTICLE
I mean humans can survive without eating other animals, but we (or must of us) do eat them, so there's that.
>> ARTICLE
And I mean that humans are omnivores and do eat both meat and plants. As I said before, humans can survive without eating animals, but if not careful a vegetarian diet can be harmful if not planned very carefully.

Parasytes are omnivores as well, since they use the human digestive system. But they only eat meat. 

If anything, it's easier to draw a parallel between a vegetarian human and a parasyte. They are both omnivores, and yet, for reasons other than biological needs, they choose to not to be omnivores. 


>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's an interesting perspective.

I believe a meat-only diet would also be problematic in some levels, especially if you eat an animal high on the food chain like us humans (because of toxin accumulation)

There must be some level of digestion on the Parasyte part too, otherwise they wouldn't be able to eat the bones like they do, or eat the quantities that they eat.
>> ARTICLE
Guess you are right about that. The fact still remains though that because they parasited an omnivore, they are or can be omnivores. 

But they choose not to be, for reasons that can only be speculated at this point.
>> ARTICLE
well, it's probably similar to humans able to survive on just vegetables, but we still choose to eat meat a large part because it's usually tastier (to most people), it's possible that humans just take better to parasytes 
>> ARTICLE
Now, we're getting into the debate of omnivorism vs vegetarianism. Sure, humans can survive on just vegetables, but our body is designed for an omnivor diet. We have acids in our stomach  and enzymes with the specific purpose of breaking down meat products. A vegan diet has to be carefully planned or it can be more harmful than helpful.

Just like the parasytes seem to be able to survive on normal food, but their biological imperatives tells them than eating humans is part of their usual diet. But since parasytes use the digestive system of their hosts, one might think they also are omnivore, but nevertheless they eat only human meat. 

It's not really about taste. And as for what I speculated in another comment here, there might be a reason why they have that particular imperative of consuming people (even though there was that one parasyte who consumed dogs because it infected a dog). They might have been created with that purpose.
>> ARTICLE
Tamya said in episode 4 that she could survive on normal food 
>> ARTICLE
Did she? I forgot that part. Then again , even Shimada claimed something like that at one point if I remember.

And even though they both said that, they still stuck to eating humans. 

Nevertheless it's only now that she confirmed it with absolute certainty. If she was sure back then, it wouldn't have made much sense to repeat it now. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeh shimada said that but as we know he lied. [Here is the scene where shinichi asks her in episode 4](http://i.imgur.com/mznDj91.png) and [she replied saying yes they could](http://i.imgur.com/y2RHE0B.png), but [when parasites invade the  human brain they receive an order to eat humans](http://i.imgur.com/Z9Hg2qD.png). 
>> ARTICLE
What bothering me is that she was going to tell him something about the Mayor, and was cut off.  

I wonder if the Mayor is actually on board with what Reiko was all about, too. Like, wasn't his campaign slogan something about getting back to nature and balancing out humanity and nature?  

I think he might not be an antagonist, afterall. Like...I dunno. Just a gut feeling. Maybe there's a way to peacefully resolve this and let everyone live together in peace.  

Or maybe I'm just being a Pollyanna and the murderfest is coming. Who the hell knows.  

...rhetorical question there at the end, manga readers. *Rhetorical.*
>> ARTICLE
[Speculation](/s "Interesting thought. Now that I think about it, with the other speculation about parasites being man made. I would rather think that the Mayor could be one of the parasytes that is aware of their purpose. That they were made for the purpose of cleaning earth of humans for ecological reasons. That it was possibly made by humans to kill humans, in order to save humans. And the Mayor knows that and maybe it's trying to override it's imperative and try to save humanity trough less pandemic means, like recicling and stuff instead of consuming a large number of them. ")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I could see that, too. The origin of parasytes is something that's got to be covered before the show is over. I'm curious where they're going with that. Or if any of them actually know, at that.  

I think there's higher functioning parasytes and low functioning ones like A. Reiko was definitely a high functioning one.
>> ARTICLE
parasytes' origins are heavily based on the *"Gaia Hypothesis"*. too much humans killing the world, so Gaia made parasytes to balance things out. hence the "we are programmed to seek out and kill humans" original premise of the parasyte creatures.
>> ARTICLE
Where are you getting that from?  

I really hope that's just you guessing and not a spoiler for what actually happened.
>> ARTICLE
I'm speculating that [a guess](/s "they were in some way created by humans.  It is very strange to have a creature that can't breed and instinctively preys on something it doesn't need")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's pretty interesting. They seem to prioritize their survival above all else, but going out and regularly eating humans puts them in more danger, generally, so there's a noticeable disconnect there
>> ARTICLE
I think they just eat people by instinct and never bothered to check whether they could eat something else instead. Tamura, unlike the other parasites, takes a much more scientific approach and tries to learn new things.   
Also, she may have realized it when she learned of Migi and Shinichi's co-existence.
>> ARTICLE
Also when they were first born there were just given the command to "eat this species".

I have a very bad feeling about him. A very bad feeling.

[](/s "or not. Maybe everything will be daijobu.")

>> ARTICLE
I think this might have been my favorite episode so far.

Lots of feels, a step back into the human world for Shinichi, and a dramatic turn of events. That scene when Reiko smiled was just...heartbreaking.

But I couldn't help but wonder just how much bullets the police had, and why Murano wasn't all that surprised to see a shot-to-death woman all withered up in the snow in front of Shinichi.
>> ARTICLE
This guy, this fucking guy, prisoner who faps in the middle of an investigative session then falls asleep. Talk about alpha.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man the feels (_). Right when the ED ("It's the Right Time") started playing I knew I was in for some tears. Then the serial killer started jacking off...
>> ARTICLE
Okay, that's a lot of bullets.  
   
That was pretty sad, Tamura really evolved over the course of this series, she became almost human in the end, deciding that protecting her child was worth far more than her own life.  
  
HAHAHA, he was actually jerking it.
>> ARTICLE
Now I know why that song in the soundtrack is called "Cream Soda".
>> ARTICLE
Haha it is. That's really something.
>> ARTICLE
That was fucking phenomenal. I straight up cheered and threw my hands up when Shinichi started crying. Been a while since I got that sort of response from any anime. It was like a weight had finally been lifted off my shoulders.

THE FEELS ARE TOO STRONG

Damn [her death was sad](http://i.imgur.com/UtxjUCp.jpg), Tamura Reiko, a great and a very interesting character from the start, but I never thought I would love her this much [at the end](http://i.imgur.com/bQrIxjz.jpg)

R.I.P. most interesting character on the show.

Honestly though that was an awesome episode.

Tamura Reiko was an excellent character.  
I'm restraining myself from reading the manga, so I'm going to guess a few things.  
Baby will go in for testing everything comes back normal.  
Shinichi gets away without having to kill anyone next episode.  

>> ARTICLE
Everything comes back normal except for the fact that the baby stops crying immediately whenever it hears someone say "Quiet."
>> ARTICLE
Imagine in the future, when teachers are like, "Quiet class!" and this kid is going to be the most silent creepy fucker in the room. XD Sociopath in the making, might still be young enough for it not effect him but damn.

I did not expected tamura to be such a catalyst to shinichi character change. I actualy expected shinichi to ally with her.

Yoshino Hiroyuki.

Holy shit, was that a piano version of "I Am"? Have they played that before? I feel like that was the first time we got to hear it, I could be wrong though. But man, I can't wait for the full release of that, was pretty damn good.

I swear, fucking ghost Kana...I was screaming, " OH YOU GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME?!" But I guess it turned out fine, Murano still alive, baby! Keep going girl, you're almost at the finish line!
>> ARTICLE
Why did the police not even seem to care/notice the child that she was holding? 

But as soon as she got near Shinichi they instantly ceased fire?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
actually if we were to think the detective as a person willing to sacrifice human lives in order to exterminate the parasytes (which he looks to be), it's makes sense to think that he was willing to sacrifice the baby, but shinichi is more valuable as an asset kept alive however since he guessed that shinichi is the dead detective's partner, who would possibly have very useful information
>> ARTICLE
The dying PI told them that the parasyte had a baby with her, and anybody who had not met Reiko beforehand would have first guessed that the baby was a monster too. Shinichi proved he was human because he remembered and shouted out the Investigators name, which would be why they would not risk to keep shooting if Tamura got too close to Izumi to prevent an unnecessary casualty.
>> ARTICLE
tbh that guys stare at the end scared me too.
>> ARTICLE
That serial killer is hilarious and enough with the cliffhangers or I'm going to start reading the manga dammit.

Also, RIP Tamura Reiko, most interesting character.

That's generally the POINT of most anime.

That scene you have from the manga: It was introduced at the very end of the first episode in the anime.

can you not make me cry anymore?
>> ARTICLE
I know it'd be pretty impossible to obtain but Shinji needs some explosives of some sort. Grenades would wreck Gotou. Or even some vials of acid like that one chick used earlier in the series. 
>> ARTICLE
I am sure that they would have a counter for that by now. Or would be watching for it. These guys are alpha predators, I am sure they would work to prevent that from happening again. A was a really new and primal parasite that was stupid. If he had just stayed un changed he could have fought still. But he tried to go back into human form and it merged with his flesh. Talking about it makes me cringe but damn is this show good.

At least it was the best part (the whistling).

I can't be sad Reiko died after they showed Kana ;-; rip best grill, Murano doesn't deserve your place. 
>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite episodes so far. We get to see both Tamura and Shinichi come to the same concluison. Maybe both humans are parasites are more alike than they initially  thought.

When he realized how him and the baby both have a loving mother who would do anything thing for them. For Tamura's baby, his mother protecting him when the police where shooting at them both. For Shinichi was when his mother protected him from the boiling water. When he came to that realization he had to break down. He wasnt the only one. I had a few tears also. 

Wonder how things will proceed after that cliffhanger.

When we're first introduced to Tamura I actually didn't like her but God damnit did I almost cry when she got shot up. You know a show (or any medium) is good when it can completely change your feelings for a character in a manner that's gradual and not sudden. The only other show I've seen that's made me feel this way is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.

This episode was so good it felt like literally only 5 minutes passed from the time I began to watch until the time it ended

Wow, that scene was ... nowhere near as climactic as I expected. Actually, I guess it kind of was, but I was thinking it was going to be more action-y. Still pretty powerful though. Tamura was such an interesting character, I was sure she was going to be the final boss or something for this series. Oh well. We still have Miki though, so that should be exciting. Shinichi has his emotions back, Murano like him again, and everything's going well ... except Shinichi might be found out soon. Y u end on a cliffhanger again, Parasyte?
>> ARTICLE
During earlier episodes, people tends to refer Parasyte been similar to Tokyo Ghoul, which I strongly disagree from the story telling POV. 

Parasyte hardly focus on action, all past fights were only short encounters, author has no intention to calligraph a long exciting fighting scene.

It is more focused on the philosophy side of the story, like one we see this episode.
>> ARTICLE
These episodes seem like they are only 5 minutes... 
>> ARTICLE
Such a great episode.  I was expecting Reiko to merge with Shinichi before she died thus giving him more cells and a power-up to fight that other bastard with 5 parasytes but this works too.

Granted that would have completely blown his cover in front of the cops so I'm kind of glad it didn't happen.

I really loved the progression of Tamura Reiko throughout the series.  From cold-blooded to more and more human as almost a direct mirror to Shinichi's humanity going more and more parasyte.  I guess its kind of fitting that her death is the catalyst to get him to cry again.
>> ARTICLE
One word for the show marvelous 
>> ARTICLE
No happy Parasyte day today fellas. Today is a sad day ;.; 

Throughout the latter half of the stand off in the park I was just yelling at the screen "Cry damn you!" The inner conflict of Shinichi is one that has been really powerful. Whenever I've wanted to cry but NEVER could it was the worst feeling. Unable to feel pain is, ironically, the worst feeling ever. I'm glad that Shinichi can finally feel this way. However, now we're from one hot potato to another. Until next week! 
>> ARTICLE
Cannot believe this show made me feel say "nooooo" when Tamura freakin Reiko died. Well done, MadHouse. Well done, Hitoshi Iwaaki.

...now to just wait another week to find out what the serial killer is able to sense.
>> ARTICLE
oh god i don't think i can prevent myself from reading the manga much longer
>> ARTICLE
 Anime adaptation of Tamura Reiko's death scene (One of the illuminating highlights in the manga) is just perfect, MADHOUSE really got the job right. 

 And Yes, Tamura Reiko is the most interesting character in Kiseijuu.
 I can not imagine Kiseijuu (manga and Anime as well) without her.  
 

 

>> ARTICLE
I loved this episode but (i know im going to be that guy) i couldnt help but be really annoyed about how many times they all her and no one stopped and reloaded. I know "there was like 10 guys there" but still, i couldn't but point that out.

P.S. I admit i almost balled my eyes out after that whole scene but i didnt want my sister catch me and call me out on it.
>> ARTICLE
 "Izumi-kun is back!" Yes murano lets just ignore the fact that Shinichi is holding a crying baby in front of a dead woman, surrounded by 9 police officers. Sigh sometimes I wish murano and kana could've switched places.

Love how the urugami started guy fapping right in front of the woman and gave no fucks lol

I like that it took like 2 minutes of continuous gunfire before someone was like "oh wait, we might hit the baby, maybe we should stop now".  Honestly, I really disliked how long the gunfire lasted, it lessened the impact of what could have been a great scene.

He wasnt talking about the baby, he was talking about Shinichi when he said boy. She had just walked up to him.

I loved the episode, Reiko's death moved me and the whole thing with the serial killer was funny and cool at the very end (they also changed the last part of the ending, now Shinichi is entering the house instead of greeting whoever is coming in).

I just really want to punch Murano, though.

**"my tears are"** - Shinichi

A real knee-slapper...Is that the same response he gives in the manga? 
>> ARTICLE
purely speculation as I don't have access to Jap raw.

My guest is that the literally translation of the Japanese sentence that Shinichi was going to say was: "the tears are flowing/crying out of my eyes". And with that sentence cut in half incomplete, it becomes: "the tears are..."

So a better interpreted (but less accurate) presentation of this half sentence may be: "I'm cr...." and is in "I'm crying"
>> ARTICLE
I agree. 

"my tears are flowing" or "I'm crying" would've made much more sense with that scene. 
>> ARTICLE
No, no.. My tears aren't back, who the hell is cutting onions?!
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or is the dude, who told Shinichi to look him in the eyes, voiced by the same VA as Favaro from Shingeki no Bahamut?

Anyone know the name of the music that starts aorund 13:20 ?

I'm becoming worried that with Tamura Reiko gone this series lacks any strong antagonists. I hope they can find someone interesting and relateable to fill the void she left. Otherwise it will either become a more classic good guy vs bad guys (monsters) series, or the police find out about Shinichi and it becomes a protagonist vs misguided police vs bad guys series, which would be better but still not as satisfying as a good antagonist.

I'm not buying Shinichi suddenly becoming humanized again by seeing Tamura Reiko die. Death should further distress him or just not phase him at all (considering he didn't even like Tamura Reiko). Seeing someone die should not be the answer to his internal conflict, it should be his own internal development that causes him to be able to move forward.
>> ARTICLE
What about that guy that is "Invincible" hes damn deadly. Tamura Reiko was a fine antagonist but she grew to "human". 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying there is no one strong left to fight, I mean there are no interesting and well developed characters left as antagonists. Gotou will certainly be an epic opponent to fight, but he can only have the role of a villain. His motives are pretty simplistic and the viewer can't sympathize with him. Tamura Reiko being more humanized gave her a lot of potential to be an epic antagonist. We don't have another character to do that.
>> ARTICLE
Lacks any strong antagonists? Gotou has been getting built up for like 10 weeks now, completely parasite, mayor of the city, has other parasites following him and would have killed Shinichi if not for a convenient truck, player of pianos in his underwear I think he counts as a strong, interesting antagonist
>> ARTICLE
I meant strong as in strong character, not strong as in combat effectiveness. Tamura Reiko was a complicated character with relateable motives who the viewer could emphasize with on some level. On the other hand, Gotou is just a villain with some cool abilities and apparently manipulative skills. His combat feats are interesting I suppose, but his personality (which we haven't seen a lot of) and motive aren't. I don't envision a final confrontation with Gotou being as satisfying as one with Tamura Reiko.
>> ARTICLE
i don't think there should be any strong antagonists. More like, the story revolves around shinichi's character development in a world that suddenly changed due to parasites. So if ever we want to see a clash of characters, it would be on shinichi against himself (or maybe migi)
>> ARTICLE
> I'm not buying Shinichi suddenly becoming humanized again by seeing Tamura Reiko die

it was not by seeing her die... it was by seeing her give her life for the kid, ie being a mom.
>> ARTICLE
I understand that, and when you phrase it that way I can see what the author was going for. It still feels forced to me and not what should cause Shinichi to move forward.
>> ARTICLE
What about that guy that is "Invincible" hes damn deadly. Tamura Reiko was a fine antagonist but she grew to "human".

Don't forgot the mayor, he's also the brain of the group.

While Tamura Reiko was walking towards Shinichi while protecting the baby while the ending song was playing in the background, the feels train arrived in the feels station and I got on.

That last part got me on the edge of my seat, theeeennn comes the ending song.

This show definitely likes cliffhangers don't it?

I am manga reader,and i don't think the ending is suck,it was epic!

>> ARTICLE
Oh man, saw Kamura handing off the baby to Shinichi with how the last episode went, but still it was sad to see her die after she had changed so much. Interesting how her death triggered Shinichi's emotions again. 

[Was this guy actually jerking off in front of them?](http://imgur.com/NPc4Adp,I1NJxqD)

I wonder how Shinichi is going to react if he is found out. 

We're already 3/4ths of the way through, only 6 episodes left.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how I feel about Tamura. I don't really care for the whole "her humanity was shown because she was a mother" stuff they brought up, and didn't like the scene where she changes to Shinichi's mother's face to get close to him. I was expecting her to give off some kind of emotion to show shinichi that she wanted him to stay, but instead it felt like she just took advantage of the fact that his mother died and changed to her. I don't know how I feel about her development tbh, rather, how she got there I should say. I'm fine with where she went, but would have rather her gather an appreciation for humans as a whole leading to her conclusions rather than "this baby taught me that humans and parasites are so similar." 

Not a bad episode but her death didn't really resonate with me. I think I like where the show is going though, and I hope they keep showing us the parasites continuing to grow as a species and the similarities between them and humans. 
>> ARTICLE
she was not taking advantage of Shinichi, looking like his mom was just giving him a sign she meant no harm. 
the whole thing was set up by her so she could give him the baby. having him run in the last moment meant she could die before the baby was safe(the cops dint gave a fuck about hitting the baby). also Shinichi was the only one she could trust to take care of him/convince people the baby was not a monster.
>> ARTICLE
I'm saying I didn't like the completely obvious signs like that. I don't even think thats a good sign either. Last time a parasite looked like his mother he was stabbed in his heart. My point was I think there should have been a better way that scene could have been shown. truth be told I didn't like the last 2 episodes much at all. Last episode had me very confused with the baby, and I didn't like the way this episode turned out. Last episode the detective was gonna throw a baby off the roof and she killed him to stop him, which seemed like the most logical thing to do at the time, so I wasn't sure why he was surprised by it. 

Basically I didn't think these final episodes made much sense, especially this one where should could have very easily fled the scene with the baby, yet she chose to die. Basically I didn't really understand her motivations this episode (and the same with the detective last episode), so i didn't enjoy it as much as others did. I hope the people that say this is the high point in the show are wrong, because if it is, I'd be disappointed. 
>> ARTICLE
This is the best the anime adaption will get. Afterwards the manga got down a little bit, but I'll let you guys judge for yourselves when it comes around. Now, a moment of silence for Tamura, though...

I wish you manga readers would stop telling us that the ending sucks. It's so annoying and ruining the anticipation. Can you stop bitching about it already.

I never explicitly said it sucks, though. All I said is that it's not going to be as good as this episode. Doesn't equal suck in my book. For all it's worth it could even still mean good. Simple reading comprehension.
>> ARTICLE
Opinions. Another manga reader told me the last arc is the best. 
>> ARTICLE
Who was the person Murano imagined that helped her decide to go back into the park and find Shinichi?
>> ARTICLE
Kana?
The girl who loved Shinichi as well but died.
>> ARTICLE
Kana, the "Shinichi gives off the same vibes as that psychopath in school, so he must be my one true love" girl.
>> ARTICLE
Answer me this, what the heck is Murano doing randomly walking around where Shinichi happens to be... Again! So convenient. 

She hears gunshots, thinks about Shinichi (as if she needed gunshots as an excuse).

I'd hate to be a downer, because this episode was amazing, but this sad attempt at trying to establish some sort of romantic story between our MC and Murano feels so forced. Murano as a character only has one purpose, and that's to facilitate the "romantic" element in this story. She has nothing better to do than to think about Shinichi, whether it's how he's not himself or whatever. I can't stand it. At this point, if they managed to end this story where they're together I wouldn't care for it and if she does it'll be just as much if not more if a plot device than Kana was. 

A Shinichi x Migi ending would be more compelling at this point.

Aside from that, this episode gets a 9.5 out of 10.
>> ARTICLE
she was following him based on what happened the previous episode 
>> ARTICLE
Murano serves more than just as his romantic interest. She is the one who grounds him and reminds him that he is human. Without her, he'd be on the extreme parasite side. Murano, as the name is chosen, is a series of islands famous for their glass. Glass reflects. Murano, in Parasyte, reflects Shinichi. It is also represented in the opening theme song where glass is broken between Murano and Shinichi. Anyway, we know that the old Shinichi is "back" in this episode because of what Murano reflects. We also know that his humanity is returned somehow by the passing of a human baby from Tamura. Murano, in conclusion, is extremely important and serves our hero his foundation.
>> ARTICLE
Is it me or does anyone else think that the directing is terrible?

I don't think "terrible" is fair, but it is a pretty workmanlike translation. There's very little original vision being put into it, for better or worse.

>> ARTICLE
You watched Clannad, right? That has an arguably more dated art style. 


I recommend watching the series first, then End of Evangelion, then the Rebuilds. The Rebuilds lack a lot of character development and don't explain a lot of things that are explained in the TV show. 
>> ARTICLE
i watched clannad and the key animation eyes were killing me (although story wise its still pretty good). i cant imagine taking on Kanon. i will probably hang myself.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, the Evangelion series is still quite modern in terms of animation and the plot is soooo worth it. Some of the scenes still put current shows to shame.

And the Rebuild of Evangelion movies are NOT a remake of the series. They are very different and pander to a broader and younger audience. If you watch the Rebuild movies, you are not watching Neon Genesis Evangelion.

Hell, I'll say that The End of Evangelion movie, despite being older is still superior to any of the Rebuild movies. The Rebuild movies start strong but as they diverge more and more from the series, they simply lose its essence.

You can't expect them to dedicate the same amount of time in developing their characters as they did in the series in only 4 movies, right? And I'll be very honest, the third Rebuild movie (the last one so far, still waiting for the 4th to come out) is a fuckfest of fan-service with little to no progression throughout the whole thing.

If you watch the original show, however, you'll witness the creation of many archetypes used in almost every anime nowadays, only done right!

Should this be spoiler tagged?  

I'm asking an honest question here, I have no idea. I mean, I suspected as much, but do they ever spell it out 100% in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader, no. It's never gone into what the Parasyte's are, where they are from, or why. 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely not. I havent read the manga but I also assumed the were from space, so im 100% sure the guy said that for the same reason
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they say this in like the first few minutes of the first episode?
>> ARTICLE
The source is never explained. Just pretty obvious that we see them floating down through earths atmosphere
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but that could've been their way of distributing themselves, ya know?  

Also, I was going to argue that they'd burn up in the atmosphere, but at the same time, they can withstand some crazy punishment by hardening their cells, so, that's kind of a moot point.
>> ARTICLE
If the spore pods were light enough they wouldn't encounter enough resistance to create the friction required to burn up.

But what are we really doing talking physics about the premise of an anime? 
>> ARTICLE
Truuuue.  

Yeah, I dunno, I was just trying to figure out how alien pods could get through the atmosphere, but, yeah, you actually just totally explained it.
>> ARTICLE
Still though, it's a valid question as to where they came from because even in the manga it never bothers to even give any hints besides "here's some shit floating down from space".

It doesn't even really explain the meaning of "Someone on earth had a sudden thought"

>> ARTICLE
Alright, don't mind my tinfoil hat...but I think Hirokawa did it.  

If he didn't make them, he at the very least discovered and organized them.  

I think he was talking about himself in the third person when he said the "someone on Earth" thing. I think He thought that life had to be protected, and possibly created the parasytes to see to that goal.  

The parasytes were constructed, somehow, they were given an instinct to find humans and infect the brains and eat.  

Maybe this is just through natural parasite instinct, they knew they needed a host body. But, they specifically went after *humans*. The one who inhabited a dog? He knew that he had failed. He had a host body, if their instinct was just to survive and thrive, he would have succeeded.  

But, no, they were told, specifically: find a human, get their brain, kill humans.  

They were constructed, I think, and implanted with that instinct. And Hirokawa seems like a good candidate. It would also explain why they would have given him the time of day and let him help them organize themselves. They saw him as an ally because he implanted it into their heads to find him, and let him help them organize and cull the population.
>> ARTICLE
I mean it's a good theory, granted that in this world such advanced genetic engineering is possible.

Just don't expect any answers from the series, because there are none. It could just as well have been that God himself decided to unleash the parasites upon the Earth.


>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it's mentioned in the first or second episode.
>> ARTICLE
Literally the first scene in the series, baby.
>> ARTICLE
pretty sure we saw this in the first episode when the parasyte eggs flew down from space
>> ARTICLE
I kind of thought that maybe whoever made them just straight up made spore pods that would distribute through the air like that.  

They were created with a purpose in mind.  

I dunno if they're really space pods, ya know?  

My idea was that maybe they were made from the Earth itself, sorta like The Happening where the trees fight back, but, ya know, a little less stupid, haha.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, if you don't mind me chiming in, the author of the story intentionally chose not to explain in the manga where these parasites came from, but hinted that indeed SOMEONE (or even a group) created them and that they are not aliens NOR from space. They are actually like dandelions and they are carried by air and wind.

TL;DR It's only implied that someone (or some group) created the parasites.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn. Just realised something. We know parasytes are capable of controlling/taking form of an animal (ie dog in ep1) and that the spores drifted down from space. It be safe to assume that some parasytes landed in the SEA. We have giant tentacle^2 para-octopuses or para- Great white sharks swimming in the ocean...
>> ARTICLE
maybe their spore forms don't live too well in water
>> ARTICLE
Yeah water is cold
>> ARTICLE
yeah, but they're just eating other sharks and octopi so its cool.
>> ARTICLE
Having thought about it for a while now, I'm really impressed with how Hirowaka was portrayed as being a parasite. I didn't even consider for a second that there might be a human amongst them. A long time ago, I did think that there might be someone like Shinichi amongst them, but not a pure human. Even as he was dying, I was 100% sure he was about to be revealed as a Parastye. Really strong writing. 
>> ARTICLE
That and the look of his eyes. Very similar to the look of real parasite

When show was beggining I was always bugged by [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/RIPxqzq.png) face when watching the opening. I thought: *this guy looks hardcore, he must be final boss.*

>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Haha very very true, hope Migi bring sit up next episode lol should be fun
>> ARTICLE
This episode was quite beautiful. It reminds me of Reiko's words, "don't bully us.". The mayor's monologue before he died was interesting. Was this in the manga? From the 90's? What an amazing writer. The way humans abuse their power to adjust to their needs, that they only focus on the environment for their survival when it is convenient for them, and that they abuse nature, that they are bullies.

That moment with Migi in the trailer/van was interesting, he sounded so defeated even though he wasn't be chased by the military. I wonder if the mixing of Shinichi's personality made him empathetic, and sad for his species. It was an interesting contrast to seeing Shinichi later on comment on how Migi never changes, but they both have changed. 


Shinichi, and Murano spent the night together which was nice I suppose. It seemed kind of out of nowhere, but maybe Murano could see the desperation in his eyes when he first ran away. I don't think it was pity sex though. Murano does love Shinichi, and he wants to stay instead of running away. She is a nice anchor to his humanity, to the normalcy of being a teenager on the verge of graduation. 


This was a pretty good episode. I hope they get a flamethrower though cause Gotou seems rather overpowered, and if he is multiple parasites who knows what he can look like when giving control to another parasite.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else feel that Shinichi and Murano's relationship is kinda weird? They have zero chemistry.  Some scenes showing the two of them actually having fun instead of their constant sort of melancholic awkwardness would've been good.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I think that they're both just slightly awkward people. For them awkwardness comes with any social interaction, so its probably a comfort to meet someone equally inept.
>> ARTICLE
Yea there really should of been some buildup to thay sex scene. Even some talking would have made for a nice transition.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, but I feel that we get that feeling because of the time the story starts. They knew each other for a few years already, and by the time the anime started it seems that they were actually pretty close. Like, you'd think they're fucking already close. All the happy playful times already happened.Then, came Migi trying to eat Shinichi's head and all the other parasite crap. A huge shock and soon to be greater change in his life. Initially, he tried to minimize its effects on his regular life. Of course, the stress and danger did take a toll on him, but tried to keep it to himself.  thus the only people  who noticed something different were those very close to him: his mom, dad, and Murano. From what I think Murano said she liked him for, and the flashbacks which Shinichi totally gave of a bit of a pussy vibe, he was a generally shy/reserved, awkward, and nice guy. Probably open or easy to read/understand, idk from here it's just speculation. But as we saw from the whole Migi fiasco, he started to act more of a recluse, got into fights, skipped school, got a side bitch, was obviously hiding a whole lot of shit, and acted in very uncharacteristic ways. I mean, he jumped of a roof and tossed a dead dog in the trash lol. So it makes sense that if you had really close friend throughout late middle school to almost all of high school, then in the middle of 2nd semester Senior year they suddenly become an anime MC.  You'd question who the hell they really are too. 

However, they don't have any chemistry anymore an it's very weird. Though not on Shinichi's mind, for obvious reasons, Murano totally senses it. It scares her, she is on the verge of losing the person she loves( or at least has strong feelings for). She doesn't want him to change anymore, leave anymore, hide anymore, or isolate himself anymore. She wants to feel safe and secure with him, and grow closer to find our exactly what is causing him so much turmoil. So she invited Shinichi for a closer relationship, and he takes it.  


TL;DR: It makes sense if you write the parts of her character for where the Anime doesn't touch apon. 
>> ARTICLE
When I was reading the manga, it felt like it was a final goodbye to Murano because what he was about to do was a suicide mission. It was never really clear if they were boyfriend/girlfriend but it was clear they had feelings for each other and this was simply doing the things you want to do without regretting anything.
>> ARTICLE
It's because Murano is an emotionless robot.

EDIT:okay she's not emotionless but her character is boring.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, I feel that's at fault of the Anime itself, They have cut a  LOT of scenes for little to no reason.

>> ARTICLE
Maybe this is why ~~2ch~~ /r/newsokur doesn't like the adaptation!

I agree, I remember when I read the manga for the first time I liked Murano a lot.

She seemed quirky and fun in the manga. Especially at first. Is my memories of it incorrect? She seemed like the odd ball girl.
>> ARTICLE
This. I dont ship it
>> ARTICLE
Exactly my thoughts. The transition to them having sex didn't feel natural at all. All I've seen between them before this was "You've changed" and Shinichi saving Murano from danger. 

I mean I got the idea that Murano liked Shinichi from her obsession with him, and that Shinichi liked Murano from him worrying about her, but that's not a relationship by any means. Furthermore, they didn't really have any romantic moments before this from what I can remember. 
>> ARTICLE
>The transition to them having sex didn't feel natural at all.

"We both like parks"

CUT TO SEX

What are you on about? The transition was as smooth as it could have been.

I think that thats why murano is so important for him. she is constantly telling him to be human, he would have lost it a long time ago whitout her
>> ARTICLE
They haven't shown enough interaction between the two to give us the idea that they have chemistry. But in that world, let's remember that shinichi and murano had feelings for each other even before migi came. So from their POV their relationship is neither awkward nor is it a zero chemistry relationship. Murano talked about good times. Guess they built feelings for each other during those good times not shown in the anime 
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely weird, but I'm inclined to give it some leeway. At the beginning of the series, when Izumi was still going full Peter Parker, they did have more chemistry; they've even had a couple cute little date scenes. I think their relationship is a little rattled after his mom died and his personality took a 180 while he told no one, and after a few of their classmates got massacred. For a little while there, Murano seemed like she always felt like she was being lied to and Shinichi seemed like he was just busy struggling with his sense of humanity. It's not the best relationship I've ever seen, but I think some of the melancholy is necessary for the sake of expressing what these two are feeling.

You have a really innocent mind, don't you?
>> ARTICLE
I thought the final scene was really sweet and well done. It didn't come out of nowhere. We've known since the very begining that these two were attracted to one another,  but they weren't ready.

After "losing" Shinichi when his mother died, Murano feels like he's come back to her, and with the way he's been depending on her emotionally, she feels close to him. And so she decided she was ready.

Shinichi was at a crossroads. His conflict with Gotou forced him to it, and he has to decide if he's going to run or give up or stand and fight. And then he meets up with Murano. With his dad in the state he's in, Murano is the only person that's really there for him, and so he depends on her. If he ran, where would he go, what would he do? Survive? To what end? No, Murano puts everything in perspective for him. Whatever he does, she's the concrete thing in his life. And so he was ready. (although, it probably wouldn't take much for him to be ready anyways)

Despite what Keima might tell you, sex isn't something that happens when all the right flags are met. Sometimes it just happens. The reasons might not always be the best, and the decision itself might be wrong, but I think this show and these two got it right.

I loved that first scene. It's what made me like Murano initially. She doesn't give him shit for trying his luck or call him a perv or anything.

She's just like, "Nope."

I miss socially awkward Shinichi. :(

RIP Kiritsugu....

ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?
>> ARTICLE
That was quite the twist with Hirowaka. I mean, it was anti-climactic in that I thought he was going to mess shit up, but it was really surprising. Now I'm not sure why Gotou said it would be easy for him to get out either. Maybe because they could prove he was human.

Not sure what I think about that bit with Murano. I was expecting Shinichi to finally tell Murano what's going on, not her to invite him into bed. Seemed pretty out of place for her to do that really but whatever! Shinichi finally gets a break. 

Edit: Having thought about it for a while now, I'm really impressed with how Hirowaka was portrayed as being a parasite. I didn't even consider for a second that there might be a human amongst them. A long time ago, I did think that there might be someone like Shinichi amongst them, but not a pure human. Even as he was dying, I was 100% sure he was about to be revealed as a Parastye. Really strong writing. 
>> ARTICLE
it's actually quite subtle how they decided to tell us Hirokaway was human, one example is him facing the parasytes while speaking, because parasites face anywhere when talking with each other.
>> ARTICLE
So the mayor was human. That was actually pretty interesting to find out. Gotou on the other hand is one scary dude. When he jumped at those guys and there was just that swirl of blood as he moved to the next room that was pretty cool and terrifying.

daaaaaaaaamn, shinichi my man, gettin laid like a boss.


how i would kill the parasyte: 

-we know a weak spot
-they dont like bleach
- shoot a bullet onto his weakspot which then shatters and sets free some bleach inside him.
-set him the fk on fire.

btw: migi is so cool <3
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that episode felt really short. Also the sex seemed to have escalated quickly. I thought it was a little weird how Murano was saying the two of them went through a lot together, when she was only a small part of what actually went down. She was there when that one guy went berserk in the school, but otherwise her interactions with Shinichi have been rather short. Plus half the time she would question whether Shinichi was really himself or not.

It seems like the final showdown starts next week. I wonder how the story will end. I'm curious to see how Shinichi and Migi will coexist without a common goal/enemy.

From her point of view they made it trough a lot together. I guess being rescued by him out of their school with dozens of other students slaughtered is more than most people can tell about their relationship concerning hardships. Not so much from Shinichi's but she obviously doesn't know that.

I like to watch mature, romantic moments in anime but that sex scene was pretty dumb. It felt like it came out of nowhere

I think the sex is meant to showcase how in a desperate life and death situation, a human turns to its primal instincts, and the after-ejaculation clarity gave izumi some time to think and resolve his will to live

He's correct in his premises, but completely flawed in the execution. Humanity damaging the ecosystem in our quest for technological progression is obviously a bad thing, but to go from that to "We must kill people to reduce impact!" is laughably wrong.

There are plenty of ways to have both a large, happy humanity and a strong ecosystem. And in the end a large and happy humanity is way more important than a strong ecosystem. The more humans there are, the more potential inventors and therefore the faster our technological progress and thus our ability to protect life and spread it to other planets. 

Without us all life is doomed to extinction when the sun dies. We are life's only shot at continued existence.

This guy knows (mostly). 

I didn't particularly agree with Hirokawa's methods (there are more effective ways), but I agreed with why he wanted to carry out such methods.

Parasyte is getting insane now that is close to the end, Mayor ended up being human, Gotou seems to be unkillable unless Shinchi brings in a flamethrower, Shinichi got dat sexy time with Murano. What I fear now is the death of Murano, it feels so... weird? MC finally had what he was looking for and he's in a relationship with Murano, meaning that more than before, she's carrying a deathflag, more than that I can see Gotou killing her just to make Shinichi "feel" what he did when the humans basically exterminated his whole race, by killing Murano.  
Hopefully nothing bad happens and we just get a Shinichi vs Gotou fight in the last episode.
>> ARTICLE
> more than that I can see Gotou killing her just to make Shinichi "feel" what he did when the humans basically exterminated his whole race,

That makes absolutely no sense.

Gatou is a killing machine living for battle, he doesn't care about anything other then that.

He said so himself.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte sure has had a beautiful way of tugging at the full spectrum of heart strings.

From tenderness to terror to tragedy. I can't recall a show in recent memory that made me, feel, for the MC. 

Like in this episode when Gotou lands next to Shinichi and basically tells him "I'm saving you for last" I was legitimately scared for him. 

Or when Shinichi wanted nothing more than to tell Murano what was going on with him and he envisions himself holding Migi back from eviscerating her looking like the monster he has/had become.  How tragic was that?

Or when Kana has her prophetic dream fantasy fulfilled in the worst way possible.

Or when they changed Shinichi's mother from a kind hearted human into an unfeeling enemy.

I love it all.

But yeah.  Overall good episode.  Gotou is a beast and Shinichi is remembering what it feels like to be scared and well, human again.

I agree. The end seemed a bit shallow although I don't have anything against Murano myself.

I don't get why so many people hate Murano. I don't think she's useless at all. She's just a normal person. And she unfortunately gets handed the task of getting to ask Shinichi if he really is himself.

Like a normal god damned person would. Who the fuck ever thinks that shit is normal? I'd ask my friends what's gotten into them if they're acting different...Hopefully it wasn't a Parasyte but hey I'd still ask!

I think that its because, besides the repetitive asking questions, people don't seem to realise/ forget that Murano and Shinichi has a life off screen. They became friends from before they started high school and they been close for a long time with a clear attraction to each other. People seem to think that she does nothing off screen and that there is no chemistry between the two characters.

What is the name of the OST whenever Gotou is on the scene. Sounds like some Creepy choir moans

Wha....wait...a high school guy and girl actually have sex, without her being a winner of a harem, without having been led up to by comedy prat falls onto naughty bits, the show is not a hentai/echi AND it's not School Days????

I feel like I'm missing some sort of significance as why they changed the Shinichi door scene at the very end of the credits. Maybe he got a new house for his first spawn with Murano.

The original showed him exiting the house, i.e. "leaving". But now he has "come back" to his old life in some ways. He's found a balance between his human side and his Parasyte side. It also ties back to Murano asking him if he was "back" or not.

Moral of the episode: Sex gives you the spirit to live.

If this was realistic she would have told him her parents were away and it would have gone over his head.

What the actual fuck. Now let's think about this for a second.
It took the series 21 episodes until he actually ''makes love'' to her.
And it was just like BOOM! In your face. Not a kiss, not even indicating that he is gonna fuck her right there and now. About 10 seconds at her house and her legs are open like a fucking theme park. I don't know how to feel about that but it is really irritating me.

WTF. There isn't enough character development for that.
>> ARTICLE
It sucks how the show excels in almost every aspect, but dropped the ball so hard on the characterization. Besides Shinichi, Migi and Tamura Reiko, almost every single character is pretty badly written. Now I don't know if this is due to the source material or due to the adaptation, but it's in the show regardless. And my god, have the last few episodes been bad, starting with the introduction of the edgy veteran guy voiced by Kiritsugu, who is another poorly written character. And I can't stand his voice actor because his voice is so recognizable. All I hear is Kiritsugu.
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree with you here... I'm a big fan of the manga and its anime adaptation, and you are right about week character setting/developers.

The story is compiling and thrilling, ages very well and unlike most manga/anime: this is actually educational and/or thought provoking.

Besides the character drawing, the character setting felt brushed over and development only served as plot device: eg/ we knew nothing about Shinichi's mum, then there's flashback to yield our sympathy right before killing her off. Mr A was introduced just so he can be killed off, same goes with Hideo, Yuko, Makiko, Kusano etc (some of them are not killed off, but brushed off).

There are main plot characters like Kana and Mitso, but anime decide to change their personality. Mitsuo is now a weird developed character that anime viewer know nothing about him, while Kana became creepy rather than an innocent lover.

And then there's Shirou, Hirama, Shinichi's dad and Murano... open, slow developed character that are alive but going no where with their development leaving them as "just been there".

- I like that the mayor says what the narrator says in the beginning of episode one.

- Turns out that I actually found myself agreeing with what Hirokawa was saying and I like that his speech tied into the whole theme of altruism

-Did anyone notice that Gotou actually had a genuine laugh to himself? I mean, I think that's pretty significant if you ask me

We have completely the opposite mind sets. Frankly I think the last few episodes have been gold, with the "sex scene" somewhat tarnishing such a good arc.

huh? the last two have been really good at showcasing what the show is about. Humans are willing to go extreme lengths to eliminate threats. Parasites underestimate humans to the max. It's a great way to make the show more grey instead of only having a good and a bad side.

Pretty sure "monster" doesn't do him justice. 

Just call him "death incarnate" or something along those lines instead.

I wonder how they'll take him out, maybe someone brought paint thinner and a flamethrower?
>> ARTICLE
It's the principle of the matter. They're shooting everyone on sight (even humans), but you listen to the guy that is actually acting like a parasyte. That's complete bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
I imagine Gotou would have to prepare his body for absorbing those shotgun rounds, shooting him square in the heart from his back might have been effective.

I think in a previous episode they said that he was 5 parasytes, head and limbs, so the heart would still be a viable target that this SWAT team appears to not like shooting at.
>> ARTICLE
we established in the previous episode that his heart was not where it needed to be, and that parasites can rearrange the body however they want. If only the organs remained human, then he can freely shift them to unlikely places
>> ARTICLE
That seems reasonable, but when they got to that room and opened fire for the short time he allowed, he was absolutely littered with bullets. With how many shots were fired and the amount of pellets fired, there should have been at least one hitting near the heart. 
But, apparently Gotou is bulletproof somehow, since none of his wounds even bled. We gonna need some bigger guns.
>> ARTICLE
it was said in the last episode i have a strong feeling fire is going to be what stops gotou 
>> ARTICLE
My only guess is that he 'extended' the limb parasytes to form body armor over the torso, but not so sure about that since *after* the fight he saw the body armor and got ideas.

Whatev, burn him.

Gotou is playing the game correctly. He sat back and observed his kind's weaknesses (their reliance on human organs, blood and 'normal' anatomy, their terrible imitation and acting abilities and overall weak ability to strategically plan ahead) and when his confrontation came, he was prepared.

I was yelling at the screen when those officers obliged him. Following him to another room to attempt to kill him? Like, what the fuck. Those five dudes should have unloaded their five full clips into him right there, considering a killer psychopath ran away SCREAMING at the sight of Gotou. 

At the very least they might have caught him mid-sentence and ill-prepared for his counter attack.

Yeah, as /u/Wolfie_ said, Spetsnaz is a much more appropriate group to use for this. If you're wondering about their notoriety, see [the Moscow theater hostage crisis from 2002](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_theater_hostage_crisis) and how they dealt with it, specifically in relation to [their use of gas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_theater_hostage_crisis#Chemical_attack). Fairly horrifying. 40 militants killed for 700+ civilian casualties, with 133 civilian deaths.

> By employing this strategy the swat team is essentially adopting the tactics and mentality of the very thing they are hunting.

I didn't see it as that at all, humans have been horrendously more brutal in history than the swat team has been, especially when survival dictates it. Even today in this modern era, society is willing to let anybody die when society depends upon it (see [quarantines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine)) 

I saw the swat team as an extension of the human will to survive -how dangerous and brutal humans can be when they are under a real and hideously dangerous threat. We saw in earlier episodes that parasytes were somewhat contemptuous of the abilities of individual humans, but always cautious of attracting the attention of human society. For good reason, it appears: for the sake of survival, human society is more than willing to cull parasytes at the expense of other humans. 
>> ARTICLE
I would have to fully agree on that.  

This whole series seems to have the underlying question of what makes a human a human. I'm not sure if we'll get a definitive answer on that, but it's definitely making you think. Does it take another monster to fight a monster? Is there any way that we can coexist?
>> ARTICLE
I think you were being sarcastic but really it's a smart call.  Each parasyte can kill dozens of people so the cost of a false positive is negligible relative to the cost of a false negative.  Tamura Reiko said she killed like 30+.

Personally I love stories where humans turn the tables on superior opponents.  It's much more satisfying than letting some chosen hero take all the glory.

Tamura Reiko's 30 was an incredibly low margin for a regular parasite, she was the more passive type that only killed when she needed to eat. A regular parasite has probably killed much much more.

In any case, in being willing to gun down hapless innocents for the aim of increasing the probability of living [In Japanese, "Sei no Kakuritsu."

Both are simply killing each other for their own survival, which is I guess what Tamura Reiko meant when she asked Shin'ichi not to bully them.

From a moral perspective every human life is unimaginably valuable. From a public policy perspective every human life is worth about 7 million dollars, at least in the US.   In either case surely saving 30 lives is worth sacrificing 1.

Still not worth it. I may have missed it but have they ever brought up any plan on subduing the parasite instead? Sleeping agent, containment, neutralizing without executing. Totally understand the parasites is an imminent threat and a resolve is needed as soon as possible but sure they must have talked about this instead of just outright annihilate them.

What are you planning on doing with a bunch of subdued parasites?  Can they be restrained?

They need to first have a talk about a way to subdue them. Then we can discuss about how to contain them. Study them if we must, otherwise we just straight up fear the unknown and kill the unknown.

I always wanted to make a threat about this actually. After Pasayte's done airing, I will create a threat about this and Shiki on the whole "how to deal with humanoid monsters" and are we obliged to deal with them humanely or not.

If we have human resources and time to deal with it, I can't see why not have some R&D on containment. I still agree that the parasites are dangerous and need to be dealt with immediately.
>> ARTICLE
That's a highly consequentialist view that I wouldn't agree with at all. As far as I'm concerned, there's no point to saving anyone's life if you have to sacrifice another to do it, because human lives aren't reducible to numbers, and to do evil is much worse than to experience it. It's as Socrates said in the Gorgias, "If it were necessary either to do wrong or to suffer it, I should choose to suffer rather than do it."

So if you were given the choice of saving 3 people or saving 1 person you'd rather just let them all die than decide?  That doesn't seem right.  The moral thing to do should be to save as many lives as possible.  If you're maximizing the number of lives you're saving numbers are appropriate.
>> ARTICLE
Not a question for me but I would like to have some inputs on this: for situations like that, it's rare that you can remain idealistic or true to your belief (family > friends or majority > minority or love > everything) Instead I would say primal instincts would take over if you're not being indecisive. Indecisive me would know that I'm being indecisive, then proceed to recognize I can't compute a way to save them all, and finally come to a resolve of doing something of an instinct, of an impulse. My point is that extreme situations require extreme resolution: Extremis malis extrema remedia

Flawed logic. Witches were an imagined evil created by a medieval to early modern European worldview, where magic was not yet entirely divorced from everyday reality. Whereas in this case you have parasytes which are undeniably a real and hideously dangerous threat to human lives - their very existence is reliant on hunting and consuming humans. 

This is a near textbook case of the utilitarian argument of "the greater good". Some people are leery of making the hard choice of assigning value to a human's life, but for the state, it cannot be paralyzed by the deaths of a few, in order to benefit the whole. The same logic encompasses quarantines: the state locks down and suspend the rights an individual/village/town/city/region in order to prevent the spread of deadly disease which would endanger the whole. 

The state must try to look out for the general welfare of the entirety its citizens, after all, what is more evil: continuing to let parasytes prey on your citizens while you try to find a clean and covert way of eliminating those parasytes, or sacrificing a few of your citizens in order to cull as many of those parasytes as possible? This culling the parasytes is not a case of slaughtering a bunch of people for the sake of killing parasytes, but rather a calculated risk by the state for the benefit of society.

It's definitely not a pretty state of affairs, and I would not be thrilled being the one sacrificed for the greater good, but the logic is sound and something that humans have operated under for centuries.

I see where you're coming from, but I can't help but find it weird that you're reacting so rationally to an episode that was clearly meant to pull at your heart strings.

Clearly the show is trying to argue that the government aren't properly respecting the lives of innocents, but given that the events of the episode are essentially those of a hostage situation, it's hard to blame the police for what they're doing. While obvious parallels can be drawn with modern terrorism (they blend in with the crowd, are extremely dangerous and can be expected to cause far more deaths than the comparatively small amount of collateral damage shown), the parasites do have the striking difference that they don't replenish their ranks. One of the main utilitarian arguments against imprecise action against terrorists is that it's great recruiting material, the little boy whose innocent parents were killed is almost guaranteed to grow up to be a terrorist. You're supposed to sympathize with Shinichi, the guy with super powers (for which there is no real world analog), not the countless police officers who can easily be shredded to pieces at a moment's notice.

In other words you're not supposed to think that hard about what the cops are doing, the anime wants you to go with your gut feeling. Don't try to actually apply the show's ideas to the real world, the metaphor just breaks down.

Not to say I fully agree with what the police are doing. I think a far larger contingency of better equipped soldiers (snipers posted everywhere, the use of flash bangs, several backup x ray machines, ect...) would have allowed for a much lower rate of civilian and police casualties.

It's about principles. Sure, we could catch a lot more criminals if we could just invade everyone's homes all the time without warrants or solid evidence. If we operated based on "guilty until proven innocent" we could lock away more criminals at the expense of only a few others. But we like our freedom and we like our rights, so we would rather sacrifice more to external threats than less to an unjust allied system.

In the US alone we would save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would have to use breathalyzers when operating a vehicle, but once that debate comes up most proclaim it is an "infringement upon our basic human rights and an insult to the freedom our forefathers fought for!".

It's an interesting debate, but if we wholly embrace the notion that the end goal is to protect the many at the cost of our rights and freedom we're going back to Nazi Germany. Not even exaggerating here. We might not be killing jews at that point, but then if Islam is seen as a threatening idea and we force them to give up their faith or die to insure safety from terrorism-

Well, I am sure you can see where I'm going with this. Before you say "I see no problem in how the humans behaved", start thinking about it on a larger scale.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
I would argue that both their motives and qualities make them a greater threat than the parasytes are in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I feel that your comparison of breathalyzers and your situation for the suspension of civil liberties to be a poor choice. You are talking about permanent changes to social structures, in the face of societal problems brought upon by the very nature of society. Parasytes are a completely different beast(no pun intended) entirely.

In the anime parasytes are a clear and real danger to human society: they slaughter humans by the dozens, they are hideously dangerous, and cannot be negotiated or reasoned with(their biology requires the consumption of humans to survive). They are like a force of nature - a virus which sweeps through human society, only they are more insidious: parasytes are intelligent and rational creatures that can hide and thrive among humans, and even make use of human societal structures for their benefit. 

I would liken the state's response to the parasytes as a response analogous to that  of a disease's. Diseases do not respect human ideas about rights, and kill indiscriminately, and as such humans have adapted by using quarantines. In a quarantine people are deliberately written off, their individual rights are suspended, for the sake of the rest of society. Culling that many parasytes at the expense of that many humans was distasteful, but in the end it is nothing that we as humans have not already done hundreds upon hundreds of times, for the preservation of human society.

In America, terrorists are a clear and real danger to society: they slaughter humans by the dozens, they are hideously dangerous, and cannot be negotiated or reasoned with(their religion requires the murder of infidels for salvation). They are like a force of nature - a virus which sweeps through human society, only they are more insidious: terrorists are intelligent and rational creatures that can hide and thrive among humans, and even make use of human societal structures for their benefit.

And that's kind of logic that gets shit like the Patriot Act passed.
>> ARTICLE
Hardly. Your attempted parallels are not particularly apt. Terrorists are people. Sometimes foreign, sometimes domestic, and can be negotiated with - in a fashion. Terrorists are people who have developed to believe in a certain ideology which motivates violent actions to the west, but they can also be persuaded to change - it is not within their biology to kill westerners. There are many reasons that terrorism exists in the world, but in the end terrorism is a social issue: it exists due to the very nature of human society. In other words: terrorism exists because of human society, it is not a force of nature. Also terrorists, lately, [do not kill dozens upon dozens of Americans](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/americans-are-as-likely-to-be-killed-by-their-own-furniture-as-by-terrorism/258156/).

Parasytes are not humans, they are an alien which must hunt humans(and exclusively humans) for their very existence to continue. But unlike the beasts which preyed upon the early humans, Parasytes can think, reason, and develop strategies to combat humans. Yes terrorists parasytes share ability to walk among humans freely, and for the parasytes if it were publicized, would threaten social order just like terrorists - causing mass panic and distrust. Unlike terrorists, these parasytes cannot be targeted: there are no recruiting grounds to focus on, there are no financiers to shut down, and there are no bomb makers and training camps to target. These parasytes must be culled - there is no other option. 

>> ARTICLE
Parasites need the guidance and support of humans to find their way into society. They area the children of humans, as Tamiya put it. We must parent them and show them how to assimilate into society. Once there is enough studies made (like the experiments Tamiya did), parasites can live among humans, eat human food, and contribute to society.

Your argument is flawed on so many levels. Let's go through them one by one.

> You are talking about permanent changes to social structures, in the face of societal problems brought upon by the very nature of society

I am not. I never said anything about permanency. Example: A highly dangerous extremist right-wing fugitive is hiding in Ohio. He is wounded and believed to be hidden by citizen sympathizers. To effectivise the search the state could access browsing history and voting records, and they could tear apart the houses of every listed suspect sympathizer within the hour.

You might think that's a just cause, but then you start subtracting from the situation until you reach your moral limit for where you draw the line. My line might be further ahead or behind yours, either way it's entirely subjective.

> (Parasytes) cannot be negotiated or reasoned with

We do not know if they can be reasoned with. Tamura Reiko's example would suggest something very different than your theory. At the very least we know they are intelligent, we know they posess individualistic qualities and and we know that they are self-aware. Those are all very human qualities.

> their biology requires the consumption of humans to survive

That's just flat out wrong. Parasytes can consume the things humans can consume in order to survive. They, like any lifeform, merely require the biological energy to stay alive. Because they base themselves on the human body, they can survive on whatever their human bodies can digest.

> In a quarantine people are deliberately written off, their individual rights are suspended, for the sake of the rest of society

Quarantines are a moral dilemma on a very similar level too. I don't see how you percieve this threat as so different from every other. Who's to say when something is dangerous enough to qualify for a state of quarantine? When the potential risk outweighs the cost?

We can actually use a very current situation as an example for this. There are plenty medical staff in West-Africa working as volunteers to contain the Ebola-virus. The risks of them carrying the virus back from Africa through processes such as obligatory checks and their discretion in handeling their patients suggest a minimal chance of them carrying the virus back.

Very unlikely, but not impossible. A 21-day quarantine would completely eradicate the threat, but this is a big disincentive to the medical staff considering working in West-Africa to stop the spread of Ebola. So in the end, less medical staff goes to West-Africa, resulting in a larger spread of the virus throughout, and an increased risk of it spreading to the US in the larger picture. One nurse is even threatening with lawsuit if the state forces her into quarantine, on the basis of her having tested negative for Ebola through the mandatory checks and her inate human rights.

*****

In the end, every answer you give brings up more questions. This is not because you are an idiot, it is due to the nature of the questions. They are unsolvable in a democratic society due to their subjective nature. We all have our lines drawn at different places in the sand, so we will all be opposed to different situations to differing degrees. I liken the Parasytes to newborn human beings that have yet to develop a moral codex. You liken them to viruses.

After the Boston marathon a very similar situation to your hypothetical [occurred during the manhunt for the bomber](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2013/04/boston_bomber_manhunt_is_the_watertown_door_to_door_search_by_police_for.html). Given exigent circumstances, American society had decided through judicial rulings that a whole city of individuals' rights could be suspended in a big way. An individual has rights but when they conflict with the public's right to safety, it is the state's duty to provide that to its citizens at the expense of the individual's. It is not only my own moral reasoning, but also the state's:  it is one that has been used through centuries as a fundamental part of maintaining public order in the face of extraordinary situations(and not just in Nazi Germany).

> (Parasytes) cannot be negotiated or reasoned with

I stick by this point, Tamura Reiko is an anomaly among the rest of the Parasytes, much like Oskar Schindler was among the rest of the Nazis. From what we have seen in the anime so far, Parasytes as a whole thrive on hunting and killing humans; there is no common ground between prey and predator. While the anime makes it very clear that individuality among the parasytes exists, the fact of the matter is that most of these parasytes are hideously dangerous and each of these finds great pleasure in killing and consuming humans. Given that parasytes seem to have no qualms in killing humans; from the perspective of the state, how is it possible to even entertain the possibility of coexistence? 

>their biology requires the consumption of humans to survive

Yeah I made a poor choice of words in this instance, but the point I was making remains the same: Parasytes have an urge to hunt, kill, and consume humans, if not for their physical needs, their mental compulsions

>Who's to say when something is dangerous enough to qualify for a state of quarantine? When the potential risk outweighs the cost?

I am hardly an expert in the subject of virulent diseases and as such I could never make an informed judgement, however the [CDC is](http://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/specificlawsregulations.html) and they have specific instances for which diseases can be classified as "quarantineable". As for the morality and what not involved in calling a quarantine, in this instance I would follow utilitarianism. I would ask you whether morality matters when faced with mass death; does it not make sense that the individual should suffer so that the public could be spared? 

As for your ebola example, I fail to see your point: a nation state's primary responsibilities are to its own people. Overly cautious procedures, for the purpose of protecting its own at the expense of strangers, while morally reprehensible in some ways, is something I do not find needful to be demonized thoroughly. 

It seems as if the point I was trying to make, was made poorly, so here is as good a point as any to clarify myself. I do not disagree that suspension of an individual's rights and the use of morally questionable tactics is hardly a pretty situation, but the situation depicted in the anime, the thing you were comparing to the next step to Nazi Germany(you were totally exaggerating), is hardly an anomalous situation in human history - even in Liberal western democracies. Societies have acted brutally and decisively for the benefit of the public. They have done so in the past, they continue to do so to this day, and I hope they will continue to do so in the future.

>> ARTICLE
> This is not because you are an idiot[...]

A poor choice of words on my end. I meant this to come out as "The issue is not with how you solve these issues case by case, because you are clearly an intelligent person, but rather with the subjective nature of the questions". In retrospect, I see my choice of words had quite the opposite effect, and apologize.

> You can see how someone could be confused?

To a degree, but you can still apply the notion what I described to any threat, contemporary or not.

> An individual has rights but when they conflict with the public's right to safety, it is the state's duty to provide that to its citizens at the expense of the individual's. It is not only my own moral reasoning, but also the state's:  it is one that has been used through centuries as a fundamental part of maintaining public order in the face of extraordinary situations(and not just in Nazi Germany).

You're only looking at my given example here when I specified that the issue lies in subtracting from the situation at hand. At some point you'll find a situation in which some would not deem the threat to be a big enough issue to suspend their rights. A recent footnote on that topic is the internet surveillance issue.

I also said that you find yourself in Nazi Germany when the state **wholly embraces** the concept of maintaining order and saving citizens at the cost of our personal freedoms and human rights.

> I stick by this point, Tamura Reiko is an anomaly among the rest of the Parasytes, much like Oskar Schindler was among the rest of the Nazis. [...] Given that parasytes seem to have no qualms in killing humans; from the perspective of the state, how is it possible to even entertain the possibility of coexistence?

An anomaly is all it takes to entertain that possibility. Parasytes were born into the world with the means to and natural affinity for killing human beings, but also seemingly with the potential for empathy. However, these concepts are frowned upon within Parasyte society, and as such it would be a risk to air those views in the presence of other Parasytes(as we saw with Tamura Reiko). It would be unrealistic to assume that no Parasytes would be willing to cooperate from the get-go.

In the end the Nazis were human beings too. Most of them were faced with the choice of fighting or dying, then with the choice of surrendering or dying. There's a saying that goes "How many Nazis were there when the Reich fell?". The answer is "a lot less", and not because of their extinction, but because they adapted in the face of danger. Who's to say the same doesn't go for Parasytes?

> I would ask you whether morality matters when faced with mass death; does it not make sense that the individual should suffer so that the public could be spared? 

Again, the underlying issue here is "to what extent". When does the risk outweigh the potential cost? If we go by "does it not make sense that the individual should suffer so that the public could be spared?", we find ourselves subject to full-time surveillance, the police would have the right to barge into anyone's home at any suspision, and we've already been over this, haven't we?

> Overly cautious procedures, for the purpose of protecting its own at the expense of strangers, while morally reprehensible in some ways, is something I do not find needful to be demonized thoroughly. 

I do not demonize it thoroughly. In fact, if you hadn't already noticed, my philosophy on this isn't all that different from yours. What I've been saying (for a very long time now) is that you can't just apply utalitarianism to the "would you save three by killing one"-problem and say "Look, this works. Apply this everywhere". To take it back to my first point; It's about principles. The debate is, and always will be "To what extent to they matter".

> It seems as if the point I was trying to make, was made poorly, so here is as good a point as any to clarify myself. I do not disagree that suspension of an individual's rights and the use of morally questionable tactics is hardly a pretty situation, but the situation depicted in the anime, the thing you were comparing to the next step to Nazi Germany(you were totally exaggerating), is hardly an anomalous situation in human history - even in Liberal western democracies. Societies have acted brutally and decisively for the benefit of the public. They have done so in the past, they continue to do so to this day, and I hope they will continue to do so in the future.

No, it seems I was the one who made my point poorly. I am not arguing that it is a necessary evil. I am arguing that you can't insert the concept of utilitarianism at some very arbitrary level and say "I have no issue with this at all", because the concept can be applied to deal with almost any threat. It's the old Maslov's hammer.

As for my comparison between a society built on the concept of utilitarianism and Nazi Germany; no, I don't think I was exaggerating at all.

edit: also your parallel you drew about disease was spot on imho
>> ARTICLE
I agree. 

Would you push one person under the bus if it means a hundred other lives would be saved? 

If they let the parasytes go free, countless more humans will die. 

If they spend too much time standing in front of a civilian who's walking towards them when ordered to stand still, or who stands up when ordered to lay down, they'd be putting themselves at risk. 

It's a very cold, logical way of thinking, but in the end it minimizes the deaths caused by parasytes. (Less military casualties and no future parasyte victims).

Depends on which side your on. Sure, if you're the one pulling the trigger its for the "greater good", but if you're the innocent getting shot at...well

funnily, if the humans really did just lie down and follow directions, none of them would've really died (except for the guy that ran off. that kinda sucked)

> What the fuck was the point? Who in their right mind when a fucking psychopath runs is like "Lets follow this guy."

From their perspective it looked like he was asking to be executed somewhere a bit nicer. Given how easily they've taken out parasites so far and how dreadful his strategic position looked, they *probably* had no real reason to refuse.  
It's overconfidence on their part, sure, but it wasn't inconceivable.  

Also it wouldn't have made a difference.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if the simple infantry knew about the communicating ability between the parasytes. There would have been the posibility for him to call for backup at least that's what I would have assumed in this situation (if I weren't stunned by fear). And they also could have met another one what would have made their situation even worse.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't know if the simple infantry knew about the communicating ability between the parasytes.

Doubtful that they did. The mere existence of the communication ability made the entire military strategy much less viable. In a situation like this they would have needed to either bring in significantly more soldiers (as in, two soldiers per person in the building) or pump gas into the building, put everyone to sleep and scan unconscious people.  

I'm not trying to say the soldiers were very smart -- just that it's not so incredibly ridiculous that I can't believe it would happen.

We don't know what his strength or attack strategy is yet; we haven't had an opportunity to see him in a fight yet.

Not saying they deserved to die, but they have all the awareness of a group of horny teenagers in a horror movie.
>> ARTICLE
They couldn't know for sure if Uragami was playing them or legitimately scared shitless. I'd regardless be just as cautious around Gotou if I were them, though. 

But really, nobody in the police knows that there're conjoined Parasytes that don't have the weaknessess of regular ones. For all they know you can just shoot every single one in the heart and they'll all die.

I'm pretty sure they were ready in case Gotou transforms and starts rampaging. But they really couldn't have known that he could take all the bullets and not bat an eye.

The expected massacre of civilians came...however the cause of it wasn't as expected.

so a shotgun to the chest was able to take one down - that was easier than expected.. 

[Gotou on the other hand](http://i.imgur.com/mY3BMKR.png)
>> ARTICLE
Ahhh so that's why they need flamethrowers. Can't absorb flames. ^^^^^I ^^^^^think
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't it because something like fire disrupts the cells from regenerating or something? I'm guessing if you torch Gotou he will burn up like any type of flesh.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Migi said something like flames would surprise them that's all, may not be a sure-fire way to kill them though
>> ARTICLE
Surprise is sort of underselling it, but a guaranteed kill is overselling it. The theory was that the shock of the flame would disrupt Gotou's ability to communicate with the other parasites he shares a body with, and thus considerably lower is combat abilities. Hold the flame long enough and he'd most likely die, but I don't think he's just gonna stand around for that to happen, and I doubt he'd lose so much control that he's incapable of any movement.  He'd have to resort to hookshotting around though. Complex motor functions like walking/jumping/etc would probably be disrupted. 
>> ARTICLE
That's true, but I'm referring to that one student parasyte who got doused with paint thinner. He went on about how his cells couldn't regenerate or that he couldn't control them to that extent. I'm guessing fire would have the same effect.

It kind of breaks the connection between inner body and out of their skin so they go ape shit because they cant change their form as they want to. At least thats what i saw from that paint thinner part

Those parasytes still killed their host during the initial infection.

Right. A lot of them were able to work at City Hall and I'm sure they're the more rational, educated parasites who are able to assimilate into human society.
>> ARTICLE
Still better than any Political figure.
>> ARTICLE
Of course, and they were rationally coming for a human lunch during a break in their dining room set up by the mayor. Remember the guy who killed Kana and got rekt by Shinichi? They labelled him as an hungry idiot who couldn't wait and dine in a secure place they agreed on and went eating elsewhere instead.

The only one who was quite fucked up, ruthless but still intelligent enough to propose they don't need to sustain on humans almost got killed by right wing parasite colleagues of her. So no, there aren't any good ones, only those who can slip under your radar by trying to look human, don't get fooled :D

Well, there's no doubt that the parasites are also evil, but yes this is depicting how humans can act evil when trying to neutralize a threat as efficiently as possible.

Nah, I think this episode was only there to show that some humans are no better than the parasytes, but are in equally as important positions.

Ya, last episode (or was it the one before?) made me realize something.

When Best Mom said humans and paraysytes are the same, I think she was talking about how we eat animals yet we could survive w/o doing so, but we do it anyways.
>> ARTICLE
She also meant that parasites need the guidance and support of humans to find their way into society. They area the children of humans, as Tamiya put it. We must parent them and show them how to assimilate into society. Once there is enough studies made (like the experiments Tamiya did), parasites can live among humans, eat human food, and contribute to society. As with human, we need guidance and nurturing growing into adulthood to fit into society and co-exist.

I think that Crime and Punishment (The book) can actualy relate to this: When you read the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment) it says that part of the plot is: "Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov (the main character of the book) justifies his actions by ...  believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose." (A quote from the wiki). I haven't read the book, so i'm not totally sure, but I do think that they were going for this reference.
>> ARTICLE
Yes he believes that the pawnbroker he kills is a plague on humanity and by killing her, he can help wipe out the debt a lot of people owe to her. 

In the end he is unable to justify his own actions to himself (esp as he also killed the pawnbroker's sister who stumbled in on the killing)and ends up turning himself in (with the help of his female friend)

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamethrower#After_1945)

>Flamethrowers have not been in the U.S. arsenal since 1978, when the Department of Defense unilaterally stopped using them. They have been deemed of questionable effectiveness in modern combat and the use of flame weapons is always a public relations issue due to the horrific death they inflict. Despite some assertions, they are not generally banned, but are banned for use against civilians, or against military targets in a concentration of civilians under some circumstances.

I assume Japan is in a similar situation.

Holy shit. This episode was probably the most emotionally unsettling for me. For the first time the line between the parasyte and human starts to blur; who are the true monsters here? The parasytes defending themselves from assault or the human soldiers showing wanton disregard for innocent human lives? And poor Shinichi is caught in the middle; memories of Tamura Reiko still fresh in his mind. I think the climax has begun and some serious shit is about to go down. 

Also, looks like [Episode 21 Preview Spoiler](/s "Shinichi and Murano are gonna g-g-get it on next week.")

I wonder how it would have gone down if Uragami hadn't caused the initial panic by screaming they were all parasytes and had pointed them out more precisely. They would have still had the scanner, but the crowd would have still probably gone into panic by seeing the parastyes. The one that used another human as a body shield while trying to escape could have probably made it if it had waited until the guards were distracted.  

Looks like Uragami had some fun until he ran into the guy with multiple parasytes in his body. I don't get why they didn't just shoot him when they saw Uragami running in terror (not that it would have done them much good). Going to be interesting to see how they finally take him down, I'm sure Shinchi and Migi will get involved but not sure how they will get police cooperation. I wonder if they took his advice and prepared flamethrowers though. 

While its all well and good that they are eliminating the Parasytes in the City Hall, what about the rest of the parasytes in Japan and the rest of the world? If they are prepared I doubt a tactic like this could work too many times before they could fight back effectively. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious if they touch on the parasytes in other countries (Ihope I didn't missed a part where came just down in Japan?). If there are this many just in one city it won't be easy if not impossible to wipe them all out.

I think in one of the early episodes, Migi was reading an article online about how there were odd mutilations happening all around the world, so I don't think it's just happening in Japan.

All those people are scarred for life. And that guy that had the parasyte land on him, dammmmnnn. 

In one hand, I agree with Police Kiritsugu with his method of screw colateral damage, they're up against monsters that can cut you up into tiny pieces, engage them with extreme prejudice.

Then on the other, it's gotta be the worst possible place for a civilian to be caught. Just gotta stay down and do as the cops/military says or you're dead.

Very scary indeed.

Wow the logic in this episode. Kill all people on sight, except the ones that actually act like Parasytes. Do whatever the fuck they tell you to do. Makes perfect sense.

I'm gonna be pretty mad next episode if there's not a major public backlash for this operation. There's no way they should be able to get away with murdering humans to kill parasytes. This building was filled with government workers and politicians. These are people that the media will listen to when they  run to it accusing the government of gunning people down. The only reasonable way there could not be a huge public backlash is if they just killed everyone who saw it.

I was waiting for the old "humans are evil too" troupe to rear is head in this show and it finally came. Now I wonder if the show will explore this or forget about it in an episode or 2. 

Not sure how I feel about this episode. Seems like the show will focus more on the story at hand rather than talk about the parasites and develop our MCs. Shinto, migi, and murano had little screen time in this episode. 

I'll be fine with the show focusing more on the story, but I feel the writing has to step it up for that to happen. Some scenes and dialogue just didn't sit right with me, like the group of officers blindly following some man (who is quite obviously a parasite) into a room. Or the main officers telling them to just kill everything in sight. I mean, what could go wrong in either of these situations? The show has to be a bit more realistic in its scenerios if you ask me, I highly doubt this is how the government and police would act in situation like this (I'd imagine the police fucking up out of fear sure, but not that shit that goes down here). Some of these scenes and dialogue almost feel forced to get the point across (killer guy repeatedly saying that the boss dude is also a killer, hearing 3 separate people say "kill everyone you see") or straight out of a cheesy horror show IMO. 
>> ARTICLE

At least for me.

Shit this was a good episode. For the humans to defeat the monsters they must first sacrifice a part of their humanity. I do believe that was the best course of action though. Killing a few innocents to make sure you get all the parasites, when the alternative is letting a few parasites escape to kill even more humans later on may be regrettable, but it's all for the greater good. Sacrificing the few to save the many, we're getting all Kiritsugu Emiya up in here. And all this is happening while Shinichi watches helplessly from the sidelines.

I love this series so much. it's seriously the one I look forward to each week without fail. Especially the last few episodes, which haven't had that highschool bullcrap (in my opinion it honestly brings the show down).

I really want Shinichi to get involved, and for everyone to realise just exactly what he is. And for them to meet and talk to Migi, of course. But at the same time, thinking about it realistically leads you to the conclusion that the humans would probably just kill and/or experiment on Shinichi without giving him a chance to prove himself.

The episode seemed to make a big deal about the parasites communicating with each other, and it leads us to believe that part of the reason for the failure in the mission was the parasites communicating but other then letting each other know that the humans were on to them they really didn't work together at all. They all had their own plans on getting away, not one master plan or anything. Just something to mention because the show makes a big deal about it, when I don't think it was. I mean, if I were a parasite and even if we didn't have that power after hearing someone get shot is probably just assume they were onto me anyway.

That whole ending was kind of a message from the creators to "tree-huggers". Migi says that he hates people who do things "for Earth" since the Earth has no feelings. Then Shinichi kills Gotou because he's just a human and can only take care of his family and other humans. Really interesting, since I thought they were going to go in the opposite direction at first.

Personally, I'm glad. Whoo Humanity Fuck Yeah!

I am glad that he is killing Gotou, after all. I have nothing against tree huggers, though. Both are two completely unrelated things.
>> ARTICLE
I really thought that Shinichi was going to burn down the whole damn forest just to kill that monster.  

I can see now that that would've been the exact kind of insane logic that the parasytes seem to be combating the humans for.  

If parasytes truly were created by a human (I think all signs point to yes, and I think more so, the Mayor was the one who did it, possibly), then that would just kind of justify their point, wouldn't it?  

If humans would truly destroy the planet around them just to save their own ass, maybe they deserve to die. Maybe *we're* a parasite on the Earth itself.
>> ARTICLE
>If humans would truly destroy the planet around them just to save their own ass, maybe they deserve to die. 

...Why...?

That's the entire point of evolution: Survival (well, technically reproduction, but you have to be alive for that). 

That's the entire point of doing most of the things we do: To keep ourselves alive and healthy. We do that by any means necessary, because that's exactly what survival is. 

How can we possibly deserve death for fulfilling the point of living?
>> ARTICLE
> Maybe we're a parasite on the Earth itself.

You see this idea that humans are a parasite on Earth or somehow "alien" to nature thrown out a lot. Such a statement assumes that either Earth itself is some kind of organism or that nature exists in some kind of perfect harmony that without humans would reign supreme.

Humans are just one of many species trying to out-compete each other on earth. Had evolution given lions/deer/whales/ants/trees/fungus/whatever a significant advantage over other species they would be ones in our position.

Humans and everything we are, make or do are as natural as everything the next species is, makes or does. The only thing you could say is that humans are *too* successful a species and should keep this in mind and be careful in our position.

[](/s "You can't save Nature without saving humans too.")

>> ARTICLE
I would say that rather than parasites, humanity is a cancer, or a tumour. We grew alongside everything else just fine, and we have been doing so for thousands of years. But now we've grown too numerous, and we've gotten to the point that the planet's ecosystem is suffering because of how many of us there are, and the waste we're releasing to accommodate us. Similar to how cancer works, as a healthy and functional part of your body begins grow and divide differently at a much too rapid pace, killing the body slowly. It may have once helped, but now the tumour is deadly. And we're becoming that tumour.
>> ARTICLE
>I would say that rather than parasites, humanity is a cancer, or a tumour..[snip]...And we're becoming that tumour.

That was the kind of rubbish I was calling out.

There is no such thing as a "Natural Harmony", every species is constantly and naturally trying to out compete each other species. Humans have just managed to reach a stage at where we are both at the top of the food chain and are self-aware enough to realise what is going on.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, true.  

The thing that humanity tends to not realize, and I think the biggest flaw in religion is that it claims that God or some divine being made the Earth for us. And, that's the farthest from the truth than we can possibly get. The Earth wasn't made for us, we were made for the Earth. Everything we are as a species, we needed the planet to shape us in order to become that.  

And that's beautiful in its own right.  

But we are absolutely too successful at it. And, maybe having a predator out there would kinda slow us down a bit on ruining it for everyone else, too.
>> ARTICLE

Depends on the religion; even Christianity considers Humans "stewards" of earth and the Vatican is strongly on the side of nature preservation and protecting the climate. 

> But we are absolutely too successful at it.

Saving nature and saving humans is the same thing. The period we are in right now is likely just growing pains as a species. Given the dire straits humans found themselves in the past, <10,000 members, anything we face on earth from here on is unlikely to wipe us out.

As Humans become more and more successful and secure in our position we've grown more and more worried about those we've beaten out for the top spot in the food chain.

> And, maybe having a predator out there would kinda slow us down a bit on ruining it for everyone else, too.

Our relationship with some common predators and other animals is very interesting. In general, Humans are enamored by even the strangest of species, just check out stuff like /r/aww, /r/awwducational and /r/awwnverts. We in a symbiotic relationship with two *very* successful predators and a whole lot more relationships with other domestic *and* non-domestic species. Even our ability to digest food relies completely on our gut being colonised by outside species after birth. Even odder relationships have formed between humans and species you wouldn't consider.

Inter-species relationships are not uncommon: [here's a crab with sea amemones on its claws](http://featuredcreature.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen+shot+2010-10-23+at+4.20.29+PM2.png) (this is a choice on both sides since the amemones actually let go of their rocks when the crab picks them up) or ants farming seeds/fungus or taking care of "domestic" aphids.

So even with another predator equal to us out there we would probably just either make friends with them or if possible [interbreed with them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_human_admixture_with_modern_humans). 

If you want something cool to think about consider that humans will be the reason that Earth life colonises a new planet (hopefully a desolate one). If Nature was an entity it would probably consider that pretty awesome.


>> ARTICLE
I never thought about it like that. That humans spreading out to other worlds is equivalent to the earth spreading it's seed across the cosmos. That's really beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
We've already had a huge effect on the evolution of other species without even meaning to.

Dogs are the most prominent example of this since they seem to share many traits in their behaviour and mental approaches with humans. Some really odd stuff as well.

For instance dogs share our left-side bias when looking at faces and even looking at faces for communication through body language. Dogs also share some mental traits and show a concept of minds, this tricky to consider so bare with it. If you see a human use a non-dominant appendage (hands for humans and mouths for dogs) to do something when they could easily use their dominant hand you would assume there is some good but non-obvious reason to do so. Dogs are the same. 

[There is a lot about this in research papers but here is a review to get started.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2251326/)

By the way if you think a dog can't do a puzzle bare in mind that dogs realise we are smarter then them and if a human is around they will basically offload difficult thinking onto us. Get them away from a handy human and they will do the puzzle themselves. Edit: Funnily enough this is also a sign of intelligence.

We have literally changed the mental development of dogs to make them more like us.

Edit for bonus weirdness: Puppies prefer *humans* as parental figures then other dogs if given the choice, ~70-80% of the time. Don't think the weirdness is all on the dog side. Humans consider cruelty to dogs/cats to be equal to cruelty to human children (yes all the people up in arms threatening violence against people who harm animals may just  be a reflection of this). Humans as young as 4 years old who have never heard a dog bark before can identify the intent of a dogs bark with very good accuracy. 



While cats don't show as much as dogs (to my knowledge) when a cat uses vocal communication it is purely a way to interact with humans *because that is what humans use*. Cat to cat communication is pretty much all body language. Actually humans using cat body language can make cats very happy. Simple things like no long eye contact and no staring, cats only stare at things they want to attack or things that might attack them by breaking eye contact you basically are saying they are neither of these things. When they lie out flat with their belly exposed the correct response is to do nothing, cats (in general) show themselves as being vulnerable to test whether you will do anything to them. When cat lies on its back it is not a submissive pose as other animals but rather they are freeing up all their claws to attack, particularly if they think they can't run.

>> ARTICLE
> So even with another predator equal to us out there we would probably just either make friends with them or if possible interbreed with them. 

I could see that being the final episode of this show, honestly. I think that humans/parasytes are going to find a way to coexist, since the biggest baddest one is now gone, maybe humanity can find a way to peacefully coexist with them.

>> ARTICLE
All the parasytes have to do to coexist is stop eating people, they've already made places for themselves in human society to hide in.

Unfortunately the regular parasytes have no way to reproduce themselves, I'm not even sure if they can replenish their mass since you do not see them get any bigger but I would imagine they are, so eventually they will die off.

The only anomaly is Shinichi since his body is a composite of human and parasyte cells but we've no idea if that can be passed on. If such a trait can be passed on (after all Migi's cells have gotten 'everywhere' but past the blood-brain barrier) then you might have a situation like the [original incorporation of Mitochondria/other organelles a billion or so years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiotic_theory).
>> ARTICLE
Well, that is unless they're man made, the parasytes. I think they are. But, I think the Mayor was their creator, and I think the way to create them is lost forever.
>> ARTICLE
From start to finish Parasyte has been a very personal story about Shinichi and his introspection about himself, his nature, Nature and his place in the world.

In other words don't expect the ending to resolve anything that doesn't relate to Shinichi on a personal level. 
>> ARTICLE
You can't really "save" nature at all. Long after we're gone, and despite anything we do that fucks us over and kills us off (even if that takes pretty much everything else with it), other life will rise and fill the gaps and the planet will continue to get on just fine without us.

Saving the Earth is about saving US.

I don't see how one thing contradicts the other, though. Gotou needs to die, in order to save people's lives, just like the work of (most) tree huggers serves the exact same purpose. The difference is, either Shinichi lets Gotou go on a rampage and kill a lot of people and save the planet (in the best case scenario, because realistically he wouldn't last much against mankind's current firepower) or humans make the decision to take serious measures to save the planet into their own hands. If not, we'll just suffer the consequences of what we do :P
>> ARTICLE
The problem with "treehugger" sentiment (and I think this is where Migi's dislike comes from) is that saying you're doing it "for the Earth" is disingenuous. There isn't really anything we can do to the planet (short of literally blowing it to pieces in some kind of celestial super-apocalypse) that will "kill it". The Earth simply doesn't give a fuck, and nor does nature. Life and the planet will go on without us; saving the Earth is about saving US, not the planet. Even when it comes to other species, the uncaring, ambivalent and undirected forces of time and nature have wiped out (and will continue to wipe out) more species than we will ever manage to before the same thing happens to us (assuming we don't manage to do ourselves in long before that).

Are you sure about that? We're destroying the planet for countless species right now. As we're piling more and more carbon into the air, we're tearing away at the ozone layer, letting more and more UV Rays and heat in, and then stopping them exiting at the same time by thickening our atmosphere with these greenhouse gases. It's not impossible that we could end up creating a runaway greenhouse effect: the ice melts, then the water evaporates and is eventually lost into space, the earth becoming barren. We're already melting the ice and decreasing landmass, and the rate the earth has been heating up since the 1950s is extremely dangerous. And this is to say nothing of our general disrespect for animal life, which we destroy so thoroughly that more species have gone extinct in the short period that humans have lived than any other extinction event on earth. 

I think it's safe to say we're destroying life, if not the planet. 
>> ARTICLE
You think man can destroy the planet? What intoxicating vanity. Let me tell you about our planet. Earth is four-and-a-half-billion-years-old. There's been life on it for nearly that long, 3.8 billion years. Bacteria first; later the first multicellular life, then the first complex creatures in the sea, on the land. Then finally the great sweeping ages of animals, the amphibians, the dinosaurs, at last the mammals, each one enduring millions on millions of years, great dynasties of creatures rising, flourishing, dying away -- all this against a background of continuous and violent upheaval. Mountain ranges thrust up, eroded away, cometary impacts, volcano eruptions, oceans rising and falling, whole continents moving, an endless, constant, violent change, colliding, buckling to make mountains over millions of years. Earth has survived everything in its time. It will certainly survive us. If all the nuclear weapons in the world went off at once and all the plants, all the animals died and the earth was sizzling hot for a hundred thousand years, life would survive, somewhere: under the soil, frozen in Arctic ice. Sooner or later, when the planet was no longer inhospitable, life would spread again. The evolutionary process would begin again. It might take a few billion years for life to regain its present variety. Of course, it would be very different from what it is now, but the earth would survive our folly, only we would not. If the ozone layer gets thinner, ultraviolet radiation sears the earth, so what? Ultraviolet radiation is good for life. It's powerful energy. It promotes mutation, change. Many forms of life will thrive with more UV radiation. Many others will die out. Do you think this is the first time that's happened? Think about oxygen. Necessary for life now, but oxygen is actually a metabolic poison, a corrosive glass, like fluorine. When oxygen was first produced as a waste product by certain plant cells some three billion years ago, it created a crisis for all other life on earth. Those plants were polluting the environment, exhaling a lethal gas. Earth eventually had an atmosphere incompatible with life. Nevertheless, life on earth took care of itself. In the thinking of the human being a hundred years is a long time. A hundred years ago we didn't have cars, airplanes, computers or vaccines. It was a whole different world, but to the earth, a hundred years is nothing. A million years is nothing. This planet lives and breathes on a much vaster scale. We can't imagine its slow and powerful rhythms, and we haven't got the humility to try. We've been residents here for the blink of an eye. If we're gone tomorrow, the earth will not miss us.
>> ARTICLE
My point exactly. The idea that we are "killing" the planet is the height of arrogance. It's not that there is no point in striving towards the goals that fall under that sentiment, just know that it isn't about altruism. It's selfish sentiment. Earth would do just fine without us or, in fact 99% of life already here. Time and nature have already killed off most of it that ever existed, and will continue to do so (we are the lucky few), and yet the Earth is still here.
>> ARTICLE
> Earth would do just fine without us or, in fact 99% of life already here

So 99% of extant life has no value just because life can re-evolve?
>> ARTICLE
Good quote from the prologue of Jurassic Park (the book).
>> ARTICLE
Very well said.
>> ARTICLE
I think that is a shallow way to put it because we both know the "earth" encompasses more than just rocks and magma but plants and animals too. Migi just states the oddity of selflessness. It's something incompatible with him especially selflessness to a thankless force like nature. 
>> ARTICLE
Only if you take the position that the life that currently exists on Earth is somehow special. Again, as I (and others) have said elsewhere, that's and arrogant position to take... I don't mean that in a belittling manner, it simply fails to take into account the scope of the history of life on Earth.

If you wiped out every single species that currently exists on Earth it would be completely insignificant--a mere drop in the bucket--compared to the breadth of species that time and nature has already consigned to the waste basket of life that represents species already extinct.

There have already been several major, cataclysmic cosmic events that have scoured the Earth of major branches of life and there is very little we can do that can compare to that. We may well destroy ourselves and vast swathes of life on Earth in a similar manner but, as the quote goes "Life will, uh, find a way".
>> ARTICLE
I love Jeff Goldblum.

And I completely agree with your sentiment. Also, it reminds of how arrogant it is of humans to think that they're responsible for the fate of every other living thing on the planet. It's rather ridiculous. I never asked to be put in the driving seat of this giant boulder of minerals.
>> ARTICLE
> how arrogant it is of humans to think that they're responsible for the fate of every other living thing on the planet

We kind of are, now. Not saying this really has a chance of happening but we have the capability to nuke 99% of life away. And if we screw the atmosphere enough (again, probably won't happen because we aren't 100% stupid) Earth will become a second Venus (which is inhospitable to any form of life that could possibly evolve from anything that exists on Earth) Just saying that we technically have the capability to screw everything, as well as save everything by seeding other planets before ours gets absorbed into the sun or hit by a massive asteroid. And therefore we have a responsibility.

But even ignoring extremes, we have an immediate responsibility concerning individual species. We have already extincted and endangered several. I know this isn't unique to humans but what IS unique is that we can enact policies and breeding programs to save them. We can choose whether something goes extinct or not, so we have that responsibility. 
>> ARTICLE
Venus is still okay, isn't it?

Anyway, no, we have no responsibility. Thinking we do is arrogant. The earth will be fine regardless of what we do, and the earth itself has been killing off entire species by the thousands since long before humans were around to join in.
>> ARTICLE
As George Carlin said, ["The Planet is fine, the people are fucked!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL8HP1WzbDk) 

We're just making it inhospitable to human life, the planet will keep doing what it does.

gotta admit, the thundershock looks a lot better in the anime 
>> ARTICLE
I think that maybe it was a choice to represent it that way by the studio. It doesn't seem to have to be a thundershock, specifically. Just something that draws your attention to what's happening to the arm.

I personally think a thundershock was a bit stupid. It felt like some kind of reaction was going on, when it was just Migi returning to Shinichi.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I thought it was a bit too over the top when I watched it as well. I think a better way they could have done that would have been with the little orange dots they've been using through the show, and make it look as if Migi and Shinichi's arm were kinda "resonating", if that makes sense.

Throughout all the action and dubstep, the philo sophia of this show is really the best part
>> ARTICLE
I always thought that was cool because the word "philosophy" actually comes from the Greek "philo sophia," meaning "love of knowledge." Sometimes I think about the symbolism in the jacket. Does it mean Shinichi or Migi has a love of knowledge? Is it a reference to the Platonic ideal of "philo sophia," that is, asymptotically approaching wisdom but never truly reaching it? Did it mean to apply that ideal with reference to the humans' and parasites' search for mutual understanding, that is to say, like Plato's concept of wisdom, that understanding is inherently unreachable? Or perhaps it is a message to the viewer, saying that the series was created for the love of knowledge with the hope of imparting that love to the viewer?

Then I remember that he had another shirt that just said "GOOF," and it all falls apart.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously want one of those now.
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking I might want to cosplay as Shinichi. I'm so doing that, cuz it'd be way easier to make than a school uniform, haha.  

I just gotta figure out how to make Migi and make him right. I could go for gag and make it a sock puppet, but I want like, glass eye, sculpting clay, make it look as skin like and realistic as possible, ya know?
>> ARTICLE
You could go with some liquid latex if you're, for instance, applying the glass eye to your hand - I know people use it for costume applications all the time.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I'm trying to figure out how to do it. I'm also working a booth at most of the cons I'm going to in the next few months, and I don't want to be worthless the entire day when trying to handle change.  

I think basically making finger puppets, and then spirit gum or liquid latexing them onto my hand is the way to go. But, if I can figure out how to make a glove, that'd be awesome, too, so I could take it off when I don't want it anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Haha yeah, that would probably be ideal. I was able to find [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuSs6JcMkb8) tutorial online, which may be helpful?

That might actually help quite a bit, yeah.  

If I can figure out how to balance everything on there together, that would be really cool.  

Wonder if I can match my skin tone with latex, though.

Matching the skin tone does seem like the most difficult part.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, I'd just want to make absolutely sure that it looks like my hand, ya know? Although if I do two eyes and three blades, I won't have to worry about making fake fingernails or anything so that'll work nicely.

Then again, since you're painting the latex afterwards, you could probably take your time mixing a color that matches your skin.

Expected of, but also interesting that Migi chose to go back to Shinichi instead of staying with Gotou, even though he is one of his own kind (Migi even felt some level of compassion for Gotou in the end, identifying Gotou as a fellow being and killing him would be considered "murder" from a human perspective)
>> ARTICLE
Migi is becoming more human just like Shinichi has become less human, its the only explanation for why he didn't just kill him. He developed some kind of compassion or respect for Gotou, if we was acting out of his own rational self interest he would have just sliced up his insides and called it a day.

He probably wanted to escape because he was going to die from the toxin either way.

Gotou was poisoned means death and migi partly remained in Shinichi

As interesting as Migi's decision was, I also thought Shinichi's moral struggle was equally as interesting. "Should I kill? It might save the lives of many more humans. But, who am I to be the arbiter of another species' existence? Man this is a tough decision. But my family, bro...splat"

Really stole the episode for me, the same guy who earlier tossed a dog into a trash can, now sheds a tear when a monster responsible for countless deaths is on the brink of death himself. I think this is what they call character development. 
>> ARTICLE
Fan of FT and nisekoi here, what is this character development you speak of? seriously though, truly amazing scene imo, can't wait for finale but uhh I can't imagine there will be any real life/death conflict. I mean all the parasytes (or at least the remarkable ones) are basically dead right? All the named antagonists are already dead. I'm guessing that it'll be about his relationship with murano and his dad, and what their future holds. Maybe that means he will reveal migi to one of them, probably murano imo. I'm okay with that kind of ending, not really any action but a lot of emotion.
>> ARTICLE
If he tells Murano though, she will know they're not the only two there when they're bangin'
>> ARTICLE
the dog was dead though and he was only reacting overly rational, here it was actually about morals
>> ARTICLE
The two events certainly don't directly parallel each other, but having said that, the motivation behind Shinichi tossing a dogs corpse in the trash is a moral judgement, while the method he uses is calculated through reason. After all he could have just left the dog alone right? 

Even if its not a matter of morality, his internal conflict is definitely a moral struggle.
>> ARTICLE
Human pollution is the real winner here!

Shinichi:  He's just another organism trying to survive.  I'll let chance decide if he'll live or not!  It might be bad for humans, but I'll do it for the Earth!

[Why?](http://i.imgur.com/Lo3nwa0.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love how emotional Migi's "death" was to Shinichi. In the earlier episodes Shinichi would call him a monster and would quite happily be rid of him. Yet here, he cried for him, fought for him, and remembered Migi as his best, bravest friend. You have no idea how happy that makes me. The fact that a monster and a weak being (but who is who?) came to have this kind of relationship even though their species were against one another is truly beautiful. Migi and Shinichi's relationship is one of the highlights of this series.

But my god, this series really makes you think. Should you kill a creature because it threatens the existence of others, or should you spare it because it was only living as it had been raised. "*So from the ecosystem's perspective, we're the poison and they're the cure?*" It might not be good for humanity, but it'll be good for the Earth. Would you take its life?

Just looking at my own completed anime list there's also Psycho-Pass and Hyouka, both 22 episodes,  and Nisekoi, 20 episodes.

That's because Shigatsu is not the only exception; there are many. The general convention is still 1 cour = 12-13 episodes and 2 cours = 24-26 episodes, and even then there are more exceptions, e.g. split cour shows, which have a 1 season break in-between the 2 cours.
>> ARTICLE
Oh I see, I didn't know that. Thanks for telling me.
>> ARTICLE
Sure, no problem. There are many other exceptions, like Durarara!!x2, which is 3 split cour with the cour airing right now being the first, the second airing next Summer season, and the third cour airing on Winter 2016.

Other exceptions are OVA and ONA series, but those are, in cases, completely different from shows aired on TV.

Psycho-Pass and Shigatsu are noitaminA shows, which are usual to have 22, like what /u/Super1d says.

It's basically Kaneki.
>> ARTICLE
But makes far more sense and had far more depth than Kaneki's character development ever did
>> ARTICLE
Or rather, Kaneki is basically Shinichi. Now that you mention it, the two stories are very similar.
>> ARTICLE
That's why the series get compared so often. I found Kaneki's development to be far more believable than Shinichi's, especially in the manga. Several of Shinichi's actions just seemed too forced for me.
>> ARTICLE
Which ones seemed forced?
>> ARTICLE
The scene where Shinichi regains his humanity through the death of Reiko. I like the concept of what they were doing there, but the execution of it was very rushed and forced to me. There is also the scene where he finds his desire to continue living through sleeping with Murano. This is another scene that had a good concept, but still came off as force, although I would also just blame this on Murano's bad characterization. It's difficult to make believable interactions with a poor character. The last scene in recent memory is Shinichi deciding he needs to go die to Gouto. This direcltly conflicts with his new found purpose in life from sleeping with Murano and the sacrifice Migi made. The "people are dying because of me" justification doesn't do it for me at all. I'm sure there are more examples further back, but those are the ones off the top of my head. I also have some general complains about Parasyte, but I'll set those aside since we're talking about Shinichi.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, I think Shinichi allowed Gotou to try to kill him because heck, without Migi he was just a slightly enhanced human, and Gotou might have followed him when he left anyway, so he would have to confront him at some point. He didn't think he could win against the **beast** Gotou. So he just tried to hurt him as much he could and accepted his fate. ~~Never realised there'd be a handy pollution-infested stick lying around.~~
>> ARTICLE
> might have followed him when he left anyway

Might have is far from definitive. He had relatively slim chances of surviving the fight even with Migi. The whole reason he decided to fight instead of trying to hide was so that he could continue to live his current life and see Murano again. Going on a complete suicide mission is completely contrary to that goal. He's actually has a better chance of hiding now that he doesn't have Migi, so Gotou can't sense him. It would have made much more sense for him to run than fight base on prior motivations.
>> ARTICLE
I remember reading somewhere that Parasyte was the inspiration for Ishida to write Tokyo Ghoul
>> ARTICLE
I would honestly very surprised if it wasn't. Take a look at TG chapter 0. It feels a whole lot more like Parasyte than the final product did. 
>> ARTICLE
Migi's character development is impressive as well. He went from rational mastermind to accepting to lead Gotou where he wouldn't be able to harm as many humans as in the city and then willingly sacrifice himself to let Shinichi survive. Shinichi progressively becoming less human as Migi was developing more and more emotions was really an awesome parallel.

The thing is though that is just SEEMED like he was super weak and a normal human because Gotou was just crazy strong. You can see it when he stabs Gotou that he's still his crazy, super human self.
>> ARTICLE
waaaaaaiiiit... what IS up with his hair? was migi-power making it stand up on end a la dragon ball z?
>> ARTICLE
He fell/swam in a river before getting to the old ladys place, which probably washed away his hair gel. 
>> ARTICLE
Throughout this run, I have to say. This is the most faithful manga adaptation I have ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's the most faithful, since they *did* cut out and change bits and pieces here and there throughout the course of the series, but it's no doubt one of the **best** adaptations I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty faithful to the source, like over 90% of it follows it which is way better than most adaptations. ie Tokyo ghoul/log horizon


>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately the japanese manga fans don't agree with this 
>> ARTICLE
Really? What is there issue with it?
>> ARTICLE
I've heard they really hated the character design changes at the beginning, but haven't heard much else about why they hate it.
>> ARTICLE
They also seem to really hate the OST for it.

I also heard a lot of people say they don't like the execution for important parts of certain episodes, saying they don't match the same force and power that the manga has (for example, when Ryoko Tamiya found Shinichi in the crowd of students in the gym during school).
>> ARTICLE
The OST itself was actually not what they hated for, they didn't hate the wubwub at all. They hated the sound director for placing the "wrong" music in some scenes to the point it killed the atmosphere.
And the most hate surely came from the execution part. They seem to think that the director is not good at pacing and directing climax scenes and always making things awkward. 
>> ARTICLE
The OST hate is kind of understandable, its hard to get emotional with a dubstep OST
>> ARTICLE
It's not all dubstep, there are some other awesome tracks like [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgSWxRMKCiw)


>> ARTICLE
Personally, I *love* the Migi track. The boop be boop boop one. You know what I'm talking about. It just sounds really alien, and it really hits the mood of the show perfectly, I think.
>> ARTICLE
If you like that one you'll probably love this [remix.](https://youtu.be/mLIK13i-cFg)

I especially like the part [3 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLIK13i-cFg&t=180) in.

don't you mean the one that goes [be boop boop bop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuB_Pm4Xxbs)?
>> ARTICLE
What's to even hate about them? They updated them to be more modern and exaggerate changes in character. It almost sounds like they are just looking for something to hate just because lol
>> ARTICLE
> It almost sounds like they are just looking for something to hate just because lol

Pretty sure this is the case. I've heard from plenty of western manga readers that it's a spectacular adaptation. I suppose it's a case of nostalgia goggles because of the popularity of the source material.

You also have to keep in mind that the vast majority of the people watching the show in Japan are opinionated otaku. Much like the rest of the anime world, anime is not a widespread thing in Japan. In fact, from what I've heard it's even more niche over there than it is in the west, so the people giving feedback on the show are those with extremely strong opinions.
>> ARTICLE
>In fact, from what I've heard it's even more niche over there than it is in the west

Well that would be wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Niche in that, while it's well known, it's not generally considered to be a good thing, particularly shows like Parasyte, and particularly in the adult community.
>> ARTICLE
No matter how you spin it, anime is not more niche in japan than in the west. Yeah, there is a stigma against otaku culture in japan, but it's definitely not going to be worse than in countries where most people don't even know what anime is. 


>> ARTICLE
So is this a case of western fans having shit taste or the Japanese fans having shit taste? Idc actually, this anime is great and I don't think I can trust the opinions of those who disagree lol.
>> ARTICLE
Protip: Everyone has shit taste. It doesn't matter what others think, as long as you enjoy the show. And this was a pretty damn good show.

Yeah I keep saying that when I tell people that Mars of Destruction is amazing.

Was expecting to crap myself when Shinichi was walking around Gotou at the start.

**Shinichi's Thought Process:**

What if Migi isn't dead and is inside Gotou? Should I cry out for him? Why am I so optimistic? Will this rusty old blade be sharp enough? Can't the two species just get along and be friends? Did that old women have STDs?

Enough talk. He's probably sleeping. Sleeping like a baby.  Just sleeping...

Inside.
>> ARTICLE
If I was in Shinichi's position I would have killed Gotu without hesitation.

Is there anyone who does not share that opinion?
>> ARTICLE
The difference is, that we weren't confronted with the question "what defines me as a human?" in such a extreme sense.

I think because of all the shit that happend, he first rationalized stuff from a superhuman perspective. But then realizes that this perspective should be irrelevant for him as a human
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
They explained earlier in the show that parasytes are essentially sentient muscle, like a combination of neurons and muscle cells. I believe it was just an exaggerated representation of the neural signals that Migi was using to override Gotou's own.
>> ARTICLE
Migi is so badass he doesn't need logic. 
>> ARTICLE
because Aldnoah
>> ARTICLE
i think the electricity was just to "show" how migi cells reacted and shared information when they got into contact, it wasnt really electricity it was more of a neuron impulse but due to clarity they opted to put the electricity part in, its easier to see.

It would probably look weird without it, just touching arms and then migi wakes up. Or maybe it was some kinda impulse to wake up migi so he would join in.

these are the 2 explanations i can come up with

So, the military started a major operation whre they killed countless civilians including important politicians for no reason whatsoever?

that was his ilusion, he was actually killing people like crazy

I think if he pulls that off, the police would be after him.
>> ARTICLE
Why do you think he was running around the woods away from the city? It was obviously because he was running from the police, who he perceives as inhuman monsters attempting to kill him.
>> ARTICLE
I wanted shinichi to go give the cleaver back to the old lady and have her see his other arm.

>> ARTICLE
So uh... Poisonous trash ex machina?

Jokes aside, great episode as usual. Can't wait to see the last one, but sad it's over so soon as well.
>> ARTICLE
He also used a rusty hatchet. And even if it wasn't toxic* then the rod he used was rusty, and Gotou could have been infected with tetanus (how he gets owned in the manga.)
>> ARTICLE
Oh fuck, that fight climax was hype. Migi is such a great character.
>> ARTICLE
Why was Migi in Gotou? Did Gotou lie about not absorbing Migi or did Migi infiltrate earlier on his own in some way?
>> ARTICLE
/u/pepepesoran's comment makes the most sense, but I'd like to add that Gotou or Migi said Gotou was "one being."
>> ARTICLE
Gotou absorbed Migi after Shinichi ran away. He had control over all parasites inside himself completely, including Migi, so he was "one" parasite at that time.
>> ARTICLE
He just said "there's only me now". As Migi put it, a parasite within Gotou feels asleep and is not capable of acting as an individual.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like someone got caught monologuing. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy what a ride. Now it's all over, I'm sure we going to have a relax epilogue. Beach episode maybe?
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi doesn't have enough waifus for that sort of thing.
>> ARTICLE
One's enough. The only question is if that one is Murano or Migi...
>> ARTICLE
its like migi took the words out of my mind when he said just decide if you are gonna kill him or not too big a monologue man - paraphrasing
>> ARTICLE
So this is how it ends. Gotou, the strongest parasyte, literally dies to trash. As for the morality debate, it looks like selfish morality wins out, mah family > your life.
>> ARTICLE
Wait... so what made him change his mind?
Why did he end up killing Gotou?
>> ARTICLE
TLDR; he was first like "everyone has the right to live, who am I to destroy nature like that", then migi adds " nature don't give a fuck", so shinichi concluded: "you right, and I want to live without fear of danger"
>> ARTICLE
migi is back PRAISE THE HELIX
>> ARTICLE
This may be a stupid question but I've been wondering about this since episode 1.

Where did the parasyte's come from? Hopefully they will explain at the end.
>> ARTICLE
This is what I believed for decades:

Author never explicitly cover this topic hence it's open for all speculations. I believe it's a "natural phenomenal", these being just came from space or generated within atmosphere without need for reason.

Now, I've heard that author did an QA and explicitly stated that "parasytes are man made". I've no source but I can go through his " post completion articles" (as part of ~2004 re-issue edition).

>> ARTICLE
Hmm i just find it odd that if it was man made, Why wasnt it ever mentioned in the manga/anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I think by "man made", it may be referring to "human influenced consequences", like green house effects or broken ozone layer etc.
>> ARTICLE
"I shouldn't be the decider of who should kill this." Proceeds to kill it anyway.

Because the tried to take a superhuman perspective but then realized that he **is** just a human, so he should just act from that perspective

Really nice episode. Really glad Migi is still alive. I was thinking Shinichi was going to use fire when he landed in the dump, but that was an interesting twist.
>> ARTICLE
I expected a bit more detail of how Migi survived. I mean last episode was shown dieing with no hope. Now all of a sudden Gotou decides to pick up his enemy and make it a part of himself? 

Maybe an interaction between Migi and Gotou as they merge. Something...

I dislike how the illusions are done. I mean they work like illusions but it throws me off when it's done. Good ep though.

Guys. I don't want this show to end.

What a beautiful episode. Powerful message about what it means to be human and basically have the power to affect all life on Earth. To kill or not kill - which decision is the one that truly distinguishes the human life form from others? 

This time next week I'm going to be extremely depressed.

This is the first time an anime has made me smile uncontrollably. I fucking loved this episode. And MIGIIIIIIII YESSS. There's nothing I can say that will do this show justice.

I think we ought to give Shinichi a hand, you know for surviving ... or some other shit. Jokes are hard to make.

I found the philosophical part to be a bit much, whether or not he should have killed Gotou. He killed to many and threatened to kill even more. I like Tokyo Ghoul's approach to this "To live is a sin", so we should just try and sin as little as possible.
>> ARTICLE
Probably my least favorite episode thus far. Thought it used "convenience" as a plot device multiple times in this episode. Plot became predictable as Migi returned. Some of the animation choices seemed strange like the lightning when Migi was reunited with Shinichi. Also thought the environmental message was very shoe-horned into the plot as a theme. The strange decision of Shinichi to kill Gotou, then let him live, then kill him felt a bit out of strange. Examining this series as a whole, I wish they had left Tamura Reiko as the final antagonist. Gotou felt like they were just trying to one-up their previous villains with an "invincible" parasite. Tamura actually had real depth to her character, and was a fantastic foil to Shinichi's character. As Shinichi became more parasyte-like, Tamura became more human. I still stand by my belief that the show climaxed when Kana died, and it hasn't reached back to that point ever since. Thus far, 7.75/10.

Does anyone know if there is a longer version of the song just after the ed/before it says ''next time''?

I almost fell for it thinking he wouldn't go through with it.
>> ARTICLE
Wait.. could someone explain why shinichi said he was going to spare Gotou and then he went back to kill him anyways?
>> ARTICLE
Too long won't read; He was thinking about the morality. He would allow it since it could be better for Earth. Then Migi made him realize though Earth is a complex system, it itself is not alive, and it's OK for him to be selfish in protecting the human race which could mean the destruction of Earth over Parasites.

He first thought he should allow nature, god, Gaben ("the powers that be" ie the 50-50 split) determine whether Gotou lives. He either realized since parasites and humans are 'two sides of the same coin' or as they described in the show "family." then their fragility applies to humans also. As such parasites in the long term would have the same destructive force as humans. But mainly Migi made him realize Earth isn't a living creature itself. In reality, just as Humans are ruining Earth for other species, it doesn't matter because other forms of life can out survive humans.

Can someone explain to me where that lightning chain reaction came from when Shinichi's remaining Migi cells parried Gotou's killing blow? I understand why Gotou exploded, just not where the light show came from

The "lightning" was just a visual effects to illustrate that when migi and shinichi connected, migi simultaneously doing internal damage to gotou.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap this episode went by fast.  IMO, I thought that big battle was friggin' awesome.  It had believable twists and circumstances to it and Shinchi was a really great character throughout the whole thing.  10/10, I can't find a flaw.
>> ARTICLE
Kana i miss u Q.Q

Was a bit logical, but was hoping for Shinichi to die. Could have been one of them anime where the main character actually dies and the evil wins, rare to find nowadays. And it would logically make sense, shinichi had lost migi so you know. but oh well, in the last few episodes it did get scruffy and rushed
>> ARTICLE
If they did that it probably wouldn't happen in the 23rd episode but in the last. But of course it his very unlikely now.

Migi's casual "hey" was literally the best. God I love this show.

1 more episode to go

Ah humans, we will undoubtedly destroy ourselves and everything around us.

I like this show.
>> ARTICLE
So allow me to be the buzzkill here. How did Migi get into Gotou? We very clearly saw him shrivel up and die in the last episode, and after Shinichi calls out to Migi, Gotou says, "He's not in here.". And then, out of nowhere, Migi comes out of Gotou's arm. So, how did he get into Gotou without Gotou knowing, in maybe the 5-10 seconds the camera cut away last episode? 
>> ARTICLE
I think Gotou was referring to Migi's mind when he mentioned that, "He's not here."

Gotou absorbed migi after the fight i think

Since when are episodes 2 min long?

I REALLY loved this episode. We kinda knew Shinichi is going to win and Migi is probably alive but they did a great job in not showing what will really happen till the very end.

I'm sad we will have to say good bye so soon :(
>> ARTICLE
Interesting to note the similarities between Parasyte and the Chimera Ant arc in Hunter x Hunter. They're playing off extremely similar themes in their own ways. It's always been a favorite theme of mine to view humans as apex predators despite being faced with objectively stronger organisms, and this show is no different. There will be more that a little bit of afterglow for me once this show's over. I should probably start writing my review now.
>> ARTICLE
been saying this for the longest, they definitely touch on similar subject, though in vastly different ways. 
>> ARTICLE
Unlike the chimara arc, this battle doesn't take 30 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I think mostly because it's not juggling 30 characters and taking roundabouts of their inner monologues. Expand Shinichi's struggle to a few characters and suddenly you have something almost suspiciously similar to the Chimera Ant arc.
>> ARTICLE
Rather, I think you mean the Chimera Ant arc is suspiciously similar to Parasyte. ;)
>> ARTICLE
Ah I was comparing the anime storylines since that's the only experience I have. Although it would be interesting to see if Togashi was inspired to write the Ant arc because of Parasyte.
>> ARTICLE
That would be interesting. :) I've never watched or read HxH myself, but I would like to someday.
>> ARTICLE
It may be our only option seeing as the series ended and Togashi is still writing. I mean, I assume that Madhouse will pick it back up at some point once there's enough source material, but that may take a while, and I don't want to let my feelings for the show fade.

That was pretty good, when's the second half of the episode coming out? No seriously, this is the first time the end credits actually caught me by surprise. I swear to God I was only watching for like ten minutes ...

So, everything's over now? All Shinichi needs to do is clear things up with the police, and he can continue with his life, go back to school and keep banging Murano. That serial killer guy is still out there though. I hope they're actually going to do something about him.

Next episode is about the serial killer guy.

Yup, its all done. Confess time and pack for day trip to beach...

Just want to put this out there, he is wearing the philosophy shirt during this fight, and the episode ends with several deep philosophical questions and opinions, nice little touch

Ok, I don't get it though.

Shinichi spared him because he thought maybe gotou was good for the earth. Humans are destroying the world and gotou is just living how he knows how to. Migi suggests that maybe it's okay to be selfish since the earth doesn't feel, but humans do.

In Tokyo, probably. But there were parasytes everywhere on Earth, so unlikely. Also, there might have been some parasytes in Tokyo that weren't part of the mayor's group, but I doubt it(as his group wanted to co-exist...so they probably killed them)

There are tons of Parasytes worldwide. Plus there were likely lots more in other regions of Japan. They only killed most of the ones in the immediate area. But I bet other governments are going to start setting up Parasyte-hunting teams and agencies soon. Gotta purge the xenos.

That and during the episode when the government guys are talking about how to identify the parasites they said America was trying to weaponize them.

^Shinichi ^no...
>> ARTICLE
Baws
>> ARTICLE
He's more parasite like than migi at this point kinda crazy but i'm loving the direction the story is taking!
>> ARTICLE
That's not the reason why he had said that... Well it kind of is, but he said that because he is still human and begins to turn insane. He is becoming more insecure as well. And he is far from as parasyte'ish as migi.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I'd say Migi is still more of a parasite. Migi still wouldn't hesitate to kill anyone if it meant that he got to survive, whereas Shinichi still tries to save as many people as possible. Migi also doesn't seem to feel any emotions, not even anger or fear or pity. Shinichi has definitely become colder, but he's still not close to becoming a full parasite. And that's exactly why I can't wait to see how far he'll go!
>> ARTICLE
They did however establish that the parasites do have (or can acquire) emotion on some level (introduction of laughter).  That could go several directions, maybe they acquire certain attributes from their host?  Who knows?  Interesting none-the-less.    
    
[I've seen one other particular series where the parasite gains attributes of its host, it's also my favorite universe ever developed in fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28creature_in_Alien_franchise%29).
>> ARTICLE
The episode was just highlighting how the parasites are beginning to gain emotions. God that natural laugh scene was creepy. There was also the scene when migi was going off about how hard a life Shinichi has had to the private detective. It's still in the early works but I feel it's foreshadowing for that moment when human and parasite trade moral ground.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like migi does have some sort of emotions, or atleast from a human point of view you would probably consider them emotions. He is worried about his own existence and does fear he will be exposed and die. It is probably more accurate to say Migi has no emotions that aren't neccesary for his own survival.
>> ARTICLE
Migi seems to lack emotions, however, he seems to have at least a basic understanding of human emotions.
>> ARTICLE
Right, what we see in each episode is the steady improvement of Migi's grasp of the emotional nuances in language. 

However, that's not to say it's all artificial. He's employed human emotion with Shinichi in situations where it's less than necessary.

* Migi estimated that 30% of its cells were dispersed in Shinichi's body. It's arguable he's receiving feedback on a subliminal level from the cells in Shinichi's heart, eyes, and brain (that's where the concentrations seem to be). 
* Couple that with TR's laughter hinting at parasites having *some* emotion, I imagine that means Migi's most developed emotion(?) is empathy since he's struggled to comprehend Shinichi while studiously studying human knowledge through texts and the internet.
>> ARTICLE
It's more appropriate to say that Migi has instincts than emotions.

Between that an "Out of the way, Humans!", he's breaking the fuck down

Quiet.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't understand... how did she train the baby to shut up every time she says "quiet"?
>> ARTICLE
Abuse of some kind i.e. negative reinforcement. The (or else!) is implied and is anchored to a tangible event.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I see that you've trained your baby well!

So if Migi can morph into someone's face...he could morph into Murano's face...and then Shinichi could...make out with Murano...or even...OH GOD NO...ERASE THAT IMAGE.

Begone infidel!

Too late buddy. The damage is done.
>> ARTICLE
I like you! Thinking outside the box!
>> ARTICLE
well, I think Migi could also morph into a box if you understand what im hinting at ;)
>> ARTICLE
I have a sudden urge for a Parasite.. for science purposes of course.
>> ARTICLE
You mean Kana.
>> ARTICLE
He was never interested in that stalker.

Edit: Dislikes? I guess people can't handle the truth. She wrapped a piece of his hair around her finger for fucks sake. 
>> ARTICLE
But WE love her
>> ARTICLE
I'm not hating that, i'm hating the fact that people ship them. She was interesting sure, but that doesn't change the fact that she was a massive stalker.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't you know? We eat that shit up

Murano in the front, Kana in the back....

.... What have I done.

He could morph into a lot more than her face (   )

Yeah, like a dick.

With Migi's memory it would be the ultimate spank bank.

Gotta love how Shinichi and Migi essentially played good cop, bad cop.

Edit: [WHAT THE FUCK SHINICHI?] (http://i.imgur.com/S3gIjzk.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I mean, he *did.* And they were a parasite who ate his mom, so it's not like it was terribly morally dodgy of him to do so.
>> ARTICLE
No he didn't, Joe did. Remember?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I forgot about that, I reread that part of the manga literally right after I posted that comment (because I had to check something and it's the only volume I own) even. *facepalm*
>> ARTICLE
It's alright. It is kind of strange that he says that though..
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this is basically where my memory of the manga just completely drops off until the ending, so I'm curious where they're going with that.
>> ARTICLE
Both the parasites changing into the face of the reporter had me giggling. 
>> ARTICLE
If they get some more faces, they can play [Guess Who?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F) together
>> ARTICLE
The scene was the most hilarious one in the whole series imo
>> ARTICLE
he....he.....he.....he....he.....HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
>> ARTICLE
I was loving it when they both intimidated the inspector.
>> ARTICLE
That entire scene was so surreal, I loved it. Any scene with Uda is great so far.
>> ARTICLE
It's little unique interactions like this that really put this series over the top. The action is tense and the evolving psychology of Shinichi and the parasytes is interesting, but I really love all the quirky shit Migi does during down time. It almost always cracks me up.

It appears everyone got surprised by "I killed that person" and forgot the marvelous "OUT OF THE WAY HUMANS!!"

i fucking loved it!! Almost like tokyo ghoul TRES BIEN guy
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I went "Holy Shit" when he said that.
>> ARTICLE
Migi used Empathy. It was Super Effective!
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I just *love* Uda and ~~Parasyte~~ "Joe". They're such an excellent comparison to Shinichi and Migi. Whereas Shinichi and Migi have encountered tragedy after tragedy and Shinichi has just gotten more and more brutal, Uda is the exact opposite. He's still living a relatively normal life and doesn't seem to have any major issues. He's just happy to help his friend. Joe's totally different from Migi as well. He seems to be a lot more "human", given his sense of humour and just seems more natural, likely from watching so much TV. They both are just so laid-back and casual compared to our protagonists; it's sometimes really jarring to contrast them, and gives a good indicator of how much Shinichi has changed.

I really don't want either Uda or Joe to die, but those guys are unfortunately very unlikely to survive. :(
>> ARTICLE
I think the breaking point for Shinichi was when his heart stopped and Migi infised some of his cells into his bloodstream. That's where Shinich has started becoming more and more like a parasite himself. While Uda had no accident like that, so he didn't develop the same way Shinichi did.
>> ARTICLE
When Shinichi was like "Who can we call on that's an ally?" I was like "OOH! OOOH! Teacher! Teacher! I know! Pick me!"  

I'm so happy to see that guy back, he's such a goofball, I kind of love him.  

I think he'll stay out of the line of fire, though, he's mostly harmless.

Man, I always knew lectures are nightmarishly boring, but that lecture hall filled with CGI students is literal nightmare! 

Edit: He..he...he..he.he..he...he..*eyes roll back*..he....he...he...he

I guess we have our candidate for sexiest laugh of 2015...he...he... step aside Annie
>> ARTICLE
damn i didn't notice them at all this time
>> ARTICLE
That lecture was sorta like the gist of the book selfish gene. Nice to see they put in some info
>> ARTICLE
I'm really surprised and delighted to see that the creator of Parasyte is actually delving into some of the scientific theories of altruism, and selfishness. I feel like most stories don't get this sort of stuff right and it makes the story seem a little unbelievable.
>> ARTICLE
All this talk of bad CGI and I have yet to notice it. Am I just inattentive?
>> ARTICLE
I really didn't notice, but it may be because the lecture itself was actually quite interesting and I was really listening to it (well...reading the subs).
>> ARTICLE
I haven't either, I'd say it's best we enjoy our superpower before someone takes it away.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't notice either
>> ARTICLE
yes
>> ARTICLE
Usually I don't notice them but there were quite a few in the lecture hall scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I just focused on the teacher and Tamiya, and what he was saying, rather than the background.
>> ARTICLE
I was trying to read the subtitles cuz I was interested in what he was saying, and it was going pretty fast, I didn't have time to look at the background.
>> ARTICLE
If you don't pay attention to the "extras" you probably won't notice them. 

I'd advise looking at the pedestrians in crowd scenes etc if you want to spot them.
>> ARTICLE
So is Migi becoming more human?
>> ARTICLE
It's possible, but I for one interpreted the scene as evidence that Migi's getting better at understanding the human thinking process and by extension he's getting better at manipulating people.
>> ARTICLE
So much this.  I've been seeing a lot of people saying that scene made Migi seem human but to me it reinforced his parasyte mentality even more.  It was a two fold emotional attack to convince a threat to join his side.  

Lash out to induce fear, hit him with a guilt bomb while he's shaken, then let him know the side he's on is more likely to kill them.  Migi's understanding of emotions have definitely evolved, but he's still using the knowledge for extremely logical things.
>> ARTICLE
Or are we becoming more parasyte?  
>> ARTICLE
It's all perspective isn't it?

Depends on how strict you use your synonyms, aren't all living being parasitic of something else?

[Heh i called it(kinda)](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2qaqh2/spoilers_kiseijuu_sei_no_kakuritsu_episode_12/cn4ftqp).

I cant wait to see how it plays out though. I would be extremely sad though if migi "dies" at the end to like save murano because he knows how much she means to shinichi. But then again that is kind of obvious. 

You know what im thankful for though? The fact that speculation isnt ruined by manga readers in these threads. Idk if it is because the manga is super old but i have a hard time resisting spoiler tags i know i shoudnt read so to those who have read the manga and have stayed pretty quiet with future events, [i salute you guys](http://tikigod784.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/minori-taiga.jpg).
>> ARTICLE
I hang in both weekly discussion thread and /a/, and I must say the Parasyte manga readers in reddit are very mature and does play "oh look, I know more than you therefore I'm superior" card.

While at in /a/, I saw the (assumably, young) readers number grow and the spoiler begin to fill the room since episode 5.
>> ARTICLE
once you get past 4chan nonsense, /a/ seems like it has far more community compassion than /r/anime. It's kinda sad.
>> ARTICLE
Agree, I learn a lot from 4chan, hence I still go there. You just have to mental filter those that are irrelevant to you.
>> ARTICLE
They're compromising. 
>> ARTICLE
How very human.
>> ARTICLE
A legitimate, accurate biology lecture on altruism and evolutionary psychology in Parasyte, *and* it relates to the story and events that are currently happening, and the main themes? Fuck yes! Parasyte continues to impress. I'm also loving the opposite character developments that Shinichi and Migi are undergoing... this is too good.
>> ARTICLE
I would call it relevant and passable, but "therefore love doesn't exist" is a rather stupid (non) sequitur that would snugly fit into some creationist/anti-Dawkins argument.  
>> ARTICLE
They said it was just a theory though, nothing wrong with a little bit of fiction anyway :P
>> ARTICLE
Agree about the love bit being...odd. But I was really happy just to see them actually address altruism being an evolutionary trait and not just silly human idiocy.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, that one bit definitely was a leap of logic. The rest was fine though; I suppose you could say that the lecturer meant love as an abstract concept doesn't exist independently of human biology in the same way that the mind/soul doesn't actually exist in any abstract way, but nothing like that was made clear and I doubt any real lecturer would say something as blunt, simplified and redundant as 'love doesn't exist' - unless they were the kind of lecturer that tries to sensationalize their subject.

I was under the impression it was a philosophy class, and he was just tying in actual science to make his point more valid.

Yeah, same. I haven't burst out laughing while watching anime in a long time.

The students' reactions made that scene, in my opinion. They had kind of a "well, would you look at that" expression on their faces.

It's both black humor, and terrifying.  

Like, that absolute monster has an infant in her possession. I mean, when she used it as a shield later on, that just kind of solidified it for me.  

I'm scared for that baby's life. I honestly thought she was going to toss it off the roof cuz she knew that Shinichi would chase after it rather than fight her. Seems that she's smarter than I am, though, cuz she still kinda did the same thing. Little cuddly meat shield, ha ha, activate MC Hammer mode, cuz ya Can't Touch This.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god they just had to show the P.I. had a family...
>> ARTICLE
The poor P.I. has tons of deathflags now. I don't see him surviving past Episode 18, especially not now that Tamiya knows that he was compromised.
>> ARTICLE
This show just knows how to get better and better doesn't it?

Shinichi laughing at the very end there and the look he gave was so chilling. He's slowly but surely getting more lost to his parasite side. Even calling the students "humans" as he ran past. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, that was intense. Best mom Ryoko using her kid as a shield and still able to keep him quiet. Shinichi's getting darker and darker. I think Shinichi could've taken her even with the baby. "Handle the baby Migi."

Looks like they've gained expressions. Haven't seen one laugh til now and Shinichi sure did have a new expression. 

I can't wait to see how he handles the situation with her. She can't bring the baby everywhere she goes. 
>> ARTICLE
> She can't bring the baby everywhere she goes. 

Right! So they'll meet again in a cinema.
>> ARTICLE
Well when you just have to say "Quiet." to shut him up I bet she could take him to the cinema.

Plus I don't think she's the kind of person that would give a shit that babies aren't welcome in cinemas...
>> ARTICLE
> Best mom

Her next identity will be no doubt supernanny. She'll be racking up mountains of cash with that instant mute skill.

>> ARTICLE
No new OP...  Perhaps we'll have this one the entire time?  I'm kinda okay with it.

God I love Uda's parasite.  "YEAH, NO SHIT."

THIS BITCH'S LAUGH IS CREEPY.

Migi defending what Shinichi has gone through has satisfied me immensely.  I really like this episode.

And holy fuck how the episode ends...  Yeah.  One of my favorites thus far.  Time for my balls to turn blue for a week.  Or two, if they want to open a hole in my heart again.
>> ARTICLE
> Or two, if they want to open a hole in my heart again.

Just kill them if they do that.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you i really like the opening song although maybe an animation change in the opening might be nice, similar to what Hunter X Hunter did
>> ARTICLE
I swear i watched the op like twice, then went back to check if the op was the same, then watched it again. I was dissapointed when i saw this comment because i swear there is something different but i cant figure out what.
>> ARTICLE
To me, it seemed like Shinichi's face as he falls down in the end is different. Earlier, it was a face of shock and not knowing what was going on, but now, it's a face of rage.

Nice catch. This scene got brushed across really quickly, whereas in the manga there was a pause implying Shinichi questioning his humanity.
>> ARTICLE
Is it possible that Migi is somehow "absorbing" the emotions that Shinichi is losing? Because that's what it seems like
>> ARTICLE
Although that's pretty interesting isn't Migi just probably trying to manipulate the PI ?
>> ARTICLE
Not a bad theory, thought of it myself earlier. But wouldn't that mean that part of Migi fused into Schinichi's brain, thus making Schinichi become more of a parasite.

So it was already established that Shinichi was becoming more parasite-like. This episode confirmed my suspicions that both the teacher and Migi are becoming more human-like as well, with the whole laughing and "look at all he has been through" shit.

That's considered incorrect translation. Fan sub did that simply he/they felt like to while the source material never ever refers to the protagonist as "Shinji".

Well, that was an entertaining episode. It had its [funny](http://puu.sh/ewuqT/c173b07a8b.png), [scary](http://puu.sh/ewvap/5a3812f66f.png) and [creepy](http://puu.sh/ewvcx/920d10aadf.png) moments. Didn't expect him to say [this](http://puu.sh/ewycz/10d1a9e415.png) out loud, for some reason I giggled. 

Also, they need to make some new CGI models, seriously, [this dude](http://puu.sh/ewwAx/5e007e2cb6.png) has appeared so many times during the show, there was at least 3 of him in the same room in this episode.

I like that the parasites are evolving, that speech Migi gave to the PI showed that she just might have actual emotions towards shinichi. 
>> ARTICLE
That laugh will give me nightmares tonight...
>> ARTICLE
The OP is just godly. I hope they never change it. The ED is great too. Moving aside, Uda and his parasyte are kinda funny. The P.I guy is also interesting. DAT LAUGH, creepy shit, ahahahah. The lecture about the selfish gene was also very interesting, maybe it's some kind of foreshadowing. The conflict between Shinichi and Ryoko (~~worst~~ best mum) was really intense, dat music, one of my favorites tracks ("Hypnotik"). And the ending line, damn. 
Another great episode. It's pretty obvious that both Shinichi and Migi are "trading" personalities, I wonder how they are going to develop that, especially how Shinichi's relationship with Murano is going to play out. 
And the episode was like 5 minutes, not 23. The Hunter x Hunter effect again...
>> ARTICLE
HAPPY PARASYTE DAY!!

"I killed that person." 

Shinichi...you can't just say that man! 

Good episode. Being apart of #MuranoMasterRace it was missing something but hey, next week? :D ^^^Please?
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi becoming more of a parasite, and Migi becoming more human. This is getting really interesting.
>> ARTICLE
The contrast of shinichi's mother probably saving his life when he was little and Tamiya Ryoko using her child as a shield was neat and made the anger/rage much more believable.  They really brought out that scene well in the anime compared to the manga, where it didn't leave a big impression.
[MAJOR SPOILER](/s "It is also such a forshadowing moment, that the one who opened the hole in his chest again is Tamiya Ryoko and she will be closing it.")

This show remains both good, and somewhat a casualty of the episodic structure. Not a lot happens in each episode, and because everything that happens is part of, not merely a narrative, but a process within the narrative, a very gradual change, it's hard to discuss each episode in a discrete fashion. It's not even just a question of "change", as much as it is slowly layering the changes that occurred, and the intricacies which comprise a person's selfhood.

If last week over episodes 12-13 I said how Shinichi is very much a regular normal boy in an abnormal situation, here it seems he isn't. The parasites, both Tamiya Ryouko and Migi seem to be picking up group-oriented behaviour, of which understanding and empathy are cornerstones, not for reasons of "niceness", but because they make working together for the benefit of the group that much more efficient. Shinichi comments on how Migi is acting uncharacteristically, and how it's a "show", but it's a "show" designed to bring about the most beneficial and efficient results. If that is the case, does it mean if it's been actively premeditated or the result of ingrained conditioning?

As it happened, I found Ryouko's laughing scene very interesting, as I likened it to someone wearing someone else's suit and trying to make it work. Why do the parasite faces seem so inhuman, so frozen? Because they only change when their controllers actively think of the emotion they should display. I have previously likened Shinichi to someone who's trying to retrace his old steps, who's trying to walk himself as a puppet through the ruins of his life.

It's the same thing, and then when the episode ended, he too looked like someone laughing not because it's funny, but because he's "supposed to", he too looked like someone moving his body as if by remote control. He no longer feels as if it's his life, his body. He's losing, not his humanity, but his *self-identity* as a human.
>> ARTICLE
that ending gave me chills. watching how much he's changed in just 14 episodes... love it.

I couldn't wait after the last episode and read the entire manga. Now I'm still not sure I can bear waiting for each episode.
>> ARTICLE
In my experience that always makes the wait worse.

I think Shinichi is losing more of his humanity due to the fact that he currently doesn;t have someone like Murano to ground him 
>> ARTICLE
Godamnit! trying to escape exam revision with anime and what do I get? A lecture on altruism and it's evolutionary benefit. Exactly what I'm sitting tomorrow T_T

rant aside, I am surprised they did their research well. What the lecturer said was correct.

From an economic pov, being altruistic makes no sense. Think about it: the ultimate form of altruism, which is to give your life for another, would mean the end of passing your genes. The logical explanation is: we are altruistic exactly because we try to preserve out genes.  
Again, they explained this very well: a mother would give her life for her children because the latter carry her genes.

Infanticide is one of the most interesting thing that I learned: chimps still practice this. Basically, due to paternity uncertainty, male chimps will kill the children. It fulfills 2 role:  
1. the female has now free time to produce more children  
2. no more competition in the new generation.  
Furthermore this had lead to interesting evolutionary traits: in humans, it has been shown that we are able to match a baby to it's father via facial recognition above chance, while it is not possible to to do so with the mother.
>> ARTICLE
This is just speculation as an anime only watcher.

* Migi is acting more and more like a human;
* Izumi is acting more and more like a parasyte;

Migi merging with Izumi! He must be being absorbed by Izumi, he will soon become millions of microscopic copies of himself in Izumi's bloodstream, essentially disappear.

If that's true I imagine Izumi will become one though mother fucker, but pretty inhuman.

Okay... one simple question: **WHEN DOES THE NEXT EPISODE AIR?**

The wikipedia episode list ends with today's episode. And I really hope it's not going to be on a break or something.
>> ARTICLE
Fairly certain it always does that. Anichart says it's a week from now so nothing has changed. 
>> ARTICLE
Migi seems to be becoming more human as Shinchi turns more parasyte also the preview seemed as if Murano will learn the truth cant wait
>> ARTICLE
So Migi is slowly becoming more human?  That's freakin' awesome man.  The role reversals.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the part where Migi was reasoning with the PI.  Kind of made me go damn, thank god I'm not Shinchi
>> ARTICLE
I like where the characters are going. I'm not sure if Migi is really becoming more human or if he just learns to better get along with Shinichi. Or is that the same maybe?

Also more [Parasyte Parenting](https://imgur.com/a/3MkS6)
>> ARTICLE
It seemed pretty obvious from some early episodes that Shinichi would become increasingly parasitic in nature and Migi would become increasingly humanlike, but it's still really cool how gradual and well it's being done - especially Migi's transformation. This is the first episode where I could really detect some passion and inflection from Migi. He had always sounded somewhat controlled and monotonic.

Now I'm just wondering whether they end up to become equally humanlike and parasitic or if they will pass each other along the spectrum. At the rate Shinichi is going, I'm betting on the latter. Edit: at this point, he's definitely _crazier_ than Migi, but not quite as parasitic.

I've almost forgotten how Shinichi was before he and Migi merged. It makes me sad.

I thought merciless, shapeshifting, killing machines were the worst kind of menace. But it would be too easy so now they're developing emotions to fit in even better. Soon they will learn about trolling and we're all gonna be fucked. 

On the other hand Shinichi is developing more and more badassery if such thing was even possible at this point.
>> ARTICLE
Tamiya's laugh...I can't remember ever having seen a that creepy laugh animation and sound before.
>> ARTICLE
Its getting harder to wait for the episodes with every episode

Bit of a slower episode overall. I cannot wait to see the how they settle this forthcoming fight between Ryoko and Shinichi that they've foreshadowed so much. I also have a feeling that the guy with the parasite chin will be killed before the series is over.
>> ARTICLE
Every episode I'm reminded of how good Shinichi's character development is, but I can add Migi to it too now :D

I am liking the way they are taking crazy bitch's character. It feels like she is purposely toying with shinichi to see how he reacts to certain things... I'm really liking this series and want to see where it goes.. Still gunning for a happy ending :D

Said it last week and I'll say it again that poor baby. Although I would like to learn the trick to make it stop crying, it could come in handy. Great episode again, that face Shinichi made in the end gave me chills.

First episode discussion I've been able to participate in in over month, fuck yea.

I just caught up on the last couple episodes yesterday and now today I get this.  Back to cliffhangers, back to waiting, back to contributing nothing of worth because I hate essays!

Can't wait to see how much farther down the hole Shinichi will fall.

I like how shinichi tells the guy to get in the car, and he is perplexed as to why the investigator [is so terrified](http://imgur.com/w0icHfj)... you know, it's probably not the alien that sliced his arm open or anything.

This has been my personal favorite anime. MadHouse has done a fantastic job!
>> ARTICLE
This show is getting so good it makes everything else look garbage. It's tackling some interesting philosophical and scientific questions (altruism, evolution for example) without being overbearing - instead coming across as really engaging.

All of that mixed with some believable characters and some solid action and you've got yourself a brilliant show.

Guys.. they are not going to change the OP right..?^^IHopeTheyDon'tPlease.

A little late this week. Hopefully this thread hasn't completely died down already...

- [00:16](http://i.imgur.com/ma3zFSD.png)  I kind of love the irony of Shinichi's eyes looking void and emotionless up until the moment that Satomi walks away and the obvious regret takes over, proving to the viewer that he isn't as far-gone as she thinks. This exchangethe (anti-)hero pretending to be worse than he actually is to drive away someone he cares about (usually a female love interest) because it's too dangerousis fairly cliched, so I wonder why it didn't bother me too much here. I think it's because we've seen so much of Shinichi's transformation (and the way Shinichi and Migi influence each other, like two stars caught in each other's orbit) that it's actually pretty hard to see the line between Shinichi putting on a tough-guy-I-don't-care act and genuinely being unable to feel an expected emotion. I suspect the case here is that the amount of regret he's able to feel is tangible enough to contort his face and put emotion in those emotionless eyes, but not enough to make him want to call out to her (though it's ultimately up to the viewer's interpretation whether he wants to do that and suppresses it to protect her, especially after the deadly consequences of opening up to Kana, or whether he's no longer capable of that desire to open up).
- [02:23](http://i.imgur.com/vB1zuEW.png)  I'm constantly surprised by the thoughtfulness of Migi's logic. It's so rare for a character intended to be smart to actually comes off as clever.
- [02:35](http://imgur.com/Hm0q1eJ)  Awww, so sweet. This episode is a lot more about the Migi side of their binary star orbital dance.
- [03:28](http://imgur.com/s6ew16J)  It's interesting how Joe has such a harsh "just kill him!" reaction to the private investigator situation. I naturally assumed Joe would be much more "innocent" than Migi because of Uda's cheerful disposition. Part of it is that we've already seen Migi's immediate reaction (which *was* to spring into action to kill the PI), but I thinkby placing Uda's instinctual reaction so immediately after Migi's human-informed onethe show is trying to imply that Shinichi has rubbed off on Migi more than Uda has on Joe.
- [03:50](http://imgur.com/kETmweB)  YES
- [03:52](http://imgur.com/GihwYhv)  YES
- [04:20](http://imgur.com/rHpO849)  This feels like a mostly one-off line meant only to highlight the alienness of the parasites and set up the necessary plot beat later in the episode of Tamiya keeping a relatively similar name. I hope the show explores the idea of naming and how odd it is how much we value labels (specifically, putting things into them) later.
- [04:39](http://imgur.com/ET1fK2D)  This is an interesting line. What does she mean that she didn't mean a doctor for his injuries. What kind of doctor did she mean? Did she mean a psychiatrist? I think that's clearly what he thought she meant (and thus why he thinks she's calling him crazy), but I don't think that's what she meant because she clearly doesn't think he was crazy (and isn't quite strategic enough to pretend to think he's crazy to cover up her own knowledge). I think what this instead shows is her limited understanding of humansshe sees him looking deficient (unwell from stress), and thinks of that as a flaw to be corrected, and doctors are of course where people go to correct things. Her observation of humans thus far has been in how to mirror their behavior and blend in, so learning to look "correct" and avoid deficiencies must have been an important aspect of that.
- [05:06](http://imgur.com/hnv08fP)  Are we supposed to think he's such a bad PI that he doesn't make the connection to the parasite rumors?
- [06:25](http://imgur.com/bI7IlLY)  dat face
- [06:51](http://imgur.com/8oy2p4Q)  This is a pretty interesting look inside Tamura's mental processeshow she mentally organizes observed human behavior. But this is the first time she had a natural reaction without purposefully acting. And, ironically enough, it happened while trying to learn more about Shinichi. She's obviously been orbiting him for a while, but it looks like she's also being sucked into humanity slowly. What makes this so interesting is that it's a completely different kind of "becoming more human" than Migi. We sympathize with Migi because we see him go through radical changes and we see a (albeit weird) mutual friendship with Shinichi develop. But with Tamura? She's still extremely alien, and the small number of human characteristics she picks up just serve to make her even more scary and unsettling.
- [07:25](http://imgur.com/bLfaEru)  Gee, we transition from Tamura's maniacal laughter waking up her child to the PI quietly checking in on his sleeping daughter. I wonder if we're supposed to notice a contrast between the two characters?
- [08:25](http://imgur.com/vsQq9tk)  Hm... Let's take note of his wife telling him that the police should handle a dangerous investigation and that he should know his place.
- [08:36](http://imgur.com/8l9sJdb)  So he clearly became a PI inspired by fictional mysteries. Personally, whether such a cliche motivation works for me depends on whether the story presents it as crucial information or as subtle background informationif it's an important plot beat, then it's hard to avoid how simplistic and cliche it is, but as an extra bit of texture it would feel totally fine. On my first watch of the episode, I thought the blatant framing of the bookshelf (made even more obvious by the Crunchyroll subs declaring the book titles important) was too obvious. But, on my second watch, I noticed that the shot of the bookshelf is fairly quick and never directly brought up in conversation, so I have to come down on the side of liking this detail. It also (along with the "I'm gonna surprise everyone!" line immediately following this) goes a long way towards explaining why he keeps investigating someone that is clearly dangerous.
- [08:53](http://imgur.com/gXLhGi5)  Can they at least send sexts telepathically?
- [09:20](http://imgur.com/iVoL3oO)  He sure looks happy for someone struggling to feel emotion.
- [09:56](http://imgur.com/bBbAJxj)  I'd like to see that parasite.
- [09:59](http://imgur.com/dfPdFAu)  Modifying his jaw so he won't give away his identity is a cool concept.
- [11:13](http://imgur.com/cS8UQN8)  This is the first time we've had a mostly un-affected observer know about the full situation, so it's the first time someone has the perspective to realize that Shinichi is weighing his own survival above his species'. For all his talk about not killing other humans, what if avoiding being researched causes the deaths of thousands? And where does this fit into the show's favorite theme of human nature vs. animal instincts? Animal instincts don't factor in human values like empathy, but they also place preserving the species as the highest value. I suppose we'll get to that later
- [11:47](http://imgur.com/BEJ9pej)  Cool how intimidating a tiny eyeball up in someone's face can be.
- [11:50](http://imgur.com/tUBojYA)  Needles in the face!
- [11:58](http://imgur.com/x7JlQBY)  HOLY CRAP HIS EYEBALL APPENDAGE CAN HAVE SCYTHES TOO!
- [12:15](http://imgur.com/ddwphlN)  The story Migi tells to the PI so vastly misses the point. How tragic his tale his has no bearing on whether turning himself in would help the rest of his species. But that makes this Migi telling this story so much less traditionally-migi-like.
- [12:54](http://imgur.com/TY0qHZN)  Uda and Joe certainly take double chin to the extreme.
- [13:46](http://imgur.com/EJL8DPu)  The pacing of ending the conversation with the PI rather abruptly and then jumping to this call is rather strange. Maybe it's just because the show is so fond of scenes with Shinichi and Migi walking around that this felt out of place.
- [14:22](http://imgur.com/xLVvA2l)  My first reaction to this scene was "ugh, a surprisingly relevant lecture in the background", and groaned twice as hard because of how blatantly the lecture was highlighted as being important. I thought it was like Kill la Kill's fascism lecture or Escaflowne's Isaac Newton/gravity, but if the creators had paused those background details and said "SEE, AUDIENCE? LISTEN TO THIS" (the way that KLK scene mixes in world building to distract you from the lecture is brilliant). But after hearing that Tamura attended this specific lecture for its topic, I really don't think it's similar to those "semi-hidden message telegraphed through background dialogue" scenesthis is all about the specifics of what Tamura is observing.
- [14:27](http://imgur.com/ZnNjTI9)  This scene could have been staged as highlighting the girls behind Tamura gaping at her baby, with the lecture as background decoration, but instead we experience it from Tamura's perspectivewe're hanging on every word of this extremely relevant lecture, and the girls' gaping is an annoying distraction from important details.
- [14:35](http://imgur.com/kWwiiqk)  Hm, I wonder which non-human species this is implying by association...
- [15:13](http://imgur.com/HGkYOlo)  Does the fact that Tamura's child doesn't share her DNAor even her speciesmake this theory less applicable to her? I would assume so, but we'll see...

Shinichi is becoming harder and harder to empathize with as a character. It's part of a *very* interesting plot, but this lack of empathy is somehow making this show less enjoyable to watch for me.

That put a chill down my spine there at the end.

I don't like where this is going. Not one bit.

That's the CG classroom from my nightmare 

Edit: AND HOLY SHIT UDA IS FINALLY BACK

Serious thoughts on the episode: I really like that Shinichi and Migi are essentially swapping characters but not in a way that's just out of nowhere *cough Tokyo Gohul cough cough*. What Migi said to the P.I. really touched me.

Out of curiosity to any Japanese speakers, how well does the next episode's title ("Something Wicked This Way Comes") translate in terms of subtext? Are the creators specifically calling out Shakespeare here, or is it just a poetic fancy of the translators of something that would more commonly be read as "something bad is coming"?

When that fortune teller appeared, my brain screamed: "Oh great, it's the author..."

*For those who haven't picked up on that, random strangers like fortune tellers are often used to enact god's-intervention to give characters that extra push in the direction desired where nothing else in the established universe can.*

Parasyte's had such good writing thus far, it was lousy to see that trope pulled out, but the development was worth it, so I'm not too bitter.

----

And oh my gosh, the way TR held that baby as she left the lecture. Has she not seen a single example of standard parenting?! WTF!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for ruining it for me.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if fortune telling was a trope back in 1992, but yes its true. This scene is a plot device.
>> ARTICLE
Well my (and a lot of other people's) prediction that Migi will slowly become more human while Shinichi becomes less so...now I wait and see if my hopes come true, and we end up with a altruistic, but very emotionally muted, parasyte killing team.

I would like to see the migi shinichi change but in the end i would like to see shinichi get back to normal because its sad if he will continue like this :'(

O.O that ending face...*shiver*.  Still eager to know waddafuq is up with that baby.  I love how the allied parasite talks, he's so delightfully vulgar that it's almost cute.

Shinichi has really changed. I liked him more before.

Dat ending.

Seriously, I think we are witnessing Shinichi's slow decent into darkness...the difference between the guy we met in episode 1 and now is night and day. I pray the outcome of it isn't as foreboding as that last scene implies...
>> ARTICLE
Another great episode. The lecture got a bit silly with "Some people theorize that love doesn't exist" (because it's more that "love doesn't exist independently of human biology" and that sort of thing), but otherwise it was pretty straightforward and grounded. Provides some interesting context for the themes of the show.

That scene of "Tamura Reiko" laughing was downright freaky. And then she just taunts Shinichi about his mom dying. What an asshole. (But then she is a parasite, so I guess that's pretty standard.)

I like the PI character... But now we've been introduced to his family. I am worried. That scene where both Migi and Joe/Jaw turn into the guy's face was unexpectedly hilarious, though.

Definitely intrigued to see where the story goes next.

All these Shici losing his humanity statements, I can't get behind. He still cared about not killing the guy who has been trailing him for this entire time. I can understand his position his mom was killed and Tamya just laughed that shit off like it was no big deal. Then used her son as a shield, dude that's just not something anyone can forgive right there. He's a teen going through troubles no one can comprehend.

Shinichi stop it!!! You are abandoning everything about your humanity! Ugh, he's totally going to get caught now

Is it just me or was that episode not really fluid storywise. It just felt like someone said "and then... and then..." the whole time and not like things are flowing naturally. That sudden call/meeting with the teacher and the fortune teller just felt out of place.

The flow of time various in this material. It compress when there are actions, flow like slice of life between actions. And then there are episodes like this: plot device. It's true these events felt forced, but they do fall into their places later on.

This show really needed to be only 13 episodes long. It just feels very dragged out. Hopefully the last story arch will be worth all this character building or whatever this is.

If you don't like the show, you could go do something else more productive.

It's going to turn a bit more action packed towards the end doe.

Dude do you even know there's a fucking manga? They're sticking to the source material, things are still building up. We're not even at the climax yet.

but if they have made it from a tv script it would be so much shorter. Movies that are adapted from books are not 5 hours long just to show all scenes. This would never work for movies or television, i dont know why its accepted in anime, and dont just downvote me, please explain
>> ARTICLE
Woah, woah woah back up there kiddo. Are you telling me that cutting content from the source material is a good thing? Because I really have to disagree on that one.

Western adaptations generally do this, where they cram in a book into a 90 minute film. And most of the time it's disappointing. The question isn't why anime gets away with sticking to the source, but rather why it's OK for movies to cut (often vast amounts) of content. Sure, some content has to be cut for adapting to another medium, but in a reasonable fashion.

Maybe I'm just traumatized by having Eragon adapted horribly, but that's my take on things.
>> ARTICLE
You can't make a movie without some editing and cutting of the original book. Unless the book was written for sole purpose of it being made into a movie. They just don't mix. 
Maybe in future we will have super long detailed movies. Or short books with dry dialogue and no inner monologues, but in present they would never sell nearly enough to make any reasonable profit.

I'm wondering why Migi switched up their go-to strategy of Migi handling defense while Shinichi takes the offensive.   That has already worked twice with no problems.  Why switch it up with Shinichi being evasive while Migi goes all out?  

Is Migi just testing Shinichi?
>> ARTICLE
 Its a strategy that wasn't really open to him before the "mixing" and is likely more effective.  Shinichi can, using this stratagem, focus on protecting Migi's only weakness (human organs) while Migi focuses full offense against a parasyte that is splitting focus between offense and defense.

Migi is a more natural choice for offense too due to his numerous sharp bits.


edit:  To expound a little more; the previous strategy was similar, it split attack ad defense.  But, it required the enemy parasyte to dismiss the host as a threat entirely to be effective.  Any misstep by shinichi there would have lead to A noticing Shinichi's attack in time to stop it, making the fight *much* more even.

Would love a comparison of that nightmare scene.

The scene with the parasite meeting was fantastic. These emotionless creatures don't care about presentation or social structure if they don't have to. All they need to do is be able to hear the voices of the other parasites, so they sit randomly. Very subtle and very entertaining. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh it's not so much that they don't care about presentation or social structure as it's that their form of communication is rather rudimentary compared to humans.

Humans would want to face each other as part of the communication involves facial expressions and body language alongside speech. Parasytes on the other hand discussed solely through speech.

So Miki means three trees, huh? But, where is he [hiding the third one?](http://i.imgur.com/BtA8QOw.png)  I'm guessing it's probably in his head.

Also, the writers should really let Murano out of [character development jail](http://i.imgur.com/i39yacj.png) at some point.

Finally, Shinichi's brain has been having a big old party without him.  Good to finally see the representation of his inner turmoil.  He's, [kind of adorable?](http://i.imgur.com/G0AGhDJ.png)

Yeah sure his third one is in his "head" 
I cant be the only one who think his third parasite is located a little bit lower :P

If the head isn't the third one he'd still have a human brain like Shinichi.

Another "human" parasyte who sides with the parasytes would be interesting but I don't think that's the case.

The third tree is his donger, you've heard it here first
>> ARTICLE
Murano has been handled pretty realistically so far, she should be conflicted on what to think. Shinichi throws a dead dog in the trash and then he saves her by jumping out of the school building. He fluctuates in his emotions which would confuse anyone. Though she deserves more screen time for sure.

yea im assuming one is the head  so it can focus on facial expressions Shinichi did say hes never seen such an expressive parasyte.
>> ARTICLE
All regular parasytes take over at the head, that's why you see them always using the head to transform into their weapon. This guy from the looks of it has one in the head, and one in each hand.
>> ARTICLE
I was under the impression that he was just like Shinichi, except has 3 parasytes. I don't think his brain has been taken over.
>> ARTICLE
I was also thinking this. 
>> ARTICLE
Or he's been involved with so many humans that he started to learn human traits, like Ryuko.
>> ARTICLE
But he would still be very fast to learn those traits considering Ryouko only showed one really weird laughing scene. And no human would have been fooled by it like Shinichi was in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Ryouko is a fast learner, she just doesn't care about those trivial matters.

Miki on the other hand, decides to become more expressive. I would say it is a mix of personality and willingness.

>> ARTICLE
maybe the top head's main focus is to emulate human behavior and expression and to control his two alien appendages so his dedicated function leaves little ability for him to morph his shape and attack. If was just the one in the head then it would only serve as a espionage type Parasyte and not an offensive one
>> ARTICLE
Plus it Parasytes need to take over the brain to control the body....although that guy did seem to have trouble using his legs so i could be wrong.
>> ARTICLE
> although that guy did seem to have trouble using his legs so i could be wrong.

nice catch. Yes, it is hinted controlling multiple parasytes in one body can be a bit tricky
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it is more complicated to coordinate the body with three parasytes involved. Even though the parasytes in the arms should have no control over the legs (like Migi can only control the right arm) there could still be some kind of interference between them considering they can sense each others basic thoughts and intentions.

That is what i was thinking as well, but i cant say i wouldnt like seeing an evil human/parasyte hybrid, even if its kind of cliche. But im pretty sure that wont happen because there wouldve been more build up so i dont think that is who Miki is.

So he has three Parasytes in one body, but there is only one conscience. Sounds like earlier when Migi was asked to join a Parasytes arm he was going to get a raw deal, hes lucky he stayed with Shinichi. 


Though it makes you wonder if Shinichi's case is more common than you think, because I don't think there would be any Parasyte who would have gotten into that body and given up it's conscience willingly knowing that. 


I'm interested to see how Shinichi and Migi win this one, i'd guess it would have something to do with being in the forest, or something like the power of each Parasyte head is weakened when it is one conscience, unlike the two consciences that Shinichi and Migi collaborate with.

If it meant survival, I get the feeling those parasytes would choose assimilation.  I'm sure they weren't given much choice.

This isn't the first multi-parasite-one-body scene.

All three healed and fine minutes later.
>> ARTICLE
huh?
>> ARTICLE
What's confusing?

As Migi said in this very episode, the human body is the weak part of any parasyte. Yet, looking back on Gotou's Yakuza party, we see that he was clearly injured in more than one limb and healed (before switching bodies, of course, but his arm clearly spat the blade out, so it was obviously a parasyte).
>> ARTICLE
Switched bodies? they can just change how they look.
>> ARTICLE
HA, indeed, I wonder what will become of that guy. Haven't seen him in a while.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, we have, he was the naked guy playing the piano. He nabbed a new body immediately after the Yakuza fight, which is who we saw playing the piano.

Not a new body - he just stole a suit and changed his face. Jumping between bodies is too high risk to do it for something so simple.

Ah yes indeed. And then to say that i read the manga! My memory is bad.

Surprisingly the detective is one of the smarter human characters. Everyone else seems like they go out of their way to find Parasyte's, then again before this episode he was trying to do that too. Atleast he wised up and backed out of things before he got killed.

Well, the parasyte organisation whatever its called is aware of him, I doubt it'll be long before he gets killed, even if he has backed out.

I feel like Shinichi's going to be completely insane by the end of the series and end up killing a human/getting killed. I don't think it'll actually happen, but his behavior in this episode was really...concerning?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he's a lot more brazen than he used to be. I think it was discussed in last weeks thread about how it almost seems like they're swapping certain aspects of humanity/parasyte. 

Shinchi being more aggressive and Migi acting more human. Migi had expressed its appreciation(for lack of a better word) for the fact that Shinchi was still okay at the end of this episode. Now that could or could not be interpreted as selfishness or a genuine expression, but man was this a cool episode. 

To touch on what you said about endings- could you imagine if at the end of the series, Shinchi makes a reckless and fatal mistake, and Migi spends its final moments trying to avenge the loss not its host, but of Shinchi?

I don't know when you dropped it, but you should consider picking it back up. It's looking like it's gonna be the anime of the season.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped? God damn blasphemy that is!

Personally, it's becoming one of my all-time favorite anime. It's subjective, of course, but I think it does everything exceptionally, and typically clich aspects of anime are implemented flawlessly in the anime. For example, the abundance of flashbacks that would be overworked in other anime, but it works well in Shigastu wa Kimi no Uso because it most commonly accompanies someone playing (since music of pervasive in the scene, it adds to the enjoyment of a typically unenjoyable aspect of many shows). And the flashbacks ultimately contribute to character development incredibly well, making everything complex but logical. 

I mean, I can totally see aspects of the show that would make people drop it, but I see most of those aspects as positives, rather than negatives, due to the way the show implements it and carries itself about.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say that I have dropped it, but I haven't watched in several episodes. There were a few where just nothing was really happening... Have things progressed a bit now?
>> ARTICLE
Eh. Little by little. My main issue with the show is the constant internal monologues and the complete lack of subtlety.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if I can answer that because I thought a lot happened every episode. I think the pace has picked up a little bit since though. Episode 10-13 has a lot of epiphany moments among the characters.

>> ARTICLE
Migi is cute in a freaky alien kind of way.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that he meant he had a better hight. Shinichi is always Migi's mount, because he is Migi's body. Shinichi has better agility and reflex than the other parasite's body, or "mount". Thus, Migi's wins simply because he has a better host. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. The other parasite has to focus on fighting with its blades in order to fight, whereas Shinichi can duck and weave while Migi fights. That might be Miki's advantage too. One parasite controls the body while the two arms fight.

Wow Shinchi, that plan was brilliant. Simply brilliant.

Parasyte girls: "Why are you taking me to this dark, abandoned place? *tee-hee*, You're so strange"

Wow Migi really split that other parasyte. 

I wonder how the multiple parasytes in one body coexist. They brought it up before by taking control of different parts. I wonder how they communicate effectively though.
>> ARTICLE
I think the head would be controlling everything except for the arms.  I'm not really sure about brainwaves communication.  I think you'd need to train together to develop a fighting style.  Each arm would have its own head and I think that's really important.  They all can make their own decisions especially when its so complex.
>> ARTICLE
> I wonder how they communicate effectively

I don't think they do, that's why it tripped as he was getting off the truck.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't it stated earlier that parasytes could exchange simple information through their brainwaves (what they use to locate each other)? Maybe being in such close proximity has led those three parasytes to become even better at exchanging information in that manner. Or maybe his arms just hop on his shoulders and chat, like the cartoon angel and demon.
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking the third one is probably in his head and helps control or communicate between the arms. He doesn't see to have great balance or use the lower part of his body as well, so maybe its concentrating more on the other two in his arms?
>> ARTICLE
Probably just top-heavy.
>> ARTICLE
The only way for it not to be the head is if he still had a human brain.  
I guess there is some evidence of that since he is unusually expressive for a parasyte and that he only revealed 2 of the parasytes but not the third.  Still it seems a bit far-fetched for the third human/parasyte symbiote in the series to be a part of Hirokawa given how much interest Tamiya still has in Shinichi.

Based on the preview scene and the title "Happy Family", I'm guessing Mr. PI has a one-on-one chat with the Parasyte mob on how much he wants to maintain his Happy Family with his wife and child.

If humanity ever was faced with something like parasites I'd hope that we are at least smart enough to know that if someone is leading you to an abandoned parking garage you're gonna die.

Shit, as far as *some* shounen goes, Parasyte moves at lightning pace.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoy the pacing of the series.  It's not really supposed to be an action-packed shonen battle anime.  I liked how this episode showed the first battle that was genuinely avoidable and how that had big consequences.   Just when Shinichi was getting comfortable handling one parasyte he has to face off against three at once.
>> ARTICLE
Are they hinting that his weakness is him not being able to fully control his body? 

>> ARTICLE
HAPPY PARASYTE DAY!

HOLY FUCK. When Murano ran towards the gate, I fucking SCREAMED. God damnit Parasyte! WE'VE LOST ENOUGH! I felt a whole lot more human emotion from Shinichi than I have in the past couple of weeks. I think that Parasyte keeps twisting my emotions for Shinichi around. Seriously though, if you kill Murano I'm going to go ballistic. Great episode, cannot wait for next weeks! Until next time friends. Same Parasyte Time(hopefully), Same Parasyte Channel!

Next week episode will feature the longest fight in this series. I can't take the hype :D
>> ARTICLE
The action was really good this episode. I thought this was one of the stronger episodes so far.

And it may just be me, but I felt a lot of moe from Migi this episode. Idk, just the little things, such as when it said "Oh, wait, scratch that plan!" or when it woke up from its sleep and just realized that there was a parasyte right in front of them.
>> ARTICLE
The decision to take on the parasyte group alone is also pretty important IMO. There is an even bigger gap now between Shinichi and normal humans.
>> ARTICLE
That was the last "person" I expected to be playing Chopin's nocturne...
>> ARTICLE
I wonder about Migi's sleeping patterns. We know that he goes to sleep kind of randomly, but this time he went to sleep pretty early in the day.  
Also does he usually tell Shinichi how long it would be until he woke up?  

I have a sneaking suspicion that Migi realized Shinichi was up to something based on how Shinichi was acting in the school (eager to fight) and in the alley (very willing to hunt down three parasytes) and decided to deny Shinichi by pretending to go to sleep.  
Wouldn't Migi have warned Shinichi about his going to sleep much sooner? Or does Migi himself only realize that he's going to sleep scant seconds before he must sleep?  

That line Migi told Shinichi reminding him that he also needs *his* cooperation kind of stuck with me.
>> ARTICLE
> Also does he usually tell Shinichi how long it would be until he woke up? 

Yes, it has always been four hours.

>Wouldn't Migi have warned Shinichi about his going to sleep much sooner?

It never has.

>Or does Migi himself only realize that he's going to sleep scant seconds before he must sleep? 

That's what it initially said.

Alright, craps gonna hit the fan here in a week. Maybe the mother Parasyte will come help him out or something. 

Also, there's the downvote brigade! It'll be all daijobou, cause I'll up vote everyone in the thread. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't count on Ryouko coming to his rescue since she seems to have interest in how Migi's and Shinichi's fusion affected Shinichi's body. I didn't get the vibe that it is very important for her to get said body alive.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this fight is where shinichi kills the absolute fucking shit metal-style out of Miki, mostly by himself
>> ARTICLE
Another "handle the defense" situation? I would definitly be in for it!
>> ARTICLE
Probably a cardio fight. It's reasonable to assume that Shinichi's parasyte infused body can last longer without getting tired on top of having super human strength. It's already kind of foreshadowed by him outpacing Miki (triple trees dude) running away on foot.
>> ARTICLE
Where's Honey when you need him?

For a second I thought Murano was gonna do something stupid, but I'm glad she stayed. 

Oh man, I'm excited. Wonder how he's gonna beat him. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess it is harder to kill them opposed to staying alive. With his empored body Shinichi could be able dodge even their attacks rather good. But it seems almost impossible to get through the defense two or even three parasytes.
>> ARTICLE
So if this guy has 3 parasytes... maybe the super parasyte we saw massacre those gangsters has even more(like 5, one for each limb plus head). I mean he was already speaking like he was a lot stronger than Miki so if Shinichi and Migi have trouble with him how in the hell are they going to deal with that guy. That will probably be reserved for the final episodes though.
>> ARTICLE
The guy who slaughtered the yakuza (Gotou) had at least three, as we can tell from his injuries:

>> ARTICLE
There is always the possibilitiy but it would feel rather ... cheap to just power them up with more parasytes. I hope the story won't take that turn.
>> ARTICLE
So, is the reason that teacher lady (I always forget her name) has two different patterns when she turns into one because she has two parasites in her skull?  Or is she just skilled?

Either way, pretty good episode leaving me hungry for next week's.  It always feels like an eternity from one week to the next :/
>> ARTICLE
Ryouko is always been know as someone very skillful.

Say, if she has multiple parasytes, wouldn't Migi pick that up?
>> ARTICLE
Ah, yeah, valid point.  I knew she was skillful but thought that it could have been due to being more than one Parasyte - that said, you've brought up the counterargument that kills the theory.

How does Murano still not know Shinichi isn't human? He jumped over than school gate...

She had her eyes closed the entire time. Him jumping from the second (third?) floor of the school building is what should tip her off, because she was conscious of that.

ninjaedit: Unless you mean when he was running from her this episode... That wasn't the most phenomenal feat.

Shinichi being paranoid over that dog and truck driver being a parasyte was quite hilarious.

I thought I sense something weird about pacing. [Manga reader rant, not spoiler](/s "This episode covers the usual 3 chapters length, chapter 37~39 HOWEVER so much content was trimmed, I cannot help to think anime viewers must be all confused. For example, who is that kid following parasytes in the beginning? how did they know P.I. was involved? Who is this Miki guy (he's not even introduced!)? I also felt the dream sequence a little bit off, surely anime can make the scene more connected to the episode than just cut away and not talk about it.")
>> ARTICLE
ya i had no idea who the guy was in the opening scene. 

no idea who miki is.

still thought it was a great episode.

the dream scene i just took as oh yea thats one of the themes is shinichi a monster or not.   



>> ARTICLE
The guy in the op is some sort of assistant the PI has. He basically used the assistant to spy on the parasytes cos he was a pussy + some of them knows his face. 

Miki is a newly introduced character. Afaik he doesn't come out (except maybe as a parasyte in the background occasionally during a meeting) until today's episode/arc.

Since the parasytes can morph into realistic looking people, Miki can have a foursome XD

I doubt he started with the three parasites, I think it's very likely that he has collected them, so to speak.

Goddamnit. Every episode is a huge dick tease.

So... looks he really is a parasyte made of three Parasytes. Talk about planning to take them one by one. Curious to see how Shinichi and Migi deal with him.

Now, one good thing about this show is that the PV doesn't show anything concrete, but those were a lot of not-Shinichi, Parasyte-looking faces, right?

As always great episode. Miki looks like a pretty major threat!

I like that this episode Murano finally begins to realize that there's a **real** evil lurking behind Shinichi's behavior.

Except she doesn't.

No, they are still dogs

Yup, you know exactly the kind of sweet talk woman wants, Shinichi.

Still kissed the girl.

What are you talking about, now I'm not afraid of being chopped up and eaten like livestock anymore. Very effective advice.

Wait a second, this is one of those anime where the MC and the love interest actually don't beat around the bush for ten seasons and kiss on their first date like normal people!?

WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO!?

I don't know what you're talking about... He isn't dating best girl Kana yet.

That was like their third date, actually. But yeah, well done not wasting time on that while presenting a few tender moments.

I was wondering this last week - wouldn't the hair-pull just lead to your immediate death in the majority of circumstances? Poor drunk girl :(

It was nice to see Shinichi acknowledge that when he warned Kana not to do it to people she sensed.

The author is really good at acknowledging small things like that and giving explanations for everything.

Yup, so far everything has been really well built. Im impressed, this has a Borges-esque or Foster Wallace-esque level of attention to running as far and as realistical as you can with a ridiculous premise.

Actually, they worked for Gainax back then. They didn't create Trigger until a few years later.

I didn't realize the play on words I just did

It still adds pressure on the parasytes and makes it harder for them to pass as humans.  It's bad for the individual but ultimately better for the herd.

yeah, they are being forced to kill early, rather then leading the victim to a secluded spot where they wont be seen

Wasn't the double episode last time because we have already missed a week before, thus we should get two episodes next time too. ^^Plz

No. It was because of the movie. So they just gave us two EPs for celebration or something like that.

"Now where was that clone your own stud kit?"
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling that it was more significant than just showing Kana's obsession. It'll probably slowly start to die off since it's likely Shin's hair has some of Migi's cells in it (I mean, you can't just turn into Goku with plain old hair gel), and Kana will find out, etc. etc..
>> ARTICLE
Hair has no cells, so I would be disapointed if this sort of thing happened. A hair from a parasyte dying makes sense because they don't actually have hair, they shape their cells into a hair like structure. That's not the case with Shinichi.

I wonder if that pain Shinichi suffered means that Migi's cells are reproducing themselves like a cancer or something though...

Really liked this episode. Although there were some censorship, I really like the action. It was one of, if not the best action sequence in the entire series so far.

Wow, they going to spend 2 weeks working on next episode??! It must be a good episode!

Will this affect all shows? Is it only one week?

Probably only this channel. If I'm right when I say it's the 2014 FIFA Club WC, then it should only be for 10 days, so it should only be a week.

Holy crap, parasite mafia? We're fucked!

Body-builder guy was hilarious. Seeing parasites are getting better at handling their own body to the Matrix level was scary.

I thought they just excelled at standing still and bashing people with their heads but now they can take care of a group of armed men in close quarters and only get few scratches? Good luck on next case, police!
>> ARTICLE
Heck, that was without their scary head tentacle swords. Imagine those combined with the use of their 4 limbs....
>> ARTICLE
I'm wondering if several parasites can combine to make up an entire human body. That would be some crazy shit.
>> ARTICLE
I believe in episode 2 or 3, there was a parasite that asked Migi to join his body by becoming his right hand.

The parasite that took over Shinichi's mom also managed to transfer heads, so transferring hosts is possible.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 2, the guy chopped off his own hand to offer Migi a spot.

Multiple parasytes may increase hosts life span, but they (parasytes) also need to work out how to coexist under same body. They do have their own thoughts after all.
>> ARTICLE
Also, you need the correct body part. It would be really impractical to have 2 heads or 4 legs, obviously. This means you need several parasites that messed up and got into other parts (arms, legs, torso).

So, it's possible, but very unlikely.

I'd be more worried for Murano, as she's only human, replaceable. Kana seems to serve a greater purpose in the story, I always figured she could act as Izumi's radar or something.

I thought Murano's last scene looked like a death flag, anyways. I guess we'll find out.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Shinichi violently warned her not to approach people that she senses.  She does this anyway and catches Shinichi kissing whats-her-name.  I believe we call this a death flag.
>> ARTICLE
Same. I like Kana a lot more than Satomi.
>> ARTICLE
because kokoro sounds fancy, heart not.
>> ARTICLE
It didn't actually use the kanji for heart .  It was in hiragana .  Maybe that suggests it's not referring to a literal heart but something else?
>> ARTICLE
Most of the titles seem to be literary references, I looked it up, Kokoro is a famous early 20th century Japanese novel about isolation, guilt, and ones self-identity within society during rapidly changing times (its set during the modernization of Japan) Seems pretty apt considering the setup this episode put forth

>> ARTICLE
I hear all the Manga readers complaining about the new character designs, but they look so much better in the anime. The old ones look way to outdated.

Also, Shinichi's "nerdy" character design made his growth to badass MC much more dramatic and pronounced.
>> ARTICLE
Badass Shinichi is actually pretty similar to the manga. And I think the anime character design has been perfect so far. People actually seem different, unique and even realistic in their appearance. Girls are not oversexualized, guys aren't divided into bishounens or stereotipical undesired guys, no characters with vibrant hair colors, and so on.

Not that this things bother me too much in anime, but a show with a serious tone like this demands a serious character design. Shows that try to be edgy and deep while having pink-haired moe blobs are almost cringe-worthy...
>> ARTICLE
Looks like some 80s/90s generic manga girl hair. Also the Picasso monsters are pretty interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte manga started in 1988. Not so weird to have 80s/90s generic manga girl hair.
>> ARTICLE
Oh okay didn't know that! That's pretty cool, didn't know they adapted older manga.
>> ARTICLE
All the non adult characters look quite different from their manga counter part. Adult chars look quite similar to the manga since clothing fashion (teachers/politicians just wear suits all the time) and conservative hair styles haven't really changed. Also all the technology got updated. Shinichi's dad reads from a tablet instead of reading an actual newspaper and Shinichi listens to music from a smart phone instead of a walkman.

>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking something will go wrong, Murano finds out something closer to the truth about Shinichi and he gives a half lie which makes her not like him anymore. Later, Shinichi is forced to tell the truth about himself and the parasites to Kana. Which in turn Kana is able to get closer to him knowing the actual truth. 
>> ARTICLE
[Let the best girl fights begin!](https://imgur.com/a/QguEm)

Unfortunately, Murano is doing a good job of defeating herself. Every time she says Shinichi has changed or asks if he's Shinichi, she loses 5 points. Kana on the other hand is still a new player.

I'm on the fence!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that "pull their hair to find out if they are not human" thing worked out *soooo* well.

Certainly an interesting "Knight in Shining armour" dream. Guess Kana will keep that hair to treasure.

Whoever that guy that took out the Yakuza was brutal. And he was *smiling* the whole time too. 

That crowd mentality "Oh, this monster just walked out of a Yakuza hideout covered in blood. Oh, he is running away, we should chase him down, no danger in that!" That poor last man. So they are testing the limits of their physically it looks like, possibly preparing for a large scale attack?

It does look like many of the fully controlled Parasytes have slightly smaller pupils or thinner eyes.


Kana had the most excellent timing to catch Murano and Shinchi. Then again, he did warn her not to come even when she felt his presence. I wonder if he heard what Murano said after he left or if his hearing wasn't good enough unless he focuses it. Didn't seem like he noticed anything.

Wonder what Parasytes could do with governmental power. Would  anything really change?
>> ARTICLE
I think the hair pulling thing does work for the most part for keeping mass murders in public places down(aside from super parasyte guy killing a bunch of mobsters for the lolz). If she had done that in public, she probably wouldve died along with many others BUT so would the parasyte probably. 

Knowing that most parasytes want to keep their identity a secret, and not die, if there is a common fad that will probably cause both those things if done to them in a public area, i think most parasytes would try to stay away from public areas where getting their hair pulled would be more likely to happen. And seeing as it theoretically keeps them away from the large masses(like schools) it could prevent another massacre(like the one at the school) from happening.

But no one is going to run up to a political candidate to pull their hairs out, and with a staff composed of parasytes they could probably get away with hiding in plain sight that way. Which gives shinichi and the rest of the population a huge problem.
>> ARTICLE
"Now we can identify parasites from normal people!"

Except for when the parasites now know and cause a mass murder, then change shape and continue living

What's so bad about him changing anyway. Sorry I became an absolute beast so that I could save you from a fucking monster.  Sorry I don't care about inanimate objects like carcasses like society tells me to.  Sorry I'm not a whiny little crap who's scared of bugs.  Sorry that my mother died and I "changed" because of it
>> ARTICLE
...I mean, she's known him for how long? And she likes *that* dude. Now he's different, and no longer feels like *that* dude. It makes all the sense in the world. And she's right, of course. Not only has he gone through all these traumatic events but he's literally, physically changed in all these ways.

I agree that it's getting annoying though. I really just want her to know already so we don't have to keep dealing with this particular piece of drama, which I don't find interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Man he should really just tell her about his mom being dead.  Maybe then she'd finally stop talking about how he's changed all the damn time.  It's the perfect explanation.
>> ARTICLE
I keep expecting him to show her his massive chest scar and be all like 'I almost died, and my mom is dead'.

[Romance!](http://imgur.com/Vw2AhzG)

Murano still has her doubts and Kana is still rather oblivious to her own "power." At the same time, the parasites are making their move. Upholding and blending in with society as good as that (running for a political position) doesn't bode well for everyone. And now that Kana has been spotted with Izumi, more dramatic things are bound to happen!
>> ARTICLE
I know people don't like the dubstep or whatever, but I think the OST is actually really good and adds quite a lot to the atmosphere of the show.

I heard someone call this series a "power fantasy" series but honestly with each episode the less and less I'd ever want to be in Shinichi's position.  Sure he's become more powerful and physically capable but at what cost?  He's losing parts of his humanity, making him unable to express his feelings, particularly for Murano.
>> ARTICLE
That fantasy was actually pretty funny.  
    
Ah that's cool, because Migi is in his hand and not his brain it doesn't affect his hair.  
  
Holy shit, those guys got rekt!  
  
A date, that's nice, oh damn and a kiss too. Good, Murano was feeling so down lately, though it looks like it didn't help all that much. I swear to god this better not get her killed. Shinichi is going to have to tell her eventually. I'm guessing she's going to stumble upon Shinichi in a fight and witness Migi in action.

She's still doubting him? Kana would've been a better choice. 

Oh man, I'm expecting a big fight between them. I'm thinking they might had the same treatment as Shinichi. 
>> ARTICLE
Agh I really like Kana.... 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the parasites are trying to "fix" human society to reduce our negative impact on the planet, is known that they consider us a toxin that is putting the planet in danger. One way is to simply exterminate every human, most dumb parasites choose this way, but that's a little hard to accomplish with so many of us. In this episode we see parasites infiltrated in the higher ranks of our society, that parasite running for mayor seems to focus his speech on changing our mentality to preserve the environment and try to coexist without causing damage. This seems like a rather intelligent and safe way of "fixing the human problem", but I am almost sure that it won't work and they will need to rely on more dirty ways to do the "job". Just my thoughts, sorry for my bad English.

EDIT: Grammar
>> ARTICLE
Your English is just fine. :) And I have to agree with your points, I think that they are well founded and that would provide a good reason for the parasites to be making more social moves. Would be cool if they tried some Code Geass level stuff and use politics to create their own nation with super soldiers for an army. Far out there for sure haha.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand how people know to expect something when plucking people's hairs. Last episode, the narrator said that plucking hairs became a common way of greeting someone, not any hint about monsters etc.

Not a lot of dialogue from Migi this episode, I hope to see Shinichi get some kind of idea on what goal to work towards in order to see himself become "his old self" again but right now we're trapped in the crossroads of: "Is it because of Migi's DNA?" or "He is traumatized!".
>> ARTICLE
HAPPY PARASYTE DAY!!!!! (Just got out of work so I'm a little late)

Just once. I wish that Izumi would just tell Murano that his mother died, but it's obviously really hard for him. And I wish that Murano didn't have to be sad. It pains my heart for Best Girl (I will fight whoever denies this) to be sad. Looks like I'll have to wait 3 weeks to see Murano again ;.; "Kokoro" looks to be a Kana only episode. 

All in all, good episode but the feels were in full effect. Poor Shinichi. Also never thought I'd say this but poor Yakuza. :\
>> ARTICLE
So that guy who was beating up all the yakuza... Does anyone else think he may have more than one parasite in him? He was insanely strong, and it seemed that not only his head, but also his arms could change shape.
>> ARTICLE
Was the "we're are kind of like Kitaro and his dad" line a reference to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeGeGe_no_Kitar%C5%8D)?
>> ARTICLE
hello guys, i plan to watch this show, is this good adaptation, i mean is it follow manga thoroughly?
>> ARTICLE
Kana...WHY WHY WHY WOULD YOU KEEP HIS HAIR?!
>> ARTICLE
OKAY ILL SAY IT, seriously fuck this main love intrest, what girl goes on a date and is like "oh yeah btw remember when you left because your mom had the accident" even if she doesnt know his mom was killed shes gotta know that his mom is missing, so who the hell brings up a family tragedy on a date, also if this show has one catch-phrase its "you've changed" and seriously he had a fsmily tragedy happen and theyre in highschool cut him some fucking slack.... Kana's pretty awesome thoughh 
>> ARTICLE
I have the same dream every night, Kana. :P The parasite dude massacring the Yakuza office was pretty brutal, smashing heads like nothing. Also, if Kana has like a parasite radar, you'd think she'd run into one already besides Shinichi!
>> ARTICLE
That dream sequence was great. The parasite horse was particularly nice. Clearly her subconscious knows what's going on.
>> ARTICLE
What is the song that is played in the background at "4:34->6:06
>> ARTICLE
Not very conscientious of the government not to include the part in the hair-plucking fad where the person who's hair you plucked murders you apart. 
>> ARTICLE
Calling it right now, he set up the kiss with Murano to prevent Kana from getting close with him. Or at least as a deterrent.
>> ARTICLE
That dream scene had me in bits ^^
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, that dream..

I think that it's a manifestation of her "Shinichi-radar." which explains why she dreams of his arm morphing like it does in real life.  Also, that's a fucked up looking horse.
>> ARTICLE
Well we got two episodes in one week so we can't really complain :(

Also I feel kind of bad for Kana, dat dream thou.
>> ARTICLE
His super awareness must have notice kana there when he was kissing murano must have felt awkward.

Looking forward to someone finding out his back scar.
>> ARTICLE
Yesss we got a kiss! :D 
>> ARTICLE
Please tell me Kana is not family related to any of the people on the mayors campaign ;_; Great episode, we got to know interesting new characters but we lacked Migi's uncommon sense of humour. I also wonder if the parasytes are trying to fight another parasytes in order to become "the strongest gang" or they're testing out how well can they survive agaisnt the japanese military.
>> ARTICLE
i can't be the only one that thought those things @ the beginning of the episode in the dream looked like titans, right?
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi x KAna all aboard!!! Wait  wait wait there was a kiss!!.

So basically shinichi vs 6 then he saved kana , kana goes wet throws herself into him , voila. Happy ending
>> ARTICLE
Kana best girl, don't even understand why Kanahana's character likes Shiinichi when she keeps complaining hes not the same. Also seeing a group of parasytes team up to run for mayor scares me more than the mafia scene.
>> ARTICLE
Is that my boy RAZOR from Hunter x Hunter?! Got really excited seeing this character design today, shoutout to madhouse
>> ARTICLE
Murano, you got stop asking those stupid questions, seriously. I would be annoyed as fuck if I were Shinichi.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else think Shinichi looks like Aizen?
>> ARTICLE
If murano dies in the show then this show will suck so hard 
>> ARTICLE
Hey guys has Shinichi changed?
>> ARTICLE
Well, looks like the hair trick didn't work.  
Was Kana's dream meant to be that hilarious? Because holy shit, that Migi horse. And muscle Shinichi too, oh my God.  
Wait, she's ... keeping his hair? You're fucking weird, Kana.  
It looks like the parasites are getting more ambitious, with the taking on yakuza groups and getting involved in politics. They appear to be working together as well.  
And Shinichi and Murano finally get somewhere! Wait, Murano, you're still not happy? Bitch, you don't get to kiss a guy and then complain that he's changed, it just ain't cool.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly each week this anime gets better and better. Trying so hard not to go read the manga. Idk why they started that rumor about plucking hair lol that's just putting people at a bigger risk and is kinda fucked up.
>> ARTICLE
- There's a hole...
- B-But.. Shinishi.. We haven't even kissed yet..
>> ARTICLE
Holy Shit
>> ARTICLE
I need to stop watching parasyte while i eat my food, damnit.
>> ARTICLE
We finally have a calmer episode, and more Kana time!

Background music usage for this episode felt a bit off for me. 

Oh what have they done to Gotou's design... [Question for manga reader:](/s "The guy who killed all the Yakuza is Gotou, not one of his 'subordinate' right?")

[Episode 12 Previews](http://imgur.com/a/0QkmV)
>> ARTICLE
Yes it was him. 
And yes Gotou's design sucks. 
People say Madhouse improved the character designs but I strongly disagree. It just way to generic. 
Iwaaki's art is like Fukumoto's. Only one is better than Number one in art.
>> ARTICLE
They changed nothing. Same thing happens in manga. X tests out the theory, confirms it works, and replaces his body becoming the person we will see for the rest of the show.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still in love with the ED, mothafuckin parasyte for mayor
>> ARTICLE


Parasytes are creating a hierarchy of some sort and learning to work together, bad news for humans.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else feel like the relationships in this are a lot like Spiderman (the films)? Kana is Gwen Stacy and Murano is Mary Jane. Gwen's the clear winner here, but Mary Jane gets him in the end...

Shinichi is the fucking man, I hope Murano dies so he loses his last bit of humanity, then he will be perfect

I'm hoping for Murano dying, Shinichi going apeshit, with subsequent Kana x Shin SHIP FULL STEAM AHEAD.

I'm surprised that Murano still hasn't found out about Shinichi's mother.
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit. They're forming groups and working together (...and running for public office!). D:

Meanwhile, Shinichi kisses Murano! YAY. I'm not really a fan of Kana. That dream was funny, though.
>> ARTICLE
I notice that the background music of Kana's dream makes a good wedding bride entrance music.
>> ARTICLE
*That's why* our governments are so corrupt, they have *PARSYTES* :O lol.  That knight in shining armor dream was a hoot, best looking steed I've seen...or maybe it's a parasyte unicorn??  Still glad that the mc x murano ship is still sailing full steam ahead.
>> ARTICLE
Can I just say that the music in Parasyte is seriously one of the best OST's ever?
>> ARTICLE
Is this show split cour or is it going to keep airing until its done?
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi has this constant look in his eyes that he always feels sorry for whatever he's looking at, almost pity, almost empathy.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else enjoying the random dubstep and hiphop beats? My friend and I just marathoned this show, and we laugh everytime the hiphop beat starts and just start freestyling over it LOL. 

P.S. This anime almost feels like a ripoff of spiderman. But I like it. 
>> ARTICLE
Kind of late to the party but if anyone could explain why everyone knew where a Yakuza base was and still acted so casually about it?

>> ARTICLE
I wonder what Shinichi looks like to Migi [in his dream](http://i.imgur.com/KzzhRLY.png)... maybe he looks more like a Parasyte in his subconscious as a reflection of his changing mentality into a cold, calculated killer.
>> ARTICLE
it was already shown last week. He looks like a monster
>> ARTICLE
I'm beginning to wonder... we all know that the supposed BBEG is [shown in the key art, in the background.](http://ani-culture-production.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/parasyte-keyart.jpg) That's obviously the same character as the "Lead" parasite Shinichi had to fight in this episode. But what, exactly, are we seeing in the OP when [this frame flashes briefly?](http://i.imgur.com/KXZURS3.jpg) I've seen a lot of speculation that it's the "bad guy" but as Shinichi slips further and further from humanity, and especially after these dream sequences, I'm beginning to wonder if it's Shinichi that is that monster.
>> ARTICLE
Or maybe he looks like that big muscley naked dude from the other girl's dream.
>> ARTICLE
I really wish they hadn't killed her, just so we could get more of Hokuto no Shin.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously love the fact that her dream was in the style of early 80's shounen manga. That alone makes her best girl.

> the other girl

that's best girl Kana you're talking about #neverforget
>> ARTICLE
Eh. I liked Kana's character design more, but her personality annoyed me.

Something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/MIiM5Nm.png), it's a little after 15 minutes into episode 15.

Shu is also known as our resident Hitler.

Does that just mean spin-kicking everything?
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing this is where Murano "discovers" that jumping over 10 foot fences relates to inhumanity, and then she asks Shinichi *again* if he's still human.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised she is still asking "why is Shinichi so different now" even after he jumped out of the 2nd or 3rd floor of the school, landed on his feet, ran and jumped over the baseball field fencing and be completely okay.

Oh really? What episode are you on?
>> ARTICLE
[episode 20. ](/s "Shinji just "died" again.") This sort of thing seems to happen to him a lot. 
>> ARTICLE
spoilers bro. :(
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Shinji goes through a lot of shit, which is important to the main point that Evangelion is trying to make. You won't get that point until the very end though. 

Episode 20 marks the beginning of the extremely introspective last episodes of Evangelion. You're going to be spending a lot of those remaining episodes inside these characters' heads. This culminates with the last 2 episodes, which are entirely introspection. Some people hate those 2 episodes, but I absolutely love them. It's a brilliant depiction of how a person suffering from severe depression views the world. 

You will not enjoy these final episodes, but you might find them meaningful, like I did.
>> ARTICLE
He should have known something was up when the Latin choir kicked in.
>> ARTICLE
Aaaaaand now One Winged Angel is stuck in my head.

And than phase 4, where he actually splits into 5 different mini Paraystes, like how Migi can go solo for a few secs, than shit just becomes fucking impossible.
>> ARTICLE
And then thats when we pop CDs in phase 5 where we have 2 minutes to take down 30% of his HP. Thats when we get the lootz.
>> ARTICLE
It will split into 5 yes, making a cross with the main in the middle being untargetable and you must kill all the others before they reach the main or the boss with revive with x*25% HP

Umm I thought she had a baby for the exact reason to be a mother. She probably doesn't see breast feeding as a motherly thing to do either, more just a way to keep her project in working order.

Hes referring to the things like hormones secreted from the ovaries, which can alter brain chemistry. We aren't giveN a clear picture of how the parasyte brain works so we don't know how it's affected by hormones.

"The Adventures of the Dying Detective"

GG no re
>> ARTICLE
It's tough to say based off of that preview. He has Reiko's child. Almost like she is giving it to him.
>> ARTICLE
That title is genius.

They aren't even kidding around anymore.
>> ARTICLE
It's a reference to the Sherlock Holmes short story: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Dying_Detective
>> ARTICLE
I just learned this, but apparently *every* episode is the name of a famous literary work.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. The [episode list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasyte#Episode_list) has links to the articles for the original works.
>> ARTICLE
His vengeance probably wouldn't be killing them, it will be alerting the public to their existence. That's the thing that they fear the most. After that happens governments will start actively and aggressively hunting them down.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, i think hes actually gonna go after reiko's kid
>> ARTICLE
They way he says "I still have time..." Makes me think he's more concerned about "saving" the child. He wants to remove it from her care because, well, she's a parasite. But little does he know, she's begun to develop overt feelings for the child. Maybe not affection, but there's a clear maternal bond involved. Can't wait to see how it plays out.
>> ARTICLE
Tamiya becomes too knowledgeable and smart to underestimate humans so she scolds other parasites for being bunch of fools. And they just get sour and try to murder her. Looks like those guys didn't learn from A's example. I bet she'll wreck those shit for brains with some strategy.
>> ARTICLE
Tamiya is becoming more human, not neccesarily more intelligent. Once she said that they only need to kill humans, that it's their instincts to do so. Now, she is starting to go away from these thoughts and asks more questions about how and why.
>> ARTICLE
Imho she is becoming much more intelligent than rest of her species. It has already been said that they may develop better or worse depending on their maturation environment. Tamiya was supposed to fit into teacher role fast so she propably learned a lot. She's a very curious one too. She even attended a lecture.


Asking difficult and abstract questions is a sign of high intelligence. While she acknowledges that humans are more dangerous as a collective (single individual is powerless but large organizations are already on the move) her colleagues are just a bunch of hungry, morons that treat humans like a walking breakfast. Shimada and A were not careful, made stupid mistakes and died. The only individual that seems as advanced as Tamiya is the politician guy who is thinking further ahead than the next meal. I mean he set up the whole parasite team, election farce and assets like eating spots.

As for the human part. It's apparent that some parasites are obtaining a bit of human features. Maybe they are subconciously developing to fit in better and look more like humans, maybe it's just experience or maybe there's more to it.
>> ARTICLE
She's still very much a parasite, I think. She's able to recognize that human society is essentially one big brain and if the parasites cross with that brain they'll lose. And she knows they'll lose because they lack a cohesive society themselves.
>> ARTICLE
to be fair thats basically what emotions do for humans already, fear means no don't touch, and anger means touch really hard with fist
>> ARTICLE
She is definitely still parasite. Its funny since the parasites are all acting a bit like humans. The parasites do not like Tamia who is ahead of them in intelligence. I feel like the same thing can happen in the human society as well. People who think way further than the rest are often not liked.

the manga looks a bit comical tbh

Yeah. The parasite's stoicism (?) looks intimidating in the anime, but deadpan-comical in the manga.

It is from the 80s.

27 years old, and a lot of things have happend in general manga development under that time. For contrast, Dragonball was first published in 84, while this was in 88.

There were a surprising number of themes and character development in that one scene. I was and am really impressed.

Episode Title: Happy Family  
  
Well, that went to shit real fast.

Damn, what can't this guy do. What were those workers even thinking, "Oh, this guy has blades for arms, let's go see if he's okay" I'd be getting the fuck out of there so fast.  
  
Looks like next episode will start with a brawl.

HAPPY PARASYTE DAY!

Despite my always cheery welcome, today is NOT a Happy Parasyte Day gang. 

NO ONE is Happy currently. The fight scene was on point and I enjoy seeing Reiko call these dudes out on their shit. That being said, I don't want Murano to die, but man oh man is something bad going to happen to Reiko/the Parasyte Mafia. Can't wait for next week!
>> ARTICLE
I feel so bad for Kuramori, he tried to back out to save his family but he was already too late. 

After the battle with the 5 in one and seeing how they could morph their characteristics like that, I wonder if migi will come  up with ways to copy features from animals and other things he has seen for new forms besides just tentacle blades. 

Migi and Shinichi trust each other in battle, but it still looks like they have a few things to work out about their ideals. I wonder what will come out of their dream world meetings, I'm betting they will use it for some connection or revelation later on.

The humans as a single entity was an interesting take. Even with how powerful the couple of parasytes are they would still be overwhelmed by the sheer number of humans that would work against them if they were revealed properly. Looks like the  baby has changed Tamura, I think she will probably be able to fend off the other parasytes and then be confronted by Kuramori. 

I really hope the Dad survives all this...
>> ARTICLE

then I hope [next episode's title](http://i.imgur.com/OnZ6xVY.png) is as misleading as this week's

SO MANY DEATH FLAGS.

for real tho, i had enough of these cliffhangers, fuck you 

() THE WEEK IS GOING TO BE A LONG ONE.

I hope my favourite secondary character survives this 3v1. And I think that the private investigator will indirectly, unwillingly, or perhaps just half assedly save her.

If she is eliminated from the equation is can't see a way in which parasites and humans would be able to coexist.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really see a motive to safe her for him so far. Unless he wants to kill her himself. And that wouldn't be very intelligent considering the 3 other parasytes are way to strong for him to defend his prey.
>> ARTICLE
I doubt she would walk into a 3v1 without knowing she can win.

They are all about survival.
>> ARTICLE
It would be ironic if he dies saving her.

I wonder why they decided to go with a 2 minute episode this week...

Speculation (w/ paraphrasing) :
Migi : "I'm unable to communicate to the parts of me through your body."  

Shinichi will be able to control them, but he hasn't gotten a grasp of how to yet beyond his original muscle control which is now enhanced.

*Workers see guy with muscles as arms and blades coming out of them on the ground*

Murano better get the hell away from his house, was really scared for a bit there
>> ARTICLE
Damn one of the best parasyte episode for me
>> ARTICLE
possible spoilers i guess, (although simply speculation) [but in this picture] (http://puu.sh/f9K81/a19ba4db37.jpg) it almost looks like it's the PI and Tamiya's baby, and he has a blank stare like a parasite. Maybe Tamiya ends up taking his body?
>> ARTICLE
I think he just kidnaps her baby somehow, I highly doubt Tamiya wants to leave her body now because of the kid, since she's becoming more human.
>> ARTICLE
and remember when one parasyte took body of Shinichi's mom? At first it took that man's body, but then it said that it must be woman
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was because it was a relatively "uneducated" parasyte that didn't understand that a female's bodily functions worked different than a male's. I'm sure Ryouko is smart/adaptable enough to work it out if she really has to.
>> ARTICLE
I laughed. So it doesn't matter if it was the right moment. 

Well, looks like he's got trouble. I don't recognize the guy. Did they meet before?

Reiko asking the questions we still wonder about. I hope she'll okay. She seems to be the most human by far.

Well, I thought that we'd get a Murano death flag cause she went to his house. Might be later.

I thought the boss battle was over to quickly when Shinichi got the guy's head. But holy crap that guy is OP. Shinichi needs to invest in some hand grenades.

This episode went by in the blink of an eye. Parasyte is one of my favorite currently airing anime right now. The relationship between Migi and Shinichi is so interesting, and the way conflicts are unfolding really makes me care for almost every character they show.

HOLY FUCKING SHIT WAS THIS EPISODE TENSE! That fucking moment when he morphs his legs. Holy fucking shit.
>> ARTICLE
I freaked out when the parasite morphed his face into the bad ass one.
>> ARTICLE
Such a great episode, how will I wait for more?! It seems Shinichi/Migi have met their match.  
On another note, Murano is becoming less and less relevant. I know she was in the manga, but would making the father Shinichi's shred of humanity instead of her, and letting the other girl act as his possible romantic interest tragically lost, have been a better way to go plotwise? Seems like it so far. Otherwise, I am the bone of my hype.
>> ARTICLE
Tamiya such a best girl.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone remember how far away Migi is capable of going away from Shinichi's body now?  I wonder if he jumped off his arm, if the signal would fully go with him and they could use that to set up an ambush. Assuming of course that they were in a place where they could both hide in different spots that are relatively close together.  I thought maybe that's what Migi's plan was when he had them go into the forest.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more time rather than distance.  Migi away from Shinichi is like a fish out of water.

What if murano has come in contact with parasites before or knows about them? cuz really she asked him if he is really him alot of times.

Good episode. After going in circles for several weeks it looks like something might finally unfold.

The psychological developments of Tamura Reiko are the most interesting aspect of the story right now for me. It's become pretty much an irregular parasyte and thus one of the most interesting. It looks like she started getting attached to the baby as well.

That parasyte (I forget his name. The dude that swaps places with Miki as the control) is freaking cool. He adapts to his environment. That is just impressive. During the battle, the parasyte adapts his feet to move around trees better than monkeys. After that, Shinichi flees and the parasyte chases after him with feet adapted perfectly for that. Migi must be insanely jealous of him.

Somewhat interesting ep. The animation got hit by a train in the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the humans in this anime are beyond dumb. What part of his arms looked normal, I would've taken one look from inside the truck and then drove off.
>> ARTICLE
I think this episode truly started to show how close Migi and Shinichi have become. They may be two separate minds, but their goal of survival has greatly strengthened their psychological bond. They both depend on each other completely in the fight and I think that's what makes Shinichi stand out among the rest.

What's the song around ~2:15? I can't find it in the OST.

I don't think Murano and the baby are gonna see the end of this.

I'm feeling a bit of code geass deja vu with the recent episodes using the formula of ending with dramatic cliffhangers, enjoying this series a lot though.

Parasyte has the cliffhanger down to an art form.

That guy's laughing face was quite the treat...it's funny watching how they try to be more human little by little and having "blunders" in their appearance and mannerisms every now and then lol.

now.. I'm wondering how much does that guy has to eat to support 5 parasites. And after all the running and fighting he/they aren't exhausted at all.
>> ARTICLE
He said he was exhausted... 
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi has some seriously great taste in clothing 
>> ARTICLE
Does PI guy know that parasyte lady has a baby, because if so I think he's going to enter her apartment and kill her baby.  Imagine her reaction after defeating 3 parasytes(which is most likely going to happen) and finding her baby dead.

I feel like Kana might win out.

She's acting like Inaba. Also Inaba is her voice actor, well, you know what I mean.

She has a psychic attraction to parasytes and she's a terrible judge of character. Also she showed up too late in the series. Shit does not bode well for her.

>She's acting like Inaba. Also Inaba is her voice actor, well, you know what I mean.

And Kanbaru! She's been the voice of some great girls! I think I'm starting to route for her now that Murano's been in such a pissy mood for 2 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Murano does know that Shinichi's mother passed away, right? It was very tactless of her to say what she did considering the circumstances. I was actually waiting for an inner monologue from Murano to excuse him for saying what he did along the lines of "that's right...Shinichi's mother passed. I shouldn't be so judgmental..." during the scene.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think she does. She only knows about his father's accident... which now Shinichi calls "illness", so she doesn't even know it was an attack on his parents.

I was actually waiting for him to use the mom card. "Please, I just lost my mother and my dad was hospitalized, everyone changes after this".
>> ARTICLE
>Murano does know that Shinichi's mother passed away, right?

It's almost certain that she doesn't know. Shinichi's dad finally accepted that she was dead during this episode, so it probably wasn't public knowledge and Shinichi definitely wasn't going around telling people that his mom is dead. I'm expecting that Murano is gonna feel *horrible* about how she's been acting towards Shinichi when she finally finds out about his mom. Perhaps they'll be holding a funeral for her soon and that's when Murano will find out.

That was the weirdest way to show how he is growing cold but it was pretty effective. Kind of hit me with a bit of surprise.
>> ARTICLE
The most effective part of that for me was right after when he was burying the dog and thought "If I had just done this in the first place Murano wouldn't hate me right now."

Trashing the dog was a very callous thing to do, but his thought process afterwards was sociopathic. Normal empathic people would care about the other person or feel remorse, instead of thinking the coldly analytical "if I had done X action instead of Y action I would not have gotten Z result." 


>> ARTICLE
My jaw dropped when I heard the flap swing open. 
>> ARTICLE
Did you pick it back up?
>> ARTICLE
And bury it under the tree?
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was perfect.  My heart hurt the second I saw the puppy in the road, watching him dispose of the body like that was an excellent way of showing how emotionless he has become.
>> ARTICLE
Like Murano said, it was kind of contradictory. If he really was that cold, he wouldn't have picked up the dog in the first place when Migi told him its death was inevitable. Picking it up and taking it to the park so it could take it's dying breaths in peace away from the noise was in itself a very compassionate thing to do. But as soon as it was dead, Shinichi changed gears and turned into a completely different person than just a minute ago. And he didn't even realize whatever it was he was doing wrong. It was effective but I think they went a bit overboard in his portrayal of being cold. He didn't need to throw it in the thrash can. Him treating the puppy's dead body roughly would have gotten the message across just as well.
>> ARTICLE
This was exactly as it was in the manga and so far the anime has followed the manga scene for scene. While you may be right, this is just how the original was made in the 90s, of which the director apparently wants to follow exactly.

That might actually be his HUMAN aspect becoming colder, rather than Migi - since you know, he JUST killed his own "mother". Or rather, the lump of meat that *was* his mother.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it was overboard at all. It was absolutely perfect: it shows perfectly how he's still the same person, just infinitely more "pragmatical". He still cared for the living dog as much as he would have before; it's just that his parasyte sense is now telling him what he intellectually knows--that the corpse of the dog is not the dog anymore. Thus he just throws it in the trash, not because he's become cold, but because his sense/instinct of compassion towards a *non-living object which just happened to* **have been** *a living being* has been turned off.
>> ARTICLE
The word is "pragmatic".
>> ARTICLE
I think it was good in showing how Migi has "mixed" with him. He's still going around saving helpless little animals, but doesn't see a need to care about it after it's dead. A mix of human altruism and parasite practicality.
>> ARTICLE
I like it. It seems very utilitarian in nature. "I care about others, and will try to help them if I can, but I don't care about sentimentality." It's kinda what I hoped Migi would turn into, something concerned with others besides himself but not emotional, pure cold logic, even to the point of not being concerned with the self. Now I just want them to start hunting down parasites for the good of humanity.
>> ARTICLE
I also thought it was a great way of showing how Shinichi has forced himself to think differently regarding his mom - even though the parasite that killed her still looks like her, he had to convince himself that he was fighting a lump of meat, not his mother.

I think that even if you try to explain the dog thing with how Migi is influencing him, you also have to admit that part of it is Shinichi's subconsciousness.
>> ARTICLE
It was just weird in that they showed him growing cold not with a human but with a dog. It was very perfect though, his not even thinking about it, treating it like trash and not having and empathy towards it or humanity towards it. 
>> ARTICLE
One of the first episodes he saves a cat from being stoned.

It's a good way to contrast who he is.

He still cares about living things... But now he is so logical he loses that sympathy when they are dead.
>> ARTICLE
> One of the first episodes he saves a cat from being stoned.

I feel so dumb for forgetting this. It makes perfect sense.
>> ARTICLE
 When he was wondering what he did wrong I was expecting a flash back about it 
>> ARTICLE
Watching that scrub get dunked was the most satisfying thing to happen to me this week.

edit: I do not condone throwing puppies in bins.
>> ARTICLE
For me, it wasn't as satisfying. :( Personally I wanted Shinichi to fully go down on beanie's ass and teach him a lesson. All through that scene, I was on the edge of my seat expecting, wishing, *praying* Shinichi to snap. And when Shihichi had the guy's foot in his hand [here](http://i.imgur.com/8AZjw2S.jpg), I was so sure this is it, twist it around until he screams like a little girl. But personal disappointment aside, it was a great portrayal of how Shinchini had become not only strong but also emotionally detached from everything. He's just too empty inside to even hold any grudges.
>> ARTICLE
I think that enough of the Parasyte is in his system now that snapping and going completely ape shit is beyond him now. He's becoming more like Migi, in that he's becoming more cold and detached. It would've been a very human action to flip out and beat on the guy.  

This whole episode is kind of establishing that he's changing a lot. The only real anger we've seen in him is after he's had the thought of exposing all of them someday and he turns to Murano with his >:| face and scares the shit out of her.
>> ARTICLE
I think the emotional damage the guy took from realising that he didn't even exist on Shinichi's radar was more potent than getting beaten up would have been. That emotionless look Shinichi gave him at the end was all that was needed. It was a kind of "You do not exist in my world" look. The guy who thought he had a rival in love suddenly takes a psychological blow. I thought it was a perfect way to defuse the situation.
>> ARTICLE
I think it helped show that Shinichi is still a kind person.

He couldve easily kicked the guys ass, but didnt. He also gave him back his shoe politely.
>> ARTICLE
In the manga he even [deliberately takes a punch to the head](http://www.mangareader.net/1415-45830-19/parasyte/chapter-17.html) in an attempt to defuse the situation.

Okay, that totally nonchalant fight from Shinichi, was actually really badass.  
    
Looks like this new "transfer student" Hideo, is going to be trouble for Shinichi, Shinichi at least holds back when doing his daily activites to lower suspicion, but this guy does what he wants.  
    
Oh Shinichi, you certainly aren't making it easy for Murano. First the puppy in the trash and then looking at her with that [face](http://i.imgur.com/vrbPqeP.png).  
    
That's sad, Shinichi's father has become somewhat of an alcoholic after losing his wife.  
    
Migi was right to suspect Hideo, he does eat people!
>> ARTICLE
That fight was incredibly badass, especially the start. Just a quick step on his toes, a light tap to his chest, and he's on his ass. Much more impressive than any number of unnecessary flips and feats of strength.
>> ARTICLE
> Oh Shinichi, you certainly aren't making it easy for Murano. First the puppy in the trash and then looking at her with that face.

And then Murano sees him with Kana too. Although that may end up having the opposite effect of making Murano more attracted to Shinichi since he's becoming popular with the ladies. 
>> ARTICLE
>Although that may end up having the opposite effect of making Murano more attracted to Shinichi since he's becoming popular with the ladies.

I'm not too sure about that. Murano did say that she liked him because he was dorky and nervous all the time. Becoming a casanova probably isn't the best way to get her back.

Agreed after watching episode 9. It's starting to look like I'm gonna have to jump ship from SS Murano to SS Kana.

This anime is seriously on a really high level in terms of consistent quality. Every episode have been great, there hasn't been a single episode that has been anything worse than really good. 

Today's episode was no exception. The new badass Shinichi is something that I really didn't expect. He has really lost something important as a human, but every second he is on the screen is amazing. Kimishima Kana is not the nicest girl in the world but she is interesting as hell. Our goddess Hanakana is on the other hand incredibly nice and deserves Shinishi the most, even though I don't find her as interesting as the anime Kana (confusing, I know). And I don't see a [bright future for](/s "Glasses girl.")

The soundtrack (if we forget about dubstep) is extremely similar to Final fantasy, I'm replaying Final fantasy 9 ATM and Parasyte does sound very similar at times to the FF9 soundtrack. That is not a bad thing, it's an incredibly great thing because FF9 soundtrack is brilliant.

Also wanna add another thing: This anime is amazing! Holy shit, I didn't expect to watch something this great when I started it.
>> ARTICLE
I love the soundtrack for this show.  

Like, the dubstep autotuned screamo theme song is a bit jarring the first time you hear it, but it's also kinda cool to hear that in a different language. And it is growing on me. 

Also, I dunno if it's just me, but I am not digging the end theme song. That one seems really out of place. Like, really calm, and nice, and it's just kinda...I dunno. A lot of animes do that. They do like a really calm and relaxing end theme song, and it just kinda takes me out of the action.  
>> ARTICLE

For Parasyte logic, if it's not permanent damage it's not damage at all. Remember that they don't feel pain.
>> ARTICLE
You know, I actually would love for Kana to take the female lead role here. She seems so much more interesting than Murano.

Also dammit, now I kinda feel like a shit bag for thinking of trash can as the first and most convenient way to dispose of the dead dog and for thinking that his argument about it was pretty sound. Wait, my dog is looking at me weird... what are you doing boy?... why are you looking at me like that.... stop...no...don
>> ARTICLE
I agree with just throwing the dog in the trash, it really is just a lump of dog meat and bones and skin.  When I die, I don't care what happens to my body, I'll be dead. 

Plus throwing the dog in the trash is much more efficient than digging it a grave.  Most likely another dog will come along and dig up that shallow grave, all in all it causes a lot more problems
>> ARTICLE
I agree with your first point. She seems like she could have some serious development as a charecter whereas murano seems to be miss boring and cliche.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but she has basically become the representation to a normal life for him. 

That and while Kana may be a more interesting choice, Murano to me is the other half of Shinichi's fragmented mind. She's what reminds him of what he was at every moment. She's pretty much there to be his human half, I don't think that's something that Kana would be able to accomplish since she hasn't been with him as long. 
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. While Murano does not exactly offer a whole lot to the story right now, she is basically Shinichi's human conscience.
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi is the badass, stoic MC I've always wanted. He loses his emotions in exchange for strength and power. As a result, his relationships have begun to deteriorate, and since he has lost those emotions, he can't figure out what he's doing wrong subconsciously.
>> ARTICLE
I love that he didn't become a bad-ass without a huge price.
>> ARTICLE
Yea Shinichi. You indeed lost something important to humans: a piece of your humanity.
>> ARTICLE
And your mom. How can you forget the most important person in your life dammit!
>> ARTICLE
So when Hideo punched that other guy in the stairwell, they just completely ignore it? I get that Shinichi has become emotionally detached, but what about the guy who got punched? Aren't people going to notice and you know, ask questions? "Hey, how come your face is bleeding?" "Oh, you know, I just got punched. #justhighschoolthings \\_()_/"

Also Shinich you realized you fucked up but why didn't you follow through and apologize to Murano! You already fucked up earlier today and scared the shit out of her, and now that Kana girl is trying to make her jealous and give her the wrong impression about you. Instead you just realize your mistake and continue on to walk Kana home. Like, at least go after Murano and apologize then walk Kana home/explain to her that sensing parasytes are dangerous.

Is Shinichi so far detached that he can't even make up an excuse to his dad? Even just one of those cliche "One of us has to be strong now that mom's gone" would've worked. 
>> ARTICLE
In the stairwell, the few times you do see that guy he's bloody so I can't say it's too uncommon of an occurrence. 


>> ARTICLE
>\\()/

WOAH DUDE, YOUR ARM.. IT'S.. it's attached?

**Edit**: Back to topic, I actually really like to see how Shinichi's character develops throughout the story, since the moment Migi told him about the cells in his body etc.
Really interesting stuff that he is becoming emotionless even though he seems to be somewhat aware that something is missing/not right with him.
>> ARTICLE
I want my adorkable Shinichi back... T_T

HAPPY PARASYTE DAY BOYS AND GIRLS!!

Shinichi. How are you just gonna throw a puppy away like that?! Lmao

Overall great episode. I really feel for Shinichi, not being able to control your change is shitty. I don't know why he doesn't just tell Murano that his mother is dead and his dad is an alcoholic...it stings.

I don't know if anyone feels the same here but for me personally I've been waiting for an episode of Parasyte moreso than any other anime airing this season. The characterization is top notch making the characters feel very genuine and human, the action is brisk and wonderfully animated (though at times it does dip) and the dynamic between Shinichi and Migi is just absolutely perfect. The only gripe I have is the dubstep music but the other tracks in the ost (such as the one that plays at the end of episode 3 and in the episode previews) are fantastic. 

And this is yet another great episode. Thank you based Madhouse.

Things are not going well for him at all. I'm thinking he's slowly losing his humanity.

Solid episode, I guess shinichi is in a faustian phase right now. Also now that "transfer student" is off killing again, a showdown is pretty much guaranteed.

Am I the only one who thinks Shinichi throwing the dog in the trash can is not that big of a deal? Most people wouldn't even bother picking it up when it was on the street.

It's not like he has no empathy like Migi, he has just become "logically emotional". What happens to dog while he's still alive matters even if he's about to die, but as soon as the dog dies whatever happens to him no longer matters from a rational point of view.

I always liked MCs that don't let emotions cloud their judgment, like Kiritusugu or Lelouch. So I hope the anime don't paint it as such a terrible thing for the rest of the series as it did this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised no one at Shinichi's school asked about his appearance change without glasses. Anyway, it's a shame he didn't give that brainless thug Mitsuo a beating.
>> ARTICLE
I'm hoping that he will embrace the bad-ass that he has but retain some of his old personality back, it's made him stronger of course but the nervous, human, welcoming personality he had has just about dissipated leaving him emotionless and cold-looking :(.  The punch by the new enemy was pretty funny I thought lol

Wow, the progression of Shinichi as a character is really well done.
>> ARTICLE
How does Hideo run so fast anyway?  His body is entirely normal except for his head isn't it?  He hasn't distributed his cells throughout the host body like Migi has or else he would require hibernating.   

Are they really going to explain it through superior body control?  I don't buy it.
>> ARTICLE
He walked 5 feet right to where he couldn't bee seen by glasses girl. Let's use deductive reasoning! Yay!

Context for anime only fan:

Hideo is picky on his pray. A city girl full of cosmetics and make up approached him but that was not his liking. 

He ended up eyeing the countryside girl contains good mix of fat. She was also chemical free and potentially grew from a pollution free area.

Oh! Man, I even saw that and it just didn't click for some reason, haha.  

Seriously, nice job spotting that. Congratulations!

nice catch!
>> ARTICLE
Damn, Tamura is a straight up badass and a troll. Running around with half a head and scaring the shit out of those people was great.
  
Murano STAHP, you raise death flags wherever you go.  
  
It's an interesting contrast, Shinichi seems to be coming more and more parasyte, while Tamura is becoming more human. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Murano will die. I think Tamura will get killed by Shinichi, Murano will see him killing her(and probably start hating him) and become the new mother to the baby. It would fit her character I think.

>> ARTICLE
I think Tamura will probably get killed by the grieving journal she hired to spy on Shinichi. 
>> ARTICLE
She just killed him...or do you mean the police detective that saw the private investigator dying? I doubt this would be the case. Tamura killed 3 parasytes. You would need an army of humans to kill her.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched episode yet was trying to guess fail haha
>> ARTICLE
Well, I hope that teaches you a lesson of not coming to these posts until after having seen the episode :p I just pretty much spoiled you all of the major events of it.
>> ARTICLE
Well not really I know what happens in manga :p (and no my guess has nothing to do with what will happen in manga)
>> ARTICLE
Well first stage is usually denial
>> ARTICLE
Her and Shinichi's dad are the only thing really keeping him tethered to reality. It's kind of like in Breaking Bad where Walter's family was his main motivator, and if he had lost them, he would've had no internal struggle to try to keep him in both worlds, the drug world and his family life.  

Shinichi is fighting hard to try to remain a human and a good son/friend throughout this whole show. If he lost his dad and Murano, he'd have nothing holding him back from just going completely off the deep end.
>> ARTICLE
>and become the new mother to the baby

What? There's no reason for that.
>> ARTICLE
If Tamura dies, the baby wouldn't have a mother. And as shown with the dog, I doubt Murano would simply let it be there if she sees it.
>> ARTICLE
> If Tamura dies, the baby wouldn't have a mother.

There are still the government and adoption agencies. She wouldn't have to become a mother.
>> ARTICLE
Considering that the baby comes from a parasyte...I'm not confident the government is someone to be trusted in that case.
>> ARTICLE
But neither is Murano. ~~She would just keep asking the baby if he was a baby or not~~  
In all honesty, if there would be a choice between Murano and the government, the latter would be better off taking the baby. But this is really far-fetched, there really is no reason for her to suddenly take care of it.
>> ARTICLE
The thing that brought me to think like that was Tamura's speech about a mother and then Murano appearing directly afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, saw this in the episode where Tamura was looking in the mirror laughing. It was like a total contrast with the development of Shinichi.
>> ARTICLE
>Murano STAHP, you raise death flags wherever you go.  
  
She doesn't just raise them, she runs it up the flag pole, and has a twelve gun salute.

I love the episodes tittle reference to Sherlock Holmes

Yea, I learned that all of the episode titles have been titles of other literature. Thought it was really cool and seem to meet the theme of the episodes.

That ep was like 2 min
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Most of the time, I laugh when people say an episode feels like 5 minutes, but lately Parasyte is the one show on my list where I am like..."where'd my 20 minutes go?".


I just get so into it. The same thing sort of happened with Aldnoah Zero during season 1.

>> ARTICLE
She wasn't insane, she split in half and only had half of brain processing power. Her parts were like a parasyte that had began feeding.
>> ARTICLE
I had a question about that too, did she somehow find out about his mom? I just got the vibe when she was explaining it that she had gotten the idea from what Migi did to save Shinichi and account for his new power or just had figured out her own method being so crafty.
>> ARTICLE
She was in his house this episode. And she found out the previous episode.
>> ARTICLE
That fight was so awesome and freaky. Glad the parasytes are finally doing stuff other than transform their heads into 1 stalk.
>> ARTICLE
The majority of parasites consider their primary threat to be humans in low numbers, so they develop their fighting with that in mind. It's the parasites that think about how to fight large numbers of humans or how to fight other parasites that really get into the cool stuff.

Does anyone know why airhead version Tamura seemed to look...prettier? 
>> ARTICLE
That's yet another slight anime-manga difference that made things a bit unclear. In the manga, some men cornered her after they thought they had seen a monster, but then apologized for being mistaken after Tamura pulled her pretty/innocent/vulnerable young woman act. It's clear that she's a lot better than Miki when it comes to mimicking human behavior.
>> ARTICLE
It also made her comment about putting rocks in her purse to defend herself from perverts a little more pointed.

Also, before that she runs through a shopping area, so a lot of people see and start screaming.

Didn't she mimic the idol from the poster as she ran by?

i believe all the background characters are so stupid that its just natural selection.

How about some paint thinner?
>> ARTICLE
Starting to get some real character development from Murano. Definitely looking forward to where this goes.
>> ARTICLE
its snowing.. you know that means shes basicaly dead right?
>> ARTICLE
What about Mostermama? that was some character development she got like a whole new emotion. 
>> ARTICLE
What? What are you talking about? Do you equate screen time with character development? Nothing has changed about her character whatsoever. She still knows something is wrong with Shinichi, as she has for the entire length of the show.  She's now trying slightly harder to find out what is wrong with him since she has finally been given a lead, in the form of Tamura appearing.  This isn't something that's changing with her character though. Her "character" is solely focused on Shinichi.  We still know next to nothing about Murano as a person.

I was hopeful when she arrived at the park at the same time as everyone else. I was really hopeful that she'd actually find out something, or see something go down, ANYTHING. But no. She found out nothing. She sat on a bench, and appropriately asked herself: [WHAT AM I DOING?](http://i.imgur.com/ii45QIs.png)
>> ARTICLE
She will probably see Tamura vs Shinichi. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, and it would be interesting to see how she reacts to that. But to say her character was somehow developed in this episode...I don't see it.

Tamura, on the other hand, has had very interesting character development for the past several episodes, including this one.
>> ARTICLE
Not saying her character was developed. You could say it was done a tiny bit, as she went from passive thinker to active searcher, but that's it. Her actions changed, but not her personality or way of thinking.
>> ARTICLE
Keyword there is "starting." She knows Shinichi is involved in something very dangerous, but she's starting to pursue rather than run away as she has in prior episodes. She's becoming more embroiled in the plot, which is exciting, because till now, she's been a very ancillary character -- as you correctly stated.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, I agree that her character is finally being set in motion. It's been a long time coming.  Although, I don't think this actually constitutes character development in any way.  It's hinting at possible future character development.

I'm not sure I'm excited about it either. I still think that Kana was the vastly more interesting "best girl" character even if she was a psycho stalker.  Murano's basically just a replacement "mother" figure in Shinichi's life, constantly worrying over him. There's just nothing cool or interesting about Murano herself. Hopefully that will change.
>> ARTICLE
She definitely had character development from when Shinichi threw that dog in the trash and when Kana died. Although her selflessness can be misconstrued with naivety. However, she is built as a normal teenager whose just scared and out of her depth.
>> ARTICLE
ARE YOU REALLY SHINJI KUN ?!?!?
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah he totally hasn't [changed] (http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/kiseijuu/images/4/4a/Shinichi_Izumi_Anime_Before_After.png/revision/latest?cb=20141018080544) during the course of the show....

It's a legitimate question considering he has a parasyte living inside him now.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, sure, it's a legitimate question. But she repeated it like a trillion times over the course of the 2-3 episodes following Shinichi's transformation. It made me hate her guts, and I still do. She hasn't really done anything other than getting in trouble and worrying. I also hate how her actions don't have very good explanations...why did she follow Reiko? Why did she suddenly decide to go to the park!?

Well, whatever. Hopefully that changes soon.
>> ARTICLE
She is literally the ONLY thing wrong with this show. The ONLY thing. Outside of worrying about Shinichi, what good is she? You could have done that with Kana, and even more so with the father. Frankly, I would have rather had the father play this role than Murano.
>> ARTICLE
>She hasn't really done anything other than getting in trouble and worrying

You mean like a normal teenage girl?

Also it makes sense for her to ask those questions considering how much he changed, i binged watch this from episode 1 to 12 and he has changed drastically. He threw a dog in the trash and saved her by jumping out of the school building. He isn't the person she used to know.
>> ARTICLE
sure it is, it does get tiresome after hearing it a thousand times though
>> ARTICLE
^^*Shinichi
>> ARTICLE
looks like she's heading to the same park where the Shinichi vs Tamura battle is about to start... so either she finally finds out about Shinichi's secret or she dies ^^^or ^^^both
>> ARTICLE
she dies.. its snowing.
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, I don't know if Tamura and Shinichi would actually fight, though. She has no real reason to fight him, if anything I think she'd want him to become her ally since now that group of Parasytes will be targetting her. 
>> ARTICLE
And she said to Murano that Shinichi would be fine.
>> ARTICLE
Too much character development in one episode is one hell of a death flag. Really hope that if she does get involved, Tamura spares her (out of parasyte love). 
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming that she's going to see Tamura and Shinichi with the baby, and think he's slept with her and fathered a child, and that's why he's been so off lately.  

Tamura coming out of his house, him acting aloof lately? All signs certainly point to it.  
>> ARTICLE
This was actually the dots that connected in my head when Tamura took the baby back and it showed Shinichi and Murano at the park. This'll be interesting if that's the route it takes.
>> ARTICLE
I would enjoy watching this happen
>> ARTICLE
I would cry about the show... really by now I think this show would have been significantly better without Murano and Kana. Maybe the time writing them could be used to create some good characters who also have to do with the parasytes.

I don't get why the author decided to focus on his weaknesses, the female characters, instead of his strengths, the parasytes.

And before everyone goes downvoting me, at least write why so we can have a discussion.
>> ARTICLE
If he didn't focus on those you wouldn't get a feel for how normal humans perceived what's going on with him and their opinions on the parasite world. Also without some of the interaction scenes it'd be more difficult to judge how he is changing. Also without them he wouldn't look introspectively at himself and judge his changing character with the likeness of a parasite. 

Tl:dr By having these characters it drives characterization for shinichi and makes it more apparent to the viewer. Also gives an outside look from a normal persons perspective on the events occurring.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it?  

And it might actually force his hand (Ha! Double entendre!) and make him either go "What? No!" and show her crazy spooky eyeball hand, or use it as a cover story for why he's been acting so damn crazy lately.  

But that also might be a bit too soap opera-y for a show like this, and this show likes to just cut right to the chase, it seems.  
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, in a way it would be perfect for it to go that way but at the same time I hope it doesn't. If it does though I cant wait to see how they take that concept and do it in way that fits the show

Guys, I'll be honest.... I folded under the pressure and read to the end with the manga. I just couldn't take the waiting... ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Hey man, don't feel bad. I read the entire manga in one night after seeing [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVo21dmbCY8) and this was a few months before the anime started airing.
>> ARTICLE
First time I'm willing to wait. There will e like 7 more episodes and the anime and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NumVrbn5CRg) is just to good. 
>> ARTICLE
Good job the manga has been around for a while I'm surprised not everyone else hasn't already read it.
>> ARTICLE
They ended the episode at my favorite part! Needless to say I am pretty sad ;_;
>> ARTICLE
In the internal struggle of laziness vs need to know how the story ends, my laziness wins out.  

Now, if it gets to the end of the season and there's no sign of a new season, and the story isn't over yet? Yeah, screw this, I'm reading ahead. I did that on Attack on Titan, and I'm not going to sit around and wait for another season to come out.  

But, if it's going to give me a little bit more every week or so? Yeah, I'll wait. Because Lazy.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still holding out on Attack on Titan. I figure I'd rather wait a little while and enjoy it twice than read ahead and criticize the anime for not being exactly the same as the manga when it comes out.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is really good, but they're dragging it out quite a bit, too.  

I think it's on chapter 64 now, and the last anime was like...chapter 30, maybe upper 20s?  

There's a LOT to cover in the show. I'm excited to see how they pull it off.  

My main issue with reading manga is that it's hard to visualize a fight scene sometimes. I'd rather see it all played out in real time, ya know? Also, I'm a big dumbie that gets confused reading shit backwards, haha.
>> ARTICLE
The first season adapted ~~66~~ 33 chapters. Chapter 66 will be released in a few days and that means we will have 2 finished arcs that can be adapted for another 25 episodes. Sadly it won't happen until 2016.

You made an tiny spelling error, it's 33 as I can tell you already know. (:
>> ARTICLE
Don't be ashamed. I broke after episode 12. You're a stronger man than I.
>> ARTICLE
I shall never break.


But seriously, I HAVE to wait until the anime is done airing before I can read the manga. I'd enjoy the show less otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, I broke after episode 1. What does that make me
>> ARTICLE
A parasyte?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe if those episodes were movie length it would feel like I'm watching a 24 minute episode, but not like this. :(  
Pretty cool episode though, Tamura Reiko going full rampage against others of her kind and also developing "feelings" for her child. She said she is jealous of Murano for worrying about Shinichi, so I guess she would like to have such feelings. With all that, I'm pretty hyped for the next episode and what's going to happen between her and Shinichi. 
>> ARTICLE
Hell, even jealousy is a new thing for parasytes, isn't it?  

She's *definitely* becoming more human.  
>> ARTICLE
This episode felt like a 2 minute trailer for the next episode, which will be another trailer :(
>> ARTICLE
Yep, and until now every episode felt like 2 minutes. Haven't had an anime in a long time where there was absolutely no boring episode. Every episode was fucking awesome so far.
>> ARTICLE
So a couple tracks down what they expect, is a woman with no head and try to engage conversation with her. LOL wut....

Tamura's joke would probably go into the hall of fame for most disturbing jokes in anime(if there would be such a thing).

She's like Mako in KLK.

At this point it's no longer a flag anymore. It's a god damned red carpet leading right into your coffin.
>> ARTICLE
Still not as bad as Kaori.
>> ARTICLE
Tamura's fighting style is interesting, looks like the Parasytes learned how to use their tentacles for movement too. Her [half head laughing form](http://i.imgur.com/vJ5v76o.png) was creepy as fuck. [This was pretty funny though](http://i.imgur.com/FM5chbg.jpg). Looks like splitting made her a tad crazy and gave her a high pitched laugh. Parasytes don't seem to have good teamwork.

I'm guessing Tamura will try to give Shinchi the baby before she's caught. Murano is probably going to get caught up somehow this time.
>> ARTICLE
Its all about misdirection.

The problem with logical beings like parasytes is that they are predictable, especially against a intelligent one like Reiko.

She can basically predict what they do and bake those predictions and use the splits to execute.
>> ARTICLE
They mentioned in an earlier episode that splitting from the main body the two can survive on their own, but they basically lose half of their thinking power.  

But they were still able to coordinate and go in for that kill in the end, so I think maybe she was putting on an act, too, to confuse the other parasytes. She's damn good at what she does.

I think a spin-off reality show of Tamura doing pranks on people would really work, she's one kooky chick lol.  Her having fun was the best part of the episode for me.

Really enjoyed Tamura in this episode! She was actually pretty adorable when collecting those rocks and I actually laughed when she split her head open.

I love seeing more Murano but everytime now I'm scared for her life!
>> ARTICLE
Great episode, as usual. Tamura's fight was very intelligent, she knew she hadn't the physical strength to win so she used that strategy to win. Brains over brawn. I thought her killing the P.I was predictable, but her becoming more like a human was already foreshadowed a lot. And I didn't resist and read some more chapters in the manga (just until 48) and I can assure that the next episode will be freaking good.

I'm afraid that Murano will think that Shinichi is the father... BUT, the scene in the [opening](/s "where they're both naked hugging each other") makes me think that everything is gonna be okay.

Happy Parasyte Day! 

MURANO! I'm so glad she's getting more development but I can see the death flag from fucking space.

Murano in the park with Shinichi and Tamura. Seems like she'll finally find out what's wrong with him.

Holy shit, Tamura Reiko is a freaking BADASS MOFO.  LIKE FOR REAL

Tamura Reiko best girl
>> ARTICLE
Shit this episode was intense. Tamura is becoming a very interesting character, not just with that terrifying half-head thing, but it looks like she's the first parasite to show emotion. Also pls don't die Murano. You're the last person Shinichi can still show affection for.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte is one of two anime I can watch every week with confidence that I'll be impressed. *The other is Durarara!! x2.*

I miss looking forward to HunterXHunter every week, and soon even this will end, then where will we find truly thematically cohesive, plot progressive storytelling? The top contender for this month was Death Parade and even that's turning out lackluster.

The spring candidates, mainly Digimon and Souma, better be kickass.
>> ARTICLE
Sweet, my [prediction](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2tzkye/spoilers_kiseijuu_sei_no_kakuritsu_episode_16/co5556l) last time was "mildly" on point. I also really loved the focus on Tamura this episode. She's really grown on me, who would've guessed her mix of parasyte and human emotions would be so fun to watch. Easily one of my favorite characters of the series. 

Looks like Murano is also back into focus which is nice. Maybe she'll *finally* figure out what's up with Shinichi. I'm just always worried about her though, she's like a walking death flag, although at this point, I'm starting to think she's so vulnerable that she *won't* die, in a reverse psychology kind of way. 

The most important question I'm asking right now is how the series is going to conclude. It honestly does not feel like it's been heading towards a conclusive ending, although it still has a ways to go. Just the fact that the last few battles have felt a little repetitive, with an almost "new parasyte a week" feeling, made me lose focus on the end goals here, and I think the change in Intensity is probably going to start ramping up from here on out and the various moral and physical deliminas are coming closer and closer together. Murano is probably a good catalyst in that sense, and if Shinichi's true nature is revealed to her next episode, then we'll definitely be moving towards bigger things. 

The animation this episode was a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand you had the fight scene, which was very well drawn, and very fluid, but you also have some instances where it felt like they were really riding on panning, and some pretty awkward background character, and even foreground character movements. Overall it was still probably a step up though, and hopefully they won't be pulling any stops on the homestretch.

Also, just as an offhand note, this episode felt disgustingly short. Once the ending rolled around I thought, weird, it feels like a cliffhanger, even though we're only ten minute- wait what?! I can nit pick about stuff sure, but the fact that Parasyte can make 23 minutes pass by so quickly deserves its own recognition.
>> ARTICLE
I like how they are not adding random bullcrap into the anime and extending it to 2 seasons. Looks like they will finish the whole story in just one season.

Another week, another excellent episode. So much character development! Also, Reiko, you will haunt my dreams tonight.

Murano best girl senses were tingling, that's why she saw him on that bus.

Keeping it brief this time:

So, parasites turning against one another, humanity teaming up, a PI who lost his family and wants vengeance, Shinichi on the run. Let's see.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

1. Curiosity, that's what separates her from the rest, she does things for reasons other than efficiency. Except curiosity can be efficient as well.

1. See, Ryoko assumes they're not all logical any longer, just like "A", we have "intuition", but people can all be logical and rational and still disagree. The assumption that if we're logical, anyone who disagrees with us is irrational or illogical is poisonous.

1. "I am truly moved by your decision to lynch me." Great line.

1. LOL, I fully expected her to try and fight all three, but since it's just them, she just needs to leave them.

1. And now she's cackling, as her command center left. She split in half, so only half the brain was left behind?

 Ah, right, she doesn't know how to laugh without it being creepy.

1. See, the logical decision is to do anything to survive, so Hikawa is protecting herself, her body, which lets Tamura survive until she can kill them all. None of them would sacrifice themselves for the group, and so all of them can be killed.

1. I bet Tamiya Ryoko will want to give Shinichi her son, to protect.

1. Man, I thought it'd go much worse for Murano. Then again, Ryoko wants to enlist Shinichi's aid.

1. I bet Murano will think Shinichi is the father :P

1. Becoming a posthumous hero, yay

**Post Episode Thoughts:**

A good episode! The disbelief in rational disagreement implicit in Ryoko's words was troubling, but she's alien, and many humans falter there anyway. So, next week, Shinichi becomes a foster parent, eh?
>> ARTICLE
> "I am truly moved by your decision to lynch me." Great line.

Someone should post a screenshot of that to /r/animenocontext.

Well Kana died awhile ago. Murao still lame, Tamura Reiko killing other Parasites and showing emotion?

Okay so i just watched this episode, but what is up with the quote "Where have we come from? Where are we going?" I've seen that quote in a couple and it seems pretty popular, is there anything behind it other then it just being philosophical?
>> ARTICLE
Some consider asking these questions a sign of higher intelligence. Where animals are concerned with eating and surviving, human beings have afforded the opportunity to think about the future, past, and questions like "why are we here?"

Basically she's putting down the other parasytes for only caring about their next meal.
>> ARTICLE
I think OP was curious about why it's showing up in a couple of different shows all at once.

From Log Horizon's most recent episode, for example:

any chance the next episode will differ from the manga?
really i wish i could unsee the manga :(
Tamura Reiko, always the best gal-parasyte-mother
>> ARTICLE
What exactly did Tamura do to win her fight? What I'm getting is that she split herself into 2 parts, tricked and fooled the 3 other parasytes into destroying each other, and then recombined her pieces to finish the job and escape. Also, are there any major differences in appearance between humans and parasytes who possess human bodies? 
 
>> ARTICLE
For some reason, I get the feeling that Tamara may not make it out of next episode.  The title is also raising death flags.
>> ARTICLE
RIP detective man. He kinda brought that upon himself (what was his plan there?). I was kinda rooting for Tamura Reiko this episode, but then I guess the three parasites attacking her weren't exactly likable.

I get worried for Murano constantly, and coming face to face with Reiko didn't exactly help. It seems like her, Shinichi, and Reiko (and the cops) are all basically in the same place... I get the feeling shit is going down next week.
>> ARTICLE
Why is everyone thinking Murano is going to die? Not that I mind, but it seems my deathflag senses are not at all on par with the rest of people here. 

I would rather think that she is about to find about Shinchi having a Parasyte. And that Shinchi will have to raise Reiko's child with Murano if she agrees.

So is this show just going to be a 26 episode arc? Cuz I can't think of how they can wrap this up in 9 more episodes.  

...Although, everything they've done so far, it's happened *way* faster than I thought it would.  

Shinichi's character development, the death of his mother, the rise of power of the emerging parasyte group. I could see this easily wrapping up in the next 7 episodes give or take...  

But man, I want *more*. Like, this has been an excellent story so far, I'd be sad to see that it's almost over.  

Like, how many chapters of the manga are they doing per episode? Is it on pace to be finished that soon?
>> ARTICLE
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there's going to be 24 episodes, not 26?

Usually it's around 3 chapters episode. This episode left off around the middle of chapter 47 of the 64-chapter manga, so it fits nicely.
>> ARTICLE
I'm used to seeing 12 or 13 episode series, or 26 episode. I forgot that some go 24, too.
>> ARTICLE
This show is seriously picking back up. I felt that the writing quality dipped a bit around the middle of the series, but now it's a lot less forced and a lot more enjoyable.

>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else think Parasyte is overrated? Now don't get me wrong, the show is still enjoyable to watch but it seems like everyone is praising this anime as if it were a masterpiece. It currently has an 8.7 out of 10 in MAL, which is too high of a score in my honest opinion.

At least this week's episode was better than the previous ones since we first witness Reiko's characterization as a human mother. But like the previous episodes, this one suffers from dedicating screen time to Murano for the purpose of showing her same tiresome concerns with monologues over and over again. 
>> ARTICLE
AoT has an 8.74 and I'm enjoying parasyte more than I enjoyed AoT, so in comparison to other anime, I do not think it's over hyped. 
>> ARTICLE
>overrated?

What does it matter?

>enjoyable

That's the most important thing.

>as if it were a masterpiece

Which it is. One of the best this (and past) season.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that Murano's complete lack of characterization is dragging the show down, but the action scenes, the general premise, and Shinichi's relationship with Migi are more than enough to rate the show highly. Time will tell whether it's worthy of being an 8.7 (I don't think it is currently, I have it rated a 7), but it still has potential.
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing about Parasyte. It has a very interesting premise and I like the symbiotic relationship and growth between Shinichi and Migi. But as I watch one episode after another, the anime gradually loses its charm and potential. Take the first few episodes for instance: when I witnessed the parasites' morphing and devouring humans, the grotesque detail and animation of those processes brought out a feeling of disgust, which is great because the body-horror elements of Parasyte seemed phenomenal when I started watching this anime. Now the transformations look more bland and less interesting (this is quite evident in this week's episode when Reiko splits her head in half).

Still, the anime is still running so the upcoming episodes may (or may not) be better than the ones I've been watching lately. Like you said, the action and the main cast of characters are fun enough for me to watch until the end of the series.
>> ARTICLE
I'm betting that the next seven episodes will change your mind. There's a reason why this series got an anime adaption despite being finished in 1995.
>> ARTICLE
I can't agree with you that it is overrated, for I think that it is currently the best show that is airing right now by leaps and bounds. I'm one of those people that doesn't score a show until the end, but I still think that a high score like that (maybe not that high) is definitely warranted.

Unfortunately, you're saying negative things about the show, so of course you'll be downvoted D:
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I'm somewhere between 8 and 9/10 atm. The show started out great, but recently had some weaker episodes. If it keeps up like this episode, then I think giving it a 9/10 wouldn't neccesarily be inappropriate. It has good action, story, characters and story and also adresses some intereting themes.

Not very exciting scenes this episode. :( Next week should be better though!
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that, in the manga, they mostly used people's first names to refer to them. They called the killer Kabuto and the new inspector (the one that's in charge of the ground forces), Obito. Speaking of him, can you make a comparison image of Obito in the manga and in the anime? He looks very different.
>> ARTICLE
You should do a comparison of Kabuto's backstory - the manga is a lot more graphic. :)

EYEBROWS
>> ARTICLE
holy fuck one character that actually thinks its a bad idea to get close to parasytes what is he? some sort of commom sense guy?
>> ARTICLE
Obviously the best course of action would be to confront them alone in a dark room and ask them politely if they are indeed human. If you really want to be safe, bring some paint thinner.
>> ARTICLE
Who, the murdering rapist that ended up following them anyway?
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, he waited until the parasyte left and then checked out the scene.  All in all he seems like a pretty sensible guy(other than the murdering rapist part...)
>> ARTICLE
Yep, then ended up arrested. 
>> ARTICLE
Flashbacks to Migi saying the most efficient place to fight another parasyte is in a crowd of meat shields - because they need to cut through them all to get to their target.

I feel like this is going to get ugly.
>> ARTICLE
That actually seem possible. But that will be so fucked up. They will be as bad as the parasites. 
>> ARTICLE
I think, since likely very few of the police force have faced down even one parasyte, let alone the most dangerous elite, there is going to be a lot of panicking and shooting civilians. 

Meanwhile, the parasytes don't care about anything other than self preservation. I don't know if keeping their mostly blown cover will be worth it at this point - so they will probably kill a lot of people to escape/survive.
>> ARTICLE
Flamethrowers and paint thinner are strong against the Parasites. It's only logical to equip everyone with flamethrowers that use paint thinner.
>> ARTICLE
As is tradition, fire is the number one solution when dealing with alien species in science fiction media.

I remember thinking it back when that girl was grabbing the paint thinner out of her art supplies...pretty easy to make a molotov cocktail out of a flammable liquid, a glass bottle and a rag. Even though the parasyte breaking the bottle when it's thrown at them is guaranteed, the liquid should spray all over them as it bursts into flames. However, I'm just assuming this is how it would work in practice. Historically, guerilla style revolutionary groups (and straight-up terrorist groups) are quite fond of using them to firebomb buildings. This would lead me to believe they're fairly reliable as far as makeshift weapons go. I imagine it should work on a person (or a parasyte, in this case). However, this would rely on the parasyte being silly enough to smash the bottle themselves mid-flight. Would probably work with the element of surprise, since sentient things which notice something flying at them at speed immediately react in an "OH SHIT DANGER" fashion.

Edit: [Here's a pretty straightforward video showing what the results would be.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfvceHUBWnU&feature=player_detailpage#t=122)

Also, I suppose discussing this is all rather pointless since it's most likely that we'll never see a molotov cocktail being used in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Flamethrowers that use paint thinner would also be strong against humans.

To be fair, a sharpened stick is strong against humans too. We're pretty squishy.

Well Parasites are pretty squishy too...most of the time at least. So why not use sharpened sticks against then too?

Yeah, maybe like the leg of a chair or a desk. I feel like that could work.

Reminds me of that Futurama episode where they go to the Robot planet that hates all humans and catch a movie.

Two seasons or just random ending?

It has an ending and it's not random at all. They are following the manga and a second season is out of the question.

From what manga readers have said (I haven't read it myself), it seems just one season will be enough to cover the entire manga. So conclusive end, probably.

Random advice: wait till they invent memory wiping pills (they research such thing right now, more or less, I'm not shitting you). Take few of them, watch parasyte again without cliffhangers and don't succumb to the manga.

Oh god. So what are you saying i can watch some anime then take the pill and then watch it again for the first time? I see new addiction comming.

It would be interesting to see how the current mood will change the way one looks at a show after a memory wipe.

So did no one notice that Shinichi was talking to "himself"?

It doesn't seem like they ever do. Also, you'd think they would put cameras up in his hotel room if they were suspicious of him; I really thought that he was gonna get caught when Migi came out in the hotel room.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but it's not like Hirama is on par with L. 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, I don't think anyone in the world is.

just to be safe, he should use a potato chip bag to hide Migi

Or Migi could just turn into a potato chip bag. They'd assume there was a mic in it or something.

He'll take a parasyte...and eat it!

Okay guys let's not cause widespread panic...

Well they did have a lame backstory to not cause panic :

"OMG there's an armed man on the roof of the building, quick, better deploy the army"

I never noticed it before this episode. That little girl will haunt my dreams.

They've been using it for backgrounds and large groups of people. So this is one of the more noticeable times. They also used it for a few seconds for all the SWAT members. But it looked much more natural because they didn't have any facial features.
>> ARTICLE
First time it's been so prominent. I never noticed it in other episodes, either, but this one just stuck out like crazy.
>> ARTICLE
Probably because they kept focusing on them all like "Hey! Look at all these civilians that are about to die horribly in the next episode! There's even some kids ooh nooo"

Meanwhile everyone watching is like "dear god exterminate them all"
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I'm all about them using cheap CGI for the crowd shots if it means they can give more detail to the beautiful fight scenes in this show.  

But, man, those guys...they look wonky.  

Maybe that's the point, though? To make everyone seem alien to us, the viewers, because so much of the show is about what is human?
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte 100% guaranteed. I don't care if the scans say human it's clearly a demon.

When they saw the first parasyte on the scanner I definitely thought it was the girl (same hairstyle) and was like OH that's why she's creepy as fuck

But nope

Any shots of people walking on the sidewalk, and any shots of tamura in the classroom had a bunch, a few of the school evacuations also had them.

I barely noticed it too. I think it's the kind of thing that you start noticing when you know what to look for. Like now you know the crowds are CGI you'll probably start noticing it more in future episodes.

Usually I notice things like this pretty quickly. Maybe my mind just blanked it out because I loved the show so much. But this time it was pretty much in your face.

It's been used a bunch of times. I noticed it in the first episode, the people walking in the background are all CG and move awkwardly

their knees are always slightly bent, who walks like that!

Yup PI gave away the mayor is up there with shady plan.
>> ARTICLE
Well they knew Tamura was a parasyte, so they likely did some off screen investigating.
>> ARTICLE
They are starting to purge the Parasytes and best place would be to start from the Government. Also Shinichi gave some information about the parasytes like Gotou.

I don't remember an episode when there wasn't a cliffhanger.

I remember one time. Way back when they released 2 episodes on the same day, the first episode didn't have a cliffhanger, but the second one did.

"Ah finally. After long hours of work, another episode done."

"Sir, this one doesn't end on a cliffhanger."

"What?! Shit! Quick, make another one!"
>> ARTICLE
Why madhouse? Why must you torture me with these cliffhangers?
>> ARTICLE
Why couldn't the killer detect Izumi when he was in the van? Migi was awake at that time.
>> ARTICLE
Probably didn't concentrate on him.
>> ARTICLE
He has to look a Parasyte in the eyes to detect them.  I don't think we have any indication that he actually has Kana's Parasyte-radar, just the ability to look in someone's eyes and know if they are human or not.  Kind of like how Shinichi always fucks up and lets a Parasyte know he's the one by looking the Parasyte in the eyes.

So, maybe if the killer looks in Migi's eye he'll figure it out.
>> ARTICLE
Looking into an eye on a hand, yep its a parasite
>> ARTICLE
I doubt that he has any kind of precise detection (like Kana). Rather, he has an affinity to recognise the murderous intent of the parasites. 

A monster that recognizes other monsters is more of what I get from his "ability". 
>> ARTICLE
The one murder that he didn't commit is the one murder that lands him jail..Ironic
>> ARTICLE
Just as Tamura Reiko passed her humanity to Shinichi, [Kana has passed her title as best girl to Murano](http://i.imgur.com/5nqAOvr.png). No seriously, I actually liked Murano for once. Romance for Shinichi! Yay! He finally got a break.

So, correct me if I'm wrong, the serial killer got his ability to sense Parasytes because he messed too much with humans? Where did Kana get hers then?

They should already change the name of Parasyte -the maxim- to Parasyte -the cliffhanger-. I don't remember the last time we didn't get a cliffhanger.
>> ARTICLE
That's all its been for the past 5 or so episodes. It's killing me.
>> ARTICLE
I think we need more than Murano not asking Shinichi if he is really Shinichi for an episode before she gets crowned Best Girl. That said, I was impressed she managed to string a few sentences together without accusing Shinichi of something or crying.
>> ARTICLE
>the serial killer got his ability to sense Parasytes because he messed too much with humans? Where did Kana get hers then?

We don't know for certain he got his ability to sense them from killing humans that was just how he thought he got them

I think this is correct, at this point it just seems certain humans are born with the ability and his murder antics was how he was able to justify his power to himself.

Looks like this new guy has same ability to tell apart Parasytes as Kana did.. lucky Migi was asleep during the interrogation at the police station. But I wonder if he can sense Migi in Shinichi when he becomes awake again, like in that surveillance van together, since Kana was able to distinguish Shinichi before 
>> ARTICLE
I think he can sense parasytes by their intent to kill. Since shinichi doesn't really have that intention most of the time , he won't notice. But other parasytes that act cold and calculating sticks out to him since that's like his second nature.

I noticed for the first time this week that the episode titles are named after book titles. Probably *slowpoke.jpeg* as hell though.

edit: Circled in the 2nd pic where Shinichi should've been according to previous and next pictures
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi and Murano are towards the middle of that shot. They never made it very far past the inspector. If you look at the shots leading up to this you'll see they never make it to the brick wall before they stop.

That being said, that character you have circled certainly looks like Murano. I bet they reused some animation of her to fill out this scene. There was a lot of budget saving tactics used this episode. Maybe the most in Parasyte so far.
>> ARTICLE
Man, Satomi's speech in the courtyard was really cringe-inducing. Besides that, good episode.
>> ARTICLE
Murano said more than one sentence this episode...I...I feel like I'm dreaming.

...Although, what she had to say...was kinda dumb...

Murano: Shinichi a lot of [good things happened too.](http://i.imgur.com/XOBfZfN.png)

Shinichi: Like what?

Murano: Oh, you're actually asking me a direct question? Woah, ease up there. But since you asked...how about that time when dozens of our classmates were slaughtered in front of my eyes and you arrived in the nick of time to jump several stories out a window with me in your arms!

Shinichi: I...I guess that was good?

Murano: Or that time when you spent a few weeks ignoring me because you were hanging out with that girl who had a much better character design and backstory than I do, who was more interesting than me in every way...but then she got pierced through the heart and died.  That was a good one.

Shinichi: Murano, that's, kind of heartless.

Murano: Or that time when I met you in the park and you were standing over a dead woman with a crying baby in your arms with police officers pointing guns at you. The crazy shenanigans we got up to. So much fun!

Shinichi: Are, are you really Murano?

Murano: It's so unfair that the police keep singling you out.  There's nothing weird about you. Your super speed, ability to jump over 10 foot fences and walls, or out of tall buildings with little effect to you is all just part of what makes you super kawaii.  Obviously, nothing links you to these monsters that are killing all of our friends and family.  Who could possibly put that together?

Migi: Shinichi, this bitch is cray.
>> ARTICLE
Eh Kana was worse. I feel like Murano suffers from bad writing. A lot of her dialogue doesn't make much sense.
>> ARTICLE
Well, then what's good about her if her writing is bad? She looks pretty? Her animation is good? I'm confused, because writing basically makes a character what they are.  So, if her writing is consistently bad, I'd tend to say that Murano is a bad character.
>> ARTICLE
I'm largely referring to her dialogue. It's piss poor.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I cannot comprehend how people liked Kana at all. She was so dumb (dumb enough to get her ass killed) and a bully. She was totally fine hanging out with Mitsuo and his group just watching them kick the shit out of that defenseless dude for no reason. And some people still call her best girl lol 
>> ARTICLE
Biggest / one of the only reasons I actually kind of like Kana is because of Sawashiro Miyuki.

Sawashiro Miyuki = can't hate, for me at least <3

Not sure why you're nitpicking something she said, considering the fact that when she referrred to the "good times", you can assume that she meant before all this crazy shit happened.
>> ARTICLE
Right, like their date and the other times that won't show up on-screen. In any case, she is just trying to lighten the mood whenever she is around him. She doesn't make him re-live the events by bringing them up.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, for serious, man.  

I mean, they went on a couple of dates before shit went crazy. She got to spend more time with her dear friend Shinichi. Like, give the damn girl a break, dude. She's trying to just be like "Hey, ya know, shit's all fucked up, but...we've got each other, right? We can still try to be normal, even though brain stealing parasites could at any second come and destroy us all."

I don't quite get exactly how much Shinichi has told the inspector.  How do you weave in an encounter with Gotou, seeing his multi parasytes, and not raise suspicion of himself?  The interaction between Shinichi and the inspector is just really confusing.

Also the xray machine was a pretty logical idea.  Though I don't get that bit about 'removing non-human parts'.    Would parasytes bother to mimic the skull when you can't even see it from the outside?   From past episodes it seems that parasytes don't put as much thought into their internal structure as they place in their external appearance.  Just examining the skeleton should be enough to spot them.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't know how he explained Tamura Reiko giving him the baby.

So it begins!!! The time to fight back has came!! Who will be standing last?? Humanity or parasytes?? I wonder what part shinichi will play on the fight

Fun fact for anybody also watching Kancolle who may have noticed Mutsuki and Kisaragi squad: the military's squads are named after the Mutsuki-class Destroyers (Utsuki probably meant Uzuki) from World War II.

When did the outro change? Only just noticed that as it's only a subtle difference. 
>> ARTICLE
It changed last episode.
>> ARTICLE
Why did they have to make the whole crowd CG? It looked so bad. Also, when the inspector asked Shinichi if he could help in public, I was somewhat confused. That's going to raise a lot of trouble and questions for him now.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't feel like the inspector asking him for help was well executed. It felt like everyone was talking past each other and saying scripted lines, not actually trying to get Shin to join. 
>> ARTICLE
They've been making every background character since episode 1 cg. If you don't pay attention to it then it's not hard to get past since making them cg will make everything else in 2d animated better to save time and so the environment isn't completely empty like in every anime.
>> ARTICLE
I just didn't like it this week because there were shots of just the cgi crowd. They just weren't in the background anymore, but they were the focus of the shot.

Fire? Who would have thought that things burn when you put them on fire. Or that when they are caught by surprise with fire, they panic.

But now I can see another parallel (kind of) with the movie The Thing. They infect, they modify phisiology, and they act negatively to fire.

I suppose parasites have a similar WTF moment with fire as shimada who was burned by a bottle of solvent. Before inside cells and outside cells figure what the heck is going on the wounds add to the confusion and precious seconds are lost.

Damn, that cliffhanger again. I'm wondering how they're going to eliminate the parasytes, I mean they can't just shoot them right on identification. I don't want to wait guys. So hard to not read the manga at this point. :<
>> ARTICLE
I'm confused. Why doesn't Shinichi help them?
>> ARTICLE
I would think him helping out by targeting parasytes with precision, would flag him as either a murderous nutjob (like the prisoner) or would confirm his strong implication in this whole parasyte ordeal (even though he is already under scrutiny)

I wouldn't help them either. And hey, who cares, they have scans to detect that on their own
>> ARTICLE
As always another cliffhanger...
>> ARTICLE
Well not that big of a cliffhanger though.
>> ARTICLE
True.
>> ARTICLE
HAPPY PARASYTE DAY!

Seriously, Parasyte needs to adopt the DBZ formula and just get Kyle Hebert in here for the announcer. Every week there's a god damned cliffhanger. 

That being said, there is plenty of development and plot being pushed forward to the point where this episode satisfied me greatly. Mostly because I'm Captain of S.S. Murano but hey. Whatever. I do what I want! Great episode all around imo, and can't wait for next week :)
>> ARTICLE
So if they have the technology to tell parasites apart from humans, why do they need the criminal and Shinichi?

Because from the looks of that scene said tech has to be pretty damn close to them and can't be used in a large crowd of people.

Shit is going down next episode right? Things are looking pretty exciting. Also I hope Shinichi is finally getting around to sorting things out with Murano. She took notes for him, so that means she still cared about him during that rough patch. I just want Shinichi to be happy dammit!

Wait... If Reiko turned her face into Shinichis mom, that means she has seen his mom, the police saw her change they were all aiming for her and wouldn't that mean they should ask Shinichi why she changed her face and if he knew who that was?

Edit: Obviously this is last episode-material but Im wondering because I thought it would be called into question this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that was just Shinichi's mental delusion, indicating that Reiko reminded him of the concept of "mother".

I may have to go back and rewatch it to see if it was more of a literal shapeshift.
>> ARTICLE
Reiko went to shinichi's house and saw his mom's photos. She knows her face and was able to change to it. Remember she said "How can i appeal to your humanity..."

why doesn't he sent an anonymous letter to the cops telling them about that parasite that try to kill him? .
>> ARTICLE
I can't help but feel like the show has been going down hill since episode 17. The shit that went down in episodes -$ and 18 borderline making no sense, and then we have this episode, which was just leading up to what might be a massive slaughter. That would be cool if it were an action anime, but I found I liked the series most when all the parasites were working together, infiltrating the government, while also gaining their own "humanity." The show was at its best when they touched on the subjects of humanity, and other species potentially hunting us, but j feel like now it'll just be action fights and boss battles galore. 

I hope I'm wrong and the show picks up. Maybe touch on what would happen if the world found out, and the hysteria that would be caused? Maybe touch on what humans would do to get their way (like killing other humans to get to the parasites), something, anything. I just don't want the show to become another action flick for the last few episodes. I don't have much faith in the story itself since its felt pretty shoddy the last few weeks, so hopefully that changes too. 

But good job on them with the scene in the first episode. I would have never remembered that. I need to pay more attention while watching these shows!

>> ARTICLE
I suppose at the very end even selfish Migi recognised his own feelings and told Shinichi to run. Was that altruism he claimed to never comprehend or just a harsh calculation? I guess we'll never know.
>> ARTICLE
I am thinking probably a mix of both. It was probably altruism first of all, hearing his inner monologue and all. But, secondly, even calculations, that was the best choice. Either Shinichi stayed and got killed, which would result in Migi also dying, OR he runs, Migi dies, but at least one of the two stays alive. Harsh calculations, while also being altruism
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind, 30% of Migi is left inside Shinichi. 

So in a way, he decided 70% of him is doomed, but at least the remaining portion can survive. 
>> ARTICLE
Very true! He probably figured that, with that choice, there was a higher % of chance to defeat gotou
>> ARTICLE
The harsh calculation would be to try and let Shinichi do whatever he could to ensure the survival of both. So not yelling "run!" but "save me!". I wonder what %chance survival Migi came up with.
>> ARTICLE
Excepg if that number was so low that the harsh calculation was "well, he cant save me, the chance isnt high enough" anr then, altruism enters and coexists with harshness. :P
>> ARTICLE
The chances of Shinichi beating him in a straight up confrontation like that without Migi are nonexistent. 
>> ARTICLE
Depends on what Migi finds valuable. If he considers Shinichi's life valuable at all, then him running is the best outcome, since his chance to do anything is negligible. I would also consider Shinichi's upcoming sacrifice a example of rational altruism. If he considers the lives of others to be valuable, and his life as well, then just one person dying (him) is preferable to many people dying.
>> ARTICLE
His inner monologue as he died makes me think it's the former.

After the last episode, we all know what that means.

Edit: I also have a theory that Migi isn't really dead; that he just got absorbed into Gotou's body and is going to self-destruct in an act of sacrifice or be re-absorbed into Shinichi, who will then proceed to kill the shit out of Gotou.
>> ARTICLE
Ok did no one else see Migi's eye? Whether his conscience remains or not we don't know.

I seent it! 

Either way I didn't think Migi was dead anyway. They did the cliche thing where they didn't actually show him die.

Couldn't have migi learned the same move as Tamya where you go inside another parasite and kill em 
>> ARTICLE

I had the same thought at the end. In my opinion Migi isnt dead and its either gone one of two ways:

1. Hes using Gotous body for life until he can find Shinichi again.

2. By some magical way Migi is going to regrow as Shinichis right arm using the minuscule amounts of cells left in his body.
>> ARTICLE
As soon as the 'monster with 4 legs and 3 eyes' was said, the first thing I thought was it has to be migi, since ~~toto~~ gotou has two legs and two eyes. I wouldn't be surprised if he took over a bear or a wolf or something after faking his death.

But then again we could have a plot twist where he grows back since we saw the eye on his arm stump.

Only 2 eps left and 4 manga chapters.. I wonder if they will cover 2 manga per episode or maybe add a different ending? 
>> ARTICLE
This episode alone covered 3 chapters, so shouldn't be a problem.

That was my guess too, but I think Migi is somehow corrupting Gotou or preventing him from becoming normal.
>> ARTICLE
The stone I pic 3 looks impossible to climb in the anime, with 1 arm and all.
>> ARTICLE
He is super strong, remember?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Gotou is going to be adopting a human appearance after this. I think he's ready to cut some shit up.
>> ARTICLE
Gotou is likely to go full rambo in that forest. Poor hunters.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, a good plan, fell just short. At least we know Migi isn't completely dead, the cells within Shinichi are still alive.  Still a really sad scene though, how human Migi had become, how [alone](http://i.imgur.com/nUIdJcd.png) he felt in death.
  
Something has to happen, there's no way Shinichi can fight Gotou alone, missing an arm as well. Something is up with Gotou though, he took on a monstrous appearance now.
>> ARTICLE
I have not read the manga, so this cannot possibly be a spoiler, but the Chekhov's gun strongly hints that large scale fire with the garbage dump will be utilized in a nearly suicidal attempt. That is also some pretty fitting stuff for an environmentalist monster to be killed by garbage fire.
>> ARTICLE
It's a bit obvious from his dream with mini-Migi that Migi is still alive. Migi probably did something to Gotou/Gotou did something to Migi.
>> ARTICLE
at first I thought Migi was going to turn into [flamethrower form](http://i.imgur.com/Nvn5opF.png), after bringing the lighter with him.. too bad we didn't get to see *that* being used against Gotou instead of the fire arrow
>> ARTICLE
Problem with flamethrowers is that they use an incredible amount of fuel when fired. The reason games like Call of Duty let you have so much fuel is because in the time it takes to expend a tank in-game, you would have long since expended your resources.

Hell, Ripley's flamethrower in Alien had enough fuel for about 2 seconds of fire, if you consider the scale of the tank it utilized.

My deodorant bus must be some next level warfare shit then

[It looks like he's driving with his dick.](http://i.imgur.com/rqJn5s6.png)
>> ARTICLE
Cannot unsee.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if it's possible that Migi was able to leech off of Gotou while he was regenerating. Could explain why Gotou seems to have taken such a monstrous appearance. He's fighting with Migi for control.
>> ARTICLE
That was my exact thought- Gotou spent a lot of energy controlling *willing* parasites, now he's actively fighting one for control.


It would be a pretty big cop out, but imagine if Migi won the battle for control and basically protected the humans- old school migi, not a chance, but his 'death' monologue made him seem pretty human, and he clearly cares for Shinichi now.
>> ARTICLE
I hope they really didn't kill best parasyte Migi. 

And here's to Gotou dying in a flaming mountain of trash (even though he's badass).
>> ARTICLE
[Imagine if Migi merged with Gotou and caused him to get caught in the trash fire](http://www.gifbin.com/bin/1237977458_thumbsup-terminator.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, they mentioned the trash heap twice and mentioned it burning. Chekhov's Gun says something's gonna happen with that.
>> ARTICLE
Do they make [tops like this?](http://i.imgur.com/GWIbBlX.png) It seems to be perfect for his [extra pair of battle appendages.](http://i.imgur.com/ozK8SIa.png) (EDIT: [This picture](http://i.imgur.com/HUT6Lxb.png) shows it better. Also, dat bulge).

You'll see those sort of vests being worn in gyms lots, just not as skin-tight as Gotou's: http://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v0/148911365/Custom_stringer_bodybuilding_gym_vest_for_men.jpg_350x350.jpg Though usually tighter than that pic, but that was all I could find!

They're basically for showing off your lats or giving them space when you work out and blood starts pumping into your muscles.

So he and Migi didn't manage to kill Gotou, but the meat cleaver he got from that old lady will surely do the trick.
>> ARTICLE
Last time when Shinichi died, he got a power upgrade. Now that Migi has died, he'll certainly get another one.
>> ARTICLE
hmm... rusty old blade that surely couldn't be enough to kill him...

What if the cleaver is enough to cut off an appendage, which just so happens to be Migi who was struggling to resist Gotou?
>> ARTICLE
Guys Shinichi is not exempted from dying. I mean, there's no reason to have a happy ending. (Haven't read manga.)
>> ARTICLE
If a pan can save someone from death(Cross Ange), then a meat cleaver should be able to do it as well
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi should have taken a frying pan from the house...
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, man, [meat cleavers can't hope to catch up to pans in pure utility.](https://i.imgur.com/NbZY0ye.jpg)

Have you even Seen Tangeled?

The Frying pan is the Excalibur of close combat weaponry.

Edit; Tangeled
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean Tangled?
>> ARTICLE
No, the pokemon version of it, Tangela'd.
>> ARTICLE
That grandma is suppose to signify something but I'm too dumb to figure it out. 
>> ARTICLE
That grandma's Murano after Shinichi dies.
Disclaimer, I haven't read the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
She represents the opposition of fighting for the greater good. Here argument against Shinichi going off to fight for others and not giving his own life more value is a personal matter for her, and it might be implied that her own husband, who she prayed to, had left her a widow to go fight in a battle, too. She was convincing Shinichi to stay because she knows that there are others who will hurt just like she is, if he is gone...
>> ARTICLE
Basic human empathy beyond genetic/family bonds? Much like how Migi and Shinichi came to feel for each other, despite *not even being from the same* **species**
>> ARTICLE
[I really like the detail of how when Migi's driving he forms a second eye instead of just using his usual one.](http://i.imgur.com/rqJn5s6.png) Depth perception is really important when driving, people! RIP most responsible parasyte :,(
>> ARTICLE
Most responsible? He didn't have a driver's license! Hell he stole a car! How's that for responsible? 

I almost complained about the no seatbelt, but I did notice Shinichi had it on.
>> ARTICLE
I'm dumping all my chips into the fact that Migi somehow morphed into Gotou and is causing all of the weird shit that is going on with his appearance.
>> ARTICLE
He might have absorbed him as well...that means he has a total of 4 parasytes in him then.
>> ARTICLE
It would actually make six parasytes total. The original count of three was made because Miki couldn't unify all five of the parasytes into one.
>> ARTICLE
Get real guys, Migi isn't dead. They wouldn't have treated his death with such little intensity compared to Best Parasyte Mom's death. And then there's the fact Shinichi already talked to his Migi cells in dreams: that's a Chekhov's arm if I ever saw one.
>> ARTICLE
The funny thing is that she was the only parasyte mom in the show.
>> ARTICLE
Tamiya Ryoko and Shinichi's mom were both parasyte moms. 
>> ARTICLE
So after getting laid, Shinichi runs into the forest to fight an alien serial killer, loses an arm, and then lives with an old lady for a week or so. Good to know.  
Also I totally did not see that coming. Migi why :(
>> ARTICLE
Next episode :
Alien vs Predator animated sequel.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing wrong with that :)
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else thinks that Migi's death was strangely anti-climatic?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he's dead at all, the conversation Shinichi had in his dream-state makes me think he's very much alive.


I'm guessing Migi replaced the leg parasites that were cut off or something, and is the reason Gotou doesn't appear to be *normal* anymore. Gotou was able to pull all of them together, but from what I could tell, all of them were okay with that- now he's trying to control Migi, who is fighting him mentally or something.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah...all that build up, then he just throws a spear and runs away
>> ARTICLE
It was but it kinda fits well in this show's "death is unexpected, violent and it sucks a lot" theme.
>> ARTICLE
yes, but even then the death is still somehow emotional, like when Kana and Tamura died.
>> ARTICLE
A bit sad to hear him say, "so this is what death feels like.."
>> ARTICLE
> A bit sad to hear him say, "so this is what death feels like.."

dry miggy with blue back makes me more sad...
>> ARTICLE
[I thought this was sad.](http://i.imgur.com/nUIdJcd.png)
>> ARTICLE
That hit the feels hard...
>> ARTICLE
Too anticlimactic that you know he'll somehow be back.
>> ARTICLE
Well, also, you know the damn ED video pretty much spoiled that everything will be ok in the end from episode 1. He's returning home with two hands in the same hoodie he has on now and the prior part is him old with Murano.
>> ARTICLE
Well we were told quite plainly that Migi is still alive. I'm with the "Gotou absorbed/ate/schlorped him up" camp.
>> ARTICLE
In other news, scientists have discovered  that those who have reportedly watched Parasyte have gained the ability of time travel. In a mere three minutes they can travel approximately 20 minutes into the future.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously though that episode was 3 minutes long, I don't care what the episode timer at the bottom said.
>> ARTICLE
I swear I've seen this joke like 10 times already.
>> ARTICLE
I don't get it?
>> ARTICLE
Episodes go by so fast. 
>> ARTICLE
I hate finding out about this anime before it was finished, the temptation to see the latest episode is too high and it only feels like 3 minutes, now back to waiting an entire week to see what happens next.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, figured. Thought it might have been something more intricate than that. Time flies when you're having fun.
>> ARTICLE
10 times?  I've seen it in every single parasyte, shigatsu, and nanatsu thread for the last 5 months.  It's an obnoxious grab for karma at this point and in no way is relevant to any discussion.  /rant
>> ARTICLE
Migi may have died, but a part of him will always live on inside Shinichi. Literally.
>> ARTICLE
Migi: Just remember, I will always be with you, right here.   
Shinichi: In my heart?  
Migi: Actually, in your arteries.
>> ARTICLE
I've been thinking that this anime is a nice, refreshing change of pace from the majority of the stuff coming out in recent years. 

Feeling a bit impatient, I read the ending of the manga (if you're on the edge about doing this, I recommend that you wait for the anime to air) and checked the Wikipedia page to see what else the author has made, and I noticed that this was written about 20 years ago. This certainly has that sense of maturity that manga and anime from the 90s and early 2000s were more likely to have, but I'm quite surprised that we're seeing an anime adaptation of something so old.

its actually cool they adapted the the settings, clothing etc to match the current trends

But i guess it wasn't all that important. They seem to have picked up the pace anyway in order to get through all the content left before it ends. It's understandable they'd miss details.

That'll actually be pretty cool to watch, but we've seen enough demonstrations of his ability.

That scream of anguish :( poor shinichi

I feel even more strongly about man made parasytes now.

They showed us the landfill to underline how human overpopulation is going out of control, and that presumably someone created the parasytes to fix that. 
>> ARTICLE
Question to people who are into japanese. Did you notice that in the preview of episode 21,22 and 23 the title spoken by Shinichi sounds exactly the same but has different kanji? Anyone with clever input on that?
>> ARTICLE
wow, you're right
21 "Sex and Spirit" "Sei to Sei" () 
22 "Quiescence and Awakening" "Sei to Sei" () 
23 "Life and Vows" "Life and Vows"() 

not that I have any clever input tho

We all know Migi will make some kind of comeback.

:( How Migi has changed throughout the series, I will miss him!

At 15:20 after Mitsuyo (old lady) said "Go back to sleep" was it a coincidence that "dream Migi" then immediately disappears, or was it complying to an order?

When I heard Migi yell in distress, I knew something was going to go wrong.

Migi nooo~

I hope the rest of it stayed alive somehow. Probably not, given the nature of the series.

One point that bothers me though... Why didn't Shinichi prepared multiple spears to light and throw? The first one clearly worked, he could have thrown more and utterly wrecked Gotou, giving Migi more opportunity to slice him up AND to escape.

There won't be a second season right?

Considering this covers pretty much the entirety of the manga, i'd say that's a safe bet.
>> ARTICLE
I am just wondering about one thing in this episode, why didn't he just threw the spear into goto's head? With the damage done by that + the fire weakening his cells, goto shouldn't have been able to do much with his head and that would have been  an easy win for migi, no?
>> ARTICLE
Considering he was missing an arm and probably didn't have any practice with throwing a javelin to begin with, he probably wasn't physically able to do it.
>> ARTICLE
Wondering if Migi's cells were absorbed by Gotoh causing Gotoh's body to go haywire. Otherwise, why else would Gotoh be in that state when the head wasn't fully removed from the body?
>> ARTICLE
Quite a few bits were chopped off of Gotou before Migi blacked out, its possible he's trying to reign in the limb Parasytes which no longer have enough cells to remain fully functional. After all, when Tamura Ryouko split herself up she seemed to lose a lot of her faculties.

I caved and read the whole manga since there were only 5 chapters left. 5/5 stars

I'm finally caught up to you guys!


Did anyone else feel like that episode was rushed, though? The pacing was way too fast and I feel like there wasn't as much of an emotional impact because of it.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope Gotou will have absorbed Migi into himself after Shinichi ran away so that the final episode can have Migi pulling one last move on Gotou by killing him from the inside.

So Migi learned to drive in GTA?

Every episode for some reason I keep rewinding back to the intro since it is just soooooooooooooooooooooo gooood

Holy shit the pacing from the fight against Gotou was so fast

I don't like how Shinji's personality developed from being a coward to TOTAL BADASS with no emotions, back again to crying Shinji. Seems weird but maybe that's just me.

Amazing episode nevertheless :D 2 EPISODES LEFT :"(

I have an odd feeling that migi joined onto gotou just to survive.

tear breaking scene "*sniff* *sniff*"
>> ARTICLE
Before the eyeball showed up on his arm stub, I was totally expecting Migi to show up in the form of Murano's babby or something. With the cells being spread all into Shinichi's body, it could of been put elsewhere too.
>> ARTICLE
I fell like we are supposed to know the women's husband where Sinichi was staying. I feel like it was random just to add that last bit at the end.
>> ARTICLE
It's called inference and it makes stories more interesting when the writers don;t have to spell out every detail for us. I like the idea that the speech she gave Shinichi (the one about valuing his own life more) was the feelings she had felt about her own husband making her a widow when he went off to war.
>> ARTICLE
Miiigiiiiiiiiiiii.

Why.
>> ARTICLE
noooo, miggiiii, noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

i srsly wonder how he will win now...
>> ARTICLE
With power of friendship!
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else think there is more to that old woman? 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what it was about this episode but it might have been my last favourite of the entire series so far.
First, Murano wasn't even mentioned once, not even in interior dialogue.
Second, Migi's "death" felt really rushed. Maybe it's because I'm used to the big events happening at the end of an episode but the fact Migi died then the episode just carried on felt really weird.
>> ARTICLE
1. I don't think Murano was mentioned because she had no real reason to be in it, and with all the things happening in one episode I think they wanted to focus it on shinichi. Sure they could have mentioned her in a dialogue but since everyone already knew who he wanted to protect, they probably did not think it was necessary.
2. Why Migi's "death" felt really rushed were most probably airtime and the fact that he weren't actually dead.

Just my thoughts of it. :)
>> ARTICLE
I don't believe that Migi is dead, it may be that migi is the beast that is feeding off people in the woods.... I don't know but it's just a hunch. Do any of you guys feel the same way?
>> ARTICLE
MIGIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling that Migi attached himself to Gotou, making it possible to detach once he sees Shinichi and reconnect to where he belongs. Merely speculation.
>> ARTICLE
F
>> ARTICLE
Migi showing what it means to really be someone's Right-Hand Man.
>> ARTICLE
This episode felt weird... The way both Migi and Sinichi acted didn't seem like how they would react at all, migi going from a parasyte who don't care about anything else than survival, to sacrifising his life and caring for Sinichi alot in just 1-3 episodes? And I didn't know Sinichi valued Migi that much.
>> ARTICLE
There was a lot of foreshadowing of this. The shower scene, the trust he has built, the lecture Migi gave to the P.I., and even the beginning of the episode when Migi apologized for "spoiling the mood"
>> ARTICLE
WHAT? NOOOO not migi :(

PLEASE someone tell me what will happen to migi. Cant fucking wait next week for another 3 min episode

That's just Migi trying to confuse Gotou.
>> ARTICLE
Don't ruin this for me
>> ARTICLE
this show continues to tie with tokyo ghoul for my favorite series.
>> ARTICLE
:(
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's obvious the mangaka just wanted to end off the story with its stagnated protagonist.

Shinichi and Migi's relationship wasn't anything that's been focused a lot for this to be proper catharsis, it comes with Migi being a survivalist being, despite softening up. 

I mean we open up with: Yo, Shinichi, you're about to be killed- RUN!  
The strategy was actually rather well done, but I don't see how survivalist Shinichi wouldn't *rip his damn head off* in reckless desperation while being tense.

And then we get the granny... \*sigh*  
I know what you're trying to do, you want to make this end cathartic for the viewer and reflect on the journey from what we have experienced... the thing is that we didn't particularly experience a lot. The granny doesn't give a proper mirror for Shinichi to look at himself, we're treated to another environmentalist message instead...

The directing has also been sub par due to still adapting panels instead of taking advantage of the animated medium where you can *move and give a sense of spatiality*. Not to mention it doesn't have a distinct atmosphere either, the music just isn't enough.

Well, I'll hope for a good fight at least, but Parasyte will dwindle down and whimper, remembered as a an edgy show that's too slow and boring to bother with, falling into obscurity.
>> ARTICLE
I think their relationship was focused on, but not in the way the mangaka tried to. As in, we saw them grow more as partners, and they both needed each other, Migi because he's a parasite and Shinichi needed Migi because without him he 1) would be dead and 2) would probably go insane like he did last episode. But the show never developed them as friends, like this scene is making them out to be. 

My thing is, I can totally see Migi die for shinichi, not take a bullet for him, but in a case like this where Migi is clearly gonna die, I can see Migi telling shinichi to run, because there is no need for 2 people to die, I think he developed enough for that. Had the show kept it like that, I'd be cool, but they gave us this frustrating inner monologue about how they were friends, which just felt forced and cheesy. 
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "RIP best girl :(")
>> ARTICLE
This episode sucked. So they introduce a pointless new character who someone grows close to shinichi within a few days right at the climax of the show? Why break it up like this?   


>> ARTICLE
I still think the climax was Tamura's death. Since then, while the assault on the mayor wasn't that bad, everything was worse.
>> ARTICLE
That episode was garbage.
Before you rush to downvote me, allow me to explain:

There was really only one issue, but it was really such a blundering loss of standards that it really can't be ignored: PACING.

Until now, Parasyte was arguably the most well-paced 2-cour anime I'd ever seen. Let's go over why the pacing completely fell through the roof this episode (and the last 3 minutes of the previous):

* Shinichi lost his virginity to a girl with (sorry folks) no relevance to the plot
* Having sex with Murano was literally shoved down our throat yet they never mentioned the sex, nor Murano since it happened
* Directly after the sex scene, we start this episode in a car chase with barely any context 
* With almost no foreshadowing, this episode Migi all of a sudden has a range of emotions as wide as any human's; the bullshit radar flies the highest when he commits an act of pure altruism by sacrificing himself for Shinichi
* After Migi "dies", Shinichi lives with some random old lady for like a week/month to make up for the obvious lack of a companion relationship in the plot now that Migi is "dead"
* Shinichi shows no signs of remembering his dad or Murano during this time
* Shinichi, who was unwilling to kill Gotou when Migi told him to run, is now going to try to kill Gotou solo with a rusty butcher's knife and a missing arm

I just have no idea what happened in the past episode and a half. I'm just staring in complete shock. Did the magic run out at Madhouse? I can't imagine the pacing was *this* bad in the manga.


>> ARTICLE
I'm trying to decide if you're retarded, or being willfully ignorant?

The episode clearly starts with him walking home the morning after the end of last episode.

Migi has been developing a slough of human emotions over the past couple months, and there was even a point where he was more "human" than Shinichi.

"Shows no signs of remembering his dad." Literally the first time he was planning on leaving the ladies house his plan was to go home to his dad and explain everything. 

As for going after Gotou now alone, it's within Shinichi's character to go and fight if it means saving someone else, typically humans. Not sure why you're acting surprised.
>> ARTICLE
Fair point about him planning to go see his dad.

> within Shinichi's character to go and fight

He turned and ran at the beginning of the episode actually. Also, we spent all of episode 21 watching how his paranoia of getting cornered by Gotou was getting to him. And now you're saying that despite these things the show can accurately convey him gaining the confidence to go stumbling into battle with the one person who's truly shaken his resolve, *in 5 minutes of screentime*?

Also, you seemed to ignore my original point: none of my critiques were against the factual correctness of the episode yet you are arguing their factual correctness. I said the pacing was bad and everything I wrote is describing how it was rushed. This should have been written for 2 or even 3 episodes. Not 1 episode.
>> ARTICLE
> Did the magic run out at Madhouse? I can't imagine the pacing was this bad in the manga.

its actually incredibly faithful to the manga.
>> ARTICLE
> I can't imagine the pacing was this bad in the manga

I was actually implying that Parasyte until this point has been very faithful to the manga, so I was shocked that such a sudden turn of events would happen. Really just curiosity stemming from the fact that the past episode did not seem like something this mangaka would rush through.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't see a pacing problem so much as a felt the actual plot points themselves being rushed as hell. A show doing too much in a single episode and thus having a pacing problem is different than a show doing something too early (unless you mean there is a problem with the story and pacing, I just don't see it with the latter). 

I agree, I never felt that Migi was softening up to the point for him to have emotions like that. His point that "it is meaningless for us both to die" sounded logical from all they been through, so that isn't the problem so much as the his inner thoughts are. 

Basically, Migi sacrificing himself for shinichi because it is the logical thing to do (even if it somewhat goes against "parasite code") I can tolerate, but his super depressing inner monologue came out of nowhere I agree.  
>> ARTICLE
Migi sacrificing himself didn't make that much sense considering what a logical and rational being he's supposed to be. OK, Shinichi runs away and survives for now, but then when Gotou finds him again he'll have to fight alone and will surely die. Maybe he should have used that chance and tried to finish Gotou off for good.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that was the most rational thing he could have done. He assessed the situation, the element of surprise was lost, and ascertained that he wouldn't be able to protect shinichi any longer. His probability of survival at that time was inexistent. Not to mention that the cells in Shinichi's body could be a factor he had already calculated.

Not to mention that Gotou couldn't detect him without Migi's presence. It's only because Shinichi is throwing himself back into the fire...

the old lady being the detective's wife is anime original right? i read the manga but didnt recall the old lady having any connection to the detective but the anime shows that she is praying to the detective's picture?

[expectation spoiler](/s "no, she's just a random resident of countryside.")
>> ARTICLE
Alright guys... despite that MAL call it a 24 episodes season. IMO **next episode is definitely the finale**.
>> ARTICLE
Come on, they can't wrap it up that fast with those 3 minute episodes.

>> ARTICLE
I really don't wanna disappoint or alter anyone's expectation, but this isn't your common action shounen.
>> ARTICLE
If this falls short of the ridiculous expectations this sub has built onto it, I'm gonna... do absolutely nothing because that's how it nearly always plays out.

Seriously though this looks pretty good, I'm excited.  Manga readers: is it actually horror?  I've never seen anime do horror very well.
>> ARTICLE
It's a mix of Shounen and Horror, mostly Psychological
>> ARTICLE
I would say that it approaches horror in a manner similar to how Army of Darkness did only with a fair amount of gore.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte builds suspense, but most of the "horror" is body gore and shock value. Most of the people I know who liked Parasyte liked it for the characters and their struggles. Also Migi is the greatest.
>> ARTICLE
I've learned to never give into hype again after the failures that were Coppelion, Nobunaga the Fool, and Pupa. Keeping expectations low helps.
>> ARTICLE
There are horror elements, but it's much more like a sci-fi/supernatural show grounded in a modern setting.

I feel like a lot of the quality of this show is how they handle the voice of one of the key characters. It can either be perfect or horribly annoying.
>> ARTICLE
[They've already announced some of the main cast.](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/07/29-1/parasyte-anime-staff-and-cast-announced)  Assuming you're talking about the weird alien thing, it's being voiced by [Aya Hirano](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/07/29-1/parasyte-anime-staff-and-cast-announced) of Haruhi fame.
>> ARTICLE
The voice actor is less important than what they decide to do with the voice itself. Will it have modulation effects to make it sound more alien? Will it be the classic tiny creature voice (high-pitched and squirrely)? Will it be her natural voice with strange speech patterns?

That character covers a huge portion of the dialogue and story. The voice has to sit well with me or the show could be unwatchable.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, we'll see.  Hopefully they don't go with squirrelly, although that tends to be the case.
>> ARTICLE
 I always use Doraemon's voice to read his sentences.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, but do you use the classic voice or the newfangled 2005 voice?
>> ARTICLE
I feel like anime as a whole overdoes (isthataword?) gore for the shock factor, just like a lot of horror movies with jump-scares except way less actually scaring anyone. A lot of self-proclaimed horror anime are barely horror to begin with. But, in general, the few anime that focus on psychological horror with gore as an afterthought are way better imo. That said, Parasyte being legit horror would be awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think anime in general works in a horror setting, from my viewing experience only Corpse Party managed to stand out but that was because of the gruesome use of sound effects and gore. That being said Corpse Party still didn't succeed in being a good horror because it just failed at creating a right setting.

And the main factor being that it's anime if you can't relate to any of the characters being put in a horrifying situation then the horror aspect just won't work.
>> ARTICLE
The best horror anime I've seen, imo, was Monoke. It's based off old Japanese mythology and spirits and used suspense rather then gore and stuff. It managed to pull off unsettling and weird without going into the absurd. I'd really recommend you check it out if you want to see a decent horror anime. The art style is very very different from most anime. But it's more like horror stories rather then a horror set in a realistic setting. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks that sounds interesting, always a fan of anime that does something out of the norm even if it is with something like art style.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't make sense though because animation has near limitless creativity. Things like a lovecraftian horror should be able to thrive in the medium yet all we seem to get is edgy shock-horror shows like Elfen Lied. It's pretty unfortunate.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's just the culture aspect of Japan, Sadako(girl in the white gown and dirty black hair covering her face)-type horrors are supposed to be scary.

I wouldn't call it horror. There's gore but I don't think it qualifies.

This is what I've been wondering from the moment they've announced it. Bet it'll be censored though, which might be funny in it's own way.

If they have to censor middle fingers, I really doubt it is remotely possible to animate dick hand.

[Synopsis:](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22535/Kiseijuu)

>Parasyte centers around a 17-year-old teen named Shinichi Izumi, who lives with his mother and father in a quiet neighborhood in Tokyo. One night, worm-like aliens called Parasites invade Earth, taking over the brains of human hosts by entering through their ears or noses. One Parasite attempts to crawl into Shinichi's ear while he sleeps, but fails as Shinichi is wearing headphones, and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead. In the Japanese version, it takes over his right hand and is named Migi (?), after the Japanese word for 'right'; Tokyopop's version, in which the images are flipped horizontally, has the Parasite take over Shinichi's left hand and it is named Lefty.

>Because Shinichi was able to prevent Migi from travelling further up into his brain, both beings retain their separate intellect and personality. As the duo encounter other Parasites, they capitalize on their strange situation and gradually form a strong bond, working together to survive. This gives them an edge in battling other Parasites who frequently attack the pair upon realization that Shinichi's human brain is still intact. Shinichi feels compelled to fight other Parasites, who devour humans as food, while enlisting Migi's help.
>> ARTICLE
Wait.. migi is a left hand now??!
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, just in the old manga release by Tokyopop, where they mirrored the whole thing (like in most older manga in America). 
The anime will of-course follow the original manga. 

Note: The newer english release/s of Parasyte by Del Rey and later Kodansha Comics are printed like the original, right-to-left.
>> ARTICLE
Makes a little more sense, "migi" means "right".
>> ARTICLE
Sounds interesting to say the least. Guess ill add it to the list :)
>> ARTICLE
> One night, worm-like aliens called Parasites invade Earth, taking over the brains of human hosts by entering through their ears

...so they're Yeerks?
>> ARTICLE
Except without any of the weaknesses, and all of them have something way more fucked up than animorph powers.  Also, they don't control the host's brain, they just eat it.  There's no hope of salvation for their victims.
>> ARTICLE
Let's just pray it doesn't have tokyo ghoul levels of censorship
>> ARTICLE
It won't. Its airing on NTV which is own for having low quantities of censorship as shown with Lupin the 3rd: Fujiko no mine and Hunter x Hunter.

Some scenes in Parasyte may been toned down or outright removed like Attack on Titan but don't expect black bars or blinding flashes of light here. 
>> ARTICLE
MADHOUSE, imo, has a good track record w/ horror, especially the more subtle kind. (They did most, if not all, of Satoshi Kon's films, although they were all movies, save Paranoia Agent) I wouldn't really know what Parasyte leans more to, since I know almost nothing about it, but it's probably going to be lightly censored if not at all. In HxH, there were some pretty graphic parts censored and then some others uncensored. I marathoned, but I think they let up on the censorship later in the series, and the censorship wasn't even that jarring IIRC. ALso, it's not first-hand, but they also did Shigurui, which I've heard is pretty fucking brutal.

TL;DR: It won't be inverted colors.
>> ARTICLE
I think they'll use the FMA Brotherhoo approach where they show someones head getting ripped off but just censor all the bone and flesh so the stump would be just a red ring of blood 
>> ARTICLE
Never heard of Shigurui, but I just looked it up and its perfect for me. Thanks for the off-hand recommendation
>> ARTICLE
You're welcome.
>> ARTICLE
I pretty much always trust in Madhouse 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not worried about inverted colours, I'm worried about black bars that block up the entire screen or angelic beams of light from out of nowhere. That said the points you mentioned does make me relax a bit
>> ARTICLE
You never see those in HxH, so I doubt we'll see them in this.  
>> ARTICLE
'FUCK' status: 'YEAH'
 
Not sure if I'm going to like Shinichi's redesign, but I'm guessing they'll have him [wear contacts/gain perfect vision](/spoiler) - in addition to the [hairstyle change](/spoiler) when he [partially merges with Migi (ripping off Spiderman, much?)](/spoiler). Might work out as a better visual for his [altered psychology](/spoiler) Not that it's bad as it is, but I'm gonna be hella pissed if they don't [change his hair; That image change](/spoiler) was a big part of his character development.

My biggest hangup about it is the cast. HanaKana is gratingly overused - her voice is the most banal sound in existence to a lot of anime regulars - and Aya Hirano is being cast as Migi, who'd I'd always imagined having a masculine, if not genderless voice. Hirano has a really distinctive voice.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's a pretty odd choice for Migi. I'm still psyched for the show so I guess I'll just hope that he doesn't end up sounding like Haruhi.
>> ARTICLE
cant wait, loved the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Amusing factlet: The company that would eventually become Tokyo Pop started 17 years ago by publishing this manga. Also licensed at the same time: Sailor Moon, which is now being reanimated.

So when will the remake of Magic Knight Rayearth be announced?
>> ARTICLE
I remember my sister having a magazine with this and Sailor Moon in it when I was a kid. This manga freaked me out something fierce as a kid. Pretty excited to see this.

Don't you dare get me hyped up for that. I'll never forgive you.

Fuck, this looks weird.  Can't wait!!

Fall season looking great so far!

I take back all my doubts about character designs not looking like the manga. This looks awesome. Looks like it will preserve the same level of creepiness from the manga. To say I'm excited is an understatement!

It is a good thing I choose this anime for what to watch list.
>> ARTICLE
Its' been so long since I've read the manga that I don't mind any of the character design updates, hell I only really have a vague idea of what the later bits of plot were, I'm kind of glad about that too because even if this doesn't stay super close to the manga it still looks really fucking good.
>> ARTICLE
Holy Shit, I got goosebumps from that.

I've heard nothing but good things about the manga and I'm so excited to watch this.
>> ARTICLE
That's looks good ! Can't wait :)

Looks good.

This looks fucking weird.

I'm interested in it though.  from what I've read about it and from how it looks, it seems like a really unique story.
>> ARTICLE
I used to read this when I was 10, so I'm pretty excited to see this being turned into an anime!
>> ARTICLE
The last time I saw something with this kind of atmosphere and seemingly horror like genre I was really excited to being watching it. But then I started watching Tokyo Ghoul.

Can I ask manga readers how the pace compare to Monster? because that will tell me how long the series can be.

I didn't realize that a dub had been anounced yet. Well, I'm curious to see how Shinichi and Migi sound.
>> ARTICLE
The dub just got announced only about 15 minutes ago actually.
>> ARTICLE
[Here's](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-03-06/sentai-filmworks-licenses-parasyte-the-maxim-anime/.85690) the article on it, they just announced it today.
>> ARTICLE
Damn...Sentai better put out a premium set for it.
>> ARTICLE
Since when is Parasyte a horror series? I always thought it was a slightly darker shounen, but it's never been a series I thought to be even remotely classified as "horror".
>> ARTICLE
It's just the way they advertise things in the US. Sell something for what it isn't and hope it has already hooked the viewers by the time they realize it.
>> ARTICLE
> "horror"

Yeah... that really doesnt seem to fit to me
>> ARTICLE
It is definitely a horror series.

Also it is 100% seinen.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Seinen is directed more towards an older audience.

It often includes more mature themes, as well as more complex interpersonal relationships. They also tend to be more based around words than in shounen. 

For further example, in shounen, you wouldn't see [Parasyte spoilers](/s "People having sex like was shown in the most recent episode")
>> ARTICLE
Is it, though? It's not particularly scary, at least not to me, and the battles are pretty shounen oriented, with explanations of how people are doing attacks in the middle of the action. 

I suppose it's kinda bloody, but I never thought once that it was a horror series. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, by definition, the horror genre is suppose to touch on a human beings fear of the unknown and hidden fears, and the like. Parasyte being about aliens which take over human bodies and then eat other humans makes it fit into it pretty well (unless you aren't afraid of aliens which eat you 0_0).

As I can see that you may feel that it's not "all that" horror-y because of many of the most recent episodes seeming kind of battle-shonen like, I at least still totally consider it horror simple because of what the show represents.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the show represents some dark themes, the "horror" exists in the nature of human beings. However, I still stand by the more modern definition here. What Parasyte represents is scary, yeah, but I don't think it executes any of its ideas well enough that I would feel truly shocked by them. Check out "Now and Then, Here and There", which touches on similar themes to Parasyte and has significantly better execution. It's a show that manages to be scary because what you're seeing is truly fucked up. And Parasyte, to me, just does not meet the standard that should represent "horror". 
>> ARTICLE
Well, like someone else said before, maybe you've just become desensitized to it. You've probably watched plenty of other shows and at this point in Parasyte, you've already seen all sorts of stuff.

Although to you, it may be like "ye, whatever", to someone who knows nothing about the show sees a person's face unravel and eat another person's entire head would probably freak out a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure that you're partially right. The violence being displayed can be, at times, deeply unsettling. I've seen enough shows with that much, if not more, violence that I've become desensitized. 

However, I'm still going to stick with my original opinion. I don't think Parsyte should be considered horror for bodily violence alone. Perhaps dark shounen, or dark action shounen, but horror should constitute a situation that feels hopeless or gives off an unsettling air. And Parasyte lacks the emotional depth needed for this. Sure, I like and cheer for Shinichi and, to an extent, Migi, but many of the other characters act in ways that either make me dislike them or yell at them for obviously stupid decisions. And this makes me really only care about Shinichi when watching the more brutal scenes. 

So am I desensitized? I'm sure I am, to an extent, but I still say that Parasyte's execution is lackluster, and lacks the emotional weight I look for in these kinds of shows. The blood and killing feels shallow when the people being killed are CG extras or side characters, and I stand by my opinion that Parasyte could have done an array of small things to make me feel the impact of the scenes more; to make me feel scared not just for myself, but for the characters. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, there's definitely influence of a specific type of horror; body horror. Think classic films like The Thing, Hellraiser, Alien, etc. 
>> ARTICLE
This is actually an interesting comparison. You're right, the body horror in Parasyte can actually be somewhat disturbing, but I still think The Thing has more going for it because it had a monster we knew nothing about that we had no chance of stopping. It also didn't have shounen battles, so there's that. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh absolutely; there's no question The Thing is a much deeper work, but you'd be hard pressed not to see where some of  Parasyte's more unsettling imagery comes from in terms of films of its ilk.
>> ARTICLE
I actually remember Migi's dream form and thinking "man that is a really creative monster design", then realizing that Migi is literally an alien disguised as a human arm. Pretty freaky to think about. 
>> ARTICLE
Its not necessarily horror, however it is definitely seinen. 
>> ARTICLE
On Wikipedia, Paranoia Agent also has a "horror" classification, which it definitely shouldn't.
>> ARTICLE
From what I've seen anything that's labeled as horror just means dark, not really "scary"

Though I'd love for someone to prove me otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I could see it being labelled dark. Horror, however, indicates that I am watching what I'm watching in order to be scared. I have never really been scared during the entirety of Parasyte, though that's just me.
>> ARTICLE
Well... I like to get in to the main characters shoes and there has been like 6 times.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Parasyte desensitizes you to the gore pretty quickly "Oh that person's head unwrapped itself and ate someone else's head? Really sucks to be that guy." 
>> ARTICLE
This makes Parasyte look like some kind of horror lol
>> ARTICLE
Sure, technically its classified as a horror, but why would you try to market it as one when thats clearly not the theme of the show.
>> ARTICLE
That trailer does  poor job at showing how the show is. In my opinion Parsyte isn't really a horror. It may be in the classed in the horror genre, but it's more gore than actual horror.
>> ARTICLE
This really looked like a show aniplex would get. In one way its good because I might actually be able to afford it, but with sentai you never know if the dub will actually be good or not.
>> ARTICLE
No fucking way, it got licensed? Sure it's Sentai and I expect nothing good of the dub, but the fact that I can physically own it makes up for that.  You may sometimes piss me off Sentai, but thank you.

And it will be region locked ;__;

Here's hoping they have a good limited edition release at least!

where does it say they got a dub?

Ummmm, the language in the background was English (at least for the most part). Plus it says Sentai, which means they liscensed it and they do dubbing

Does the anime follow the manga? I've never read or seen either but this looks interesting.

yes, it does completely. and studio madhouse adapted the anime BEAUTIFULLY! and they have no censorship in it.... one of the best animes. also they OST for parasyte is one ofthe best also. please for the love of god pick it up.

Oh so Sentai have it. Well, this should be interesting.

Is that a good or bad thing?

Well Sentai are usually a lot more... adventurous, than Funimation in their dubs. This could either turn out really good, or really really bad.

is this any good I have been trying to avoid spoiler waiting for the dub so can anyone try and sum this up with no spoiler...
thanks...

A sad day that Sentai has this series...

Hopefully the English dub isn't shit and they put out a premium edition version. Might buy it depending on how it ends, and if it has some good extras.

I tend to have different taste from most of this subreddit, so a lot of my favorites end up forgotten immediately.  No one talks about how heartwrenching Majimoji Rurumo was in the cat and wolf episodes, or how Ichika was the most fashionable girl ever in Onee-chan ga Kita.  I barely see anyone ever discuss Nobunaga Concerto and how it masterfully managed the transitions between drama and humor, or Nobunagun and its delightful strategian of a main character synergizing everyone's superpowers.  And on the ecchi scale of things, everyone ignored how Yuushibu highlighted the challenges of college graduates in a changing job market, or how Imocho's sibling relationship was a lot better and more respectful than families in most ordinary shows (with the large exception of Hiyori existing).  Inari Konkon was a good show, and I enjoyed how they resolved their problems with communication.  And I don't think anyone even watched Magic Kaito 1412 in this subreddit, judging by the discussions, even though it had the best couple.

Fortunately, everyone remembers Strike the Blood and how masterfully it sculpted stupidity into a work of art.  As for everything above, I highly recommend all of them, they're hidden gems that are much better than they seem to be from their descriptions or first glance.
>> ARTICLE
Truth is, there are too many shows out there. You need to filter somehow. I fall into this trap a lot myself - if something doesn't seem hyped enough, or isn't something that I might be into, I usually don't watch it. 

As a result, I keep watching the same repackaged stuff over and over. Different names, same characters. Different plot, same story. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I try a ton of shows each season to avoid this problem, and then cut down anything that seems too familiar or generic.  I've had some success with finding the shows on the upcoming season's anichart list and finding descriptions that appear deliberately misleading or vague.  Yuki Yuna was a good example.

Or you can go around hunting for recommendations.  Denpa Teki na Kanojo was something that I found rather serendipitously, and I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
I really never hear about Denpa Teki na Kanojo. I think because it was released as an OVA that people just kind of skipped over it. Doubled by the fact of the relatively few number of episodes. 

Also thriller horror isn't that mainstream. Except for like Another.
>> ARTICLE
Really don't see how parasyte is a prime example of this. It's currently on of the top anime on MAL. 

And a lot of people had it as their AOTY/AOTS
>> ARTICLE
The vast majority of anime will be quickly forgotten. Look back at 2006 (which was the year with the most anime series) and you'll most likely only name a dozen of them although more series will be remembered from now on since anime is getting more and more popular.
>> ARTICLE
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2006_anime_television_series

Black Lagoon, Code Geass, Death Note, Gin Tama, Haruhi Suzumiya, Higurashi When They Cry, Kanon '06, Pokmon Chronicles and School Rumble. I don't remember seeing anything else from that list.

Hey, several of those are *still* in my top favourite anime of all time! Cool!
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, 2006 was an exceptional year for anime.
>> ARTICLE
Amagi Brilliant Park maybe? It was popular while it aired, but nobody is talking about it anymore.

>> ARTICLE
Maybe they need to LOOK AT THE SKY
>> ARTICLE
I dropped it halfway through, was it even good? 
>> ARTICLE
I think its the most mature KyoAni show since FMP:TSR and was pretty solid.
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm...Not really, i guess? There was quite a bit of potential there, but they really failed to expand on the characters in any meaningful way. To be honest i really only completed it because there weren't many other shows airing at the time. The ending was sorta predictable and didn't really do anything unexpected in terms of plot. I also found it kinda hard to connect to any of the characters enough to care. Kanie was clever and i like that in main characters, but it wasn't really enough to keep the show going. Overall, I guess it just lacked momentum and appeal (for me anyway).
>> ARTICLE
I liked it
>> ARTICLE
You didn't enjoy parasyte? I was hyped for it for every single episode and I loved each and every one of them.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people didn't like it actually. I felt it peaked around 7 then went downhill.
>> ARTICLE
what is this shit taste? The final episodes are amazing. Episode 12 is phenomenal as well. Mannn r anime always amazes me. 
>> ARTICLE
For people like you who just like mindless action, I'm sure it was very enjoyable. For people who like anime with actual decently explored themes and well done conclusions, the last half was full of bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm lets see my favorite show is Monster (basically no action) although I will say i do enjoy shounen/action shows and Parasyte had good action sequences but that's far from what makes it enjoyable. Sure it had its problems but overall it was a great show. for your "decently explored themes" hmm well: man vs nature, evolution, protecting ones kindred, what makes someone human, death, survival of the fittest, relationships and love. But nah its not 'deep' enough for u. I'll further explain what makes this show great - aside from the awesome cinematography, high quality animations/drawings and amazing sound track. It is also a great story with tons of emotion, a great mc, (not so great female mc - but she makes up for a lot of it on the final episode) the suspense is also really well done. Its heart-wrenching yet distant and at the same time it hits close to home for its viewers. The comedy was appropriate and funny. Interesting villains/characters and overall a very entertaining show. In comparison to everything that came out at that time it was a diamond in a stack of coal. Anyhow thats my opinion and i respect your opinion to disagree but to completely cll a good show shit and cll fans of those shows mindless bigots well... ur shit taste is confirmed.

I have no real problem with what you said (despite liking the show) but can we please stop using 'autistic' as an insult. 
>> ARTICLE
well of course opinions are subjective, so i wont argue that. 1. name one show that is perfect without any problems? 2. The final episodes revolve around whether it is right to interfere with nature to protect your loved ones or should you let evolution take its course. 3. Mother son relationship, father son, dealing with grief all these relationships were present in the show not just the romantic aspect. 4. in comparison to a lot of shows the quality was very present -  they skipped out frames where appropriate without deterring from the show, the studio that did it (the name is escaping me atm is considered a very good studio) 5. sound track is subjective, but it wasnt just dubstep; ur in denial if u think this song sucks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zi5la1JZHw (also fit the theme so well at the end of every episode)
6.MC was cliche but it worked with the story really well. had actual development throughout the entire story in a unique fashion which was simply uncovering who he was all along. 7. I'll give u this point but its not enough to say the entire show sucks. The rest are subjective so to each their own. All those shows were great ur right. but there was also a bunch of bad shows that were produced and listing the only good ones is quite biased. Anyhow imo the show is unique highly praised and it deserves a lot of the praise it gets. I do respect ur opinion. However, u dont seem to respect others; 'mindless fags' is the reason I added the shit taste confirmed.

[Nananana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21561/Ryuugajou_Nanana_no_Maizoukin_%28TV%29), I am surprised that I still remember this anime, but it will probably never be mentioned again.

Ah yes, old lightbulb necklace.
>> ARTICLE
~~Show~~ Concept was good, Pacing was shit. 

Ded anime probably. 
>> ARTICLE
That show was carried entirely by Tensai.  As such, we should remember her and forget the anime.
>> ARTICLE
It got forgotten because it was so rushed and the last episode was so bland.  It's like they planned for it to be 2-cour but then went "SHIT!  This episode that was supposed to set up the 2nd arc is now going to be our season finale!"

They were still introducing new characters at like episode 9 and last episode was such an awful cliffhanger, something must have gotten fucked up during the production.  The treasure rooms and the treasures themselves were such cool concepts, too bad it ended so early.
>> ARTICLE
I think that one got forgotten *while* it was airing.

It's a shame, too, because I thought the premise had a lot of potential. Too bad they fucked it up so bad.
>> ARTICLE
lol that might be true.

May it rest deep down in the ocean of forgotten anime forever.
>> ARTICLE
I feel Akatsuki no Yona could use more hype, out of 30 anime i watched it was the only anime i watched on Tuesdays last season, and was one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Yona was the first reverse harem I really liked.  Everyone was too busy accomplishing things and solving problems to do stereotypical romance stuff, so I ended up respecting everyone.  It was a nice change.  I'd love for a season 2 to come out.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even realise it was a reverse harem until I finished watching it. I mean, nobody can compete with Haku X Yona man
>> ARTICLE
I'm rather fond of Yun myself.  While Yona is in charge of everyone's motivations, Yun is the one who makes sure everything actually works.
>> ARTICLE
I think Yona was actually a case of people *remembering* an anime after it finished airing. It's like everyone (myself included) simultaneously decided to check it out after it ended and went, "Hey, this is pretty good."

While it was airing, though, it wasn't talked about much at all.
>> ARTICLE
rolling girls
>> ARTICLE
Remember Haganai?  I never see that show mentioned around here, and it was good.

Now, the direction the LNs and the story went after season 2 is a perfect example of lazy writing, unexplained character development, and an author who got bored of the couple hinted and carefully developed throughout the first 8 novels, the domain of the anime [spoilers] ( /s "Kodaka and Sena.  He confessed, then inexplicably forgot she existed and made some lame excuse about a top secret attraction to Yukimura, which didnt even make sense lazy writing pls, then he violated the his own character and randomly decided he was in love with Rika, compromising their beautiful friendship formed after she beat him up.  It's a hot mess right now with no coherent plot or explicable character motives in sight.")

So it might be for the best everyone forgot the show.

edit: forgot to quote my spoiler tag
>> ARTICLE
After i finished season 2 i read the light novels, and dear god it was horrible where they went after the ending of season 2. Now im kinda glad there is no season 3.
>> ARTICLE
Two years ago, when I started to follow currently airing anime regularly, I really enjoyed this show called [Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18893/Aoki_Hagane_no_Arpeggio:_Ars_Nova). 

It had a really unique premise (world threatened by sentient warships), but it is scarcely mentioned anywhere where people are talking about anime. Shame really, I liked the show and I will probably get around to watching the movie sequels sometime soon.  

But lots of things quickly become forgotten. Video games, books, TV shows, to name a few. I wish Japanese animation studios would just simply slow down with the content (honestly, I think 50 shows per year is enough, given the huge back catalog that can always be monetized). 
>> ARTICLE
I am still following the manga of this. It's a much better series than Kancolle. Takao is best girl.

>> ARTICLE
I do and I think it was better than quite a few of the well remembered ones. I didn't even watch anime when it aired, but watched it some years later after stumbling upon it.
>> ARTICLE
I did too. It was one of my first anime.
>> ARTICLE
Gatchaman CROWDS, I thought it was pretty good but I don't see anyone talking about it really even though the sequel to it's coming out this summer.
>> ARTICLE
It's the painfully generic ones that are most quickly forgotten. Only four months have gone by since Fall 2014 finished, and you don't see all that many mentions of Trinity Seven or Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai or Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete these days. They're not even brought up in the "Holy Fuck But This Is A Shitty Anime" threads that pop through three times a week, even though they are well-qualified in that regard.

Nope. The generics are the most easily forgotten, because it's pretty much guaranteed that another three or four will air in the next season. Most of us will only remember those generic anime titles that failed spectacularly, as it's very rare that a generic anime does amazingly well.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say Trinity Seven still gets some mention. I mean, it's mostly in threads where people are asking about harem series (specifically MC's), but that's a lot more than other series.
>> ARTICLE
Ushinawareta was entertaining.  It was [spoilers](/s "a giant timeloop dedicated to working up the courage for a friendzoning").  I have to respect that.
>> ARTICLE
Trinity Seven was pretty entertaining, but yeah, you are right, it's a show I've seen before, just repackaged for Fall 2014. 

I would say that it's the middling, generic anime that gets most easily forgotten. They had their entertainment value when they aired, but they were insufficiently bad or good enough to be memorable years later. At least not in "Mars of Destruction" fashion. 
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte quickly forgotten?? Really? 

SAO II is a good example. The hype about GGO and Mother Rosario arc was real, all fan base saying how good those arcs were going to be....meh. I think I enjoyed more Alfheim arc to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
I believe people got disappointed by GGO, didn't get excited by Excalibur (which was mainly its function) and didn't give Mother Rosario a chance (of getting to know Yukki and caring for her).
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, Parasyte does drag a little at the half way point or so. And I can see why people might get a little burnt out of they're expecting a 'guaranteed anime of the year'. Just watch it because you enjoy it, not because there's a massive pressure for you to.

Also, I don't think it's fair to say anime are just instantly forgotten. Maybe they don't have many conversations after a show is finished, but that could simply be because a show is not all that controversial and worth bringing up after it has aired unless it's a nostalgia thread. Also, there are too many new shows each season to keep the hype train for older shows going indefinitely. 
>> ARTICLE
The concept of Parasyte is unique, but its just not very ambitious.
>> ARTICLE
Don't see much talk about the kancolle eanime anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Good.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed the heck out of Sabagebu, and it seemed like quite a few others enjoyed it as well, but after it finished it must have dropped off the face of the earth, since I haven't heard anyone say anything about it once .
>> ARTICLE
Sabagebu is funnier in the moment, not really so much for talking about, since it relies on a lot of physical gags.  But it was a remarkably fun show.
>> ARTICLE
I also loved Sabagebu! There are dozens of us! Dozens!
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte? Forgotten? You must be joking.

My answer for this one is probably One Week Friends, I've hardly seen any mentions of it since it finished airing.
>> ARTICLE
No way it got forgotten, people are still going crazy over it and saying it's the best anime that aired last year.

If you got up to episode 7 then you've basically reached the peak of the series. There's not much else after that unless you're willing to lower your expectations by a lot.

And to answer your question, Nagi no Asukara.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, Nagi no Asukara was a pretty good show - good enough to be remembered for the long term, I think. Or for the next 5 years at minimum. 
>> ARTICLE
I still see mentions of Nagi no Asukara every so often though.


>> ARTICLE
Definitely not as often as Parasyte
>> ARTICLE
Maybe its just me for not seeing it but I feel that [Uchouten Kazoku] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/17909/Uchouten_Kazoku) got forgotten pretty fast. It might be because the studio that did it, P.A. Works, also did Nagi no Asukara right after (which gets talked about a lot), followed by Glasslip (which gets a lot of flack but still talked about), and Shirobako. I still consider it the best P.A. Works show I have watched, and I have watched all the shows (not movies) they have made.
>> ARTICLE
The first 12 episodes were on point for me when it comes to parasyte but after that it started going down hill
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Log Horizon had a great first season. Everyone was expecting for the second one, saw the first episode and the hype disappeared. It got forgotten before it even ended.
>> ARTICLE
And Terraformars. No matter where I went, everyone was hyped about it. Now, it's just forgotten.

You mustn't internet much if you haven't seen KLK around for a few months...

the movie looks cool.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HG6qtKBW7Y
>> ARTICLE
The answer might be a obvious but does the trailer or whatever that link is spoil anything that hasn't happened in the anime yet? I've had my fair share of spoilers and I want to finish Parasyte without knowin hoe things turnout.
>> ARTICLE
Short answer is, yes.

There are scenes that you haven't seen in anime yet. And if people start referring this movie as "faithful", you are bound to expect scenes you see in trailer to happen in future anime episodes.

>> ARTICLE
There are at least one or two things in there that haven't happened in the anime. I don't know if they are differences between the two, or even significant spoilers at all, but I would recommend holding off watching it.
>> ARTICLE
It seems surprisingly faithful to the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't look it will be imo. They got scenes from near the end with the murder of the politician. Can't see how they can compress like 50~60 chapters into a 2hr movie.
>> ARTICLE
My biggest question is how well are they going to compress the plot because I'm seeing scenes from ch.50ish
>> ARTICLE
Probably scenes from the second movie because they split it up in 2 movies.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, unlike a lot of their live action anime adatptions it looks legit as fuck. Also seems to have a pretty decent budget behind it which is nice.

Migi looks exactly like he does in the anime which is a plus

Original Japanese:

>1129 1126stage:8stage:9

Kinda Google Translate:

>November 29 (Saturday) to celebrate the release of the film "Parasyte", Japan TV will broadcast on November 26 (water), episode: 8 and episode: 9,  will be a double feature.

Looks like they announced it a week ago, I hope CR gets the double feature also. 
>> ARTICLE
They probably will, no reason to miss out on the episodes. When Naruto has double episodes, crunchyroll has double episodes too if that says anything
>> ARTICLE
I mean they licensed the show so they will. I don't know if you watch yuuki is a hero or something like that but when it came out CR posted episode 1 and 2 since it came out the same day 
>> ARTICLE
> November 26 (water)

Google translate being accurate as usual.

Thanks for the translation though, I know it doesn't take very long but I have to admit that I'm often too lazy to even spend a minute on it.


Also, what's that parasyte movie they are talking about?
>> ARTICLE
Live-action movie. To commemorate its theatrical opening, they're just airing episode 8 and 9 on the same day as one big episode.
>> ARTICLE
> November 26 (water)

It's not wrong. That is the character for water.  Google translate can't pick up the nuance of its usage from a single character.

The days of the week in Japanese are named after elements or the planets which are named after the elements.  Wednesday is literally "water day" or "Mercury day" (since Mercury is "water star" in Japanese and Chinese).

Looking at the wiki page, apparently it's the same in English.  "Wednesday" comes from the Old English Wodnesdaeg, or Woden's day.  Woden is the Germanic god that the Romans believed to also be Mercury.  In Latin, Wednesday is "dies Mercurii", or day of Mercury.

source: http://www.cjvlang.com/Dow/dowjpn.html

Edit: I'm actually surprised that it picked up on "Saturday" since that's just the character for earth (as in dirt or ground, not the planet), which is related to the planet Saturn, or "earth star".  "Saturday" is also obviously named after the Roman god Saturn.
>> ARTICLE
All you had to say is it's the equivalent of 'Wed' for 'Wednesday'.

If you put 'Wed' into Google Translate of course it'll take it as the verb to wed.

im calling it, grisaia for best anime this fall!
>> ARTICLE
And I would llike to challenge that claim with Nanatsu no Daizai as this seasons best shounen anime. If A-1 animates the fights as well as they did SAO, we are looking at a seriously strong contender against the "big 3" mark my words. This series needs more hype!
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't be that optimistic, the VN might be really good, but the adaption could be as bad as DEEN's fate/stay night.
>> ARTICLE
i know, but the common route was really good too, if they dont screw up that part ill be at least a bit satisfied
>> ARTICLE
The least we can hope for is some decent PLOT.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is, Fate/Stay Night wasn't just bad because DEEN messed it up by being over-the-top with it. It's also because the Fate route which they focused on the most is pretty bad. UBW and HF are the real meat of the game. Grisaia on the other hand will likely either just be the common route or common + Yumiko, both of which are fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
It will be Yumiko's route will it? I thought it might have been Amane's but that would be difficult to adapt.

There's actually a good chance it might be Amane's route seeing how a certain silver haired girl is in the promo art.

I'd appreciate the help! :)

Most of the sequels should be marked by a _____ 2. WIXOSS is the only one I can think of that is an exception. Most things will be completely new.

Ai Tenchi Muyo is a reboot.

The point here was to give access to MAL page of shows organized per day of availability can Hummingbird do that?

[ANI](http://beta.anichart.net/fall) at least gives info about the show and you can organize them by next airing date.

Still not exactly telling you which day what will be... but already better...

How did that beat Ping Pong?!
>> ARTICLE
Because these weren't official vote polls pretty much. Nobody cared since there was like 70 different polls, and this was just one of them. People jsut got tired of voting. 

Although that being said, I did think it was better than ping pong. 
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't make much sense that Meruem won best character development and not best villain. Well, I guess everyone has their own definition of villain (?)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Tatsuya also wasn't the best or best main male character, imo, but I bet he won because /r/OneTrueTatsuya. He was amazing, but not the best.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't even say amazing... ^()^()^()^()^()^()^()^()^(have mercy)
>> ARTICLE
I found him amazing overall, but I recognize he's not the best character and he seems barely three-dimensional.^lol Also, the reason I find him amazing is more for his OPness and actions rather than him being an amazing character, per se. Peco, Smile, Dandy, Joseph Joestar, and Handa-sensei are examples of amazing characters; Tatsuya is not.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but It's Old Joseph. Not the young one.
>> ARTICLE
Isshuukan beat Ping Pong because many more people watched the former than the latter. You can't really expect people to vote for something they haven't seen no matter how loud the *"but it's really, really good!"* voices may be.

Sure, had these awards been done by committee I would fully expect Ping Pong to breeze to victory, but they weren't done that way, they were done by popular vote. Isshuukan winning a popularity contest is fine by me, and it is certainly a hell of a lot better than Mahouka winning the award.

I certainly know that these votes are by popularity, like any vote on /r/anime.  
Still sad though.

Meh, it is how it is.

Ping Pong actually came in third, behind Isshuukan Friends and No Game No Life. I think people saw Isshuukan Friends and thought 'Well, NGNL/Ping Pong is my favorite here, but I also liked Isshuukan Friends and I don't think it's going to get many votes...'
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Ishhuukan Friends is my favourite here, slightly beating Ping Pong.

i am amazed and vindicated by this result!  i loved isshukan friends; i liked NGNL and i was moderately ambivalent toward ping pong... yet here we are.  SUCK IT /R/ANIME

Unless the selection of Tatsuya was meant as a satirical jab at the homogenization of the male MC that particular award seems like a clear example of ballot stuffing.

Other than that the rest of results are, more in less, in line with what you might expect from /r/anime. 

Good job on handling these awards, OP, it may have taken longer  to complete than it takes Goku to go super saiyan but all in all I'd say this was pretty successful. Do you plan to do it again next year?  
>> ARTICLE
See, this is why i think only people who have seen both anime can vote for them as this is to compare those anime, no point if people just go with the one they have seen and ignore the other.
>> ARTICLE
As of right now, yes. I'm definitely looking for advice on how to make it shorter though, it dragged on way longer than it needed to in my opinion, but I don't know how I would have made it shorter other than cutting down the number of awards. Any ideas?
>> ARTICLE
Best Abs was a nice idea, but ended up being a joke in the end. It was meant to be a way for people to show their appreciation for male characters in the same way they were appreciating female characters in Best Boobs, but Mikasa Ackerman still made top 3. If male characters can't have an award like that all to themselves the way female characters get Best Boobs, I don't think either should be included. Maybe you could do Most Attractive Male and Most Attractive Female awards instead, but that entire concept is the easiest to jettison if you're looking to cut down.

I don't think there needed to be an award for best fight scene, funniest moment, or best first and last episodes. It's a lot harder to remember that kind of stuff than it is to remember what you felt about an entire series. I remember seeing the voting threads for those and going "well okay guess I can't participate tonight."

As has been mentioned, OP/ED and OP/ED Song don't need to be separate. People like me who don't watch OPs/EDs but listen to the song will just vote for the song in the OP/ED thread, and people who watch the OP/ED will vote for song + visuals. I honestly had no idea there was a separate thread exclusively for the songs.

As has also been mentioned, I don't think each genre needs its own award. I remember voting on some of them, but then not really caring about those results when the results were revealed.
>> ARTICLE
I'd disagree on the Best Fight Scene reasoning if no other reason than because the poll thread included video links.
>> ARTICLE
Fewer awards, for a start; no pointless stuff like 'best boobs', not much point in having separate awards for both OP/ED and *OP/ED song*, an award for every genre is unnecessary.

Voting periods were too long, most people are going to vote when they first see the thread and if you could somehow convince the mods to sticky 'X Award voting thread' onto the top of the sub for, say, 48 hours, that should be enough time for the majority of users to vote.

Finally, you didn't need a separate thread for every award. Should have just done it all in one, big, fancy, post. 
>> ARTICLE
>no pointless stuff like 'best boobs'

Pointless? HERESY! If /r/anime can't have one communal favorite pair of boobs to look back on and say "Yep, those were *the tits* of 2014", what can we have?
>> ARTICLE
> Fewer awards, for a start; no pointless stuff like 'best boobs', not much point in having separate awards for both OP/ED and OP/ED song, an award for every genre is unnecessary.

I agree on the difference between OP/ED and OP/ED songs. I didn't really think that through. As for best boobs, all of the categories were voted on by the community. Even if I just included the top 10, best boobs would have made it in. Not that I necessarily agree with the inclusion of it.

>You didn't need a separate thread for every award. Should have just done it all in one, big, fancy post.

With the detail I put into the threads, there would have to be multiple threads. I could definitely tone that down though, or just do that for the finals.
>> ARTICLE
About Best Boobs, if it were me I would have just ignored* the people calling for it. It's not like you *have* to listen to everyone's opinion, and I would wager that a decent portion of the people who voted to include Best Boobs were the same people who turned around and mocked the decision for cheap karma. 

Of course, it is a community event and so getting the /r/anime community involved is key, but as the man with the plan you shouldn't shy away from acting a little dictatorial when the going calls for it. 


edit- 'ignored' isn't right... more like, *politely explained* why Best Boobs would not be included in the /r/anime awards. 
>> ARTICLE
Another thing is that the best boobs thread was actually by far the most popular of the entire event. It had over 2000 upvotes, and the next poll thread had like 96. Idk.. we'll see for next year. I'm probably going to do the same thing to get people to submit their own categories then vote on those.

I would suggest that you choose 80 percent or so of the awards beforehand and then have a few community nominated awards.  That way you may be able to organize threads and scheduling in advance, take some burden off of yourself and allow the timeline for the awards to run quicker.

That's a good fight but not good enough to compete with Meruem vs Netero, in my opinion that's one of the best fights period, not just this year.
>> ARTICLE
>that's one of the best fights period, not just this year.

lol

Just watched that and I disagree completely. For one that fight was like half an hour, most of it being talking and monologues, so from the get go it falls into a lot of shounen bullshit. Secondly the animation wasnt exactly the best either, it wasnt bad dont get me wrong but it wasnt the best animation ever (Which it should be considering how you're saying its the best fight in all of anime.), Again can I bring up the monologue issue? Like seriously, atleast 20 minutes of that fight was monologue and the fight was 30 minutes thats fucking insane. 

I mean the fight wasnt bad, but if anything I would put it slightly below Naruto vs Sasuke (Naruto Part 1) and the main drawbacks from both of those fights were the constant monologues, the thing is the Naruto vs Sasuke fight had very great animation especially for the time, whereas the animation in HxH isnt exactly anything to speak of. And I know i'm just going to get downvoted for saying this as I do if I say anything that claims that HxH isnt THE BEST thing since sliced bread, but you're really overselling it by calling most things in it "The best in all of anime". This poll proved nothing as it was one giant popularity contest, and we saw that at its finest during the spring poll.
>> ARTICLE
Obviously if you only see the fight, it won't be as impactful. That's what makes it so great, that it actually has depth to it and it's not just eye candy. Maybe lancer vs archer could have won best animated fight, but best fight? Pls that was so shallow it hurt.
>> ARTICLE
I can see what you mean, whenever I think of best fight I usually go straight to animation rather than reasons behind it or such.
>> ARTICLE
Some important factors in a fight: The emotional/significance impact, the build-up, the importance and the development of the characters fighting along with animation and quality of the fight. The Hunter x Hunter fight excels in the areas of build up, character development and significance along with having some nice animation and quality (not the best in quality and animation). But the build up and significance of this fight if what puts it above the others. The shear hype for this fight along with its importance is what puts it over the edge as a fight that will live through the ages. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, build up and hype I will give it that over some of the other fights in 2014. 
>> ARTICLE
Completely disagree but I'll upvote for it being your opinion and you shouldn't be rained in downvotes cause of it.

The animation isn't even bad, far from it, to say Naruto did it better is a huge insult, not that Naruto was bad but that fight is almost ten years old, there's no way that animation is better.

As for the constant talking and inner monologues, Hunter x Hunter always has the monologues, it explains their strategies and thought process and I personally love them but I understand someone not. But for the tlaking, the fights circumstances were that Meruem had to defeat Netero without killing him so he tried a lot to talk Netero into surrendering, it was absolutely necessary.

And finally, to clear things up, I didn't say it was the best, just one of them, I don't even know if I think that's the best fight in HxH. 
>> ARTICLE
> The animation isn't even bad, far from it, to say Naruto did it better is a huge insult, not that Naruto was bad but that fight is almost ten years old, there's no way that animation is better.

Age shouldnt be a factor in it, personally I think [this](http://youtu.be/1yF25q4OL_4?t=7m50s) has better animation than Mereum vs Netero. It might just be my preference to Studio Pierrot when they do fights like this, but it looks a lot more smoother and the choreography was also better IMO. Not to mention I think that the animation for that fight was ahead of its time, and was my favorite for quite awhile.

>As for the constant talking and inner monologues, Hunter x Hunter always has the monologues, it explains their strategies and thought process and I personally love them but I understand someone not.

I honestly wouldnt mind it too much if the monologue wasnt like 20 minutes throughout the entire fight. If it was a short fight I could forgive it very easily, I mean after all I like [Kiritsugu vs Kirei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSgXOZKSt20) from Fate/Zero quite a bit despite the monologue and strategies. I wouldnt place it in my top 10 fights because of animation and the monologue is indeed a bit of a problem, but it doesnt take up 20 minutes which is why its forgivable.

> But for the tlaking, the fights circumstances were that Meruem had to defeat Netero without killing him so he tried a lot to talk Netero into surrendering, it was absolutely necessary.

I think they could find some other ways around that, rather than having them talk for 20 minutes. And that still is no excuse for the battle itself having the monologue, it may make sense in context of the story but we're talking about the battle itself here.

>And finally, to clear things up, I didn't say it was the best, just one of them, I don't even know if I think that's the best fight in HxH.

Even then I disagree quite a bit, I wouldnt place it near one of the best as there are many many many fights that are leagues above that. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I realize the difference between us now. When we see Fight Scene, you focus on the Fight part while I focus on the Scene part.

While I agree as just a fight, Meruem vs Netero isn't amazing but it's all the components to it that are involved in the actual storyline and character development.  Both are valid ways of seeing it but for me personally, I care more about what the fight does for the anime and what it means as a whole and not if it looks awesome in an AMV (Best way I can thing of describing it at the moment)
>> ARTICLE
Meh, I guess so. I never really thought of fight scenes that way, but not to be super pedantic but the award was suppose to be "Best Fight/Battle". And if we go by how your outlook i'd still say Fate/Stay Night wins, but instead of Archer vs Lancer I would say Archer vs Caster as the entire point of that fight was to outline the similarities of Archer and Shirou while at the same time show their main difference. It becomes more apparent why thats extremely important in S2, but nonetheless its a very big piece of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Whether or not the Caster vs Archer fight's character dynamics are important in the second season or the quality of the animation/choreography, or even how it was done in the LN, that episode is probably where the writing hit its lowest point. Just as anime watcher, I thought that episode sucked for the most part.
>> ARTICLE
Why do you think it sucked?
>> ARTICLE
I decided to rewatch the Archer + Shirou bits of the episode to see if I still felt the same way and although it didn't annoy as much as it did before 
(maybe I was in a worse mood last time), it had all the problems I remember.

The interactions between Archer and Shirou just come off as irrational and melodramatic, more so given the dire circumstances they are in the time (being between a wounded Caster and nearby Assassin). What they were saying was little more than a bunch of trumped up psuedo-philosophy and I really struggled to grasp what if anything Shirou would have as a basis for the levels of resentment he felt towards Archer (and vice-versa). Everything about it just seemed really childish, both the characters and writer.

Barakamon is a quiet slice of life show, I liked the last episode but idk, I don't think it was any better than the rest of the series (which was fantastic). I'm surprised TG or Aldnoah didn't win.

well best male character and best male main character are basically the same, because usually the Mc is the one with the most fans, and Tatsuya is literally a god


>> ARTICLE
the circlejerk around him doesnt negate that he is a bad character though. But I guess thats the problem with these votings. It remains a popularity/prominence thing.
>> ARTICLE
I think you need to realize that "Tatsuya is a bad character", although a reasonable and justifiable stance, is simply your own subjective opinion, and the opinion contrary to yours, is also a reasonable and justifiable subjective opinion, all based on personal values and biases on what constitutes a "good character"

Polls such as these should always be treated as a popularity contest, or simply, a contest in which the prominent values and opinions would win, and we should not be thinking that our opinion is "correct" or "superior"
>> ARTICLE
Not all opinions are equal, and they sure as hell aren't all valid, even in art. Pretty sure if you talk to anyone who has a good understanding of tropes in anime will tell you the same thing about the character, and all good things I've heard about him have been from people who don't understand those tropes or haven't seen them before until now. 

I will happily concede to being wrong if you could point me in the direction of a well written character analysis of tatsuya that ends with the conclusion of him being a great character. This isn't a joke or anything, and I'm not trying to come off as an ass, I'm very serious. I've seen many posts detailing why someone absolutely loved a show that I didn't, and giving me a new appreciation for the show, so if the same can be done for this show, all the better. But good luck honestly finding a well thought out post on why mahouka and specifically tatsuya is a good character. 

I realize you aren't defending the character, I just needed to say that. I feel like a lot of people have this idea that everything is subjective and there is no right and wrong or whatever and I just don't agree. That's basically saying there are people out there who think that a character that showed up in one episode of gintama have as much character as Shinji ikari and its all an opinion. No, it fucking isn't. 
>> ARTICLE
i think you misunderstood the position i am taking, but since i have little intention in going into the finer philosophical details and technicalities in regards to "opinions", and i do believe we both do not want to turn this into a discussion on academics, i will simply reiterate my stance and see if you agree or disagree:

"there is no "objective standard" in which one evaluates anime characters, and every judgement of whether or not a character is "good" or "bad" is based on our own subjective interpretations and personal values and biases. therefore, since we cannot be truly "correct", we should have the attitude of being fair and tolerant towards different opinions, and understand their position by respecting the conclusion they made, engage in a conversation by discussing ideas and arguments instead of who is right or wrong, and ultimately embrace our differences"

i just think you have misunderstood me greatly, as my stance was never, nor did i claim, that "all opinions are equal" or that "everything is subjective", nor are the two even relevant to the position i am taking. although, if it was my mistake of being unclear, i apologize

the strength of an opinion lies with its reasoning and logic, not its conclusion, and there can be right or wrong when it comes to "objective values". however, my reply was to simply illustrate, albeit maybe poorly, that "Tatsuya is a bad character" is not an objective truth, but a subjective interpretation, and should be treated and discussed as such, hence whether or not a person agrees, should be based on the arguments presented, instead of treating it as a factual truth and shoving it down other people's throat. this attitude of superiority that strives towards a false understanding of "objectivity", is very unhealthy

hopefully this long-winded rant clears up any misunderstanding we might have
>> ARTICLE
Of course I agree with you there. Discussing ...anything really will always be subjective and if it`s about fiction or rather discussing how good certain aspects of said fiction are this is even more true. Sorry If I didnt made this fact clear enough in my original statement or behaved somewhat snobbish/ elitist.

On the other hand we`re nevertheless still spending our time here discussing these things and saying "all this is subjective anyways so why bother arguing about it" would just be boring and would make most of the discussion on here pointless.

With that in mind I`ll keep gladly defending my opinion against arguments that may br brought up by the other side or maybe be convinced by them who knows.

Oh and if you want explanation for this specific case (as to why *I* consider Tatsuya a bad character) I wrote something about that above although now that I look over it again it kind of resembles a rant and not a objective argument too so theres that.
>> ARTICLE
no no, i should apologize if you think i sound somewhat condescending, i just have a certain bias when it comes to the objectivity and subjectivity of opinions. 

i personally think that we should embrace our personal values and biases when discussing and analyzing anime, throw the obsession with objectivity out the window and let our subjectivity clash; we should be fair and tolerant when discussion opinions, and i find the attitude of striving for the inconsistent standards of objectivity, rather unhealthy 

if i misunderstood you, i'm sorry 

and i do not have any intention of disagreeing with your opinion that "Tatsuya is a bad character", it is a completely reasonable opinion, i was just being oddly sensitive about some words
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure I voted for tatsuya for the lolz, as did many people I'm sure. 
>> ARTICLE
what didnt you like about him?
>> ARTICLE
Well the fact that he is indeed invincible might be appealing for some but i personally think that it just makes for a really boring experience without any suspense.

Furthermore correct me if I just missed something but he was just a really plain and undefined so to say "self-insert" character who had no particular traits beside being an OP yet modest cool and serious yet sometimes edgy person with a (again in my opinion) implied incest relationship to his sister whos actually the said to be the second amazing person on the planet besides him. He seemes to be crafted after the "Kirito recipe of success" if you know what I mean and I personally just dont think that makes for a good character.

I think to sum up my opinion and to reverse your question: There just isnt anything to like about his character is there?
>> ARTICLE
well at the start of the series you dont know that hes op, at the start hes just a smart high school student that is not particularly good at magic

what i liked about his character is that even if hes smart, handsome, strong he was not born with all this characteristics [spoiler dont know if its completely covert in the anime ](/s "hes smart because when he was 6 yo they did a experiment on him and replaced a part of his brain") and the fact that he doesnt fall in love with other girls because hes unable to have strong emotions, at least they tried to explain it instead of having a dense MC just for the sake of it

i too am not a fan of incest but this for me is the most easy too swallow with the onii-sama saved my life and had a miserable childhood part, but i didnt watch too many animes with incest(monogatari and chaika where it wasnt actually incest) so maybe for others the incest part looks bad

i didnt see SAO so i dont know if tatsuya resembles kirito, but i liked tatsuya because of the backstory and made me read the manga to find more about it(planning to read the LN too when i have the chance)
>> ARTICLE
>well at the start of the series you dont know that hes op, at the start hes just a smart high school student that is not particularly good at magic

Explain the prologue where he blows up shit with his power armor and magic.

Even your spoiler serves as proof that Tatsuya *must* be a special goddamn snowflake - [he can't](/s "innanely use magic properly, so let's turn him into a superweapon with no emotions using a lobotomy while we're at it.")

Also, the LN says he's average-looking, so logically all the girls in the show swoon over him.

Well he is a special snowflake, hes from one of the 10 clans so the fact that magic is genetic and from hes clan was one of the most powerful mages. So because he was practically useles they experimented on him. 

I dont think i saw the prologue, i watched the series from crunchyroll so if the prologue is there then i saw it, i am  on mobile so i cant check

Well fair enough. Taste differs after all.

If there is one thing that these polls showed me is that more people really should watch Ping Pong the Animation.  I know people are probably sick of the people yelling and screaming about how Ping Pong is the best thing ever but I've run into more than a few people who refuse to watch it because 'its ugly' or 'I don't watch sports anime' and I feel sad because they are missing out on a legitimately a great series.

Also more people probably should watch Mushishi since it got no recognition here either but I'm equally guilty of that. 
>> ARTICLE
I've seen it. It's ok I guess.

I love character driven series and Ping Pong has fantastic characters and some of the best character development I've ever seen, its in my top 3 series.

The thing is that there was no elimination round. The wild cards were brought in before the finals and there was only two rounds.

If it's not too much work, maybe have 2 or 3 polls posted daily instead of the usual 1. Or you could make rounds of elimination before going into voting, or any other method that serves to reduce the final number of candidates for the award.

Isshuukan friends my ass

ping pong didn't get shit what the hell
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong came in second for Aoty. It also came in last place for 'best sports anime' which doesn't make sense to me.
>> ARTICLE
The animation is very key with the fluidity and quality along with the characters competing. The animation prob killed it though. I don't think kuroko should have one with the amount of abnoxious stills and how few good movement sequences there actually are, but I do think the animation is key.
>> ARTICLE
Well I think many consider its strong point to be character development and not really the ping pong(/sport) itself as youre probably aware. Last place does still not make much sense though.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, yes, we all know you all want Ping Pong in it.

But aside from that. Nagi no Asukara as best romance when other better options were there (Ao Haru Ride, Golden Time,...). It's discussable. I don't know either. Choosing for a True Romance over that whole thing in NagiAsu, maybe, maybe not.

Best ED Zankyou no Terror? That just won because people grouped it with the soundtrack, nothing else.

If I took a closer look at some other categories I could come up with more. But it looks like it became popular with a certain demography and only those paid attention to it. I didn't even realize this was going between all the other stuff there was.

Seeing Barakamon capitalizing some categories pleases me.

> The face we make when we see it wins the **Best Comedy Scene of 2014**.

I'm confused as to how Rin won best female character over Chiyo, but then lost best female main character to Chiyo. They're both main characters. Obviously I'd have liked Rin to win both because she's my one true love, but I'd also prefer Chiyo win both to what we got. This isn't really a complaint with the structure of the poll or the votes really... but it is odd, which you said to mention.
>> ARTICLE
They posted like 20 threads. People probably paid attention less in one of those threads.
>> ARTICLE
It depends on perspective, atleast for me.. example: I like Rin more as a character, she's more interesting and has a deeper story to her.

But being a main character has different criterias and I find Sakura to fill the main character role a lot better than Rin does.

That's my two cents on the matter atleast.
>> ARTICLE
I like One Week Friends as much as the next guy, but how did it end up over Ping Pong or NGNL (I didn't even like this, but I figured it was a shoe in)?

Edit:
>Best Scifi: Mahouka

Haha, god damn it
>> ARTICLE
Just a smaller sample in votes, NGNL won anime of the year in the bigger poll, so I don't think it would lose in its own season.
>> ARTICLE
> Haha, god damn it

I mean when you have Parasyte(not even sci-fi in my book but whatever) and SAO competing for sci-fi Mahouka(a great sci-fi LN series with good worldbuilding in my book) is amazing by comparison.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte is a much better show than Mahouka, and it is science fiction. That's enough reason for it to win right there. And like many said, Space Dandy as well. 

I'm surprised Kill la Kill didn't take the top spot in anything, and I don't even think silver spoon s2 was a nominee! A shame, as they are both in my top 5. 
>> ARTICLE
>Parasyte is sci-fi

It's more paranormal than sci-fi. There is no real "science" involved in the story so I don't think it really counts for sci-fi. I personally enjoyed Mahouka more than Parasyte(seeing how the former wore out its welcome around the half-way point) but that's just my own view on both shows.

>I'm surprised Kill la Kill didn't take the top spot in anything

I didn't expect it to take anything besides best girl/boobs. The animation is lacking in comparison to KyoAni and Ufotable and the story is overshadowed by much better shows this year. The comedy wasn't even that good compared to other shows like Barakamon and Gekkan Shojo. At least in my eyes.
>> ARTICLE
You think science fiction genre need involve some scientific content? Wonder what kind of science is involved in "drowned world" by J.G.Ballard or Delaney's "Dhalgren".... You don't get to define genres as you see fit, by ignoring works that already influenced and shaped its history.

It is utterly implausible with the contortions the parasyte body can pull, without even acknowledging this needing any explanation, but still it chooses to frame its story in rather tropish SF way of an alien invasion by superiorly capable biological organisms (even the manner of doing so is rather reminiscent of old SF classics like Heinlein's "puppet masters" - with slug-like creatures, arriving in flying saucers, attaching themselves to peoples backs, taking control of their victims nervous systems, and manipulating those people as puppets.  -  or ofc of "Body Snatchers"), as opposed to phantasmal incursion, demonic possession or any other explicit invocation of the unnatural.
>> ARTICLE
I bet next things we should add to the sci-fi genre are ghost, the ring, vampire, zombie and other unreal shit.


Because "You think science fiction genre need involve some scientific content?"
>> ARTICLE
You are utterly ridiculous if you believe sf can only mean hard sf or be anything at all and nothing in particular, despite the glaringly obvious fact that it has continued to be a well defined genre filled with as you put it "unreal shit" for as long as it has existed at all. Consider say Bradbury's works like the martian chronicles, pretty much any part of new wave of science fiction you care to name etc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, do tell me your criteria to qualify a work as "sci-fi".

And don't tell me that "those are fucking magic and shit. Only things that are recently brought up can be considered Sci-fi. Those shits have existed a long time already. Magic and science are not mixed well because Index said so."
>> ARTICLE
my criteria? why would I bother making up my criteria -- winners of Hugo and/or Nebula awards are "my" criteria. literature courses on science fiction are "my" criteria. For I've pretty much only named commonly accepted staples and staple writers of the genre. Like any genre its defined by institutions, reference body of literature, conventions, publishers, editors, magazines etc. 

Point is parasyte is simply far too derivative of certain acknowledged classics not to be in the same genre as them.

I can't even parse your second paragraph. 
>> ARTICLE
So, you just superficially compare them and say "yep, sci-fi"?

If you take away "alien invasion" setting? will it still be sci-fi?
Because this looks more like "Ushio and Tora" than a sci-fi work.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte being the better show is merely your opinion and other people might think otherwise (but yeah I agree that parasyte anime is better than the Mahouka anime). 

In terms of science fiction genre though Mahouka has a far greater detail, world building and interesting stuff than Parasyte. Parasyte just has Parasytes whilst Mahouka has technomagic, super advanced weapons, a 'society of the future' etc... the poll was best science fiction anime so I consider the win legit.
>> ARTICLE
Well it was also competing against Space Dandy and Knights of Sidonia.
>> ARTICLE
Granted KoS was a pretty good sci-fi show as well(I don't know why people count Space Dandy as sci-fi, I count it more as comedy, but what have you) but loses to Mahouka greatly in terms of detail, worldbuilding, and characters.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest I doubt the voting leaned towards Mahouka because of anything you just said, I'd bet more on the fact that its very popular, and gets a huge boost from the /r/OneTrueTatsuya crowd, but I dropped it very quickly so I won't press it.
>> ARTICLE
True, the popularity of it had a big deal to due with, and only a small minority liked the worldbuilding, but I think one of the main attractions of it *was* the world(and by extension the magic system and the OPness of Tats)
>> ARTICLE
> I don't know why people count Space Dandy as sci-fi, I count it more as comedy, but what have you

It certainly is more of a comedy, but there are definitely sci-fi elements in it. Also shows can be more than one genre.
>> ARTICLE
I think the implication was that it's "main" genre was sci-fi, just like how SAO's "main" genre is sci-fi when its a more adventure-style story.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh SAO's main genre isn't sci-fi but more like action, adventure, harem and romance
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't it say its harem/romance(although it *is* a major element of it) but more so adventure and action.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong was one of the best shows I've seen in my life. The animation, story, art, pacing, and everything about it is just so perfect.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really surprised to see Zankyou no Terror do so well in these polls. It seems to get universally shit on whenever it comes up in comment sections on this subreddit. Maybe people who actually enjoyed it all the way through are a silent majority?

So little votes....probably because the voting system was confusing (it would be nice if a link in the first body took you directly to a poll/bracket rather than another thread that then links to a poll).

I really liked that format, and I think most people here would agree.

As much as I liked Isshuukan Friends, I voted for Ping Pong in the best Spring Anime category...it being the only anime I've ever rated 10/10 while it was airing. 

Mahouka won best Sci-Fi? I guess the only real competition out of the final 5 was Parasyte, although I personally liked Sidonia better it didn't make the cut...I suppose the SciFi aspects of it were good enough. This, however:

>Best Male Character of 2014
>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 252 votes!

Someone please help me understand this. I don't get it at all. And with nearly 1/3 of the vote, no less.

Kind of surprised to see Zankyou no Terror win best Original Anime after it bombed (get it? bombed? hahahaha I'm so funny) in the last few episodes. Surprised it won thriller too, expected the Madoka movie to fare slightly better (not win, of course, but top 3). AND it won summer too, over Barakamon and Nozaki-kun? ...I may have underestimated how much /r/anime liked ZnT...oh well. 

Overall, was nice. And dont worry /u/UgotMAL, I am *perfectly fine* voting Ping Pong the best of 2014 three times. Even though its (probably) not going to win.
>> ARTICLE
/r/OneTrueTatsuya thats why
>> ARTICLE
There must have been a mistake... surely that was the vote for worst character?
>> ARTICLE
All this time I thought /r/OneTrueTatsuya was satire. I mean, I'm pretty sure it was originally. But to think that you... *people*... genuinely like Tatsuya just fills me with rage. People give Kirito shit all the time on this subreddit, but Tatsuya is way worse and yet he wins the best fucking male character of 2014? Are you fucking kidding me /r/anime? You people disgust me. 
>> ARTICLE
You should know that most of the anime audiences nowadays are very young. So it's hard for them to appreciate any "artistic" anime they watched or will see in the future.

It's just how the industry works. Almost everything now aims at young age and show like Ping Pong is hard to find a place among the kids.
>> ARTICLE
You speak the honest truth. I think the people downvoting you are probably just kids who are butthurt over that first comment.
>> ARTICLE
said the guys who commented because they are butt-hurt by the result.
>> ARTICLE
I believe it's called salt for us.

[](#suave)
>> ARTICLE
You are being dwonvoted but i have to agree.
>> ARTICLE
The Stu was just too strong with this one, /r/anime couldn't fight it.
>> ARTICLE
Tatsuya is not worse than Kirito. He's a different MC. Kind of an anti-hero but not really. He doesn't fight for 'justice,' he doesn't do the right thing all the time. People think he's OP as fuck(which is true), but he trained to get that way. Plus he's not all bitchy/emotional.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, honestly, in any other anime I wouldn't necessarily dislike Tatsuya that much. What made me dislike him so much in Mahouka, and ended up making me drop the show despite really liking the action scenes, is the fact that half the goddamn show is just people fucking worshiping Tatsuya. And other various ridiculous shit, like Tatsuya telling the paramedics how to do their goddamn jobs. He's a shitty chuunibyou-pandering character who's only supposed flaws aren't even actually flaws. 
>> ARTICLE
u know, with his powers he could know immediately what damage did someone take for faster treatment, but probably u didnt know this since u dropped the series
>> ARTICLE
We stand united in the question of "How the fuck did Shiba Tatsuya pull that victory off?" in that category.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong won nothing, not even sports?  I guess people just don't like good anime.

Just look at all the votes. Almost nobody voted, it does not represent anything. (that voting system is a bit confusing, so no wonder).

Of course. Chuunibyou population in Japan increased. :P

Whoa whoa. The Mahouka LNs are good. The anime adaptation is poor at best.
>> ARTICLE
Transformers is also one of the highest selling movie franchises of all time, using sales metrics is a poor way to talk about quality, but from what I understand the LN is much better than the show anyways.
>> ARTICLE
I mean it *is* a very good series with amazing worldbuilding and attention to detail. But you're right, sales isn't the best way to say something is good. But in this case, it is good. And yes the anime butchered a lot of the worldbuilding descriptions as well as the plot of the Seven Schools Tournament as well as the Yokohama Arc.
>> ARTICLE
Mahouka is a really good example of Sci-fi done well, I'm not saying the show is good because it's not, but the Sci-fi aspects of the show are good.
>> ARTICLE
Calling Mahouka good science fiction is like saying Pupa was a good example of the horror genre. It's just not.
>> ARTICLE
It has a great world with an intriguing futuristic setting and sci-fi/fantasy elements. I believe it's a great example of a sci-fi.
>> ARTICLE
Time of Eve is a great example of science fiction. Shinsekai Yori is a great example of science fiction. Mahouka is a great example of schlock.

I suppose the difference between best ed song and best ed is the first being only music and the other being animation included?

I still don't get how Zankyou no Terror won that one. Yes, it fit well in the soundtrack. But a lot of other stuff in the list was better animation wise and/or music wise. It's probably  something about most people having watched the show and only voting on it because they remember the great soundtrack and immediately think the ED should win because of that as well... 

Whatever, as long as I can think well enough for myself humanity can survive..

Is it just me or does this make no sense haha I don't mean this in a salty way just that one anime beats another in one catagory only to have it switched around in another similar one

A *lot* of people do not differentiate between animation and art style.

One Week Friends beat out Knights of Sidonia and Ping Pong for best of Spring. Just wow. And Mahouka winning best science fiction over Sidonia? Both One Week Friends and Mahouka are the epitome of mediocrity. That they won anything is laughable. 


>> ARTICLE
I don't get it either.  I am not a fan of Sidonia, but Mahouka definately was mediocre.  Every other episode it seemed was bad.  And the main character was such a gary sue, it was terrible.  
>> ARTICLE
Personally I find Mahouka to be mediocre, but out of what we had to pick from I believe it pulled of the Sci-Fi aspects the best out of the crop, that being the reason I voted for it.
>> ARTICLE
Mahouka did a pretty good job with the sci-fi. I've heard that it's a lot more obvious in the LN's, but it seemed pretty clear to me during my watch that the anime had an actual world built around it with hints of explanations ('magic' as a form of energy, wave patterns, sequences and the use of technology, etc.), but I watch for that stuff much more closely than most on here, so you probably just missed it.
>> ARTICLE
It's not just more obvious, there's entire pages dedicated to worldbuilding in the Mahouka LN.

Maybe in the original F/SN or F/0, but the new UBW anime, is very Rincentric, and she has been the best character in that show.

Rin > Saber anyday of the week. Though I only saw the original F/SN, F/SN UBW Anime, F/Z and Fate/kaleid liner so I might change my opinion should I play the VN or watch Heaven's Feel.

**Best anime of Winter 2014**

>Nagi no Asukara - 76 votes!

>Kill la Kill - 71 votes!

>Log Horizon - 64 votes!

I can live with this... not bad at all in fact.

**Best anime of Spring 2014**

>Isshuukan Friends. (One Week Friends) - 72 votes!

>No Game No Life - 70 votes!

>Ping Pong the Animation - 64 votes!

WOAH! That was unexpected, still I'd rather this than have Ping Pong win.

**Best anime of Summer 2014**

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 72 votes!

>Barakamon - 53 votes!

>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun - 51 votes!

Kind of expected considering most people who voted for the well written laid-back series Nozaki-kun and Barakamon split their votes between the two, Zankyou no Terror was still a worthy winner IMO though.

**Best anime of Fall 2014**

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) - 128 votes!

>Shirobako - 66 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 52 votes!

A near perfect result, I'm surprised that Shirobako made it that high though but glad it did.

**Best animation of 2014**

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 320 votes!

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 62 votes!

>ME!ME!ME! - 57 votes!

That overwhelming victory.. still my runner-up finished second so cheers for that.

**Best OP of 2014**

>Unravel (Tokyo Ghoul) - 117 votes!

>Hikaru Nara / If You Will Shine (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Osu / Your lie in April OP 1) - 79 votes!

>Trigger (Zankyou no Terror / Terror in Resonance) - 66 votes!

I find This Game to be the best OP when you include animation but if you wouldn't include it even though that is further down my favourites would be #1 #2 and #4 so I suppose /r/anime doesn't have quite that poor music taste after all.

**Best ED of 2014**

>Dareka Umiwo (Zankyou no Terror / Terror in Resonance) - 103 votes!

>aLIEz (Aldnoah.Zero) - 84 votes!

>Shirushi (Sword Art Online ED 3) - 63 votes!

Mind if I retract my last statement?

**Best Comedy of 2014**

>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) - 148 votes!

>Barakamon - 109 votes!

>No Game No Life - 64 votes!

Well voted, the two most deserving got spot 1 and 2.

**Best Slice-of-Life of 2014**

>Barakamon - 140 votes!
 
>Isshuukan Friends. (One Week Friends) - 99 votes!

>Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken (I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying) - 84 votes!

So far all my picks has placed first for these... let's just hope they remain in the top 3.

**Best Harem of 2014**

>Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace) - 130 votes!

>Nisekoi - 111 votes!

>Monogatari Series - Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari - 90 votes!

Hooh? Inou-Battle was that popular huh? well Nisekoi still made 2nd.

**Best Thriller of 2014**

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 152 votes!

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) - 131 votes!

>Psycho-Pass 2 - 76 votes!

While I do believe that Kiseijuu is the best of the animes we got to pick from Zankyou no Terror definitely pulled of the Thriller aspect the best and hence is the worthy winner here.

**Best Romance of 2014**

>Nagi no Asukara - 125 votes!

>Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) - 87 votes!

>Golden Time - 83 votes!

Clearly not enough people appreciate the purity of Golden Time and it's amazingness, you should be ashamed! well I suppose it's understandable since Nagi no Asukara is quite the anime as well. I do believe it's a stretch calling Your Lie in April a good romance anime thus far however, it's good drama but the romance in the series is very undeveloped thus far... has potential though.

**Best Sports of 2014**

>Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season (Kuroko's Basketball Season 2) - 141 votes!

>Free!: Eternal Summer - 120 votes!

>Haikyuu!! - 107 votes!

Kuroko won?... and Ping Pong finished last?... HAHHAHAHA SUCK ON THAT PING PONG FANBOYS!! WHERE'S YOUR GOD NOW?!! FUCK YEAH!! (no but for real though I find Kuroko amazing and I love it so, so much but I did not think for a second it'd win the category... this makes me kind of happy.)

**Best Science-Fiction of 2014**

>Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (The Irregular at Magic High School) - 203 votes!

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu / Parasyte -the maxim- - 150 votes!

>Sword Art Online II - 93 votes!

I did vote for Mahouka, it does the Sci-fi genre the best out of these series, albeit it's probably the worst anime out of the bunch IMO.

**Best Action/Shounen of 2014**

>Hunter x Hunter (2011) - 197 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) - 137 votes!

>Kill la Kill - 75 votes!

This is a surprise... I did vote for HxH but I thought it'd be a close standoff with Bahamut... clearly not enough people appreciated that series.

**Best Male character of 2014**

>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 252 votes!

>Killua Zoldyck (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 111 votes!

>Yato (Noragami) and Wenge Kong (Ping Pong the Animation) (tie) - 69 votes!

What? for fucking real? I mean I'm glad Inaho didn't win this crap but I can only give this one to the circlejerk on someone cheating the poll... how is Tatsuya the best Male character? he's not even close to the depth or development to the others, in fact the only one I find him better than is Tomoda and Inaho out of all the contestants... just how?

**Best Female character of 2014**

>Rin Tohsaka (Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works) - 118 votes!

>Chiyo Sakura (Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun / Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) - 74 votes!

>Asuna Yuuki (Sword Art Online II) - 61 votes!

Meh, all the mainstream ones got the votes, though I suppose Sakura and Rin at the very least are worth the votes they recieved, you guys don't have enough love for Hatoko though.^TensaiBeatNibutani!^Woohoo!

**Best Character Development of 2014**

>Meruem (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 154 votes!

>Seishuu Handa (Barakamon) - 67 votes!

>Shinichi Izumi (Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu / Parasyte -the maxim-) - 54 votes!

Wasn't aware people thought Meruem had such good character development, I mean it was good but I think Handa Seishuu (my vote), Izumi Shinichi and Kong Wenge all had greater development.

**Best Male Protagonist of 2014**

>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 141 votes!

>Killua Zoldyck (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 105 votes!

>Araragi Koyomi (Monogatari Series - Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari) - 55 votes!

Come the fuck on guys... Araragi was barely even in Hanamonogatari and fucking Tatsuya again?... well atleast Handa finished 5th.

**Best Female Protagonist of 2014**

>Chiyo Sakura (Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun / Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) - 100 votes!

>Rin Tohsaka (Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 85 votes!

>Shiro (No Game No Life) - 54 votes!

Hmm.. I think I might've voted Akane here for how great of an MC I find her to be but Sakura was my 2nd choice so not salty about it.

**Best boobs of 2014**

>Esdeath (Akame ga Kill!) - 103 votes!

>Hana-chan (ME!ME!ME!) - 96 votes!

>Jibril (No Game No Life) and Isuzu Sento (Amagi Brilliant Park) (tie) - 76 votes!

You guys lack Suou Amane in your life, go play the Grisaia VN you guys! though I suppose the choices were understandable albeit subpar to the great fluffyness of big sister Amane.

**Best abs/muscles of 2014**

Hmm?... maybe it's time to catch back up on Naruto... still though a bit surprised Lancer vs Archer in the prologue of Fate/SN didn't make it to a top 3 finish, the first time we saw that breathtaking animation was incredible.

**Best Animation Studio of 2014**

>Madhouse - 130 votes!

Not surprised Madhouse won this one but damn was A-1 close! a bit surprised about the low amount of votes recieved by Shaft though.

**Best last Episode of 2014**

>Barakamon - 107 votes!

>Tokyo Ghoul - 69 votes!

>Ping Pong the Animation - 66 votes!

I don't know... despite how much I feel like Ping Pong is overrated and doesn't deserve half of the praise it's getting around here it should have won this one because that last ep was amazing, Tokyo Ghoul could've also won this with no complaints but I'm not sure I can agree to Barakamon.

**Best Artstyle of 2014**

>No Game No Life - 126 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 81 votes!

>Space Dandy - 52 votes!

Yeah, I really enjoyed the art of NGNL albeit I enjoyed the excellent use of switches between artstyles in Nisekoi even more, on a sidenote I'm glad Glasslip made it as far as it did, I nominated it in the wild card because I find the art in Glasslip to be it's only redeeming quality and it seems people agree with me.

**Most hyped anime for 2015**

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works 2nd Season - 164 votes!

>Durarara!!x2 - 138 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel (Movie) - 137 votes!

Well this one was an obvious outcome as Unlimited Hype Works is just so hyped by everyone and everything, I'm glad to see Durarara made 2nd with one more vote than Heaven's Feel though.

Can't even remember what I voted here but Mandom is pretty good so I don't mind it winning this one.

**Best Antagonist of 2014**

>Esdeath (Akame ga Kill!) - 108 votes!

>Slaine Troyard (Aldnoah.Zero) - 76 votes!

>Meruem (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 75 votes!

I don't know, there was no character in Akame ga Kill I found to be very good, Slaine on the other hand was well written and is interesting to watch, Meruem was also a very well made antagonist.

**Best OP Music of 2014**

>Database (Log Horizon series) - 78 votes!

>Unravel (Tokyo Ghoul) - 56 votes!

>Hikaru Nara / If You Will Shine (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Osu / Your Lie in April) - 53 votes!

Database is overrated... but still pretty good so I can see why it won even though I'd rather have Unravel win. Though you people are severely underestimating the Haikyuu!! opening.

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 114 votes!

>Kill la Kill - 48 votes!

>Aldnoah.Zero - 34 votes!

WOOOOOOOW!! Really? I personally believe Aldnoah.Zero to be vastly superior to any of the other entries in this category, I mean sure KLK had good OST and so did ZnT but they don't even come close to what Sawano Hiroyuki pulled off in A.Z.. and it only got 34 votes? I am pretty fucking surprised by this outcome.

Thanks man! I'm going to be posting two more threads for these ones still, one for anime of the year and one for 'wrap up,' and suggestions on how to improve for next year. So keep watch out for those two.

Will do! I'll see if I can't come up with some constructive feedback until then.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! I appreciate it!
>> ARTICLE
I liked tatsuya shiba for best male charachter. For awhile now anime studios doing shonen have been spewing out super flawed main charachters so that it's easy to give them charachter development. And then they just keep beating you over the head with their flaws and foibles. You just correct some of the hyper-unrealistic idiosyncrasies, and suddenly charachter growth. It feels very pandering, and is really annoying to watch. 

Tatsuya Shibas charachter is a big fuck you to all that.
>> ARTICLE
But at the same time he's so bland... he literally has 0 development and everyone in the show is a device to show how OP he is without him actually doing very much...
>> ARTICLE
> everyone in the show is a device to show how OP he is without him actually doing very much

Thats just a side effect of him being op as fuck whilst not being flashy/ keeping things secretive. Also the anime adaptation being pretty mediocre and not explaining anything.

I too was getting pretty fed up with main characters who was clearly inferior to the antagonist but just 'barely' winning by power of friendship/ justice/ willpower right, training for x time or, my personal hate, plot armour (fuck you Kirito). Tatsuya being op as fuck from the beginning, who just completely shat all over the antagonists (amusingly to the level thats a lot like how the main antagonists in shonens shit all over the good guys when they first see him) was a nice change. 

If it makes you feel any better I can only see the Divine Tatsuya worship dropping off in the future. No season 2 (atleast as far as we can tell) and season 1 has enough hate I think to dissuade people from watching it (atleast on this subreddit). There will always be a core crowd (people who read the books cos they are good imo) who will continue the worship but you get that with almost any anime. 
>> ARTICLE
True enough, I think it's not just a side effect though, if you look at Sakamaki Izayoi from Mondaiji, he's the same kind of OP that Tatsuya is but he has way more personality and the side characters are also of relevance and has personalities in comparison to the people in Mahouka.

Well being salty won't change the result.
>> ARTICLE
Both points are seen that way due to poor adaptation imo.

> True enough, I think it's not just a side effect though, if you look at Sakamaki Izayoi from Mondaiji, he's the same kind of OP that Tatsuya is but he has way more personality

This is in more detail in the books but basically Tatsuya is incapable of feeling strong emotions except being over protective of his sister due to magic lobotomy. Hence why he seems so bland in the anime. He shows a lot of his personality by thinking (since he generally doesn't speak much because its not worth the effort) but this isn't shown in the anime. Tatsuya has no problems with being bored. 

> the side characters are also of relevance and has personalities in comparison to the people in Mahouka.

Side characters also has a lot of relevance in the books but the anime didnt show it. There were prob too much to animate and not enough time. They cut out an entire volume which focused almost entirely on side characters only. Lots of the scenes involving side characters were just cut out (along with the pretty detailed technomagic babble at magic works). 

Personally drowning in too much salt from /u/jordy56's polls to care about this one.

Yeah Jordy's salt is quite vast, I feel like it's unfair judging something in a contest like this from anything but it's anime however as it's about anime and not light novels, visual novels or manga.

I feel like all of Log Horizon's suggestions could be summed down too:

"Despite Deen's best efforts people are still watching it."
>> ARTICLE
Ha, maybe.

Deen's "style" is definitely prevalent in season two. Just the character designs alone makes it pretty evident. However, the meat or core of what makes Log Horizon what it is is the same as always. That is, it's pretty darn good.
>> ARTICLE
The story's still as good as ever, but the subpar animation (disregarding simple differences in how characters look, the animation itself is of poorer quality) is pretty disappointing. Though I suppose I'm not that disappointed, knowing Deen's track record.
>> ARTICLE
If Deen could just learn what a human face looked like we wouldn't have this problem. They did it with Higorashi and they're doing it again with those really awkward faces I'm sure you've seen.
>> ARTICLE
It worked for Higurashi though.  

Without the faces, it wouldnt have been as terrifying in parts.

Would be neat if Ufotable used some of that Unlimited Budget Works magic on that franchise.  I would throw money at that bluray set.

Studio DEEN: I want to make anime, but I dont want to spend alot of money...

How the hell do people have time to watch so much anime? I can hardly watch 1-2 airing shows along with 1-2 older shows and still keep up with work/school/social life. I get through maybe 1-2 episodes on weekdays and 3-5 on weekends but watching every show in a season seems ridiculous to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I skip intros and endings, then an episode is usually under 20 minutes. If you watch 3 episodes a day that's only an hour. Hint: you drop the social life to add more anime. I'm social at school that's enough for me. 
>> ARTICLE
You don't get a life when you watch 24 episodes a week. 
>> ARTICLE
The trick is to have anime-watching friends and have anime night be part of your social life.  Combining life aspects is much more efficient than doing it separately.
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently in semester break, I have a lot of time in my hands now. I'm currently watching 49 shows in total because why the hell not.
>> ARTICLE
If you spare 1h every day, you get 7 hours per week. Let's say that's 14 episodes of anime for simplicity. You can now watch most of the stuff OP recommended.

Don't end up like me or OP and watch everything, you are at risk of burning out fast.
>> ARTICLE
Since Banjo put up about 29 different shows, that's about 4 episodes a day, or less than 2 hours a day. 1-2 * 5 + 3-5 * 2 is about 11-20 shows. So it's really just going from 1hr of anime/day to 2hrs/day. After work and sleep and anime/food (I'd just eat while watching), there's still at least 6hrs in the day for other necessities/friends on the weekdays.

Of course, having an anime hobby is easier after finishing school, because 1. probably less people you interact with, and 2. schoolwork doesn't take a variable chunk of your day.
>> ARTICLE
This is actually my first time taking on such a heavy load.

So the question is, how do I do it? I do work 30-40 hours a week, but since anime is one of my only hobbies, I set aside a lot of time for it.

Honestly, I thought the same thing too about the amount. But it's actually pretty fun for two reasons: the reddit threads and working your brain. The former because it's great to watch the shows as they air to "hang out" with everyone else who shares my similar interest, since I literally cannot talk with anyone else I know about it. The latter because it's actually quite fun to see if I can keep straight in my head the characters, the worlds, what has been happening, etc. It's sort of a "challenge" that I've set for myself.
>> ARTICLE
Out of interest, do you play video games?
>> ARTICLE
I do! I love to play Dota 2, Dark Souls, Legend of Zelda, Mario, etc. Anime takes up more of my time now than gaming, but I've always been and will continue to be an avid gamer as well.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's thanks to people like you that I can filter what I have time to watch by picking carefully, so I appreciate the rundown of everything. I'm only watching Psycho-Pass 2 at the moment, but I'll look into some of the others. I can't wait until I'm out of college and I'm only working 40 hours a week instead of 80+. I'll do the same I'm sure.
>> ARTICLE
You and me both. The most anime I've picked up in a season before this was like 6. Now I'm watching like 17.

I like your list and I'm actually watching most of the shows you recommended and I did drop some of the shows you dropped. Looks like we've got similar tastes.

I've haven't tried Twintails but I'll give it a shot and also is Kukkuri-san really that good. While the humor was good in the first episode, I found that it was pretty dry on average.
>> ARTICLE
Twintails is silly, beyond ridiculous. But it's because of that that makes it so much fun to behold.

As for Kokkuri-san, the latest episode (number four) was the best yet, with its references. However, I think everyone's enjoyment with the show stems from Kohina. I absolutely love her doll-like way of talking and acting, and her general behavior towards everything. From me, I say give it the three episode treatment. At that point, the comedy involved and the characters should be relatively known.
>> ARTICLE
I think most people are missing out on one of the best shows this season:  Garo: Honoo no Kokuin

It's animation is nice, the story is fun and the characters are top notch. The story is pretty adult with as well, which is a plus. Check it out!
>> ARTICLE
This.

For a tokusatsu drama spin-off this is a real surprise. I mean seeing a "so fast-paced animated fights x slow and delicate storytelling" show is nice, and MAPPA does its job flawlessly. Even the CGI is great and faithful to the original series. What a luckily great Fall we have there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm enjoying Garo very much, but I'm biased towards fantasy shows, so I figured I was probably one of the only ones since it's my favorite genre. I love the different animation style! 
>> ARTICLE
Episode 4 was especially great!
>> ARTICLE
Definitely one of the better action Anime right now but with this season line up people will miss a lot I feel.

No, really, watch it.  Besides everything /u/donole313 said, for reasons I can't quite explain, it also makes me feel nostalgic for the likes of Trigun, Bebop, and Yu Yu Hakusho.  With the exception of one or two moments of odd CGI early on I have nothing bad to say about GARO.

Cross Ange is shit. My god is it shit. Don't listen to them
>> ARTICLE
Cross Ange is good if you want to watch a train wreck in action.  But Garo is good if you just want some good action and entertainment in a Berserk-esque fantasy setting.  


Also, sex dad is best dad.
>> ARTICLE
............I hate all of you. :)

I'll start watching this one, too. You guys and gals are smooth talkers, I tell ya.
>> ARTICLE
Is k, Banjo, I'm managing to keep up with 27 airing shows. You can deal with GARo, I believe in you.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting, I've only heard bad things about Cross Ange. I hope you give Garo a chance =) 
>> ARTICLE
Cross ange is actually really interesting.  The lesbian prison rape makes sense because it is a pretty fucked up prison.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Ange is like Valvrave it's so bad everything apart from the animation and the seiyu, that it becomes good.
>> ARTICLE
I want to agree with that, but Cross Ange deals with dark themes you wouldn't expect, unlike Valvrave, so I'll recommend sticking with it. Themes like slavery, forced conscription and personal discovery seems to be the current flavor. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching because it's funny. But the theme have traditionnaly been massacred by japanimation, there are exceptions but Sunrise has not produced something good plot wise for so long, I wouldn't count on them on this one. Even more with the incoming romance.
>> ARTICLE
I sort of disagree. I'm finding the world pretty intriguing and the character development is surprisingly good.
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda surprised this one isn't getting much attention either. It's not as good as MAPPA's other show this season (Bahamut), but it's still a solid medieval fantasy so far, and with 2 cours to work with, it has a lot of potential in the long run.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm kinda surprised this one isn't getting much attention either.

Agreed. Its a bit most people are turned off by the weird CGI armor suits, but baring that it seems like a really promising show.
>> ARTICLE
Garo has two cours? I'm so much more excited for this show now!
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if there's official confirmation, but one of the animators [tweeted about storyboarding episode 16 and 20](https://twitter.com/mictimiha/status/523466157383090176).
>> ARTICLE
That seems like a solid reason to think it's 2-cour. Thanks, this really changes my expectations of where the plot is going.
>> ARTICLE
Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru - It's a shame nobody is watching this. Depending on the way they take the show this next episode, it might be the dark horse show of the season (if a bit reminiscence of another popular show)

You don't even need the 3 episode rule, go and watch the first one. You'll either want to drop it or see what comes next.
>> ARTICLE
Listen to this man/woman, he/she ain't lying.

He likes Twintail. I like him.

That show is the greatest stupidest thing Ive ever seen.

I look forward to the Funimation troll dub.

The dub for Korean Zombie Desk Car holds a special place in my heart.

Just watched the first episode and *what the fuck* have you gotten me into, lol.

[Cross Ange Episode One Spoilers](/s "I'm hoping that was 'just' an anal cavity search because my God, that whole section was making me quite uncomfortable. Uncomfortable in a 'good' way, meaning that they did a nice job of going from super high and mighty to incredibly low and scummy over the course of 20 mintues.")

Jesus Christ this show doesn't let up from the get-go. o_O
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly how most people were feeling. And it gets worse in episode 2 but i think that by episode 4 the MC has accepted and adapted to the situation and the show can finally truly start.
>> ARTICLE
...and Yama no Susume S2, Yowamushi Pedal S2, Gundam Build Fighters T, Reconguista in G, Garo, SAOII, WIXOSS. But he can't really comment on stuff he hasn't seen...probably.
>> ARTICLE
> Yama no Susume S2, Yowamushi Pedal S2, Gundam Build Fighters T, Reconguista in G, Garo, SAOII, WIXOSS. 

Pedal, Yama and WiXOSS are all sequels, so its understandable.

G-reco is a trainwrck, Build fighters has a very niche appeal, and SAO II is beyond medicore.

Garo is definitely the only one in that list worth picking up (atleast without watching season 1 of wixoss)
>> ARTICLE
He has Psycho-Pass 2 and Log Horizon 2, so the only reason he wouldn't have those is he didn't watch the first seasons, which are fine. I'm not forcing him to watch it.

G-Reco, imo, is really good. People who may not be able to fully understand the plot and how Tomino draws the world will write it off as a trainwreck, but it's certainly understandable. If you can't get it, you just won't. I'm just used to it, so I really like it.
>> ARTICLE
Yep! Sorry on those. :(

I'm not watching *absolutely everything,* just the ones that had my interest from the start.

I didn't include SAO2/summer leftovers because they are not from this season! :)

And as for Cross Ange, I'm tempted. I got a lot on plate already, but I don't think I would mind scantily-clad women fighting dragons and what-not.
>> ARTICLE
> SAO2

Opps, sorry, my bad. Idk why, it still felt new to me (I think it was because it was the new arc). Sorry about that.

With regards to Cross Ange, imo you're really missing out. I think it turns a lot of people away because of how horrible the MC is, but that's actually on purpose, and it's really fun to see how a douchebag MC tries to survive in that world. I honestly think it's top 5 this season, but I can see why it would be in the bottom two for some people. It's that kind of anime.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, is it a School Days clone (assuming you've seen SD)? Because I loved how bad it was. Just wondering if this is the same in that regard.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Ange is nothing like School Days, unless you're comparing them as train wrecks of a good time.


Cross Ange is like a "women in prison" exploitation film, anime style.  

While the "mechas vs dragons" thing drew me in at first, the "princess humiliation-style fanservice" turned me off.  But hey, if you're into that, the animation is good at least.  And the deaths (yes, the dragons actually kill people) are surprisingly violent and uncensored, if you're into that as well.
>> ARTICLE
I actually haven't seen School Days, but I know how bad it is. I don't think that the MC is bad in that kind of way. Makoto was more of a "they came to me so I just accepted it" kind of way (correct me if I'm wrong).

Ange (the MC for Cross Ange) is more a "you *things* (referring to people) are like pathetic insects, and I refuse to consider myself to be the same as you all" kind of douche. Like a princess being forced to live among slaves, but still keeping that mentality of being a princess.

So they're different, but they're both horrible people. If you like MCs that are just so blatantly horrible, then you might like it.
>> ARTICLE
You also missed Donten ni Warau, which for me is by far the biggest dark horse of the season (I didn't like Bahamut too much though). It's starting to really pick up and from what I heard the source material is great so I don't think it's going to fall off.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a shame it didn't draw most people in right away. It seemed much more interesting than many of the other popular shows (not including the now-hyped stuff like UBW or Bahamut).
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako only gets a consider for you? Excellent animation, sound, direction and storytelling, but all people are doing is complaining "nothing happens" because it's not le epic journey of epicness. Contrast that with Trinity Seven and its terrible pacing and direction. Which is a shame because it seems there's a half-decent story in there waiting to be told properly, but as it stands, it's fated to be in the same category as Mahou Sensou and Strike the Blood : Fantashit.
>> ARTICLE
No mention of Mushishi?

Definitely a Must Watch.

They have left the best stories for last, it seems.
>> ARTICLE
(Please don't crucify me!)

....I have yet to see Mushihi season one. I said it.

I need to get on that one at some point, and then proceed to season two.
>> ARTICLE
Its completely fine to start on mushishi now, its a completely episodic series and one episode will have absolutely nothing to do with the next.
>> ARTICLE
This weeks episode of Mushishi was probably the best episode in the show EVER (counting the very first season too).

>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the "not a black hole" MC in Trinity Seven makes the show worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with all your recommendations from what I've seen. I'm not sold for Fate as aots yet though, I think Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Shingeki no Bahamut are both strong contenders for that along with fate.

I also noticed you didn't mention Garo. If your not watching it you should give it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
Curious on your opinion of Sword Art Online?
>> ARTICLE
Sword Art Online, eh?

Initially, SAO garnered an 8 from me. It was actually one of my first posts ever in this subreddit (my thoughts on it and what now). I was kind of a newbie at the analyzing back then, so it was mainly just thoughts and my personal enjoyment.

After thinking on it a bit later, I moved it down to a 7. SAO doesn't really deserve all of the hate that it gets, to an extent.

The first arc (Aincrad) is pretty good. Despite the time skips that happen frequently, I found the world they created and the themes presented to be pretty solid. By the time Kirito, Asuna, and Yuki are all together, they made it feel not like they were in a game but in reality, just living their lives as one. That's something important, because it relates to Kirito's central idea of how the real and virtual worlds are more connected than we think.

ALO is a terrible arc. I agree with the hate on that. Not because they moved Asuna to the side, but because of the villain and the world building. Aincrad felt special, it felt as if it had depth. ALO never felt that way. The focus wasn't really on ALO, Kirito, or even Asuna. Rather, it was on the rather awkward relationship troubles of Sugu towards her "brother." Big dip in quality for sure.

SAO2 brings back what the first arc did, and that was focusing on the important characters and the world. Now, the latter doesn't have too much going for it, but I felt that there was an adequate amount of time spent on showcasing the game and rules enough to let us understand how everything works. It's nothing like on Log Horizon's level, but it's appreciated. So, for Phantom Bullet, the focus shifted to the characters (what everyone has always wanted). Again, what they do here isn't anything amazing or groundbreaking in terms of characterization, but they do a nice job of developing Sinon and even exploring Kirito, showing that he isn't as flawless as we think him to be. The villain was probably the best yet, but that's not saying much considering the first was almost non-existent and the second was just really, really dumb.

This newest arc is actually reminiscent of Log Horizon; raiding, explaining spells, coordinating attacks, accepting quests, etc. I've actually enjoyed these last couple of episodes because for the first time in a long time (I think going all the way back to Kirto, Asuna, and Yuki in their "home") it doesn't feel dire, if that makes sense. As in, while they are on a harrowing quest, it finally doesn't feel like some impending doom/death/suffering is awaiting any of them. I can just sit back, relax, and enjoy watching the characters that I like interact with one another.

That's my rant for now. :P Sorry it got so long. I'll be making a proper review of SAO2 in the future (when it finishes airing), but these are my thoughts at the moment. Is it better than SAO1? I can't say at the moment, not until I've fully viewed what it has to offer.
>> ARTICLE
Saw the wall of text and figured I would watch The Walking Dead before reading this LOOOL. But to reply, I watch SAO and basically all I can say is "yea u rite". You nailed all the arcs down. I don't know how Alfheim pt.2 will play out because I never read the manga, but it isn't so bad. The first one was so on edge since it was their lives, after that, everything sort of got less tense. It's easier to relate this to gaming now than life and death, and he actually has a group (albeit they don't fulfil roles, RIP Agil Tankmaster) he's doing this with, which is a change for Kirito.

However, I don't think SAO2 is better than SAO1. The tension of life and death, the dual wielding, the soloing Kirito did, everything was epic. Although I think  having Yuki around gives him an unfair edge...

Hopefully SAO 2 is enjoyable to watch, thanks for the review!
>> ARTICLE
I feel what made GGO feel like SAO again was the return of real danger, that a character's life was once again at stake, where decisions couldn't rely on the fallback of "it's k I'll just respawn"

It was more exciting when you were watching with the knowledge that "If you die in ~~Canada~~ Aincrad, you die in real life"


>> ARTICLE
You should give [Donten ni Warau](http://www.hummingbird.me/anime/donten-ni-warau) a watch. It's the underdog of this season for me. Other than that I mostly agree with your list. The only thing I'd have to say is that, sadly, Grisaia falls off hard after the first 3 episodes because it's way too much material for the amount of episodes. Episode 4 was just...wow. I still can't believe how much they skipped and how much they've crammed into that episode. If you like the setting, do yourself a favor and play the VN
>> ARTICLE
Seriously. Watch the first 3 episodes of Grisaia no Kajitsu. If you like it, just pick up the visual novel after that. The drop in quality is steep.
>> ARTICLE
They tricked us... making us think it would be 2 cour and suddenly shortening an arc like that.
>> ARTICLE
Man I am super glad of how highly you rated Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso, I had no clue people in this subreddit had liked the show because apparently there were more "hyped" shows. 

The art style is amazing, I love every single characters, and the soundtrack and how hard this anime hits is just amazing. I came into this show not expecting much but boy this show (dare I say it) is my favorite of the season.

I agree Shingeki No Bahamut has a Top tier OP but you can't go wrong with **Goose House** and for me the OP for Shigatsu is a bit better, though that is my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty popular in the subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
Where's akame ga kill?
>> ARTICLE
Shows like Akame and SAO are from the previous season! This is just for anime that began here in the Fall. :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh I see. I'm still new to anime so these threads are great. Thanks for making one!
>> ARTICLE
Not a problem. Look out for one next season, too. But by then, you'll probably be a pro! :3
>> ARTICLE
I don't agree with you on Terra Formars, I started reading the manga, and It's one of the best I've seen/read in a while.
>> ARTICLE
Why do people rate Bahamut so highly? From what I've watched of it, the characters are frustrating and nothing has, really, happened. I just don't understand it. Can anyone fill me in on why it's so good?

I don't care for the "excellent animation" - sometimes the CG animation is incredibly jarring and sloppy. 
>> ARTICLE
I KNOW! I hate the CG so much! I thought I was going crazy since everyone else likes it, so thank you! The actual animation though is really good, even if I dislike the style. But that just makes the sudden bad CG even worse lulz.
>> ARTICLE
Hrmm, well for me the characters are pretty darn awesome. Some of the best personalities from among the season.

Episode one was setting the "journey" and world up. Episode two gave us Amira. Episode three gave us Rita. Now that the "players" are all set, stuff can get rolling. But even then, episode three was cool because they did the zombie stuff so darn well.

Animation is indeed excellent, and I've yet to be put off by the CG. It's definitely a lot worse in other shows (Parasyte for example).

Maybe for you it would be best to wait for the show to finish all the way through first and then give it a go? Nothing wrong with that!
>> ARTICLE
First time posting on reddit but what the hell I spend the most time here. 

EDIT: FORMATTING

First off, you all inspired me to start a blog, so if you guys want to check it out, [the link is here](http://ninjaboianimeblog.wordpress.com/)

Watching: 25 from current season (11 Mid-High tier or higher), 4 from past seasons, 2 may add in later, 4 may be dropped at some point. 

**AOTS Contender**  
* Kiseijuu/Parasyte - Good Atmosphere+Animation+Deep Themes  
* Shirobako - Meta - Look at Industry+Decent Animation+Drift Racing  
* Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso - Dat Sounds Design+Nice Art Style  

**High Tier**  
* Amagi Brilliant Park - Rappers Running a Theme Park. Yes  
* Gundam Build Fighters Try (Sequel) - BURNDING BUILD GUNDAM  
* Log Horizon 2 (Sequel) - DATABASE WOWOW  
* Psycho Pass 2 (Sequel) - Keeps the same dark atmosphere, gripping plot  

**Mid High Tier**  
* Akatsuki no Yona - Reminds me of Fire Emblem or Dynasty Warriors  
* Gundam: G no Reconguista - Digging the old school feel to it  
* Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis - Pirates of the Caribbean + DnD  
* Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru - Dark Magical Girl Fighter Seems Interesting  

**Mid Tier**  
* Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Waranarai Ken (Short) - Cute Meta Anime  
* Garo: Honoo no Kokuin - Kid is annoying, Dad is boss, interesting art style  
* Gugure! Kokkuri-san - Excellent VAs, nice Japanese mythology, nice palate cleanser  
* Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de - Interesting premise to see an MC with a totally useless power and how he copes  
* Nanatsu no Taizai (Manga-reader) - One of my favorite current shonen  
* Ore Twintail ni Narimasu - In it for the lulz  
* Trinity Seven: 7-nin no Mahoutsukai - Decent magical system + badass MC  

**Mid Low Tier**
* Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo (chance to drop) - I feel like it's a trainwreck waiting to happen. Who doesn't like watching trainwrecks and saying I told you so  
* Denki Gai no Honya San (chance to drop) - Cute vignettes, not much more is too gripping  
* Madan no Ou to Vanadis (chance to drop) - Decent action sequences, pacing is a bit off  
* Orenchi no Furo Jijou (Short) - Nice palate cleanser, that's about it  
* World Trigger (Manga Reader) - Animation is eh, but I still like the manga so I'll stick it out  

**Low Tier**  
* Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji (chance to drop) - Sometimes the couple dynamic is amusing. Sometimes not. Hit or miss  
* Tribe Cool Crew - Literally only in it to see how they animate the dance sequences, as a dancer myself.   

**Dropped**
* Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai - Doesn't stand out among the harems this season  
* Donten ni Warau - Characters and dialogue don't make me care enough  
* Grisaia no Kaijutsu - Not a fan of the VN  
* Sanzoku no Musume Ronja - Nice CG and animation, but ultimately no central plot  
* Sora no Method - Forced melodrama bores me  
* Ushinawareta Mirai no Motomete - CG is a bit weird, and again, pacing is kind of slow  

**Oh Hold (For Reasons)**  
* Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (until Fate/Zero is caught up on)  
* Terra Formars (until uncensored version comes out)  

**Continuing Shows**  
* Akame Ga Kill  
* Pokemon XY  
* Sword Art Online II  
* Yu Gi Oh Arc V   
>> ARTICLE
You will be happy to know that Terra Formars has now had all episodes uncensored, and let me tell you the newest episode is fantastic!
>> ARTICLE
I know! I saw the first three episodes. Haven't gotten around to the latest few, and I'm kind of holding out until there's a confirmation that there is even less censorship ep 4 onward. I've read that there's fewer censorship in those, but having read the manga I know [that there's](/s "more human gore to come.") 

NINJAEDIT: SPOILER FORMATTING
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for joining in on the fun! Always nice to have new members showing up in the community.

Shirobako is pretty high up for you, huh? I can respect that. I think it will at least be average to good, but not really AOTS in any aspect. Especially when it has to compete against things like Your Lie In April.

You gotta get caught up on that Fate train. F/SN:UBW is just too good right now.
>> ARTICLE
RE Shirobako: I really like looking at "meta" aspects of any community. Part of the reason I started a blog was to have an "in" to get in. I'm hoping that this blog will lead to more discussions not just about anime as media, but about the community as a whole and how it compares to other consumption communities, and what can be done to improve said communities. From that angle, Shirobako really fits in is that it looks at the "meta" aspects. Plus I'm a business major, so looking at how the cogs and wheels of an anime studio are managed really fascinates me more than it really should. 

RE Fate: I keep hearing contradictory advice on whether to watch F/Z before F/SN or not from friends. One way or another I will watch this series.
>> ARTICLE
>Twintails isn't a must-watch

***u wat***
>> ARTICLE
It's good, it's good. But it's not top-tier. I know we all want it to be, but such is life.
>> ARTICLE
Terra Formars is ,in my opinion, is definitely not the "Drop it" teir. I personally enjoy it, especially the most recent episode-- #5

>> ARTICLE
>The only downside is the subbing at the moment is pretty darn bad since no official streams picked it up to simulcast.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I don't know whose subs you're watching, but Chyuu is doing a fantastic job.

One of the others you didn't mention is [Ai Tenchi Muyo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24699/Ai_Tenchi_Muyo!) which is a nice treat for any fans of the Tenchi series.  My only problem with it is that it could have easily been a 12 episode series at 22 minutes each episode.  Instead they're doing a 50 episode series at 3 minutes each episode.  At least they release every weekday.
>> ARTICLE
Chyuu? Okay, I'll look out for their subs, then. The one's I've been finding have been terrible, with stupidly unnecessary TL notes or inappropriate character wording (having the Princess swear, etc.).

Ai Tenchi Muyo, eh? I'll add this one to my plan to watch and charge through it after it's done airing. Thanks for the suggestion!
>> ARTICLE
I would change Sora no Method and Trinity Seven to *consider* but I think this is a really reasonable rundown. I also thought Daitoshokan was good as an easy, stress-free viewing, but I understand where you're coming from. We all have our own impressions.
>> ARTICLE
Clicked on this expecting the next Super Serious Season First Impression video from Demo. Little disappointed but this is a great overview of the season. People should consult this instead of posting 4-10 "what is good this season" threads
>> ARTICLE
Oh, shoot. I hope I didn't steal Demo's title. I like his videos a lot, and definitely don't want to take away his thunder.

And thanks for the kind words. Yea, my intention was to instead give recommendations for those that need them so, as you say, people don't need to keep asking. Instead, they can look to mine and a few other's on their ideas.
>> ARTICLE
You're fine haha. You're not stealing anything
>> ARTICLE
No, Banjo did steal something...  my heart.

Wow, this turned gay fast.  I'm sorry.
>> ARTICLE
I have this effect on people. :3
>> ARTICLE
Grisaia : As a fan of the VN source material, I would say to CONSIDER IT ONLY. Despite how much I loved the VN, the anime up to now has skipped major important plot points in the VN. If one truely wishes to experince Grisaia no Kaijitsu and understand what in the world is going on and why characters do what they do , I suggest all thoose who want to know it read the VN and complete that first, then watch the anime. 

TLDR; MUST Read the VN first, then WATCH watching the anime.
>> ARTICLE
How long is the VN ?

I probably don't have time to read a VN nowadays ; I've read both Clannad (+AS) and Fate back when I was a student, so I'm not advert to long VN but it's just that I work and I have quite a few other hobbies than Japanese stuff so it will be hard to fit if it's not as good.
>> ARTICLE
I believe Grisaia no Kajitsu is a little shorter than Fate/Stay Night.  
The novel has a very relaxed pace and has excellent comedy, so there should be no problem in taking your time reading through smaller segments as you progress through the common route.  

It's a really good novel and is absolutely worth reading.
>> ARTICLE
I really suck at stopping when I reading something good though, that's why I'm saying I probably do not have the time to spend 50 hours reading a VN.
>> ARTICLE
I understand and I can totally relate to that.  
Fortunately, Grisaia no Kajitsu has a structure that's relatively easy to break into 'episodes'. You basically get tiny transition screens every now and then, so you can happily use them as stop markers.  

Trust me, it's seriously worth your time.
>> ARTICLE
I had typed up my "synopsis" for Grisaia yesterday, before today's episode aired. Meaning, it might be a little off now.

A lot of people in the thread were complaining how they were skipping important parts/leaving out certain things that the VN readers are deeming crucial. As a standalone anime watcher, I can say that nothing feels off at the moment. They are attempting to give each girl a bit of screen-time/character development in order for it to really get rolling, so the "things that are missing" don't seem to vital to me.

That being said, if you are suggesting others to play the game either while watching or afterwards to get the full experience, then I'll take your word for it. Hopefully the show doesn't let you and the other VN readers down too much. But I can safely say as an anime fan that it is pretty darn good so far.
>> ARTICLE
It might seem OK to the naked eye, but when you know what could be, it's just highly disappointing.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta agree with Ataniphor. Today's episode confirmed the adaptation as mediocre at best.
>> ARTICLE
That's sad to hear. Hopefully it's just a small stumble at the moment, and they will manage to adhere more closely to the VN in the coming episodes.

I have no right to say anything (not having read it), but I would suggest just giving it one more episode before writing it off as a bad adaptation. Kind of like a "second chance," if you will.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is, the title of episode 5... we basically know what will happen, and it's an horrible pacing, that's why VN readers are ultra-pissed right now. It's heading towards the 13 episode omnibus ultra-condensed format, and that cannot possibly be good.

I'm going to skip through the episodes as of now, just to see what they're doing and optionally rant,lol. No point in wasting 20mn each week when they're gonna be butchering everything. But yeah, I want be able to pass the word that this is just bad, because I personally love being made aware that an adaptation is poor, motivates me to check the source material before getting spoiled.
>> ARTICLE
>Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works: Must watch it. Kind of obvious, but this one will more than likely be AOTS and perhaps AOTY depending how it goes. Amazing art and animation, rich lore, interesting characters. Just a feast for the eyes at every turn.

I assume I would still need to read the Fate route to get the full experience from this anime?  I'm glad they're skipping Winter season to finish the series so I can catch up during Winter Break.

>Shirobako: Consider it. Showcases the trials and tribulations of anime producing. Nothing really happens, but if you want to know what goes on behind-the-scenes of **your favorite anime**, this one will let you know why it **is shit**.

Fuck you man. >:)

---

Question to all, is Girlfriend: Beta the only moe of the season?  I need my fix of cute girls doing cute things.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, more than likely. The VN is going to give you everything the anime could and more, minus actual movement. :P

>Fuck you man. >:)

Someone caught it! :3

And if we're talking pure cute, I want to say yes. However, Sora no Method's Noel is pretty fricken' "kawaii."
>> ARTICLE
Any point to watching F/SN if you've done the UBW arc in the VN? I haven't picked it up for that reason.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, you get to see it gloriously animated, so the action scenes are very enjoyable and they've also added new scenes too like Rin Vs Illya.
>> ARTICLE
>Yea, more than likely. The VN is going to give you everything the anime could and more, minus actual movement. :P

alright, I'll be more patient ;_; this'll play off.  I just know it.

>And if we're talking pure cute, I want to say yes. However, Sora no Method's Noel is pretty fricken' "kawaii."

That show has been picked up.
>> ARTICLE
> I assume I would still need to read the Fate route to get the full experience from this anime? I'm glad they're skipping Winter season to finish the series so I can catch up during Winter Break.

...Well, yes, for the "full" experience, you'd need to read/watch the Fate route by definition - but it seems like Ufotable's doing a good job of introducing new viewers to the series, with some apparent callbacks to their previous adaptation of Fate/Zero (I haven't seen it).
>> ARTICLE
IDK why gundam anime is always ignored in this sub, is it just me or is there a reason?
>> ARTICLE
I guess the Gundam series is way over-produced for its own good hence receiving the treatment of being "just another Gundam anime". 

Seriously, just look at its [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam#TV_series.2C_films.2C_and_video).

That said, unless there's a new Gundam series that were aimed squarely at adults (the last 3 series, Build Fighters, AGE, Reco, all seems too juvenile) + being very good both in style and setting (and writing), I'm not surprised to see why there aren't really that much interest in the universe at the moment.

Sorry, I don't know. :(

I've never actually seen anything from Gundam before, so I can't say whether or not I would like it.

Shoutout to OP for having Nanatsu no Taizai on the list. It's really great and more people need to be watching it!
>> ARTICLE
Is it really all that good? I really thought the subs were terrible, and it looked to be a generic shounen, so I dropped it 2 episodes in. The princess seemed to be a painfully average character too.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's excellent. It has the look of a generic shonen but if you can get past that I think it's great. Reminds me a lot of old school RPG's like Dragon Quest. The author wrote it that way. It has an adventure story but there's a lot more going on through all the different characters than you'd think. I read the manga to current chapter after seeing the first episode and I am more than excited for it.
>> ARTICLE
I guess  I can ignore the subs and pick it back up
>> ARTICLE
I pretty much agree with everything here. There is a lot of good stuff and things to consider. I think this is going to be my busiest season in years. I'l have to check out Nanatsu. I actually thought it was just an untranslated title of trinity seven and the same show. 
>> ARTICLE
It's packed to the brim with something for everyone, that's for sure.

Can't argue with that, there are just too many to watch! :3
>> ARTICLE
I took a vacation to go to fan fest for FF14 and came back a week and a half later to 60 episodes of stuff...
>> ARTICLE
My policy is usually: 

"yes" with the following question:

"Do you regret it" in which I reply:

"I never regret watching, I just regret unenjoyable ones exist."

Lots of them have something to say and I usually like to hear em out. Sometimes people say something stupid, but it doesn't usually mean I regret talking to them. 

*slight edit to my wording
>> ARTICLE
You would definitely regret watching Amnesia. (And maybe Mahou Sensou.)

It's just such a massive waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately I'm the kind of person who will directly wonder just how much of a time waste it is and why, it's really how I get my kicks. It kinda helps put things in perspective, keep watching gold and it'll start to lose its shine. Good won't seem as good because I've seen better, but if I've seen plenty worse then I can maintain an appreciation for the middle area of quality too.

Everyone jumps on the amazing when it first shows up but not a lot of them stay amazing, few shows up for the bad ones and hardly stick around when it gets good. Because of this habit of mine, I get to enjoy both simply because the bad aren't always that bad.

So I hope you wont take it personal or anything when I say that I may end up watching them anyways some day. It's not like I spend more than a Netflix subscription (and an every now and again crunchyroll sub for season grinding on the sofa). Most of it is pretty much free, so I can afford watch a bad one while I would find myself doing nothing. I can always do something else, but never do.

So why not watch terrible things?
>> ARTICLE
Haha. I can understand watching mediocre shows that have redeeming qualities, but Amnesia is not one of those shows. It's a miracle I even finished it. The main character is probably the most passive character I have seen in anything, ever. The show sets up a mystery from the first episode, and provides a half-assed answer in the very last episode, with no real plot advancement in between.

It's worse than Glasslip.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, great list, I'll make sure to check out the ones that interest me.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the kind words!

There are a lot to choose from, so you shouldn't have any trouble in that department.

Sweet, I watched ep 1 of Sora no Method and wasn't impressed but planned on picking it up eventually and you've given me the encouragement, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Glad I could help! :3
>> ARTICLE
I'm always tempted to do write-ups like this, but [I have shit taste](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/OffColfax) and would probably be completely ignored and then downvoted into oblivion. And I too don't drop anything... with one small exception. I only change a title to Watching if I can complete the first episode. 

There is only one point where I disagree with you. (Not counting the anime that I'm not watching, of course.) I'd boost AmaBiri up to Must Watch status, as it's probably KyoAni's best work since Hyouka and one of my favorites of the season. It is one of my early front-runners for AOTS honors. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't let them downvotes scare you!

Sometimes you just have to embrace the hate. Because your opinion is just as valid as everyone else's. 

ABP would be a *must watch it,* but I don't think it is really doing amazing work in all fields. It's quite good, don't get me wrong, just not amazing or spectacular (at least not yet!).
>> ARTICLE
Welp. Let's just piggy-back on you then.

* Amagi Brilliant Park - KyoAni does what it does well. Interesting character design, decent music, and more plot than PLOT. There's just something about any KyoAni title that speaks volumes to me the instant I sit down and watch it. I have yet to run into a title of theirs that I hate, and I love more than I merely like. Recommended   
* Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Crystal - Much better art style than the original series from 1994. Also 86% less filler than the original monster-of-the-week-style anime. Are they skipping bits? Of course. Does everything make sense? Of course not. But since when did Sailor Moon ever make sense? Recommended  
* Bonjour Koiaji Patisserie - It gets a double-whammy around here for being two of Reddit's least favorite things: a reverse harem and a short. Yet those are the exact themes that make this so interesting to me. And it being a 2-cour makes it all the better.  
* Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai - Mildly ecchi, possibly a harem. I don't encourage anyone to pick it up unless they don't mind those two details. But I don't mind. Hells, I watch worse anime than this for *fun*.  
* Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken - A cute little short, reminiscent of Mangaka-san from Spring. Recommended for all levels of nerds, even if they don't have wives that barely tolerate our habits.
* Denkigai no Honya-san - It's like Working!! and Genshiken had a baby and turned it loose on an unsuspecting world. Recommended.  
* Girl Friend Beta - It's nice to have a simple cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime to watch. No need to worry about the details of 500 years of history or who hates who or whomever it was that killed whomever's teacher... Just sit back with a glass or two of a nice chardonnay and relax and let the cute girls roll by. I wish I could recommend this more, but most people would look at me like I grew a chibi nekomimi out of my left collarbone.  
* Grisaia no Kaijitsu - The jury is still out with me on this one. I don't know, but I secretly suspect that it will become a massively confused clusterkawaiibomb like Mahou Sensou or Brynnhildr. Again... I live for that shit, so I don't mind. But I'd rather it be a good title in the end.
* Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de - Another hybrid in my mind, this time of Chuu2 and GJ-bu. Enjoyable so far, but there's so much room for another of the aforementioned clusterkawaiibombs to develop.  
* Log Horizon 2 - I'm probably the only person here that is watching it to *not* dance to that damn database song. Honestly, I'd rather listen to a nightcore dubstep mix of Cotton Eyed Joe than that. But I won't let my dislike of the OP to lessen my enjoyment of the anime as a whole, which picked up right where it left off with no drop in quality. Recommended.  
* Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season - It is of little value to someone who has yet to watch any Mushishi... But for those of us that have, it is incredible. Recommended.  
* Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ooji - Normally, I'm a sucker for cheesy shoujo romances. But all of the ones I like have love interests that I could see myself sitting down with and talking about girls over a beer or two. I can't see doing that with Sata. He's a dick, and I just hope he changes over the season. It's almost the reverse of Kimi ni Todoke, particularly with the bitchmode friends, and it's killing me inside.  
* Psycho-Pass 2 - I really don't need to talk about this. This is one of the few titles constantly circlejerked around here that I've found to live up to its billing. That and my love for police procedural shows of any type kinda puts it in my interest zone. Recommended.  
* Sanzoku no Musume Ronja - Watched it for Ghibli. And highly disappointed. Even for a G-rated title, it's pretty damn awful. Also-too: It looks like the characters were drawn with MS-Paint. Firmly NOT recommended, and that verdict is killing me inside.  
* Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso - Wonderful art. Beautiful backgrounds. Incredible music. Possible love triangles. It's like WA2 and Nodame Cantabile had a baby. Recommended.  
* ShiroBako - An anime about the production of anime? The meta factor alone should be a significant draw for this crowd, seeing as how we're constantly harping on and on about production values. Now we see a dramatization of how these things all come about, and all some people can do is shit all over it. Nope. Screw that. It's interesting. Dig your heads out of the bloody sands and spend some time looking at something pseudoeducational for a change. Recommended.  
* Sora no Method - Another title that I'm still up in the air about. It could be AnoHana-level great. It could become the second coming of Red.Data.Girl. Only time will tell.  
* Sword Art Online 2 - Unlike the vast circlejerk around here, I still don't mind saying that I like SAO. And I'm even glad to go back to ALO and the land of faeries. (Seriously. That GGO arc was the worst of them all. So. Many. Slow. Pan. Shots. Of. Asses.) Still recommended.  
* Trinity Seven - Yup. You guessed it. Another plausible clusterkawaiibomb. Only I can see this trainwreck coming and would just *love* to be wrong.  
* Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete - When I watch this, I get a very faint Haruhi vibe that is lightly seasoned with a couple of dashes of Kyoukai no Kanata. It has possibilities to meet either ingredient so far.  
* Yama no Susume 2nd Season - Cute. Girls. Climbing. Cute. Mountains. This is so adorable that it almost hurts. Yama no Susume quickly beat out Aiura as my favorite short anime, and the second season is only increasing the lead. Recommended.

So. That's my rundown of the currently airing shows I'm watching. Only 21 titles with 11 of them recommended, but I'm watching enough backcatalog stuff that I'm also on pace to breach the 500-MAL-Entry mark sometime in January. And yes, I have *way* too much free time on my hands. But I'm also up all night at work with nothing to do between 1a and 6a, so I have to find *something* to fill the timeslot.

Makes sense. Since I didn't grow up with the games they are presenting, it makes it hard to have any real "connection" with what they are doing.

We have the exact same top 3 picks for this season. Also thanks for the list, There were a few shows here that i didn't even know about.
>> ARTICLE
Legendary fighters, necro-loli/zombie-chan, and beautiful duets. Our top three even sound good on paper. :)

And you're very welcome! I'm glad I could help you out this season.
>> ARTICLE
I think I actually agree with all your opinions, I just recently gave Shingeki no Bahamut a try and it hasn't disappointed at all. And the point about World Trigger is true as well, although I'm probably still going to watch it with a friend of mine.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, Bahamut is wicked sick at the moment. I really hope it stays at the same level of quality throughout the season. Super enjoyable in every aspect.

World Trigger may need more episodes to really give it a correct "ranking," but yea, from what I've seen so far I am not impressed.
>> ARTICLE
Well bewteen you and the other person you pretty much covered everything except a few shows which is reasonable why you wouldn't watch them since it's not your cup of tea. The shows that wereeft out off the top were Gundam G don't need to harp why they were left out, probably don't like the series. And that dance anime that came out late September that looked different with Cutman staring as the main character from megaman. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe someday I'll watch every single show that a season has to offer.

But today is not that day.
>> ARTICLE
What about Selector Spread WIXOSS?
>> ARTICLE
I think I need to watch this one as well.

The reason why I haven't started watching season two is for the simple reason that I have yet to see season one. :P
>> ARTICLE
WHAT ABOUT GARO!
>> ARTICLE
I'M STARTING IT TONIGHT! :)
>> ARTICLE
There are quite a few anime this season that you should watch but I'd say the only anime that is a must watch is Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis, the art style is something else, the story is really considering what it's based on and the characters are really interesting.

Maybe another that isn't really a must watch and won't be for most for obvious reasons people is Cross Ange, the MC is different from most anime, she got so badass in only 4 episodes. That is really the main reason why it should be on your watch list.
>> ARTICLE
Yep! I'm on the Cross Ange hype train now, with all of its lesbian-rape and douchey MC to boot.
>> ARTICLE
Great little writeup. I look forward to reading your reviews when you finish the shows.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, urban!

Thanks for the kind words. And yea, I'll be getting onto those reviews when these all finish up. Although, this time I have *quite* a few more to do! :P
>> ARTICLE
>World trigger...lackluster animation

Did we watch the same show? calling it "animation" is fairly generous here. I watch it just to see how many times an episode they think they can get away with another 5 second still shot of the MC while he soliloquies in his head. 
>> ARTICLE
Ha, maybe we didn't. :P

I'm trying to be somewhat nice here, man! I harped on it pretty hard after only three episodes.
>> ARTICLE
WHAT ABOUT GUNDAM
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry! No Gundam watching for me. Although people here have gotten me on Cross Ange, which I believe is like Gundam but with a bitchy MC, lesbians, and rape.
>> ARTICLE
Nice, was looking for something like this.
>> ARTICLE
Glad I could be of assistance!
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, I can't really decide why, but it kinda pisses me off that everyone likes Shingeki no Bahamut so much. Probably because I myself can tell that I should like it (and thus am forcing myself to watch it) but can't bring myself to like it at all. Does anyone have any idea why I dislike it? It'd be nice if my brain would provide a reason =_=
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, imo a big part of it is that Bahamut differs from the norm in many ways, but retains an unprecedented quality regardless.  I can see people who really enjoy common tropes and animation styles being a bit off put.
>> ARTICLE
Having thought further on it after reading your reply, I'm pretty sure it's a two-part dislike. First, I completely hate the CG-type stuff. I don't even feel like I want to like that, and it bothers me that a show with otherwise remarkable animation quality has this lame PS2 game CG randomly occurring. (Which also ruins the opening for me.) 

The other is a less concrete reason, but I guess... I find all the characters except the main girl to be really ugly. =\_= and I'm a shallow person, so it's frustrating to watch a show where I'm entirely not attracted to the majority of the characters. \^_\^a That's not really a good reason, I know.

Then again, if it were only the first objection, I wouldn't have continued watching it. Since that one's totally reasonable to me, I wouldn't have bothered deciding I should watch the show anyway. It's just cuz I acknowledge my second reason sucks that I'm making myself watch it lulz. I wonder how many people actually watch a show because they don't like it? XD
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, honestly I rarely notice the CG since the normal animation is so well done.

Ofc I am an extremely forgiving person in terms of CG, it takes some seriously bad CG to even have an effect on me.

As for your second reason, 3shallow5me

And not me at least :P
>> ARTICLE
Maybe you don't like the characters?

A big part of why SnB:G is so good is because the characters just feel unique. Not only in their design but also in the way that they act on their own and with one another.
>> ARTICLE
Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis: Must watch it. The biggest surprise comes from the anime based on a card game. Amazing animation, unique and interesting characters, intriguing world and back-stories. Also, it has the best OP of the season and perhaps the year; easily one of my favorites all-time. Seriously, watch it right now. +1
>> ARTICLE
Just found this post a week late... and suddenly I have a lot more anime on my plate. 

With regards to [World Trigger](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24405/World_Trigger) I have to say I feel let down as well. I think my biggest problem is the main character. Osamu Mikumu... came here to see if it was just me. I think I'm just watching to see more Yuma Kuga, it's like they know the main character is so bad they have another character to facepalm and put things right. I probably will tough it out to see if it gets better.. but certainly worth avoiding if you haven't started it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad I took up on your "must watch it" besides fate/zero (I haven't started this serie so I don't think it's suitable for me to start on this show) because all 3 shows are frigging amazing
>> ARTICLE
Hey, there!

I'm glad you are liking Parasyte, Your Lie In April, and Bahamut! They are pretty darn awesome at the moment. It's really hard to choose which of them stands above the rest since they all do pretty much everything in top form.

Be sure to check for my thread again next season. I'll be doing a similar post at a similar point in the season. I do this for people like you, who need that little extra nudge to check out those "diamonds in the rough."

Finally, thanks for checking my post out! I hope to see you around in those show's threads! :3

Is Akame ga Kill not part of this season? If it is, it should be under the watch it section. 
>> ARTICLE
it is not a fall anime, it is a leftover from last season
>> ARTICLE
My opinions so far:

**Yuuki Yuuna**: *Watch It*. It's essentially Madoka Magica, and there is nothing wrong with that (in fact I might like it more). It is ripping it off a bit too much, right down to even characters looking / acting the same, so hopefully it moves off more in it's own direction. The animation is alright but could use work as the character designs just feel generic Moe, and the fight scenes (which are well-directed) have randomly spliced in moments of CG that feel really odd.

**World Trigger**: *Drop It*. While I say drop it, and on pretty much all accounts its mediocre, for reasons I cannot describe I'm still watching it. It's a pretty pleasant waste of time I suppose, so I'm going to stick with it. 

**Sora no Method**: *Consider It*. While I'm thouroghly enjoying the incredibly well done and nice looking animation, along with some really interesting and unique shot direction, the story itself can either go up or down from here on out. The character conflict feels a little ridiculous and irritating as it basically boils down to being able to be solved in literally 5 seconds if they talked about it. It also is a bit melodramatic, and I personally don't like how weak-willed the MC is.

**Akatsuki no Yona**: *Watch it*. This may just be my favorite out of what I've seen. The great action sequences and interesting characters and setting. I just really enjoy watching it from start to finish every episode and have been eagerly looking forward to it. 

**Log Horizon S2**: *Watch it*. It's more Log Horizon. Weaker animation aside, it's still good.

**Girlfriend**: *Drop It*. I could barely sit through the first episode of this drivel (and I was skipping around). It's just boring.

**Your Lie in April**: *Consider It*. Not as on board with the hype train on this one as everyone else is. It's melodramatic and also painfully obvious, and the most recent plot development feels like a cheap way to generate drama. It's good, but I'm still skeptical. The animation as well is far from perfect. It's not very smooth or consistent, I'm not a fan of that style of character design, and even the musical sequences looked kind of choppy / off. Also they used CG for the entire piano sequence in the latest episode and that was really off putting. 

**Wolf Girl and Black Prince**: *Consider It*. If you like Shoujo Romance, you'll enjoy this. A pleasantly quick developing romance with some cringeworthy lies. I really enjoyed how both the girl and guy are equally dislike-able (in a good way!) and thusly perfect for each other. It's nothing special, but it's enjoyable.

**Inou-Battle**: *Consider It*. I personally am not a fan of the harem genre, and initially the first episode made me think it would be another "My anime based on a light novel can't possibly be this generic!", but the second episode surprised me with clever humor and enjoyable romance. I'm still shaky about it considering how prevalent lack of real character progression is in Harem anime. 

**DENKI-GAI**: *Consider It*. I liked episode 1 and 4, I didn't particularly enjoy episodes 2 and 3 very much. The way they mix the heartfelt moments and the humorous ones feels a bit jarring, and overall the pacing could use some work. As well as that, I don't really like ecchi so those bits are wasted on me.

**I can't understand what my husband is saying**: *Watch it*. Honestly put, this is one of the most compelling relationships between a married couple I've seen in anime. It's humor is crazy and really fast. If anything,  this one line from the show should convince you to watch it: "Co** o* destiny!"

**SHIROBAKO**: *Watch it*. While the animation is far from P.A.'s best , it's still a very enjoyable introspective into the animation genre, and makes good use of buildup and payoff. The characters are fun and feels like a little more than just cute girls doing cute things (and does have a fairly prominent male cast). 

**Karen-Senki**: *Drop It*. It sucks. Like it really is terrible, laughably so. The animation is pretty good, but even that often looks stiff and awkward as anime-style CG often does, and the action sequences are terribly chorea graphed and feel like some teenager watched The Matrix and thought "I can do that!" The story, scriptwriting, direction, and scene direction are all terrible as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Well said. But I'm surprised that you find Your Lie In April's animation to be weak. The violin scene (at least Kaori) was beautifully animated. So much so that the scenes afterwards had to take a dip in quality in order to compensate for how much money they blew on that segment! :P
>> ARTICLE
I had a particular scene in mind when I mentioned that. During the violin sequence, when she's playing really fast looked choppy to me. Her movements felt a little 'off', like they were missing inbetween frames on occasion. It's not bad, but it's no Sakamichi no Apollon in that aspect (I know Sakamichi used rotoscoping, I don't know about this show.)

[here's the video of the performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVYVcNt8F9k)

The main particular moment that seemed off to me: 2:00-2:07

>> ARTICLE
The twintails was too much for me i droped it. i think you were harsh on world trigger.

For me this World Trigger is special, it's a classic shounen with a slow start. Also i think it's the only anime right now that has no sexual reference at all nor nudity. every other anime outthere is just filthy at times or always.
>> ARTICLE
Is it bad that I consider this a plus for every other show outthere? XD
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually glad you voiced your opinion. A lot of what I've seen is hate for the show, and I myself am just not enjoying it.

Maybe I'm being a bit unfair due to how slow it is at setting everything up. Don't worry, I'll be seeing everything that it has to offers, but for those people that are looking for those shows that just immediately grab your attention with any of its facets, World Trigger is not one of them.

Hrmm, I can't agree fully agree with your last statement though. Shows such as Sora no Method, Psycho-Pass 2, and Akatsuki no Yona have (so far) refrained from using sexuality at all.
>> ARTICLE
The opening of World Trigger is so good though. 
>> ARTICLE
World Trigger's OP is good, but that may be its only redeeming quality at the moment.
>> ARTICLE
You do know that twintails is a super sentai parody right?
>> ARTICLE
I love CGDCT, but Girl Friend Beta is just too damn bland.

SeHa girls is great, shaddap. 

I don't understand why Bahamut is getting so much love. It's third ep is the first one that I really enjoyed, the other two I was bored throughout. I dunno, for me it might be Favaro, I find him annoying as fuck. The OP is crap, imo :P.
>> ARTICLE
Girl Friend Beta is rather "meh" in everything but the cuteness, I'll give you that.

I was a Nintendo kid growing up, so I think that's why I have a strong dislike for SeHa. :P

Favaro is annoying as fuck?! He is *refreshing.* Witty, sticks to his laurels, fun, interesting. Just plain unique. The same for the other three. And the OP is crap?!? You're going to give me a heart attack with your slanderous words. That OP is top-tier. I love it to death.

But I respect your opinion, because that's the correct thing to do in this situation (even if you are making me a little bit salty! :3)
>> ARTICLE
Well, you nailed most of the anime descriptions anyway :P. I decided to drop Ushinawareta and keep Daitoshokan, though. Both are pretty bland, but I liked Daitoshokan enough to keep it.

If you *do feel* like watching a quite good anime about cute girls doing cute things (climbing moentains, in this case), pick up Yama no Susume. First season will take you about 30 minutes. Second season has half-length episodes, 15 (14 subbed) episodes aired so far.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Psycho Pass for three minuets before some narration that made me cringe. Is this narration a big part of the show and should I try again?

>> ARTICLE
So I went back to watch the first few minutes of the first episode of the first season! That narration is actually the MC, Akane. Not sure what made you cringe with it, since she is basically talking about the two characters that are meeting there face-to-face.

What transpires afterwards is a tale filled with deception, morality, and not taking things at face value. So, yes, definitely give it another shot. It has one of the best villains in anime, if that entices you!

Appreciate the insight. Ill watch it.

Yeh, I can agree with em all xD

U r considering to watch too many bad animes. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe to *you.*

But you may be right. It's unfair to say if anything is outright good or bad like this, since the shows have yet to be completed in their entirety, but I feel it is always better to give shows at least a shot.

That's why I ranked them out of four instead of three. Some are more "worthy" than others, but in the end, it is up to the viewer to decide what he watches.

I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.

i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.
>> ARTICLE
Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

>> ARTICLE
How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.

Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.

Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.

Why do we need this thread posted every week?
>> ARTICLE
I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.
>> ARTICLE
I will say this does illustrate the recency bias people have. Statistically speaking, what are the odds that the last two seasons have produced 3 of the Top 10? Even when you consider that most people don't watch anime older than 10 years old, unless it's a classic (NGE, Bebop, Utena, GitS, original Gundam for example) this does seem pretty skewed. 

In my experience, it might be because people have a tendency to rate airing anime against each other, rather than against their whole list. I know I've had to adjust scores after considering my own tendency to do this. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call 00 "original Gundam".  While it's definitely no G Reco or Iron Blooded Orphans, it's not as old as Zeta or anything that age.  Most of the alternate era series have a similar feel to em, like 00, Seed, and current stuff, than the original Universal Century stuff does. 
>> ARTICLE
On the contrary, I'd argue that it's because the popularity of anime makes it so that recent shows get bigger budgets.  The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

There's also the matter that recent shows are likely to be more in line with the tastes of a modern viewer.

These, and various other reasons, are why recent shows tend to get better reviews than older ones.
>> ARTICLE
>The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

The voice acting and music are as good as they've always been, or at least since late 80s. As for the art, I think that in 2005-2008 the studios have mastered digital production and can produce steady high quality animation unless they rush things or cut the budget.

>> ARTICLE
Good points, though I'd argue that English dubs are still improving and have still got a long way to go compared to Japanese VAs.

OSTs have been getting better though - if only because the budgets are bigger.
>> ARTICLE
I think the recency bias has more to it than people just snubbing older series though

1) Older series are just harder to come by on the streaming services. Even if they are on there, you have to really dig through all the recent series to get there. Streaming services tend to push their Simulcasts to justify their licensing expenses

2) Anime crowd skews young. People watch anime of their age before earlier ones. I watched anime from 1995-1999. It wasn't until 2011 that I caught up to things from the 80s and 70s (though I did watch Mazinger-Z and Voltes V in the 90s). 

3) People who HAVE seen those might have moved on to something else in their life, and thus are never really around to mention it enough in today's anime communities, because while they were good, there just wasn't *enough* about them to talk about for 10-20 years. *Pivotal* series like NGE and Cowboy Bebop have been talked about and dissected for so long, particularly in the West, they're just ingrained in the community's collective memory. 

Other series just don't have the same staying power, unless they're a genre defining series. 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu? Meanwhile, how many people will still be talking about Madoka, K-On, Monogatari, and JoJo? Now think about how many Shirobakos, Syokugekis, and Shigatsus there have been in the 20 years since 1995, and have since been forgotten. That contributes *immensely* to recency bias. 
>> ARTICLE
> 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu?

Not sure about Syokugeki, but the other two yes absolutely. Shigatsu will at least have the staying power of Anohana (5 years) or Angel Beats! (6 years).

Or possibly because people have rubbish rating scales and don't actually care about the numbers they slap on.
>> ARTICLE
But of course you, with your omnipotent, perfectly refined taste, would never do such a thing. /s 

Elitism much? 
>> ARTICLE
No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale. I've seen /u/JexInfinite 's opinion parroted many times in this subreddit, no idea where you're getting the "elitism" claim from.
>> ARTICLE
> No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale.

Its not just people. The entire rating industry had moved toward a 6/7-10 rating scale. 6 these days means terrible, 7 average, 8 good, 9 great, 10 fantastic.

Its just normal. You looking at almost all game or movie ratings, they conform to the warped rating scale. Its just how it is. I think it ultimately came from the academic grading system, where a 50% is a fail, so anything under 5/10 is meaningless.

There is really no point complaining about people using the most common system of rating. 
>> ARTICLE
I vote on a binary "Did I enjoy it or not?" scale.  either an anime gets a 10 or a 1.  
>> ARTICLE
Those people typically are the people less experienced in anime tend to gravitate heavily towards the popular or new shows and slap high numbers on everything because they haven't seen much else and it's all unique and new

This is probably seen in practice by me personally with Gundam 00 vs. Code Geass. Both very similar in quality and plot from the same age, from the same studio. I enjoyed Gundam a lot more but they're two shows in practice which I would see having almost the same score if they were equally popular

But most of the people who've seen 10 shows and given 10 to all of them have seen Code Geass due to popularity and being recommended everywhere. Most of these haven't watched or heard much of Gundam so it has a far fairer score
>> ARTICLE
I've heard of gundam all my life, but it was only after I came to /r/anime that I first heard of Code Geass - so if anything, I'd argue that the bias would go the other way.

Still, as you say, I honestly still don't see what's so good about Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
And this is why I don't rate my list at all :\

I don't rate my list either for the most part, but some notable shows I'll put a 9 or 10 for reference

I think that's more a result of people not watching anime they know are going to be trash. If something doesn't warrant even a 5 from the people who've already watched it, it's hardly going to garner much viewership from everyone else.
>> ARTICLE
I rate everything I watch a 10, so I'm part of the problem.
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of snobby edgelords on this sub who think you're a scrub if you have an average score over 6. Pay them no mind. If you like something, score it whatever the hell you want. 

Just keep in mind how good you think it is compared to ALL the shows you've seen, not just the recent ones. 
>> ARTICLE
Average score means nothing if you don't know what shows they rate. Some people only watch good shows. You're suggesting that scores be on a bell curve, but I deny this. If a show is good, it is good. The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.
>> ARTICLE
I rate on a bell curve, but the curve is centred around 7.5. Most shows on my list is rated 7 or 8. I simply try to avoid shows if before watching I feel that there's no chance for me to rate the show 8. Life is too short to watch mediocre anime (or read mediocre books, or watch mediocre movies, or play mediocre games), so I don't even bother.
>> ARTICLE
My MAL graph just coincidentally happens to be somewhat resembling of a bell curve, but I would never intentionally adjust the score to fit with everything else. I look at each individual show/movie as its own thing when rating.
>> ARTICLE
> The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.

This is why I kept my "10" rating for Attack on Titan even after seeing much better shows. I just love it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it does, the point of 10 point systems is for it to be relative to other entries 
>> ARTICLE
> Some people only watch good shows.

Yeah, this is sort of the justification I give for rating 10 across the board. I pick what I watch very carefully so that I know I'll enjoy whatever I invest my time in.
>> ARTICLE
So, you've either seen up to 15 shows, or are really generous with scores.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I'm just easy to please. Then again, I've seen no more then 60 shows so I haven't consumed anywhere near as much as material as the average MAL user.
>> ARTICLE
yes, this. Plus from what I've seen from over 20 years of watching, anime *has* gotten better. It'd be dumb to normalize your score to the "average" anime when that average keeps going up every year. 

Instead, I normalize mine to the status quo of being bored. If an anime entertains me even a little bit, it gets a 6. If it makes me feel like I wasted my time, it gets 4 or below. I rarely finish shows that are 5 or below. 

PLUS, people by and large operate based off of recommendations. Essentially normalizing to the average *of what you've seen* is just grading how accurate people's recommendations were to you, which is counter to the spirit of ratings. 

Grading on a bell curve will make sense *only* if you select your anime to watch randomly.
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is a fantastic show because of how it did something completely new. It created several character archetypes which didn't previously exist. Just because those archetypes are now overused and everywhere, it doesn't diminish the value of how they originally affected the industry.

Akira is another example of something that was ahead of its time, but isn't necessary up to today's standard of quality. (I would argue that it absolutely is, but that's beside the point.)
>> ARTICLE
Technically, NGE didn't create archetypes, it just morphed them slightly and made tsundere/kuudere (Asuka vs Rei) more popular. 
>> ARTICLE
Less popular shows get less views, which means less ratings, which means less popularity. It's a loop.

Then there are people like me who just don't have time to watch terrible shows and just stick with what're regarded as "good" shows. What happens then is that my ratings get inflated because I don't watch enough bad shows.

Also the fact that Gunbuster isn't on the list is really sad, that show has probably the best ending of all time (I cry every time the colour hits in!)

Unicorn is rated way higher than 00 and 08th MS Team is pretty close, they just aren't on this list due to OP's weird-ass criteria. They both fit easily into less than 2 cours, he probably just doesn't know exactly how entries of UC Gundam relate to each other and considers it a continuous story, so he only included AUs when making this.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam 00 needs to be removed from this list as it has 2 seasons of 2 cours each.

Though Build Fighters and Build Fighters Try might exploit the rule 2 loophole tho...
>> ARTICLE
I think Kill la Kill deserves better than 58^th.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill. Huh, I must have missed Gurren Lagann....

*re-reads three times*

He hasn't watched Gurren Lagann.

And I think Sakurasou should not be on that list at all. But what can you do with essentially a popularity list.
>> ARTICLE
how is kill la kill not better than zankyou no terror man... 

[](#torrentialdownpour)
>> ARTICLE
I still don't get how there's such a gap between Gurren Lagann and KLK on MAL....
>> ARTICLE
KLK only has boobs

Gurrenn Lagann has boobs AND giant robots.

Also I have to feel that an adolescent male protagonist is more relatable to the target audience of both series than a snarky female. 
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill has a *lot* of boobs, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's also part of the Gainax bias...though I agree Gurren Lagann was better crafted & planned out story-wise, Kill La Kill was more enjoyable and the ending=far less a base-breaker with the fans.
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of relative quality, you can't deny that Gurren Lagann is much more approachable to a wide audience than KLK. I feel like that has to be part of it. I also feel that Gurren Lagann was just plain better, for action, themes, and characters. (This isn't an insult to Kill La Kill. I *love* Kill La Kill)
>> ARTICLE
No Outlaw star, Gundam 08th MS team, Gundam war in the pocket,  The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, Gurren Lagann, and Gunbuster all missing from this list. It is funny how skewed toward recency MAL ratings are. 
>> ARTICLE
1) Recent anime are more easily available from streaming services

2) Anime crowd tends to skew young. A lot of people who watched anime, don't anymore

3) hardly anyone mentions those series anymore

There are not many people who would have seen those things you list, and if they have, they probably won't be on MAL now.

People aren't just thumbing their nose at older anime. It's more likely people just don't know about it
>> ARTICLE
Yea I know they arent thumbing there nose, but it is such a shame since there are so many good anime from not that long ago. Movies dont seem to have these issues though on IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes(for the reasons you listed I guess).
>> ARTICLE
well, it's a lot easier to obtain old movies legally than it is to obtain old anime too. Older anime are basically a niche within a niche at this point, and a lot of their distribution rights are held by IP trolls. A better comparison is non-American movies (or movies whose market was never intended to be the American public), and there is absolutely a parallel recency bias there.
>> ARTICLE
Madness, someone else who's watched Captain Tylor?!
>> ARTICLE
Seems there are so few of us these days. One of the funniest anime ever made.

TTGL didn't make it because it's 27 episodes. OP just couldn't bring themselves to make an exception I guess.

Yea thats a mistake imo since it is only 27 if you count an episode that isnt really an episode(recap).

Why is One Punch Man so popular? It wasn't that amazingly mind blowing...
>> ARTICLE
recency and hype bias. Just like Erased and Rakugo. Both great shows, but not top 10 material
>> ARTICLE
Did you like Konosuba?
>> ARTICLE
I loved konosuba lol The comedy in that show was some of the best I've seen, although I havn't seen that many comedy shows. I honestly found it way more enjoyable than One Punch in my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Both of them are parody shows with stupid yet funny comedy. But I think opm was better overall. Better story, better comedy and better characters. The only good character that came out of konosuba was Kazuma imo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its different for everyone. I just thought the gags/silliness was a lot funnier in konosuba 
>> ARTICLE
OPM has top notch fight scenes with amazing fight direction, an awesome soundtrack, interesting characters, some shounen subversion elements, and most of the comedy was on point. It has almost everything you could want from a light-hearted action series. That's all some people want in a show, so to them it's perfect.
>> ARTICLE
New "twist" on the regular superhero story, cool and likable side characters, competent pacing, interesting setting, great animation & art, good soundtrack, and many people found the comedy to be pretty funny.

It was also a show that I'd say got better as it went along. It started out kinda cool but got more interesting with the Hero Association, got more intense with the Sea King arc, and the Boros fight was the best part of the show and a great finale. I can see why a majority of people would enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty enjoyable myself. I just don't see why people give it a 10/10 when the show barely had any story. My friend gave OPM a 10/10 yet FMA Brotherhood an 8... I just don't understand how its a master piece with such a high rating  lol
>> ARTICLE
Seems you're focusing on a pointless rating system.
>> ARTICLE
Well its not really that, its just people calling it a masterpiece like its the greatest thing is what I don't understand. It was good but nothing that made me say damn that was so amazing greatest thing I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
That's precisely my point. You're focused on a show rated at a 10 being objectively better than an 8, which really couldn't be further from the truth. The entire rating system is a shitshow precisely because people reduce extremely subjective shows to an extremely objective method of comparing them, and completely ignore what makes them unique.

As far as this specific example, I can see why someone would enjoy OPM so much. Its short, sweet, and just a lot of fun. No fat on the story. good visuals. most importantly, its fun, light entertainment. Its not one of my favourite shows, but I can see why someone enjoys it so much.
>> ARTICLE
FMA is quite a bit different than OPM. It's quite a bit more serious (at most points) and can certainly take on a darker tone in some parts. It's also not trying to be subversive. It's a straight up shounen that takes itself more serious than most and with a much more focused narrative. For some people this makes FMA better, for others it's not as much what they're looking for.
>> ARTICLE
Ratings are subjective and a lot of people just enjoyed the show. I don't think there really needs to be much more than that. IMO not having a big in-depth story isn't an issue if it is still one of the most enjoyable shows I've watched. At the end of the day it just comes down to how people rate things and the easiest way to rate something is by how much you enjoyed watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Rating on enjoyment is so much more subjective than rating the actual show (eg characters, plot, themes, soundtrack, animation).
>> ARTICLE
Obviously, but every rating is going to be subjective anyways. In addition you could have the most well written characters and the best objective quality story in existence, but people may not enjoy it. Personally I find just as much value in a review based purely on how much someone enjoyed something as a review that is trying to be objective. At the end of the day I don't care how good something is if I don't enjoy it, and I don't care how bad something is if I do enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I find reviews based on enjoyment to be utterly useless. I can never experience that enjoyment the same way, if at all. What I *can* experience is the characters, plot, soundtrack, etc. Rating and reviewing based on things that are actually in the show rather than how a show made you feel is a lot more logical, and produces scores that have meaning.
>> ARTICLE
But like I said even those things are subjective. Where I see a good character another may see an insufferable twat. Everyone has differing tastes in music, so a soundtrack may be good but still may not be anything you would enjoy. I would think rating the plot would be the easiest to do "objectively", but even then it is usually going to be based on prior experience. When you've watched/read hundreds of shows/books it will be a lot harder to find an original plot that stands out, but for someone without much experience an average or mediocre plot may be amazing.

IMO no review by some random person online is very helpful regardless of the criteria used. A review only becomes truly helpful once you've begun to understand the context the reviewer is looking at the work through. If you have totally different opinions on what constitutes a good character, or anything else, then a reviewer saying that a character is great means nothing to you. Until I understand a reviewer I take their reviews with a huge grain of salt.
>> ARTICLE
Subjective, obviously, but other people are able to witness and experience them. *Nobody* else can experience how the show made you feel, so it's a useless point.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody can tell me for certain how I'm going to feel, but a ton of people can make accurate predictions based on how they felt. If a lot of people think something is sad/funny/enjoyable then I will most likely have the same experience. The whole basis of an averaged score on a site like MAL is that most people will fall in line with the average. If something is rated a 7, regardless of the reasons but as long as those people were as honest as possible, the majority of people will like it but not love it. Maybe you have some particular tastes, but then you can just find a reviewer with tastes more similar to your own. Like on Steam there are curators or, I imagine, the clubs on MAL.

To get back to the original topic of OPM being highly rated, I don't think most people care about an in-depth story. Most people can find plenty of enjoyment in a lacking product, and OPM is executed extremely well in all other aspects. In addition it isn't like it has a bad story - it simply has very little story which I see no problem with. I mean it works for Dark Souls right?
>> ARTICLE
Does your friend rate on personal enjoyment?
>> ARTICLE
Quite clearly, he would. If OPM is higher, it could only be because he enjoyed it more.
>> ARTICLE
When I asked him he just said FMA was "alright" lol
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like it wasn't for him.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm well I think you have to look at it differently. One Punch Man is trying to accomplish different things than FMA. How well does each accomplish what they set out to do? Personally I think OPM does a better job even if FMA has a more ambitious story. More story doesn't automatically make something superior. There are many other aspects to consider. 
>> ARTICLE
The amount of story it had was perfect for the atmosphere the show was trying to create. Not every show has to have super in-depth character backgrounds to be a masterpiece. Dragging out the story would've slowed down the show too much to keep it interesting imo.

At the end of the day it was a really fun show with great music, visuals, comedic timing, and amazing fight scenes. What more do you need?
>> ARTICLE
There was no goal from what I remember with the show? It was just this monster showed up, he goes to fight it. Again I still enjoyed the show I just feel like its way over hyped imo 
>> ARTICLE
IMO part of what makes the show interesting is that the villains are the ones trying to achieve some goal (and get all the power up sequences and other tropey things) instead of Saitama. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably because of the hype. I really like OPM, but I don't think it was a masterpiece as a lot of people claim, the anime was really good and had nice animation, but the best part of the story is still in the webcomics in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind
>> ARTICLE
It's almost like people can have their own opinions and whatnot.
>> ARTICLE
While I can't say I'd give OPM anything above 9 I can easily see why FMA:B would get 8. It's somewhat too long for the story it's telling and has its share of shonen tropes. They're not bad per se, but it's not the masterpiece of deep writing as well.
>> ARTICLE
For me random comedy scenes killed FMA and also Brotherhood . OPM was solid and honestly fun story not the best but worth watching .

Also I think that about  half of shows on this list are overhyped but my it's just my opinion . Maybe it's becouse I like SoL , Drama and Fantasy stories more
>> ARTICLE
eh, the random comedy scenes brought FMA down to earth for me. It's just that FMA had less of those than FMA:B because of the shorter run...
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind

A show doesn't need to have a story if it's not necessary. In OPM having a continuous narrative wasn't necessary since it was a gag comedy.
>> ARTICLE
that would all good if it was actually funny.  Unfortunately it was all too happy making the same joke over and over.
>> ARTICLE
OPM didn't literally have only one single joke. Yes it had the overlying "one punch" gag but it was used in many different ways, sometimes as a joke and sometimes for a serious moment. Overall the show also had a variety of comedy moments that didn't center around Saitama's gag.
>> ARTICLE
ok, list some examples of other kind of gags.  Maybe I'm missing something, but almost all the gags are just people/villains looking down on the MC, who beats the villain effortlessly.  
>> ARTICLE
[OPM spoilers](/s "In the episode where Saitama and Genos were infiltrating the evil doctors lair, he set traps on every floor in preparation for their arrival. Instead of following the standard "clear the dungeon to the boss" trope Genos just instantly blows up the entire building and they enter the basement from there. This was funny because the viewer wouldn't expect this and it subverts the trope.")

[OPM spoilers](/s "After the "robotic monkey" is defeated he is acting like a hardened badass minion and gives the whole "you'll never defeat X" speech. Once he learns that they were actually defeated he drops the robotic voice and takes on a whole different persona asking to be spared. He says that the robotic voice and attitude was him just trying to sound cool. This is funny because it was unexpected at the time and surprises the viewer.")

I could keep going and pull out every single one liner from every single episode that either got a chuckle or an outloud laugh from me but I think you see the point. Every episode didn't have 20 minutes of nothing happening until one single joke about a single punch was pulled at the end. The episodes were lined with small to larger jokes derived from the characters speeches, interactions among each other, and actions in the world they were in which all worked together and created the overall comedic tone/atmosphere of the show.
>> ARTICLE
that's just another variation of the same "Saitama is too powerful" gag, the other being an example of "villains acting all arrogant until they are put in their place by Saitama, who is too powerful" gag
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling you don't really want to be proven wrong. 

Look at his first example, how does that fall under the "single gag" at all? Second example, doesn't fall under the "single gag" either.

These examples are pretty far from the "saitama too strong" gag, so unless you are unfamiliar with the references, its likely pretty clear to most that this isn't a single gag show
>> ARTICLE
And as a variation they're different, they're unique with the characters interacting in different ways which isn't boring or uninteresting for the viewer. 
>> ARTICLE
[Saitama's impatience when it comes to monologuing](http://40.media.tumblr.com/7d6f2f56643914b392c1d249aa7f8ea5/tumblr_nwpsrfFOUb1u77epio1_500.jpg), and his [lackadaisical attitude](http://i.imgur.com/zdAJyD1.jpg) are two examples of gags in the show that isn't just the one punch gag. Genos constantly getting turned to modern art, the weird backstories for each villain, the strange character designs for each villain (I mean fucking look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/JJzfkFL.png) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/5qG4z0B.jpg)), [or even just the absurdity of certain situations in the show.](http://gfycat.com/PoshHelpfulIberianbarbel)

On the whole, the comedic situations he's placed in make [Saitama a](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/3wwk6k/anime_irl/?) [very](http://i.imgur.com/8GtTdCl.jpg) [relatable character](https://i.imgur.com/ixk3nTm.jpg) with the added bonus of just being hilarious in general. This is why I can't quite understand why people say the show only has the One Punch gag, it's a comedy with a varied arsenal of jokes to tell, yet for some reason people just say "LEL ONE GAG MAN".
>> ARTICLE
> monologuing

That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.  

>lackadaisical attitude

If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too.  What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.


> modern art

don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

> LEL ONE GAG MAN

personally, I would go with One Punchline Man
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why I tried to give examples, you're actively trying to not have fun with the anime, and that's why the comedy doesn't work with you.

>That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.

Not with most other characters in any fictional media. Most would listen to the long backstory without saying a word, so no, I wouldn't quite say it's a "natural reaction".

>If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too. What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.

Again, the point is that this is abnormal for a main character of a show. Does Superman act like that? No. To give a currently airing show as an example, does All-Mighty act like that? No. These are the characters Saitama is parodying because they're so common, and his character type as MC is so uncommon. See, this is what I mean by the fact that you're actively fighting against this anime tooth and nail in order to not have fun with it. Everyone else sees Saitama as unique and funny, yet you're sitting over here trying to jump through mental hoops to see him as this normal character that is totally obvious to write as the MC of a superhero show.

>don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

"Oh my god, they killed Kenny!" ~ Line from a TV show that made millions laugh all around the world.

You don't even bother acknowledging anything else I mentioned, so what was the point in responding?
>> ARTICLE
tbh, the fact that it was nothing but a gag comedy for the first 5 episodes made me question where the hype is coming from. I mean yeah, it was hilarious, but it was the anime equivalent of Chocolate Mint flavor ice cream: you don't get it too often, it's pretty good, but ultimately nothing to be excited about.

The last 7 episodes though, made me think "oh, this was what manga readers were hyping it up for"

Still though, I have to think a fair bit of that was casual anime-only people just parroting the manga hype. 
>> ARTICLE
Seconded. I personally think that OPM stands out from the current arc being covered by the manga 'til the end of that arc in the webcomic. [OPM end of latest finished webcomic arc spoilers](/s "Sweet Mask obsessing over Saitama's power after thrashing Garou gave me chills. That, and whenever he shows up with his High Rank Harem.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think most people claim it as a masterpiece, it was just a really fun show with a good "hype" factor.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe not in anime communities, but people who don't watch much anime tend to overhype it a lot (look at its IMDB rating).
>> ARTICLE
it's because it's the "not anime anime". People who saw DBZ and thought it was dumb come to this and say "OH MY GOD, IT'S SO AMAZING".

Well there sure is a lot of trash, but at least there is also a lot of pretty good stuff.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure I would have NGE on this list since EoE is more or less required watching.

It kinda is, but the ending, as little sense as it makes, also does its own job of giving closure to the series.

I agree, but EoE just adds so much both in clarity and thematics, combined with it being the originally intended ending till they ran out of budget makes it add so damn much to the series.

For me it was hard to convince myself to watch it, but when I did, I loved it.  It was a pretty weird experience, that's never happened to me before, but I would definitely recommend watching it.

But what about the culture aspect of the show? Because i dont know jack about the stage comedy storytelling aspect of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Mmm honestly it doesn't really matter. All the stories are self contained, so if there is additional backstory to it, it's not really necessary.  The important parts of the show are generally not the actual performances, and that's where the gold is. The stories are good, but the characters make it great.

I'm not 100% of the details but it's available at fuwanovel I believe. 
>> ARTICLE
What about Fate/Zero? Should I watch that before Fate/Stay or after?
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero before Fate/Stay Night is ~~like~~ worse than Star Wars Episodes I-III before the original trilogy.
>> ARTICLE
After. The original way was the Visual Novel (FSN) then there was the Light novel (FZ). Ufotable made Fate/Zero with the assumption that people saw the original FSN anime, which is considered mediocre. That covered the Fate route of the FSN visual novel. FSN as a VN has three routes, Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven's Feel. Like I said, Fate was the original anime (by studio Deen) and is considered mediocre. So the best way to do it would probably be:

>Fate Stay Night Visual: Fate route

>Fate stay night Anime by Ufotable: First Unlimited Blade Works then Heaven's Feel

>Fate/Zero anime

Then if you want you can watch the Deen FSN anime.
>> ARTICLE
I find the general consensus to be that you should watch F/SN before F/Z since it spoils less compared to the other way around and that was the order in which they were written.

In my opinion though, a spoiled F/Z ruins suspense (the conclusion of a few things are already determined) while a spoiled F/SN has its asspulls justified (the background of some characters). Of course, I'm not saying this is the case for all the spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's what I meant. He asked if he should watch F/Z before or after F/SN and I said after :p
>> ARTICLE
What my comment was saying was that watching F/Z before has its merits as well, though. Possibly better ones, too, but I can't be the judge of that.
>> ARTICLE
Oh. My bad, I misread your comment.
>> ARTICLE
I know it isn't popular, but I can't wait to watch Magic Kaito!
>> ARTICLE
Yes. I'm glad that the anime will have 24 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, no offense, but you're the first person to seem excited for it. What's it all about? I didn't really look into it that much.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's because I'm a huge Detective Conan fan. And in the series, Kaito Kid makes a guest appearance (same mangaka). 

He's is just like Shinichi Kudo, clever and cunning.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. I've never seen Detective Conan either, but maybe I'll check it out. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I plan on watching Parasyte (read the manga and I love Madhouse) and Psycho Pass season 2, what else do other people think will be worth watching?
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte and Psycho-Pass 2 are big ones. 

Other than that, I'm watching Fate/stay night, Log Horizon S2, Chaika S2, WIXOSS S2, and Amagi Brilliant Park for sure. I might check out Twintails, Terra Formars, World Trigger, and Grisaia if it's good. I'm worried about Grisaia though.

Too bad Studio Deen is doing Log Horizon S2..
And Production I.G. isn't doing Psycho Pass S2...
>> ARTICLE
It's alright for LH2, as it's the exact same staff so there shouldn't be a problem in that regard.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not really that worried about LH being done by Deen. Sakura Trick didn't look too bad. Who's doing Psycho Pass S2?
>> ARTICLE
Tatsunoko Production. I haven't seen anything they've done I don't think

edit: they did Ping Pong which I've heard is great
>> ARTICLE
Oh, if it's them then I don't mind IG not doing it at all. That has the potential to be amazing.

[Yozakura Quartet](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18497/Yozakura_Quartet:_Hana_no_Uta) 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, all of my worries have just vanished in a single gif.
>> ARTICLE
Ryo-Chimo is an extremely talented animator and director, one of the reasons why **Hana no Uta** was such a great series.

The studio's more recent works also include **Ping Pong** (with Yuasa's style) and **Gatchaman CROWDS**. All fantastic series from the past year.
>> ARTICLE
Tatsunoko isn't some new studio - they've been around since the 60s. Production IG actually was basically created by Tatsunoko producers with the staff that had made the anime [Zillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillion_(anime%29) for Tatsunoko, and Production IG does own around 11% of Tatsunoko.

Like other big anime studios that have made tons of anime (of which a fair amount is children's anime), their quality of animation in Tatsunoko works can be hit-or-miss. It really depends on the series. I would imagine that Psycho-Pass 2 will get enough resources to be a well-animated series.
>> ARTICLE
This is cool. Thanks for putting this together.

Going to be watching Parasyte, Wixoss, Log Horizon, Fate/Stay, Psycho Pass and will probably check out Twintail since I was real into Kore wa Zombie and this sounds kind of similar.
>> ARTICLE
No problem! I'm going to try out a lot.
>> ARTICLE
I like this season - seems I have something to watch pretty much every day, of course I might drop some of them, but still promising.
>> ARTICLE
Has anyone heard anything good or bad about the new Gundam Series? Gundam SEED is probably my favorite anime, having another Gundam series just as good (00 was great, but not better than SEED IMO)  would be awesome! 
>> ARTICLE
> Has anyone heard anything good or bad about the new Gundam Series? 

Well, it is an original story (like other Gundam shows) and it hasn't aired yet... so no one can really say whether it will be good or bad. It is being written & directed by Tomino Yoshiyuki, the original creator of Gundam.
>> ARTICLE
Yea very true, sometimes people hype animes up. I don't pay much attention to any kind of hype at all so I wouldn't know if anyone had an early presumption about how the show will be.
>> ARTICLE
From what I've heard it is the same director as First Gundam (or Gundam 0079), who also did most of the Universal Century series, along with Turn A, and some of the same art-team that did Eureka 7 (even though that was a Bones project). So it looks like the team should be good enough for this series.
>> ARTICLE
I am kinda sad that there's no Gingitsune S2 this fall... I loved it a year ago, and it's what got me into watching anime as they air.

Thanks for writing this up. Far superior to the one I did haha.

So much awesome stuff coming this season but I'm particularly looking forward to the second season of WIXOSS. First one was absolutely thrilling.

I'm guessing the episodes will be on there once they air, at least all the others are there.

I think everyone is excited for it, especially after last season!

Cool, and yeah I'm stoked for this season of Korra.

Anyone know if anyone is simulcasting psyco pass 2?
>> ARTICLE
I'll add it when it gets announced. Probably Funimation.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!!! Yeah I heard funimation might but I was curious if crunchy roll or hulu were going to have it
>> ARTICLE
From the beginning, Psycho-Pass has been Funimation exclusive as far as I know. 
>> ARTICLE
At least two shows every day with a break on Mondays.  Goodbye, productivity.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about you but Shingeki no Bahamut looks surprisingly good in it's trailer. I've also been looking forward to Inou Battle since I'd heard the synopsis earlier this year, so I don't think Monday is anything to scoff at.
>> ARTICLE
Bahamut looks nice but I don't expect it'll have much of a story.  

Hmm, Inou's got Ootsuka directing.  I don't want a lot of harems in my queue but this...  
Alright, if Crunchyroll picks it up I'll watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Terra Formars PV is for the OVA. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I'll change it when I get home from work. I'm on mobile and it won't let me change it out. 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, my upcoming schedule:

* Sun: Seven Deadly Sins
* Mon: Kaito Joker, Orenchi, Bahamut
* Tues: Yona
* Wed: Parasyte
* Thurs: Naruto, Gundam G
* Fri: Fairy Tail, Donten
* Sat: Fate/Stay Night, Vanadis, World Trigger

It looks like Saturday will be the most interesting. I'm still not as hyped up about as many of this season's shows as the summer's; we'll see.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have too much time to watch anime anymore, I watched 3 shows last season SOA, Akame, and Nozaki-kun.  I will continue to watch SOA and Akame, but what is going to be this seasons Nozaki-kun?  Someone tell me!

I love OP so much right now. If I were to measure my amount of love,  it would be around a gallon.

If you kept going to the bottom of the gallon,  you would be literally drowning in love.

So for a guy relatively new to anime what is the must watch in this list? I know Log Horizion 2 and Psycho Pass 2 but what else is 'hyped'.
>> ARTICLE
This is my personal list of hyped shows. 

Fate/stay night, Terra Formars, Amagi Brilliant Park, Legend of Korra Season 4, WIXOSS Season 2, World Trigger and Grisaia no Kajitsu. 

You can ask me anything about these and I'll do my best to answer if you want. 
>> ARTICLE
Fate/stay night do I need to have previous experience with the series. Also I'm hyped as fuck for Kora season 4. 
>> ARTICLE
The best way for fate would be to read the first route of the Visual Novel then watch this anime. The longer version of the preferred order is quite complicated, but if you can't read the visual novel (don't have a computer, etc) then this should be a fine starting point. I can type up the preferred order if you want, but I don't have the time now. Let me know if you want me to and I'll type it up for you later.

Hey, not sure if you heard, but I remembered this post when I saw the new anicharts. Absolute Duo is coming out in Winter!

Yeh thanks for that. Yeh im pretty excited I guess :D
>> ARTICLE
I can't find anywhere that says that it's starting this season except for [this website](http://www.madan-anime.jp/) which seems to be the official website for the show? Kind of weird. No where mentions it in their list (like Livechart doesn't have it). It might have been delayed? I have no clue.  But you can see in the top right corner of that site I posted that it has a bunch of japanese writing (I don't know japanese myself) and it says '2014 10 4' so maybe the fourth?

Drums are included in the "other stuff in", just like your piano etc. My comment made it a bit unclear.

Classic Togashi.
>> ARTICLE
I can't upvote this enough.
>> ARTICLE
Serious question: HxH ? Why? 
>> ARTICLE
Awesome cast of characters, A vast world to explore, great villains and the best character development imo.
The anime ended in a good place where if togashi writes more manga it could open endless possiblities for the show,
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched it and are questioning it? Or have you not watched it?
>> ARTICLE
I have not watch it and was looking for an opinion about it.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because HxH on 2014 had the best year-run of episodes anime has ever seen, with the ending of the anime and especially the ending of the Chimera Ant Arc, best arc in anime history hands down.
>> ARTICLE
If you are in anyway remotely interested or not put off by action/adventures with strategic battles and high episodes counts, I'd say give it a go. In fact I'd say give it a go anyway. 

Hunter x Hunter is a show that starts off good and only gets better with every episode. It's has amazing characters (in particular its villains) that carry an incredible story. There's an over arching plot line but really its "the little detours" our protagonists go on that makes HxH really special. 

I won't tell you what it's actually about because I think it's one of those shows best experienced embarking on the journey from episode one knowing nothing at all. Just a tip though, the second arc (Yorknew city arc) will make you mind up to whether the show is for you or not so if you dont like that arc, there's probably no point watching the next hundred episodes. 

Hope that helped and you decide to watch it. It's not highly acclaimed and AotY contender for nothing.


>> ARTICLE
Thank you. As I am right now picking a new series to watch the ones that have caught my eyes were Legend of the Galactic Heroes or HxH.

Both are lengthy so I didn't want to comit to a large series if it wasn't good at all.

Thanks for the opinion bhvgcf!
>> ARTICLE
would you meteor?
>> ARTICLE
You're welcome :) HxH is one of shows you just gotta share

edit: grammar yo
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching the show a few days ago. I'd say, at the very least watch through the Greed Island arc.  That was probably my 2nd favorite arc.  The Hunter Exam arc was my favorite.  But Greed Island finally starts to give you a taste of Gon's power.  It also has the best ED: "Reason".

The Chimera Ant arc is very, very different from the rest of the show, in my opinion, and dragged on for way too long. It ended extremely well though.

Overall, the show is great, the soundtrack is very good, and there are many cool characters.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. This is pretty much the exact opposite opinion of most fans. The Chimera Ant and Yorkshin arcs are overwhelmingly the most popular, and Greed Island and the Hunter Exam are generally the least popular.

If you really liked the Hunter Exam that much you might be interested in checking out the 1999 version of the show. While everything else may be up for debate, I think most would agree that arc was definitely better in the original.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Greed Island was by far the worst arc for me
>> ARTICLE
That's really interesting to me.

I really don't get why Yorknew is so beloved. I'd rank the Arena arc above that one. The Phantom Troupe had some interesting characters, but they were underutilized.  It revolved around Kurapika mostly, and Kurapika was honestly a pretty boring character to me, despite being voiced by my favorite seiyuu.

The way the Chimera Ant arc wrapped up was fantastic and really surprising to me...but it really changed the tone of the show for me, and it just wasn't fun for me for the first 20 or so episodes of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
YES! Everyone I've met loves the Yorknew arc, and while I wouldnt put it above Heavens Arena, it wasn't very fun. The only interesting parts were the auctions and the [Ep. 50-ish](/s "Kurapika vs. Uvogin fight.") Everything else was mediocre, but maybe that was because I had read up till the very beginning of Greed Island in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, 2011 Hisoka is the best thing to grace anime, without him what's the point?
>> ARTICLE
Greed Island was amazing. Currently on episode 114 (the narration-heavy episodes). So far the Chimera Ant Arc is my favorite. Initially I was put off by it's length and told myself that since it took up almost half the show, it better be pretty damn good. So far I haven't been disappointed. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude get off reddit. If you're on episode 114.. You must continue immediately.

Btw chimera ant arc is my favourite arc but I didnt really start to love it until the final 20 episodes, so if you love it already you're in for a wild ride mate.
>> ARTICLE
The assault was one of the most intense load of episodes I've ever seen.

"Only 30 seconds had passed" but we saw like 5 episodes, it was beautiful.

I gave a quick scroll on the other comments, although I did not watch  Ping Pong yet, I feel confident enough to give my vote to Hunter X Hunter (2011), this revitalisation and also continuation really bought one of my favorite manga and anime series from my childhood back to life. Hisoka is still a creep perv though.
Honorable mention to Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season, one of the few "Sports" anime that is actually great, a step above Prince of Tennis in my opinion. Not sure if sports or battle anime though, the guys from KnB and PoT could easily be in a fighting genre anime with their powers.

Still haven't seen the second half of Wixoss, the first half of Fate, or the terror anime but I feel like those 5 are probably gonna stay in my top list. On my personal list I wouldn't put on Parasyte since it still airing this doesn't count and would add silver spoon instead, but since this subreddit has such terrible taste nobody added on silver spoon. 
>> ARTICLE
You can add Silver Spoon yourself. 
>> ARTICLE
This is such a hard choice, but I have to go with No Game No Life. It is probably in my top 5 anime (yes, I do have shit taste). My other picks would be F/SN UBW, KLK, and Akame ga Kill. Hunter x Hunter is also fantastic.

Ping Pong is overrated, it was good but not that good.. that is my humble opinion at the very least.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, it has extremely well written characters, but almost everything else about the show is rather unremarkable. Or distracting like the art style and animation. The characters carry it to an 8.5  *at best* imho. Aoty for me is Parasyte; HxH had some great parts, but it also had terrible parts(overall probably close to an 8.5 as well). I cant even think of something to complain about Parasyte off the top of my head.
>> ARTICLE
If I were to complain about Parasyte it'd be something along the lines of the side characters being very one-dimensional and undeveloped, but all in all I agree, AOTY 2014.
>> ARTICLE
It's all up to the person if they like it or not, I've heard it's high on Character Development, which is what I want in anime.
>> ARTICLE
It did have impressive character development and the story was good but not even close to as good as people want to make it seem but it's pretty lackluster in the remaining areas, honestly I believe it to be the most overhyped series of 2014... not to say it's bad because it's definitely not.

Ok bye. No ones gonna miss you.

Keep in mind that many people haven't seen Ping Pong, so it would still be understandable even if No Game No Life beat out Ping Pong.

They should have something to compensate for the dependency on having seen it.  It would be interesting if we could see votes and rankings for anime *after* controlling for what anime people had seen in addition to it.  My guess is that more people would pick No Game No Life over Ping Pong, but that if you *controlled for people who had seen both* it would be a lot closer.  That's just one of the demerits of these polls.

2014 felt pretty lackluster for me at least, very few anime above an 8/10.  

That being said Ping Pong and Mushishi were easily the best, if I had to pick a third it would probably be WIXOSS, I just loved the shit out of that series even with all the things wrong with it (more so in the second season). Parasyte deserves a vote from me too but I have a thing against voting for/putting shows in a top list when they aren't complete.

Although I do love HxH, I think other shows like Ping Pong, Haikyu, and Fate were the standouts this year. Personally I think Ping Pong is #1 because of how unique and well done it was. A truly incredible show following the best character development I have ever seen in 11 episodes.

I feel bad voting on this because there were so many shows that I didn't vote for simply because I haven't seen them yet.

There's a big difference between not voting for a show because I haven't seen it and not voting for one because it wasn't good enough, and this poll doesn't capture that.

That said, I fucking loved Kill La Kill and it looks like it might win, so yay.

Does that mean that *only* the HxH episodes from 2014 is what we are voting on as well? If that is the case perhaps you should mention it in the post, because it definitely solidifies my vote for Parasyte over it.

Yes. I just figured it would be common sense, wouldn't it? This is a poll for 2014.

Well yeah i guess that does make sense, but few people on reddit(including myself) use their common sense lol. Anyways, I have a feeling most people would still vote for HxH based on their feelings of the anime *as a whole* instead of just the 2014 episodes even if you did edit the op for clarity.

While Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun was pretty good, I don't think it deserves to be top show of the year (as it currently is ranked). For me the only two choices were Mushi-shi and Your Lie in April.

At the time of this comment, No Game No Life is just about taking the lead.

Two big ones not noticed by OP so i will.


[Log Horizon 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23321/Log_Horizon_2nd_Season):

First 3 ep have been really good especially the raid scenes. Having played multiple MMO's Log Horizon stays close how MMO's are played and should be played. I'm intrested how the story will develop since it can go ANY direction. Database still awsome.

[Psycho-Pass 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23281/Psycho-Pass_2): Watching this show reminded me how much i missed it. Akame has become such a badass and the new enforcers are cool. I hope we get more information about the Sybil system and some background on the enforcers since i believe that was lacking in SEO 1. Opening is awsome just like abnormalize was.
>> ARTICLE
What about Selector Spread Wixoss? The third ep was amazing and the opening itself got me so hyped up for the show. 
>> ARTICLE
The actual progress and action depicted in log horizon make me depressed at how much of a let down the gun gale online arc of SAO was. instead of looking at kurita explain he just killed gunner-x to sinon and off screen we get constant action and explanation which isn't filler repeated to every character individually but instead narrated over ongoing progress.
>> ARTICLE
What does LH have to do with SAO?
>> ARTICLE
kinda similar theme and aired around the same times, both 25 ep's per season, and they generally get compared to each other a lot, despite the characters and actual writing being substantially different.
>> ARTICLE
Both are really good so far, but both are sequels which OP has not seen the original series to.

I left those out because I'm not *truly* watching them. I'm within 4 episodes of the end of each show, which I both like, but I have to complete the first seasons before I start watching those.

>> ARTICLE
no Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu, your missing out AOTS right there.
>> ARTICLE
Dropped it after the first episode. I seriously don't see any humor or value at all in this show. I'm not trying to put it down but I watched the first episode and though "Wow that was terrible" then I come into the discussion to see that everyone loves it and I feel like I'm missing some kind of inside joke. I am legitimately curious, why does everyone like this show?
>> ARTICLE
You get one or two LN adaptations like that every season.  Blame nips for having shit taste.

That being said, the two LN disasters this season are better than Blade Dance (people actually defend this trash unironically) and mahouka.

Inou battle plays every trope which ruins most LN adaptations like Arefureta straight and combines it with the right amount of charm, and Twintails is a great parody of super sentai.


>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it's the "so retarded it's retarded...ly funny?" category of humor.
>> ARTICLE
I considered it being parody but the show feels like it plays it to straight to feel like a parody. Like it could get hyperbolic but at the same time takes itself seriously and feels like it isn't joking about the subject at all. I guess it's just not for me. I did like the professor though from what I remember.
>> ARTICLE
Parody doesn't have to be goofy in *every* respect, and this kind of answers your "why does everyone like this show?" question. Twintails is parody because of how it chooses to fill in the standard sentai tropes and story elements. Humans are valuable not because they have life force or a soul or something else that'll get horribly stolen by the villains, but because they have fetishes. The main character is chosen not because he's courageous or strong, but because his twintail fetish is so strong that he can control a twintail-driven transformation and battle suit. The villains aren't sinister beings here to take over the planet, they're completely innocuous beings simply obsessed with goofy non-sexual fetishes like finding girls holding dolls irresistibly adorable. If you want to go on, just compare everything this show does with its equivalent element in Power Rangers.

A lot of people (including me) find this kind of humor extremely clever. Twintails then has a completely likable cast on top of that, and it manages to be one of the most perverse shows I've watched (and I like perverse humor) without actually containing anything insulting like mindless fanservice.

I wouldn't argue this is a masterpiece of a series or anything, but I feel I could make a strong case for it not just simply being "so stupid it's good". It actually *is* smart at what it's doing, which is at least a little bit remarkable.

EDIT: typos and stuff
>> ARTICLE
Sounds kinda like Daimidaler. (I haven't watched Twintails.)
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Daimidaler, but quite a few people have made the comparison in Twintails' discussion threads, although apparently enjoying Daimidaler is more guilt-inducing than enjoying Twintails.

I wonder why that is... Maybe because Daimidaler has nudity whereas I assume this show does not?

You make a good point, and I agree with you, but for whatever reason I just don't like it and that bothers me. I'm not against this type of humor but it just doesn't click for me and that's probably the first time that's ever happened. Ah well, to each his own.

>> ARTICLE
**Continued**

---

[Sora no Method.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23209/Sora_no_Method) I don't know whether to drop this one or not, frankly. It's got a **Non Non Biyori**-type of feel to it, where nothing really happens, but instead of Candy Store and Ren-chon and an interesting cast of characters, substitute all of those for squeaky mouse-girls and one superbitch. Top that off with teases of some serious mystery in the background, and I am extremely conflicted on this one. Most likely I'll give it a few weeks, then come back and marathon it instead of waiting episode to episode.

---

[Terra Formars.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22687/Terra_Formars) I dropped this one after two episodes. I hear Crunchyroll may soon be getting an uncensored version, at which point I plan on picking it back up, but until then, the censoring is just too atrocious to bother watching it.

---

[Trinity Seven.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25157/Trinity_Seven) Rounding off our hat-trick of unusual and refreshing male harem/romance leads (alongside *Amagi's* Seiya and *Grisaia's* Yuuji) this season, *Trinity's* Arata Kasuga has been consistently entertaining in all three episodes. The female cast also has enough variation away from the cut-and-paste archetypes to keep things fresh. Throw in a half decent plot, and you have a solid show that should stay interesting through the end. ^^^Also,  ^^^episode ^^^2 ^^^was ^^^super ^^^hot, ^^^just ^^^saying.

---

[Ushinawareta Mirai no Motomete.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21845/Ushinawareta_Mirai_wo_Motomete) This is another one I dropped after a single episode. I do plan on going back to watch it at some point and actually give it a proper 3 episodes because it was *mildly* interesting, but as of right now, it's on the back burner.

---

[World Trigger.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24405/World_Trigger) Dropped after two episodes. The abundant still shots, long pauses with no sound, and Yuuma's constant and irritating =3= face put me off this one pretty quickly. Add in the fact that it hadn't really gone anywhere after two episodes and it was an easy drop for me.

---

[Yuuki yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25519/Yuuki_Yuuna_wa_Yuusha_de_Aru) "Oh look, cute girls doing cute things and helping people out in a 'superhero' club. Great, I've never seen this before - wait, what the fuck is going on?" If the discussion threads are to be believed, this one took quite a few people by surprise. If I had to sum it up, I was expecting cute-girls-cute-things crossed with *OreGairu*, but instead I got cute-girls-cute-things crossed with *Evangelion* and *Madoka.* It doesn't seem to be as dark as either *EVA* or *Madoka*, but I like it so far and I'm interested in seeing where it goes.

---

And that's the wrap-up, ladies and gentlemen. Discussion is the point of this thread but criticisms on my writing and style are welcome as well, since I'm rusty and my work needs tuning.

"Shirobako. Cute girls doing cute things making anime. It's nothing special, but it's enjoyable and pleasant. Watch this to calm down after Bahamut or UBW."

I agreed with most of your post...

Until this point. Shirobako is one of the competitors for AOTS for me. It's just a passionate, well made, insightful show.

Or maybe I can just relate to deadline problems.
>> ARTICLE
After watching Shirobako I'm much more motivated to work. How does that classify?
>> ARTICLE
> It's just a passionate, well made, insightful show

Oh yeah for sure, and my statement "nothing special" doesn't mean it *isn't* everything you said, but it's not going to be blowing any minds. Does it have potential to be a great, down to earth show? Yes, for sure. But I don't feel like we're going to see anything revolutionary out of it.
>> ARTICLE
>but it's not going to be blowing any minds.


not in America, yes but in Japan the boards are filling up with this show. The thing with it is the manga only came out last month and promos only showed 5 girls and "lets make anime!". PA works is doing justice with it  and the japanese gen-pop's minds are being blown away by this show, from the drifting in ep 1, the jab at production I.G, the well known anime-industry reps, the realistic harsh work environment and just story telling alone. This show wont be revolutionary in terms of how Action and Meccha anime are but in aspect of slice-of-life and intelligent story telling its doing what it should be.
>> ARTICLE
I see your point, but we may have differing definitions regarding "revolutionary". It's already one of the most refreshing shows I've seen all year, haha.

I'm half-serious about the deadlines part though. Working in the software development industry, some of the events in episodes 2 and 3 rang eerily close to home.
>> ARTICLE
Just wanted to say thanks for making this thread, and thanks to everyone who contributes their opinions and stuff. I don't like to start watching new anime without getting some info first. I already have a large queue of old stuff I still want to watch and not a lot of time to do my own investigation for each of them.

Picked up nearly a dozen shows I probably wouldn't have watched otherwise.

how bad is the cringe humour in Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji? I'm tempted to watch this show, but I can't stand cringe humour

I highly recommend it. The male MC is quite interesting in the way he acts. He's kind of like many girl characters in other series except a lot more direct and not dense at all.

The only cringey episode was the first, I don't know how it will go further.
>> ARTICLE
am i in a minority for not cringing in ep 1?
>> ARTICLE
alright, thanks

>> ARTICLE
I think the greatest thing about this season is that it offers a great show for all interests. Seriously it feels like for the first time I'm hyped for an anime in every genre at the same time.

Also I don't think it's fair to call Cross Ange a trainwreck. I was immediately put off by the trailer and really only decided to watch it because I saw in another discussion that someone liked it. It isn't AOTY but it hasn't done anything wrong. Yes the MC is a disgusting racist but that's the point. Hell, no show would intentionally have an unlikable character voice over the previews the way she does without some kind of purpose, and as shown in the first episode it definitely grows to a certain point.

I would say something along the lines that I've grown to accept CGI but nope fuck that I still hate it, however the use of it this season has been pretty impressive and is surprisingly(or unsurprisingly) everywhere.

As for your comment on Shirobako, I agree it's nothing special, in fact I would never recommend this anime ***however*** if you're interested in how the anime industry works this show is a jewel. As someone attending school for animation I'm loving the hell out of it.

Edit: Forgot to mention Terra Formars. The 4th episode has definitely been the strongest in the series so far and immediately grabbed my respect, lack of censorship was icing on the cake. Though if you're waiting for the uncensored version I highly recommend you do, as I've seen the uncensored screencaps and they definitely add a new layer to the show *coughcoughunlikeTokyoGhoulcoughcough*

>> ARTICLE
I have got some catching up to do.
>> ARTICLE
I posted this in another thread, but I guess it fits here. Consider it Cliffs' Notes for my opinions:

**YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BE WATCHING TIER**

**Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis** - Almost cinema-quality pacing, action, and characterization. Beautiful animation, and interesting world-building. I went in with no idea that it was based on a shitty mobile card game, but it blew me away. Must watch. 

**Shirobako** - if you're interested in anime about the real world, cute tryhard working girls, or especially if you're curious as to how anime is made, definitely pick this one up. It's almost niche, but it's fascinating so far. It's possible that you may get bored of the hyperspecific anime-studio setting, so it may not be for everyone.

**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso** - It's just a beautiful show, so far. I'm certainly biased, as I was a fan of Nodame Cantabile, but the animation and soundtrack are top-notch, and the characters are plenty interesting. I'm hoping that it doesn't become the predictable drama that it's hinting at, but the ride will hopefully be fun regardless. 

**NOT AOTS, BUT STILL A LOT OF FUN TIER**

**Amagi Brilliant Park** - should be standard KyoAni fare; cute girls and on-point comedy. Although they do seem to be a little more bold this time, and the mascots are great.

**Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de** - Definitely one of the funnier shows this season, and as an added bonus, the MC isn't entirely dense or annoying. Great!

**Parasyte** - Is a weird fucking show, but it's pretty interesting. The first episode made me way too curious, so I ended up reading the manga a little too far. Still watching casually, and the soundtrack is bold, which I like. I'm interested to see how closely it'll follow the manga. 

**SHOWS YOU PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT TIER**

**Hitsugi no Chaika: Avenging Battle** - If you didn't like the first season, stay away. I loved the first season, and this season is shaping up to be even better. A fantasy D&D-style adventure with great action and an intriguing world. I look forward to this one every week.

**Log Horizon: 2nd Season** - This one's simple. If you liked the first season, you'll enjoy this one. There's no reason to pick it up otherwise. I for one enjoy living in the database.

**Sword Art Online II** - I'm watching it because I want to find out what happens, but it's nothing special so far. Still beautifully animated, though. I don't know whether I'm happy or sad that the Sinon's Ass Online arc is over.

**Akame ga Kill** - I just wanna win Akame ga Kill bingo, alright? I guess the action is alright, but it's in this weird place where it wants to be grimdark-esque, but it's basically standard shounen fare with extra gore.

**WATCH WHAT I SAY NOT WHAT I WATCH TIER**

**Gogure! Kokkuri-san** - Kinda cute, kinda funny. Nothing special, but it's entertaining.

**Trinity 7** - Harem-fare, though I like the MC. Borderline ecchi, though.

**Grisaia no Kajitsu** - Weird harem-fare, with a weird MC. Still like him. Also borderline ecchi, but will probably go into some dark places. 

I'm probably going to pick up **Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru** based on what people are saying about it, but I have not watched it yet. I also watched the first episode of **Twintails** and it was amazingly retarded - it's filed as a maybe. I plan to watch **Psycho Pass** and **F/SN** once I've watched the prequel series.

I guess I should try Bahamut again. Watched first ep, was pretty good but not really my thing. The other 2 in your must watch are my current top 2 as well.

> it wants to be grimdark-esque, but it's basically standard shounen fare with extra gore.

I think people are expecting too much from Akame ga Kill by trying to place it into a genre when they should just be excepting it for what it is. The show takes itself seriously enough but it isn't trying to be too serious. It sets standards that there is a tone for combat and a tone for their ordinary lives and runs with that. As for gore? *Tons* of shonen have gore in them that doesn't make the necessarily pretentious. Toriko, Magi, Kingdom, HxH etc. all do the same but for some reason people are looking at Akame strangely.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I maintain my statement. It's in a weird place, tone and thematically-wise. 

Tone of shonen may have gore, but it isn't presented in remotely the same way. This one keeps shoving abuse, rape, torture, etc. into your face, and then discards it immediately after for antics or a standard shonen battle.

Not many other anime do this. It gives it shock value, sets it apart, but it doesn't do it *well.*

You can accept anything for what it is, but it's rarely useful. I wouldn't call Akame ga Kill pretentious - weird or confused might be a better adjective. Anyway, I'm still watching it, so it at least has that going for it.

I'm in a similiar position. I'm just watching to find out what happens. The animation is nice and I love the openings but it feels just so.. mediocre? 

I was especially disappointed with how GGO ended up playing out. The whole arc felt quite shallow and ended suddenly. I was actually pretty excited at the start but 3 cave episodes later and of course that horrible friend took SAO II's quality down. 
>> ARTICLE
If anything, Mother's Rosario is coming up soon and its my favourite arc yet, although I haven't read Alicization yet.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's just not great, but I feel obligated to watch it to the end because I enjoyed the SAO arc a lot and got invested in Kirito and Asuna. Honestly, as far as video game shows go, I'm enjoying Log Horizon a lot more.

And now we don't even have Kirito-chan to take the edge off. :(

I think a fair comparison of SAO and Log Horizon is the comparison between something like Maple Story and World of Warcraft.

>  F/SN once I've watched the prequel series.

UBW is what you should watch first, no need to watch anything else before hand
>> ARTICLE
Beating a dead horse, but FSN should be watched first, unless you plan to read the VN for Fate route. The first 3 episodes worth of exposition set it up for newbies pretty well
>> ARTICLE
I've seen almost all of Fate/Zero. Unfortunately I think it fell victim to overhype, because I kind of lost some interest around 15-18 episodes in. I'm sure I'll go back and finish it eventually, but right now I'm not really feeling it. 

Do I still need to watch F/SN if I've seen F/Z?
>> ARTICLE
That's the problem of F/Z first. A lot of the stuff is meant to compliment the events of SN, so they don't carry the same weight if you don't know it first. A lot of it is dramatic irony and callbacks (or in this case call-forward). 

And yes. SN is the main story. Z is the complimentary material
>> ARTICLE
I disagree entirely. Fate/Zero absolutely does not need F/SN. Both stories function completely fine independent of the other and because both contain spoilers for each other it is best to watch whichever you think you will enjoy more first.

>SN is the main story. Z is the complimentary material

Really don't know why people think this. Just because Zero came after doesn't mean it is complimentary material. It is is't own story that happens to be heavily linked to SN. Neither is the "main story". Chronologically F/Z happens to be called the prequel because it came out later but happened first timeline-wise.
>> ARTICLE
F/Z is written in the format of a greek tragedy, filled with ironies and you ultimately know how it end. UFOtable made it so you can sorta watch it first, but SN first not only enhance you experience, it doesn't spoil you on multiple twists of a series that's supposed to be a mystery.
>> ARTICLE
The only reason that you ultimately know how it will end is because you know F/SN. There is some foreshadowing for it but that doesn't change the fact that F/SN spoils F/Z. In fact, for most people I know Fate/Zero's ending is pretty surprising. As I edited into my original post: 

>>SN is the main story. Z is the complimentary material

>Really don't know why people think this. Just because Zero came after doesn't mean it is complimentary material. It is is't own story that happens to be heavily linked to SN. Neither is the "main story". Chronologically F/Z happens to be called the prequel because it came out later but happened first timeline-wise.

I really don't know why people even make this discussion is even a thing. Both works are pretty clearly made to function perfectly independent of each other.

>it doesn't spoil you on multiple twists of a series that's supposed to be a mystery.

Since when is F/SN a mystery???? That's a new one. Sure it has twists and the like but that doesn't make it a mystery.

I think there's a pretty large difference in the spoilers between the two shows. The F/SN points that spoil F/Z [F/Z spoilers](/s "(tokiomi's death, gilgamesh's survival, kotomine's transformation into someone who accepts his nature as far as his actions go)")  are spoilers, but there's still a lot left to flesh out as far as how it actually plays out. 

The F/Z spoilers have a much larger impact on the F/SN story IMO. Knowing that [F/Z spoilers](/s "Sakura is Rin's sister") and that she spent most of her life in the environment she did completely changes the way you see her and takes a lot of impact out of the earlier parts of Heavens Feel. Knowing that Kirei turned out the way he did gives you a lot more reason to suspect him of certain things than you otherwise would. (given, he's a pretty suspicious person anyways) Ilya's relationship with the Emiyas is another big point that isn't fully explained until Heaven's Feel.

The only thing I could really agree upon being equal for both shows as far as spoilers is the nature of the Grail. In my opinion though, as well as most of those who have read the VN through, I think the spoilers that F/Z has for F/SN outweighs the ones F/SN has for F/Z pretty heavily.
>> ARTICLE
Just my two cents. I watched F/Z years ago before I knew any better, and I didn't *feel* very spoiled. I feel like Saber's identity is common knowledge at this point and it's reveal is not as thematically relevant as Archer's. As to the nature of the grail stuff I specifically remember being so confused when that stuff was happening that absolutely *none* of it clicked in my head until I read F/SN. I also think the important specifics of Sakura stuff is not gone over in detail (although I haven't finished my rewatch and I might be wrong).
>> ARTICLE
Saber's identity is a bit like Vader's, except on a less widespread scale.

The grail being [spoiler](/s "evil") however, is a pretty big twist, and Sakura's backstory makes up about half of Heaven's Feel, so knowing anything there before hand is going to make the route feels boring, since the first week or so is just SoL with creepy night time stuffs happening in intermission
>> ARTICLE
I'm literally disturbed that there aren't more people watching [Gugure! Kokkuri-San](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23251/Gugure!_Kokkuri-san). It is utterly hilarious, and I can't wait to watch it each week. 

As for the rest, I'm currently watching roughly 30 airing shows (and sticking through to the bitter end) so I will just list some that I have found to be noteworthy - besides the big names and sequels. 

Cross Ange - for whatever reason I can't get enough of this. Maybe I'm a masochist, I don't care. The mix of violence, racism, sexual power plays with a story of one piece-of-shit's survival/redemption, I can't look away. 

Donten ni Warau - this was pretty meh until last week's episode. Then shit got real. Ninjas, Shrine Gods and samurai oh my! Definitely watching this. 

Twintails - oh my god this is the most self-aware anime I have ever watched. It knows that the premise is ridiculous and runs with it, creating an atmosphere that has me 1) in stitches at the jokes 2) in awe of the transformations and action. I will follow this to the end as well. 

Shirobako - I've loved every second of this. I think it's a special look at this world that we all love, and it gives us cute characters doing  their jobs, and it's fantastic. Plus it's PA works, so you know it's eye-pleasing. 

Your lie in April - this is beautiful. I have no other words for it. I'm touched by it and each week it gets better. It's so much more than a romance, and I can't wait to for the following weeks

I probably have more but my lunch break is over -_-

I like Kokkuri, but it really bugs me with how little music i notice. Even girlfriend BETA has more music.

> I'm literally disturbed that there aren't more people watching Gugure! Kokkuri-San. It is utterly hilarious, and I can't wait to watch it each week. 

I initially decided "I'll wait a few weeks to see what people think", but about a day or two later, people were raving about how hilarious it was, so I ended up watching it... And it was amazing. It is one of the very few anime that have actually made me laugh.

Many people are talking about the larger titles so let me give a shout out to the greatest short series I've seen in a while.

[Danna ga Nani o Itte Iru ka Wakaranai Ken](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26349/Danna_ga_Nani_wo_Itteiru_ka_Wakaranai_Ken)  or [I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying](http://www.crunchyroll.com/i-cant-understand-what-my-husband-is-saying) is a lovely comedy that its into the times space of 3 minutes each week. It is hilarious but also has its share of d'awwww moments as well. 16+ humor.

To put it simply, it is short and sweet. Would strongly recommend. 
>> ARTICLE
Not really shocked at the lack of Nanatsu no Taizai love in here, but coming from a manga reader you guys should definitely watch.
>> ARTICLE
I actually have all three episodes ready to go, but I haven't gotten around to watching them yet. I think the biggest factor keeping people from not watching it is the lack of availability.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/ SN UBW - I already know the story is great (read the VN) and Ufotable seems to be making a perfect adaptation, so I'm confident this one will be AoTS. I talk about Fate all the time though, so I'll give another show some time in the spotlight.

Trinity Seven - Surprisingly really good/entertaining to watch. Love the characters, love the designs, the whole concept is pretty cool, and the magic in the show looks really nice. The whole concept of the 7 girls, and an MC having a *real reason* to form his harem is a nice change too. Along with having a cool MC who actually goes for the girls (in a non-rapist way,) is a great change from the usual Ichika types that harem anime have. 

Log Horizon S2 - DATABASE DATABASE. Not much to say here other than I'm really loving it, and it's very similar to S1.

Grisaia no Kaijitsu - Loving the mysterious feeling, and the characters all seem really fun. <3 Mitcher.

I agree with you on pretty much everything, and I dropped the exact same series (Terra formar, Ushinwa and World Trigger (never bothered with Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai))

My personal top 3 atmo is UBW, Parasyte and Bahamut. Somehow, including the 2 carryover shows, I am still watching 25 shows 3 episodes into a season. That is just insane, I've never got anywhere near that number in any season before.

The only shows at the moment that are somewhat at risk of dropping is Amagi Brilliant park and Inou Battle. Amagi so far has been just very mediocre.. hopefully it improves. and Inou battle has been up and down, really liked episode 2.. but not so much episode 3
>> ARTICLE
I've managed to limit the ones I'm watching to "only" 14. Nothing dropped yet. I intentionally tried to avoid starting shows that didn't catch my interest, though (pretty much all the "cute girls doing cute things" shows).
>> ARTICLE
**Recommend:**

* *Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso* - My AotS at this point but I generally like SoL/Romance over Action.
* *Fate/Stay Night: UBW* - Justified hype. Best visual novel route.
* *Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis* - Better than it has any right to be.
* *Twintails* - Stupid, hilarious. It's Nozaki for this season but for Sentai/Idol/Magical Girl instead of Romance and stupid instead of tactful.
* *Shirobako* - PA works having fun. It's an anime for people who have watched a lot of anime or are interested in the process.

**Enjoying:**

* *Amagi Brilliant Park* - KyoAni channeling Full Metal Panic.
* *Yuuki Yuuna* - Shiny happy but ep 3 was dropping so many death flags and this is a 2 cour show.
* *Inou-Battle* - Good execution on the wasting-time club show.
* *Akatsuki no Yona* - I like fantasy. Show is running about average for the genre.
* All the sequels. No huge surprise changes in tone/quality (though I'm not thrilled with Deen). You're either watching them or not.

**Watching:**

* *Sora no Method*
* *Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji*
* *Gugure! Kokkuri-san*
* *Garo*
* *Grisaia*
* *Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai*
* *Trinity Seven*

**Dropped:**

There are enough good shows that I'm dropping aggressively.

* *Cross Ange* - Ep 3
* *Terra Formars* - Ep 2
* *Donten ni Warau* - Ep 2
* *World Trigger* - Ep 1
* *Ushinawareta Mirai no Motomete* - Ep 1

Thanks for your input on the shows, I'll definitely watch some of these.

**Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis**

I've been  pleasantly surprised by this along with many others in this sub. Great animation, pretty unique main character and sweet action scenes. 

The only thing I've been wary about is the dragon subplot and all the super powers associated with that. I wasn't a fan at all of the opening scene in the first episode, made the series seem way more generic than it actually is.

**Amagi Brilliant Park**

So far the show has been fairly predictable and I'm not really sure how the plot will remain interesting. I've enjoyed it for the comedy and narcissistic main character. I'm most likely staying with this till the end but will allow the story to surprise me with my expectations set low. 

**Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works**

I was extremely hyped for this and this has been one of the only times where my expectations were *exceeded*. The first episode was so well done that I just had to get a bunch of my friends right into the series along with me. It also has my favourite opening of the season quite easily. Can't really compliment this series enough. It is to be seen if it can actually match up to Fate zero in great story and exciting twists. 

**Grisaia no Kaijutsu**

I've honestly not gotten the hype about this and it seems to be mostly VN readers to be pushing that hype. I've continued to watch this because of that and the many assertions of its future plot being really good. 

The first episode had me almost dropping it at the principal's high pitched voice and moe look. It was unbearable. Since then the series has been a comedy with far too much fanservice. I later found out this is based on a hentai VN which explains that. 

Comedy has been good and is carried by its MC. I was pretty bothered by Yumiko though. I can't bring myself to ever care about her after she kept trying to murder the MC with a sharp knife. She even tried doing surprise attacks and such and it's played off humorously. She got surprised when the MC did the minimal amount to defend himself(stopped her arm..) I can't see any amount of backstory redeeming her.

**Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji**

A surprisingly sweet Shoujo. Been highly enjoying this and I'm a big fan of the main male character. It seems like the kind of series where he will develop a lot and I can't wait for the inevitable blooming romance. 

Only real issue has been a weak supporting cast. The friends of the MC are just .. annoying(purposely so) and the series has been carried on the back of the MC and the main guy. 

**Parasyte** 

Series has been fairly intelligent and a great watch so far. I especially like the heartless alien form attached to our MC. My expectations are set high after the great start and I know Madhouse won't disappoint in the animation department. 

Dropped series:

**World trigger** at episode 3: I'm really not a fan of overusing =3= face. The premise is not that great in my opinion and I didn't find the action,comedy or writing particularly above average so I dropped.

**Sora no method** episode 2: I don't know if it's going to get better but so far it has been pretty boring which is the biggest no no for any anime series. Not much happens and it seems to be heading in the direction of drama among kids which I don't find interesting. 

**Denki-gai no Honya-san** episode 1: It was ok at most but I didn't really resonate with the humor. It was crude but also felt quite forceful. I didn't laugh at all during the first episode so I dropped it. 

**Terra formers** episode 2: dropped due to censorship and no other reason. Will pick back up when I can watch it uncensored.

I'm also watching many great sequels including Chaika, Log horizon and psychopass. All 3 of those are among my weekly favourites. Trinity seven I just caught up to and has been amusing though a bit emotionless(many student deaths are ignored).



>> ARTICLE
Based on what everyone is saying about Grisaia no Kaijutsu I think I will read the VN. The Anime seems to be decent but its the VN readers which are the ones enjoying it. And I want to read the VN which will be longer and go into more depth with the characters.

Regarding Fate/Stay Night, I didn't think it could be adapted so well. The story is being followed really closely and the animation is some of the best I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
> this has been one of the only times where my expectations were exceeded

I feel absolutely the same way about UBW. I went in knowing Ufotable was good, but I didn't think they would actually do better than I expected. Looks like it'll stay consistent too, if their previous work is to be trusted.
>> ARTICLE
Regarding *Grisaia no Kajitsu*:  
Some of the events with Yumiko and Yuuji have been sped up in the anime compared to the visual novel, where Yumiko swinging the knife is a more slowly escalating situation -- I think the anime messed up a little by making it *that* sudden. Either way, what Yumiko is doing isn't something a reasonable person would do, but it isn't really intended as being reasonable. That said, if you'll learn more about Yumiko's background then you might see that scene in a slightly different light even if you don't end up forgiving her.  
The only part that was playing it off as humorous was the scene with the chibi art and Yumiko falling over. The reason that scene was shown as humorous was mainly to show just how little a threat Yumiko is to Yuuji (regardless of her intentions), and not because the box cutter is meant to be some cutesy endearing gimmick.  

(You can see the scene in the visual novel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9cY3ziWYP4&feature=youtu.be&t=59m2s). The next time we see Yumiko, she runs at Yuuji and tries to stab him as in the start of Episode 2).  

The visual novel of Grisaia no Kajitsu has far less fanservice than the anime does. Also, technically Grisaia isn't a *hentai* novel ("nukige") but an *erotic* novel ("eroge"). That's not a small distinction: a hentai novel is typically a sequence of H-scenes connected by a flimsy plot nobody cares about, typically with 2 hours of content. Grisaia no Kajitsu has over 50 hours of content, its H-scenes are generally spaced many hours apart and it is driven primarily by character development.  
Trust me, most VN readers are just as pissed about the excessive fanservice as everyone else.  

I hope you stay with the anime. Provided the anime studio doesn't mess up in a huge way, you should be very satisfied by the time it ends.
>> ARTICLE
 I understand Yumiko is not trying to be reasonable but attempted murder is attempted murder. He could have very easily ended up as a bloody corpse, then would she be satisfied?.. It was not unreasonable for him to use far more force against someone attempting to *murder* him. A sharp knife is not exactly a toy. 

I could have got over it if it was just the initial meeting but she actually carefully plans and tries many surprise attacks to ultimately get him killed. That goes from tragic past to being psychotic. Gahara from Bake is similiar in having a tragic past and being threatening but she sure as hell was not doing murderous surprise attacks. 

I do appreciate your response though! Thanks for the correction about the nature of the VN. I will stay with the series, with you and many others saying it's satisfying. 
>> ARTICLE
Yuuji would be perfectly justified if he did something like break Yumiko's arm that in response to what she's doing -- and it would probably even be much easier/safer on his end, too. It's perfectly fine to think Yuuji is being ridiculous by enabling her behavior, and having that sort of mindset shouldn't really interfere with enjoying the series.  

I do want to point out that for the most part, Yumiko doesn't "carefully plan" anything -- we only see her do something sneaky one time when she flips the sign in the dorm to make Yuuji think she left the building.  The rest of the time, she usually loudly opens her knife (the box cutter makes a clicking sound) runs straight at him. She is attacking him, but she's not remotely doing everything she could be in order to stab him.   Lastly, although a box cutter knife is a very sharp knife and stabbing someone with it can lead to very serious harm, it's not a good choice of weapon if you actually want to kill somebody. The blade would probably snap as soon as you hit once.  
This isn't meant to say that Yumiko's behavior is even close to justified, but hopefully it can help you understand her motivation--even if you disagree with it--without spoiling anything.  

Lastly, one thing in general I like to say about Grisaia no Kajitsu is that it works much better if you try to consider the behavior of the characters the same way you'd consider them if someone did *literally* the same thing in real life.  
Looking at Sachi and saying "her reason for wearing a maid outfit is kinda weird but I guess they need a maid character in the cast" could make you miss out on understanding just what Sachi is like. It's best to pretend the tropes don't exist.^(except the damned pantyshots)  

Anyway, enough ranting. Have fun!

Gonna repost something I made for /r/animesuggest a little earlier:

>This is all the stuff that I'm following at the moment. I tried 20+ shows and still have more left that I plan to try. These are the ones I'm keeping at the moment. The low tier ones are shows that either I found entertaining enough or am interested in seeing for some reason despite finding them to be relatively low quality shows. Not going to cover the dropped shows mostly just out of laziness. Overall, Looks to be a really solid season overall with multiple shows showing a lot of potential.

>---Top Tier---

>[Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu / Parasyte -the maxim-](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22535/Kiseijuu:_Sei_no_Kakuritsu): Easily a top pick of the season. Psychological/thriller/action show and everything about it just seems to be executed really well. 

>[Shirobako](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25835/Shirobako): Surprisingly really damn good. Didn't expect much based on the concept but so far I'd personally put it tied for the best with Parasyte.

>[Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso / Your Lie in April](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso): Romance/drama/music show. Looks really solid so far and has a lot of potential. Definite pick up if you like the genre and personally I'd say try it even if that isn't typically your thing.

>[Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works (TV)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22297): Looks to be a really solid action show with generally just fantastic visuals. Even if it doesn't turn out to be something really amazing it's basically guaranteed to deliver action-wise. Be sure to not skip episode 0 if you try it.

>[Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis / Rage of Bahamut: Genesis](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21843/Shingeki_no_Bahamut:_Genesis): Another surprisingly really solid show (based off of a card game?!?). Pretty standard Action/High Fantasy but generally just really fun/done well.

>[Amagi Brilliant Park](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22147/Amagi_Brilliant_Park): KyoAni Comedy show. Really enjoyable with pretty great execution in general (KyoAni seems to just know what they are doing with this kind of stuff). Really enjoyable narcissistic main character.

>[Psycho Pass 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23281/Psycho-Pass_2): Looking pretty solid so far. Putting it here because it has a lot of potential and the first season was fantastic. Definite watch if you've seen the first season.

>---Mid Tier---

>[Nanatsu no Taizai / The Seven Deadly Sins](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23755/Nanatsu_no_Taizai): Shounen/Adventure, possibly borderline ecchi. Has been entertaining enough so far that I'm going to put it here instead of the Low Tier.

>[Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de / When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25159/Inou-Battle_wa_Nichijou-kei_no_Naka_de): School/Comedy/Romance with a supernatural twist. Pretty amusing. Some of the jokes fall flat but it's surprisingly solid in completely unexpected ways. 

>[Hitsugi no Chaika: Avenging Battle](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24231/Hitsugi_no_Chaika:_Avenging_Battle): More Chaika. Standard fantasy show. So far a little weaker than the first season but I expect it to pick up. Worth watching if you enjoyed the first season.

>[Log Horizon 2nd Season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23321/Log_Horizon_2nd_Season): More Log Horizon. Pretty solid popcorn show, worth picking up if you enjoyed the first season.

>---Low Tier---

>[Denki-gai no Honya-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24031/Denki-gai_no_Honya-san): Pretty meh anime non-comedy. Even though I don't think its very good it's not terrible. Personally enjoy shows of the type enough that I'm watching it anyway as a sort of mindless entertainment.

>[Grisaia no Kajitsu / The Fruit of Grisaia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17729/Grisaia_no_Kajitsu): Based off a visual novel. Has a lot of fans. The first episode was solid but aside from that it seems to be generally pretty poorly written. Watching because I'm interested in seeing it through due to the fan base.

>[Trinity Seven](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25157/Trinity_Seven): Looks to be a standard action/fantasy/harem/ecchi show. Entertaining for what it is if you like the genre but pretty much definitely nothing special.

Also a list of my dropped shows that I gave a shot but didn't include in my earlier post (not all of them were particularly bad, some just pretty boring):

* Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete

* Magic Kaito 1412

* Gugure! Kokkuri-san

* Cross Ange

* Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken

* Girlfriend (Kari)

* Kaitou Joker

And finally a list of shows I plan on giving a chance but have yet to get around to:

* Sora no Method

* Akatsuki no Yona

* Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru

* Madan no Ou to Vanadis

* Sanzoku no Musume Ronja

* Ore Twintails ni Narimasu

All the other shows of the season looked uninteresting to me personally, I heard enough bad things about that I didn't feel the need to try them or they somehow flew under my radar.

mostly agree except swap grisaia with inoubattle, amagi mid tier and magic kaito mid/high

and by the way, unless you intentionally want to drag down the scores of every series you add on MAL, rate them out of 10.
>> ARTICLE
I rate out of 5 and I don't really plan on changing that or adjusting it for the sake of MAL. IIRC, MAL adjusts your scores based on your average so it should be fine anyway but my purpose in using the site is to have an online list to keep track of/show what I think of series I have watched. The score database doesn't really matter to me and is hardly affected anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Finally someone who didn't really like Grisaia no Kajitsu. I dropped the VN because of the MC. I like having an MC who is not easily flustered by the girls around him, but for some reason, the MC just annoys me. His backstory is awful too.
>> ARTICLE
You'd be surprised, there's actually a significant amount of people who think Grisaia is pretty poor. It's just that most of /r/anime likes it so we are rare here. For example, a great deal of the critical community tends to dislike the show/VN.

Poorly written? how?
>> ARTICLE
Mostly just characters that are defined by traits/cliches/etc. (arranged in a slightly different way than the before to make it seem different) rather than being created as actual people. It basically boils down to a harem nonsense fix-the-girl show with an incredibly simplistic structure to the story. Also the adaptation doesn't seem to be doing a great job as it's probably the most visual novel show I've ever seen (scene's look like they are literally copied and pasted from a visual novel, camera angle and all).
>> ARTICLE
All I can say without going into heavy spoilers is that there's a good reason for the characters to act the way they do. It helps to pay close attention.  

Regarding the adaptation and its similarity to the visual novel -- there's quite a bit in the anime that is very similar to the novel. Scenes, dialogues (although the anime is much more condensed), the soundtrack and many of the visuals. As a VN reader, I'm actually pretty happy about that.
>> ARTICLE
I do know the source material to some extent so I do have some grasp of the characters. That doesn't change the fact that the story is a simple format with poorly written characters. Really the basic format boils down to: 

1. girl introduced (a collection of cliches/traits)
2. girl spending time with MC SoL style
3. tragic reveal/psychological problems
4. MC fixes the girl, etc.. 

It's really just lazy writing in general. The characters are somewhat unique, but not well written (this is a pretty important distinction that many fail to realize). It's fine to enjoy it but its also important to be able to identify why the story works the way it does and the inherent issues with it. 

This [review](http://auramart.tumblr.com/post/58711839825/reading-my-little-visual-novel-was-a-waste-of-time) gives a good summary of the problems with the VN. These are also inherently present in the anime. 

>Regarding the adaptation and its similarity to the visual novel -- there's quite a bit in the anime that is very similar to the novel. Scenes, dialogues (although the anime is much more condensed), the soundtrack and many of the visuals. As a VN reader, I'm actually pretty happy about that.

The adaptation will inherently be similar to the VN because it is an adaptation. Using the same scenes, soundtrack, etc. is fine (and can definitely be cool for fans of the source). Part of the adaptation process, though, is adjusting these things so that the material works in the new medium. Using the same camera angles of a visual novel is just generally not a great choice. The problem comes with the fact that this results in it feeling like I am watching a Visual Novel (or a show with pretty awful directing) and not just a normal show.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know exactly how much of the source material you know, so I'm not sure what scope of spoilers to use, so unless you want to clarify on what should be fair game, I'll keep things very vague.  
Grisaia no Kajitsu *is* a slice of life novel, so it is a given that every character will be spending time SoL style.  

Putting aside the thing about 'cliches' which I tried to address earlier, the basic format you described can be rephrased as:  

1. Character is introduced
2. Character spends time with main character
3. Problems arise
4. Problems are dealt with in some way  

And this format can be applied to nearly anything. What matters isn't whether a format exists at some high level, but whether that format is causing problems to the work in some way. As they say, *tropes are not bad*. 

I understand the distinction between having unique characters and having well-written characters, and I think Grisaia no Kajitsu does a very good job with respect to things such as character motivations, development, foreshadowing and callbacks. Having read the novel, I feel like I understand the characters extremely well; if that makes them poorly-written, I think it's the best kind of poorly-written.  

I also read the review you linked, and I have to say that Grisaia no Kajitsu isn't for everyone. Honestly, I don't see why that reviewer didn't drop it after fifteen hours of seeing a ton of comedy he did not find amusing. Similarly, he speaks out against the very idea of a common route and openly dislikes slice of life, complaining about inefficient storytelling.  
These opinions are absolutely valid, but if you hate slice of life as a genre then why would you review a 55-hour novel that is primarily of the slice of life genre?  

There are a few points in the review that are valid, but they'd be difficult to discuss without knowing which spoiler scope to use.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that tropes are not inherently bad. When they are put to good use that is absolutely fine. The problem to me arises that I feel like there isn't much there aside from the tropes and very formulaic unoriginal storyteling (and what there is aside from that doesn't constitute what I'd call good writing). I think'll we'll probably just have to agree to disagree.
>> ARTICLE
Not the OP, but I agree with him. So far, it seems like your typical otaku wet-dream. Male MC with a dark past transfers into a school with only 5 other female students with adults basically non-existent and half of those girls basically start throwing themselves at the MC despite only just meeting him.

I'm reserving judgment since apparently shits supposed to go down later, but at the moment the show is a above-average comedy at best. 
>> ARTICLE
Aside from UBW, amagi brilliant park has been my favorite. the timing of every joke has been spot on, and the characters play off each other very well. not the mention the mc is so fun to watch. psycho-pass 2, parasyte, and log horizon have also been really captivating so far.
>> ARTICLE
Amagi Brilliant Park, basically Arakawa Under The Bridge but different setting. its good for comedy, im not complaining. 


Kiseijuu, a legendary manga thats been in publication since '88. good things to come from this series. a better Tokyo Ghoul imo.


Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, A-1 studios redeeming themselves with this 2 cour show that ends next year. its gonna have a great ending seeing as the manga ends the same time.

Inou-battle wa Nichijou-kei no Nake de, the older generation of Otaku cant stand any Trigger shows for more than 5mins. So Sword Art, Magi and Kill La Kill was off the table for them. its surprising that they actually like this series by Trigger. 

Shirobako, another great 2 cour show. potential AOTS ( not counting the excellent PsychoPass 2, YowaPeda 2 and Log Horizon 2)

Mushishi Season 2 lots of hype!
>> ARTICLE
All the shows im currently watchn from new season are all solid. One gripe on my mind...watching trinity seven with a light mood mindset is better, it sort of mocks itself with over the top ecchi and harem...
>> ARTICLE
I don't normally watch many shows each season. THis season I am only watching Fate/Stay Night, Parasyte, and Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu. 

**Fate/Stay Night: UBW**  
This show has blown me away. I've read the VN route and so far its been a brilliant adaptation. It is sticking close to the VN and has some of the best animation I've seen in a show. The fight in episode 0 felt like a fight between two super human powers but didn't seen to be too over the top. I am definitely interested in how the rest of the show is going to turn out and I can't wait to see the Heavens Feel movie. Ufotable animation in the show is great so I cant wait to see the VN with a movie sized budget.

**Parasyte**  
The manga has been given quite the praise over at /r/manga so I thought I would give the show a try. So far it has been exactly what I was looking for. The story is intriguing, the characters and likeable and I am curious to see them change, and the animation is good (other than the CG that has shown up each episode). I would recommend picking it up if you haven't already.

**Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu**  
AOTY material right here. Ok maybe not, bit I would be lieing if it wasn't one of the funniest shows I've seen. The characters are likable with TailRed being best Girl and the mom being best Mom. The fight are hilarious with the weirdest bad guys since Samurai Flamenco. IF you enjoyed Samurai Flamenco [after](/s "gullitone gorilla and all the crazyness") you will enjoy Twintails.
>> ARTICLE
It seems like there are a lot of half-to-mostly female ensemble anime this season, not that it isn't the case most seasons.

Grisaia no Kajitsu, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Sora no Method, Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete. 

(Yes, I'm watching other shows not listed here but those aren't the topic I'm asking about.)

Are any of these shows actually decent? I'm not really interested in neither the cute (way too young for me) girls doing cute things, nor the school-aged (still too young for me) ecchi harem shows. A quick once-over on the synopses of these shows start to set off some alarms but people seem to be at least somewhat interested in them so I'm curious.

As for what I do like: Well-done slice of life with plot/drama, straight romance with complexity, or really, anything with a deep and rich storyline without getting fanservice-y or trope-y are my jam. I realize that's kind of getting rare these days.

Do any of the shows I mentioned fit into what I'm looking for?
>> ARTICLE
Grisaia no Kajitsu should be an excellent fit for what you're asking, although the way the anime is forced to rush things is toning down the slice of life a little, plus the foreshadowing employed is a little more explicit than the novel. Past that, the anime is also increasing the fanservice which can get a little annoying at times.  

It's a little hard to write a decent synopsis of Grisaia no Kajitsu without spoiling anything.
>> ARTICLE
(In no particular order)

Watching actively: Log Horizon 2, Magic Kaito, Fate/Stay Night, Parasyte, Psycho-Pass 2

Might watch depending on how the season progresses: Terra Formars, Gundam Reconguista in G, Shingeki no Bahamut Genesis, Trinity Seven

Eventually will watch but not yet due to backlog: Selector Spread WIXOSS, World Trigger, Nanatsu no Taizai, Yowamushi Pedal 2, Hitsugi no Chaika 2, Mushishi Zoku Shou 2

Slightly curious but need convincing: Garo, Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete, Grisaia no Kajitsu, Sora no Method, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso
>> ARTICLE
From my personal tastes I'd recommend picking up *Bahamut* and *Shigatsu.* They've both been more than solid so far, and seem like they'll keep going that way. *Grisaia* is the only other one that I feel like at this point is worth picking up, but I can't recommend it as wholeheartedly as the other two.
>> ARTICLE
If you really want to enjoy Grisaia no Kajitsu, I suggest ignoring the panty shots and paying close attention. Try questioning people's actions and motivations and you might find it more interesting.

[**Gugure! Kokkuri-San**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23251/Gugure!_Kokkuri-san)

This has been the surprise of the season for me. I love a good black comedy, and the show definitely delivers on that front. The characters are all amusing and posses fatal flaws that are exploited well for the comedy. Some surprise mini-drama in the show, as it's effectively about an abandoned school girl living on her own. Extra points for a groovy OP.

[**Amagi Brilliant Park**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22147/Amagi_Brilliant_Park)

I enjoyed the first three episodes of this one. The narcissistic MC is a hoot, and I get some Senjougahara vibes from Sento. A fun and unique set-up, but I'm actually a bit worried how they'll keep it entertaining, but that might because I though episode 3 was relatively weaker. 

[**Denki-gai no Honya-san**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24031/Denki-gai_no_Honya-san)

This is a bit of a trashy comedy, but it's also sort of wants to be about trash, so it evens out. The characters are totally ridiculous, and the comedy is often crude and very forceful. Grabbing some of my most hysterical screen-caps from this show, a lot of great visual gags. Ultimately it's a comedy show for manga nerds, and while I don't find it to be anything exceptional, I'm enjoying watching it every week.

[**Grisaia no Kajitsu**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17729/Grisaia_no_Kajitsu)

I dropped this after one episode. It's very much a harem show, and seems to pander to otaku fantasies. Contrasted with Denki-gai above, which celebrates otakus and their weird interests, this show seems to be exploiting them. I know people dug the VN and supposedly it gets dark, but I just don't have interest or time for a show where most of the entertainment is derived from watching a group of women throw themselves at the MC.

[**Chaika: Avenging Battle**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24231/Hitsugi_no_Chaika:_Avenging_Battle)

So far, more Chaika. It's been fun hanging with Chaika as expected but not a lot that I feel is significant has happened yet. I'm sure with the shorter season we'll start ramping up to the main conflict soon, so I'm not discouraged. 

[**Parasyte**] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/22535/Kiseijuu:_Sei_no_Kakuritsu)

I've found Parasyte pretty interesting so far. Feels like a fairly unique science fiction show that mostly takes itself seriously. Migi is done very well and the main draw to the show for me. The MC is worth mentioning as well, he seems smart and realistic, and less of a character. They've also been cleverly foreshadowing (I think?) drama, such as implying that Murano may know more than she's letting onto. Curious to see where this goes and definitely sticking with it. Music is  a bit questionable, but so far the rest of the show has made up for it.

[**Psycho-Pass Season 2**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23281/Psycho-Pass_2)

The set-up for the new season has my interest. I don't think this is as well shot or directed as season 1, but it's still been a strong show to start. I'm enjoying watching a season Akane do her thing. They've also managed to transform Ginoza, who was somewhat one-dimensional in season 1, into a much more interesting character. Setting up Shimotsuke as a foil to Akane will prove exciting as well. Lastly I was worried how they'd make a new 'super-criminal' interesting, but so far I am intrigued. 

[**Your Lie in April**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso)

So far this has been another surprise for me and I'm really into it. For starters, it is FREAKIN' GORGEOUS. The backgrounds, character animations, use of colors, all feel top-notch. This is key because the show is emotionally evocative, and the art direction is going a long way to facilitate this. Three episodes in, and I feel like this show is very well paced as well, I'm a bit surprised it's 2-cour. The MC and love interests relationship is developing nicely, and I really enjoy their interplay. They're both fairly broken characters who need each other, and I'm invested. The musical focus is special as well, it's not easy to make classical music so appealing, but they've done an excellent job so far and the performances have been stirring.

[**Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23673/Ookami_Shoujo_to_Kuro_Ouji)

I dropped this after two episodes. The premise seemed fun, and I would like to try out a good Shoujo, but I don't think this is the one. The plot started feeling pretty forced and somewhat predictable pretty quickly. It started feeling a bit exploitative of the viewer as well. Not a terrible show, and one hell of an OP, but not for me.

Shows I'm still planning to get into:

[**Fate/Stay Night: UBW**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22297/Fate/stay_night:_Unlimited_Blade_Works_(TV)

Currently playing through the main route of the VN as preparation. I'm into this story and characters, so I'm looking forward to digging into this.

[**Mushishi Zoku Shou Season 2**]
(http://myanimelist.net/anime/24701/Mushishi_Zoku_Shou_2nd_Season)

I'm still working through older Mushishi, I like to take my time with this series, but it's consistency is excellent so I fully anticipate the new episodes will deliver.

> I dropped this after one episode. It's very much a harem show, and seems too pander to otaku fantasies.

> I just don't have interest or time for a show where most of the entertainment is derived from watching a group of women throw themselves at the MC.

The adaptation is unfortunately playing these elements up a little; it's not what Grisaia is about. Since you said you are reading the F/SN visual novel, maybe you'll find the Grisaia visual novel to be more to your liking.  
It's not as pandering as much as the first episode might lead you to believe.
>> ARTICLE
Hey thanks for the comment. The VN does seem to be pretty highly praised so I'll keep it in mind. I know I was a bit derisive in my post, but I'd have a lot more patience to try Grisaia if I didn't feel like I had a lot I already wanted to watch this season.
>> ARTICLE
What is it with all these shitty harem anime's that are ACTUALLY AMAZING??? I hate harem anime, but thus season has Grisaia and Trinity Seven and both have been quite enjoyable. Season hasn't been terrible thus far, I'm excited to see how it continues.
>> ARTICLE
I've been the same way. They have both surprised me in a pleasant way. I don't think I'll suddenly pick up the harem genre but they're enjoyable to say the least, which is nice.

For 2 cour shows or for everything? At 9 your 2-4 episodes from finishing a 1 cour show. Mind as well just commit.

Depends on the show, some are 2cour so a nine episode rule might be a bit better (though I personally would downgrade to 6 episodes myself).

Well, I'm doing it in the order that they were voted in. If you look at [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2qrbyu/ranime_awards_2014_category_poll_results/), I say I'm starting with the OP and ED thread.

The best OP has to be ebb and flow. Such an amazing song and amazing opening, don't watch it if you haven't watched the show though.
>> ARTICLE
have you heard the [5 years after remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgsFr7prGbQ)? Its soooo good.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds great! Both endings and both openings in this show were so good, and mnemonic that played in the last episode was incredible too. Nagi Yanagi, who is probably my favorite anime artist, and Ray were just so good in this show.

I know I didn't do much at all, but I was hoping for a shoutout for giving you some input.

Considering Hikaru Nara has been on a pretty constant rotation for me since the first time I've heard is going to make it hard me to choose anything else for OP.

>> ARTICLE
What do you know, in addition to loving K-On you have damn good taste elsewhere. I love that Shigatsu OP so much that I went through around 30-something pages of google video-search results to find a good version for UgotMal to use in this poll. It's probably my favorite OP ever. 
>> ARTICLE
Haha thank you :)

I don't think I've ever fallen in love with an OP that fast before it's really something else!
>> ARTICLE
It is indeed. The new OP isn't bad but I miss the old one so damn much. Seeing that OP each week was a big part of my Shigatsu watching experience. I love the show, but it felt like I was looking forward to seeing the OP again even more than the new episode.  
>> ARTICLE
Same!! 

Like the new OP is good but I feel I can't apppreciate it since I'm just thinking in the back of my head "Where's my Hikaru Nara?" lol

I think I might just watch it before each episode now to get that vibe back haha ;) 
>> ARTICLE
>I think I might just watch it before each episode now to get that vibe back haha ;)

I think I'll follow suit. Unfortunately, Youtube has videos of the Shigatsu OP taken down like crazy for some reason. I'm sure the one in this poll will be taken down soon too. [That face when you can't find the Shigatsu OP.](http://i.imgur.com/L4rtKvq.gif)

On that note, who was your best girl from K-On?
>> ARTICLE
I downloaded a 60fps version someone showed me once so I'll just have to use that one!

Uggghhh too hard to tell. I think Mugi is adorable but I have a total girl crush on Mio. Too hard to choose...don't make me do it :p
>> ARTICLE
>Uggghhh too hard to tell. I think Mugi is adorable but I have a total girl crush on Mio. Too hard to choose...don't make me do it :p

This is the right answer. All those girls are all wonderful in their own unique ways. I always say "every girl from K-On is best girl".

The way Mugi gets so excited about everything, [especially mundane things,](http://i.imgur.com/VzWUCMP.gif) is just too much adorable for me to handle. It always puts a huge goofy smile on my face so that's why she's my favorite.

Ugh, I can't choose between Silhouette, Unravel, and Courage. Silhouette is the catchiest OP I have heard since Machiakari no Michishirube rolled around and IMO Shippuden's best OP (Only Naruto would save it's best for last). Courage's Mother's Rosario opening is one of the best feels trains I've been on, yet none of the scenes are even remotely sad. Unravel is the best song-wise, hands down, but the way that the other two made you FEEL the OP makes TG's op video seem lacklustre. 

Ah well, all three it is! 

EDIT: Oh, um, did anyone listen to Akatin's cover of Unravel on Niconico? The troll version, not the real one. 
>> ARTICLE
Knights of Sidonia's OP for sure! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghfyf2K1Ums
>> ARTICLE
Tokohana should be a contender for best ED.
>> ARTICLE
Why can't we vote for more than 5?  

Does the system stop us from doing so or does it automatically not count the votes?

Silhouette from naruto should definitely win this. Amazing Opening that shows Naruto's growth from the beginning and where he is at now

I keep coming back to this thread when I want to watch the Shigatsu OP...so every day at least once. After yesterday's episode, the OP has an additional emotional punch because of a certain emotionally-charged scene. 

You are watching Shigatsu, right? If not, you really *really* need to get on that. Assuming it stays at the same level of the previous episodes, I'll probably be rating this a 10 and it'll be jumping into my top 10 favorite anime. I've seen a few anime, so that's kind of a big deal. ;)

I just know Shigatsu is going to devastate me though. I already teared up bad during the last episode and that was just the tip of the iceberg. Shit...it's like I'm using you as a therapist because it's hitting me so hard emotionally. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, yes...  But how does that make you *feel*? 

Nah, I haven't been up on it. Been super busy lately. Plus my coworkers are getting mad because I'm not watching much of anything. I will definitely watch this though. 
>> ARTICLE
>Yes, yes... But how does that make you feel?

I can't say much either. I'm falling behind on airing anime because I've been addicted to shoujo ai and yuri manga. It truly is the purest form of love. [Here's the best one I've read so far.](http://myanimelist.net/manga/3102/Girl_Friends)

For Sidonia you can use [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uv4bCqRwA4), it's an almost exact part of the OP minus the visuals. For some reason anything partially related to the anime gets taken down faster than you can say "Copyright" (but full versions of the song are on youtube).

Now, I'm no animation expert (by far), so what I'm about to tell you is probably not going to be true at all, but whatever.

Something I've noticed is that if you pause an episode, and go forward frame by frame, you'll see that some series seem to take dozens of frames to do a pretty simple thing, so to speak, but others jump between camera angles and shit between almost every frame. The difference here (since I'm assuming they still all run at roughly 24 fps) is then how "smooth" the animation is, while still maintaining 24 fps.

I forgot where I was going with this, but do you see how that could make sense?

It's possible, but requires a lot of video editing, which neither me nor Rawrgna (allegedly) can do.

Could be that your file location is too "secure", so to speak, or that it trips on the name itself. Try moving the file to a different location, and giving it a more concise name.

Well it was posted in /r/hunterxhunter and they got over 9500 subscribers

That explains it, thats fucking stupid. You just get hundreds of biased users to vote on it, and absolutely destroy the point of the poll.

I don't get why this was downvoted, because this is actually true. Only a fairly small percentage of the regulars in /r/hunterxhunter are also regulars in /r/anime, and I assume it's very much the same for /r/fatestaynight, /r/killlakill, /r/typemoon and /r/stardustcrusaders.
>> ARTICLE
Uhh...how do you know that?
>> ARTICLE
Because I'm lurking a lot on /r/hunterxhunter and usually look through the posts that users made who post there frequently, since I'm curious where else they post. You never know what kind of interesting subreddit you might find that way, really.
>> ARTICLE
I don't see the problem here, I actually dislike how people treat those guys from /r/hxh or whatever as inferiors or unable to vote. If they are users of that subreddit, it implies that they classify of HxH as their best/one of their best anime adaptations. I don't see the problem in their participations, the some goes with an eventual involvement of any subreddit users as long as they have a decent knowledge of different animes.

It would make sense if a poor anime wins the poll just because "it comes from a certain franchise" (Imagine Evangelion OAVs, it may be an insta-win here), however it's not the case here since HxH (2011) with its [](/s "Chimera Ants arc") is a decent, if not amazing work.
>> ARTICLE
The problem with that though is that it gives a significant advantage to the anime in this poll that have their own sub, turning the poll into even more of a popularity contest.
>> ARTICLE
you may be true here, i can't imagine what would happen if naruto's and OP's subreddits hijack the best guy contest.

Good point.
>> ARTICLE
I'll copy my post from the previous thread!

As much as I want to give my best of 2014 vote to Ping Pong, since Hunter x Hunter this year included Episodes 111-148 I have to give it my vote. Episodes 116, 126, 131, 135, and 148 are some of the best episodes of anime I've ever seen and Hunter x Hunter just blew me away. 
>> ARTICLE
So 5 episodes in 37 were notable. That doesn't seem like a very good ratio when there was also Ping Pong (and Mushishi, honestly how did it not make it to this poll?) and other consistently solid anime last year. Even if those 5 episodes were the 5 best you've ever seen, is it fair to gloss over the rest of the anime? Seasonal anime don't have the luxury of 6+ build-up episodes for every important event that happens.
>> ARTICLE
>So 5 episodes in 37 were notable.

Have you watched HxH? He means 5 eps in 37 were transcendental of all that is pure in this universe. The remaining 32 episodes were "Notable", though that's depending on your stance regarding the use of narration and pacing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently watching but not at ant arc yet. I'm sure it's following the manga perfectly but it seems to take too long explaining and building things up. I can only imagine that's how the last two arcs do things as well.
>> ARTICLE
Every episode I mentioned is from the Ant Arc, we'll have to talk about it after you get there.
>> ARTICLE
If you're at the York New City arc and feel that way, then I think you might just not really be a fan of the show's process of narrative buildup. Which is okay, it has other elements that you can enjoy, but I doubt your opinion on that note will change much unless you're still in the Heaven's Arena arc or earlier.

>> ARTICLE
This is what happens when you take out Shirou's important thoughts and the viewer misses things about characters.

>Although the setting is interesting, it's not explained very well, and the world building is weak. The show relies to much on exposition and lazy info-dumps, which for the first episodes were unbearable.

Yep they should have left major things that needed to be explained left out.  There were still two important things in the first episode alone that they left out. (that will be in the BD)  Nasu is known for his world building, if you want world building read the VN.

>The pacing is bad, and it feels like there's no real progress in the show. Each episode is pretty similar, with Shirou/Rin talking, some flashy fight occurs, nothing of consequence happens, everyone goes home.

It's a VN, the pace is fine in a VN but can be bad in an anime when you can't binge every episode in 48 hours.  It might be better to not watch VN adaptations week to week because it's really not going to change much.

>The story is weak, and the show feels inconsistent in tone. There's supposed to be this dramatic Grail war going on, but at times the show feels like a romance/SOL, with a lot of boring dialogue between even more boring characters.

It sounds like you don't even know the story or where it's going, and you really shouldn't know where it's going at this point.  The romance/SOL is used to build character relationships.  There is a reason characters do things.  Do you think the date was pointless?  Nearly everyone that complains about the date completely misses the point of it.

>The characters are extremely bland and one-dimensional Rin is basically a tsundere, Saber has almost no character at all, Shirou I'm told gets better in the next cour, but so far he seems like a very generic shounen protagonist with ridiculous amounts of plot armor. Archer is pretty decent and carries the show, but the side characters are so bland they are almost nonexistent. There's just a real lack of depth to the characters.

She is Tsundere go to tvtropes and type Tsundere.  There's a reason for her to be that way though.  She struggles to not show her human side to other people.  She acts like the cold perfect magus for most of her life.  Now Shirou is starting to open her human side up.  Plot armor?  You should know what he has if you've watched Zero and if it's plot armor for him it is for Iri and Kerry too.  There are three routes some things are unexplained in one but you could get a hint about something and connect it to another route.  The side characters aren't supposed to get a lot of depth.  This is a story about Shirou and his ideals period.  Fate/Hollow Ataraxia is a fan disc that goes into the other characters and some of the characters that are 'unlikable' become fan favorites.

>They fight a lot in the series, but none of the fights carry any tension whatsoever. One reason is because of the insane amount of plot armor for Shirou, but also because of how little the characters seem to care about the war. There's been a lot of chances for people to kill servants/masters, but they don't seem to care at all. Why even bother joining the war if you're not gonna use your chances? On that note, I feel the Fate-series benefit greatly from having adult characters like in Fate/Zero, and not the stereotypical high school teenagers.

I'd love to know about all this plot armor, if anything UBW is the route he relies the least on the one major 'plot armor' he has.  The same thing happens in Zero.  There where chances to kill master's/servants that are taken, if you're going to criticize one lets be sure to do the same thing to the other.  Personally I prefer the 'stereotypical' high schoolers over the man-children we find in Zero.  You're just expecting Fate/Zero 2 when that was never going to be the case.

>A lot of people say that you have to read the VN to understand a lot of things, which is a flaw in the adaption. A lot of things go unexplained, and people say you just have to read a 60 hour VN to get it. If it can't stand on it's own it's a flaw in my eyes.

You don't need the VN to understand some of the things you've missed.   There are only a few 'major' things that could go unexplained in this route, but there is still time to reveal them.  This adaptation is not spoonfeeding you information like the VN will so people have to actually piece stuff together.  The adaptation does benefit by having read Fate beforehand though because some of the required foreshadowing for certain events would not be needed.  The anime chose to explain some things after the fact just like Zero did with origin bullets and Kerry's stuff.

I can't say I agree with judging individual parts of a show that happens to air within two different years because then we have to consider a situation in which both parts of the show win both years. That wouldn't be fair because no anime deserves to win multiple "Anime of the Year" awards. However, I can see why you would choose to do so if we were talking about different seasons rather than different segments of a season.

It's strange to see you rate Parasyte a 3.5/5 yet you wouldn't mind if it wins anime of the year. Was 2014 a fairly weak year of anime to you?



Parasyte:
1. I try my best to avoid using "realistic" as a pro when it comes to describing a character's development or overall characterization because there are so many factors that can determine and explain a person's actions, whether they are reasonable or questionable. Besides, it is overused and usually never explained by people. Personally, I think Shinichi, Migi, and Reiko are the only good "realistic, well-developed characters" in Parasyte. [Character Spoilers for the anime so far:](/s "It was interesting to witness Shinichi transform from a regular High School student to a cold-hearted character who resembles closely to the parasites. On the contrary, Migi and Reiko become more 'human like' as the series progresses. Of the three, Reiko would probably be my favorite character in the series because Shinichi's transformation is the only thing interesting about him (he's more like a test subject in an experiment than a character I should be caring about) and Migi primarily exists to contribute to Shinichi's development and explain the bodily functions and mindset of parasites. Even so, Reiko's character conclusion could have been better. I can see why she changes her face to look like Shinichi's mother but it would have been better if Reiko reserved her original form and gave the baby to Shinichi."). The dialogue in Parasyte is pretty standard when it comes to narratives found in anime but it can be quite annoying to listen and read at times because of what people are saying (example: "Are you really Izumi" x 5, "my shining white knight" (or something along those lines from Kana)). Reiko's lines are the most engaging to read and listen to since she is a fairly unique parasyte who likes to remain observant and practical among her group of parasites.

2. Madhouse did a great job showcasing Parasyte in a modern style because much of the issues and overarching themes found in the anime (and manga) series are absolutely relevant today. The story is very promising as well and it has a lot of potential to engage anime watchers into a horror-like anime with prevalent social and moral issues. It's too bad that Parasyte's presentation is lacking in polish and this can be easily noticed when you recognize the declining animation quality and mediocre shots of animated scenes. Consider this, the opening scene for the first episode of Parasyte reveals the parasites as monsters that can morph into disfigured and horrifying abominations (the parasite that ate the lady's head and the dog-parasite thing). Now, the animation quality of parasites morphing into combat forms or anything else is only decent and the show slowly loses its body-horror elements (Reiko splitting her head into two in front of a couple). While Parasyte may not try to be a body-horror anime, it could have been one and it would mix really well with the themes it has going with it (monsters being humans and humans being monsters).

3. As you can tell, I am fairly disappointed with Parasyte. Now don't get the wrong idea, it is a good show and I look forward to watching it every week. However, Madhouse had the rights to animate a manga series with a lot of potential yet they still haven't properly animate and reveal Parasyte as a meaningful anime series.



Fate/Stay Night:
1. I personally thought an appropriate amount of information was given to the main character during scenes of exposition (when it comes to anime as a medium). The biggest example of exposition and "info-dumping" I can think of is in episode 2 where Kirei explains the Holy Grail War to Shirou. Although I am fully aware of and understand the circumstances and rules of the War from Fate/Zero and other Fate works, it is understandable for Kirei to "dump" this information to Shirou because he knows absolutely nothing about it. This is "realistic." And much of the exposition and info-dumping people recognize is nothing more than dialogue between two or more characters. This is pretty standard in most action anime but it is somewhat more prominent in Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay night (Big 3, Noragami, Gurren Lagann, etc.)

2. You may have to elaborate more on why you think pacing is bad. I can't fully comment on that. I have to disagree with you on progress and consequence in the series so far. [As of now](/s "Rider is dead, Saber is a slave to Caster, Shirou's survivor guilt colors his character even further, etc."). You can use the same argument of similarity with Parasyte in such a broad manner ([in Parasyte](/s "Shinichi meets parasite (Migi), fight happens (dog and parasite who cuts his own arm. Shinichi meets parasite (Reiko), fight happens ('A' or 'B' or whatever letter). Shinichi meets parasite (mom), fight happens (mom). Shinichi meets parasite (guy who later gets his face burned), fight happens")). You're oversimplifying the set-up of an anime series when you can do the same thing with most anime series. Most of these common set-ups (this happens, then that happens) are pretty standard in anime nowadays and it is understandable because any other set-up would usually break narrative consistency and flow.

3. The 'inconsistency of tone' you pointed out with F/SN also exists in other anime series (like Parasyte- these monsters are killing and eating humans but Migi turns into a dick => hahaha that's funny because it's a dick). A better way to describe this inconsistency is calling it comic relief. As a storytelling standpoint, comic relief has its uses so long as it is used effectively (it doesn't make sense to use comic relief in a Greek Tragedy and Fate/Stay Night is by no means a Greek Tragedy. Neither is Parasyte).

4. I agree that the characters are not the best aspect of F/SN. I was quite disappointed to see the lack of depth in characters, especially since I watched F/Z before F/SN UBW.

5. I'm not too bothered with Shirou's plot armor because there is a reason why he can recover quickly after battles (if you watched F/Z, [minor spoiler:](/s "remember how Iri was able to recover quickly and easily after Kirei stabs her with numerous daggers at the same time?")). Shirou still receives major injuries after participating in battles so it is not as ridiculous as other action anime. You can say that Parasyte also suffers from a main character who has apparent plot armor but that is explained in the episode right after [spoiler:](/s "Shinichi's mother stabs him through the heart"). The 'plot armors' found in both series are justified, yet they are still ridiculous to watch.

6. A major criticism I have for F/SN UBW is that some of the scenes require people to play/watch/whatever the VN beforehand. A big example can be found [during the fight between](/s "Shirou and the teacher. After Shirou successfully projects Archer's swords, he was capable of fending off the teacher's lightning fast attacks with a fighting style similar to Archer's. People who read the VN told others that projection magic allows its user to use the same skill as the thing they are projecting from or something along those lines yet this vital information was not shown anywhere in the F/SN UBW anime. I like to interpret scenes from subtle nuances and minimal action sequences but this is just blatantly poor adaptation of a seemingly important scene").
>> ARTICLE
I sometimes I feel like I'm in a very small group of people that doesn't really like Parasyte. :/
>> ARTICLE
No, there are lots of people with shit taste so you aren't alone lol. 

The first time I voted I think I picked HxH over Oarasyte for the simple fact that it was finished and they both hit similar themes and were overall pretty similar (and equal). But since it seems HxH will definitely win, I'll pack Parasyte this time just cuz. Still those are the 2 best shows of the year by far IMO.

I do think you're delaying the inevitable. Hunter x Hunter is currently #4 Highest-Rated Anime (Of All Time) on MAL. It won on several other polls on other anime sites. And it was top on several reviewer's 2014 top list I saw. I can't imagine it not winning here. Togashi is truly one of the best storytellers in the anime/manga world.

No, I agree. I just want it to be fair. This poll is already more equal than the last one was.

Lets hope /r/hunterxhunter wont ruin this again by getting their biased voters in.

There is no way that it wasn't tampered with from the outside. Getting over 900 people from a sub with 9000 subscribers vote on a poll where Kill la Kill has only amassed 30 votes as the 2nd place entry... don't make me laugh
>> ARTICLE
I've seen both Kill la Kill and Hunter x Hunter.. and I still voted for HxH. You can't even compare the two. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree, my point was that this sub loves Kill la Kill and there is no way that HxH could get 900 votes in the same amount of time that Kill la Kill got 30.

They will. Trust me on that, they will. As much as I like HxH, it's fanbase is pretty terrible in that regard.

This game is called getting all your subscribers in a subreddit to make a biased vote I mean cmon /r/hunterxhunter

Now that D-Frag didn't make it to the final 20, I think I have to vote for Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun too. 
>> ARTICLE
And I'll stick with my Barakamon :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh, Barakamon is up there. I'll definitely give it that much. I'd place it in a massive tie with Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Shirobako. Alas, my beloved Gin no Saji had a fairly weak season and dropped to around third with Nisekoi and Kill la Kill.
>> ARTICLE
Out of all those I've only seen Kill la Kill,  Barakamon and Nisekoi. So I can't really agree or disagree. :p
>> ARTICLE
Such a shame, although I loved Tokyo Ghoul if it was adapted properly (without censorship and followed the manga completley) it could have easily been a top contender.

I hope this series gets the brotherhood treatment so much.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who binge-read the manga last week, before Thursday's episode, I have to agree with you: had it been adapted properly, Tokyo Ghoul would've been a strong contender for AotY.

I can assure you that Akame ga Kill! would've, too. They cut the best parts of the manga to rush the anime-original ending. So much wasted potential.

I've seen Ping Pong. It was a hard choice but I voted for HxH. I'm not surprised if Ping Pong won't win. A lot were turned off by the art. 
>> ARTICLE
One show that wasn't very popular but was very good winning isn't a sign the place has shit taste. Ping Pong was an amazing show but I didn't pick it, I picked Parasyte. Next up would have been Hunter x Hunter then Ping Pong, followed by Gin no Saji and Kill la Kill. Honestly, if any of these shows won I would say /r/anime doesn't totally have shit taste. The problem is there are a lot of shows on the list that aren't memorable or do anything different or special, yet get nominated because they are good or entertaining. I like Nozaki Kun but anime of the year? I don't think I'll ever pick a run of the mill comedy rom com as a best if the year (even though it does subvert the genre and all that jazz, I'm not taking away the merits of the show). There are lots of shows on the list like this, good shows that I honestly don't deserve to be in the same rank as those shows that truly do something different and groundbreaking instead of just changing a few things from a well established formula. 
>> ARTICLE
Agree. Saying people have shit taste because you're anime didn't win sounds like sour grapes to me.

I have a feeling hunterxhunter is going to win, they have a lot more fans and this is really just a popularity contest. As opposed to Ping Pong which is also pretty great but doesnt have as many fans.

I'm surprised Comet Lucifer didn't make the biggest disappointment final, that anime was such a let down and huge amounts people dropped it after 3 or 4 episodes.

Because nobody expected anything out of it in the first place, unlike AldnoahZero, Tokyo Ghoul, and Gangsta.
>> ARTICLE
Sure it wasn't hyped as much as those ones but on first impressions most people liked it and it was pretty high up on viewers at the start of the season. If you go back and watch some first impressions videos on youtube most seem to like it and say it has allot of potential. Also it turned out to be far worse than Gangsta at least in my opinion, can't comment on the other ones though as I have not seen them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was definitely a bit worse than Gangsta. I haven't seen them yet, but from what I've heard, TG and AZ were extremely disappointing compared to their first seasons, but at least they had higher production values and cool music compared to Gangsta and Comet Lucifer.

Eh, I just didn't include them because then I would have to spend more time looking into whether they've gotten released in the US, and if they haven't, if there was fansubs and stuff. Kyoani only had 2, but I'm sure there would be a lot more of them to look up if I included them across the board.

Didn't people point out multiple times in the discussions that it only seemed this way because lesser players had the "boring" section of the music playing, while greater players had the more "exciting" sections? They were literally playing different scores.

I've said it 100 times and I'll say it again, Nodame Cantabile wipes the floor with YLIA in every respect, including the music.  You could hear Chiaki and Nodame playing the same piece and have your eyes closed and know which one was Nodame.

YLiA was decent but A1 also made a bunch of shit or 'meh' shows so that has to detract from it.

**Studio of the Year**: Honestly, my largest chunk of votes are going to *Shirobako*, including best Studio for P.A. Works. That being said, it's a lot to ask of one series to represent an entire studio (believe me, I know, I *watched* Shirobako). So my vote's going to **Madhouse** for their stellar run this year.

**Surprise:** Did you just read what I said? **Shirobako.** A show about making anime never needed to be what it was. It could've been a live action documentary. It could've been boring as hell. Nonetheless, every frame of Shirobako is bursting with passion, so it has my vote. Though Shokugeki no Souma would be a close second. That show has no business being so good.

**Disappointment:** Probably going to **Charlotte.** Though truthfully, I only got about halfway. So my vote's only partway valid.
>> ARTICLE
Jun Maeda should stick to writing songs for Nagi Yanagi.

That or he needs to negotiate for a 24 episode series since he always runs into the problem of trying to swallow an object larger than his head and characters end up being underdeveloped. Granted he tried to cut down the number of characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats but it's clear that he's still trying to stuff too much into a single cour.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, he spent a lot of his precious 13 episodes with [Charlotte spoiler](/s "Misa/Yusa and Takajo who were in the end irrelevant to the plot. I'm sure if he cut out things like the baseball episode and spent less time with characters like Misa/Yusa and Takajo and more with characters like Kumagami he could have told a much better story.") 13 episodes isn't that incredibly short; Madoka took up only 12 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I second pretty much everything in this post, besides the fact that I didn't only get halfway through Charlotte, I actually endured the entire shitfest. Honestly, up until halfway through it wasn't half as bad as it got later on when the major shenanigans got introduced. That should give you a slight idea of... well, how bad it was, lol.

Madhouse should win for sure. One fantastic show and 5 good shows.

IMO the biggest surprise is Shirobako, Osomatsu or Rokka no Yuusha. Come on guys, Shoukugeki isn't a surprise it was a fairly popular manga.

Biggest disappointment is a toss up and could easily go to anyone except Gangsta IMO.
>> ARTICLE
> Shoukugeki isn't a surprise it was a fairly popular manga.

Even if it wasn't totally well-known before the ample tosh skinship artwork would at least snag the young horny males demographic, and JC Staff has the manpower to make it not suck. 
>> ARTICLE
It was tough deciding on my biggest surprise of the year.

I ended up going with Osomatsu-san, but Rokka came close. Going into the summer season I had dismissed Rokka no Yuusha as just another LN-harem'y-action show that I wasn't even going to pick up. It ended up being one of my favorites of the season. However,  Osomatsu-san was so far off my radar I wasn't in the slightest aware of it going into last season, and while it hasn't ended, it's one of my absolute favorite shows of 2015.
>> ARTICLE
i'm still surprised Garo: Crimson Moon didn't make it to the finals. That was a bigger dissapointment than Charlotte imo, because with that we kinda know that Maeda isn't good for telling stories in 13 episodes. But still voted for Charlotte tho, i expeced it to be good and it wasn't, at all.

i expected DBS and RootA to suck, and didn't watch Gangsta.

I'm still baffled on how Shokugeki is considered a "surprise". Everyone knew it's popularity. It's bullshit to call it "surprise".
>> ARTICLE
I don't actually recall too much hype for Soma prior to release, actually. It was about the same as any semi-popular series getting an anime adaptation, I think.

I think the big surprise is that people didn't expect cooking to be so entertaining.
>> ARTICLE
How come Kyoto Animation only did one anime last year? Or am I reading something wrong?
>> ARTICLE
The studio also released two films last year: *Kyoukai no Kanata I'll Be Here* and *High Speed! -Free! Starting Days-*. They're not listed because of *reasons*.
>> ARTICLE
Looking at surprise is kind of weird since you could see the quality/twists of a lot of these coming from just being a manga reader or looking at the staff involved. I think my vote would either have to be Osomatsu-san for coming out of nowhere with a manga that's old as dirt or Shirobako off sheer quality, even if there were good expectations going in.
>> ARTICLE
>Looking at surprise is kind of weird since you could see the quality/twists of a lot of these coming from just being a manga reader or looking at the staff involved.

Not necessarily, it could be a really bad adaptation of a manga/VN/LN/whatever, and every Studio has a dud here and there. Remember Madhouse's Mahou Sensou? Or P.A. Work's Glasslip?


>> ARTICLE
Notice I said the staff, which is usually unrelated to Studio. I'm pretty sure that doesn't change your point because Mahou Sensou and Glasslip might have had good staff working behind them too, but studio is usually only a good indicator with KyoAni because of how self-reliant the company is.

Regardless, the thing is that while it is true that people turn out duds and there's bad adaptations, that doesn't change the fact that those are the best things to look for when you want to predict how something can turn out.
>> ARTICLE
Surprise:  Definitely Shirobako.  Was fascinating to learn about the Japanese animation industry and process.

Although I quite enjoyed Shokugeki no Souma a good bit as well and was completely surprised at how entertaining and amusing a show about intense competitive cooking could be.  Also pretty much every episode made me hungry.

Disappointment:  Aldnoah.Zero 2nd season.  Ugh.  I enjoyed the 1st season so much, and then to see ....this.  Just ugh.
>> ARTICLE
*I didn't watch many shows this year, so this is definitely biased.*

#Studio of the year

My personal pick for Studio of the Year was J.C. Staff. Shokugeki no Souma was amazing (my AotY) and I watched a few episodes of Prison School, it was a good adaptation. But I dropped it in favor of the manga. I personally think that Madhouse is overhyped this year. Parasyte wasn't all that great (and in my opinion, rather bad), Death Parade was pretty forgettable (only remembered I watched it when I was doing these awards), and I didn't watch the rest except the obvious One Punch Man which I agree lives up to (most of) the hype. I haven't seen much else on there, so I'm abstaining.

#Biggest Surprise

Since I mentioned before that Shokugeki no Souma is my AotY, you'd probably guess I'm voting for that. Nah. I figured it would be good based on what people were saying here. That being said, I was a little surprised on just how great it really was. My Biggest Surprise is definitely Saekano. I heard about it through /r/anime, but the premise was kind of bland sounding, and I really only watched it because /u/banjothebear (I think it was him, anyways) was raving about Utaha somewhere. I never expected it to be something I'd zoom through in a couple days (especially in a time where I get lucky if I finish a 12 episode series in a month). But since Saekano isn't in the thread, I'm abstaining. 

#Biggest Disappointment

Finally, an easy one! Definitely Ninja Slayer. It was hyped up to be a satire anime about American preconceptions of Ninjas, and instead we got YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTT aka Inferno Cop 2.0. Definitely my biggest disappointment. I was super disappointed in Gangsta. as well, so I'll vote for that.

What are your picks?
>> ARTICLE
The question is, is these votes based on enjoyment from the anime a studio adapted, or the overall quality of the anime? And then, did you judge the Madhouse anime based on your personal enjoyment, or the actual quality? One Punch Man probably has the best animation ever seen in an anime so in quality it definitely lives up to the hype. Parasyte has pretty good animation, art is great and the soundtracks are fantastic, the first half was more liked than the second half which probably can't be helped too much on Madhouse's side. Can't say anything about Death Parade. 

Don't get me wrong though, Shokugeki no Souma is one of my favourite anime as well, they really nailed the music and the animation is on point but as much as I enjoyed it, I don't think it's quite in the same league as One Punch Man, looking at quality. Especially considering that One Punch Man was adapted with combined efforts of I believe several studios. 
>> ARTICLE
I think all of your questions are valid. But I also think that comes up to each person's taste and opinions. Thinking about it more, I think David Productions (Jojo) would get my runner up because of the way they seemed to just... enjoy adapting it? They changed things, added some actual good filler and adding little things in fights that made them better overall (IMO).

So, I guess for me it's more of the heart? Shokugeki no Souma seemed to have a lot of heart. Everything in it was pretty much perfection in my book.
>> ARTICLE
If anything has a lot of heart, it's One Punch Man. The people working on OPM had a video talking about how much fun it is working on OPM, they added a couple of filler scenes as well to satisfy the viewers (they added scenes of best girl Tatsumaki). And then Murata made a tweet saying something like "I will work really hard to make sure One Punch Man gets a second season". If that's not heart, then I don't know what is.

We all have our opinions, and no opinion is wrong so I'm not going to say you're wrong or anything like that. If you feel that Shokugeki no Souma is perfection in your eyes, then I'm just trying to convince you that OPM is above perfection :D

Oh, don't get me wrong. OPM was great. I just liked SnS more :p

I'm still rather surprised that Chaos Dragon didn't show up for Biggest Disappointment. Hyped so much higher than Charlotte, yet dropped right off the map after the first episode aired. Truly and completely sad how much potential was wasted...

eeh, I feel like those who only jumped on the "OMG IT'S WRITTEN BY NASU AND UROBUCHI" bandwagon didn't realise how amazing and fun Red Dragon is. Their expectations were basically hollow and baseless. Nasu managed to draw out a great story arc for his character, Narita and Urobuchi being the crazy entertaining wildcards as per usual, and the two newbies slowly finding their way alongside their characters is great to read. The anime version destroyed all of it.

Fuck Nasu for not letting Sanda do the writing for the anime.

Red Dragon sounded fun.

Chaos Dragon, on the other hand...

Were you there to witness their game or is there a trace of it floating around the web?

The light novel is called red dragon and I think there is a translation available, it is written by Makoto Sanda who should have helped with the anime but Nasu told him to focus on other stuff.

Oh I see. Thanks.

The LN is basically the transcript of the sessions, including the moments when the players marveled at the little characters figures Good Smile Company made for them, or the moment Narita made his grande entrance foiling Urobuchi's little assassination plan because the target is now a player character

Well, it does sound funnier than the anime, that's for sure. Urobichi getting dicked for once sounds funny too, hahaha.

He had this entire elaborate scheme to fool his party members so he can go on a solo mission, made impossible rolls to bypass the security, got to the target, and the then GM introduces Narita to the table

He was basically speechless while the other players are having a blast at his expense

Gotta hand it over to **Madhouse** for the best studio. Their animation is dank.

As much as I'd like to hand it over to KyoAni, they only specialize on their post-processing FX.

e: [OPM](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30276) is now 8.99 lmao.




>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately, because One Punch Man is a parody, you'll either love it or you don't like it. If people vote purely based on the quality, animation, art, music etc then I'd expect it to be much higher but because people rate it based on enjoyment it's going to drop.
>> ARTICLE
loool? Kyoani animation is far better than madhouse's, which holds up by few scenes with sakuga while the rest of the show have an above average animation but nothing spectacular, it looks good, but not as good as kyoani's
>> ARTICLE
Really? I believe all the hype on KyoAni is because of their awesome post-processing effects and not the smoothness of animation.

We're talking about animation here (fluidity, smoothness, w/e you wanna call it) and not art.

e: I don't know what Sakuga is sorry. lol.
>> ARTICLE
Sakuga is a moment in a show where the animation is drastically better than the usual one (Like the fights is OPM compared to the rest of the anime). Madhouse sacrifices consistency for the sake of much higher quality in scenes they consider more important.

KyoAni on the other side, has [consistently](https://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/16275/animated-artist_unknown-character_acting-fabric-ha) [great quality](https://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/16158/animated-artist_unknown-character_acting-hair-hibi) through the entire show, while also having [sakuga](https://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/16157/animated-artist_unknown-hair-hibike-_euphonium-run).

Which one can be considered "better animation" is up to you, I personaly think KyoAni is the one.

Damn, that's crazy. Pretty sure it was at 9.15 before the first SotY thread. I'll change it.

The highest OPM got to was 9.08 I believe, but yeah, it's dropped quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Give something enough 1's and anything will drop. There was a campaign at MAL to drop it out of the 9.00+ range 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, it was never staying above 9, with or without people giving it a bunch of 1's out of spite.  There was nearly an equal number of people counter-jerkin with 10 ratings so I'd say that they probably balanced each other out.  It just isn't a 9+ show and now that the hype is dying down you see the result *shrug*.  It'll likely continue to drop further I would imagine, though it'll probably stick in the top 100.
>> ARTICLE
Never said it was a 9+ show. I just find it silly people get worked up over something so trivial. Like I said they campaigned to get it out of the 9+ range. Whether it is a 9+ show to some people is completely  subjective. Maybe it would or wouldn't have stayed without the 1's, but know we'll never know.
>> ARTICLE
Again though, there was an equal amount of people giving it 10s to counter-jerk, so I imagine we *will* know ;P
>> ARTICLE
Counter-jerk has stopped for a long time, the 1's will keep coming however.
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it, that's just confirmation bias.  There's only so many people fanatical enough in their hatred or love of the show to keep that up.  The more likely answer is simple: it isn't a 9+ show and it is now equalizing to where it is appropriately rated.  The only reason it probably hasn't dropped like a rock at this point is precisely because people *haven't* been giving it 1s.  They've probably been giving it 7s and 8s so it is slowly adjusting.
>> ARTICLE
It dropped from 9.08 to 8.99 in under 4 weeks, and is still dropping. So dropped like a rock is pretty accurate. The only reason it's slowed down is because they've switched their focus to Boku dake ga Inai Machi

That's hilarious. Just goes to show how immature MAL users are to get worked up over something so trivial.

Studio of the year- wow Madhouse had a great year.  A-1 had some great shows, but they also had that steaming pile of turds, Gunslinger Stratos.  Vote goes to Madhouse

Suprise- This is easy pick, Shirobako.  It could have been way boring, but it turned out to be one of my favorite shows

Disappointment- I would like to vote for Charlotte, but my vote goes to Gangsta, for bringing down an entire studio with it
>> ARTICLE
Gangsta had little to do with Manglobe's bankruptcy. The studio management couldn't pay their bills because they weren't being hired to work on anything. They weren't high up on any committees (mostly weren't on any committees, meaning they just got paid a set amount to animate) and didn't get any payments from disc sales/merchandise/etc on most shows (would only get royalties for some IPs they owned). It's faulty to blame that production when this was years in the making.
>> ARTICLE
Why is Gangsta in Biggest Disappointment? I thought the characters were really good and that

The animation was very poor at the 2nd half of the season and it ended in the middle of everything.

Too bad the studio had no money to go on.
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse, Shokugeki and Charlotte. The picks get more difficult tomorrow 
>> ARTICLE
I wonder what people would select on "biggest surprise"

I took it to mean the anime that was literally the most surprising. Not necessarily better than the others but the most unexpected according to what I thought I'd get.
>> ARTICLE
Could someone explain to me how Charlotte was disappointing?
>> ARTICLE
MC' radical personality switch going from episode 1 to episode 2. Underdeveloped characters across the entire cast. Massive pacing issues, especially after a certain important event happens and at the end where an entire season's worth of potential content is crammed in 20 minutes. Most of all though, these are issues that Angel Beats shared and it was said it would not happen again. 
>> ARTICLE
Could also add that underdeveloped characters were not only underdeveloped, but actually all but forgotten for almost half of the show (!!!), poor handling of [spoilers](/s "time travel, like, REALLY POOR USAGE OF IT"), the sheer amount of stupid exaggerated tropes, and let's not even mention [the](/s "terrorists").

As a silverlning at least had very pretty visuals and good music. But holy fuck was the story a clusterfuck.
>> ARTICLE
Banjo. You kind of kill me with this review. Simply because of the Murano hatred. Only kind of though...I can't be angry at the bear. 

My defense for Murano is (I am absolutely going to get hate for this) something I've been saying in the discussion threads for awhile. Keep with me because I don't have time to re-watch the entire series for the full details but this is what I remember from it. Imagine, if you would, one of your friends acting completely different. And I think it's pretty damned fair to say that Shinichi throughout the entire series was different from before his momma got axed. Now, he comes back looking completely different and acting insanely different. The Peter Parker effect if you will. I think that no one EXCEPT for Murano (and maybe her close friends) noticed a change. I put her situation into the same situation where a father/mother has died, but something much more drastic has happened to Shinichi on top of that. She wants to help but there is really nothing she can do and she's frustrated with both him and herself. Something that he can't explain to her, and she cannot understand. I always really REALLY enjoyed that about this series. There was a large push with wanting the one to see the others point of view.

Which park scene are we talking here? Is it the one where Migi is all clawed up and about to strike? or the one with the Baby? The police officer speech to me was a "Why the fuck must you continue to hassle him?!" kind of thing which I found to be fair. 

The sex scene I would say was warranted. I don't think that a love interest has to be in every single episode of the show but I think that when he/she is in there they have to have an impact. We saw Murano a good majority of the episodes and some of the more important scenes she's in. I remember they went on multiple dates and there was an extra tension to the date because of the fact that it was a "will he tell her or won't he" kind of thing going. I can see how dangling that carrot in front of the audience can be a bit cumbersome but I felt it was effective. The scene to me was symbolizing that whether or not she understands him, she's still there for him. (AND BECAUSE NO MAN WANTS TO DIE AFTER GETTING THE APPLE PI- Sorry, sorry. Read that in a discussion thread)

I also really enjoyed the rooftop scene because it was an acceptance thing. A plea to Shinichi that he didn't have to say or answer to this murderer or anyone else what or who he is. Because his actions have spoken throughout his life. I feel like a broken record while talking about this but damnit man, I dealt with too much Murano hate!

To a degree I understand that people don't care for Murano. I, however, do not find Murano to be a bad character in the slightest. The best character? Far from it, but I honestly enjoyed seeing her on screen. I really enjoyed Parasyte but I think your review overall is a just one. I'd love to hear your counters to what I've brought up, as I'm certain we will discuss this further.  <3 you Banjo
>> ARTICLE
Thief! Hope you are doing well.

> The Peter Parker effect if you will.

So, that's not a bad interpretation of it. Perhaps *because* Murano was so confused, that proved that she was the only one who really cared about his well-being. It's difficult to say, really. I can't deny that if one of my good friends suddenly went completely the opposite direction emotionally that I would just ignore their condition. At least, I hope I wouldn't. However, I know for a fact that I *would not* mindlessly repeat a single, solitary, unhelpful phrase every time I encountered him/her.

> or the one with the Baby?

The baby one; she walks away, gets magically pulled back by her dead "rival," shows up, doesn't do anything remotely worthwhile, and that's it. :(

> ...kind of thing which I found to be fair.

I found the writing in and cuts in that whole situation to be strange. As in, she was overreacting *extremely* hard. "Why is it always Shinichi?" Murano, you *know* something is up, yet you're asking such a nonsensical question.

Perhaps I'm just being too hard on her; she is a teenage girl, after all. I just couldn't get behind her when everything that came out of her mouth was either boring, tired, or stupid. :3

> The scene to me was symbolizing that whether or not she understands him, she's still there for him.

Hrmm. I guess you found Murano's and Shinichi's relationship to be a lot closer than I did. Diverting a bit, but romance is my favorite genre. So when I see a rather lame couple within a show -- especially in one like this -- where their emotional connection is either unknown or too forced, then I don't sympathize with the characters or their "love" for one another.

Plus, even during *that* scene, she says, "You really are Shinichi." Yeesh!

> I feel like a broken record while talking about this but damnit man, I dealt with too much Murano hate!

No, I can sense your passion, and your arguments are legitimate. Defending her is great in this context, because it gives everyone two separate perspectives.

As for the rooftop, I can't say I agree. Migi "leaves," which is obviously going to be used within that episode for some "I'm always with you" type deal (which comes true with Migi saving Murano). Murano gets taken hostage, but at this point in the show, her voice/characterization/persona is so weak that there isn't enough reason to care about her well-being. Sure, I was feeling somewhat bad for her (white-knight and what-not), but I didn't particularly *care* for what she was going through, because her character never gave me the chance.

Edit: Great comment, by the way. Always love a differing viewpoint, and yours was a good one, Thief!
>> ARTICLE
It's my first time doing something like this so I appreciate the kind words :)
 

I found that rooftop scene to be special because like I said. I really enjoyed Murano as a character. She felt so conflicted throughout the series sometimes moreso than Shinichi especially when he was very emotionless. The whole scene to me was coming full circle. And I totally missed the "Migi coming back" part for a good 30 seconds because I was like "NONONONONONONONO"...So yeah...I'm guilty on that one. 

The baby one I felt had a meaning...but I'd have to watch it again honestly -.-. But I loved the Rooftop scene. Maybe I'm just a sucker for those types of endings (and I absolutely love Kana Hanazawa's voice. Ever since I saw Kawaii Complex...Ritsu Kawai <3) but I found it to be great. And especially with all the shitty endings from recent series (except for Shigatsu) I'm glad I could at least enjoy one. 

Lastly. I honestly would need a count of how many times she said "Are you really Shinichi-Kun?" 'cause I heard it like...4-5 times at max? Also the last line was something to the effect of "The reason you did that is because you're Shinichi". In reference to the dog threw away in the trash and then realized what he did and buried it. Unless I'm thinking of the wrong part?? 
>> ARTICLE

Haha, I can see you in my mind's eye! Did you reach out towards the screen? :P

I will say, his scream right as he thought he lost her was pretty spot-on. Big props to Nobunaga for his performance.

> ...and I absolutely love Kana Hanazawa's voice. Ever since I saw Kawaii Complex...Ritsu Kawai <3

That one was a nice anime as well; loved her eyes and voice, too. :3

> ...4-5 times at max?

All I know is, it was 423 times too many. :P

> Unless I'm thinking of the wrong part??

Nope, that's right. But it's of the same form/subject; "Are you really Shinichi? Yes, because you saved the dog." Murano's entire dialogue literally revolves around that question, because the writers couldn't give her anything worthy to say. Not until her literal life was on the line. :3
>> ARTICLE
People also completely exaggerate the "Are you really Shinichi?" thing. She says that line what, five times in the show? By that logic, every single character with a catchphrase is entirely insufferable. 
>> ARTICLE
It's also important to consider that her role in the anime is (from what I've heard) basically her role in the manga, which is influenced by the time period when it came out as well; I don't think there were too many old manga with brilliantly-written female characters that had a lot of depth.
>> ARTICLE
Not only do I not hate you, but I have gained more respect for Murano. (Though that was already on the rise since the last episode)

Thanks for putting my thoughts into words.
>> ARTICLE
Imo murano was used fine and the role she played in the story was established very early. She was Shinichis connection to his "humanity" so to speak and her actions were extremely realistic for a good friend and mutual crush (which was from months before the series started). I agree that she could've used more screen time but to say that she "literally ruined everything in the show" and that it wouldve been better without her are opinions I cant agree with even slightly.

I read ~75% of your review this time. I never read standard reviews so that's a feat. I'm thinkin that means you did a pretty good job on this one.

That's fine, you explained your reasoning below. I can see where your coming from certainly, but I found the everything beyond the initial arc to just drag along everything nice that it set up so intricately.

The story for my I thought it was above good. Sure there was an arc that I didn't like, like the ending arc with the extermination arc I didn't like it that much but the mom arc cemented a 8/10 or higher. 
>> ARTICLE
That's the problem with scores. Scores are by nature completely arbitrary and should not be taken seriously without proper reasoning (which banjo did give us.)

One person's 5/10 means that the show is utter horsecrap, another's 5/10 means the show was average, nothing too special, but not necessarily bad.
>> ARTICLE
I'd assume /u/Painn23 doesn't agree with Banjo's reasoning for the score, either.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, Banjo first I will say that your analysis is well written and I am a fan of your reviews, however don't you think you are focusing a bit too much on the negative aspects of the show here. I know who cares about scores but according to you this show would be considered average or mediocre on your rating scale. The show defiantly had its hiccups with the plot I will admit that. There were some elements I wanted the show to explore a bit more, but you have to admit the theme Shinichi and Migi brought on through working together through this ordeal was fairly touching. We see a reserved boy who is just going about his life with no regard to anything in the outside world aside from school and his friends. Then when this lifeform takes control over part of his body, he is forced to change for the better or worse. He now has to deal with the danger of other parasites and their potential threat to society. He is just a high school student, but grows through getting past his mother's and friend's death. He has to deal with a lot for a kid his age and develops accordingly. We go from a scared teenager in the beginning who would most likely run from danger to a grown character willing to take harm for the women he cares about. Would the Shinichi in the beginning of the story take that knife for Murano? Maybe, maybe not. Both Migi and Shinichi drive each other to develop as they interact with the situation they are forced into. Now would this really qualify as a mediocre story in your eyes? Looking at your list you rated Sakura Trick with a 6. While this is arguable, Sakura Trick had incredibly little to no character development at all. The leads do the same thing every episode and there is no central plot at all. While Parasyte had its problems does it really deserve such a harsh punishment to be thrown in with the massive plot holes of Mirri Nikki or the parody that is Twintails? Doesn't Parasyte at the very least have a solid story to tell about a character's development in a dangerous situation? 

I know this is all arguable and is just my opinion on the matter, I mean no disrespect toward you or your review. I do think you bring some very valid points regarding the story and characters. Its just a bit difficult for me to see Parasyte as a mediocre show that could be bunched in with the harems of the season. 
>> ARTICLE
Hi, Hate!

> Hey, Banjo first I will say that your analysis is well written and I am a fan of your reviews...

I'm very humbled to hear that. Truly, I am. It's still weird to me when people say they are "fans" of what I do. I'm not sure if I'll ever get used to hearing that, but when I someone *does* say that, like you have here, it makes me supremely happy. :)

> We go from a scared teenager in the beginning who would most likely run from danger to a grown character willing to take harm for the women he cares about.

True, and when looked at like that, that is a *huge* swing. From one side to the next, he appears to be have grown considerably. Unfortunately, I don't see it so much as personal growth as *circumstantial* growth. What do I mean by that? Essentially, his growth isn't so much the result of learning or experiencing, but having himself *physically altered* by the situations he's in. Put another way, it's a growth spurt versus natural, progressive growth.

> Sakura Trick, Mirrai Nikki, Twintails

You bring up a good point, something that is always up for debate. One of the difficulties of comparing all of these anime is in the genre they find themselves in. Sakura Trick is the furthest thing from Parasyte. The first is about lesbian lovers while the second is about a boy dealing with aliens (generalization, of course, for both). So, it comes down to *execution*, rather than a comparative determination. While I don't have a review to back up my Sakura Trick rating (this was seen before my days of reviewing), I found that Sakura Trick set out what it wanted to do at least slightly above average. No, it doesn't have a story. No, it doesn't have deep themes. But it's a nicely put together yuri show with some cuteness and kissing. It doesn't *need* to be anything more than that.

Parasyte, though, tried to be a philosophical narrative about the effects of special differences. And it failed on that front. Now, Shinichi is a nice character, as is the dynamic between him and Migi. But each is not so great that it warrants making the score supremely high (7, 8, 9, 10).

Could it be slightly higher? Of course! Even slightly lower. You bring up good points about the anime and its direction. Unfortunately, my experience with the show found it to be lacking that aforementioned execution, and subsequently, it received the rating I gave it.

> I know this is all arguable and is just my opinion on the matter, I mean no disrespect toward you or your review

None taken! You are being completely respectful. And while it is "just your opinion," stick by it! A good friend of mine got me off that idea of falling on the "it's just opinion" idea. What you have to say is just as valid as what I have to say, and seeing you take the time to talk about it with me shows that your points hold great meaning behind them.

> Its just a bit difficult for me to see Parasyte as a mediocre show that could be bunched in with the harems of the season

If it's any consolation, I gave Absolute Duo a 2/10, and will probably be giving many of the other quite the low scores soon.

I can't always get the ratings right, so the only thing I can do is interpret, argue, and analyze the anime as best as I can and present it here in as intelligent a manner as I can. And hopefully, I've done that here! :3

Thanks for the great comment, Hate. I'm happy to have you here in the thread, and I hope to see you in later ones! :)

Gonna comment a bit late and throw my 2 cents in, I agree with most everything you said here, but still I feel that personally, a lot of these aren't as bad you might have put them, although Murano may have been a weak character, but she did serve her purpose as Shinichi's humanity of sorts. I also don't totally agree with the poorly developed romance, their are a lot of shows that do romance a lot worse than this, some shows that are well respected do romance worse than this.(To throw a few names out that I feel this way about Angel beats, Kimi ni Todoke, Garden of Words)

As for the soundtrack, I do feel somewhat alone on this, but as someone who doesn't listen to dubstep and doesn't really like the genre of music much, I really had no problems with those soundtracks in the context it was put it. Do I think a different song would of been better or worked just the same? Probably, but I don't feel that it detracted in any way.

About your points for the Darwinian evolution, at the end, this isn't really a defense, just sort of how I took the series. I always thought the Parastites had an extreme capacity for learning, which allowed them to adjust to social customs quickly, as well as learn language and the like.

I also think this show benefited a lot from being watched week to week, with the constant cliffhangers that always left you wanting more if you were even slightly invested in the characters or story, which made it seem like you enjoyed the show more than you actually maybe did.

Although this was short and just sort of a stream of consciousness about the things that stuck out to me the most in your review, I'd like to end off by just saying that personally I don't think this show is the best of 2014 by any stretch either, it was at best slightly above average and at worst mediocre at what it wants to tell, but I do think it had quite a few high moments that can warrant a watch, if maybe not a rewatch.

You're not alone! I loved the soundtrack, and I generally have no real interest in dubstep or the like.

Mostly agree, I wasn't all that thrilled with Parasyte by the time it ended. It was by all means a decent and watchable show, but I felt it floundered around way too much after the first third and felt really sloppy and unfocused as you said. The last episode I thought was a pretty good ending, unfortunately I don't rate things based on the climax.  

The few really good episodes sprinkled in here and there didn't make up the many episodes of mediocrity for me. Definately agree that Murano was a shit and never said anything useful or important or thought provoking ever, she seemed to only serve as a plot device.  

Also off topic but please stop abusing smiley faces and emotes in every comment it triggers my autism, use them sparingly, like dank sprinkles on a meme sundae.

Hey, batman.

> The last episode I thought was a pretty good ending...

You know, I found the ending to be "meh," like the rest of the series itself. It didn't do much of anything, like the rest of the season before it. If anything, it just solidified how terrible of a character Murano was; after everything that happens to Shinichi, she is just one more problem that he has to deal with. :P

> ...use them sparingly, like dank sprinkles on a meme sundae.

No can do! They are way too much fun to use. :3

I enjoyed this anime. Unlike a lot of new anime just rehashing big boobs , male harem situations, and a lot of weird loner guy types trying to fess up to their feelings about a girl who then accepts them this one was more oriented on the whole human mentality and their actions when they are not on the top of the food chain anymore.

That's true, it definitely was a "different" experience. At the minimum, it was a bit more mature in its presentation of material, which can easily break up the monotony of many other shows.

> ...and their actions when they are not on the top of the food chain anymore.

Sort of, or at least, that's what they *want* you to think. Not in a conspiratorial fashion, but in a "here's one more idea to think about" fashion. That's just one more string they attached to the anime without tying up the other knots first. :P
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's good when you compare it to all the crappy harems that are there every season. However when you look at it on it's own and judge it on its own merit, it has a very messy story that tries too hard to focus on many things and ends up not accomplishing anything.

Well for me it wasn't that messy, but to each its own. I am just disappointed that we  get a good solid anime once per year given how many are released.

Isn't it a little weird to compare this show to harems though? Because if anything, it should compare to all the dark action/sci-fi horror shows out there. 
>> ARTICLE
I may have worded my thoughts wrongly. When I wrote this it was early morning. I meant that this show is different from others because it is not a harem show. Sure you could say that comparing this with harem shows is like comparing apples and oranges but I did that because of my taste in anime which leans towards Parasyte, Akame ga Kill, Steins Gate sort of things rather than harem shows.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. I think the big deal with many harems is that the genre can't afford to be too fatalistic, while stuff like Akame, Parasyte and others can, because they go for a more of a dark fantasy/sci-fi motif, hence everyone can be targets, even the protagonist. I guess some yandere shows might be the closest a harem show can get to being a dark fantasy/sci-fi.

[You can read my review for Tokyo Ghoul here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2gswcd/reviewdiscussion_about_tokyo_ghoul/)

This was in my "slightly-past-early" stages of anime reviewing. I was still in the newbie category, so I was perhaps a bit too lenient with it.

But I am steadfast! I stick by what I say in all my reviews, and never go against the ratings I give. :3

If it's worth anything to ya, just wait for my Tokyo Ghoul Root A review! ;)
>> ARTICLE
The only problem I have with your score is that it's in line with other shows that are blatantly mediocre/bad. Sure, Parasyte may have had a LOT of flaws but it delivered its themes very well. Meanwhile, other even worse anime are on the same rating as it. Examples would be HenNeko, Grisaia no Kajitsu, Sword Art Online, Mirai Nikki... you know. Blatantly bad stuff.


>> ARTICLE
> Examples would be HenNeko, Grisaia no Kajitsu, Sword Art Online, Mirai Nikki... you know. Blatantly bad stuff.

True!

Sadly, three of those four are anime that I *don't* have a constructed review for. So those scores are shows that have a rating of "this is what I would give it were I to use my reviewing format" without *actually* reviewing them. Grisaia is (in this context) the exception; [I have a review for that one. :3](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2r0obp/reviewdiscussion_about_grisaia_no_kajitsu/)

Can those other three be lowered at some point? Definitely; if I don't have a review for it, it's able to be changed. Otherwise, if it has a review, that's the score it gets -- a rule I have in place to keep my scores consistent with my thinking.

In short, I *do* find Parasyte to be as mediocre/bad as those other listed shows.

Hopefully that clears up my end a little bit! :3

5/10 is pretty low...then again after your reviews it really reminds me of the faults in certain shows. 

Murano was AWFUL, Migi wins best hand, Shinichi is vague and yeh...

It got really shaky towards the middle and the finale was really meh, of all things happening its the random ass cuffs guy whos the final villain...

I had it at 9/10 but i've took it down to an 8. Although it had a few flaws I still enjoyed it. Also to note MAL have this at 8.78!!

Why should we even consider the anime community's scores here? This is Banjo's review, and thus it is affected primarily by Banjo's own opinions and biases. Not to mention that everyone's own score distributions are very subjective. We should be looking a Banjo's list and comparing our own tastes to see how much this 5 is really worth.

Banjo's average score is 6.3. A score of 5 would be somewhere between the 69th and 82nd percentile. Parasyte being a 5 means Banjo has put this show below titles like The Tatami Galaxy, Angel Beats, Another, Oregairu, and Deen/Stay Night (all sixes). It is also more or less on par with shows like SAO, Twintails, Mirai Nikki, and Kyoukai no Kanata (other 5s).

Use this information how you will.
>> ARTICLE
I agree completely. I looked at the final score and knowing Banjo went "so it is pretty average" and I was satisfied (in fact Parasyte is a about the same distance below my average score).

I think it's because people have an expectancy that others will view scores similarly to themselves. To the reviewer, this score could be just "pretty below average" while others see it as "ranks among the worst shows ever", and end up thinking that is what the reviewer thinks about the show. Not too hard to see why people can get worked up over that.

Awesome review! Kinda sad to see your comments getting downvoted, though, you don't seem to be doing anything bad aside from making an off-beat joke here and there. 

Anyways, I agree with most of your review. I think the story and characters were lacklustre, and there was too much focus on blood and gore fights. The animation was okay, but I feel it could have benefitted from some more solid and consistent line work, especially with the realistic art style they were going for here. 

As an adaptation, it's pretty great. As a standalone story, it's just kinda okay. I didn't hate it as much as "Eureka Seven AO" or "Another", but it wasn't a standout show for either of the seasons it aired in.

> The animation was okay, but I feel it could have benefitted from some more solid and consistent line work, especially with the realistic art style they were going for here.

This is one of the harder aspects of the review I have to make. Having to generalize it, making exceptions, understanding when certain cuts/movements/actions are good or bad; this is probably one area that I don't always get right. At least with this one, though, I found Parasyte's animation to be quite good. Or at the minimum, better than what is normally given.

> As an adaptation, it's pretty great. As a standalone story, it's just kinda okay.

>> ARTICLE
Hello Banjo, not sure if you read the responses on your older threads but I did finish Parasyte and didn't know you actually made a review on it so I'll just leave a comment. Anyway, this review actually seemed rather harsh from you but I do agree with your points. The beginning episodes were pretty good and exciting, right up until the end of the Mom arc, where it started to get messy.

In regards to the plausibility, nothing really bothered me except for the fight scenes. Particularly the ones involving Gotou, things did feel too convenient for Shinichi when he was fighting him. 

For Murano, I wouldn't call her one of the worst characters in the medium but she pretty much served as a plot device and an extension of Shinichi's character so yeah, not particularly great either.

I really couldn't care too much about the themes of the show so when I heard one of the characters spout out a speech about 'saving the environment' I kinda facepalmed a little. In the end, I did give it a point higher than you since I did somewhat enjoy what it had to offer.

> Hello Banjo, not sure if you read the responses on your older threads...

> The beginning episodes were pretty good and exciting, right up until the end of the Mom arc, where it started to get messy.

Yea, I wish that it would have handled the transition a bit better; it just seemed to lose any semblance of direction after Shinichi's character became "perfect," despite his unemotional status that he had obtained.

> Particularly the ones involving Gotou, things did feel too convenient for Shinichi when he was fighting him.

It really didn't make much sense given the context. We've established that Gotou is incredibly fast and powerful, so how could Shinichi *really* get that close to hurt him? I guess we can excuse it slightly -- he did have his coat's arm chopped off, meaning he would have lost his actual arm should it have been there -- but it's still difficult to accept him beating this literal monster of a person.

> ...I wouldn't call her one of the worst characters in the medium...

She will forever remain a blemish on that show to me, of the highest degree. :3

> ...so when I heard one of the characters spout out a speech about 'saving the environment' I kinda facepalmed a little.

Right? A lot of that felt forced or out of nowhere; that the show was trying its best to have some kind of grounded connection to reality when it previously had none. Part of the problem is the parasytes: we don't really learn too much about them, meaning there isn't much to go off of besides "they're evil." So anything related to them comes off as being out of place.

Thanks for the nice comment, tanq! Always enjoy talking with you. :)
>> ARTICLE
Great review banjo, the only part I disagreed with was your 'enjoyment' section, which is more of a personal taste thing than anything else. One of the strengths of the show, to me, was it's ability to elicit an emotional response beyond apathy despite me being well aware of its deteriorating writing. An example of what I'm talking about is that despite losing interest in the story for the most part after Tamura Reiko's death, I found myself of the edge of my seat during some sections of the police raid and Shinichi's fight with Goutou, though they made for a pretty poor conclusion overall.

I felt like the author was very good at writing good *scenes* that create a lot of tension, although not necessarily creating a cohesive plot or developed characters to tie those scenes together into a complete narrative. I also think Madhouse did a fantastic job at adapting the source material to further emphasize this. When people complain about the adaptation I think they get too hung up on the dubstep soundtrack and don't notice the amazing scene direction that went into the show. There's too many of them to link, but if you've seen the manga panel/ anime scene comparison gifs, they exemplify how much of a difference small details can make in creating a more impactful scene. Parasyte was  Kenichi Shimizu's first major directing project, so if nothing less, it's made me want to keep an eye out on anything he works on in the future.

> One of the strengths of the show, to me, was it's ability to elicit an emotional response beyond apathy despite me being well aware of its deteriorating writing, mediocre side characters and plot conveniences.

Yea, I was quite jaded while watching this one. Didn't hate what I was seeing but not particularly liking it, either. I think it maybe had to do with its inability to make the battles seem like actual contests (not counting Shinichi's involvement).

> I felt like the author was very good at writing good scenes that create a lot of tension, although not necessarily creating a cohesive plot or developed characters to tie those scenes together into a complete narrative.

That's a great way to put it as well, alongside those examples you give. And that seems to be a good consensus that others are reaching; that the *individual* portions seemed to be well-off, but the *combination* of them all couldn't stay linked together.

Thank you for the insightful comment, and I hope to see you in the next one! :)

This was a good review. Critical, but not unwarranted. It does sting a bit because I really enjoyed Parasyte to the end - but I felt, as I was watching it, that my enjoyment was rooted more in the earlier episodes than anything that was going on on-screen in the last 7ish episodes. Something I really dislike in most shows are characters that are there to be an ideal or principle; Murano is an example of 'humanity' that I really got annoyed with as the show went on. She had a lot of potential, too, and it's a shame the author made her into a board to bounce Shinichi's changes off of.

That said, the last arc has one really nice surprise that I honestly wasn't expecting. The politician, I think his name was Hirokawa, turning out to be human. It really intrigued me, but I was disappointed that they didn't follow that thread(or build onto that character) into a *where did the parasites come from* portion. Because we still get absolutely no closure about what the parasites really are.

Anyways, thanks for your thoughts!
>> ARTICLE
> ...that my enjoyment was rooted more in the earlier episodes than anything that was going on on-screen in the last 7ish episodes.

You know, whether or not that is a negative is hard to say. For the enjoyment you had *up* that point still means something. I guess if you feel that the ending killed anything that was previously given, then you would indeed have to ignore it.

> Something I really dislike in most shows are characters that are there to be an ideal or principle

That's actually something I like: if the character serves some purpose, theme, or idea. To me, Murano felt like a doll who's batteries were fried enough to put her on repeat. I don't even know if she had any potential; you probably could have replaced her with any of her two girl friends, and the scenarios would have been exactly the same.

> It really intrigued me, but I was disappointed that they didn't follow that thread(or build onto that character) into a where did the parasites come from portion.

Exactly! That was a nice part, because it tricked me, too. That the dude that I thought was a parasite turned out to be human. But as you say, they fail to do anything with it, which is really a shame.

This is a weird situation. Reading your review it seems that you *get* the show. You have a pretty good thematic break down of the work both from a plot and a character based perspective. I agree that Murano and Shinichi are pretty weak characters and I agree that there are a lot of plot contrivances in the latter half, the fight against Gotou being especially disappointing in that regard. I disagree that the notion of the parasytes integrating with human society was contrived, because the parasytes are driven by a pragmatic will to survive and the defeat of so many parasytes by the police sets a clear precedent. I feel that you are undermining Migi's character progression, he starts out entirely selfish and gradually becomes more and more cooperative and even self-sacrificial towards Shinichi as the show progresses. Despite those remaining weaknesses, all in all I thought the show **did** do a good job of delivering its themes, however that might only be because I got more emotionally attached to the show. I personally thought the thematic back and forth did help make the themes more resounding, and admittedly I think the breadth of their investigation might well be more important then their depth.

I also have a hard time taking your ratings seriously when you gave Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren a 10.

Hey, Battle.

> Reading your review it seems that you get the show. You have a pretty good thematic break down of the work both from a plot and a character based perspective.

Thanks! I try my best with every anime to be as insightful and interpretive as I can possibly be. So it makes me glad to know that my arguments here didn't go unnoticed! :)

> I feel that you are undermining Migi's character progression, he starts out entirely selfish and gradually becomes more and more cooperative and even self-sacrificial towards Shinichi as the show progresses.

That's a fair statement. Especially when you consider that the initial action he took against him was to attack his brain!

But to an extent, Migi still only does the things he does to serve him. His offhand comment about "who cares what the planet feels; it doesn't have emotions" (or something similar) demonstrates his still present lack of empathy towards the people around him, even right up until the end. There *may* be a case that him "giving up" his life to allow Shinichi to live with his own arm for once -- in order to finally be back to normal -- is a kind gesture. But ultimately it is still somewhat selfish: part of why he does it is to "gain more intelligence" by processing all of the information he had gained while with Gotou.

I find that Migi doesn't develop as a character, but his *relationship* with Shinichi, however minimally, does morph. But still, not by much! :3

> I personally thought the thematic back and forth did help make the themes more resounding...

Juggling too many ideas/messages/motifs/themes/what-not at once makes it all more cloudy. Not every show has to do it that way (perhaps obviously), but in an anime like this, where there are so many unanswered questions already, it doesn't make sense to introduce *even more* thoughts.

Not expanding on *any* of them, though, is its downfall, probably more so than just "setting and forgetting."

> I also have a hard time taking your ratings seriously when you gave Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Ren a 10.

Ha! Chu2Koi/Ren are a *little* different; they are my "11/10" show, that one anime that I love more than anything else, irrespective of any flaws it may have. In other words, those two are only based on enjoyment alone. :3

Strong thematics, mediocre and underwhelming execution... yeah, sounds about right. I like my heavy grounded shows, but this one did meander too much for what it was attempting, at least I could appreciate the more abstract themes that pose philosophical questions, even if it's not discussed as I'd like it would have.

I didn't particularly care about the characters either, the adults were the most interesting and I wanted the political aspects to be ramped up instead of having everything happen around Shinichi, hence the police arc along with Reiko were the most enjoyable to me. Alas, still bogged down by the show's failures. At least it was easy to watch even in its slowest moments.

But if anything, this series brought forward a good discussion ground for you :P

Hey, Crit.

> ...at least I could appreciate the more abstract themes that pose philosophical questions, even if it's not discussed as I'd like it would have.

Yea, something like Juunketsu did this a bit better. I'm not sure if Parasyte even *could* do much more with the ideas it was throwing around. It wanted fights, blood, and "Migi!!!" in every episode, leaving little time to actually dive into any of the questions that it posed for everyone.

> ...hence the police arc along with Reiko were the most enjoyable to me

I wasn't too thrilled by the police arc -- seemed like more violence just to have it, with yet another "theme" chucked at us for the sake of having something to think about. Reiko, on the other hand, was handled nicely, and something that they really should have capitalized on. But like most of everything within, they didn't. :(

Well for one the fights were not boring for me. I found it intriguing that the main character could not even fight his own enemies and had to relay on a stranger that could kill him at any moment ( until the hybrid episode). Another thing was the story did not contain a lot of tropes. 
    The story itself was not about shinchi trying to survive but that he had to work with Migi to mature himself to finally grow up. Migi and the conflict was more of a catalyst. Most people didn't like the second half. I loved it even more. Shinchi became more vulnerable when Migi was not around to be a radar for him. Running for his life from goto. 
       Murano was pretty annoying at first but I eventually realized any boyfriend or girlfriend that actually gave a fuck and didn't know what was going on would do the same thing. I think the reason they avoided the baby is probably for spin off purposes or an ova. Otherwise I am very satisfied with this series.  A one season series usually doesnt leave me like that.

> I'm no anime connoisseur... I guess I just like shitty animes lol. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the show.

I never like to call anything "shitty." I'll say whether an anime is good or bad, and back it up with my review/analysis here. I do this with *all* anime I watch for this reason. If someone wonders why I like an anime, I can say "Here is why!" and show them the respective review.

In other words, you are perfectly welcome to enjoy the anime and rate it how you see fit. The only caveat to that is explaining somewhat eloquently *why*. Something more than just "it was fun" would be awesome.

If you say "I found Parasyte's uniqueness, Shinichi's character, and the overall OST to be well-done, therefore it gets a 7/10," that's really cool to hear! Because now I know *why* it's the case. And it doesn't matter the score: for any show, if it's a 1/10, 10/10, or anything in between, if you can correctly (logically/within reason) *justify* your interpretation of it, then I have no qualms.

In short, don't think of yourself, me, or anyone else as a "connoisseur" of anime. We all rate things too highly or too low at times. Value the perspectives of *everyone* within the medium, and your time spent enjoying anime will be that much more worthwhile. :)

Great review and analysis. I think alot of your problems with it can be summed up with the anime not having an overarcing plot, which was a concern of mine as I was finishing it up. The show had a lot interesting moments such as the parasyte classmate and the potential mayor also being a parasyte. There was so many interesting ideas and plot points the show had but none of them were fullfilled or just plain left behind. By the end of show it just seems like everything stopped without a proper ending. Instead of having an explanation of where the parasite's came from or how the parasite organisms are forming a large organization to combat humanities' ideals it just ends. The conclusion we are given is that the parasites just slowly stop feeding on humans? I will admit it was an entertaining ride but left a lot to be had and felt somewhat unfullfilling in the end.

Hey, Remington.

Thank you very much! It makes me happy to know that people are really liking my review here. I spent quite a bit of time on it to make absolutely sure I had everything down that I wanted. :3

> I think alot of your problems with it can be summed up with the anime not having an overarcing plot

You know what, I think that's it. There really wasn't, was there? It was just "Shinichi, now deal with parasite X."

> I will admit it was an entertaining ride but left a lot to be had and felt somewhat unfullfilling in the end.

Yep, and I didn't even touch on so many of those unanswered questions. Why did the police chief stop going after Shinichi? How Japan seemed to be the only ones affected? What the heck does Migi "going to sleep" even help him do besides get some beauty rest?

Ah well. Easy come, easy go!

Thanks for the nice comment! :)
>> ARTICLE
I do actually think there was an overarching plot, although it was unclear and obfuscated by everything going on. Aka it was poorly dealt with.
It was about Shinichi reaching his conclusion/coming to terms with humanity's selfishness and hypocrisy. The stuff we tend to look away from and rather not think about. It presents all these aspects of humanity that are not very pleasant, and shows how frustrating it can be to tackle them or try to justify them. That's why Shinichi ends up with his conclusion, being "isn't it okay?". We are how we are, and that's fine. This was kind of thrown in together with all the preaching at the end, but was basically the part that saved it for me. Instead of just presenting the "Humans are the real monsters!" thing that we have seen so many time, it actually took a step back and give it's opinion on it. Still a shitty ending, but that part was nice.
>> ARTICLE
niea! I'm glad to see you here. I hope you are doing well on your end.

Yea...Like you say, it's poorly handled because it kind of is just thrown at us in a slipshod manner right at the end. :/

> ...it actually took a step back and give it's opinion on it.

Again, yea, interesting message, and one that is indeed atypical for something like anime. But that execution is just not there, at makes it come off as lame as opposed to worthwhile.

> Still a shitty ending, but that part was nice.

Sounds like me after the initial arc. :P

I really didn't like it. I'm not going to be as intricate as you were with your review, but it was just really... bad. My short review below has spoilers, so if you're looking for just an opinion quickly, I would say not to watch it.

The thing that got me was the characters and the story. The animation was *alright,* nothing spectacular. I think Migi was the best character in the show. I don't get people saying that Shinichi was such a developed character because.. well... he wasn't, really. Just getting this weird power and changing emotionally because of it doesn't = development 100% of the time. Reiko's story seemed pointless to me. I don't see why she had to die, she could have easily saved the baby and survived herself. But instead, she leaves the baby alone? Her character was better than everyone else, except maybe Migi, in my opinion. I agree that Murano is awful, btw.

The story could have been SO MUCH MORE! I know this was an *adaptation*, not an original thing. I'm not blaming Madhouse for this, since it's an adaptation. Even if they could have changed stuff for the better. But it seemed too low-scale. I mean, the worst thing to happen in the show was a serial murder case. But what if a Parasite had gained the body of someone more important, like a political leader? I'm not sure how Japan's political system works, but basically their 'president.' A lot more stuff could have happened, and  I think that could have been so much better. Imagine the stuff they could do with a concept like Parasites. Another thing is, what **are** Parasites? Where did they come from? Are they aliens? Human creations? If they were aliens, why did they come to earth? If they were made by humans, why did that human make these creatures? Who did it? etc. 

 I think I'm bitter because this show just had a great idea and ran with it... in the wrong direction. I gave it a 3/10.

Eh. You can't really fault the story for not following a plot that would essentially make it a different show. Every show could have gone in a different direction than it did. You can only really judge it on what the show was (which you did in the previous paragraph, to be fair), not what it wasn't.

I did not. I cried during YLiA, After Story, AnoHana, even parts of Chihayafuru (happy tears!), but not with Reiko. If anything, I was sad they murdered the best character the show had to offer. :P

> Shinichi and Murano ruined it.

"Are you really Shinichi?!"

"I'm crying."

........................................

Murano *literally* ruined everything in the show. She was cumbersome to Shinichi, the entire anime, and the audience as a whole. They really should have just excluded her from the story. :3
>> ARTICLE

> Do you think the show could've gone in a better direction if Murano was killed over...

You know, maybe. Have Shinichi disclose his condition to a closer person, to someone who *actually* seems to want to be with him as opposed to asking him the same, tired question 100 times over. Then maybe kill [Parasyte Spoilers](/s "Kana") at a later date to have more of an emotional impact/attachment to her, other than, "Oh, creepy stalker girl has died." :3

Hmm, I don't think it's really fair to say that she literally ruined everything in the show. I mean, she might have brought it down, but to say she ruined everything, seems like an exaggeration.

Sorry, it is a bit of a hyperbole. :3

Ha, that's very kind of you to say! And should that be true, I'm honored to have such a title. :)

As for the downvoting, /u/WrathofTesla describes it well. It's more than likely backlash from Parasyte's huge following/praise that is pushing down my interpretation or my other comments. Which is perfectly fine. I'm not in this for the upvotes or the downvotes; I'm in it to have a really awesome time discussing anime with everyone here in the community.

And, of course, to talk about Chu2Koi whenever I can! ;)

Oh I see. Yeah, the backlash makes sense although I didn't think it would be that prevalent considering the circlejerk people have about how the rating system sucks since everyone gives high scores.

You can chalk this up as your most controversial review yet!

There are a few reasons.

Parasyte is a fairly popular show. This review(more like the final score) is pretty scathing.

I am sure Banjo is fully aware that the anime community doesn't use the full 1-10 scale but Banjo using the full scale creates a pretty nasty collision. I personally, disagree with the score but have the grace not to downvote just because the final action disagrees with my own.

It shows that not even popularity and reasoning can save you from the anonymous masses.

How was her death sad? They suddenly show her acting as a human in the last couple minutes of her life and we're supposed to empathize with her?
>> ARTICLE
It also felt totally unnecessary, she could have just escaped easily but decided to die for no real reason. I found that episode to be by far the worst of the series and one of the worst of any show I've seen recently.

It needed her to die for the show to feel more mature.

> Suddenly

She started acting like a human pretty early on, the fact that she even started wondering about her place in the universe is an already human trait. I enjoyed her character development and when I character that I grew attached to dies, that makes me sad.

Hallo hallo banjo!

Another "head-nodder" for me (as in I read your review and was nodding my head in agreement)

For me, where it seemed to go stale was the rut that they had worked themselves into by the middle section. By that point, they had established the world, but not any underlying motivation for shinichi and just left him to flounder, fighting individual battles against parasytes without any overlying goal.

I agree with what you said about it trying to be intelligent. While it was worked in rather subtly at the beginning, at the end, it became more blatent, but even less fleshed out. The biggest example of this was having the (minister?) exclaim that the parasytes are there to trim the human population, yet is shot, and there the scenes ends without any further rumination. It comes up again, but always as a one-liner. 

Also migi's entire development at the end really annoyed me in that he suddenly becomes spiritual and looks "within himself". I can understand his slow attainment of humanity, and his self-sacrifice for shinichi, but the very last development was rather odd.

Speaking of that, did anybody else find it odd that he was able to pursue multiple threads of thought at the same time, yet required sleep to be able to process all of the information? If anything, wasn't the information that he gained in goutou's body rather insignificant because it was just the memories of the parasytes that he was composed of? (which I don't think would be too revalatory?)

Wow this turned out to be longer than I expected.
>> ARTICLE
Hallo back at you, higi. :)

> Another "head-nodder" for me (as in I read your review and was nodding my head in agreement)

Ha, I'm glad that my writing was able to give your brain some satisfaction. :3

> ...fighting individual battles against parasytes without any overlying goal.

That's something that someone else pointed out as well, and I agree. That is another problem it had; too many individual moments and not enough grouped ones.

> ...and there the scenes ends without any further rumination. It comes up again, but always as a one-liner.

Oh yea, that is an easy example of the lameness that the anime was trying to throw out. I mean, over population, special understanding, and investigating humanity's nature are great ideas *on their own*, but trying to incorporate them all at once is just a mess.

> ...and looks "within himself"

This was really just done to appease everyone; so that the audience knows "Shinichi is fully human now, just a parasite when he needs to be." It makes his ending more "happy" than having Migi be around for the rest of his life. :3

> (which I don't think would be too revalatory?)

I thought that was fine, just another contrivance though. There is no explanation for Goutou's existence or how such a multi-parasite works, so hearing that Migi gained "super intelligence" from it all comes out of nowhere. :(

> Wow this turned out to be longer than I expected.

That's good! It was a nice comment, and thank you for posting it, higi. :)

Yea, I'm actually a sucker for metal music, so I can understand completely.

I can't say I hate monologue (just look at my YLiA review :P) but yes, it just began spouting way too many "smart" ideas in an attempt to make the situation more humanely relevant when it, in fact, was just a lot of gore without much substance.
>> ARTICLE
Hm yeah i have to agree with you here.  
The premise was great, but it didn't really get explored, both in plot as well as in themes.  
The romance was shallow, the fighting was mediocre and the pacing was kinda off towards the end.  
Still i think it was "mature" and different enough to be a bit above average.  
6/10 for me  
  
edit: i am pretty new to anime, while reading your review i thought, "hey this guy seems to have the same thoughts and values aspects of a story similarly".  
So would you give me 5 great shows to watch? The newer they are the better (i know about the classics i think)  
Would be great!

>> ARTICLE
Hey, Viper (GoT hype this April! :3)

> Your points

Those are valid. I didn't talk about the pacing myself; I normally only do if it is extremely annoying (way too slow or way too fast). The maturity of the show does help it a bit, for sure. Definitely a step away from all the "moe" and harems we get. :P

> i am pretty new to anime

I don't write anything down and always go off gut feeling for my scoring system so essays like this are extremely helpful in getting 6 months of thoughts in order and reassuring my opinion has a solid foundation (until I forget again).

I also just want to mention I personally thought a couple standout tracks on the OST were a little overused. Every consecutive time I heard Next to You (piano track) and HYPNOTIK (DnB track) they felt a little less special. Then again the scenes they were attached to *were* less special.

Hey Banjo. I greatly enjoyed your review and completely agree with your thoughts on Murano being one of the worst female characters to grace this medium.

It's true that Migi, Shinichi, Reiko and Murano were really the only true characters worth discussing in the show, however, I was wondering if you could go into more specifics on your thoughts on Kana.  You said that you enjoyed her arc quite a bit.

I also enjoyed the Kana arc, and thought she was a vastly superior character to Murano, in just about every way. Her ability to sense parasytes made her much more interesting than Murano.  It also made her more capable of being understanding of Shinichi.  She was in a position to find out more about what he was going through, while Murano could only muster up the words "are you really Shinichi?" over and over again.  

Later on we found out that the serial killer could detect monsters by looking them in the eyes, and seeing their lack of humanity. However, this is not the same as Kana's gift which was more like sonar.  I feel like the only logical explanation would be that she had some parasyte in her blood stream. It would've been interesting if it turned out a weak parasyte just barely latched on to her in her sleep, but not enough to take over her entire brain, but, like Migi's cerebral half, invades her dreams, and helps guide her towards others of her kind.  Maybe Migi could have communicated with the parasyte inside Kana, and developed some sort of relationship.  There's just SO much more potential in the Shinichi-Kana relationship, that I couldn't believe they killed her off. Not to mention she was voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro...maybe the only seiyuu in the industry who I enjoy more than Kana Hanazawa, haha.

What do you think about the possibility of Murano dying in Kana's place, and Kana being the love interest over the course of the show.  People seem to hate on her because she had an obsessive relationship with Shinichi, but it's not like that's a trope in anime that can't be successful.

Anyway, fantastic review, and I actually lowered my Parasyte score from a 7 to 6 seeing everything laid out before me. Thanks!

Nicely written review! I find it hard to disagree with anything you've said \^^

I'm bad at this, and that's something I need to practice. That is, getting more in-depth or knowledgeable about the directors, series composition maker, animation supervisor, etc. I know the big names (Ikuhara, Yuuasa) but beyond that, I'm ignorant. :(

That's a solid point; it destroyed the build-up that was created from the previous episode. Those little things really start to add up in the end. :3

I'm actually relatively upset with this review. You're killin me, Banjo.

When you mention important characters, you stick to Shinichi, Migi, Murano, and Tamura. You leave out Gotou, Hirokawa (the Mayor), Kuramori (the PI), Kazuyuki (Shinichi's father), Mitsuyo (the elderly woman that takes Shinichi in), and, perhaps most important of all, Uragami. None of these are major characters, but they are all important. Instead, you drop them to focus on your hate of Murano who is not a bad character at all. Underdeveloped, yes, but not a bad character.

I plan on writing a review of my own, so there's not much point to putting everything out here, but suffice it to say I consider it an affront to this story to leave out the side cast, that all serve to reinforce the standing of the thematic core of the story and the main characters as well. You're completely missing the context of the show when you discuss the characters like that. You're dragging them out on their own, and in that situation of course their actions look stupid. But they make sense in context, and you're leaving that out entirely.

Furthermore, I don't consider the narrative "weak" in the slightest, and once again, in the context of the main thematic points that the show makes, I actually consider it fairly strong.

---

With that said, I do agree on the points you make about the animation, and would actually treat the show more harshly there (due mostly to the CG, which was at best noticeable and at worst jarring). I also agree on the sound front, and while I appreciate the experimental nature of the songs, they're hit-or-miss for me, though more hit than miss.

---

As one final point, I want to ask you if you could clarify what you mean by "Darwinian evolution" as you mentioned it in the story section. I'm a bit confused by what you mean and what exactly you picked up on to come to that conclusion.

Hayden! Hope you are doing well. :)

> I'm actually relatively upset with this review. You're killin me, Banjo.

I seem to have made *many* people upset, so you are not alone. ;)

> Instead, you drop them to focus on your hate of Murano who is not a bad character at all. Underdeveloped, yes, but not a bad character.

You bring up a valid point. I'm not going to argue that I pushed the rest of the characters to the side.

One reason for doing this is review length; at about 2500 words, this is one of my longest pieces, if not my longest review, I've written to date. I usually shoot for 1800-2000, but I had more to say, and subsequently this is where it ended up.

The second reason is that I found their *overall* importance to the story to be lacking. I chose those four -- Murano, Migi, Shinichi, and Reiko -- because I felt they held the most "relevance" throughout the entire run of the show. My directed hate at Murano is precisely *because* she was such a terrible character. She'd have been better had she never said a word, or never existed. Sure, she's a side member, but like I say in my review, I cannot excuse the ratio of awful-character-to-involvement she has attributed to her. Therefore, I included her within my analysis as a major negative.

Nonetheless, I technically *do* make mention of some of the other side characters:

"And this can be applied to many of the other characters still -- Goutou demonstrates anger, Uragami symbolizes depravity, etc. -- to give the nicely executed message: humanity isn't just some simple creature."

Again, due to length and redundancy constraints, I didn't include every single cast member within my argument about the thematic connection that they conveyed, and instead focused on the more important "main" ones.

> But they make sense in context, and you're leaving that out entirely.

Maybe that is a mistake on my part, and something that I should have focused on more. That is, looking at this show as more of a character-driven one as opposed to a balanced offering of story and characters.

I can understand your qualms with the way I approached, but I did so in this way because I found the side cast just wasn't "important" enough to consider talking about at length.

Regardless, I look forward to reading your review on the anime! I want to see you have to say about it, because now you have me thoroughly intrigued. :3

> (due mostly to the CG, which was at best noticeable and at worst jarring)

Gahh! I totally forgot about this. Probably because they started using it less and less. :P

But yea, the CG was no good, I agree with that.

> As one final point, I want to ask you if you could clarify what you mean by "Darwinian evolution" as you mentioned it in the story section.

Ha, that was me having fun with my wording. Essentially, the ending of the anime attributes the parasites' "disappearance" as being them adapting flawlessly with the rest of society. Darwin would be completely baffled that a species were capable of creating a completely "new" breed of creature over the course of one year as opposed to the millions of years it normally takes! :P

Very nice comment, and thanks for stopping by, Hayden. I look forward to seeing what you have to say! :)

I do want to point out that while I am attacking your stance, I'm not attacking you or your opinions, and I love seeing reviews on this sub.

I'm taking my time with this review because I did enjoy the show so much, so expect at least a bit of a wait before it shows up. I plan on seriously looking at it and taking it apart in the context of the themes it presents. I feel that I should do it that way because I did like it so much, instead of the other way around. Unfortunately that means not a whole lot of backing for the criticisms I'm bringing up now, but I do have some rebuttals brewing.

>Ha, that was me having fun with my wording. Essentially, the ending of the anime attributes the parasites' "disappearance" as being them adapting flawlessly with the rest of society. Darwin would be completely baffled that a species were capable of creating a completely "new" breed of creature over the course of one year as opposed to the millions of years it normally takes!

I'm going to kick in my bio major skills and say that I actually do take issue with this on a technical level. Darwinian evolution specifically refers to a series of small changes in a population through random selection for traits that enhance survivability in said population. What the parasytes did was not Darwinian evolution, but adaptation to the world around them in response to a threat - that being, that they would be hunted down if they didn't adapt. What the parasytes did was consciously change their ways so as to avoid endangering themselves. It wasn't really evolution.

I think that's actually a really nice way of doing it. I'm undertaking something similar with Yuri Kuma Arashi myself -- taking my time, writing a lot more on it, etc. -- since I've been greatly affected by that one.

> I'm going to kick in my bio major skills...

Dammit! I was afraid you were going to say that. :P

Alright, on a technicality, yes, my wording there is incorrect. I'll concede that. While the parasites can't procreate (as far as we know), my sentence there was just a more "layman's" description of the situation that I was attempting to describe. :3

That's great to hear about your agreement. I spent a lot of time with this one (my word count went *really* high, a mini mistake on my part), but I feel I captured the essence of where Parasyte went really, really wrong.

> Personally I found it hard to give it a score overall.

That happens to me, too. There are times when I'm real close between certain barriers, and I'll be agonizing over it. "Do I go harsh and drop it lower or be kind and bump it up?"

That is usually a gut feeling. :3

I desperately need to fix up my MAL ratings. It doesn't compare to my 9's and it wasn't bad enough to be put with my 7's but I can't help but feel 8 is a little too high.

Good review though. Found it just as I had to get off the train so I skimmed a little.

>5/10

Is it wrong to be unreasonably happy about this score? I'm so tired of the hype anime 'fulfilling' their promise as if the final score were pre-ordained from the beginning.  

Parasyte had a great premise and did jack shit with it which by the standards of many critics (wannabe and otherwise) nets it a "solid 7". It's nice to see that you, as /r/anime's most visible reviewer, avoided the trap of being kind and chose to be honest instead.  
>> ARTICLE

> Is it wrong to be unreasonably happy about this score?

Ha, well *I* won't stop you from agreeing with my final analysis of what the show had to offer. :)

But looking at it seriously, no, it's perfectly acceptable. I know I do the same thing, it just depends on which show I'm watching or which anime is currently being talked about. :3

> It's nice to see that you, as (arguably) /r/anime's most visible reviewer, avoided the trap of being kind and chose to be honest instead.

Wow. That's very kind of you to say. Truly, I really appreciate you saying that. But I would be remiss if I don't say that this isn't just what I "feel" the anime deserves but what I *determined*, through careful deliberation of its parts, what it ultimately earns. For people will most likely argue that my YLiA goes against your statement -- that I "followed the hype."

But I don't. It's as you say; as a reviewer/analyzer/critic of the medium, I'm never going to shy away from what I have to say about an anime. I'll give you my true, honest interpretations, with as much thought, evidence, and dedication as I can muster.

Thanks again, 878. Your kindness will not be lost on me! :)
>> ARTICLE
>For people will most likely argue that my YLiA goes against your statement -- that I "followed the hype."


And to those people, a clarification of what I mean.

Buying a ticket for the hype train, having a ball on board, and getting off at the other end feeling like your money was well spent is fine. It's normal. It's completely understandable and a more than acceptable reason to (in this context) score an anime you loved highly.

Regarding Parasyte, my worry had been that for all the problems that people were bringing up in regards to the show because the hype at started so high people would be inclined to score the anime more kindly than it really deserved.

I mean, to put it as simply as possible, 5/10 is a shitty score in a lot of peoples eyes. When you then consider that you're giving a 5 to a show that spent it's entire run basking in the warm glow of 8.5+ score it's practically a deceleration of war to people who liked Parasyte.

Had you wrote a glowing review for Parasyte, explained why you felt that way and scored it accordingly I wouldn't have been upset or criticized you for it. So it's not like I only feel this way because we happen to agree this time round. I just really dig the fact that Parasyte's name is not garnering cache it hasn't earned.

That seems to be the case at the moment, vote-wise. :P

> So it's not like I only feel this way because we happen to agree this time round. I just really dig the fact that Parasyte's name is not garnering cache it hasn't earned.

Then we're completely on the same page.

I don't follow hype myself (minus Chu2Koi); I'm just looking to give as much insight as I can with the words I craft. And if it happens to go against the norm or not, then so be it.

As long as I am satisfied with the arguments and analysis I've done, then I'm not backing down, ever. :3

I have to roll my eyes at this, maybe those people believe it earned a 7, or rate differently, where "averagish" is a 7.

It's better to assume people give stuff the score they think it should have, rather than assume they have some ulterior motives, and everyone else is a special and brave snowflake.

If you didn't know already, a lot of people like to rate on a 5-10 scale.

That was part of what I was saying. And yes, I know.
>> ARTICLE
Err, I think you might have misread what I wrote. I'm saying that his review and score were in tandem, whereas what you'll often see in reviews are words that say one thing and a number that says something else. I'm sure there are plenty of people who rate Parasyte higher than Banjo did and I'm not implying that these people are wrong to do so, only that they would be if doing so meant ignoring the issues they had with the show. 
>> ARTICLE
You missed half of what I said.

Some people rate differently, to some people, what he said would go along with a 7/10 show, as "average", and some would consider it as "underwhelming" and give it 3/10.

You say they give it a score they do not believe in. I'm saying they give the score they believe in, but to them 7/10 means something else than it does for Banjo.
>> ARTICLE
Um, where am I not agreeing with that?

Is it that you don't agree with me that there exist reviewers who will say one thing but score differently for the sake avoiding controversy? Because they do. Shit, I used to know people like that. More to the point, I used to know people who weren't like that but felt a compulsion to at least think that way because audiences are, well to be frank, kind of stupid.  

>> ARTICLE
>  It's nice to see that you, as /r/anime's most visible reviewer, avoided the trap of being kind and chose to be honest instead.

Please. Combined with the immediately preceding sentence, while one could wriggle to read your statement as saying what you're saying now, which I'm sure you believe (no irony), that's not what you said, but made the implication that had he given it 7/10 he'd be falling to the trap of "being kind rather than honest", while one could read an identical review with a 7/10 score, or a 3/10 score.

Your first sentence attacks the standards of those other critics as well, where they'd give it 7/10 because that's what their rating standards say.

I'm sorry, *but that's what you actually said*. The implication of the sentence I quoted following that one also impugns said critics' "ethical standards" (blech), because it's not their grading standards that are lacking, but that they chose "not to be honest."

Yes, I too know that many people will avoid rating scores, or avoid rating them in a matter that differs too much from public opinion due to the downvotes being strong (they often are), but you did exactly what I pointed in my first sentence, presenting Banjo as some special and brave snowflake, and everyone else who does something you disagree with as a dishonest coward. Of course I called you out on it. You should at least realize that's what you've been doing.
>> ARTICLE
>or rate differently, where "averagish" is a 7

I'm mostly like that, as I will not continue watch anything that I find to be a 5 or lower. I don't have that kind of time, lol. And I know what I want, so most of the time, I won't even start watching anything bad in my eyes. I actually even just continue things I'd rate a 6 if I have a reason, aka I want to know why people like/dislike it, be able to talk about it without people telling me I didn't finish it. That was the case for SAO and Nagi, though I would really have dropped the latter if I wasn't watching it with my boyfriend, I rated it a 5.

Things I rate a 7 are things I watch if I'm bored or if I have time, things I'd like to know the ending of but am not particularly invested in because of the issues they have. They have standards but still a lot of flaws and are overall enjoyable to casually watch.

I'm very conflicted right now, becuse at the start, I would have rated Parasite a 9, then it progressively went down to 8 and 7, but the very last episode makes me want to give it a 6 instead.
>> ARTICLE
Your 7s are my 6s.

As time continues, and my backlog grows while my time dwindles, even 6s are something I watch less. This season for example, all the shows I predicted to be 7 *at best*, and most likely to be 6s, I just passed on 'em, though I'd usually give them a chance. Backlog beckons, always.

After that, it's a secret! ;)
>> ARTICLE
This show had a lot of ups and downs, though I think it went from amazing at the start to good, with a lot of problems 

My main gripe with the show was that a lot of times, the characters actions simply did not make sense.  Other than that, it also did this thing where they introduced characters and then just left them alone ie Shinichi's dad, girl who almost killed the entire school, girl who had a crush on Shinichi and talked to Murano sometimes,cop guy, other cop guy, and the baby.  It also had some very awkward transitions like the sex scene and Shinichi leaving school for a month.   The last episode was very disappointing for me, probably because it wasn't really meant to be a conclusion, left me feeling very unsatisfied.  All of this in addition to what you said about the characters.

Despite all this, I still found myself waiting in anticipation of the next episode more than any other series of the season.  The anime had a few good philosophical points, even if they weren't fully developed.  I also really liked Migi, Shinichi and Reiko as characters.  Thank god we got a good mc this season, because the rest of them were shit(from what I was watching).  Migi's and Shinichi's relationship was very interesting to watch develop and it served as a nice juxtaposition of human empathy and pure survival logic and the beginning.  The series also avoided tropey things except for the first couple of episodes, which I always love to see.

Overall, I'd say it's more towards a 7 or 8 than a 5
>> ARTICLE
Hey, open! Good to see you back again.

> Other than that, it also did this thing where they introduced characters and then just left them alone ie...

True, and that's something that I kind of joked about at the end. It'll have these characters that are semi-relevant to the plot, then WHAM, they're gone. Even Joe/Mouth parasite man was all that "useful" in the grand scheme of things. :3

> The anime had a few good philosophical points, even if they weren't fully developed.

It really does, honestly. I just wish they would have done just that, actually take the time to stick with one and run with it, explore all of its sides. Not just, "over population is why we're here!" and then go back to lopping heads off of soldiers. :(

> Thank god we got a good mc this season, because the rest of them were shit

Ha, Shinichi was good, but don't count out Ginko, Miyamori, and Maria from Yuri Kuma, Shirobako, and Juunketsu, respectively! :)

> ...and it served as a nice juxtaposition of human empathy and pure survival logic and the beginning.

Nicely said!

Execution is very important to me when it comes to anime, and I just didn't see it with this one, so it gets the score I gave it. Regardless, you raise some good points that others should be reading.

Thanks again, open! :D
>> ARTICLE
> Ha, Shinichi was good, but don't count out Ginko, Miyamori, and Maria from Yuri Kuma, Shirobako, and Juunketsu, respectively! :)

I haven't seen the others(other than first season with Ginko), but I personally can't stand Maria.  She's just too childish, she doesn't listen to the people's ideas, she believes in naive ideas like "world peace", she is hopelessly childish when it comes to sex, that fucking running joke about Priapus pisses me off to no end(just give him a fucking dick), and she clearly has no regard for her own and her owl and dove's life as she continuously defies an entity that will kill her(I'm all for defying bad/corrupt authority, but do it in a way that you at least have a chance of surviving)

She says some cool things about the church, like her likeness to Mary and sometimes she is very wise, but it just seems out of place, because of how childish she is.

Other than that I like the show and the rest of the characters(other than the dove)

I REALLY don't like the tsundere/loli(mentally I see her as a child) archetype, so perhaps I'm biased



On another note, is Parasyte's manga still ongoing, because that would explain a lot of their problems.
>> ARTICLE
> (just give him a fucking dick)

Ha! True, it can be a little silly for its own good, especially when it is dealing with [Juunketsu no Maria Spoilers](/s "rape, religion, and rhetoric").

> ...because of how childish she is.

So what you're saying is, is that she literally had to "grow up" over the course of the anime? Interesting.... ;)

> I REALLY don't like the tsundere/loli(mentally I see her as a child) archetype, so perhaps I'm biased

A little bias, but that's all good. There are just some characters/types that you'll be attached to more than others. :)

> On another note, is Parasyte's manga still ongoing, because that would explain a lot of their problems.

From what I understand, nope! It ended in the '90s. :3
>> ARTICLE
Aside from the 2 main characters and Reiko, the show suffered from terrible characters. Everyone else just seemed so stupid and oblivious all the time. Shinichi and Murano had zero chemistry together, and the sex scene was so meaningless.

The show also could have benefited from some more elaboration on its lore/world building. We never really find out much about the parasites aside from how they interact with the environment. We also never get a clear explanation for why people like Uragami and Kana could sense them. Story aspects like that just felt lacking. 

5/10 is a pretty brutal score, though. The first several episodes were great, and the story did a good job of keeping a suspenseful tone throughout. I'd say a 7 is appropriate.

>> ARTICLE
> We also never get a clear explanation for why people like Uragami and Kana could sense them. Story aspects like that just felt lacking.

Ahh, good point! I didn't think of that. Yes, they kind of "just can." Ultimately, it is just one more plot contrivance to add on to the ever growing list. :P

> 5/10 is a pretty brutal score, though.

Perhaps, but from my own conclusions, numbering, and interpretations, that's what I arrived at. *Maybe* a little bit higher (6-ish), but I stick by what I give it! :3

It was an ok adaptation, but not the greatest. I still prefer the manga; the art style is more to my liking, and the anime totally censored itself with regards to the gore, probably to avoid those tacky shadow-censors that TV networks like to force.

With respect to adaptation, it suffered from the typical issue of being too faithful to the source material. What would take a reader a few seconds to read turns into dozens of minutes of "Are you really Shinichi"... they were already making changes to the story, they should have made more changes to compensate the pacing.
>> ARTICLE
Hello!

> ...and the anime totally censored itself with regards to the gore, probably to avoid those tacky shadow-censors that TV networks like to force.

It did have a strange form of censorship. It was "there but not there." Definitely not as terrible as Tokyo Ghoul or Terraformars, but it certainly would have been nice to show more of it (like in the very beginning when the husband chomps on the wife's head).

I'm so happy about this review! I mean, it's pretty clear the hype this show has, considering the brigade of downvotes against your posts... but what is the hype around?? I think this bit sooo adequately sums up my feelings about the show:

> the actual writing within the anime gravitates towards vagueness. Once again, barring any mention of the quite egregious and amazingly annoying "Are you really Shinichi?" spouted by Murano (even right up until the very end), the show tries extremely hard to be intelligent. It throws around many ideas about life and the way people live it, but never truly expounds upon them ... There might be a smart-sounding lecture or a few sentences of insight here and there, but it refuses to take what it says beyond a precursory glance. That is, it constantly flips back and forth between each of the subjects it raises in an attempt to be more resounding. Instead, the whole package comes off as too ostentatious.

The story was never thematically original and tried way too hard to 'intelligently' explore topics it never knew shit about in the first place.   The characters are weak and their motives and decisions don't make sense most of the time. 

I think episodes 8 and 9 of Death Parade (particularly 9) were more a poignant commentary on humanity than the entirety of Parasyte.

So yeah, my vote goes for my waifu, KyoAni, because I believe in quality over quantity and holy crap those shows were all so incredibly beautiful. Also, [if you don't vote for them...](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/751/343/985.png)

Madhouse for some of my favorites this year (eg. Death Parade).

and 

JCStaff for making me not give up entirely on ecchi (and making one of my favorite comedies Shimoneta)
>> ARTICLE
For me, it's Bones easy. Kekkai is one of my favorite shows of all time now, and Noragami and Akagami were both among my favourites of there respective seasons. Hell, I really love Concrete Revolutio too.

Madhouse would be a close second, for Death Parade, OPM and Ore Monogatari, but Bones just takes it.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! Akagami, Concrete Revolutio, and Noragami were all amazing, and while I haven't seen the other two, having 3/5 shows they made this year be solid 9s or 10s is pretty good in my book
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree. Other studios made like 1 good anime this year max, but these two made several quality shows so they both got my vote.
>> ARTICLE
Although I am a huge fan of ufotable and Kyoani, I feel like Madhouse wins this easily. One Punch Man is the only show listed in this thread that is both bolded and italicized (unless my eyes deceive me). Also having Parasyte, AND Death Parade AND Ore Monogatari!!, 2015 was crazy for Madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
I'd go with Madhouse. Death Parade was probably my favorite show of the year and Parasyte, OPM and Overlord were solid.

I love KyoAni and Euphonium, but Shirobako was so good, I have no idea who to vote for. Oh wait you can vote for more than 1!

Coppelion did not air in 2015.

Only K aired this past year, and it was a terrible, pretty mess of a show. So much animation reuse though. 
>> ARTICLE
Not very active this year but I'll draw a Wildcard for:

Studio TRIGGER, because I'm a filthy fanboy.

Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade was average plot wise but does pretty well for itself Animation and characters.

Ninja Slayer: Very controversial but for what it set out to do, it took it and soared. Brilliant stuff, beats out a lot of shows with an actual budget IMO.

They only assisted a little for Hackadolls but shared a lot of TRIGGER style jokes but this time in referential and industry depreciating humour, enjoyment of this is proportional to how many references you could get.

Okay I'll end my shilling/fanboying here.

>> ARTICLE
[Trigger](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=creator&creatorid=29313) - Hacka Doll: The Animation

Feel is like, the literal definition of wild card. They produce mediocre garbage consistently, then pull off Oregairu Zoku outta fucking nowhere (AOTY 2015 for me), and then they go back to... Bikini Warriors.

I'm drawing a Wildcard.

Silver Link

They have done a lot of shows, but some of them are of good quality, like Fate/Kaleid and Non Non Biyori.

Fate/Kaleid especially is beautiful. It integrates 3DCG better than ufotable's F/SN IMO. It might not have as much special effects as ufotable's F/SN, but it holds on it's own in art and animation.

Studio Lerche.

I'd have to put my vote behind Madhouse; every show they put out in the list are just so solid, and most of them have made my all-time favorite list. Bones is a close second, with Noragami Aragoto and Kekkai Sensen being the stand-out shows. MAPPA's definitely a studio to keep my eyes one, but A-1, Shaft, and P.A Works were a bit inconsistent.
>> ARTICLE
KyoAni only released Hibike (and it was amazing), but they're probably the most progressive and employee friendly workplace in the industry. That and the big players in their shows are not freelancers, so they have my vote.

Madhouse.

They adapt manga better than any other studio, and their quality is always top notch even in their lower-tier animes.

Madhouse for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
Where's studio feel ? 
>> ARTICLE
No one nominated them. Read the post/comments to learn to add it to the wild card :p

I wanna give it to both Madhouse and J.C Staff, one gave me some good story and action, the other gave me ecchi comedy, which is nice.
>> ARTICLE
I do think Ufotable, KyoAni and I.G were all good this year but hats off to Madhouse, Madhouse is definitely the studio of the year.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, two best anime of the year by far were Death Parade and One Punch Man, so I'm going to vote Ufotable just to mess with people.
>> ARTICLE
It might be better to bold everything over 8 and bold/italicize everything over 8.5. There are literally only 12 entries in [all of MAL](http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) that have scored 9 or higher (and 5 of them are Gintama). Over 8 is generally considered a great show.

A-1 pictures 
>> ARTICLE
That's a tough call.  A-1, Bones, Madhouse, PA Works, Sunrise, and Ufotable all have good arguments going for them.

If I had to I would drop Ufotable and PA Works for quantity.  Leaves what, A-1, Bones, Madhouse, Sunrise.

- A-1 has a ton of titles, several of high quality.
- Bones has three great shows.
- Madhouse has a few great shows.
- Sunrise has one great and a few good shows.  I guess Sunrise now drops off the list.  IBO+Origin with a backup of Cross Ange and GBFT can't quite match the competition IMO.

I guess that makes for 3, good enough to vote.
>> ARTICLE
Toss up between Madhouse, J.C and A1 but I think A1 gets it because Shigatsu was the most beautiful anime both visually and storyline I've seen for years.
>> ARTICLE
Visually (animation) One Punch Man is by far the best on any list. OPM has a simpler story but it's just as beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
J.C. Staff for Kangoku Gakuen, Heavy Object, Shokugeki and Shimoneta.

A-1 Pictures for Gate and Saekano.

Bones for Concrete Revolutio.
>> ARTICLE
First studio that I'll go for is Shaft, all of the anime listed I watched and they are responsible for what Monogatari has become. No way I can not vot for them for the enjoyment they gave me /fanboy
>> ARTICLE
Objectively is Madhouse without discussion. But we must wait if this is another "anime of 2015 poll" with the difference they are voting the studio and not the anime directly
>> ARTICLE
Wow, some studios have a lot. I was under the impression that KyoAni was one of the bigger studios, how is it that some others are able to make 6-7 a year while they just make one? Do they really put 6-7 times the resource into one project? 

Regardless, they still get my vote(along with MH). Reason is, most of the best shows this year, a lot of the credit goes to the original work. But KyoAni made a 10/10 show out of a 6.5/10 source material.

Yeah, the way this poll is presented makes it look like you're judging studios by volume of output, but it's Kyoani's business practices that give them the clear lead for me.

It would be interesting to see a table giving how much each studio pays its animators.
>> ARTICLE
Downvoted huh. I didn't realise allowing animators to afford to eat is a controversial notion.
>> ARTICLE
Reddit downvotes anything that is even remotely controversial. I, for one, agree that KyoAni's business practices are among the best for an anime studio, but that's because KyoAni makes a ton of money for the number of people they employ and the relatively few anime they put out. Most anime studios are not that successful, and budgets are extremely, extremely tight. Even studios that do find success put out anime that fall short of expectations, and they end up paying for those with the profits from their successful ones. In addition, most studios are just contractors, so they might not see all the profits that a show gets.
>> ARTICLE
Bones #1 cuz they managed to release the final episode of Kekkai Sensen before the end of the year XD
>> ARTICLE
ITT: People sucking Madhouse dick and pretending ratings on MAL matter (parasyte and nanatsu no taizai are rated higher than shirobako lmao)

Anywa, I think Bones is the best studio of the year.

Kekkai Sensen, ConRevo and Noragami Aragoto were all absolutely amazing in their own right with Akagami being a  very solid shoujo.

With Madhouse on the other hand the only thing I can truly give a thumbs up for is Death Parade, which was amazing.

One Punch Man hardly deserves to be credited to Madhouse (everything that made it exceptional was done by Natsume Shingo and his team of S-tier animators who jump around studios a lot, and even beyond that they mostly got animators from other places like bones).

Parastye shat the bed in it's second half really hard (not to mention the CG background characters) and Overlord was a pretty terrible adaption that had potential.

Ore Monogatari was a solid shoujo which got most of its strength from its source manga (like akagami), and Dia no Ace's pacing in the 2nd season has been atrocious so I dropped it a while back.

Probably gonna get downvoted into oblivion by the madhouse circlejerk but just wanted to put this out there because it was boring seeing every comment riding Madhouse's dick.
>> ARTICLE
I really hated Parasyte. I have it at a 4/10 in MAL
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but it's not gonna matter cuz all the sheep fanboys/girls are just gonna vote for madhouse
>> ARTICLE
The hype around OPM will probably top all, but Shirobako was so, so good.
>> ARTICLE
why was it so good ? i think its overrated its just watching girls working xd
>> ARTICLE
It's one of very few shows that managed to deftly handle an ensemble cast and flesh out most if not all of the characters.  It had above-average art with genuinely unique character designs for said giant ensemble, even going so far as to provide new outfits to characters on a regular basis.  It had very relatable experiences to anyone that is working on their career and that likely resonated with a lot of people.  It showcased the creation of anime in a fun, albeit heavily exaggerated, way which is at least mildly interesting to most anime fans.

I mean, I could keep going, but the skinny is that Shirobako had a loooot of attention to detail in it.  It was a project born of love, and it showed. It was cathartic for a lot of working people and it was just damn enjoyable with very few flaws to speak of.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, every likes different things.  
  
It was a well animated, well written anime with a fantastic cast of well designed characters, that gave us a real, albeit slightly exaggerated look at some points into the medium we love with lots of emotion. We laughed, we cried, we hated characters, we felt the frustration and the happiness. It was nearly perfect.

But it was awful. It failed at everything. 
>> ARTICLE
[Well...](http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/files/2015/08/Thats_just_your_opinion.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Not an opinion that it failed in its writing. But of course you rely on the typical excuse people use to defend shitty shows.
>> ARTICLE
If the purpose of its writing is to touch someone emotionally and it actually does touch someone emotionally, it's kind of silly to say that it failed for that person.

The whole point of polls like this is that there is no objective answer. What works for one will crash and burn for another. The closest we can get is finding out which shows appealed to the most people.
>> ARTICLE
> which shows appealed to the most people

Popularity =\= quality. I am talking about the actual writing of the series, which has objective standards. If PM touched you emotionally, the problem is with you and your lack of critical thinking. 
>> ARTICLE
Would you mind laying out the objective, quantitative way to assess the qualitative relative merits of a piece of visual media, in such a way that anyone reading your analysis would be unable to dispute it? I have a Master's in the field, so feel free to get technical.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm not doing that. Did you really expect me to write out an essay on reddit just for you? No. I will however leave it at this. For example, plot holes and manipulative writing are objective detriments. I am not talking about the overall opinion or quality being objective. I am talking the script. Don't bullshit me with "well it's all subjective so therefore don't criticize shitty shows!" And a Master's in what, exactly? You not specifying leads me to believe you don't have one.
>> ARTICLE
> manipulative writing

isn't this a dumb criticism for a show trying to be dramatic? I mean come on, if it makes you feel, isn't drama working?
>> ARTICLE
> manipulative writing

That's far from an "objective" detriment. Every author worth their salt uses principles of emotional manipulation. From Haruki Murakami to Stephen King, from J.K. Rowling to Shakespeare, it's a standard part of the toolset. Sorrow, rage, terror, justice, comfort, intellectual satisfaction: they are all part and parcel of the art of writing, and the ability to invoke those in the audience is what writers of every flavor work hard to achieve.

You can find it in the entire range of anime. From Legend of the Galactic Heroes to Naruto, from Hunter x Hunter to Clannad, from Monster to Nisekoi, from Another to Aria, the pattern is in clear evidence all over the place. So unless you're saying that *all* anime (much less all fiction regardless of medium) has these "objective detriments", then half of your argument fails at its face.

The plot holes, on the other hand, I'll still accept as a given.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm sorry for being a pleb then, would you explain why it failed its writing?

So many high scoring shows on my list. Death Parade, Shigatsu, OPM, Noragami, etc. all were fantastic. Hard to pick one, but if I REALLY had to, it would be Death Parade probably. It made highest up on my all time favorites list out of all the other shows I watched in 2015, it was THAT good in my opinion. Yeah it had its flaws, as did most of the shows on here, but it just did it really well. I loved it.

I don't know how or why this trend of being obsessed with female characters started (okay, I guess I can have a small idea given the main demographic of this subreddit and the anime community in general), but to be honest I find the VAST majority of the best anime characters to be males, so it's a bit sad when they are overshadowed due to shallowness.
>> ARTICLE
Part of it might be because a good amount of male MCs are boring, generic self-inserts or the occasional whiny Shinji-type. Of course they're not all like that, but I'm sure this also contributes in some way.
>> ARTICLE
Most popular shows have many more female characters than male (SAO, Akame Ga Kill, Steins; Gate, and the entire 'harem' genre come to mind) so theres  significantly more competition in the female character bracket.

Edit: After I posted this I started thinking of all the immensely popular shows with predominantly male casts, so allow me to modify my statement: Most shows which are popular *on this sub* have more female characters than male.

The problem is that it's usually the females that are the "gimmick" or more unique in those series. There are simply more fun female archetypes that they are willing to play around with compared to male archetypes.

> Best Male Character of 2014

As much as I praise Gilgamesh, he hasn't done anything yet in what's aired of UBW. 
>> ARTICLE
So Killua is a choice but isn't in the poll? Seems legit. I already voted before I noticed, ended up voting for worse characters.

Plus Lancer is in the poll but not on the list. I'm confused.

Wow, this is a weird mistake. I'll add Lancer into the thread, but for some reason the poll closed, as in I can't edit it.. I'll see what I can do though.

Wild Card test

Edit: here's a little more info. This is specifically for the people that didn't see the nomination thread. Basically, I'll be doing this for the rest of my threads. Each thread, I will have a maximum number of wild cards (for this one, it's 5). The top 5 (or other amount for another thread) will get a second chance and be in the final vote which will be held sometime after the end of the other polls, which is Wednesday, February 4. I'll probably end up posting it the 7th or the 8th. 

TL;DR, if you want characters added, comment them here.

It was nominated. 
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, the [Nomination Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ro3ci/ranime_awards_2014_category_nominations/) was confusing as fuck to use/participate in. Granted i didn't watch many seasonal animes last year myself, some of the nominations that made it through were like "..Really??" 

For Future Nomination Threads, i think a Collective-Elimination vote would serve as a better format. Take Every Title from the year, break them all down in catagories, Make the public vote 10 out of each. Top 10 in each catagory goes on to the Finals (The Award Show). 
>> ARTICLE
I don't really see how the nomination thread was confusing. If anything, I thought it was really simple. You find the category you want and then you vote for your anime/character/whatever. It wasn't that hard. Even if you asked me a question I did my best to be clear and make sense while explaining what to do/how it worked. I was even willing to link to a thread if you couldn't find it. 

I think I might actually still do this. I'm going to finish posting these poll threads daily and then do one big thread with all of the categories limited to just 10 nominees or 5 for the less popular ones (like sports in this case.)
>> ARTICLE
> I don't really see how the nomination thread was confusing.

idk, maybe im just retareded (not even joking hahaha), Well now looking at it as it sits (complete), it's not so bad. The last i looked at it was as soon as it was posted-several hours after. Things were moving up and down, There were a couple troll nominations that went up "Boku no pico!"/etc. It was complete Chaos in a sense. But it even'd out pretty nice.

Great thread. Sadly, most of these I haven't seen, so it's pretty easy to make a choice when you have either SAO or PP2, for example.
>> ARTICLE
~~Sakura Trick for romance~~
>> ARTICLE
SAO II is up there as a romance. Unless Kirito x Asada is canon, it shouldn't be up there. 
>> ARTICLE
Here are my personal favourites from the particular genres (trying to make it so that the strength of the genre dictates my choice):

* Comedy: Mangaka-san to Assistant-san

The only show of the year where I can honestly say I was laughing from start to finish every single episode (and during each of the full length OVAs). The particular brand of comedy it supplies is far from for everyone but it worked so well for me.

* Slice of Life: Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou

Sakurasou is my favourite show of all time and I think Kawaisou is the closest any anime has come to replicating the humour and setting. The romance was brilliant even though [](/s "it didn't develop as far as we all would have liked"). The humour was wonderful and the characters were unique and colourful. It was a show with a lot of heart and I hope it gets a second season at some point.

* Harem: Nisekoi

The best way to compare harems is by their girls and every girl in Nisekoi is a serious best girl candidate. The reaction gifs and humour are marvelous and SHAFT did a ridiculously good job keeping their SHAFTiness *relatively* contained.

* Thriller: WIXOSS

Continuous plot twists, lots of suffering, an interesting premise and fantastic delivery.

* ~~Sports~~

Not a fan of the genre, didn't watch any of the options. Tried to watch Ping Pong but unfortunately I have huge trouble getting into shows with art styles that I don't like.

* Romance: Sakura Trick

Continuous kissing, which funnily enough is rather unique. Maybe it's not the best show ever but the romance had me from start to finish and has kept me rewatching particular scenes since the show ended.

* Science Fiction: Aldnoah.Zero

This was a hard section since I'm not sure Aldnoah would deserve it. Parasyte isn't Sci-Fi enough for me to vote for it and I haven't seen a lot of the rest. Aldnoah was very entertaining at least, even though the writing was at times disappointing.

* Action/Battle Shounen: Noragami

The premise, the characters and the action were all great. Not much else to say. Hiyori best girl.

edit: reasoning
>> ARTICLE
> Romance: Sakura Trick

It had some great potential, but I flipt a table when it turned into the most generic yuri anime ever 5 episodes in. Like it wasn't even funny how generic it became. Such a shame, because it could've been a lot better than it was if not for that.
>> ARTICLE
> the most generic yuri anime ever

If you know another yuri anime with kissing (let alone that much kissing) please, *please* enlighten me.

The plot was pretty typical of SoLs but the execution was not.

Yes, I put down two for everything. But I figured I would stop there...after all, it is "Best of the Year", not "Everything good in the year". Only put one for 'Harem' though; only one worth the vote really.

**Mushishi and Space Dandy** were one of my favorite shows from 2014, but I'm having a hard time nominating them as any of these genre.

EDIT: The genre have apparently been voted for earlier.

Out of curiosity, why is Mushishi in Slice of Life? While I recognize it's difficult to categorize and deals with some daily trivialities, doesn't putting it alongside Yuuki Yuuna and other, well, *slice of life-y* anime kind of ... diminish it? If anything I feel like it should be listed under Thriller, especially as dark as some episodes this series were.

I have a feeling I missed a poll thread along the line somewhere. >.>
But I guess it's so niche it probably wouldn't win any popularity contests anyway, so I'll just vote for it and move on.

Sincerely, I don't even know why Yuuki Yuuna is on the slice of life genre (And almost taking the prize at that)

Mushishi is in slice of life because that's where it was nominated. 

It seems a lot of people missed the nomination thread. I'm getting a lot of complaints that certain shows didn't make it in :/

Not really as funny as the characters are top tier and extremely entertaining and fun to watch

Tsukimonogatari

But honestly I am not a fan of any of those shows

Haven't actually watched Parasyte, but it's the only one I'm willing to vote for considering what I know about the series

I heard Shigatsu is great, but I still haven't watched it and know nothing about it

Parasyte again

Hunter x Hunter

Not only it's the only show I liked on the list, it's one of my favorite of all time

Voted for Trinity Seven for Harem which is likely only me. >_> My reasoning is that it actually has romantic development, good girls, and can support itself as a Harem. [It's the only Harem series this year](/s " to develop an actual stable mutual Harem.")

I can understand Nisekoi love but I don't think it's a High Quality Harem series at all. It regularly uses from the big book of tropes, dense as fuck protagonist, and very little actual romantic progression. It's strong points though are the cute girls and the visuals... Which is about it in my opinion. I think it's a better comedy series than a romance series. 
>> ARTICLE
Comedy: No Game No Life

Slice of Life: Haven't seen any except Shigatsu, and I don't consider Shigatsu AOTY so no vote

Harem: Monogatari

Thriller: Parasyte

Romance: no vote

Sports: no vote but its pretty safe to say Ping Pong will win it

Sci-Fi: Psycho-pass 2

Action Shounen: Log Horizon
>> ARTICLE
Comedy - Amagi brilliant park for being half funny and having characters named after rappers. 5/10 won't watch again but worth my time. 

Honorable mention goes to space dandy s2 which I didn't finish. 

Slice of life - Space Brothers for being a mature story about adults with actual dreams that I can be invested in and caring about its characters. Too slow at times though and pretty long. 7/10 won't watch again because too long but it was good. 

Silver spoon s2 because the show does a good job in portraying it's characters and making them go through struggles actual teenagers go through. Also it was very funny and charming. 8/10 will probably watch again some day. 

Harem - whatever monogatari stuff that aired this year because monogatari is best harem. Usually 6 or 7/10 because too much otaku pandering. 

Thriller - abstain because I haven't seen anything good. But it's probably between wixoss, rage of Bahamut and terror in resonance 

Romance - (edit) the wind rises is my choice because it was half decent. Forgot it's considered romance. 

Sports - PING PONG THE FUCKING ANIMATION MOTHERFUCKER 

SciFi - space Brothers for being the best series in the category. 

Action/ Battle Shonen - HxH - if this was 2013 and I had to pick between Jojos (2012) and hunter x hunter it would have been hard. But this year stardust crusaders was pretty weak compared to Jojos 2012 so HxH gets my vote. 

>> ARTICLE
> Comedy

Nothing 

Perhaps Gekkan Shoujo.  I didn't particularly find anything too funny this year, especially not the shows which were nominated.

>Slice of Life

Barakamon - I mean it's not really a unique idea but it was executed so well and so much charm it'd be foolish to vote otherwise

> Harem

Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai

> Thriller

Zankyou no Terror - I didn't particularly like ZnT but it had some good cliffhangers in the middle and did what a thriller should do.  I think the best thriller isn't even on this list lol.  Argevollen is nowhere to be found

> Romance

Soredemo Sekai no Utskushii - It was really well done, and the subtle changes in the OP reflect the level of endearment the crew had for their show.  It might have been a bit boring for some considering a lot of popular romances are drama's but I think this is the best we had.  

>Sports

Ping Pong the Animation - I think this show is way overrated and I was one of the people hyping this up.  But even then this show was one of the better ones of its season and probably the best sports anime, and put a little twist on the formulaic genre.

> Science Fiction

Sidonia no Kishi - This one just takes the cake.  You may have a bit to say with the CGI (which was handled pretty well) and stock footage reusage but goddamn this was one of the better scifi universes animated this year

You didn't even mention Zvezda under winter but mentioned Pupa? You also list Mekaku, NGNL, Black Bullet and Brynhildr for Spring, but not Gochuumon, Mushishi,  Kawaisou, Haikyuu, or Chaika? 

Jesus christ its almost like you want it to be an auto win for Fall.

My vote is Spring>Fall>Winter>Summer
>> ARTICLE
Fall > Spring > Summer > Winter

Pretty easy choices for me.
>> ARTICLE
~~I mean, winter hasn't even started airing. I get that you can tell roughly how it's gonna be, but there may be some surprises. Rest of the list looks sound though.~~

I'm dumb.
>> ARTICLE
Since you got it now, where would you put last winter?
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you :^)
>> ARTICLE
Winter is the start of the year for anime. So we're on the last season for 2014.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a stupid person. 
>> ARTICLE
He's not wrong about the next season having a few surprises though. Ansatsu Kyoushitsu looks good, for one, along with some others.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly AssClass is being done by the people that worked on Persona 4 The Animation, Persona 4 Golden The Animation and Danganronpa....it's going to be horrible.
>> ARTICLE
For someone who didn't watch those, what was so bad about them?  Without AssClass nothing other than new seasons/continuations seems interesting...
>> ARTICLE
In general they had terrible pacing with events that helped develop characters got glossed over or ignored especially in the case of Danganronpa. It was even worse with Persona 4 Golden The Animation where they decided to make the entire focus of the story on the new character that was added in the P4G game as well as the side events new to the game. As such they skipped hours of story between episodes which made it impossible for those that never played the game (or watched the horrible adaptation that is P4A) to understand what was happening. It was basically 12 episodes of non-sequential events. The animation was pretty bad overall too.
>> ARTICLE
Well I guess I'll just pass on AssClass then...

Of course I take all of your analyses with a grain of salt...
>> ARTICLE
Well no I'm not saying not to watch AssClass, the source material is fantastic. I just have zero faith in those working on it to do it justice.
>> ARTICLE
Picked up the manga recently, and I can confirm that AssClass is far better than it's ironic short name makes it seem. 
>> ARTICLE
Spring and Fall are tied right now. Then Winter and Summer was least favorite.
>> ARTICLE
Even though all the seasons for the year isn't over yet, I feel that the  Fall Season just has so many good ones  compared to the rest.
>> ARTICLE
Fall is hands-down the top of this year imo. In order of my preference I'd say Fall>Summer>Winter>Spring.
>> ARTICLE
Spring had Ping Pong. 
>> ARTICLE
Fall 2014 all the way! love Kiseijuu and Shigatsu wa kimi no uso!!!
>> ARTICLE
The current season. By far. 

The sheer *volume* of great shows is mindboggling.

I'm watching 27 of the season's shows and I'd argue that of those 27, 17 are exceptional (quite possibly more, fell behind on a few because of exams so I ignored those).

Fall > Winter > Spring =~ Summer
>> ARTICLE
Spring had Ping Pong, which is AOTD. It also had Mushishi and Jojo. How is Fall supposed to beat that?
>> ARTICLE
Didn't like Ping Pong and I'm not a fan of JoJo.

Can't speak for Mushishi.
>> ARTICLE
Fall also has mushishi. soooo...
>> ARTICLE
I won't call Ping Pong AOTD, when we had The Tatami Galaxy, also Stardust Crusaders is overrated, when compared to battle tendecy and there is Mushishi in this season too
>> ARTICLE
How the hell is SC overrated compared to BT? There is nothing more overrated than Battle Tendency.
>> ARTICLE
Fall best season of the year.

No brainer here.
>> ARTICLE
not an easy choice, but i guess i'll vote for summer.
>> ARTICLE
So far, for me it's Fall=Summer>Winter>Spring

You also forgot to mention Dandy S2 in summer.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much the reverse order. The more current, the better in my opinion(not because they are more current, just a strange trend)
>> ARTICLE
Fall and Summer were/are pretty good, while Winter and Spring didn't have anything for me I think. The entire gap between the end of Attack on Titan and the summer season was only filled with Knights of Sidonia for me I think. Was pretty depressing.
I will go with Fall with Psycho Parasyte Works.
>> ARTICLE
Fall > Spring > Summer > Winter
>> ARTICLE
Fall > Spring > Summer > Winter

i think summer with fall and spring close behind
