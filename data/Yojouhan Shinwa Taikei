**Mahou Shoujo MadokaMagica** - The visuals were good, the OST amazing and I understand why people would have liked it but it just didn't click with me. It was neither sad nor depressing (imo) and I couldn't really feel anything for the characters despite being a huge Shaft and Urobutcher fan.

oh man that explains why everyone loves it, man i didnt realize shaft made it.

I gave it a 6 and would have given it a 4 or 5 if not for the visuals and OST and I also agree on the Madoka part. I was disappointed after finishing it because I was so looking forward to finally watching it and until that happened I had to escape minefields of spoilers and read almost only praises for the show so my expectations were pretty high which was also part of the reason why I didn't end up liking it.
>> ARTICLE
>couldn't they just wish away witches??

[ok, spoilers](/s "kyuubey wasn't in the business of letting the magical girls make wishes with full knowledge of the system.  also 'wishing away witches' was a powerful wish that only someone with madoka's karmic importance - which was built up by homura's messing with the timeline - could offset with her suffering.  like did you even watch the show?")
>> ARTICLE
But, did any of them really need to know the system in order to think of wishing for that?

>> ARTICLE
I was waiting the entire fucking time for [spoilers](/s "Madoka to wish Mami back to life. Like okay, I don't really get the bullshit magic system, so maybe it wouldn't have worked, but Madoka didn't even TRY IT.")

[spoilers](/s "I guess part of the reason why wishes are given to ten year old girls is that apparently ten year old girls are retardedly shortsighted and have no imagination whatsoever. ")


>> ARTICLE
It was a good enough show on its own merits, but I didn't like it.

The thing that always irked me was-- and feel free to dispute me, anyone-- when it was popular, people were always claiming it was a beautiful deconstruction of the Magical Girl genre. I could tell these people have not watched a whole lot of Magical Girl anime, because it felt like it was playing things extremely by the book. I didn't feel any innovation there. It was, in some ways, what TTGL was to mecha anime: a return to form, not a reinventing of the genre.
>> ARTICLE
Generally, if the term "deconstruction" is being used seriously, the person using it is a fanboy and the show in question is not a "deconstruction" of anything.

I remember when people were calling Aldnoah a deconstruction of the mecha genre. Fucking hilarious. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll admit I haven't seen a lot of magical girl shows outside of a few episodes of Sailor Moon here and there  as a kid. I do think Madoka stands up as a deconstruction however, not so much by it's plot or story but by it's setting and universe.

A deconstruction seeks to explore a set of tropes deeper and extrapolate to show any consequences, problems, or inconsistencies that might arise. In Madoka, this deconstruction takes the form of exploring why young girls in particular are chosen for great power, what the reason for existence of magical girls is, what kind of being would seek out young girls to exploit, what happens to magical girls when they "grow out of it", what the source of a magical girl's power really is, why would one ever voluntarily agree to a lifetime of war with evil, etc.

It might be entirely possible that another show has also explored these questions and possibly even come up with similar answers. Madoka does explore them for certain though and I feel that does rightfully qualify it as a deconstruction.

What makes it a 7 for me is that if its 3rd episode hook is spoiled, you wont get hooked and will obviously not enjoy it as much. I know what you guys are thinking, that of course you wont like it as much if it gets spoiled, that doesnt make it less of a great show. And i would respectfully disagree; i think unspoiled its a solid 8.5 or so, spoiled its like a 6. 

And just to put it into context, ive had steins gate, ttgl, akame ga kill and the entirety ofthe first 4 seasons of game of thrones spoiled for me. I can confidently say that my enjoyment of these shows spoiled vs unspoiled would not be as different as madoka. Im not saying that these shows are better than madoka, but the fact that i got many key events spoiled for me did not hold as large as an effect on me while watching them than madoka spoliers did. If i had seen them unspoiled it wouldve definitely improved my "score" of them but not as much as 2 or so points.  Agk wouldve been maybe 1 point, but it still wouldve been like an 8 at best, while the others wouldve been a .5 or less difference.

What im trying to say is that while i do think madoka is a good show, and that i wouldve enjoyed much more had i not been spoiled of it, i dont think that the quality of a show, or to put it more subjectively your level of enjoyment had while watching, should rely so heavily on what is basically shock value. Although this is just my personal response from these shows, i dont think madoka is as great as the majority of this sub think because of it.
>> ARTICLE
Most of the people with a clear understanding of the show like it for other reasons entirely. Personally, I don't even consider it a deconstruction of the genre because while it superficially might have some elements of something that *could* be a deconstruction, that isn't the point of the show in the slightest.
>> ARTICLE
>despite being a huge shaft 

(   )
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the hype around that series partially ruined my enjoyment of that show, and I should have loved it more. When I watched, everyone was like "Madoka is a masterpiece, dark magical girls omg", and I expected something even better than it was. Also when I heard "dark" I was not only expecting it but I was expecting more intense than depressing. 

I feel bad because I know I would have liked it a lot otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
I think whenever you feel as though a show was partially ruined for you because you overhyped yourself, you should wait a while and then rewatch it again without any expectations, just to see if you enjoy it more than you did on your first watch now that you aren't expecting much. 
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion. I'm sorry. It's interesting, and I understand what's trying to be done with it, and I get why people like it, but I just can't enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched it twice and I still struggle to enjoy it. However, I can totally see why it's such a significant show in the context of the time that it was made. But Shinji's character. Oh man, I just can't bring myself to like him. Actually, I found it hard to connect with any of the characters in the show. There are some incredible moments in the series, but the characters were the weak point for me. I think I need to watch it again. 


>> ARTICLE
I don't think they were trying to make Shinji likable, but rather they were trying to portray him more realistically. He is a 14 year-old boy and completely alone. He thinks his father is trying to make up with him, but it turns out that he only wants to use him to fight giant world-destroying monsters. The only motherly relationship he has in his life is constantly under sexual tension. His "friends" either bash on him due to their own insecurity, or remain completely unresponsive to any of his attempts at connecting with them. Its hardly a far-fetched idea that he would be self-doubting and unable to express himself.

The distinction that needs to be drawn here is that Shinji is quite honestly the polar opposite of most Shounen-genre characters. Typically these character can overcome any obstacle/enemy with conviction, willpower, love, or friendship. Realistically, nobody can do this and Shinji's lack of these traits make some viewers perceive him as incompetent and babyish. But that's just my opinion on the matter, and I can understand how Eva in general is an acquired taste.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone is horrible in Eva.
>> ARTICLE
maybe thats why I like it so much (im a terrible person)
>> ARTICLE
you're not supposed to like shinji though. Hes a whiny bitch because thats how a real child with horrible depression would act in that situation. 
>> ARTICLE
The TV show was a watershed moment for the mecha genre. Before it was about plot-driven war politics, something about a love triangle, or combining/transforming superheroes, and there was really nothing in the genre that delved into the characters' psyches and made that its primary focus, and with a much more pessimistic outlook on human behavior.

But it's a diamond in the rough. Like, if a toad had a hairy anus made of sandpaper rough. As ambitious and as groundbreaking as it was, you don't get two decades of companion material if it was well polished.
>> ARTICLE
> As ambitious and as groundbreaking as it was, you don't get two decades of companion material if it was well polished.

I would say it's much more about the $$$$ than polishing the material.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but you won't get the money if there's no demand. Look at how something like the Ghost in the Shell remake was received. Many people consider the original GitS to be a masterpiece, with no additions / changes needed, there wasn't a lot of demand for a remake. Same thing is true for the 'remastered' Star Wars movies and what not.

Guilty Crown was technically as far as animation and music an absolute 10/10. Sadly, it's the worst most convoluted ass pulling, unfulfilling, poorly paced and written story I've ever seen that has without a doubt the shittiest ending ever conceived. Beautiful anime, listen to the OST all the time, would never suggest to my worst enemy. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like you're being a little too harsh.  It is nowhere near great, but to say that was the worst story you have ever seen is a big stretch.  That was the one of the worst endings I've seen though.  GC is a decent show, I would recommend it to people, but never as a must watch show.  
>> ARTICLE
It's true, I am harsh. I have a seething hatred for the thrown away potential in the story. It enticed me to follow it to the end and then it lead me off a cliff. 

My advice to the intern who wrote the story for his future works: 

* Delete all sick ideas of children having incest sex 

* Don't remove the most interesting character through possession bullshit 

* Let mech girl actually pilot her mech even one freaking time

* Try not to make the villains' motives and back stories incomprehensible 

* Don't conclude the final fight in 4 minutes in your 506 minute anime. [the shit ending](/s "Like really, the 5000 year old immortal who can teleport and resurrect dead humans in their entirety is killed with a battle speech and a sneeze...") There was a fucking beach episode but they didn't have time for the final boss fight?!

Even with a slow buildup and the awkward things going on in the Hitler arc I'd like to believe the show was still on track to wherever it was going but they fucked it, man. It was months ago when I watched and I'm still mad about it.
>> ARTICLE
Here's some more that I wrote up in my earlier bashing of Guilty Crown.

Deux Ex Machinimas:


[GC1](/s "that guy from Daa'th comes out of nowhere and takes Inori away and you have no idea who he is")
 
[GC2](/s "Gai somehow survives being hit by a 110% orbital bombardment with a few scratches") 

[GC3](/s "Inori's song apparently has the ability to send the anti-virus around the world for some reason") 

[GC4](/s "Shu somehow FORGETS he was best childhood friends with Gai and Mana (like... how)") 

[GC5](/s "gai magically comes back to life")

[GC6](/s "Mana apparently gains superpowers to reset the whole world by ballet dancing")

There's probably more, but I think your post and mine sums it all up pretty nicely.

Bakemonogatari. It has a unique art style and great dialogue. But for some reason it didn't click with me. 
>> ARTICLE
Same. For me it was the characters. They just didn't appeal to me, especially Senjougahara.
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree with you but for different reasons. I understand why people like the Shaft art style but I can not stand it. It is beautiful at times but I feel like its excessive a lot of times and distracting. I've seen a few of their other productions (ef, madoka, some others) and if I power through some of the excessive "art", I truly love the characters and stories.  

Haven't gotten through Bakemonogatari though. I'll probably give it another shot in the future because I know the story is supposed to be great
>> ARTICLE
The only Shaft show I didn't feel distracted by the art in a bad way was Nisekoi. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh! I totally forgot Nisekoi! I absolutely loved that show and I agree with you completely (maybe that's why I forgot Shaft was behind it). You can tell that Shaft is behind it when watching, but its not excessive and actually adds to the anime artistically (although, I think Nisekoi would have been just as enjoyable in a "traditional" animation style). I wish there as more like that. Need season 2 asap. Nice to see someone else feels the same way
>> ARTICLE
Onodera best girl(I just cut our chances to get along by 50%)

That said, I'm so glad there's a season 2 incoming.

I'm so glad that the show wasn't filled with Shaft antics. I can't even remember a single head-tilt now that I think of it.
>> ARTICLE
With you there. Animation is utterly gorgeous, fantastic music, Senjougahara is best girl, but I can't stand the series.

Maybe because of the harem angle, maybe the Nise incest, the creepy loli stuff, or maybe I'm just being a hipster and not liking it because of how hyped it gets.
>> ARTICLE
maybe this will help you get the show: everyone's personalities are exaggerated, but only their faults.

and the premise of the show is that only the person who wants to help themselves can be helped.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no that post I get. What I dislike is it feels like the show starts off with a fairly solid romance between two main characters, then trashed that with harem antics and fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
No actually the relationship of Araragi and Senjougahara got developed quite well. While the show is a harem show, their relationship is still the main core and a big part of the series.
>> ARTICLE
May i ask why Senjoughara is best girl for you? in my honest opinion i find her obnoxious and annoying and very much a pain in the neck, basically i'd rather die than keep up with her. Not to mention i hate tsun characters anyway, but i just don't find any redeeming qualities in her at all. if all you like about her is her witty way of talking then that's disappointing, because even that for me feels forced, i really don't like characters that show off that they are smart asses/holier than thou or something of that sort. I just finished Bakemonogatari and I'm watching Nisemonogatari. So yeah i just don't understand where this Senjoughara love comes from?
>> ARTICLE
She gets leaps and bounds better, both as a character and as a person, the longer the story goes on.
>> ARTICLE
Because once she decides she wants Arararararagi, she gotta straight for him. No yelling baka and running away. No stammering and blushing and "....anno". She's just like "let's hook up" and they do. Her tsun tendencies are a lot less tsun to me than they seem to be for you.

To be fair, I haven't watched the entire series and so I don't know Hanekawa really. What I do know is Senjougahara isn't another textbook tsun love interest to me. She reminds me a lot of Horo actually, which is probably why I like her.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;gate by virtue of its popularity, must have been pretty darn good.

But I just don't understand why I don't feel the same way (my taste is usually exceedingly congruent with the hive mind) Let me ask everyone:

* Was the show funny for you? My sense of humor should be similar to most people based on my score for other shows, but I can't remember laughing at any point in Steins;gate (aside from "hey mister").

* Do the characters make this show? I didn't find Okabe's eccentricities funny at all, nor was I amused by Daru's 2chan comments. Why is Kurisu amazing enough to win Best Girl? She's just mildly tsundere; I don't see how that's enough to beat the likes of Holo and Senjougahara.

* Did you like the music? Outside of the OP + ED and that one "Gate of Steiner" piano version, I thought the music was rather average - nothing like Clannad's OST.

>> ARTICLE
The way you word it, you make it sound like best girl should have been someone who was overly tsundere.

In my oppinion Kurisu won *because* of her realistic tsundere personality. By "realistic" I mean not over the top and over dramatical like most anime displays the tsundere personality type.
>> ARTICLE
To clarify, I'm saying there is nothing to Kurisu *but* her mild tsundere, and her role in supporting Okabe throughout every iteration. 

Like another user said, we really don't get to see Kurisu shine until the last 2/3rds of the story - and even then she only shines for overall plot related reasons (being Okabe's sole support throughout his ordeal). Her lines, voice acting, habits, background, and so on are all rather average. 

Mildly tsundere is great, but that alone shouldn't have been enough to beat someone like Holo, who is just oozing with sexiness and lore. I don't really like it when something wins a very specific area because it's carried by excellence in another somewhat unrelated area.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people saw the best girl contest as a "who would you want as your wife" contest (wifu contest).

In this case, some people, myself included, would rather marry someone who understands you and likes you for who you are, rather than a wolf who is very sexy, which she is. Holo pulls off "sexy" extremely well.
>> ARTICLE
>who understands you and likes you for who you are

Is this not also a part of Holo's attractiveness?
>> ARTICLE
>Was the show funny for you? My sense of humor should be similar to most people based on my score for other shows, but I can't remember laughing at any point in Steins;gate (aside from "hey mister").

So you're rating every anime on their comedy aspect even when they're not even a comedy? Good job

Even with your other two points, your questions are meaningless to why someone would be interested in a sci-fi/thriller
>> ARTICLE
To me Kurisu never comes into get own until she begins helping Okabe with his plans to change things; and that means nearly 2/3rds or more through the series. Before that she's just generic tsundere. 

But people vote for moments. They vote for emotional impact, and the last few episodes had that in spades despite, Monogatari and S&W being better shows overall. And that's why S;G wins everything.
>> ARTICLE
High five.

I refuse to believe that a show that takes 10 episodes to start being interesting is "good", let a lone "great". 
>> ARTICLE
For me it was how well the plot tied together.  I have serious issues with plot problems and I found that with Steins; Gate it all tied together beautifully which I really enjoyed.  However, [Spoiler](/s "I was familiar with the [John Titor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor) real world scenario before watching so once it was provided as a part of the story, that really got me into it").  So for me at least, it was about a lot outside of the humor and charactors.  But I get where you are coming from as well.
>> ARTICLE
The japanese Voice actors where brilliant and i really liked the pacing. 
>> ARTICLE
I personally wasn't a huge fan of the show, but this was mostly because I had already played through the visual novel (which is the best visual novel I have ever played btw) and the anime adaptation was ok, but I really didn't think it was that great.
>> ARTICLE
Interestingly, before today, I never questioned why I liked Steins;gate. 

I consider that it was a good fiction, well paced, well presented both visually and aurally, and interesting characters.
I think it's mainly because of the points above that even if the themes, plot or drama doesn't resonate with you, you have to agree that it's good. It's a consistent show; it's hard to point a flaw about it; or rather, the flaws (slow start) made the later episodes better.

Because of that, it's "technically" good. Even if the drama doesn't quite match up to others, or the comedy isn't quite as funny as others, or the characters aren't as appealing as others, because it doesn't have flaws that are blarring into your eyes like most others.

Personally, I loved it; underneath its crazy antics, it has quite a range of philosophical ideas, and I was kinda glad it kept most of the comedy in the "comic relief" side, so the tone of the show was consistent. Whether or not this was a smart anime, or a good fiction as I claim it to be, it nonetheless made me ponder and entertained.

Edit: On reflection; I probably will have a different answer if you ask me again in 10 minutes. This is really an interesting question.

Hm. I really like the show, but:
Not very funny.
Pretty good characters, but not genius.
I did like the music.

Soooo. Hmmmmm. Why do I like it? Perhaps it's Joss Whedon-esque, when he says "all of my shows are about created family". All of these characters were isolated, alienated, trodden-on, suppressed, or repressed in some way, and they find some sort of solace in their own ad-hoc created family and, ironically, facing a large shared problem, what to do with time travel, how to stop CERN.

But that's all explanation. I don't really know. I just like it.
>> ARTICLE
I kind of found it funny bashing her for being mildly tsundere and then mentioning senjouhara as a better girl, who I find at best mildly tsundere.
>> ARTICLE
The difference for me is (and it's hard to explain this, bear with me here) Senjougahara actually moves through the plot. And for Kurisu, it's more like the plot moves around her.

You could replace Kurisu's personality with anything, and it wouldn't really change anything except the humor. The plot would still totally make sense, because it doesn't rely on her being the way she is.

On the other hand, Senjougahara's personality is largely defined by her actions, and her actions drive the plot, at least for her own arcs. If she had a different personality, it wouldn't make sense for her to [(Nise and Second Season spoilers)](/s "incarcerate Araragi just because Kaiki is in town, or try to hire Kaiki without telling Araragi.")

I do love *Steins;Gate*, but I honestly think Senjougahara is a *waaay* more interesting character than Kurisu.
>> ARTICLE
I have to say that is one of the most well crafted and civil responses I have read on this sub, which is sad.   Totes good for you though
>> ARTICLE
I can see your main points about the show, and I consider Steins;Gate to be in my top 10. 

Daru was the funniest character for me, but I think a lot of his humour (along with the rest of the show's humour) would be lost on audience not familiar with the contemporary references, like 2chan. I enjoyed the humour, but the storyline and the near-flawless execution in telling it is the strongest point of the show for me.

I found Okabe difficult to like in the first half of the show. His eccentricity seemed very contrived and forced, and it wasn't until the second half that his character seemed more fleshed out and sympathetic. Kurisu, I thought was an excellent character. She wasn't over the top in any way, and I think a lot of people, myself included, saw her as a realistic and believable character. In contrast, Holo (whom I think is fantastic) is much more exaggerated in her personality with an air of infallibility.  I wouldn't say either character is better or worse than the other. They're both designed to fit the roles they're used in and they both do it nearly flawlessly.

And yeah, the OP song is one of the most memorable of any show, but there are certainly far better OST's out there. 
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean. I don't think it's necessarily the characters that make the show, for me. It's hard for me to explain why I liked it so much. I didn't find the characters funny, but I still liked the characters, if that makes sense to you.

To explain what I mean, I don't really laugh out loud when watching much anime comedies, but I still enjoy watching them if you get me. I'd substitute "laughing" for "grinning like an idiot" in my case. Spice And Wolf, for example. I doubt a grin left my face for roughly half of the show. One exception is Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun. I don't know why, just the chemistry and back-and-forth between Nozaki and Chiyo almost always made me laugh, especially Nozaki's deadpan Joey-from-Friends moments.

Getting back to Steins;Gate, I find Okabe's character and his role in the events to be incredibly tragic. He's basically an adult stuck in a child's mindset trying to deny everything around him, and trying to link the misfortunes of his life to some seemingly non-existent entity.

Then, while he's this personality that tries to deny everything around him, all these really horrible things start happening to him. He's stuck in this chain of cause-and-effect that he can't get out of, and you start imagining as the viewer that, given the person he is, there's probably little more he wants to do than turn off the lights, stick his head under a pillow and pretend it's not real.

That resonated with me because I could see some of myself in him. A forced goofiness to disguise the fact that you can't really cope with society that well.

Also, I do think the soundtrack has some other nice pieces. I like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE51Xz9XD1I) in particular.

More than anything, I think it's the atmosphere of the show that makes it. It's always very hard to explain something like atmosphere because it's so intangible, and you can't really put a numerical value on it like you can with something like Voice Acting or Soundtrack or Plot. I thought Steins;Gate was dripping with a unique atmosphere, the same way video games like Dark Souls or Shadow Of The Colossus are dripping with atmosphere.

I don't think, I know Sword Art Online is technically good, *great* in fact, in its animation and soundtrack.

Now if only Reki Kawahara could've written well-developed characters in a properly paced story in his apartment all those years ago, we'd all be much better off now.

Besides the art and animation I really do think SAO is bad for the reasons you said which is why I really *really* despise the show, the characters are just terrible

Agree completely! I like SAO because it's pretty and characters are likeable. Also there was a great, interesting idea in making players game's prisoners but for me potential was not properly used. 


Further story is just whatever. Still watching SAO 2 because I kinda got used to Kirito, that's probably the only reason.

Attack on Titan is extremely well made and good but it is not really my cup of tea, I ended up getting kind of bored after a while
>> ARTICLE
After my first watch through, I wasn't sure how I felt. The titans still creeped me out, and I thought the premise was weird. I then watched it a 2nd and 3rd time a while later, and it just got better. The soundtrack is amazing, the visuals look superb, and the characters have a wide range of personalities. I cared about the characters the more I rewatched. The emotional scenes were more impactful, and I wasn't focusing on the gore. So if you haven't already, I would recommend rewatching. If you still don't love it, it probably isn't your thing.

Beautiful and simple. Riddled with plotholes and bad characters. Exciting but lacking. So good but so meh.

You could go into more detail about the plotholes.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody ever does really when they point out "plot holes" in anime they watch. They just say "Oh yeah the show (not just talking AoT here) has tons of plotholes." Then when people call them out to explain, they either never do, or just bring up some extremely minor things that 70% of the time actually *was* explained in the show. 

Maybe this guy will be different though who knows. 
>> ARTICLE
Or they point to different types of bad writing (like contrivances or deus ex machina) rather than actual plot holes. Sure, they may be unpleasant, but they're not *an event that disobeys a story's internal logic* (which is what plot holes are).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Most "anime critics" don't have any idea what they're talking about. Half the time they just throw out literary terms they heard in highschool English class to sound smart. 
>> ARTICLE
What plotholes? I really am not getting that out of AoT at all. 
>> ARTICLE
Chances are he's going to be like everyone else who talks about "plot holes" in an anime. 9/10 times people will just yell "Oh yeah that show has a ton of plot holes" then never explain what they are. People then just upvote half the time because "Oh he said plot holes so he must know what he's talking about."

It's actually quite annoying.

I think this stems from most people not even understanding what plot holes really are. A plot hole necessitates a logical inconsistency in the story. This type of thing is honestly pretty rare and it's hard to even think of many. I always see people referring to something silly like a character showing up in the nick of time as a plot hole when it definitely isn't. Is it great writing? Probably not. But that doesn't mean it's an actual plot hole.

Can you explain what plotholes exactly? Im curious i have yet to see it.

Wait is there is a plot aside from "get into that basement?"

Yes but i can't say so without spoiling it.

AoT actually gets a pretty sophisticated plot and becomes more a political intrigue lately.

That's not plothole, that's just Anime physics.

It is stated you are supposed to have a lot of physical strength to use them. Not to mention they train for 3 years to become adapted to it.

It was explained on one of the eyecatches. They have some kind of full body brace underneath their clothing.

I absolutely LOVED AoT untill [Spoilers](/s "Eren turned into a titan")
>> ARTICLE
It would have been fantastic if he [](/s "just died."). Like, can you imagine?
>> ARTICLE
Sure can, AoT had so much potential in my books, im not saying its bad but could have been soooo much better
>> ARTICLE
Him [](/s "turning into a titan") just made it "just another shounen" IMO. If the perceived protagonist of the story just [](/s "straight up dies"), it would have completely subverted my expectations and I would have liked it more than I did. However, they just *had* to pull out the [](/s "deus ex machina bs") and after that it wasn't really anything special in my books.
>> ARTICLE
OMG finally some people having same thought I had about AoT!!!
>> ARTICLE
I know, right? I never see anyone make a complaint about it. It's an all right show, but I don't really think it's anything special after *that* happens.
>> ARTICLE
I loved human vs titans because it was a new take on 'man versus monster' where a normal guy with no background suddenly becomes hero after picking up a gun/sword. It actually showed army-like teaching and all that stuff.


But then *that* happened and the 'suddenly becomes hero' happened only that it wasn't weapon pickup.
>> ARTICLE
It could have been a Madoka of shounens. Unfortunately, it became just a shounen.
>> ARTICLE
Well drawn too. 
>> ARTICLE
its great if you like what its about and you get the feel of the titan mystery and shit. for me personally that made the show one of my favorites 
>> ARTICLE
Started off really well, but then it just devolved into shonen
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed the visuals and storyline for AoT and I liked that it wasn't afraid to embrace the violence and brutality. But Eren....ugh. I found him quite difficult to appreciate as a main character. I also found Mikasa rather flat and unimaginative in the way they designed her personality. The supporting characters were much more interesting in comparison. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I loved AoT, but fuck Eren and Mikasa. Outside of being strong/badass, Mikasa didn't really have anything to make me like her. Eren was just annoying. If I hear "ILL KILL ALL THE TITANS!" One more time I'm going to go nuts. 

Liked all the other characters though, especially Jean.
>> ARTICLE
Usually I would agree, but I think Eren and Mikasa being the way they are is justified, by what they have seen. Mikasa saw her parents die right in front of her. Eren may be a bit unrealistic with the whole swearing vengeance on Titans of all things, but it's kinda understandable.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying it wasn't understandable. I still found it annoying though. 
>> ARTICLE
Have to agree - these two are pretty disappointing (especially Eren being... Eren) but there are some really awesome characters. In s1 Levi is interesting, Erwin seems pretty ok but after s1 anime his character is very nicely written. I love his showing there. 

These are only my two examples.

[Hakuouki]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/6895)

It was for the most part just so boring and I have no idea why. On paper it should be a good show but I just couldn't get into it.

It's based off of an otoge so they couldn't commit to a specific story line, I think.

Madoka Magica, I've said this before but I generally think the idea is great. The art style is creative. But for the life of me I cannot bring myself to like the show entirely. 
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was written well, paced well, has fantastic action scenes, and great characters.

But I like the original anime better, so that's that.
>> ARTICLE
The popularity of Brotherhood stems from all the people who read the manga. I can't stand the original FMA anime because it diverges from the manga so much that it drives me nuts. It's entirely understandable to like the original anime on its own, though.
>> ARTICLE
I have seen both series and never read the manga, Brotherhood is just the better story. It's a lot less convoluted, it's simply a better written story that's answers a lot of questions and plot holes the original series left open.
>> ARTICLE
Me too.  I recognize that it is one of those objectively good shows.  Solid story, great animation/high production values, a lot of good characters and so on.  Still, I didn't like it.  I think I couldn't stay interested because I found the humor to be too repetitive with the Boke Tsukkomi thing. I had trouble getting fully engaged in the characters because of this, and it kind of snowballed into me not caring about the story because I didn't care about the Ed and Al.  I did like that Armstrong guy though, he was great.  Sadly, not great enough to keep me watching.

I watched the 2003 one back in the day, but I was 13 back then.  My tastes have surely changed as well.


>> ARTICLE
I go with *Nichijou*. I can understand why someone would love this and give it an 10/10, but for me the comedy was often hit or miss with the exception of the Professor, Nano & Sakamoto trio. Those three always worked for me, especially the Crow part. A 7/10 nonetheless, but I expected more tbh.

Edit: grammar & words
>> ARTICLE
I can see that. Nichijou clicked for me perfectly and I adore it, but it's definitely not for everyone, especially since humor is such a subjective thing.

EASY. Grave of the Fireflies. Does anyone actually *like* watching this? It's one of the best things I've ever seen, but no force on heaven or earth will ever make me watch it again.

I'm with you on that one. That movie masterfully accomplished its goal of being a miserable depiction of what war really means. But never again will I sit through it...

All post-Hyouka KyoAni series really
>> ARTICLE
I feel the exact same way.

Perhaps its because I feel like KyoAni is capable of making top tier shows I hold them to an unfair standard but nothing they have made since Hyouka has really clicked with me.
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka is actually the first show I thought of that looks pretty good, should be pretty good, but was just not enjoyable for me. I guess it was too slow.

I have been enjoying Amagi Brilliant Park though.
>> ARTICLE
It was definitely a show that went at its own pace.

Glad to hear Amagi is good though, I have been meaning to try it out but haven't gotten around to watching it yet. 
>> ARTICLE
Serial Experiments Lain.

Though I feel I'll like it better a second time through when I have a better idea of what exactly is going on.
>> ARTICLE
Serial Experiments Lain is my favorite show. Of all time. Not by a long shot, but by a good margin.

I do NOT enjoy marathoning that show. Even watching it is a drag sometimes. I enjoy it as a piece of art. I enjoy how it packs so much stuff into a 13 episode show and that fact that even the writers of the show don't agree on what it was about.

I don't want to go into a huge rant because it'll probably happen if I don't check myself. But Lain isn't necessarily enjoyable to watch even if it's your favorite show. It's a very curious and strange thing though which is why it's my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK. People said it was great, I watched it and thought 'I think I get why people liked it' but I personally didn't and could have lived without it. Sorry NHK fans.
>> ARTICLE
No need to apologize for not liking a show. What parts of NHK didn't click for you? I know some people found the dark tones and depressing themes to be difficult to enjoy. Other people just prefer action and fantasy over human drama. 
>> ARTICLE
The biggest thing was the characters. I just didn't find them likeable. People probably found it funny or distressing when they saw Sato suffering in his day-to-day life, but it just bored me. I found Misaki annoying as she didn't really help. The most interesting character I found to be Sato's senpai, as I could really pick up on her feelings and she really brought out a lot in Sato too. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I'm the opposite. I loved satou (and his neighbor) but his senpai was by far the most boring and useless character to me. 

I'm still not sure why she was even in the show. With the exclusion of the island arc, every time she showed up absolutely nothing happened. 
>> ARTICLE
I really liked Misaki's character, but I'm always surprised by how many people misinterpret her character. She's nearly as flawed and broken (intentionally) as Sato, but many fans regard her as some sort of angelic saint when she was never intended to be so. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't the whole point that she is even more flawed, lost, and hopeless than Sato? 
>> ARTICLE
That is the point, but many fans of the show don't recognize that, and instead see her as Sato's benevolent saviour. I think part of that is due to the anime emphasizing that part of her character to a much lesser extent than the original story. It's still there, though.
>> ARTICLE
The main reason I did like the show, was that I was going through severe depression at the time. And it kind of gave me a type of hope to keep moving forward, no matter how bad things were. If it weren't for that I probably would have never finished it.

Hellsing Ultimate 
Everything is good except story. It and the fat nazi guy are suck.

Monogatari - Got some nice production values, some of the story is interesting (but not nearly to the level people here make it to be,) a few characters are cool like Shinobu, Kanbaru, and Black Hanekawa, but overall I felt it fell a bit flat. Got really boring Not bad, pretty good just not amazing. But I still don't consider it that good. The story got pretty boring at times, there's plenty of aspects I dislike  (such as the sexual harassment of Hajikuji,) but the animation was really cool (but a bit offputting at times with the constant swaps,) same with the OST. A few characters too kept me watching (Shinobu, Black Hane, and Kanbaru since I hated Senjou and white Hanekawa.) 

But I still stand by my statement that people overrate it quite a bit.

Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, it seemed like a pubstomp and too much  plot armor for 3/4 of the series.

Tokyo Ghoul. As a stand alone the anime wasn't terrible, the censorship was bad and it wrecked the original story but it was still ok to watch. All my friends I showed it too enjoyed it but since I read the manga first (I hate to be that guy but the OG story is way better) it just wasn't good enough.

Anohona(the flower we saw that day) 

It was very beautiful, i personally loved the opening and ending theme. But, damn if it just wasn't so cute i wouldn't of watched it. The story line to begin with was just petty and uninteresting. I despised practically all the characters( save 2). And all the drama was just.. Unnecessary. 

I also want to say amnesia for another one. BEAUTIFULY ANIMATED amd very colorful. But that was it.. It was so dry and boring!! The main character Having a new bf everyday and being totally clueless about EVERYTHING. Ughh and that ending.  Never has an anime disappointed me so much in my life. Only reason i finished it was to see the ending and find out why things were happening as they did.. Wish i didn't. 
>> ARTICLE
While I loved the Jonathan and Joseph arcs, JJBA: Stardust Crusaders was way too repetitive, the only good thing about it was that it kept up the art and animation quality from the previous season. I could probably have just watched the first couple episodes to get the premise, skip to the last episode, and not miss anything important to the plot. Still worth watching just for the art but its definitely the worst cour in my book.

Clannad and JoJo. 

Clannad - I just couldn't find a reason to like Nagisa.

JoJo - Didn't think it was funny so it became a drag pretty quickly.

Attack on titan, I know it's good, and somewhat innovative,  but I really thought it was a meh? Show for me*just my opinion* and I hated the fact that the MC can just turn into a fucking giant whenever he pleases (made me think of naruto (not a good thing))
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari. I agree that is gorgeously animated, the art on it is great and all.

But I just can't enjoy it. I tried, heck, I even forced myself to keep watching. People told me that I'd love after episode 12. I watched until it and no, it's not for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate

Really despised that big eyebrows girl at first, then disappointed with the fact that the anime's plot got centered around her. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd have to go with FLCL. The art style was fine, the music never bothered me, but that story though. I still don't know what in the world was going on after watching it twice and trying to talk it out with several people. I realize that it's supposed to be a metaphor for growing up or puberty or whatever, but I like my subtlety within the range of human perception.
>> ARTICLE
Stein's Gate. 

When I finished it. I thought. Solid show. 9/10.

I see why people like it.

Next. 
>> ARTICLE
Currently at episode 10, waiting foe the hook to catch me..... I mean, it is good, but no real urge to watch yet (other than about a million people recommending it, so I feel that has a little credence).
>> ARTICLE
You gave a show you didn't like all that much a 9/10?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It was a solid and really good show. I have no problem seeing why people give out 9s and 10s.

I just didn't like it that much.

On the other hand. There are shows I really like like Naruto but it's not that good of a show.
>> ARTICLE
I appreciate the objectivity, but I feel like you may not fully comprehend the rating system.
>> ARTICLE
The rating system isn't based on how much I like it. It is based on how good the show was
>> ARTICLE
You would need to be quite the conceded person to think you have the ability to objectively judge a show.
>> ARTICLE
> how good the show was

Which is a subjective opinion...there's no such thing as "objectively" rating an anime (or most any other entertainment media forms).

Seeing why OTHER people like a show is different than enjoying the show yourself, which should be reflected in your rating scores. At least, that's the way I see it.
>> ARTICLE
Can't we all agree that everyone rates shows on a different basis so we could get over all the disscussions about this
>> ARTICLE
Can't we all agree to abandon simple numbers as a ranking system !
Death to scores :P

I mean I see the general use of them, but people care more about them than they are worth imho. You can never really indicate the worth of a show by a simple 1 out of 10 number imho. 
>> ARTICLE
I've to say that numbers are a bad way of indicating if you like a show or not, but I guess they're there so everyone has a chance to show what they liked and disliked. Not everyone has time to write reviews for everything they watch, but still want a log of what they've watched.

Though IMO reviewers should skip scores, I know why they're using them. Scores brings some "easy clicks" so to say, basically people who just press the review and determine if it was good or not based on the score, but it's harmfull and you only really know someones opinion on something after he/she has expressed their feelings about it to you.
>> ARTICLE
Bakemonogatari series. I have watched the first season and second seasons. But after that I just couldn't maintain my interest in the amount of dialogue. Although the premise is good and I like the characters I just can't read that much while understanding all of it and watching the visuals which are very appealing. I got lost at some point and got to bored to continue.

Bebop.

TTGL.

Champloo.

Kill la Kill.

Mushishi.
>> ARTICLE
> TTGL

> Kill la Kill

I'm actually a fan of KLK but not TTGL and I'm not sure I can put my finger on why. Perhaps I didn't give TTGL time to "get good" since I stopped after episode 3, but it just felt very cheesy over-the-top instead of insightful over-the-top like KLK is. Maybe it's because it was made earlier, but yeah I'm not a fan.
>> ARTICLE
If you like KlK, give Gurren Lagann like 10 episodes before you drop it.
>> ARTICLE
It's the exact opposite for me. I found klk tried too hard to be cheesy with not enough substance to back it, and worst of all, so mindnumbingly safe and repetitive in its storytelling; while I was simply surprised by how daring TTGL was and how much its story was willing to evolve. 

Having watched both to the end I urge you to reconsider watching TTGL.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed completely. KLK never had any real substance IMO. It could be fun and energetic but I really don't see how people could possibly call it insightful. TTGL on the other hand feels like it has actual meaning to it (that is the point of the show). 

I guess it's just that KLK feels like a crazy over the top show with some pseudo meaning tacked on whereas TTGL feels like the point of the show is to build something crazy and ridiculous around it's base ideas.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you on this, completely. After the overwhelming hype of TTGL, I expected to have the time of my life watching it. Lo and behold... I wasn't too impressed. I watched Kill la Kill right before TTGL, and I think that might be why. Kill la Kill has so much energy and hype to it, something that TTGL strives for but misses the mark. In comparison to KLK, it's pretty dull. I didn't enjoy TTGL's soundtrack at all, and thought the escalating fights weren't very interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I personally don't like this argument, but it is so true for TTGL. 

It is a standard cheesy anime for the beginning. You can say that it is just the set up for later on the show, or that they didn't find their niche at first. The real measure of the show is about episode 9/11-Ish. 

Heck, remember the short 20 second flashback at the very beginning of the show? That was the planned ending, but it changed so much in production, that part makes no sense.
>> ARTICLE
I watched TTGL without any expectations, and I found it very... generic. The plot was very simple and straightforward: Get bigger and bigger robots to fight bigger and bigger enemies. The drill jokes were funny at first, but after hearing them for the 10th time, they got kinda repetitive. The whole thing felt like the most generic shounen possible, complete with its fair share of unnecessary fanservice to attract their target genre. 
>> ARTICLE
That's why I hated it too. The whole "WIN WITH MANLINESS!" shtick got old VERY fast for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe because I saw that idea as more of a joke than a super serious plot, my feeling was that there's so many times you can run a joke before it gets stale. Take World Trigger for example; there's so many times I can see that 3 face before I get fucking annoyed by it.
>> ARTICLE
Well it was meant as more of a super ridiculous "joke" type of thing, I just hated it. 
>> ARTICLE
Try picking TTGL up again. I stopped watching it after the 4th Episode and didn't continue for several months, because normally i don't like mechas. Then someone convinced me to finish it and in the end TTGL was really beautiful and glorious. :D
>> ARTICLE
I second Mushishi, I can really see why people love it and I wanted to love it too but honestly almost every ep I was falling asleep and this was at like 3pm. Maybe its my fault for marathon-ing it but that's how I watch stuff.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed TTGL and KLK, but I found them pretty lightweight in terms of story and characters. There's nothing wrong with that, and both those shows made up for it in other areas, such as their stylish art design, humour, etc. 
>> ARTICLE
cant see it for guren lagan, thats pretty heavy on both. Maybe not as complicated as you want it to be but it tells a continous, grand story with lots of characters, though many are background there is also a ton of character growth.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi is definitely not for everbody, and extremely slow paced show, with little to no focus on the main character himself. I love the show because I like the style; but the show has no merit for people who have differing opinions.
>> ARTICLE
im with you on a-lot of those.

TTGL, Kill la Kill, tried getting into them and i just couldnt..

Mushihi, basically the same deal-but the pacing just seemed far too slow for my taste. 
>> ARTICLE
What bugs you about Bebop? Is it the episodic format?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah pretty much. I could ignore it if they hadn't introduced Vicious as this super interesting villain in episode 5. I was basically impatiently waiting for him or something closely related to be the conflict again. It felt cheap more than anything to be when they had this big conflict with Vicious at the end after barely utilizing or fleshing him out.

Basically I would prefer Watanabe not pretend his shows have a strong central plot and just be episodic. That's one thing Mushishi does right even if I don't care for it.
>> ARTICLE
You know, I was going to argue with you on this, because Bebop is by far one of my favorite animes of all time, but I actually agree with you 100%- It would have been better either going full episodic or going full story based.

It didn't ruin me to the show (obviously), but I can certainly see where that complaints comes from, and unlike a lot of times when I come here, I can't offer a rebuttal- It really would have been better one way or another.

That's fair. I disagree with you but, still, that's a good point.

Ergo Proxy had this really interesting  setting and characters, but it got too confusing and random towards the end for me to really enjoy it. I mean sometimes it was interesting and developed the setting and characters, but other times it didn't really affect the story at all.



FLCL had gorgeous visuals and music, and guitars make the best weapons, but I think it's pacing was too fast for me to take in all the details and the meaning of it.

Regarding FLCL: watch it again. It isn't a show that can be made sense of in one viewing.

Bakemonogatari and the Monogatari series in general.

I started watching the series because it had some very impressive visuals and it sure did deliver, unfortunately I feel the rest of the show failed to deliver. The overall weakness of the anime shows just how good of a studio Shaft is to be able gloss over the weaknesses and present a successful product.

The characters are unlikable and entirely inconsistent. It feels like the characters are just parodies of the modern anime archetypes, but they seemed to be loved and treated as the real thing when people talk about them.

The show is dialogue heavy but says almost nothing of importance. Most of the dialogue provides excessive characterizations to characters I don't care for. The dialogue that actually covers philosophical ideas provides only the most rudimentary arguments. The ideas themselves are worth talking about, but the anime doesn't say anything worthwhile. The Monogatari series also seems to believe that if something can said once, then it might as well be said three more times. Thankfully I can just turn my brain off and enjoy the pretty colors.
>> ARTICLE
The first time I watched it I felt like I was watching something a hipster came up with but after re-watching. With a better idea of what I was getting into I came to love the series I love the fact that the characters all have "fatal flaws" this makes them seem more human than character in my opinion. I like how the story has been told and good god can the show make you feel some emotions. Episode 15 of bake about 2 min in there is a small clip that kills me every time I see it.
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching select episodes from the whole series and [Minor Nisemonogatari Spoilers] (/s "When Arararararagi reads the text message and immediately breaks out of the handcuffs made me yell at the screen. It shows that the whole time he was fine with being chained up but he wasn't going to let even Senjougahara keep him from helping someone.")
>> ARTICLE
That scene kills everyone. Easily one of the top five scenes in anime.
>> ARTICLE
So how do you think it's technically good? You seem to have no idea why it would be liked at all.
>> ARTICLE
No anime does a better job at fusing visuals, audio and story. The visuals you see respond to the dialogue, act upon it, then expand it. The big reveals that happens during each story arc feels so dramatic and impressive. The entire effect can make a conversation about nothing feel so important and entertaining. The scenes are impeccably constructed and the overall directing is amazing. The Monogatari series cements Shaft as the most capable anime studio at the moment in my opinion. The Monogatari series is a hit and deserves to be so, but the visuals and directing covers the inherent weaknesses in the anime, but those weakness are covered. I just feel that the anime is completely unsubstantial when you take a deeper bite into it, save for cinematography.

Just out of curiosity, do you mind explaining what you mean when you say characters are "inconsistent"? That's not something I've heard before.

Toradora. I can sort of see why people like the interactions between characters and the visuals and the OP, but honestly, I just didn't find myself laughing at the comedy too much (though that shower scene) and I can understand people come to like Taiga and Ryuji's personalities but I just couldn't really feel for the characters save for a couple of episodes.

I still need to finish it but Katanagatari, not a big fan of the art style but the show looks and sounds good but the plot and the characters are dull and the dialogue and length is just bloated to me. Each episode is 50 minutes long and they don't feel like they really utilize that time well, tons of name dropping and for the most part pointless conversations go on. Some might say it's for world building and character development but I don't think it needs to be so long to do that and I never found the dialogue engaging, same goes for the characters. One is a nagging, controlling, useless girl who bosses her OP warrior slave around and that OP MC is just a good guy who is down to do whatever which allows him to incorporate his OP fighting abilities into the plot however the creators like. Also the way the plot is setup you pretty much know how things are going to go, they're going to fight a person and collect a sword every episode and he will win, takes away from any suspense and when nothing else about the show is engaging you don't have much else to be entertained by.

Baccano.
I loved the individual stories, but the ways it jumped from story to story was just incredibly disorienting for me.
>> ARTICLE
SnK, no doubt. It's good, animation was fantastic, good characters, etc. but there's so many better shows out there. I'm surprised that people obsess over it rather than other very popular anime. I liked it, but I didn't absolutely love it.

Sasami-San. It's so beautiful, but I really dislike the story and characters and think it's a waste of potential.

I tried getting into Darker than Black (1st season) but I just couldn't feel it. I liked the whole idea of having superhumans masquerading as normal citizens and the fight scenes were great, but the execution seemed off at times and I couldn't really bring myself to like any of the characters in particular. The episodic nature of most of the series is probably what irked me
>> ARTICLE
Ha, I have one that people will hate me for :
Cowboy Bebop.

I would never say it is objectivly bad or something like that, but it just isn't interesting enough for me. There are many shows that just entertain me more. People are always up in arms about how awesome the ost is for example, but I never really noticed anything special in it. The whole thing didn't grab me. I mean Spike is a pretty cool guy and all but still.
>> ARTICLE
This one for me too. I only got through half the episodes because I got so bored with the fact that nothing could ever go the right way by the end of the episode. Would it be so damn bad if they got a good payoff? Man that got annoying. Almost like how some movies will kill a hero just to seem deep. Some people think that if the good guy succeeds, it must be cliche and bad writing.

TTGL. 

I've tried to watch it 3 times now. First time I stopped at episode 7, second I stopped at 5, third I stopped at 4. 

I didn't purposefully stop because I disliked it, it just bored me every time and I started watching something else. 

But I am curious what was up with the beginning...

Fate/Zero. I know it's production quality is unbelievable and the story is a perfect example of the under-used tragedy genre. It is how moral lines are so skewed, especially in Kiristugu, that I just can't stand. I can't hate it for that because is IS tragedy, but I simply disagree with it. I'd take my Vash the Stampede over a Kiristugu every time.
>> ARTICLE
I think the moral lines are explained well around episode 17-18 I believe, my issue with the show is my suspension of disbelief. In the show Archer is just way to powerful, and easily over powers every other character in the series.

This is how I feel with most of the Gundamn series. I went into gundam 00 expecting some awesome action. And While the dialogue is well done I really don't think I enjoyed the series as much as I would have if I went into it expecting it to be expository dialogue and not a fast pace action show.

Gankutsuou. People say its such a great anime. I watched a few episodes, but I like the novel so much. The French Revolution time frame is the best for romance, betrayal, and vengeance. I just can't like this anime. It feels too different.

Cowboy Bebop and Steins Gate.

Toradora. Honestly, I watched this after seeing a good amount of rom-com animes, despite being told that Toradora is a good "introduction" into the genre. Almost everything about the show was solid; humor, relationship building. But I honestly thought that the characters overreacted way to often, and I felt it contrasted the more realistic scenes between the characters of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, **Baccano** was a GREAT piece of work. It was unique, had a large cast of interesting characters, and had a pretty intricate storyline. However, I just didn't like it as much everybody else seemingly does. I didn't really *connect* with any of the characters, and I found it to be somewhat slow due to the lack of explanation up until the last few episodes. I can tell that Baccano is definitely quality though.

I can tell why people love Death Note, but it really never appealed to me.
>> ARTICLE
Death Note. I know that it's a well-written show, with epic mind games and a brilliant rivalry, but it's just not for me. The whole cat and mouse game between Light and L I found to be underwhelming, and just made the show feel like a standard murder mystery, albeit on a much larger scale. In addition, I didn't particularly like either of the main characters. Light came off as an arrogant self-serving prick, and L was just too weird. Being eccentric is one thing, but when you permanently look like a basement-dwelling shut-in who can't even sit in a chair properly, it's just a little bit ridiculous.

Kyousogiga. It's really pretty, and it looks like the story might have been good, but I did not enjoy trying to piece everything together. 

Katanagatari. I don't think that this is bad, the action scenes were passable and the story might have been interesting at the end, the only problem is that its a dialogue heavy anime and I didn't really like any of the characters, particularly the main duo.

AnoHana 

I was disinterested up until halfway through when I dropped it

Angel Beats. 

Aesthetically, it's really good: Visually nice, very nice music, and plays with a variety of emotions. However, the premise of the story really bugged me. I always felt as if something was missing but no one seems to notice or care. Also the pacing makes the show feel really rushed. 

Maybe I'm just giving it too much flak with the reputation compared to other shows from the same guys like Clannad, but I really feel like Angel Beats was decent but not enough to be great.
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats, it has everything a good show needs but, I just didnt care for it that much.
>> ARTICLE
Got a list of anime that fits this for me.

**Shin Sekai Yori**
 Haven't finished this but the whole man people thing killed it for me 
I will probably finish this sometime but its really drawn out, not boring. The creepy and mystery parts are done excellently though. The music is great other than the shitty ending. God do I hate the ending.

**Cowboy Bebop**

 Its good but the overarching story is garbage.

**FMA& FMA B**
 I hate the first FMA the second one is MUCH better but it still suffers from being downright boring at times. Ost is good if you discount the OPs. I have a love hate relationship with anime music.

I also don't like the premise of souls at all. Ruins an anime for me. I prefer the materialistic view on life. That sort of ruins the anime though...

**Sword Art Online**

This should have been good. There was no reason they couldn't have made this good. Instead we just get crap. I mean the real affects of a full dive machine would be waaay higher than just using it for games.
It also spawned garbage like Log Horizon which was so goddamn boring, great op though.

**Kill La Kill**

This had good potential but went nowhere with the plot. The fanservice didn't bother me at all. At times that was the best thing about the show. Since I watch anime for the story and not for fancy art, a great deal of anime annoys me.  

>> ARTICLE
You didn't understand the question. What is technically good although you didn't like it? The only thing I see you doing here is saying Bebop is bad, SAO is bad, KLK is bad...

And you must be the first to dislike the ED of SSY, it even won the (lol) contest here. There are 2 ED's as well. And if you could't handly that stuff in SSY you shouldn't watch it really. Although I have the feeling you don't understand some stuff. You need to watch it fully to even comment on it properly imo.

Hellsing Ultimate, Angel Beats, Zankyou no Terror, Hellsing Ultimate, Kill La Kill, Hellsing Ultimate, Haruhi Suzumiya, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Hellsing Ultimate, Samurai Champloo...oh and did I mentioned Hellsing Ultimate? 

I know that it has reasons why it is in the Top50 of MAL. It looks good, has a nice Soundtrack and some great characters. But beside the completely stupid story there is 24/7 blood on screen. It's not that I fear it, it just bored me. The gore or horror anime that really makes me shiver doesn't exist. I'm really likely to cry in every romance or drama anime, but this way anime just doesn't get me. In the end I watched the last 4 episodes with 1,5x speed on YouTube because I just wanted to finish it fast...

Code Geass, of course has a good concept, but the animation is so atrocious I will never take that show seriously.

Yeh, that's just your bad of not accepting the animation. The show is how it is, with that animation, if you like it or not.
>> ARTICLE
**Katanagatari.** The dialogue is often banal (yes, I get that excessive dialogue is Nisio Isin's thing, but it works better in Monogatari than Katanagatari), the characters were *mostly* bland and flat (and the ones who weren't are killed off by those that were), a lot of various things occur that make little sense, and the action scenes range from being alright to downright awful - I couldn't stop laughing at how bad the climactic fight in the last episode was. That being said, it was beautifully drawn, well animated, well-directed (besides some of the fight scenes), and it had a great OST.

**Sword of the Stranger** is also worth mentioning, because it is like the polar opposite of Katanagatari - it has excellent fight scenes, but the rest of the movie is pretty average. The story is average, the Chinese super-soldier villains were comical, and the most interesting characters - Shougen Itadori and Jurota Inui - were side characters. It felt like a kids movie that is way too violent to be a kids movie. Once again, though, the animation, art, and direction was superb.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama. I really don't like how it has no overall story. I gave the first 5 episodes a shot, but I just don't like shows that don't have a good long story. I see that the humor is amazing and I love seeing gifs for it, but still can't get into it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh cmon guys. There is a difference between liking and scoring a show. All these "I gave it a 6 because this or that" is just stupid and making excuses. If a show is good, then rate it accordingly to that, even if you didn't like it because it didn't click for example.

Also is it that hard to make your brain think objectively? Just remove the hype for a second, remove everything you've heard about it for a second and then think when you rate or, even better, watch the show. It's the critical brain you need these days, here and everywhere in real life. That's how communities and societies could become better.

Ofcourse you should still have your feelings about a show, but imo if you could just do the "objectively thinking thing" for a second then you would be a great addition to the community. Otherwise, not really, because you should give newcomers and people who haven't watched a certain show a correct view on everything.

And that concludes this little rant. Just got annoyed by all the excuses  in these posts here.

***The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya***. I recognize that it's very well made, but the whole point of it all just goes over my head. I find it rather forgettable, which is unusual considering its ridiculous popularity.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps I just have an unusually hard time separating my subjective opinion about anime from my thoughts as to their objective value, but of all the anime I've watched I can't think of anything that I think is objectively good, that I didn't enjoy.

While I suppose there are some anime such as Texhnolyze, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Serial Experiments Lain, The Tatami Galaxy, Princess Tutu and Neon Genesis Evangelion in which how good the I think the anime are holistically and how much I find myself enjoying a given **episode on average** are significantly different. But even then that discrepancy can be chocked up to objective criticisms of the shows' storytelling methodologies (such as pacing, exposition and repetition) as opposed to my subjective inability to appreciate them.

The Haruhi Suzumiya Series. The only thing I would consider as a master piece in that series is probably the Movie. Other than that, the series is probably sub-par for me. Typical high school slice of life with a couple out of this world characters, other than that, there's nothing different. It's just magic and Haruhi being a bitch all the time.

A couple series I'd like to also add is Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control, and Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?.
>> ARTICLE
The reason most people regard Haruhi so highly is in fact because of the movie.
>> ARTICLE
**Fate/Zero**. There was very little character development throughout the series, but the characterization was solid, the fights did not interest me in any way other than visually, and a lot of the time it felt like a really boring lecture about things I didn't care about. I'm not really interested in the universe.

**Fate/Stay Night** has felt like a lot of the same so far, besides the prologue episode.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, the post asked for anime you thought were good in technicalities, and yet didn't enjoy them. You just said that Fate *isn't* good at technicalities, and *therefore* didn't enjoy it.

Nonetheless, from what you've said about Fate/Zero, I feel like we've watched two very different series. I'm not going to spoil anything for UBW watchers but F/Z has some of the most convincing character development I've seen in anime, especially for the really big, important characters. Sure, Caster and Lancer - and their respective masters - didn't get too, too much attention, but that's what freed up the space for so much more development for the protagonist (*two* flashback episodes, let us remind ourselves), antagonist and some very, very memorable side-characters. ^This ^is ^hard ^to ^sound ^convincing ^without ^spoilers ^everywhere...

As for "the fights did not interest me in any way other than in visuals"... I mean, what did you expect? That's what fight scenes in visual media are for: the choreography, use of camera, the blood-pumping moment when you *see* all of the build-up in the previous episodes climax to a physical resolution; that's what the fight scenes are all about. So revel in ufotable's fight scenes, because there will be very few chances to see something so glorious again.
>> ARTICLE
Well I thought it was fantastic in visuals and in sound, and the writing was pretty good in story and themes, but I wasn't interested in the content. So, yes, I'd say it was good technically.

The only one who I thought was well developed was Waver. The other characters were almost completely static besides [](/s "Kiritsugu"), and that was only because of (to me) uninteresting and out of place flash back episodes, [](/s "Kirei") near the end, and, if I remember correctly, Kariya. I agree that characters like Rider were memorable, but few ever changed in a significant way or enough for me to care.

Fights are also about investment in the characters and some kind of emotional weight/impact of the outcome, none of which I ever felt. Sure, the fights looked great, but most of them felt emotionless and shallow. I'd attribute this to me just not being interested in the universe as I felt the same about Kara no Kyoukai.

togame just says "I have no emotions" which didn't make sense to me, she didn't act like she had no emotions ever and shichika has no motivation for his actions and i don't understand why these people are doing what their doing.

I haven't watched it in awhile I just remember being really mad at the last episode. The fights were cool, just didn't like the characters.
>> ARTICLE
[pretty major spoilers](/s "IIRC she says this because she knows she is going to die and is trying to make shichika hate her before she does so, so he doesn't kill himself. She says doesn't believe that shichika could kill the sword saints or what ever there called. schichika obviously doesn't listen to her, and through the want of revenge kills everybody; he can do this because he actually is strong enough to defeat them all.")

**Fate/Zero**. It is a very good show, from a technical stand-point (I mean, those visuals...). But it's boring as boring can be. I had to force myself to watch it most of the time.

Did you understand it? Are anime with lots of dialogues something for you? These are questions you need to ask yourself when that is your opinion. There could be something in your unconsciousness making it boring for you.

I understood pretty much everything and I tend to like anime with a lot of dialogue, or at least I don't mind if the dialogue is interesting. I can't really pinpoint why this show was such a chore to watch for me after a year and a half. It's just... it seems like they tried to force all these ideologies clashes as the main theme of the show but failed since there clearly is someone to root for, and since there isn't a lot of fighting, the show is just... there. I start to not care about it anymore. There were some very good moments, but overall I can't really say it was very enjoyable.

Cowboy Bebop, no question: The OST is freaking amazing (probably my favorite) and the visuals are great, but I was not a big fan of the episodic format (I wish the rest of the show was more like the final two episodes, which were really good) and I never really got attached to the characters at all.

I'd say Evangelion.

I see its quality, and I get why it's popular and influential and all that, but I guess I just can't get into shows that are so deliberate in being as depressing as possible. At least, that's how the show feels to me. Knowing the nature of the guy who made it, that all makes a lot of sense, but that doesn't mean I have to love it.  
>> ARTICLE
The show is actually pretty generic IMO, I only like the show and believe it's something any anime fan should watch because the cluster fuck that is the last 3 episodes, the end of evangellion, and the rebuilds. It really seemed like they ran out of budget and said fuck it, time to do something insane. Then they didn't like what they did and proceeded to make 3 (4?) movies trying to correct it.
>> ARTICLE
I think its wrong to call Evangelion generic. For its time it was mindblowingly different. The reason it seems generic today is because it had such a great effect on anime as a medium that you have seen most of it in other anime made after Eva.
>> ARTICLE
maybe watch the last 3 episodes and realize the whole point of the entire show is that maybe you can learn to love yourself. it is a lovely message.
>> ARTICLE
Heh, that may be. But lets face it, the last couple episodes are rather incomprehensible at first. First impressions are important. 

On the other hand, I think End of Evangelion may have retroactively affected my opinion of the whole series, lol. Again, not for being bad, but just wtf.
>> ARTICLE
nah, they aren't. fairly simply, without any knowledge, it's easy to connect the dots. everything (even the animation) goes away. and then the narration tells you everything goes away. at that point it should be fairly easy to assume that nothing is there but people don't want to accept that.

but in its own ingenious way, i guess that's the point of the show -- that people cannot just accept the way things are -- even for their own sake.

i almost didn't watch them in order (watching EoE first) because of the internet. I'm glad i did, though, because it's fairly obvious EoE was just action and visuals so people would be quiet.

He always talks fast, and I think it is just another one of the quirks of the anime. That said, most of his dialogue will be easier to follow later on. Without spoiling anything, you grow used to it and his talking patterns become...familiar.

Just as a heads up about the speed of the narration, the novel that The Tatami Galaxy is based off of is written as a first person stream-of-consciousness so the fast narration is meant to mimic this.  I only found the first episode to be really fast.

*Bokutachi no genzai wooooo*

Welcome one and all, to the *Yojouhan Shinwa Takei*, or **The Tatami Galaxy** re-watch!

I will be... well, not your host, since that's /u/BlindPiratez, to whom I'm very grateful already for organizing this, but I will be... the free entertainment, I guess? Not my best analogy. Anyway, I'll be doing some write-ups for this re-watch. How could I not? This show is the reason for this account, my first post was about this show and my username is even named accordingly. In short, this show is where my history here began as well as why, so like our old fortune teller says, this is an opportunity dangling in front of me that I must not miss.

And it's not like I'll be grasping at straws here: the show may only be a meagre 11 episodes long, it is far, far from the shallow cookie cutter shows that clutter the anime calendar each year. Since there is so much to discuss and only so much time, I'll try to focus on one particular aspect of the show in each write-up, as a simple summary of each episode would be inadequate: in fact, it would be a colossal misjudgment of what makes this show such a masterpiece in the eyes of many. 

But for all of the aspects that deserve praise (and believe me, I will do just that), there is one thing that lies at the absolute core of what makes this show so good: intent. Every *single* thing, each and every one, belies intent and is a deliberate choice made in order to enhance the narrative. Absolutely everything you see and hear, and even those you don't, has been taken into consideration and used to fit the narrative of the show and convey its message. For everything that Tatami Galaxy does well, it's that incredible level of attention and thoughtfulness that elevates it above everything else.

Anyway, enough of that, let's dive in! The first episode can be described by a lot of things and not all of them positive, but chief among these applicable words would be... confusing. First watchers, fear not, for things will become a little clearer as the show goes on. But considering this confusing start, any focus on thematic elements, plot, characters and more will be lacking at best and meaningless at worst.

However, this does not mean that there is nothing to discuss at all. More specifically, there are two things we are immediately confronted with and immersed in. First we have our gatling gun narration: it will take some getting used to for first watchers I'm sure, but there is a reason for it, trust me. I'll get back on this one tomorrow.

The other thing that immediately grabs our attention and absolutely deserves it, is the art style.

I think it's safe to say that The Tatami Galaxy has a fairly unique art style. I could just leave it at that, but that wouldn't be very interesting now, would it? Unique does not cover it, though. It's more than that: you can see that this particular style has been chosen specifically to fit the narrative.

The most important reason for that is revealed within the first few moments. Our as of yet unnamed figure eating with our as of yet unnamed protagonist looks... weird. He looks somehow not entirely human: huge chin, tiny eyes, slightly puffy cheeks and traditional wear that makes him look somewhat of a slob. Of course, there's the whole confusing matchmaking god part, so that could explain things. But soon after we see Ozu and he looks equally strange: predatory eyes, onion-shaped hair, elven ears and a mouth that makes him look like a leech. 

That's where it all clicks: they both look not like a human being, but like a caricature of one, stemming from an exaggerated description given by a person telling a story. In short, we are viewing everything from the mind of Watashi, who is an unreliable narrator, another similarity to /r/anime 's favorite spooky Shaft harem. Another nice example it that he looks blocky when interacting with Akashi at the end of the episode: it's because he is acting wooden and he knows it. The explanation is simple, but the effects are quite astounding. Both Ozu and our unnamed 'matchmaking god' have been given a personality without the show having to focus on them for a second. Visual storytelling at its finest.

Speaking of visual storytelling, the first episode already has too many examples to count. Our mile-a-minute narration can be overwhelming, telling us everything Watashi thinks, as the show clearly wants us to *be* him and crawl into his mind. But we don't just hear all of his thoughts, we see them as well. The examples are already in the double digits, but some of my favorites are:

- Watashi cutting the red strings of fate in a grim reaper (or Black Cupid) outfit
- Wispy alluring smoke from the fortune teller
- Watashi in the palm of a giant, glowing Ozu
- Watashi dropping from the string into an angry mob

All of this demands a lot from the animation, which is why the style is so important. It's not as detailed and clean as the animation we usually see, but that allows it to adapt to all of the mental imagery popping up in Watashi's mind without demanding a skyscraping budget. On the other hand, we're not sacrificing aesthetics either. The show is still capable of [moments of stunning beauty](http://imgur.com/P8VyJjr,X9jf0BX,xdhU0rt) within this style, by cleverly using lighting and colour to its advantage, even inserting real life footage seemlessly through these techniques.

The choice of style of this show is not just a budget constraint, nor is it just 'being artsy'. It's a conscious decision that makes the most out of all the constraints, requirements and opportunities both in the show and outside of it.

It's a masterstroke... and it's not the only one.

I liked this so much in the episode. I think it is the fact that the rest of the animation is done so cheaply (as u said) that makes stuff like this really **POP** off the screen.

yakushimaru etsuko, she's done other anime OPs/EDs if you want to check them out. Arakawa under the bridge, mawaru penguindrum, denpa onna to seishun otoko, but they really knocked it out of the park with tatami galaxy. Combined with the surrealism of the episodes, I would find myself entranced after each episode lost in thought while trying to process what I just watched. It just fit so well.

First-timer stream-of-consciousness impressions/reactions:

&nbsp;

Artstyle, super-fast talk, has "galaxy" in the name but isn't in space... well this is DEFINITELY not what I expected. Not that I was REALLY expecting a show about rice straw space robots...

Say it four times fast? I can't even say it once!

It's a good thing this re-watch will be one episode at a time. This fast-talk/fast-subtitle-reading is mentally exhausting. You would think after 6 seasons of Teekyuu I'd be okay with this, wouldn't you?!

"Raven-haired maiden"? Isn't everybody (well, 90% anyway) raven-haired in Japan?

It is decided. [Akashi is designing props and stage effects for Birdman](http://i.imgur.com/oVEp99H.png), the oscar-winning Hollywood movie, which comes out 4 years after this show aired. I am going to try and believe that this is canon until the end.

Ouch, bottle rocket straight to the back. Walk it off MC!

So Japanese college is exactly like Japanese High School, what with everything being clubs, cake and tea, yes?

The tennis ball prank would never really work, but it's genius nonetheless.

[This lady knows what's up!](http://i.imgur.com/ecKREWc.png) Finally, someone who talks normally!

Clearly [this is the whole effects department of Birdman](http://i.imgur.com/LRC6YB4.jpg), celebrating that they just completed making Birdman's robotic wings today.

[Uh, what?](http://i.imgur.com/5MOnz1g.jpg)

[Ah, the beautiful face of an angel!](http://i.imgur.com/NNRTHGg.jpg)

If you've dedicated YEARS to sabotaging couples, don't believe you deserve a relationship yourself, and yet the very thought of your friend and a girl you sort of know going out [makes you eat a whole cake by yourself](http://i.imgur.com/vFYeHmr.jpg)... this, good sir, would be a sign that you have a problem.

The art going up the stairs to love god's shack is cool. 

So, who exactly was love god phoning to get Akashi to appear at the right place? Could love god and Ozu be in cahoots? 

[No it wasn't!](http://i.imgur.com/idt7SRS.png) Get the hell back in there!!! This isn't a two-cour show, you don't have time to be that shy!

I really like this Ozu guy! He has diabolical mischief plans AND [he tries to straight-talk the MC](http://i.imgur.com/jq4i9YP.png) into not being a tropey shy romance anime MC!

[Uhh...](http://i.imgur.com/n8nlI1O.jpg) wait Ozu, dial it back a notch.

[I said dial it back!!!](http://i.imgur.com/Phydgqf.jpg)

Ah, the ol' college-days-flash-before-your-eyes-mid-air.

[Leeeeet's dooooo the tiiiime waaaarp agaaaaaaaaaaain!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/M0Dzpaf.jpg)

&nbsp;

Well, I went in with absolutely zero expectations and I am now intrigued. The plot/setup is pretty basic, but the art-style and craziness of some of the interactions makes it engrossing regardless. It also helps a lot that the MC has some backstory and reasoning to why he's bad at (and thinks he's undeserving of) romance/love, unlike most animes that take that part for granted. 

I'm not convinced the super-fast-talk is necessary yet... I'm hoping it will end up being relevant and not just because they didn't have enough budget to animate the show at regular talking speed.

As for that meat after a party line, I think he meant that as farmers/agricultural people, they should be eating vegetables/fruits, not meat. Now, I totally missed why this party was being thrown and who was throwing it, but I guess it has something to do with a harvest, maybe?

**Damn, that episode was gorgeous.**

I actually watched this episode twice. The first time was to follow the rapid dialogue ~~(which I have been told will be much slower in future episodes)~~, while the second watch of the episode was to appreciate the visual storytelling. The vibrant splashes of color enhance the melodrama and emotion. (Just look at Ozu's introduction as the red devil or the "rose-tinted world" of freshman year). On the other hand, the simple, almost bland figure of the protagonist, emphasizes his isolation from the rest of this world. I really appreciated the pairing or art and dialogue, a reaffirmation for my love of animation as a medium.

As for the story, it is pretty clear that our protagonist regrets the last few years. Heartbroken by a raven-haired beauty, he fell to the dark side to become a despised anti-love delinquent. Although there is an opportunity for him to make amends and fall in love with Akashi, he fails and is dragged down to his death by the black thread of fate. Luckily, the deus ex machina kicks in and we got **TIME TRAVEL**. 

So it it looks like our protagonist gets a second chance, or many, but only the rewatchers know. Through these ordeals, the protagonist will gradually change (and hopefully gain some color) and mature like most people his age (of course, its a coming of age story). Though the overarching plot seems obvious, watching the trials and growth is what makes this genre shine. **I can't wait for this wild and extravagant ride.**

I'll end with a quote from the protagonist, "Those are the ones who have lost sight of reality." Pfft, electrical engineers don't understand dramatic irony.

What I love about the premise of this show is that the college life can be suddenly very lonely. Some people can fare well by actively finding and making friends, but not everybody has the social ability to do so. Also, unlike in compulsory and high schools, you don't  share the same circumstances and time spent at school as everyone has their own schedules and passions now.

I feel this show gets that sudden sense of isolation many face when they can't  come to grips with the fact that life is suddenly a lot lonelier and confusing because there are so many possibilities of one's career and personal life. It is a lot simpler when you were in the company of those who shared the same goals and same lifestyles.

#First time watcher

Hello everyone, here are my ramblings so far on the first episode of TTG.   
*N.B. Well, I have already watched the first 2 episodes, woops, I got carried away!*

This show moves at a blistering pace. Not a moment goes by where there is no narration/dialogue. I have some theories already as of episode 1-2 but I'll keep them to myself because I am probably over thinking things.

The main blockade for me, when it came to watching TTG, was the art. I won't lie. I love beautiful art that captivates me and is just.. well.. pretty. Boy was I wrong about TTG though. The art is a beast in its own, abstract way. The animation is smooth as well. Based Madhouse (though I thought it was SHAFT for a tiny bit :s).    
Nonetheless, I feel bad for putting it off for so long just because of the art.

[My bad](#nuidideverythingright)

The comedy is actually pretty on point for me so far as well, I am definitely enjoying this series.   
I believe that 2 years passed in this episode, as it may continue to do for the rest of the series. Skipping through time showing us the main plot points.  

I love Akashis ice-cold temperament.

Hm, if 'they can't be happy, why should anyone else?' -- That's the kind of vibe I am getting here. The 'black-thread' of fate is going to stay in the back of my mind too. I look forward to how they are going to work these beginning ideas later on into the story. (Or am I expecting too much :s)

Akashi is scared of moths, cute.

So Ozu falls 'most likely to his death', and Watashi is thrown off shortly afterward. Time freezes. The clock turns back time, the ED begins and Watashi will be given another shot. [speculation](/s "I expect to see this most episodes from what I have heard (and the extra episode I watched, woops :p). I wonder how they will incorporate this plot-point into the story though.")

Extra thoughts;   
- Don't really like Ozus design aesthetically, but it is fitting of his character.  
- Akashi has a nice character design and voice actor, I like her the most so far.   
- Being a voice actor in this series is suffering.
- The OP and ED (especially the OP) are pretty darn good!

P.S. If anyone replies, I'll check&reply tomorrow. It's 3AM and I'm peacin' out :p
>> ARTICLE
> Akashi has a nice character design and voice actor, I like her the most so far.

Yep, she's voiced by [Sakamoto Maaya](http://myanimelist.net/people/90/Maaya_Sakamoto) who is awesome. Might know her as Haruhi from Ouran Host Club or Shiki from Kara no Kyoukai or many other roles.
>> ARTICLE
Dude, the guy behind this show's art is none other than [Masaaki Yuasa](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2xdrzs/director_spotlight_masaaki_yuasa/), who's behind such great(or at least interesting) shows as Mind Game and Ping Pong The Animation. He never fails to impress me with his works and so far, I've loved 3/3 of his shows. 

Also, the show is a bit slow at start (I know, haha), but the start is necessary for the later parts to have enough impact, so I advise you to be patient. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, my friend filled me in on that! I love Ping Pong TA, I look forward to what he does in this series :3

**My first-timer thoughts:**
 
And so we start. I don't know what it was about this first episode but I enjoyed it *immensely*. The art was amazing. So many different colours were used and it looks so different from every other anime I've ever watched. Not only that but the animation was very fluid and I just loved it a lot. And yeah, I had to pause. *A LOT*. The MC talked extremely fast which made it pretty hard to keep up with the subtitles. But I felt like it gave the episode more character and made it a whole lot more unique and enjoyable. I can tell this is the type of show that I'm going to miss out on a lot of details during my first time through so after I go through all your comments and jog my memory I will probably rewatch the episode again.
 
At first, I had no expectations but now I'm *really* excited to start going through these episodes! See y'all tomorrow for episode 2!
>> ARTICLE
Episode 2 is one of my personal favorites. That and the secret organization episode.
>> ARTICLE
Don't pause, unless you can't keep up at all! If you've seen monogatari, it's the same as those short flashcards with excerpts from the novel - you don't necessarily need to read everything. 
>> ARTICLE
Im really liking the unreliable narrator-like vibe so far  it creates a very surreal atmosphere which fits the fast-paced and peculiar narration very well.  Speaking of the dialogue, I thought it was interesting how they made it so fast paced, and it lends the show a frenzied feel which is a pretty accurate representation of what college sometimes feels like (especially accurate was how he ate that cake).

At this point, Im still not sure how supernatural this is going to be, and whether or not everything is the product of an overactive imagination.  Also, the rewinding clock at the end has me intrigued  does it mean that next episode well start over from his freshman year and get a redo as he wished, or is it just another symbol of his dissatisfaction with his current life?

>> ARTICLE
>I thought it was interesting how they made it so fast paced, and it lends the show a frenzied feel which is a pretty accurate representation of what college sometimes feels like (especially accurate was how he ate that cake).

YES. Also some moments seemed to move much slower, making them moments viewers could remember and probably paralleling to how most of them were important memories (nearly every moment between Watashi and Akashi).

>or is it just another symbol of his dissatisfaction with his current life?

How is it a symbol? Could you elaborate?


>> ARTICLE
As in, are we literally rewinding time so mc has a second chance, or does it represent his desire for a second try?  Something like that.
>> ARTICLE
Both? His desire for a second try causes time to rewind because the gods are trying to help him out? I'm a first time watcher, but I hope they make the fantasy aspect of this a bit reasonable!
>> ARTICLE
I already watched the series last month, so I don't have my initial reactions to offer. I also admit I don't fully understand the series so I don't have any analysis to give either. So I'll probably keep my own posts fairly short.

First off, welcome to the unique aesthetic of the show! If the art and speed of exposition are bothering you now: sorry, it's pretty consistent throughout. There's a strange mix of live action with vectors, color palettes are intentionally all over the place, and the narrator rarely slows down.

I love the rewind transition from the end of the episode into the [ending theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IcFDwygw-o) which I find to be hypnotic on its own.

[For the rewatchers](/s "I didn't realize it the first time of course but aside from the few events that give an order to the series (like the fortune teller's prices) there's not much to distinguish this as the first episode since the majority of the characters are reintroduced every time. You could just as easily rotate it to have this be the second, third, or even ninth.")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "That's why I don't like this show. Every episode felt like it was going nowhere. By the 4th cycle I was getting annoyed with how boring each episode was for me. It reminded me of the haruhi endless eight. I was elated when something new happened at like episode 10")
>> ARTICLE
Not rewatching since I watched it twice over the last year, but I think my favorite part of this episode is the [](/s "setup of the red herring.")
>> ARTICLE
>spoiler tag

[spoilers](/s "I saw it that way the first time. Well, more like, I saw it that way when I got to the second episode. I was under the impression, from then on, that the 'first time' was just the 'first example' and that the show really had nothing to do with whatever the stupid synopsis on MAL says about consulting the god of matchmaking and whatever.")

[even bigger spoilers](/s "Judging by the end, I'd say that since they all happened in parallel, there really wasn't any time that was 'different' in a way that should make it the 'first time' unless you count the fortune teller's price. I'm still sure that the 'supernatural' part is some kind of inexplicable phenomenon that's just there for storytelling, and persisted only because the MC was never satisfied outside of the single result at the end.")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "I would say you're mostly right in that most of the episode can be any episode, but the discussion at the ramen cart and the MC's failure during daimonji has to be in the first. The ramen cart sets up the show while leaving the audience clueless and daimonji comes full circle.") Wow, only now after typing this did I realize the MC is nameless.

Same, I never skipped the ending. It's really good. the OP is fantastic as well.
>> ARTICLE
>Finishes episode for first time

What just happened that was amazing

I thought about the episode after the first time and noticed that "Watashi ()" also means "myself" in Japanese, making the viewer experiencing everything in the show through "myself". There are other shows/movies that try to tie the viewer and main character closer by naming the MC "I" or "Watashi", but in Tatami Galaxy's case it's channeling the memories of trying to find oneself while in the whirling rose-petals of the first year of school.

Going on with names, Ozu's name () literally translates to "small saliva" or "small sweat" which...doesn't make much sense other than the second part () usually used in word compounds pertaining to water. It is unknown whether "Ozu" is a surname or not. Akashi, on the other hand, is an actual surname, therefore finding a meaning behind a surname would be dumb. Just for fun though, Akashi () literally translates to "bright stone".

I really like how the show doesn't seem to follow a chronological timeline. It'll be interesting to see what they do since he probably gets a second chance now? 

At the very beginning when Watashi narrates the location of the shrine between the two rivers and the shape looks like that one area between those kinds of thighs and then there was a sound that perfectly went with everyone's thoughts (   )

I also really like how there is a significant difference in the speed of the dialogue/scenes whenever Akashi shows up or something fairly important/different/weird seems to happen. That being said, there are other scenes that are equally important but also zoom by at the speed of college ending, such as Watashi's talk with the "god".

Also, when Watashi catches Ozu with some girl and stuffs a mushroom in his face and Ozu says "Force feeding me such a bundle of fungi? What is up with these ribbed bits?" sounds like a pun for "why are you freaking out." Does anybody know whether or not its actually a pun?

Watashi is pretty [colorless](http://i.imgur.com/tTXF8Lf.png) most of the time but [sometimes isn't.](http://i.imgur.com/dt4TNr3.png) 

I will add more later; off to watch that episode again!

I'm back.

I think I'm going to fall in love with this story.

If we are seeing things as Watashi perceives them to be, then the instances in which his surroundings look like a fisheye lens or are some ugly color are how Watashi feels about them. When in his room, Watashi almost "bends" into view due to the fisheye effect and stands imposingly above Ozu before Ozu offers the cake. The [fisheye effect](http://i.imgur.com/VhPveTA.png) makes him look (and think he is) much more taller and imposing than he actually is.
 
Right before Watashi goes to talk to Akashi, the word  which means "big" appears behind him. According to wikitionary, "This is often the first half two-character shorthand name of universities, for example  (Tokyo University, Tdai)." The word that appears behind Ozu before he falls into the river is  which means "method, law, and in the case of Buddhism, Dharma. According to Wikipedia, "In Buddhist philosophy, dhamma/dharma is also the term for "phenomena"." And thus "we" are given a second chance to change "our" fate.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the main character's name is ever mentioned in the show at all, and when they listed the character's names on MAL they just called him that because he narrated the story.
>> ARTICLE
It does my heart good to see so many first-timers in this thread. I watched this show as it was simulcasting and it's far and away my favorite anime of all-time. I didn't re-watch the first episode because I inevitably end up re-watching the show like twice a year, but you newbies are in for an amazing ride. First time re-watchers will probably find it a rewarding experience as well since you'll be able to catch some small details in early episodes that make sense if you've completed the show before.

First time watcher here.

>Studio: Madhouse

I could have swore Shaft made this anime. This makes me love Madhouse even more. 

I'm liking the art style here. There's a mix of vibrant scenes and some look like they recorded a video and slapped a filter in it. The character designs are... interesting. Ozu definitely looks unique, thought a bit out of place. I don't dislike his design but I'm guessing it's relevant in the narrative.

That blazing fast narration caught me by surprise. I can read fast enough to understand what was going on but I had to pause every few seconds or so to look at the art. I didn't want to stare at the bottom of the screen most of the time.

I love the ED. It's so chill. It reminds me of Space Dandy's ED. I think they're sung by the same person.

edit: I looked it up and yes both EDs were performed by [Etsuko Yakushimaru](http://myanimelist.net/people/10127/Yakushimaru_Etsuko).
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse can do weird almost as well as shaft, I would say they have a way larger spectrum of weird tbh. They did TTG and pingpong as well as NGNL and Kaiba. Obviously I'm forgetting a few, and by weird I mean a unique art style. 
>> ARTICLE
It's just this particular anime that makes me think Shaft, really. The art style along with the heavy dialogue reminds me of Monogatari and Sayonara Sensei.
>> ARTICLE
I always compare it to Monogatari as well. When I recommend it to my friends that have seen monogatari I tell them to be in a monogatari-esque mood.

You might be confused with Sayonara Sensei, the MCs of both bares resemblance.

I think you might have replied to the wrong person but yeah I can see they both seem to be pessimistic at times.

Nah I said it because one of my friends could have sworn it was Shaft. But he got in confused with Sayonara sensei. Was wondering if it was the same case with you
>> ARTICLE
I'm typing this up as I am I watching the show. I kind of suck at analysis so this will be more of my impressions as I watch the show.

Already starting out kind of trippy which I always like.

...umm, this narrator is talking WAYYYYYYY too fast. I hope he is going over something not incredibly important that will be re-explained later because all I got out of that was there is a shrine located somewhere. 

Ok so I rewatched the beginning and noticed there is a random moan...that's always a good start to a show. Ok so it's called the Shimogamo Shrine between the Kamo and Takano Rivers. Got it.

On another note the animation style is pretty damn amazing I love it already.

So this fellow he meets also lives in Shimogamo Yuusuisou and claims to be a God. Crazy guy confirmed. Long ass name too. That's right MC Kamotake for short. Anyways it seems this dude wasn't kidding he knows some shit and wth is this Kannazuki? I must accept that I'm not going to get a lot of what these terms means at first I guess.

"I don't follow in the slightest." Thanks MC. You made me feel better about my confusion. Anyway Kamotake is gonna play cupid apparently and get this woman MC knows (Akashi-san) hitched to someone. Although I still don't know why our God friend is bothering to tell MC all of this. Ahhhh ok so Ozu-kun is like the love rival. Makes sense I guess.

TIME FOR THE OP! Holy shit. I have to say that this is one damn amazing OP song wise and animation wise. I'm really digging it. I might have missed some important stuff from it because I was so entranced by the awesomness an- HOLY SHIT MADHOUSE ANIMATED THIS! Say no more. No wonder I was digging the animation.

Pretty relateble thus far with his idealized college expectations versus the reality (especially as a no-time-having engineering student). Ok so this is Ozu-kun. pretty scary lookin' dude. Oh so this girl is in engineering too. best girl confirmed. Ha! So this guy is trying to play the anti-Cupid or something? I guess you get tired of being surrounded by all these couples while you aren't getting much action yourself. 

Did I mention that I love the animation? Because I really, really do.

Ha! I really like this duo of mischief. I don't know why but I always find delinquent characters to be some of the most interesting and entertaining to watch even though these two may not actually turn out to be delinquents there anti-Cupid ways are entertaining.

Just an ominous looking fortune teller. Nothing out of the norm. Lol! Looks like Ozu-kun is already getting somewhere with the ladies. And looks like he knows that our MC is trying to get hooked up himself. Wonder how he found out. Yeah MC best to keep that to yourself. Ok so he might be a little jaded cuz of this kohinata-san ex. Makes sense now actually.

Ok best girl just suddenly appears. Ok my boi made a promise. We'll see what that's about later I guess. Apparently she is the shut-down queen. Ok Kannazuki explained now which is good. A gathering of gods. Ok so Izumo is the grounds for all the love matchmaking decisions. 

So him trying to go after Akashi-san is like defeat for him. It seems he despises the happiness others find in love. Definitely seems as though that ex left a huge scar on him. 

Ok so he promised to take her to that spot at Shimogamo Shrime. He might have some game afterall. So he is gonna take the plunge and try to win Akashi for himself. Good man. But damn didn't seem as though he got anywhere with Akashi during Gozan (whatever the hell that is. must be some sort of festival.). Ha! Ozu dressed as a trap.

Wow what an ending. I hope they are ok. It looks like there may be some sort of time travel elements which I wouldn't be surprised by given that the existence of gods is already confirmed. Also really chill ED. 

Anyway that was an extremely great first episode. I'm honestly  amazed and already hooked. As I said I can't promise that I will refrain from binge watching the rest because this is bingeable as all hell. Anyway I am extremely excited for the rest of this!

**TL;DR**: Amazing animation and already hooked. Hope MC grows some balls and asks out that Akashi chick before that creepy fucker Ozu. Can't wait to see how time travel is handled because that's always an interesting concept to explore.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly I don't have time right now to write longer posts but just a short answer to the 'random' moan. Well you could say it's still a bit random but it's there because the shrine forest together with the river junction looks kind of suggestive. It's obvious if you rewatch the first few seconds.

Looking forward to more posts on the next episodes!

Thanks. This series' 11 episode length and art style make it pretty rewatcheable for me so I'll make sure to pay more attention the second time around.

First-time watcher here.


[Mfw I realize the rapid-fire narration continues the *entire episode*](http://i.imgur.com/gmPSYFf.png)


But seriously, this was an enjoyable first episode. The characters are interesting (although Ozu freaked me out a little when I first saw him). The art style is different from what Im used to seeing but its absolutely beautiful, and I especially like how the high-contrast real images are mixed in. The OP and ED are really catchy too, and the morphing tatami floor plans are cool.


Does the rewind at the end of the episode mean its going to be the same thing all over again  la Groundhog Day? Or is it more like each day/episode has the same kind of structure but with a slightly different overall plot?


This may be too soon to say, but I think Im gonna like this.

Another first-timer's impressions! This first episode was an interesting experience, to say the least. The minimalistic art style, juxtaposition of animation with real life video footage, and the extremely fast narration all give the series a very abstract, post-modern feel. I can see why plenty of people would be turned off by these elements, but so far, I like how unique they are.

My first impression of our MC is that he's a pretty relatable person who made a series of bad decisions. When he does things like idealize the "rose-tinted campus life", struggle to find a social circle, make mistakes because of his lack of understanding of others' emotions, or even just scarf down a cake in the middle of the night, he brings back memories of things that I've experienced so far in college. I expected this to be a show that was going to hit close to home as I was watching it, and so far, that seems to be an accurate guess.

Finally, I loved the description of the ramen cart as something that "comes and goes as it pleases". Considering that our protagonist first meets the god of matchmaking there, I think the ramen cart is a symbol for the opportunities that we are presented with in life. We can't predict where they come from, how long they will be available to us, or where they will go if we don't seize them while we have the chance. I'm assuming this show is going to focus on the MC's past decisions and how he can grow from them, so I'm hoping that there's more interesting insight like that throughout the series.

It makes me so happy seeing all these first time watchers recaps, keep it up guys!

My [mental image of a first-time watcher](http://i.imgur.com/KlPrgwY.gif)(Damn, someone used it already :p) as they witness the subs. Whenever there's internal narration by the MC, prepare yourself. It doesn't get easier, you just get used to it.

[So begins our MCs journey into a rose-coloured campus life](http://gfycat.com/LoathsomeHospitableChrysomelid). For a show that's so visual with its storytelling, it sure sucks that we have to stick to subs. This is my first rewatch of the show, so I'm enjoying the visuals a bit more this time around.

While the art is a bit different and maybe off-putting at times, it's a [beautiful show](http://gfycat.com/JampackedParallelCanary). Especially in how it [uses color](http://gfycat.com/FlusteredWeeklyHeron).

Alright first off : holy fuck. I thought I was ready for a deluge of dialogue but I wasn't ready AT ALL. I think I'll get the French subs for that, as I can't possibly follow the pace of the dialogues well enough. 

Annnnnnd now, as for the episode itself... Pretty interesting. I like the art style already. The characters seem likeable at least and they do seem more than one-dimensional. 

I think watching the episode twice will be a good thing for longer and more interesting posts. In any case, really interesting first episode. Looks like I'll enjoy the ride, even if it doesn't become my favorite anime ever. It's also a goddamn pleasure for the eyes to watch this. It looked a bit iffy sometimes but other than that, it was gorgeous.

I just rewatched this about a month ago, but after reading all your comments, screw it, I'm joining in! There's no such thing as too much TTG
>> ARTICLE
I was going to watch it the night before but I guess I'll watch two tonight. 

Even though this is my second time watching, I'm still having problems with keeping up with the subtitles. So densely packed episode. That fireworks scene is just perfect in how the art and animation come together. 

The OP and ED are so great as well.

I said in the reminder thread that I might make some gifs and I did:

First timer here. I have to say, this is waaaaay different than what I normally watch. I really hope I enjoy it.

Also, while I usually just watch it the way I want to, is there any suggestions on HOW to watch it to improve my experience, because judging from the first episode, it is a pain to keep up with all the information and fast text. Like should I pause often like with Monogatari?
>> ARTICLE
My suggestion is to just skim the subtitles instead of actually reading them all, if you're able to read the general context, you don't really need the details. You can go back if you feel like you missed an important part, but mostly try to keep up with the flow. It won't slow down, but you should get used to the pace, so it'll be easier after a few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
One thing I noticed, which absolutely passed me by when I first watched the show in the distant past, was just how many small Japanese culture-specific references were being made throughout the episode.

For instance, the calling out of cardinal directions when he's talking about derailing people's romances is a callout to the Feng Shui portions of the [Omikuji fortunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-mikuji) you can get at shrines when looking for blessings (much like the one he himself visits later). Also the thread-above-the-mob imagery is a shout-out to a classic Japanese short story [The Spider's Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spider%27s_Thread), which I ran across later in Madhouse's **Aoi Bungaku Series**. There's a whole host of other stuff like this, and I'm certain I'll be running across more in later episodes.

FIRST TIME WATCHER

I've been hearing nothing but praise for this anime since before and now I get to watch it with you people.

First thoughts; 

The rapid fire narration + real life scenes with filter gave me the Monogatari feel.

Art style was a little comical for me especially the charadesign of Ozu but I think that suits him with his personality. Akashi is a beauty btw.

I kinda relate a part of both Watashi and Ozu

I'm a pretty bland person. Is not very outgoing and from the first part, like Watashi and Ozu, I'm currently in my 2nd year of college which makes this VERY timely for me I guess. Civil Engineering btw.

I have a small group of friends which I fool around and often joke them "there's no forever" regarding their love-lives, as I'm the only one not having relationship whatsoever from the opposite sex since birth which makes me feel kind of 'black cupid' cause like Watachi, I wasn't been able to have a very satisfying highschool life I guess and I kinda want to do stupid things now.

Not that I don't have any interest at girls but it doesn't really hit me like how others become attracted to girls now I guess but I do also have a liking on this girl which was my classmate back in highschool though. She's pretty cool but not as cold as Akashi though.

Deus Ex Machina at the ending gave me the impression that he's gonna do some 'small' things when he goes back in time.


>> ARTICLE
Seems like an interesting anime, definitely different than anything I've seen so far.  The art style is definitely something new too - I can't decide whether I like how simple it is yet.  I went in completely blind (didnt even read the MAL description), so this is different from what was expecting.  Since it had "galaxy" in the name I thought it would be like a space battle anime... Yeah.  I'm confused at the ending scene, though - it looked like everything was going back?  Maybe the gods decided to give him a second chance, since he was clearly about to die and had fucked up his entire life?  Who knows.  I'm intrigued to see where this goes.


Also - are the main characters thoughts spoken extremely quickly the entire time, or is it just for the beginning of the anime?  It's hard to look at what's going on with the visuals when I can barely keep up with reading the subs in time.
>> ARTICLE
> Also - are the main characters thoughts spoken extremely quickly the entire time, or is it just for the beginning of the anime? It's hard to look at what's going on with the visuals when I can barely keep up with reading the subs in time.

They are like that the entire time. But you will get used to it, partly because of the way the story is built up.

Also try to watch the visuals as well: they provide the imagery with our rapid fire monologues, so you can glean the meaning of his words through seeing as well. Visual storytelling game is very strong in this one.  
>> ARTICLE
I feel this is even faster than Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and Monogatari, and I haven't finished all seasons of those either. After a while it gets tiring keeping up with both the animation and the dialogue. I guess these kind of shows get better the more times you watch them.

So, I gather this is a story about loneliness and awkward romantic encounters? I like those. 

And I like the weird aesthetics of the show, even though I have a tendency to dislike things based on looks. 
>> ARTICLE
So, this might have already been mentioned, but what is the rewatch schedule? Is the rest going to be decided later on?

One episode a day, and the day after the final discussion thread we will have an overall discussion thread on the series as a whole.

Thank you! I'll jump in on this rewatch in that case. At what time will these discussions usually be posted?

1 PM EST. Thanks for joining in!
>> ARTICLE
First time doing one of these. 

Episode was really weird at first, and I wasn't really feeling the focus on romance, but as the episode went on I actually grew intrigued.

Will try to continue along, hopefully I'll enjoy it as much as most others on this sub!
>> ARTICLE
I should not have watched this right after I woke up.
>> ARTICLE
[MFW I see the fnatic sign (UOL fan)](http://imgur.com/egilLR6)

The storyteller goes fast. Really fast. And he tells hard to understand stuff. I pressed pauze, a lot. Probably gonna watch it twice from now on just to understand what is happening better. 

All in all a good start up episode, I think the major things to notice where that the protagonist is really lonely, sad and regrets all of his decisions. Osu was really weirdly drawn and acted really weirdly. No matter, I tend to enjoy really original characters. 

[prediction](/s "The story is gonna be about the protagonist trying to find this mysterious raven haired beauty by signing up for every single club on campus. In the end this will result in him having the same life of sadness and desolation he finds himself in at the start of the series every time. In the end he will realize it is not about joining a club, but just being with Akashi that makes him happy. Edit; I feel like adding this; before the series is finished Akashi will have some sort of illness, resulting in the protagonist resetting time over and over again to be with her. In the end he will have to let her go in the very last scene of the show so that he can live his life, resulting in me crying.")
>> ARTICLE
That was pretty fucking hard to watch haha, I'll have to rewatch it and slow it down a tad. Good start though, Akashi seems like the exact type of character that I'll like. Ozu is a bit weird but hos quirkiness is fun to watch. MC-kun already giving up on his lifelong beliefs, take note 8man.

Visuals were.... interesting, whereas I'm not a fan of everyone apart from Akashi's character style everything else looked gorgeous and well animated, excited for more!
>> ARTICLE
Well that was different! I'm already loving the quirks of this art style and narration. My favorite thing about this show so far is how the many thoughts and emotions are translated into exaggerated visuals. Things like Akashi's icy response creating ice and the protagonist turning into an awkward mishmash of rigid blocks blows my mind. It's almost like...symbolism made literal? This will probably become one of my favorite shows judging by how much I've enjoyed the first episode.

I have a few theories for why the MC speaks so quickly. He either has anxiety issues (highlighted by his lack of social skills), drinks too much coffee, or the show itself is on fast forward and we'll revisit certain plot points at a slower pace to flesh out the details. I suspect that the narration may also slow down due to some character development or outside influence (would he be speaking at the same speed if he was drunk or sleepy?)
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher. Liking it; narrator is fast but I think I caught it all. Watching it on Hulu, quality looks bad for some reason (like lines are pixely, hmm).

Still a bit confused about various parts though:

* Why would one need to escape from a restaurant?
* What parts were flashbacks and what were not?
* Why was Ozu dressed up as a women?
>> ARTICLE
* They needed to escape the restaurant because they were still on the run from people they had set the fireworks off at. They eventually wound up at the restaurant, but people from their university were also having an after-party there. They were afraid of being recognized as the guys who set off the fireworks.
* The episode starts when the MC is roughly two years into school. It flashes back to his freshman year and choosing the tennis club. Then there's the fireworks scene which takes place in the present after the opening scene at Neko Ramen. After they set off the fireworks there's a flashback to the MC meeting Ozu and their escapades together. Afterwards, things continue from the present until the MC speaks to Akashi-san at the restaurant. Then there's a flashback to the first time he met her at the book fair. It goes back to the present day and Ozu delivers the castella. The MC looks up at the Mochiguman toy hanging from his light and flashes back to a conversation he had with Akashi-san which introduces her fear of moths, the Mochiguman toy set, and their promise to go to Neko Ramen together. Then it's back to the present for the remainder of the episode.
* Ozu is dressed as a woman because he's engaged in a bit too much mischief and gotten a few too many enemies. It was an attempt at a disguise.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!

First time watcher. 

Several thoughts/questions:

This looks good. Entertaining, stimulating, creative. It seems to bounce back and forth a lot. For example, the outtro was unique, and seemed(to me) to be rather pleasant, but just before the end it started shaking, everything was closing in...and then back to a 1-2 seconds of pleasant animation. It is emotionally taxing. 


For about the middle 10 minutes of this episode I thought we were in a flashback, all before he met the god. I realized toward the end that that was not the case. 

So, is Ozu actually a demon or....how did he know (at the bridge scene) what the main character just thought, and how'd he also know about the words of the god? So WAS it all set up by Ozu? But then, do we need an explanation for the ending time reversal, or could the god still legitimately have sent him back, and Ozu also set it all up? Maybe Ozu also has supernatural powers?

Okay, now that the intellectual stuff is out of the way...this show makes me sad :(
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this show is stunningly beautiful, I really wish I were able to look up from the subtitles more often, the bits and pieces I saw being what they were. Regardless, this feels like it'll be a great show, and I love the idea of a Kowloon city like atmosphere within a giant dormitory!
>> ARTICLE
I am one of the very few who don't like this show.  

the only reason I gave it a 6 on mal is because I am too easily swayed by others' opinions :/ (prolly would've given it 5 or *maybe* 4 if i was feeling really edgy)   

nevertheless, I am discouraged by how lackluster this show was to me, so I am going to give it another shot here.
>> ARTICLE
Well that was hard to watch haha. Those subs are fast!! 

Will say not impressed/interested in most of it so far but I'm sure it'll only get better if the ending is any sign!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've tried to watch this show before, but realized I would have to be super-intensely focused or pause A LOT to be able to keep up with the subs. I'll try again at some point.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that was me, this is my second attempt haha.

My first was like 2 am I was like why not try this...nope lol
>> ARTICLE
The art was great omg didn't know its a more "dialogue" kind of anime kinda reminds me of Sayonara Zetsobu and Monogatari series is this by Shaft ? The opening and the ending song was great also.

Edit:

Now to my episode observation

This is my first time watching this but it always gets mentioned in this subreddit so I joined this rewatch and I don't regret it one bit.

Ozu, is he human ? The mystery of neko ramen ? will they ever go to neko ramen ? can't think of anything other than ramen now..... 

Akashi I can't describe here I can't figure her out (well maybe because it's episode 1) but she kinda reminds me of Senjougahara shes like cold but sweet you know ? hard to describe

The MC (lol forgot his name) Edit 2 : Watashi 



Getting hyped for tomorrow I'll rewatch episode 1 again later 

This episode made my reading skills better that fast dialogue man.

overall I think this may have the potential to be one of my top anime

I am very very late to this party, but I just recently finished the entire Haruhi series last week after a friend urged me to watch the series.

The final movie of the series (The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya) completely left me speechless at just how masterful it was. The pacing was near perfect as well as the development of the two main characters of the movie (Anyone who has seen the movie will know which two were in the spotlight).

The movie was just so mindblowingly amazing that it actually might become my favorite movie of all time, replacing a spot which was held by my previous favorites for 7 years.

I just finished this show as well, but for the first time, and I saw how much hate it got on the internet and it made me pretty bummed. I thought it was awesome. It kept me on the edge of my seat.

[Nadesico](http://myanimelist.net/anime/218/Kidou_Senkan_Nadesico). Finished it 3 days ago.

The show works on many layers, and it really surprised me with that.

The last episode of Clannad After Story. It messed up my mind. I still don't fully understand what happened at the end. Can someone explain...
I can't understand the robot and girl thing... But I do know the robot is the  one Tomoya bought for Ushio, that's obvious.
>> ARTICLE
The way I saw it was that [Spoilers](/s "Tomoya and Ushio really DID die at the end of After Story. After they died, Ushio became the girl in the other world, and Tomoya became the robot. They spent most of their time in the world trying to collect orbs of light which were things that could supposedly make wishes come true (The orbs of light were formed whenever someones wishes came true, such as for Kotomi, Fuko, Tomoya's dad, etc). When they collected enough orbs of light from the various other worlds, Ushio was able to use them to create a world where Tomoya's and her's wish came true: A world where Nagisa did not die. So in short, the final final ending of Clannad is the one where the girl and the robot (Ushio and Tomoya) create their ideal world, the one where Nagisa did not die.")

I know. And what I said is that even though I prefer Bake, I still see why he thinks Tatami Galaxy is the best anime in the last 15 years and there aren't that many good choices for that title. And because of that I think it's nonsense that he's sitting at 0 points.

I'm not sure if you can call it the "best" one cause there are lots of anime in this area which can be comparable.

**'I have a feeling I've heard this before...'**

Well, I hope most of you now have some sense of what's going on and how everything is structured. For those who are still lost, you are in luck: yesterday my focus of interest was the artstyle, today it's the narrative structure. 

I have to beat around the bush a little in order to avoid spoilers, but today's episode at least largely unveiled the mechanism this show is using, at least right now: each episode displays the first two years of Watashi's 'campus life', but with a different choice at the start. Comparisons with Groundhog Day are easily made, but I think the more apt comparison is with the influential 1950 Japanese classic Rashomon of legendary director Akira Kurosawa in which a certain event is viewed multiple times from different perspectives (I'll try not to spoil anything, you really should watch it if you haven't already). Ultimately which comparison is more fitting is, of course, beside the point. What matters is the common theme between the three: repetition.

Repetition is a strange thing. It is both crucial for our society and detrimental to the point of breakdown, all depending on the context in which it is used. There is hardly anything we can do without repeating other things: that is simply a fact, one that is neither good nor bad, just one we have to live with. Before I taper off into philosophical ramblings nobody wants to hear, let me say that when repetition is used by capable hands, it can be an immensely powerful tool. Because often when repeating things beyond their initial process, we tend to see patterns and deviations thereof, the strong points and the weak ones, the core of the matter and even the tiniest details.

Masaaki Yuasa, the director of this show, is very much one with capable hands. His use of this looping narrative structure is a blunt tool used very elegantly. We see Watashi's two years of campus life begin with a different choice, but he is still the same person at the start: therefore, some things are bound to repeat themselves one way or another. Yuasa emphasizes those events by letting them play out almost exactly the same way as they did before, forcefully drawing our attention to the similarities between each go-around: those events are what makes up the naked core of the story and the repetition of these events allows the show to absolutely hammer that core home, to make it impossible to miss. Our brains flash a signal at the rose-colored campus life speech, the fortune teller's speech, the fateful Akashi encounter and subsequent promise, as well as tiny sentences and conversations such as:

- '... with a face of ill portent.' - Watashi
- 'You say some pretty mean things' - Ozu
- 'That was my first contact with Ozu, as well as worst contact.' -Watashi
- 'At any rate, once I met you I put all my efforts into making you no good.''Why do you haunt me so?''It's the way I show my love! We're connected by the black thread of fate after all.' - Ozu/Watashi

But with powerful tools also come huge pitfalls and repetition is no exception. There is one pitfall inherent to repetition in particular that is devastating to works of entertainment: boredom. Simply said, nobody wants to watch the exact same thing over and over; just look at the particularly infamous Endless Eight from Haruhi. But Yuasa is no fool, quite the contrary: he understands the tools he works with and does not use them carelessly. He pulls out a number of tricks to curb the threat of boredom: the specific number of tricks I want to highlight is two.

The first one is a side-effect of the near-carbon copying of events. The key word here is near: the aforementioned moments are almost exactly the same... almost. There are tiny differences between the occurrences of the events, little details that differ slightly. So while our attention is directed towards these repeating events, it is simultaneously drawn to the tiny little details that are just a little different: the pattern and the off-pattern. Yuasa uses that phenomenon to keep us on our toes as he includes details with a variety of purposes, from small comic relief moments like the fortune teller increasing her prices by 1.000 Yen for every time she gives her warning, or small character moments like the varying promise Akashi imposes on Watashi, showing us that she really is interested in him. The foundation is in the repetition, the artistry in the details.

The second one is a thing of genius: here our lightning narration finally enters the equation. The main goal of the vicious verbal onslaught is to mimic Watashi's thoughts: thoughts are *way* faster than spoken language, so in order to recreate that and allow for all his inner monologues to come through, the show chooses to press the fast forward button on the dialogue remote. Leaving out his monologues was never an option: the risk of getting lost in the maelstrom is already present as is, so one can imagine that without Watashi's monologues, the story would either fall flat or apart. I don't know which is worse. And yes, it would be that bad, just look at what happened in the Oregairu Zoku threads and the amount of missed subtext and necessary 'explaining'... the consequences for The Tatami Galaxy would have been similar, only tenfold.

But this is not the only reason. There is more than one solution to this problem. However, this particular solution has one fantastic side effect... in fact, the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced it's not a side effect at all, but extremely intentional. Allow me to explain.

Consider the opening *rose-colored campus life* monologue, one of the near-identical repeated events I mentioned before. The show wants us to focus on this event, mostly because it informs us of where and when we are before the real fun starts. It anchors the show, which is always important: nobody wants a train wreck, however entertaining they may be (a certain two-season mecha show comes to mind). But one can imagine that after a number of times the whole thing begins to outstay its welcome, as it clogs up the show with things we already know: we want to see new things, dammit! 

Except it never does. Why? Because of that Mach 5 narration! It zips through the monologue without breaking a sweat and before we can get annoyed, we're in the episode. It gets the necessary stuff out of the way fast and efficiently, leaving more room for... well, basically for everything else. 

But what about missing those lovely little details you just mentioned? Here's where my EP1 post comes in: all of the imagery accompanying Watashi's monologues is actually animated, so we can immediately visually pick up where it diverges from the regular pattern!!

The animation covers a flaw in the speed of narration, which in turn diminishes a downside in the structure... which in turn allows for the core and its theme to be hammered home with impunity. 

It's an amazing achievement. Not only does the show have multiple strengths, they are also chosen such that they cover each other's weaknesses. 

That might just be the most impressive thing about this show.

Excellent analysis and, au contraire to your apology, a very good length for it.

The narration is a feature, not a bug! And when you stop to think about it, the show would probably be twice the length if the narration *wasn't* that fast.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I like these posts, keep it up!
>> ARTICLE
Okay, actual comments now...

&nbsp;

Ahhh, so it's THAT kind of show. This is going to be fun! I get to geek out and take notes and everything!

(No screencaps this time, Monday nights are too exhausting. Next time!)

&nbsp;

The Cycle:

* Myself starts college, joins a new club with a new goal (romance! ART!!)
* fails to achieve his goal in the club, gets upset at the other members
* meets Ozu, and together they try to ruin that goal for the others
* in second year, meet Akashi who doesn't hate Myself
* Akashi loses a monkey, gets attacked by a moth, Myself promises to do a thing, finds monkey, forgets about it
* With Ozu, begin all out sabotage plan (bottle rockets, Jougamashi documentary)
* have an encounter with not-love-god
* eat in a restaurant with Ozu, who heavily implies that he is aware of alternate timelines and they all turn out the same. Ozu's line about the black line of fate tying them together.
* on the last day, meet the oracle who tells him his opportunity is dangling before his eyes
* Cake! take dangling monkey, remember promise to Akashi, disappoint her by executing the final sabotage instead of fulfilling the promise, things go to shit
* REWIND!

&nbsp;

Overlaps:

* Ozu was in drag at the end of timeline #1 for no reason -> true love movie from #2

&nbsp;

Misc Thoughts:

* If Ozu is at least somewhat aware of the different possible paths and says he would corrupt Myself in any of them, then that leads me to believe that the "happy end" path, if there is one, would be to not get corrupted by Ozu at all. It doesn't matter what club you pick, or what your goal is, Ozu will find you, stand on your shoulder and whisper dark thoughts in your ear. But if Myself doesn't remember and if it's in his nature to accept Ozu at first, how can he break from that?
* Akashi's role remains unclear. Myself doesn't seem like he's consistently in love with her (he only was at the end in episode 1 and not really at all in this episode), so I surmise she was some other aspect. Possibly her detachment could be a counter to Ozu's corruption - she wasn't romantically entwined in epi-1 nor especially fond of Jougamashi in epi-2, but she was having her own fun and didn't feel the need to ruin things for others, a lesson Myself could learn. But she shows up in second year so she can't just replace Ozu in another timeline.
* Mr. Not-Love-God is the biggest inconsistancy right now. I thought he would end up proposing some choice to Myself again, similar to how he did in episode 1, but he didn't really impact events at all this time. Maybe he is just the god of clocks, observing and deciding when to rewind.
* I don't remember how much the oracle cost in episode 1, but each time Myself asked if her prices had gone up, like deja vu. It was 2000 this time, have to keep an eye on that going forward. If it keeps going up, it will eventually hit a point that Myself can't afford - that might be what breaks the cycle.

&nbsp;

Other Stuff:

* Since this episode had less chronological jumping, it seems like Myself started out coloured and became more and more plain/ghostly as he fell deeper and deeper into depravity/loneliness. This could be meaningful, or just could be a great use of visual reinforcement.
* Pretty water effects
* Just like Myself gets taller or wooden when he perceives himself as such, I loved the change in Jougamashi depending on his perspective (king on a palanquin) or Myself's perspective (arms over buddies' shoulders, possibly drunk).

>Ozu was in drag at the end of timeline #1 for no reason -> true love movie from #2

[mfw you realize there are parallel worlds and probably not complete rewinds in time](http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxi23kZLh61r9652ro1_250.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Yea, Ozu definitely seems aware to some degree of the time loop with what he said. The love God can't be that much of a coincidence either.
>> ARTICLE
Another possible overlap: When he gats home in timeline 2, someone's already eaten the cake, and there were pieces of it all over the place, like the aftermath of himself eating the cake in timeline 1. Either that or I missed something, I don't know, the dialog goes really fast in this show.
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, maybe, but in TL#2 the already-eaten cake had 3 plates left around it, whereas in TL#1 he had no plates or cutlery and just ate it by the fistful. 

It doesn't bring up the interesting question of who ate the cake in TL#2. Ozu and Love-sama would be a good fit as they do seem to like stealing his food, but what about the third plate? 

Could the timelines be intersecting each other, so a different Watashi ate the cake with Ozu and Love-sama?
>> ARTICLE
>Myself doesn't seem like he's consistently in love with her

I think that the moth scene proves that he has some romantic feelings for her. It's played to us as a memory of his, in which the color and the overall vibe is much brighter than the rest of the episode. 

The fact that he is remembering it that way is a bit telling of what his actual feelings are.
>> ARTICLE
Important friend/acquaintance? Yes. 

The differences in colouring and angling on those scenes, plus the MC's own actions of not wanting to risk hitting Akashi with bottle rockets / having her implicated in the mockumentary, etc all heavily indicate that Akashi is important to the MC and he values her good opinion of him.

But I don't see any romantic implication yet other than when Love God proposed the choice to him in TL#1. None of TL#1 before that nor any of TL#2 implies any romantic intent to me. 

>> ARTICLE
I think a reason why you don't see any romantic implication is because MC may not even realise it himself.

 IIRC in EP1 we are told that MC's prior life has has virtually zero social contact (especially that of the romantic kind) and he wishes to obtain this in his Uni life. However due to his lack of experience he is completely unable to recognise Akashi-san's interest for what it is, instead considering her an important friend. And since the story is told by MC, I have a feeling that in future episodes he will realise it slowly but surely. 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they say in Ep1 that some girl broke up with him in his first year?
>> ARTICLE
They did, but it was a rather short relationship. My impression of it is that MC was unable to maintain it. It says in the first EP that he did not know how to handle making conversation with people, which I would think is an extremely important skill in maintaining a relationship
>> ARTICLE

It's true that you'll see quite a few repeating scenarios and scenes over the course of the series. Might be worrying to some, but trust me when I say that it's used to an advantage.

I already like Akashi, a lot. Seems like the type of girl I would be crazy about if she walked around on my campus. 

That is actually a testament to how well written she is, and how real she feels. And we are only 2 episodes in, oh boy!
>> ARTICLE
Well, the more stuff is revealed the less I know about what's going on.  At this point, I have three theories:

1. Everything is unrelated. The anime will play out eleven different scenarios of his college years, using the slight differences but major commonalities to both drive the plot and explore its themes.

2. Some kind of universe crossover is happening; this is mainly based off that half-eaten cake (which he did himself in episode 1). This seems so obvious, however, that I doubt it's where it's going.

3. We are in fact getting some kind of rewinding, maybe centered on this opportunity that the fortune teller hints at - she suggests that if he doesn't grasp it, he will walk the same path (rewind?) forever.

Which brings me to my final point: I really enjoy the recurring statements (like Ozu being a blemish on his soul, the fortune teller's dialogue) as well as the recurring "plot elements", like coming to some sort of understanding with Akashi which makes him regret his plots with Ozu. They do a great job of tying this episode to the last, which is  one of my favorite things about time-loop type anime which do this well.  Strangely, they also kind of remind me of the recurring quote "those who accept their fate are given happiness, those who defy their fate are given glory" from Princess Tutu.  Not really sure where I was going with that.

(Finally, Akashi is my favorite character so far; everything about her is just great, from her reactions to moths to her deadpans)

**Episode 2**: Time for the movie club! And out of circle again. "Oppai junkie" - It's not an illness, it's a condition! "This opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes." Important. Masaki has very embarrassing private life. And the promise that was unfilled again. 

First time watchers can probably already see a pattern forming.

**My first-timer thoughts:**
 
This time we go back in time/to an alternate universe where Watashi (I guess that's what we're calling him?) joins the film club. I liked this a lot because film editing is a hobby of mine so I was able to relate to it in a few ways. We see a lot of parallels between the first episode and this one as well. Ozu also said something I liked about how it's always going to end the same way or something like that. Speaking of Ozu, I get some weird feeling that he and Watashi are the same person, but both represent different personalities. This theory sounds interesting to me but Ozu was thanked by the film club president himself, and he appeared in Watashi's movies so realistically speaking this probably isn't true. But still, I'm going to hang on to this and see if there is any more evidence later on to back this up somehow. Also, I just want to say that I am in love with the OP and ED. They are so perfect!
 
So far I am loving this more than I thought I would and the whole time loop thing is reminding me of Higurashi a whole lot. [Higurashi Spoiler](/s "It's like how Rika was trying to find a way for everyone including herself to survive and went through thousands of time loops to do so. This is similar to how Watashi wishes to go back in time so he can make everything right, except unlike Rika, Watashi has no memory of the previous "worlds/timelines" he visited before.") Anyways, I can't wait for episode two!
>> ARTICLE
>Speaking of Ozu, I get some weird feeling that he and Watashi are the same person, but both represent different personalities.

This is an interesting thought, but I think it could also be that Ozu is "that one kid" in every group who doesn't completely belong but Watashi perceives him as the same non-human weirdo making him do questionable things.
>> ARTICLE
I get a devil on your shoulder sorta vibe from Ozu.
>> ARTICLE
I am basking in the confusion of first-timers and enjoying some wild guesses on what's going to happen or what the show is about. All the rights and wrongs are really amusing. I just hope most will stick to the end, because the show is pretty slow in the first half and I myself almost dropped it. I managed to finish it and now it's one of my favorites. 

Anyways, the fun is just starting and the wheel of time is turning backwards for the second time. Would it change his life if the protagonist did something differently at the start of college? Or would it end up the same? I did wonder the same thing when I got my degree. What if I did this or that, maybe I would be somewhere else? The show is really relateable to me. 


>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like the dialogue slowed down a little. Maybe it just feels that way because we're covering some of the same dialogue and plot points as the previous episode.

In any case, this show is really making me think. I'm wondering if Ozu and the matchmaking god are actually just different sides to the main character's psyche. Like maybe Ozu is just his darker, more mischievous side and the matchmaker is his rational subconcious. Something else that stood out to me is that the MC keeps blaming his misfortune on other people or circumstances (the club he joined, Ozu's influence, members of the club he joined, etc.). This leads me to believe that the MC will eventually come to realize that everything that goes wrong in his college life is his own fault. That is, staying friends with Ozu, being socially inept, lashing out at people out of spite, not changing himself, and never seizing the opportunity dangling right in front of him (Akashi).

As the fortune teller said, nothing will change if the MC never seizes the opportunity in front of him. I think the fortune teller's price will keep going up for each iteration to represent how costly it is for him to repeatedly pass up on an opportunity of a lifetime (or cycle). So I'm guessing this loop will continue until he finally takes Akashi out on a date. In a way, Akashi could represent all the romantic interests that people let slip by. The scenario may be slightly different each time (the girl from tennis, the girl from film club, the girl on the bus, the girl from work, the girl at the coffee shop, etc.), but the general framework of "boy meets girl he likes" is the same each time. Here, the protagonist keeps psyching himself out, blaming others for not having a rose-colored campus life, and acting out of spite only to disappoint Akashi. I think we can all relate to this to some extent.

In these two episodes, the MC ended up with Ozu both times (jumping after him into the water in episode 1, and kissing him in the film he made in this episode)...I don't remember the matchmaking god's exact words but could it be that the matchmaking decision is actually about who the *MC* will get with? Maybe it's actually MC x Akashi vs. MC x Ozu? In that case, MC x Ozu is a bad end and he has to keep restarting until he gets a good end. If Ozu is just an aspect of the MC, then MC x Ozu would just be MC committing to a life of being single (insert masturbatory joke here).

I'm also guessing that each episode will have a different overarching theme--something new for the MC to blame his lack of a rose-colored campus life on. Episode 1 seemed to about how all the girls were already taken and in a social circle that excluded the MC (everyone had a tennis partner but him). Episode 2 seemed to revolve around superficiality. The girls were only interested in a good-looking man with a fake persona (an *actor* who is so superficial himself that he can only accept the perfection of a girl doll). Akashi is always the exception in each club scenario though.

The messily eaten cake and dj vu experiences implies that the MC will gradually remember things and learn from his mistakes. Bits and pieces of each episode will probably bleed into the next, possibly all collecting into a mess of episode references towards the end. That would be *really* cool to see. I'm also looking forward to seeing the MC's character development.
>> ARTICLE
I like this different scenario type. I would have thought that the MC deals with different people in each scenario, but this might be better.

Ozu looks less evil this episode. And man, that Jougasaki dude-bro is fucked up. Hilarious! 

But I somewhat miss the theme of this show. First episode I thought it a rom-drama about loneliness, like NHK. This episode looks more like a comment on social appearances. Color me confused. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm getting Endless Eight vibes and I'm so excited.
Today I only had to watch it once to catch everything yay I'm keeping up!

Basically when time "rewinds," Watashi still remembers events from the past, whether or not he willingly remembers them or not is unknown. 

Things that have remained constant so far:

* Ozu and Watashi will target an "enemy": the first episode's enemy was romance, the second was Jougasaki.

* Ozu is the catalyst for Watashi's unfortunate experiences...at least thats who Watashi blames them on.

* Akashi is the only character so far who isn't against Watashi and Watashi can probably trust her.

* There is that guy with the giant chin who doesn't do much except he seems to have some association with Ozu

* There are always at least two drunk people: Watashi and someone else. Ozu is usually with Watashi when he is drunk and Watashi will always see the other drunk person. I'm seeing drunkeness as a way the characters use to escape reality so they don't have to face their fears or change themselves...I hope that made sense.

* There is an old fortune teller who probably will tell Watashi the same thing every time.

* Watashi will think back to a time when he and Akashi talked over Ramune drinks which leads to talking about the five (five is such an important number will discuss later) keychain characters and then a promise and Watashi inadvertently has the fifth lost keychain.

I feel like episodes from here on will probably contain all of the above mentioned events but certain things will begin to emerge, allowing the protagonist to slowly realize his mistakes and develop.

In this episode Ozu seemed to sometimes sprout a fox-like tail? I remember post from the previous threads commenting on the "unreliable narrator's overactive imagination." This could be part of Ozu's character development, as in Ozu becomes more and more inhuman to the protagonist as he begins to realize Ozu's detrimental effects to his own "rose-colored" life. 

Also I looked up the meaning of "Misogi" ( or ) and it's a "Japanese Shinto practice of ritual purification by [washing the entire body](http://tsubakishrine.org/images/misogi.jpg)." The first activity we see our protagonist do with his club is get thrown in a body of water. How symbolic. Oh my god. 

Theme of five: Akashi had five keychain characters but lost one. Each time she tells Watashi this he responds by offering to help her find the missing keychain. Each time Akashi says she would rather Watashi do something else, and makes him remember it as a promise. Each time Watashi remembers this event he sees the keychain dangling from the light in his room. Likewise, the [scenes](http://i.imgur.com/ebtHHhR.png) from Watashi's film about the endless tatami rooms (which obviously closely parallel the events of Watashi's life right now) show five (or 4.5) [rooms,](http://i.imgur.com/UV0ZF1H.png), the Misogi movie circle's [symbol/logo](http://i.imgur.com/VRVLKgH.png) shows a five square pattern with a symbol in the center, and the show's [picture on MAL](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/50457l.jpg) even has a five square pattern, although it's different from the other "looping tatami" symbols in this episode. Also, the clock tower at the end always begins its rewind when the [hand hits five](http://i.imgur.com/J90GrUE.png).

Going back to the scene between Akashi and Watashi: could it be Akashi is actually preventing Watashi from leaving this endless loop? Would Watashi returning the lost keychain complete the loop or is it saving him from looping back? But she is the reason that Watashi sometimes hesitates and realizes that he's doing some crazy shit that he doesn't actually like.      

At the end of the episode, when Watashi yells "Keep it to yourself!" is he telling himself that he should have kept his dislike for Jougasaki for himself? Just like at the end of the first episode where as he falls into the river he wonders what would have happened if he didn't become a black cupid, he is again wishing for another chance, after not changing his path early enough and causing his endless looping through the tatami to start once again.

>  I'm seeing drunkeness as a way the characters use to escape reality so they don't have to face their fears or change themselves...I hope that made sense.

Just like real life then! I also see it as college students being college students and drinking a lot.
>> ARTICLE
So when I first watched the series I didn't have the OP/ED properly linked in with the episodes. As a result, I went from the rewind transition of the first episode immediately into the beginning of the second (I had multiple episodes in a playlist). While I really do like the OP and especially the ED, I think that lack of intervening space between episodes affected how I viewed the show. I didn't have a moment to catch my breath or even think about the ending of the previous episode and I kind of liked that.

[For the rewatchers, many spoilers](/s "I realized as the MC was rattling off the summaries of his first three movies that they're all summaries of later episodes: the ongoing proxy war, his choice between Hanuki/Kaori/Keiko, and finally when he gets stuck in the infinite rooms.")

>> ARTICLE
This is my third time watching this and I never noticed that before. Damn I love reading these threads. :D
>> ARTICLE
I did the same thing for the first 5 episodes because I moved the files for the OP/ED. (My version of the show used ordered chapters; the OP/ED were split into their own files and shared with all the episodes to save space). I realized my mistake when i thought about the directorial implications of ending in such a sudden manner, and got to experience that awesome ED for the first time after the sixth episode.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, my version doesn't have the OP/ED either - after the clock scenes it goes straight into a couple frames of the "rose-coloured college freshman" section and then the episode ends. Seems a bit strange for it to have those last few frames of that at the end of the episode (I do not have it set to auto-play the next episode so it's not from that). 

I'm sticking to the 1-episode-a-day schedule though so I shouldn't have the lack-of-moments-to-catch-my-breath problem, right? Or am I nevertheless missing out and should find a version with the OP/ED?
>> ARTICLE
At the very least you can watch the themes on Youtube: [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkH8ti1gakE), [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IcFDwygw-o) [spoiler text for those that are like MY BLIND EXPERIENCE](/s "episode 11 OP theme https://youtu.be/xkH8ti1gakE").

I love Ozu and Akashi! MC is a little, eh, naive perhaps? But I'm looking forward to seeing him grow.

This episode was way easier to follow than the first one. Maybe because there were some repeat lines but Watashi wasn't speaking at blazing speeds as much as he was in the first episode. This lets me appreciate the artwork more when I can just watch and don't have to pause and rewind. xD

I'm loving this so far though. Glad to have join this rewatch. ^_^

To the person who said I'd get used to the mach speed monologuing, you were right. I'm surprised I'm already acclimating to it, and beginning to enjoy the show for what it is. 

The episode was surprisingly funny, I hope to see more romance develop between Akashi and Watashi

Hey dude, just wanted to say thank you for hosting this discussions even though its hard to participate in them due to my time zone (only watched EP2 an hour ago) 

This rewatch actually made me continue Tatami Galaxy; I stopped at episode 2 previously because I got distracted and forgot about it :/
>> ARTICLE
No problem man! I kept putting this anime aside for a long time as well, so starting this rewatch has also encouraged myself to finally get through it.

Also, sorry about the discussion times not being convenient for you. =/ If you'd like, you can watch the episodes a day early, write down your thoughts, PM me them, and I can post them in your stead.

Thanks for joining in anyways! I'm glad I encouraged more people to pick up this anime and/or continue where they left off!
>> ARTICLE
Nah it isn't your fault that the timing is bad for me.

 I somewhat prefer watching it after the thread is up so I can immediately see what other people are thinking. Also because I generally don't post direct replies to discussion threads, instead I prefer responding to other peoples' responses be it in an actual reply or just thinking about their thoughts. 

Its just that with the timings having such a large time difference theres a smaller chance of people responding to my responses. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow. Watashi goes back in time and instead picks a different club to join and his experience is almost the same. He can't make any friends besides Ozu and Akashi and he grow to dislike his club.

The narrative feels kind of similar to [Haruhi spoilers](/s "In endless eight, Haruhi keeps looping the timelime because she feels like she forgot one important thing to do (Kyon's homework). I think Watashi goes back in time because he keeps forgetting to give the plushie to Akashi, as he is in love with her and giving the plushie might improve their relationship. Also, Watashi experiences deja vu the same way Kyon does.")

I liked this episode better because it was a bit slower paced. Watashi didn't narrate as much as the first episode and I liked the story about Jougasaki better. 
>> ARTICLE
Did we do a parallel universe episode?  There were a lot of scenes that were similar to the last episode. Not a bad thing,  but anyways MC seems to be a little influenced by Ozu with his prank on the film club president. Nice to see more feedback Akashi. 
>> ARTICLE
It is getting really hard not to binge this. 
>> ARTICLE
Nobody replied to me yesterday so hopefully today. 

Okay, so he went back in time and played out his last 2 years a bit differently? So how'd he go back in time this time? He never met that god of matchmaking this time, that character was just some contact of Ozu this time. 

I'm getting pretty annoyed that I'm watching intently but don't know what's going on. Just following the dialogue is difficult enough that I don't watch the animation much. 

Oh yeah, one mor thing. I have this sneaking suspicion that Ozu doesn't exist, or something like that. Trippy anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a first time watcher as well, so I probably won't be able to answer your questions but I can give my thoughts.

I'm not sure how his time loop ability works, but it might work because he met the matchmaking god the first time and said he wants to be with Akashi. Therefore, everytime he does not get with Akashi, his wish to the matchmaking god to be with Akashi activates and he goes back in time to try again but joins a different club instead. That's just speculation though.

I also have some sort of feeling that Ozu does not exist, but is Watashi's other personality or something like that. But so far there isn't much to prove this so I'm not so sure either.

I guess we just need to get through this anime for everything to make sense!
>> ARTICLE
Good thoughts. Have Ozu and Akashi ever interacted? They refer to each other, but have they spoken to each other?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think so. Though once again, I'm not 100% sure.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a first time viewer so I don't know how things will develop later but I have a very strong feeling that nothing will be explained. We just see different 'versions' of the events and there won't be an overarching plot with the MC trying to escape the loop.

Akashi is great, a sharp tongued female character is an easy way to win me over...everyone else meh

Thoughts and speculation from a first-time viewer! 

Im starting to pick up on a few recurring things that happen each time Watashi repeats his college career:

* He has an overly idealized view of what college life will be like, and the path that he takes fails to live up to those expectations.
* He always winds up as a social outcast, but the reason why this happens changes each time.
* He always has an interaction with Akashi that results in him obtaining a white Mochiguman, which he keeps dangling in front of him on his bedrooms light fixture. Akashi has 5 Mochiguman, so by keeping one of them, he has left her with only 4 of them. The number 4 is bad luck in Japanese culture, and by keeping it, he inflicts bad luck on himself.
* Ozu always interferes in his efforts to improve his fate.
* The timeline ends in a form of situational irony. In this timeline, for example, Watashi worked very hard to obtain an effective cycle, only for that effort to be fruitless (it gets stolen). When presented with the opportunity to join the Birdman team, he gets into shape, only to discover that the Birdman vehicle was literally designed for him to not exert any effort.
 
Could Icarus have ridden the wind had he not tried so hard to flap his wings? 

Im starting to think that Watashis problem is that he keeps exerting his effort in the wrong places. His primary goal in college is to obtain a relationship with a raven-haired maiden, which is a really generic description; I dont think he has a very specific idea of what he really wants out of life. He obviously likes Akashi, yet he never approaches her directly about it. (Ironically, so far, he comes closest to doing so in the first episode, where he is scorned for ruining the relationships of others.) Like Watashi says, this opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes. No matter what he does for the first two years of college, he always meets Akashi, always obtains her Mochiguman, and never returns it, leaving her with 4 of them and inflicting bad luck on himself. He always has the option to move on by approaching her, returning the Mochiguman, and directly confessing his feelings. Instead of fighting fate so hard, he needs to accept it and see where it takes him.
 
Based on the imagery in the OP and ED, and the events of the series so far, I think the title The Tatami Galaxy refers to the infinite possible paths that Watashi could have taken during his first two years of college. No matter what path he takes, it always ends in regret, an ironic downfall, and disappointment. Yet, his fixation on his past is keeping him from making progress in life, both mentally and physically (He is literally repeating those 2 years over and over again). My best guess is that Watashi is going to keep repeating those years until he figures out that being fixated on the past is not the answer to moving forward in life; rather, he needs to embrace the opportunity thats been dangling in front his eyes, and directly confront Akashi about his feelings. Only then will the cycle break and he be able to move on with his life.
>> ARTICLE
This was really well-written, thanks!

I'm also struck by the name of the cycling club - "Cycling Association Soleil", reinforcing the Icarus symbolism that was sprinkled throughout this episode and tying in to this particular line in your write-up:

> Im starting to think that Watashis problem is that he keeps exerting his effort in the wrong places. 

The cycling club - and perhaps more broadly, all of the extracurricular clubs that our MC has joined thus far - is the sun to Icarus's wings.
>> ARTICLE
As a first time watcher I get the save vibe from the series. The OP in an interesting point as the characters keep stitching positions and clothes while the ED is also the Fibonacci sequence, a mathematical sequence that goes on for infinity but also is required to figure out the golden ratio - which is the ratio which is what classical thinkers used to think provided beauty but is ironically irrational - this, in the context for the show, could be Watashi **rose-coloured life** or his hidden wish to be with Akashi and to fulfil her promise; which links to what you brilliantly stated.
> Im starting to think that Watashis problem is that he keeps exerting his effort in the wrong places.


>> ARTICLE
Love reading this, it really mimics my thought process the first time around to a tee. 

Didn't know about the relation between 4 and bad luck, another nice touch. 

I'm not going to discuss anything with you out of fear of dropping unintentional hints, but keep these coming!
>> ARTICLE
Continue doing these, they're very interesting to read as a rewatcher.
>> ARTICLE
When I watched the series my first time through, I think that this episode in particular gave me a full understanding of what this show could accomplish with its time-loop narrative. The way it related to the previous two episodes was great, in that certain things are different but still the same. 

For example, in the first episode we hear mentions of Akashi's "Birdman" circle but learn nothing about it. This episode introduces that aspect to us, as well as Akashi's role in the circle.

Another is with Jougasaki's part in the episode. While he only has a small part, he's still the same character as before. What's different, however, is how he interacts with the MC. 

Seeing different facets of these characters helps build this world that the MC inhabits, it makes it feel authentic despite the sci-fi/supernatural aspects such as the time-loop. It's also why I'm greatly enjoying this rewatch, as I'm noticing previously minor details that actually turn out to be important later on.


Well, onto some GIFs.

**'Does not compute!'**

I have a confession to make: this post will be less thought out than the previous ones. It's not that I didn't have an idea on what to address today, because I did. The cause is more straightforward: I made a simple miscalculation. I switched episode order in my mind. So the thing I planned to talk about today will be for tomorrow, leaving me slightly unprepared for today. But no matter: I'll switch some things around, since at least one of the subjects is much too broad to handle in one post anyway.

That said, let me get this underway! Yesterday I talked about repetition as a tool and how the show uses it effectively. Today I'll address something to which the aforementioned repetition adds, but isn't the sole cause: the confusing nature of the show. 

Past threads have had a number of people saying, paraphrased, that they don't know what the fuck is going on and to be honest, I can't blaim them. The show *is* confusing. But what we, all of us, need to accept is that this is neither a tool nor a downside: it is simply a feature, an element of the show, one we have to accept and live with while watching. So to those of you hoping I'd 'resolve' the confusion, I'm sorry: you just ran out of luck. You will simply have to hope that the show resolves this confusion by the end. I do advise you to have faith though, as I feel the show has already (3 episodes in) offered enough proof of competency to earn that trust: in the meanwhile, keep paying attention, but don't worry too much and try to enjoy the ride.

So no, 'tackling the confusion issue' is not something I can do, nor do I even want to. What I mean by 'address' is actually the opposite: I want to identify the root of the problem, the reason why the show turned out like this, thereby probably exacerbating it in the process. So what exactly makes this show confusing? Is it the art style, frying away your eyeballs with its ever changing shapes and colors? Is it the narration, bombarding your ears while your mind is desperately trying to keep up? Is it the structure, looping, twisting and turning you around until you've lost all sense of direction? 

Well yes, none of those help much (especially the last one), because there is simply so much to process. Indeed, this isn't the kind of show that allows your brain to go on standby... but still. One gets the feeling that a vantage point exists where this fog is no longer present and you can see the entire picture. 

And so we enter the heart of the matter: the show does not want you to have this vantage point. The show does everything in its power to keep us, the viewer, from rising out of the fog, from reaching the position of almighty observer, because the show wants us to *be* Watashi and he does not have that view either! The heart of the problem is that we are forced by the show to view this story from Watashi's perspective and oh, how skewed and unreliable a perspective that is. 

This is the point where I'm going to make matters worse. I already briefly mentioned after EP1 that Watashi is an unreliable narrator. Back then I talked about the consequences this had in terms of the physical depiction of the characters... but who says it stops there? We are never told, nor shown how unreliable Watashi's view actually is, but we already know he has a vivid imagination. We have already seen glimpses of how out of control his narration is, in fact, two examples come to mind directly:

- In the previous episode, just after the fortune teller speech, we see Jougasaki being carried by servants on a golden throne while wearing a laurel and a robe, all the while literally being fawned over. In reality, he's being supported by two people because he's drunk.
- In this one, the 'grunts' of the Cheery Cycle Cleanup Corps are displayed as ape/troll-like brutes with little human characteristics. Seeing as Ozu is the head of the lot, they are probably just students too.

Those are just two examples, but it's enough. We already know his viewpoint taints the physical depiction of the characters, as well as exaggerates occurring situations beyond recognizability. So who is to say it stops there? Who is to say he doesn't manipulate spoken dialogue, or even tip the balance of 'right and wrong'? 

The rapid dialogue, vibrant animation and twisting structure already taxes our brain to the limit, but that isn't what kills us. What kills us is the fact that the information and impulses we are given are infected and corrupted as well, passing through Watashi's filters that only blur the existing picture by unknown amounts. 

Which begs the question: are the people we see truly as Watashi depicted them? 

Fortunately, this is not Jaden Smith: The Anime... all hope is not lost. Tomorrow I'll be discussing the characterization in the show and Watashi's effect on it: at least we'll be able to put some bounds on the blurring our main man is inflicting on us.

love your write ups but not sure it was needed to let everyone know how unreliable of a narrator he was instead of allowing everyone to find out for themselves. Not a big deal but yeah

Your write-ups are awesome! Thanks for doing them.

Thanks, that means a lot! I'm really enjoying doing them as well, since it gives me a chance to revisit and analyze the show I love most while getting my thoughts in order through writing and having an audience to bounce my ideas off of. 

Of course, I also hope doing them will help people appreciate this show even more, especially since there is so much to process for first timers. 

I'll keep them coming, especially since they're so well received :3 
>> ARTICLE
Wow.

This episode really blew me away. When they reveal that Ozu is the trench coat man the whole episode just makes so much sense. 

**Prediction:**
The MC will come to an understanding that there is no rose colored campus life and that life and college is what you make of it. 
>> ARTICLE
Your prediction seems correct, although I think he'll realize more that pursing a raven-haired maiden is wrong and he should focus on more worthwhile tasks.
>> ARTICLE
So I started with the show yesterday, and it took all of my willpower not to binge the whole thing in one sitting after the first two episodes. I'm a huge fan of the storytelling, and the animation / art style are both gorgeous.

Ozu's motivations are a little harder for me to understand this episode - in the first and second episodes, he's more or less "helping out" the MC, although he clearly has his own agenda as well. This episode changes that dynamic, as Ozu now simply causes as much chaos as possible in Watashi's life.

The Fight Club-esque theory that Ozu is an alternate personality of Watashi doesn't seem to hold up after episode 3; however, as a first-time viewer, Ozu is rather suspicious, especially given his degree of interaction with Higuchi.

The only disappointment this episode was a lack of a moth scene. I'm really enjoying the ride so far.
>> ARTICLE
I'm late today, and this was a pretty straightforward episode (so my first-timer reactions won't be much different than what's already posted), so let's instead jump straight into me going on a long rant about something I've started noticing this show does very well so far:

&nbsp;

###Art, Clarity and Symbolism

By this point, we can all see that the art style will continue to be experimental, hyperbolic and occasionally surreal probably right up to the end of the show. 

Additionally, I'm sure at this point no one would argue against the notion that this show is being intentionally difficult to "figure out", possibly even deceptive, in its depiction of what is "really going on". There are large gaps in the audience's understanding of why things are happening the way they are, where things are going, and how all the pieces fit together. In some senses the show is presenting a puzzle, but the audience does not yet have enough information to even try and guess what the rules of the game are. 

Neither of those aspects are especially unusual in and of themselves, but the combination of them makes things very interesting. The two have a fairly natural cohesiveness, right? Portraying an unexplained puzzle-esque plot/premise using unusual visual styles just seems like a good fit, as both have elements of mysteriousness and iregularity to them. An irregular art style can be used to highlight clues that otherwise wouldn't stand out enough, or can help set the right tone without giving too much information away. Meanwhile, the mysterious plot puzzle will invariably draw the audience's attention to the art style and make them pay more attention to some of the experimental visuals you want to showcase. 

On the other hand, there is the danger that having both these elements will turn away viewers who aren't ready for that level of obtuseness in a show and can't find something to root themselves in the show so they don't lose their way and give up. 

That's where the clarity aspect comes in. 

You can't just throw a ton of seemingly-meaningless and confusing dialogue and imagery at the audience and expect them to like it. A good writer and artist will give you a solid starting point, and will gradually reveal or confirm things very explicitly as you proceed. Sometimes this just serves as a catch-up mechanism for people who miss stuff, other times it is a helpful confirmation of which is the right interpretation when the audience can think up three possible interpretations (some of which the writer/artist might never have conceived of). In any case, it gives the audience a sense that they're actually making progress in figuring out the mysteries and reassures them that it will all make sense eventually ... and that works even if you're not really doing anything more than just making something explicit that the audience almost certainly already guessed. 

So here in the Tatami Galaxy, while the first episode was certainly an onslaught of information in confusing order and with little immediate relevance, the 'Black Cupid' section showing Watashi's joining the tennis club, failing to make friends/romance, meeting Ozu and their initial sabotages was laid out very straightforwardly - the narrative of that section was very chronological and event-based, and the art in that section was pertty clean-cut and simple compared to the whooshing slideshows, fuzzy staircases or body-morphing seen elsewhen in the episode. That's the root the first episode gives you to start building upon.

The second episode had many moments of almost identical repetition from the first - parts like Akashi's moth attack and Watashi remembering he had made a promise. There was no moth or precise promise in this episode, Ozu's first meeting was changed much more from 2->3 than from 1->2, etc. If the sentiments are the same from episode 1 to 3 (and presumably beyond), why have events be so identical from 1 to 2 but not the rest? Well, I surmise that it was to help the audience keep a handle on things - even though the average viewer would easily deduce by the start of episode 2 that there was some sort of time loop going on, the identicalness of the scenes really cements the idea and reassures the viewer that they're right. 

In this third episode, the show was much more explicit about the oracle's advice. She's always said Watashi had an "opportunity dangling right before [his] eyes", and given the dangling monkey in his room it is not hard to guess that that is what she is talking about. But it's not 100% certain, so here in this episode they visually show the monkey right as those words are being said. Now you KNOW she is talking about the monkey and don't need to worry that the show might be deliberately misleading you about that. 

So, great, you've got some catch-up/confirmation mechanics for the viewer. What does that get you? Well, not losing your audience from being too confusing is great, but there's another thing it does - it lets the writer/artist go CRAZY with symbolism. 

One of the hardest things with symbolism is balancing meaning with spoiling - you want your symbolism to be more than just a vague hint where people will doubt whether it is intentional at all, but you don't want it to be too obvious and give things away. You want very subtle foreshadowing, too. None of that is easy to do.

A show with timeloops and deliberately hidden plot aspects craves hidden symbolism. You know viewers are going to re-watch parts or all of the show after finishing it to see how the changing timelines and final explanations/resolutions fit in with the earlier pieces, and having subtle elements that suddenly jump out and make the viewer say "Oh wow, how did I not see that before?!" is what makes a show with this sort of structure great. 

Furthermore, a wacky art style gives you the perfect opportunity to insert that subtle symbolism and foreshadowing without it becoming too obvious. Adding visual-driven symbolism in most shows is extremely difficult because such things will stand out way too much, but if your art style is wacky the viewer doesn't know if it's just a part of the art style or an intentional symbolism. 

So again, the plot style and art style have a great synergy here, and no doubt this is why so many shows with complex plots buried in metaphor use abnormal art styles (Lain, Paprika, FLCL, heck even the internet-y parts of Summer Wars could count ... though in a lot of cases its not as much the art style as the depiction of visual abnormalities).

But having those bits of straight-forward exposition and the explicit confirmations/explanations given to the audience, as detailed above, is absolutely necessary now or everything will go right over the audience's head. If your plot is a puzzle, the art style is crazy, there's tons of hinting and bizarre symbolism being tossed around, and the audience has nothing to cling to they are going to hate it. If you do the clarity right, though, they will have just enough cement to stand on and enjoy the spectacle as they try to piece it together.

I LOVE stuff like this when it is done well. As a first-time viewer, there are so many little things that can catch my eye and I have absolutely no idea if they will mean anything or not. Given the art style and how little I know of the premise's inner workings, I can only guess at things, make up hypotheses, and wait to see if they pan out. 

For example, even when he's not being over-exaggeratedly drawn, Ozu's design has lots in common with an Oni or more western-styled imps and devils - his shape, his movements, even his colouring in many scenes. Meanwhile, Akashi's design favours very pale colours and her clothes have a pseudo-conic shape to them. Both of these characters give Watashi advice and opinions, and to some degree their perspectives are diametrically opposed. Watashi, it seems, is oft-given a choice between following one of their paths or the other. [Sounds familiar?](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MxU5M2VVZqQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

Likewise, the continued occurrence of Ozu leaving a room/situation when Akashi arrives (the restaurant in episode 1, the end of episode 3) keeps jumping out at me as a possible indication that Ozu is only in Watashi's head (but Akashi is real) and it is really his own anti-associative and cruel personality side that is sabotaging himself. (Trying to fit that into the bridge scene at the end of episode 1... I've got a few possible ideas. They did both get thrown off.)

And there's a bunch of other ideas popping out just like that. But at this point I have no way of knowing if that is intentional or not. After all, even if I'm absolutely sure some symbolism I've spotted is intentional it's still a perfectly valid technique for the writer/artist to have inserted it in there just to increase complexity, hook the audience more or add some extra character to the show; in that case there won't ever actually be any huge realization of why it's there (ie: Evangelion). 

For a viewer like me, this is a great hook to keep me wanting to watch. I want to see if I'm right, and if not I want to see if there's an alternate explanation. Probably not everyone would be so enthralled by this, many will in-fact be off-put by the difficulty and time it takes to "figure it all out", but for those like me it's a great hook to keep us mentally and emotionally involved in the show. 

Kudos to the creators for getting this right, and I can't wait to find out!!!

Holy. Crap. I think I'm gonna have to read this before going to bed haha!

**My first-timer thoughts:**
 
Wow that went by quickly. Once again, we repeat Watashi's last two years in college, but instead, this time he chooses the cycling club. Just like the other two episodes, he is not content with his club and fails to fit in. The fortune telling lady increased the price again, and Ozu is being Ozu. Those are the constants though. There are some variables as well. For instance, Watashi actually decides to give Akashi's collectible thing back (though ultimately he fails to do so) and we didn't get to see Akashi freak out over a moth this time sadly. Also, I think it has been heavily hinted during this and the previous episode that Ozu remembers all the previous worlds and time loops. I'm also curious to know if the whole show will be a bunch of time loops until Watashi finds the "ideal world". If it is, then I will be very happy because I enjoy figuring out the constants and variables of each episode.
 
Also, reading all of your comments and analyses really changes my look on the show and clears things up for me, so keep doing whatchu doing guys!
>> ARTICLE
After watching the first 3 episodes I can see how the show will go.Basically hes going to have rose colored college life while trying new clubs over and over but he wiol remain the same,until he breaks the chain that lies in front of him.That will be 4000 yen.
>> ARTICLE
I love both the OP and the ED for this show so much.
>> ARTICLE
What are the OP and ED? I hear no songs or anything...

Or are you referring to the intro of him picking the club each episode and the clock rewinding sequence at the end
>> ARTICLE
You're missing out then, especially the [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IcFDwygw-o) which is awesome.

Here's the [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyYCYd2wHY4)
>> ARTICLE
My god, this show packs so many existential problems for a person to face. Love, loss, loneliness, aspiration, despair, etc... And at such a fast pace it's a bit too much to handle, for me as the viewer

Now, for this episode specific, I was hoping the Akutchi moth and promise sequence to be a recurring theme, but I guess it wasn't the case this episode. 

Osu is really oscillating from a troublesome friend, to an outright villain. And I don't even know what the role is for Highuchi is this time around. But the dude-bro from last episode reappeared as a slightly less annoying, but still a pervert , supporting character. 
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher here...

That episode went by pretty fast and the repetition of the cycles are becoming more apparent.

[I feel like Ozu definitely knows about these cycles](http://imgur.com/a/3BrsP). He also knows that his college life won't change no matter which club he chooses unless he changes his mindset about things.

I'm curious as to what club he joins next. I think he likes to choose sports clubs because he wants to improve his athletic ability.

I still love that ED. It's really unique. If you want to hear something similar here's Space Dandy's [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQtLfdryRlc)
>> ARTICLE
I chanced upon a thought as I was typing out my response to /u/watashi-akashi's reply to a response. 

Previously my prior train of thought was that in order for Watashi to break out of the cycle, he had to change himself. But what if the idea is that Watashi shouldn't actually change himself (in a sense) but instead be true to who he actually is. 

Similar to how Watashi's first impression of Akashi-san is that she's really awesome and that she should never change who she is, my guess is that Akashi likes Watashi for who he is and Watashi fails to realise that because he believes that it would be inconceivable that anyone would actually like him for who he is. As shown in EP2, where he lose track of who he was as a filmmaker and sells out so as to speak, and EP3, he attempted to improve himself to meet what he perceived to be Akashi's standards thereby changing himself. In the above two examples he attempts to change himself for what he percieves to be for the better, but ends up changing his character in its entirety, and as such only ends up splintering himself from Akashi.

It could be possible that Watashi's courses of action are influenced by the sheer aura of Ozu, and as such, in timelines where his interaction with Ozu is minimised, Watashi's behaviour (to change himself for the worse) would also be minimised. 
>> ARTICLE
This is actually really cool. I definitely think you're on to something.
>> ARTICLE
I really do like watching an episode a day instead of just binge watching it. The way the "layout" of each episode is the same might have been a bit repetitive if i would've binge watched it. 
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 3**: Nice bike... aaaaand it's gone. I can relate by being not much of an athlete. Giving names to bicycles. "Manami!!!" Luckily Akashi is there to save him! "If you're a man, then grab victory! Grab victory, and grab women's tits!" Very thoughtful words from our Oppai junkie. All that work for nothing. Ozu doing mischief again. The plane flies! In the end, opportunity was not exploited and promise, I think, wasn't even made this time.

Gifs for the episode: [enlightenment](http://i.imgur.com/jdNQEye.gifv)
>> ARTICLE
The first two episodes established the cycle, the third one mostly continues it but changes the pattern a bit. I'll let the first time readers point out the differences they spot as I don't want to draw undue attention to any particular aspect.

Question for first-timers: what other circles do you think our MC could join in his apparently eternal college life? Considering how non-athletic he was in high school you'd think he would avoid the sports clubs, but in the first three episodes we've gotten both tennis and cycling.

[For the rewatchers](/s "I got nothing this episode. We get an introduction to the Secret Society and Birdman but I didn't notice anything hinting at future events.")

OMG this anime is like steins;gate college version ( I will not tell why to avoid spoilers)

Akashi-san's care for Watashi is genuine. Moths moths moths moths moths moths

Ozu is evil and will probably give/lead you to trouble but he is indeed a good friend since he would stick with you even just to torment you (and he always pushes Watashi to Akashi)

This episode was great. The animation. 

I r8 8/8 m8 meming it up since I can't find words I'' meme it up(newbee in discussing anime sorry) 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like this episode very much, but I was in a really bad mood when I saw it so you should take that in to account. Might also be that I didn't fully understand it. 

So Wata starts to work out when he just had his first incentive not to, and then gaining muscle suddenly, when he was trying to get muscle for two years and never succeeded? Just no. This bothered me more than it should. 

So Ozu, reportedly his best friend, is responsible for stealing his bike. Who would do that to his best friend? 

Also, what was up with that race he participated in? I mean he starts and loses his bike so has to start 4 hours late (why would you even bother at that point). 

So Wata has the 'perfect body' to sit in the aeroplane, but akashi who by all means should weigh less and knows everything about the model can't pilot it? 

At the very least I like me some Akashi. Cute, determined engineering student that switches from ice cold to warm at the blink of an eye.. Jup jup, great character design!

One thing I noticed though, is how Ozu flees and Wata takes on Ozu's jacket (at the aeroplane). Kinda gave me a schizophrenic vibe, like Ozu might be the personification of Wata's dark side? 

I think I'd give this episode a 5,5/10, really didn't interest me a lot. I hope (and suspect) it picks up soon. 
>> ARTICLE
> So Wata starts to work out when he just had his first incentive not to, and then gaining muscle suddenly, when he was trying to get muscle for two years and never succeeded? Just no. This bothered me more than it should.

He wasn't motivated at first, because he's not into cycling. He was motivated to work out later, because he was very into Akashi. He did not know that he should not work out: that's why he tried so hard, as to not disappoint Akashi

> So Ozu, reportedly his best friend, is responsible for stealing his bike. Who would do that to his best friend?

A prankster? Don't tell me you've never been the butt of a practical joke. Also keep in mind that all of this is told from Watashi's perspective, so it is likely to be somewhat skewed (unreliable narrator).

> Also, what was up with that race he participated in? I mean he starts and loses his bike so has to start 4 hours late (why would you even bother at that point).

Probably an endurance race. And for a lot of people competing and completing is more important than winning, though in Watashi's case it's just stubbornness.

> So Wata has the 'perfect body' to sit in the aeroplane, but akashi who by all means should way less and knows everything about the model can't pilot it?

Because she actually likes him and sees it as an opportunity to get closer? Their encounters in earlier episodes also lead to an advance from her part.

Ozu is a bit of an enigma at this point, but you'll get him eventually. But I do suggest you keep the unreliable narrator part in mind.
>> ARTICLE
Guess I'll sit tight, I never realized that the narrator is unreliable. But that makes sense since it's first person view. 

Just gonna say that stealing your friends bike when he has been working a year for it it not a prank, that is just theft, mean and not something a friend should do.  

Also ~~way~~ weigh. 
>> ARTICLE
> Just gonna say that stealing your friends bike when he has been working a year for it it not a prank, that is just theft, mean and not something a friend should do.

Yeah it is, but the real events might not be as bad as we are lead to believe. Watashi depicts Ozu as exceedingly evil, but there are already things that suggest he might not be that bad. 
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling that Akashi actually designed the Plane thingy with Watashi in mind(sort of kind of?). This is due to my impression that Akashi likes him and wishes to do things for him, like how in EP1 she tells him to leave the Sukiyaki(?) place and that she would cover him. 

But even though I have this feeling, it also doesn't really seem right as the plan for Watashi to pilot the plane relies on numerous things like maybe Watashi feeling dejected with the Cycling Circle. 

Maybe it all loops in to how in every timeline, Akashi-san will always ask something of Watashi, and this something will always fail to transpire because he forgets/loses sight of his "true character"

Maybe I shouldn't overthink things and see what happens in future episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
I like how  the characters have different roles in different cycles.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that caught me off guard the first time I saw it. Jougasaki's completely different this time around as he's only tangential to the story rather than a central figure.
>> ARTICLE
If only the cycling team had the kind of camaraderie of Yowamushi Pedal, then the transition would have been a lot smoother. Not to mention getting such an expensive bike stolen was terrible. Just makes you think that Ozu is not merely a dark aspect of Watashi's life/psyche but his potential future as well. Instead of pushing through when things get tough and attaining that future he wants for himself, he gets dragged down by his 'friend', his own extreme expections, small (and big) bumps in the road and he feels utterly alone in tackling it because there is a sudden sense of self responsibility and people are more afraid of reaching out for help than they might have in their highschool days.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so Ozu screwed him real hard this time. 

Sad that he's wasting his time every episode.

Ozu-god master relationship?

And what was Ozu this time anyway. He was a sound guy before, but now he was...actually a fish demon?

This anime seems to be more and more focused on highlighting how we waste our time. 
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher, a bit late here I guess.

I really like how every other character have different roles in each cycle. I feel like the range of characters would still increase and would have variety of roles in the more cycles to come.

Aside from the other points which others have stated, I now often see parts where they point out something related to a room with 4.5 tatami in it and it really piques my interest if it is somewhat related to the plot.

Lastly, I want to speculate, I (kinda)feel that at the near end, all the other characters(main and side) have all their memories of all the cycles and only Watashi is in a constant loop. Nevertheless I'm loving this watch and did the dialogues slow down or did I just develop faster reading skills?

>> ARTICLE
This is the same point I dropped the series at last time, hope it gets more interesting from here on in.
>> ARTICLE
yeah I shelved it here as well. At this point it's pretty apparent that this is NOT something you watch to veg out. I had too many things going on upstairs to have the mental capacity to even begin to process everything that's goIng on...
>> ARTICLE
Last time I watched it I was concentrating fully. I just found it too boring to continue watching, and I barely drop any shows.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really enjoying the simplicity of this series. Here's to hoping something happens with Akashi and Watashi!

Oh, geez...
>> ARTICLE
If I had to pick a weakest episode of The Tatami Galaxy, it's probably between this and one other episode. That said, it's still got the same enjoyable traits of the other episodes such as great visuals and fast pacing. It's the circumstances, such as the circle and focus on the proxy-proxy war that I felt was a bit lacking in comparison.

It does formally introduce Hanuki, the dental hygienist who was first seen with Ozu back in episode 1. She has some of the better parts of this episode in my opinion, but even so [Very Vague Spoiler](/s "there's much better material concerning her yet to come.")

I love that part. He decides to not carry on the spirit of his predecessors and... they all tumble to the ground as the flees. Completely unexpected but fitting for the show.

[This was so awesome.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipNvicMYSX0) I have no idea what is happening here but this was a really cool scene. 

A lot better episode than yesterday. I am really eager to find out if master Higuchi is gonna return, or if Wata has actually taken over his role for good. 

Edit: Ok so I just realized something; [prediction](/s "so what if Higuchi and Jogasaki competed for the dental hygiene girl all their college career, and in the end Jogasaki wins the proxy war leading dentist girl to go out with him. Now Osu and Wata have to fight for Akashi in a similar fashion. It would kind of explain the weird song  (like Higuchi, Jogasaki and hygiene gril represent the circle, square and triangle.) ")

**'We must take that endless bit of darkness and turn it into our advantage.'**

I've always been fond of this particular episode. Besides the great visual gags and general randomness present everywhere, there are some nice little hints and bits thrown into the mix as well. As a re-watcher, this is one of the episodes I like to revisit most, for reasons I will not (yet) divulge: it is way more fun to discover these things for yourselves as a first timer.

Anyway, on to the meat of the post. Yesterday I talked about the confusing nature of the show and how Watashi's perspective is the driving force behind it. Today we have finally duly met all of the key characters present (attentive watchers will point to the OP and say we're still missing at least two of them, but they are not that necessary for this post at least). Which means, it's time to discuss the cornerstone of every TV show ever: characterization.

Now don't get me wrong. Animation, soundtrack and plot are all majorly important elements in a good anime, but a strong cast of characters will always save a show no matter how bad or uninspired everything else is. A good show will always be carried by good characters, even if it's just one (another certain 2 season mecha show comes to mind).

Which puts The Tatami Galaxy in a bit of a bind. Of course Watashi is a great character, since looking at everything from his view allows the show to really round him out and lay bare his entire personality. Unfortunately, this has grave consequences for the other characters. We never focus on them: we never get to hear their thoughts, nor build up defining moments that strengthen or grow their personalities. The show can't put in a 'Jougasaki arc', it can't even dedicate one section of an episode to its supporting cast members, as that would pull us out of the mind of Watashi, when the show has put in so much effort to lock us into there in the first place. 

Additionally, being locked in there also means that what we do get to see is tainted by his perspective as well. We only need look at the physical depiction of the supporting cast to see that we're not getting people as they truly are. You can easily imagine Higuchi being described as 'that weird senpai with the huge chin' and Jougasaki as 'that perverted senpai with the creepy smile', not to mention what happened to Ozu's entire appearance. They all appear flat and skewed, because that is how Watashi sees them... except for Akashi, who seems to be the only person being fully depicted as a regular human, indicating that Watashi is probably describing her as she truly is. But still: for a show like Tatami Galaxy, clearly bent on being something more than mediocre filling, one dimensional characters would be a crippling blow to those ambitions. 

So clearly something had to be done, otherwise the whole thing might fall apart. Luckily, Yuasa is no slouch and his solution is clever as always: the show's existing features are once again used to cover for each other's weaknesses. His first idea and by far the biggest part of the solution is basically this: if we can't change perspectives, why not change the scenery? 

And the mechanism for that changing scenery was already in place: the show's narrative structure and use of repetition. Each go-around allows the show to put the characters into a new scenario and cast them into new roles, which it uses to show new aspects of their characters. For instance, after episode 2, Jougasaki was just a power hungry pervert, but in episode 3 his role as a sensei showed a moderate amount of trustworthiness and wisdom as well, while today's episode revealed him to be a great friend. On the other hand, the repetitive nature also allows the show to reinforce existing character traits by keeping them the same, casting off the doubt Watashi's perspective adds to their character: Jougasaki is without a doubt a pervert and Higuchi is without a doubt a free spirit. We can't exit Watashi's perspective, nor does the show want to, but by changing the environment the show still manages to round the characters, turning them into more than the caricatures seen by Watashi's eyes. 

Another tiny loophole to bypass the confines Watashi's perspective imposes on us resides in the fact that Watashi's filter may be strong, but it is not omnipresent. When a boisterous person tells a story, the parts which truth you can be most sure about are the ones the storyteller is emphasizing the least. Likewise, the parts in the story of The Tatami Galaxy where Watashi's bias are non-existent, are the off-hand moments and remarks, those Watashi's mind does not revisit or scrutinize. For example, in today's closing minutes Watashi observes a small conversation between Jougasaki and Hanuki that shows that Jougasaki is not as inept at establishing social contact as one was lead to believe in episode 2, nor is Hanuki as perpetual a drunk as we are lead to believe in the beginning: Watashi's filter is absent because of his emotional distress at the prospect of a prank war with Ozu. I point this out not to spoil anything for you, but to implore you to look out for these moments: they are pretty hard to find, but finding them is well worth it in my opinion.

There is one character conspicuously absent in this discussion: Ozu. There are little remarks to be found for him too (I'll leave it up to you to find them), but his role has remained constant up to now: a role of mischief and subdued evil. 

But even he might not be who he seems...

>> ARTICLE
I have honestly no idea what's happening in this, except "What would my life be if-...", which is a question I often ask myself, unsurprisingly enough. 

I thought I was going to be able to put out some small thoughts on each episode but... I just can't. I'm too dumb for that. I guess I'll just do an overall impression on the series once it's over. 

As for the episode itself, well, that was... a bit different. I thought we'd always get the same exact formula each episode but there are some small variations and it doesn't hurt I guess. I really want to see Watashi finally getting his shit together and doing something with the Mochiguman, but I guess that'll be the last episode where he finally realizes life isn't something you just let pass by, but something you have to grab the control of (like that old fortune teller said basically). 

What I find funny also is that it looks like the same things always happen but since Watashi is in a different situation, you always see things differently. Last episode when he was in the cycling club, him losing was a big deal. Now that he was Higuchi's disciple, he didn't give a damn when he said he won the race (also, Jgasaki). Pretty funny how things always stay the same in the end. 

Also, random guess out of the blue : Ozu is actually a deity and is trying to get Watashi on the good rails.

>> ARTICLE
Haha. Glad to hear that. I feel less lonely now. 
>> ARTICLE
Thoughts and speculation from a first time viewer! Right off the bat, I notice a few callbacks to earlier episodes:

* Ozu was a person without even a single point of praise. He could eat three helpings of peoples misfortune. Watashi has gone through three timelines so far on screen. Also, there are 4 people in Watashis room during the opening scene, which is another sign of bad luck.

* Watashi has a bad premonition about joining the on-campus student organizations this time, and goes out of his way to avoid joining one, but he ends up involved with Osu and Higuchi (who may or may not be an 8th year student instead of a god) anyway. It seems that no matter what he does, he cant avoid getting involved with them.

* Watashi wants to shoot fireworks at young couples he sees along a bridge, but feels like hes done that before.

Based on the previous two bullet points, and the interactions with the fortune teller, I think Watashi retains subconscious memory of some of the events that occur in the previous timelines, but is not able to consciously remember them. His thoughts and actions indicate that hes learning from his past experiences in some ways (for example, he attempted to return the Mochiguman in the last episode), but he doesnt seem to remember everything that happened.

While Watashi is searching for the tortoise brush, images of it appear in a variety of places (including in place of the sun). I think this is a visual representation of Watashis tendency to be fixated on goals that are irrelevant to his success. (How is finding a mystical tortoise brush going to improve Watashis grades or help him find love?) In every timeline so far, Watashi gets fixated on accomplishing a major goal, but the fruits of his labor always backfire on him because his efforts were focused in the wrong places. For example, in this episode, his efforts results in the proxy war gets passed down to himself and Ozu, with the implication that Watashis life will only get worse from here on out because of it.

The scene describing the origin of the proxy war was very interesting. It reminds me a lot of how poor relations between ethnic groups, regions, and countries often have their origins in situations that occurred several generations ago. Often, animosity between two groups goes on for so long, that the original reasons for the groups tensions become largely irrelevant. For example, poor relations between Cuba and the United States had their origin in Cold War political tensions that occurred before most of todays American and Cuban populations were even born. The final scene extended this metaphor further by showing the spirits of all the past fighters of the proxy war above Higuchi, Jougasaki, and Watashi.  

This episode, overall, was different from the others so far because Watashi didnt join a student organization. However, he still got caught up in a meaningless series of events that brought him regret and misfortune. Much like how the ribbons on the present in the final scene are intertwined, the threads that tie Ozu and Watashis fates together transcend the different timelines, so no matter what Watashi does, Ozu will still get involved in his life. I still think that my theory from the last episode is right: Watashis cycle wont end until he decides to move forward from his past mistakes and return the Mochiguman to Akashi. Only then will he be able to grow as a person.

A lot of you guys seem to really dig the art for this show, so I thought I would mention that it's based off of the art by illustrator [Yusuke Nakamura](http://www.yusukenakamura.net/). (But, of course, mixed with Masaaki Yuasa's flair)

He's mostly known for doing album cover art for Asian Kung-Fu Generation, who sings the OP!

This episode kind of disappointed me to be honest, not enough Akashi. I liked the previous episodes as each episode featured a bit more Akashi trying to get close to Watashi, but this episode she was kind of ignored. 

Hopefully they evolve a bit better in later episodes! Development is what i hope for in this series

Quite late to the party as I've had a busy day. I think my analysis/view/impressions today are dulled as I'm also really tired. 

I think Watashi is an easily impressionable person who gets caught up in the flow of other things and as such, does things which continually lead him away from the truth path. 

I think that as some of the others have mentioned in this thread, the handing over of the mochiguman could in fact be the key flag for the route of the best ending. However in order for that to happen, he has to overcome multiple things; him getting sidetracked, focusing his efforts on the wrong thing etc. Maybe another factor could that when Watashi recognizes the importance of the mochiguman, he will consider the handing over to that of a love confession, which could result similarly to the confession in EP1;becoming incredibly blocky and wooden and just failing to carry out the action. I think that if the above is true, the series will preogress in a way that he will slowly overcome the blockyness over a period of episodes.

What's with these 5 minute episodes? Seriously.

I like that they deviate from the formula a bit and Watashi is getting at least some memory of previous timelines. The visual storytelling in this anime is excellent, the art style really fits in the narrative.

Ozu is still a mysterious character. By the way he looks he either [random speculation] (/s "isn't human, maybe a god of love or something, or that Watashi just perceives him as a harmful element in his life. We are looking the show through his eyes after all.")

Sometimes these hardships will overwhelm us so much that we become extremely depressed and, as a result, we will make irrational decisions: one of these decisions being suicide.

On more serious note, I vaguely remember one scene from VN Fate/stay night when Shriou recalls discussion with Kiritsugu on topic of Hero of Justice/"you can't save everyone". Kiritsugu offered interesting case, I don't remember how exactly how it was, point was something like this:

You have robber who took 10 innocent people as hostage, keeps them at gun point, refuses to talk with anyone and threatens to kill them if anyone tries something. In this situation, not even superhero can save everyone, it's already too late. Yes, mayby superhero can save those 10 hostages, but he can't save the one who needs it most - the robber.

Sure, it's not something new or original, its theme of many stories and mediums (including religions etc.), but for some reason it really struck me back then.
>> ARTICLE
Heavens Feel had the hardest choice by far in Fate imo

Your telling a kid who is hell bent and stubborn on being a Hero of Justice that wants to save everyone  to give up his dream and Ideals in order to find happiness for the one he truly loves the most .If Shirou is willing to give up everything and be selfish and says fuck you to everyone just to save one person . 

But one of my favourite part is one of the Bad Ending where [](/s "Shirou ends up becoming exactly like Kiritsugu and became a killing machine that gives no fuck because he did not let go of his Ideals like his Dad just like Kotomine kirei said he is exactly like Kiritsugu on his prime and He would win the war and kill everyone including Rin and Ilya ")

Yeah, its pretty much same as when snake in Medusa arc of Monogatori talks about victimization. It's pointless ask if someone is victim or wrong-doer, everyone is both. Question isn't "if" but "when" (and "to whom").

Toradora changed my perspective on relationships with close friends and significant others. 

For the longest time, I thought that the best way for me to go through life would be to keep all my feelings to myself, telling myself that letting others know how I feel would just be a burden to them. Toradora made me realize how that kind of attitude can actually hurt those you care about. [Toradora](/s "The fact that everyone really just kept their feelings a secret from eachother, and how that caused pain for everyone involved is what really got to me I think. I believe that's why so many people like Ami in the show, because the way she tries to force the other characters to confront their feelings is actually a very caring thing for her to do I think.")

It made me really rethink how I want to live my life. I can't think of any other piece of media that really got to me as much as Toradora did (and still does on rewatches).
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, the characters in Toradora are only in high school. How many high school relationships do you know that actually lasted into adulthood and turns into marriage in real life? 

I can understand having reserves about getting into a relationship into high school because all that emotional investment will just be wasted when you graduate and become separated by geographical constraints. Falling in love is a pretty normal phenomenon and almost everyone has experienced crushing on someone else before. But since both party will mostly likely just end up getting hurt in the end, they opt to suppress their feelings and keep their emotions to themselves instead. In the end you just have to ask yourself, is the heartbreak worth the journey?

>> ARTICLE
Actually anime has changed a lot of my perspectives on things. Honorable mention here is gay/crossdressing characters. I love how Japan puts characters like these in all natural in a lot of anime. As my vision on gay/crossdressers have always been "whatever floats your boat, whatever makes you happy, I am not gonna judge you for it" but I truly believe that some people may have changed their perspective on these kind of things due to anime.

Angel Beats changed my perspective on life, it made me appreciate what I have more, and treat others around me better. Clannad made me realize that I really want a relationship. I used to like being single and being free to do whatever I wanted at parties, but after Clannad, being in a real relationship with someone seems pretty decent after all.

Both Madoka Magica and Attack on Titan changed my view of what anime really was, I usually have quite an open mind about things but I would never have believed that there existed anime that could be so brutal as both of those shows are, it was a big eye opener to have them as my first to shows and after that I never doubted that there could be anything in anime.
>> ARTICLE
those aren't even close to brutal
>> ARTICLE
When what you've seen of anime is pokemn, some generic shounen and some happy magical girl anime Madoka and Attack on Titan are quite brutal. They also don't fall into the "edgy" territory where they add dark stuff just so you can brag about how dark it is, it is actually well made.  
  
Then what is able to be considered brutal? Is NGE considered brutal? Another? Mirai Nikki? All of these can be quite brutal especially when you compare it to something like Ore Monogatari! or Nichijou.
>> ARTICLE
I can't agree on what you say about Attack on Titan not falling on the "edgy" territory and that it's well made. I haven't watched all of it, but from what I heard, even though there's a lot of deaths, there's a core of characters that won't die, and I consider that to be a bit "edgy". Also, some death scenes on it [AoT spoiler] (/s "like Eren's mom death were very poorly handled and felt more comedic than tragic") and so it's very difficult to take them seriously.


>Is NGE considered brutal?

Yes, both physically and psychologically.

>Another?

No. Same as AoT: poorly handled death scenes were more comedy than anything else.

>Mirai Nikki?

A bit. Most brutal thing to me was [Mirai Nikki spoiler](/s "Yuno's backstory and having to live through that game 2 times")

>All of these can be quite brutal especially when you compare it to something like Ore Monogatari! or Nichijou.

Yes they can, but it doesn't mean they're the most brutal. And that was my point when I replied to your comment. IMO, stuff like Berserk, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Tokyo Tribe 2 are more brutal than AoT, Madoka, Mirai Nikki or Another.
>> ARTICLE
I think you overlook just how big the psychological effect of Madoka can be, in my case I thought it was going to be happy "It is cute magical girls, yo!" and throughout the entire show I held on to the hope that it would all be fine, but it never was. Afterward I felt quite empty.  
  
Higurashi is quite brutal and that is something I can agree with, but that is on a physical level. The death scenes are quite brutal but don't have as much of a psychological effect.  
  
I would almost say Clannnad After Story is brutal [when](/s "Tomoya finds a job and is worried about losing it, it just feels so brutally real") but this is quite a stretch

> I think you overlook just how big the psychological effect of Madoka can be, in my case I thought it was going to be happy "It is cute magical girls, yo!" and throughout the entire show I held on to the hope that it would all be fine, but it never was

From the first episode it was noticeable that it was going to be dark. The scene in the mall (I can't really remember the details) wasn't something you'd find on your typical happy anime.
>> ARTICLE
I just started Madoka Magica last night and I had to go to bed after it fucked my mind a few episodes in. Now that that's over im going to finish it tonight.

Be sure to watch the sequel movie, Rebellion, as well!

Definitely going too, thanks!

Thanks for the recommendations, sadly I have an extreme case of PTW with currently 106 anime on that list... Will probably watch Berserk since I have heard a lot of things about it.

Berserk is more of a manga experience really (being considered one of the best ever), anime can't really do its art justice.

The anime does have some nice music

A simple one, Tokyo Ghoul. Nobody is really right or wrong, but things like the society we live in give the impression of what is.

With all the hate the anime (mostly second season) gets, I hope people don't ignore how core this idea is to the story :x

2nd season is a lousy adaptation of the manga. They messed up nearly everything the could and that's why it gets tons of hate. First season was definitely good, though.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the 2nd season so I definitely won't try to argue anything about it :p Hopefully people still got a good grasp from the first season or started to read the manga!
>> ARTICLE
Aria pretty much turned my cynical-asshole-chuunibyou attitude around by the time I was done with it. Admittedly, I was kinda going through the shitter, but now that I look back I cringe at the way I thought. There are better ways to express yourself/have conversations than starting off with "oh, X sucks", or "man, did you see how bad Y was?" and being positive, even if it's just every once in a while, can make all the difference in the world.

Some anime of the Gundam series inspire me to believe in humanity.
>> ARTICLE
Hey Encore! 
That's cool, how did it do that? Also if I do end up watching the Gundam series, which do you recommend?
>> ARTICLE
Hey fellow Hikaru fan, I think Gundam 00 is a great way to get into the series. It's more action oriented though. Still catching up with the older Gundam series, which have often a deeper message behind them.

The Gundam anime often have a conflict about humanity, hatred and discrimination as theme, which I feel end beautifully with a climax.
>> ARTICLE
Alright! Adding to my plan to watch right away. 
>> ARTICLE
Expect some great action scenes and production quality. I hope you will like it. Just don't expect too much from the characters. The mc's only phrase is "I am Gundam" ;P
>> ARTICLE
Haha sounds great. I'll check it out after I catch up on a few things and PM you about it. :D
>> ARTICLE
Sure, which anime do you mean with catching up if I may ask? I am kinda curious :P
>> ARTICLE
Oh I was planning on watching some Ghibli movies since I've only seen My Neighbor Totoro, specifically Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I love Princess Mononoke! It's fascinating. Spirited Away is failure proof also. Have fun with them.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, will do! As always, it's been a pleasure talking to you. See ya around! :)
>> ARTICLE
I might need to watch that cause, at the moment, I have no hope for humanity.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, definitely recommended. Just finished my Gundam 00 rewatch and it was awesome. It has actually less philosophy and more action than some other ones in the series, but it's still a great way to get into the series.
>> ARTICLE
Watching the random scientists continuously develop mobile suits in the first season of Gundam 00 was both really awesome and a great way to show that progress goes on no matter what Celestial Being tries to do with their interventions.
>> ARTICLE
Was it Unicorn or 00?
>> ARTICLE
Both. Both are great series, but the Unicorn mc was lacking imo.
>> ARTICLE
Problem with Unicorn is that there's another war 27 years after it. Unicorn talked a whole bunch about the possibility for humans to change, but because of where it lands in the timeline it undermines its own message. Can't say much about 00 because I didn't make it past the first couple of episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Point of the Unicorn was to end the cycle of hatred. Cosmo Babylonia war was not because of cycle of hatred, it was because they were assholes. Also, 25 years of peace is pretty great for UC anyway.
>> ARTICLE
That was the point of Char's Counterattack too, but that sure didn't stick. The fact Unicorn happens so soon after it actually trivializes both [CCA spoilers](/s "Amuro's sacrifice to stop Axis and the emotional impact of the Axis Shock"). Unicorn played with newtypes pretty much the same way that Gundam has been using them for 35 years, and it gets less effective with each iteration. After a certain point you start to see a disconnect between what the shows tell you they are (potential agents for change and understanding) and what you actually see (borderline psychopaths bent on genocide of some kind or moody teenage ace pilots). 
>> ARTICLE
Oh really, I didn't know. I am planning to catch up with the older Gundams soon. I always liked the message behind each of them even though I only watched Seed/00/Unicorn. I see from your MAL that you have much more experience than me with the franchise.
>> ARTICLE
The message is pretty similar in most Gundam shows, at least the ones where newtypes exist. It works best in the original I think, where they didn't know there would be any sequels at all, and in Char's Counterattack, which had a great finale that was intended to be the end of all the conflicts in the timeline (until it proved too profitable to kill off). Gundam's always had this sort of weird disconnect between a message that war is horrible and we have to understand each other and its marketing based around selling cool mobile suit model kits and releasing a new series every couple of years. 
>> ARTICLE
If you liked Unicorn, you should definitely watch the previous Universal Century Gundam seasons. Unicorn is a love letter to the other works in its timeline, both past and future, so seeing them will add a lot to Unicorn if you already think it's great!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, definitely gonna catch up with the UC timeline. I think I will rewatch Unicorn afterwards too. Thanks for the information!

I though I would never cry for a series ever again after finishing Elfen Lied, then Clannad came and kicked the shit out of me.

Did you cry after finishing the Anime of Elfen lied, or the Manga ? (If not, go and read the manga, it has more nightmare fuel and a much better bittersweet ending)

Oh, I cried after the anime, and yeah, I've been wanting to read the manga, even tho reading is not my thing.

Shirobako- When that list came out about how much anime artist make. It really surprised me. I mean how can they live off of that. It really hit home that a lot of these artiest do what that do for the love it, because there sure is no money going there way. 
>> ARTICLE
For me it changed the way I look at working. Seeing their motivation gave me new look on the way I do things. I guess I will have to change my work some time in the future. Not now tho, cause I'm still lacking necessary skills, but I think I have some goal now.

Oh man, sounds like I really need to watch Shirobako. I hear a lot of good things about it too.

I would it really is good look into the making of anime what it takes to put one out. Not only that but a lot of the characters on the show are real people in the industry.

Princess Mononoke made me see how predictable the plots of most movies are. They all tell a streamlined story of good vs evil more or less, the characters surrounding the main characters are flat. Mononoke tells a story where the characters have depth and motivation. Its more real. Sometimes life isn't a zero some game. Everyone can win... or loose.

No one seems to have mentioned the Monogatari Series in a serious note. The whole series is designed to check with your moral compass.

FS/N Universe - So many interesting themes, and ideals in there. 

kara no kyoukai - Again Naru knows how to tackle aspects of the self

Clannad - Never thought I could get such an emotional connection to an
anime

Psycho Pass/ Shinseki no yori - Both blew my mind. 

Evangelion. I could go on forever, but it's show's like the one's I've mentioned that show in my mind that anime is am artistic medium that can truly hit depths others can't.

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya

The endless eight arc and Haruhi's little backstory she gives in the beginning are what inspired me.  

I always thought my life was so interesting and the people around me at school were like no other until I came to the same realization as Haruhi.  That the stuff I see happens at every school, every where.  Idk, her back story just made me realize how mundane everyone's lives are.  Almost every person gets up in the morning, brushes their teeth, showers, gets dressed and ready to go to work or school.  The only way to make things different and special is to work for it like Haruhi does.

The endless eight arc, or rather the beginning of it inspired me to create a list of what to do during my last two weeks of summer with friends, do them all, have a blast, and a desire to relive them all over again(though hopefully not really).

Also, Naruto is another series.  I hate most of the characters, but Naruto's go-getting "Believe it!" attitude has always made me want to do my best.  It's not the first anime I watched, but it's the one that really got me into anime, manga, and the first series I started to watch in Japanese with subs online rather than wait for the eng dub to air on Toonami.

TTGL taught me not to worry about the "what ifs" and "should haves". Whatever I did/do is the truth of my universe and that there is always someone who can believe in me: Myself.

Yamadas first time changed my perspective on love and Welcome to the NHK changed my perspective on friendships and relationships. Both of those shows changed these perspectives for the better, however.

No, he's talking about [B Gata H Kei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7817/B_Gata_H_Kei) which was titled Yamada's First Time' on the western releases (licensed by FUNimation). The show about the witches you're thinking about is [Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20359/Yamada-kun_to_7-nin_no_Majo) (Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo).

*Perfect Blue* opened my eyes to many of the negative affects that celebrity fandom can have on said celebrities and their personal lives.  Watching Mima sit in her apartment obsessively reading forum posts about her own life is hardly far-fetched in this day and age, as were the behavior of those jack-asses in the opening performance who started throwing bottles and other things at the stage during CHAM's final performance as a trio.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I can name quite a few. 

1. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica - I now think twice before judging something by looks after watching this. TWICE. 

2. Haibane Renmei - [I've summarized this in a short blog post](http://www.warunonair.com/2015/03/anime-recommendation-haibane-renmei.html)

3. Dennou Coil - [spoilers](/s "when Yasako's mom explains why dogs die earlier than humans, that was quite an eye opener, I always thought it's too depressing to get a pet and then have to see it die. It's that way because, humans are strong enough to endure it unlike dogs")

Shinsekai Yori is my favorite anime and it has taught me just how fked up humans; we are all extremely hypocritical and power can easily warp our minds to commit horrible deeds. Furthermore, it made me realize how judgemental and heartless humans are even though they don't know the person or they attack them verbally due to their outside appearances. Nearly every time I go online, I will witness someone being harassed by another person due to the reasons I stated above. As a result, the phrase, "Don't judge a book by its cover," has truly stuck with me so I that I will less likely carry out despicable acts like those in Shinsekai Yori and especially in reality.

I can list out even more lessons I learned from SSY but this one always lingers in my mind the most.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed the themes of Shinsekai Yori when I watched it. It was different than a lot of anime I had watched and its themes were brilliant. It has one of my most favourite anime quotes too, "We ultimatelyfearwhat spawns from within us."

Himegoto was pretty meh overall, but it did add a certain fetish to the list...

Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggann changed my whole perspective on [Spoilers?](/s "doing things I never thought I could do, but with enough perseverance I can break past barriers I thought were unbreakable.")  This anime helped me pull myself out of my 3-4 year depression while I was in Jr. high/highschool.  I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it and likes over the top mecha action.  One Piece to a lesser degree, changed my outlook on treating close friends like family to a certain extent, if someone fucks with my close friend he also fucks with me, and everyone else who is close to that friend.

Watching Barakamon. I never got the whole calligraphy thing and was plenty surprised how good and informative it was.

Boring samey answer for me, but Welcome to the NHK taught me the importance of struggling. [NHK Spoilers just in case](/s "Satou and Misaki found some semblance of stability in their lives, what with Satou finding a job and Misaki... well... taking lessons from Satou I guess? But it's clear that neither of them is happy. They're still struggling. They're still lost. They're still riddled with fears and insecurities. But now they know that they are important to each other and that's enough for now. But tomorrow? Who knows? They certainly don't. They'll just keep on struggling.")

Personally I much prefer this type of uncertain ending to the triumphant "hero conquers all his dreams and fears and gets the girl and it is ambiguously implied that they'll be happy forever since she was his childhood friend and/or other characters in the story reaffirmed that they care about each other". The latter may be more upbeat and there is certainly value in that, but the former is more honest.
>> ARTICLE
JoJo taught me that side characters should be just as important as the main character, and made me understand why so many people are attracted to the old fox look ^Joseph ^^is ^^^so ^^^^handsome...


Kill La Kill taught me to not take a show at it's face value and that anything no matter how strange and off putting the concept is, can be awesome if done right.


And Steins;gate reaffirmed my belief that Time travel is the best plot point if it is done right, and will always be the hook that can drawn me in the hardest (Probably because I'm British and Doctor Who has influenced our culture for decades.)

Gintama! 

Gintoki (in particular) helps to keep me positive and I tend to remember the profound things he spouts out now and then when I'm feeling down.

YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.

This is exactly what Tatami needs: exposure. It's one of (if not the) best anime in existence, and very few people watch it, just because they don't know it, or are taken back because of the artstyle and the fast talking  (wich are two of the best part of the show, after a couple of episodes you'll understand why).

I encourage EVERYONE who hasn't seen it to give it a try. **It's just 11 episodes**, people, and most of the people who've seen it have given it a 9 or a 10. **It's worth every second of your time.**

Count me in!

EDIT: Btw, this is one of those anime that's perfect for a rewatch schedule. It's not episodic enough to be repetitive, but it's got no cliffhungers and stuff that make you marathon it at once (Although some people like myself just couldn't contain themselves and binged it in one day). It's perfect for 1 episode a day.

Yeah, that's the problem. I don't want to start any other rewatch right after this one because of the popular Ghost in the Shell rewatch that will be going on.

It will be your first time but you are hosting the rewatch?

>> ARTICLE
Yup! I did the exact same thing with the Kara no Kyoukai rewatch which actually ended yesterday!

Besides, I don't think me watching it for the first time has anything to do with me hosting it. It's like if I went up to all the first-timers and said:

"Hey, you're not supposed to be here! This is a *REWATCH* thread, DUH!"

Also, if no one else is hosting a rewatch for this show, then I don't see the problem with me being the one to do it!

(Also, if you asked that because of my downvotes, those actually came from me saying a somewhat inappropriate joke so I edited it to what it currently is now. They're not from me saying that it's my first time.)

Oh no I had no problem with it.  I was just saying because i was worried that the downvotes were indicative that other people might of had a problem with it and so it would be hurting the rewatch.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I see. Thanks for the clarification!

You could watch it on youtube and set the speed to 0.5 if it's a big problem
>> ARTICLE
I guess you could watch with your hand on the space bar to pause it frequently.
>> ARTICLE
That would kind of ruin it for me. The problem isn't that I can't read it I just want to be able to enjoy the whole experience. But since it's so fast my eye's will be glued to the bottom third of the screen.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I do remember missing out on a lot of the cool visuals because I was trying to read. Unfortunately I don't see any kind of dub in the near future.
>> ARTICLE
Sure I'll join, Iv'e been planning to watch this anime for some time now.
>> ARTICLE
im planning on starting it soon, so anytime you'd like it would be apreciated.

just one question tho is the dialogue unbearable to get through? cause from the first scene it was really really fast, is it always like that or just in monologues?
>> ARTICLE
It's in my queue, so yeah I'll join 
>> ARTICLE
Awesome I was going to start watching this show today but I mine as well wait for the 17th.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty happy about this, cause I keep putting it off, and this gives me an excuse to watch it :P
>> ARTICLE
Never seen it, I'm down
>> ARTICLE
I've got some free time to catch up with my list so I'm all for it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes plz
>> ARTICLE
Count me in

>> ARTICLE
Litttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt.
>> ARTICLE
Was just thinking of watching this too. Guess I'll join up for this! :D
>> ARTICLE
Never seen it before. I'm in.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I thought the anime had something to do about space so avoided it. I read the description and it sounds good, so I'm down. 
>> ARTICLE
I would join as I never watched it and is highly recommended by many people. But I would prefer one episode every 2-3 days at least :S
>> ARTICLE
I think 1 episode a day is good enough. It's just taking 24 minutes out of your day for 11 days so it shouldn't be too hard to keep up. Also, when discussions have 2-3 days in between them, they slowly start to lose interest and people either drop or binge the show.

Sorry if the schedule isn't what you'd prefer, but I hope you can still make it to the discussions! :)
>> ARTICLE
I would. I have been hearing good things about it on this sub so I might just be more eager to check it out if I can participate in discussion while watching.
>> ARTICLE
Count me in! 
>> ARTICLE
Have yet to see it, heard a lot of praise, so count me in I guess!
>> ARTICLE
I planned on binging the entire thing tomorrow, so I guess I won't join the rewatch. Or maybe I will. 20 minutes per day is a very small amount of time, but idk, I still haven't seen it.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I guess...

Who am I kidding, just look at my username, I was born for this!
>> ARTICLE
I've been meaning to rewatch this for a while (I've even started a couple of times, but have only made it about five or six episodes before life gets in the way); this should give me the push I need to make it all the way through. I'm in!
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to do these rewatches but I always somehow fall behind. ;_:
>> ARTICLE
It's alright you can do it! Just 24 minutes a day for 11 days and that's it! I believe in you my friend!

JUSY DO IT!
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's not that I don't have enough free time. I was doing the recent Kara no Kyoukai rewatch but I ended up stopping at movie #4, not because it was boring but I tend to get distracted so easily and forget to finish. :(
>> ARTICLE
Oh cool, I hosted the Kara no Kyoukai rewatch too. :D

It seriously pays off in the end it is AMAZING. I really think you should go ahead and finish it. Then after that, join this rewatch!
>> ARTICLE
Yo, I'll bring the cake and honey-treats.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, so i can validate it has nothing on Evangelion.

But i know this already.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa whoa whoa. That's just, like, your opinion, man.
>> ARTICLE
way too many rematch going on all at once

>> ARTICLE
K-ON! Because one does not simply finish K-ON!, you start over once you finish it, and then again and again and again...
>> ARTICLE
Just started K-ON! a few days ago. One does not simply watch just one episode (or two, or three...). Seriously, I caved in and decided to watch the first episode to see what all the fuss was about. Next thing I knew it was almost 4:00am...
>> ARTICLE
But why is  this!? I initially completely avoided K-ON! because I knew it would happen, but for some damned reason I decided to give it a go and ended up marathoning the whole bloody series. I'm sorry, but dare I say it, IT'S NOT EVEN THAT GOOD OF A SHOW.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi, I have loved every episode that I've watched but damn is it depressing.
>> ARTICLE
I came here to post this, I love the show but god damn it's slow.
>> ARTICLE
I felt like that was part of the beauty of the show. I enjoyed that, just like with nature in real life, the mushi often had negative effects that they had no intention of causing. It was just the circle of life, and the fact that the depressing stories left me with no one to hate for them was actually refreshing.

>> ARTICLE
It's also very slow. It helps to have one other calm friend watch it with you and some tea.
>> ARTICLE
The day I find a calm friend and brew tea to watch anime is the day I stop watching anime
>> ARTICLE
I'm probably missing something here, but I'll ask anyway.

Why?
>> ARTICLE
Pls sit down and finish Tatami... now!
>> ARTICLE
Please convince me. I also started it, but I was sooo fast I had to keep hitting pause to keep up with the subs, I decided the original understanding of Japanese language was a major factor in the experience of the show. But I'd really love a good reason to watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
The number of fast-paced dialogues significantly decrease as the show goes on. Get past episode 2 and it should be a lot better.
>> ARTICLE
It's a fascinating and intelligent show with genuine and unforced humor, that builds an intricate and pleasant narrative layer by layer through each successive episode and finally becomes coherent near the end. When the ending rolls you'll likely be highly impressed with what it accomplished.
>> ARTICLE
Also, although the subs are pretty fast-paced throughout, there are areas of rest which provoke thought for the character and the watcher and advance the story and char. development in a fantastic way.

And the subs do get easier to read after the first couple of eps when you get used to the speed. 
>> ARTICLE
Clannad, I know a lot of people love it to death but I just can't get my self to finish it
>> ARTICLE
Same, just can't finish it. 
>> ARTICLE
I cant even get myself to start the second episode :/
>> ARTICLE
Same. It's been over a year and I still haven't picked it up again. I'm on ~17 or so and have gotten through every route in the VN except for Nagisa's. I always tell myself that I'll finish the VN before the anime, but then I never make any progress on the VN.

._.
>> ARTICLE
I had to force my way through Clanned. It just didn't get any better and each time I'd finish an arc I thought the next would be better or have some relevance to the overall story. Sadly I didn't like any of the characters but I didn't hate them either (other then Fuka after her arc was over). It was just a "meh" series. I can see why people would like it though. 
>> ARTICLE
Exactly how I felt about it 
>> ARTICLE
**One Piece**

I've rushed through 100 episodes on 3 days and I've gone a month without watching a single episode. Currently I'm at 638 while the most recent episode was 654, and yet I feel like I haven't gotten closer to getting by any more than 100 episodes back.
>> ARTICLE
I have this weird relationship with the show where I watch 40 episodes in a week then put it down for a month or two.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the only way I'm going to catch up with Hunter x Hunter is if I put every other show I'm watching on-hold.
>> ARTICLE
Ima get downvoted, but I really didnt find hunter interesting or fun at all. I'm up to date, but it just seems to be a rehash of dbz.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it just for that sneaking suspicion.  Why watch a relatively good shonen when I can watch shows that are better than any shonen?
>> ARTICLE
That's my opinion on it as well. So many good shows already out there and so many shows that are coming out at the same time that are much better(I.e. Kill la kill, attack on Titan, no game no life). Again that is just my opinion
>> ARTICLE
exactly what im doing now, its hard to ignore shows like Tokyo ghoul that have been huge this summer but i just have to catch up with HxH 
>> ARTICLE
I'm at ep 55 atm. I hope to close up soon XD
>> ARTICLE
Worth it ;D
>> ARTICLE
You're right, I watched it in 10 days up to 137

just watched 139!!
>> ARTICLE
Yah, I started watching it about a year and a half ago, and caught up in about a week- and that's as someone who  really hates watching anime on the computer. Usually, if I can't see it on my TV, I wind up droping it after 5 or so episodes. But HxH was special man ;u;
>> ARTICLE
get a wii u  and watch it on your tv :P
>> ARTICLE
I had the means to do something like that before, just not the brains to think to xD

I was crazy excited when I got to watch it "on the big screen" after I figured out how to stream it though my Playstation :P
>> ARTICLE
If you have a modern TV and laptop, you could buy a HDMI wire to simply stream from one to the other.
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no Asukara. No real reason- I enjoyed watching it while it was airing, but I stopped for a while and never started again. 

Keep meaning to...just... haven't... >:
>> ARTICLE
I finished it somehow or another. I shouldn't have bothered though.
>> ARTICLE
Wow same here. I also enjoyed watching it, but somehow I also stopped watching at some point.
>> ARTICLE
I stopped halfway through the second arc of Accel World. That little punk of a villain is too much. Smug 14 year olds should stay on 4chan and out of my anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching Gintama since May. I've been watching it steadily but it just keeps coming. I only just got to Gintama' so the end is in sight but holly molly.
>> ARTICLE
there's no shame in slowly watching comedy, especially Gintama. Binge watching any comedy will make it less amusing

>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I couldn't make it past the second season of Index either. As much as I love the novelty of atheism punching Christianity in the face, there isn't much to keep me interested.

[Are you *sure* it doesn't get old?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCjcF9FpCQQ&t=0m17s)  Cause I could watch this video on a loop for hours.
>> ARTICLE
Im currently on episode ~10 on index. Its so painful to get through but i heard it gets better. Funny enough,  I loved Railgun series (especially season 2).
>> ARTICLE
I *really* had to push myself to finish it. Really liked the beginning, but the 2nd half was so painful. Every single character annoyed me to know end. Especially the flower girl and her constant anime-grunting and complaining. Like honestly, I've never seen those anime-noises so overdone in any other anime.
>> ARTICLE
>2nd Half was painful 
Congrats, you enjoyed the adaptation of the manga, and didn't enjoy the filler :D. The same happens with Railgun S. First 16 Eps adapt the manga (And are great), and the rest are some silly spinoff arc.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say its worth watching just for Railgun S because that first arc is the best part of the whole Raildex series imo.
>> ARTICLE
Legend of Galactic Heroes

110 episodes and pretty much as many characters
>> ARTICLE
School Days.

Naive me from a few months ago said "man, this show is supposed to be awful, imma watch it". I've been at episode six for quite some time now, though I still wanna finish it.
>> ARTICLE
I was in the same boat as you and decided to finish the series. I want my time back. Only series where I regretted finishing.
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of boats...
>> ARTICLE
Wow. That wasn't even intentional. 
>> ARTICLE
Fairy tale i just got so bored of it somewhere between episode 120-135
>> ARTICLE
I got bored after 8 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I put Kill La Kill on hold after watching the first 11 episodes, I'm not even sure why to be honest since I was enjoying it.  However whenever I think about picking it back up, I find something more interesting to watch.  And now that I've picked up ~14 shows this summer, I'm even less likely to actually pick it up again for a while.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, episodes 4-11 are pretty weak, in my opinion. It's kinda funny that you dropped it right before it started getting good, though.
>> ARTICLE
DON'T LOSE YOUR WAY
>> ARTICLE
You would be doing yourself a disservice by not finishing that show, trust me :D
>> ARTICLE
It makes a turn for the awesome after about ep12 or 13 there is a big twist I won't spoil for you. You won't regret finishing it, I loved it.
>> ARTICLE
I've been procrastinating Clannad, Ping Pong the animation and Fate/Stay Night, which I recently discovered was tied to Fate/Zero. It feels more like a chore to finish them, than an actual enjoyment, I do it more for the cultural value than for the earnest entertainment. 
>> ARTICLE
Hold off on Fate/Stay night for the moment. It's not bad, but if you are expecting Fate/Zero level of quality, you're not going to get it. Wait for the new remake this fall, or check out the VN if you can.
>> ARTICLE
Remake? As in all of Fate/Stay night?

>> ARTICLE
No one knows precisely which route they are adapting, but they've said that this time will be a completely new adaptation that blends elements from all three routes, so it's probably worth waiting for. 

Plus, even if they just gave the 2006 version improved quality, it's still going to be worth it. Technology has changed alot in the past 8 years.
>> ARTICLE
Yep this october
>> ARTICLE
D-Gray Man .... i just c-c-ant FINISH IT!
>> ARTICLE
You're not missing much, assuming it's like the manga.

i've tried 3 different times and can't get past the 5th or 6th ep

Same here, except that I only tried once

 Chobits. Started it back in 2012 and I still haven't finished it.

It gets a little odd at the end, but it's good regardless.

ahahhahahahah chobits

Clannad After Story. I watch one episode a week because the feels are too much.
>> ARTICLE
Being the true fool I am I marathoned it the first time around. Had to go hug my Dad afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if I have it in me to finish it. I'm on episode 10 and it doesn't get better
>> ARTICLE
Finish it, it's an experience and it really is worth it. Plus, though controversial, it has a nice resolution at the end.
>> ARTICLE
One piece Kappa
>> ARTICLE
Golden Time. 
I watched every episode except for the last one, for some reason I just don't want to. Probably because it's obvious how it's going to play out.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it's kind of obvious, but the way by which that ending occurs was kind of interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I should add that it kind of felt like it should end where it did. It's a situation whwre if you decided to stop watching there, it would work.
>> ARTICLE
Watamote.  It's funny, but I'm starting to feel sorry for MC and I want bad things to stop happening to her.  

That [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAIAXFQ0T74), though.
>> ARTICLE
The struggle is real brother, that's the kind of show you shouldn't binge watch, it just a lot to handle. 
>> ARTICLE
My unfinished anime list is gigantic and grows every season. Sometimes I get seriously close to the end of a show before dropping it (dropped Mekaku at episode 10, Railgun S at episode 21, Golden Time at episode 22 Kyoukai no Kanata at the final episode). If you just really aren't feeling it, you gotta stop wasting your time. Life is too short for bad anime.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why people are downvoting you....

I'm the same way. You only have a set amount of hours in your life. If I don't like an anime I'm not going to suffer through it. 
>> ARTICLE
Terra e... i've been watching it for about six months now, it's good but not so exciting 
>> ARTICLE
Occasionally I don't finish a series for a very long time because I like it so much. Kind of dumb heh.
>> ARTICLE
Neo Ranga. It's not a dumb show, but the passing is too slow and the animation was bare bones cheap when it was made.
>> ARTICLE
Soul eater not! I knew it was a spin off but I couldn't stand the new art style and the change in quality of the series 
>> ARTICLE
Black Bullet; the overall premise of the show seemed very interesting at first. I tried to immerse myself in the show's universe, but by episode three I just couldn't keep watching. Perhaps one day I'll attempt to continue it. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't bother- you're not missing anything -_-

Cliche charterers and a lot of conversations about Kisara's boobs. That's about it.

I thought it started off pretty strong too, so I was pretty disappointed :T
>> ARTICLE
You forgot the loli army. ~~Arguably~~ the best part of the show ;)
>> ARTICLE
Thats what the whole show seemed to base around
>> ARTICLE
[Definately.](http://www.gfycat.com/MenacingVerifiableAmericanbulldog)
>> ARTICLE
Not worth it. The entire show is split basically into two, first off being serious with character traumas whereas the other half is light-hearted, somewhat filler which makes the serious scenes seem obsolete and misplaced.

5/10 - Probably won't watch season 2 if it is ever made 
>> ARTICLE
I've been trying to finish YuYuShiki.  I like the charming art style and funny main characters, but the story is just so generic.  Honestly, when I watch it, I'm just thinking, "Gee, I'd really rather be watching Nichijou, right now."
>> ARTICLE
But... YuYuShiki doesn't even have a story....
>> ARTICLE
I guess so.  Maybe that's why it's so hard to watch for me
>> ARTICLE
ngel beats dont ask me why I stopped watching and then can't seems to get up to finish it 
>> ARTICLE
Majustsu no Index I. I have never finished the last 4 episodes. I simply don't feel like anything *happens* in that anime. Even the part that covered Railgun S's arc (which i watched before watching Majutsu) didn't feel noteworthy.
>> ARTICLE
I stopped watching Higurashi Kai at like episode 22 or so. The mystery was solved, it got boring, and I couldn't muster up the effort to continue. It's kinda annoying, because I really liked the first season, but the second just felt so different.
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Champloo, I'm on 19 I think, and I've just stopped watching it. I really liked it too, I just don't want to watch more right now :(
>> ARTICLE
The melancholy of Haruhi suzimiya. I slogged my way through the endless eight then gave up. You'd think that I'd keep going after the hard part, but I can only stomach a few minutes at a time without getting flashbacks. Kyon-kun denwa!
>> ARTICLE
There are only a few more episodes after Endless Eight. I think it's one more arc then the disappearance movie. 
>> ARTICLE
You really should finish it then watch the movie.
Makes it all worth it.
>> ARTICLE
I heard the movie was really good, so I may, hypothetically, have skipped the rest of the series and gone straight to the movie. And I may have enjoyed the movie far more than I was enjoying the show.
>> ARTICLE
You missed out on a lot then.
>> ARTICLE
I am fairly sure I understood everything in the movie, so I don't think I missed out on that much. I will eventually get around to watching it all, it's just going to be at a slow and steady pace.
>> ARTICLE
Ano Hana.

The anime was just too fucking slow and this is coming from a guy who marathon 100+ episodes of Hunter X Hunter during spring break.
>> ARTICLE
[Suzuka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/390/Suzuka)

My friend highly recommended it to me so I started watching, It was okay for the first 8 episodes but for some reason I just can't bring myself to finish it. Another interesting fact is that I also dropped [Kimi no Iru Machi](http://myanimelist.net/manga/8483/Kimi_no_Iru_Machi), which was written by the same author.
>> ARTICLE
I've been watching [Excel Saga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/379/Heppoko_Jikken_Animation_Excel_Saga) for the last 4 years and still haven't finished it.

Penguindrum and sakuraso. Idk why but I just can't get myself to finish them off.

Ouran High School Host Club because I don't want it to end. I'm savoring the last few episodes.

I've been watching Legend of the Galactic Heroes on and off for around 6 months now.  It's just too dense for me to marathon.

detective conan. im currently on episode 705 and i feel as if its been atleast a  year and a half since i last watched an episode. The plot struggle is real....
>> ARTICLE
Pet Girl of Sakaurasou. I Really like it, I just can't get past the halfway point for some reason. Have tried multiple times but can't do it.
>> ARTICLE
I have been really struggling to finish TTGL, even though everyone here loves it to death... i cant get myself to like it and it was the first anime that i put on hold ever, which saddens me even more. I dont dislike mecha per se but the whole story seems so incredible st****. The characters dont do it for me either. The little one is afraid of everything, big bro is annoying and the villains look like stuffed animals
>> ARTICLE
Clannad because its just so slowAngel beats because I don't want it to endSoul eater because Its boring and I don't like the characters Naruto because the second series sucksOne peice because its too long(this is only MY opinion please don't hate me)
>> ARTICLE
Fairy Tail S1. I stopped at EP 66.

Monster. Stopped at EP 41.
>> ARTICLE
Mouretsu Pirates (hope I spelled that right)

It's not really that bad, but I'm at episode 20 IIRC and I just cannot find any reason to finish it. There's nothing to keep me going.
>> ARTICLE
Hyoka.. It's not like I don't like the story or anything, but with episodic nature of anime I don't have the motivation to watch the next episode of it, so I just start watching something else. 
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion :3
>> ARTICLE
really? thats a surprising one honestly. 

>> ARTICLE
I got bored as fuck about the 15th or 16th episode. couldnt watch further. 
>> ARTICLE
...But that's literally *exactly* where it launches into the twists that make it special!

Ach. Shame.
>> ARTICLE
The series takes a sharp focus turn at this point. It's less about the Angels and more about the pilots and staff. I want to say more but I don't want to spoil anything.
>> ARTICLE
Id suggest the Rebuild movies then. They take a different approach to the series so you wont really be lost. Also its a huge eyegasm, so even if you dont like the story you will enjoy the animation/art. Currently 3/4 movies are out though
>> ARTICLE
JoJo's Bazaar Adventure.

>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill and Trigun. I've been told that Kill la Kill starts to suck midway through and Trigun, though super badass and I love it, is just easy to put down for a while.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill does *not* suck halfway through. After Ep 15 it gets a lot better and the plot begins to thicken and is easily binge watchable.
>> ARTICLE
Whoever told you that about KLK is weird. 
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate, after [Spoiler](/s "Mayuri dies"), it just gets sort of boring. 
>> ARTICLE
How can you put it on hold after watching that episode?
>> ARTICLE
I didn't caaaaaaaare.
>> ARTICLE
Good reason to stop then. 
>> ARTICLE
What if I told you it will all be daijobu?
>> ARTICLE
....Steins Gate

Not even ashamed to admit it. I've seen a lot of anime and holy hell are these starting episodes boring. 
>> ARTICLE
It's astonishingly dull for the first ~11 episodes. 

Recommend watching the dub, rather than the sub- the conversations flow a lot better. The translation's excellent. 

Well worth persevering with, though. 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I felt the same way my first time through. All you have to do is power through until the show really hits its stride around episode 12. However, after watching the entire show, go back and look back at those episodes, they won't be boring anymore.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't bother to try and power through. I don't like most of the characters enough.
>> ARTICLE
>go back and look back at those episodes, they won't be boring anymore.

I must have rewatched the series at least 4 times by now, be it showing it to friends, episodes randomly on TV when I'm home, or when work gets REALLY slow. The first episodes become better each time
>> ARTICLE
How far in are you? It gets better.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;gate, scientific railgun, a magical index, and toradora. 
>> ARTICLE
What episode of Steins;gate? It was similarly difficult to go through, but the harem-like elements and messing around disappear episode 12 and are not intrusive when they do show up later.
>> ARTICLE
Not 100% sure, just that it's between ep 11-13 that I stop with steins;gate. I might try the series again on Wednesday with a few other redditors. 
>> ARTICLE
Interesting timing to drop off, that's for sure. For me, it took me a week to get through the 1st 8 episodes (which is a LONG time for me). But then I ended up finishing the rest in one day.
>> ARTICLE
I found it a slog getting through the first seven episodes, where little of note seemed to happen, but once the time travel really started I got hooked.
>> ARTICLE
I stopped at episode 7 of Psycho Pass and like episode 4 of Kill la Kill.
>> ARTICLE
Go watch them now , how can someone drop 2 great shows !?
>> ARTICLE
If you didn't like them at that point you're not going to. What you see is what you get. While they do get better it's not by leaps and bounds.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop and Utena. Im at 10/24 and 4/39 on both and everytime I go to watch the next episode I get bored 3 min in and go do something else. I've been trying to finish Bebop for the past 3 years. 
>> ARTICLE
Me too I cant seem to finish cowboy bebob I should but havent its been like 2 months since I watched the 11 episode
>> ARTICLE
I had gotten to episode 16 of Hanasaku Iroha when I realized I was wasting my time.

I'm in. First time watcher. Very excited.

Re-watchers, please restrain yourselves from the urge to hint and hype upcoming events, I want to go into every episode with zero expectations. (Remember the Code Geass re-watch full of "ooh you first-timers just wait until next episode blah blah!" ... yeah, let's not have that shit)

Yes, I agree.

What he said, rewatchers!

All who haven't seen it, this is your opportunity. It's right in front of you, so grab it.

[TTG general spoilers](/s "While it's funny to rewatchers, can we hold back on running jokes like this in the discussion until they're established in the series so we don't spoil them for first-timers?")
>> ARTICLE
I honestly don't really like "rewatch" threads because it's made up of a lot of newbies and the people who have watched the show drown out the threads with 10 page summaries of the "symbolism."

I dunno, I guess I just like reading what first-time watchers say more than the people who know everything about the show already.

I was about to start TTG tonight, guess I'll wait till tomorrow then!

I look forward to the discussion posts with the rest of you! :)
>> ARTICLE
Anyone thats relatively new to anime or just doesn't read subtitles very quickly, be sure to hold on to your pause buttons because the narrator talks fast
>> ARTICLE
This. Though you might get accustomed to it; after about an episode and a half I found I could keep up with things properly. Just be prepared for it, because the narrator comes out of the gate  sprinting.
>> ARTICLE
Rose-colored glasses will be provided at the door. 

This is one of those that needs to be rewatched even more than it needs to be watched, so I'm gonna do that. 
>> ARTICLE
This may or may not be the first re-watch where I'm present from start to finish... but it will most likely not be.
>> ARTICLE
I always manage the first 1-3 episodes, after that I just binge most of the time.
>> ARTICLE
Okay. I'm in. Count me in. I'll do my best to stick with the schedule. 

I'll also try to do more in-depth posts each episode, although it might be a bit too much for me. Anyway, I'm looking forward to this. The synopsis makes me think I'll like it a lot, since I finished my second year in University a couple of months ago. 

After hearing so many good things about it, I'll finally get around watching this. Damn, I'm excited!
>> ARTICLE
It's really perfect for those around that age, it's much more likely to resonate with you.

I hope I don't binge watch that shit. 

Falling behind? I can live with that, just have to catch up. 

The fear of binge watching this though... I don't want to be all alone the first day with so many things to talk about (if I ever find something to talk about that is). 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I don't think it has that "binge-worthy" quality. To be very light on spoilers, it's an episodic series so each episode ends in a satisfying manner rather than an urge to watch the next one.
>> ARTICLE
But what if like being satisfied?! 

I hope you're right though. I want it to last as long as possible. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching it this morning lol
>> ARTICLE
Time to rewatch! Yay!

I
>> ARTICLE
It's not that long since I watched it first time but I think it still might be worth it to watch it once more since there's bound to be stuff I missed. 

I made some gifs the first time I watched it so I might make more of them since they'll most likely be better this time. 

Time of the discussions seem fine to me although I prefer to watch shows like these during night time for me so I'll probably be late to threads or watch the night before. 

Hopefully we get a bunch of first time watchers since I'd say this is one of the "must watch" shows.
>> ARTICLE
You can watch the episode the night before and then discuss it the next day. I do that during rewatches because, like you, I enjoy watching anime at night as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I guess that is the *better* option. Just need to remember to write something down at the time or else I'd most certainly forget.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I've done for 90% of the rewatches I've been in. I know I'm not the only one, as that's how you end up with several multi-page comments within a few minutes of an episode thread going up.
>> ARTICLE
Was gonna wait till after i graduate high school since it looks like a college related anime, but ill join this with you guys!
>> ARTICLE
It is, but to a degree it can apply to high school as well. Also good to watch *before* starting college anyway.
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher hype! This will be the first of these that I participate in so I am looking forward to it. I honestly can't promise I will be able to hold myself to 1 episode a day being as I'm a major binge watcher and have been binging a ton of shows these past couple of weeks but I will try my best!
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy...looking like I might have to join this...

At least it's not Nana, right?

Haha really hope it's better than that :p

Should be fun!

Wasn't Amagami SS Tier huh? ;)

Was super long, more bad than good and just never had too much fun watching haha so yeah not on Amagami's level :p

I recently watched Amagami SS because of you.

After watching the Imouto episode, OVA, second season, specials and the picture drama, I have to thank you. Amagami SS is AMAZING. Every girl is best girl!

I'm really tempted to join in despite watching it for the first time just over a month ago. *It's that good,* anyone that hasn't seen it yet.

Its amazing guys. Its somewhat unconventional, but its one of the most highly acclaimed series for a reason.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, what the hell. Been meaning to watch it anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Guess I'll join in. Just read the description at MAL and I feel like this is gonna be my kind of show, don't know why. 

I do remember though how Madoka destroyed my feels center, and I still hold you responsible for that r/anime. 

SO IF THIS IS GONNA MAKE ME CRY AGAIN I'LL BE ANGRY!!!

>> ARTICLE
I see this at the top of a certain anime channel's Top Anime videos, and the OP is by Asian Kung-Fu Generation (they did the best FMA 2003 OP), so it's safe to say I'm pretty hyped for this.

The best part is that I know fuck-all about this anime, so I can be surprised when I watch it. Let's do this!

Right there with you guys

I'm looking forward to reading your analyses!

A lot of people are saying that this anime is good so I guess I'm in. I don't know a thing about this show besides the name and I intend to keep it that way until tomorrow.

I watched awhile ago and didn't really like it at all. I might give another try with the discussions.

Count me in :)!. First time watcher, very excited to watch it but sadly I'll have to do it later than you guys, since at that time I'm still in school :|.

I can still make a last minute change if it's more convenient for others. At what time do you get out of school?

At around 5 PM EST, so it might be a bit late for some people

Sorry, I guess I can't do much then. =/ At least you won't be *too* late because the discussion threads usually last for quite a while.

Another first time watcher here. I'm about to start my second year of college, and based on the MAL description, this is pretty much the perfect anime to watch now.

First time joining a rewatch, i'm don't really understand how it goes down. Is it one episode per day or how does it work, i don't really understand the format i the post :) 
>> ARTICLE
Yup, you got it. Starting tomorrow, we will be watching one episode a day. There are 11 episodes so it will take 11 days to cover all the discussion threads and then we will end with a final discussion about the whole series overall the day after the final episode.

[Well, that's rather ominous!](http://i.imgur.com/GxzpYTO.jpg) 


You know, [this could](http://i.imgur.com/C7gZ80k.jpg) be [something a bit familiar](http://i.imgur.com/BfIxepn.jpg)...

Ok, so after episode 3 with the birdman project and especially after last episode with Higuchi still being shown winning the bike race, similarities of the bike and library collection agencies and some other similarities I've had this thought going around that even if Watashi might rewind and do different things, what if all the other characters are not changing at all? ie, Akashi is part of Higuchi's cult AND working on the birdman project AND helping out with the movie crew sometimes. Jougamaki is the movie crew leader AND in the proxy war. All of this could be going on every time, somewhat statically, it's just Watashi that changes. 

Does that matter? I don't know!



[Seems safe enough](http://i.imgur.com/NbtKdDR.jpg)

[Here we go](http://i.imgur.com/H5g7vp7.jpg), [Watashi is overthinking things again.](http://i.imgur.com/BOG0mAa.jpg)

 Oh wow, [he was being literal back](http://i.imgur.com/ibMwU9p.jpg) when he said he was a honeybee.

[Is this one actually working?](http://i.imgur.com/zNM8YfT.jpg) No, no, it can't be that easy! 

Oh, nevermind, he's an outcast again. 

Now they're just saying nonsensical things in a forest. Is that what it means to be a bee?

Oh god, [this is a cult](http://i.imgur.com/5iTLcuZ.jpg), isn't it? A real cult, not that Higuchi vanilla crap, a crazy cult with crazy people!

How does Ozu even get accepted in a group like this???

STOP. BEING. SO. HAPPY. AAAAGGGHHHHHHH!

Okaaaaaay, sunshine girl. Weird. Not like Watashi needed even more girls to motivate him here, the club already had plenty of available ladies.

Hey! It's Neko Ramen! Good to see you again!

Oh, okay, it's not a cult. It's a [SCAM!](http://i.imgur.com/VULNMtw.png)

Watashi always says doing so-and-so would be dumb... and then does it anyways. What is wrong with you, dude?! Aaaaand now he's overworking himself at part-time jobs, just like with the bike. 

[There's no way I would still be surprised by that at this point.](http://i.imgur.com/wRo3o3d.png)

This has got to be the least likely route Watashi has taken so far to provide him the satisfying lifestyle he wants. 

[Creepy. As. Fuck.](http://i.imgur.com/a2XicC0.jpg)

Of course! [The oracle](http://i.imgur.com/uFWEEZr.jpg) was [Oculus](http://i.imgur.com/ErKgoHj.jpg)all along!

Oh shit! [IT IS A CULT!](http://i.imgur.com/vXaeo3M.jpg)

Huh, the green guy didn't end up being Higuchi. Quelle surprise. 

And it's one of [THOSE](http://i.imgur.com/7P6HJEi.jpg) cults 

Spraying the room with the [rose-tinted gas](http://i.imgur.com/F8fLJgT.jpg) of a freshman attending college, hmm?

They might be a cult, but Watashi could actually take some advice here. Is he unhappy because he's just been living superficially? Except Watashi isn't shy about speaking his mind, so he has no need to rage out like these folks. 

[Ozu! Ozu! Ozu! Ozu!](http://i.imgur.com/esltrBw.jpg)

Damn! Neko Ramen is a total boss! No need to have a Best Ramen Shop contest, Neko Ramen wins by default!

And hey, Ozu is back in his drag getup from episode 1. And he has some business to take care of - like filming a short movie while he's in drag!

And now Akashi is here, with cake! And confirmed she is still a disciple of Higuchi! See, everything does still carry on despite Watashi's resets!

Book - No idea. 
Globe - Higuchi was sticking pins in it last episode with his feet. 
Hmm, and they didn't all three of them eat the cake, which would have fit with when he came home and found the empty cake and 3 plates...


[What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck?](http://i.imgur.com/NcWIh1V.png) Why is future Watashi-with-a-beard transmorphing through the wall?!



>> ARTICLE
This episode was great! I loved the extended metaphor of using worker bees to describe social structure. The references to colony collapse disorder and the 2012 apocalypse, although a little dated, were really funny as well. 

The use of cinematography in this episode was incredible. All the Honwaka members, aside from Watashi and Ozu, had antennae on their heads, symbolizing their deviance from the group hivemind. The uniform attire worn by the members and the Stepford smiles were a nice touch and enhanced this effect.

Watashi was totally out of place amongst Honwaka's hive mind, just as he has been in every other episode so far. Much like how the appearances of the club members deceptively hid their true motivations, Watashi's subconscious goal (confessing his feelings to Akashi) is always shrouded behind a veil of goals and efforts that are ultimately useless at stopping the timeloops. Also, to add insult to injury, it's becoming more and more apparent as the episodes go on that no matter what Watashi does, his first two years are always going to be a complete mess.

At the end of the episode, Watashi again realizes that he needs to confess his feelings to Akashi in order to move on in life, but the Honwaka members prevent him from doing so. The problem is that Watashi keeps taking too long to realize that he wants to confess to her. I think the underlying significance of this fact is that often in life, our deeper goals take a backseat to the trivial problems we face on a day to day basis. Yet, we aren't truly satisfied in life unless we attempt to accomplish the deeper goals that drive us. I'm hoping that the series ends with Watashi figuring this out and deciding to move forward in life despite whatever ridiculous situation he gets caught up in next.
>> ARTICLE
A hippie health corporation cult. There truly is no end to the absurdity this show will go to, is there? That's why I love it so. 

Let me begin today's post with a slight rectification concerning the direction of my praise, courtesy to /u/_lynn, who pointed out to me that most if not all of my praise has been heaped onto director Masaaki Yuasa. While he is certainly to be credited with some of the ingenuity I have pointed out, I forgot to mention that The Tatami Galaxy is an adaption of a novel written by Tomihiko Morimi, so a large part of the already immense praise I have for the narrative structure has to be doled out to him. Though I have not read the book myself, it's solid foundation for the show cannot be denied.

With that out of the way, today's write-up is not as focused, natural or insightful to do as the other ones, since I have to wait a little bit more for the next big subject to be tackled.

On the other hand, for reasons that will become apparent later, this is a fine point to look back and summarize a little and make some stabs in the dark. Of course, I'm not going to do the latter out of fear of giving anything away, but I can at least point out some things that one might have easily missed in the show. 

That said, let's look at the constants that are roughly fixed in order:

* Watashi joins a club, out of a desire to break free from the person he used to be in high school.
* Watashi's endeavors bear no fruits and within a certain time span he alienates himself from the rest of the club, though not for lack of trying
* Watashi meats Ozu, who is always immediately described as a negative presence: their first conversation follows a standard pattern as well
* Watashi devises a plan to claw himself back into the game, a plan usually requiring hefty amounts of effort: plan gets foiled, efforts are wasted. Even more so, they were always doomed from the start
* Watashi ends up lamenting the way he spent his two years, proclaiming that if not for certain things, it would certainly be different. And we go again...

Other constants include:

* Watashi encounters the fortune teller, who tells him that there is an opportunity dangling in front of him he must not miss: her price goes up each episode
* Watashi finds/looks out Mochiguman he found and reminisces about an encounter with Akashi, a girl he usually made some sort of agreement with, but failed to deliver up till then

Unless I'm missing something, those should be the big things that everyone should have in their heads right now. But there are two other curious things that indicate fishy business somewhere, the main things I wanted to discuss today. 

The first is an element of inevitability. 'You have just named all of those constants', you will say, 'and the clock is turned back each time. Of course there's *inevitability*, he's stuck in a fucking loop!' 

Well, yes, that is true, but it's more than that. Within each go-around we see Watashi choose a different group, but his predicament ends the same, which one by now thinks is probably related to the point of the show. 

But the strange thing is that not only does Watashi's predicament not change, nothing else does either!! Today we see Higuchi leaving again, even though there is no mention of the Proxy^100 War. And yesterday, when asked whether he has the money to travel around the world, Higuchi answers that he obtained it when winning the Shinami Cup, which is the cycling cup he managed to win because he entered with Watashi's hyper-modern bike... 

Those are just two examples (there's more to be found), but it seems that whatever Watashi chooses is not only of no consequence to his fate, but also not to that of other people. Remarkable indeed.

The second is the extremely confusing remarks regarding the different go-arounds that went before. They seem disconnected, but references to earlier go-arounds and even later ones (search for them yourself) are dropped here and there, even by our main man himself. Nowhere else is this as apparent as the fortune teller segment, where Watashi's statements indicate at least some knowledge of previous iterations, though he clearly lacks full knowledge of them. Whether other characters are aware of this is unclear as well.

Both of these points seem to point towards some very strange things going on here... but we need more information to say anything conclusive. 

Further down the rabbit hole it is... 

(Feel free to hit me with your best shot though!)
>> ARTICLE
>it seems that whatever Watashi chooses is not only of no consequence to his fate, but also not to that of other people.

Could it be...parallel worlds? Is Watashi actually traveling through parallel worlds, where each episode is a world that starts at the same point in time and ends with him wishing for the same things? Likewise, these worlds overlap and things tend to bleed through the worlds and affect his life. Thus, if Watashi would only "break free from the person he used to be," stop looking at couples in jealousy and disgust, do the things that he truly wants and not try to "be cool and deviate from the norm," then his life of having no idea what he wants and just doing the things people tell him/control him to do will end.

Watashi realizes that "grabbing the opportunity dangling in front of him" has meant returning the keychain to Akashi whenever he is in his room, but when choosing a club to join or feeling left out the things dangling in front of him were flyers for clubs or Ozu's weird face, so in a way Watashi still not returning the keychain is somewhat explainable. However, after this episode it is clear that getting closer to Akashi is his true desire, and returning the keychain is his opportunity to initiate the question. But he's probably scared of rejection because he thinks how could a girl like Akashi possibly like him if he can't even get his own club-mates to accept him? Possibly getting rejected (by Akashi) might hurt like hell, but he took action out of his own will and not under the influence of anything.

That's just my guess.   
>> ARTICLE
Morimi definitely set the structure, characters, and some of the plots of the show, but I think Yuasa's skills at adaptive writing enhance the show quite a bit (just like Ping Pong was made better by his additions). None of Morimi's books are officially translated into English, but there is an amateur translation of TTG floating around. From what I've skimmed of it, I think Yuasa made the series more thematically coherent and the ending more emotionally effective.

He doesn't take anything out, he only adds to the book. There are only four time loops in the book, the movie circle, becoming Higuchi's disciple, the softball circle, and [episode 9 spoilers](/s "the secret society"). Yuasa fleshes out things that are only mentioned in passing, and separates things out that get combined into arcs existing in the book [spoilers for the rest of the show](/s "like the 3 episode arc of choosing between 3 girls is all part of the softball circle chapter, the softball cult thing is downplayed. And the secret society chapter is basically episodes 9 and 10 combined. There's not a lot of the secret society, more of him trapped in the tatami galaxy.") Yuasa also does a good job of fleshing out some of the reasons why Akashi and Watashi would be romantically interested in each other. The attraction is a little less overt in the novel.

But what I found most interesting about the structure of the book vs. show is how Yuasa played around with the ending. [Major ending spoilers from here on out](/s "Basically the end of every chapter of the book ends with Watashi getting together with Akashi. He returns her Mochiguman right away in the first chapter, and in later ones he shields her from the giant cloud of moths, promises to take her to Neko Ramen, etc. He always ends up with her, and even uses the excellent line about there being 'nothing more boring than telling a story of successful love.' He visits Ozu in the hospital and delivers his 'that's the way I show my love.' line. In every timeline he winds up in a successful relationship and seems to come to an understanding about his relationship with Ozu, yet he still has the lingering regrets and questions that lead to another timeline and club choice. By being trapped in his tatami galaxy and separated from the things he loves, Watashi learns to accept the happiness he has and that's the only way the book manages to end. I can only imagine how frustrating it would be to see him actively give up his happy ending at the end of 10 episodes instead of how Yuasa just had him failing to achieve it 10 times. Of course, Yuasa also manages to utilize the visual medium of animation to heighten the emotions as well. His escape from the tatami galaxy in the book has nothing in it as beautiful as that leap to save Ozu. The way Yuasa uses visual metaphor throughout the whole show heightens the emotional impact of the show vs. the book. Also, I'm pretty sure the bit in the show about the rose-colored life being unobtainable, but each room and each life having their own unique and beautiful color is Yuasa's own. That part is like the whole thesis of the show summed up beautifully. I couldn't imagine the show without it.")
>> ARTICLE
Really nice post, I'd suggest writing a post about it at the very end of the show, since it really shows how Yuasa adapted the narrative. Reading this I even think he might have changed the message a bit, to something a little more optimistic. 

And about the visual metaphors: I'll be writing a big, big post near the end about those. Combined with other [Spoiler](/s "the foreshadowing lines tying into the message"), those are an incredibly important touch that elevate this show above so many others.

Anyone know where to find those mochiguman things for sale? I kind of want one now lol.

**My first-timer thoughts:**

I missed out on episode 4's discussion because some things popped up so I'll quickly go through my thoughts on episodes 4 & 5.

**Episode 4:** This was a really fun episode to watch! There's a proxy war and all that, and Watashi gets dragged into all of it, like how he usually does. I think the interesting part of this episode is when Higuchi sings the song to Watashi about "choosing the right circle" (as in club, right?) and some other things I can't remember. It's as if he's aware of the previous timelines and is trying to help Watashi out in his own way. The song was also really nice to boot. Ok let's move on to episode 5!

**Episode 5:** This time, Watashi gets into a group with people so-nice-that-it's-annoying, and just like all the other clubs, he just can't seem to fit in. I went through your comments on the older discussion threads and I noticed that some of you had the idea that it's not that Watashi *can't* fit in, but it's that he *tries too hard* to fit in. I agree with you guys and I feel like if he decided not to reach for the rose-coloured campus life, he would be much happier. This also makes me feel really bad for him because no matter how much effort he puts into becoming one with the crowd, he always somehow gets crushed by his own ambition and ends in misery. What's weird thiugh is that at the end of this episode, it didn't really seem like Watashi completely lost hope like all the other times, but time began rewinding once again. Also, I really want to see Watashi give Akashi her little toy back! The fortune teller lady keeps reminding him about it but he never bothers to take action. I'm also confused as to what a "Tatami" and a "4.5 Tatami room" is. I guess we'll learn more about these in the upcoming episodes. Ozu is still mysterious as ever and I'm pretty convinced that Higuchi and Ozu both have memories of the previous timelines. [Also, here is my theory on how Watashi has his time-loop ability.](/s "In episode 1, Watashi says to the matchmaking god that he wishes to be together with Akashi. Higuchi, or the matchmaking god, gave Watashi the power to be with Akashi, which is actually the ability to reset time however many times it is needed in order for him to get with Akashi. So basically everytime he regrets his decisions in the past 2 years (the biggest factor being that he didn't get with Akashi), he "retries" his past 2 years in another attempt to get together with her.") That's about as much as I have to say for this episode.

Sorry for not making it on time yesterday and for discussing some of the previous episode in this thread but I still hope someone out there might enjoy reading this. Thanks for the great analyses guys, keep it up!
>> ARTICLE
Tatami is just the type of floor mats often used for apartments like Watashi's. 4.5 is the number of mats making up his room. You'll regularly hear "x tatami room" to describe the size of an apartment (if the floor consists of those mats of course). The ED is full of tatami mat layouts. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for clearing that up.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the idea of being unable to escape the 4.5 Tatami room is also to do with the idea that the 'opportunity'(the mochiguman) has remained trapped within the room, and that when the mochiguman leaves the room and returns to its rightful owner, a path will open up for Watashi to take that will lead him out of the neverending cycle. 
>> ARTICLE
Welp... We're going further from the pre-established pattern this time again. 

This was an even stranger episode than the others. It seemed less "connected" than the others. 

Also, what's up with Future-Watashi appearing out of nowhere? Is he hallucinating his future self, or is it something that really happened? He does talk about occult, so I thought it really was a ghost of himself or something like that but... Then he talked about the harsh reality, and I was confused... 
>> ARTICLE
This episode was really interesting.

For starters Ozu was in very little of this yet Watashi seems to bring on his demise without Ozu. Additionally, I thouyght the most important part of this episode was how he refferred to the last episode as if it happened. He was still a disciple of Higuchi. This shows that in some ways that the timlines are connected.

Finally, he seems as if he is starting to grasp the opportunity he is missing out on, what he needs to do to break out of this rewinding loop. Thoughts?
>> ARTICLE
I think you might be confused about something here, because Watashi didn't allude to being a disciple of Higuchi this episode. You either confuse it with Akashi saying she was his disciple, or you misread the line where Watashi says that Ozu's escape plan was "the suggestion of **one** Master Higuchi". "One" here meaning that he doesn't know this master.
>> ARTICLE
I assume breaking the loop means giving the toy back to Akashi, gaining his long sought raven-haired maiden , even if it's not what he always wished for. 

Hence not passing on the opportunity that lies before him.
>> ARTICLE
At first I thought this was about how you wish you'd join that group of people that look like they have a nice social life. And then you join, only to realize, that's not for you. Even if they are nice and flawless... that's not how YOU are, and nor do you wish any longer to be one of them because that behavior doesn't represent you. 

Like wanting to be a nice person, to struggle to achieve that, and when you end up failing that, you realize that is in fact better for you to NOT be nice. Just be yourself. 

It was so cringey to see him so out of place, even more than in the previous episodes. Being the one out in a group of mindless happy drones. 

But then the cult aspects kicked in... and well... it was more about avoiding negative influence. Lunatics hooked by that manipulation tactic of "you need us to free yourself from worries".
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 5**: "Who is responsible? Probably me. Just this time..." Well. Such a nice club... that actually is run by a cult. 

Gifs for episode: [...](http://i.imgur.com/4Iv6hpN.gifv), [Ozu is amused](http://i.imgur.com/GRELhh4.gifv), [amazement](http://i.imgur.com/JiUKB9c.gifv)

I was a bit worried that Akashi-san wouldn't show up.

Told yaaa Neko-ramen is awesome inb4 they actually use cats.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually a little dissapointed with this episode but that's more because Akashi has so little screen time. She's starting to become one of my favourite characters caus she's just so awesome.

Anyway, moving on to less scrubby stuff.

I kinda knew that the Daughter of the corporation was minimal at best thanks to amazing trope of only important characters are drawn out 'properly'. Which makes me wonder how exactly would the Father appear in future episodes? Would he be attempting to indoctrinate other people? What other sides of him will we get to see.

I'm not sure if its me but it seems that Watashi is discovering the Mochiguman/opportunity later and later in each episode. If this is intentional could it perhaps that Watashi's 'state' is similar to a cosine curve; he will continuously sink down and get further and further away from his goal untill he reaches a point where he wakes up his idea and then he'll slowly claw his way back to victory, or in this case, Akashi. Maybe this could be piled in with the idea that all of the timelines reference each other, the other members of the cast more or less remember things that have happened in the other timelines and Watashi only remembers a smidgen of things such as the fortune teller.

In the previous thread I said that if I were to pick a weakest episode, it would be between Episode 4 and one other episode. That other episode was referring to this one, but upon rewatch I think I enjoyed it a bit more. 

Now that these two episodes are done with, I'm especially excited for the rest of the series. It was around then that I binged through the remaining episodes. Not that you first-time watchers should do that though...

Not a whole lot happening this episode, although the tension continues to build as we progress towards Watashi (hopefully) finally breaking out of the time loop. Fingers crossed.

I'm not very familiar with the nuances of Japanese, so does anyone have any insight on why every character in The Tatami Galaxy uses "ahou" instead of "baka"? I don't think I've heard a single "baka" out of anyone thus far, and although I initially thought it was just one of Akashi's personality quirks, basically every other instance of someone calling someone else an idiot has corresponded to the word "ahou" spoken aloud.

Some Googling suggests that "ahou" is more severe of an insult than "baka" and seems to be more common in the Kansai area, where the show is set. That leads me to believe it's just part of the dialect.
>> ARTICLE
I just did some light googling on the aho/baka thing.

Like you said, "aho" is more commonly used in the Kansai area, and "baka" in the Kanto area. Because a Kansai person would be more comfortable using "aho", calling someone "baka" becomes more severe of an insult. The reverse happens in Kanto, where "aho" is more insulting than "baka".

[For the rewatchers, major spoilers again](/s "I forgot to mention it last episode, but the bag of money obviously came from the wandering Watashi collecting all of those loose 1000 notes in the infinite 4.5-tatami rooms. We also get a much more direct view of the wandering Watashi here, somehow phasing through the wall from another dimension. These were both apparent to me in retrospect as I saw the later episodes the first time but it's fun coming at them from this side again.")

I liked this episode as an episode in itself. It does well showing how a seemingly fun, innocent and wholesome experience can become creepy, disruptive and exploitative. In other words, I loved that the Honeybee club actually is a cult. 

I don't like that this episode had almost no Akashi and that we are 5 episodes in and we aren't anywhere yet. Can something happen already? 

When Akashi brings him the cake, I was practically screaming at Wata to invite her in for some cake and make a move. Maybe show her the white toy he has and let things escalate from there.

There's probably some significance or meaning for Ozu to be in women's clothes but I honestly don't care

I think this is one of those "deep meaning" shows because right now nothing has really appealed to me persnally.



>> ARTICLE
> I think this is one of those "deep meaning" shows because right now nothing has really appealed to me persnally.

Kind of? I can now see why it might not appeal to you as it's essentially the opposite of Amagami SS in its premise: instead of seeing Junichi succeed six times by dating a number of girls across multiple timelines and situations, you see Watashi repeatedly fail at dating even one girl... across multiple timelines and situations.

Yeah it is kinda the opposite haha hopefully it'll take a turn for the better soon though!
>> ARTICLE
Ah, it is actually an interesting episode. Some things that occur are significant, they just aren't explained until later.

**'In this situation, there is only one choice, right?"**

One of the most common complaints towards The Tatami Galaxy is that it simply failed to capture the prolonged interest of the audience member watching, due to its repetitive structure and 'people seeing it coming from the start'. From a certain standpoint I can see the reason why, but I can't help thinking the paradoxical statement that they either looked to hard or not hard enough. Okay, that's a little too cryptic: what I mean is that they either focused too much on the message and as a result ironically missed part of the point of that message, or they didn't appreciate the subtly changing nature of the show through all the repetition and constants.

My view is of course, totally opposite. This show never seizes to amaze me, its constant ingenuity, creativity and fluidity supplying us with an endless amount of curve balls. There's so much to see, hear and think about, I never get bored. But as always, different strokes for different folk, I guess. 

Anyway, the reason I bring this up is of course related to today's chosen point of discussion. Today's subject is the exact opposite of the subject of the discussion of episode 2, which was repetition. Today I want to discuss change in the show and the subtle way in which it does so. Because today's episode is quite the departure from the previous ones we've seen so far, in a whole slew of aspects.

And it's not just this episode either. Where previous episodes have exposed slightly different aspects and burned in the core of Watashi's exploits throughout the two years by means of repetition, today's episode marks a shift that was a long time coming. At the start of the episode, Watashi tells us that *'His life, led lacking all splendor, is heading towards a climax surrounded by three women.'* So where previous episodes showed a potentially infinite amount of options of progression, today we come at a crossroad with a limited number of options: one can imagine that we will be shown the fate each option entails for our main man. Speculating on the reason for this is something I will not do, though if you somewhat grasp the message the show wants to tell, it will not be hard to guess. 

But with this slight change of direction and emphasis also comes a change of structure. No longer is there a 'rose colou\red campus life' speech, nor did Akashi even appear this episode, though the possibility remains that she is hidden behind one of the other pathways not yet taken. 

However, it's not just the plot direction and show structure that changes, but our characters have changed as well. Jougasaki, though still slightly hostile towards Watashi, is apparently not as hell-bent on conquering females as we originally thought and Hanuki is not as perpetual a drinker as we were told, confirming the slight suspicions planted at the end of episode 4.

But the biggest difference of all, was that other hugely important character: Ozu. Before today, Ozu always seemed either antagonistic, or at least mischievous. Today, he was neither of those, in fact, he was actually helpful. More importantly, it seems that he has a weak spot as well, specifically one of the opposite gender. Suddenly he doesn't seem so evil... or does he?

The last difference is not an immensely important one, but one I want to mention if only for sheer entertainment value. Watashi's monologues have been replaced by a dialogue... with a cowboy named Johny representing his libido. This does tie into something meaningful, but not now. For now, let's just enjoy that we're seeing a man conversing with his own sex drive, represented by a desperate cowboy. 

It simply doesn't get better than that.

On my first watch, this episode was absolutely hilarious. Now on my rewatch, I think I laughed even more. "Johnny" and his frantic nature is just so perfect for the show's fast pace, while the concept of the character makes for some very entertaining visuals.

Agreed, this set of episodes is what got me to watch all of the remaining episodes that same day. Totally worth it.

This episode was hilarious. Johnny, the engrish, drunk Hanuki, drunk Jogasaki and drunk Watashi had me laughing really hard! Probably important that I could relate very well to what was happening here. I basically had the exact same experience as Wata about a year ago. 

Brings up an interesting question. Would you bang her if you were in Wata's place? Whilst I'm no advocate of abusing drunk girls, in this case I think I would have. It was Hanuki that was clearly interested, starting the drinking and inviting him in to her house. 

**ZERO** Akashi though. That makes me sad. Are all the moths dead in this timeline?
>> ARTICLE
> I basically had the exact same experience

So you had a life-sized doll at your place too?

As for your question, if I were fully/semi conscious I'd probably feel too much guilt to go that far. Especially if the person was like Hanuki and going through a complicated relationship.

Sigh, I find that these situations are always so hard to judge. Sometimes girls are vulnerable, in other cases they feel ignored or hurt that you wouldn't bang them when they were basically throwing themselves at you.

The whole "Johnny" sequence with him was pure gold.  I was dying every time he was on screen.  


It seems like every episode, he learns more and more about how to be successful and we learn more and more about the world.  I'm looking forward to see how this ends up resolving itself
>> ARTICLE
**My first-timer thoughts:**

As soon as I read the title of this episode, I knew I would have a good laugh or two at hearing some Engrish. The English wasn't actually as bad as I thought it would be though, so props to the voice actors for at least making it clear what they were trying to say. This episode explored some of the uncontrollable desires us men are prone to, and along with that we finally got introduced to the cowboy and horse we see in the OP. I thought the depiction of Watashi resisting the urge to let "Johnny" take over his body was hilarious. Good to see that Watashi was strong enough not to give into this temptation. Also, I really want to see more Akashi. She definitely needs some more screen time.

We are officially half-way through the discussions! Thanks for sticking around this far!
>> ARTICLE
This episode was absolutely hilarious from start to finish. Watashi's "harem", the frantic arguing of the Inside Out-esque nervous system organs, and especially Johnny were all amazing ideas, and very relatable ones at that. 

The only thing missing from this episode was Akashi, but I noticed at the end of the episode that the Mochiguman was dangling around behind Watashi; the opportunity was literally right in front of us but he didn't even bother to look at it! That obviously means he met her at some point, but he was so caught up in his fake harem that he didn't pay her any attention. It's funny that Watashi seems to be getting more savvy in his attempts to try and fix his first two years of college, but he's not getting any closer to actually moving on with his life.

I can't wait to see what's next!

Oh boy. This episode was so good. Feels a lot more RomCom-esque, but this time, it's really fun and enjoyable. Watashi is the usual naive and romantic dude, but he does have his desires and instincts, and they were absolutely hilarious. 

Fun thing : as we're progressing, Ozu (and the others, but I might be wrong since it seems more random for them) seem to have less and less importance in Watashi's life... Or at least screen-time. While he was always "haunting" Watashi in the first few episodes, he's been more of a friend of a friend recently, and it does sorta coincides with what he said at the beginning, which was something along the line of "Whether you meet me, you'll end up like you are right now" IIRC (might still be totally wrong, as my memory is shit). That's really interesting to see how things end up and how he can or cannot take control of his own life. 

Another fun thing is when Watashi admitted he was dependent on Ozu's Printing club. "No Drugs" posters. Heh...

The further we go, the more I think all of this is just a more or less subtle way of showing life's not set in stone and anyone can indeed have control over one's life. I really hope something along those lines happen in the end... Or maybe something even better I did not think of. Something that I'd like at least, please! 

In any case, really fun episode today. The conflict with Johnny probably carried this episode, and to be honest, I've been in his case (no, not THAT. Just drunk as fuck with another girl) so I can relate. Hahaha. I do share his view on the subject as well, though I don't know if I would've resisted Johnny if it happened now.

I wanted to hear some engrish spoken at that break-neck speed. Only to understand how impossible a dub of this show would be.

Instead I get "touch my body... no no.. kurukuru knockout". Good enough.

Quite the love square he had going : a penpal who he's never seen , a (sex) doll and a drunkard who licks faces. Hard choice.

The dialogue with his body parts was hilarious. I recognized [this](https://i.imgur.com/GVKiMUV.gif) from somewhere, though I don't recall where.

Well, that was the most realistic episode. Less depressing than most. More awkward than most. I thought the cowboy was crude, though admittedly somewhat funny. First time the fortune teller didn't notice his skill, or whatever it is. Also, different girl this time.
>> ARTICLE
Suuuuper late today. Not much comments to make - this episode had some of the best jokes but right now feels very disconnected from the rest. I'm sure it will all stitch itself together in time. 

My one big thing I noticed is this - no Akashi, and Ozu didn't get nearly the negative depiction he normally gets. And Hanuki implies Ozu has a crush...

Could Ozu be sabotaging Watashi in order to cause Watashi not to fall for Akashi, because Ozu likes her? Not sure that all lines up with the previous timelines, but it would nicely tie into the dilemma presented at the very start of the first episode and explain the change in Ozu's depiction!
>> ARTICLE
Oh? My theory from the previous episode seems to be occuring. This time around he didn't even recognize the mochiguman. Unless of course, the mochiguman is one of a few paths out of the 4.5 tatami room. However, I think it that were true, it would defeat the whole point of the show; the idea that soemtimes we miss the forest for the trees and in our wild pursuit of the attainable we take what appears to be the correct path but instead it is merely leading off a cliff. 

I really liked the depiction of Johhny, and the conversations Johnny had with Watashi were extremely entertaining and I would think it would be quite relatable to many in that stage of life (I'm not quite there yet)

After this episode featured Hanuki, I think that maybe each of the individual 'side' characters will get their own episodes where they are central to the plot line/have a large percentage of screen time.  If that is so, maybe Turtle Brush dood will return as an advisor in a club? And I can't really think of how Honeybee Cult Leader dood will return as. 

Once again I find the lack of Akashi extremely disconcerting.

Might be an unpopular opinion, but episodes 6 7 and 8 are the worst episodes of Tatami galaxy. Not that they are bad episodes but they are by far the most repetitive and my brain kind of shuts off during them. HOWEVER the final 3 episodes are literally all beyond perfect, like fucking 14/10.
>> ARTICLE
**'Nothing else is as boring to tell as a story of succesful love.'**

And that was that. The finale of this show is without a doubt one of my favorite episodes of anime, maybe even television. The emotional build-up is capped off stunningly in a scene of ultimate catharsis where Watashi gets born anew and finally spreads his wings, both metaphors inferred directly into the show. It also caps of the complete turnaround of Watashi's attitude by showing him like Ozu at the end, complete with a carbon copy of one of Ozu's favorite lines, as well as switching the ED and OP for added emphasis, but it also caps off the journey of all other characters nicely. The moth metaphor is concluded with a brilliant swirl of all the moths from each timeline finding release.

The show even nods at the source of everything: it was our old fortune teller all along. She who rewound the time after each failure, as seen in [this passing shot of her behind the clock tower.](http://imgur.com/lEtL9S4) Sticking the landing is of crucial importance for how a show will be remembered and Tatami Galaxy never aimed for anything less than classic status. I feel it succeeded flawlessly.

---

The very last subject I want to discuss is the thematic message of the show. Because now that we know with complete certainty what this show wanted to say, it turns out that the message wasn't even that profound: no matter what you do or what you choose, just live life to its fullest and grab the opportunities you're given, because regret will make even the best of lives seem worthless.

What made the message so much more impactful is the dedication the show had towards its message and the amount of effort it put in to ingrain that message into the viewers in the best and most thorough way. Instead of heaping together some standard building blocks and make something out of those materials, Tatami Galaxy threw out everything and started from the bottom-up. 

Every choice they made was made in service of the message, taking into consideration both the impact on its message and the impact on existing elements: we saw animation style supporting narration, narration supporting structure, structure supporting characterization and I could go on. 

The message wasn't that special, but the framework built with such meticulous level of attention and detail without any pre-existing confines made it something very special. That imo nigh flawless execution is what elevates this show above all others.

With that, I'll end this write-up and my re-watch: there is so much to say about this show, but I've done my best to at least point out everything I could spot. Immense thanks to /u/BlindPiratez for organizing a rewatch of my favorite show: having the opportunity to dissect this show with all of you here made this rewatch so much better than previous re-visitations. 

To all of you who managed to get through my comments or even provide feedback after getting through it all, I hope you found it worth your time. And whenever you feel down, remember this show and the chorus of the opening:

*Our time is now*

*Even if nothing else changes,*

*We will come across each other someday*

It's over, and what a satisfying end it is. These last two episodes were what sealed this series as one of my favorites, it's some of the best pay-off I've seen, partly because I didn't quite notice the build-up to begin with.

This show has one of the best displays of the episodic format. Episode 1-9 felt both related and unrelated in certain ways, like you were watching different stories with the same pieces unfold in each episode rather than one larger story at hand.

But the truth is that there was a larger story at hand, a story about finding purpose, about growing up, progressing through life and being satisfied with what you have achieved.

It's all about the themes that this show is trying to convey, that's the larger story at hand, and the result is something I'd honestly call beautiful and inspiring.

**My first-timer thoughts:**

Yes. Yes! YES! **YES!!!** This is *exactly* what I was hoping for the ending to be! It literally connected all the other episodes together, made everything make sense, was emotional, gave us a happy ending, and MOTHS! Wow I can't even say how satisfied I am with this anime. It's the same feeling I got after finishing Kara no Kyoukai actually. I don't even have that empty/void feeling... that's how happy I am with this ending. There is so much to talk about but since I'm kind of freaking out right now and you guys will do a much better job at analyzing this episode, I'll leave it all to you. One thing that I really do want to point out though is that I liked how Ozu finally looked normal to Watashi (who's name never gets revealed in the end) but near the end when Ozu is in the hospital, Watashi had the evil eyes that were always Ozu's up until that point implying that Watashi understands that instead of Ozu getting in the way of his life, he was actually getting in the way of Ozu's instead. Also Akashi got her Mochiguman back and survived a moth attack (which was PERFECT!). I got teary eyed when Watashi was looking back at all his friends and ran to save Ozu's life, which I *totally* did not expect this show to do to me.

So, the rewatch has concluded but the discussions have yet to die! Stick around tomorrow for an overall discussion on The Tatami Galaxy. I can't wait to read what you all have to say!!

I think this is one show where it's almost impossible to create a "After Story" that would fit in well. Watashi described the love story successful so there's that. Additionally I don't think Yuasa does sequels to his shows and it wouldn't feel the same with another director/writer.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like any show could have a 5 minutes after story epilogue.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that could've been fine and doable. But hey! You can always imagine how they would end up... or read doujinshi. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel whenever I need to imagine a better ending it's hard for me to really attribute a "satisfying" tag to a series ha
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's not like you have to imagine a different ending with The Tatami Galaxy since it's open. 

I guess this is be as good place as any to quote Baccano!: "Stories never begin. Nor do they end. They are comprised of people living. An endless cycle of interacting, influencing each other, and parting ways. As long as stories are told, they should not have clear endings, Carol." 
>> ARTICLE
Hate that quote from Baccano :p

Give me my super duper happy endings :p
>> ARTICLE
Haha! I guess that's fair.

First-timer here. I want to thank /u/BlindPiratez for hosting the rewatch, since I don't think I would have started this show anytime soon without it. Huge props to /u/Vlayer and /u/watashi-akashi as well for their *incredibly* useful insight in just about every one of these threads.

As for the show itself, this ending has to be one of the most satisfying and rewarding finales I've ever seen. I really don't have much else to say, as others are going to do a far better job analyzing the episode than I could. What a hell of a ride.
>> ARTICLE
[](#teehee)

Haha, no problem! If I hadn't started this rewatch, I wouldn't have gotten around to watching this incredible show anytime soon either!
>> ARTICLE
[](#flattered)

Really, I'm so glad that /u/BlindPiratez started this Rewatch Thread since I had only seen the series once before and was craving another watch. This was the perfect opportunity.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a pleasure! I loved reading through all your posts so I should be thanking you for making this rewatch so much more enjoyable!

[**This moment.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNWIFAKBgb8)
 
.
 
The moment that encapsulates the realization of why life is worth living.
 
.
 
Why/how/when everyone does something doesn't matter.
 
.
 
Because you are alive. So you grab that chance dangling in front of you.
 
.
 
I don't know what else is really left to discuss. All the bits and pieces, everything, comes together for our hero. Watashi. I. Me. You. Us.
 
.
 
Life isn't defined by some singular, rose-colored path that we should follow. It's a mix of all the colors, things and people around us. And that's why it's worth living outside of your Tatami Galaxy.
 
.
 
This is possibly one of my favorite pieces of storytelling of all time. Not many stories have resonated and connected with me on such a deep level, and I'll never be able to forget these characters. (I plan on reading the novel [immediately](http://tatami.cadet-nine.org) and suggest some of you do the same!)
 
I'm so glad I took part in this rewatch and I hope more people can learn about and experience this magical journey. Thank you for hosting, /u/BlindPiratez. And thank you everyone for joining in on the discussions.
 
And of course, thank you Maasaki Yuasa for giving us this work of art. What a ride.

(P.S. I rewatched the episode 3 times last night. And bawled my eyes out 3 times. Absolutely flawless show. :) )
>> ARTICLE
No problem! It's been really fun reading what you all have to say about this show and this rewatch was basically just me pushing myself to finally get through this show (which I'm so glad I did).
>> ARTICLE
Your reactions mirror mine, and I've seen it before. It really is pretty much perfect.

> I rewatched the episode 3 times last night. And bawled my eyes out 3 times. Absolutely flawless show.

I didn't think the re-watch would get me like it did the first time, but I was wrong. When everything collapses into place, the visuals, the music, Watashi's realizations and struggles to escape his isolated galaxy--it's all executed so perfectly that I can't help but choke up.

>> ARTICLE
With work and stuff I was usually a little behind the rewatch schedule so I didn't really join in with the discussions, but I did thoroughly enjoy doing the rewatch (or first time watch for me). Whenever I finished an episode I would go straight to the sub and look up the episode thread so I could read everyone's analysis and first timer thoughts. There were definitely a good number of things I would have overlooked in the show if I hadn't read the comments.

Thanks /u/BlindPiratez for running the rewatch and everyone who commented with their thoughts each week. I enjoyed this show quite a bit more than I thought I would and I'm pretty stoked to watch the final episode later tonight

>> ARTICLE
I wasn't part of this rewatch but thanks OP for spreading love for this masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
And it's over! I knew as soon as the ED was used in place of the OP that I was in for something special. I was left so utterly speechless by the ending that I had to reflect on it all day just to get my thoughts together. I knew this ending was coming, but even so, it still hit me like a bullet train. 

Watashi's emotional catharsis in this episode is nothing short of incredible. He finally came to the realization that while the "rose colored campus life" is unattainable, the real world is still full of beautiful colors that can be appreciated just the same. The series' many visual metaphors (the Mochiguman, the wings of Icarus, the moths, use of colors to represent moods) were all used really effectively to convey Watashi's complete transformation in outlook on life. I can't think of too many other endings in any form of media that were this satisfying.

The funny thing is that best part of this ending isn't even the ending itself, if that makes any sense. I predicted most of the ending [by episode 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3hltkq/spoilers_the_tatami_galaxy_episode_3_rewatch/cu8gcye). However, despite its predictability, the ending of the series functions as the realization of an important message: no matter where life brings you, enjoy the journey and continue to move forward. The genius of this message is that the predictability of the series' ending only reinforces that point. In other words, the ending is only so enjoyable *because* it is the culmination of Watashi's journey. This is a level of attention to detail that I've seen in very few other series' narrative structures, and it really goes to show just how unique this series is.

Thanks to /u/BlindPiratez for organizing the rewatch and getting me to remove this series from my Plan to Watch list, and thanks to everyone else for all the amazing analysis in these threads. It definitely enhanced my experience during my first time watching this series.

Thank you so much for joining in! If I didn't host this rewatch, this show would still be on my Plan to Watch list as well so I'm really glad I did!

One thing I found interesting is how Ozu, who dedicated all of his college life to one goal, that of his girlfriend, faces a lot of trouble as the show ends from the people he upset. Really drives home the point that one shouldn't focus on just one goal, but rather enjoy everything that happens through their life, kinda like the paradigm of "the journey is more important than the destination"
>> ARTICLE
Instant classic
>> ARTICLE
I like how Ozu didn't  turn into some ultimate villain or anything though they could have went that route pretty easily considering the kind of nasty things he has done in many timelines so far. It might even have been justified to be angry at Ozu, but it shows how good a person Watashi is to be able to forgive him and be the bigger man.  I  also like that none of the failures in other continuities are wasted. Kind of cheeky for them to say successful romances are uneventful but I  really wished we got to see more of it.

Even though  I  love time rewind movies and anime such as Groundhog Day, Girl Who Leapt Through Time and Natsu no Arashi, this story easily is one of the best in that category even among my favorite shows with the same theme.

Definitely among the most satisfying endings to a TV show out there, despite the short length of the show itself.
>> ARTICLE
Incredibly satisfying end episode and all (had a smile on my face from start to finish), but I'm not as blown away with this anime as you guys. For me at least the first eight episodes were quite underwhelming and these last three excellent episodes can't make up for everything. 

Things I liked; The artstyle, Akashi, Higuchi and Ozu, the overarching of the plot lines and how it all came together in the end.

Things I disliked; The fact that I didn't care about Watashi, that I couldn't relate to most of the characters (even though I thought they were interesting) and that the individual stories are not as interesting. I guess I didn't feel emotionally invested on one hand, while on the other it wasn't nearly interesting or funny/entertaining enough.

I think I'll give it a 7/10 in the end, for good effort. Also a pat on the back r/anime, first group watch that didn't make me cry. 
>> ARTICLE
This is word for word how I felt about the series. I think I would have liked it better if it were just a bit shorter.

Still, I enjoyed my time with it. Thanks OP for hosting these threads.

I didn't rewatch these episodes (because I just re-watched it a month ago or so), but I've loved reading everyone's reactions and theories (and even learning a thing or two), so thanks so much to OP for putting this together, and everyone who commented and shared the TTG love. This is probably one of my favourite episodes of anything ever.

1000000000/10 this is certainly not my type of anime but I am sooo glad that I joined this rewatch even tho I am a first time viewer.

The real ozu is met by MC.
Neko-ramen guy is a studen and an afro dude.
The last bit where mc turned into the evil one.

Akashi and MC probably dating end.

All the problems in the 10 episodes are fixed. (except for the question if neko-ramen used cats)

so 10/10 definitely now one of my top anime......



the real question now is... will someone organize a schedule for the specials ? :D

So guys, since a lot of you seem to be saying farewell already, I just want to make it clear that **there will be a discussion thread on the series as a whole tomorrow!** You can write a review, theory, make some fan art, a wallpaper album, name your favourite songs from the OST and so on and so forth!

*The discussions still live on!*

Thanks for hosting this rewatch, /u/BlindPiratez and thanks to everyone that took time to post their thoughts. I actually still have to finish watching Kara no Kyoukai from the last rewatch. Any ideas on what you plan to rewatch next? I will gladly take part. :D

No problem! I hope you enjoy Kara no Kyoukai as much as I did. :)

As for the next rewatch... I'm still not sure myself. But in tomorrow's discussion threads you guys can suggest what we should rewatch next.
>> ARTICLE
So this is the end of the Tatami Galaxy I guess, huh?...

That definitely was an interesting ride. I can't say I fell madly in love with it, but I appreciate how original (at least in its presentation) it was. The message, or what I think is the message, although simple, is also a nice one. Kind of hits home actually.

The catharsis was definitely present, but there was also a big sense of satisfaction during the whole episode. I found myself smiling and cheering for Watashi once he broke out of the loop. I guess seeing him all fired up and relieved to be back was a really powerful moment. 

In the end, I still don't know what this 4.5 Tatami Galaxy was, but the message got through to me, and I guess that's what matters. 

Thanks /u/BlindPiratez for the rewatch. You da real MVP! 

Small Edit : 

Ah fuck. How could I forget about the last scene?! Welp, it's pretty refreshing to see Watashi switching positions with Ozu. It's... Well yeah. We've come full circle. I guess the thing was that Ozu was just enjoying his life rather than despising it like Watashi. With his failed plan though... Tables turned and maybe that's why he is now in Watashi's place and Watashi became the "Devil". I dunno, I found that funny and just fitting. 
>> ARTICLE
Full disclosure, I started watching with y'all but I couldn't handle waiting a day between each episode so I binged it. That scene where he kept switching costumes was magnificent. The music, the desperation in his voice, everything.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain the ending? 
>> ARTICLE
There are some good write-ups higher in the thread. What about the ending did you not understand?
>> ARTICLE
/u/SekreyZed and I were both confused about this; 

How does he end up in the parallel universe? 
>> ARTICLE
It's not explicitly explained, but it is suggested the fortune teller had something to do with it. Look at the post by /u/watashi-akashi at the top of the thread. There's a quick shot in this episode showing her inside the inner workings of the rewind clock we saw at the end of each episode.

This series is more interested in its themes and resolving Watashi's issues than it is interested in the mechanics of the time loop, so a passing hint is all you get. The show is more like the Magical Realism literary genre than anything else. The "how" isn't important.  
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm late, but:

Holy shit that ending.  I literally can't imagine a better last episode for this.
>> ARTICLE
I know, right?

It's *perfect*.

**Final Episode**

Get to hear the ED earlier than usual, I'm game :)

Pfft Ozu's gf isn't that pretty...she doesn't even have a face :p

Awe he lost his super cool beard, I liked it

Seriously Akashi's moth face has been by far my favourite part of this series

FINALLY!!!

"Because it is not the purpose of this program to show the further development of my relationship with Akashi, I will refrain from showing too much...Nothing else is as boring to tell as a story of successful love"

Well that quote right there is probably one that people love but I really hate it, maybe it's what I don't like about the series.

Cute way to end it! I don't have the same feelings as most of the other people in this rewatch so tomorrow's thread should be interesting haha

That quote works for me because it succinctly tells you what you need to know: the show wasn't a love story, but one of growing up and learning how to embrace and live your life. It *also* tells you that Watashi and Akashi's love was a successful one. I think it's a neat way to do it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's neat and not bad but it did leave me personally wanting more :p
>> ARTICLE
Acid. This anime is on acid. 

Are we watching the 3 specials?

Please someone answer me.

Maybe I didn't understand it all....or maybe it really isn't capable of being understood. 

Why did he become Ozu....y and why was Ozu all good(better?) in the end? It also seemed like things that happened separately(in different dimensions) happened together in the ending timeline...

And how was he going through the different dimensions(rooms) anyway?

I see that he finally grasped what he most wanted after seeing himself waste time, and after booming lonely, it was the combination of those two things. But....so what? That can't be the message of the anime?


>> ARTICLE
just finished watching the series for my first time and decided to do some reading on it. I had NO idea this "Rewatch" you guys were having was even going on! And during the same time I was having my first viewing! Kind of bummed I missed out on the discussions with everyone, and being able to watch this with others, but I will be checking out all the old discussions for stuff I missed on my own viewing. Glad to see this kind of thing happening, cheers!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I definitely recommend going through watashi-akashi's write-ups because they clear a lot of things up and are totally worth the read.

Hope you enjoyed the show!

Soooo... I wasn't hallucinating, huh?...

Just like with Araragi, we're seeing things through Watashi's eyes, so things are not actually true to reality (just like when we saw Jgasaki and his friends drunk in an earlier episode). Pretty interesting!

Watashi picked the doll and he still ended up alone. That's some impressive display of romantic failure.

**'I choose Kaori-san!'**

If I had to choose an episode I think is the weakest of this show, it would have to be this one. The weirdness of the show backfires somewhat imo, because in today's episode it veers into uncomfortability bordering on creepy. What's possibly even worse is that on first glance, there doesn't seem to be an actual point to this episode: the first time around I was actually wondering why they didn't just leave the Kaori option out, because the ultimate message of these three episodes could be conveyed just as well with two options instead of three. 

But this show doesn't do anything without ulterior motive, which is one of the things I admire most. It's just that I simply could not lay my finger on it, which irked me a lot, especially since I feel I've figured out most things of this show. On this re-watch, I approached the problem a little differently: why include Kaori in the first place? And it suddenly hit me, almost right at the end.

Though the revelation came at the end, the answer lies in the start. Yesterday I wrote that episode 6 did not include a 'rose colored campus life' speech, which is obviously false and mostly a result of fatigue at the time of write-up. But I digress: the speech has been present every episode up until now, yet there is one thing that has been left intentionally vague: what exactly is the 'rose colored campus life'? More importantly, what is Watashi's definition of this term?

I mean, it's obviously an ideal of perfection that Watashi holds, but he never tells us what it entails aside from containing a 'raven-haired maiden'. In fact, he himself doesn't even really seem to know what it is! But where does this link into today's episode?

Well, today we focus on his life with Kaori and her being a love doll means that his 'romance' with her is entirely fictional, something made by his own mind. So here he actually gets the opportunity to act out his fantasy of a 'rose colored campus life' with the obviously raven haired love doll whose personality is also entirely a product of his imagination. So all the opportunity is here for him to achieve his goal and he still fails. And the reason? 

He actually feels he is unworthy of such a woman: he fails through his own volition. That is a really, really... unusual realization for him: after all these episodes of extremely hard work to achieve the dream, here he realizes such a fiction is not something meant for him. 

But somehow he still doesn't seem to grasp the real truth behind the realization. We'll need something really special to get it out of him... 
>> ARTICLE
A day late to this thread, but as a first-time watcher, this is what I was thinking too. Kaori is no more or less real than Watashi's fantasy of his ideal raven-haired maiden, and it forces you to put in some thought: is this particular timeline really any more pathetic than the other seven, where Watashi wastes away his entire college life chasing after some imaginary dream girl?

Still, I'd agree that this is the weakest episode of the show, partly because of how relatable Episode 6 was and because of how... out there this one was.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, at a first glance, I  can see why people might have thought this episode was too weird or didn't  have a point. But it really does have a pretty important one considering the guy feels unworthy of even fictional love. I would imagine it would feel way less awkward if we had a human like robot with emotions or something, but them just having a mannequin works too, especially showing that it is more mental than physical in this case. Though I  wouldn't  have minded seeing more of the fantasy being animated (sorta Mysterious Girlfriend X style), I  get where the director is coming from.
>> ARTICLE
So you have the choice between a cute human girl and a "cute" plastic girl and u choose the plastic girl? Good going Watashi you are truly a genius. 

I don't understand why he is so infatuated with a doll and that made this episode really hard to relate too. I actually thought she was scary and not cute. 

Keiko tomorrow? Can't wait to see who she really is, hoping for Akashi, but Ozu/random person still an option.

Best scene was the Moguchiman scene, it's really obvious symbolism with him being the white moguchiman, but I still liked it a lot. Make him change his ways kids.
>> ARTICLE
> Keiko tomorrow? Can't wait to see who she really is, hoping for Akashi, but Ozu/random person still an option.

Yeah I want Akasahi but would guess it's one or the other you put!


>> ARTICLE
I think another reason why he chose the plastic girl was precisely because Kaori was not human. Watashi's greatest flaw when it comes relationships was reported to be his inability to communicate with others.  Since Kaori isn't real, Watashi wouldn't have the same pressure and would able to fantasize the exchanges to his liking.
>> ARTICLE
I think it is because he held the relationship to his fantasy and it is not something we really saw being animated. Not like seeing the doll coming to life (except for that scene in the beginning).

I think he has the right idea of wanting a beautiful relationship even if it does look very awkward being with a doll. 
>> ARTICLE
Keiko's identity hype !!!

first seconds I thought I fucked up on watching episode 7 first before 6 but the intro was just similar XD


Neko ramen guy not judging MC because of Kaori hes chill as ice

[a friend pointed out that](/s "the fortune tellers nose looked like a penis") and I can't unsee it lol
>> ARTICLE
> Keiko's identity

Well, they did show a bit of her writing those letters, a faceless white girl. And I thought it was the daughter of the cult leader in that cult episode. 

I wonder though... both her and big-chin fella have the same name : Higuchi . Are they related?
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it to be the bee cult girl. I just hope it's Akashi-san writing her true feelings. or some new character
>> ARTICLE
Jougasaki paid for someone to guard and care for his (sex) doll? That's some dedication he has there...

But god damn, I want to be paid 80 bucks for guarding it too.. where do I sign up?

He was planning to have a family with the doll? And then he got into a love quarrel with Jogusaki over her... What a strange episode. Must be because I don't understand their pure manifestation of love !

The rewind sequence seems a bit different. He goes back in time, but the events from last episode happened as well (at least most of them). EDIT : Oh, of course, it's similar because he chooses the same three clubs at the beginning, but the focus shifts from his activity in each one
>> ARTICLE
I think all 3 club lives are meant to happen simultaneously, we just see one at a time. 
>> ARTICLE
Well some people defend their 2d waifus. 3d waifus need more protection
>> ARTICLE
3dpd people will beg to differ. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think when Watashi rewinds in this "arc," he's rewinding to the bathroom instead of the beginning of his rose-colored campus life. That's why everything else is the same, and why he's picking the same three clubs.
>> ARTICLE
Man, the MC really hit rock bottom in this one. I'm guessing we'll see the mystery pen pal next episode.

First timer here. Gotta give thanks to the OP for hosting this daily rewatch. I don't think I would have watched this series otherwise, because it doesn't lend itself well to binge watching.

TTG has a similar feeling to NHK, but here the story doesn't seem to be very interested in heading towards a conclusion. Instead, it's expanding "sideways", if that makes sense. It's fleshing out the characters and their relationships and it actually makes the earlier episodes better.
Still hoping for a conclusive ending to round it out, though.
>> ARTICLE
Ehhh, quite a weird episode. Nothing too thrilling, and probably weird for a lot of people given Watashi's choice. 

I wouldn't choose Kaori but I guess I kind of know where he comes from. The poor guy has no/low self-esteem, and it showed at the end where he didn't dare to do anything to her (until Johnny showed up). Choosing a doll and creating the ideal woman from his own mind was the easiest way for him. Dealing with other peoples' complexity? Not for him. Rather, he just wants some kind of "pure" love, platonic love! Where only the sentiment are enough to prove you are in love, and where the beastial and primitive act of love is dirty and unneeded. 

Well... That's what I think his choice is about. It's all about him being afraind to confront other people's feelings, thus choosing a silent, perfect woman. 

Same could be said for Jgasaki, to be honest. Although I feel like he is much more about escaping reality than not willing to confront other peoples. We saw that he is not afraid to assert his dominance, but he just doesn't like those ugly, dirty, 3DPD girls. 

This episode was kind of interesting, in terms of what you can conclude about it, but it's definitely not the most entertaining episode I've seen from The Tatamy Galaxy.

Also, looks like we're gonna be stuck in this specific time loop for another episode where he will meet Keiko. And now that I think about it, I feel like what I said earlier was actually spot-on. He lied to Keiko about (at least) his looks, and if he does choose her, he will have to face her and her opinion on him, to face someone else's view on him, which is something he seems scared of. It actually ties pretty well with this episode if what I said is actually "true"...

I wonder if it will indeed be the definitive "time-life" or if it's just for this 3 episode arc. Either way, it seems like the formula from the first few episodes was just a bait, and I totally took it. Not that it's a bad thing! Johnny is a very welcomed addition to the cast. The dude's great :D.


>> ARTICLE
Well, this episode was 99% *criiiiiiiiiinge* 

The actual 'romance' with Kaori was not all that engaging, probably because it's hard to have much of a twist or surprise development after you setup "guy looking after doll owned by another guy". Pretty much went exactly as most of us would have expected.

On the other hand, the connective parts being shown her are very intriguing - the monkey-costume part w/ Akashi, learning more of why Kaori was at Watashi's place even in other timelines, Jougasaki continuing the film projects, etc. 

I commented late on the previous episode, so its worth repeating here - Ozu seems to have no inclination to sabotage or corrupt Watashi in this or the last timeline. My pet theory is that Ozu has a crush on Akashi (Hanuki said he had a crush on someone in the last episode) and when Watashi is not interested in Akashi there's no reason for Ozu to sabotage him and/or no reason for Watashi to depict Ozu so negatively. This goes right back to the love-matching choice our dearest maybe-Love-God proposed at the very start of the show.

I'm really not digging the oracle... in these three timelines her advice makes almost zero sense since Akashi is not involved. Not sure how much I trust her advice anymore. 

I guess next episode will be the pen-pal girl. Bet you she is not going to turn out to be a real girl, either. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if you'd call it outright sabotage but Ozu DID tip Jougasaki off to Watashi's elopement with Kaori-san.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 7**: Bathroom crisis continues! Our MC saves Akashi but doesn't get the praise he deserves. Don't get any weird thoughts about Kaori... noooooo! That fortune-telling was more like a highway robbery. Nooo! Johnny!! So that failed. Retake!

Just have to drop one of my favorite trivia bits from the show: the VA of Johnny also voices Sanageyama in Kill la Kill and Adult Link in a number of Zelda games...
>> ARTICLE
Okay that was creepy. 

I had some trouble following along. 

It seemed to me we went back only to the end of episode 6, where he said he wanted to go back "even just a few minutes" i think it was. So time reversed just a few minutes instead of 2 years. Then I guess it went back and showed us that most of the same things would have happened...and then we got back to the "present" of the opening of episode 7. Then he made the worst decision I could have imagined by taking the doll. Talk about a good setup he had going, getting paid so much to do so little. 

Kinda proves he's messed up to the max. And how easily influenced he was. 

I also had some sort of thought question about Ozu. How honest is he? Is that some sort of issue in the whole anime?

Woooo Akashi returns <3 

I realised that when the Fortune Teller says that the opportunity is dangling in front of him and that he should grab it, she also means it literally. Watashi also does grab onto it midway through the episode. 

I think its interesting that for this episode and I'm guessing, the next. They are virtually the same route, due to the joining of multiple circles, however there is only 1 key decision made that causes them to differ from each other.  And that decision has made all the difference. 

The concept of Jougasaki's love from Kaori feels super romantic despite it being kinda weird.

**'I want to stand on the victory podium, no matter what methods I have to use!'**

Even though the message of yesterday's episode has finally come through, I still think it's the worst episode of this show, simply because it is not up to par with the rest, made more obvious by the show ramping up towards its conclusion. 

Today's episode, however, pulls it all right back on track, continuing the build-up that faltered a little yesterday. Our ending to the 'triple crossroad' arc shows no sign of hesitation or slight discomfort. It's also the perfect way to end this arc, which means it's time to look back a little.

This doesn't mean I'm going to summarize like I did after episode 5, but more that I'd like to emphasize the necessity and subtlety this arc brings. In the first five episodes we see Watashi choosing a different club each time in his attempt to achieve his 'rose colored campus life', pouring all his trust and effort (and often even money) into that route to achieve his goal, of course failing each time and subsequently blaiming whatever it is he felt held him back. While most people with ample experience in the world of slightly good television would already assume that the problem lies with Watashi, there are a slight number of objections one can raise against the theory that it is him who is at fault. 

One of those objections is that Watashi is putting his efforts into the wrong place. Now don't get me wrong: five different circles and five different failures doesn't exactly indicate that the fault lies in the club choice, but that's not the real point the objection makes. The point of the objection is that the five clubs of the five starting episodes are all clubs that are counter-intuitive to Watashi's nature: he is forcing himself into being someone he is not, which will ultimately always backfire if you do it long enough (I speak from experience in this one). This argument is actually quite hard to refute, since it holds a reasonable amount of truth.

However, these past few episodes do precisely that: moreover, that's the entire point of the arc. For starters, Watashi chooses three clubs instead of one, throwing the argument of him putting all his eggs in one basket summarily out of the window. Contrary to the first five clubs, these are also all things befitting of him: a language class, a reading circle and play acting for children, in costume. But even so, this arc isn't about the clubs: it's about the women. Here the show gives him three choices on each end of the spectrum, a finite number, removing the option of 'wrong choice' altogether. 

This is an important development. There were already hints for the observant viewer that his choices didn't matter to anyone (hints I pointed out in one of my posts), but here we remove the question of choice entirely: it simply doesn't matter, it's not the problem. The problem lies with Watashi. 

Which is also something the show enforces within these past three episodes. In episode six, we see him refuse to grasp the opportunity of the moment, though it wouldn't have mattered anyway. In episode seven, we see him turn down a perfect fantasy out of a feeling of being unworthy. And today he ignores the door opened wide for him when the original one closed, because he feels that she could never fall for the real him, a sentiment similar to one presented in an earlier episode (I think it was #2). 

This arc shuts down on all of the previous escape routes for Watashi's blame and additionally points a lot of extra fingers towards him. Like a cornered animal, he only grows more desperate because of it. 

The pressure is rising: we're gearing up for the end.

Side note: The past two episodes also confirm our suspicions for Watashi's wild fantasy and huge tendency to embellish stories: apply this retroactively to previous episodes, though I already pointed it out a long time ago.
 
>> ARTICLE
This episode also has echoes from the previous two as well; your point about Watashi feeling "that she could never fall for the real him" also pops up in episode 6, as he doesn't believe that sober Hanuki would actually be interested in him. I'm particularly struck by the last scene, where Akashi mentions that she was staking out "Keiko's" apartment and the camera pans over to a chair with a book on it, reminding me of Kaori during episode 7.

I also didn't notice it in yesterday's episode, but the scene where the children are screaming at Akashi's harassers to "change their ways" also places Watashi, in costume, directly in front of the crowd of kids as well.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with your analysis, but this worries me. Watashi's own outlook and personality seem to be the only thing left that can be changed in order to effect a change in his social life and consequently his happiness - as you say, the problem lies with him. 

But we've now had 8 episodes of him dreaming of a rosy campus life, getting overly emotionally involved in his passion-de-jour, densely or shyly avoiding budding romance possibilities and ultimately depressingly believing he is not worthy of being loved. And so far, he's barely learned or grown from his previous timelines - he makes different surface changes like which club(s) or no club at all, but he has yet to self-analyze enough to realize that his own mentality is what screws him. 

If rewinding 7 times is not enough times for him to learn that, why would an 8th, 9th or 10th time be any different? 

Hence, I am worried about how they can believably change anything at this point without breaking Watashi's character or the "rules" such as they are. 

*fingers crossed*
>> ARTICLE
The absolute last thing I want to do, is ruin what's yet to come by spilling anything whatsoever. 

I've been really, *really* careful with my hints and nudges, as I believe the best way to experience this is with an open and questioning mind. 

So all I will say to you and all I can say to you is: patience. The best shows are the ones that put faith into their audience, and require the same faith to be given to them. 

The show has put itself out there with its style and everything else, trusting you to keep watching. You are still watching, so you have not betrayed that trust. 

Now it's your time to repay the favor.
>> ARTICLE
Aye. I can't help but worry, but at the same time I am hoping for/expecting great things.
>> ARTICLE
I really like Akashi in this episode, even if most of her actions are disguised as "Keiko". Certain excerpts of the letters she sent had nuggets of truth behind them, most notably the one where she talks about being embarrassed over her childish tastes, which in truth is referring to her Mochiguman collection. 

That in itself means that she was willing to share part of her actual self with Watashi. Of course Watashi is blind to this and just assumes that she likes the "White Mochiguman" and not the real him.

**My first-timer thoughts:**

Dammit, I was busy yesterday so I missed out on the discussion again. =/

Anyway, this episode made the the last two episodes make complete sense to me. A lot of you guys were saying that these three episodes are the worst in the series or just really boring but I still found them to be incredibly entertaining. I love this arc for the same reason that I love Kara no Kyoukai and Baccano!. Everything is a total mess in the beginning but in the end everything fits together perfectly and gives me such a satisfying feeling. Also, we finally see Akashi! It seems she was the one behind the mysterious "Keiko" the whole time, and I think that was the closest Watashi ever got to asking her out. At least he's making some progress. I hope this show ends nicely with Watashi finally figuring out who the *true* best girl is (obviously Akashi) and gets together with her all while realizing he doesn't need the rose-coloured campus life to be happy.

Happy discussing!

EDIT: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention... That Ozu face at the end gave me some fucking nightmares. Thanks, Madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I really enjoyed this arc both my first time watching and on my rewatch. The second episode is a bit weak, but the first one is hilarious and the third one gives meaningful insight both to Watashi and Akashi.
>> ARTICLE
So Keiko is Ozu/Akashi, called it. 

I'm kinda concerned though, 8 episodes in and still little to no development. 

Also, [this](http://imgur.com/5XjnO8g) was your shot Watashi. 'I found a white mogichuman', 'Wanna go out sometime?', ... so many good options. Please do something! 
>> ARTICLE
Patience, my friend. Things have been slowly ramping up the last episodes and he's getting closer to the truth he needs to confront with each episode. 

It's only three more episodes... 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'll finish it no matter what at this point, but Watashi's indecision is killing me man. 
>> ARTICLE
I just had a thought: Watashi says at the beginning that he doesnt want to risk wasting his two years by joining only one club, and this is actually exactly whats been happening in episodes 1-5.  And so here, hes picked out 3 clubs/activities, so we get 3 episodes to demonstrate that nope, he still wastes his two years.

This was my favorite of the triple, mostly because Akashi figured more prominently.  It was a nice surprise that Keiko actually was Akashi after all (well, to a certain extent).  I was certain it was Ozu after Watashi visited the apartment and it was candy-like (definitely just a coincidence that Hanuki mentions this right before).

The Ozu face on the clock this time was different (and kind of unsettling, to be honest); I wonder where that will play into things?
>> ARTICLE
Watashi is going ham next episode it seems
>> ARTICLE
Thoughts from a first-timer:

Surprising no one ever, Keiko turned out to be a persona created by Ozu to mess with Watashi. The ending of this episode was just frustrating to watch. He made the connection between the Mochiguman and Akashi and had a perfect opportunity to return it to her, but didnt use it!

I really liked how this episode tied together connections from several previously explored stories (the expos film of Jougasaki, the Proxy-Proxy War, and Kaori are all connected). No matter what Watashi does, he always falls into the same social circle, meets Akashi, and inevitably ends up a victim of Ozus schemes, and the connections between the stories do a great job of reinforcing that idea. To add insult to injury, he relived this same sequence of events 3 times and only this time did he realize that Ozu was manipulating the harem the whole time. 

The appearance of Ozus face on the spinning clock at the end of the episode was pretty ominous. Im hoping that Watashi retains enough memories this time to try and avoid interacting with Ozu, but considering how much their fates are tied to one another, I doubt thatd work either. Considering how ridiculous the harem was, I have no idea what to expect next, but Im looking forward to it!

>> ARTICLE
Okay, so still a pretty awkward episode, but better than last. Please die, stupid cowboy. 

Oz. is the girl again....he keeps being female. 

I had this weird thought about our protagonist's roles somehow interacting during this episode. As thought there's some huge point to the anime that I'm missing, but it present enough to be grasped before it is revealed. 

Idk. I'm not smart enough for that, I'll just wait until the end.

So akashi....she was a jerk. And they shouldn't be pleased with each other....I thought they were both pathetic/unkind people for their letters. 

No more thoughts....bed now.

Keiko Route, here we gooooo! (Will edit after the episode for more after-thoughts!)

Edit : 

HAH! CALLED IT! PLATONIC LOVE! Well, other than that, I over-analyzed the thing, maybe?

It was nice to hear Akashi actually took part in this little... prank(?...). They did learn more about each other under those little lies. Johnny wasn't wrong, there was a good feeling between those two, and he could have acted on it. It's always a bit frustrating for us to see Watashi backing off at the very last moment where he could simply take that Mochiguman and bring it to Akashi and finally start his "rose-colored campus life" but hey, (maybe) it's not so obvious when you're directly involved... 

I guess this concludes this little 3-Episode Arc? What does Ozu's face during the wind-up mean though? Seems a bit fishy to be just the innocent face of the devil himself!

Honestly one of my favorite episodes, not just of this series, of all anime even. It really brings together everything the previous episodes established, it's an eye-opener of an episode. It's an episode for reflection, not for Watashi(since he can't fully remember his past lives) necessarily, but for the viewer. 

We have observed Watashi through all these lives, seen his hopes and his disappointments. Likewise we've seen all the other characters, glimpses of their lives(albeit from Watashi's perspective) and how they're all connected. Now the show puts us in a situation where we're able to go back and see those lives again, but through the eyes of a Watashi that has nothing. 

I absolutely love it.

Hold on, the [story](http://gfycat.com/RespectfulLikableBorer) in this episode is just like that [one movie](http://gfycat.com/GiftedSpecificBelugawhale) the MC made in Episode 2. What a rip-off.

I bet some first-time watchers already noticed it, but those movies were foreshadowing the plot events of certain episodes. The [first film](http://gfycat.com/DistantWideFrigatebird) being the [proxy-proxy war](http://gfycat.com/IcyPleasantBlackcrappie) and the [second film](http://gfycat.com/HandsomeDirectAppaloosa) being the [harem](http://gfycat.com/MadeupObedientEgg)

"In this world I was close to [Hanuki](http://gfycat.com/TornIdealisticAmethystinepython), I lived together with a beautiful love-doll, and I even seemed to have exchanged letters with a proper lady."

*It was a situation I could only dream of.*

It's this section near the end, when Watashi sees all the lives he could've had that really resonates with me. It's not quite a "You don't know what you have until it's gone" situation, because he doesn't really remember or know all the details. 

Rather, he only cares for and sees the good aspects of those lives. It fits in so well with what Higushi said in the previous episode, to not have unrealistic expectations or else you'll be unsatisfied. Such is this situation, as Watashi only sees the good aspects of each life and wants them. Yet when he lived through them, he was unable to accept the negatives that came with it and was thereby unable to progress. 

He could've asked Akashi out, it was clear that she liked him. However, due to the problems I mentioned above, he fooled himself into thinking that Akashi only liked his disguise and not the real him.

It's unrealistic to think that everything in your life will be great, even if you're living your dream and are unaware of it.

> It's an episode for reflection, not for Watashi necessarily, but for the viewer.

Man, you hit the nail on the head. This, also, is one of my all-time favorite eps of any anime. This episode gets me more choked-up feeling than any "feels trip" anime, and I think it's the notion that there are so, so many possibilities you might be letting pass by. 

When Watashi starts rifling through the contents of the rooms and realizing he's had these other parallel lives where he had real connections with people ("How did I know this attractive dental hygenist" haha) and that in his current reality he's done nothing but hide in his room, it really gets me. 

That moment, to me, really drives home the point of the whole series, and it is *so* perfectly executed. Really dazzling stuff here.

*"And every occupant of every room seemed to be having fun, even if it wasn't rose-colored."*

**'Always absorbed in my solitary delusions. But that can no longer continue.'**

God I love this show. I really do. No matter how many times I see this episode, I'm floored each time again how they absolutely pull the rug out from under our feet. 

Before I dive into the meat of today's discussion that I have been stewing on for a while now, let me finish my post of yesterday concerning foreshadowing and cohesion. Because they told us how they were going to wrap this up:

* In episode 2, the independent films Watashi makes are all previews for future episodes: a war between two men spanning generations, a man trapped between four women and last, but opposite of least, *a man trapped in a Tatami Galaxy*. Yeah, hidden in plain sight that one.
* In episode 5, the Watashi trapped in the Tatami Galaxy enters the room of Honkawa Watashi. A confusing prelude.
* The sloppily eaten castella in episode 2 was eaten by TG Watashi.
* The miraculously appearing money used to pay the turtle brush was collected from the various rooms by TG Watashi.

So yeah, we could have guessed it, to some extent. But that still doesn't diminish how beautifully everything has come together.

---

Anyway, with that subject behind me, today I can finally talk about perhaps the most beautiful aspect of this show's storytelling, both visual and literal: metaphors and symbols.

Because this show is absolutely riddled with them. There are a plethora of minor allusions and symbols spread throughout the show, from Higuchi's song providing a warning for Watashi's circular life choice, to the rising price of the fortune teller representing the increased toll of Watashi's failure to learn his lesson... even the [Castella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castella) cake (which should be eaten with company) is a simple allusion to the fact that life should not be spent alone.

We could keep pointing out the tiny ones, but there are a few major ones that I want to discuss, also with next episode in mind, as I believe the recognition of these symbols will only enhance what's yet to come. So let me start with the beginning and the end. I love paradoxes, but this isn't one: I'm talking about the OP and the ED. Both of them are stellar, but you don't need me to figure that out. But not only are they fantastic, they're also important symbolically.

I'm probably in the minority when I say that I love the OP of this show more than the ED. Which doesn't mean I don't love the ED, it's just that this OP is my favorite of all time. But I digress. The OP displays the journey through the Tatami Galaxy as we can see today, underscored by the absolutely fantastic *[Maigoinu to Ame no Beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OasBTTMxa_U)* from Asian Kung-Fu Generation, also known from a lot of other OP's (I'm sidetracking again...). 

Anyway, this sequence is no coincidence. The OP represents progress, change and breaking the mold: the OP is always moving forward, never looking back, trying to break free from the surrounding repetition. The [song's lyrics](https://kafkafuura.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/maigoinu-to-ame-no-beat/) support this, as the refrain starting from *Boku tachi no genzai wooo* roughly translates to something along the lines of: "Our reality may be repeating itself, but someday I'll meet you, so with that in mind, let's live our life."

On the other hand, the ED, mellow and somewhat choppy, though no less stellar, represents repetition and the stagnation it brings. The shapes we see are moving, sure, but always in the same pattern, repeating, rematching, never finding 'perfection'. Except for at the end, where the shapes devoid of colour encroach on the perfect 4,5 tatami shape while the screen shakes, symbolizing that such stuck patterns will always destroy whatever perfection you're aiming for. The [lyrics](http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/yojouhan/kamisamanoiutoori.htm) of *[Kamisama no Iu Toori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMQK5MbIb1E)* match Watashi's 'blaming Ozu attitude' to a tee, but it ends with 'I must forgive', meaning Watashi must accept the imperfection.

Lingering on the word 'imperfection' we arrive at the metaphor standing at the center of this show: the 4,5 tatami room. It represents seeming perfection without outside interference, impervious to all possible disturbances, like Watashi himself assents at the start of today's episode. But as the ED shows, this is a false ideal. Beauty often lies in imperfection rather than perfection, and the walls of the 4,5 tatami room are so impervious that they effectively become a prison holding whatever is inside hostage, which happens quite literally this episode, but that is merely the physical representation of what was happening all along: wasn't Watashi's life held prison by his ideal, making him unable to see whatever lies beyond?

It is a beautiful piece of symbolism, but it does not get my crown for best. That honour goes to the other metaphor which is literally at the center of the 4,5 tatami galaxy: the lamp, the moth and the mochiguman. Perhaps it is my fascination with classical culture that makes me love this metaphor so, as it evokes a sort of modern variant of [Plato's cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave). There's not enough overlap for me to go into that subject in depth: it's not worth my time, but read up on it if you hadn't heard about it yet. 

Anyway, let's start with the lamp. The lamp is the shining center of the 4,5 tatami galaxy and as such it represents Watashi's ideal of a 'rose coloured campus life', shining more brilliant than anything else, but unattainable because of the impervious glass boundary: one can see it, but never reach it. Of course this is the case for Watashi, but at the same time he is mesmerized and captivated by the shining dream, always looking for a way to obtain it and thereby never looking at anything else around him: Watashi is the moth. I think everyone has had a smile on his face during Akashi's 'moth reaction', but that seemingly comic relief moment is not just comic relief: Akashi hates moths and as long as Watashi is a moth, they can never be together.

But they are connected and the final place in the metaphor is for Akashi. She is the mochiguman: cute, comfortable, but imperfect and not as bright as the lamp, but ultimately she is connected to the lamp, symbolizing that if Watashi 'settles' for less... he might actually find the perfection and happiness he has sought all along.

I think I've written enough for today.

The build-up is complete, the realization is there... all that's left is the grand finale. 
>> ARTICLE
> even the Castella cake (which should be eaten with company) is a simple allusion to the fact that life should not be spent alone.

Don't know if you mentioned this in a previous write-up, but this is yet another sign that Ozu is trying to help Watashi. He's always the one who delivers the Castella to Watashi, probably for that exact reason.
>> ARTICLE
Hadn't mentioned that before actually, so thanks. I try to make my write-ups as comprehensive as possible, but there are so many things to cover, it's inevitable that things slip through the cracks.

But you're right, it's another example of Ozu trying to help.

Alright, so before I watch this, given how last episode ended I'm expecting this to be the nihilistic episode where Watashi hates everything and then next episode will be the happy ending. Let's find out!

Oh geez, Watashi's going off the deep-end... Tatami Addicts Anonymous.

[Yup, that's about what I was expecting.](http://i.imgur.com/gnlDVI2.jpg)

[Whoa, the art suddenly got too real!](http://i.imgur.com/YNwXXA3.jpg)

Hey, it's goatee Watashi! Sort of...

[Shit just got real! Literally!](http://i.imgur.com/1k6AS8P.jpg) I wonder if this will tie into a sort of "dealing with real life" versus the drawn mental fantasy life?

[What opportunity?](http://i.imgur.com/BSF1yCR.jpg) I'm pretty certain there was no mochiguman hanging in his room a moment ago.

And now it's there? That's cheating!

Hi Johnny! Keep running on that wheel, I think you're in for a looooong wait this episode.

What even is with this random shot of chemistry tubes? Seems a bit out of place with the other objects that are cut to in the room.

Tatami Galaxy X Cube would be... interesting. Death traps under every tatami mat!

Fish burgers? I don't recall that from a previous episode.

So one would presume that if we want to try and tie this back to the rewinds, if Watashi were to leave through the front door each of these tatami rooms could lead to another of the rewound timelines.

The cake wasn't a lie? Now we *know* this galaxy is messed up.

Ew. Cockroaches. That was super gross.

"My cockroach weapon malfunctioned" and "Please eat this" - worst combination of sentences in the same note ever!

I had noticed before that the rooms in the OP repeat over and over. I guess that wasn't just budget-savings or set constraints but actually ties into the show after all!

Ah, giant coffee bowl. Maybe the chemistry set was a coffee maker.

This is fun! This is fun! Somehow, I think even you Watashi are not going to be stubborn enough to keep going with this "club" and are going to have to finally admit that this sucks!

[There it is!](http://i.imgur.com/Nw6IxvV.jpg)

But Watashi, your goatee isn't full enough for you to pop your head through walls into other rooms/timelines yet!

I did not expect this show to be [that explicit](http://i.imgur.com/ozSafcJ.jpg) in confirming my thoughts on this, but it ties back to my long post many episodes ago about using occasional direct clarity to help the viewer stay on-track.

Phew, a tense ending. Got the Honkawa bit as expected. So Watashi, what's it going to be? have you learned not to get so stubbornly fixated on one ultimate goal and ignore everything around you? Have you learned not to feel like you are always undeserving of love and comraderie? Have you learned not to look so negatively at your friends and club-mates just because they're a bit different? Have you learned, as Ozu tried telling you so many times, to try and enjoy the things you have in life, appreciate what you have?

And most importantly, if you have learned these things, Watashi, will you remember them?

A few episodes ago I realized that Johnny on the wheel is a polite metaphor, as I noticed we get clip that immediately after Watashi reaches for his porn magazines.

> Ah, giant coffee bowl. Maybe the chemistry set was a coffee maker.

That's my interpretation.

> I did not expect this show to be that explicit  in confirming my thoughts on this, but it ties back to my long post many episodes ago about using occasional direct clarity to help the viewer stay on-track.

I do like that we get people realizing the same things the viewers do. There are some other shows where people get attacked by zombies or something and have no idea what's going on and I'm thinking, "Really, you've never heard of a zombie outbreak before?"

As a first-timer, I thought the first half of this episode was confusing, but once everything came together, it was absolutely incredible. I knew I liked this series before, but after this episode, I think this show has earned a place in my Top 5.

Watashi attempts to run away from his struggles and fears by taking up shelter in the confines of his 4.5 tatami mat room, yet by avoiding negative experiences, he is inadvertently preventing himself from having positive ones as well. I was stunned to see Watashi's own reflection on his many lives that had been and could have been. We know what struggles he has been through, yet in this timeline, void of any truly meaningful experiences, Watashi is able to truly appreciate the high points that were present in these various scenarios. 

Considering what Watashi has experienced here, I'm hoping that he's finally ready to move forward in life. Life will always be a mixed bag no matter what decisions you make, so constantly focusing on past mistakes is not an effective way to live life. Neither is avoiding struggle altogether. Watashi, like anyone else, can only move forward by growing from his experiences, whether they're good or bad.


>> ARTICLE
The ED makes a lot more sense now.Also, I really like how they're linking all the events together!
>> ARTICLE
**My first-timer thoughts:**

Wow that was incredible and crazy and interesting and confusing and felt very very short! This time Watashi knows from the get go that there is no rose-coloured campus life and decides to basically be the king of his own room... then somehow gets trapped in it. To be more exact, he gets trapped in hundreds if not thousands of his own room. Eventually we discover that each room belongs to a whole bunch of other Watashis. They all take place in alternate universes where Watashi tried to live the rose-coloured campus life but always failed. It was really cool to see references to all the previous episodes in this one. How he actually got trapped in this "library of alternate universes" though is still a mystery I guess, or perhaps it's just a representation of the memories of all the other Watashis slowly flowing into the current one... but I don't know. Also, it's one thing that he finally realizes that there is no rose-coloured campus life, but it's another that he still can't realize that THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY DANGLING IN FRONT OF HIM ALL THE TIME! We are sick of your shit Watashi, just give Akashi her god damn Mochiguman back and live the life you don't know that you want but you actually really *really* do want. Ok? I hope this gets resolved in the next episode.

Speaking of the next episode, it's the last one so be sure to be there! Happy discussing!

Just something that interested me.

The short story about the insect refers to the famous short story by Franz Kafka, "the metamorphosis". The MC of the story one day wakes up to find he had been turned into a human size bug. This story brings about the idea of Kafkaesque, essentially meaning that you have been screwed by circumstances outside of your control. A simple example would be not getting a class you registered for in college due to some administrative reason you can't control. 

This could relate to Watashi in that when he wakes up in the myriad of rooms, some outside force is messing with him, and relates to how he believes the person responsible for his misfortune is not him. However, the episode never finishes showing us whether it's his fault or not for this maze he's in. It also shows that he was still not taking responsibility for his misfortunes, although this seems to change by the end.

As a first timer, this was an amazing show and depending on the ending could even enter my top 5.

"Life ain't always Rose-Colored, but always worth living"

I guess that's how I feel after watching this episode. It was also a strange episode, kind of. 

Nothing actually happens, but you get to see how all those parallel universes are actually linked together, somehow... 

It was quite the catharsis somehow to be honest... Makes me feel like shit for not doing much with my life. 

Don't have many things to say about this episode, tbh. It kinda feels beyond my comprehension, haha... 
>> ARTICLE
this episode is the payoff for my favorite piece of foreshadowing in the whole show, in episode two one of the films watashi created was [this episodes plot](http://i.imgur.com/zGQrBj6.png) and even a [little hint](http://i.imgur.com/dSRq1D8.png) that it would happen.  

Its nice because a first time watcher wouldn't think anything of it until this episode,

Also the imagery in the OP starts to make sense

So MC x His room this episode?

I need a 4 1/2 half to live how he manages with 4.5 mats is pretty impressive.

"Men shouldn't set foot in the kitchen" pfft

Oh wow they explained the backpack, cool :)

Love how they're tying things together

Looking forward to the finale!

> "Men shouldn't set foot in the kitchen" pfft

I know, right? He really just grabs whatever reason he can to not admit his own problems. I guess "I don't use the kitchen appliances in here because I suck at cooking and am unwilling to learn" doesn't have the same ideological ring to it that he finds so satisfying.

It should bug you. It reinforces how pathetic Watashi is at his lowest.

Okay, trippy. Couldn't follow the plot until he mentioned parallel universes from decisions. 

Did the backpack of money end up being the funds to continue the proxy war?

Johnny doll still annoyingly crude.

I didn't like the photograph and video footage usage, but it was well done. 

Was the message of this episode that life without ozu is worse than life with him? I don't like that. Was it that a failed life is better than no life? I don't know, but it doesn't seem to powerful to me. 


>> ARTICLE
**'If it will always turn out like this, then I should do nothing at all!'**

And so the pieces are falling into place. Finally, I can talk about one of the things this show handles with a ridiculous amount of intelligence: foreshadowing and connectivity.

Foreshadowing is always, no matter which form of entertainment it is in, a gigantic gamble. Handle it well and it eliminates any deus ex machina, making the plot unravel itself like pulling the correct string on a seemingly complicated knot. But handle it wrong and any impact the eventual reveal might have can severely diminish or even disappear. Such is the risk involved and pulling it off requires immense amounts of careful construction and a lot of subtlety: laying down all the dominoes for the future without revealing the pattern to anyone, but still putting down enough so the last piece completes the image. So many shows fail this task in one way or the other, but there is nothing quite like the feeling when it does come together successfully, which is why so many try, this show included... but The Tatami Galaxy might actually succeed.

So far, The Tatami Galaxy has been immensely careful putting all of the pieces in place and has done so successfully, without tipping most, if any of us off. Again the show's existing qualities provide cover for one another's weaknesses. Here the show's structure and nature lends itself as the perfect cover for the process of foreshadowing, as Watashi's limited perspective and the shifting focus of each go-around denies us the opportunity to get a clear picture of what is going on, forming an effective curtain behind which the show could work its magic. 

The curious thing is that the show has made us aware of this process on many occasions before and intentionally at that. Some examples include:

* The 'rose colored campus life speech' already betrayed some of the club choices from the start, in the form of the animated pamphlets. 
* In episode 2, Ozu says he has the duplicate key because he has 'earned Jougasaki's trust', which could tip us off that he's Jougasaki's spy in the Proxy^1000 War in episode 4.
* In episode 4, Jougasaki asks Hanuki-san out for drinks, tipping us off that she is probably out drinking with him in episode 6 when Watashi fears she succumbed to the dentist: the reason she's sad is of course because of Higuchi's impending travels. 

Those are just some actual calls forward that already have been completed. Clearly the show *wants* us to go looking for them, keeping us on our toes and providing us with ample reason to pay attention. It trusts that we do just that, as it also provides numerous explanations in advance of the consequences, or vice versa:

* In episode 1, Ozu is in drag on the bridge surrounded by a mob. The mob is the result of the numerous people he pissed off in exploits in later episodes, including the Tennis Club (EP1), Jougasaki (EP2), Honkawa group (EP5) and Secret Society Lucky Cat (EP9). The reason he is in drag, is an idea from Higuchi for his escape in episode 5.
* In episode 4, the Proxy^10000 War has made Jougasaki's house unsafe for his precious Kaori: he drops her off later in episode 7 at Watashi's house, since he is then uninvolved. 
* The fireworks in episode 1 set fire to the truck in episode 9, the funds of the bike race Higuchi won in episode 3 are used for the travel he's planning revealed in episode 4 and there's probably more I'm missing right now.

Those are all things I could have (mostly) pointed out in earlier write-ups, but there is a reason why I saved this subject for today. Because today the show unravels one of its biggest mysteries: Ozu.

Ozu's story has been so meticulously crafted together that I find it hard to summarize it, such is the genius behind this. But I have to try, for those that might be lost, because it's now or never:

Basically, Ozu joins the tennis circle and meets Kohinata-san. They hit it off, but unfortunately she is the daughter of the Honkawa society and lives a sheltered life, so Ozu needs to up his game: he quite literally tells Watashi in episode 5 that 'if you want to see her regularly, it seems like you need to raise your position to a more suitable level', but in reality he was already doing just that himself. He joins the Movie circle to get close to Ajima-senpai: his involvement in the Proxy^100000 War has already gotten him close to Jougasaki, so getting close to Ajima-senpai who is Jougasaki's right hand there is easy enough. His acquaintance with Ajima and his extensive network allowed him to rise up quickly among the Secret Society Lucky Cat. Simultaneously, he uses those connections to collect dirt on both Ajima and Jougasaki, spilling the dirt of the former in order to take control of the Secret Society himself, securing the money he needs to move up in ranks among the Honkawa health group cult, which puts him in the position to achieve his final goal: to steal the airship and ride it with Kohinata-san during the Gozan festival.  

He's mischievous, kind of ruthless and very clever, but he is above all a hopeless, hopeless romantic. Not everything he does is because of his end goal, but are Ozu's actions really all that bad looking back?

* His stealing of Watashi's bike is still not okay, but Watashi wasn't going to become happy through that bike anyway, as material things are not what he wants (we see that today). But Ozu's actions provide Higuchi with the money for his travels and allows Watashi to connect with Akashi. 
* His actions referring to Jougasaki are mischievous, but not untrue and he does help Watashi. 
* His 'Keiko' letter prank on Watashi allows Watashi to meet Akashi, which seems awfully intentional looking back. 

Really, Ozu did some bad stuff, but was it all that bad? I recall him helping Watashi more often than not, steering him towards Akashi on multiple occasions. Furthermore, it's not like Watashi is a saint either: in the early episodes Ozu repeatedly says to Watashi: 'You say some pretty mean things.' Which he does, actually, on first encounter to boot. Calling someone a fiend and telling him to sink back into the ocean on first encounter (episode 3) isn't exactly nice and there's more examples at that.

Regardless of what you think of Ozu, at least his intentions have been laid bare. One mystery down... but the show isn't done yet. There have been loose threads left unexplained spread throughout the show: those are hints as to what is yet to come. In fact, the show has, in covert fashion, already told us what is going on.

What will happen now that Watashi has made the ultimate choice? We are close... all things must reach their conclusion.
>> ARTICLE
All the foreshadowing connecting in this episode was amazing, which you did a good job of covering, especially realizing what Ozu meant by his network of information. What was more amazing to me is that maybe Ozu was not a bad guy, but rather good and Watashi was the one dragging down Ozu. 

The show has such good cohesion so far.

This is a great episode on all fronts. Great character development, interesting connections to previous episodes and a poignant message delivered by "the Master" himself. We're officially in the endgame portion of the series.

Looking forward to seeing what first-time watchers think.

This episode has a lot of stuff coming back from former episodes, love it!

Ah the moth reaction how I've missed you :)

Ozu has it now!? :O

So he's got money but no girl? Most succesful one yet haha

Ozu got a gf wow, looks like thigns are finally picking up!
>> ARTICLE
**My first-timer thoughts:**

Yes!! More Akashi! This is also the first time in quite a while we get to see her freak out over a moth again! So cute! This episode was quite the deviation from the other episodes in my opinion. First of all, Watashi gets to a point where he somewhat actually believes that he is living the rose-coloured campus life. He is happy with what he is doing, but of course, eventually snaps out of it after Akashi smacks him. The second thing is that Higuchi has finally told Watashi that there is no rose-coloured campus life! For Watashi to be happy, he needs to stop working so hard to be someone other than himself. In other words, he needs to be himself to be happy. This segment was probably my favourite of the whole episode. The third is that usually he blames Ozu for ruining his past 2 years, but this time he actually starts wondering if he was actually getting in the way of Ozu's life all along. And finally... the biggest difference... is that he doesn't go back in time! This really surprised me and I can't wait to see what direction the show begins to take in the final two episodes. Seriously, I can tell it will be great.

Also, is it just me or did the ED change a bit? Happy discussing!
>> ARTICLE
This is probably one of the best episodes so far, everything Watashi and Ozu accomplished was connected and led to this turning point.

Akashi trying to wake Watashi out of his illusion with that slap. The Master summarizing the journey Watashi will inevitably go through. Ozu's escape with the blimp. Watashi giving up and succumbing to the 5x5 tatami space he believes he is trapped within...

Soooo much amazing development this episode, I can't wait to see how this concludes... but at the same time, this signals the end is approaching.. ^^I ^^don't ^^want ^^it ^^to ^^end ^^:(
>> ARTICLE
It took 8 set up episodes but the train is finally rolling boys, get on while you still can!

Really liked that they made Watashi evil. Also a huge fan of the master's speech.

I really wonder what this means for future episodes. Will Wata become depressed now, or will he finally see the light and take the opportunity that is dangling before his eyes? I swear to god if this anime ends with Wata killing himself in his room I'm gonna slap the people that started this rewatch. 
>> ARTICLE
Episode 9

"We know how you smelled when you were a baby" - that's some next level blackmail/threat right there...

I knew Ozu would use his skills to rank up to the top in the organisation... but he worked so hard only to come crashing down (literally) for someone else? Kind of a waste, and really unexpected for him.

Higuchi's speak of rose colored life is really interesting. Someone should introduce him to the Hyouka characters. Life is not just gray, or just rosey. It's a lot of colors. And you make it to be what you want it to be.

And seeing how he kicked his chance in last episodes, Watashi would have been better off in this one. Moral, immoral, loved, not loved, at least he had the money to make those worries go away. He turned to the dark side, and it could have fitted him well if not for his overwhelming wish for an absolute (the rose-colored life). Well that and the fact that Ozu was overthrown again, and without him, Watashi was kind of screwed.

>> ARTICLE
Seriously if this anime ends without closure I'm gonna stop watching Mon-musu. (please MC just get on with Akashi-san ;__;)

I am currently hyped for MC's reaction when the fortune teller starts asking for a 5 unit fine XD
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like this episode as much as everyone else, it seems. 

Cool, so Ozu is revealed to have a girlfriend and we can sort of piece together the idea that a lot of what he was doing was for her... but there's a *lot* of gaps we're filling in to make that true and at the same time there's tons of mischievous pranks Ozu did that can't really have had any bearing on that situation - setting off the fireworks at couples, making the mockumentary of Jougasaki, etc. And his girlfriend is revealed to be the least relevant girl to our protagonist's plot and interests. So, it's neat, but doesn't really change anything much other than adding a bit of a different personality to Ozu... neat.

On the Watashi side, we'd already done the "well if I can't change anything why don't I just not do a club then" aspect back in episode 4 or so where he just joined the Master's cult and did no clubs. Things seemed to be taking an interesting route at the start when he seemed to be going full on nihilist and a bit evil with stealing the Birdman, but the rest of the episode made him more or less fall into that position by a series of accidents, so that intentional dark side to him evaporated. 

Once again, we end with Watashi believing that the circumstances around him made him end up unsatisfied, and not realizing that his own mentality/personality is what's stopping him from the so-called rosy campus life. Rewind again.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, what a different episode. We again saw it tie in nicely with events from other episodes. But here, we don't just see regret with a single decision. He realizes HE has wasted his own time. That last couple minutes really brought home the feels. It forces me to confront how I'm wasting my time as well, which is such a powerful emotional lever for an anime to be able to pull, and so well at that. 

I have more feels than thoughts now...and maybe that's how it's supposed to be.

I've already said most of what I wanted to say in the last two discussion threads. The show is simply amazing, it just took me until near the end to realize that the first time through.

Episode 10 & 11 together make for one of the most fulfilling and uplifting endings I've seen. It really brings home the message in such a powerful and inspirational way, which is only made better by how much I(and anyone) can relate to it.

It does an excellent job at being both straightforward and subtle, never going to either extreme. This makes it very rewatchable without leaving you confused the first time through. The visuals are another great example of this, sometimes being blunt and other times being subtle in what they're trying to convey

I'm not one to praise something for simply being unique or original. To me it's execution that matters, originality is just a bonus. Thankfully, The Tatami Galaxy nails it in both aspects which makes it all the better. One of the best anime I've ever seen.

> Thank you all for joining in and a very special thanks to /u/watashi-akashi for making huge write-ups that were extremely fun to go through and helped us understand the bigger picture.

[](#flattered)

The fact that most people seem to have liked this show very much is good enough and if my posts contributed to that, then that's all the thanks I need. :)

Concerning the show, I think I've said everything I wanted to. I wanted to show not only *how* the show did things, but also *why* the show made certain choices and how that influences things. It's an incredibly thoughtful show, but for many reasons it can be hard to understand: however, when it comes together, it really is something special.

But I'm really just glad that so many people seem to love the show, it's a;ways something nice to see your enthusiasm for something shared

This show is nothing short of amazing. I don't know how else to put it.

That final episode is probably one of, if not my favorite episode of anything ever. 

[I'll never forget these people.](https://31.media.tumblr.com/96cec5512f97712bbf615110d47d9123/tumblr_mu0q66ZBsA1s78savo1_500.gif)

I was expecting this show to be something special from the very beginning, but nothing could have prepared me for the wave of emotions I would feel upon reaching that last second of the last episode. What a wonderful experience, and I think that if any series deserves the title of 'Masterpiece', it is this one.

As a college student, I definitely found it relatable, but I think the best part of this show is that it breaks down the human condition to its very core. And once it realizes that, it is beautiful. 

I would also like to note that my new favorite show also has one of my favorite soundtracks (and collection of songs in general) of all time. [This one song will always remind me of what it means to be alive.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlUHfx9aS2k)

Also, I went ahead and checked out the specials, and while I've seen a lot of negative comments regarding them, they are still worth watching for more of the characters and Yuasa's craziness. I've also gone ahead and uploaded an album of [Tatami Galaxy fanart](https://imgur.com/a/mVrWq) that some of you may be interested in checking out.

Anyways,

Now, I'm off to [read](http://tatami.cadet-nine.org) this magical story as well!
>> ARTICLE
I didnt participate in the daily discussions, but I came by after every episode to see what everyone thought and understand some things I thought I wasnt quite getting. I just want to talk about why this show was relatable to me and why I loved it. 

In my junior year of high school, I was having a tough time. Lots of stress from multiple sources piled up and after a certain point I lost it, got suspended from school, and never went back. When the school realized I was dropping out they offered to let me graduate a year early as long as I finished my junior year, but I was a stubborn idiot, so I refused. I said Ill just get my GED, learn to drive, get a job, and go to college. Ill be fine. And then I became a NEET.

When I first dropped out, I just sulked for a while out of frustration and depression. Then I got used to being at home all the time - I had everything I needed, so why go out? I passed most of my time with anime, and eventually I started learning Japanese, partially because I didnt want to feel like I wasnt accomplishing anything. Naturally, episode 10 hit me pretty hard and its by far my favorite episode. It was a near-exact reflection of my life ever since I shut myself in, one of those rare episodes of anime that completely entranced me from start to finish.

I just hit 3 years since dropping out, and other than getting my GED, I've done basically nothing but watch anime. Ive gotten past that feeling of contentment with being holed up in my house and now I mostly just feel frustrated that Ive wasted so much of my life with nothing to show for it. If I had handled things better when I was about to drop out, taken the opportunity that my school gave me, Id probably be in a much better position in life right now, and its my fault for not taking action that Im still doing nothing. Throughout the show, I was able to sympathize with Watashi on some level because I felt like he was in a similar situation emotionally.

Between all of my frustrations, I was thinking of finally sucking it up and going out to try and get my first job at 19, and The Tatami Galaxy was the final push that I needed. I loved the way it handled the feeling of having accomplished nothing and the idea of trying to improve your life. The characters were all fun to watch, the storytelling was masterfully done, and I really felt like I got something out of watching the show. Watching Watashi trying again and again to make his life better, falling into depression, and finally taking that first step was amazing. It was just the thing I needed to see at just the right time. Next time I get the chance, Im going to talk to the manager at my local Subway about getting a job. After this show, I cant just sit around wasting away in good conscience.

Sorry that this was mostly talk about me, but I just had to say something because in 3 years of watching anime, Ive never seen anything more relatable or more motivating than this show. Im so glad I watched it. Thanks for organizing the rewatch, /u/BlindPiratez, and thanks to everyone who commented and helped me appreciate the show more!

At some point you just have to get out there and do it! I hope everything goes well.

Seen TTGL, that was a pretty good one! I tried to start NHK a few months back and couldn't quite get into it, but I'll definitely give it another try at some point.
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK is really great and has a great dosage of dark comedy, but it's quite depressing as well. So even though it shares themes with TTG, the tone of the show is pretty much the opposite.
>> ARTICLE
I think that was part of what I couldn't get into. I don't usually do too well with anime that are both realistic and have a dark atmosphere. My main problem going in was that I expected Satou to be at least a little more relatable but the first impression he gives in the show is...not very good. I get that he probably gets better as the show goes on, but he kinda just creeped me out.
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely worth watching if you do/have suffered from depression and social anxiety. This [write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2w0cmi/wt_welcome_to_the_nhk_an_existential_crisis_that/) tells it better than I can so I'll just link that. I can relate to Watashi on a lot of things but watching Welcome to the NHK was like looking into a mirror. Yeah, it's a shit ton darker than Tatami Galaxy but I still think it's worth watching. Now that I think about it, the message is kind of the same but the delivery is different. If by creeped out you mean the whole conspiracy thing, that's the only thing I couldn't relate too and it does feel off at times. 
>> ARTICLE
If it's the whole "conspiracy" aspect of his character, then yeah I'd agree that's the weakest aspect of the show. Other than that, he severely suffers from social anxiety which makes him an unfriendly but pitiable character to watch. All of the people in the show are deeply flawed, but they're great characters.
>> ARTICLE
The final two episodes really did it for me. Prior to those episodes, I have to say it was probably an 8 or 9. But seeing Watashi realize what's truly important, and seeing him change like that was just great. He truly seemed happy at the end. Wonderful ending.
>> ARTICLE
I've been putting this off for a while and the rewatch finally made me watch. It's probably my second or third favorite show now! Thanks to /u/BlindPiratez for hosting the rewatch!

What I liked about the show was its focus on one single message, one that might even be considered cliche. Another one of my favorites, TTGL, also does this. But what makes them so amazing, is their ability to deliver the message to the viewer, almost hammer it into their heads. And of course the method of doing so. I liked the unique art style used and the idea of Watashi as an unreliable narrator, letting us see the world through his eyes and thus understand him more. How this mixed with the art style just made it better.

Thematically too, the message was great. Although it was constantly hinted at, it was blatantly stated in episode9 when Watashi talks with Higuchi. It clearly stated that perhaps the rose-colored life does not exist, and Watashi was being too idealistic. Of course, this is repeatedly emphasized in the next two episodes and lets the viewer realize that they need to be realistic of themselves and their surroundings, while taking the opportunities that present themselves. Almost like saying enjoy the journey more than the destination.

One more thing I liked is its emphasis on not letting your past failures affect you anymore. Yes you should learn from them, as Watashi did, but you should also learn to leave them in the past and never despair your current situation, but try to fix it if it bothers you so much. This is something I have always personally struggled with and hopefully will reduce worrying about in the future.

Overall an amazing show! 10/10

Edit: just remembered one more thing about the show I loved. I liked how they didn't show  that getting a relationship with Akashi was the source of happiness for Watashi; it was all the people around him and his experiences with them. I actually loved how they skipped over it, as in the context of the show, it was irrelevant. But I could just hate how many shows portray a relationship as one's life goal and ultimate form of happiness. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks again for hosting! I'd like to recommend [the show's OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXXGIFNvWA4) to anyone finishing up this rewatch, as the soundtrack to this show is honestly gorgeous.

Since you're taking suggestions for another rewatch, I'd like to recommend Shinsekai Yori. There hasn't been a rewatch for it yet, and it's another show on my PTW.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, that would be very interesting to rewatch. It's another one of my favourite shows. Though I do think I remember seeing a rewatch for Shinsekai Yori not too long ago but I'm not 100% sure. Thanks for the suggestion!

EDIT: [I checked and yeah, there was a rewatch of it 6 months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2uijgl/watch_group_shin_sekai_yori_episode_1_discussion/) So a rewatch of Shinsekai Yori soon is unlikely but either way I'd recommend you watch it. It's really great. :)
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like I will be in the minority here, but I cannot rave about this show. 

Don't get me wrong, it was good. Very good. But I do not feel that magic *something* that would make it truly great. 

There's not really anything that I think the show did wrong. The art and visual styling was incredible; the cyclical plot was compelling; The characters were varied, interesting and full of personality; and overall the show provided a very unique experience that was certainly quite memorable. 

However, I don't feel like the resolution of the show's themes or plot had as much impact as they should have for a show that is this enmeshed in its main character's repeating plot, mentality and emotional state. The ending of these threads just didn't provide as much emotional pay-off as it hoped, and I don't think there was any way that it could have given how the show set it up. And the reason for that, I feel, is the focus, or lack thereof, of the show through the first 10 episodes. 

The ending delivers 3 major resolutions: (a) Watashi realizes the importance of making the most of the opportunities he has in his life, rather than immersing himself in dissatisfaction and regret, (b) Watashi recognizes Ozu's personality and motives, and accepts him as a friend, (c) Watashi enters into a relationship with Akashi. Additionally, there are some minor resolutions like Hanuki and Higuchi's relationship problems being resolved. 

Delivering all of those major resolutions is an enormous task, and they left it all for the very last episode. It's too much to fit all into one episode naturally, and there isn't enough support from the previous episodes to make it work as powerfully as it could. 

For example, Akashi and Watashi's interactions throughout the show have been relatively few and scarecely even close to romantic. Akashi did not even appear in many episodes, and there was an entire three episodes revolving around Watashi's potential love for 3 other women entirely. So while the rational mind of the viewer will have picked out Akashi's subtle budding interest in Watashi, for him to just suddenly declare when looking upon her through a telescope that he is now head-over-heels in love with her doesn't, IMO, have the emotional catharsis it should and instead feels kind of arbitrary. 

The resolution of Watashi's friendship with Ozu, meanwhile, is hampered by all the realizations that Watashi is making being ones we've learned in previous episodes and there's no great mystery to be uncovered - Ozu simply enjoys having fun (in mischievous ways) and does big passionate acts for his girlfriend. It's news to Watashi, but at this point we already knew that, so it loses the impact of a mysterious revelation for the audience at the same time as Watashi learns it. 

Of course, both of these are resolved in tandem with the central theme of Watashi learning to enjoy the opportunities he has and live without regret. The execution of the pivotal moments (placing the Mochiguman into Akashi's hand, leaping to save Ozu, going to Neko Ramen together, repeating Ozu's words back at him) is very well done, but it also highlights a bit of a weakness in the theme itself, and that is that we've seen these opportunities for Watashi before and he didn't take them, despite at the time already wishing he had a better life. Whether or not you find his personality believable or not, it's very hard to build empathy with the character of Watashi who passed up opportunities to make himself happy again and again, then had a hallucinogenic tatami experience, and now realizes he can take those opportunities to be happy he already had. It's a very difficult central theme to express because it's so dependent on the main character themself and requires not only getting into his head but also having you like him and empathize with him, too. 

For what it's worth, I think they did a good job of depicting Watashi's personality in such a way that the audience can empathize with his troubles and want him to succeed, as well as highlighting the problems with his mental approach to, well, life. But despite the huge amount of narration I don't feel like we ever really understood how Watashi felt about things, why he thought focusing himself on one goal would lead to his ultimate happiness and satisfaction. So I while I empathized with him, I didn't really understand him, and since his big realization and change of heart is not that complex of an idea, I didn't exactly feel a personal connection there. 

Anyways, the combination of these three major elements needing resolution all in the last episode and the insufficient build-up throughout the series didn't ruin the experience for me or anything like that, but it did make the climax feel both predictable and too much like going through a checklist of things needing tying up. 

I think this could have been improved by incorporating the resolution of the theme earlier on in small ways (ie: rather than 9 rewinds that all fail equally, have some gradual improvement per the theme, then one big fail, then the tatami, then the finale), by making the relationship with Akashi much more important all-throughout, and by showing Ozu in more roles than the mischievous evil portrayal kept throughout the first 8 episodes. 

Or, realistically, they may have been better off removing either Ozu or Akashi entirely and focusing solely on one major relationship. 

All that being said, the technical execution of each episode was excellent and the miscellaneous elements of creativity spread all throughout were astounding. There was great pieces of humour and the call-backs and overlaps of elements between the various timelines had was a great bit of bizarre. Even if I'm a bit disappointed at not getting much emotional pay-off, this show was still thoroughly memorable and definitely an overall positive experience.

Ah I like this point a lot, really agree with that! Looking back it's even harder to appreciate her as a love interest and feels more like she was just tossed in there.

>  rather than 9 rewinds that all fail equally, have some gradual improvement per the theme

I originally thought this was how it was going to work after the first couple times.

We seem to see eye to eye on a lot of things so it makes me actually happy to see that I'm not the only one thinking like that, really liked reading this :)
>> ARTICLE
Firstly, thanks /u/BlindPiratez for hosting a rewatch for such a great show. I kind of had forgotten how much I actually liked it. And also thanks to all of you who wrote essays for every single episode. I could not do it. I just... make a few gifs and write a few words here and there. 

As for the show it self, I don't have much new to say. It's unique, it's about not-so-rose-colored campus life, it's episodic for the most part... etc etc. 

Visually the art is quite [minimalist](http://i.imgur.com/2cxQYcf.gifv) (except the live action) though timeless and the actual animation is [fluid](http://i.imgur.com/fx5BIMM.gifv).

I can only say good things for the music as well. I love both the [OP](https://d.maxfile.ro/labeywkgez.webm) and the [ED](https://d.maxfile.ro/gqubslhcvy.webm). And for the OST: in the last episode where the MC rushes towards Ozu and "[Yojouhan Ki Owari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlUHfx9aS2k)" plays was perfect. Other songs are good but not something I'd listen every day.

The story is very interesting. Watashi goes back in time and makes different choices but always seems to end on a sad note. Eventually he realizes that it's not about the choices one makes but how one handles them. Of course there is the romance though I feel like it's more of a subplot. Everything is presented in very [ridiculous](http://i.imgur.com/XjddyIy.gifv) ways but with never losing track of its themes.

As for the characters go, there are no useless characters: all of them affect the story and none of them are out of place. There is "[Watashi](http://i.imgur.com/y1Ry3LU.gifv)" who first tries to blame others (mainly [Ozu](http://i.imgur.com/PhUdlZN.gifv)) for the sad way his life ended up being and later, due to some clever character development, realizes Ozu's true nature and that he is actually his best friend. Then there's a bunch of side characters like Seitarou who is very laid-back but also philosophical. Pretty much every character is not what they first seem to be, they're deeper than that. 

I can also relate to this somewhat since I'm just starting my third year in college but I still haven't really found my place yet. It is sad, it is life.

For a future rewatch I'd suggest Kemonozume (haven't seen but is also made by Yuasa) or Kaiba (another Yuasa masterpiece that I really like). Both of these are animated by Madhouse with all unique styles. 
>> ARTICLE

**Final Verdict**

I just don't get it. Maybe this was too "advanced" or too "artsy" for me but I didn't seem to garner the same attraction for this series as everyone else. 

It had some good moments but I was not interested nor having fun for the majority of the series haha if I were watching this by myself with no prior hype I would have dropped it and looking back I honestly would not have regretted it too much.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special for me either.^^^DontKillMe

By the end when they got together had a more of a finally moment than being happy for them. /u/Status_Flux put it nicely "The ending felt like when Watashi got that library book that was 2 years overdue from Higuchi. It's like, oh yeah, I wanted that to happen at one point.. thanks, I guess"

I don't think I went it with too high of expectations since I've never really run into that before but nothing ever clicked for me. While episode 10 and 11 were nice to see everything come together it wasn't the "10/10" or  "best episode ever" that some people were talking about, for me.

I think this is my first show where I can't unerstand the amount of appeal this show brings so it's kind of a weird feeling for me haha sorry if this just sounds on me hating on the show but I just can't see it!

Final rating: 5/10 my Madhouse score just keeps going down, maybe I'm just weird with stuff by them :/

Thanks /u/BlindPiratez for organising this rewatch! I needed to get around to finally watching and it helped with some stuff I missed during the episodes! 

And as for your question about "So what more could you possibly want?" I'm an Amagami SS girl haha I'm always wanting more from my endings ;)

[Amazing ED though :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IcFDwygw-o)

Welp.

Between this and Nana, I think it's safe to say now that you and I can never be anime friends :(

It seems we have almost opposite tastes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah as I was reading through the threads during the watch I recognized you from those Nana threads and got some traumatic flashbacks haha.

Our tastes really do seem to be quite different! 
>> ARTICLE
Judging from your MAL I do think those two are the worst offenders. But most mutual shows are quite differently rated.

The only thing I can safely say is common ground is our mutual love for Spice & Wolf.  

>> ARTICLE
Spice and Wolf <3

>> ARTICLE
already did my post too, the thread came just in time. Agree with everything you said, even though you asked for forgiveness too many times in this post.

You shouldnt say sorry for thinking that way, anyway i wish you and me could have enjoyed this as much as the other people tho, seems like a missed opportunity
>> ARTICLE
It's not a missed opportunity. You could just enjoy anime for the escapism and enjoyment it gives, a feeling there's nothing wrong about. But in that case, you won't enjoy most anime that provide realistic situations like this or welcome to the NHK.
>> ARTICLE
funny that you say that because i actually dropped for now NHK 6 episodes in, the characters where kinda of unbearable to watch
>> ARTICLE
suprised we even have 63.9% compatibility considering how much we disagree
>> ARTICLE
63.9 is super bad in terms of compatibility, and its hard for me to have above 75 with anyone that has more than 100 anime completed so...

The compatibility algorithm is kinda fucked up
>> ARTICLE
> even though you asked for forgiveness too many times in this post.

Haha my posts in these discussions are usually met with downvotes rather than comments so was trying to avoid that lol

And yeah exactly it feels like a missed opportunity! :p
>> ARTICLE
Haha I'm glad you stayed with the rewatch until the end though! We all have different tastes so I completely get what you're trying to say. :)

Also, I really need to start watching Amagami SS soon. Your flair is always screaming at me to do so! xD What type of show is it? At the moment I have no knowledge about it whatsoever... or is it better to keep it that way?

Thanks for the awesome review! :D
>> ARTICLE
I might rewatch it again one day since it feels like instead of having different tastes I might have just missed something haha I've never been this far off with a show before!

As for Amagami SS it's a very sweet and satisfying romance set up in a unique format, hope you do give it a shot one day :)
>> ARTICLE
This is actually almost exactly how I felt when I watched the show for the first time. However, a few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to watch it again to see if there really was something I missed. I blazed through the series my second time and realized that I loved it. Then the rewatch started a few days later and I watched it a third time, haha. It's one of my few 10/10s now. I don't know if it'll affect you the same way, but you should definitely consider giving this one a rewatch sometime.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I honestly doubt that will happen for me hey you never know :p

I'm not opposed to re-watching it one day but doubt it'll be anytime soon. Happy to hear you enjoyed it though!

Can I ask what changed? 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm.. it's hard to pinpoint everything that changed, but one main thing I think was that I was able to see how everything was interconnected better after having seen the events unfold once already. Along with having gained a more optimistic world-view since my first watch, and with me, like the MC, about to go into college, the message of the show seemed to hit home better. Also, for some reason, the show was less repetitive feeling the second time, so that certainly made it feel more enjoyable. And being to experience the great visual direction again is always fun.
>> ARTICLE
Alright that's good to know, thanks! :)
>> ARTICLE
Different strokes for different folks.

For example, I saw the first arc of Amagami SS and put it on-hold. Not that I dislike it, it just didn't grab me one bit. Sure it goes further than other romances normally do in Anime, but I didn't feel that the journey(only being 4 episodes for the first arc) warranted any sort of attachment to the protagonist or the love interest.

Meanwhile, The Tatami Galaxy ends just as Watashi finally moves on with his life and stops regretting past choices. It barely goes anywhere in comparison, but the journey was all about building up to that point, which is why it was so satisfying and emotional to many people.
>> ARTICLE
Well do you understand the appeal behind Amagami SS? A lot of people stop watching either because the MC or because the lack of a journey [or because](/s "of episode 3 haha") but it makes up for it by showing different romance with actual satisfying endings. As for the love interest it changes every 4 episodes so not feeling any attachment isn't really too much of a problem haha, I really do hope you pick it back up one day since every arc is pretty unique and different from each other!

I feel that the build up just didn't amount to much for me with TTG, it could have been made in 6 episodes and still had the same effect for me. I just don't feel the satisfying element that everyone else seems to see!
>> ARTICLE
i have the same opinion with the 6 episodes, i think i would have enjoyed it way more if it was a movie for example instead of a series format
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I think that would have worked well!!
>> ARTICLE
I will pick it back up eventually, I try not to drop shows.

I get that the fun of Amagami SS is to see different types of relationships, but I'm more of a quality over quantity type. I'd probably play the Visual Novel in that case anyway.

When you say satisfying endings I think it's something else to me. The ending was pretty conclusive in the first arc of Amagami, but I wasn't very "satisfied" because I didn't care much to begin with. It's not the ending that I am disappointed with, it's everything leading up to that point.

As for TTG, I don't love every episode but I do think that they all contribute to the big picture by the end so they're all needed.


>> ARTICLE
> I get that the fun of Amagami SS is to see different types of relationships, but I'm more of a quality over quantity type. 

See my problem with TTG is I just don't see it. A lot of people don't like Amagami SS because of that and that's fine it isn't for everyone but TTG I just can't personally acknowledge the appeal.

Yeah conclusive and satisfying aren't always the same thing but with some many anime ending on cliffhangers it's become synonymous with me haha. 4 episodes isn't a lot of time to give you to care about characters but it tries it's best to let that happen!

When the end of TTG all came together I was having "Oh wow that's what happened" moments but nothing to make me amazed or impressed :/
>> ARTICLE
TTG is a show that has a clear message and everything it does is purposefully directed towards artistically hammering that message into its watchers' heads. I could talk about all the different things it does and what they mean but I don't think your issue has anything to do with not understanding what the show did but rather what it didn't do.

 If you watched it and you happen to be the type of person who really likes all the things that it didn't show so that it could achieve it's tightly focused status then you would find it disappointing. You never see the narrator's romance with Akashi, you never get to see the characters from outside the narrator's POV, you never really find out the details of how or why the narrator is trapped in his odd predicament and the ending is incredibly inconclusive and open ended if viewed through any other lens than a thematic one. 

This is a coming of age story about one man's realization that life is worth living. Nothing more and nothing less. It achieves that goal spectacularly and with gusto but if you wanted something else from the show you will find it sorely lacking. 

Edit:

TL;DR  TTG would be unable to be so perfectly focused on showing what it wanted to if it didn't deliberately not show what it didn't want to. If you're looking for what it didn't want to show then sorry it's not for you.
>> ARTICLE
It seems for having such a specific goal it's really appreciated for that. It must achieve it really well. I couldn't care too much for Watashi and so I probably didn't get wrapped up to much in his coming of age story.
>> ARTICLE
This is well said. This show is driven by theme, and everything it does is in service of that theme. It's more like an art house film or a piece of literature in that respect than most anime.
>> ARTICLE
The regretting past choices made me realize that the timeline the story continues in is arguably the worst timeline for Wastashi. He spent two years indoors and didn't get to really know anyone besides Ozu and Akashi(unless you count the memories he got from the tatami galaxy).
>> ARTICLE
this might be another thing that ticked me off too. In this timeline i dont think he met akashi or even had a meaningful conversation with her, in fact he spent the entire time alone in his room.

And it was probably the timeline where he had the less interaction with ozu too, since the other times he was in a club with him 
>> ARTICLE
They talked atleast once when Watashi asks about her Mochiguman at the book fair. Also the fact that the Mochiguman was switched with his boxers shows the "thread of fate". This is definitely the least interaction, but I think it makes the message more poignant. Here, barely knowing each other, Watashi is able to ask her out and they develop a meaningful relationship. This means all those other times too Watashi could've easily asked her, but was impeded by his own false ideals. It really emphasizes the idea of taking the opportunity in front of you. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't see what there is to not get. At its  simplest, the message is to be realistic and take the opportunities you get. The message isn't really anything new and seems applicable to everyone, especially those still in college or high school. 

Of course, it differs from other anime in that it doesn't engage in escapism, but rather portrays humans experiences realistically(although the means of showing these are pretty abstract). 
>> ARTICLE
> the message is to be realistic

Maybe that was my problem with it haha whenever an anime is described with that word it tends to be one that doesn't click with me haha. 
>> ARTICLE
This show is absolutely one of my favorites. Top 5 for sure. Most of what I'd say about this show has already been said.

As a fan of literature, this feels like animated literature to me. It's like watching a novel from the Magical Realism genre. The way the themes and symbolism are so expertly weaved into the dialogue, the visuals, and the music just feels like a piece of literary art to me. I think this show is genuinely something special.

I'd be curious to know if the people who "didn't get it" were skewed toward the younger anime viewers. Though the plots of the episodes were sometimes cartoonish, the characters and their struggles are more realistic and mature than most anime. 

The show is entertaining, but it's more interested in presenting thematic and character struggles than offering escapism. In fact, it offers the opposite of escapism, and asks the viewer to evaluate their own attitudes toward their lives and circumstances. In this way I think it's more Art with a capital "A" than a great deal of anime.

Really enjoyed reading everyone's thoughts each episode! Thanks /u/BlindPiratez for hosting a rewatch of this masterpiece!
>> ARTICLE
Have to say that while episodes 10 and 11 are awesome, I also enjoyed the rest as well.  Probably because I'm a sucker for timeloop scenarios, but still, all of the episodes were very well done.

Episodes 1-3 were excellent in having just enough similarity to tie them together while differing to explore characters, and the love square (lol) episodes were done at least as well as in Durarara, where each episode fleshes out the full scenario in a different way through the same events.
>> ARTICLE
First off let me say that i didnt like Tatami galaxy so bear with me while i explain why

Im gonna start with the characters. I disliked every single character except for osu, watashi was probably the one i hated the most due to everything he is, and everything he is not. I didnt like anyone from the supporting cast either, either it be the film guy or the samurai guy or the gf of the samurai or other minors, they either where completely uninteresting (gf) or annoying (samurai and film guy). The worst character in the show and one of the reasons i disliked the show was Akashi but i will explain further why.

The art was weird but not in a good way, while all the works of this guy have a different art style i must say i didnt like this one at all because the characters looked weird (ozu looked weird but thats a good thing). Also the animation for something that reuses a lot of footage from previous episodes was just ok. I also didnt like the color(?) what i mean by this is the world felt dead, everything was a shade of gray, some things where more lively in colors and some scenes too but overall it didnt look good. I didnt like the inconsistency of the crowds sometimes they had colors other times they where just grey (was there a point to it)

Truthfully the only episode i thought was straight up good was 4.5 tatami, that episode was excellent and it brought the whole series together, but one episode doesnt make the whole series great. I completely hated the 3clubs arc (each had a different love interest) and i hated it much more than i loved episode 10. I also felt that the repetition made the series more boring with each episode, especially when half the episode was either re used footage or re used dialogue and jokes.

The narration and it being super fast seems like something that only makes it harder to follow for no reason at all. This is one of the reasons i do not like shaft, making something easy to understand more confusing just for the hell of it doesnt make sense and it adds nothing of value to the series.

Now with most things out of the way ill share some positives, episode 10 was amazing and i really liked it. Also the way everything comes together and how with each every episode you notice something new of the already established story that happens throughout these 2 years. Ozu was a really interesting character and fun too, unfortunately he was the only one in the entire show. Im usually a defender of if the start is weak but the finale is really good then its worth a watch, but in this case the "slow/weak" part takes 9 episodes and the good part is one episode with the ending being a little bit better than the rest of the show but still not something worth the enthusiasm for. I would say the payoff from the ending is not worth the time spent.

Now back to akashi. Every character in this show except the main character was underdeveloped, would it hurt to have 1 episode for ozu and one for akashi? just to establish them better as characters and not as some sort of just there to help convey the message? This is the reason i despised akashi because she didnt have any impact on the show. It seems she has some impact on MC but it never leads to nothing, also the sub plot of romance between these 2 was unfulfilling. Hopefully amethysthan can explain better the part of the romance that i did not like, because i am unable to do so. It was a bit like Akashi could have not even existed and the show wouldnt make much difference, and the way the relantionship is portrayed makes me wonder if theres any meaning to having a female lead. I also hated how they made the relantionship work "Because it is not the purpose of this program to show the further development of my relationship with Akashi, I will refrain from showing too much...Nothing else is as boring to tell as a story of successful love" this quote rubbed me the wrong way too.The way Akashi was portrayed was someone that retorts to anyone and independent like she can take care of herself and is strong enough to do so, it makes me wonder what she saw in the worthless piece of trash that is the MC, but i guess harem anime even have worse relationship dynamics so whatever. Ok enough about akashi and the romantic relantionship.



Ill just say that the singular episodes where boring most of the time with some things good here and there, overall the first 9 episodes where boring for me, since i didnt either relate or care much about the obnoxious characters. It felt fine for the first episodes but then i just lost interest in all of them (probably because of the 3 clubs arc).

For my final paragraph i wanted to talk about the message that was conveyed, it was a really good message. From some things i've read people say it was about friendship and how to create relationships with other people (only as friends too). I dont agree with the previous statement, i think the show was more about how to enjoy life, this is especially obvious in episode 10 where he goes through every room and every possibility of his, and he realizes that in every world he had something different in the room depending on which route he had taken, this leads him and me to realize that while he was a whinny bitch the whole show he actually enjoyed himself while trying to pursue his goals but when he inevitability failed he would declare that it was all for nothing. The message conveyed in the show was about enjoying one's life in every step of the way and have fun with it, in my opinion.

Unfortunately the same cant be said about the show because it was the opposite of fun, repetitively boring.

We see eye to eye on this, I honestly hate when they do things like this! 

I liked Akashi but agree with your points on her a lot. I wish she was more developed and yeah seeing why she fell for the MC could have used some more explaining.

But... But Tatami Galaxy is Madhouse... 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I made a comment in my original post about it being Madhouse :p

I'm just saying that shows that look different and seem to do so just to be different is something I really don't like. I'm currently watching the Monogatari series while I was watching this and they shared that similarity!
>> ARTICLE
Ahh gotchya. Just clarifying.

I think I disagree to a point; I honestly appreciate anime that take risks and present unique styles solely based on that, but that doesn't necessarily make me like them. If they want my compassion they need to show they can use it well (i.e. Ping Pong). 

I take it you don't like Monogatari? Personally, I feel as though Monogatari (and Shaft in general) are a great example of how to use a unique visual style to phenomenal affect. While I would agree with the complaint that many of their shows are portrayed very similarly, I think that people downplay the differences as well and while Madoka and Monogatari and Ef and SZS all have surface-level similarities they all have a very distinct feel to them. That aside though, Shaft's style simply allows them to do **so much** that traditional styles simply can't achieve. People may call them "pretentious" but the truth is that their fast-cut surreal worlds are simply jam-packed with references, symbolism and some of the best shot-framing anime has to offer, and they achieve all of this without ever interrupting the flow of their stories by creating an environment that allows it. And don't even get me started on their dialogue: it's like actual people talking. Convoluted, personal, often pointless, and inevitably able to demonstrate the intentions and personalities of the characters while still keeping them wrapped in the layers that humans have.

Sorry, huge Shaft/Shinbo fanboy here. Just wanted to lend a different perspective, I totally respect anyone who might not feel the same way. 
>> ARTICLE
For me story and characters are miles ahead I rarely ever consider art or styles into my factor for enjoying things so we just see things differently on that part.

As for Monogatari I enjoy a lot of it actually but it also has a lot of stuff I dislike in it. 

> without ever interrupting the flow of their stories

I disagree with this. All the cuts to black or pages with text in Monogatari are soooo distracting. The first season I was so annoyed by it! I'm on SS now and have gotten used to it but I still hate seeing "black frame" every few moments as it just pulls me out of the show :/

I enjoy the dialogue and the characters (most of them) that's not what I have a problem with :p


>> ARTICLE
I would definitely consider characters to easily be the most important factor in a show, I just like to appreciate all the elements that go into the show. After all, part of why I watch anime as opposed to absorbing stories through other mediums is that it has the ability to present those characters in a unique way using all of the tools at its disposal, so I feel like all of those matter to at least some degree.

> I disagree with this

Well, everyone has their own opinions. I feel like the black cuts and text pages are so quick and silent that they pretty much just fade into the story, but have the option to be paused on for those interested in absorbing more information. It's like adding an extra 10 minutes to the episode, but only for those who want it. IMO genius. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more those coloured empty frames, do you really appreciate those too? lol


>> ARTICLE
I'll try my best to reply. 

>I didnt like the inconsistency of the crowds sometimes they had colors other times they where just grey (was there a point to it)

>This is one of the reasons i do not like shaft, making something easy to understand more confusing just for the hell of it doesnt make sense and it adds nothing of value to the series.

You have to remember that the story is told from the POV of Watashi, and he is an unreliable narrator. Therefore, Watashi's feelings will often alter what he sees, and thus changes the art of the show. For example, whenever he's with Akashi, its always bright colors because he enjoys being with her so much. It's also why Ozu looks evil till the end, cause Watashi perceives him as such. It's also why the narration is so fast, because his thoughts are such. You'll also notice that the fast parts were for the most part part of the time loop or supplemental information. Also the studio was **Madhouse** lol. 

On the point of Akashi, I do believe her and other minor characters had characterization, although minimal. Again, the story is told from Watashi's point, so we only see them as he saw them. Often, a person who exhibits one side of them to a specific person, and in Watashi's case, his time with them wasn't much either. Of course, this could just be a convenient excuse, but I do believe the emphasis is on Watashi, so the other characters don't matter more than their effect on him. 

See my other comment in this thread for what I understood the meaning of the show to be, it's very different from yours and your understanding seems incomplete. 

Of course, if you cannot relate to Watashi and disagree with the message of the show, you will dislike the show. Even personally, I did not love Shin Sekai Yori as others did due to my intense dislike of the theme of the show. 

One last note, I find it hard not to relate to Watashi. He is an idealistic man who hopes for the best in his life, with misconstrued goals and the weight of constantly bearing his failures. It would be hard to say that a person has never been overly optimistic or regretted what they did in the past and let it affect them in the present. 

tl;dr You misunderstood the premise of the show and thus interpreted it incorrectly. 

>> ARTICLE
what has the studio anything to do with anything? i was making a example with shaft.

I didnt misunderstand the premise of the show and saying this just means you actually didnt understand what i said. Yes watashi was the narrator and also a character, thats doesnt make me like it any more, in fact due to me hating or disliking him so much only makes that i would dislike the show too.

i didnt finish my message of the show cause i already said enough, i also couldnt properly explain what i meant so i just gave a brief summary of it.

I also disliked SSY, i didnt hate because of the message it was more because of watashi. The message was fine. 

You find it hard because you might be like him in that way, i am not. I dont hope for the best in life, i live mostly one day at a time and my goal is to enjoy myself, i also dont have great goals in mind like most people do, i mostly just want to have a good enough life, basically dont be poor. I dont regret much of what i have done either, of course some things i do but everyone does, and im not really optimistic either but i wouldnt say im a pessimist either
>> ARTICLE
> The worst character in the show and one of the reasons i disliked the show was Akashi but i will explain further why. 

Aaaaaaand you lost me. Seriously though, while I can follow you in most of what you are saying, I disagree on this. Also, I thought that episodes 6 and 9 were very enjoyable along with 10 and 11 but I digress. 

There are scores of girls like Akashi, especially in fields like engineering, and to me she felt very real. I think for her it's more that Watashi **isn't** chasing her that gets her interested. In the show we get repeated images of men being actively interested in pursuing her, like Jogasaki at the movie club. Girls like Akashi scare easily and don't know what to do with such attention, so they drive people away that get close or they put up emotional walls. Watashi not hitting on her and actually being easy to talk is a great reason for Akashi to go for him. 

Not too mention that she already liked him after the Moguchiman incident (which is shown twice for good reason), she got it in her head back then that Watashi couldn't be a bad guy after all. 
>> ARTICLE
im in engineering but the problem wasnt her character, its hard to explain but she was fine as is. I didnt like how the show portrayed her and her relantionship with MC. I also didnt like how you dont know anything about her at all.

The worst is how this show shows the same things over and over but they didnt either care to develop anyone except the MC. While this may be the point of the show that doesnt mean im gonna like it when every single character while boring or annoying was still more enjoyable to watch than this MC
>> ARTICLE
I agree that more character development would be nice to make you feel more attached to the characters. 

I think though that given how they went about it, you still know plenty about the characters. It's strange how every single character in this series has a real life equivalent for me. So in that way the characters are already interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
i made an edit i meant the problem WASNT her character and more what the show did to her, some person below in the comments explained it well https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3iqw2n/spoilers_the_tatami_galaxy_overall_rewatch/cuivcm4

i guess if you can relate to them it would be better, i cant relate to any of them so that might be one of the reasons
>> ARTICLE
> it makes me wonder what she saw in the worthless piece of trash that is the MC

The show portrays it very in a subtle manner, but it's there. When he interacts with her, it's not like the way other men do. He's not talking to her to try and hit on her, so she feels like she can let her guard down. Her comfort around him is most overt when she allows herself to collapse into him after freaking out about the moths. There are also several points where he's seen making her laugh, especially when she's watching his crappy movies. And most importantly, when the men were harassing her at the Mochiguman show, he stepped in to intervene. It's clear that they enjoy each others company quite a bit even if their relationship has subtle differences between timelines.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that there were moments but they never really had much to stand on. I personally had not too much problem with it since romance isn't really the focus of this show. 

On that note /u/Vlayer , since you prefer the journey romances how did you feel about the attraction/relationship of the characters?
>> ARTICLE
If you're talking about Akashi and Watashi, then I thought that it more than fulfilled its purpose in the series.

I could understand and buy into why Watashi liked Akashi and vice versa, neither of them were perfect and in fact had some negative qualities about them as people. However, the show displayed how one party's positive qualities were attractive to the other party. It wasn't a "madly in love" scenario, but they fit together really well as you saw each little interaction they had.
>> ARTICLE
For the purpose of the series I was fine with it too but would you say that you cared more for the romance in the arc you saw of Amagami? 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say I cared more about Watashi and Akashi. Their chemistry was better and it felt genuine.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. I'm actually baffled by that. 

They barely had communication other than simple small talk haha. I guess if you didn't care about the characters it's hard for you to care about the relationship but I found it was supported a lot more then this show showed Akashi and Watashi's chemistry.

That first arc is one of the weaker ones in terms of chemistry though IMO
>> ARTICLE
I did feel that Junichi and Haruka were a bit "shallow". All Junichi did was prove how persistent and confident he could be, so she fell for him. All Haruka did was be attractive and popular. There wasn't much depth.

Watashi and Akashi didn't have much depth either, but for the time spent on the romance it created a very convincing one with great chemistry. Watashi didn't like Akashi just because she's an attractive girl, he also liked how [blunt she could be](http://gfycat.com/AdvancedFreeIbex), her [confidence](http://gfycat.com/ActiveDarlingAmericansaddlebred), or how she had a cute/childish side to her with the fear of moths and her collection of Mochiguman.

Small details, but together they paint a larger picture of the character. This is also enforced by how everything is from Watashi's perspectives, and the look/feel the show takes on whenever Akashi is involved.

Characters and their relationship to one another is a big draw to me when it comes to series. One of my favorite(yet simple) romances in anime would have to be Okabe and Kurisu for that exact reason. You fully understand why they like each other, especially from Okabe's point of view as Kurisu is often the only other person he can rely on. 
>> ARTICLE
It is the least believable arc out of the series so I do agree with you there. I feel like of course Watashi would like her since she's a pretty amazing character but the other way around I can't find much since they don't really show us. 

For Haruka and Junichi it's more of the first time Haruka really falling in love. She's a playful person and Junichi is able to keep up with her. (no matter how cringey episode 3 got sometimes haha)

Amagami SS is mostly from the MC's POV too but the monologues really allow you to get a sense of what the heroine is thinking so it adds to the whole falling in love bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Realizing why Akashi likes Watashi is definitely harder to spot because it is from Watashi's perspective, which means that her actions aren't as noticable as his.

But as the poster above said, Akashi was comfortable around Watashi, she could let [her guard down](http://gfycat.com/DeliciousForsakenBats). Most likely because she thought of him as a good person without ulterior motives.

Her enjoying his films is more proof that she likes him as a person, as usually a creator expresses themselves through their work. This is also why she called him out when he showed everyone that video about Jougasaki, because it showed Akashi a side of Watashi she didn't like.
>> ARTICLE
i agree with those points but those were things that happened in disjointed timelines, but i guess the first phrase explains it. Sometimes all you need is to be a little different.
>> ARTICLE
You also have to remember that everything is from Watashi's point of view, and for most of the series he does not have a very positive view of himself or life in general, so *everything* is skewed. You don't even know what Ozu actually looks like till the end. Other than the few hints pointed out by /u/ChangloriousBasterds the viewer isn't given much to go on outside of Watashi's perspective.
>> ARTICLE
It's a chemistry thing. Chemistry is one of the hardest things to grasp in any animated show. The way TTG portrayed it is how two people who are naturally kind of hard to approach can have a dynamic with each other that's somehow way more natural, relaxed and comfortable than their dynamics with other people. 

Most relationships don't start from grand gestures, or elaborate attempts and pursuits to gain someone's favor. More often than not it's just two people who enjoy each other's company and naturally gravitate towards each other, who just click like that.

I thought TTG portrayed that initial connection very well, it was always present in some way or the other during their interactions. It's not so much 'meant to be', but more 'hit it off'. 
>> ARTICLE
The show was a really different experience. I loved every second of it! 

Also, no discussion thread for the specials?

Hi all,

I've watched this show twice in an effort to understand its appeal, but I've still not managed to see it. Is it really that good?

Honestly I thought the main character wasn't likeable and I honestly didn't find many of the story arcs interesting or compelling. While the last 2 episodes were quite interesting, it felt like the anime was really draggy and uninteresting throughout, only showing some promise in the final 2 episodes.

I understand that it's exposition and delivery are 2 of its main appeals, but comparing it to Bakemonogatari (one of my favourite series), I felt like a lot of the monologues weren't very well written, or were they interesting to listen to. I do watch the show raw without subtitles, and so its maybe because just listening to fast paced dialogue switches me off a lot of the time.

With regards to the animation quality and character designs, I found them pretty dull in terms of coloration, but overall quite okay since I guess their designs are intentionally the way they are.

Can /r/anime sell me on this? So far I have to give the show (after 2 watches) at most a 3/10, and I don't think much of /r/anime agrees with such a rating.


>> ARTICLE
Day late to the party. Strange feelings with this one. It clearly had a lot of gaps, even though the last episode seemed to be an attempt to reconcile for its strange storytelling style. There's quite a few things that I can't quite get over in how everyone acted and the things the story covered, which ultimately seemed irrelevant (especially since they sweep the culmination of the romance away). The final role reversal was also way too heavy handed, even given the show's nature. Didn't quite feel natural.

However I did enjoy myself a lot. I steadily got into the rhythm of things, always interested in - if not strictly enjoying - every curveball the story threw at me. It's a good tale and it's well supported by its themes. Being a college student though, I knew that this was going to try and connect to me on some level merely by the premise of feeling disillusioned. I didn't let it get that deep under my skin, and I think people with this show (like others with other anime) take the premise disproportionately strongly, giving it a higher rating.

Anyways, the aesthetic realization was mostly solid. I liked how they didn't really care about the size of hands a lot of the time, giving it a sense of always realizing that the characters could go strange at any moment. Almost every time they eat, for example, with the ballooning effect. Great use of the cartoon style. What I really never liked though were the real-life shots. I felt they should have been relegated to the intro (like FLCL does) and not brought into the show despite the fact that it looked semi-natural. I just didn't like how it drew me out of everything constantly.

If there's one wish I would have had for this show, it would have been them giving the side characters more significance. The buck toothed guy particularly was thrown in at the end and I really didn't care about where his story went. The others were slightly better, but I never got a firm grasp on the like I eventually did for the main characters. Suppose that's just my idealism though. There's a lot in the various stories that's left hanging in the air and I wanted to see the aftermath. Inconclusiveness was the really flaw here.

I will definitely recommend it in the future, though with specific tastes in mind. Also those subtitles. Criminey... After a while I really just got sick of the rote reading of the information. I wanted more emotion to be put into it. I don't get what the speed talking was meant to enhance except make expository scenes slightly less painful to sit through. 

I give thumbs up!

The show I've been really impressed with lately is [Air Gear](http://myanimelist.net/anime/857/Air_Gear).  Technically the story goes on after the 26 episodes, but there was never a second season so the show really is only one season long.

It's kinda' fanservice-y and falls victim to a few shounen cliches, but overall I was really, REALLY surprised by where it went and enjoyed it the whole time.  It's not really an anime you have to think about, but that's not always a bad thing.

Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.

Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.

I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.

Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.

Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.

They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.

Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.

That's what I was looking for

KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.

I think you'll find that's open to interpretation

In this case it wasn't.

Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.

Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-

Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.

5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.

> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.

Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.

Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias.

I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.

Lol, u prob wanted to stay off of /r/anime during the entire fall season then.

the guy probably wanted you to get the same enjoyment he experienced, I dont think he meant any harm. 

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.

I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.

recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.

It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.

True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.
>> ARTICLE
Why do we need this thread posted every week?
>> ARTICLE
I'm here quite a bit, usually I just see people complain, I think this is only the second time I've seen a consolidated list.
>> ARTICLE
I will say this does illustrate the recency bias people have. Statistically speaking, what are the odds that the last two seasons have produced 3 of the Top 10? Even when you consider that most people don't watch anime older than 10 years old, unless it's a classic (NGE, Bebop, Utena, GitS, original Gundam for example) this does seem pretty skewed. 

In my experience, it might be because people have a tendency to rate airing anime against each other, rather than against their whole list. I know I've had to adjust scores after considering my own tendency to do this. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call 00 "original Gundam".  While it's definitely no G Reco or Iron Blooded Orphans, it's not as old as Zeta or anything that age.  Most of the alternate era series have a similar feel to em, like 00, Seed, and current stuff, than the original Universal Century stuff does. 
>> ARTICLE
On the contrary, I'd argue that it's because the popularity of anime makes it so that recent shows get bigger budgets.  The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

There's also the matter that recent shows are likely to be more in line with the tastes of a modern viewer.

These, and various other reasons, are why recent shows tend to get better reviews than older ones.
>> ARTICLE
>The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

The voice acting and music are as good as they've always been, or at least since late 80s. As for the art, I think that in 2005-2008 the studios have mastered digital production and can produce steady high quality animation unless they rush things or cut the budget.

>> ARTICLE
Good points, though I'd argue that English dubs are still improving and have still got a long way to go compared to Japanese VAs.

OSTs have been getting better though - if only because the budgets are bigger.
>> ARTICLE
I think the recency bias has more to it than people just snubbing older series though

1) Older series are just harder to come by on the streaming services. Even if they are on there, you have to really dig through all the recent series to get there. Streaming services tend to push their Simulcasts to justify their licensing expenses

2) Anime crowd skews young. People watch anime of their age before earlier ones. I watched anime from 1995-1999. It wasn't until 2011 that I caught up to things from the 80s and 70s (though I did watch Mazinger-Z and Voltes V in the 90s). 

3) People who HAVE seen those might have moved on to something else in their life, and thus are never really around to mention it enough in today's anime communities, because while they were good, there just wasn't *enough* about them to talk about for 10-20 years. *Pivotal* series like NGE and Cowboy Bebop have been talked about and dissected for so long, particularly in the West, they're just ingrained in the community's collective memory. 

Other series just don't have the same staying power, unless they're a genre defining series. 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu? Meanwhile, how many people will still be talking about Madoka, K-On, Monogatari, and JoJo? Now think about how many Shirobakos, Syokugekis, and Shigatsus there have been in the 20 years since 1995, and have since been forgotten. That contributes *immensely* to recency bias. 
>> ARTICLE
> 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu?

Not sure about Syokugeki, but the other two yes absolutely. Shigatsu will at least have the staying power of Anohana (5 years) or Angel Beats! (6 years).

Or possibly because people have rubbish rating scales and don't actually care about the numbers they slap on.
>> ARTICLE
But of course you, with your omnipotent, perfectly refined taste, would never do such a thing. /s 

Elitism much? 
>> ARTICLE
No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale. I've seen /u/JexInfinite 's opinion parroted many times in this subreddit, no idea where you're getting the "elitism" claim from.
>> ARTICLE
> No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale.

Its not just people. The entire rating industry had moved toward a 6/7-10 rating scale. 6 these days means terrible, 7 average, 8 good, 9 great, 10 fantastic.

Its just normal. You looking at almost all game or movie ratings, they conform to the warped rating scale. Its just how it is. I think it ultimately came from the academic grading system, where a 50% is a fail, so anything under 5/10 is meaningless.

There is really no point complaining about people using the most common system of rating. 
>> ARTICLE
I vote on a binary "Did I enjoy it or not?" scale.  either an anime gets a 10 or a 1.  
>> ARTICLE
Those people typically are the people less experienced in anime tend to gravitate heavily towards the popular or new shows and slap high numbers on everything because they haven't seen much else and it's all unique and new

This is probably seen in practice by me personally with Gundam 00 vs. Code Geass. Both very similar in quality and plot from the same age, from the same studio. I enjoyed Gundam a lot more but they're two shows in practice which I would see having almost the same score if they were equally popular

But most of the people who've seen 10 shows and given 10 to all of them have seen Code Geass due to popularity and being recommended everywhere. Most of these haven't watched or heard much of Gundam so it has a far fairer score
>> ARTICLE
I've heard of gundam all my life, but it was only after I came to /r/anime that I first heard of Code Geass - so if anything, I'd argue that the bias would go the other way.

Still, as you say, I honestly still don't see what's so good about Code Geass.

And this is why I don't rate my list at all :\

I don't rate my list either for the most part, but some notable shows I'll put a 9 or 10 for reference

I think that's more a result of people not watching anime they know are going to be trash. If something doesn't warrant even a 5 from the people who've already watched it, it's hardly going to garner much viewership from everyone else.

I rate everything I watch a 10, so I'm part of the problem.
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of snobby edgelords on this sub who think you're a scrub if you have an average score over 6. Pay them no mind. If you like something, score it whatever the hell you want. 

Just keep in mind how good you think it is compared to ALL the shows you've seen, not just the recent ones. 
>> ARTICLE
Average score means nothing if you don't know what shows they rate. Some people only watch good shows. You're suggesting that scores be on a bell curve, but I deny this. If a show is good, it is good. The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.
>> ARTICLE
I rate on a bell curve, but the curve is centred around 7.5. Most shows on my list is rated 7 or 8. I simply try to avoid shows if before watching I feel that there's no chance for me to rate the show 8. Life is too short to watch mediocre anime (or read mediocre books, or watch mediocre movies, or play mediocre games), so I don't even bother.
>> ARTICLE
My MAL graph just coincidentally happens to be somewhat resembling of a bell curve, but I would never intentionally adjust the score to fit with everything else. I look at each individual show/movie as its own thing when rating.
>> ARTICLE
> The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.

This is why I kept my "10" rating for Attack on Titan even after seeing much better shows. I just love it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it does, the point of 10 point systems is for it to be relative to other entries 
>> ARTICLE
> Some people only watch good shows.

Yeah, this is sort of the justification I give for rating 10 across the board. I pick what I watch very carefully so that I know I'll enjoy whatever I invest my time in.
>> ARTICLE
So, you've either seen up to 15 shows, or are really generous with scores.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I'm just easy to please. Then again, I've seen no more then 60 shows so I haven't consumed anywhere near as much as material as the average MAL user.
>> ARTICLE
yes, this. Plus from what I've seen from over 20 years of watching, anime *has* gotten better. It'd be dumb to normalize your score to the "average" anime when that average keeps going up every year. 

Instead, I normalize mine to the status quo of being bored. If an anime entertains me even a little bit, it gets a 6. If it makes me feel like I wasted my time, it gets 4 or below. I rarely finish shows that are 5 or below. 

PLUS, people by and large operate based off of recommendations. Essentially normalizing to the average *of what you've seen* is just grading how accurate people's recommendations were to you, which is counter to the spirit of ratings. 

Grading on a bell curve will make sense *only* if you select your anime to watch randomly.
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is a fantastic show because of how it did something completely new. It created several character archetypes which didn't previously exist. Just because those archetypes are now overused and everywhere, it doesn't diminish the value of how they originally affected the industry.

Akira is another example of something that was ahead of its time, but isn't necessary up to today's standard of quality. (I would argue that it absolutely is, but that's beside the point.)
>> ARTICLE
Technically, NGE didn't create archetypes, it just morphed them slightly and made tsundere/kuudere (Asuka vs Rei) more popular. 
>> ARTICLE
Less popular shows get less views, which means less ratings, which means less popularity. It's a loop.

Then there are people like me who just don't have time to watch terrible shows and just stick with what're regarded as "good" shows. What happens then is that my ratings get inflated because I don't watch enough bad shows.

Also the fact that Gunbuster isn't on the list is really sad, that show has probably the best ending of all time (I cry every time the colour hits in!)

Well atleast ping pong, tatami galaxy, and rainbow are high up.

I could think of a bunch of anime that if they came out in the last year would be much higher on this list. Outlaw star, The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, and GTO arn't even on here.

well, it's a lot easier to obtain old movies legally than it is to obtain old anime too.

recency and hype bias. Just like Erased and Rakugo. Both great shows, but not top 10 material
>> ARTICLE
Did you like Konosuba?
>> ARTICLE
I loved konosuba lol The comedy in that show was some of the best I've seen, although I havn't seen that many comedy shows. I honestly found it way more enjoyable than One Punch in my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Both of them are parody shows with stupid yet funny comedy. But I think opm was better overall. Better story, better comedy and better characters. The only good character that came out of konosuba was Kazuma imo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its different for everyone. I just thought the gags/silliness was a lot funnier in konosuba 
>> ARTICLE
OPM has top notch fight scenes with amazing fight direction, an awesome soundtrack, interesting characters, some shounen subversion elements, and most of the comedy was on point. It has almost everything you could want from a light-hearted action series. That's all some people want in a show, so to them it's perfect.
>> ARTICLE
New "twist" on the regular superhero story, cool and likable side characters, competent pacing, interesting setting, great animation & art, good soundtrack, and many people found the comedy to be pretty funny.

It was also a show that I'd say got better as it went along. It started out kinda cool but got more interesting with the Hero Association, got more intense with the Sea King arc, and the Boros fight was the best part of the show and a great finale. I can see why a majority of people would enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty enjoyable myself. I just don't see why people give it a 10/10 when the show barely had any story. My friend gave OPM a 10/10 yet FMA Brotherhood an 8... I just don't understand how its a master piece with such a high rating  lol
>> ARTICLE
Seems you're focusing on a pointless rating system.
>> ARTICLE
Well its not really that, its just people calling it a masterpiece like its the greatest thing is what I don't understand. It was good but nothing that made me say damn that was so amazing greatest thing I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
That's precisely my point. You're focused on a show rated at a 10 being objectively better than an 8, which really couldn't be further from the truth. The entire rating system is a shitshow precisely because people reduce extremely subjective shows to an extremely objective method of comparing them, and completely ignore what makes them unique.

As far as this specific example, I can see why someone would enjoy OPM so much. Its short, sweet, and just a lot of fun. No fat on the story. good visuals. most importantly, its fun, light entertainment. Its not one of my favourite shows, but I can see why someone enjoys it so much.
>> ARTICLE
FMA is quite a bit different than OPM. It's quite a bit more serious (at most points) and can certainly take on a darker tone in some parts. It's also not trying to be subversive. It's a straight up shounen that takes itself more serious than most and with a much more focused narrative. For some people this makes FMA better, for others it's not as much what they're looking for.
>> ARTICLE
Ratings are subjective and a lot of people just enjoyed the show. I don't think there really needs to be much more than that. IMO not having a big in-depth story isn't an issue if it is still one of the most enjoyable shows I've watched. At the end of the day it just comes down to how people rate things and the easiest way to rate something is by how much you enjoyed watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Rating on enjoyment is so much more subjective than rating the actual show (eg characters, plot, themes, soundtrack, animation).
>> ARTICLE
Obviously, but every rating is going to be subjective anyways. In addition you could have the most well written characters and the best objective quality story in existence, but people may not enjoy it. Personally I find just as much value in a review based purely on how much someone enjoyed something as a review that is trying to be objective. At the end of the day I don't care how good something is if I don't enjoy it, and I don't care how bad something is if I do enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I find reviews based on enjoyment to be utterly useless. I can never experience that enjoyment the same way, if at all. What I *can* experience is the characters, plot, soundtrack, etc. Rating and reviewing based on things that are actually in the show rather than how a show made you feel is a lot more logical, and produces scores that have meaning.
>> ARTICLE
But like I said even those things are subjective. Where I see a good character another may see an insufferable twat. Everyone has differing tastes in music, so a soundtrack may be good but still may not be anything you would enjoy. I would think rating the plot would be the easiest to do "objectively", but even then it is usually going to be based on prior experience. When you've watched/read hundreds of shows/books it will be a lot harder to find an original plot that stands out, but for someone without much experience an average or mediocre plot may be amazing.

IMO no review by some random person online is very helpful regardless of the criteria used. A review only becomes truly helpful once you've begun to understand the context the reviewer is looking at the work through. If you have totally different opinions on what constitutes a good character, or anything else, then a reviewer saying that a character is great means nothing to you. Until I understand a reviewer I take their reviews with a huge grain of salt.
>> ARTICLE
Subjective, obviously, but other people are able to witness and experience them. *Nobody* else can experience how the show made you feel, so it's a useless point.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody can tell me for certain how I'm going to feel, but a ton of people can make accurate predictions based on how they felt. If a lot of people think something is sad/funny/enjoyable then I will most likely have the same experience. The whole basis of an averaged score on a site like MAL is that most people will fall in line with the average. If something is rated a 7, regardless of the reasons but as long as those people were as honest as possible, the majority of people will like it but not love it. Maybe you have some particular tastes, but then you can just find a reviewer with tastes more similar to your own. Like on Steam there are curators or, I imagine, the clubs on MAL.

To get back to the original topic of OPM being highly rated, I don't think most people care about an in-depth story. Most people can find plenty of enjoyment in a lacking product, and OPM is executed extremely well in all other aspects. In addition it isn't like it has a bad story - it simply has very little story which I see no problem with. I mean it works for Dark Souls right?
>> ARTICLE
Does your friend rate on personal enjoyment?
>> ARTICLE
Quite clearly, he would. If OPM is higher, it could only be because he enjoyed it more.
>> ARTICLE
When I asked him he just said FMA was "alright" lol
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like it wasn't for him.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm well I think you have to look at it differently. One Punch Man is trying to accomplish different things than FMA. How well does each accomplish what they set out to do? Personally I think OPM does a better job even if FMA has a more ambitious story. More story doesn't automatically make something superior. There are many other aspects to consider. 
>> ARTICLE
The amount of story it had was perfect for the atmosphere the show was trying to create. Not every show has to have super in-depth character backgrounds to be a masterpiece. Dragging out the story would've slowed down the show too much to keep it interesting imo.

At the end of the day it was a really fun show with great music, visuals, comedic timing, and amazing fight scenes. What more do you need?
>> ARTICLE
There was no goal from what I remember with the show? It was just this monster showed up, he goes to fight it. Again I still enjoyed the show I just feel like its way over hyped imo 
>> ARTICLE
IMO part of what makes the show interesting is that the villains are the ones trying to achieve some goal (and get all the power up sequences and other tropey things) instead of Saitama. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably because of the hype. I really like OPM, but I don't think it was a masterpiece as a lot of people claim, the anime was really good and had nice animation, but the best part of the story is still in the webcomics in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind
>> ARTICLE
It's almost like people can have their own opinions and whatnot.
>> ARTICLE
While I can't say I'd give OPM anything above 9 I can easily see why FMA:B would get 8. It's somewhat too long for the story it's telling and has its share of shonen tropes. They're not bad per se, but it's not the masterpiece of deep writing as well.
>> ARTICLE
For me random comedy scenes killed FMA and also Brotherhood . OPM was solid and honestly fun story not the best but worth watching .

Also I think that about  half of shows on this list are overhyped but my it's just my opinion . Maybe it's becouse I like SoL , Drama and Fantasy stories more
>> ARTICLE
eh, the random comedy scenes brought FMA down to earth for me. It's just that FMA had less of those than FMA:B because of the shorter run...
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind

A show doesn't need to have a story if it's not necessary. In OPM having a continuous narrative wasn't necessary since it was a gag comedy.
>> ARTICLE
that would all good if it was actually funny.  Unfortunately it was all too happy making the same joke over and over.
>> ARTICLE
OPM didn't literally have only one single joke. Yes it had the overlying "one punch" gag but it was used in many different ways, sometimes as a joke and sometimes for a serious moment. Overall the show also had a variety of comedy moments that didn't center around Saitama's gag.
>> ARTICLE
ok, list some examples of other kind of gags.  Maybe I'm missing something, but almost all the gags are just people/villains looking down on the MC, who beats the villain effortlessly.  
>> ARTICLE
[OPM spoilers](/s "In the episode where Saitama and Genos were infiltrating the evil doctors lair, he set traps on every floor in preparation for their arrival. Instead of following the standard "clear the dungeon to the boss" trope Genos just instantly blows up the entire building and they enter the basement from there. This was funny because the viewer wouldn't expect this and it subverts the trope.")

[OPM spoilers](/s "After the "robotic monkey" is defeated he is acting like a hardened badass minion and gives the whole "you'll never defeat X" speech. Once he learns that they were actually defeated he drops the robotic voice and takes on a whole different persona asking to be spared. He says that the robotic voice and attitude was him just trying to sound cool. This is funny because it was unexpected at the time and surprises the viewer.")

I could keep going and pull out every single one liner from every single episode that either got a chuckle or an outloud laugh from me but I think you see the point. Every episode didn't have 20 minutes of nothing happening until one single joke about a single punch was pulled at the end. The episodes were lined with small to larger jokes derived from the characters speeches, interactions among each other, and actions in the world they were in which all worked together and created the overall comedic tone/atmosphere of the show.
>> ARTICLE
that's just another variation of the same "Saitama is too powerful" gag, the other being an example of "villains acting all arrogant until they are put in their place by Saitama, who is too powerful" gag
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling you don't really want to be proven wrong. 

Look at his first example, how does that fall under the "single gag" at all? Second example, doesn't fall under the "single gag" either.

These examples are pretty far from the "saitama too strong" gag, so unless you are unfamiliar with the references, its likely pretty clear to most that this isn't a single gag show
>> ARTICLE
And as a variation they're different, they're unique with the characters interacting in different ways which isn't boring or uninteresting for the viewer. 
>> ARTICLE
[Saitama's impatience when it comes to monologuing](http://40.media.tumblr.com/7d6f2f56643914b392c1d249aa7f8ea5/tumblr_nwpsrfFOUb1u77epio1_500.jpg), and his [lackadaisical attitude](http://i.imgur.com/zdAJyD1.jpg) are two examples of gags in the show that isn't just the one punch gag. Genos constantly getting turned to modern art, the weird backstories for each villain, the strange character designs for each villain (I mean fucking look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/JJzfkFL.png) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/5qG4z0B.jpg)), [or even just the absurdity of certain situations in the show.](http://gfycat.com/PoshHelpfulIberianbarbel)

On the whole, the comedic situations he's placed in make [Saitama a](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/3wwk6k/anime_irl/?) [very](http://i.imgur.com/8GtTdCl.jpg) [relatable character](https://i.imgur.com/ixk3nTm.jpg) with the added bonus of just being hilarious in general. This is why I can't quite understand why people say the show only has the One Punch gag, it's a comedy with a varied arsenal of jokes to tell, yet for some reason people just say "LEL ONE GAG MAN".
>> ARTICLE
> monologuing

That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.  

>lackadaisical attitude

If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too.  What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.


> modern art

don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

> LEL ONE GAG MAN

personally, I would go with One Punchline Man
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why I tried to give examples, you're actively trying to not have fun with the anime, and that's why the comedy doesn't work with you.

>That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.

Not with most other characters in any fictional media. Most would listen to the long backstory without saying a word, so no, I wouldn't quite say it's a "natural reaction".

>If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too. What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.

Again, the point is that this is abnormal for a main character of a show. Does Superman act like that? No. To give a currently airing show as an example, does All-Mighty act like that? No. These are the characters Saitama is parodying because they're so common, and his character type as MC is so uncommon. See, this is what I mean by the fact that you're actively fighting against this anime tooth and nail in order to not have fun with it. Everyone else sees Saitama as unique and funny, yet you're sitting over here trying to jump through mental hoops to see him as this normal character that is totally obvious to write as the MC of a superhero show.

>don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

"Oh my god, they killed Kenny!" ~ Line from a TV show that made millions laugh all around the world.

You don't even bother acknowledging anything else I mentioned, so what was the point in responding?
>> ARTICLE
tbh, the fact that it was nothing but a gag comedy for the first 5 episodes made me question where the hype is coming from. I mean yeah, it was hilarious, but it was the anime equivalent of Chocolate Mint flavor ice cream: you don't get it too often, it's pretty good, but ultimately nothing to be excited about.

The last 7 episodes though, made me think "oh, this was what manga readers were hyping it up for"

Still though, I have to think a fair bit of that was casual anime-only people just parroting the manga hype. 
>> ARTICLE
Seconded. I personally think that OPM stands out from the current arc being covered by the manga 'til the end of that arc in the webcomic. [OPM end of latest finished webcomic arc spoilers](/s "Sweet Mask obsessing over Saitama's power after thrashing Garou gave me chills. That, and whenever he shows up with his High Rank Harem.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think most people claim it as a masterpiece, it was just a really fun show with a good "hype" factor.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe not in anime communities, but people who don't watch much anime tend to overhype it a lot (look at its IMDB rating).

it's because it's the "not anime anime". People who saw DBZ and thought it was dumb come to this and say "OH MY GOD, IT'S SO AMAZING".

But what about the culture aspect of the show? Because i dont know jack about the stage comedy storytelling aspect of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Mmm honestly it doesn't really matter. All the stories are self contained, so if there is additional backstory to it, it's not really necessary.  The important parts of the show are generally not the actual performances, and that's where the gold is. The stories are good, but the characters make it great.

I find it a little sad that most of the WT posts are of anime frequently mentioned already. Most of the WT posts of anime series people haven't watched aren't being upvoted because no one else has seen them and therefore have no motivation to upvote them. And these are the ones I (and many others) actually want to see.

I'd complain more about the system but I don't have any suggestions to fix this :(
>> ARTICLE
I plan on doing some less well-known series when I watch them. Hopefully will have some Shiki, Mononoke, and Gankutsuo coming up in the near future, provided nobody gets to them first.
>> ARTICLE
Gankutsuo and Mononoke have already been done, and I'm pretty sure Shiki is decently popular. 
>> ARTICLE
Well then maybe I'll be able to provide a different perspective.
>> ARTICLE
Having a weekly compilation is already a solution to show more love to those WT! who didn't reach the frontpage.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but kaverik filters out the posts that have less than 10 upvotes, which leaves out the unpopular ones.
>> ARTICLE
Oh that sucks.
>> ARTICLE
Instead he should archive them in a subreddit or have a bot that scans for [WT!] and have them all pushed to that sub so an archive can be made.

In the case for duplicates you can use a wiki(which no one really checks unless you spam it enough in the CSS). Pretty simple to make and manage and kaverick's post can be automated if needed. 

*Also* Thanks for mentioning Nazo no Kanojou X. First episode got me hooked hard
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I agree. Out of the top 15 I'd say only two there aren't extremely well known and *already* appreciated in the anime community. Even those two (Honey & Clover and Paprika) are a stretch.

It's kind of silly. I half expect to see a [WT!] for Sword Art Online, Eva, or Attack on Titan next week.

edit: Or a [WT!] for Gintama... oh, nevermind. ~ u ~
>> ARTICLE
I had the same thoughts. At first, I was unsure whether or not to post my Girls Und Panzer WT. It is popular in a sense, but my eventual reasoning was that many were missing out on it due to the premise, particularly on this subreddit, and my personal experience is that regardless of initial impressions, most of the people whom I recommended it to before came to like it a lot.

I feel that a show doesn't necessarily have to be unpopular, as long as it's underrated/people are missing out on it, a WT thread is within reasonable bounds.
>> ARTICLE
While I sort of agree with both of you on the fact that the WT! threads have an issue with usually being only mentioned shows, the reason I posted Gunbuster personally was because of how similar it is to NGE, but there's an absolutely massive popularity gap (NGE at #25 on MAL and Gunbuster at #1005). I really didn't think it's that popular here, the only times it really comes up is a few users mentioning it here and there (seriously, I could probably list their usernames at this point), which is why I posted it. I'd say it's well known enough, but compared to like 90% of anime on this sub? Wouldn't say so.


Actually, I just checked and Gunbuster is one of only 3 anime series/movies (so, not shorts which most people wouldn't really think would be on MAL anyway, which might lead to them being unpopular) with [WT!]'s that have a popularity lower than 1000. Also, mecha is one of, if not the least popular genre on this subreddit, so all in all I feel justified enough posting Gunbuster because I think it's an absolutely amazing show from a genre that gets shit on more than it deserves to on this sub. I definitely though it needed a WT! personally, seeing as Eva is super super popular on this sub and it's kind of like Eva's origin point.

And really, all in all it's actively promoting discussion about anime so even if people make threads about popular shows, I don't think it's that bad. Sure, they shoudln't really get them but it's at least a nice change from the 1000th thread about 'Favourite  _____'.

Obviously we are talking about /r/anime here and not MAL, but I'd say the popularity rates are a good judgement of how popular an anime is on here too.
>> ARTICLE
Being a nub. I'm grateful that Paprika was on the list. 
>> ARTICLE
Lol you made me feel bad and deleted it :P

Sorry I guess my rationality was overcome by my unending love for the series for a second there. I was complaining about how popular series don't need WT! threads just a week or so ago :(
>> ARTICLE
Aww, I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel bad!

[](#k-on-hug)

I do very much agree that popular series don't particularly need a [WT] though > . <
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but I think that's the curse of the WT! tag right now. The WT! threads of popular series will be the most visible (that's what people will upvote), and the obscure anime won't receive any visibility as nobody will feel the need to support a series they haven't seen. Not sure what kind of solution could be set in place here, but yeah :(
>> ARTICLE
Atm I'm just upvoting the well written posts on obscure shows as much as I can. Thinking of doing the opposite for obvious karma cash ins from those who didn't realize that self posts don't grant link katma, but that could be too much.
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, personally, I think that removing those with less than 10 upvotes may have been a bad choice. I'm not sure, because I haven't seen all the threads as they came out, but aren't those usually the ones that are lesser known? (Because people tend to upvote those that they have seen as opposed to quality of writing/recommendation?)

As always, I pay more attention to the ones near the bottom of the list, because those are the ones I actually find to be intersting, not to say that the ones at the top are not well written, it just feels like they're recommending stuff that people have already heard about.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, probably I'll do this next time - a complete list, and fix two existing ones.
>> ARTICLE
I like the idea for the tag, but I wish there was a way to get people to post and upvote less frequently mentioned anime.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree with the fears that the WT posts are getting out of hand. At the very least, these threads are actively discussing anime. If we had less of them, we'd just have more meme and funny image threads. I'd much rather have an excess of WT posts than an excess of meme posts.

Perfect is the enemy of good. I find that the WT threads have made this subreddit more interesting and useful than before they were introduced.

I get what you're saying and I agree with you, but aren't those kind of posts outright banned here anyway? So I don't think that'd be a problem.

Perhaps. I was using that to mean "low-content" posts. At least the WT posts are "high-content" to me. I'd rather have too many "high-content" posts, rather than too many "low-content".

**My favorite submissions of this week** (in no order): [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster](http://redd.it/2vx766), [Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita](http://redd.it/2wkwkf), [Jin-Rou](http://redd.it/2w936t)

**Anime that I personally recommend to watch from this week**: [NHK ni Youkoso!](http://redd.it/2w0cmi), [Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei](http://redd.it/2vwycu), [Hachimitsu to Clover](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16/Hachimitsu_to_Clover)

Also I want to add that some of my (and others) fears of [WT!] threads are becoming more and more real. I can tolerate Durarara!! recommendation to some extent (though I don't think that the anime that has #18 rating on MAL popularity list *needs* a  recommendation), but post about Shirobako just made me sad. Do we really need a [WT!] thread for the ongoing anime that already has decent amount of discussion on /r/anime? Not to say this anime is not finished yet... I'm not sure I'm happy about this trend.

On unrelated note, I had little time to participate in /r/anime 's life this week (hence I didn't post any threads), but I think I will make a couple of threads next week. I have some anime in mind, so expect some shitty posts.

That said, thanks for stopping here, in this thread, and don't forget to leave the feedback!

I really want to see a WT thread about the Aria series.

Requets for [WT!] is something that we haven't encountered yet. Could be interesting.

It seems kind of pointless though. If you really want a [WT!] that badly, can't you just make one yourself? I mean, I've seen some that could easily have been written in about ten minutes. It shouldn't be too hard.

This thread is a good place for such requests.

Not quite a [WT!] but /u/BanjoTheBear did a review on the [first Aria](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2vlwhg/spoilers_reviewdiscussion_about_aria_the_animation/) and I believe he plans to do the rest as well.

I don't know if these WTs are representative of how new some of our readers are in the overall animu community, or if everyone really only cares about potentially acclaimed anime.

It was! Thank you. I forgot to leave a comment there. Sometimes in life you just want to watch cute girls fight each other in tanks. There's something innocent, yet honest about it.

Really happy so far.

I would love to see somebody do a [WT!] about [Higurashi no Naku Koro ni](http://myanimelist.net/anime/934/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni). Not that its not a well received and popular series, but I just think it is a show that has a difficult concept to explain when recommending to people.

Tatami Galaxy is a great anime for any audience, but it's especially good viewing for people at or around college-age, not only because of the setting but also its themes. I know that TG sorta gives off that inaccessible "elitist" vibe that sometimes turns people off, but it's actually one of the easiest shows out there to digest and relate to once you get used to the narration, and the storytelling is very clever and intelligent.

For comparison's sake, it's basically a more optimistic and better-written version of Welcome to the NHK.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Uhhh they absolutely can be compared and I say this as a big fan of both. They might be different in execution but one of the central questions behind both is how to live life and deal with failure. Tatami Galaxy is the idealist's take on this, espousing opportunism and the courage to step out of your comfort zone; NHK, otoh, portrays how social isolation and depression (among other factors) can lead to people shying away from opportunity, and emphasizes the idea that failure is far more common than success.

It's ridiculous to just say "they can't even be compared", they are very similar thematically even if the way they choose to express those themes is what makes them different. And there's no need to get offended over someone saying that TG is better-written than NHK, because it is. **NHK is my absolute favorite anime** (bolding this so no one tries to accuse me of being partial to TG) but there's no way you can argue that it's better written; it makes far too many mistakes in comparison, even if it is more powerful because of its realism.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
...okay

first of all no idea why you emphasized "theme" because that literally is a theme, but whatever

second of all, Naruto's central theme is not "how to live life and deal with failure/take advantage of opportunity" (if Naruto even has a central theme it's friendship and teamwork and all that standard nakama stuff), and even if you want to argue that it is bc of how Naruto himself is characterized, the way Naruto deals with this theme and the way TG and NHK deal with it are worlds apart. trying to stretch the theme until it becomes too vague to describe is a terrible argument btw, literally *every* theme ever can be stretched like this until you can apply it to almost any anime. most stories force their characters to deal with failure/opportunity, but few focus on the concept itself and base the entire show on it.  

which leads me to my last point - TG and NHK deal with the theme in a similar setting with similar characters (Watashi and Satou are both lonely college age guys who try to get involved with other people and activities, although Satou is more resistant at first), targeted toward the same target audience, with the real difference being the conclusion they arrive at (TG = "seize the day", NHK = "life's hard"). these are huge factors that I didn't mention because I didn't want to write a goddamn essay because 99% of people who've watched both of these shows understand why they're similar. 

on that note, you never did explain how the shows "can't even be compared. They are so different! How can you even." if you are trying to tell me that two shows with similar themes/MCs/settings being targeted towards the *exact same audience* aren't comparable, then I really don't know what to tell you.

>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I know you were being sarcastic, but you were saying that "similar themes =/= similar anime", which is really reductive. Every theme can be stretched to vagueness, so we have to limit the scope of the theme to a useful degree. In this case it's useful to talk about TG and NHK because they not only cover, but focus on similar content, whereas it's not useful to talk about Naruto and TG being thematically similar because the way they explore and focus on said themes is too different to compare. 

You didn't admit or explain anything lol, saying that they're comparable "in an absurdly broader sense" just implies that you don't think they're comparable in a useful sense, which I'm saying they are. You still haven't given any decent reasons as to why they're not. Every difference you've pointed out is largely superficial:

>So because it's set in modern day Japan, it's similar?

Yep. More importantly, they're set in environs that college age/early 20-somethings can relate to. That's more than similar enough to warrant a comparison. What, do they have to be set in the same house? And keep in mind that this is still only a minor factor, it just supports other, bigger similarities (so don't start throwing around random anime that are set in modern day Japan as if that refutes what I'm saying). 

>Same target audience

This is huge. It's not just about age here, both anime are specifically supposed to resonate with people who are in or fresh out of college and have gone through any period of depression and/or loneliness, and are becoming cognizant of all the opportunities they've missed in life (which is pretty much every 20-something ever). There are other anime that target college-age audiences, but not too many that target them because of these specific traits. 

>The only thing similar about these two shows is that the protagonists are lonely, college age guys but that's not much, is it?

*Yes it is*. The target demographic is college-age people who are supposed to relate to Watashi and Satou. Protags like them are not common in anime (if they are, then name 3 others from somewhat well-known anime). If they were common then you'd have more of a point, because yeah, the way NHK and TG tell their stories is different. But they're not common.

Which is sorta what I'm getting at here. NHK and TG are comparable because there aren't many other anime like them that target the same audience for the same reasons, exploring the same themes. They're different in approach but the content is uncommon enough that they deserve comparison for that alone.

But really, the content doesn't have to be that uncommon. Anime with different narrative styles and structures are compared to each other all the time for their similar themes and genre. Would you say Naruto and One Piece are too different to compare except "in an absurdly broader sense"? Death Note and Code Geass? FMA and HxH? Sakurasou and Toradora? Bebop and Trigun?

Every decent story is unique to some degree, that doesn't mean they can't be compared to other somewhat unique stories. 
>> ARTICLE
Thematically they might as well be the same show, tatami galaxy just generally does it better.

>> ARTICLE
I think it's not that hard to recommend it to highschool or even middleschool crowd personally. As long as one doesn't invoke the 'anime for adults' card, which just reeks of pretentiousness. But it's a nice show to show off how lonely college life can be and that the things we take for granted in early schooling, such as being able to meet girls almost every day is something to be treasured.
>> ARTICLE
Right, I said it's a great anime for any audience. It's just that college-age people in particular will be able to relate to it.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree that it's really better written than NHK, but they tell very different stories anyways. 

Either way they're both fantastic in my opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
They tell different stories but they are thematically quite similar - both anime explore how to live life and deal with failure. I wrote a reply in another comment but basically, TG is the optimistic take on this (as it chooses to emphasize opportunism and the idea that success is both relative and always just around the corner) while NHK is the more realistic, even pessimistic take (as it drives home the notion that failure is far more common than success and how factors like social withdrawal and mental ilness can contribute to it). Tatami Galaxy and NHK are very similar shows, even if the execution is different. There is a reason people who like one will almost always like the other. 

And while NHK is my favorite anime, TG is absolutely written better. NHK has issues with pacing, with plot arcs ending abruptly, several plot conveniences, rushed character development (with Misaki), and an overall lack of focus and direction. TG suffers from none of these, the narrative is much tighter and the pacing is almost perfect (you could argue the first 4-5 episodes are a little too repetitive I guess). It's also a little more focused thematically, as it sticks to one message the entire way through while NHK goes from one message to another without really knowing which one it wants to settle on. The only real advantage NHK has over TG is that it's much more powerful because of how realistic it is (which is a huge advantage, but it doesn't mean it's better written).

And yea, they are both great anime.
>> ARTICLE
>  I know that TG sorta gives off that inaccessible "elitist" vibe that sometimes turns people off, but it's actually one of the easiest shows out there to digest and relate to once you get used to the narration, and the storytelling is very clever and intelligent.

This is something that I neglected to mention in my post. I agree that the cult following might give it a sort of hipster/elitist vibe, and I also agree that it's really grounded in what it presents and the themes that it tackles.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I'm with everything you said in your OP btw, just adding to it. I was wondering when someone would WT this.
>> ARTICLE
I finished the entire show, and only after did I realize that the Protagonist didn't have a name...
>> ARTICLE
>The Tatami Galaxy follows a nameless protagonist through his college experience as he searches for an ideal college life. Each episode has him joining a different campus club or organization, details two years of his college experience with said club/organization, before resetting time at the end of the episode to do it all over again in the next one. This plot device can be difficult to manage in a lot of cases, but The Tatami Galaxy handles it masterfully.

Consider me sold.
>> ARTICLE
I recently finished watching this (yesterday) and to me it was this Haruhi Endless Eight vibe to it and the protagonist is similar to Kyon. I haven't watched Welcome to the NHK yet so I can't make any comparisons to that but definitely to Haruhi in that respect.
>> ARTICLE
Except for the fact that Tatami Galaxy is Endless Eight done right. Tatami Galaxy doesn't make you want to skip any episode just because it gives a similar feeling. 
>> ARTICLE
Exactly right. [Haruhi and Tatami Galaxy spoilers](/s "I mean Endless Eight in Haruhi was literally the same thing with only costume changes. The vibe was there but each episode in Tatami Galaxy was a new perspective, a breath of fresh air. We got to see the new characters and all.") 
>> ARTICLE
Such a great show. Weird at the beginning while getting used to the vibes, but satisfying ending.
>> ARTICLE
This has been on my plan to watch list for awhile. I just finished the first episode, and holy hell the narration moves quickly! I like the quirky art-style and the premise seems really cool. Thanks for making the thread to remind me to start this one!
>> ARTICLE
It's a fantastic show but make sure you are fairly good at reading subtitles quickly. I have avoided recommending it to a few people since they are casual anime viewers and complain about the speed of subtitles for other shows with slower dialogue.
>> ARTICLE
I was considering doing a writeup on just the first episode recently, because it's just that damn good (which is, incidentally, the only episode I've seen so far). I need to watch more of it soon.
>> ARTICLE
The enjoyment of the show slowly drops in the coming episodes before skyrocketing in the last two. I loved the first episode, but be prepared for a little repetitiveness/predictability to come.
>> ARTICLE
I'm aware of the loop mechanic, and I've heard it's well done (hence the popularity of the show), which doesn't bother me. I enjoy loops every now and then because I can look for little differences. I don't see it being an issue.
>> ARTICLE
It's not really an Endless Eight kind of loop, if that's what you're thinking.  There are a lot of shared threads between episodes, but aside from maybe one arc each episode is largely distinct from the rest.
>> ARTICLE
Also aware of that. Doesn't it focus on him joining a new club each time and the outcomes of those decisions?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but the results of joining each club vary.  Sometimes slightly, sometimes greatly.  Hard to say much more while avoiding specifics.  In any case, you'll find more differences than similarities.
>> ARTICLE
If you like it that much having only watched the first episode you will absolutely love it.

Most people consider the first episode to be relatively weak, at least the first time you watch it.
>> ARTICLE
My rating of this show before the last 2 episodes 6/10 

After the last 2 episodes  9/10  . God damn the last 2 episodes was fantastic and connected everything perfect
>> ARTICLE
It's weird, on my first viewing of the show, I kinda felt that the last episode was disappointing. I loved episode 10 but the way they wrapped everything up with an happy ending for everyone (even Ozu) was kind of underwhelming at first. I wished they had gone through a bigger message than "everything works out in the end" especially after that amazing episode 10. After two rewatchs, I now get that the show as a whole is a lot more positive about life than I first realized but the ending kinda still bugs me. I know I shouldn't expect something life-changing and awe-inspiring out of an 11 episodes show but to me, it felt like it was building up to something else.

Nevertheless, it is my favorite anime of all time, 10/10 and all that. I'd rewatch it any time (I probably should right now).
>> ARTICLE
This show only got better for me.  The first episode I was sort of confused and didn't really get where it was going.  The second I started to realize what might be going on.  The last two firmly set TG as one of my favorite of all time and made it a 10/10 for me.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely one of my favorite shows (I did give it a 10/10). OP, you should include the [Funimation](http://www.funimation.com/shows/the-tatami-galaxy) and [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/the-tatami-galaxy) links for convenience.

saw this 4 years ago, bent my mind in all the right places. very stoked to watch it again.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck everything about that butterfly eyecatch.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching this last week, lol.
>> ARTICLE
The artwork is excellent. I love how they mix real-life photography and footage with the animation. The scene in the first episode where Akashi and the protagonist are sitting on the bridge looked amazing. If anything it reminds me of the art in Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, but I found the style in that a bit boring.

I didn't know the premise going into the series, or I'd have been much more inclined to watch it. It's impressive that the episodes don't get that repetitive, and that most of the repetition is sort of comedic in nature. I'd have to rewatch the series to catch them all, but it seems like a lot of episodes contain references to *later* episodes. But I'd have to spoil some of the later episodes to go into detail.

I'm surprised how well some of the comedy translates in such a weird, fast-paced show. Not a lot of anime makes me laugh out loud. I loved the tit-wall that makes multiple appearances, but obviously nothing can get lost in translation about that.

I think the film-club episode was my favorite. The prank war episode was an odd one- I didn't really get what "proxy war" (or "proxy proxy proxy etc. war) meant until near the end of the episode.

Both the opening and ending themes are excellent. 
>> ARTICLE
This is one of the most interesting shows I have seen. The premise is a fairly standard one, but presented in a creative way. The art, colours, and animation are well done. 
I found that once I was able to get used to the speed of the narration and subsequent rapidfire subtitles I found that this is quite an entertaining show. 
Though this show is comedic in nature, I really enjoy the serious side to it as well. The main character trying to make the right choice to live his dream "rose coloured campus life" and to "get the girl". 
I'd agree that the film club episode is my favourite as well. (From the first 5 episodes anyway.) 
I was surprised when each episode looped back in time, the loop was put to good use and never became overly repetitive. There are several scenes which carry over from episode to episode which become quite important to the overall plot. 
Indeed a good watch. 
>> ARTICLE
I started off a little critical of the pitch ("a man reminisces about his college life") and, as such, was pleasantly surprised by the end of episode 3. The intricate work that must have gone into each episode is staggering, such as the tiny references between the parallel universes. 

[It was only recently that I learned that the fortune-teller apparently lives in the clock  rewinding at the end of each episode. (http://thenullset.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/top-picks-%E2%80%93-spring-2010-anime-part-1-cast-and-character-awards/ -- spoiler formatting does not allow link within.)](/spoiler)

What annoyed me at first was the fast-paced dialogue, but the quality of it made up royally for that. Finally, whereas it is not uncommon for anime to have a rather unsatisfactory ending, I found that I was totally OK with the way the series was wrapped up, even though (or maybe because) I could never have predicted this specific ending.

All in all, the most underestimated show of the spring season.

**Edit**: You're right, done.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't want to do anything yesterday and serendipity stepped in with this. I watched the whole series in one sitting and was thoroughly impressed. I had posted a while back about how much I loved Kemonozume and had started to watch Kaiba as a follow up but I think the minimalist animation style is not nearly as captivating as this one. 

OK without going into the last half, the first 5 episodes were lots of fun. I didn't know what to expect other than that it would probably end up being more than it seemed at first. I had no idea that the theme involved replaying his life with different decisions. The best part about this storytelling technique is that it allows for allusions to other parts of the story that you have already seen. The character development is very unidimensional in each episode but combines to paint dynamic pictures of all of the characters while changing the viewer's perspective on events. 
More specifically, I liked the proxy proxy war the best because it was absurd but also provided some wisdom which is what I look for in a good anime.
I guess I don't have much to say about these specific episodes so I will save my comments for next week.

Loving it. Great recommendation.

Am I the only one who thinks the subtitles go by impossibly fast? 

I think I could enjoy this, but I really can't read this quickly. 

Is there a decent dubbed version or something out there?
>> ARTICLE
This show just came out in the spring season so there is no dub (yet). Hopefully there will be. The subtitles are super fast, but it was something I was able to adjust to. 
>> ARTICLE
I was actually thinking that this is definitely a candidate for a dub since the visuals are so beautiful and the story can be complex at time, I feel like I must have missed quite a bit by trying to keep up with the story.

#### Other Lists

I used my data set to create some other lists. I figured some of them may be interesting, though most of them turned out not to be.

###### [Weighted Favorites](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=969058587)

[One person who used favorites in the past](http://animetics.net/2015/01/15/fun-with-numbers-myanimelists-sequel-problem-should-and-can-be-fixed/) used a weighted favorites score rather than the favorites percentage that I use. This system treats each favorite as an additional score worth 11. This system takes advantage of the *MyAnimeList* score, but I don't like it because it does not get rid of the extraneous sequels on the top list.

###### [Most Scores of 10](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=225861329)

Anime with the largest % of scores worth 10. This list ends up closely mirroring the [regular *MyAnimeList* top anime list](http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) (the highest ranked series would naturally receive more 10s).

###### [Most Scores of 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=234535405)

Anime with the largest % of scores worth 1. At a brief glance, it seems like there are a bunch of anime that are known for being bad (anime that people love to hate), e.g., [Mars of Destruction](http://myanimelist.net/anime/413/Mars_of_Destruction/stats).

###### [Avg. of Scores from 2 to 10](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CV9_bm7LrrjlDNb12ftBZBolAhtfunZP8j9g1sxbDFM/edit#gid=725274167)

The mean of scores from 2 to 10, excluding 1 votes. I include all votes from an anime's "Stats", including [scores that normally wouldn't count](http://myanimelist.net/info.php?go=topanime). I figured that a lot of 1 scores are overreactions (and are there people downvoting sequels just to clean up *MAL*'s top list?) and wanted to see what would happen if I exclude them.

Ends up being cluttered due to upcoming releases that people are looking forward to / recent releases which haven't yet been subbed. There's no good way of automatically filtering out these released-but-unsubbed ones without doing it manually.

Perhaps a list of only TV series would be more interesting. The top planned to watch TV series are *[Myriad Colors Phantom World](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31442/Musaigen_no_Phantom_World)* (remember the data is from Jan. 6, before this winter season got rolling) -- *Kyoto Animation* projects are generally highly anticipated -- and *[Aria the Origination](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3297/Aria_The_Origination)* -- it probably has a lot of planned viewers because of how highly-rated it is, but most people don't actually get to it because there are two prequel seasons which are fairly difficult to get through.

> it probably has a lot of planned viewers because of how highly-rated it is, but most people don't actually get to it because there are two prequel seasons which are fairly difficult to get through.

I didn't really think Aria the Origination was much different in quality from the first two seasons. I think Aria just tends to drop *a lot* of people along the way.
>> ARTICLE
People who drop the *Aria* series are likely drop it after *Animation*. If you can get past that, then you're much more likely to eventually get through *Natural* and *Origination*.

That's why *Natural* benefits so much from the sequel effect. It has a high score yet a low number of favorites.

However, *Origination* has both a high score and a high number of favorites, so people legitimately think that it's great compared to the rest of the series (myself included). Assuming your *MAL* is up-to-date, you haven't finished *Origination* yet -- you might just revise your opinion once you finish the series.
>> ARTICLE
K, you caught me, I got to Origination, saw no difference in quality, and put it in hold. I don't really see how it can change, it's episodic and every next episode is more or less like the last.

When it comes to sequels, I think people tend to conserve their favorites by reserving it for the last session of the series, to cap off the series.
>> ARTICLE
Aria is all about the characters slowly changing. The Origination is about them really striving to become Primas and you can see the change once you look back from the end of the series to the beginning. There's a scene with Alice in Origination that's similar to one from the first season but she behaves very differently.

There's definite change in the The Origination and a rough plot, especially in the second half of the season. It's not the same as the other two.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on episode 10 and I'm still not really seeing any major changes in quality. You're right that there is character development that gradually occurs, but the core nature of the series is not changed.
>> ARTICLE
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. For me, episode 9 (10 on Hulu since it counts episode 5.5 as 6) is a truly spectacular episode and so are episodes 11 through 13 (12 to 14). The plot becomes evident around that episode, but started much earlier.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 8 and 9 are spectacular, especially since I'm a Alice fan.
>> ARTICLE
I think Episode 9 is one of the great episodes of anime. Episodes 11 through 13 really tie everything together and wrap up the series beautifully.

I can't wait to watch the rest of it. But I'm taking it slowly, an episode a day or less. I've been watching this for months.

> K, you caught me, I got to Origination, saw no difference in quality, and put it in hold. I don't really see how it can change, it's episodic and every next episode is more or less like the last.

That's like saying "I got to *After Story*, saw no difference in quality [since the first few episodes of *After Story* are similar to the original *Clannad*], and put it in hold. I don't really see how it can change."

> When it comes to sequels, I think people tend to conserve their favorites by reserving it for the last session of the series, to cap off the series.

This is demonstrably false either way you look at it:

- For series where the TV sequels don't finish the series (e.g., *Gintama*, *Mushishi*, *Natsume Yuujinchou*), only the first season receives a high number of favorites, and the following/final series receive almost nothing.

- For series where the TV sequels end the story (e.g., *Kuroko 3rd Season*, *Fate/Zero 2nd Season*, *Unlimited Blade Works 2nd Season*, *Code Geass R2*, *Bakuman 3*, *Higurashi Kai*, and many more): the first season always has the highest number of favorites.

People do not "conserve" favorites for the final season. If they like a series, they'll tend to favorite the first season.

The only exceptions are stuff like *Clannad: After Story* and *Aria the Origination*, indicating that they're better than the rest of the series.

After Story is not an episodic slice of life with no real changes in quality between episode or overall story.

From the first 30.

5 are "girl shit". Anime made just for girls, most MAL users are male.

7 are "kiddy shit". Nobody really wants to watch an anime meant for elementary schoolers any more than they want to watch Nick Jr. (3 of them are forever long as well)

14 are "shit". Mixed bag between shitty CG, no existent story, wut budget, and boobs-just-for-they-hey.

2 are "no homo". Manly man shows about men doing man stuff. Probably a good show for your Harley-Davidson riding uncle.

The last two are Heroman--an American made story for Japan. Stan Lee you can't make anime. Just stahp. And Saint Seiya Omega which I call "dem rose colored glasses finally fell off lol".

It helps that the show is not just something someone picks up unless they know what they are getting into. It's not like picking up a 12 or 24 episode show. I'm sure many people have had moments where they pick up a 12 or 24 episode show based on something small like seeing a gif from it or hearing about it from a friend but I think it's safe to say that's not enough to convince them to dedicate themselves to ~100 episodes.

This is why the top 4 are all really long shows. People who watch(ed) it either knew what they were going into or have followed it for several years so it only makes sense that there is a good ratio of favorites. Ranking by favorites is ruined by the flaw of having long running shows as they will almost always have a strong fanbase.

>> ARTICLE
Personally I only have 4 anime listed under my favorites because I only want to include the best of the best, but other people use all 10 of their slots and as such their tastes would be more strongly represented than people like me. Unless of course you assume that people who use all their favorite slots have statistically identical taste to those who don't it, which seems unlikely. I doubt this could easily be rectified, perhaps assigning less weight to favorites from people as they have more favorites would fix the problem but that would also make the task of composing such a list much more difficult.
>> ARTICLE
I think the best way would be to adjust the weight given to favorites by the percent of shows a person has listed as their favorites (and allow people to mark unlimited favorites). This could also somewhat address the drastic rise of some of the hugely popular shounens (or if they don't actually drop, it would address the criticisms that would be placed against their place on the list).

That's an interesting way to use it. I always thought everyone used the favorites spot as a personal top 10 list.

>Movies suffer. Great movies like Spirited Away, Wolf Children, and Princess Mononoke drop 329, 251, and 308 places, respectively. People seem reluctant to put movies in their Favorites list, probably preferring to use the limited number of favorites for TV series instead.

Personally I think this is because movies tend to be more universally liked, so if I cram my favorites with 5 Ghibli movies that doesn't really say much about my personal tastes compared to having 5 different series. So in my mind I just ignore movies in that sense. Maybe MAL should have a separate favorites list for them.

You have quite a lot of 10s, so I'll just throw this out there to you as an experiment:  if you were to rank all of your 10s by however you're currently ranking your favorites without regard to limits or displaying taste, how many of your top 5 would be movies?  

I'm asking because I'm wondering if the length of a series versus the length of a movie (particularly because a series will mostly not be watched entirely in one chunk) leads people to feel more strongly about them after it's over.  Say, if you loved Spirited Away, well, that was two hours that you were sitting there, it's done, and you rate it.  But if you loved Nagi no Asukara, you were watching it, going to bed, thinking about it a bit til you could keep watching it, growing more attached to it while you were still in the middle of watching it, then you finish it a few days later and rate it.  So when you think about what to put on your favorites, you were wrapped up in NnA for much longer.  

Just spitballing, I dunno.  
>> ARTICLE
>You have quite a lot of 10s

I mean, not really. I have less 10s than 9s, 8s, or 7s and about the same as 6s. 

>if you were to rank all of your 10s by however you're currently ranking your favorites without regard to limits or displaying taste, how many of your top 5 would be movies?I'm asking because I'm wondering if the length of a series versus the length of a movie (particularly because a series will mostly not be watched entirely in one chunk) leads people to feel more strongly about them after it's over. 

Hmm well you make a good point there. While I feel really strongly about my top 2, Clannad and Nagi Asu, probably due to the attachment over time (also because I think they are just incredible works of animation) I would at least put my favorite movies in the next two spots, like Nausicaa and Wolf Children. 

I think these share at least a little bit of the attachment factor because I've seen Wolf Children 3 or 4 times now and Nausicaa has an incredible and much much longer manga which I've read twice so I think I'm more fond of it by association. 

>then you finish it a few days later and rate it.

Implying I didn't finish Nagi in under 2 days flat... :P

Thanks for your thoughts.  

> I mean, not really. I have less 10s than 9s, 8s, or 7s and about the same as 6s.  

All about perspective here, I guess, what with my 1 10 out of 233.  Basically what I was getting at is that you had more 10s than favorite slots.
>> ARTICLE
Well it seems to me like you are trying you keep your scores on a Gaussian/Normal curve.... however logically this is not a correct thing to do because you don't sample anime randomly. Instead, you watch series that look good to you or are well-rated. If you watched every single anime that came out every season, naturally it should follow a normal bell curve because most will be average, but no one does that. 

However if your rate purely for your own reference, rating them in relation to each other, not caring about their scores in relation to every other anime released, then of course it makes more sense to do this. 

Personally I care about how an anime compares to every other anime that I have or haven't seen so I rate accordingly. In this way it makes perfect sense to have many highly scored series, since I chose and watched them with those expectations. 

Although even with a Gaussian distribution, you should still have more than one 10 out of 233 so I think you are just being overly critical. 
>> ARTICLE
To be clear, I didn't intend my comment as a criticism at all - people use whatever scale is a best fit for their goals.  

Rating discussion gets really navel-gazey really easily, so sorry in advance.  That said, here's why I think my scale developed as it did:

* Months or years after watching, it's much easier to properly rescore shows to compress the scale if needed (in order to say, push everything up to accommodate stumbling across a new low that's much worse than any other 1) than to expand it if it turns out to have been too compressed (e.g., turning 10s into 9s and 10s).  
* Using the entire scale at any given time makes my preferences as clear as possible for purposes of e.g., recommendations.   

I am not aiming for any given kind of curve at all - it just happened that way.  If you look at my last edited dates, I virtually never rescore after the fact (I can think of three examples offhand, two of which were pushing 10s to 9s, excepting my original very early expansion to the whole scale about 3 months after I started when I had about 30 total entries) and if you look closely enough at the distribution it's pretty lumpy at points (say, 1 vs 2).  My only thought process at this point (and it's been this way since I filled in the last of the 10 numbers with my 41st entry) is "which set of anime (at a given score) does this anime fit best next to, as far as my enjoyment is concerned?"  I'd say that 4 is my standard for "liked and disliked this equally".

I'd love to be lucky enough to watch only 5+s forever.  But I can't predict things that will *definitely* hit that with any reasonable accuracy (outside of a one specific type of anime, which is limited enough, has enough episodes in any given entry, and has few enough subtitled entries that I don't want to overload myself with it all at once, particularly because I won't appreciate it quite as much that way).  I never watch something that I don't anticipate enjoying (though I'll leave contracts open to that possibility in the future).

Also, I tend to watch more movies and short OVAs than most people, as far as I can tell, and I'm willing to take more chances on things that short - I never expected to like my 10 *that* much before watching it.  My average score on those is significantly lower than my average series score.  

As far as my 10 specifically goes, the end of the scale gets really tricky, particularly without a series currently there, but it's so rarefied that I just don't think anything else measures up enough to Angel's Egg that it'd belong there rather than with my 9s (which I still love a lot, obviously).  I deeply loved every bit of about 83% of my strongest 9, whereas for Angel's Egg it was more like 96% of it.  So I'm content leaving it alone for now.  

Finally, I'm really not sure I agree with the idea that the population of anime will converge to a normal or Gaussian curve.  If there's a reason you think it really does, we can discuss this more in-depth, but "90% of everything is crap" is a common saying for a reason, and as far as anime specifically is concerned, people love to complain about "generic LN adaptations" or whatever dominating a given season.  So if I'm pulling from a population with a ton of would-be-very-low-rated entries based on my preferences, then the shape of my curve makes a lot of sense.  
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly why I decided to use the % of favorites as my metric. Scoring systems vary too wildly between different users, but at least the favorites vary a bit less.
>> ARTICLE
>because you don't sample anime randomly

Even if you *did* sample anime randomly, the Central Limit Theorem doesn't apply, so there's no strong reason to expect a normal distribution.
>> ARTICLE
Why does it not apply? 
>> ARTICLE
For it to apply, there have to be a large number of independent variables with E[X]=0 (in that they factor into the rating positively or negatively, and are expected to factor into the score in a neutral way) that are summed to form an anime "score."  This doesn't really apply (at least, I would not expect for most people).  For me, I don't take off for "flaws" at all (what matters is that *something* works, and hopefully really well, rather than that everything works).  Other people can't talk about anything except "flaws."
>> ARTICLE
For this purpose, I'm assuming that it doesnt matter exactly *how* people rate shows, rather that *people* are doing the rating and that the variables of people's specific tastes and the varying quality of anime in general are going to combine together to create a normal curve. 

Lets look at engalleon's distribution- http://graph.anime.plus/engalleons/ratings,anime 

Whether he intended it or not, its almost a perfect Gaussian distribution. Even if we look at [the global stats](http://graph.anime.plus/s/globals) it follows a normal curve shifted up about a sigma or so, which is expected. 
>> ARTICLE
>Even if we look at the global stats 

Ahh, but the CLT *does* apply to global stats, because individual user rating events *are* independent and have a consistent E[X].

>Whether he intended it or not, its almost a perfect Gaussian distribution.

Suppose "quality" is exponentially distributed (motivated, say, by that awful too-often-quoted law).  Suppose further that a user only watches a show if its expected quality is above a certain threshold (say, E[X] >= 5) but sometimes they're wrong (but not that often).  From a distance, their score distribution will "look" normal, but it's not actually.  Engalleon's distribution has a much fatter upper tail than lower tail, which is something you'd expect under my model, but not under a normal distribution.
>> ARTICLE
>More importantly, there are a handful of sequels which stand head and shoulders above the rest of their respective series. Clannad: After Story is a prime example -- even people who dislike Clannad generally love After Story, so it makes sense to treat the sequel as its own, separate piece of work.

That was my problem with the combined list. If the entire Clannad series were combined, I would still "favorite" it. The ending was that good. I don't think it's fair to try and take the average of my S1 and S2 scores and use it to judge my score for the entire series - if I were looking at the entire franchise as a whole, I would take a more holistic view of things. Yeah the first season isn't up to par with the second, but it's necessary to understand Tomoya's character.
>> ARTICLE
Kind of off topic, but I actually pretty heavily disagree with the comments on Clannad. Pretty much all the character development necessary for the emotional moments in After Story to work is *in* After story (and not just after story but the portions after Tomoya exits highschool which starts around episode 9 iirc). The rest of the background is somewhat necessary to set up the story, but I don't think anything significant would be lost by condensing it immensely (to say, 5-6 episodes from the current amount of ~30 episodes, removing all the side arcs and just setting up Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship). 

I also find it interesting that you say the ending is 'that good', as while many of the portions before it are highly praised the ending is often heavily criticized.

*Aria the Origination* is actually my favorite anime series of all time, but I have to **strongly caution you**. The series is not at all easy to get into. The *Aria* series is the slowest paced series I've ever seen, and that causes a lot of people to drop the show. It's a series that can/should take months to finish.

Also, keep in mind you'll need to get through *Aria the Animation* and *Aria the Natural* before going on to *Aria the Origination*.
>> ARTICLE
Good to know that it's a slow pace, I'll remember that, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
To give some more insight how long it can take to watch this:

I've started watching Aria the *Animation* on the 21st of December 2014 and now I'm 15 episodes into Aria the *Natural*.

Then again I really want to keep this show for as long as possible, just so I can watch it whenever I'm feeling down.
>> ARTICLE
When you eventually finish Aria, there's Tamayura and Sketchbook to try. I'm on my third re-watch of Aria. There's some episodes of The Origination I think are amongst the best episodes of all anime.

I'll probably restart at The Animation once I've finished Origination. It's nice to have a show like Aria that you can turn to.
>> ARTICLE
I've already seen Tamayura, except for the most recent OVAs, and Sketchbook goes right onto my plan-to-watch list, thanks for the recommendation.

I haven't actually watched Sketchbook yet, I've just heard about it and I plan to watch it soon, so I thought I'd share. I heard it discussed in the same context as Tamayura and Aria so it's a good bet that I (and possibly you) will like it too.
>> ARTICLE
Great work.  A few thoughts:  

> People seem reluctant to put movies in their Favorites list, probably preferring to use the limited number of favorites for TV series instead.  

I feel like a more important factor here is that people are a lot more likely to watch (and score) a movie that they don't like than to watch a series they don't like long enough for their score to count, particularly because a lot of people don't score their drops, regardless of how many episodes they watch.  

> Popular anime do better in this list.  

The 20% rule for scores also goes a long way to explaining this difference.  Those series aren't just popular, they're rather long.  You'd need to watch 74 episodes of Bleach to show up in its denominator under this measure.  
>> ARTICLE

I disagree.

Yes, it's true that people drop movies less than TV series. However, if people don't like a movie and finish/score it, then they'll score it lowly, and this should be clearly reflected in the *MAL* score. Yet so many movies score extremely highly and rank in the top 25, so these people who dislike a movie but finish and score it are not having that much of an effect.

If you take a look at the distribution of scores from something like *[Spirited Away](http://myanimelist.net/anime/199/Sen_to_Chihiro_no_Kamikakushi/stats)* vs. *[Your Lie In April](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso/stats)*, you'll notice that the distributions are really similar; *Spirited Away* actually has a higher distribution of votes than *Your Lie In April*, yet *Spirited Away* has a much, much lower percentage of favorites.

If anything, having more people finish and score a movie would result in a *lower* score because there will be more people who dislike it scoring it low, whereas people who dislike a TV series would drop it early and not have their scores count.

> The 20% rule for scores also goes a long way to explaining this difference. Those series aren't just popular, they're rather long. You'd need to watch 74 episodes of Bleach to show up in its denominator under this measure.

Yes, it seems like being long-running has some effect. I doubt this is the main reason, however. appu1232 suggested accounting for the 20% rule by including dropped and on-hold members, and I suspect long-running series like *Bleach* will still do well.

I think it's more a matter of just being popular / something that a casual viewer is more likely to see. I like the explanation in the [first half of this comment](http://animetics.net/2015/01/15/fun-with-numbers-myanimelists-sequel-problem-should-and-can-be-fixed/#comment-8676). Note that popular series like *Attack on Titan* and *Sword Art Online* also have a high proportion of favorites, but they are of a standard length.
>> ARTICLE
I misinterpreted/misread your comment about movies, I guess.  What you're saying here makes sense.  

On the popularity side, I agree that that both the length and the popularity are factors - though as far as your examples go, Attack on Titan barely benefits (up 5), and Sword Art Online, as a polarizing series, will naturally benefit from this method of analysis regardless of its massive popularity.  School Days is one example of a less popular thing that benefits similarly due to the polarization.  Angel's Egg, despite being a one-shot OVA, also gets a huge boost here (though see below for another factor).  I'm not hugely familiar with polarizing anime beyond those, though, so I can't look much further.  

Another interesting thing I noticed, just eyeballing it, is that this works against recency bias pretty well (possibly indirectly through relative obscurity).  Even something as short, as not particularly niche, and as not particularly polarizing as, say, Honey and Clover benefits pretty strongly here.  This makes sense, too, in that people are a lot more to watch a given thing from 2015 that doesn't hold massive appeal to them than they are to watch something from 2005, and so the average H&C watcher is a lot more likely to really dig it than the average watcher of much of anything from 2015, even though the H&C watcher will (generally) have more anime competing for those favorite slots.
>> ARTICLE
It's cool that a lot of relatively niche genres (mecha, mahou shoujo) get a better representation in the top 100. I'm also surprised to see Armoured trooper VOTOMS at #42, I should probably prioritize watching it now.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently makes #197 on the critics' list too. I haven't seen it myself, but part of the reason I made this list was to find series like this.

Do be careful though, because something being high on the favorites list doesn't mean you'll like it. As you said, there are a lot of niche shows on the list, and it's likely that they're somewhat polarizing shows and will appeal to only a small number of users (but enough to get a high proportion of favorites).
>> ARTICLE
Votoms is pretty fun! It deliberately changes itself every cours or so which is interesting, too.
>> ARTICLE
I think one important thing to note about this is that the reason shows such as LoGH, One Piece, Fairy Tail, Gintama, etc. are so high on the list is because of the shear number of episodes. It's not hard to imagine that only people who know what they are going into will watch a long running show. It's not like picking up a 12 episode show because you saw a gif of a cute girl from it or something. People who watch these anime are very likely to end up liking and favoriting it.

Personally, I think it shouldn't just include the people that scored it, but also the people that put it on-hold and dropped it too. The long shows are still going to be higher, but it wouldn't dominate the top 5 entries either I'd imagine.
>> ARTICLE
That's a good idea. I'll try that once I have time later today. I suspect that it won't make much of a difference though -- something like *One Piece* will still have around 13% favorites.

I believe that it's more due to the series being popular, so casual viewers are more likely to watch it (and thus favorite it, since they haven't watched as many different shows). I like the explanation in the [first half of this comment](http://animetics.net/2015/01/15/fun-with-numbers-myanimelists-sequel-problem-should-and-can-be-fixed/#comment-8676). This also explains why shows like *Attack on Titan* and *Sword Art Online* rank so highly in the favorites list even though they have a standard number of episodes.
>> ARTICLE
The reasoning for using favorites seems off to me.
>    More intuitive: Saying that something scores a 9.2 is pretty abstract, but saying that something is your favorite is a lot more natural, not relying on any arbitrary scale.

Favorites aren't any more or less arbitrary than a rating; they are just binary.

>    Consistent across different users: One user may never give a 10, believing that nothing deserves a "perfect" score, while another user may give 10s to any remotely entertaining series. However, a favorite is an idea that's generally consistent across different people, no matter how they may score a show.

Again, people will value favorites differently.

>    Limited number of favorites: Each user has a limited number of favorites to dole out. Since you cannot spam favorites, each favorite is somewhat valuable, and people will generally only favorite something that they genuinely like.

Just looking at a fringe case here: everyone's 11th favorite show could have a 0 "favorite" rating even though it is only slightly behind 10th.

>> ARTICLE
>Favorites aren't any more or less arbitrary than a rating; they are just binary.

There's psychological evidence that we're better at processing smaller numbers linearly than numbers >4. (See: the subitizing range for humans and the Weber-Fechner law)

The law of large numbers is a bit of a counterpoint to this.

>Popular anime do better in this list. For example, One Piece, Fairy Tail, and Bleach rank 58, 187, and 536 places higher, respectively. Here's one possible explanation saying that casual viewers will weight popular series more highly. Then again, these series do have legitimately fantastic moments, like the Soul Society arc in Bleach.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, It seems to me that there is another bias in that shows on the opposite side of the spectrum would also benefit from this kind of list. Shows that are more of 'cult classics' with small dedicated fanbases are also going to have their rankings skewed upward (as evidenced by Tatami Galaxy, Utena, Rose of Versailles, etc. which you mentioned). As much as I personally agree that these shows should be higher up, intuitively it makes sense to assume the percentage would lower somewhat as the total audience increases, so adjusting for this would give a more accurate list.

These biases could be counteracted somewhat by adding in two things:

1. A dampening effect on the percentages of shows with small popularities (similar to how MAL's current weighted formula does) - this would help counteract the pretty drastic rise of cult shows.

2. Another dampening effect on the value of favorites by the percentage amount of shows listed as favorites on a particular viewers list (lower percentage is more valuable). It'd be difficult to figure out how to formulate this, though, and it'd require we allow unlimited favorites to make things more accurate. This way when a person that has only listed 5 shows lists 4 of them as favorites (which seems to be part of the assumed reason massively popular shows within casual audiences have risen so much), those favorites are not valued as much as someone who only has 1 out of 200 shows listed as favorites. This would, however, obviously require access to the backend of MAL so it's not like we can actually make a list with this attribute.

It'd also be helpful if series were combined within MAL to begin with for favorites - this could make the data for lots of series more accurate (like Gintama, Monogatari, etc.), but it would again require full access to the backend of MAL. It would also be somewhat difficult to completely determine what should be grouped together, I imagine practically everyone would be fine with something like Gintama being all combined, but what about other series? F/Z and F/SN are related, but I think most would agree they should each have separate ratings (though their seasons should be combined within each). There's also some even murkier territory, like Madoka. I'd imagine determining whether rebellion should be considered as a part of the original series would be pretty divisive (it would probably be possible to separate things into the movie series and the original TV series here, but there are almost certainly similar cases where there isn't an obvious way out). In general, combining works of the same series will be actually much more difficult than most realize and might inspire significant disagreements (which is probably why MAL has decided to ignore the prospect).

>intuitively it makes sense to assume the percentage would lower somewhat as the total audience increases, so adjusting for this would give a more accurate list.

I see absolutely no evidence for this claim, except for the surprise at the inclusion of these entries.

In fact, over the past year, The Tatami Galaxy has been climbing in a statistically significant way, not falling (I'm slightly annoyed by this fact).
>> ARTICLE
It's the trend for most shows in general but especially 'cult classics'. Sure, Tatami Galaxy might be an exception (though, it's only barely in the category to begin with), but there will always be exceptions and it's a pretty well known concept. People that like a particular kind of show will be the first to watch it, so they are more likely to end up rating it highly. As a more general audience watches it, it's likely that the average rating will, therefore, fall. Shows with less scores are therefore generally skewed upward a bit. It's the exact reasoning that basically *every* site that has a list with highest average ratings weights said ratings by popularity (and MAL is no exception as seen by their [formula](http://myanimelist.net/info.php?go=topanime)). 
>> ARTICLE
The number of voters on MAL are large enough that regression to the mean doesn't really apply like it would if a series had ~1000 votes (since the margin of error is really low).

>it's a pretty well known concept

I don't doubt this is the case for *average rating* but I'm not sure this carries over into favorites.  It contradicts my data from last year compared to this one for sure.

EDIT: Wait, I take this back.  It's hard to separate "recency bias" from this "small, cult fanbase" effect.

>It's the exact reasoning that basically every site that has a list with highest average ratings weights said ratings by popularity (and MAL is no exception as seen by their formula). 

No, the reason they *should* rate by popularity is because of regression to the mean, which is formalized quantitatively by stuff like [Wilson scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval).  It's also a way to appease a userbase by pushing popular stuff up higher.  That said, MAL is not a huge offender at all, unlike IMDB, where m is over 10,000.
>> ARTICLE
>The number of voters on MAL are large enough that regression to the mean doesn't really apply like it would if a series had ~1000 votes (since the margin of error is really low). 

As far as MAL's formula goes, I can tell you for sure that the shift does *very significantly* matter. Take 'The Tatami Galaxy' for instance, since we already happen to be talking about it anyway. Taking the weighted mean of it's listed score counts gives us ~8.9866. I'm sure you can recognize that it's listed score of 8.65 is pretty damn significantly lower. That is exactly the effect described, working as intended.

Regression to the mean isn't exactly the phenomenon I'm describing, anyway (at least in its most general form where it applies to basically all data sets). I'm talking about the phenomenon I described above where "people that like a particular kind of show will be the first to watch it". This is a pretty obvious concept if you think about it - people will try out shows they think they will like and tend to stay away from those they think they won't. Thus, it stands to reason, that as a show begins to exhaust it's initial base (that is likely to favor it), a greater portion of those that newly view it will have more centered or even negative views on the work. Therefore, the average rating will also become centered over time (and the exact same logic holds for portions of favorites). There will certainly be exceptions to the rule, as The Tatami Galaxy seems to be from your data, but that doesn't mean the logic for the general case doesn't hold.
>> ARTICLE
I know this is an old thread but that's actually incorrect. 8.98 is the average when taking (votes from the stats page)/32,822

The number of votes recorded on the stats page is actually 34,354, making the user average rating ~8.58. However, the problem with both of those numbers is that only voters who have seen at least (#of episodes)/5.2 are included in the v that the MAL formula uses.  

In the case of The Tatami Galaxy this means at least 11/5.2  2.2, or 3 episodes, need to be recorded as being watched before a score is counted. In other words, only 32,822 people who have rated The Tatami Galaxy have actually watched more than 2 episodes.

The formula used on MAL is: Weighted Rank (WR) = (v / (v + m)) * S + (m / (v + m)) * C

* S = Average score for the Anime (mean).
* v = Number of votes for the Anime = (Number of people scoring the Anime).
* m = Minimum votes/scores required to get a calculated score (currently 50 scores required).
* C = The mean score across the entire Anime DB.

Assume for now that we know C. Let's say we want to know how many votes V an anime needs for the formula to have  x impact on its score. Looking at |WR - S|  x we get V = ceiling(m * (|C - S| - x) / x). Since it depends on the score, we can't use it to determine a general minimum voter count. Interestingly, when |C - S|  x we always get |WR - S|  x.

However, a more general minimum voter count can be found by looking at the weighting term m * C / (v + m). We can look at when this term  x, which gives us V = ceiling(m * (C - x) / x).

Now earlier I said to assume we knew C, but that's not true. Because of the minimum votes to count issue, it's incredibly hard to determine C accurately. According to [this thread from 2014](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1294711), C = 6.573, but that may have changed. For the sake of argument I'll look at the worst case scenario (the biggest impact this term could possibly have) by taking C = 10.

If we want the weighting term to be  0.1, we have 50*(10-0.1)/0.1 = 4950, which is pretty low. To have it  0.01 we only need 49950 ratings. We can look at this the other way round, too. The Tatami Galaxy has 32822 ratings, which means this term has an impact of ~0.015 on its score, an incredibly small difference (assuming C = 10, a much larger score than is likely).

If we redo these with C = 6.573, we instead get V = 3237 for it to have an impact of  0.1, and V = 32815 for an impact of  0.01. With these numbers, the impact for The Tatami Galaxy is ~0.0099.
>> ARTICLE
>Taking the weighted mean of it's listed score counts gives us ~8.9866.

Whoa, I had no idea that MAL was such a bad offender with this.  What is your source on this?

>This is a pretty obvious concept if you think about it - people will try out shows they think they will like and tend to stay away from those they think they won't.

The grounds for saying it be most pronounced with a small number of voters are really weak though.  People will be self-selecting anyway.  I might have a model where the sorts of people who watch airing shows are generalists, whereas someone watching a show years after its aired has selected it very specifically.  In this model, you'd see the exact opposite effect--a show will rise as it accumulates more votes, not fall.  Or maybe I have a model where the first people to rate a show will be especially harsh, whereas people who rate afterwards take score cues and feel bad if they're giving a highly rated show low marks.  Under this model, you'd also see scores rise over time.

So no, I don't think this level of weighting is justified by any statistics at all, if the variable MAL is trying to adhere to is actual quality.  Now, if they're most concerned about appeasing people by filling their top chart with popular stuff that people have seen, then their strategy makes a lot of sense.
>> ARTICLE
>Whoa, I had no idea that MAL was such a bad offender with this.

Yeah, they probably go a bit overboard to say the least.

>I might have a model where the sorts of people who watch airing shows are generalists, whereas someone watching a show years after its aired has selected it very specifically. In this model, you'd see the exact opposite effect--a show will rise as it accumulates more votes, not fall. Or maybe I have a model where the first people to rate a show will be especially harsh, whereas people who rate afterwards take score cues and feel bad if they're giving a highly rated show low marks. Under this model, you'd also see scores rise over time.

But what are the backings for those models? I don't have any hard data on the model I proposed (which is why I initially used the word intuitively), but I'd be willing to be hard data would back it up. Why would the people who watch a show while airing be generalists? The idea that people that are interested in the kind of show something sells itself to be while be the majority of those trying it still holds. 

I do agree that people 'seeking out' a show are more likely to like it, but that fits in exactly with the phenomenon I'm describing (more on this below).

>So no, I don't think this level of weighting is justified by any statistics at all, if the variable MAL is trying to adhere to is actual quality.

I don't think the aim is actual 'quality' - if our goal was to represent quality a binary 'favorites' system would be incredibly ineffective compared to 1-10 scores (particularly since favorites don't even *imply* that a person should be trying to decide critically). As to what the actual goal is, it's hard to specify - maybe something like 'a list ordered by how likely the average viewer is to end up loving a show'. That fits in with the favorite system proposed (and the favorites system would do a better job of it than 1-10 ratings because of the critiques that have already been given about 1-10 ratings, such as variance in rating meanings).

This goal leads directly into why I say those 'seeking out' shows fits with what I'm describing. Take the very concept of a cult classic: a work that is very well liked by a smaller group but generally would not be considered to perform as well with a general, randomized audience. Such a work would have a really small base of voters, but a very high average score. If you were to randomly select people to view and then rate the work, however, the average of those would likely be quite a bit lower (precisely because they are average viewers and not people that would seek the work out). Thus, with our main goal in mind, such shows should be centered toward the mean somewhat in order to account for that.
>> ARTICLE
>But what are the backings for those models?

I was just proposing alternate models.  I have no idea, but I don't think that relying on intuition is actually all that useful here.

>I don't think the aim is actual 'quality' - if our goal was to represent quality a binary 'favorites' system would be incredibly ineffective compared to 1-10 scores

Only insofar as the margin of error might be higher for binary scores, but this actually is within 1% when N > 1000.

Sure, there's a lot of nuance here as far as what favorites or a rating "means" psychologically.

I've never actually seen any evidence of a "cult premium" that you're describing.  It is a plausible model, sure, but I doubt it's an accurate one.  If anything, people's preferences seem remarkably *regular* in the aggregate (it's rare to find a movie with a significant number of votes where there's a large ratings divergence between men and women in IMDB demographic data, for instance).

Data point 2: https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/icheckmovies+-+most+favorite/

Does this look like a cult film list to you?  Does it look like a film list focused on "entertainment"?  I wouldn't expect either, really.  It doesn't have any of the usual films that are "cult films" (except Aguirre, which is hugely critically acclaimed).  It looks like a critic's list, although a very strange critic who happens to also be into anime, J-dramas, and random movies from all over the world.

>> ARTICLE
Yup, that happens. There's always a vocal fanbase, even more so with media from popular series where some people will go out of their way to favorite and rate everything highly (even if they haven't consumed the media themselves).

JoJo is a fairly popular series with some vocal fans, so even though that manga is something not many people have read, a bunch of people probably favorited it without ever reading it at all.

You can see the effect in my data set as well. When I pulled the data in early January, Kizumonogatari had not yet been released, yet it already had 161 favorites with only 10 scorers, resulting in a 1600% favorited ratio.

This is why I excluded shows with fewer than 1,000 scorers. The more people there are, the less a small fanbase can skew the data.

Many overlooked this show when it was airing.  The title alone turns people off because of how bad White Album was.  Don't let yourselves be fooled, while White Album 2 is in the same universe as White album, it is in no way a sequel to the original two anime.  What you missed was a show that depicts a more realistic teenage relationship then most, if not all, anime.  I give it a solid 8/10, and if a sequel is made to detail the story more it could be even better.

**Format**:  13 episodes (first season) + 13 episodes (second season)

**Year**: 2008

**Genre(s)**: Mystery, Drama, Romance, Shoujo, Vampire, Supernatural

**Synopsis**
> Cross Academy is an elite boarding school with two separate, isolated classes: the Day Class and the Night Class. On the surface, Yuuki Cross and Zero Kiryuu are prefects of the academy, and attempt to keep order between the students as classes rotate in the evenings. As the night class is full of utterly gorgeous elites, this can sometimes prove to be a bit difficult. It is completely necessary, however, as those "elites" are actually vampires. Yuuki and Zero act as guardians, protecting the secrets of the Night Class and the safety of the ignorant day class.

> As the adopted daughter of the academy's chairman, Yuuki takes her job with a serious and energetic attitude. It also allows her to interact with her secret crush and savior, the night class' dorm president, Kaname Kuran. Zero, on the other hand, has a deep-rooted hatred against vampires, and at times, does not hesitate to kill.

> Can vampires and humans co-exist, even in the strict setup of the Cross Academy? Only time will tell.

**Synopsis**
> In some distant future, it's common knowledge that all wolves have been extinct for 200 years. However, it seems this is false as wolves have not disappeared but rather have taken human form. Kiba, a lone wolf, wanders into a city, trying to sniff out the Lunar Flowers that are supposed to lead whoever follows the scent to paradise. The source of the smell is Cheza, a girl who sleeps in what appears to be suspended animation in a lab. She and the wolves are drawn to each other, and Kiba hopes to find paradise once he finds the source of the scent of Lunar Flowers. However, once Kiba finds Cheza, she is kidnapped by a mysterious person called Darcia, and his search begins anew. Before he leaves the city, he meets 3 other wolves, Tsume, Hige and Toboe. All four wolves have very different personalities and ideas, and their friendliness towards each other is a little rough around the edges. However, they soon band together to continue to search for paradise.

Ahh, *Wolf's Rain.*  It may not seem it from the comments I'm about to post, but I actually liked this show alright.My first issue with the show is that it tries too hard to be "all things to all people."  Want sci-fi?  Want fantasy?  Want a buddy show about animals?  Want a show involving a man trying to reconnect with his ex-wife?  Want a grimdark finale OVA?  *Wolf's Rain* falls into all these, but excels at none.I also, unlike many reviewers, found Yoko Kanno's OST to be distracting.  In particular, the jazzy pieces never quite fit the mood of the scenes they accompanied.  Crescendos were at inappropriate moments, and it just felt, well, off.The sci-fi setting was also a poor decision, in my opinion.  With so much of the show dependant on mysticism rather than technology, a historical fantasy or even steampunk setting would have gone a long way to adding believability to the show.And finally, I felt the OVA finale, while providing a true conclusion to an unfinished show, was made overly dark just for the sake of being so.  It didn't feel like I was watching an extension of the series because the mood shift was so significant.  I like the conclusiveness, but the path taken could've been more in line with the show to that point, and still served its purpose.

When she reaches home, she casually peeks into the bottom of the mug and discovers an engraved note, which says, "If you read this message aloud while pouring hot cocoa into the mug, a love fairy ("muglox") will appear and grant your every wish." The skeptical but curious Kaede follows the directions and announces her wish to date Yuuki, the class heartthrob. Suddenly, the adorable blue Mirumo appears!

**Genre(s)**: Action, Cars, Sports, Seinen

**Synopsis**
> Based on a seinen manga by Kusunoki Michiharu serialised in Young Magazine. 

> The story gets its roots from the actual street racing that occurs on Tokyo's Shuto Expressway, one stretch of which is known as the "Wangan", literally meaning "bay side" (although it is generally used to refer to the freeway), the longest, straightest road in the entire country. Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. 

> One day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the "BlackBird"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority.

Hey, want a Gonzo show with fighting chicks? No, this is not a faithful Japanese adaptation of the western comic. It's kind of its own thing.

The little daughter is more competent than her mother, who always gets a rackshot with "dem melons" bouncing. The supernatural aspect is really fighting chicks in scantly clad armor.

I liked how they tried to spin a romance, mother-daughter relationships and some of side characters were fun for the comic relief stereotypes they were.

A schlocky trainwreck you watch because of its compelling pacing and morbid curiosity.  
I'm serious, as bad as I make it sound *it's watchable* if you can handle T&A action.

Best openings ever

Full 3min versions of Ringo and rumba rap also exist with similarly great visual style, but I dunno if it's allowed to post them here and the ones with good quality got taken down from youtube just recently.

What I love about the OPs is that if you know how the manga ends, you can see that the author told the anime crew how he planned to end the manga, several years before he did. Because some of the crazy imagery in those Openings is actually spoiler material.

Is that how he planned to end it all along, or just the idea he got when he came to it?

He could have easily just thought, "hmm, that opening isn't a bad idea for an ending actually" and wanted to do it intentionally for the connection. 
>> ARTICLE
No, that's not likely. Watching the openings you don't really see a story being told. What he hid in there looks mostly like random stuff to someone who doesn't know the ending. Even the littlest things to those who don't know [like](/s "the anatomical drawings in Rumba or the other girls lip syncing to Fuura's part in Ringo") and lots of other stuff make so much sense afterwards.

Also throughout the series there are lots of foreshadowing and attention to detail. It's very clear that he was planning to end it that way.

Finally I managed to finish [WT!] thread for my favorite anime. It was really hard to do for several reasons:

* It was needed to avoid my inner fanboyism and to present actual information that is valuable for those who's not familiar with the anime;

* Selecting right information, because I can talk about this anime for hours;

* Taking pictures/gifs and formatting with checking (though I still made few mistakes...);

* Character limit really pressed me up and I didn't want to use comment section as means of post continuation.

But I'm glad I finally did that and sticked to my initial promise. It really means a lot to me, because Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei is *the only anime* that I consider myself to be true fan of.

Ah, one of my favourite anime comedies ever. SZS was also one of my first anime comedies, so perhaps I'm a bit biased...

In any case, I've rewatched the show more than once, and I still love it. I love Kumeta's humour, and I love Shaft's art and animation. Forget Monogatari, I think that SZS is the pinnacle of Shinbo's directing.

Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei definitely isn't for everyone. It's humour is an acquired taste, and many of its references can be hard to get. Still, though, I think that it is an amazing show.

> after finishing the series remember to read chapters from 292 to 301

I watched something like the first two seasons, and gave up on the OVAs because I felt the show was steadily going down in quality/I was getting tired of the episodic nature of the show. I tried reading the manga (from the begging) but the only scanalation I could find was really poor. Grammar/spelling mistakes, no TL notes till the end of the chapter (which makes it really hard to get context for jokes), and just a translation that kinda ruined the humor of it completely. I found out there's an official translation, but I also heard it's incomplete.  
>> ARTICLE
Official TL goes up to around volume 10 or so. Can't remember exactly how much was actually licensed. As for scanlations, it's still incomplete (around 20 chapters from here and there still untranslated) but one group and some /a/non has been doing occasional chapters lately so there's still hope for a complete series.

The large majority of the manga follows the very formulaic format, but those last 10 or so chapters are different and worth reading. And it might just motivate you to watch the rest (even though S2 is the high point of the show, IMO).
>> ARTICLE
Yup, if you haven't seen this watch it - it's hilarious.

Fantastic job on this. This is the write up from you I was waiting for. I have had this on my PTW for a while now and definitely plan to watch it soon. Really like the Shaft direction style and it sounds like I would enjoy the themes this show explores. Thanks for this.
>> ARTICLE
Do you guys think it will ever get licensed for a u.s release ?
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say "never", it was actually quite popular in the US when it came out, and because it actually was licensed by Media Blasters in 2010. They sat on it for 3 years which was just enough time for the anime community to forget about it. (I have never forgiven them...)

If it were any other show, I'd say it was popular enough some company might grab it on the cheap a few years down the line but there is so much dialogue, background text and vague references to be explained (anime companies don't seem to like doing liner notes anymore) that releasing it here might be too daunting for anyone.

Never ever. It's old, hard as all hell to translate and it wouldn't sell. They tried with the manga but they stopped after like 10 volumes (which isn't even close to finishing).

I was really pleased with this series. After the last few episodes I don't hesitate to call it one of my new favorites. I already feel like I need to watch it again just to catch all the references between episodes. Wasn't there at least one episode where the protagonist stumbles upon a bearded version of himself in the 4 1/2 tatami room? Stuff like that (references to *future* episodes) really made this series feel unique.

The love triangle (rectangle?) episodes were the only ones where I felt that the repetition got... repetitive? But, like a lot of the series, a good deal of the repetition was still funny.

I *really* liked the ending though. The episode before the last really set the stage for the narrative of the whole series, so much so that I'm surprised it didn't come earlier- but I guess then we would've known too much. I liked pretty much everything about the final episode- the redux of the scene on the bridge that ended the first episode, the swarm of moths released from the tatami-room-maze, and most of all the way the protagonist and Ozu switch roles (and teeth! I didn't even notice until the last scene!)

My interpretation (or at least it could be- it's late and I watched the episode a few weeks ago) was that it was the protagonist's realization that instead of Ozu being constantly mischievous in all of his realities, it was just his *perception* that Ozu was a constantly mischievous person, so he was unable to see that Ozu was his only constant friend.

I really liked the ending because it seems so unfitting for a show with this premise- I didn't things would wrap up so nicely, especially in 11 episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
>it was just his perception that Ozu was a constantly mischievous person

I adored the Secret Society Chinese Restaurant episode where the protagonist took on several of the villain roles that Ozu had in previous episodes!  It portrayed the rest of the series from the other side of the gun, which was a great setup to Higuchi's revelation that the protagonist's previous efforts (which Ozu often messed up) were all in vain due to his unreal, idealistic expectations of what his college life should be.  The series built up Ozu as this unreliable villain for most of the series, and then pulled a 180 in episode 9 by revealing him to be both an amazing friend and the hero of the show!

Considering how many anime recently have had rather lackluster endings (\*cough\*Angel Beats\*cough\*), I thought just the last episode alone was enough to propel it head and shoulders above any other anime released this year.

[Zetsuen no Tempest](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest) I liked it a lot and besides one or two people who mention this it doesn't seem to be that popular around here which is a shame.

To be fair, the first half of the show sets itself up for something that it really isn't.

That's a criticism I can accept, the two halves are really different from each other. I enjoyed both of them for different reasons even though it felt like a complete different direction.

I agree. First half was seriously some of the best episodes I've ever seen, but the second half didn't fail to deliver, it just delivered everything differently than I wanted.

It has two distinct parts and like amethyst said there's a little bit of everything in there. The main characters and how they interact with each other is refreshing and the show has a great build up with it's atmosphere and a solid conclusion.

[Kyousougiga!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_(TV) It has one of the best [female characters](http://i.imgur.com/DkDbXdY.jpg) in anime (voiced by Rie Kugimiya, if she's your thing, and in a non-tsundere role) and is way less popular than it probably should be. It's often at the bottom of "underrated/under watched" threads, if it's mentioned at all. I has a style similar to some kind of FLCL+Ikuhara combination, and it has one of the [best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rihXJIRwzsw) [soundtracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQnfqDbJxXI) [I've](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkh8kgPH_ik) [heard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtS8_4SpQiA)

Do you follow Voice Actors/Actresses?  It does look interesting.

Not really, just if they're popular/some of my favourites. Some other characters she voices are Taiga from Toradora and White from Kekkai Sensen.

It also has heavy family themes if you like stuff such as Penguindrum, The Eccentric Family, Clannad, Usagi Drop, Wolf Children.

I don't really remember but it might have. Slow starts have never really bothered me so it's hard to remember.

Anyways it's about this depressed NEET and his problems. The animation quality is subpar because it's old so I hope that doesn't bother you.

I'm going to do something for you, and that's introduce one of my favorite unsung anime of all time...

**[THE LEGEND OF BLACK HEAVEN](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1025/Kachou_Ouji)**

Our hero, Oji Tanaka, is a mild-mannered salariman. He works at a soulless office where his job crushes him into oblivion on a daily basis. He has a boring life in a boring apartment, with a boring wife and a bored son. Day after day, week after week, month after month, he gets by just like every other adult who gave up on their hopes and dreams in order to make it in the grown up world. 

To be successful. 

To be respectable. 

To be part of society.

And then one day... One day, his past catches up with him. That glorious wonderful past when he toured the country and made women scream his name! That incredible past when he was a  

#[GOD OF ROCK!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFOF9acNUH8)

Once again, his music can mean something.

Once again, his *life* can mean something.

And the entire universe will never be the same afterwards.

Ever week it seems, since I started this, someone gives me a high quality response and I regret that the only way I have to reward it is to watch the suggestion.  Thank you kind internet person.

Just wait a few weeks for when I hit you with either Ah! My Goddess, Kimikiss Pure Rouge, Bartender, or Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex.
>> ARTICLE
Yea it was aweosme. I love the op, Maigo Inu to Ame no beat. Loved seeing how each iteration gave a different perspective on things. [Ozu is one of the best characters written in anime imo because](/s "we see him through an unreliable narrator.")

I'm not a fan of the monogatari shows at all or any "talking-head" type shows in general, but this show is not quite like that. Very well done.

I *highly* recommend Ping Pong the aniamtion, also by Yuasa (director). Kaiba is also good but the ending is a badly written clusterfuck.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I like the ED more than the OP. Both are really good, but the latter is excellent.
>> ARTICLE
Ozu is so well written. Ping Pong is also in my backlog; I might even consider picking it up next seeing that it's from the same director.
>> ARTICLE
You definitely should. It's even better than the previous live-action movie adaptation, and makes good use of the extra time it has to work with.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, dat ED. Yakushimaru Etsuko is legend.

It was really refreshing to watch an anime that looks and feels like something that would be intentionally pretentious and confusing come out in the end and be incredibly clear about what it was trying to say.

It's like a way better Endless Eight (Haruhi), that's for sure.

Stellar work as usual, was pleasure to read about one of my favorite directors of all time. Want to note that I have similar perception (and valuation) of his shows as you, I also consider The Tatami Galaxy as his the hands-down best work and felt that Kaiba didn't realize its full potential. Would personally rate his shows as The Tatami Galaxy > Mind Game > Kemonozume > Kaiba =  Ping Pong the Animation.

That said, can we also have a [Kenji Nakamura](http://myanimelist.net/people/7217/Nakamura_Kenji) post? He's a very good director that made at least two great and unique shows (Mononoke, Kuuchuu Buranko) and some other interesting ones ([C], Tsuritama, Gatchaman Crowds). I think he also deserves some spotlight.

And! Though they are not directors, but creative team of Yoshitoshi ABe and Yasayuki Ueda (Serial Experiments Lain, Texhnolyze, Haibane Renmei) could also use some sort of 'special' edition of this series of posts.

Thanks in advance, looking forward to reading your next submissions!
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong was really great, I'd probably move it beside Mind Game personally. (see: my ping pong review post from yesterday :P)

Nakamura, Dezkai, Abe/Ueda, Urobuchi, there are so many guys with great works that I'd like to get too. Once I reach my Tezuka post, I'll take another look through. Big fan of Gatchaman Crowds and Mononoke, so he will be high up on the list. :)
>> ARTICLE
i don't get the quentin Tarantino reference at all.  Tarantino story structures seem to be conventional obviously he is most famous for his dialogue.

Massaki is much more of an unconventional story teller.  not really an expert on movie directer to give a good comparison.  However Tarantino seems way off.  
>> ARTICLE
I might not have worded it very well. I was speaking mostly to Tarantino's worlds vs reality. Another example would be Wes Anderson, where the films aesthetic is completely thought through. 

As far as Narrative Structure, Yuasa seems much more like a Kaufman or other more esoteric director. 
>> ARTICLE
Of Yuasa's works, I think I've only seen Mind Game, Tatami Galaxy, and Ping Pong. He certainly has a unique, thought-provoking style, and I am a fan of it.

I'll have to get around to the rest of his work at some point...
>> ARTICLE
His shorts, and Kemonozume all fall more and more towards the Mind Game end of the spectrum, less defined than his later stuff. A lot of great visually stunning work. :)
>> ARTICLE
I watched the episode of Adventure Time he worked on after you posted it (I think I had previously caught part of it on TV when it first aired)... [Very fun episode.](http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-food-chain-205771)
>> ARTICLE
Definitely a huge fan of him. It does seem Kemonozume is one of his that is often overlooked but definitely my second favorite from him.

Although I haven't seen Mind Game or Kaiba yet, I haven't been disappointed. If I had to rank the three I've seen it'd be Ping Pong > Kemonozume > Tatami Galaxy, but again I love all three.

Also, his episode for Space Dandy was really great. While not my favorite Space Dandy episode, it was definitely one of the better ones.   

Not really much to add, but looking forward to what he has in store for the future. 
>> ARTICLE
Do you remember which episode he did? I'm on the vest vs. underwear one (episode 6) and haven't seen anything in his style yet. Unless its in the second season.
>> ARTICLE
He also did an ep of Adventure Time btw
>> ARTICLE
I believe it is episode 9 in second season. And episode 16 is done by one of his students from Kaiba, and is an homage to the series. OR I might have swapped them in my mind. It is definitely more Mind Game animated than Ping Pong, so you should notice it right away.
>> ARTICLE
It's in the second season. I don't remember the exact episode but the minute you see it you'll recognize it's his. It's about trying to catch a fish. 
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy is such a great series, so many great artists allowed to do their thing.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is in fact partially animated in Flash.  [Check out this production video](https://vimeo.com/102103466) Yuasa's studio uploaded, this is it if you're ever curious on how the magic happens.

Greatest anime director of all time
>> ARTICLE
The last 5 on my list, plus the unforgettable Dezkai, would tend to disagree. But yeah Yuasa is a magical man, one of my favorites. :)
>> ARTICLE
A) Every anime fan should get into Yuasa's works at some point. Chances are once you watch one, you'll quickly get to watching them all.

B) Everyone needs to see Genius Party. It isn't just Yuasa, and it is some surreal, beautiful, extremely creative works in animation.
>> ARTICLE
Watanabe's 2 shorts were AMAZING in Genius Party. I love both of them so much.
>> ARTICLE
He was actually sort of the reason I watched Genius Party in the first place. I don't think I'll ever be able to forget my first time watching it.

Wish there was more creatively unrestricted stuff like that. 
>> ARTICLE
There have been quite a few anthology style series. Space Dandy is Watanabe keeping the tradition alive. [Neo Tokyo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1951/Manie-Manie:_Meikyuu_Monogatari) is another great one that features Rintaro, Otomo, and Kawajiri. Also, [Memories](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1462/Memories) has Magnetic Rose, one of the best pieces of work I've ever experienced.
>> ARTICLE
I love Space Dandy, and Neo Tokyo is on my to-watch list. I guess I should add Memories as well. Thank you!

From the GIF you put in there, should I expect this show to have mature themes? I just want to know if I can watch this in the living room during the day or if I should wait and watch it in my room.

There are bits of the script for the Tatami Galaxy around online iirc with some detailed directions, etc. but never came across the actual screenplay (I believe the BD Box came with some excerpts from the script). I'm sure if you looked hard enough on actual Japanese forums/sites they might be able to help. Screenplays for anime aren't exactly easy to find, and even if you do, they're in Japanese.

Yea, I think finding Lain's script was rare enough lol

[Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka)!

The show is overall 22 episodes. A Slice of Life/Mystery with a great [cast of characters](http://i.imgur.com/WeqRoRE.gif) that have awesome chemistry between each other, [especially the main two.](http://i.imgur.com/MpA0KNw.gif) All the mysteries are small, but interesting nonetheless, and end up leading to something bigger than how it started. Hearing the theories of the characters, and how they arrived to their conclusions is great and always makes sense! 

The characters, especially the MC, subtly develop throughout the show, and seeing the change is definitely noticeable by the end.   

The show is made by KyoAni, so you can definitely expect an absolute gorgeous show, and with a great soundtrack to boot. 

The show also has what I consider to be a *fantastic* ending!

Oh! What about Gatchaman Crowds? I was going to write something up, but [this article](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-10-23/gatchaman-crowds-explained/.94523) I read earlier sums up really nicely what I would've tried to say. I'd say to give it a try if you're up for some thinking and probably even some self reflection.  

edit: only read up to the first paragraph of the great and terrible Internet part 
>> ARTICLE
Aww, no quotes? No paraphrasing?  Little effort just throwing a link up.  You want to say anything about it?
>> ARTICLE
I was in class earlier and didn't really have the time to write my own opinions about it so I thought I'd just throw out the suggestion with an already existing and well written article. But since you asked and I have free time I'll try and write a little bit myself.  

So the first season of Gatchaman Crowds is more or less about the Internet and the dangers that come along with it. The main focus of the show is more or less the social networking app, GALAX. Galax is a social networking app designed to help people by connecting them to qualified citizens in their area. For example, someone gets injured in the streets of Tokyo, someone else reports that on Galax, and then every doctor/nurse/person with a background in the medical field is alerted. These people can choose to accept or ignore the challenge and earn points for completing it. They've basically taken helping people and turned it into a game which I guess isn't all that bad. The worse part, however, are the Crowds. Crowds is basically a separate feature in the app that is only available to 100 individuals that were hand chosen. These individuals take control of some weird monster thing that has superhuman ability. That and the introduction of a huge troll of a villain are where the main problems come into play.  

Overall, I thought crowds was a great show. It made me look at the internet in a different way than I previously had and also made me start thinking more for myself rather than blindly following the masses. It has amazing art (IMO at least) and did I mention superheroes? or aliens? Well, those are there too. 
>> ARTICLE
I think you've managed to peek my interest now.  I'll add it to the options this week.

Sword of the Stranger.

Great movie if you are looking for some good old samurai sword fighting. You follow Nanashi, a ronin, and Tobimaru, the best dog bro ever, and this kid named Kotarou who's tagging along for whatever reason. smh

Nanashi and Tobimaru meet, and they became best friends right off the bat. Then, some kid named Kotaro tags along. Kotar can't do anything, but Tobimaru's a nice dog. Nanashi just rolls with it because Tobimaru's his bro. Kota turns out to be in some trouble because of some wacky shit. A bunch of badass sword fights later, Nanashi and Tobimaru get to Kot. Epic final fight happens but not for Ko cuz he's a wimp. Then, everything is K.

But seriously, the sword fights are some of the best I've seen, and this movie came out in 2007. It puts so many modern stuff to shame. Tobimaru is a boss. He catches a fucking knife  or two cuz he's just that much of a bro. He looks out for his bros. The relationship between Kotarou and Nanashi is good. They bond nicely.

If you want something quick, Time of Eve is fantastic and is only six episodes long. It is the best OVA that I have watched. 

The main theme is whether androids deserve human rights. In the world of Time of Eve, androids are forced to act emotionless even though they have very vibrant personalities. If they do end up showing emotion, they are disassembled.

This of course leads to a ton of great drama. I probably haven't done the best job at selling this show but it truly is great and I highly recommend it.

Today, I am here to represent one of the greatest multimedia franchises Japan has given to us in recent years. I speak of the one and only [Love Live! School Idol Project](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15051/Love_Live!_School_Idol_Project). I have recently contracted with a good friend on Reddit to rewatch Love Live while he watches it, so I'll extend the recommendation for this week to you as well.

Love Live is one of the shining examples of the idol genre, following the formation and growth of the idol group 's, which started as a simple mission to save their school from closing. Love Live features a wide cast of main characters of all different types and personalities, while also delivering solid animation, as to be expected from Sunrise, and a story that just continues to grip you more as it goes on. Along with the characters, animation, and story comes the most important aspect of an idol anime: the music. The music from Love Live is some of the best music I have heard from any anime and from anything across mediums, I can completely say 's has become my favorite musical group through a wide-range of sounds and overall fantastic production values in everything they put out. While you may have already seen it according to your MAL, Love Live is a series truly deserving of a re-watch

Love live is love.  Love live is live.  All jokes aside I always claim to be a sucker for Aidoru or Idol anime even thou I haven't managed to finish the most recent Idolmaster.  Well I think I've digressed enough to tell you it is certainly and option this week.

Waaatch Berserrrrrrrk :3

> My suggestion for you is to watch Berserk (original TV series)! (sidenote: Skip the first episode, and watch it after you finish the rest of the series). Berserk starts *in medias res* but never quite catches up to the events of the first episode. You will not miss anything, and only stand to have a better viewing experience if you skip episode 1. It may as well be full of spoilers because of how the adaptation works :p

>(Note: Going to keep things vague in case you somehow don't know anything about the series c:)

>In Berserk, we follow our protagonist Guts, a very strong mercenary who has no reason in life but to fight. He soon enough meets Griffith, and their fates from then on become intertwined. Berserk is set in a medieval-fantasy styled world and centres around themes of ambition, tragedy, and fate. I consider the storytelling, and journey of Guts to be amongst the pinnacle of what can be experienced in the medium.

>One of my strongest fascinations with the TV series, is it's stunning OST. Composed by [Hirasawa Susumu](http://myanimelist.net/people/5750/Hirasawa_Susumu), the man who went on to compose for works such as Mousou Dairinin, Paprika and Millennium Actress. His composition encapsulates the overall tone and feeling of Berserk. Working perfectly to complement the mood and atmosphere the story conveys.

>The only downside Berserk (TV series) has going for it, is that the art is quite old by todays standards (didn't effect my enjoyment, but I'm raising this issue incase it does for you). Thankfully, the animation is still quite good in fight scenes.

>I have 2 cautions for Berserk:

>- It can be brutal and grotesque as fuck.

>- If you watch the anime, you may get hooked on continuing and reading the manga :p

>As long as you are okay with these, I wholeheartedly recommend you watch it :)

Do you need more information or convincing?
>> ARTICLE
There's only two shows on my MAL that you haven't watched yet. One of them is [Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari). 

I'd tell you what it's all about but I really don't know how. They talk a lot, there's the random fanservice, they talk some more, there's occasionally a fightscene, and more talk. When you get really into it I think it's pretty good. 

It's popular for a reason. You should watch it and then add the entire main cast to the top of your best girl list. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't that part of a bigger series which seems a little daunting and has an extremely fervent following?  I'll add it as an option this week but I'm skeptical to jump into a long series only to watch one season of it.
>> ARTICLE
True enough. But if you don't watch Bakemonogatari you'll never get to Nisemonogatari and truly learn proper dental hygiene. 

Also, it's not like there's a big overarching storyline behind it all. Atleast I don't think so? I feel like I should be more sure of this. If you finish Bake and don't feel like continuing I don't think you'd be really missing out on important storystuff though. It's just more of the same with more character development or whatever. Maybe that's not strictly true but I feel like it's not completely wrong either. I'm not sure what I'm really saying anymore so I'll just stop.

Plus Senjougahara needs your vote in the next Best Girl contest.

**BUT IN ANY CASE**

Let me recommend the only other show that I've watched and you haven't. [Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou). Basically it's slice-of-life done perfectly. Might not be the kinda show you bingewatch though, took me 2 month to finish it but I still loved all of it. 

It's nice. It's fun. If you like slice-of-life stuff you really should give Nichijou a try. If you don't you should still give it a try.  But I think watching the whole thing over a week might get boring though, so I don't know if it really works for this sorta thing. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I've seen Nichijou or at least most of it and forgot to add it.  I remember gags involving the robot. Might be better to rewatch it since I don't recall.
>> ARTICLE
Is it time for another episode of "50 Weeks Of /r/PorpoiseOfLife"? I think it is! But don't worry, as this time I'm going to aim for the bonus round with a 3-episode OVA known as...

[Le Portrait de Petit Cossette](http://myanimelist.net/anime/514/Cossette_no_Shouzou)

Part Hitchcockian thriller, part Lovecraftian horror, and part Poeian mystique, Cossette tells of a man who falls in love with the image of a young woman and the horrible things that happened to her centuries ago. With more artistic visuals than the norm and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, this is an anime that is absolutely perfect for one day out of every year. 

Happy Halloween!

I would say it's better to wait for the DVDs to come out, now that Bandai licensed it. My vote is for Escaflowne (Take it back to the 90s)

Can we wait a year or so before we make this anime of the month?  Everyone who wants to watch it just finished it.

i second this:
[K-On!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-ON!)

Third, i just started watching K-On! today.  So far it looks like it's going to be a good anime, and it must of gotten good reviews if it has a second season.
>> ARTICLE
Woah, I cant believe you havent seen tokyo godfathers, Grave of the fireflies, sword of the stranger, and 5cm/s second. (all movies)

Today, I will support Tokyo godfathers.

[Tokyo Godfathers](http://myanimelist.net/anime/759/Tokyo_Godfathers) : Comedy, Drama. Takes place during recent times, 2000 era. 3 Homeless people find an abandoned newborn baby on christmas eve. Find clues of who the baby may belong to, then they go on a journey to find the parents. Join this unattractive cast in an adventure you will not forget. This movie to me is a movie of spiritual growth, maturity, and making the most of what you have been given. 

There are not many facts I can find about this movie, but from what I can say, is it will be a classic. The late director, Satoshi kon, Director of movies such as Perfect blue, millennium actress, and paprika, truly makes you connected to our three grotesque main characters through this journey. [NSFW warning] Exposed breasts, not sexually driven. 

>> ARTICLE
I may have seen some of these movies and just don't recall, MAL is about 80-90% of what I've actually seen as I can not remember a lot of the stuff and quantity of such from the late 90's early 00's.  

That being said I will certainly add this to this weeks choices.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I totally based it off of your MAL LOL. but let me know if you haven't seen one of those listed, and I will defend it in honor of the thread. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I've seen Tokyo Godfathers but it's been so long I don't recall so it's worth a rewatch.  Same probably with Grave.  I don't recall Sword at all so that is probably new. I think I tried 5cm/s but found it too slow at the time to give it an honest attempt.
>> ARTICLE
Yea 5cm/s was pretty slow, I liked garden of words more than that because I felt it was paced better. I cant wait to see what you pick! have a good week of watching
>> ARTICLE
While I will support the suggestion from /u/LordTakuro, I'd like to propose a little movie for you! 

[The Princess and the Pilot](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9000/Toaru_Hikuushi_e_no_Tsuioku) is a 2011 Madhouse movie adaption of a novel by the same name. It's set in an alternate universe where two mighty empires are at war. The prince of one of these countries declares his love and marriage for a girl of high standing, promising to end the war within one year of their marriage. The problem is that this prince and princess-to-be, are separated by 12.000 kilometers of water, where the opposing forces lie in wait galore, and it's up to the titular pilot to carry this girl across said ocean. The movie is about their treacherous journey, with stunning scenery, solid soundtrack, quiet moments and explosive, well animated action scenes. It'll also only take a little over an hour and a half!
>> ARTICLE
The princess and the pilot is good romantic action movie that I remember enjoying when I found it on Crunchy Roll.  I'll add it to the list of choices this week.
>> ARTICLE
Hey there Delithia! I had a write up for you to watch Berserk ready last week, but it was movie week and I lost it [lol](/s ";-;")

Guess I'll just wing it.

My suggestion for you is to watch Berserk (original TV series)! (sidenote: Skip the first episode, and watch it after you finish the rest of the series). Berserk starts *in medias res* but never quite catches up to the events of the first episode. You will not miss anything, and only stand to have a better viewing experience if you skip episode 1. It may as well be full of spoilers because of how the adaptation works :p

(Note: Going to keep things vague in case you somehow don't know anything about the series c:)

In Berserk, we follow our protagonist Guts, a very strong mercenary who has no reason in life but to fight. He soon enough meets Griffith, and their fates from then on become intertwined. Berserk is set in a medieval-fantasy styled world and centres around themes of ambition, tragedy, and fate. I consider the storytelling, and journey of Guts to be amongst the pinnacle of what can be experienced in the medium.

One of my strongest fascinations with the TV series, is it's stunning OST. Composed by [Hirasawa Susumu](http://myanimelist.net/people/5750/Hirasawa_Susumu), the man who went on to compose for works such as Mousou Dairinin, Paprika and Millennium Actress. His composition encapsulates the overall tone and feeling of Berserk. Working perfectly to complement the mood and atmosphere the story conveys.

The only downside Berserk (TV series) has going for it, is that the art is quite old by todays standards (didn't effect my enjoyment, but I'm raising this issue incase it does for you). Thankfully, the animation is still quite good in fight scenes.

I have 2 cautions for Berserk:

- It can be brutal and grotesque as fuck.

- If you watch the anime, you may get hooked on continuing and reading the manga :p

As long as you are okay with these, I wholeheartedly recommend you watch it :)
>> ARTICLE
I could have sworn this show had more than 25 episodes.  I'll add it to the choices this week for certain.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly 25 episodes!

[](#yuruyuriapprove)

Yo, let me add [D-Frag!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20031/D-Frag!) to this. It's a fun, suprisingly hilarious series about a "delinquent" who's forced to join a club with a bunch of girls. You sort of have to turn you brain off a little bit, but if you do I promise you'll have a good time. 

Let me quote some random guy from reddit:
> If I'm comparing it to all the other pure comedies I've seen, it's a 10/10.

If it helps it's pretty much like [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf_tfInh8c) all the way through. Except sillier and also funnierererer. 

PS. Roka is best girl.
>> ARTICLE
I think after the serious Gundam marathon a light comedy is a welcome occurance.  It is on the list of choices this week.
>> ARTICLE
I will re-submit my suggestion for [Strike Witches](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3667/Strike_Witches). It's become one of my favorite shows on recommendation from another member of the subreddit. It features a solid story backed by an alternate-history-WWII setting, a large amount of cute girls (if that's something you enjoy), and some amazingly choreographed fight scenes. Couple that with solid animation and an amazing OST, with a great mix between calm, relaxing, SoL and some of the best hype tracks I've ever had the pleasure of hearing, and Strike Witches is a complete package. My only warning would be that the show is very fanservice heavy, so keep that in mind.

---------------------------

If that doesn't suit you, if you don't mind an older animation style, with it being the only one of the classic series that fits the time requirement, I'll give a strong recommendation to [Lupin the Third: Part I](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1412/Lupin_III). One of the all-time classics of anime, the show follows the master thief Arsene Lupin and his group of sometimes friends/sometimes rivals and their adventures looking to steal some of the world's greatest artifacts. The Lupin the Third franchise has deep roots in the anime medium, having spawned multiple series, movies, and becoming one of the most recognized faces in anime, and this was the anime series that started it all.
>> ARTICLE
Your going to torture me with the first parts of series now.  Also, I did not know that the very first Lupin aired in 1971.  Interesting.  I'll add these to the options this week.
>> ARTICLE
> First parts of series

As far as Lupin goes, it's not as big torture, since all the parts of the series are standalones and they're not really inter-connected.
>> ARTICLE
Good to know on Lupin.

I never thought to ask if you'd take rewatch suggestions too (I noticed on your MAL you've seen it), so this week, I'm here to talk about [Yuki Yuna is a Hero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25519/Yuuki_Yuuna_wa_Yuusha_de_Aru), and because I liked it so much, I'm going to use a quote from me in a thread last night.

"From the ground up, to me, the show is just a masterpiece on so many different levels. The writing is happy and cheerful in it's comedic parts and goddamn heartwrenching when it wants to be, the animation doesn't overdo itself and still manages to impress through a well-used knowledge of color balances and some beautiful animation in fight scenes and the Jukai, the story combines some of the best aspects from classic and modern magical girl anime into a loving amalgamation of the two, the characters are much more relatable than in a lot of shows I've seen and you really feel for them at every event in the show's course, The soundtrack is the kind that sometimes doesn't seem impressive at first, but gets stuck in your head until you notice more about it and realize it's masterfully composed, and don't even get me started on the voice cast: The casting choices were near perfect in both languages and I can't gush enough about the excellent choices in voice actors across languages."
>> ARTICLE
The reason I stopped pushing my MAL watched list is I was opening the doors to all anime including ones I've watch but not as a part of 50 Weeks of /r/Anime so I am accepting this suggestion for this week.  I just don't know how I'll deal with crying through a couple episodes of this show again.

>> ARTICLE
[:D](http://imgur.com/cRUnwKp) If you decide to do Yuki Yuna for this week, feel free to PM me if you want to discuss it during or after your rewatch!

Most certainly.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, everybody in here should watch [B Gata H Kei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7817/B_Gata_H_Kei). You want to know why? Well, let me tell you the synopsis. *Yamada is a girl who wants to have sex with 100 different partners* - Trust me, this isn't a hentai...still with me here? Okay - *but she's nervous about having her first time with somebody who isn't also a virgin too, because, like, what if he laughs at her or something? So she finds a guy, Kosuda - he's not exceptional, but she pegs him as a cherry boy and attempts to get into a relationship with him. She starts off on the wrong foot, but over time they end up becoming romantically interested in one another.* The rest of the twelve-episode series is entirely focused on their romance.

Despite the premise, this is not actually as much of an ecchi show as you might expect. I mean, it's there, but this is not one of those Rosario + Vampire situations. It's more like a low-key sex comedy. The show is mostly about Yamada and Kosuda just kinda making their relationship work. There are other girls involved, although it's not like a love triangle or anything. It's just humor stuff, with some actual romance in there too.

The animation and voice acting is pretty good. The show also has a great dub, so if you're into dubs then that's obviously a perk. Yamada is also a best. She's a little tsundere, but it's not like a super tsundere "baka Shinji" type of thing. It's pretty unusual to see a sex-obsessed girl in anime... if you like the girls from Seitokai Yakuindomo then that's another reason to get on board.

I loved this show. I binge-watched the whole thing in one sitting. It reminded me of being back in high school, and all *that* awkward sex shit. I did also really like how the show got into the minds of the main characters. We get to see what both of them are thinking, and even when they aren't on the same page we can see why they think what they think and understand why they do what they do next. There are no stupid romcom misunderstandings. Overall, I'd give this show my full recommendation. I can understand that the synopsis might be unusual for some people, but trust me when I say that it is worth the watch.
>> ARTICLE
I would also recommend this show to anyone who isn't afraid of a little sexual humor in their romance.  Also the female protagonist that is obsessed with sex is pretty drastically different from the norm.
>> ARTICLE
You. YES YOU. Watch [Gunbuster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/949/Top_wo_Nerae!_Gunbuster). Why? Because it is an awesome mecha work and has one of the best endings in anime, period. It has a strong female lead, well developed characters, a good story, what else could you possibly want?

It is the first work of Hideaki Anno, Neon Genesis Evangelion director. Just so you know.

Fair warning, the first episode is a parody to a sports show of the 70's and may put you off. But keep going, totally worth it.

Also, after Gunbuster, you can (and should) watch [Diebuster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1002/Top_wo_Nerae_2!_Diebuster) which only enhances the greatness. This is directed by Tsurumaki Kazuya who also directed FLCL, show you have as a 10.

With 6 episodes each, it is really worth it to give a watch to both of them.
>> ARTICLE
This is very tempting to watch.  I haven't caught a good mecha show in a while so maybe it's overdue.
>> ARTICLE
I'm back to throw out a recommendation for [Scryed](http://myanimelist.net/anime/168/Scryed), a solid action anime from Sunrise from the early 2000's and one of my favorite under-rated anime from when I was a kid. It's got super powers, a battle between essentially bandits with super powers and an order intending to suppress those people, and some really good animation. If you need any more convincing, here, have the OP, [Reckless Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciOpKslFsPE)

This reminds me of something I watched when I was younger.  If I can find it this week then it's on the list.

Hello Delithia!

I just wrote out a recommendation for Kannagi to someone in the megathread, so I figured I should forward it to you in hopes you'll watch it :)

[Kannagi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3958/Kannagi/) is an anime where character dynamic shines! It seems somewhat generic at first, and incorporates some harem elements, but is a really under-appreciated series. It has some very stand out qualities!

The VAs. Absolutely amazing VAs here, very stacked cast; KanaHana, Sawashiro Miyuki, Hiro Shimono, Haruka Tomatsu. They do their magic and bring the characters to life. Haruka Tomatsu *absolutely nails it* as Nagi by the way.

The characters and interactions. Nagi is the special stand out character that doesn't really fall into any trope, which is always nice to see. The interactions between our main cast members are absolutely hilarious. One of the funniest shows I have ever seen. Even the secondary characters are great.    
Without writing an essay, the characters and their interactions absolutely make the show :)

The art is also incredible, especially for a series that aired back in 2008. Great character design and animation too!

Also the [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2w_kpiW0Pw) is bliss :3

Also, there is a plot (kind of), but it isn't *that* important. It pops up every now and then.

I think I'll slowly start working on a WT! thread for it, since it doesn't have one, but is definitely worth your while to watch.

I hope you'll consider it :)
>> ARTICLE
This week is a strong week.  So very many titles that are very alluring.  The temptation is real.  Unfortunately this week hinges on shows that I can find easily.  Hope for the best but don't expect it this week.  Thanks again for the great write up.

>  Unfortunately this week hinges on shows that I can find easily.

Great! I hope you enjoy it when you get around to it!
>> ARTICLE
I'll spring for an underrated Madhouse title: [Dennou Coil](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2164/Dennou_Coil)'s immersive virtual world is delightful and sets the backdrop for a complex story that will fill you with every emotion from joy to sorrow. While its initial appeal seems to be geared toward children, it handles darker themes with maturity and grace that makes it a great watch for adults as well. =)
>> ARTICLE
This is the kind of show I jump at.  Something deep yet simple with a great theme.  If I an find it this week I'll put on the list.
>> ARTICLE
Im going to recommend the [Kara no Kyoukai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2593/Kara_no_Kyoukai_1:_Fukan_Fuukei) movies. First of all, if you like badass female characters then look no further. Ryougi Shiki is amazing, she's one of my favorite female characters along with Revy. The visuals look top notch even though the series started 8 years ago (based ufotable), and the show has one of the best [Soundtracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB_ltsS9w4c) out there done by Yuki Kajiura which adds significantly to the atmosphere. The subtleness of the earlier movies make the series that much more enjoyable when everything starts to tie together, and it has a satisfying ending.
>> ARTICLE
My first movie in this thread.  I'm excited yet I don't know If this will be the one this week.
>> ARTICLE
If not this week I'll try my best to make it the next :p
>> ARTICLE
I'll vote for Psycho-Pass season 1. It is very well written and has a very interesting premise. There's a system in place in Japan that can immediately quantify a persons state of mind and personality. The police use this system in their guns to judge criminals and people to either paralyze them and bring in for therapy or kill them. It follows a new inspector of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division and the unit that she's in. The system is far from perfect and you'll come to realize that as you watch it.
>> ARTICLE
This is one I'm certain I can find, Almost 100% so.  It does have the great sci-fi genre the I also love.
>> ARTICLE
Aww yiss, pretty sure it's on Netflix. But yeah, it's a really great series. Have fun if you are picking this one!
>> ARTICLE
\> tfw OP hasn't watched Kyousougiga yet.

Do you like Madoka Magica and FLCL? Shows with a lot of visual style and great soundtracks? Looking at your MAL, it seems like you do. How about Kekkai Sensen, made by the same director (with Kyousougiga being far superior, imo)? It seems like you do. It's pretty short at only 10 episodes long and available on Crunchyroll.

Here's the [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYDKDrQaJ9Q) and here's a well written [WT](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ykye6/wt_watch_this_kyousougiga_edition/) thread from /u/kaverik. You know, it's also a good time to watch it since there's a [rewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3in8om/rewatch_reminder_that_ranime_will_be_having_a/) starting on Sept. 1st (aka now).
>> ARTICLE
I've got a recommendation for [Golden Boy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/268/Golden_Boy). A short six-episode OVA series about a "student of life", Kintaro Ooe, as he travels across Japan and learns about the world. It's often considered one of the greatest ecchi anime of all time, with great comedy and a unique main character. The production values are also pretty good considering the time period. I think it's definitely worth a look, both for the fact that it's hilarious and for the fact that it's a snapshot into 90's-00's anime.
>> ARTICLE
Golden Boy is a classic of it's era.  Cheap exposed breast. Barely coherent plot. And over the top antics.  I really should have watched that by now.
>> ARTICLE
> Barely coherent plot

This is not actually true.
>> ARTICLE
I watched [Tsuritama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12883/Tsuritama) a month ago on a whim and man does it deserve more attention. It's a SOL about fishing, as simple as that. We have a group of four characters, all with their different personalities and backgrounds, just going out and fishing. The show really shines with these characters; while its easy to brand them archetype X, Y and Z, we see really see them branch out of their usual shells. The characters are quirky in a way that only anime can achieve, but the show does a good job in making you empathize with them. After a few episodes, you'll just smirk whenever you see them on screen, and feel as happy as they are when they're all together. Through only 12 episodes, the characters grow into completely new people, and leave you with a smile at the end of each episode. I don't usually like SOL's but this one definitely got to me. It's definitely a feel-good show that I recommend to anyone.

Some other things: the color palette they use for the show is absolutely gorgeous, using pastel colors that really bring out the blues and reds (you can see it in the trailer I linked). While there is a silly over-arching plot, you forgive it because the characters are so darn likable. The OP is a fun one that only gets better with each episode. If you really like relationship building, then you'll definitely enjoy this one.

[Here's the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQBw_XrZWkw) 

[And here's the Crunchyroll link.](http://www.crunchyroll.com/tsuritama)

Happy fishing! DUH-KU! :)
>> ARTICLE
A fishing SOL.  I really should not be surprised.  I'll add it to the choices this week.
>> ARTICLE
IMO, the second season was even better than the first :p. Hopefully you can get around to it whenever you have the time!  

Anyway, my rec for this week is [Haibane Renmei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei). It's a fantasy SoL with a similar feel to So Ra No Wo To which I noticed you gave a pretty high score to on your MAL. If you enjoyed the top notch world building and incredible [OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCgQZFMG3Mg) in Sora no Woto you'll probably enjoy this as well. Haibane Renmei] is a bit darker, more thought provoking, and incredibly dreamlike. It's a masterpiece of an anime, but it's pretty slow so there aren't many people I'd recommend it to with all the shounen lovers on this sub. 
>> ARTICLE
Haibane Renmei is one of those shows that nag at me with a sense of familiarity that I can't shrug off with any dose of logic.  I don't know if it's just how desolate those year were for me to watch new anime or if it's legitimately something I have seen.

Anyway, I'll add it to the list of choices this week.

Maybe I should do a sequels week.  Limit it to shows that you guys had me watch just season one of.
>> ARTICLE
I think a sequels week would be fun! About Haibane Renmei, I can't imagine it feeling familiar to you if you haven't watched it yet. I think it was pretty unique 
>> ARTICLE
Apparently the setting of Haibane Renmei was inspired by Murakami's [*Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard-Boiled_Wonderland_and_the_End_of_the_World), so if you've read that it could be the reason why it seems familiar.
>> ARTICLE
I do read a bit but haven't read that.  I can't figure out it but oh well.
>> ARTICLE
Once again, I'll say Sword of the Stranger. It's an amazing movie with some of the best fight animation and choreography out there. 
>> ARTICLE
I really meant to get that one done last week.  Blame the internet.  I'll add it to the choices this week and hopefully get it done.

This is the first time you've been here Bot-chan.  I might need to talk to your masters about this misconception.
>> ARTICLE
Bot-chan has been broken lately
>> ARTICLE
I think she has a grudge against me.  I may or may not down-vote her on sight.
>> ARTICLE
I have a grudge against you for not watching Berserk _
>> ARTICLE
I think it's you and another guy who keeps getting banned from around here.  As much as I try I can't watch everything.
>> ARTICLE
> keeps getting banned

Eh?

Yeah I know, well my suggestion is the same as last week :)
>> ARTICLE
Got it!

>> ARTICLE
I notice you never watched the 2nd cour of Black Lagoon. I guess they took the summer off giving a little break but I never thought of them as separate. That said, I think many consider the second half to be a bit better than the first. Not much I can do to try to sell you on this though since you're already familiar with it.

It looks like my favorite show that you haven't seen might be Hyouka. It's a slice of life where they solve rather mundane mysteries but manages to make them interesting with great characters (and animation). [Maybe I'll try to let Chitanda convince you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0rm2pFLp2k).
>> ARTICLE
I might have just been lazy/confused and not put both cours for Black Lagoon on there.  I'm pretty sure I've watched both and wanted more.

I'll put this on the list of options this week thou.
>> ARTICLE
You should watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. The first season is 26 episodes long, and doesn't end on a cliffhanger.

It's a manga that is legendary in Japan, with influence spreading throughout anime and manga. Without even knowing it, I'm sure you've seen tons and tons of JoJo references. And once you watch it, you can't help but smile every time a reference comes up in another show.

It's the story of a bloodline battling against whatever evil rears its ugly head as each JoJo uses their own unique abilities to fight it.

If you want a show full of cool action, unique abilities, lovable characters, and some great comedy, you should definitely watch JoJo.
>> ARTICLE
JoJo's is amazing.  Everyone Should watch the whole thing even if it's long as each season is unique and equally awesome.  I'm certainly glad that I think the are animating the 4th arc or so I heard rumored.

Anyway, this is on the list of choices this week.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, you've already seen it. That's what I get for not looking at your MAL.

Yes, Part 4 has already been announced. Studio/staff have not been announced yet, but there will be more information coming in the next issue of Ultra Jump which will be on the 19th.
>> ARTICLE
I have no problem rewatching stuff as a part of this.  It's meant to be a community celebration of what we all enjoy.  It's why I've stopped linking MyAnimeList in the post themselves.

I hope the same studio picks it up as they did a superb job on the previous arcs.
>> ARTICLE
I hope so as well. David Production has a Monster Hunter anime in the works right now, and the JoJo director is doing the Drifters adaptation, but hopefully they'll be able to do it afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm...  Looks like you haven't seen my favorite anime yet.

[Seirei no Moribito](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1827/Seirei_no_Moribito)

*Moribito* boasts one of the best examples of a [strong female lead](http://i.imgur.com/YHV4X0S.jpg) in any medium, especially anime, and without sexualization, to boot.  It also features second-to-none worldbuilding for a series of its length (26 episodes), with significant effort to make the cultures of its fantasy setting feel true-to-life, with legends, lore and even [folk songs.](https://youtu.be/bK9cSX-peE4)  The character designs are evocative of occupation and social class, from [shaman](http://i.imgur.com/yJbQ9PE.jpg) to [street kid](http://i.imgur.com/dvQfAUQ.jpg) and [assassins](http://i.imgur.com/FeI8rRP.jpg) to [archpriest.](http://i.imgur.com/15sIqsZ.jpg)  Throw in some [gorgeous scenery,](http://i.imgur.com/PMg9cq4.jpg) a few of the best-choreographed [fight scenes](http://i.imgur.com/ltkZh0g.gifv) this side of *Sword of the Stranger,* and top it off with a complete, emotionally satisfying story and you have what I consider to be a true anime masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds pretty good, I'll add it to the list of choices this week.
>> ARTICLE
Ooh you went with Love Story. How was it without watching the prequel?
>> ARTICLE
I feel unattached to a couple of characters and confused on some plot stuff.  Like that talking bird.  I'm guessing he was more than Jar Jar Binks. 

 But aside from all that it was nice to see someone get past the whole I don't know what I'm too afraid to confess my feeling phase that we joke about being the whole point of some shows.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's reasonable. He is a bit more than a gag character, and lots of people find themselves liking him or hating him.

Love Story is pretty solid romantically, it's an adorable little film \^.^
>> ARTICLE
Meh. I've posted bigger tables than this. [*Much* bigger.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3nhm6m/spoilersrewatch_legend_of_the_galactic_heroes/) 
>> ARTICLE
Formatting on those had to be *fun*.
>> ARTICLE
It's actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it. I was able to get the second half of it formatted and filled out in about 30 minutes all in one big shot.
>> ARTICLE
And here I'm glad I saved the formatting in a text doc.
>> ARTICLE
Well, if you start to run against the character limit, the easiest way to give you some extra room is to shorten the MAL links. Both http://myanimelist.net/anime/21039/Gatchaman_Crowds_Insight and http://myanimelist.net/anime/21039/ go to the same page, so that can seriously trim down on the bloat in the code.

Also, too: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3t2m0e/50_weeks_of_ranime_week_21/ is the same as https://redd.it/3t2m0e.

You left me alone last week Bot-Chan.  I'm thinking this is just harassment.

I mean he is right, you technically are asking for suggestions. Don't hate Bot-chan

My issue is that Bot-chan has only posted this on less than 10% of these post.  I don't really view this as asking for a suggestion thread.  I try to make it more about being a community activity.

He?! **He?!** Bot-chan is a goddess, you take that back right now!

At this point I may or may not be convinced that Bot-chan is a trap or reverse trap.

I'm suggesting [Katanagatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6594/Katanagatari)  because of the beautiful artwork, [the incredible sword fights and choreography](http://i.imgur.com/1l8vb2m.gif) and because it has one of the few perfect endings existing in anime.

Also it has the best sword fight ever

Aria the animation, as nothing is more relaxing then watching Gondola operators on an alien planet where the city is almost a clone of Venice, Italy.  
>> ARTICLE
[Nagi no Asukara](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16067/Nagi_no_Asukara), one of the most beautiful settings out there with a great fantasy story to go with it. [See this recent album that was posted today](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3escp3/new_week_new_album_heres_my_collection_of_images/)
>> ARTICLE
>must be less than 26 episodes

Chihayafuru's 25 episodes

[](#kukuku)

but seriously, you're doing yourself a disservice by not having watched this show yet. The synopsis sucks, so I'll do my best at selling it.

So you got this really hot girl at your highschool right? BUT she has a bit of a reputation for being an airhead. 

"That's alright by me" you think to yourself. Then you hear that she has a model as her sister. 

*Score, so good looks must run in the family* , you think to yourself

So you find a conveient excuse to run into her after school and you hit it off. She invites you to go some place you never heard of before. 

So you tag along and you realize it's a community centre. Definitely not what you would expect a highschool girl to go after classright?

Then you hear a flurry of thumping followed by an eerie silence. *What the hell's going on here?*

You open the door to the room and you realize that everybody there's playing karuta. Yeah, that lame card game with the listening that you had to play back in elementary school. But this chick's super excited for some reason.

She takes her spot in a match and leaves you alone. At this point, you've pretty much given up on her, because it's pretty obvious that her whole concentration is going into this.

*Well, everybody has hobbies right? So what, this isn't a complete dealbreaker*

Then, you catch a glimpse of the school's hottest guy who comes in the room. Yeah, that's right, the guy who could get any girl he wants at a snap of his fingers.

*Wait... is he?... no, he can't possibly...he went straight to my prey and ignored me?*

Your indignation knows no bounds and you stomp out, making sure to create a fuss as you leave and slamming the door, at which point both the girl and the hot guy both tell you to shut up. 

*Shit, they're actually serious about this*

And hence Chihayafuru is the story of an airheaded, competetive girl who loves karuta and her journey in the land of competetive karuta. I won't presume that you'll react the same way as me, but this show had  a profound emotional impact on me and got me very invested in the characters and their stories. I would honestly be elated and jump around the room if they had a victory, and would genuinely feel sad/cry if they suffered a setback. 

I would definitely recommend.

(PS. Sorry for my writing style. I'm not used to writing like this, or even writing long pieces in general)
>> ARTICLE
You got me. The second season is a seperately listing. Don't know how I feel about this. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I would say that you could watch only the first season. 

In any case, if you want me to play by fairer rules, I can do one for another show if I have enough motivation.
>> ARTICLE
I'll accept it as an entrant because it's a high effort post.  It's making it hard to pick a show this week as well.
>> ARTICLE
[Trigun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun). 17 years since its initial release that helped bring anime into the pop culture into Western society along with Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star, and it's still held up as one of the great classics from the 90s. Follow the widely loved main character Vash the Stampede on his adventures on the planet Gun Smoke, as he is hunted by every person on the planet to get the $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head dead or alive for turning cities into nothing but ruble. The odd thing though is the man himself, who is completely nuts and silly, lives by the rules to not kill a single life, and always a very happy person, nothing like the rumors have been told. A great representation that even when the animation may have not aged well, the side characters, the story, the western like atmosphere, and Vash himself can still keep the anime going for an overall great experience as you delve more into the mysterious man known as Vash the Stampede.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend [Tasogare Otome x Amnesia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12445/Tasogare_Otome_x_Amnesia) just by the fact of how well drawn and atmospheric it is. I felt that the horror was done really well, effectively blending light comedy, calm, and dread together.
>> ARTICLE
I will recommend a series that r/anime does not know the existence of. Or well that's how i feel about it.  

Uchuu Kyoudai aka Space Brothers is a series about 2 brothers having a dream of going to the moon together. Packed with trials and tribulations, heartwarming moments and saddening scenario's. An anime about following your dream, not giving up and working hard. It will put a smile on your face.  


>> ARTICLE
You are right, I don't think I've really heard anyone talk about Space Brothers in /r/Anime.  I'll add it to the choices this week.
>> ARTICLE
Looking for a compelling geopolitical story that is set ~300 years into our future? Want a series that does a multi faction look where you see multiple sides of a conflict and see their own invested interests and motivations? Interested in seeing some really cool mechas that are incredibly [well animated with a solid OST and sound effects](https://d.maxfile.ro/gmibexayes.webm)? How about a series that doesn't mind taking a look at some of the darker sides of war such as[ child soldiers](http://b.1339.cf/morclbz.webm), conflict caused by political interest, human experimentation and terrorism?

Watch [Gundam 00](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2581/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_00). It has a solid storyline with excellent world building, characters and also has extremely high production values both in it's visuals and audio. 

Since you've already see Gundam Wing, 00 has a lot of similarities with it, but it executes them a lot better. If you like stories driven by politics and themes involving war and it's many aspects, the premise alone should pique your interest:

> It is the year A.D. 2307. Fossil fuels on Earth have been depleted entirely, with mankind turning to the next available power source: solar energy. During this time, 3 orbital elevators with solar power generation systems are built, each under control by the Union (formerly United States of America), the Human Reformist Alliance (Russia, China and India) and the AEU (Europe); however, not all countries are able to enjoy the benefits of this system, leading to widespread resentment and war. Arising out of the conflict, a mysterious non-profit military organization known as Celestial Being appears, dedicated to end all warfare using Mobile Suits called Gundam. This begins the stories of Gundam Meisters (pilots) Setsuna F. Seiei, Lockon Stratos, Allelujah Haptism and Tieria Erde as they are thrown into conflict between the 3 superpowers and the other various factions.


 
>> ARTICLE
50 episodes and a movie in a well established mecha franchise.  I'll definitely add it to the choices this week.
>> ARTICLE
Does it count if I say Strike Witches (the full series)? There's two seasons, a movie, and a three-episode OVA and it's a series I just watched recently that became one of my new favorites.

There's a lot of fanservice, mind you, but the characters are all really fun and each likable in their own way, the interactions between all the different characters are great and there's a sense that each character really is connected through interactions with multiple members of the wide cast, the story is a solid alternate history-magic-fantasyish take on a World War II setting with aliens and cute girls with plane legs, the soundtrack is really solid, and there are some absolutely amazing hype moments (Like, I honestly felt some of them were Gurren Lagann levels of hype). Plus, it has Miyuki Sawashiro, and I do love Sawashiro.

--------------------

**Choice #2**: How's about [Kekkaishi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1606/Kekkaishi)? Featuring well-known voice-acting names in both languages (with Vic Mignogna voicing the lead in English, Kekkaishi is an under-mentioned work from Sunrise that I always loved when I was younger. It takes the idea of "high schoolers with magic powers" and shapes it into a way wherein those high schoolers actually serve to protect the grounds of a school from the various demons that all seem to gravitate towards it. While early episodes take on a monster-of-the-week format, a central story arc begins to develop and there are some absolutely amazing fight scenes with really good animation, as to be expected from Sunrise. The animation is good, the soundtrack (especially the OP) is catchy, and it gets a big recommendation from me.
>> ARTICLE
After your update I'll put both of them as choices to start this week.
>> ARTICLE
I also realized I missed Week 14 and that you chose Samurai Champloo for Week 13, glad to hear you liked it!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that was definitely a fun watch.
>> ARTICLE
Yes Strike Witches counts.  I'm not averse to fan service so I won't hold it against you.  
>> ARTICLE
Okay! I also included a second option if that sounds more to your liking, hope you enjoy whatever you choose! (If you choose Strike Witches, I'd say definitely message me if you want to talk about the series while you watch. I've finished that a lot more recently than the other)
>> ARTICLE
Do Hellsing Ultimate.

Its so good.
>> ARTICLE
Can you talk about it a little more than just, its so good.  What makes it so good?
>> ARTICLE
Nazi.

Vampires.

Plus Alucard is the ultimate BAMF.
>> ARTICLE
You seem to have enjoyed both FLCL and Uchouten Kazoku a lot, so I'd recommend watching [Kyousougiga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_%28TV%29) (10 episodes). Stylistically and presentation-wise it reminds a lot of FLCL, but thematically it's a lot closer to Uchouten Kazoku (though with a magical Kyoto as the setting, there's plenty other similarities to be seen). Beautiful little show about the story of a family, with some fantastic characters. And that's "beautiful" in an audiovisual sense as well, [Matsumoto Rie](http://myanimelist.net/people/12664/Matsumoto_Rie), who you may know as the director of Kekkai Sensen, does a spectacular work at bringing the world to life in an energetic and visually interesting way. It's just good. Watch it.
>> ARTICLE
I was going to recommend this too but just cause I saw it recently and thought it was really interesting
>> ARTICLE
I believe this is not your first attempt at getting this show on here.  I hope this is the week for you but it can get crowded on here.
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember ever posting in these threads before, but looking through the old entries it seems other people have recommended it before, with rather similar arguments and comparisons. Sounds like you really should just get to it already :D
>> ARTICLE
That does seem to be a consensus on this show then and with only 10 episodes maybe this will be a week with a bonus show.
>> ARTICLE
[Another victory for the Hero Club!](http://imgur.com/7663h1t) Glad to hear you enjoyed the re-watch, it's definitely one I think has a lot of value to a rewatch, noticing little things you missed before along the way.

Interestingly, I noticed that you have the Rebuilds on your Completed, but not the original [Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion). If you haven't seen that, I'd definitely throw it in as this week's recommendation.

If you have, then, I've got a personal pick for an airing: [Wakaba*Girl](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30355/Wakaba*Girl)! It's a currently-airing short that's up to Episode 11 this week. At only 7 minutes per episode, it's a series that could easily be caught up on in a little over an hour, and it's a cute, happy, fun SoL fix of moe goodness each week.
>> ARTICLE
I am keeping up with Wakaba Girl! and it's pretty good.  I wish you'd sell Evangelion a little better so could count it in this weeks choices to watch.  Of course I despise Shinji for the whiny teenager trope he represents.
>> ARTICLE
I can try, though it's been a couple years since I've seen Evangelion.

It's one of the eternal classics of the psychological (and slightly lesser so, mech) genre for it's look into the depths of the human psyche. Each and every character in the show is fucked up in the head for one reason or another, and the show does a really good job at digging into the characters' brains and figuring out why they have these mental, personal, or psychological issues, while at the same time examining the human psyche as a whole. Shinji, while being a whiny teenager, depicts how most boys his age would likely react when faced with a defend-the-world and put your life at risk situation. As opposed to many other MCs of the mech genre, where teenagers jump at the opportunity to go out and fight, Shinji is reluctant and scared to fight, because, just as much as any other person, he doesn't want to die. The show tackles a lot of mental and psychological issues, such as abandonment, loss of loved ones, and also, of course, the fragility of a person's self-esteem and resolve.

I hope this did a slightly better job of selling it, though I felt like I repeated myself a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Wonderful job.  Let's see if it beats out our other contestants.
>> ARTICLE
Ooh you watched Kannagi, good on ya mate! :D

The username mention didn't work 1 week ago so I didn't notice until now ;-;
>> ARTICLE
The username mention only works if your gilded.  If I recall correctly.
>> ARTICLE
Nah they changed that months ago, it works for everyone now.. Or at least is suppose to. Sometimes it doesn't :p
>> ARTICLE
It only works in comments, not posts, and not if there are 5+ mentions in the comment.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, thank you. I assumed the post one because I didn't get the link. I didn't know of the 5+ mentions.

Cheers :)
>> ARTICLE
(rewritten after looking your MAL)

**Kitakubu Katsudou Kiroku**: A gag anime filled with 4-wall jokes, decostruction of tropes, strange characters and moe sugar. It's something weird but that will make you laught at every scene.

Second suggestion:
**Seitokai Yakuindomo**: Another gag anime, filled with sexual jokes, solid characters, a male in a full woman school without harems, and strange scenes.

Bonus: 
**Shinigami no Ballad**: A short (6 eps) anime dealing with feels and death. And with the more adorable shinigami (dead god messanger) that you can dream.
>> ARTICLE
I do enjoy a good comedy so getting some good laughs this week would be enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to recommend my favorite show since it seems you haven't seen it.

[White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2)

13ish episode anime about a guy trying to restart his band after losing most of the members.

*Pros*

* One of the best OSTs you will ever hear

* Beautiful animation/art

* Realistic take on a love story and progressive relationships

* Has best girl of all anime in it

*Possible Cons*

* This show is a feels trip. If you don't like shows that get you super emotionally attached to characters then you might not enjoy it.

* Only 13 episodes so its pretty short and you will definitely want more.


edit- This anime is pretty short and to the point so I don't really want to give more of the plot away in this suggestion. 
>> ARTICLE
I could have sworn this show had a second season or desperately needed one.  I can't recall.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't. The source material has a "part 2" but its after a time skip and the anime can serve as an ending point to the series if you don't like reading source material. There is also a well written summary of the part 2 floating around this sub if you are just curious what happens after the time skip.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, Happy cake day!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks didn't even realize!
>> ARTICLE
YES! [:D](http://imgur.com/cRUnwKp) The Hidamari wins out! it's a personal favorite of mine and one of the first shows I watched when I was getting back into anime about a year ago. It's a nice, cute little SoL that serves as a great little relaxing show.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely relaxing, It would work great after some of the feel trains a few of the shows this season are turning into.
>> ARTICLE
I recommend you watch [Rahxephon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/165/RahXephon). This anime will show you what the word "underrated" *truly* means.

This anime features a 17 year old named Ayato Kamina. In 2015, Tokyo is attacked by invaders  and they are taken out with a humanoid weapon known as a dolem.

Then a little later he is attacked by government officials only to be saved by a mysterious woman from an organization called Terra

 I could just give you synopsis but I'm not gonna do that.

It features a lot of the same components as another popular psychological mecha series but *this one* wins in the emotion department. 

I didn't expect to like this anime as much as I did, but I did. The characters were well fleshed out, it was chock full of symbolism, it had some action, romance *and* the necessary amount of feels.

Also, the ending was one of my favorites of any anime that I have ever watched. This anime doesn't get nearly as mush love as it deserves, in my opinion, so I really recommend you give it a shot.

>> ARTICLE
This is a compelling write up.  Thank you, it might just get the shot you want.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely watch Redline. Some of the greatest animation I've ever seen anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
Redline is fantastic, bright and dark, colorful and vibrant.  I'll add this to the list of choices this week. 
>> ARTICLE
So how's 00 so far? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm enjoying it.  Definitely worth the price of admission.
>> ARTICLE
Are you Gundam yet? Also be sure to hang around the 00 rewatch going on if you'd like, thread should be up in half an hour or so
>> ARTICLE
I am both and neither a Gundam yet.  I've never really participated in a rewatch even if it coincided with a show I am watching.  It happened when I was re-watching Yuki Yuna is a Hero for this.  My pacing doesn't follow the threads and not many people appreciate my opinions.
>> ARTICLE
Oh i don't mean follow the rewatch schedule, I was just mentioning that it exists so you can see what others think of it as they watch for the first time. 
>> ARTICLE
[Hal](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16528/Hal)  
Since you didn't start watching Uchuu Kyoudai i'm kind of sad but okay!  

Why watch Hal? I will say one thing, it is not what it seems to be.
>> ARTICLE
I suspect your goal is to make me cry in some fashion, that being said I'll add it to the list of choices this week.
>> ARTICLE
Going to suggest *Perfect Blue*. It's directed by Satoshi Kon, one of Japan's finest (you've rated *Paprika* a 9, which is made by him), and it's quite the mindfuck. The movie blends reality and imagination through clever editing techniques, showing a decline in the mental state of the MC, and it's often tough to tell what is actually real. It's a very psychological movie and a visceral experience, with several disturbing moments and a very tense atmosphere to amplify those moments. It shows the fascination of idol culture in Japan, how people in that position deal with the fame, what some people might do to make it big, and how obsessive some people can be over these people and their lives. 

I won't go into any more detail than that, but I legitimately think this movie is the most well directed anime movie I've seen, and it's up there with some of my favourite western movies. I thought it was one of, if not the best, thrillers I've seen, and the only anime movie that I'd call an "easy" 10/10.

Also, if you've seen/liked *Requiem for a Dream* or *Black Swan*, *Perfect Blue* has either had a direct influence on those movies or some scenes are essentially copy-pasted into them. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a sucker for Aidoru or Idol anime.  I'm surprised I haven't caved in to forgo rent and expand my collection there.  That being said I'll add this to the choices this week.
>> ARTICLE
I don't have a movie to recommend as you have seen Patema (and rated it 10 :p), so can I just recommend Berserk for next week? :3
>> ARTICLE
The only think I was taking advanced recommendations for was this last special.  I'll probably do it again but not for a few months.  I try to post this weekly on Monday about 4:30 PM Eastern US so try to catch me next week..

The Second Kyoukai no Kanata movie came out this week, So i'm gonna reccomend that and the first one to go along with it!

The first movie is a recap so if you've seen the series you can skip it but I managed to watch the second one last night and it just has what I feel is a veryvery good conclusion to the series as a whole! 

plus blackhaired Mirai is best Mirai. 
>> ARTICLE
If that is the movie I think it is I had the intention to watch it soon.  I'll add it to the list of choices this week.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I should have been more specific! It's [Kyoukai no Kanata: I'll be here - Mirai-hen](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28675/Kyoukai_no_Kanata_Movie:_Ill_Be_Here_-_Mirai-hen)
