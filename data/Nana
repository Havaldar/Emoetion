Im so excited for everyone who gets to experience Nana for the first time. The iconic *"Hey Nana"* still gives me goosebumps, even to this day. Youre in for quite the treat!  

Fair warning though, its not like everything else in the genre. Its mature and realistic. Its characters arent just plastic fantastic tropes and theres some brilliant characterization that further enhances the flavour. Theres some fantastic social commentary too, thats intertwined with a touch(quite the bit actually) of drama, that makes for an interesting contrast. Its not a light show by any means and it can be overwhelming at times, but in the end, its definitely worth your while if you can manage to stick through it.  

That aside, I do have to say, Madhouse have done a brilliant job with this adaptation. The art-style takes a little getting used to but they nail a lot of key elements on the head. There are so many subtle details that youll only learn to appreciate as you watch the series over, which I hope you do! Plus the voice actors on either side do a great job at portraying the raw emotion that is ever so relevant with romance and drama.  

I look forward to watching the rest, hopefully with episode notes, and to potentially seeing your reactions to the events that are yet to unfold! :D

First time Nana watcher here.


You've sold it.

Glad to have you on board! Hope you enjoy it as much as I have! :)

/u/birdmocksking so this is happening! :D
>> ARTICLE
About to hulk out and flip my car because I am so excited for this re-watch! 

Definetly joining in. 


>> ARTICLE
This is a first watch for me, and I'm looking forward to it!  I can already detect the thick shoujo in this, which for me has pretty much always been a good sign, of, as you say, maturity and realism.
>> ARTICLE
It's more Josei than Shoujo, if I'm honest. But yeah! I hope you enjoy it as much as I have! :D
>> ARTICLE
Heh, I'm not sure I've ever detected a consistent josei art style (not surprising seeing the shameful lack of it in anime generally!).  But just going by the MAL tags and the visuals, so far it does scream "shoujo" to me.  Which, as I say, has a great track record with me!

And thanks!  :D

> not surprising seeing the shameful lack of it in anime generally!  

it's the bane of my existence, that. *sigh*

**'Hey, Nana. Do you remember the first time we met?'**

And so starts our re-watch of one of the most realistic romance anime in existence; at the very least it's the most realistic one I've seen so far. Buckle up, because this will be a long, eventful ride.

I put emphasis on the 'most realistic' part, because as far as 'best' goes, things get a little more subjective. Don't get me wrong, Nana is, to me, the best romance I've ever seen as well, but that may not be the case for others who prefer more lighthearted, heartwarming stories.

But what cannot be denied and has never been in any doubt amongst the people who have seen it, is that Nana is very true to life, painfully so. Contrasting to your average high-school romcom or harem, Nana is devoid of archetypes and most tropes, as well as the typical situations we've come to know as staples of the romcom genre, for better or for worse. 

But why am I saying this? Seriously, I'm asking that to myself: you're all here to watch the show with me, so this should become clear on its own. Instead, let's just dive in. 

The pilot starts off with an address from one Nana to the other. First time watchers, get used to this, because it will be used more often. I always particularly loved those moments: instead of being circumventive in the narration, this direct approach adds a layer of intimacy that really conveys how deep the relationship between our two Nana's gets. 

But I digress. The pilot episode is really good as far as pilots go. We've been introduced to the basic premise and the direct backstory, as well as a significant part of the main cast. But mostly, this is an introduction to Nana and Nana.

Yeah, this will get confusing, so let's add in their last names. 

**Nana Komatsu** is the type of girl you've met at least a dozen times, although in my case it would be closer to fifty. She's outgoing, cheerful, self-absorbed, shallow, a tad melodramatic and easily impressed. But most of all, more than anything else, she is naive. In many ways she is still a child, unaware of and unprepared for what the world has in store for her. That will change and to be honest I was a little surprised by how different she is here from the image I had of her in my mind, which is a testament to the development we will see from her. 

**Nana Osaki** is... it's hard to describe her, doubly so since I haven't ever met someone like her. She's very reserved, to the point that she might come across as aloof, but she's also assertive, confident and surprisingly warm and affectionate. Contrasting her soon-to-be roommate, she is more world-weary and is very in control of herself. I wasn't as surprised with her personality here as I was with her counterpart, but she is more reserved than I remember her being, which is also again a testament, *bla bla bla*.

Anyway, although this is not a yuri anime (complaints can be filed with Demolition D+), there is no doubt that the relationship between Nana and Nana (don't worry, we'll soon have an easier way to discern one from the other) is in many, many ways the OTP of the show. Through fate, sheer luck or otherwise, the two make a connection, one that grows into something that can be described as soulmates. 

Instead of immediately exploring that relationship, the show chooses a different, slightly confusing approach. In order to understand Nana^2 to their fullest, the show will lay out almost all of the cards of their past in the coming episodes, so we won't be encumbered with disrupting flashbacks when things start to pick up momentum. Bear with it, though I think it's interesting enough of itself, since the payoff will be there tenfold. 

I'll be doing these write-ups hopefully every episode, though not nearly as long as this one, as I don't think anyone has the time or will to slog through as much as this every day, but since I previously did write-ups and analysis for the Cowboy Bebop re-watch and I enjoyed that more than I thought I would, I will be giving it another go. 

Anyway, a big thanks to /u/Are_you_daft for organizing the re-watch, I hope it will add more appreciation for one of my favorite shows.  
>> ARTICLE
I look forward to your write ups! Just started the first episode today and was pleasantly surprised by it as I kind of had to force myself into watch it as I don't often watch the more realistic and modern animes. Ready for the ride
>> ARTICLE
I didn't know this was being put together so I'm currently at episode 32, but I'll be coming to these threads to see what you have to say.  Nana makes me think I *could* read an essay a day for this show.
>> ARTICLE
I look forward to your write-ups! I quite enjoyed the ones on the Cowboy Bebop threads. I didn't have the time to contribute then, but hopefully this time it'll be different! :D

> most realistic

The amount of times I've seen realistic used for this series haha not sure if I've seen a "realistic" anime yet so it should be interesting

>  but that may not be the case for others who prefer more lighthearted, heartwarming stories.

ME! :D

> But what cannot be denied and has never been in any doubt amongst the people who have seen it, is that Nana is very true to life, painfully so.

We'll see about that haha should be a very interesting ride ha
>> ARTICLE
Nana's biggest draw is that it pulls no punches. We'll see how deep the beautiful side of love can be, but we'll also see how hideously ugly it can be, or even worse, can become. 

So the realistic part is that we'll see both sides of the coin, the true and the false, the pain and the joy, the beginning and the end. 

But yeah, it will be an interesting ride, it sure was when I first watched it :D
>> ARTICLE
I have watched NANA 3 times so far, and every time I have watched the sub, so this time I've decided to watch the dub. It should be fun!

**URGENT EDIT:**

I am watching the dub this time around on Hulu, but I believe they have made a mistake with the first episode. What they have labelled as "Episode 1" is actually Episode 6, the expanded, post-flashback version of the prologue. As I mentioned in the OP, episodes 6+7 return to the prologue to give a more detailed introduction, **but it does so by splitting the content over the course of two episode**, meaning **what Hulu has listed as episode 1 dub is incomplete** relative to what you should see. As such **I recommend all dub watchers on Hulu watch Episode 1 subbed to get the full story**. I have checked the Hulu subs and it looks like they are labelled correctly. Sorry for the confusion!
>> ARTICLE
Hi guys I havent really branched out on the romance genre and I would like to know if NANA is good as my first romance anime
>> ARTICLE
Uh, that's difficult to say.

I got spoiled by Nana (at least I watched it really late) in terms of realismus. I simply can't watch romance anymore. Nana is real, authentic, no forced drama, really good writing, really good characters and and and, it's just a masterpice for me.

Now, if you are new to romance, Nana can go either way: You won't watch other romance or you want more. I hope you won't get spoiled like I did.
>> ARTICLE
Guess I will take the risk
>> ARTICLE
>  I simply can't watch romance anymore. 

That's so sad, I would hate for that to happen to me
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it since I'm a first time watcher but I'd say it depends what you expect out of a romance!
>> ARTICLE
It's very good as your first romance anime. The only bad thing about it is that there is no definitive conclusion.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched nana twice and the end still leaves me dead inside. I can't watch it again, I do hope everyone watches it at least once it's amazing. I just can't handle way in which they left it. 

Still one of my top 5 anime romances. 
>> ARTICLE
Things like this are why I've kept putting off watching Nana.

But I've go you guys with me now so I think I'll be okay.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah take solace that no matter how it ends no body watches it and says that disliked it. And when you finish it, you can come in for warm hugs here. =) 
>> ARTICLE
I may not be mature enough. :)
>> ARTICLE
Man I want to read the manga so badly but I'm avoiding it because who knows if we'll get another chapter. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh that's actually a pretty tough question. I really want to say yes because of how fantastic the series is, but it is important to know that NANA is completely unlike any other romance anime. As you may or may not know, anime genres tend to have a lot of tropes and cliches and the strength of NANA as a show is how it avoids all of it in favor of a realistic portrayal of relationships that are not always ideal. Some people might not want that, while others like the show solely because of that. It's really up to you to decide, but I suggest you at least giving it a try up to around episode 14. If you can't stand the show at that point, chances are you'll dislike the rest of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Dont know but probably gonna join the rewatfh then.Thanks a bunch
>> ARTICLE
Well damn, with the Chihayafuru rewatch and Ore Monogatari airing and now this, there are currently discussion threads for three anime directed by Morio Asaka and character designs by Kunihiko Hamada. 
>> ARTICLE
That's interesting. I usually don't care for development staff, but could you explain to me how Kunihiko Hamada is credited for character design when the characters are all based on Ai Yazawa's manga?
>> ARTICLE
I am not really well versed in the roles of the character designer myself but I think it's a bit more then just coming up with what they should look like. I believe they have to check the key animations to make sure that there is consistency in everyone drawing of the characters.   

Also the character design in the manga is not always directly transferable to anime, because the manga characters might be too detailed which just wont work in anime. So the character designer might have to simplify the character while keeping the essence of the character. 

Edit:[ here is a scene from Shirobako \(anime about making anime\), Ogasawara-san is the character designer](http://webm.host/5e59b/vid.webm). 
>> ARTICLE
That's why the art felt kinda familiar!!

Currently watching all 3 of those right now haha
>> ARTICLE
Have yet to re-watch the first episode but I love this series so much I can remember the episode from memory, and will watch it later on when I get home. 

It's a great introductory episode. The train scene is one of my favourite pieces in the series. Really shows the polar opposite of personalities between the two Nanas. 

As those that have watched it before have stated. This is one of the best representations of romance in anime format. 

Every character is flawed and the romances are quite intricate in themselves. Excited for everyone to watch this. 

Big thanks to /r/Are_you_daft for setting this up. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been meaning to watch this for awhile. I'll use this as motivation!
>> ARTICLE
Yes! Join us! It'll be great!

Starting out with a little piano music was a nice touch.

I enjoyed the opening theme song. As soon as I saw Nana, I recognized that this was an anime that I had been looking for for a few years now. I read a short advertisement in an anime DVD one day for NANA, and it peaked my interest, but I hadn't found it again since. I'm pretty happy that I'm finally watching that one anime title that's eluded me for a while. 

I like the art style, it is pretty and unique. It isn't my favorite, but the overanimated faces works when they use it for comedy, and they look very serene and nice when they aren't doing the over-animation. I find Nana adorable, and I think she is hard on herself for thinking she was annoying her family. I would enjoy going to Tokyo as well. 

Nana Osaki really hit the nail on the head with how much of a coincidence their meeting on the train was. I sort of agree with the first Nana about how Osaki looks, but I think she overdoes it just a little bit. I'd like to hear how she is on that guitar she had with her, and I'm glad it didn't crush adorable Nana. I liked how portions were told from Nana's perspective, with her narrating from first person.

 I think that short scene where they went in opposite directions off the train was very significant, at least symbolically, since the action really slowed down and the animation looked very deliberate for their shoes' movements.

 Nana gives great welcome hugs, she is even more adorable with her head on Shoji's chest. Nana is an awesome girlfriend, you gotta lover her 'lovey-dovey'ness as Nana Osaki put it. She is too good for the heart break she is feeling over her current relationship. It's like kisment that they met again at their future apartment. It's so nice that they can live together with such a great deal. Mr. Ando was nice to come up with that arrangement for them. I liked how they said "That's cheap!" and touched their pinkies together like they did. A nice happy ending to chapter one, I'm optimistic for the rest of the series. The ending theme was nice too. This was a happy little story.
>> ARTICLE
> I find Nana adorable, and I think she is hard on herself for thinking she was annoying her family.

I'm enjoying her character so far too, naive is probably the best word for her. I really like her but seeing her fail at something (guessing it'll happen I have no idea) seems like it's going to hurt to watch :/


>> ARTICLE
Good luck to first time watchers!

You're in for quite a ride. 

I hope you guys enjoy the OP. It was very cool.
>> ARTICLE
Going to give this one a shot as I've heard it was good but otherwise not that much about it. Trying to avoid the reactionary "ooh this happened, and then this happened," etc. style that I've done for a lot of other discussions so my posts won't be nearly as long.

The reactions of the two on the train are fun. I like their character designs too, different style from what I normally see these days. Neither of them really appear to be the kind of character I enjoy cheering on but we'll see.

So red-haired Nana is writing to the other one at some point in the future? Straightforward as a framing device but always makes me wonder why.

Adults! Sleeping together in the same bed! There are too many series about teenagers where even holding hands makes them blush; I much prefer this. Maybe I'm just a jaded old grump when it comes to romance.

And the two Nanas are roommates out of sheer coincidence but I'm okay with this. I'm also expecting the boyfriend to dump her at some point (was anticipating that at the beginning so she'd be alone in the city) but who knows if that will happen? ^(You rewatchers know, of course.)

Good start, I'm not sure I'll be commenting daily but I'll try.

/u/Are_you_daft, is the thread going up at the same time each day?

LOL. That was pretty much my reaction to it too, the first time around. It was so refreshing to see characters actually get intimate with each other.
>> ARTICLE
>So red-haired Nana is writing to the other one at some point in the future? Straightforward as a framing device but always makes me wonder why.

The style of narration really adds a layer of both intimacy and mystery, doesn't it? It was really the biggest factor in pulling me into the show, wanting to figure out the reasons for the tone of the narration. 

>Adults! Sleeping together in the same bed! There are too many series about teenagers where even holding hands makes them blush; I much prefer this.

Isn't it refreshing?

>I'm also expecting the boyfriend to dump her at some point (was anticipating that at the beginning so she'd be alone in the city)

Jesus, you're cold! They just moved in together and you already want them to separate?

I don't *want* them to break up, something just feels off about their relationship, like they aren't in sync. Moving to a large city without any plans other than to be with your boyfriend isn't exactly the wisest move either.

Edit: also they *aren't* moving in together, are they? Is Shoji moving in with her after she finds a new place?
>> ARTICLE
>also they aren't moving in together, are they? Is Shoji moving in with her after she finds a new place?

I just meant that they were living together for the time being and that they are no longer in a long distance relationship. As for what happens with their living situation, I'm going to keep mum about that.
>> ARTICLE
They really should have the current rewatches on the sidebar, I had no idea this was going to start!

I'm just a teeny bit ahead of you guys (okay, I'm 32 episodes in), so let me say to my fellow first-time watchers: It really is fantastic, unlike any other romance I've ever seen.  I'll probably have to go through my whole list and adjust the scores I've given romances after this.

Now I have to decide if I want to wait for you to catch up, or power ahead because I can't wait a whole month.  Oh god, a month?  Yeah I'm powering ahead, cya.

Do come back for the discussions though! We'd love to have you :)

First time watcher of this show and of this genre here watching Sub:

Pretty great first episode, Great OP and ED the music works well with the visuals.

The character design reminds of of CLAMP (Code Geass) with the thin, lanky, tall characters.

Chemistry between the two opposite Nanas is nice, although the relationship between Protagonist-Nana and Shoji seems strained right from the start. The mood certainly changes when the show starts to focus more on the relationships between the characters, while still having a playful mood when the characters interact with each other. Quite interesting and I can not wait to see how these moods contrast with one another but also not to underscore, but highlight the mature tone of the show.
>> ARTICLE
>The character design reminds of of CLAMP (Code Geass) with the thin, lanky, tall characters.

Yep, there are definitely some similar vibes between the styles.

>the relationship between Protagonist-Nana and Shoji 

Although it doesn't seem like it right now, both Nanas are the protagonists of the show! Their relationship is definitely very compelling. 
>> ARTICLE
Seeing this makes me so sad again. NANA forever hiatus :(
>> ARTICLE
DON'T LOSE HOPE! D:

Here we go...the series I've probably put aside for the longest time haha

I probably won't enjoy this series but I'm here anyway :p

**Episode 1**

Will admit I don't like the artstyle but I have 47 episodes to get used to it haha

I love coincidences so that whole train scene was fun to watch :)

Got bad feelings about this Tokyo bf...

More coincidence, love it.

So far so good. What's the best way to write which Nana we're talking about? lol

I'm really curious to see how the Nanas will interact with each other, they seem really different but actually seem to get along well (or the dark haired Nana is just really good at putting up with people :p)

>> ARTICLE
Not a fan of the art style myself. Call me shallow, but art style / pretty characters play a huge role in how much I like the show.

That being said, the art isn't horrible either, and the show made a strong enough first impression that I can spare it thirty minutes a day.

>> ARTICLE
I'm getting used to it and it's been one episode so I'll be good by like episode 10 haha but yeah I'm the same way about the art styles in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Really happy you are watching this. About time you get into more of the drama romance. :P

Art type is very on point with the manga, and it does take a little time to get used to it. I didn't mind it although giant foreheads made me laugh a few times. 

Best way to talk about the Nanas is calling one Nana O and the other one Hachi (you'll understand why late on). 

Hope you enjoy it all. :) 


>> ARTICLE
> Really happy you are watching this

Idk if you should be. I would be starting Honey & Clover this week if I wasn't in this group :/

> About time you get into more of the drama romance. 

I better not cry...

> Hope you enjoy it all. :)

We'll see...I'm keeping an open mind and so far so good but who knows :p
>> ARTICLE
This is just as good as Honey & Clover (although they are completely different anime is story and characters). If you do enjoy Nana, you might end up really wanting to watch Honey & Clover. ;) 

You might cry, but the tears are worth is. It really is fantastic romance story-telling. 
>> ARTICLE
It better be a romance! I've been burned with non romance shows before!

I cry all the time so it'll only be a when not an if haha

There will be so much romance half the time you'll be trying to figure out/argue which is the best coupling/ships.

I've teared up many a time in this show.

I do like doing that...but I like when all the ships win :p

I will tear up so much ha

There is a lot of it on the show and you will be argry/happy/sad when watching it all unfold.

Haha I'll be relying on that

Oh please, there is only one true ship [Not really spoiler](/s "Hachi x Nana")
>> ARTICLE
For me, even though it's the tail end of the show, will always be [best couple] (/s "Yasu and Miu forever.")

The show? I'm pretty sure that ship doesn't arrive in harbor until the manga-only arcs!

No, it's near the end of the series. Just expanded a little more in the manga. :)

> Got bad feelings about this Tokyo bf...

Me too! I was wondering if she would get dumped on the way to Tokyo, but so far they're still together.

> they seem really different but actually seem to get along well (or the dark haired Nana is just really good at putting up with people :p)

I think dark-haired Nana cares about the other one even if she's reserved about it, since she was quick to defend red-Nana when her own realtor was being bothersome.
>> ARTICLE
>  but so far they're still together.

For now haha

> since she was quick to defend red-Nana when her own realtor was being bothersome.

Yeah it's stuff like that that make her seem more caring then I would have thought from her appearance!
>> ARTICLE
Hey, hey, none of that negative attitude in here!

>Will admit I don't like the artstyle 

But it's so pretty! 

>Got bad feelings about this Tokyo bf...

No comment!

>What's the best way to write which Nana we're talking about?

For now, probably Nana K(omatsu) for the red head, and Nana O(saki) for the black haired one. Some people use Nana for the red head and NANA for the black haired one. Later on, around episode 8, Nana K will get the nickname "Hachi" which will make things a lot simpler.

We're going to have so much fun, ha!
>> ARTICLE
> But it's so pretty!

By the end of the episode I think I already got used to it. Just something feels off with the bodies, everything else on point :p

Going to have to learn these. I like the Nana and NANA one haha that's cute
>> ARTICLE
I'm on episode 4 because I went ahead because I'm a bit busy this week. It's been about a week since I watched the first episode but I really liked this episode as an introduction to all the characters. I loved the chemistry between the two Nanas on the train and I'm very excited to watch the rest of the series. 
>> ARTICLE
What a coincidence, started reading the manga yesterday

Which one would you recommend, manga or the anime?
>> ARTICLE
For the first time through the series, I definitely recommend the anime. It's 100% faithful to the manga *and* you get to hear the music. Also, as you may or may not know, the manga is on indefinite hiatus and it ends on a pretty big cliffhanger. The anime, on the other hand, ends on a better, more conclusive, note. I definitely recommend you to read the manga after finishing the anime if you liked it though.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa! Paging /u/dgtl13, I know you'll love this thread! Hopefully you'll get access to interwebzz soon!

I'm not sure if NANA is the best show for filling holes, since it's probably better for digging them... but hey, I welcome you with open arms (and we can all cry together at the end)!

Sounds like a plan

That is a bad, bad idea. I mean, you should totally check out the show, but Nana is just about the worst choice to fill up a hole.

It would be like filling up a gun wound with a grenade.
>> ARTICLE
First time to really participate in one of these.

I remember watching an episode of NANA many years ago, so I was a little surprised that I hadnt seen the first episode. Im a little curious [which one I did watch,](/s " Hachi was working at a restaurant, and was crushing on or going out with a guy that worked there, but she found out he was seeing someone else.") Any re-watchers mind telling me?

Im digging the show so far. Not too much to say yet.

* She can come clean my place any time.
* I only wish moving in Japan was that easy. Ill be looking for a new place early next year, and Im not looking forward to it.
* [Romi Park](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=5108) (voice of the dark Nana) is a freaking awesome seiyuu. You probably wouldnt even notice its the same person who did Edward from FMA or Ragyo from Kill la Kill.

After we finish NANA, I vote we watch [Nana Nana Nana Nana Nana Nana Nana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/623/Shichinin_no_Nana), [Batman.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4094/Batman:_Gotham_Knight)
>> ARTICLE
In regards to your spoiler, I'm pretty sure that's episodes 13 to 14.  although I could be wrong since [](/s "in those episodes, she was a guest at the restaurant, not an employee.")

Thanks, that's probably it. It's been over 5 years since I saw it, so I'm a bit hazy on the details. Even the one or two episodes I watched left an impression though, so I've been looking forward to this rewatch.

First time watcher here.

holy moly...
my expectation is blown up unto the ninth cloud and I cannot but marathon this thing tonight.

It will be very hard to go from this badass to the normal anime where it takes 3 cours just for the MC to say ask a girl out.  The only malus point I give is from the below-par music. Either I dont understand the genre or it's just not very good. Maybe I should listen to Sex Pistol to ease into this.

Oooh, 9 hours late to the rewatch, sorry guys. 

I've put Nana on hold a few months back when I was around the 12 episodes mark, but I'll be joining you on this rewatch hopefully to the end. 

[Very minor spoilers](/s "I'm able to appreciate red Nana's room more now that I've seen up to episode 12.") [This screenshot is part of the minor spoilers](https://imgur.com/Y5O7b0x).

[This old man's](https://imgur.com/nDR1e3W) voice actor was super familiar to me during my first watch. I looked up him and realized that he was the professor in Detective Conan/Case Closed, as well as a bunch of old school mecha villains like General Bat from Getter Robo. He has such a distinctive old man voice. 

Not much else to say about this first episode other than I'm looking forward to the ride!

Don't sweat it, better late than never!

As for your spoiler... oh you sweet summer child, you haven't seen nothin' yet!

*Super* late posting this, but I'll be a first-timer for this _Nana_ rewatch.  Been meaning to watch this for the longest time, so this is my excuse!

(I think) I'll be pretty brief today, partly because I am so late and partly because I already watched this episode before writing anything.  Maybe I'll keep doing that anyway, who knows.

So, the character design.  Others have already pointed out the Clamp-iness, and I'll point out the shoujo-ness.  Combined, it's a little strange, but I got over it in like a minute.

Indications seem to be that music and musicianship will play some role in this.  Rocker Nana and that opening sure seem to say so.  There's also the contrast between loud/in-your-face and quiet/solitude in it too.

People keep saying this is a show devoid of tropes and archetypes, but they seem pretty clear here, at least, to me.  Happy-go-lucky, sweet, cute, nave, unsure country mouse meets cool, worldly, skeptical, slightly distant, somewhat badass, city mouse.  Amazing coincidences (and a little insensitivity on the part of men) push them together and they become roommates; hijinx (?!) ensue.  Understand, I'm not dismissing anything; it seems like a good setup.  But don't fool yourself, tropes are everywhere (and they're not bad, just tools).

Kind of funny how nave Nana stays the night with her boyfriend (same bed, seemingly nude, even), yet still seems to be in this "I wonder if we'll be close enough to live together someday" mode.  Not that she doesn't immediately attempt to charge straight into the wife zone.  Heh, cute.

Said boyfriend's seeming lack of any tender/intimate feelings for her don't bode well, however.
>> ARTICLE
Im late as hell, but after three episodes in I am loving this show.

We're glad to have you aboard! Now hurry up and catch up, we have so much to discuss!

I forgot how amazing this opening was.

First time watching, and I have a few questions. All the disscussion about how "realistic" this show is worries me, because I want to watch a more light-hearted show but generally realism comes with a lot of emotional roller coasters. So I was wondering how much of that is in this show. Is it closer to the WA2 kind of roller coaster, the Clannad:AS, Nagi no Askura, or mb its own thing?
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru, down the hall on the left.  You baulk at a card game about poetry?  

Very lighthearted, but a lot of heart.
>> ARTICLE
If you're looking for a light hearted show, you are definitely in the wrong place. If WA2 was a roller coaster to you, then NANA is probably going to be like sky diving. Much more impactful, but also much more authentic.
>> ARTICLE
hahahaha YES! The sky diving made me laugh out loud.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to watch this (for the 2nd time), but I don't prefer dubs, and as a pirate, this treasure is hella difficult to lay eyes upon.

Is hulu available where you live? They have the subs for free.

I usually watch during my commute or when theres no net around, so I prefer having the file.

As I spend a lot of time at coffee stores or other such places, you don't always want to watch anime there (esp since I react to things)

I'll have to make do I guess!
>> ARTICLE
The first episode was magnificent but I've heard worrisome things about the ending. I sort of need decent conclusions to my anime. Worried. 
>> ARTICLE
Take my word for it that the next 46 episodes will make the journey more than worth your time. Yes, the ending leaves loose ends, but it's not as if there's absolutely no closure. The final episode even has a flash forward showing the main cast many years down the road.
>> ARTICLE
All right, I'll take your word on it. Contrary to many, I actually sort of like the animation and art style. I look forward to many feels. And hopefully I can still watch romance anime after this. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Great! I look forward to seeing you in future discussions!

Does anyone know what the orchestral music is called that plays when Nana O and Nana K shake hands on leasing the apartment together? It's the most beautiful music that I feel wraps up the extreme emotion in this anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I wish I knew. I tried looking for a title, I really did, but no luck... Sorry.
>> ARTICLE
 I only read the manga a year ago, but I'd already forgotten so much that I decided to try watching the anime. 

I really liked the first episode of Nana. The fateful meeting, the reunion, and the big decision all set up the rest of the anime perfectly. In fact, their relationship at first almost makes this seem like a yuri anime.


Also OP on a side note, in your last post you said Nana was the best romance ever created. I just wanted to correct your mistake and inform you that Maison Ikkoku has held that spot for almost 20 years.
>> ARTICLE
>in your last post you said Nana was the best romance ever created

While I do like Nana but I wouldn't call it "best romance ever created" because the plot progress seems to be forced at a certain point, dragging to much drama along the way and the whole Nana situation is way too melodrama.

[Heavy spoilers](/s "The whole Nana situation is melodrama because she is an easy girl who would sleep with the first hot guy she met after 10 min, still never learns her lesson and just making more mess out of every guy she met. She is lustful, lacks of morality and unknowledgeable (totally not her fault she didn't use any protection). Furthermore, what it seems forced is that why should Takumi be interested in a relationship with her? Just so the mangaka can create more connection between the other Nana's band and Trapnest, thus brings more drama")
>> ARTICLE
A *subjectively bad* character does not necessarily a *badly written* character make. [spoils](/s "I understand why you think this seems forced, but for your same reasons, I feel like this isn't. Sure it's dramatic, especially on Komatsu's end, but that's to be expected. It's in her character to be the way she is. To be flirty and feminine. Takumi's a playboy megalomaniac. And, by the power of plot device, they end up in the same room. Remember though, that the events of the show take place within the span of a few months. The average person does not change that quickly. Nor does a person simply move on from a previous relationship scot-free. There's a lot of buildup. A lot of brilliant characterization that makes the show so believable.") Not that the show isn't melodramatic sometimes, but I believe it's wholly within the accepted confines of the genre and nothing too blatant. Nana might not be "the best romance ever created" for everyone, but it's an exceptionally well written story if I've ever read one.
>> ARTICLE
The dynamic between the two Nanas is definitely one of my favorite aspects of the series, and the sexual tension is indeed almost palpable.

It's been a long ass time since I've seen Maison Ikkoku, but I do remember it feeling very homey and quaint. I'll probably have to rewatch that sooner or later.
>> ARTICLE
I'm already halfway through watching Nana. Guess I'll wait for the rewatch to catch up
>> ARTICLE
Lots more scenes around the toilet compared to most shows.

* July 16th, hmm. On episode 28, the episode she beds Nobu the first time, the date on her cellphone was July 30th. Her last night with Takumi I'm guessing was around the 28th. Could be either of them. But the real question is, might it actually the Great Demon Lord's? Expect the unexpected in this show, right?
* Someone's gonna find that sonogram.
* Shin's eavesdropping. Wonder if he'll tell the others. Oh the stall Shin is standing in was done in 3D CGI. Anyone interested in a stereoscopic version of it?
* Yup, expected Takumi. 
* Oh. Guess no one had to find that sonogram. Trope subverted.
* Takumi's an asshole, but that probably was for the best. When is she going to tell her Mother? Also, I'd like to see [her sister Nami's reaction](http://i.imgur.com/vMBxyjL.png).

So does anyone really miss Hachi's inner dialog? Seems to be pretty clear what she must be thinking/feeling at this point.

**Episode 31**

NANA as narrator is cool but she doesn't have that great of a voice for narration like Hachi. Though it's probably because I'm not used to it. Though she's saying interesting things!

The doctor looks considerate enough.

Misato with the breach of trust!!!! Too bad she has to go :(
I always liked her.

FUCKING TAKUMI NOOO!!!
Oh I know this episode...
I remember this one. Oh dear god.

NANA heard I think. Ohhh man Takumi. Fuck off but damn you have to appreciate the fact he's gonna do whatever the fck he wants.

--

>> ARTICLE
Big hand to the doctor, not showing anything but professionalism and guiding the patient. Always see in a show or movie them having a personal opinion and forcing it on the patient. She's so nice and calming for Hachi.

I really love the female VAs in this show, just because they are all completely different and unique.

The distinctive parental relationship between the three is quite... stark. Hachi, finding out she is pregnant, and not knowing what to do with here, hearing about Shin's family, while Nana quips about how parents shouldn't have their children (due to her own abandonment issues), while Misato is a dark horse, hiding her personal details/family.

Takumi only cares because Nana chose Nobu, even after all that complaining about no contact from her the other episode. Now everyone is put on the spot.
>> ARTICLE
What in the world happened here? I was so excited to come back tonight and see that there were 70 comments in the thread - I figured people were arguing about Takumi or something. Well. I certainly did expect these types of discussion to occur with a rewatch of NANA, but I'm still saddened by it. I mean, the drama is the heart of everything in this show, so it's an absolutely acceptable topic to have heated debate about. 

Really though, what I want to say is that I feel bad for convincing /u/AmethystItalian into going through with this rewatch. I knew it wouldn't be your favorite show, but I definitely did not think it would be a frustrating experience for you. I hope you can find some aspects of the show to at least appreciate when this is all done.
>> ARTICLE
> I figured people were arguing about Takumi or something. 

Speaking of Takumi though, I'm not so sure if he's a bad guy anymore. He's just emotionally closed off and inconsiderate, but it wasn't like he was cheating on Hachi (from what it showed us). It seemed like he was relatively serious about a relationship.

>> ARTICLE
The only thing that Takumi has done so far that could be considered wrong was blurting out at the party that he slept with Nana. He's actually not that bad of a guy from what we see.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, my thoughts as well. And, well, this episode he sort of steamrolled Hachi.


>> ARTICLE
I don't want to be misunderstood. I think it's great the /u/AmethystItalian went out and discussed her true feelings. I didnt want to defend Nana as a great show but rather defend Nana's traits. I felt it was being sold short regardless of the person's tastes. I hope that I didn't bother or offend anyone, or even give the impression of anyone's preference is worth less than my own.

In the end, no anime can be for everyone. I'm sure we all know this, and have experienced first hand the disagreement of tastes. This is what's great about media in general, we are able to clash with opinions and different perspectives in discussion forums just like this one :)

Hope to continue further discussions with all of you in the future!

That kind style of drama is rare in anime, but this kind of drama is every day on /r/anime.

Since /u/AmethystItalian stuck her neck out, I'll back her up on a few points- having watched plenty of JDrama, the story and drama in it isn't really anything unique- just uncommon in the medium of anime.

I also agree it isn't as realistic as people claim it to be, though I do think more thought was put into the characters and their actions than average (in any medium). That is to say, many of the situations are pretty far-fetched, only happens in fiction kinds of events. Even Nana and Hachi's encounter is pretty far out there; Same name, same age, same train in the same row, go to see the same apartment (which happens to be room 707), etc etc. Not to mention the whole pre-cognizant Sachiko thing.

I'm enjoying the show myself, but I can understand why some people wouldn't.
>> ARTICLE

Thanks for the back up haha glad to see it's just not in my head :p

I would have watched it anyway and this rewatch forced me not to drop it so it's for the best!!

My comment is back up to zero points haha so that's good to see :p

I tried to give reasons on why it's not my thing so I didn't sound like I was just hating on it!
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering how long Hachi would keep it a secret. Turns out not that long but it's not her fault Takumi's a giant asshole.

First anime I've seen that has a gynecology exam in it. I think only the third series that deals with pregnancy as a general topic. And... abortion's an option. Not pulling any punches here, I appreciate that.

So Shin's past comes up to give some color to the choice Hachi faces. Everyone can determine their own fate. Does she want to try to be a parent and possibly be an irresponsible one? Nana faces her own insecurities about possibly being a mother as well and feeling inadequate about it.

Oh, and there's drama with the studio because one giant life-changing event at a time isn't enough for this series.

And then Takumi drops by at nearly the worst possible time to be a dick about things. I know he's trying to step up and take responsibility but that's really inappropriate. After what he did there I hope Hachi shuts him out of her life regardless of her decision.

^(Funnily enough I'm dealing with some personal stuff not entirely unrelated to the content of the series right now so there's a chance I won't be able to keep up with the group for a few days.)
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he cares about taking responsibility. He just wanted to make Nobu feel like shit because he is more of a "man" than Nobu and has the financial ability to take care of two people. 
>> ARTICLE
:O  ^(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&larr; classic Nana K reaction face)
>> ARTICLE
"too scared of being a mother."  Makes sense, given her experience with her own.

Man.  Nana O sure does seem to resent seeing Ren anymore.  What's the deal?

And Misato's stay (in)conveniently ends tomorrow.  This little lighthearted scene with her seems like the kind of thing that's going to get scarce real soon.  Then again, this show never seems to give out, so who knows!

Nana K seems shocked to be asked if she's keeping the baby.  You *cannot* have failed to think of this, can you?

Those lingering shots of the medical equipment; Nana K looking mildly terrified.  Yup, we're not pulling any punches, are we.  Sixth week, right on schedule for the morning sickness.

Hmmm, nice collision of storylines, there.  Shin's "I wish I'd never been born" delivered right into Nana K's lap while she ponders an abortion.

Misato crying.  Nana K's right, Nana O says stuff like that knowing what it'll do, then objects.  Kinda mean!

Nana O really twisting the knife for Nana K too, unknowingly.  She doesn't seem to have thought of this "who the father was" question either.

Whoa, they have the same OB/GYN!  Small world!

"Maybe she's on the rag!", complete with overbearing echo.  That would be pretty punk to include in a song.

"Bondage pants"!  Finally someone addresses this pressing issue!  But outdated?  This show is the first I've heard of such a thing, and it's not like I'm too young to have done so

From one toilet shot to another.  This is the episode of visual echoes, seems like.

*Perfect* timing, Takumi.  "I'mgonnagetanabortionsodon'tworry!"  BAM, just like that.  And that maneuver with the phone and the door.  Dick move, man.  Guess he feels like she cheated on him, though.

Wait.  What?  I was *not* expecting that from Takumi!  Is he saying that for the reactions?  Or is he really that into her?  Or what?  Again, having a hell of a time nailing this guy down.

**Episode 31**

Well this episode is sure to be fun to watch

I'm going to really enjoy these NANA intro monologues

Takumi's baby! Wooo -.-

That's gotta be so tough for Nana though...

Wow so even their band looks like it's not going that well :/

Takumi's back of course

I don't care about realistic or not this series is just so bleh for me haha
>> ARTICLE
Well that's a huge amount of time wasted by everyone trying to convince the others that their tastes are better.

Amethyst *loves* frickin *Amagami*. Let that sink in for a moment. It's like giving a girl who likes *candies* a full blown 5-courses meal rich in protein and calories, especially designed for bodybuilding enthusiasts.

She's just not the target audience, probably a bit too young for this shit. Maybe watch NANA again in 5 to 10 years ? Nothing wrong in liking the likes of Amagami, once upon a time I loved Super Sentai shows ... 

Its just that at the end of the day when giving rating I firmly keep the 21 - 40 years old, more mature, worldly and erudite viewers as audience just because I feel I know somewhat what they wanna see. I give Amagami a 6 and NANA a 10 but if a sheltered, 16 year old girl asked me what Anime to watch, I sure as hell ain't gonna tell her to watch NANA.

This is my first time reading your comments again in a long while and it seems what I feared might happen has happened. 

I remember a conversation we had way back in the first episodes in which you responded:

>  Satisfying > Realistic in my books though haha
I guess I should appreciate what they were going for and how they succeeded rather then be upset for not turning it into the way I wanted.

Might it be that you lost that approach a little? 

Nana is not the easiest show to watch, for sure. There seem to be little to no limits in how high or low the show is willing to go, but that's a big reason why we watch and like it. 

We don't know when we will get thrown a curve ball, so that makes the times that much more valuable and precious. Like the famous adage says: *this too shall pass.* That counts not only for the happy times, but for the sad times as well. While things may not always turn out like we want them too (which is hard to accept, especially in anime where narratives are predictable the overwhelming majority of the time), there is bound to be a silver lining since the sun always looms behind the clouds.

Since you seem the situations of the cast seem to massively influence your enjoyment, my advice would be to take a little step back emotionally and just appreciate the subtleties (like today's subversion of the sonogram trope and the 'who's baby is it'-trope).

Don't focus too much on the negative and look for the silver lining. The coming episodes will not be kind on you if you don't.
>> ARTICLE
> Might it be that you lost that approach a little?

I guess so but hard to keep that mentality for over 25 episodes -.-

> There seem to be little to no limits in how high or low the show is willing to go, but that's a big reason why we watch and like it.

There seems to be a limit on the high haha but I'll agree with the low :p

> We don't know when we will get thrown a curve ball

Whenever you think "oh this is going well" chances are one of those curve balls are coming :p

>  my advice would be to take a little step back emotionally and just appreciate the subtleties

I'm already like 5 steps back haha in situations where I would normally feel sad I'm just rolling my eyes. It's been 30+ episodes and nothing has been close to being good memorable for me haha. I've been trying to focus on a silver lining but it's so small that it's hard to care.
>> ARTICLE
> There seems to be a limit on the high

It's like in real life: highs are almost always single moments of extreme joy, not prolonged periods of ultimate bliss. On the other hand, lows can seem to drag on. 

So rather than looking for soaring moments, look at the things going smoothly and steadily. The band is doing fine by all accounts, they've been practicing a lot and skepticism is one thing, but you have to trust in BLAST. Nana and Ren are also doing pretty well right now, Ren wants Nana by his side and even though Nana is conflicted (as always), she does want to see him. Otherwise she wouldn't come. 

> nothing has been close to being good memorable

Now that's hard to believe. Don't tell me you weren't happy for Nana when she met Ren again. Or when Hachi got together with Nobu. Or BLAST and their first live concert. 

But yeah, I thought in advance that this might not be your show as it is heavy on the drama like most relationships are, especially the ones not meant to be. And if it's any comfort you are certainly not the only one who feels this way towards Hachi. Don't say I didn't warn you about her :P 

Just remember: even things as seemingly 'low' as unwanted pregnancy can have good side-effects. 
>> ARTICLE
> It's like in real life: highs are almost always single moments of extreme joy, not prolonged periods of ultimate bliss. On the other hand, lows can seem to drag on.

What's been a moment of extreme joy? NANA and Ren meeting up again? Nana and Nobu finally getting together? Uhhh Yasu...being Yasu?

> The band is doing fine by all accounts, they've been practicing a lot and skepticism is one thing, but you have to trust in BLAST

I was taking solace in that but the most recent conversation in the bathroom had me going oh you're going to take away that too??

>  Don't tell me you weren't happy for Nana when she met Ren again. Or when Hachi got together with Nobu. Or BLAST and their first live concert.

These are like the only "good" things to happen. I guess they're memorable when you compare to the rest of the show and all the bad things happening haha. Just because they were good things happening I never found them too powerful. That first live concert was really really good but more on how they decided to do it then the story surrounding it.

> But yeah, I thought in advance that this might not be your show as it is heavy on the drama like most relationships are, especially the ones not meant to be. 

Yeah apparently so, I'm just a bit surprised that people want to watch this for entertainment haha it's like let's make a show where more things go wrong then right and isn't meant to be too fun because well real life is like that haha it's like why. That's my personal view of it though, I know some people like that stuff but just doesn't resonate with me at all.

It's not even only Hachi it's the situations that just seem to be something will go wrong that frustrates me. Like watch it'll be Takumi who propose so Nobu x Nana won't ever happen and things end with nobody being happy haha who knows maybe the cliche lose the baby thing will happen too. Actually that would help the situation (terrible way to look at it but it's fiction) so it probably won't happen!!


>> ARTICLE
> I was taking solace in that but the most recent conversation in the bathroom had me going oh you're going to take away that too??

It's a problem, but we've been told many times how good the band really is. Considering they don't lack the talent or the drive, they have as good a chance as any. 

> It's not even only Hachi it's the situations that just seem to be something will go wrong that frustrates me.

Actually that would help the situation (terrible way to look at it but it's fiction) so it probably won't happen!!

Not going to spoil anything here, haha. But there is a chance that no one will end up happy, yes. I'm telling you that, because I don't know what happens either, with the whole manga ordeal and all. 

In any case, this is one of the very, very few shows where I genuinely can't guess. Sometimes, people do not end up happy in their life. Most people settle for less than perfect and sometimes people have to settle for less than good too. 

For the record, I do hope more than anything that it will end on a happy note. I can't tell you more, but I still think that it will, in the end, through all the drama. 

> I'm just a bit surprised that people want to watch this for entertainment haha it's like let's make a show where more things go wrong then right and isn't meant to be too fun because well real life is like that haha it's like why. That's my personal view of it though, I know some people like that stuff but just doesn't resonate with me at all.

Well... you're not the only one. My sister is exactly like that, she refuses to watch *Up!* because I told her there is one touching, sad scene where she might cry. 

But this is the core of the problem. With me it's like this: a show or movie can make me sad and affect me, but if it does and it's good and there is a message to it, however harsh it may be, I will consider myself the richer for it. There is a sense of satisfaction to it in the end, something to be gotten out of it besides enjoyment. 

But if you can't get past that, push through the sadness to get something else out of it, because you just watch for enjoyment only... well, then this show poses a problem lots of the time. 

Have you watched and 'enjoyed' something like White Album 2? 5 cm/s? Grave of the Fireflies? Just curious, because there are similarities. 
>> ARTICLE
> It's a problem, but we've been told many times how good the band really is. Considering they don't lack the talent or the drive, they have as good a chance as any.

Yeah I hope it does work out since well something in this show has to.

Wooo...

> Sometimes, people do not end up happy in their life

Of course yeah but who wants to see that??

> Up! because I told her there is one touching, sad scene where she might cry.

The first scene? That had a great balance of happy and sad and serves a pretty big purpose. I can get behind that. 

White Album 2 destroyed me but it left an impression. I felt like I could relate to the characters and wasn't a "let's make everything bad" concept. I cried like crazy and I go back to watch to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp3ioFt4Ogg) to feel those feelings again. I can do sad anime and I understand how something sad can lead to enjoyment but I don't find Nana sad at all.
>> ARTICLE
>but I don't find Nana sad at all.

In my opinion, I could be way off, Hatchi is a really unlikable character compared to the characters from WA2. You don't feel as much of a emotional connection with Nana characters when things go wrong because you feel like they had it coming and brought in on themselves. Compared to WA2 where you have more likable characters and so more of an emotional story. I also moslty agree with what watashi-akashi is saying.

>There is something to be gained from the show, something important. But you have to be susceptible to the message and it has to resonate. If it doesn't, it can be a drag.

>The execution of it all is undeniably impressive. Even if you don't like the show, you have to see that it's doing what it's going for exceedingly well (characters, writing, sound, pacing, even art style).
>> ARTICLE
While I respect your opinion as I love both anime immensely(both are 9 on my scale), I dont see how WA2 has stronger characters or even a more emotional story. Hachi has her moments but yes she's mostly unlikable. However even after all her shit, I cannot give up on her.
>> ARTICLE
Meh I don't think WA2 has stronger characters just more likable ones and the point I was trying to make is you can be more emotionally invested in characters that you like.

Edit: And can be drawn out of emotional impact for characters you don't like as you may think that they deserved it =D
>> ARTICLE
Why would you want to watch a show filled with unlikeable characters? hhaa

What this apparent message? Life sucks sometimes? Bad decisions lead to bad things? Don't let the Demon Lord control you? haha 
>> ARTICLE
You can see my reply to your other comment but i'll post it again here for lurkers.

>Why would you want to watch a show filled with unlikeable characters?

This is why I think my judgement is thoroughly clouded on this show. Hatchi is one of my least favorite anime characters but then some of my favorite characters are also in this show. Yasu, Shin, Ren, Nana O, Takumi (Not as a person but as a character).

>What this apparent message?

Haha I don't feel like writing an essay in a lecture so i'll leave that to your imagination =D
>> ARTICLE
> Of course yeah but who wants to see that??

Well, I kinda wouldn't mind if the story is well done :P 

> I felt like I could relate to the characters

Have you never met someone like Hachi? Or felt like Nana O sometimes in your life? I also doubt you've never met a Nobu kind of guy.

> I can do sad anime and I understand how something sad can lead to enjoyment but I don't find Nana sad at all. 

Let me guess: you would describe the show as annoying, depressing or most likely both (just a guess, no offense intended). 

You kinda say it yourself with:

> it left an impression.

Nana leaves a pretty big impression with me. It reminds me of how people are never all good or bad. Of how both good and bad moments are born from situations that just 'happen' when people are still always doing the best they can. And we have to deal with it, the best we can, even if that isn't enough. 

It grounds me in the sense that people are flawed and that you have to accept that, along with the fact that those flaws will cause bumps on the road. 

There is something to be gained from the show, something important. But you have to be susceptible to the message and it has to resonate. If it doesn't, it can be a drag. 

Honestly though, what thing doesn't have that element? That's why the adage 'different strokes for different folks' is so relevant in the first place. 

The execution of it all is undeniably impressive. Even if you don't like the show, you have to see that it's doing what it's going for exceedingly well (characters, writing, sound, pacing, even art style).

Someone as bad as Hachi? Nope not even close. Some similar traits but nothing like that. I meant more situation the characters were in also, I should have put that in too!

> Let me guess: you would describe the show as annoying, depressing or most likely both

Nana? It's more frustrating so I guess annoying fits. I wouldn't say depressing though, hard to care for most of the characters so I've never been that sad.

I understand how it's supposed to show how life isn't fair, some people are terrible, bad things happen etc. but again everyone knows that haha who wants to watch nearly 50 episodes of that happening. The different strokes thing I get, I usually see why people enjoy things I don't like harems, ecchi and stuff but this is a little harder for me. 

It's characters are strong and are very unique especially for anime and the it takes a lot of unique roads which is cool.

I think I'm just hung up on so many people calling this "the best romance" while there has been like almost nothing for me in that department for me haha. 
>> ARTICLE
> I think I'm just hung up on so many people calling this "the best romance" while there has been like almost nothing for me in that department for me haha.

That really depends on what you're looking for. I love romance as a genre, but I can't give something the credential of 'best romance' if it only shows a hundreth of what real relationships are like. 

Don't get me wrong, I like a high school romance from time to time... but I have a hard time taking most of them seriously as true portrayals of romance. Girl likes boy, boy is oblivious. Or boy likes girl, she likes him as well, but they can't get together because reasons. Or worse, *misunderstandings*. And it always ends with them getting together, holding hands or if we're really lucky with a kiss, but nothing more. You know, except for the panty shots, bouncing boobs and accidental groping after a sudden fall. So we're aware that they exist, it's just that we can't have anything actually important happen with them.

There are precious few shows actually willing to give you the whole spectrum, both emotionally and progression wise, simply because of the risk that people like yourself will say 'fuck this shit, I'm out' and they will suffer a loss. 

So they play it safe and we get another shounen with an MC that's like *GIRLS LIKE ME BUT I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE I MEAN, WHY WOULD THEY LIKE ME, IN REAL LIFE THEY SURE AS HELL WOULDN'T*. Or, if you're lucky, you get a shoujo that's so ridiculously saccharine you have to get your foot amputated through instant diabetes. 

I want to see everything that forms a regular person romantically. The good and the bad, the start and the finish. Nana is practically the only show I know of that does that and does it well, very well. That's why I feel it's the best.

Calling something best is always subjective. It always depends on what you want to see and feel. But that's my reasoning behind it. 

I probably won't respond to you the next 8 hours or more, it's precisely 1 AM over here and I need to get some sleep :P

> I don't care about realistic or not this series 

This is a very shallow way of thinking on why people like Nana lol. Not everything can be justified for liking something by saying it's realistic.

Nana is praised for it's realistic take on relationships but it's also praised for it's characters, it's maturity, it's lack of cheesy drama that takes place in so many romance anime today. It's ability to make you feel different emotions is always talked about as well. It's not interested in being all happy sappy or anything but rather a mix. 

I get that you don't like it but I hope you can atleast try to understand the different viewpoints of those who do.
>> ARTICLE
Lack of cheesy drama? The pregnancy thing is almost as cheesy as it gets, not in anime but in soaps and other media it's used a ton. All I kept hearing was how realistic this anime was and I guess realistic means "something bad will always happen" haha.

I even put the "for me" to hopefully avoid being called shallow haha I understand why people like this sort of stuff but it just doesn't do it for me. It's just not enjoyable to watch at all again for me. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm on the same boat here. I don't necessarily think the show is bad at all, and I actually enjoyed it quite a bit early on for the comedy elements, but now that all the drama is culminating, eh, it's not really for me. I really don't care to watch this sort of drama to be honest, and I feel like it's the type of 'realistic drama' that I see in western TV a lot. Not particularly my cup of tea.

Expanding on it, I probably won't give Nana a bad score. I enjoyed the early parts, and I think its cast and elements are well developed, but I don't know, I don't really find it enjoyable at the same time, at least in these parts, and I feel like we're just headed into more and more drama.

How is it cheesy lol? She's having unprotected sex multiple times, of course she's going to get pregnant. Most anime would go past this and let her go without consequences. You might say in other media it is but it's far more fair to compare it to shows within it's own medium. Can you think of a romance anime that doesn't have cheesy drama? Nana compared to those is nothing cheesy, **especially** for an anime.

Realism does not mean something bad will happen. That's just an idea you figured out somehow on your own. Ren and NANA were able to get back together without much drama, sure they will have troubles ahead but what relationship doesn't?  

Most things that happened "bad" in this series were to Hachi, and guess what...She deserves them! Bad decisions turn into bad consequences. Not paying attention to your boyfriend? Guess what he might move on. Not paying attention to your work? Guess what you'll get fired. Not using sufficient protection during sex? Guess how babies are made. Who knew that following your boyfriend to another city when you weren't prepared had consequences?

I'm not saying that disliking the show is shallow or anything like that. But rather that saying realism is the only thing that Nana has makes it feel shallow when it really isn't.
>> ARTICLE
> How is it cheesy lol? She's having unprotected sex multiple times, of course she's going to get pregnant

Who does that?! lol and the whole it can be two dads thing...like come on that's cheesy/generic pregnancy storyline. If she falls down some stairs and loses the baby it'll hit all the cliches ha.

I guess I've watched enough of other media to just roll my eyes whenever pregnancy is used for drama. It's not done in anime since the majority of romance are set in high school haha there's barely sex in anime so of course it's going to be "unique" in it's own medium. 

Yeah Ren and NANA seem to be going strong...makes you wonder how long it will last haha. This show has been oh here's a good thing now let's take it away. 

So this anime with Hachi as a main is more like showing you what not to do? Haha that's a fun one way to look at it. People complain about the generic male harem leads but even they don't seem to be as bad or mess up as much as Nana does lol
>> ARTICLE
> lol and the whole it can be two dads thing

Realistically it's ONLY Takumi's . The only drama here is whether she keeps it and how it'll affect her relationships. Also what do you mean "who does that?". Many people have unprotected sex lol...that's how alot of unplanned pregnancies happen.

Well anyway let's compare NANA and Hachi.

NANA didn't follow her boyfriend to Tokyo, she takes the pill, she works sidejobs and seems to put effort into that. She's completely hardworking and smart on what she wants to do. 

Hachi is literally the opposite. She followed her boyfriend, she lost him. She doesn't have protection, she gets pregnant. She doesn't work hard at her job, loses it. 

See who's life is better. NANA didn't follow her boyfriend, but she gets him back. She has protection, doesn't get pregnant. She works hard and continues to get rewarded. Though most thing in her life is good, it's grounded. Yes she has her boyfriend back but it's not like it's incredibly great, their love is incredibly strong though. She still has trouble with her feelings with Yasu and her "dependency" on Ren, and now recently they might have problems with the paparazzi.  

Then with her recording contract, yes it's great that they are getting a contract but that's not the end of everything. She still needs to produce selling songs, sell her brand well...the band needs to improve in general. All common problems with newcomers. Some can't adapt and lose contracts while others adapt too quickly and lose the fanbase that they worked so hard to keep.

> People complain about the generic male harem leads

The thing with generic male harem leads is that after the 10th anime with a similar lead...it's just unoriginal. That's how things become generic lol. At one point generic things used to be unique. Generic leads seem to always block any form of plot while Hachi doesn't.

Also I want to clarify, im not trying to convince you that Nana is good. That's your entirely valid opinion. It's just I want to discuss what it means to like something like Nana.

**"You know, Hachi... I still believe that life is what we make of it. But I'm now able to recognize that not everyone can be strong all the time.**

**Because of that, I've become that much kinder since then."**

Well, we saw it coming, but now we've fully entered the maelstrom. And the ones smack damn in the center of it all today, are Hachi and everyone's favorite guy Takumi.

There are few things as big a test for the strength of someone's character than an unexpected pregnancy. So naturally people will deal with it differently. 

Hachi's reaction is different from what I remembered it being, but still not very good. She was raised on motherly love, but two of the biggest influences in her life right now are people whose parents failed them in one way or another and this influences her mind when it shouldn't. 

But it is fairly understandable. The curious thing about Hachi is that she strangely seems aware of how flawed a character she really is most of the time, not only in her narration that may or may not be reflecting from some point in the future, but also in the show itself. She's just unable to do break free from that mold due to lack of selfrespect and character strength, which makes her frustrating to watch. 

As such, aside from the logistics of having a child, she is not sure at all whether she has what it takes to be a parent, a trait she shares with Nana O, but for different reasons. So amidst all the panic, surprise, despair and fearful questions, seeing the impact of bad parents on the lives of Nana O and Shin is just the extra weight to throw her over the edge in making an extremely rash decision to get an abortion. All of this is to be expected, really. 

Well, Takumi has other plans. Once again he is the one character that is extremely hard to nail down, as you never really get a clear look at the priority of his reasons behind the decisions he makes. 

Because there are a lot of them. He has the image of the band to worry about and one can imagine the influence of an illegitimate child on that reputation. Then there is the previously mentioned logistics. And lastly, but not least(ly?), there is his feelings towards Hachi. 

While his reasoning is hard to decipher, there is one thing that Takumi is above all else and that is level-headed. Contrary to Hachi's emotional state and subsequent decision, you get the feeling that Takumi instantly figures out the course of action he deems most favorable and he makes the call without a split second of hesitation. Whether you like him or not, his strength of character here is admirable and worthy of respect. 

But Takumi is not just level-headed, he's also callous towards people he does not care about. In this case, that one is Nobu and Takumi without a shred of doubt drops the bomb on him in the phone call, though I also think that he's not entirely indifferent towards Nobu, as he cares for Hachi more than he would probably admit. 

Having said all this, the maelstrom encompasses more than just those two. For Nobu, this will be the ultimate test of his character: Takumi has just struck first here, so now Nobu has to retaliate with equal resolve, as Hachi is in danger of getting steamrolled by Takumi.  

I'll leave the rest of the characters for now, except for two stray observations:

Nana O has steadily been thinking of her feelings towards being a parent, or rather her inability to become one. The obvious reason would of course be her own terrible parents, but once again in this dilemma as well we see her struggle to reconcile the possibility of happiness through relationships with her own dreams and her pride not allowing her to settle for anything less than those dreams.

For the second observation, I'm just going to be blunt here. Shin is a brat. There, I said it. I have a feeling people here like him a lot, but deep down he is as immature as Hachi, because even though he is more world weary in the mundane aspects of life, emotionally he is a stunted child. And he's not the only one in the show...

> extremely rash decision to get an abortion

I don't think it's all that rash at all, given what she (thinks she) knows:  it's Takumi's, and she doesn't want any more to do with him either way.

It's kinda difficult to watch one episode a day

Okay, I'll split this into impressions of the final episode and anime overall, then the manga spoilers for all those that want it.

First, thank you too /u/Are_you_daft for creating this rewatch. This is my favourite romance-drama/jonsei, and I hope a few new people to this anime see why. :)

Now for the episode itself, we get the first flash forward (a lot more of them in the manga), and we're introduced to Hachi's child (very much a Takumi progeny) [](/s "Funnily enough Ren named their child for them."), and clued into the plot that something happened that made Nana remove herself from the lives of all those close to her. They still continue the promise of seeing the fireworks together, and always wait for Nana.

We see that everyone has grown up, and grown older. Hachi seems more refined; mature, Shin has grown a lot taller and elegant, Nobu still holds onto the rocker look outside, but washes up quite well, and Yasu is basically the same, nothing changed for him. 

Biggest part about this is the look in Nobu's eyes when he looks at Satsuki. There is still sadness and regret that this wasn't his child, or that he could have been a father to her.

Althought Hachi has grown up, her typical younger personality shines through every now-and-then, when she is shown the doll. Still a lot of unresolved tension between herself and Nobu, especially when he sees the wedding band on her finger.

Love is a fickle thing, and that is brought to the forefront when it skips back to the scene from the last episode, where Hachi is still there, crying over Shouji, or should I say that final goodbye with Shouji. Once again, closing a good to the person, and the attached memories and feelings is one of the hardest things you have to do in life, especially when you recount a lot of the good you had with someone. Hachi has to resign herself to the life she has now, and that means they both have to move forward.

Nana still playing dirty, lying to Hachi and trying to force Nobu into a confrontation with Hachi. I do like, and agree with Nana about the description of Nobu. He presents and things himself this shining knight that attaches to a wounded princess, thinking he can help her and be the hero, but in reality he selfish in that regard, thinking  he is the solution to their problem (which is shown more in his background story in the manga) but shies away when  a problem between himself and the person arises, not being able to stick it out with them in their actual time of need, or not knowing what to do but distance himself.

I do like that Shin, although being with the group/band for a limited time, fits right in now, and knows exactly the social ticks of each person.

Nobu cannot bring himself to talk to Hachi. Resigned to the idea that she is happy with her life, and he cannot cause her anymore emotional damage and thus cause her so much pain. Little bit of a catch-22 in that regard.

Hachi, Nana, Shin and Yasu finally get to meet up after so long. Bittersweet moment for all, as so much has happened, but they sweep it away for the moment they are in right now. Nana's comment about the ring is quite funny, if you remember Ren asking Takumi and shape and where he bought that ring. ;)

As for my thoughts on the show itself: Well, I do love Nana, eventhough you can easily through into the soap opera/drama aspect being overzealous, I do like character tension and this shows plays on that aspect fantastically well. Not the best representation of relationship and drama that comes with it, but one of the most mature ones: dealing with a multitude of of issues, character personalities and lack of communication that does happen a lot in relationships and friendship circles.

**Now for the manga spoilers for those that want to know:**

I'll do a basic run-down of each character:

[Ren](/s "Remember how Yasu told Ren about Nana's infliction (panic attacks and hyperventilation)? Well, he helps her own my kissing her, which seems to calm her down a lot. I mention this for a specific reason. They become engaged, write up the marriage licence (although Nana is hesitant still) He still struggles with his addiction, which is shown to be cocaine\, and his dependency on it comes up whenever he and Nana become emotionally estranged. He and Reira share a moment when she follows him back to his hometown. There is a deep connection between the two of them, but I won't say it's loved. He helps her up, and remember that photographer that snapped him and Nana the firs time? He's there again and takes a rather misleading photo between them. Gives said photo to Nana, which hurts her a lot, although she doesn't show to anyone, although Yasu knows of course. A lot of back and forth between Ren and Nana, where they finally reach an okay position in this relationship/new marriage. Find that that Ren actually acquired the drug from the director of their company, inwhich Takumi steps in like a boss and punches the guy, then tells Ren to take off some time, spend it with his new wife and get over the drug. Ren states that without the drug, he cannot play anymore (withdrawals are a bitch), so Reira runs away, thinking that'll help give him some time to recuperate, and shine some of the spotlight away from Ren. On Nana birthday, Ren is on his way to Nana with a present, gets a call from Hachi, who tells Ren that Reira ran away because of X reasons, Ren decides to chase down Reira and bring her back before seeing Nana. On the way there, he is followed by two photographers. It's the middle of winter and while speeding up to get away from them, Ren has a flash of Nana on a windowsill, turning away from him, he looses control of the car and crashes into a building. The two photographers flee, not even notifying anyone. That annoying first photographer appears, sees the car and Ren, calls an ambulance. So, Ren dies. Yep, there is your big reveal/drama in the show. Although you never see the body, apparently he moved his hands out of the way so they wouldn't get damaged. His face was caved in by the lock Nana put around his neck. Damn.")

[Nana](/s "Breaks down on Yasu. Tells him that if he cares about the relationship between her and Ren, to stop being so nice to her and making her feel that she can be dependent on him. Still suffers from panic attacks and hyperventilation. If very on-and-off again with Ren, desperately needing him, and hating him for it at the same time. Accepts the marriage proposal, but is hit with a scathing review about her past life and being abandoned by her mother. Gets past that, and garners more fans as they become increasingly popular. Has a meet-and-greet with fans, finds a young fan that has a striking resemblance to Nana, and her name happens to be Misato Uehara. ooooh! Yasu now treats her at arms length, not providing his usual close side that she relies on. She notes this, it pains her a lot, but she tries to accept it, and this is around the time that she branches off from the band and is about to try her hand at going solo (there is a reason for this). Ren dies before she can, inwhich everyone but Nana knows about, till Yasu and Misato get there and tell her. She's emotionless. Goes through the funeral without uttering a word, and is just a shell of a person. Nana moves back into that living facility they are all in, along with Hachi who moves in with Nana. Nana finally breaks down, has a panic attack and hyperventilates. Remember when I talked about Ren giving her mouth-to-mouth? Hachi does the same thing, and basically becomes a surrogate to Nana, whom she becomes completely dependent on. We don't know what else happens, but she disappears from them one day, and never contacts or sees them again. All members from Trapnest and Blast are looking for her, and that annoying photographer actually tracks her down and sends photos to them, helping them with their search, even after all these years.")

[Nobu](/s "Still not over Hachi, like at all. Doesn't date Miu, but does start dating Yuri. He's actually quite supportive and helps her out a lot with her personal life and profession, always giving her advice and generally not being his typical self like in previous relationships. Sadly Hachi keeps popping up, and Yuri keeps flipping out on Nobu because it's clear he still has feelings for her. Years later he's seen as going back to the hotel his family runs and taking it over.")

[Shin](/s "He and Reira go strong for a little bit, but Takumi has a talk with both Shin and Reira at different times, stating he doesn't care if they date or see each other, but it will hurt both bands when the public finds out. When the whole thing about Ren and Reira blows up in both bands, Reira freaks out and basically dumps Shin, although stating she loves him. He becomes cold, tells her to never speak to him again and forget they had a relationship. Doesn't take it well, goes back to the woman who taught him how to be a street walker and basically his pimp. They both get arrested in her room, media finds out and the band is put on hiatus just before their first, big concert. Yasu tells Nana to go solo while they figure out what to do with Shin. He's released, apologizes and tries to get back on track. Reira keeps trying to contact him and tell him she loves him, but he isn't having any of it, telling her that when he becomes someone worthy of that love, will get go back to her. After Ren dies, he has an argument with Reira and basically he sees it as the end them completely. In the future he's seen as a budding actor, giving up on music. He and Reira don't seem to talk anymore.")
>> ARTICLE
[Yasu](/s "After Nana freaks out on him about their relationship, he takes a step back, not being her soundboard for personal problems and effectively giving her the cold shoulder whenever she's upset. He and Miu start dating, and surprisingly he seems to be attracted to her quite a bit, and very careful about not upsetting her, reassuring her of his commitment. We're also introduced to Blast's fan group that have been around since they were in high school, especially Shion, who is their leader and have a rather deep relationship with Yasu, as well as being the only person Yasu actually relies on for private matter dealing with the band members. A lot of trust between the two, although even Yasu knows how much she loves him. She's a constant strain on Miu, who worries about Yasu and his relationship with her, and Nana. You also learn via a conversation with Shin that Yasu doesn't really care about anyone around him, he just does what they want him to do. It's misleading, as there are a lot of instances that support otherwise, but it's an interesting insight into his life. Also flashback of him as a high schooler and the start/end of his relationship with Reira. He breaks off the relationship for her, knowing how without her singing, and her love for Takumi, she'd have nothing and feel worthless. Future Yasu is still with Miu. YAY!")

[Hachi](/s "basically a back and forth between herself and Takumi. Their marriage is put on hold, but he also reassures her that either they will get married, or she can move back home and he'll financially support her and the child. Decides to stay with him, they get married and have two children. A lot of contention on which child came first, and if the one not introduced in the anime is actually Takumi's. Starts to form a strong bond with Miu, her and Nana start patching things up, and when Ren dies she movies in with Nana and takes care of her, becoming a surrogate. Future Hachi is still dedicated to Nana and desperately trying to find her. Her and Takumi are estranged and she comments about them divorcing, although she does love him.")

[Misato Uehara](/s "Becomes Blast's assistant, and a lot of questions arise when another fan called Misato Uehara, who looks like Nana is introduced. She tells them all a fortune teller gave her and name, as it'd allow her to be close to the band. She reveals to Yasu, and tells no one else in her life, that Misato Uehara is the name of Nana's half sister, although she doesn't really know why she took the name herself. She became infatuated with the band, and mainly Nana when she read her grandfather's diary after he passed, which alludes to her grandfather and Nana's grandmother having an affair. So there is a possibility that fake-name Misato may also be related to Nana. She also knows about Nana's mother, and the life she lead after she left Nana.")

[Takumi](/s "Pretty consistent, although you get a flashback to his past where his mother was incredibly sick and progressively getting worse, his older sister basically ditched the family, and his father became an abuse drunk. Takumi took on the responsibilities of an adult, as a child. Handling the house and finances, while taking care of his ailing mother and abuse father. Reira movies in across the street from him, and they become friends, mainly when everyone else puts distance from her because she's different. Reira basically falls in love with Takumi from the start, but he puts it off. High school Takumi is a dick, sleeps around, and takes out his depression from his family via violence. Realizes, after talking to Reria about how she loves to sing and nothing else, that he has nothing to offer the world or hold onto. Decides to build up a life around Reira, that she is his oasis in this horrible world. Back tot he present he's sleeping around on Hachi, eventhough he states that he cares for her a lot, seeing her and their life together as the only normal thing he has. He's put in a position where he starts sleeping with Reira, or else she'll stop singing and he'll lose his oasis. They have a BIG fight, where Reira states that she doesn't sing for Takumi, but for Ren's guitar. Hits Takumi really hard. Ren dies and Takumi takes care of Reira, who cannot accept reality. Future Takumi is seen a lot softer than his typical self, living in England with his son named Ren, still taking care of Reira.")

[Reira](/s "Basically has a falling out with Shin, forces Takumi to start sleeping with her, and strengthens her bond with Ren. Runs away when Ren is told to get off the drugs, and when he dies she blames herself, as he was going to get her. Stop singing all together, and is denial that Ren dies, constantly asking people when Ren will come back from vacation. Future Reira doesn't sing anymore, except when Takumi's son Ren plays the guitar. This is the only exception.")

Naoki is still Naoki. So that's basically it. There is a lot more I can go into detail with, especially Nana's mother and family that comes up, but that is a weirdly lengthy, but tl;dr version of the manga.

Happy to answer any questions, and of course if I am wrong, let me know and I'll correct it.

I just got here because i just finished the anime and had some questions, as everyone else apparently.

Your post is amazing! Everything makes sense, or almost everything, now.

And so it ends. Like I said in the OP, the finale really answers very few questions while posing several new ones, but we do get a general sense of how our characters' lives have progressed in the years following the events of the show. If you're dying to know what happens to the bands and the relationships, them manga does go into some depth into those topics as well as developing the character of everybody's favorite baldy. However, as the reputation for the series suggests, the ending of the manga is the nastiest cliffhanger on the face of this planet. It shouldn't even be legal. That being said, so much happens in the remainder of the manga that if you have really enjoyed the series and just want more, you definitely should check out the final 42 chapters. 

I love rewatching NANA because it serves as that reminder, for me, that anime, romance anime in particular, does not have to be defined by its cliches. Yes, there are elements to the show that would not be out of place in a daytime soap opera, but I don't see that as a bad thing. The fact that Ai Yazawa made NANA what it is, in my opinion, is good for the medium - to challenge what anime/manga can be.

Finally, I'll end with a question for manga readers - [](/s "in the flash forward, when they are talking about Ren, they are talking about Hachi's son, right? Yasu's comment about 'it being just like him' is referring to how little Ren is just like Ren Honjo?") 

Thank you to everyone who has participated in this Rewatch. I loved reading all of your posts, whether you found the show fascinating or frustrating. I hope you all at least for something you enjoyed. I'm sorry I wasn't a very active host, but it has really been a fun journey.

For the manga...
[I was re-reading it so...](/s "Through deduction, pretty much. Takumi noted in Chapter 74 that Hachi would probably want their son to come back to Japan during that Summer. Plus, in that same chapter, Takumi also said that 'As long as 'Ren' plays the guitar, Reira will sing', showing that he's similar to Honjo Ren. ")

It's done well and I haven't really see any other romance anime come close to doing this but yeah soapey

*"And it's over, like sand."*

One thing I forgot to note last episode: Nobu has a poster on his door. They inverted the colors on it probably for copyright reasons. I'm guessing it's Sid Vicious from Sex Pistols? It was Nobu who introduced them to Nana so guess he's a fan too. 

Anyway, on to the final episode.

Time jump!

* Aw, Satsuki not Sachiko. Definitely looks like Hachi and Takumi's kid. No horns apparent. :(
* Hmm, I thought it was a moth. According to Yasu, the butterfly is called the kuroageha. English name is the [Spangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilio_protenor), specifically papilio protenor demetrius. It could also be the karasuageha, or [Chinese Peacock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilio_bianor) (papilio bianor) though.
* "Why? Why?"
* Whoa Shin's a giant. Need to see him standing next to Yasu. With him shooting up that much, I doubt anyone bought the story that he was 18.
* At least 6 years. hm, long time to hold on to room 707. 70,000yen/month for 6 years is about 5 million yen, or $50,000 (very) roughly. Wonder which of them is paying it, or if it's still both.
* I've been meaning to do this for a while, but here's [the translated copy of the floor plan from episode 1](http://imgur.com/YQTSVjK). They measure room size in 'jo', the size of a tatami mat. the bedrooms are 6jo (10m^2, 107ft^2) each, the common area is 8jo (13m^2, 142ft^2) so a total of roughly 38m^2 or 410ft^2 including the bathroom and closet.
* So, we see the claw foot bathtub is indeed gone from 707. Where'd it go? We saw another one in episode 42, but that was at a hotel in London. Anyway, I prefer a standard modern tub myself.
* Wearing another ring now. Guess they went through with the marriage.

And back to the present.

* Nice view of the fireworks.
* Mhmm, on point there. White Knight syndrome. Everyone was mad at her for saying it, but it probably needed to be said for his sake too.
* [Tentoumushi Samba/Ladybug Samba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9rkvOCMKEU).
* This felt like the shortest episode ever. Ends with "Kuroi Namida", which really fits the mood.

Well, that was fun. This was my first time participating in this sort of thing. Definitely a different way of watching.
So, how about [Nana Nana Nana Nana Nana Nana Nana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/623/Shichinin_no_Nana), [Batman](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4094/Batman:_Gotham_Knight) now?
>> ARTICLE
**"Hey, Nana. That summer you longed for more than anyone, the one we couldn't get back, is right here. I'll always be waiting. For ten years... twenty years... fifty years..."**

Hate is a strong word. So to say that I hate this ending would be a little too much... but not really far off. 

It's not that it's a bad episode, on the contrary, it's stellar. We see Nana laying down some harsh words on Nobu which hurt all the more because they are not entirely untrue. Shin and Yasu look at it from the other side and they are also pretty spot on.

Which shows what kind of terrible position Nobu is in. He still loves Hachi, that much we know. I don't doubt that Hachi still loves Nobu either, perhaps even more than Takumi, whom I don't believe she truly loves. 

But unfortunately it's not that simple. The choices here are not black and white, they are white seeped through with black, black infused with white. I also don't believe each choice is truly easy, but I do think one is a whole lot easier than the other.

And here, in the ultimate do or die moment, he chooses the easy, but ~~Nobu~~ noble route. Honestly, I can't even really reject Nobu's decision here. In this situation the line between easy and considerate is blurred beyond recognition. My precious critique towards Nobu never buckling down for the hard choice and chickening out still stands. When push comes to shove, I still think Nobu is a bit of a coward. It's easy to say that Nobu chooses Hachi's happiness here, but that also implies him not believing he could make her happier than Takumi in the long run, which in turn says not a whole lot of good about Nobu.

All this was extremely well done, the imagery was fantastically on point, the soundtrack was stellar, ending with my favorite ED and the writing was excellent as usual. 

But it's still a crap ending, for one reason and one reason only: it's not an ending. The future segment gives some amount of... perspective, I guess. I wouldn't call it closure. Point being, this is not an ending, it's a start, a start to a whole new dimension to the story and it kicking up a notch. There are so many things still unresolved, which is kind of the point. There should have been a second season a long time ago, but there lies Nana's Achilles heel: the goddamn hiatus. 

---
I hate to leave it on a sour note, but the show leaves me no choice. Personally, the lack of closure knocked this show down a notch from a 10 to a 9. It has its faults, which become more apparent on re-watch, but I just can't get around the numerous well done scenes. 

There are a lot of things I still want to say about the show, most notably about the claim whether it's realistic or not (anyone who has been reading some of my posts should know that my answer is a resound, unwavering YES), but I will leave that for another time and another place (maybe the Non-Currently Airing Show Thread).

So I'll leave by saying it was a pleasure doing this with you all. Even though I missed half of the re-watch, I still read all your comments and I enjoyed the first-hand reactions to this amazing roller coaster. 

Another shout to /u/Are_you_daft for organizing these threads, they were amazingly well-put together with the references to each previous discussion. 

Hopefully I will see you all at another re-watch, or maybe, just maybe... a miracle will come through and I will see you guys for season two, with those magical words.

**"Hey, Nana..."**

>> ARTICLE
This is an eloquent response and possibly the best way to describe the anime and its ending. 

I still consider it a 10, no matter the personal disbelief I felt at the end. It's such a rewarding journey to watch, even with such an abrupt ending.

With a array of characters that are personable and have so many dimensions to them. 
>> ARTICLE
Mostly disjointed thoughts as I'm no essayist. The first section is mostly my reactions as I was watching.

# [Episode 47](http://imgur.com/a/dzfyl#49)

---
Both of them in a monologue now. And everyone's waiting in 707 for Nana O to come back at the end? I can already tell I'm not making it through this with dry eyes.

Wait.. what? Satsuki? And that's Hachi!? That's her daughter?! Aaaaaagh it's one of those time skip endings.

Yasu, strawberry glass still there. Six year old? Shin got *tall*. Nobu... didn't really change much either. Huh, even Ren's coming.

Hachi still has some of her genki spirit in her, but yeah she definitely didn't get together with Nobu in the end. Still carrying that weight, both of them.

Okay, back to the present. Poor Hachi, first she had to deal with Shji and now there's Nobu waiting for her. One thing that's easy to forget is when you break up with someone, you don't just lose a lover, you lose a friend (and maybe an entire network of people).

Nana... straight up lies to get Hachi back for herself. I don't see this going over well. Nobu's taking the wiser route and trying to exit the picture, but Nana's apparently itching for a fight. Not to say she's entirely wrong about Nobu playing the hero, but still.

Heh, Nobu's alone in 707 when Hachi comes by, naturally. I don't blame him for not answering. I guess Nana got her answer though, Nobu's not going to interfere. She tries to make the best of it by joking about Takumi, but the rest of the scene still feels off.

---
When was the last time the two Nanas were together? Feels like it's been a dozen episodes or more. It's not one last great hurrah at the festival where everyone's happy before Hachi gets swept away, it's bittersweet at best as life will keep going and they know this time won't come again. Not that it stops Hachi from trying every summer.

It's interesting that they presented the later period first so we know that Nobu and Hachi don't end up together... sort of anticlimactic, but it's fitting. For me most of the episode felt like a continuation of Hachi and Shji from earlier, meeting up with an ex and all of the regret that comes with it. Not with Nobu, but with the rest of BLAST. (Speaking of the previous episode, /u/watashi-akashi [had a great post on it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3f0yuc/spoilers_nana_rewatch_episode_46_discussion_thread/ctksuun))

On the other hand, there *wasn't* any closure between Hachi and Nobu and that's important too. Sometimes we don't get to say what we want at the appropriate times to mend the wounds and instead have to carry them with us... forever. You can have a conversation later but it's not going to have the same impact as it could have in the right moment.

---
Not really sure what more to add. Heading into this show I read a lot of people touting it as the most realistic romance anime out there, and I have to agree based on the shows I've seen so far. That comes with both good and bad aspects though, as reality can be really damn depressing at times. On the positive side it avoided a ton of the cliched tropes that just annoy me in most shows.

It's a show that I'm glad I did see but I'm in no hurry to watch again, much like Shinsekai Yori.

Thanks to everyone that participated and /u/Are_you_daft for hosting! There's a small core group of folks that have been around for basically every episode and I like when that happens.
>> ARTICLE
> It's a show that I'm glad I did see but I'm in no hurry to watch again, much like Shinsekai Yori.

Haha I felt pretty much the same way. I can easily say I will never rewatch it but I'll also admit it did a lot of things pretty uniquely!  
>> ARTICLE
We open with the exact same words we closed with last episode.  Yet another underline to their importance.  And suddenly we shift back to Nana K giving the framing narration.  And from the reversed perspective; *she's* with everyone in 707, waiting for *Nana O*.  This is interesting

Whoa.  What?  Are we in the future framing-narration time now?  Satsuki, not Sachiko?  Holy shit, tall Shin, sans bluehair.  And Satsuki seems to have a crush on him.  And she seems to be at least 7 years old or so.  And, and, and.  This is all a lot to absorb!

It's nice that the fireworks gathering in 707 has become a yearly event in all their lives, keeping them from drifting too far apart.

Nana K crying on the bench over what might have been.  Flashing back to happy times back in art school.  Not fair, show.  Not fair.  ;_;

Lying to Nana K to get her to show up.  Bold strategy, ~~Cotton~~ Nana O, let's see how it works out.

Nobu admits he still loves Nana K.  *Vehemently.*  We're really pouring it on for this last episode.

Huh?  Medicine?  Condition?  You can't open up a plot point like that on the last episode!  Arghh!

Aw, Nobu.  Chickened out.  Or maybe chose the wiser path?  I feel for ya, man.

So now we're just going to take it as read that Takumi's going to cheat on Nana K, repeatedly.  :/

Read the mood, Ginpei

"Hey, Nana"  An appropriately open-ended sign-off.

---

Well, I knew going in that this wasn't going to give me closure.  Everyone said so.  Never has the urge been stronger in me to actually go to the trouble of reading source material to get more  and I *never* do that.  Of course, that would only end in another no-closure point, as I understand it.  Maybe a miracle will occur and Ai will finish up the story and some studio will pick it up to finish it out.  Being an anime fan is suffering, sometimes.

Still, I can see why this show is so highly regarded.  It's a mature story, it pulls no punches, and it's set among postsecondary education adults.  Serious shit goes down, yet it never loses its humor.  47 episodes may seem a lot, but it's both nowhere near enough and manages to instill a sense of investment in the story over time, to the point where I felt nostalgia for a previous time in a fictional character's life, almost as though it were my own.

Bravo, _Nana_.  Here's hoping for that miracle.

>> ARTICLE
I'll join you in hoping for a miracle. 

For me, the reason why I regard Nana so highly (both manga and anime) is that I find the pacing consistent, and never tiring. The characters themselves drive the story well, without there constantly having to be an outside source to drive the story forward.

Regardless of if I like or dislike a character, they are all unique and incredibly fascinating. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to go overboard with my thoughts about the characters throughout the show, as there isn't going to be a final thoughs topic.

What are your thoughts now on Nana? Did something change after the middle part and what is your final score for Nana?
>> ARTICLE
> Did something change after the middle part

I finally got to see some romance! It had some hard to get through parts in the middle and I really struggled with the motivation to watch but that last set of episodes were pretty fun in comparison!

> what is your final score for Nana?

[](/s "Gave it a 5/10, close to a 6 though I guess")
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. I can see the problems you mentioned in the earlier threads. I mean no anime can please everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah and I can see why people enjoyed this show as much as they did.
>> ARTICLE
Just caught up and finished. 8/10. As mentioned elsewhere, I really loved the SoL and comedy elements, but I wasn't a big fan of the soap elements and how it seemed to seemingly go deeper and deeper into soap drama tension stuff. That being said, it's 2.7 above my average rating, so there's no doubt I really liked the show. I'd say the middle was the hardest part to watch, as the drama was really exploding then. I think the show might have some of my favorite characters -- I was (and still am) a big fan of Shin, though Yasu slowly rose to #1 in my charts, as he's a bit more relatable for me personally (maybe because he's one of the few characters that isn't a complete mess).

Beyond that, I think I was a bit critical of this show earlier on because of the very vocal fan base about how 'it's the best romance ever!! so realistic!!!' which kinda annoyed me. It's a great show, but some of the fanbase acts like it's objectively the best romance ever created. Doesn't leave a great taste in my mouth.




>> ARTICLE
> What are your thoughts now on Nana?

Some parts are difficult to get through but I think it's a good story. Didn't focus as much on the music aspect as I would have liked but it's not that kind of show. Definitely not for everyone but if you want a grounded drama it's one of the better ones.

> what is your final score for Nana?

It was straddling the 8/9 border for me but bumped it up for avoiding a lot of the cliches that plague your average series.
>> ARTICLE
I was a little more critical on some of the dramatic aspects of the show this time around, but I still wholeheartedly love the show and manga. 
>> ARTICLE
I already voiced a little of that above. I'll add this would be a more solid 8 (or maybe 9) for me if a little more focus was placed on the music. With the solid writing in this show, this could have been [Beck](http://myanimelist.net/anime/57/Beck) done right.
>> ARTICLE
Did you watch Sakamichi no Apollon or Nodame Cantabile?

Both have romance and music. Rated both as a 9.
>> ARTICLE
The former's next on my list of music shows to hit up. I might give Beck another shot after that and then rewatch Nodame.
>> ARTICLE
Sakamichi is great, it's more heartwarming than Nana (not that hard, though), although the characters are not as rounded. It's also similar to Nana in that I was not completely satisfied with its ending, but for totally different reasons: the manga ending of Sakamichi is one of the best I've ever read and I wish that they adapted the whole thing. 
>> ARTICLE
Sakamichi no Apollon has been on my PTW for a while. Might check out Nodame Cantabile later on, though definitely looks like a different kind of music compared to Beck and Nana. ;)
>> ARTICLE
Nodame's almost entirely classical, more of a grown-up Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso or Hibike! Euphonium.
>> ARTICLE
Holy Hell Batman! I honestly thought we had another 2 episodes (49). I took a peek at work and freaked out when it said end. I can't believe it. It ended so suddenly. We really didn't get a lot of info from the peek into the future. Alot didn't really happen in this episode either. Nana kind of accepts Hachi and Takumi, Nobu is still in love with her, and everyone is just happy to see Hachi again. At least she didn't name her daughter Sachiko. I'll start on the manga tomorrow. Thanks for the rewatch guys, even though this was my first time watching this

Happy to hear you enjoyed it a lot. The manga is going to take you on a wild ride, and if you want, when you finish it and want someone to talk to, drop me a message. Always happy to talk about this anime/manga.

That's basically what I know of, of the status of the manga, aka never getting finished. Only thing she's done since then was a Junko's Place in 2013 and that's it.
>> ARTICLE
That really sucks. I'll probably start reading it nevertheless sometime later this year but man will I be disappointed if it won't ever be continued, I really want some closure to this story.

>> ARTICLE
I, and ever fan out there, feel you on that. It's incredibly saddening that we'll more than likely get an ending to this beautiful story.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching Nana for the very first time and I love it. I love how real it is. It's one of those stories that everyone can relate to on some level. I myself could relate to different aspects and situations of almost every main character, we've all been in love, heartbroken, or directionless in life.

While the show might not've always looked the best, it had some A+ writing. Nana took me on a rollercoaster of emotions that I really haven't been on since Clannad & After Story, and I loved it. It made me laugh, cry(buckets), made me angry, and truly care, which is hard to do in any story anime or not. I could go on all day about this show, but I won't. Instead I'll finish up by saying I enjoyed this show more than any other in the past year, it has become one of my all time favorites. 

Also, Shin deserves a spinoff. lol
>> ARTICLE
Glad to hear it! I agree that it may not have been the most beautifully animated show, but the story it tells is timeless and masterful. There's a reason why after reading the manga twice and watching the series 4 times, I still get the itch to revisit it every now and then. My dilemma right now is when to introduce my daughter to the series, haha. 

Anyway, have you thought about reading the manga?
>> ARTICLE
I know exactly how you feel, as soon as I finished it I was ready to start back at episode 1, haha. Hmm, well if your daughter is old enough to understand most of it, then I'd say introduce her as soon as possible, lol. Honestly this is a show I'd recommend to anyone that has a mature attitude, male or female. That's just how good Nana is, in my opinion. 

Actually I have thought about reading the manga, I looked into finding it right after I made my post on this thread, lol. I hope it answers some more questions after the end of the show. 

Also, I'm curious, outside of Nana & Nana, haha, who was your favorite character?
>> ARTICLE
The manga answers some questions, but it raises a lot more and then it just ends before answering most of them. But it's definitely worth a read!

My favorite characters from the anime would be Shin and Takumi. Shin because he's wise beyond his years on many subjects, yet naive on others, which creates a great dichotomy in character development. Takumi because he's so polarizing, yet as the story progresses and we learn more about him, he becomes a more relatable character. Yasu is on the list too, but I think everybody has a thing for Yasu.
>> ARTICLE
Should I reread the entire manga or just start from where the series ends? Did the anime change anything important or leave anything out?
>> ARTICLE
The anime ends on chapter 42, so just start the manga on 43. Nothing was skipped in the adaptation except for some funny messages from the manga ka, so you won't miss anything.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is wonderful, thanks a lot! I can't wait to start it.

**FINALE**

Nana^^2 intro

Is that her kid o.o woah she's a mom!

Shin's hair back to normal

Adorable daughter...satisfying to see :)

Gahh let her go Nobu...

After 47 episodes I just want this crying scene tomove along haha....I'm terrible :/

Better if they don't meet...

NANA being unfair to Nobu :/

Nana talking about betrayal but it's NANA that actually does it

Gotta feel for Nobu, he needs to just move past this

Hmmm that's the end? I know the manga goes further but still.

I guess showing her kid was good enough for an ending!

**Final Thoughts**

I won't go too deep into my thoughs of the show since I'm still a bit scarred from what happened last time haha

It had like a reverse parabola for me haha started off ok, got pretty bad in the middle but ended up being okay again at the end

The romance finally showed up but for 47 episodes it was just hard to get by with just a couple moments

This show does relationships pretty well as in they show it from a lot of different views, stages and levels of stability. Not sure any other show has been close to managing that!

Won't say anything bad about it since I've learned my lesson :p

Thanks for organizing the rewatch! Probably would never have watched this show anyway and would not have completed if it wasn't in a watch thread haha
>> ARTICLE
Since you're afraid to, I'll throw in my two cents haha.

I really didn't like either of the Nanas' characters. I couldn't connect with either of them. I'd much rather have watched a show about Sachiko (Any of them, haha).

Also, as you had said before, this show is far from realistic, and despite the hype, romance anime definitely isn't ruined for me. It really just felt like a JDrama in anime form.

What redeemed the show for me was the attention to detail, both in the art and story telling. Even though I didn't care much for the story, I have to admit real effort was put into it. There's so much going on in each scene that isn't stated, but if you look back after it's revealed later you're like "whoa."

I'll give it a 8/10. Though tempted to give it a 7, because, well... 7.
>> ARTICLE
The thing with many critique in /r/anime is that they usually ding an anime for not being in line with their own expectation while ignoring that the makers are aiming for something else. Someone who wants straight love story with happy ending out of NANA will be sorely disappointed but that is not a valid justification of an anime being bad. Furthermore these "critics" usually cannot satisfactorily elaborate and elucidate *why* exactly the anime is bad. Such "review" deservedly get downvoted to oblivion.*

Anyways. I think NANA did romance best out of all anime I've seen but obviously far way short of depicting real romance for most people due to the format. 

Anime and Manga being mainly visual medium simply cannot explore the inner thoughts of the characters with enough elaboration to make them even remotely seem like real people. I usually have to turn to literature such as those employing stream of consciousness to get anything close to how real people think and feel. 

PS
My personal take is this. Anime is made by very passionate people working very hard and paid very little. We here at /r/anime usually dont even pay a cent to watch them. If we want to criticize an anime then it would behoove us to at least put forth some effort in writing it. Instead I see many people put less thought in their reviews that I did in writing this post. That's just disrespectful.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing that seemed unrealistic to me was the compressed time scale  the whole thing (apart from the flash-forward in the last episode) only spans about, what, four to six months?  Still within the realm of possibility, even so, especially for people of that age.
>> ARTICLE
Start of the series is mid-March, ends in October. About 7 months aside from the flashbacks in the first few and the jump forward at the end. Might feel a bit rushed but I've moved from one coast of North America to the other and back in less time.

> Since you're afraid to, I'll throw in my two cents haha.

Brave man :O

> I'd much rather have watched a show about Sachiko

That's a pretty good point and I highly agree. Sachiko would have brought the romance! Seeing her struggle with her feelings knowing Shouji had a gf would have been nice to see in detail.

>  It really just felt like a JDrama in anime form.

Do JDramas feel like soap operas? 

> I'll give it a 8/10. Though tempted to give it a 7, because, well... 7.

A bit, though better written. They're usually also based on manga, so have a proper beginning, middle, and end rather than dragging on and on as long as there's ratings like soaps.

Sadly it's the end of that arc, as a new chapter/story starts right off the bat.

I just finished the anime and I read there are differences. I want to read the manga but should I? Is it worth it since the manga hasn't been finished yet? 
>> ARTICLE
It depends on what you're looking for. The anime is a 100% faithful adaptation of the manga up until chapter 42, where the anime ends. Chapters 43 - 84 continues the story and further develops many of the characters (namely Yasu). The usual warning I give to people who want to read the manga is that it ends at the worst cliffhanger imaginable. Is it worth reading though? I thought it was. I think if you really liked the anime, you should definitely read the manga, and who knows, maybe one day Ai Yazawa will finish it.
>> ARTICLE
He. No rapey club scene, but straight into a beach segment. Bet you didn't see that one coming, did you?

Jokes aside, quite a lot happened in this episode. Once again Nana K's personality is on full display: dramatic, naive and aimless, but I'll leave that subject alone for now, though everything I've said about her is laid out again here. 

Instead, let's turn the spotlight to the two big factors in Nana K's life so far. 

Junko is, by all accounts, an audience substitute. She is the voice of the show and its audience, the ground to which the show's circuitry is attached, the ocean level to the highs and lows. To Nana K she is like a big sister: caring, calm, collected and solid, but not afraid to tell Nana K what she really thinks. At this point in the show, it's Junko who keeps everyone in check. But as she says herself, this won't be the case in the future (instead, later there will be another character on Nana O's side who will fulfill the role to an extent, arguably even more likable).

So with Junko as the big sis, or even mother, and Nana K as the naive teen, where does that leave Shoji? Well, sort of in the middle. Shoji is about where you expect a reasonable 20 year old to be. He has dreams, but is not as organized and worked out as Junko or Kyosuke, whom I'll be neglecting since he's basically male Junko. Shoji is a responsible person with a good head on his shoulder, but he can fly off the handle and act rashly and stupidly, as demonstrated by his fight with Nana. In almost everything, he is the halfway point between Nana and Junko and instead of hovering over Nana K like Junko does, he should be able to walk alongside her. In other words, he is exactly whom Nana K needs at her side... which in and of itself is not a good sign at all. 

Okay, so we're done here, right? Well... no. I'm sorry. I lied. I said two big factors, but we know it's actually three. I'm not going to delve into the personality of mr. Asano, a guy who by all accounts is still a despicable person despite showing common decency to Nana. 

Instead, it's more interesting to note the impact their chance encounter has on Nana. We expect her to act the drama queen, but instead she actually manages to close off that chapter of her life in a remarkably dignified fashion: don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. It's unexpected and it demonstrates obvious character growth, something I think most, if not all of us were hoping for. 

At least, that's what we're hoping. The more pessimistic among us will say that her capacity to put the hurt behind her so calmly is out of character and that she's only moving on so easily because she's found a new love to sink her soul in. Instead of cleaning up the mess in her heart, she's simply packed up and left for greener pastures, leaving the mess for another time. 

I would love to say 'YOU'RE WRONG!' to those people, but the fact of the matter is that it makes too much sense to reject outright. Being of a compromising nature myself, I'd say there is probably a little of both in there (*way to pick a side, pussy*). Whatever the case, only time will tell which side is right.

Tomorrow we will conclude Nana K's run-up to her fateful meeting, as well as start with Nana O's entirely different past. In many ways, Nana O is a far more intriguing person than Nana K... for better, or for worse.
>> ARTICLE
I agree about Shoji, he's probably one of Nana's better options right now though I think it would be best if she tried to figure herself out first rather than relying on him for growth.

> The more pessimistic among us will say that her capacity to put the hurt behind her so calmly is out of character and that she's only moving on so easily because she's found a new love to sink her soul in. Instead of cleaning up the mess in her heart, she's simply packed up and left for greener pastures, leaving the mess for another time.

Personally, I'm skeptical that Asano is out of the picture for good. I could see them having another chance encounter down the road where she decides to seek comfort from him if she's in a rough spot.
>> ARTICLE

Nail, head. That's what I meant with 'which is in and of itself not a good sign'. The fact that she needs someone like him at her side is evidence that she needs to grow as a person first. But even though that would be best, it's not in the cards at that point.

I'll elaborate on this point when the time comes, it's Nana O's turn first tomorrow.

I should appreciate that, I just wanted Asano to suffer a bit somehow I guess haha
>> ARTICLE
> I should appreciate that, I just wanted Asano to suffer a bit somehow I guess haha

I think this is a really important thing to recognize as to why Nana is praised for being realistic.

When we get hurt by other people, most importantly by people we trusted, we tend to resent them for it, wishing that they get their comeuppance and that we're there to witness it. 

But in real life, it rarely if ever turns out that way. Most likely we won't encounter those people again. When we do, time has a way of changing people and softening emotions: such encounters are usually peculiar affairs in which few emotions are expressed, as most of the time people have moved on and few of us are able to hold a grudge for a long time, much less act on it towards a person that is not the same as the one we were hurt by. 

I really loved how Nana handled the entire scene. It might not be what we want, but it is what most likely would happen.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I don't feel Asano wronged Nana at all.  He never promised her anything and never delivered much either.  And it's not as though he tricked her or lied to her at all; she knew what the deal was the instant she saw that ring.

Who he did wrong, on the other hand, was his wife.  Though, as others are pointing out, it's not considered the crime of the century in Asia as it is here either, for whatever that's worth.
>> ARTICLE
He wronged his wife and took advantage of a highschool girl. She thought it was love at the time and he let her believe that while pretty much just using her :/

Idk maybe I see it differently as a girl but I can't stand his character.

>Satisfying > Realistic in my books though haha

They rarely go for that "feels good" approach where assholes get their "just reward" .. or are real assholes in the first place.

 Characters simply have to deal with their issues if they get shafted. And to some, like myself, this kind of thing, as shown with Asano's scene in this episode, is just so much more satisfying because of it.

BTW, relationship between unmarried older man and way younger female is considered normal in many parts of Asia. When I was Asano's age I was paired with a girl still in junior high. Her parents encouraged the relationship and asked me not to break it off just because I'm going to the US. 

My american friends thought I should be fuckin' jailed :-)

It's just a different world, a different mentalities.
>> ARTICLE
* Ah, dodged the night club cliche. Was expecting something bad to happen there.
* Shortest beach episode ever.
* Because Nana thought Shouji was becoming like Junko (who she calls Jun-chan), she starts a running gag of calling him Shou-chan in this episode. Junko jokingly calls him Shou-chan as well, though Nana never calls him that in front of Junko before then on screen. I wonder if a scene was cut. Very minor discontinuity though.

Surprising closure on the Asano thingy.
>> ARTICLE
This is a bit early but it really doesn't matter in the end :p

**Episode 3**

I think Nana might end up being an anime where I won't be able to find a character I like haha just getting that vibe

Episode 3 and we get the beach episode? 

This opening has a really great start to it

Friendzoned but we know they get together so no worries

Shoji being a lot cooler then I thought...gonna be hard to watch when he does something wrong

My view on this series is that everyone will end up doing something wrong/annoying at one point at least haha

Looks like Shoji was at the end of his rope there, can't really fully blame him, Nana seems frustrating to deal with ha

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO not him...

Guy is still married and yes you should hate him!!

Guess it ended good? Not satisfying enough but she seems to be over him at least.








>> ARTICLE
>This is a bit early 

Yeah, I'm going to experiment with different times over the next few days and see which works best for the majority of people. And you're probably right that it doesn't actually matter.

Don't say that when we haven't even met half of the main cast yet!

>Episode 3 and we get the beach episode? 

A beach episode without the sleaze shots!

>My view on this series is that everyone will end up doing something wrong/annoying at one point at least haha

It'll probably be easier to watch if you go in with this mentality, haha.

>Guess it ended good? Not satisfying enough but she seems to be over him at least.

I don't know how I would have preferred her to react when Asano showed up. Even though Nana might still be a bit delusional about their relationship, I feel she handled it in a way that shows a surprising amount of growth since just last episode.
>> ARTICLE
> Don't say that when we haven't even met half of the main cast yet!

Well so far so bad? Haha I hope there's someone I can like. I enjoy seeing Kyosuke but like /u/watashi-akashi said he's just male Junko lol

Refreshing :)

No, you'll almost certainly genuinely like two of the people introduced tomorrow and I think only two really important characters frequently get hated, one of which is Nana K. 

The general saying I have for Nana is that you'll love every character at one point, except for one, and that you'll hate every character at one point, except for one. 

But for most the balance is more weighted towards like :)

Ouch. Yeah heard it before but that's gotta suck having an MC that's hated.

Getting the beach episode out of the way early here. And not your typical kind of beach episode either, we get a better idea of Nana K's personality out of all of this.

I get her sentiment to move to the city and stick with her friends, but sometimes life really doesn't want you do push in one direction and we see that here. I'm guessing that's only going to continue and we'll see her struggle more once we get back to the present.

Maybe it's just the subtitles or I missed some kind of joking tone to it, but Shoji seems like a jerk when he was alone with Nana in the hotel room. "Oh, I might force myself on you." No, asshole, you don't just say that like it's something that *happens* and there's nothing that a guy can do about it.

So far I feel like Nana K's going to have a rough time through the series, but with luck she'll make it through and become comfortable with herself.
>> ARTICLE

Yeah it was a bit weird. I think he was trying so that he's interested in her trying to get him out of the friendzone from her eyes...but yeah weird way of doing it.

> So far I feel like Nana K's going to have a rough time through the series

Very rough times ahead I think :/

>> ARTICLE
Ok, so the club went not much of anywhere, except, hilariously, for Nana to latch onto the DJ as a possible target.

Everyone up and suddenly decides to go away to Tokyo for art school, and poor Nana's left behind.  Of course she immediately applies everywhere to go along with them, which is kinda sweet and kinda sad.  She still has no purpose or direction in life aside from her social circle, it seems.  But, inevitably, events and her own academic mediocrity conspire to wreck any such plans.

Shoji finally snaps at her insistence on keeping him on a leash he chafes at.  Can't say you didn't deserve that at least a little, Nana.

And the amazing coincidence for this episode appears:  Asano just pops up on the street at random the moment Nana's alone.  Well, at least it makes for a bittersweet scene where they seem to make their peace with the past.

Couple of specific notes:

**Asano.**  People seem to think he deserves to be flayed or something.  That might or might not be true from the point of view of his wife.  But from Nana's point of view, it's pretty unjustified.  She knew what the deal was the whole time, because she saw that ring from the start and still went with it all.  He didn't break any promises to her, nor lie to her, nor trick her.  And she seems to have realized that long ago.  Today's episode merely saw her coming to emotional terms with it.

**Kyosuke.**  Some are saying he's nothing more than a male Junko, but from what I can see, he's actually quite a bit more level-headed than she is.

[**OLIVIA.**](http://myanimelist.net/people/5081/OLIVIA)  Apparently, this is who performed the vocal on that end theme song.  I'm normally not that curious about this sort of thing, but both the English and the Japanese in it seemed to be spot-on, and I rarely hear that from any one performer.  Nice work!
>> ARTICLE
> Can't say you didn't deserve that at least a little, Nana.

This is going to be a repeating theme, going forward, haha. Poor Nana...

> it makes for a bittersweet scene where they seem to make their peace with the past.

I really liked their last scene together this episode. The fading of the city lights and the singling out of their two silhouettes was a really nice touch.

>OLIVIA

Just a bit of a warning, maybe I'm overly cautious, but on her MAL page there is a link to her VA role in the show and that page has some *huge* spoilers for both the show and the manga. Aside from that though, her voice is gorgeous! I absolutely love all the songs she did for the show.

I had this on my to-watch list for the longest time and I'm already trying to resist binging it. I can easily see the maturity of this show and it's really refreshing to see realistic characters in an industry dominated by tropes, archetypes, and cliches. I knew we'd encounter Mr. Asano sooner or later, but I didn't think we'd encounter him *before* the story begins, and it was hardly dramatic--a good thing to say the least. Nana was able to handle the encounter with maturity and used it to move on. Good job! 

The art style works for me and I enjoy the reaction faces. I can't wait to see more from the other Nana. Now the only question remains: to binge or not to binge? 
>> ARTICLE
My first time through the show, I binged it in three days, so I'm in no position to tell you not to!

And so once again in what I expect will be a common occurrence in this watch-through, I'm left thinking 

"God-damnit, Nana!"

It's frustrating - in a good way, narratively - to see Nana making such childish mistakes. She doesn't seem to have an actual presence of her own, and just latches on to the nearest personality for both purpose and validation. She's still the same way in the present-day of episode 1, though it's *such* an obvious avenue for character growth that I'll think a lot less of the show if things don't change in that regard sooner or later.

~~Kaiki~~ Kyosuke seems the most mature of the bunch, which probably means that we're going to see the least of him as time passes. Still, I'm surprised that both he and Junko are rooting for Nana to get together with Shouji. But then friends - especially friends who are couples - are always going to root for other members of the group to find romantic happiness, even when said members might not be ready for it.

Asano remains a bit of a dick. He's not portrayed as a simple *monster*, which I'm glad to see, but he just...doesn't care much about Nana one way or the other. Which, given their relationship and Nana's obvious personal helplessness, is pretty cold.

There's little else to do.  That is, unless he plans on dumping his wife (!) for Nana.  Any warmth he shows would only be a false hope for her and cause her more pain.

Nana has a tattoo of a red lotus? I am not surprised that she serves Zaheer.

More Sachiko! I'm glad they kept rolling with her. Use of Hachi's spreading to the store, I see, and Mizukoshi's joke about how Jun should have been named Kyuu (9) is something I now get thanks to the last couple episodes of Gintama.

Even Junko's concerned about her friend's flirtatious nature, she knows her too well. Fortunately Hachi's not *completely* oblivious to her own actions and I'm glad she's thinking about what she truly wants at this point.

I'm pretty sure that the table and benches in the window weren't there in the first episode, I remember a small desk facing out the window. Guess we'll have to see what changes between now and... whenever that is. [Speculation](/s "Maybe one of the Nanas continues living there by herself after the other one moves on for some reason. Maybe Hachi used that desk to write the letter we're hearing?")

Hah, Nobu out of nowhere. I love the slow-motion boot to the head, extra style points. And while there's nothing between Yasu and Nana, I wouldn't be surprised if Nobu's more than a little in love with her at this point. I love that she started singing without any set lyrics in mind; singing is a primal need for her and words aren't necessary for that.

I've reached the point where I *really* want to watch more of the show, but will be holding myself to the schedule.

Damn the ED changed for this episode, that's good since it'd be weird if the Trapnest song played after Nana's iconic song. And they both have very different tones...it just wouldn't mix well.
It also serves as a scene for Yasu too 

Good episode, NANA has to get a band together to fill the void Ren left.

The interesting thing about these long series is that they focus on build up before they get realllly really intensive.

**Episode 9**

Asking if she wants to go out for a walk haha still seeing her as a pet :p

And beer that early?!

That table is awesome

Yes more Nobu!!

Hearing the OP twice in one EP I'm down

Might be my favourite episode so far, first time I really wanted to see the next ep!

It's a little odd that the tattoo was never mentioned till now.  Is it the first time Nana K saw it?  Usually that kind of thing supposedly draws a big suspicious reaction, since in Japan tattoos and Yakuza are nearly a one-to-one thing.

Haha, the opposites-chemistry between the two Nanas is pretty fun!

When Nana O was sitting on the river bank, saying the gas guys would be there that morning, I was picturing them knocking on the door at that very moment and leaving, not to return for another week or two.

Dang, the sense of style in this show.  Nana K lookin' good in yet another outfit!

Jun, Jun, Jun.  You're getting to be downright cynical, you know that?  Nana K isn't flirting, she's just naturally cute.  But she should watch that, it's true.

Nana K wondering how to "treat Shoji right".  Listen, girl.  Start with the old saying of "keep his belly full and his balls empty" and you're 90% there.

But I'm glad to see her getting a little more self-aware, at least to the point where she realizes it wouldn't be a good idea to go out with Mizukoshi, and ponders about how well things are going in her own life, though she wavers between "well" and "not so well".  She's starting to feel something's missing, even if she can't identify it yet.  Small steps, that's good.

I was fully expecting Nana O to explain that it was a flat-pack table-and-benches set or something.  It's still a little eye-popping that she could design and build that whole thing in one day, even with the help of her charm and some construction guys.  And on top of that, she made dinner, received a shipment, and dealt with paperwork.  Damn, you productive, Nana O.  If you ever drop out of musicianship, you'd make a great administrative assistant.

Aaaaand Nobu returns to the picture.  He's either a lot more into the band or into Nana O than he let on before.  (Also, what the hell is that strip of material connecting his knees??)

Nana O herself seems quite torn about the whole thing.  She clearly likes being in that band, and having bandmates that support one another in that pursuit.  But her hardened practical instinct says Nobu should just settle into the cushy life he was born into.

Using an amp?  I guess the Nanas have no neighbors in that big building.  Or perhaps the next episode starts with some angry pounding on their door

>Dang, the sense of style in this show. Nana K lookin' good in yet another outfit!

In today's episode of "Learn more about Ai Yazawa": Ai Yazawa was a fashion school drop out before she started working as a manga ka.

I'm not sure, he was pretty into the band in episode 5 when he was trying to convince NANA to go to try their luck in Tokyo together.

>Also, what the hell is that strip of material connecting his knees??

You just don't get fashion, man.

>In today's episode of "Learn more about Ai Yazawa": Ai Yazawa was a fashion school drop out before she started working as a manga ka.

Huh.  Makes sense.  Probably has a lot to do with the long-skinny art style too  all those fashion illustrations seem to be like that.

>I'm not sure, he was pretty into the band in episode 5 when he was trying to convince NANA to go to try their luck in Tokyo together.

Yeah.  Still, though, driving 8 hours (!), hauling all her stuff, showing up with no backup plan other than to crash in her apartment and play her a demo tape.

>You just don't get fashion, man.

Guilty!

It's Japan. More likely a passive aggressive "Loud music should not be played at night" note in the entryway and a few disapproving glares.

**Nana episode 17:**


I absolutely adore Hachi's family. Her mom is especially cool.
It's incredibly sad that NANA had such a poor childhood, but it contributed to the way she is now.

Another thing I really enjoyed seeing this episode was the flashback to the making of the band. Really funny seeing how NANA and Ren were back then.

And finally the concert, absolutely adore this song and motherfucking REINA!!!!! When I first saw this episode, I really wanted to see more of her. My first prediction was that REINA stole ren's heart... You'll see if I predicted correctly. 

But anyways... I wonder if Ren saw her...it looked like their eyes met but that may be just animation perspective thing.

Hope you guys enjoyed this episode as much as I did! I really want to watch the next episode...

I'm no performer, but from what I hear it's impossible.  You're standing there trying to concentrate on not screwing up, with blazing stage lights in your face, and there's no light at all on the audience  can't see jack.  (Unless someone turns on the house lights)
>> ARTICLE
> I wonder if Ren saw her

I don't think he has, yet. With how emotional he seemed at Yasu's place, I'd expect him to have at least missed a beat if he had. I get the feeling it's going to be like Ren and Nana's first encounter. Everyone else is moving with the music, whereas the Nanas are just standing there staring, which draws his attention to them.

I wonder if Hachi's imagination will be spot-on about him jumping down from the stage. Her dreams have been right about other things, to the point that it's scary.

Why not? It's not like this show is being tragic for the sake of being tragic. If anything, this show is extremely true to life. So far, everything has unfolded exactly how it would have in real life. And while true that there are no happy endings in real life, couples do get back together all the time.
>> ARTICLE
I agree for the most part. The show isn't trying to be tragic for the sake of tragedy. In terms of realism, the events that occur may not happen in real life but the way the characters deal with it are fairly grounded and in that way it's realistic.

I disagree with a lot of that but don't really want to write up on it :/

Just came here to say this was the best episode so far and after today, this show is already a 10/10 for me regardless of what happens afterwards. That last scene, when Nana said "Why am I crying?" made me choke up as well. And then, even though I knew it was coming, when the camera panned over to NANA and her falling tears, I was literally shaking.
>> ARTICLE
God me too. This episode tore me up, the hand holding and everything...such an emotional connection. Fucking love this show.

I'm finally back and caught up, wow those last few episodes were something...

I'm happy we got to see some actual Ren, I didn't really care but all that teasing got annoying

Also happy Nana finally knows a bit of the story!

**Episode 17**

Wonder if NANA is downplaying it or she really doesn't care about meeting Ren

Hearing Shouji being brought up still hurts :/

NANA really does know what to say :O

Nana asking about parents...rough subject :/

Happy to see NANA happy and not mad :p

Was scared she wouldn't show up :/

The OP and the ED for this show is amazing each time it plays

Both Nana's crying :(

Well that was a strong episode to come back to!

>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of sad that I didn't get to read your thoughts on the past few episodes. Hopefully you were mentally prepared and didn't cry over the breakup. 

Just wondering, does the version you're watching have "A Little Pain" as the ED or is it "Starless Night"?
>> ARTICLE
Super prepared and no tears were shed, was more angry then anything else but I was actually rooting for Sachiko and Shoji more.

A Little Pain, is that bad?

There are dozens of us!  Dozens!

No, that's good. That's the way it should be. Apparently most of the international versions of NANA had some issues with licensing and A Little Pain was completely replaced by Starless Night.

Really? The songs don't sound much alike and the lyrics aren't similar either. Where did you learn this?

That brutal, just listened to Starless Night and it's nowhere near as good as A Little Pain!
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say it's *worse* than A Little Pain, for me, the overall feeling of Starless Night is just wrong for the beginning episodes. Once we switch over to Starless Night when we're supposed to in the series, it becomes appropriate and it falls into place, but A Little Pain is perfectly suited for these first 19 episodes and having it replaced by Starless Night is a shame.

Yeah it fits perfectly and I've grown to love it...will miss it...

I think you need to join the Yasu group now. 

It's little things in the show that really bring across a little realism. Hachi recounting her time at university and Shouji coming up is one. Those who hurt you, those memories sting the most. Everyone wants to replace those memories.

Yasu's  the best :p

Hachi family best family. I love how Hachi has a little bit of ever family members personality. Really brings them all together.

Big props to Nana for opening herself up to Nana, seeing how she grew up in such a welcoming family, and that pained look at the mention of Ren. The flashbacks are happening now.

Little moment of Yasu is all we need. Of couse his band would be named after something relating to him.

Back to Nana smoking his cigarettes again. Ooooooh.

Concert is nice, get some Reina action, and the tears and hand holding. Getting more glimpses into the shared connection between the two Nanas as the show continues. Once again, same person, two different outlooks.

Episode 17. Gonna be something special since it's "Jyuu NANA"?

* Not even going to comment on Hachi wanting to find a boyfriend to get over a boyfriend.
* Did they lock the door? Turn off the iron/stove/etc?
* Back on the 200 Series shinkansen. Weather's much better in May!
* Hahaha, I didn't even think about Nana meeting Hachi's family.
* Nana's finally opening up about her past (about time). Seeing Hachi's hometown had more of an effect on her than I expected.
* Ah the symbolism of Nana's band singing "Rose" with the chorus of **"I need your love"**, and Ren's band singing "A Little Pain" with the chorus of **"I'm here waiting for you"** finally struck me.
* What are you doing, Nanas? The lyrics said "No need to cry!"

One goof with the US/International versions is the ED should be "A Little Pain" until episode 19, but they used "Starless Night" instead, ruining some of the symbolism IMO. Licensing issues \*sigh\*.
In this episode, it's a seamless transition from the concert scene into the ED credits in the original, whereas the US/International versions have a sudden jump to "Starless Night".

The dub on Hulu has used Starless Night from episode 1, which definitely bothered me because there's a pretty significant tone shift when we switch EDs. I wonder if it is because of licensing issues since Starless Night is by the same artist, but then again I know nothing about the topic.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Subbed version on Netflix as well (and the US DVDs it's ripped from).

I don't know the details either, information on it as rather slim. According to a few forum posts I've found here and there, all of the overseas licensed versions don't have the original ending. Or at least for the US, Australian, and French versions.

At least it's not like Kodomo no Omocha, where any time TOKIO's "Jyuukuji no News" song plays, even inside the episode, they cut all the sound (including dialog!) completely. I'm glad they were at least able to keep the song inside the music shop, at the concert, etc. for Nana.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this is the first time I've seen Kodocha mentioned on reddit. I never watched the anime for it, but that sounds horrid.

Kodocha was one of the series I used to hook people on anime back in the day of VHS fansubs. Was excited when it came out on DVD in the States, then oh so pissed. Returned it.

Side note, "A Little Pain" reminds me a lot of Shiina Ringo's "[Gibbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zldBTSx9JpE)".

I looked Shiina Ringo up on wikipedia (forgive me) and apparently she was the model for Nana Osaki!

Ha, that's awesome. Shiina's my favorite Japanese artist, and I was just thinking how much her songs would fit in for Nana.

You were meant to watch NANA. It is fate.
>> ARTICLE
More Hachi growth! She realizes she doesn't pay attention to things unless she's interested in them, hopefully she'll be more aware of the rest of the world in the future.

And Nana gets to meet Hachi's family, nice. She was surprisingly demure to everyone, particularly their mother. It's a little odd that Hachi hasn't really said anything to her family about her life, it seems, good or bad. Nothing about who she's living with or that she broke up with Shji, even though that was probably a week or two ago at this point (Sachiko's birthday was May 5th, the concert was the 26th). Nana finally opens up to Hachi too!

Again, I really love the use of color [in these flashbacks.](http://i.imgur.com/wVNmIs6.png) Muted blue tones everywhere aside from the cigarettes. I'm still not sure what that says about Nana's choice to start smoking them in the present.

I was concerned that Nana would just skip the concert when I saw her go for a smoke beforehand and I'm glad she decided to go. It feels like the Nanas against the world at this point, but at least they have each other.
>> ARTICLE
> More Hachi growth! 

Love seeing that!!

> I'm still not sure what that says about Nana's choice to start smoking them in the present.

Yeah I thought it was a Ren thing but maybe it's just she wants to think of the "good ol days"?
>> ARTICLE
> She realizes she doesn't pay attention to things unless she's interested in them

I think she's being a little too hard on herself there, she really didn't have any interest in Ren, so it's totally understandable that she'd skim over that stuff.

It's posable to marathon a show by accident. I finish the episode that everyone else is on, and then I think to myself, "What else am I doing today?" and the answer is, "Nothing" so I just keep watching.

"What if he didn't actually lose the key?  What if Nana's been holding on to it?"  Oh, Nana K.  Can't tell if going along with the analogy or genuinely that clueless.

Curious how Nana O is so assiduously avoiding letting on that Trapnest might mean anything special to her, in front of Nana K.  You have to wonder what play Nana O has in mind here.  Just go and act like it ain't no thang from beginning to end?  If so, why go at all?  Go and maybe reunite with Ren?  Then what would all that acting have been for?

"My older sister keeps piling on the pounds."  "They look so alike!"  Good thing Nana K can't read minds.  Also, stick-thin character design + fat sister = someone actually looks normal!

Totally normal suburban house.  "Wow, what a fancy house!"  Nana O is truly an urbanite.

Haha, another episode of Fun With Subs Vs. Dubs.  Nana O is met with Nana K's freaky-looking "fake & bake" younger sister Nami, and she thinks to herself in reaction:

>Dub:  "*Home tan!*"

>Sub:  "*Black!*"

Looks like a little cultural translation was in order, kek.  Immediately after, we get a difference that makes the dub a bit of a head-scratcher.  Mom proclaims the two Nanas extremely different despite the same name, and then adds:

>Sub:  "She's such an annoying girl!"

>Dub:  "You poor girl!  Too bad."

Whuh?

Nana O sticking up for Nana K and praising her.  Then standing by it even when challenged on it in private with her.  Judging by the reaction, she doesn't get that often.

"You think my mom's cool?  She's just like any other mom"  "Nnno."  That *no* carried a lot of weight.

At last Nana O's family history comes out.  And finally some harsh reality invades Nana K's comfy little world.  They say you don't know what you've got till it's gone, but seeing someone else who's lost it does wonders too.  However, it's pretty reassuring to see Nana K also realize the importance of the act of Nana O opening up to her.  Then Nana O goes on to explicitly say it's ok to ask anything  free pass for Nana K.  This whole little scene hit me pretty hard for some reason; I felt myself welling up a bit.  But then Nana K has to go and ruin it with gales of laughter!  Jeez, read the mood!  Ah well.  They go right back into it with the next bit about Ren.  Glad Nana O took it for a caring act rather than an invasive one.

I'm not sure I follow what happened with Ren's position in Trapnest.  I thought he was the bassist, not the guitarist?

Glad we're finally getting some more backstory on Blast too.  "Brute" is too barbaric a name for a rock band?  Oh, Japan, you sweet summer child.  "Olive"?  [Sorry, taken, guys.](http://www.allmusic.com/artist/olive-mn0000467542)  So it turns out the band was named after those cigarillos?  I had theorized that Yasu found those and started smoking them because they had the same name as the band.  Seems much less likely in retrospect, d'oh.  But I'm still not getting where "black stone" comes from

Was afraid Nana O really was going to bail on seeing the show and Ren.  But she came through just in time.  And, no surprise, she's *super* not over him.  Nana K has a pretty strong sense of empathy to cry right along with her like that.

Edit:  I just realized the naming theme in Nana K's family.  Natsuko, Nao, Nana, Nami.
>> ARTICLE
> I thought he was the bassist, not the guitarist?

He can play both. He was Blast's bassist, but he joined Trapnest as a guitarist.
That came up when Shin joined in episode 10.

> But I'm still not getting where "black stone" comes from

The cigars' name is [Black Stone](https://www.google.co.jp/?q=black+stone+cigarillo), but in Japan they like to make 4-syllable nicknames for things, so "bu-ra-su-to"=Blast.

> I just realized the naming theme in Nana K's family. Natsuko, Nao, Nana, Nami.

Haha, I missed that. Yup.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, so those cigarillos are either a product placement or a Bland-Name Product.
>> ARTICLE
They actually use all of the brands' actual names in NANA. Vivienne Westwood, Apple, a few others I can't recall at the moment.
>> ARTICLE
Have they changed the packaging since then?  None of them seem to say "Blast" as depicted in the show.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they had to alter the package in the show for trademark reasons. Or it could just be Japanese-specific packaging. Couldn't say.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad somebody did a WT for Nana because I really wanted to, but I am terrible at writing reviews. 

Anyway, what surprises me the most is how few people on /r/anime have seen Nana, despite so many people who love romances here. It really is not an exaggeration at all to say that Nana is *the* best romantic drama anime/manga to have ever been written and any fan of the genre *must* see it. There are no other shows with characters as well developed, with romance as realistic and believable, or with stories as well written as Nana. 

Edit: Also, I wish you had titled the post "Queen of all Romances" because it's just as true and it would attract more attention
>> ARTICLE
I think it succeeds so well as a romance anime because there is legitimate romance between the characters, which the VAs, the animation and the story telling show extremely well
>> ARTICLE
> I wish you had titled the post "Queen of all Romances"

It's not just the romance, it's the whole psychological aspect of the two Nanas, and how their past brought this about. One is extremely possessive and the other is hopelessly dependent of others.  [](/s "The part that realy gave me the chills was when Nana is yelling at Nobou for letting Hachiko go, and how she really doesn't care if they like each other she just want Hachiko near her or "in her garden" I think was the phrase she used.")

That could be part of it, too.

It is one of the best genres, though! :3
>> ARTICLE
The thing about Nana is that while it is really good at what it does, it may as well be considered genre-defying or even a separate sub-genre because it is so nuanced.  In the same token, because the story in unfinished in all mediums for the foreseeable future, it is hard to recommend.  
  
That being said, it is absolutely worth seeing/reading but only in the context of its uniqueness. It doesn't really define any genre though it has ties to josei/sboujo, but more importantly witbout the nuances of its storytelling it would otherwise be just another unfinished or hastily-cancelled work.

>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
It really is a josei, but MAL categorises it as a shoujo, and more people know what a shoujo is than a josei so \_()_/
>> ARTICLE
The MAL category for it could be something to do with the fact that the manga was published in a [shoujo magazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shojo_Beat) in North America.
Though I'd guess that that itself is (probably) because there weren't/aren't any josei manga magazines published in English.
>> ARTICLE
Also, Nana won the 2002 Shogakukan Manga Award in the shojo category, but that's because they only subdivide between shonen, shojo, general, and children's

Ever since I watched it back 09' I have yet to find a story of romance and music that came close. Nothing quite feels as real the characters do in this anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the WT thread.

What this anime made me do:

* dropping scores of other animes in similar genres (and even some who are not similar)

* Not being able to watch romance/drama at the moment. I am just dropping every romance/drama after 2 episodes...

* Giving a 10 for an anime I basically didn't enjoy at all. When I was watching I had the feeling what would come next (drama) and wanted to drop it, but couldn't because the story was sooo real and well done.

* Making me regret that I watched Nana. I should have watched basically more romance/drama and finish it with Nana...


>> ARTICLE
It manages to do something that most romance anime can barely even convey, and that's to have a feel of a real romance, the moment when [Spoilers](/s "Nana and Nobou first kiss had a million times more impact than most romance anime put together because I actually cared about the characters and how they felt and who they ended up with")
>> ARTICLE
The differing characters and their relationships to one-another really make the show/manga what it is.

Wished they continued with another season, as the story deepened where they ended it. AS WELL AS FINISHING THE MANGA!

Bonus, dat change room scene with Nana and Ren. Mmmmhm.

Favourite character: Yasushi/Miu.
>> ARTICLE
This show definitely 11/10. The plot, the music, the pace of show, VA I just love everything about Nana and I'm glad I watched this show so late if I experienced Nana the couple first of romance then others show would be dull in comparison and I'd had drop all of them. Too sad the show and manga are still on hiatus. I wish Ai Yazawa would recover and continue to finish the story.
>> ARTICLE
Nana is queen of shoujo romance/drama. For shoujo overall, it's tied with Utena and Rose of Versailles. All three are excellent, in any case.
>> ARTICLE
I had this girl in my class that was obsessed with the manga and I meant to check it out but never got around to it. Later I found out it also had an anime adaption and again was going to read/watch it but found out it was on a hiatus and stuff and just lost interest. I like romance and stuff though so maybe I'll get around to it eventually.

I watched/read Nana a long, long time ago and this post brought back all sorts of feels ;__;

Seriously though, I would recommend following up or interjecting this series with something more light-hearted like Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kin. Marathoning Nana made me so effing depressed at the end ):
>> ARTICLE
I really liked everything being done in this show until [](/s "it just got depressing for me. Both of the main characters were with people that I frankly hated, and after all those great episodes beforehand, seeing them with those guys felt so painful for me because it was so obvious that they weren't happy. I stopped watching, and when I looked up the plot of the following episodes, I didn't see them break up. In fact, they actually got MARRIED. I watch anime to be immersed in a good story, or to relax, not to see someone throw their happiness away.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I have to agree. The ending of the show left so many loose ends. For example:

-Did sheen end up with rayra? 
-Did yasu ever find a girl? Did he ever find resolve regarding his feelings for nana?
-Nobu ends up lonely and unable to even face hachi? I expected a scene similar to the one with shoji at Jackson's. Yet they gave that scene to shoji instead? Seriously?
-it would have been nice to see nobu move on and end up with that new girl next door. But nope, I guess introducing her to the story was just filler? Wtf..
-at the end of the show when they are watching the fireworks, nana says to hachi something along the lines of "smack takume around if he starts cheating on you" and hachi basically responds with "lol yeah I guess so haha"...wtf. so basically you settled for a dude who is probably going to cheat on you..but u have a big flat screen at home and a nice house so yeah no problem it's all good. 

Maybe the manga was better. I'm sure it was. But I cannot say I enjoyed this much. There were some good life lessons from the show and it was very realistic at times. I don't always expect perfect endings but a little bit more closure on the rest of the characters would have been nice. Oh well. 
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly what I did. I stopped at episode 36 and just read a quick summary of the ending. I just didn't enjoy watching it at all anymore.
>> ARTICLE
[MAJOR SPOILERS](/s "I think that the depressing part in the last third really showed how it was a really good romance show. There was no sugar coating like the majority of high school romance shows. The scene were Shouji dumps Nana I found incredibly stressful, which really shows how the show got me emotionally connected with the characters. I also think the scene when Takumi basically rapes Nana and all you can hear is the bed creaking is one of the best scenes in any anime, and really harrowing")
>> ARTICLE
That scene tore me to fucking pieces. I've never had a scene in a cartoon make me as angry as that. It was that kind of squirming physical anger that makes you want to hit something. Like "HOW THE FUCK COULD HE DO THIS".
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "I completely agree, more so with Hachi though. I feel so bad for her, and many times I just wanted to shake her and tell her to leave and move on. Baby or no baby. If I ever watch this again, I'll probably stop after she starts going out with Nobu.")
>> ARTICLE
Hachi was a pretty unbearable protagonist at times, I really wanted to tell her to just get her shit together
>> ARTICLE
I can understand why you feel that way, but personally, I feel there's more to take away from the story that simply happiness and sadness. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, by all means I agree with that. The "more" that you can take away from it is what kept me watching all that time. I just found that despite that "more", I didn't really enjoy watching it, so I stopped.
>> ARTICLE
I actually appreciated Nana *because* it made me so uncomfortable with some of the characters choices. It was almost like watching real people making bad life decisions (as we all do, from time to time), and it was a nice example of the way it's possible for a person to redeem those poor choices if they have people in their life willing to forgive and accept them as fallible human beings. It displayed an interesting juxtaposition between both the salvation and the pitfalls of unconditional love.

It's funny, this has been on my backlog for a while...I've been afraid of falling in love with another unfinished work the same way I love *Crest/Banner of the Stars* (which...is...kind of continuing...at a pace slower than HxH ever will...it might as well be on hiatus. The anime certainly will go unfinished).

On the OST, for a long time Anna Tsuchiya's [Kuroi Namida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wxoPZijXU0) (OP3) was outright  my depressed-kitty song for a while, and it asks a question I'm *still* asking:

>Kazari tsukenai de kono mama no watashi de ikiteyuku tame 
>Nani ga hitsuyou 
>Jibun sae shinjirezu nani wo shinjitara ii no?

>To live just how I am now, without changing 
>what is it I need? 

^^^Well ^^^okay, ^^^without ^^^the ^^^debt-over-my-eyeballs ^^^part ^^^of ^^^"now" ^^^but Seriously, at 27, I have a hard time fitting in to any social group around where I live because my interests generally don't align with anyone I'm around most of the time (aside from my girlfriend and our few friends). Around here, if you don't hunt, fish, have a small personal armory that makes the local police look under-equipped, hate Arabs/Latin Americans/Obama, speak any language other than English (even secondary), and bible-thump...you're an outcast by default. Okay, I'm stereotyping and generalizing liberally there, but I tend to avoid most of those topics (politics, religion, gun control (which is politics), race/ethnicity) and they come up far too often.

I'm also not a fan of putting on a front just to get ahead (I'd make a terrible Mikado...).

>difficult thing in this world?

Anyone watch the live action movies? I enjoyed them. Nana was great casting but Hachi just didn't quite cut it for me especially the new actress in the second movie.
I really think this is one story that could easily be adapted to a North American version.

My only criticism is that it can be a bit over dramatic at times but that is only a very minor issue.
>> ARTICLE
For a shoujo, it's almost under dramatic at times

The only thing I have to say about this show, it is my absolute, far and away favorite romance show, and possibly my straight up favorite anime ever. I know people don't like it, or don't feel like watching because the story is unfinished ( and likely won't be) but I really think the show is worth watching anyways. 
>> ARTICLE
Plenty of people consider the original Berserk essential viewing, and it certainly is (especially since it'll show you how a show can be terribly animated and still fantastic), and it certainly doesn't have an ending
>> ARTICLE
I've been meaning to watch this but somehow I got the impression that it was a Yuri/Shoujo Ai show. Is it? Or am I way off?
>> ARTICLE
I kind of felt that way for some reason too. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a couple of sequences when Hachi basically talks about how sexy Nana is, following it up by saying "But wait, that's wrong"
>> ARTICLE
That's fine as long as that's all there is to it.
>> ARTICLE
I wish there was romance between the two MCs because their relationship is amazing, but the show isn't shoujo ai. There is definitely "sismance" (like bromance, but with women), but the main relationships are male/female.
>> ARTICLE
Ok great. I'm generally not a fan of Yuri/shoujo ai so thank you for clarifying.

=O I never noticed this while in Kyoto, but maybe I was just too drunk every time I was in a taxi.

Haha probably too drunk to notice, or you jumped in/out before the driver could push the button. I've never been in one here that doesn't have the auto door. [They're adding stickers about it now](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/14/national/taxi-stickers-osaka-notify-foreigners-automatic-doors/).

Only the rear passenger side door is generally auto though, so if you were riding with others you might have gone through another door.

I dunno. We know Ren is doing pretty great for himself in Tokyo as a member of Trapnest. The breifcase could have been his guitar case and the guy could have worn his best clothes for his closure moment with Nana.

Finally early got this! Hahah!

Still surprises me how much they use cute comedic moments and animation. Completely forgot about that because I'm always paying attention to the drama.

And the drama starts knocking in this episode. Shouji moments are appearing. It's cool, Hachi kind of ignores him, for the most part, sadly.

Based Yasu. That's all this episode was about. Nana and Yasu moment is so sweet and endearing.

Also, the start of Shin fashion. Oh man, first time viewers are going to have a lot of fun with this.

Amusingly, the first search result for "lip to ear chain" [mentions the character](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081021213644AA5zVst). Doesn't seem like anything special, just a chain with clips that hook it up to piercings on either end.

**Episode 11:**

Nana's luck ran out, wonder what that could mean.

Ah it must mean it's because you spent so much money lol. Glad NANA is responsible, Hachi really has no good qualities lol.

Guess she's eating rice for the rest of the month. Not too bad I guess, beats starving. Get your life together Hachi!!

Sachiko and Shoji getting close...why. Shoji will NEVER FUCKING FORGIVE YOU IF YOU DO WHAT I THINK YOU MIGHT BE DOING. 

Shin must have family problems :c That's too bad. Guess she understands what it feels like to have parents who do not care.

HAHA YOU GUYS THOUGHT THE STORE OWNER WAS SLEEZY. The whole commercial break split  inbetween the scene really screwed up the flow...

Well now Hachi is out of work LOLLLLLLL. 

That fucking Sachiko did it on purpose. She's totally gunning for Shoji, and Shoji isn't warting her off...

Shoji uses a Mac...I hate this guy even more. 

Hachi's mom comes clutch! NANA is a bit jeolous. 

Nope still not Ren...it's Yasu! And he wants to join the band! He's coming to Tokyoooooooooo!

Our band is finally together. Time to make memories.
>> ARTICLE
> Hachi really has no good qualities lol.

That's not true!  She's cute and cheerful and she tries hard (most of the time)!

>HAHA YOU GUYS THOUGHT THE STORE OWNER WAS SLEEZY. The whole commercial break split inbetween the scene really screwed up the flow...

I never though he was sle***a***zy.  I was expecting that big buildup to end with "I have to let you go.  You're fired.".

>Shoji uses a Mac...I hate this guy even more. 

Haha, I was objecting to that too.  Starving student and you're going to waste money on Apple?  Geeez you're hardly any better than Nana K!
>> ARTICLE

Yasu is my favorite too but what about Junko and Kyosuke ._.
>> ARTICLE
Junko higher then Kyosuke but they're both up there on hte not sleezy list...for now
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so does this mean Nana really has feelings for Yasu? That was a lot of emotion for just a bandmate. A part of me thought it was going to be Ren because of how she acted. Anyhow, I'm glad he's back. 

I wonder what Shoji would have done had Hachi not called right then. I no longer know who's going to cheat on who first when a charismatic attractive character shows up. They both seem so fickle at times. I knew the shop owner had to tell her that he was closing the shop, though that doesn't make it any less hilarious to see Hachi's flower wilt and fall. Welp, time to see how the band goes now that we've got all the members (though I'm not sure how permanent the 15-year-old's spot is). 
>> ARTICLE
> Wait, so does this mean Nana really has feelings for Yasu?

I think it's more like a father figure or someone she can rely on. She's really close with him in a non romantic way.

> I no longer know who's going to cheat on who first when a charismatic attractive character shows up.

My answer is everyone lol


>> ARTICLE
First and foremost: Yasu's back! And Nana may not have romantic feelings for him like Hachi wants, but she does love him in her own way. I'll admit I teared up at their reunion at the end along with Nana and Yasu is quickly climbing up my ranks of favorite characters.

Given the photo's and Hachi's voiceover at the beginning I was expecting something a lot more serious than her blowing all her money. I'm firmly with Nana on that one. What kind of job is she going to that late though? I don't think that's when she slipped off to the studio to play the drums, though I could easily be wrong there.

More of Nana with Mizukoshi and Shoji with Sachiko (and caught by Kyosuke, at that). As long as everyone's aware of who's actually dating whom everything's good. Kyosuke is right to be worried though, particularly if Sachiko really is Shoji's type. So many complex relationships that it's starting to make other shows feel shallow.

Hachi is upset with *Shoji* for not having enough money to get *her* through the end of the month? I don't blame him for wanting to spend more time with Sachiko instead. Speaking of which, Sachiko's treading on dangerous ground there by deliberately making him miss the last train with her. At least she realized her mistake by the end of the night and backs off, though she's crying when she runs off.
>> ARTICLE
Sachiko didn't appear to know Shoji had a girlfriend, till she got that feeling from the phone call after the fact.

10,000 per month for one cell phone?  Man, that seems steep, even for Japan

Today on "fun with dubs vs. subs":

Sub:

>Kyousuke:  "Well, I'm more for the dark-skinned big girls like you, but"

>Jun:  "Huh?!  Well, excuse me for my dark skin."

Dub:

>Kyousuke:  "Well, to be perfectly honest, the type of girl *I* usually go for is a giant tanned woman.  You know, just like you."

>Jun:  "Uh!  Well, excuse me for being real."

That Kyousuke avoided being beaten up there shows just how smooth he is.  One day I hope to be that smooth.

That little bit between Nana O and Shinichi bodes well for the show not forgetting any of the threads it starts.  And there seem to be plenty to go around.  No wonder the show needs 47 episodes!

The long drawn-out build-up to Mizukoshi's news was fun because you could tell what they were expecting you to expect them to do, and that they were going to do something else.  I still missed my guess, though  I thought he was going to fire her.  I also missed my guess about her reaction.  I was sure she was going to propose some kind of publicity blitz based on cute hand-drawn posters she made up or something.  But nope, store's just gone!  Pleh.  :p

Whoa.  Sachiko admits right away she did that on purpose.  She's a dangerous one!  But then she backs off as soon as she susses out that he has a girlfriend.  Really obscures for me how this is going to go.

Nana O being maybe just a little envious of Nana K's parents for just a moment, till Nana K ruins the mood, haha.

Jeez.  Nana O's reaction to Yasu being there.  She *really* wants the band back to its former glory

And another letter-to-Nana-O framing ending.  "Just like the good old days."  That's starting to worry me a bit.

>dubs vs. subs

The sub took some liberties too, he actually said his type is huge (meaning tall in the context) [ganguro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganguro) girls like Junko (thus the sudden exaggerated shot). She sarcastically replies "Excuse me for being dark-skinned [] (jiguro)."
>> ARTICLE
Great episode again, and this is shaping up to be a great show overall. It's not even that one thing in particular stands out. The banter/dialogue is just so entertaining and engrossing. The characters are excellent - even Hachiko, who I initially disliked for being so childish/immature (and she still is) but she manages to be hilarious at the same time and will be interesting to watch grow and become independent.

Also, I'm kinda rooting for the Shoji and Nana ship to sink. I've never really been a fan of it from the beginning of the show. On the other hand, I hope it doesn't happen in a sad way and instead they both realize they're a shitty match for each other and go their own ways, but I doubt it'll be smooth sailing. Nobu and Hachiko, on the other hand, seem like they'd make a good pair.




>> ARTICLE
Welp. My willpower is nonexistent, just could not help it...

After watching the first episode I cancelled all my plans for Sunday then went on a ridiculous binge. Fuck church all y'all, **NANA** is in da house.

I think the best thing to say about this series other than the realistic and mature portrayal of romance decahedron is just how delightfully unpredictable the whole thing is. 

In addition the 10 or so main characters have distinct personalities with clear flaws and virtues yet still manage to be very sympathetic. Many of these I'd never have expected to have deep empathy with from their first impressions.

At the moment I simply have to give it a 10/10

Need a rewatch to be sure but I think it has just toppled **Shin Sekai Yori** from its seat as my "Best Anime Ever".

The trick is to watch with subtitle.
That way I can watch at 2x or even 3x speed during non-essential scenes.  I use Potplayer that can fine tune the play speed in 0.1x increments with hotkeys.

Started at midnight and watched until around 9 - 10 AM.

Went to bed, woke up at 1 PM and continued watching.

Finished at around 9 PM. 

Obviously I take many breaks inbetween, walk the dog, eat, bathroom breaks. Still it was an exhilarating though exhausting ride. No regret!

>> ARTICLE
How is your brain not mush?  It was daunting enough rewatching Steins;Gate in one day, this is twice as long and noticeably more gut-wrenching.
>> ARTICLE
And on episode two, the plot moves... *backwards*?

It's an unusual choice to rewind to the past so early on in the show, but I have to say that I'm disappointed that other shows don't adopt this approach more often. By showing us all that has happened before, we really get strong characterisation right off the bat, which will help us empathize more with our two mains when the real story starts. It also seems way more organic than interjected flashbacks and side plots, though the intimate dialogue that prefaces most episodes certainly helps frame this 'cards on the table' exposition.

Of course, it's not that hard to see why shows don't do this often. By showing what your characters are like so honestly and frankly right from the start, there is a risk of turning people off from the show, especially if they are not universally likeable. Nana takes that risk, which is always a great sign for a show, as imo the shows that put faith in their audience are the ones that receive the biggest reward. Nana doesn't compromise, it knows what it wants and what it is and the show isn't afraid to take some losses in viewers in order to remain true to its vision.

That's a lot of praise right there without even delving into what the episode is about. So let's rectify that. 

Simply said, today we get a full color view of what Nana Komatsu (who shall be addressed by Nana K from now on, at least until we get to episode 8 or so) is really like. And what we see is not all that pretty. 

I said yesterday that Nana K is the type of girl you've met at least a dozen times. That wasn't an exaggaration. She's boundlessly enthusiastic, which makes her very endearing and she goes after what she wants without hesitation. Unfortunately, underneath the endearing facade, there is a typical high school girl, in the worst sense. She's easily impressed, melodramatic and naive more than anything else, but that's not the worst of it. 

The biggest problem with Nana K and also the reason why she is perhaps the most controversial of our main cast, is that she totally and utterly lacks both self-worth and self-realization. She has no dreams or ambitions of note, except to fall in love. But as people with experience in love know, you won't become a whole person with it if you're not okay without it. You can't let your life and your view of yourself depend wholely on love and the partner you're with. Things will never work out that way.

Sadly, Nana K has not figured that out yet. She basically falls in love with everything that moves and when someone finally bites, she gives in hook, line and sinker. But even though a part of her knows that it can't ever end well, she decides to delude herself because she lacks that self-worth (see the response to the ring). She inevitably gets burned, badly, which is of course entirely her own fault. Problem is, even though it seems she learns her lesson, at the end of the episode she reverts to the same old, same old.

And there it is. Endearing, outgoing, naive and devoid of self-worth and dreams. Good intentions can lead to the worst decisions and Nana K has the best intentions of them all. We can see it will take a lot to set her decision making straight: suffice to say that you should not be counting on sooner rather than later. Tomorrow will definitely not be the day: this show will take its time with development, as people do not change overnight. 

In any case, the show is off to a good start. I'd advise people who don't like Nana K to stick it out, because in two episodes we'll be switching to Nana O, who is an entirely different person.

I've gone through something similar and it's not pleasant looking back at that time in my life. I'd like to think I'm wiser now but it certainly doesn't feel like it sometimes.

I can kind of see why viewers might not like her early on, but I just sympathize and hope she'll get herself figured out over the course of the story.
>> ARTICLE
I can't exactly sympathize with her, but I do recognize her kind and I have seen some of them grow up over the years to become great people. 

But it can be frustrating to see them make such horrible decisions, something that will also happen in Nana as you might expect. 
>> ARTICLE

Well said, and reminds me of Shel Silverstein's ["The Missing Piece meets the Big O"](http://www.ktor.me/bigo/index.php) which is such a beautiful piece about relationships.

That is a story relevant way beyond its recommended age range!

Wow, that was great. Really apt metaphor for what a relationship really is and what is needed to make them fulfilling.

The most common complaint about the show in general, at least over at /r/animesuggest, is about these flashback episodes and in particular how unsympathetic Nana K is presented as. It's really an understandable objection and I find myself not really able to defend the criticism very well because I agree with it. For me, it wasn't a big deal that Nana K doesn't really have her shit together, but for some it's almost a deal breaker.
>> ARTICLE
> how unsympathetic Nana K is presented as.

That's not how I feel *at all* in this episode but maybe that's because I see a little of my own past in her.
>> ARTICLE
It's a really valid complaint, but that's what makes this show so good. How do you want to let your characters grow if you don't give them genuine flaws? And not that 'shyer than wildlife/denser than the sun' crap that always pops up, but glaring, infuriating flaws that lower your opinion of the character in question. 

The show takes the big risk of you dropping it for having an MC like this, but it is the only way to receive the payout it receives. That's what makes really good shows that good: their unwillingness to pander and their courage to take risks. 

Aside from that, I don't think Nana K is *that* unsympathetic. You can tell that she is, in fact, a good person, but with a lot of maturing to do still. She's a mixed bag of traits, but honestly, weren't we all like that in our teens?

If I look back at the me from 8 or so years ago, I don't feel I was that sympathetic either. It was just that it was masked by everyone being equally undeveloped.  
>> ARTICLE
> unsympathetic

I don't get that at all.  She seems just sweet and misguided and inexperienced, which I hope anyone could sympathize with from some point in one's life.  I don't know those critics, but my money says every single one of them has spent a lot of time not having his shit together.
>> ARTICLE
>even though it seems she learns her lesson, at the end of the episode she reverts to the same old, same old.

There is also the simple lack of experience  she forms this theory that love is a "get back on that horse *immediately*" kind of thing, and nothing else can heal the hurt.  If she'd just slow down and wait six or seven months before jumping back into the pool, she'd find that there are other, actual ways.
>> ARTICLE
You're right, she's young and inexperienced in the ways of the world, but it does belie a significant trait of her character in that she's not a 'once bitten, twice shy' type of girl. We'll see how that influences her life further. 
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to interrupt. Nana's on Netflix! Just wanted to share.

[My super-late post in the previous thread, for anyone who cares](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/39te7x/spoilers_nana_rewatch_episode_1_discussion_thread/cs79oqa)

For anyone who skipped that, tl;dr:  first-timer, writing after finishing episode.

Now.

I really like this extended-flashback-episode structure, actually.  We start by getting a basic feel for the main characters and who they're intended to be, then we go back and spend a little time seeing how they got to be the ways they are.  A nice luxury to have from your show being 47 episodes long!  If we'd gone purely in chronological order, I bet a lot more people would be put off by the character flaws we're shown.  (Not that I would have been.  I have a pretty easy time sympathizing with earnest people, even if they do it wrong.)

And speaking of.  Poor Nana K is a lovestruck fool, but it's endearing to see her so cockeyedly optimistic about it even after so many failures.  Those of us who "wisely" sat out romance for far too long in our young lives might even look up to her plucky, unhesitating, never-say-die spirit about the whole thing.  You just *want* her to succeed, y'know?  You can't help cheering her on.  *C'mon, Nana, you can do this!*

At the same time, as others have pointed out, you should probably figure out who you are alone before you start attaching yourself to another.  But that's not exactly written in the instruction manual, so I can't fault anyone *too* much for screwing this up.

Jun, on the other hand, seems to be nearly the polar opposite.  She has everything almost disturbingly together forsomeone fresh out of high school (she comes off almost like a 30-year-old), yet still manages to snag a boyfriend within like five seconds without even trying.  It would be easy for Nana K to resent and envy her for all that.  But no, Nana's way too good a person to fall prey that kind of thinking.

I'm a little intrigued by the prevalence of "no-no" activities going on so far.  So many smokers.  So much drinking (even underage!).  Two episodes in, two nude-in-bed-and/or-lovemaking scenes.  This ain't your standard sanitized fare!

It turns out Shoji is almost a Rule 63 version of Nana K.  That's kinda funny, but also a bit of a surprise given the previous episode's characterization.

I don't know why, but the shot of Nana K descending into the hole-in-the-ground dance club at the end seems pretty ominous.  Could just be my own revulsion against such clubs, though.

In conclusion, so far this is looking as great as its reputation seems to be!

**Episode 2**

Flashbacks right away...getting Chihayafuru vibes

Wow didn't think Nana was like that! With that relationship!

Wahhh. So many relationships! And a 29 year old while in high school...

Didn't mind that he was married!? Come on Nana :/

That isn't love girl...

Episode 2 a lot harder to watch then epiosde 1 haha

Man that married jerk really hurt her...

Club by yourself...interesting choice Nana

Not sure how realistic it is so far haha but I guess it's a good thing I can't really relate with Nana haha







>> ARTICLE
>Not sure how realistic it is so far... 


Weirdly (very weirdly and off putting) there is a culture in Japan where a high school girl will date an older man (around that age). 

So creepy guy gets to "date" a high schooler and the girl get to have an older guy basically buy her a bunch of things. 

There is a name for this, but I cannot remember this early in the morning. 

Not something popular that happens all the time, but it isn't unheard of. 

So, so wrong.

Absolutely not cool. Just letting you know that it does seem to happen though. 

Sense of mortality is different there I guess.

[Enjo kousai (compensated dating)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enjo_ksai). Junko actually asked her if that's what she was doing, and Nana denied it. Though the version I watched just translated it as prostitution.

That's the one (thanks).

Ha. Nice translation. Guess it is a transaction of good for services. Ew.

Oh, is this the same thing [Initial D Spoilers](/s "Mogi had with her "papa"?")

Ok, so that's what it is. I suppose "prostitution" is the closest concept familiar to Western audiences. Thanks
>> ARTICLE
The sugar daddy phenomenon is closer IMO, though there are/were networks in Japan for pairing up, which made it closer to prostitution. It sort of depends on the situation.

>> ARTICLE
> Flashbacks right away...getting Chihayafuru vibes

Whut ?? But I sometimes wish Taichi would man up and emulate some of the more colorful character in NANA. The new Taichi would then tell Chihaya he's been in love with her since forever and if she ever feel ready to have a serious relationship with him then he'd be there for her.

Taichi then proceed to go on a rampage devirginating his fan girls at Mizusawa and elsewhere. If Chihaya never reciprocates then so be it; fishes in the ocean!
>> ARTICLE
>Wow didn't think Nana was like that! With that relationship!

>Wahhh. So many relationships! 

Yeah, I didn't either initially, but then you think about her in the first episode and you can kind of see that her general fickle nature carries over to her love life as well.

>Episode 2 a lot harder to watch then epiosde 1 haha

Bear with it! At least now you know why you've seen people complain about the MC, heh. She certainly isn't very sympathetic.

A viewers relationship with Naive Nana is like her and her friend's relationship.

What a creep too. Was about to say that I'm hoping he turns up and gets some comeuppance, but realistically speaking I expect she'll just move on. Maybe she'll see him in Tokyo when we get back to the present? (thus bringing resurfacing old feelings)

On second thoughts, maybe "bracing" would have been the more correct word

Much better!
>> ARTICLE
Continuing with watching the dub, I'm really happy at how well done it is! The voice acting never sounds forced and they've changed some lines so that they sound like something a primary English speaker would actually say rather than sticking with awkward literal translations.

I'm going to be honest and say that when I first watched this episode, I wanted to slap Nana K a few times upside the head. I have a couple of close friends in real life that she reminds me of, but they're in steady relationships now, so I was definitely rooting for Shoji to save her from herself. Just man up and go for it!
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow I didnt even know there was a dub. Does it sound kinda old? 
>> ARTICLE
No, it actually sounds really good! I just decided on a whim to try it out this time so I could have some kind of a new experience, what with this being my fourth rewatch of the show and all!
>> ARTICLE
How does the dub handle the "honorifics" self-asides by Nana and Junko this episode?
>> ARTICLE
You're going to have to explain what you're asking for in lay terms for me.
>> ARTICLE
honorifics are -san, -senpai, -kun, -chan, etc. A lot can be told about how the characters relate to each other by the honorifics they refer to each other with.
>> ARTICLE
Right, I understand that, but I wasn't sure about what /u/GeeJo wanted me to tell him about the dub. Was he asking about how the honorifics were translated? If that's the case, the answer is that they weren't. Was there something especially unique about the honorifics used in this episode? I admit that's not something I have ever paid attention to.
>> ARTICLE
I might not have really noticed it since I sort of internalize such things at this point, but since I was looking for examples I noticed [in episode 3](/s "Nana calls Shouji "Shou-chan" twice, and he responds "Don't call me Shou-chan" during their conversation before the opening credits. It began since she said she was starting to think of him like Junko, who she calls "Jun-chan." Later in the episode Junko jokingly calls him the same in her first line at the beach, and he responds the same way.") 
>> ARTICLE
What you mentioned in your spoiler I did notice, mainly because Shoji himself pointed it out. [](/s "In the dub 'Sho-kun' was translated to 'Sho-Jun'. A bit weird.") 
>> ARTICLE
There were two asides in the episode - the first where Nana thought how awkward she sounded using honorifics, the second where Junko thought to herself how quickly Nana dropped using them in conversation with Shouji.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, I think I know what you're talking about now. 

The first case was when Shoji asked Nana if she might be the shy type, right? In the dub, she says in response to Shoji "No, no, that's not it at all." And then thinks to herself, "Damn, how do I talk to him as a friend?"

Is the second instance when Shoji meets up with Nana and Junko on the way to school? The dub translates Jun's thoughts as "That certainly perked her up. Oh well, never mind." 
>> ARTICLE
I remember being really upset at Nana when I first watched episode 2 a few months back (I put it on hold at around the 12 episodes mark) because of how casual she treated affairs, but during this rewatch I started being more sympathetic to her. She's young and she has her own sense of morality and priorities. I'm not saying what she did was right, but I'm at least more understanding. Of course, this could be just the halo effect now that I know more about Nana after 12 episodes. /u/watashi-akashi has already made a fantastic post about the risks the show took to show an unsympathetic part of its protagonist right off the bat as well as Nana's dependence on love, so I won't reiterate them here. 

At the risk of going slightly off topic, I was hoping to have a discussion on cultural differences of affairs. [After all, apparently in Japan if you pay for it, it isn't considered an affair.](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/court-japan-rules-that-paying-sex-not-adultery-landmark-ruling-1506007) I know that there's also different legal ramifications too, in Japan it seems that it is more common for the wife to go after the mistress for money while in North America affairs are usually grounds for divorce, in which case the ex-wife goes after her ex-husband. 

I've always been under the impression that Japanese men have more affairs than North American men but couldn't find the data to back it up. Cultural differences in gender roles, social pressures on divorcees, the presence of "love hotels," different consequences for the cheater, all attribute to my conceptions about affair rates in Japan being higher than North America. This still doesn't justify Asano in my eyes though, I have a severe dislike for him for both having an affair and for taking advantage of a girl severely younger than him.    
>> ARTICLE
Oh.. I know this kind of girl. Always hopeful, bouncing from one relationship to the next in search of the right one. A bit nave but good-hearted and that unfortunately draws scuzzy guys. Now I feel bad for her.

Also we get to see how Jun and Kyosuke (is that his name?) got started. At least they seem to be doing well later on. Already one of the best anime I've seen for portrayals of relationships around this age, or at least I think so because I've been in these kinds of situations. College was fun.
>> ARTICLE
I'm watching this, but I'm not sure if I'll be keeping up with the rewatch. I might just watch it at my own pace. The Nanas meeting, starting, and building their relationship in ep1, now some harsher but empathetic flashback drama. This shit, I like it.


>> ARTICLE
The establishing shot of her hometown before the OP was nicely done. I think Im going to like the cinematography in this series. This definitely feels josei, but it still has some shoujo-esque visuals (flying hearts, face faults, etc). Interesting mix.

For the story so far-

* Well, at least she seems to make friends with level heads. Junko seems slightly similar to dark Nana personality-wise.
* I found it funny how she seems to consider friends more important than boyfriends, as boy-crazy as she is.
* Took me a moment to recall Junko and Kyosuke were mentioned in the first episode- living together now. Nice. I guess theyll be recurring characters, as theyre in Tokyo too.

**Episode 8:**

Hachi admires NANA alot even though she's nothing like her...
Nope Yasu and Nana aren't a thing...
He's just an incredibly reliable dude. 

Hachi don't get any ideas...
SHe already had her resume ready LOL

Shoji getting a little jealous. Could Hachi be a girl that cheats?

Looks like Ren made it big in Trapnest. Good for him...to bad he lost Nana for it. He's still wearing the lock though!!

Hmm this Reira chick looks interesting ... 

[Mild spoiler](/s "Love her <3")

Hmm Ren is the the most popular out of the guys in the band. 

Nana doesn't love Yasu...stop making up stuff Hachi

Careful Nana, if you don't keep Shoji interested there might actually be a Sachiko! 
Still though it's weird that Hachi is already so attached to Nana.

Me too. Are there any anime about lawyers? Does Phoenix Wright have a series? Someone needs to get on that if not.

Nana K, theorizing that Nana O ran away from home.  What you did comes much closer, girl!

"But you don't like the little red strawberries~!  ;~;"  Nana, you so cute.  Also, [dat pout.](http://i.imgur.com/PskffIc.jpg)

Mizukoshi, what a hipster.  And Nana K, working there, should get an employee discount, shouldn't she?

Kind of a PTSD moment for Nana O upon seeing Ren on the poster.  Not nearly over him after all.  Also, he's just joined Trapnest and is already the most popular?  Hrm.

"If I was gonna die, would you die along with me?"  Geez, Nana O.  Little bit psycho there.

By the way, how the hell does a restaurant in Tokyo come to be named after Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 1999 population 6,326?

Geez, Nana K.  Your boyfriend wants to be with you and you're gonna complain about it?  I think this might be today's "dammit, Nana" moment.

"It's ok if you stay at Sachiko's tonight."  I feel like "stay at Sachiko's" acts as a euphemism for masturbation here, haha.

Also, kinda neat how they finagled this "Hachi = 8" nickname thing on episode 8.
>> ARTICLE
She didn't say anything about central heat/air conditioning. Central is pretty much unheard of for even the nicest houses in Japan, it's pretty much only used in large commercial buildings.

Homes and small to medium businesses use [ductless mini split](https://www.google.com/search?q=ductless+mini+split) air conditioning units in each room.
>> ARTICLE
Hm, seems it's an artifact of the dub.  "Central heat and A/C" is a direct quote from that.  The subs only seem to mention A/C.

Following your link, the units you describe seem to cover both heating and cooling.  But they still look like the kind of thing a landlord would not let one install without permission, being in need of fairly large wall-holes and such
>> ARTICLE
Ah okay.

Yup, would definitely need the landlord's permission. The hole to connect the two halves is actually pretty small (about 8cm/3in) and most places would have them already drilled, but you also have to drive bolts into the wall to mount the wall unit.

I was surprised at the lack of A/C compressors hanging on the building on the exterior shot in episode 1 and 7, though they could be on a different face of the building or on the roof.
>> ARTICLE
>By the way, how the hell does a restaurant in Tokyo come to be named after Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 1999 population 6,326?

Haha, I wondered what was up with the name of that pub too and ended up looking it up. Turns out there's an old burger joint/diner in NYC named Jackson Hole that's pretty well known, so I imagine the one our cast hangs out at is named it after that rather than a middle of nowhere town in Wyoming. In case you haven't been able to tell, Ai Yazawa is pretty big on "Western" culture and it comes through in her work.
>> ARTICLE
Hm, didn't know that about her.  Explains quite a bit, actually
>> ARTICLE
Based on the fact that apparently Hachi (hilarious nickname) will make some decisions we will not like, I have a feeling she might cheat on Shoji. I mean, he has serious feelings for her but she seems more fickle and flirtatious. I wouldn't necessarily think this had I not been told Hachi messes up a lot. But I'm going to hope for the best. 

I figured Nana still had feelings for Ren, or at least has feelings to work out. I'm sure we'll run into him eventually. I laugh every time Hachi mentions Sachiko. Great episode. 
>> ARTICLE
>  I have a feeling she might cheat on Shoji. 

Come on guys have some FAITH
>> ARTICLE
Right now, I don't think Hachi has the willpower to break up with Shoji first if she does fall for someone else.

I wonder if she's considered a polyamorous relationship. Could be interesting but I doubt Shoji would be on board and I don't think this would be the series to take on the idea. Is it even a thing in Japanese culture? Still not a widespread concept here in America as far as I'm aware.
>> ARTICLE
> I have a feeling she might cheat on Shoji

I full on expect one of them to cheat with someone at one point...
>> ARTICLE
We learned in this episode that :

* *nana* means *seven*
* *hachi* means *eight*
* *hachikou* is a common pet name for dogs

Come on Shouji, one day without sex so your gf can take care of her new roommate is nothing to complain about.
>> ARTICLE
Hope the seven trend continues, it's cute :)
>> ARTICLE
>hachikou is a common pet name for dogs

To elaborate, Hachikou is the name of a royal dog that reached Old Yeller/Lassie status in Japan. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D

Hachikou was a dog in the 20's and 30's that always went to the train station to greet his owner who was returning home from work. Even when his owner passed away, Hachikou followed the same routine for almost 10 years. Publicity surrounding Hachikou reached national status. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, Im just going to assume the short reminicing prologue/epilogue in each episode is Hachi thinking back to what started it all after she snapped and killed everyone.

* Hachi (8) gets her nickname on episode 8.
* Nanas still pointedly avoiding talking about her past or where she came from.
* Loved [Nanas reaction](http://i.imgur.com/KqBJQDC.png) at Hachi being in Trapnests fanclub.
* Im looking forward to Hachi finding out about Nana and Ren.
>> ARTICLE
How do you feel about Hachi's narrations? Like I mentioned in another reply, my curiosity to find out why she sounds so sad in those was one of the biggest driving factors for me to binge the show. I can see them being irritating in the same way constant cliffhangers can be.
>> ARTICLE
Oh so she doesn't snap and kill everyone then? Thought I had it figured out ;)

My actual guess would be Nana (or Hachi) got sick/injured/dead. I'm used to these sorts of narrations from things like [Kanon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/144/Kanon) and [Higurashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/934/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni) though, so that might skew my perception.

I don't mind them.
>> ARTICLE
I never said she doesn't, it's entirely possible something will happen to make her snap.

Those all sound like reasonable assumptions though. I actually don't remember what I thought when I first watched it, I just know I really wanted to find out what happened.
>> ARTICLE
> Hachi (8) gets her nickname on episode 8.

Didn't notice that! I like that a lot

>> ARTICLE
The puppy comparison is so apt. Hachi it is! I wonder if their friends will start calling her that too to differentiate the two of them.

Unlike Sachiko, Mizukoshi is quite real and someone Shoji may need to be concerned about. Master of falling in love at first sight indeed. The retro appliance/furniture store could be interesting in the future too.

Another bit of coincidence that Hachi's a big fan of Ren's new band, but it's not that unlikely. I'm amused that she doesn't like him though. I didn't think the lock that Ren wears was from Nana, thought he would have gotten rid of it (or at least stop wearing it) were that the case. Still in love, maybe?

Hey Shoji, sometimes a girl wants to take a break from all the sex, 'kay? I like that she's already showing some more independence... from *him*, at least. Right now she's more dedicated to Nana.

Aww, Nana fell asleep listening to Ren. Well, Trapnest, but Ren. And ending with more of that letter... I really hope we get context for it at the end.
>> ARTICLE
> Unlike Sachiko, Mizukoshi is quite real and someone Shoji may need to be concerned about.

Yeah hopefully nothing happens there...

> Aww, Nana fell asleep listening to Ren.

Yeah that scene was pretty tough, she obviously misses him :(

Solid episode. I really like the dynamic between Nana and Hachi. I also like the rate of 1 episode per day. I don't feel like I'd be up to binge this. I'm not craving to see the next episode immediately after, but I enjoy the process of watching the show a lot.


>> ARTICLE
>I don't feel like I'd be up to binge this. I'm not craving to see the next episode immediately after, but I enjoy the process of watching the show a lot.

I wonder if that will change over the course of the show, it probably depends on how much you enjoy the drama. For me this was the episode that started my binge because I just had to find out why Hachi sounded so sad whenever she did narrations and I really wanted to see how the situation with Ren played out. My desire to binge the rest of the show was definitely reinforced by the drama to come - to the point where I was hanging on the edge of my seat at the end of every episode. What makes a show compelling enough to binge is obviously different for everybody though, so I'll enjoy seeing all the first time watchers' reactions.

Eh. I'm actually not much into dramatic/sad romances, so we'll see. I enjoyed Golden Time, but beyond that I prefer action anime with a heavy dose of romance. Sadly, there's very little in the way of a genre blend between action and romance save for maybe SAO's first arc, and I don't think it's very well executed there given the writer is terrible - so, I've branched out to watching pure romance now.

**Episode 12:**

Very simple dream there Hachi.

Haha her mom thought she eloped. I would think so too if she just randomly left without saying too much.

NANA's laugh is contagious LOL. 

Hachi trying to get her life on track haha, let's see how that works for her.

Listen to her Shoji...you're on the wrong path...
"I'm on the side of justice"...more like the side of the audience (same thing perhaps?)

You're pissing me off Shoji.........................

You're pisssing me off Shoji......do it...break it off...ignore the tears.

You've done it now Shoji. Just like that, you're officially dead to me.

Nana x Hachi OTP. Don't give a fuck. Fuck you Shoji, you stupid fucking piece of a shit.

After these types of episodes, you gotta listen to the entire ending song...
You'll be doing that a lot during episodes to come...

I am surprisingly not too upset...not exactly sure why

> I am surprisingly not too upset...not exactly sure why

It's probably because you know too much about series. I came into Nana having high hopes for both of them. You came into Nana with a very pessimistic outlook on it... you were probably prepared O.o

It'll be interesting to see how this will develop \^\^
>> ARTICLE
> a very pessimistic outlook on it... you were probably prepared

I feel like I want to be prepared for everything haha

And yeah really curious to see how they handle the situation 
>> ARTICLE
>I am surprisingly not too upset...not exactly sure why

Because of how much the show showed that Hachi and Shoji were growing apart and also how there relationship was created and shown. Compared to Nana and Ren is felt a lot more fragile and you could almost feel that it could break any second. You aren't shown the deep connection between Hachi and Shoji like you were in scenes like when Ren said he was going to Tokyo, the bath scenes or getting on the train leaving to tokyo. These scenes all showed a more raw  and mature connection between the two more then anything I felt with Hachi and Shoji.  Even compared to Junko and Kyosuke every time these two are together they feel stable and are able to casually poke fun at each other. The show was built up to make you expect something like this from Hachi's relastionship.
>> ARTICLE
Well that makes  perfect sense, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
It could have so easily been Hachi who cheated first. Heck, she was dreaming about marrying someone like Yasu, then is like "Oh yeah, I forgot I have Shouji..."

They've definitely been drifting apart, which ironically started after Hachi moved closer to him.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, but I kinda feel like this is for the best. If things do happen they way it's probably going to happen, Hachi will probably grow from this. 

Plus it's nice that she has lots of friends other than Junko and Shoji. 


>> ARTICLE
SHOJI YOU BASTARD

It was apparent he was conflicted in this episode but I still didn't expect it to end that way as I was hoping he'd pick the other path. And Hachi's poor mother thought she eloped with him too!

Nana was very friendly with Yasu when drunk, but who wouldn't be? He's just that awesome. Maybe we're in just as much denial about her true feelings for him as she is and Hachi has the right idea of things. [So damn cute.](http://i.imgur.com/SijmVOq.png)

Nana contemplating Yasu and realizing that she was impulsive enough to simply chase after Shoji was nice and shows that she's still growing. Still wants a nice wedding and a house with a yard and 2.5 kids, she's that kind of gal. She looks nice all dressed up for work though; I was surprised to see her pick herself up that quickly after the store closed and go for another job.

Junko's job in this show is to knock some sense into her friends and I'm all for that. Unfortunately that just makes Shoji think more about who he actually wants to be with and it's apparently not Hachi. He said he wanted to marry her but it's all just words; he never really seemed to show that much dedication to her in practice.

It's sad seeing [Hachi so happy with Nana](http://i.imgur.com/BGZg5Oj.png) while [Shoji is wavering](http://i.imgur.com/mJ3EG4F.png) and then, finally... [the](http://i.imgur.com/W9pwcts.png) [levee](http://i.imgur.com/dDjFnVb.png) [breaks](http://i.imgur.com/dQRtX9x.png). I can't be mad at Sachiko, I've *been* Sachiko before, with that kind of moment, and I understand her feelings all too well.

The thing is, I know this is going to be good for Hachi in the long run. It's going to hurt **a lot** as she noted at the end but she'll grow, become independent, and be stronger in the end.

The execution in this episode is *fantastic* and it's easily my favorite of the show so far.

Yeah I really liked that, love seeing her realize things that should have been a bit obvious haha

So happy about that, I thought she would blow out her moms money or rely on her friends/NANA

Hope so!!

* Mom is quite caring in her own way.
* Being drunk makes you lose your inhibition, so I assume Nana does have some feelings for Yasu
* "it wouldnt be right" to crash at Nana's ?? I watched the whole 47 episodes and cant remember why
* Oh yes Yasu's totally popular with women.
* Hachi's looking hot in a blazer
* The eyes in this anime have been bugging me for a while. Left and right eyes can have different size, shape or looking at different direction. So creepy.
* Shouji and Hachi are romantics who love the idea of love.
* Hachi's way hotter than Sachiko. Sachiko the Sexy Tokyo Wife on the other hand ...
* Cute girls tearing up are nearly irresistible. Was it on purpose ?

Her sister...wow seems like her fam is happy she's gone and all grown up ha

NANA and Yasu's relationship is great haha

I like professional Nana! Hope she gets it!

Sachiko seems like she would be easier to date haha

Junko with the justice!

Awe wanted to hear the band again

I actually feel bad for Sachiko :(

She got the job!!! :D

11.5 Recap:

* Hahaha, love the turnaround narration from Nana in the prologue.
* Yeah! Let's freakin' tear down that 4th wall!
* Would have been an even better recap with continuous berating commentary by Junko during the flash-backs.
* Just noticed the bar top in Jackson Hole. Cool looking, but probably kinda impractical and hard to clean properly.
* Come to think of it, maybe a band member is worth more than Vivienne, much longer kiss than she gave the groupie.
* Woot, Sachiko gets her own recap. I guess she'll be an important character.

12:

* They didn't translate it, but Kyosuke said he likes 'ganguro' girls like Junko in episode 11 as a tongue-in-cheek joke. Hachi's sister Nami is an actual [ganguro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganguro).
* NANA had the same reaction I did to that phone call.
* That's a weird kitchen sink. 
* Haha, Junko spouting cool lines.
* Just friends! ... with benefits. Yup, that happened.
* I actually really like Sachiko. I wonder if she'll still be a regular character if Shouji breaks things off with her or Hachi.
>> ARTICLE

So when people talk about this being a "realistic" romance is it just because everyone has affairs/cheats haha
>> ARTICLE
>So when people talk about this being a "realistic" romance is it just because everyone has affairs/cheats haha

No that's not the reason why, well in my opinion its not. The characters are quite unique to me. The all have their unique flaws and strong points and the charaters behave and act the way that you would expect them to based off past information. Also its not the fact that they cheat its how they handle the cheating. It's not some random fling. The show builds it up in a way that is realistic that can/does happen in real life and it shows the charaters struggle with there decisions. Sachiko new what she was doing wasn't right but she couldn't help herself, Shoji was trying to make up his made about what to do with the situation when the situation and his passion took over and he lost control.

I do know that this comment could be made as a joke just thought i would reply with my opinion. a bias one at that. Nanas in my top 5 =p

Haha I loved Amagami SS, its probs close to my top ten but the reason it doesn't break into my top 5 is because these shows generally had lasting effects on me. In the case of Nana its the first manga I have ever read.

They're really different anime, he enjoyed Amagami SS but enjoyed Nana even more so that says a lot about Nana. Usually when someone enjoys Amagami SS they enjoy it a lot!
>> ARTICLE
> So when people talk about this being a "realistic" romance is it just because everyone has affairs/cheats haha

That's part of it. Really, this is the first romance series I've seen where I can say that I've been in situations like this, I know how they're feeling, and they act in the same way I have before even if it's one poor decision after another. Relationships can be messy with temptation pulling them in different directions and mistakes are made, the kind of mistakes I and my friends have made that you can't necessarily take back or make up for. I'm really curious to see how Hachi handles this, or if she even finds out for a while.

It's a far cry from every high school romance I've seen but the closest match to my own experience there would be Rihoko's arc in Amagami SS. ^(...and maybe that's part of why things went the way they did for me in college.)
>> ARTICLE
Made it again! Although a little late this term. Time differences really suck.

I forgot how hilarious Nami is with her fashion but more so with the I fleeting and carefree attitude. 

Also, nice to see where Hachi gets her features and surprised face expression. 

Oh Yasu. I didn't like him the first time I watched this epsilon because he seemed like a user. Gladly I dropped that thought quickly because he is the best thing about this show (besides the drama). 

First time we get to see Nana truly happy, drunk on his lap humming her own song. 

 Now onto over analysing Hachi. 

Great example of how she has little thought for her own relationship, lack of maturity, and generally quite selfish. 

Thinking about Yasu as a partner, she immediately defends Nana's supposed relationship with him, thr  hers. 

If there was a list of priorities, Shouji and their relationship would be last. 

Sadly, it makes sense why he would fall for Sachiko. Besides actually being around him and actively seeking him out, for him, she seems to actually care about his own feelings and trying to make him happy. Contrast with Hachi, and either forgetting about him completely, thinking about him in passing, she only seeks him out when she needs help or assurance. 

Not to say that cheating on her was justified at all, just that he had emotionally moved on and just needed to actually break up with Nana. Drama starts now! 

And this is why I truly enjoy the show. Everyone is utterly flawed. I enjoy the hell out of every character (bar one), but in reality they are all selfish, self-centred and critical of others. 

What Honey and Clover does to bittersweet feelings represented by fun, cute characters, Nana does to drama with flawed characters you wouldn't really be friends with. 

All about that human condition and if you can grow from dramatic experiences. Why I love the show. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep. My hope that the Hachi x Shoji ship would quietly return to harbor and go their own ways have been dashed against the rocks. Seems like this'll be a painful ending. We'll see just how much of a bastard Shoji'll be, but he should've just broken up with Hachi and then pursued Sachiko. I dislike how conflicted he is, how he says/thinks one thing (wanting to marry Nana) and then completely does the opposite. At the same time, I'm not a fan of the pairing at all, so I'm glad he's fucked things up.

I also apparently need to stop being 12 hours late to these threads.


>> ARTICLE
The cold opening with Nana K saying *all* she ever wanted to be was a beautiful bride.  Yep, that's a huge problem, Nana.  Unfortunately, you have a lot of company in that.

Well, 300K yen (~$3,000) for a wedding?  And don't ever come back?  Jeez, thanx, momz.  Also her sister looks ridiculous in that ganguro getup.

Haha, drunk Nana O is cute as hell.  And that pained stumbling she does in the morning is pretty realistic.

Whoa, Young Professional Nana K is kinda hot.

Shoji feels like he can relax when he's with Sachiko.  Conversely, that must mean he feels like he *can't* relax when he's around Nana K.  If you were thinking straight, Shoji, that would be all the information you need as to who you should actually be with.  Take it from one who has made bad decisions along these lines based on some kind of misplaced notion of what's "right".  Jun's admonishment notwithstanding.  (Hahaha, and Jun *immediately* about-faces on him when he brings up marriage and going together to the grave.)

Aw, we only get a photo montage for the band practice session with Nana K joining in.  That would have been fun!

"Let's walk while we talk."  And then she trails him by like ten feet.

The crying scene.  Poor Sachiko.  I think she and Nana K would be good friends if they all were to straighten this out.  But that intensifying tiptoe looks ominous.  And the way Shoji seems to feel he has a duty to comfort her just sets things in motion.

Jeez, show.  Not fair.  I had to rewind that final sequence like five times trying to pay attention to it all.  Nana K waxing philosophical about how "we wouldn't have been left with only happy memories" if Nana O had been the (male) love of Nana K's life, and the *wham* moment of Shoji and Sachiko goin' at it, right under it.  And then a changed ending visual too.

If only you could have held off till you could've broken it off with Nana K, Shoji.  Well, maybe that will be his very next action, at least?  Heh?  Eh, who am I kidding, he'll try to backpedal and pretend it never happened and everything will get super messy and hurtful.

Well, looks like the proverbial shit's really fixin' to hit the fan right quick

This episode felt shorter than the last one.

* Ren smokes the same cigarettes Nana usually does, Seven Stars. Or is it that Nana usually smokes the same cigarettes Ren does... Her switch to Black Stone could have been her leaning towards going after Yasu.
* Ren's bittersweet backstory. Surprising that not even Nana had known.
* Haha, I was just thinking Hachi should ask Nana to get Takumi's autograph.
* Lol, Junko's shocked reaction at Hachi not judging solely on external appearances
* Oh. She's giving up smoking. [I was wondering about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3atwub/spoilers_nana_rewatch_episode_10_discussion_thread/csfvw5s) back in episode 10.
* Hmm, what was that [look Ren gave Nobu](http://i.imgur.com/yPgunoZ.png) when he said lots of vocalists smoke?
* Total dream come true for Hachi.
* I wonder if Nana will successfully quit smoking; she's got one lit up in the new ED.

I wonder if Hachi will actually get fired. Her boss does seem like a bit of a softie, so it could go either way. Hope she doesn't go crazy with her severance pay if she does.

Nana smoked Seven Stars because of Ren. On the money about switching to Black Stone.

**Episode 19**

Hachi wants a coldhearted guy. I don't think she truly understands what that entails. It's good for her to get a guy that puts his foot down on matters, but I don't think she'll like that. Takumi looks like a coldhearted guy.

Aww they are taking a back together, just like old times. Roses wither over time, but it seems like their love hasn't.

Nana isn't answering Hachi's question lolll

Nana is blushing :o that is pretty lame for her

I like Hachi's hair, looks hilarious.

That Reina pic :o Nana looks jealous looking at it.

Hachi is so getting fired.

Takumi arrives. What a great episode. I really like the song starless night. Pretty much all Reira's songs.

And now we have Hachi fantasizing over Yasu. Hehehe, although it's basically a crush, it's nice to see her get back on her feet, eventhough there really was not time between her break up to now. Says a lot about her, and the relationship.

Loved the ending of this video. Not for Takumi and Hachi's shocked expression (which is cute), but her tears because of what Nana will do for her. These two would be stuck to the hip for life, and possibly share the same funeral casket.

Biggest smile on my face during that final scene =D
>> ARTICLE
She doesn't want a boyfriend that's nice to her because it'll only hurt more when he betrays her? Poor Hachi's broken.

The initial look in Ren's room with Nana missing got me, I forgot about their bath thing and thought she had left entirely. And I like that while Nana didn't want him to dictate where she ends up, she really does want to be with Ren in the end. Nana's reaction the next day when Hachi semi-correctly assumes they got back together is great. A little embarrassed, a little happy.

The whole Takumi thing is fun too, particularly with him getting the door for Hachi at the end. Unfortunately(?) Junko put the idea of dating Yasu in her head and I don't see that going away any time soon or ending well for her. Oh, and she probably got fired from her job, but I don't think she really cares about that so much.

Also I like the new visuals for the ED but I don't imagine they'll stay long. I did like all of the panning landscape shots too in the previous versions, forgot to mention that.

And as for the Vulcan salute, I've definitely imagined that a couple of times, but my PS skills are sorely lacking.

Reira's songs can be thought of as an expression of Ren's feelings, so the change itself symbolizes that Ren's wait is over, but still feels some sadness at the distance still left between them.

I'm not sure what to think of the visuals yet, other than the pan and zooming out being nicely done.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. I was influenced by the visuals as well as the tone of Hachi's narrations when I was trying to make sense of the ED - I assumed the lyrics were referring to Nana and Hachi .

As for the visuals themselves, I absolutely love the panning/zooming out. Hachi's forlorn stare at the reflected image of Nana on the floor above her being revealed piecemeal sent shivers down my spine. What do we see in Hachi's eyes? Envy? Longing? Fear? A whole lot of different things, I'm sure. Nowadays, the visuals make me tear up a bit. This is my favorite ED visual sequence by far, but melody-wise, the next ED is my favorite.
>> ARTICLE
> I assumed the lyrics were referring to Nana and Hachi

It totally could refer to them too, but taking into account the prologue in the last episode where Hachi says Ren was the lyricist for most of Trapnest's songs, it confirmed for me that the ending songs are really about Nana & Ren's relationship. "Write what you know" and all that.
>> ARTICLE
> What's your reading on the color of the eyes and tattoo for this one?

Red lotus: Ren. Red eyes: crying. ^(or maybe werewolf but I don't think it's going to be that kind of show)

They may or may not be connected, I'm not sure. I don't think Ren would ever get involved with Hachi though, so probably some other guy making her sad... maybe Takumi?

Or I'm thinking about it too much and it just fits the end of this episode. Hachi's crying because she's happy about the whole thing, and Nana's back with Ren now.
>> ARTICLE
>  Poor Hachi's broken.

Maybe this was discussed in an earlier episode thread but what's the connection between the the Black Stone Cherry cigarettes Yasu smokes and the actual band Black Stone Cherry?  There's no way something like that would show up independent of each other.
>> ARTICLE
[These guys](http://www.blackstonecherry.com)? Good question. The manga for Nana came out about a year before they formed. But I could see it being a a coincidence- trying to think of a name and noticing a pack of cigarettes (It's a real brand, which was discussed in ~~the last~~ [episode 17's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3bms5a/spoilers_nana_rewatch_episode_17_discussion_thread/csocy4b)). Black Stone does sound like a band name. You should ask via their contact form and let us know if you get an answer.

Heh, check this out:

http://puregrainaudio.com/interviews/black-stone-cherry3

>Where did you come up with the name Black Stone Cherry? Is there any deeper meaning behind it?

>Chris: Actually man, we got the name from a cigar box. It was Black Stone Cigars with a cherry flavour so we decided to divide into three words instead of two. And after realizing what the name was, we found it did have some meaning, because our band is really influenced by soul and blues so I guess the black part of it would be that and then of course the hard rock for stoned and the cherry is just a little something on top for the girls. I mean, its one of those things that just happened and made total sense after the fact.

Looks like same company, slightly different product.  The cigars instead of the cigarillos.

The cold opening with Nana K musing about what kind of guy she wants next  "someone who's a little harsh", who doesn't do every little thing she wants.  I'm wondering how she imagines anyone she's been with so far has done every little things she wants.  But this wanting someone "harsh", who argues, then makes up with her.  That is such a BS fantasy thing to want, Nana.  All you're asking for is fighting, and trust me, it doesn't end up romantic and sweet.

Rose-petal bath?  How uncharacteristically decadent of you, Nana O!  I've never had one, but it strikes me as the kind of thing that looks good on film and works out horribly in real life.

Ren, you nostalgic old softie, you.  His whole little story about the apartment and its origins, and how he pictures its destiny as his retirement pad is kinda touching, but I seem to remember both the place and its environs as kind of a shithole.

I know Nana O's request about "retiring" with Ren is supposed to sound sweet, but it sounds a little like she's requesting to spend her youth away from him, then when she's all burnt out and used up, to go back with him.  :/

"You're not very good at figuring things out, are you Hachi?"  Uh, no, Nana O, not all the time.  You of all people should realize

Takumi's *autograph*?  C'mon, girl, shoot for the stars!

Haha, Nana K gets her own-style cartoon eyes!

"From what I can see, your garden's ripe for harvest."  Oh, *wow*.

Am I the only one who finds it a little hilarious that it took Jun specifically putting the idea in Nana K's head before she even considered going for any members of Blast?

Jun's shocked that Nana K's seeing non-superficial qualities in guys.  I was about to chastise her for that, but come to think of it, I guess that's a pretty fair critique of Nana K's selection process so far.

Whoa, doesn't take much to get Nana K to lock on to a new target, eh?

Pretty dense little sequence of messed-up stuff from Nana K.  Lies about being dumped, in order to manipulate Yasu, but decides nice guys are bad because they screw you over too but it's worse?  Yikes.  You're really heading down a road toward being screwed up, y'know that?

Dang, Shin, they even had to bleep you on the DVD!

What's with all the Nana-O-flipping-people-off all of a sudden?  Heh!  And suddenly she's on a health kick.  She must want to live a long time with Ren.  Sweet.

Nana K's cute-power ran out at work.  Whoops.  Well, so much for that job.

D'aww, that Takumi-treat for Nana K.

>> ARTICLE
>Am I the only one who finds it a little hilarious that it took Jun specifically putting the idea in Nana K's head before she even considered going for any members of Blast?

I think there's a couple of factors at play. First off, Shin is too young. Then there's Yasu, who Hachi had initially assumed to be dating Nana and later on just regarded as a father figure/older brother once they became friends. Nobu is the only one that is really "available", but we don't know if he has a girlfriend at this point and some early signs seemed to suggest he had a thing for Nana. Unlike when she had to tell herself to befriend Shoji back in art school, she naturally became friends with all three while already in a relationship of her own, so she didn't see them as potential objects of affection (well, maybe with the exception of Yasu). 

>And suddenly she's on a health kick. She must want to live a long time with Ren. Sweet.

Oh, I never thought of it like that. I just assumed the health kick was about being in tip top shape as a vocalist to compete with Reira.

Could be that too.  But I assumed from her wanting *everyone* to stop smoking

Great episode again. This show has recently left me in a good mood after each episode. I really liked the ending.

I really do not see Hachi x Yasu happening though. I want that Hachi x Nobu instead!

Also, damn, I realized I'll be traveling when this rewatch ends.

Yasu takes the award for best wingman title hands down. Anybody knows the name of the Trapnest song at the beginning?

"Recorded Butterflies" - Olivia Lufkin inspi' Reira
>> ARTICLE
Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
I had guessed so, but she confirms in the prologue narration that Ren wrote most of the songs. I really think there's a thing to the "I'm here waiting for you" chorus.
 
* Reira is surprisingly childish, I'm surprised she can keep up her elegant facade. Reminds me that I've heard Gwen Stefani is actually ditzy in person.
* Oh snap, he did notice didn't he? He even got called out for making a mistake. I [predicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3bms5a/spoilers_nana_rewatch_episode_17_discussion_thread/cso71z9) he would make a mistake if he saw her, but if they showed it on screen, he covered it enough to fool me.
* Yup. Oh snap, Yasu! I don't think he's kidding either.
* Nana takes the initiative, then lost it with a "I missed you."

Well, he didn't jump down from the stage to embrace her like Hachi imagined, but Yasu did tell him to. haha

**Nana episode 18:**

Reira with the gun is soo cool.
She must have incredible talent. 
In fact listening to her songs, she definitely got some! 

Her entire band is so cool. 

By now you should know that her voice actor voices Haruhi! Love her voice .

He definitely noticed NANA. Is this really happening? The surprise reunion was really a surprise.

Yasu wants to steal NANA haha, but he's a good friend and he thinks about Ren first. 

More Hachi family :D

Omg the reunion is happening :O
And more Reira :D :D :D
\#TeamReira

NANA is stubborn and Hachi is naive. 

Omg the tension. They are sooooo getting back together.

We now know that Yasu was the one that got Ren the job.

Nice to see the facade of "rockstars" drop and they have their own quirky personalities, or annoying ones. 

Oh Nana, why did you go do a thing like go to the hotel room.

Yeah, Yasu throwing down the gauntlet. More Yasu! Suck it, Ren! 

Nobu with the tile flick. Really like how all these cool musicians just sit around playing board/card games. :) 

Oh Hachi, the last little monologue pains me a little. We've all been there. 

Also, Nana and Ren, identical personalities. Never a good thing, right? 
>> ARTICLE

I see a lot or difference in there personality but i'm a re watcher so i will keen my head down on this one as you get to know Ren better in the coming episodes.

I love the quirkyness of the characters, makes them a lot easier to like!
>> ARTICLE
Nana K, always rooting for Nana O, whether in love or in rockin' it the the big leagues.

Haha, Yasu's like the puppetmaster Nana K strives to be.  Has everything under control and at the end of a string.  Although I'm not sure "I'll take her for myself" is really how these things work.  Judging by Nana O's interactions with him, it look possible, granted.

Nana O's reaction to being called "a cute girl" is priceless.  But again we see discrimination rearing it's ugly head.  Poor dad, getting called names for being normal!

Nana K turned her phone off for the concert.  My, how times change.

I guess they're not the "trash the hotel room after an orgy" kind of rockers, and more the "play cards quietly and go to bed early" kind of rockers.

Man, he let that phone ring a long time.  I was sure he was just going to sleep through it and it would be more misunderstandings on the way.

Dang, those are some old-school keys.

Nana O.  Why the painful, stubborn pride?  Also kinda funny how Ren and Nana O just happen to have worn nearly identical jeans that night.

And Blast is just as homey a band as Trapnest is.  Mahjong vs. cards.

The story about Takumi calling Yasu to help persuade Ren to leave Blast is odd.  How would that call have gone?  "Hey, you mind helping me out in ruining your band?"
>> ARTICLE
Well I mean, in order for them to poach Ren off of them I feel like they're all  friends. At least that's what I thought on my first time. You'll see how it plays out
>> ARTICLE
> Nana K turned her phone off for the concert. My, how times change.

Probably partly because bands and such are super strict about recording devices in Japan.

> Dang, those are some old-school keys.

I've noticed that throughout the series. Room 707 has old-timey keys too, despite just having the locks replaced. They went for style over realism for that aspect.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm not sure "I'll take her for myself" is really how these things work

The wording there is definitely more blunt than necessary, but I'm sure Yasu just means if Ren isn't going to man up that he was going to go after Nana instead. 

>Nana K turned her phone off for the concert. My, how times change.

Haha, that was my reaction too. When was the last time I had to turn off my phone for a non-classical concert?

>The story about Takumi calling Yasu to help persuade Ren to leave Blast is odd. How would that call have gone? "Hey, you mind helping me out in ruining your band?"

This kind of gets clarified later on. Kind of. At least it'll make a little more sense.

Yep, now every concert is a sea of phones being held aloft.  :/

I figured it might be something like that.  Some relationship between them that we're not privy to yet.

So I was watching the episode on the bus into work today, and I got to the point where Nana stands up in the bath and the person sitting next to me gave me a funny look so I decided to stop watching it at the time.

**Episode 18**

That concert must have stung for NANA

Seriously all I think I want from this series is for Yasu to be a badass lawyer and for NANA/blast to make it big...if those happen I'll leave happy

Yasu with the cool line too!!

Reina seems pretty cool, like her so far!

She was so cool on the phone but wow when they're together...

You can tell they really care for each other

Well NANA and Ren are back...for now
>> ARTICLE
Reina is adorable at the start. Out of the bunch, she's pretty cute/nice, but wait till you see more of Naoki. Hilariously character from Trapnest.

I actually liked the transition from seeing Ren during the concert to wanting to be on that stage and sing, for Nana. Shows her passion. 

Yeah the chemistry between Ren and Nana is insane, but blah, Ren. 
>> ARTICLE
Looking forward to seeing more of Naoki then :p
>> ARTICLE
Sadly not a whole lot, as he's incredibly nice/funny and doesn't cause drama. :(
>> ARTICLE
Should be more characters like him!!
>> ARTICLE
But then it would be just a romcom. 


...  I see what you are trying to do. 
>> ARTICLE
:D
>> ARTICLE
The way that Nana was staring up at the stage after Trapnest left has always made me wonder what exactly went through her mind during those two hours. I'm sure there were lots of thoughts about her relationship with Ren, but I also like to think that she was thinking about her own future as well. She saw Trapnest/Ren on that huge stage and set her eyes on attaining at least that much for Blast. Her tears were of both sorrow for her relationship as well as joy for Ren having achieved his dream.
>> ARTICLE
>  but I also like to think that she was thinking about her own future as well.

I felt she was jealous or that she wanted to be the one on the stage but then seeing Ren after yeah...pretty powerful!
>> ARTICLE
Since this is stupidly late, my quick rundown:

* Ren is still antsy about Nana, I see.
* Hachi cares about Nana and acts appropriately.
* Reira (I'm tempted to just call her Layla) is... interesting. Not sure what to make of her yet.
* Yasu pushed Ren to join Trapnest. Wonder if that will turn Nana against him or is it okay since Ren's back in the picture now?
* Woo, Nana and Ren reunited! But is it a good thing?
>> ARTICLE
I like Reira. I get a bad feeling she's interested in Ren, though, because that'd always make for more drama.

Shin still amazing as always. Yasu avoided answering his question regarding what he said - maybe he meant what he said to Ren.

It takes me a while to watch these episode because I'm always expecting something sad or dramatic to happen and have an aversion to that (probably why I hate most American TV, everything is a god damn drama), but the episodes really suck me in. The comedy moments certainly help ease the tension of the show's mood.



>> ARTICLE
I really like how both NANAs route for each other in what they want. I really enjoy Reira as a character I want more or her.
>> ARTICLE
* /u/Atario called it. Neighbors were even more pissed than I expected, haha.
* Rock that tambourine, Hachi.
* Nobu was surprisingly sharp, didn't spill the beans when Hachi asked about the bassist.
* Wonder how much the cigarettes will affect Nana's voice. Seven Stars is one of the low tar ones at least.
* I can't even begin on the Sachiko thing.

Sudden urge to re-watch [Beck](http://myanimelist.net/anime/57/Beck).

Hah!  As one who has lived in apartments, it was the first thing to come to mind.  Hell, right now I live in a house, and when the band a couple houses down practices, in their closed garage, I still grind my teeth from the noise

And yeah she smokes a lot! Watching this along with Haibane Renmei and I'm not sure I've this much smoking on screen at a time before haha

Oh Hachi, how I love your segue thoughts, transitioning from being yelled at to Yamada-san's PJ and night life with possible escorts.

Talk about Yasu more, not Ren. Yasu is godly after all. 


I don't know why, but anime details really attractive bars that I wish to frequent. 


Perfect example of people that think sex will solve communication problems. Oh Hachi...

Usually I get annoyed if a series continues to use the same song when there is a band involved (K-On being the main culprit), but I do enjoy this song quite a bit, plus the way it varies depending on who is playing.

Oh look, Ren... yay.... eh.

Aaaaah, it's really fun rewatching this to see the friendship between both Nana's blossom.

Besides Miu (character later on), Yasu is hands down the most intriguing and engrossing character in the show.

It's a great OP, and wipes the other two OPs that'll come up. Third one isn't so bad but three is a lack of raw energy and feeling that resonates with the show.

>> I really want to try that burger...

> Tell me how Japan is. :P

Pretty much the only good burgers here are the ones you cook yourself. :(  (Which in itself is hard, since they only sell super-lean ground beef. Gotta grind the meat yourself too.)

Only place I've found here that comes close to a decent burger joint is [Kua Aina](http://www.kua-aina.com), but I think they've changed suppliers- their meat isn't so great anymore, though when decked with practically a whole avocado I don't mind so much.
>> ARTICLE
Ouch. That's gotta be tough to deal with, as a burger is enjoyable. 

How about fast food places? They always look immaculate and high end (in appearance at least). 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not a fan of fast food, but [Mos Burger](http://mos.jp) at least has some somewhat authentic chili con carne. (my first experience eating a chilidog in Japan was at Komeda Coffee in Nagoya- their idea of one is a hotdog with lettuce and smidge of spicy ketchup. I felt insulted.)

[Lotteria](http://lotteria.jp) (from Korea) and McDonalds are the other two big chains. Lotteria is just nasty. The quality at McDonalds looks better than the US ones, but smaller, pricer burgers. I haven't eaten at a McDonalds for about 20 years now though so can't comment on the taste.

I know this isn't a yuri show but damn that chemistry between Hachi and Nana. My yuri goggles can hardly take it. That was adorable. I'm a little worried about Shoji and this Satchiko though. I thought Hachi might be the one to cheat but now I'm not so sure. I guess it's pessimistic to think someone's going to cheat but apparently there's a road of feels up ahead. Looking forward to how their relationship develops and I sincerely hope we see more intimacy between them, sooner or later.

He seems like a good guy deep inside and a bit naive also. He's already made it into her bed so why not :p
>> ARTICLE
So much happened in this one! Where to start...

Nothing good happens in 707, eh? Hachi quickly made up her own interpretation of what that means, though I'm guessing it's not actually a murder. I was half expecting Nana to kick Hachi out of her room after Nobu was already asleep in the other one, but I guess she's not that cruel.

Shinichi [sounded really familiar](http://myanimelist.net/people/17/Akira_Ishida) and I realized he reminded me of Ryuunosuke in Fate/Zero, but I did *not* think that he's also the voice of Katsura in Gintama. Funny that he also loves Ren and Nana challenges him to become better. And there's a real Sachiko now on Shoji's end, though she seems nicer than the imaginary one we've come to know.

A couple new ways to strain Hachi's relationship with Shoji, and they were already not in a great spot. They do care for each other, but do they care *enough* to make it work? The true strength of relationships are revealed from being tested, and it looks like they're going to have a tough time ahead. Were this any other anime I wouldn't even be concerned because you'd *know* they were going to have a happy ending together, but here I doubt it.
>> ARTICLE
> but I guess she's not that cruel.

Yeah I'm always expecting Nana to be meaner then she is. She's a total sweetheart usually.

> but do they care enough to make it work? 

My money's on no but hey I'm still rooting for them!

>  I wouldn't even be concerned because you'd know they were going to have a happy ending together, but here I doubt it.

Haha my thoughts exactly!

**Episode 10:**

Title: "The Handsome Youth, Shin, Appears!" YES!

Yeah of course they got in trouble.

Haha "I don't have sex with girls"

Shoji and Hachi look like their still going strong. Nice! Hmm maybe not...

When Hachi makes a friend she goes really hard, which is nice but it's incredibly excessive and it's obviously hurting her relationship.

A girl named Sachiko works at Shoji's work? What a coincidence haha.

He reminds her of Ren and his favorite guitarist is Ren...

I love how they know Ren's life but not the fact that he used to be in Black Stones.
Hachi is happy that she got a bass player haha. 

Nana leaving girls shocked haha, seems like a theme. 

They take the same train home together...will Shoji break..? Nah since Junko says he'll never cheat.

Aww the final scene was cute. Makes the whole Hachi talking into the future very ominous.

It's a little weird that at this point they still have *no idea* that Nana and Ren were in a band together. And I'm surprised that Nobu's keeping quiet too.

Feels to me like they're purposely keeping their history with Ren somewhat secret.  Like they don't want to look like hangers-on or braggarts or whatever.  Plus the basic touchy "everything ended on a painful note" situation of it.

Junko better be right!

Really cute how they keep giving Nana K puppy ears and tail, heh.

How is Nobu so surprised Nana K works?  Don't people have to work to pay rent?  Nana O is the weird one here, man!

Haha, Nana K feels she has to explain to Nobu what a tambourine is.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised Nana K immediately takes up trying to put a band together for Nana O.  It's just the kind of project she would love to bite into.  Matchmaking of a sort.

"I don't do it with girls, ok?"  Aw, ya tease.

This little bit with the text message/email and who noticed it and who didn't and when and who feels bad about it and why such a shoujo plot point, heh.

Geez, Nana K!  Only 20 and already a cougar!

Ahhhh hahaha the real Sachiko shows up.  Noice.

Nana O:  too cool for paper.

Shinichi's a big fan of Ren, and plays like him too.  Small world!

"Play better than Ren".  Hm, is that simple encouragement, or a touch of "we'll show *him!*"?

BOOM goes the dynamite, dat kiss.  I guess we should have seen this coming from the groupie kiss early on!

Hachiko does good lol

Huh.  I didn't expect the show to address the name "Trapnest" if it hadn't by now.  I wondered at first when it was introduced, but then I just let it go, as with most band names.  But, uh, yeah, that bodes somewhat ill.

What the?  Takumi made Ren drive that car?  What a weird level of image management from a band member.

Hahah, "Why are Japanese people so into mushy love stuff?  I want to write about world peace or something!"  Because everyone is, Reira!  Songs about world peace sound like a great idea, but a few of them go a long way.  Also, I didn't realize they delegated the lyrics to Reira.  I sorta assumed the songwriting process under Ren and/or Takumi included that part.

Shin being the level-headed practical adult and bringing Reira back down to earth is fairly hilarious to me.  But then he finally seems to get no-foolin' romantic with her, after all that "just a gigolo" stuff.

Again with grapefruit.  Is that supposed to be a morning sickness cure or something?  Also, hell of a way for Nana O to find out about all this!  Also also, I just want to point out how dangerous [these shoes](http://i.imgur.com/jnxV9rE.jpg) look.

Holy shit.  Nobu dropping truth bombs on Nana O left and right.

"*You* [, Nana K,] are a *mess*."  Well, you're not wrong there, Takumi.  "Your parents are gonna cry."  Hahh, not so fast, Mr. Rich Famous Rock Star Son-In-Law.

Somewhat surprised Takumi and Nobu didn't come to blows right there in the doorway.  Even had a little comedy moment.

Suddenly Nana K seems to realize the iffy nature of her "breakup" with Takumi.  Just in time to hurt Nobu the most.

Reira still insisting she hasn't found a boyfriend, despite all this with Shin.  Denial ain't just a river in Egypt!

Well, despite how Takumi hopes Nana O didn't run back to Ren's place, I kinda hope she did.  There's not many other places for her to be, since she seems to have just run away altogether.  I half expect her to hole up in some abandoned warehouse again.

Not much to say about the episode, but the emotions were really there.

* So Reira writes some songs too.
* Ren actually not a car guy, heh.
* And it just all clicked for Nana. But she runs away- to Ren or to Yasu? I bet Yasu.

This episode really turned heads at my friend's place.

Oh?  Do tell!

Hah, not much to tell. I decided to watch Nana before hopping on the train home since it was close to the discussion posting time. He started watching [Overlord](http://myanimelist.net/anime/29803/Overlord). A few minutes later, he was watching Nana.
>> ARTICLE
(Heh, I'm following that show too.)

I imagined someone heard "miscarriage" or something and went "whoa, what?".
>> ARTICLE
Daaaamn Takumi fucked everything up. Go Takumi.
>> ARTICLE
Takumi did nothing wrong!
>> ARTICLE
I found him to be pretty good in this episode :O
>> ARTICLE
He might be a scumbag behind the scenes but from what the anime has shown us, I don't think he's a bad guy.
>> ARTICLE
Well, there is a right and wrong way to handle something, then there is the Takumi way. 

Plus a you know a big part of it was his ego not wanting to lose to Nobu, even if it's taking care of a newborn, even if it isn't his. 
>> ARTICLE
Poor Ren isn't a car guy. :c Luckily Kinoshita seems so happy to drive it home with him. [Manga Spoiler](/s " However, that line about getting into an 'accident' seemed to be foreshadowing a lot about the future, especially involving Ren and what happened to him.  :c " )


Seeing that Nana wants Nobu to be the father, seems to remind me of how she desperately wants to keep Hachi in her garden. I get she hates Takumi, but she doesn't want to lose Hachi to Trapnest for good, perhaps? 


It is nice to see that Takumi was willing to do something about the kid, rather than casually play it off and say abort the baby. Although, I do feel extremely bad for Nobu. I would cheer him on and say 'Take up the kid instead!' but, obviously, he has to do a lot to beat Takumi in this case. ; __ ; 

>> ARTICLE
**Episode 32**

That poster intro was pretty cool :O

Reina and Shin seem to have a interesting dynamic. Reina's voice is just so cute :3

This other drummer giving Nana way too much credit

Being the father of someone else's kid...that's a lot to ask...

Takumi showing a pretty good side

She can't face him...don't see Nobu being able to get past this

>> ARTICLE
Soul crushing for both Nobu and Hachi, and great of Nobu to actually call out Nana for being so greedy, that she'll even use to friends to get what she ultimately wants.

[Manga spoilers](/s "If Nana stuck around and met Satsuki, she would have loved her as Hachi does.")

Future Nana, knowing how bad she is, and wanting to own the people closest to her.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who enjoys dubs, this anime has been excellent. Takumi's VA did especially well this episode.
>> ARTICLE
**"You know, Hachi... I wanted to keep you by my side, even if it meant putting a collar around your neck. I was afraid of myself for thinking that, so I always kept a little distance between us. Even now, I can't make friends easily. I'm still...**

**afraid."**

And fucking BAM! Just like that, the show turns the tables on the character roles. One of the best episodes from a character perspective, as our heroes falter when the bad guy steps up his act. 

The one coming off particularly bad here, is Nana O. A side we have seen glimpses of before is revealed in full: she's needy, a bit selfish and her we see her go way too far to get what she wants. When Nobu confronts her about it, her deepest hidden emotion comes out: she's instantly afraid of herself, of how possessive and manipulative she can become to get that love that she wants. She runs away, because she is so immensely afraid of that underlying person. Afraid of the Nana that needs so much love (first OP reference here). Afraid of a Nana that she thinks is unable to give any love and subsequently does not deserve the love she wants. What a tangle of emotions, but the most important part is when that shell cracks, she is not just afraid: she is petrified of herself. 

Nobu doesn't come off too well, either. He is a sweetheart, a good natured guy. But here he is a coward. Takumi laid out his cards for him and while it's a shitty thing to do, he is right in his assessment, as usual. Takumi forces him to make a choice, for all of their sake. Hachi needs him now more than ever. Nobu needs to man the fuck up and be there. If he truly wants Hachi, he has to make a call **RIGHT NOW.** 

He could tell her his decision, tell her he would help raise the baby if she so wished, even if it isn't his. Logistics can be figured out: there are more than enough people to share the load with and willing/obligated to do so. He can tell her his preference, but that he would support her no matter what. He could throw down the gauntlet to Takumi and since he has Hachi's love, he would probably win no matter what she decides.  

But he doesn't. He lets it pass by. He falters when the need is highest. By not pushing beyond the messy break-up, by not speaking up, he forfeits here. You can say what you want about Hachi not deserving him, or him being better off. But the truth of the matter is that he does want her. He just can't make the call. 

Takumi funnily... well, it's not exactly funny. Ironically? Doesn't matter. Anyway, he is the one that shines here. He handles this pretty damn well. Nobu needs to decide where he stands in all this. He asks Nana to support Hachi, doesn't antagonize her while she does do so vice-versa, let's Hachi answer Nana (which she doesn't do... oh Hachi, what never have you annoyed me more) and of course he keeps his cool. 

Even more interesting is that he tells Hachi exactly, right down to the damn letter, what she needs to hear. She needs to grow up and step up, because if she doesn't, there are going to be more pieces than just hers to pick up afterwards. He is even extremely gentle about it, for Takumi standards. But as viewers, he is the last person we wanted to have tell this to Hachi: it should be our heroes, but they falter. They need to make a stand... but time is running out.

There is one stray observation to make here, one that I missed on first viewing. Beneath everybody's favorite new romance of Shin and Reira, is a pretty damn tragic one between Reira and Takumi. She obviously loves him deeply and him not reciprocating that hurts her more than anything. 

But the sad thing is... he *does* love her. Notice Reira crying over the song, saying Ren is amazing. But earlier in the episode we are told that Ren writes those songs according to Takumi's instructions! It's *his* emotions for her that shine through in the song, not Ren's. 

Only question left unanswered is why Takumi doesn't return Reira's feelings. There are arguments to be made, but nothing is certain at this point. 

The song we heard Reira write lyrics for btw, is [Shadow of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jYaGWh2zs0). It's not entirely my cup of tea, but it's nice enough. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been waiting for this episode just for the opening narration. It's always been my favorite and what I remember from the show most clearly after all these years. It's so haunting and transitions so well for the episode and to the intro. 
>> ARTICLE
Jumbled quick thoughts:

* Ren is dedicated to Trapnest (at one point I was wondering if Shin and Ren could just switch bands)
* Reira and Shin need to keep doing their cute thing
* Naoki has completely the wrong impression about Hachi (if only she was smart enough to be that manipulative)
* Takumi's still an ass
* Hachi is understandably freaking out about all of this but can't lie to Nobu
* Would it even be lying? She thought she had broken things off with Takumi... or did she know it wasn't completely over and went to Nobu anyway?
* What's Nana doing?
>> ARTICLE
> Reira and Shin need to keep doing their cute thing

They are adorable when on screen :)

> Takumi's still an ass

I found him to be pretty rational this episode!
>> ARTICLE
I am actually curious what people think now about Nana. The first time watchers are now half way through; did Nana meet your expecations so far? And what would be the current score.
>> ARTICLE
It feels like a chore to watch sometimes. Current score maybe a 6 or 7. 
>> ARTICLE
Really?  I look forward to it every day
>> ARTICLE
We're pretty different then haha

What do look forward to? 
>> ARTICLE
Seeing what happens next; rooting for some happiness; enjoying the conversations and reactions.
>> ARTICLE
The strong point of NANA is that I dont know what to expect.


Its an emotional roller coaster yet at the same time I do not feel like I'm being cheaply manipulated by the author. The characters act like I feel they would given their characters and circumstances. This is in stark contrast with many shoujo / josei manga which often goes for the cheap shot ("lets break up") just to up the ante though it makes no sense whatsoever given the characters history and circumstance .
>> ARTICLE
> I dont know what to expect.

I just expect the worse thing that can happen and it sometimes happens :p

The characters' actions/decisions feel real but the situations feel as they do most other shows.

Like I wouldn't be surprised to have pregnancy come up sometime soon
>> ARTICLE
I got used to the art, thankfully. Beyond that, it's been a pretty entertaining watch, though it's difficult for me to watch at times. I'm always expecting something horrible to happen. Someone else put it better: "I'm enjoying the series, it's just one I need to mentally prep for." I also don't much care for our protagonist, Hachiko, especially as of now. Her stupidity/naivety creates drama though, so I can understand why she's the focus. It has a reputation for being a realistic romance, and that's true, but that's also partially a result of Hachiko being such a flawed person. The character cast in general is pretty realistic and original, in part due to the fact the show has almost no anime cliche elements. 


With regards to rating: this episode wasn't too entertaining for me; I like the slice of life elements and comedy elements much more than the drama, so ask me what I'd rate it right now and I'd say a 7 or 8, whereas a few episodes ago I'd have probably said a 8 or 9. My mean score is a 5.3, so regardless, those are all pretty high. It'd have to really leave a strong impact on me for the 9, and given the lack of an ending I'm not so sure if that'll happen.





>> ARTICLE
Hard to tell. Right now it's harsher than I was expecting going in and for the most part things keep looking bleaker for Hachi. I'm enjoying the series, it's just one I need to mentally prep for.

Sometimes their faces are a bit funny but nothing bad. After Kare Kano I can't say much against the artwork here. Music is solid despite not really being in my preferred genres and I like the different recordings of a couple songs, I just wish they had a *little* more variety or changed the frequency of their use.

I find it hard to give a score to a show while I'm in the middle of it, particularly one like this where I don't know how it's going to go in the long run. At a guess I think I'll rate it around an 8/10 at the end, maybe a point higher or lower depending on the ending. ^(That's not a bad thing and could easily place it at the edge of my top 10.)
>> ARTICLE
First timer.  I'm surprised and delighted by the adult nature of the show, as well as the (mostly) organic way the developments feel, and the lack of fear of getting into its situations and topics.  It also seems notable that everyone's outfits vary as much as you might expect in real life  that just have been an unusual amount of work for the designers and animators.
>> ARTICLE
One of the very very few anime that treats its viewers like an adult.
I followed the rewatch plan until episode 2 and then binge the whole thing.

Giving it a 10/10, it's up there with *Garden of Words, Shin Sekai Yori* and *5cm/s*.

It actually has a story to tell instead of thin pretext tacked on as an excuse for moe / battle / ecchi / harem anime or other common anime trope. The story also really resonates with me. The theme of of loneliness, chasing your dreams, financial problem, independence, etc are timeless and can be enjoyed long after you're completely fed up with shoujo / shounen themes.
>> ARTICLE
I was weak, went to the wiki and looked up spoilers, and now I am so incredibly mad. It's a great show. Probably 9 or 10 out of 10.
>> ARTICLE
First time watcher here. I went into it with an open mind, so not really any expectations to meet.

* The series feels very well thought-out, and it's clear they put a lot of work into it (hell, 9 people are credited under continuity in the credits)
* Pacing could be better in some spots.
* The 3D CGI held up really well for the age of the show, many parts are difficult to notice they're not hand drawn, like the new ED.
* It's a real shame this got caught in the post-cell animation, pre-HD era.
>> ARTICLE
Nana K working herself ragged to avoid loneliness?  Oh, if only Sakagami could see her now.

Good thing Ren understands Nana O so well.  That rapid barrage of could shoulders would drive anyone else off.

"I turned an angel into a little devil."  Oh, honey.

Mmm, classic muttered cryptic plot point by Shin.  "The more I see you, the less and less you remind me of her."

Yasu's smokin' it up faster than ever.  Time from lighting one cigarette to the next, in the cool-bar scene:  1 minute 29 seconds.  I'm no smoker, but that seems awful quick.  Also, Naoki is a loud mofo.  You might wanna start wearing hearing protection, man.

So Takumi has a temper, huh?  Gets violent when he gets mad?  Dead mom, drunkard dad?  Mmmmm.  I don't like where this is going.

Nana O's advice for Nana K to be constantly texting Takumi.  Ehhhh, not the greatest idea.

Nana K musing about how maybe she'd prefer if Takumi never called again.  You know, Nana, a lot of this stuff you think to yourself, you should be saying out loud.

And then, in her mind, she walks through the steps that would stem from that:  blame Takumi for being a jerk; move on Nobu; be happy.  Well that might work, but it depends on Takumi.  And as you point out, you'd look less than stellar.  If you dumped him instead, then at least you'd have your dignity.

"I wish I'd known he was gonna show up like this.  Why couldn't he text me or something?  He does whatever he wants.  He's so selfish."  Well, if your relationship were aboveboard, you would have seen this as spontaneous and romantic, not intrusive and selfish.  Takes two to tango.

"I've been waiting~ for *over an hour.*"  I don't like that tone, especially given the earlier info about Takumi's nature and background.  And then she apologizes!  Ughhh.  Nobu can't bring himself to say a word, just turning on his heel and walking off.  Can't blame him.

Nana K pumps herself up to dump Takumi!  Yay!  Takumi wordlessly heads straight for her bedroom.  Hrm.  She chickens out, just like Nobu did to her that time.  Ugh.  Takumi grabs her wrist and spills the beer on her floor.  It's a small symbol, but it gets under my skin for some reason.

Ah, hear those mechanical sounds, kids?  We called one of those a VEEE CEEE ARRR.  (Heh, studying porn.  Shin, you weirdo.)

Wow.  She knows Takumi sucks, but she thinks of herself as not deserving of (or therefore compatible with) anyone better.  This is how sick codependent relationships get underway.

Nana K pushes Nana O (and the rest of the band) away with an email begging off for being "in the way".  Nana O seems somewhat resigned at this news.  And then doesn't return to the apartment either.  And neither does Takumi, as expected.  Nana K doesn't mind that last bit.  "Was it 'cuz I trusted him?  Or was it 'cuz I was giving up on him?"  More like giving up on yourself.

And Misato returns!  And she's staying with Nana K.  Extended.  I can't tell if it's because Nana's lonely or because that would give her an excuse/shield for when Takumi shows back up.

**Episode 25**

Bringing up contraceptives again...bad feeling about this

Shin and Reina seem to be really getting a lot

Yasu acting all fatherly :p

Reira seems adorable sometimes

Notice Nobu more!

Ughhhhhhhhhhh yes you are the worst Nana

Poor Nobu...he deserves better...





>> ARTICLE
> Shin and Reina seem to be really getting a lot

That actually made me laugh out loud. Shin seems to be getting all the ladies though, especially when you are suddenly shown a scene with a woman who apparently trained him.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah what's up that whole training thing haha so random
>> ARTICLE
I suppose it's a little context as to who was the one that trained Shin to basically become a prostitute. Weird seeing a sixteen year old, a woman you could guess was in her mid-late twenties, eating breakfast after having slept together.

Wait,^you^do^know^that^isn't^Reina^right?

> Wait,youdoknowthatisn'tReinaright?

Ya ya I know!
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, you confused me for a moment there.
>> ARTICLE
Nana's gone for the full two weeks? And Hachi's left alone for the whole time. Ditch Takumi for Nobu, please.

Side note: we *still* don't know what Nana's job is.

This Ryoko woman is bad news for Shin. He seems happy enough with the current shallow interactions he has with women, I guess? Aside from that one incident with Reira...

Speaking of which, Reira knows Takumi's family better than I expected. I guess it makes sense if she dated Yasu and Takumi went to school with Yasu as well, they probably spent several years together even before the band made it big.

Yes Hachi, go for the guy that you actually see every day. Don't wait for Takumi to dump you, he'll probably keep stringing you along... and just as I thought that, he's suddenly there, just enough to keep her hooked. Aaaagh I want to punch Takumi, the jerk. I wanted to think he meant well but now I'm on the #FuckTakumi train.

Poor Nobu had to see all that too. I don't think Nana can stand watching it happen either, everyone's abandoning poor Hachi. Misato's staying for a while, there's the one bright spot in Hachi's life right now. But that's not even close to what she needs.
>> ARTICLE
> we still don't know what Nana's job is.

Yeah that's true! Guess it's still odd jobs here and there?

> I wanted to think he meant well but now I'm on the #FuckTakumi train.

Ditto.


>> ARTICLE
**Episode 25**

Hachi spending more time with Nobu is welcomed. Especially with Takumi out of the picture? Blessed.

NANA is too cold? Nah she just wants to hide her dere side.

Morreeeee Reira! Seems like her and Takumi have a brother/sister  relationship. Aww Reira is so childish <3

That OP is back! And Nobu can play the guitar(?) while smoothly looking at Hachi.

Takumi visited...what the fuck. *Anger ensues*

Perhaps he's serious about the relationship? Lmao yeah right 
Just say no...Hachi. 

Why spill beer??? Come on dude.

Oh my god Shin. You're really something. But damn I feel so bad for Nobu. You can't help who you fall in love...though you can hate them for it.

I think the reason why Shin can't answer the question Nobu asked because he's conflicted about his relationship with Reira. I think he likes her :D

Fuck this typesetting WTF! Old subs suck lol.

Misato HYPE! 

Seriously every transition to the ending song is amazing. 

--

>> ARTICLE
All this time she's misstepped or done something we all frown at her for, I can still sympathize and feel sorry for her. Making a mistake in a relationship decision, and missing out on someone that'd really care for her, accompanied with feeling abandoned by your friend/roommate, working a dead end job and having a phantom of a "boyfriend" would destroy someone's soul.

And then we have Ren holding up Nana's hair while she washes the dishes. Hehe. Also the constant birth control pill between them two... perhaps foreshadowing?

Shin and his 'teacher.' Interesting exhange between those two, and that last line from Shin brings up some questions.

My two favourite males in this show finally meet up. Yasu and Naoki are great. Nice beer mustache, Naoki. Would have loved Reina and Yasu to flesh out their relationship and get past him finally deciding to play music professionally.


Cool guys wear a full suit on the beach. Takumi with the dark past, Reina always being around Takumi, even saying "mother," although it was Takumi's mother. Reina being caught in the act of making a face at Takumi.

Nana fussing over Hachi, and badly supporting her, all the while Yasu is just trying to stay out of it. First time Hachi actually stopped watching Nana perform, just to look at Nobu.


Sad to see her thinking that him using her and leaving would be the best outcome, just so she can be with Nobu.

Hurts not wanting a particular person to see you, but feeling so lonely that they'll fill that void, and then going on to resign yourself to that type of person/relationship because you believe you are no better/cannot help it.

Hachi feeling so bad for Nobu, not being able to face him, or Nana who never comes back to the apartment, yet talks like a friend about her relationship. Must be hard.

And now relying on Misato, someone you hardly know, to basically move in with you for a month so you'll not have that sting on loneliness again.
>> ARTICLE
Much less to say about this episode.

* This might be Hachi's first time living by herself.
* Hmm? [She looks enough like her to me](http://imgur.com/a/jjZZb). I'm not ashamed to admit I thought it was Reira until he called her Ryouko.
* [:P](http://i.imgur.com/fGOjjgl.gif)
* Oh photo shoot episode coming?
* Wonder how many versions of Rose they recorded for this show.

More to come soon I'm guessing.

I didn't realize it at all till I read these comments.  I thought Ryouko was her surname and he was teasing or something.  :/

To be totally honest, even after him calling her Ryouko twice, I still wasn't sure until the scene with Reira & Takumi- She'd been in her hometown for several days, and doesn't have time for US trip like Ryouko.

Sounds sleazy enough for him. Not that disappearing to her room right away was much better.

At this point I feel like Nobu deserves his own Sachiko lol

As a first time watcher, Hachi is so frustrating.  But I know there are people like this in real life.

Nothing substantial to say about this episode. Had a few laughs though.

* Nana K does seem to reflect on the past a bit, even if she tends live in the moment and ignore what shes learned. Or maybe she just takes away the wrong lessons.
* Junko is a lot more passionate than she seemed at first impression.
* Nana K can be surprisingly stubborn about some things.
* I thought Shouji was on the mark about Nana Ks tendency to judge people just on their appearance.

She seems like such a good friend and was nice to see that side of her

**Episode 7**

Alright new stuff time! 

Well not yet...

Moving in with someone you barely know though...not very realistic there ;p

Haha Junko agrees, always the smart one

Thinking about Asano's wife? Didn't expect her to go that deep

Junko and Kyouske have matching PJs haha cute :p

The Sachiko bit was funny actually

Yasu is such a cool lawyer :)

The Nanas chemistry is pretty great, hoping for some fun moments there :)

For school it happens a lot!

Pinch me, you're actually watching *Nana*? How are you liking it so far? I guess you guys are only on episode 7, so there's not really much to talk about yet... But still, the tone of the show is pretty established at this point and it's definitely unlike any other romance anime already, IMO. 

>Junko and Kyouske have matching PJs haha cute :p

That really threw me off when I saw them this episode the first time. It's almost as if they're trying to emphasize how different Junko and Kyousuke's relationship is than Hachi and Shoji's. 

>Yasu is such a cool lawyer

Yasu the eternal badass!

>The Nanas chemistry is pretty great, hoping for some fun moments there :)

Their relationship definitely made the show for me, you'd almost think this was a yuri from the first several episodes, ha.

It's been good so far, I got used to the art style, the opening and all the characters seem pretty interesting so far. It will definitely be different then any romance anime that I've seen.

Thanks! Although I'm not *really* back, I just gave myself a day off from studying today, I've still got ~5 weeks of hard core studying before I take my board exams. Sigh.

I'm going to have a hard time remembering everyone's names haha I already do a bit tbh.

And yeah I'm scared of this anime so I'm going in with that mentality :p
>> ARTICLE
Even though there's a lot of characters, their personalities are all really distinct and I think that makes it easy to remember them. It also helps that most of the characters are pretty thoroughly fleshed out. 

It's probably not a bad idea to have that mentality, but it might take away from your enjoyment. I say you should just go in without thinking too much about it and let what happens happen.
>> ARTICLE
I never think to much when I watch anime (wait is that a good thing? lol) so that won't be a problem, it's more of a bracing myself for something bad to happen.

I'll remember the characters and their stories but the names might be the hard part.

Haha, I guess that depends on what you're watching. I'm pretty sure you're not the type that goes for shows that turn your brain to mush, so I don't see the harm in turning your brain off as you watch.

What is this?! A *Nana* rewatch?! That's awesome! And /u/AmethystItalian is in here? Well I'll be damned! Wow, I wish I had more free time to participate in this.

**Episode 7:**

Alright man will this be the episode where we pass where we were? 
The title says  "Yasu Appears!" so I hope so.

Don't say that Junko :( You would care...Go find a job then Nana...instead of loitering at Junko's work.
Nana is the very paranoid type...goes well with her other very great qualities like her clingyness...

"He wants to marry Nana"... SEE GUYS SHOJI IS A GOOD GUY. He truly loves Nana. 

LOL Who's this Sachiko chick? 

Well...that's not Nana LOL. Yay Yasu is an on-call lawyer.

It's good that naive Nana has her own place. If things went wrong with Shoji she'll still have a place to stay. 

So now both of our Nanas are together...many adventures ahead. Excited!

I find it amusing that Junko is considered the voice of reason. She strikes me as a bit immature in her own way. Kyosuke seems much more adult like.


>> ARTICLE
That's a good point. Remember that Junko was a something of a delinquent in her school days, so she probably sees Hachi as a reminder of her former, carefree self. 
>> ARTICLE
Part two of the first episode, where our Nanas are reunited. I really don't remember that heartwarming music when she notices the other one already there, did I just miss it the first time?

When Nana K mentions the possibility of being dumped, Nana O immediately becomes concerned and now we know why. She let Ren go and might still regret it, maybe? Same goes for when Yokoi mentions living with other people only brings trouble.

Junko brings the understandable concern about moving in with a stranger, though really this does happen in large American cities all the time (or at least that's the case here in Boston; our housing market is insane).

I like that Nana connects any possible unfaithfulness on Shoji's part to her own relationship with Asano. She can learn!

Kyosuke with insider knowledge on Shoji's plan to eventually marry her, heh. And *now* the discussion of Nana moving in comes up? Well, she apparently wasn't very clear about her plans to move to Tokyo in the first place so I can't be really surprised there. I love the theoretical Sachiko and how even Shoji brings her up. I hope she gets mentioned from time to time.

Hey, Yasu! Great first impressions all around and I'm amused how everyone immediately begins comparing the two.

> She can learn!

Was happy to see that!

>  I hope she gets mentioned from time to time.

Haha yeah I'd be up for some more Sachiko jokes!

>> ARTICLE
As different as the Nanas are from one another, their chemistry and report is really nice. It's nice to see everyone (except Shoji) more or less approve of the situation after meeting the other Nana. The show has also made me laugh quite a bit and I hope they don't let up with the humor. I'm thoroughly involved with the show at this point and am excited to see what will happen. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, that was a welcome, lighthearted change of pace.

Kind of funny how there's so much concern over moving in "with a total stranger".  Just check craigslist under "rooms/shared" for any US city to see how different the attitude is here.

Haha, Sachiko, "Tokyo wife (sexy type)".  Shoji's got a wife in every city.

And Nana K goes right to "am I being punished for Asano".  Wasn't expecting that level of self-awareness from her.

Jun keeps trying to bait Kyousuke into something, but he's too cool to get tripped up.  Heh.

Nana K wants to be "a classy woman the television viewers can idolize" (sub) or "a strong role model for girls to look up to" (dub).  Pretty self-aware of the show itself too!

"The rent's so cheap, there's gotta be a catch."  Yeah, it's on the seventh floor and there's no elevator!

Hahaha, Kousuke immediately takes an unabashed shine to Nana O.  (And what's with the cowboy hat?)

Speaking of accessorizing, I want to take a second to say something about Nana K's great use of kerchiefs throughout the show so far.  Cute.

What's with Nana O. giving Shoji noise about going away to "earn money like a real man"?  I didn't get why she did that

Nana O wriggling in Nana K's sweater.  Hnngg, gap moe.

WHO THE HELL IS SACHIKO ????

Still hilarious even on second and third rewatch.

Yasu !! The enlightened one. Best guy in so many ways but obviously quite boring due to lack of obvious vices. Unfortunate that we have to read the manga to see the much more exciting side of him [Manga Spoiler](/s "Among others: banging beautiful women though he is loyal to one girl at a time. He should just marry Shion or Miu though. At least keep Shion as mistress, she's ridiculously hot. Ren totally jelly..")

Hey everybody, I just wanted to apologize for not being as involved in these discussions this past week. Between work and my daughters staying with me this month, my time has been limited. Anyway, I can't believe we're already on episode 30! We've finally switched over to Nana as the narrator, just in time for things to start going south. How will Hachi handle the pregnancy?
>> ARTICLE
[I'm back!](https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1392957368/8639238.gif) 
 
I wasn't able to view episodes, write (substantial) comments or do much of anything really the past weeks. The reason being that I had an unscheduled encounter with Semi Truck-kun, whose loving embrace gripped me so tight as to break my collarbone. 

Because of that I had to catch up to a lot of things and I ended up missing pretty much three weeks of the [Nana rewatch with y'all.](http://www.picgifs.com/anime/anime/nana/anime-nana-031081.gif) But I am here now, so rather than mourn the missed opportunities of discussing past episodes, I'll just jump in here.

This episode is, well, a pretty damn important one, perhaps the most important one yet. Let me start with the most important thing of today's episode: the narrative switch.

Except for the flashback episodes at the start, all of the narration has been done by Hachi as of yet, meaning that we always hear her thoughts, see her perspective and feel her feelings. By now we know Hachi's personality all too well and we know that she is very open in most aspects, except for the 'self-loathing' that stems from her inability to couple her selfrespect to intrinsic values rather than external factors in her life.

Because of that, I was sucked in even more into the show when we finally get Nana O's perspective on things. Contrary to Hachi, her personality is guarded and we don't get to see what's bubbling underneath the surface that often, as she keeps her shield high up for reasons explained previously. 

But now that we get to hear her side of the intimate letter-like telepathic exchange, we finally get to see and hear Nana unprotected, unfiltered and unguarded. We can't say for sure just yet, but because of their personalities one would expect Nana's narration to add more to the show than Hachi's. Then again, Hachi's life in Tokyo up to now seemed the more turbulous one, especially where matters of the heart are concerned. We'll just have to wait and see.

One thing I will say is that no matter how well I think Midori Kawana did her voice-over parts and general portrayal of Hachi, it pales in comparison to the utterly amazing job Romi Park does with her intimate lines as Nana O. The way she whispers her lines with a hard to deceipher mixture that contains hints of fond nostalgia and even love, as well as deep sadness and regret... it really had an impact on me when I first watched the show, as early as today's ending remarks.

Speaking of endings, today we also switched to a new ending and not only is it my favorite of the show, it's also one of my all time favorites. I encourage you to listen to the full version of [Kuroi Namida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wxoPZijXU0), it is a really good song with buckets of emotion poured into it. 

Of course more happened this episode, but this episode is imo most interesting for the insight into the confusing mess that is Nana O. We see her pride displayed again when she left Yasu behind to go to Tokyo, her intense capacity of love in her admiration for and doting on Hachi, as well as her major struggle between that pride and her need to be loved in her relationship with Ren. Compared to our admiration for Yasu, our frustration with Hachi and our hatred for Takumi, our relation with Nana O as viewers is far more complicated than any other in the show and it makes her the most interesting one here imo. 

But I can't ignore the elephant in the room: Hachi is pregnant and this will have major repercussions as one would expect, especially in a show as unwilling to pull punches as this one. Along with a change in narration and ED, one feels a change in tone also lies lurking beyond here. Shit is going to go down. Fast.

Note: I'm pretty bummed out I couldn't discuss the past weeks with you guys, mainly the most controversial events like Shouji's cheating and Takumi's antics. It's easy to paint them as villains, but this show is better than that. I'll end it by saying that both may not be stand-up guys, but the spectrum is wider than good and bad: everyone has a mixture of good and bad qualities, with the scales shifting acoording to which traits are displayed most prominently in a situation. Of course, if anyone wants to know my opinions on them and others and what redeems or faults them, I'd be happy to oblige. 

For now, it feels good to be caught up again in time for the end game of the show. 
>> ARTICLE
> It's easy to paint them as villains, but this show is better than that.

I really like that about this show. To be honest Takumi is one of my favorite characters. I don't like him as a person but hes interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Takumi is really interesting as a character, probably the most interesting one after Nana O. He is what would be the villain in most shows, but he's very different in his portrayal. He's not the cartoonishly bad villain, or the obsessed maniac, or the coniving bastard/bitch. 

He is the 'villain' you encounter every day. He is the jerk on the road, the jerk at the bar, the jerk at work: the guy who seems to be doing whatever the fuck he wants regardless of other people's wants, needs or wishes. 

And even then, there is something more to it. I'll probably go into a bit more detail in the near future, I don't want to spoil anything :P
>> ARTICLE
Manga reader here dude. You can use spoiler tags if you want. [Spoliers](/s "I do like just how mature Takumi is. The guys really deals with whats thrown at him in a mature and logical way which is something I quite like about his character. It is also quite obvious that he does care about Hatchi but he just isn't really an emotional guy at all so he comes off EXTREAMELY cold which in itself is another one of his many character flaws")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "With me, it's like this: I can't like him because of the way he steamrolls over people. It's not just that he's cold, he's also a bit callous, especially towards anyone not of direct importance to him. See his treatment of Nobu from this episode forward.")

[](/s "But I do respect him in a lot of ways. He has more resolve than anyone present and his assessment of situations and what needs to be done is pretty much always on point. It's just the way in which he does those things ensures I can't like him.")
>> ARTICLE
Completely agree.
>> ARTICLE
So while we were hit by a truck figuratively, you went the literal route. Glad you're back.
>> ARTICLE
Ha! Yeah, I have to say that while this show is extremely good, getting hit by a truck for real has a little more, how do you say, *OOMPH* to it, you know. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I could see where that would have a little more impact.
>> ARTICLE
A couple of ya were on the mark. I didn't really see it coming until now though.

* Aaaand change of narrators. Will the series change its focus mostly to Nana O. now?
* Movin' on back. I wonder if we'll get a lot of flashbacks to Nana's perspective of the first half of the series. There were quite a few points I was wondering, "What the heck is she thinking about?"
* The intro to "Zero" reminds me of [Shiina Ringo's "Identity"](https://vimeo.com/95085318). I've previously mentioned "A Little Pain" reminds me a bit of ["Gibbs"](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6qy04_shiina-ringo-gibs-live_music) (There's [a better quality PV version on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zldBTSx9JpE) if it's not blocked in your country). /u/Are_You_Daft also pointed out that [Nana Osaki was modeled on Shiina Ringo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Sheena#In_popular_culture).
* Wait, she took a loan for the oven, but dipped into savings for the yukata?
* Haha, not your average festival episode.
* Hinting at something with that Hachi/egg on curry?
* Yup. How... inconvenient. \*cough\*
* New ED. I guess kuroi namida (black tears) would refer to her mascara running. Has there been a scene like that yet? It would be a sight.

Interesting timing on the perspective switch. Also Interesting how the OP/ED has so far changed from Black Stones/Trapnest -> Trapnest/Trapnest -> Trapnest/Black Stones.
>> ARTICLE
>Will the series change its focus mostly to Nana O. now?

It better not, Hachi is pregnant. I wanna see how that unfolds with a magnifying glass.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's better that we *aren't* going to be inside her head for this. We have an idea of how she thinks so we can extrapolate, now we get Nana O's personal view as her friend.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, I think it would be pretty riveting to hear her mentally accounting for each of her options
>> ARTICLE
Oh man I know some of you guys won't handle it
>> ARTICLE
You might be surprised at what some of us have dealt with in our own lives
>> ARTICLE
Man, imagine Hachi with pregnancy hormonal mood swings. I think it's a good time to shift focus.
>> ARTICLE
We get a switch to Nana's perspective rather than Hachi's for once... oy, that was something.

Yasu was there to see Nana off when she left *and* he tried to get her to stay instead of going to Tokyo (and Ren). This is after he pushed Ren to join Trapnest. In case it wasn't obvious already, Yasu has some buried feelings he doesn't want to admit out loud. Despite that he gives Nana Ren's number, which she apparently ignored. It seems like Nana's life pares down to three central figures: Ren, Hachi, and Yasu. She's in love with all of them, but in very different ways.

And on the other end we have Hachi with morning sickness. Nice visual effect when she's walking around, at least. I'm guessing it's too late to be Shji and too soon to be Nobu, so Takumi it is. I really hope this goes better than I'm expecting it to.

Oh, and new ED. I'll have to think about this one.
>> ARTICLE

Really really enjoyed that bit!

>  I really hope this goes better than I'm expecting it to.

Probably won't haha
>> ARTICLE
>I'm guessing it's too late to be Shji and too soon to be Nobu

I agree about the Shoji part, but remember that Nobu and Hachi got together at around the time Misato came over for summer vacation, and in Japan that would mean it was around the end of July. The poster for the fireworks display we saw in episode 28 said the fireworks would be on August 22nd, so that's almost an entire month after she started going out with Nobu, meaning it's entirely possible the baby is his.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 30**

Woah NANA doing the opening monologue too??

Flashback? I could use more NANA so this is fun

"There are law firms in Tokyo too" haha so it was NANA's line first

Six months...third guy lol

Shin and Nobu being adorable :p

NANA and Ren's relationship wow

Doesn't look so perfect now that we see it more

Oh I'm guessing pregnancy since this show would go down that route

If it is I really don't want to deal with the oh no who's baby is it drama even though it's probably Takumi's^^^^^yayDrama

Wow Shin's analogy is great but wow he got serious fast

Wow yup there it is...pregnant...

blehhh

>> ARTICLE
>YayDrama

I do love this show but so much of what made it go from good to great for me was in the manga.
A lot of the show is just drama which I feel they did so much better in the manga.

>> ARTICLE
**Episode 30**

NANA is part of the opening monologue :O

The final few seconds of the opening is so badass, I'm not even sure why. All those character portraits make them look so cool.

What NANA is saying about Yasu *probably* isn't what you think it means. Nana wants to be on the big stage. Real big dreams as opposed to other people ...

Damn 3 guys in 6 months lmao.

"is it innocence or is it deceit" hmm

NANA x Hachi OTP even Ren knows haha.

Whoa lewd!!! Ren is magical for NANA. I don't like how Ren said "you'll die young".

I'm sure we all know what that meant. Oh Hachi, even she knew.

Yeah NANA, im sure Hachi is smiling right now...

>> ARTICLE
What the?  Is Nana O our narrator/letter-writer now?  This is a little disorienting  Also, she sounds more and more like the boyfriend in their relationship.

This flashback scene at the start had me worried we were starting the whole show over again, but now going from the point of view of Nana O.  While that would be interesting, I'm glad it's not the case, since this way we get to see more of what happens later.

"I'll make more money than I can burn.  I'm not one of those princesses who's just happy to sing."  I had no idea Nana O was so commercial.  "March 5th, 2001.  My twentieth birthday."  So that means her birthdate is 3/5/1981, and today she's 34.

"Six months in Tokyo and she was already on her third boyfriend."  Whoa.  That's a lot less time than I'd thought we'd covered so far.

Shin doesn't know the difference between a yukata and a kimono.  That (worrying) feeling when you know more about Japanese culture than an actual anime character.

Nana K and Nobu are *so freakin' cute* together.  And now we find out Nana O really loves Nana K too.  "I think I'm gonna burst."  Dat gap moe.

"Why am I so completely influenced by what Ren says or does?"  Probably helps that he's right.  "Why does my heart burn so hot?"  Probably because you're in love, ya big dummy!  Why are you so resistant to accepting that?

Dude, that Mustang.  Ren is freakin' Steve McQueen over here.

"But what I'm talkin' about is **the woman Ren's sleeping with.**  I told you to send her home!"  Yeesh.  Sensitive as always, Takumi.  And don't they *know* one another?  But everyone ignores him, heh.

Oh geez.  Nana K is suddenly sick to her stomach in the middle of nothing.  She's pregnant, isn't she.  All that foreshadowing wasn't for nothing, was it.  Also, unless I'm mistaken, this is the first time we've seen Nana K in pants or shorts, isn't it?

Takumi wishes summer vacation were over.  I'm not sure I get it, though.  It's not like these people are in school

This "temporary contract" as Shin describes it doesn't sound familiar at all.  Is it a Japan-only thing?

"I wish I'd never been born."  Uh, wow.  You're hard to talk to, Shin.

Aaaaand there it is.  Pregnancy test with a plus sign.  Welp.  Guess this must be Takumi's.  (Or maybe even Shoji's???)  Now I guess we'll see about what an "inconvenience" this turns out to be

For the first time, we see Nana O working at a job.  And it's as a moving (wo)man?

That closing narration is curious as it ever was under Nana K's aegis.  All the "back then"s and "I wonder"s.  Plus now that bleak shot of Nana K hunching over on a toilet.  I have a bad feeling about this

New ending, with a new song.  Wasn't expecting that!

>> ARTICLE
Hey it might even be Nobu's...right???
>> ARTICLE
Not likely that soon.  Usually takes about six weeks for "morning sickness" to begin.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to copy/paste what I wrote in response to /u/Durinthal about the timing of the morning sickness since the show wasn't very clear that there was a bit of a time skip between episodes.

>...remember that Nobu and Hachi got together at around the time Misato came over for summer vacation, and in Japan that would mean it was around the end of July. The poster for the fireworks display we saw in episode 28 said the fireworks would be on August 22nd, so that's almost an entire month after she started going out with Nobu, meaning it's entirely possible the baby is his.
>> ARTICLE
I got the idea Misato had been there quite some time by the time Nobu and Nana K even made that trip to the convenience store, much less the subsequent sexytimes.
>> ARTICLE
I'd guess it's either from her last time with Takumi, or her first time with Nobu. Wasn't that like 2 days apart?

Of course, we're overlooking that it might be the Great Demon Lord's.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you're probably right, but hey have some hope :c
>> ARTICLE
> Or maybe even Shoji's???

Man, that would be an awesome twist. I think it's been too long though.
>> ARTICLE
> Takumi wishes summer vacation were over. I'm not sure I get it, though. It's not like these people are in school

I believe it's a reference to when Hachi texted him (before she broke up with him) that Misato was staying at the apartment until the end of summer break.
>> ARTICLE
Hm.  So he's missing her?  Or just missing being able to pop up out of nowhere?
>> ARTICLE
Nana is amazing.

Well said friend.

>> ARTICLE
I'm at episode 29. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, NANA is unique and one of the best romance series i've watched. It handles the subject pretty maturely, although the drama could be a little bit overblown for some people. The overall plot had a depressing tone, but just as you says, it helped the characters to grow and overcome the many hardships of life. 

The anime ended too sudden, and the manga still on hiatus. I really hope i got to see a conclusion someday.
>> ARTICLE
damn it, I thought the manga is finished :( the anime ending was the only thing that stopped me from giving the series 10/10..
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, same. I heard that the authors was ill at the time of writing it, so she put it on hiatus, recovered, but still undecided about the continuation.

Manga goes past beyond the anime though, if you want some continuation. Im putting it on hold for a while because i heard that shits happen in the manga. I'm going to catch up after its no longer on hiatus.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I'd prefer to marathon it when it finishes so I can get closure on this series. 
>> ARTICLE
You say that the plot had a depressing tone, but think about this. Our lives are often recollected in our minds through just the highlights. Moments that moved our hearts.

Otherwise, life is rather banal. Go to school. Go to work. Earn money. Spend money. Go to work. Earn money. Spend money. Our stories aren't remarkable. You could even say it's depressing. 
>> ARTICLE
Stop it, you're reminding me of my own depressing life....... :(

I said it was depressing if it was compared to other popular romance anime. But it was Josei, aimed for older audiences, so its not so surprising that it includes more mature themes.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry about that. But I live a similar sort of life. That's partly why anime is a great break from the grind. For 24 episodes I too can fall in love. I too can experience elation amd heartache. In real life? Elation amounts to getting my pay. And heartache? When I'm delayed in delivering my project at work. 

Though that might be gas.

For anime OSTs? Sure. But there's better music out there.

Nana was the first anime I ever watched that had me doing hysterical bellylaughs on a regular basis. Everytime NanaTheRocker said "hachi" and we saw Hachi with the dog ears I just lost it.

Despite not watching this anime I know what based from what your saying how it will role out.  
In honesty I hate thinking about my future. For a 16 year old i really shouldn't be.   
But man after I watched Clannad:AS It just made me feel scared. And this anime might as well.   
walking through life only to finally say "do you remember" really just scares me.   
Reason being I think is just watching someone else do it and say makes you think "will my life turn out happy".  
Next thing you know you just go thinking in the deep end wondering how far you drowned.   
Then its up to the point where point where you think "Why am I human?"   
Too be honest OP just don't look back at the stairs or look too far ahead just take the steps that's in front of you so you can reach the end knowing you finished the journey

Nasif, you're so young man. It's a good opportunity for you to start making memories. Do not let your time whittle away into nothing. I've spent my younger years quite angry and bitter at the world, as a result I've reached 28 with no friends and not a romance in 9 years. 

After Story was a great piece of work, it was able to bring to light some important questions a person should ask themselves. 

There is sadness in life, but there is also fleeting moments of brilliance. And I say make memories and hold onto friendships now because when time comes to say to yourself, 'do you remember?' you've have fond thoughts to keep you warm. 

I do not have this luxury anymore. I can only remember the moments where all things began to fall apart. Missed opportunities. Because they're such big gashes in my mental landscape.

I think anime; any narrative really - allows us to live another's joys and sorrows. This is important, it gives perspective. I have to reminding myself that narratives are highlights of a bigger story. There are countless moments within a person's life that do not see the spotlight. 

The sum of all parts though mate? Life isn't a happy trip. 

It's like I tried to capture in my post. The Japanese concept of Mono-No-Aware. There's a wistfulness about the human life. The passing of years.

Life itself is a tragedy. We inherit it at birth. I hate to say it, but most people I know. Most human beings in the world, I imagine are just barely hanging on. Trying not to sink. 

Be strong mate. You have time to figure things out. Make connections my friend. Try your best to hang onto friendships that you feel are deep and worthy. Then when you've in your 40s, you'll be sitting about a pub having drinks, laughing about love and life.

I suppose what I'm getting at is this. To make life worth living, you must have courage. See a girl you like? Tell her. She rejects you? Try again. Don't let opportunities at happiness idly pass you by. 

(sidenote: your name in Nasif? You probably had a south-asian/middle eastern upbringing. I know how hard that can be. I am entirely sure that my timid and cowardly nature can be attributed to my upbringing. I am resentful of my parents. I know you're young, and it's unlikely you can do much about your home life just now, but chin up. Your time will come.)
>> ARTICLE
thanks man, comments like those are something i really need to keep in mind, but it often gets clouded with stress and problems.   

I try living as the idiot who laughs at stupid things and is immature to the max, even if I'm being forceful of it, it beats being depressed about life.   

The way I was raised will make it pretty hard for me to even ask out a girl (though to be honest the closest thing I ever came to a relationship backfired on me)

And dude your side note is is close to spot on, Im a Bangladeshi living in Britain and raised on Islam. Though my home life is going fine at the moment as its almost nothing i cant deal with. 
But right now its just a repetitive cycle which I should be getting when I'm a Dad.  
People tell me to do something new but that but its easier said then done.   
But I guess I will wait till i do something out of no where without realising it, I guess that's the only thing that keeps my chin up at life

I respect you for understanding me and I thank you for your advice dude, I truly mean it.   




>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I get that. You're in your 11th or 12th year (I was in England during primary school; I live in Canada now) I fully understand the pressure you're receiving from your family now. They often feel like your enemies, right? 

They ask you, 'What will you study? Why aren't you serious about life?' Etc. You're fucking 16 years old. You barely been alive for a decade. What they fuck do they think you know about what life is? It's disgusting. You'll often find parent repeat the phrase, 'I know what's best - I've been there'. That's bullshit. Utter bullshit. Context is everything. They're not always right. You, as a son - should respect your parents, sure. But you have a mind of your own. What's more important is that you are a MAN. You will HAVE to make your own decisions in life to get anywhere. It's hard, I know. It's hard to respect someone when you know they're full of shit. But you only have to put up with it till you're old enough to be on your own.

It's important to have a sense of humour. If all else fails, remember this - all this we have. Life. Love. Pain. Everything fades. Just try to make someone's day a bit better. You'll have a richer life. Certainly take care of yourself. But you'll see how quickly life becomes fulfilling once you start looking out for others. Find humour in the smallest things. Force yourself (as you do), if need be. It'll make someone's day a little easier. You don't do good things for recognition. You do good things becauce you're a human being. 

I've had a few girlfriends. I miss them greatly, but they're because of my selfish and poorly thought out actions. I've learned that women do no want a man to be their 'girlfriend'. You should not be their emotional tampon. You are the man. You are the rock when her world is crumbling. You maintain your stability and she will learn to hold on to you. Now, obviously - it isn't that cut and dry. But it's a start. Be the rock. And seriously, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK HER TO BE YOURS. If it fails, it fails. Relationships start with physical attraction. And let's be honest - there are gorgeous girls everywhere. Being shy and holding back will only make you miserable. Getting rejected is a learning experience. Remember that people have preferences. You should certainly make an effort to look good and be charming. But no matter what - people have preferences. So don't hold back because you think they might reject your proposal. Just do it and worry about what happens after. Love can grow. Remember always that LOVE CAN GROW. But you need to let it grow. We're human being and we're all shallow creatures. If it pleases your eyes, you try your damn hardest to let it please your soul.

I'm a Bangladeshi too. I grew up in an Islamic home. My parents are strong Muslims, but they're liberal enough that when I told them I was atheist - they were upset - but they know that there was nothing they could do to change my mind. In fact - if you think about it - you can't FORCE a belief onto someone. So even if I told them I was Muslim, I'd be lying and there's no point in believing a lie. 

Trust me, I did my research. I studied Islam inside and out for years to see if it made sense in my head. But it doesn't. So I'm done following it. But I do have one advantage over you. I'm nearly 30. Funny how things work though. I'm Bengali. You're Bengali. I went to primary school in London (Cheswick). You're in England now. 

Nasif, I want you to remember something. You're 16, I know - you're young and you're allowed to make mistakes. But this 'repititive cycle' business is bollocks. I studied psych. in school and I know how you grow up and influences how you will be as a parent. But trust me, I've met plenty of people with FUCKED childhoods who are AMAZING parents. Parents that I would have liked to have. You can break the cycle. You can be the fulcrum that tips the balance of the scales. Again, it comes to this: courage. You need to have the courage to make decisions that YOU and YOUR PARTNER are okay with. FUCK THE WORLD. FUCK YOUR PARENTS. FUCK YOU GRANDPARETNS. FUCK YOUR FRIENDS. You do what's best for the child. You give it that child a memorable childhood. You give the child an education. You give the child love. You nurture the child into a fantastic, confident human being with love and respect for the world. Not your parents. Nore your granparents. Not your friends. You and your partner. Be brave. Be strong. Everyone has an opinion about how YOU should live your life. Guess what? It isn't their fucking life. Make sensible decisions. Take calculated risks. Talk to people who care about you, but take it with a grain of salt. 

Work Hard. Be brave.

I'll PM you my email address. Reach out to me if you want someone to talk to.

Nana is super good. Also Hachi is a whore. This needs no spoiler tag.
>> ARTICLE
Whore? No man, I sympathize with her. I get her thinking. A person can't help who they're attacted to. Romance is messy. 
>> ARTICLE
A lot of things to cover today, so I'll go ahead and dive right in. 

First we finally see Nana K get together with Shoji, as well as the final situation that leads to her fateful meeting. 

To be honest I'm not quite sure what to make of this, on multiple levels. The handling of their getting together was a bit jarring, with the whole scene being quite humorous until it finally happens. The scene then switches to something so sickly sweet that I almost needed an insuline shot. It's not necessarily a problem, but Nana's line to Shoji was so clichd the scene was in real danger of falling flat right then and there.

Although we do know the line makes sense coming from Nana. She's kind of a drama queen herself and she admits afterwards that she dreamt of a tv romance, which she now has, at least the closest thing available to her. It saved the scene and of course it is a sweet moment, but I'm not really sure if this was the best way of doing it. 

On a character level, her getting together with Shoji is by and large a good thing. For all her faults, Nana K is a good person and she deserves some genuine happiness from getting her feelings reciprocated. Perhaps more importantly, the blossoming relationship provides Nana with an anchor for her self-worth and a goal for her future, which we know kept her out of trouble for at least a year. 

On the other hand, the fact that this relationship is a good thing, is not a good thing (still following?). She needs this relationship, but that is no good sign, as even though the results are pure and positive, the underlying causes aren't. Most of the resulting change in Nana has been caused by external factors (the relationship) and although she has learnt some things along the way here, the whole lesson hasn't yet come through. Ultimately she's still the same person within and we'll see how that false growth will influence things later on.

As a small addendum, notice the short scene with Junko. We've seen how Junko is already grown up and whole as a person, but she still gains happiness and comfort from her relationship. The difficult balance between being your own whole person (particularly woman) and being a part of a relationship is ~~perhaps~~ *the* biggest theme of the show, as it is the great dilemma of both our protagonists.

Which very nicely brings me to our second protagonist and her past: it's finally time for **Nana O.** 

I said in my pilot episode write-up that it's hard to describe Nana O, be it that I have never met anyone like her. Well... I'm sorry. I lied. Again. But only kinda this time and for the sake of not spoiling anything.

Because to describe, no, to understand Nana O, we have to start at the source. To put it bluntly, she was betrayed at a very young age by the person everyone should be able to trust unequivocally. Such a thing tends to leave a scar and a nasty one at that, especially since contrary to Nana K (four words we'll encounter almost everywhere when describing Nana O), this Nana *is* very much a 'once bitten, twice shy' type of person. 

With that at the heart of Nana O, the rest of her personality is that much more easy to grasp. The first word that popped up in Nana K's mind was 'cool', which she is, maybe so much so that she can be misunderstood as cold. Make no mistake: Nana O is reserved and guarded, but she is also a warm and affectionate person, which are traits from the true Nana lying beneath the surface. 

And that's the intrigue with Nana O: she has a facade. Contrary to Nana K (*see, I told you*) who is 'what you see, is what you get', this is NOT the case for Nana O. She has an outer shell, designed by herself to protect and guard, because of her past trauma and hurt. But that does not mean that we do not get to see what lies underneath! The beauty of the show is that we get to live it from both Nana K and Nana O's perspective, which means that we will be shown both 'what you see' (from Nana K's perspective), as well as 'what really is' (from Nana O herself).

But there is also a problem. Of course there is, did you expect differently? The problem is that for many reasons, the 'real' Nana O rarely surfaces in full. Those many reasons are all related to the not so glamorous aspects in the labyrinth of traits that make up Nana O. Deep within, she's also needy, possessive, proud to the point of stubborn and maybe most of all, as well as most surprising of all: deeply and utterly afraid. 

All of this means that Nana O is constantly at war with herself, battling between the traits that want to crack out of the shell and those that want to keep them inside. As a final dilemma, as if there wasn't enough, she is in a relationship. More than that, contrary to Nana K (...) she has found true love early on. I'll elaborate more on that extra dimension to her battle tomorrow. 

Anything I've missed? Oh, I almost forgot, we've also been introduced to the other members of BLAST, further to be referred as Nobuo, Yasu and Ren, as well as groupie Misato, who is just plain adorable. I'll leave their personalities for a later time, when they have gotten more screentime. 

That was quite a lot to process: I am hoping to be able to shorten these write-ups into something more digestible, but there is a lot of groundwork to lay down first. Bear with me, as I hope to do as the Romans do, or in this case the show, and lay all the foundation at once before we enter the real story. Or don't, I mean, I can't make you do anything, right? RIGHT?!

I'm sorry, I'm rambling off again, I'll shut up now. Tomorrow we'll be concluding Nana O's backstory, after which we have the pilot repeat. We're almost set for the ride, so hang in there!

> On a character level, her getting together with Shoji is by and large a good thing. For all her faults, Nana K is a good person and she deserves some genuine happiness from getting her feelings reciprocated.

I also enjoy how she pretty much showed her true self to Shoji and he knows what he's getting into and wants to do it anyway.

Haha it was a good read for sure though! Learned a lot of things I missed! It did feel a bit like an Oregairu thread though haha

**Episode 4**

Hey look no fairy tale reuinon **realistic** lol

Ok this OP is really growing on me

I actually like how Nana answers the phone, hope that never changes

Awe we ended on a happy note and Nana seems to have learned stuff!

Alright NANA time!

She Kissed her! :O

Her band seems pretty cool :) (Going to have to remember more names now -.-)

And NANA is a pretty serious relationship, wonder how that's going to not work out :p

I'm enjoying the flashbacks and understand that they're necessary but I really want to see the Nana's together again!

What if I told you there's still more recurring characters to come? Haha

You don't have to be pessimistic about *everything* you know, lol

Oh my god it's so weird watching Nana again!

All these emotions it's coming back....

------

**Episode 4:**

Shoji comes back to find Nana...at least he's not the asshole to let things drag...

God fucking bless this opening. 
Black haired Nana is singing it, and it gets me so hyped every single time I hear it.

...He already wants to sleep with her. Don't force him to say I love you...AND DONT SLEEP WITH HIM CAUSE OF THAT.

Hmmm so maybe Shoji does know how to create the atmosphere? Good work I guess.
Nana finally has a healthy relationship.

So we're now into black haired Nana's narration. She's hype. Honestly one of the most refreshing characters in anime. I don't think I've seen anyone like her.

She's just so badass and cooooool.

I downloaded the entire Nana OST...listened to all of it. So worth. It's incredible.
Nana has a unique voice. She deserves all the fans she gets.

Misato!! Ahh I missed her.

YASU!!! My boyy. Such a cool group of friends.
Yasu is a lawyer in the making. 

Aww I always loved Nana x Ren. Ren is a good guy. 
Nana is backstory is pretty sad. 

So Ren is going to Tokyo too...what's with Tokyo? 

Oh man the fucking Ending song...
>> ARTICLE
> So Ren is going to Tokyo too...what's with Tokyo? 

Tokyo is a major draw  it comprises about 30% of the population of Japan!

For now...

He seems pretty cool but again lol for now...

I'm being warry of everything in this series :p

The only thing he's doing is leaving based Nana for Tokyo O.o

Seems like both Nana have things in Tokyo they might want to get back to. 

Prepare to scream at the top of your lungs like I do. I'll rant in my notes.

I didn't know we'd start Nana O's story in this episode so that was a nice surprise. I wanted to know more about her. Even with the forewarning, I am surprised by how mature the show is--how certain things are presented and covered. I expected that to some degree though. 


Loving Nana K's reaction to Shoji's forwardness. Her reactions in general are great.

Yeah like I heard about how *realistic* it was supposed to be and more of a mature relationship but I was still surprised on what they showed!

Should I be looking forward to a running "God-damnit, Nana" image segment from you every episode? That would be funny.
>> ARTICLE
At first I had hope for Shoji, but then he reveals that he really just wants to get in a girl's pants. And he's not even trying to be smooth about it! He doesn't actually tell Nana he loves her, she just heard it "in his heart" and that's good enough for both of them. I like his little faux American act, it's a reminder of the difference between cultures for things like romance.

Funny that Nana K is trying to defy the "Demon Lord"... and then soon into Nana O's segment she's called "Demon" one of the band members.

What a story Nana O has. Abandoned by her parents and shouted at by her grandmother, I'm not surprised she rebelled and make the choices she did. I like the use of color (or lack thereof) when she goes to buy the red dress, how everything aside from the dress is monochromatic until she's with Ren and then color returns to her life.

And we see the parallel with the other Nana: her lover's leaving for Tokyo and pretty much leaving her to fend for herself. How will she take it compared to Nana K?

I like that they're talking about sex and going further to bring up the risk of pregnancy. It's like the anti-Clannad as [Clannad After Story](/s "Tomoya and Nagisa barely even hold hands and then suddenly she's pregnant.")
>> ARTICLE
> Funny that Nana K is trying to defy the "Demon Lord"... and then soon into Nana O's segment she's called "Demon" one of the band members.

Haha, that is funny now that you mention it, but you're probably reading too much into it. Maou () and Oni () aren't really nearly that closely related in Japanese.

Naww. he does love her. He's just being Asian and cant say it out loud.

Yeah, that's why he was psyching himself up the minute before. "I'm an American! My name's Michael!!"

Japanese men are really timid, and he wanted to be aggressive there.

Is that what it is?  I was afraid it was some kind of taboo of masculinity or some bullshit like that.

It's a bit jarring since it might be the first anime for me to do so but it is pretty refreshing in that same way

Glad that you picked that up! There'll be a lot of little cinematographic nuances like that throughout. Keep a look out! :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm enjoying the cinematography. It's a shame this was made early in the digital coloring era. I'd have liked seeing this in HD.

The snow in the second part was kind of off-putting visually though. So flat looking, no depth.
>> ARTICLE
Super late again, and short on time too, so I'll just spout a handful of bullet points and be on my way:

* Kind of cute/funny seeing Nana K brush off someone's advances for a change.  You snooze, you lose, Mr. Video Store Clerk!
* At first I thought those suicide chains Nana O was wearing were in-ear monitors.  Kinda asking for trouble with that, girlie!
* Dat girl-girl groupie kiss doe
* Looks like Nana O inhabits a world of hard luck and tough times.  She's pretty together, considering.
* Side note:  Nana O is quite cutting edge by being on the pill.  Japan is amazingly backwards when it comes to birth control options.  The pill itself was only made *legal* in 1999!  Only a tiny percentage of women use it even today.
* So the boyfriend went to Tokyo in her case too.  Wonder if she's following him there just like Nana K.

Oh wow, that's interesting! Considering this is based around then, I guess that makes her more of a rebel. The more you know!

Finally have time to catch up to the rewatch cause I am done with my exams this episode was pretty good compared to others and really enjoyed it I really like red haired nanas personality

Finally the introduction of some of my favorite characters in all of anime! Yasu and Ren Hype.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 5:**

I feel for bad for Nana...

I will never skip this opening...EVER. It's so perfect.

So they introduce Trapnest <3.

Too bad this is going to hurt BLAST, let alone Nana & Ren's relationship.
Yasu isn't taking risks. He's so mature, definitely different from the rest.

They first meet NANA. She looks quite different. 
I think NANA can make it to Tokyo. Her voice is really good.

Nobu is a nice friend too. He's quite interesting since he's fairly rebellous.
His family owns a hotel and he could take it easy and get a job at his family business. But he'd rather do something as exciting as professional singing instead.

NANA is very determined as well. She doesn't want to go to Tokyo because Ren is there. She wants to go there when she's good enough and she deserves to be there. 
She doesn't want to follow Ren around but rather be her own. I think we can all respect that.

This sucks man. The band is split. Feel so bad for both of them.
Group of friends always spliting up is always so sad. Jossei anime/manga seem to always get friendship drama so good.

It's been almost 2 years since they been together. But now we're pretty much back in present time guysss!

Nana K and Nobu? I can see that though they're both a bit immature and I don't see that ending well.

The praise Nana gets as a show for being "Realistic" is drawn from the characters and the way they handle the situations they are in. This episode is a great example of that. Neither Ren or Nana O wanted to leave each other but they both felt that it was the right choice for themselves in that period in there life. This is why people call the show "Realistic" you can understand and often relate to the characters situations which makes this show so great in my opinion.

> I will never skip this opening...EVER. It's so perfect.

I completely forgot about this, but it just dawned on me that the NANA opening isn't even in the Best OP contest.

Sorry for the super early thread everyone, but I've got a flight to catch! I'll be away on a business trip this next week, but I'll do my best to post these threads as always, sorry for the inconvenience! 

Also, just so everybody knows, tomorrow's episode is a recap of episode 1 with added content. We get to hear the Nanas talk on the train one more time and the significance of what is said will be much more apparent now that we have seen their back stories! It's about time the NANA train moved at full speed! 
>> ARTICLE
I like the reaction Nana O had to Ren departing for Tokyo. She could follow him, but is that really what she wanted and what was best for her? She thinks about it, unlike Nana K who immediately stated she was going to Tokyo too, and instead decides that she's staying behind. She knows the implications, that life with Ren would be over after that, and she sees it through because it's better for her in the long run than to live in his shadow. *Eventually* she decides to go to Tokyo, though it's not for Ren but for herself.

A few comparisons to make between the two Nanas and how their stories are presented:

* Nana O's again makes great use of a monochromatic palette in parts of her story and has a variety of tones, while all of Nana K's past is warm colors, even in winter. Maybe I'm pushing it a bit with the last part since I'm not going back to look at them but just going off of memory.
* Nana O's past is nonlinear. It starts with Ren telling her that he's moving to Tokyo and after that goes back to when they met, jumping back and forth between the two time periods. Nana K's side is linear, from prior to meeting Shoji to her moving to join him.
* Both of them have groups of friends, but Nana O accepts that they can break up as people move on in life while Nana K struggles to keep everyone together. As a result, they head to Tokyo for different reasons as well.

All this before the true story starts? I'm looking forward to how they interact now.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah their interactions now are going to be so much more interesting now that we know more about their character and their pasts!

Quite the difference from Nana K, isn't it?

It really is, except for one **very** important detail. Yesterday I put in a little side note saying that *the* main theme of the show is the difficult balance between being your own independent person and being part of a relationship. 

With all of their numerous opposite traits, we see that Nana^2 are pretty much polar opposites of each other: outgoing vs. reserved, naive vs. weathered and many, many more dichotomies that I'm not going to spell out since I've spent enough time on their personalities already.

But curiously enough, we see that the major conflict both Nana's struggle with is actually the same: they are opposite sides of the same coin. 

Nana K is struggling to find her own self, seeing as she always views and identifies herself as a part of a relationship. She has yet to learn to be independent, so her problem is with the first side of the central theme.

Nana O is struggling to put a part of herself into a relationship. As we see today, she needs Ren, she loves him, but she can't reconcile putting aside herself for the other half of the relationship with her strong need to be herself and realize her dreams, as well as her stubborn, proud personality. She has yet to learn to be dependent, so her problem is with the second side of the central theme.

So what follows is of course a view of both sides of the issue, with the Nana's searching for the middle ground that will leave them happy and fulfilled. We will see both Nana's learn the beauty of the side of the problem they're struggling with through observing the trials and tribulations of their counterpart, forging a bond between them that falls somewhere halfway between friendship and love, but fully in the realm of soulmates. Only, life never pans out quite the way we want it to...

Aside from that, we got a little more screentime for Yasu and Nobu, which is hardly a bad thing, especially for the people in the re-watch in search of likable characters. 

Yasu is an adult. There's no way around that. Levelheaded, in control, responsible, mature. Those are the words to describe Yasu, though if I had to choose one, it would be reliable. Yasu is a rock (more than Junko even!), plain and simple and throughout the show he will be the anchor to our ship. 

Nobuo is a sweetheart. He's kind, sociable, a little goofy and easy to make fun of. But under all that, there's a really stand-up guy. There's not much more to say.

Of course, that doesn't mean both don't have their faults. Yasu is the closest thing the show has to a 'flawless' character and the only one practically incapable of grinding one's gears. Nobuo less so, but we will get there in time.

That only leaves one character left. Ren is hard to describe up to this point, because we have practically seen him only in relation to Nana. He's a womanizer, but more of a romantic, he's kind and caring and more an ideal up to this point than anything else. That will change and he will also show his flaws, one very glaring flaw in particular.  

That's it. Tomorrow will be the semi pilot repeat, which is a repeat interspersed with extra scenes. **However**, I strongly implore you to watch it anyway: particularly focus on the difference in feeling between watching it the first time and watching it now, as it really drives home why I feel the exposition of the past adds so much to the story. The reunion of Nana and Nana is upon us, so we'll be starting the story soon.

While I really enjoy your writing about all of this, a lot of it sounds informed by later events and is aimed more at rewatchers than us first-time viewers. While it's not spoiling any specific events, it's revealing the tone, themes, and maybe to some degree larger-scale character developments (or lack thereof). Maybe I'm reading too much into things.
>> ARTICLE
If I'm revealing too much, please do say so and I'll try to tone it down a little.

I'm not specifying anything crucial, just trying to paint some broad lines that most people probably already expect to happen. 

But again, if I'm looking ahead too much ahead for anyone's liking, feel free to say so and I will adjust accordingly (do specify which parts exactly feel too farsighted). 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's because we haven't gotten to the main story and setting for (presumably) the rest of the series yet, but most of the second half of your post reveals a lot of unknowns given the five episodes we've seen thus far.

> We will see both Nana's learn the beauty of the side of the problem they're struggling with through observing the trials and tribulations of their counterpart, forging a bond between them that falls somewhere halfway between friendship and love, but fully in the realm of soulmates. Only, life never pans out quite the way we want it to...

It probably looks obvious in retrospect, but this kind of development and relationship isn't guaranteed. I can *guess* that's how they'll end up just going by the standard tropes, but you're ruining a bit of the surprise by stating this is how it goes. Though... I initially read that last sentence as referring to all the events happening *around* this relationship rather than about the connection between the two Nanas, so now I'm just confused.

For Yasu and Nobuo, I wasn't even sure they would reappear later on, but it sounds like they're going to be part of the main cast. Again, I can guess but I'd like to be pleasantly surprised to see them again rather than impatiently waiting for their return. Your descriptions for them also read like a blunt "here's their characterization" as if that's how they'll be through most of the series.

> Yasu is the closest thing the show has to a 'flawless' character and the only one practically incapable of grinding one's gears. Nobuo less so, but we will get there in time.

Maybe Yasu had something to hide beneath that cool bald demeanor? Apparently not.

And about Ren:

> That will change and he will also show his flaws, one very glaring flaw in particular. 

Sounds like he'll be a major character later on, rather than a distant ideal that Nana O aspires to rival or an incidental player in her life.

You're reading a little bit too much into that paragraph. It's a given that they will build a deep relationship, we can get as much out of the little dialogue at the start of every episode, which is basically a telepathic conversation between the two. Also, the show is called Nana. It's akin to me saying that Ryuuji and Taiga develop a relationship of sorts (friendship or more) in Toradora: it's in the title and plot description. I really said less than you're reading from it. The last line in particular is me saying that there are highs and lows along the ride, a fact as obvious as the sun coming up every day.

> For Yasu and Nobuo, I wasn't even sure they would reappear later on, but it sounds like they're going to be part of the main cast. Again, I can guess but I'd like to be pleasantly surprised to see them again rather than impatiently waiting for their return. 

This is my fault, kinda. Personally, I never go into a show blind and read at least a couple of reviews, which already show that the BLAST members don't disappear. It's not a really big surprise, but it's not something I should have divulged. Rest assured though, it's not really presented as a surprise either. 

> Your descriptions for them also read like a blunt "here's their characterization" as if that's how they'll be through most of the series.

This one is really my fault. I should have waited a bit longer until they'd gotten more screen time. There will be plenty of surprises left though, I haven't told everything. 

> Maybe Yasu had something to hide beneath that cool bald demeanor? Apparently not.

Now this is something I'm not going to elaborate out of fear of spoiling :D Suffice to say that I there's a lot of surprises left, whether they include Yasu or not. 

> Sounds like he'll be a major character later on, rather than a distant ideal that Nana O aspires to rival or an incidental player in her life.

Again the part about the BLAST members applies. Note that in this show almost everyone gets a little characterization. I won't elaborate any further. 

---

But your point is taken. I'll mostly be a bit more careful with characterization in relation to screen time and such. I haven't said as much as you think I've said, but I will be a little more careful. 

I would ask you to try to understand why I wrote those things: I'm really trying to get the majority of the grunt work out of the way early like the show, so I can spend time on the finer inner workings and relations between the characters without having to spend paragraphs on basic things like what the characters are presented as. 

I'm trying to make these write-ups palatable as quickly as I can so I don't end up with several posts worth of notes when shit really goes down, like the people in the OreGairu threads.

Add to that that this is my first time doing these for a show with an overarching plot (previously did Cowboy Bebop) and I'd ask you to be a little patient with me :)

I will become a lot more careful once the major plot points start showing up, but your point has been noted.
>> ARTICLE
I want to apologize first, as looking back at what I wrote I was apparently quite grumpy yesterday. You're right about the Nanas connecting being a given and I had forgotten that the first episode opens with a letter from one to the other set sometime in the future.

I am going in quite blind; I saw that the rewatch was starting, remembered it was on my plan to watch list, and went into the first episode with no more information than the tags of music and romance I had written about the show some time ago. So literally anything that's not in the episodes at this point is going to be new information to me, but I should be more conscious of things that are more general information and *should* be known like who the main cast will be later on.

Anyway, carry on.
>> ARTICLE
You don't really need to apologize, I can take criticism :P

More importantly, I know I'm new to these things, so there is certainly room for improvement for my write-ups. It's not as if your post was unfounded, there were some legitimate points in there which I should use to my advantage.  

I've adjusted a little for today's write-up (less foreshadowing) which I finished an hour ago, so let me know if there are still problems.

**Episode 5**

Just be happy for your friend Nobu!

Yasu is pretty cool and level headed

NANA blushed, more coincidences haha I like it

He adds colour in her life, really like that

She's so much different from the other Nana

Would be funny if Ren and Shoji met up in Tokyo

That's a tough goodbye...glad to see it hit both of them at least

When they meet again in Tokyo it's going to be pretty great!
>> ARTICLE
> Yasu is pretty cool and level headed

Agreed, I like him. I hope we see him return in the future... as a lawyer?

I wouldn't be surprised if Shoji and Nana drag NANA along to a show and only later realize Ren's playing there.

Whoa it's still Thursday here! But I haven't watched it yet, haha. \*jumps to the TV\*

* The interactions between the band members were pretty interesting. I especially liked the scenes of Nobu & Yasu at the beach, and Nobu & Nana in the bookstore.
* Nobu amusingly sold the buttons of his high school uniform; for those who don't know, it's a tradition to give the second button (the one closest to the heart) to someone you like. Evidently he got a lot for them, being a member of a popular band.
* I guess she's a bit of a bookworm, so surprisingly well read for a high school dropout (Well, she was expelled actually). High School is not compulsory in Japan but 94% of JHS students enter high school, and Japan has a [93% graduation rate](http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=1653), which is second only to Denmark (The US rate (which has compulsory enrollment) is around 70 to 80% for comparison).
>> ARTICLE
Quick doubt - in Golden Time, there's a similar punk rock-girl who is also referred to as Nana. Just a coincidence or is it some sort of homage/reference?
>> ARTICLE
Definitely an hommage. 
>> ARTICLE
Yasu the rock-n-roll lawyer.  I wonder if the incidence of real-life law student/musicians is significantly higher in Japan than elsewhere.  Because where I'm from they tend to be opposite types entirely.

Nana O's instincts to go it alone are straining against her yearning for the simple happiness of a family life she never had.  Poor Nana.

I have to say, I chafed a little seeing Ren crying at their parting.  It would be one thing if he'd asked her to come with him and she'd refused.  But this way, I kinda feel like he doesn't have a right to cry, even if he's hiding it from everyone.  He made the decision to leave, and in no way expressed a desire to keep her with him.  It was just "welp, I'm takin' off, smell ya later".  Hmph.

I wonder how her fans are going to take the news that Nana's gone off to Tokyo.
>> ARTICLE
This episode just felt really awesome from the first ep I didnt think I would like black haired nana but  this episode proved me wrong
>> ARTICLE
[God-damnit Nana.](http://imgur.com/OMavjiu)
>> ARTICLE
But, seriously, this isn't running away "to be her own person", this is just fear. She's been burned by the one she trusted in her past, and basically nothing that Ren could do, or say, or be, would be enough to convince her to take a leap of faith at this point. And he knows this well enough to not push the issue, as it would just mean that they parted with recriminations against one another rather than the relatively clean break here. Nana herself acknowledges that she could - that she *would* - be happy even if she couldn't find her own fame after moving to Tokyo, but she's scared that the floor will give out under her feet and she'll be left with nothing.

This is quite different to the other Nana's problem; *she's* all too-willing to jump without looking first, taking it on faith that things will work out for the best. The two definitely have a lot to learn from each other, and hopefully they'll meet somewhere in the middle.

In honor of passing 888 comment karma, I'll only comment on Hachi this post.

* Her image of anything the band does will become cool I guess.
* Hahaha, yes even rock stars poop. Was wondering at first if her reaction was her thinking about peeking. **Edit:** [Hachi in the restroom later.](http://www.evacommentary.org/images_random/goldenboy_2_toilet-hug.gif)
* Hachi's reaction at Yasu x Reira was very different than the others'.
* I wonder if Hachi would be encouraged, or discouraged about going after Yasu if she met Reira and found out about her actual personality.
* Hachi totally should sharpie that on her forehead.
* Oh yeah. Work. And that's it for that job, maybe she can move on to something that suits her more.
* Hmmm. Well. She has been warned. Starting to look like another dream come true, but how long for her to become disillusioned?
* I may have misheard, did she just call herself a creampuff without cream?

Very Hachi-focused episode.
>> ARTICLE
> maybe she can move on to something that suits her more.

Really want her to have something going for :/


>> ARTICLE
Yes Hachi, Trapnest are people too. I don't see her surviving long if she keeps freaking out over Ren and Takumi like that.

Huh, didn't know Reira and Yasu were a thing. *And* he went to school with Takumi. Yasu's the core of the series! After Hachi got fired from her job I wonder if Yasu could help with that too.

Nobu and Hachi going to the store together? Time for some development between them! And just like that Nobu's yet another option for Hachi. Probably the best one of the lot too. Even she acknowledges Shin's out of the question, I'm a little confused why she's still latched onto the idea of Yasu though. Takumi is probably only going to be trouble.

Damn, Takumi's a player and picked her up. Run away, Hachi! Don't listen to him!

This show moves so quickly between a sort of sad/tense mood to a light hearted good feeling one. I think it's in part due to our narrator who is near bipolar with her mood switching.

Good episode again, and let the Nobu x Hachi ship sail!  But nope, it seems like Takumi x Hachi might happen instead, which is a bad idea. Don't do it, Hachi! Also, Reira x Yasu actually seem like a couple that would do well together. Opposites attract sorta thing, but they both also seem sort of relaxed/not freaking out about life types. I haven't seen enough of the former to really make that conclusion, though. I can't really see Hachi and Yasu, on the other hand. 

>> ARTICLE
Mmmm, Nana K, your garden looks lush and ripe and juicy.  (What?)

Geez.  These guys need to get a copy of Pictionary.

"Takumi goes to the *bathrooom~*??"  Haha, excellent read by Kelly Sheridan.

Oh.  My.  God.  Nana K fangirling out over Takumi partaking of her plump tomatoes.  Cuuuuute!

What a weird move for Takumi to just slump down against the kichen cabinet on the floor

Nana O, secretly feeling a heavy rivalry against Reira?  That's not like you.  Tsk, tsk.

Man, these two bands just have a more and more tangled history together.  It's almost incestuous at this point!

Holy preemptive jealousy, Nana K.  You've gotten yourself so wound up about Yasu that his ancient history with another woman has you bummed out?  And now she's even doubting that any of them really like her at all.  You poor messed-up kid, you.

"He's just as crazy as me!"  Ah, yet another prospect for Nana K's love-cannon!  "I must be boy-crazy!"  Finally, she realizes!

Hahahah!  Suddenly it's ok to be called "Hachiko" when it's Ren doing it with a headpat.

When I called Shin a gigolo before I was only kidding.  But, uh hmmm.

That feel when you wake up on a work day at 1:10pm.  Uuuggghhhhh.

Nana K musing about her career.  I have an idea.  I bet Blast would love to have you as their manager or something.  Of course they themselves would have to start making money for that to happen.

Ah, an amazing coincidence lets super-womanizer Takumi pick Nana K up on the street right as she's the most down on herself and her worth.  I think I can see where this is going.

>> ARTICLE
**Episode 16:**

Hachi ran out her room-mate and Misato...

Looks like NANA had some things to say :/ 
I don't think it really means anything more than that she needed a friend to talk to at the time. Yasu kinda shooed her out when she needed some comfort.

Nice to see Hachi make it up to to Misato...she didn't deserve that. She's been on \#TeamBlast since day 1.

Hachi figured it out...and Shin is pretty mature.

Hachi getting a little nosy...but when she wants to know something she'll figure it out.

So the only mystery is whether or not Ren still loves NANA. Let's hope that he still does.

I'm a little nervous...and I have a feeling that Hachi is going to get fired. She does nothing for her job lol.

We finally see Ren again! He's like NANA, they both go to see Yasu whenever they need a friend to talk to.

Next episode looks like it's going to be great!

It feels so nice to re-watch series, you notice things that you haven't before. I've been re-watching this and ef;tales of memories with /r/anime and it brings back so many emotions. 
>> ARTICLE
>I don't think it really means anything more than that she needed a friend to talk to at the time. Yasu kinda shooed her out when she needed some comfort.

I agree that it doesn't indicate anything in the way of romantic feelings, but I think Yasu had a legitimate question in why Nana O would show up out of the blue pre-5AM.  That's not "I just randomly wanted to visit" timing.  She took the question a mite hard, I thought.  As a desire for her not to be there, when it was meant as concern.

>Hachi getting a little nosy...but when she wants to know something she'll figure it out.

Heh.  Too bad she doesn't turn that keen insight toward her own life

>I have a feeling that Hachi is going to get fired. She does nothing for her job lol.

I wonder if it's hard to get fired in Japan.  Seems like you hardly ever see it happen in anime.

>We finally see Ren again! He's like NANA, they both go to see Yasu whenever they need a friend to talk to.

I was a bit shocked at that.  Nana O must not do that often, or she'd likely run into Ren by chance.
>> ARTICLE
>...and Shin is pretty mature.

I really like that about his character. He has a really childish outlook on life but he is a lot more mature for his age then he comes across. It's a really good balance for his character in my opinion and makes him extremely likable.

It's also quite funny that Hachi tries to take on the mother roll but is far more immature then his is in some ways, just another quirk i love about this show.


>We finally see Ren again! He's like NANA, they both go to see Yasu whenever they need a friend to talk to.

I really liked that scene when I first saw it. It never really sat right with Ren completely breaking contact with his friends. Him keeping in touch with Yasu was an unexpected but extremely natural and great surprise my first time through this show.

Ahh man I'm struggling to keep to the re-watch schedule.

Yeah at this point, most people are expecting that he completely broke contact because he became a star guitarist. Completely natural since that's how it usually goes...but we'll see just how different Ren is, if at all...

And here's the episode where Hachi finds out about Ren. But first...

Nana's hiding what's really going on in her head, even from Yasu as we when she visits him the next morning. I think he'll probably be the first to know about anything so it's a mystery to everyone right now. She also seems to be going a little haywire given her smoking the cigarettes she didn't like at the end on the episode.

I like that Hachi wanted to make up with Misato and actually goes through with it, no more jealousy on her part. Funny that they're reading the same magazine too. So Misato reveals that Ren was in BLAST and Hachi begins making all the right connections... except she comes to the conclusion that Nana's still secretly dating him. Fortunately that gets cleared up quickly by Nobu and Shin before there can be any dumb misunderstandings about the whole thing (I'm looking at you, Kimi ni Todoke).

I don't foresee Hachi being able to keep mum about the whole thing before the concert, but even if she does I don't see the reunion going as well as she thinks it will, including her dating Takumi. I'd be amused if the lead singer of Trapnest (Reina?) was already dating him.

Ren, on the other hand... is still meeting with Yasu for some reason? Now why could that be?
>> ARTICLE
>She also seems to be going a little haywire given her smoking the cigarettes she didn't like at the end on the episode.

I wonder what the Blast cigarettes symbolize to her. Her past with the band? With Ren? Yasu? Probably a combination of everything.

>I'd be amused if the lead singer of Trapnest (Reina?) was already dating him.

Reira is her name. The way the members are positioned in their album poster made me think Reira and Ren were together the first time I watched.

I just finished this one and I am thinking that her and Yasu are in a relationship, or had a fling.  Especially with how she went to his room and looked longingly into his window.

That's the obvious assumption so I'm going to guess that's not actually the case.

Hachi properly apologized this time.

* Misato's ringtone sounds familiar... Does it ring a bell (har har) for anyone else?
* I saw that coming. The beans are spilled. I thought it'd either be Shin or Misato.
* Not sure if it was a good thing or a bad thing Hachi couldn't contact Nana as soon as she found out.
* Oh, Shin didn't originally know? I thought with Ren being his inspiration, he'd know more about his history. He knew he played the bass and all.
* Hachi was actually going to bring it up. Not sure if Nana actually jumped to conclusions, or if she interrupted to avoid talking about it. I'm leaning towards the latter.
* Yup, figured Shin would want to go.
* Ren finally appears. Hah, same line as Nana's visit.

I guess Yasu had inside info when he said he agreed about the lock.

It's the song that Blast played back in their hometown during Nana's flashback. Title is "Zero" by Anna Tsuchiya

I feel like it's a combination of both.

Ah-hah. I thought that might be it, but was too tired to check yesterday. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
A few people have posted about Nana only going to Yasu because he is someone she can talk to. I over analyse their relationship a lot (as you'll see from my posts as the show continues). 

I think there is a deeper connection there. As you can see when Yasu first appears, he is a big part of Nana, and there is a tension that appears, yet neither ever talk about. 

Her staring at his windows is a small part, her teasing him about sleeping with her is another, but the greatest part is the ending, where she says she does not like his cigarettes because they are addicting, then right near the end we see her smoking one. I think it's a subtle sign about her feelings. 

Also, Ren. Yay.... Eh. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it would be pretty weird for her to be harboring feelings for Yasu, given her overarching concentration on Ren.

Time apart and having someone by your side can cause the heart/relationship to wane.

Nana O and Misato left together and spent the night together.  So so many opportunities for inappropes yuri jokes.

Yasu's apartment looks like a laboratory or something.

Hey, yeah, this is the first time we've seen Yasu without his glasses, isn't it?

Jeez, Nana O, you're kinda messed up right now, aren't you?  "Joking" with Yasu about sleeping with him, abruptly taking off, getting prickly when questioned as to why you showed up at 4:53am, looking back up at his window like a puppy locked out in the rain?  This isn't the tough cool badass we've been taught to expect.

Heh, Nana K making up with Nana O is a lot like I imagine she makes up with a boyfriend after a fight.

And Nana K making up with Misato makes me think they would make a great Trapnest Fan Club/Blast Fan Club/Cute Girls Squad.  For someone so clueless in her own life, Nana K sure does put pieces together quickly when it comes to others' lives!

Finally Nana K objects again to being called Hachi!

Shin looks to be the most socially skillful person in the whole cast.  He gets told something, figures out that it's a secret, and goes along with the secret-keeping all by himself  in addition to his gigolo successes and nearly wrapping Nana K around his little finger just by calling her cute (And why does no one call her that?  She fully is!).  Nana K ought to hire him to solve her issues.

Haha, cute bit about Nana K accidentally handling her boss lady by coincidental body language alone.

And Nana K gets a perversion nosebleed from imagining a super-romantic dramatic reunion of Nana O and Ren.  I bet she's the kind of girl who gets heavily into trashy romance novels.

The way Yasu was completely impassive and motionless behind those sunglasses, when Nana K asked him to back her up in her theory, I instinctively MST3K'd a snore into his nose.

Nana K fantasizes about "going out with Takumi", even so soon after the breakup.  Some things never change!

Ren shows up to Yasu's door??  "Again"???  What gives!  Is that romantic little sneak keeping tabs on Nana O through Yasu?  Hmmmmm

One more to go!

* Meh, kind of a lame CD cover.
* Shin beat me to [drawing up a floor guide](http://i.imgur.com/ioKD9Ly.jpg).
* Hah, Yasu using his feminine wiles. Poor Ginpei, having to go through so much trouble to reschedule the interview. \*rolls eyes\*
* Haha, she's calling the baby Sachiko now.
* Pfft, Shouji ready to use that connection for autographs.
* Hachi playing things up, haha. Has she ever even met Reira? I think that's the only Trapnest member she hasn't hung out with yet.
* As much as drugs, sex, and rock & roll go together in the west, drugs can ruin a band in Japan. When Aska from Chage and Aska (Who you might know from the [music video of "On Your Mark"](https://vimeo.com/110110718) animated by Ghibli) [was caught with drugs last year](http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/05/19/aska-drug-use-answers-to-some-questions/), all of their appearances were canceled, their CDs recalled from stores, and I think their label dropped them.
* Ruh-roh. Engagement may be off.
* Nice to see those two properly speaking.
* Hahaha, love that they're bringing up [the possibility of it being the Great Demon Lord's child](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3d939c/spoilers_nana_rewatch_episode_31_discussion_thread/ct2vqvp).
* lol those disguises. Shin's Misato cosplay is great. Yasu... pffffft \*milk spew\* I do agree Nobu looks very Shouji-ish like that.
* NIce, another Sachiko scene. I wonder if we'd get to see much more of her if the series wasn't ending here.
* Another ending song, "Stand by Me" by Blast. Very different than the other songs we've heard from them.

So they'll be ending with a festival episode on episode forty.....seven. I actually expected this episode to cover the festival, but they weren't done setting everything up for it yet. I expect fireworks, in more than one sense of the word.

The genki concentration would cause an explosion!
>> ARTICLE
>... Has she ever even met Reira? 

I brought that up before it's really weird that both Nanas have yet to really meet, let alone interact with Reira. I mean, just recently did Nana finally meet her, but that was more of an introductory thing between them and nothing else. It's really interesting that Nana and Hachi are so close, yet their love interests are incredibly close to Reira, whom both don't really know anything about. 

>... drugs can ruin a band in Japan. 

A lot of personal things can ruin the reputation of a celebrity in Japan. It's bizarre and interesting how their personal loves and information are kept secret. I mean, look at the idols in Japan and how the majority of them are older than on paper, their sexual orientation and mostly tell the public they are single. It's a weird facade to showcase this purity of a character. 

Yeah, they end it on the festival, as it's kind of a turning point in the arc of the manga. Now I'm sad because I just want the rest of the manga animated. 
>> ARTICLE
**"Hey, Hachi... They say you don't realize how much you care for someone until after they're gone. But I think that it's when you come face to face with that someone again that you truly recognize your feelings for them. If I saw everyone again right now... I'm sure I would rely on them just as much as I did then.**

**I'm scared of that. That's why I can't move from this spot."**

The second time around and it hasn't changed... the reunion of Shouji and Hachi is so incredibly well done. 

I think everyone with at least a little bit of life experience knows that the deepest wounds are inflicted by the ones who we let in and get close, only for that trust to be betrayed. Those wounds heal only with time and even then the scars will never fade, because those wounds are too messy to ever close nicely. 

Such is the case with Hachi and Shouji. After a long time, they meet again, which is somewhat inevitable given how entwined their lives were at some point. I seem to recall a post of mine after I think it was episode 3, about how such encounters are somewhat awkward affairs where little emotions come up, as people move on and change.

Initially it's the same as it was with Hachi and her adult lover. Both of them are rapidly firing dialogue at each other to keep the thoughts and words from going where they are bound to go, showing what once attracted them to each other in the first place: they were and still are like two peas in a pod and certainly share heaps of chemistry. 

But here we see something more real, more mature and more painful than we saw before. When that inevitable silence falls, both of them express a single emotion and it's exactly the right one: regret. Regret from Shouji for what he did, for what he didn't notice anymore at the time. Regret from Hachi for her impulsive actions and oblivious nature, for not making an effort when she now knows she should have, and maybe knew even then. 

However much we like to believe, finding someone permanent to share your life with is not only a matter of finding that right person. It *is*, to an extent, but it is also a matter of finding them in the right place, at the right time, in the right state of mind. Compatibility isn't everything, you also need maturity, timing, work and effort and yes, even luck to get something real that lasts. 

Hachi and Shouji were absolutely right for each other, but they justweren't ready yet as people. That's what makes their moment together so special: deep down they know that with everything that happened and the people they were, things could have turned out different. It could have worked, in a different time and place.

But such is the way of the world and through the pain and tears we can only move on and learn from our mistakes, in the hope that next time maybe, just maybe... it will stick. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually like the switch in personal lives Hachi and Nana have gone through. We're introduced to Hachi, who's had her life in shambles and constantly running around, trying to get it all together while it slips through her fingers. Then Nana who was more of a rock with her personal life and knew what she wanted and her goals. Now it's the other way around.

# [Episode 46](http://imgur.com/a/dzfyl#48)

That was cathartic as a whole, but we also have everyone's desires threatening to shake things up yet again.

First we have Nana who selfishly wants Hachi back in her own life and married to Nobu. Her opening monologue even suggests she'll provide for Hachi and the baby herself, which is something I only thought was a joke when she was talking about building that big house earlier in the series. She seems a lot more serious about it now that she has the means.

I love the [room assignment chart](http://i.imgur.com/gLX5Bqp.png) for everyone in the building. And Nana made sure Yuri wasn't going to drag Nobu into her room, but she's underestimating Miu still. Not that Miu seems prone to a sudden fling like that, but she's still a threat to Nana's plan to bring Hachi back into the fold. Shin's on board with that plan too, but what's with the [images on his hat and jacket](http://i.imgur.com/atBjVJo.png)? He must really like that symbol.

And then we get Nana K and Shji. They finally have the talk they should have months ago, but it's probably better that they waited for emotions to cool off first. Shji telling Nana he still enjoyed talking with her... yeah, I've been there before too. That first conversation after a big breakup can make you miss what you've had, but you certainly can't go back to how things were before; Nana O's monologue at the end reflects that too. And it can be hard to [hold up through the entire thing.](http://i.imgur.com/taVsmp3.png)

Interwoven with Hachi and Shji (a relationship that ended) we have Reira and Takumi (a relationship that never began) talking about Nana and Ren (a relationship on the cusp of breaking or solidifying). Takumi's all business which just bothers her... until she strikes back, making him realize they could lose some fans if both him and Ren get married. We already know he's dedicated to the band, so what will his decision be?

A couple of things pushing Hachi back toward Nana now... will it happen? I certainly wasn't expecting that an episode ago, now I'm not sure.
>> ARTICLE
>but what's with the images on his hat and jacket?

What /u/Slaxophone referred to is technically correct, but the symbol is supposed to be the logo for Vivienne Westwood, a British fashion designer that Ai Yazawa greatly admires.

I still want to believe he's a Monty Python fan though.

Second last episode. You know it's going to be an emotional finale. 

One reason why I like Miu. Eventhough she has no vested interest in the group or the members yet, she'll help them out. Guess the party they had helped open some bonds. 

Nana wanting Nana back in her life, where she can protect and look after Hachi and her baby. Sad that this is caused by the large wound her mother gave her that has not healed, even now. 

Yasu does know how to work Genpei over quite well. 

Reira being shocked over Ren marriage proposal. I think she might have a little possessiveness like Nana over the men in her life. First Takumi, now Ren, and where does that leave her? 

Takumi has a lot of ulterior motives when it comes to anything dealing with the band, but it's interesting that he outright supports Ren on this, and actually hopes it'll remove his addiction as well. 

Reira being so unhappy about Takumi's marriage fires off a counter argument, which explodes in her face, as he considers it and would rather halt his own engagement in favour of Rens. The band does come first in his eyes. 

Hachi and Shouji finally meet. Interesting that they can slip back into their usual selves and have a somewhat normal conversation. Once again we see that maturity in Hachi come forth, as I am sure that her personality at the start of the series would have been her verbally attacking him while breaking down. 

They finally get to have a proper conversation about then breaking up, and talk about their broken relationship, while he gets to apologise. 

Going back to the previous episode where Hachi asked Jun about this exact scenario, it worked out for both parties. Even after all this time, it really hurts to say goodbye and close that door on someone you actually cared for. 

Does Sachiko have an engagement ring? Would make light to the comment Shouji made about Hachi's ring. 

Now we have the band waiting for Hachi, in their old apartment. A bittersweet reunion if there ever was one.
Hsving just dealt with an old love wound, Hachi has to accept what happened with Shouji, and now possibly deal with another wound; Nobu. That's a lot to deal with in one night. 
>> ARTICLE
> First Takumi, now Ren, and where does that leave her?

With Shin, because the two of them are adorable together.

And I'm glad that the Hachi we have now is quite different from the one early in the series, she needed the development the most... aside from maybe Ren, who we never saw much of before. He regressed, if anything.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but dating a fifteen year old is definetly asking for trouble. Plus, you know the whole loving Takumi as well. 

It's one of the reasons why I don't like Ren as a character. There isn't a lot of depth for him, besides being all depressed because he loves Nana, and unusually kind to Reira. 
>> ARTICLE
I finally caught up after been behind by 17 episodes.

I need my min Nobu to find some love.  It seems like it's going to be Hachi based on what Takumi said, but I would prefer if it's Myu.

Myus seems to be interested in Nobu but the age difference, but that aint nothing but a number, Nobu is mature for a 20 year old.

Shojiu seems to see that he may still have feelings for Hachi, or did I read him wrong?

Yasu you are the man with your purple fro.

I still dont like you takumi.

Black Stones making bank!

Don't tell me they actually named the baby Sachiko haha it better be a boy so they change it!!

Glad to see her get closure with one of exs

If Takumi breaks off the marriage...ugh

These disguises!!!

Ring on Sachiko's finger ;)

Yeah but Nana will do anything to have Hachi back in her life. Nobu is her last gambit, and connection between herself and Hachi. Doesn't have faith that her alone can hold onto Hachi. :(
>> ARTICLE
>  Doesn't have faith that her alone can hold onto Hachi. 

Which is dumb lol haha I get why she thinks like that but knowing otherwise bleh
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it is, but it's always been part of her character. Abandonment issues weigh heavy on her, even with that ego of hers. Mother and Ren leaving her left a rather large hole in her heart, thus the desperate need for fans, and wanting to hold onto those close to her without consideration of what they want. 
>> ARTICLE
> Come on NANA even I'm done shipping those two

That's kinda how I feel too. Nobu will likely be happier with someone else.

> Ring on Sachiko's finger ;)

I saw that too!
>> ARTICLE
I do hope they get closure though! And eah I'm happy for Sachiko and Shouji if it's true!
>> ARTICLE
Whoa.  Lot to unpack in that short opening monologue this time.

* Salary?  The music biz in Japan is a bit different, huh?
* Their album is named _Lucy_?  Wha?
* "I thought I'd have no problem supporting Hachi.  And her child."  Err say *what* now?

Man, those *are* some paper thin walls  alarm clock in the next room can wake you.

That map.  "Pretty boy (me)".  Shin?  "Yamagishi (released from prison)".  Who, the front desk dude?  "Ginpei (gay)".  Welp, guess that answers that question I had.

Haha, Shin 'ships Nobu  Nana K too.  All we need is Yasu for the hat trick.

What the heck are Shin and Nobu wearing?  Also, I want to take a second to point out something that's been bugging me for a long time now.  You know the shape of Shin's big lighter?  Saturn with a cross on its forehead?  That thing seems to show up everywhere.  Shin has them on his hat and coat, Nana O has a ring with it, Nobu has earrings of it, and so on.  What the heck is that thing and why is it all over the place?

"Why's he so in love with Yasu?"  Why are *you*?  Why are we *all*?

Man, Nana K and Shouji finally meet again after like a million episodes.  They start right back in talking like nothing happened.  Glad it's not just palpable awkwardness.  Also, this early meeting takes some of the pressure off the fireworks festival.

Hm, so whatever Ren's on, it's not physically addictive?  Kinda narrows it somewhat, I suppose.  I'm no expert though.  Also it's kind of hilarious to hear Takumi say if anyone finds out, the band is over.  Rock bands, doing drugs?  Heavens!

"It's better if only Ren got married."  Hm.  Interesting conclusion to leap to there.  I can't help but feel this is setting us up to hope for Nobu  Nana K.

What's this July 7/777 thing?  Just so many "nana"s?

What a bittersweet parting.  That whole scene on the sidewalk.  ;_;

Those are the greatest costumes ever.  Gotta say, Nana O looks pretty hot with that semi-hime-cut wig.

Oh my god, Shouji and Sachiko holding hands.  &#x2764;

Poor Nana K.  Guess she loved Shouji more than she let on.  Or acted like.  Well, it's water under the bridge now.  But it will probably inform her reaction to seeing Nobu again  she'll be on the other side of the conversation, knowing how she herself felt in Nobu's shoes.  Again, this all feels like we're suddenly hurtling toward something we thought was now impossible.

Nana O's closing monologue also seems pretty fraught.  For once the dub and the sub agree word for word for a considerable length, too.  "If I saw everyone again right now I know that I'd depend on them just as much as I did back then.  I'm scared of that.  That's why I can't move from this spot."  Whoa.  Implying that in whatever future time she's talking from, she's apart from the band and everyone else?  Sequestering herself somehow?  I don't like the sound of that.

>> ARTICLE
> Haha, Shin 'ships Nobu  Nana K too.

He's the one that got them to hook up in the first place! Made them both go out to get more drinks while Nana O was away. 

> You know the shape of Shin's big lighter? Saturn with a cross on its forehead? That thing seems to show up everywhere. Shin has them on his hat and coat, Nana O has a ring with it, Nobu has earrings of it, and so on. What the heck is that thing and why is it all over the place?

As /u/Slaxophone noted: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_cruciger

I knew what it was but I'm still not sure why it shows up so often in the series.

> What a bittersweet parting. That whole scene on the sidewalk. ;_;

So good, but it gave me flashbacks to a vividly remembered day in my own life.

> Whoa. Implying that in whatever future time she's talking from, she's apart from the band and everyone else? Sequestering herself somehow? I don't like the sound of that.

Yeah, I'm not sure what state her or Nana K are in for these monologues. They sound wistful at best.
>> ARTICLE
> He's the one that got them to hook up in the first place!

Right you are.  I guess I should have said *still* 'ships.

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_cruciger

Seems she's also the one behind the Sex Pistols' famous clothes-shop origin, SEX, and much of UK punk fashion back then.  Everything fits!
>> ARTICLE
And so we begin Nana K's stint as a groupie in the truest sense of the word, I guess.  Takumi is a hell of a player, but he also has a point about having made the effort to call specifically for Nana K out of the blue.  It's not as though he doesn't have his pick of the litter in every city on the tour.

I'm slightly surprised and impressed to see Nana K's heavy degree of self-awareness about the whole thing.  She only seems to be harboring the tiniest speck of hope about what this really is.  I half-expected her to muse that at least this would let her one day brag to her grandchildren about that time she banged the dude from Trapnest.

And how about that somber music under the whole thing?

"Naoki and I are just the blond guy and the dude with long hair."  "No, that's not true!  To me, you're *easily* the best, Taku"  "*[Glance that says 'I have you now']*"

Huh.  What is with [this look](http://i.imgur.com/BMifqAx.jpg) Takumi gives Nana K after she says it's not like she expected him to be lying next to her in the morning?  It almost looks like he's disappointed.

"Why don't you warm up while you're waiting for me?"  Yowwww.

Hahah, and then she "warms up" by doing sit-ups.  I don't think that's what he meant, hon'.

Holy shit!  I think Nana O's first cell phone is the same as my first one  Ericsson T28 World!  Would have been around that same time frame, too.  What a great phone that was.

"I'm just teasing, you don't have to freak out!"  Yes she does, Nana O.  Yes she does!

"I don't want her to think I'm a *slut!*"  I dunno, Nana K, I think you have every justification in the world not to consider this slutty.  Big fancy rock star you idolize picks you up in his big fancy ride, sweeps you into his big fancy suite, dishes out the compliments, splashes out the amenities and after all the shit you've just been through.  It would probably take the restraint of a saint not to go along with it.

Whoa, even Jun thinks the two Nanas may be more than just friends!

Dang, 1:38am.  He wasn't kidding about leaving early.  But he did leave his contact info.  He really didn't have to do that, which makes me wonder.

Poor Naoki.  Seems like he's the butt-monkey of the group!

"Abs of steel"??  Huh.  Not sure I've heard of that particular fetish by a guy for a girl

Nana O teases Nobu about being in love with Nana K.  I guess what we're learning here is that whatever Nana O teases about is always true!

Good to hear Shoji and Sachiko are getting on well.  (Poor Shoji doesn't even get a line, though!)  And the old-couple schtick between Kyosuke and Jun is great, haha.

Seriously though if anybody has read as far as I have in the manga even after watching NANA and hoping for another season, you'd wish that the author could pick up where she left off again. Is there still no news on her condition yet? Cause that's the only reason why I can say that there isn't another season right now because the author was sick and went on such a long hiatus.
>> ARTICLE
It really does suck that she stopped so suddenly. She was hospitalized, but we'll probably never know from what. 

From what I know, she was discharged from the hospital in 2010. Then in 2013, she drew a new installment of "Junko's Bar/Junko's Room" (an omake/extra that features characters from NANA which usually breaks the 4th wall). From then on, she's been sporadically doing more "Junko's Bar" and new illustrations/art for merch stuff for Cookie (the monthly manga magazine NANA was published in).

No news on if she'll continue with NANA, but it's nice to know that she's still drawing.
>> ARTICLE
I feel some mangakas are just irresponsible. Buying manga, especially in the form of tankobon, is a kind of investment. It is a rather cheap investment, but if they bought it *from you* it creates a supplier-customer relation. 

Robert Jordan was diagnosed with amyloidosis and died the next year. He however acknowledged that his fans wanted to have the complete *Wheel of Time* story and labored to honor it before his demise. His last novel, concluding the story that had began 23 years before, was published six years after his death. 

Why mangakas like Miura and Yazawa abandon their fans like that is incomprehensible to me (yes Miura posted a chapter like every year but really Berserk is pretty much on hiatus). Hire a co-author, hire 5 assistants to do the drawing, do something except letting your work waste away.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but I don't see it that way. From the art drawn by Ai Yazawa, you could just tell that she absolutely loved her work and she wouldn't have abandoned it over something so petty, besides, it's a source of income for her, do you really believe that she'd sacrifice her career over something like that even if it meant disappointing her fans?

Use some common sense, I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm simply saying that I disagree.
>> ARTICLE
We have too little info on Yazawa to say anything but Miura sure as heck is alive and kicking. In any case the example I've given is even more extreme and yet it turned out still can be done.

Jordan was dying, he had one year to live. A single WoT novels usually take several years to complete. He did everything he could, writing down the main plot line, leaving a legacy so that a co-author can flesh it out and finish the story.

There is a time limit for this kind of thing. If for example Yazawa waited a decade before continuing then many readers, especially the ones that have followed from the beginning, will be in their 40s or even older. By then NANA is just not as interesting to them. Sure she will gain *some* new followers but most will have moved on. Manga, unlike novel, dont contain a lot of story. Even long running serials can usually be quite easily put into a single novel. Unless she's in a vegetative state or something as drastic, it is hard to imagine a situation where writing / dictating the main plot line of manga story for others to flesh out and draw will be impossible.

Some authors do vehemently disagree that such obligation exist (see: Neil Gaiman in http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/05/entitlement-issues.html ). But this is basically why these days I'd only buy serialized story like manga when they're 100% finished. "Here's your 100 dollars, give me the story, all of it."
>> ARTICLE
I think we all knew where this was heading.

* Smooch Smooch Honk.
* Hah, Hachi had a similar reaction to Nana's at seeing the hotel room.
* Hachi has so many conflicting feelings. 
* Fuji's on the right side, blond guy.
* Reira and Nana both showing some jealousy. Yasu, you dog!
* Nice Yasu impersonation by Nana, shows off Romi Park's chops. I really need to track down that recording of her appearance on Yaguchi Hitori where she impersonates the hosts.
* Very "Oh by the way" scene; Shouji and Sachiko are shacking up. Sachiko needs more screen time.
* Junko and Kyosuke need to get hitched already, they're sounding like an old married couple anyway.

Hachi knows what she's getting into this time at least. I think Hachi may be a little overly cynical, he's probably not as cold as she thinks he is- celebrities can be lonely too. She really should tell Nana though, she'd set him straight.

...Also, she forgot to get his autograph again.

I don't think he's all bad.

Ren had playboy reputation until Nana O. Maybe Nana K can be Takumi's Nana? ...I'm not seeing it though.

>> ARTICLE
For today: [this is where I expect Nana to end up with her career.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw)

Yep, Takumi's a player. Listen to Nana, Hachi! Run away! On the other hand, if she actually wanted to just sleep with him there's nothing wrong with that. At least she's well aware of her situation this time.And Takumi actually left his number and email? Didn't expect that, even if he never contacted her during the tour.

I love that Junko *sniffed* her phone when the text from Hachi seemed fishy. I don't like that no one knows about the thing with Takumi though. Hachi's going through a rough period and being honest with her friends would probably be the best option for her. At least she could confide in Yasu as he's good at keeping secrets, but her feelings about him stop that from happening.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite part of this show is how realistic and flawed the characters can be. I am disappointed in Nana K's action but stuff like this happening is rather common among girls like her having the chance to meet some famous rock star that they idolize. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I might have mentioned this once or twice before but I love the title card designs they come up with for every episode so I made an album for all of them. For the most part they were easy to track down since they usually appear immediately after the OP or its following scene, but episode 3 was the tricky one as it had the title card *before* the OP and I ended up rewatching half the episode before jumping back to the beginning to look for it.

I like that nearly the entire episode is about the time between the dress rehearsal and the live show. Deservedly so, as there's a lot going on in that window.

Nobu tries to connect with Miu but that fell flat. Is he ever going to catch a break? I'm amused that he says every guy in BLAST is an Aquarius but that's quickly dismissed by Shin after that. I'm guessing Nobu's just going by Shin's official profile which is probably lying about his real birth date.

Speaking of which, Reira and Shin hook back up and they're solidifying their own relationship. At least someone's happy here! It was pretty obvious to us that he was trying to sneak off to see her, but I wonder if the rest of the band knows what's going on. Same thing from Trapnest's side, do they know or even care? I'm guessing Takumi would have something to say about fraternizing with the enemy but no one seems to mind Ren and Nana dating at any rate.

Nana... can't help herself, still. Drowning in Ren's love indeed. Though it looks like Ren's doing a lot worse without her than she was without him. His conversation with Yasu makes me think drugs; can't say I'm all that surprised.

Meanwhile, Hachi's settling into her new life and it appears to suit her quite well.

Thanks for the title card gallery. I was just thinking they've been getting more abstract lately.

Still rooting for them!!

I know right!!

Yeah she seems pretty solid which actually really nice to see

I like the contrasting relationship dynamics in this episode.

You have Nana, who throughout the entire series thus far has had a highly emotional/sexual chemistry relationship with Ren, and either one doesn't know if they'll make it through the day together or end up dying with one another. Also, turning the dreadful feeling she has of not being able to breath into a sexual act was a nice touch. Also, marriage proposal by Ren, pushed by Yasu weirdly.

Then you have Nana and Yasu. Going from someone who looked after her, to someone she knows has feelings for her, to him acting distant at times (for her and Ren's sake), then her coming to the conclusion that Yasu does all this *just* for Ren. If she know how he backed off because of Ren's substance abuse, I'm sure she'd see it in a completely different light. I mean, why did he tell you not to go to Japan, Nana?

Ren and Yasu's relationship is also a highly strained one. Nice to see Yasu show his caring side, not just for Ren, but for Nana. Giving them distance because they are both becoming highly destructive. Of course Nana takes it the wrong way, as does Ren, thinking he always lets Ren take what he wants, and hating him for it. [Manga spoiler:](/s "loved later on when Reira and Ren are talking about Yasu in the past, and he states that out of everyone Yasu allowed Ren to take, she was the only one kept to himself. Showed how much he actually loved Reira.")

Reira and Shin, running as fast as they can to see each other, living in the moment of each other's company. Of course everyone gets caught up in a new, exciting relationship, especially when you continue to find things in common, but I keep feeling their love is in desperation of the moment, regardless of how they truly feel for one-another.

Nobu fails once again, going after Miu. Weird how Japan seems infatuated with blood types as a matching symbol. Nobu gets rejected once again, but bluntly stated this time. Plus, there seems to be something with Nobu and girls with emotional baggage he's attracted to.

And it comes to Hachi. Interesting to see how she's become so domesticated, basically trapped in the apartment like a songbird in a cage. Talking with Jun-chan, you can see that Hachi is actually putting forth a lot of effort into making the place, and herself presentable as a home for Takumi. She's genuinely accepting her circumstances and, and slowly showing love for Takumi, and it's the saddest coupling out of them all. 

EDIT: Also, after forty-odd episodes two of the three female MCs finally meet. Weird that Nana and Hachi have never interacted with Reira before, but have meet every other male in both bands numerous times (even poor Naoki).
>> ARTICLE
Psst, your spoiler tag's broken.

> basically trapped in the apartment like a songbird in a cage.

*That's* the comparison I was looking for. It fits her so well.

> She's genuinely accepting her circumstances and, and slowly showing love for Takumi, and it's the sadest coupling out of them all.

This is where the depressing realism of the series seeps into the forefront. She wants to be with Nana and BLAST and... she just *can't*. Too many factors against her. So instead she's coming to terms with the situation she's in and making the best of it. 

>> ARTICLE
Snap! Too tired to even finish making the spoiler tag. Thanks for the catch.

It's why I like this episode a lot. It's a great mixture of the romance with every person, but also showcases the emotional baggage and hang ups they all have.

I mean, Hachi has the perfect life (on paper), with everything she's ever wanted with a relationship, but at the cost of an emotionally detached partner.
>> ARTICLE
And having to leave most of her friends behind.  Sadly all too common in marriages for one reason or another
>> ARTICLE
Wonder what the heck Ren is messed up on.  Shakes, lethargy, weight loss.  I guess it must be recent or Nana wouldn't have noted that last item (later on).

"The two of you are just not cut out for the music industry."  Uh, sorry, Yasu, but have you *met* people in the music industry?  Not exactly a bunch of well-adjusted straight-edges.

Is Ginpei supposed to be gay?  I thought Richard Ian Cox was just giving him a funny read, but this "women are evil"/"I'm with Yasu"/"sparkling at Shin" stuff has me wondering.

"I wonder if he jerks off to Yuri."  Haaaaah.  Don't we all, Nana O.  Don't we all.  "I haven't been with Ren for a month.  He's *gotta* be sleeping with other women by now."  Jeez, *one month*?  You don't have much faith in us men, do you?

Hm, good acting back there, Shin.  *Ohh, I'm soooo tired*  And then *running* to the Vanagon for a rendezvous with Reira.  Sly dog.

In Reira's hands, that lighter looks like it's the size of a freakin' baseball.

"Marry me"?  Huh.  I did not see that coming.  They even tried to telegraph it a little with that wedding theme to the music video.  (Nana O sure didn't see it coming either)

Poor Nobu can't stop thinking of Nana K, even all this time later, even when he's hitting on other women.  :(

Reira and Shin have the same birthday??  Well, that'll be convenient for parties.

Uh, whoa.  Nana O and Ren gettin' into some seriously kinky shit.  *Allo*erotic asphyxiation.

Sheesh.  It didn't even *occur* to Nana O that Yasu has refrained from doing her because she's taken?  Guh.  We're not *animals* ovah heah.  "[Yasu and Ren have] been friends since Ren was born.  In the same orphanage."  Whoa, what?  Yasu's an orphan too?  Is that new info or did I just miss it?

Heh, this *I can't escape my fate of drowning in his love* is really shoujo-ey.

More acting, from both Shina and Reira.  *Ha-ha, long time no see, how ya been, ha-ha.*

Looks like Nana O's true Achilles' heel is genki girls (Nana K, Reira).  Throw one at her and all her defenses go down.

Didn't take long for Nana K to get spoiled rotten.  Makes me think a hard rain must be comin' for her soon.

>> ARTICLE
>  It didn't even occur to Nana O that Yasu has refrained from doing her because she's taken? 

Good for Yasu for not being that level of asshole. What I took away was that even in the time after Ren left for Tokyo and left everyone behind, Yasu saw Nana as destined for him and let her be.

> We're not *animals* ovah heah.

...you from southie?

>  "[Yasu and Ren have] been friends since Ren was born. In the same orphanage." Whoa, what? Yasu's an orphan too? Is that new info or did I just miss it?

I didn't know it either. Nobu's the only one in the band with parents, apparently.

Yasu is the ultimate bro.  He is the friend that you always wished you had.  He will also have your back.

> ...you from southie?

No, but it's fun to pretend sometimes, isn't it?  :p

>I didn't know it either. Nobu's the only one in the band with parents, apparently.

And he bolted from them to be in the band.  Grass is always greener, eh?
>> ARTICLE
> Is Ginpei supposed to be gay?

The Japanese dub has him pretty flamboyant.

> "I wonder if he jerks off to Yuri."

I think she's referring to Yuri Kosaka, their porn star neighbor. She was suspicious last episode when Yasu recognized the name.
>> ARTICLE
> I think she's referring to Yuri Kosaka, their porn star neighbor.

Heh, I know.  It just works on both levels.

Seems like a phase he goes through, as Yasu says "again" when they are in the bathroom stall.

> Is that new info or did I just miss it?

New. Yasu's past has never really been in-depth (later on in the manga it goes into a lot more detail).

**Episode 44**

Miu is amazing so far and the performances have been fun so loving thse last bit of eps!

They had love triangles, pregnancy, cheating so I'm not even surprised to find a drug problem? (really really over this route in media right now though)

Reira and Shin are just adorable...

Ren proposed! Kinda figured it woiuld be that :p

I'm all for Nobu moving on

NANA and Reira's meeting haha perfect :p

Because she would overshadow all the females in the show, and all but one of the males. :)

I dunno, right now I still like Reira more than Miu. Could use more of both of them though.

We all have favourites.  ;) 

Plus Miu doesn't get much screen time in the anime.

Would be okay with that ;)

**"Hey, Hachi. Back then I was full of regret for introducing you to Takumi. But if you're still with him now, and you're happy, that makes me feel better.**

**It's my only ray of hope."**

Nobu being wishy-washy again with the women he likes, Shin and Reira with the cute romance, Hachi finding fulfillment in basically becoming a mother, today's episode was stuffed. But forget all of that. Today, it's someone else's turn.

Today, let's talk about Ren. He's probably the character I've spent the least amount of time on and that has been a calculating move from my part, mostly because I was waiting for this moment with Yasu. 

When we're talking about the change in personality characters go through during a show's run, we frequently use the words character growth, a term I don't necessarily hate... but it annoys me very much that it's used instead of character development to describe the aforementioned process. 

Ren is the reason why. Well, not really just Ren, more that he's one of the best examples of why the term 'character growth' should be used with care. Because Ren as a character doesn't grow: instead, he is broken down or even shrunk, if you want the complete antonym. 

We first see Ren from Nana's flashback as this immensely cool, suave and wildly talented guy, who needs no man or woman, but romances plenty of the latter, while still being that amazing guy that basically saved Nana from a life filled with emptiness. 

Even though we see a moment of vulnerability from him, somehow that builds him up even more as a great guy and throughout the first part of the show he looms in the background as a sort of demi-god, one or several tiers above the rest of our very mortal cast. 

But after we get to know him, this whole carefully crafted colossus of an image is deconstructed brick by brick and today we pull away the last of the veneer to reveal the real Ren.

And what we see is... well, I can't even euphemize it: it's straight up pathetic. He's an unstable, weak, spoiled, addict. That may be harsh, a bit too harsh even and he certainly has his strengths, but come on. After all is said and done, Ren is the weakest guy, no, person in this entire show. He is only held together by the people around him and when they can't carry him, he turns to drugs to cope. 

Ren is charming, nice and romantic, but if Nana is as fragile as glass, then Ren is more fragile than pure crystal, less stable than a house of cards, more feeble than a naked clam. 

All things considered there might be people who come off worse, but Ren's weakness might just be the biggest character flaw of them all. 
>> ARTICLE
Interesting.

* Laughing turns to crying. Ren's going bye-bye. Yasu alluding to drug use.
* Shag-wagen.
* He lost weight? Pretty much everyone in this show are twigs, so I'll take her word for it.
* Whoa. Well so much for ending it there.
* Haha, age gaps everywhere. And of course 7 years difference for all of them.
* Kinky.
* Hmm... Yeah it isn't like her to be so slow on the uptake.
* Shin was wearing his lighter in the dressing room, but not out on stage. Reira's acting put to use, "long time no see!" when they probably both still smell from the bus romp.
* Haha, Reira and Nana's first meeting. The others had met Reira already, but I guess she still didn't know her personality.
* Would be interesting to hear Hachi's thoughts again [right there](http://i.imgur.com/pAGstWN.jpg).

"Winter Sleep" for the ending song again. The lyrics seem to apply more to Ren and Nana's relationship than Shin and Reira's, despite the imagery.
>> ARTICLE
Fly ball!

* Bet she bought the oven just to bake that cake. I still haven't been able to properly bake shit in a Japanese oven. I think the convection throws off my recipes.
* Nice save, Nana.
* Hmm... Didn't run into each other after all.
* Haha, Mizukoshi's movin' on.
* Hachi worried about dying alone... She should go ahead and adopt a few cats, the apartment allows pets and all.
* As I thought, Yasu's got a good handle on the business side of things.
* Even Nobu gets a cool line every now and then.
* Okay, place your bets everyone!

Forgot to add this point: 

* Shin really gets Yasu talking about Reira. I wonder if Shin was smooth enough not to tip him off.

Okay, I'm sure a lot of us are excited that she finally accepted Nobu, but is this really a good thing before things are settled with Takumi?
>> ARTICLE
There is hope in the world!

I like that it opens with the next morning and we see how people are doing after the previous episode's downer ending. Nana shows up to nudge Nobu in the right direction and [she looks hilarious as a faux-housewife.](http://i.imgur.com/b0Vo9KS.png) And good thing she didn't let him charge right over to their apartment where Hachi would be conspicuously missing.

Hachi quietly departs from Takumi's room and she realizes she's basically doing the same thing he did when they first hooked up. It took a while, but I think she's coming around.

And Shin and Reira are still going with their thing. Slow progress?

The scene with Takumi and Reira in the car is more insightful in retrospect after what Yasu said about them later in the episode. Reira used to (maybe still does?) like Takumi so she's a little embarrassed after having Shin over, while Takumi's only looking out for her career. "Being human is tiring," from her in the flashback is the best one-sentence summary of how this show makes me feel.

We got a lot more talk of debuts and record labels than I expected, but it's a good look into how everyone's feeling as they're getting more popular. Also [Princess Nana.](http://i.imgur.com/e0zsGYG.png)

It's kinda funny how blatantly obvious Shin is about pushing Hachi and Nobu together and no one says a thing about it. It worked though! Shin was right: Nobu can trash Takumi as far as love goes, and after the initial awkwardness he said just what Hachi wanted to hear.

Nana and Shin teaming up to put Nobu and Hachi together, I wonder if she told Shin to get them alone while she was away. Everyone betting on whether or not they'll hook up at the end is hilarious, but [ouch, Nana.](http://i.imgur.com/5MbdgyC.png) I'm still not sure what Hachi's narration at the end means.
>> ARTICLE
Odd that Nana K only now starts fretting about how she'll never be a member of the band.  Especially since the band members themselves have made it so clear how much they love having her with them all the time.

Hahaha, Nana O really went to some lengths to put on a Nana K act for Nobu.  I think this is the first time in the entire series she's been dressed in normal clothes!  Also, Nana O points out how Nobu has to work today; which makes me realize, I guess I never thought he had a job.  Not to mention that Nana O's is still a mystery.

Again with Nana K being a whiz at cooking.  *Wait, I got it.*  She should become the band's permanent chef!  (Once they're rich rock stars, at least.)

That shot of Nana K's makeup hitting the floor, and her kneeling on the floor gasping, scared me for a second.  I thought it was gonna be violence from Takumi.  "He must be exhausted.  But still, he let me come over."  I have an idea you've got your causes and effects mixed up there, Nana.  If you pick up what I'm layin' down.  She sure is quick to blame herself for everything; one instance of her going to him, and suddenly she's the user?  Easy there, Nana.

Something just hit me about this business between Shin and Reira.  I just checked, and Reira's supposed to be 23, and Shin 16.  That's a pretty clear violation of the old half-plus-seven rule, for a start.  Not to mention the prostitution aspect of the thing.  I have a feeling if the genders were switched, a lot of people would be a lot more weirded out.  Still, it seems somehow cute and melancholy?

That little scene in the van between Reira and Takumi takes on a bit more depth in the light of Yasu's later story regarding their pasts.  Scenes between them in previous episodes, too, come to think of it.

Nana K's starting to hit that existential life crisis where you wonder what you're doing it all for.  At such a tender age, too.

BAM, Mizukoshi outta nowhere!  Also, once more breaking rules, this time the one that says childhood friend never wins.  Fascinating edition of _Fun With Dubs Vs. Subs_ here, too.

* Nana K in dub:  "If only I could spend every day with someone I love".
* Nana K In sub:  "If I could just cook every day for someone I love".

Iiiiinteresting.

Wow.  Nana K is so starved for praise and genuine feeling, Shin has her in his pocket in ten seconds flat.

I really love the scene at the dining room table here.  Nana K and Nobu so in sync; Yasu and Misato also being fully in sync and displaying lots of assured expertise, despite the almost comical contrast in looks and demeanor.  (New 'ship, squee!!)  Then Nana K makes a big dramatic speech pumping Nobu up, pretty much putting him in her pocket too.  Plus some blatant shoving from Shin.  Sometimes you're a treasure, lad.

In fact, Nobu and Nana K are so in sync, he's even wearing a Nana-K-style neckerchief.  Fortunately Shin's plan fully works; the wall of awkwardness comes down and the dominoes keep toppling till something great happens.  I'm so happy about that.

Meanwhile, Yasu fills in a lot of information about the intertwined past of Trapnest and Blast.  I still don't quite get why he persuaded Ren to make the switch, though.  Maybe his whole purpose there was to break up Blast once and for all and settle into the stabler life of a lawyer?  At any rate, it seems like Yasu and Takumi are the true nuclei of their respective bands.

Hahah, I love how Nana O is so happy about Shin's little maneuver.  And they all start betting on sex between Nobu and Nana K!  Holy overstepping, Batman!  More _Fun With Dubs Vs. Subs_:

* Nana O in dub:  "I bet a hundred he's done before he starts!"
* Nana O in sub:  "I bet 100 yen that **he'll come before they even do it!**"

*Wwwwwooooowwwwww.*

I caught up to this rewatch in like 2 days, so I'll just recap my feelings on the entire series so far right now. 

#Holy molly

I think my favorite character is Takumi cause I am a dick. The second favorite is probably Nana O.

My least favorite is either all of them or none of them. It's probably the same for the favorite character too, but my favorites stood out to me more. 

My favorite episode is probably somewhere in the 15-22 range. I loved the development of Hachi during those episodes and either matured a lot or showed the maturity she gained from the Shoji thing. Takumi is so badass. I can see why Hachi liked him. 

My least favorite episodes are probably the beginning ones that set everything up. They just started pretty slow for me. I loved the progression and pacing of the story since then though.

I have loved the series, and I didn't think I would like it because of how the characters were drawn. The five heads weren't very appealing. The episode number was pretty daunting too. But I had nothing else to do, and I saw the rewatch thread a few days ago and dove in head first. 

But man, I am glad I began to watch this series, and I thought it was like some yuri shit from the picture on netflix, but I am glad it was not.


Edit: Hmm probably my second favorite character is Shin. Both Takumi and Shin are pretty bad people, and I guess I have liked the villain. But I don't think they are evil people, just out for themselves and their respective bands, and I always have liked those types of characters. Suprising that I hate the color black in magic. My idol is either Kanye West or Al Davis so its like that even in real life.

Edit 2: I think I like this series cause the characters are all pretty despicable, other than Yasu and Nobu. And Junko and Kyonsuke(pretty sure that isn't spelled right but I do what I want shout out to Takumi)


>> ARTICLE
>I think my favorite character is Takumi 

Hallelujah. Spread the word, brother.

I think he's a pretty cool character. You know where his priorities lie  (his job / band comes first) and it's a take it or leave it situation. I mean he's a frickin' rock star, obviously he's gonna sleep around.
>> ARTICLE
He's pretty touchy about her being with other guys, for a rock star
>> ARTICLE
I like Shin the most but dislike Takumi. They might both be 'bad people', but Shin conducts himself in public amiably and is generally a relaxed guy, whereas Takumi gives off the 'takes everything too seriously' douche vibe.


>> ARTICLE
Takumi is definitely a [brilliant jerk](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=brilliant+jerk) kind of character, ala House M.D.; no one would put up with his shit, except he's too damn awesome.

I actually don't hate him either. I can relate to the isolation he must feel, which is pretty much self-inflicted. According to Yasu's story this episode, he is making strides towards working better with others though. I wonder if he'll be able to find a partner he can respect as an equal, as he has with his bandmates.
>> ARTICLE
I too like Takumi. He doesn't come off to me as "villainous" as he might towards others, maybe that's just because of how I'm able to relate to him because the character is so realistic. I just understand his character more than others, I like Shin too but he'd be my least favorite because of how mysterious his background is, i have no idea what's really going on with him in why he's even a character in the series in the first place.

I'm sure that the author meant to clear that up at some point but she never did in the manga. I just know what little is revealed about Shin and his father in one scene during an episode and that's it.

okkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk calm down there Hitler!

I gotta admit the series length is starting to get to me, not used to watching such long series.

Happy that Blast is getting more popular and Misato sure knows a lot :O

Nana and Nobu are just adorable together

Really enjoyed the scene where Nana talks about how Nobu thinks too highly of her. For me the most "realistic" part so far

And wow him just pulling her in like that, go Nobu go!!

I am so tempted to drop this series right now...this is a good ending and I doubt the actual next episodes will have good things happen haha.
>> ARTICLE
You won't find another anime (/manga) like NANA. While there are plenty that are just as realistic, this one will just hold a special place in your heart whether you hate how it ends or love it.
>> ARTICLE
>  this one will just hold a special place in your heart whether you hate how it ends or love it.

Hasn't gotten there yet but we'll see!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, knowing what you like I feel bad for telling you to watch it :/

It's going to be painful, but there are somethings to look ahead. Though if you want to drop out now an have your own head canon(assuming that it's not!), that's fine. Least you gave it a shot!

Going to warn you further about watching Jossei shows though. They will give you similar feelings. At least the ones I've watched (Chihayafuru, Nana, Honey and Clover). Chihayafuru was different since it was highschool  setting. And it was much lighter in general 

I think you might continue to enjoy Nana if you [](/s "detach yourself from Hachi right now")

I'll finish it but if anything I'll have to try and remember this ending as a good time :/

Don't know if you seen my edit (habit of mine to always revise posts),  spoilish but it might help you enjoy it.

Missed it!

Yeah Chiayafuru wasn't that bad at all and for your spoiler I've been doing that since like episode 1!

Nobu!!! Probably happier for him than the band.  There was a lot of takumi support earlier in this thread, showing support for good ol nobu

**Episode 27**

Lmao NANA is too funny. But she's being a really good friend.

They got an offer! Happy for them :D

Nobu and Hachi are perfect for each other...so eager to grab whats in front of them.

Misato is a god damn knowledgable person lol.

Hachi will disappoint, she never disappoints with disappointing people.

Reira loved Takumi :(( That kinda kills me. But I think Reira wants to move on.

Nobu and Hachi embrace...let's see if this goes well

--

>> ARTICLE
Intro voice over of Nana feeling the brunt of loneliness, thinking that the friends she made in Blast, a tight knit group, is moving further away from her.

Nana taking the initiative and taking the food to Nabu, and lying for her. I like seeing that eventhough there is a lot of miscommunication between Nana and Hachi (both at fault), they still try to make the other happy in their own way.

Hachi pulling a Takumi and leaving before the other wakes up, and feeling the guilt about the whole exchange.

Shin and Reina development intensifies. Interesting to see Shin's perfunctory 'job' crumble due to Reina using it against him.

I do like Reina's incognito outfit in the van. Echange between Takumi and Reina is always interesting. They've known each other, but he responds to her in a business-like manner/concern. Annoys her that there really is no intimate friendship there/doesn't really treat her like a person.

No, Hachi, being married does not equate sudden happiness. Always look for a quick fix. :(

Yeah, everyone counters her growing fear of everyone leaving her. Don't need to be a member to be close to them, Hachi.

Yasu really thinking about the band's future, and what they need. He really is the father of group..

Misato, the encyclopedia of every Blast/Trapnest member, past or present, with cute hairstyles.

Shin you matchmaker. Awkward town for these two, but the attraction between them is palpable. That was a pretty cool line by Nobu, "Then come on. Shatter my illusion..." Wailing guitars are they embrace.

Shin leans a hard truth about Reina. Yasu liked her, Shin is falling for her, but Takumi is the one in her heart.

Foreshadowing and drama intensifies at the end.

[Yes!!! :D](https://38.media.tumblr.com/0d3a5462da028fe237e689720eb78f84/tumblr_ndvnw1Moa11r3rdh2o1_500.gif) I'm a huge fan of Nana and anything Ai Yazawa. I'd love for there to be a rewatch. Much like the other people have suggested, mid-late June would be the ideal time as, I imagine, most of the other rewatches would conclude.  

And considering it's a heavy show, perhaps limiting it to one episode per day, or something of the sort, might be for the better?
>> ARTICLE
ParaKiss is great as well! Maybe we can do a rewatch for that after NANA! How does starting June 14th going at a pace of 1 episode per day sound to you?
>> ARTICLE
Oh I'd love that! I think more people have heard of Nana than ParaKiss, so it'd be great!  

Yeah, June 14th sounds good to me. And at 1 episode per day, I think it works out rather well! :D
>> ARTICLE
Yes, and definitely not now.
>> ARTICLE
The vast majority of rewatches are going to end in the next 30 days so if you don't mind waiting you could start it on the second week of June. So something like this starting on the 10th June and ending on the 27th July sounds good.
>> ARTICLE
I'm in, I put it on hold for a long time now after 13 episodes in (got distracted with other stuff) and I'd love for this to be the motivation for me to get back into it. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd definitely be up to watch Nana. It's one of those shows that I've heard a lot about, would almost definitely adore, but haven't gotten around to watching yet.

Like /u/Grapeshifter said Mid-Late June sounds pretty great to me. Though personally later in June is better since that'll put it after the exam period (for Australians).

Regarding setting up a rewatch, once you've got a date when you want to start it and have worked out the sort of layout of the rewatch (1 per day, 3 per week, 1 per week, w/e) chuck a PM to either /u/Kruzy or me and we'll add it to the rewatch wiki.

I wrote that 7 months ago?! Time flies when you are having fun. :)

Nana is somewhere in my top 10. Not sure *exactly* where, but it's up there as one of the best I've had the pleasure of experiencing. It's maturity, characters, dramatic elements, music, and exploration into romance are all executed as well as they could be.

If you are still hesitant about checking it out, experiencing this one with others may be that final push you'll need to give this very nicely done anime a shot! :3

I would be open to doing a WT! for Chu2Koi, as there I can just gush my brains out about the anime. However (and I've explained this a lot in the past!) I'll probably never review anything from the Chu2Koi series due to unfair bias. It's the only anime that I rate purely on enjoyment and my own personal connection with it. :3

I don't know if I could make that promise right now.

At the minimum, since I believe a third season would be the finale for the series, perhaps I'd write something on the *whole* of the series, to "pay my respects" per se to the series that has done so much for me. :3

Sure. I had it on hold for a long while now...maybe I'd finally finish it.

I'd definitely be down for it. 

There are a lot shows I've yet to check out, but as of right now, Nana sits firmly entrenched in my top 3. It is simply the realest romance show out there. No tropes, no clichs, no guarantees. 

The only problem is that I don't know if I can watch this again after reading the manga.

Rewatching it after reading the manga brings so many more emotions to the watch though.

This episode brought to mind the scene at the end of episode 16 where Hachi daydreams about getting together with Takumi after Nana and Ren get back together. Fun before-and-after.

* [Called it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3ddnn4/spoilers_nana_rewatch_episode_32_discussion_thread/ct45daj)
* Doubt she explained herself well, considering last time. Guess Yasu got the gist of the situation though.
* Hachi can finally open up to her friends about the situation. As I thought, Takumi's course of action might have been for the best. She still avoids telling them exactly who Takumi is though. Hmm.
* Nice that both Nanas have sturdy people to listen to them nearby.
* An odd, anti-climatic way to propose. Very Takumi-like. But she seemed happy about it.


I wonder how Hachi and Nana's next conversation will go. Hachi seemed really eager to talk to her when she came back from Junko and Kyousuke's. She's on the way back now, so it won't be long unless Hachi goes to bed.
>> ARTICLE
"It wasn't Ren I wanted to have by my side."  Uhhhhh, hmmmmm.  My mind went right to Yasu, but that might equally well refer to Nana K.  Let's see

Uh, "once Nana goes solo"?  Kinda getting ahead of ourselves here, aren't we, Yasu?

Boom, yep, guess it was Yasu.  And Naoki can't get out of there fast enough.

Nana K has bugged out without even taking her phone!  Funny Jun thinks Shouji might show up in the middle of the night; when has he ever been the type to do that?

Jeeeez, that whole conversation at Jun and Kyousuke's place.  So painful.  And I fear Nana K has another impractically romanticized view about having the baby and "being connected" and everything.  Plus it makes me cringe a bit to hear that thing about "seeing the sonogram opened my eyes" and stuff  plays right into the right-wing narrative that women should be forced to have sonograms so that this exact scenario would play out and there would be no abortions forever.  (Of course this show was long before that shit ever started.)

Interesting to see Nana K very unwaveringly kept it a secret that "Takumi" is *that* Takumi from Trapnest.  I'd love to see how bad they'd flip out if they knew that little tidbit.  Interesting as well to hear Kyousuke admiring Takumi in a couple of different ways.  I guess Nana K left out that part about Takumi being a notorious womanizer and how they ever got together in the first place and all.  Without that background I suppose it would look pretty valiant of him to make that offer despite the apparent jilting.

I'm really having trouble understanding Nana K's thought process in coming to this decision.  She's been nothing but happy with Nobu and nothing but miserable with Takumi.  Plus, it seems like no one has heard of paternity testing before deciding anything.

Meanwhile Yasu has the usual calming effect on Nana O.  Too bad we didn't hear some of that "vomiting out her heart" she mentioned earlier.

Man, more and more surprises from you, Takumi.  Marriage?  But he puts it so coldly too  calculating the effects of illegitimacy on public perception, and media influence depending on whether he marries "an ordinary girl" (as opposed to what?).  Of course Nana K is totally swept up by it, because marriage.  I bet it makes no material difference, though.  It's not like Takumi's going to turn into a new person or anything.

Poor Nobu, though.  I feel for ya, man.  To have your whole new great relationship yoinked out from under you like that.  I predict suffering.

That one time Yasu just [straight up shows conflicting emotions](http://data1.whicdn.com/images/112210258/large.gif) with that hesitation while she grabs hold of him. There is a reason why he is my favourite character in this show, and it's because he hides behind those shades. It's really hard knowing exactly what he is feeling at any given time.

I just want to deconstruct Yasu and Nana in this episode, don't even care about the HUGE development going on with Hachi, Nobu and Takumi. Although, glimmers of Takumi not being the worst person in the entire universe.

Oh yeah, Naoki and Yasu, best team-up ever.


>> ARTICLE

**Episode 33:**

NANA goes to Yasu get again. She's takes advantage of him far too often. 

Does Takumi feel awful? Or even remotely sad for what's happened? He might be better than what we thought!

I don't see why NANA needs to justify her hate for Takumi. I mean she should give him a chance but he doesn't really deserve one. He does have a pretty bad reputation.

Marriage? Holy shit! Nice!

Takumi is a really interesting character. Not only do his actions vary from horrible to noble, his reasons are equally diverse. It makes him a really hard character to read... and an absolutely great character to watch.

**"No matter what path you take in life with who, as long as you're happy that's fine with me. I may never become a person who can wish for that from the bottom of my heart... But I wanted to appear graceful in your eyes.**

**Like a manga heroine who's too perfect to be real."**

There's actually not a lot going on this episode, it felt shorter than it actually was. The main thing being the juxtaposition of both Nana's turning to the anchors of their lives. But whereas one does well, the other doesn't imo.

Hachi finally explains her thoughts and it's just about the jumbled mess that we expected it to be. The only true addition that is revealed today is that she actually wanted to keep it, which makes it all just a more complex than it already was. 

She wants the child and wants Nobu as well. But she can't have the child without the right financial support, nor can she ask Nobu to throw away his dreams and future for a child that isn't even his. On the other side of the dilemma, Takumi can provide the financial part, which would make her indebted to him. 

Junko and Kyosuke listen and work through it all with admirable composure... until Jun strikes out at Nana. Here's where I'm going to be blunt and maybe somewhat controversial: Junko horribly screws up here. 

I get that she wants to help Nana and seeing as she knows Nana's personality, she thinks she needs to give her a clear outline of what she needs to do and how she needs to act.

But she is waaaaaay out of line here. She doesn't know both Takumi and Nobu that well except for Nana's comments, which she should know are not ones to blindly go by. She also doesn't know the first thing about Nobu's intentions or Takumi's, which are kind of hugely important when making such big calls. And last but not least, she tells her to choose Takumi forever if she wants the baby and to put up a front for the child's sake. 

That's horrible advice. Children are smarter than you think and they are especially well attuned to the emotional states of their parents. A child always knows when their parents are unhappy, without fail. The fact is that there is no easy fix here: a child needs both emotional and financial safety and this is not the way to obtain them. Jun drops the ball here and one can only hope it doesn't influence everything that badly. 

While Nobu and Hachi are still reeling and caught up in their own heads, Takumi at least is laying out all his cards and doing what he thinks is best. Regardless of his reasoning behind all of this, the fact of the matter is that he's chosen a course of action and he is there for Hachi. A hungry man does not care whether he's given food out of pity or because it makes the giver feel good about themselves. Likewise, Hachi can use the support, no matter where it's coming from.

Yasu on the other hand does do well here. He admits that he simply does not know and only comforts and encourages Nana O in her time of distress. It's the only thing he can do that won't cause any problems and it's the best thing to do.

While Takumi is choosing his path of action, Nana and Nobu are still nowhere to be found. If they want to fix this, they have to face the music right now. Turn away any longer and it might be too late. 
>> ARTICLE
> She also doesn't know the first thing about Nobu's intentions or Takumi's, which are kind of hugely important when making such big calls.

I thought she took that into account when she told Nana K that there were no guarantees Takumi would love either her or the baby.

> And last but not least, she tells her to choose Takumi forever if she wants the baby and to put up a front for the child's sake. 

I thought she was not saying to put up a front, but rather to change.
>> ARTICLE
This:

> I thought she took that into account when she told Nana K that there were no guarantees Takumi would love either her or the baby.

And this:

> I thought she was not saying to put up a front, but rather to change.

does not compute. She tells Nana to change, which she knows will be hard, into someone stronger. But she also tells her to not ever cry over this and that she pities a child whose mother is so gloomy. 

So basically she tells her that for her child to be born and raised safely, she has to choose Takumi, never go back on that and never complain... while she doesn't even know Takumi. That's some solid advice right there, Junko. 

She also literally says: 'You can't raise a child on love.' True enough, but you can't raise one without love either. Look at Shin and Nana O, they didn't exactly turn out undamaged. Point being, there is an option that Nana and Nobu will work things out financially. There is no chance in hell that Nana and Takumi works out emotionally. 
>> ARTICLE
> does not compute. She tells Nana to change, which she knows will be hard, into someone stronger. But she also tells her to not ever cry over this and that she pities a child whose mother is so gloomy. 

I don't see how that's a contradiction.  Change, get stronger  no more crying and gloomy.

>So basically she tells her that for her child to be born and raised safely, she has to choose Takumi, never go back on that and never complain... while she doesn't even know Takumi. That's some solid advice right there, Junko. 

Well, the alternative is to go with Nobu, who has far less resources to offer, or go it alone, which is even worse.  Also I don't think Jun knows Nobu either, does she?

>There is no chance in hell that Nana and Takumi works out emotionally. 

*We* don't even know that, much less Jun.
>> ARTICLE
> Well, the alternative is to go with Nobu, who has far less resources to offer, or go it alone, which is even worse. Also I don't think Jun knows Nobu either, does she?

Exactly. It isn't a clear-cut situation and it's one she doesn't know the finer points of. Which is why she shouldn't be pushing Nana to either side, just encourage her to make a call. She isn't well-informed enough to know which side to pick. Hell, even we can't tell for sure.

> We don't even know that, much less Jun.

Good point that Jun doesn't know that, but does she really think that Nana would love a man she has essentially cheated on again? Does she really think that relationship will stand the test, much less be healthy in the process? Junko is smart enough that she should know better. 

In relation to us, we do know, enough at least for that verdict. 

Nana does not love Takumi. She is thankful, grateful and even happy with his support, but she does not love him. Likewise, I don't have any inclination to believe that Takumi loves her. We don't know if he's capable of love at all. He may hate to see her suffer and I do think that there are enough signs to say that he cares for her in a way... but love? No. 

Neither of them loves the other and one of them will be completely dependent on the other, who incidentally does not have the best of reputations. It's a recipe for disaster, really. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree that there's little-to-no love between Nana K and Takumi.  But the problem is that Nana K has decided to go hell-for-leather for this baby, for whatever reason.  And since it seems it's Takumi's, there's really no choice.  It's not like she can just whisk his baby away to another man and give him the finger.
>> ARTICLE
> But the problem is that Nana K has decided to go hell-for-leather for this baby, for whatever reason. 

Hormones and motherly instincts kick in with a lot of women after they get pregnant. Happens very often in these situations. 

> And since it seems it's Takumi's, there's really no choice. It's not like she can just whisk his baby away to another man and give him the finger.

It's not that much of an option, no, but there are so many options in the middle too.

The best thing to do in these situations is talk first. Everyone has to speak up and say what their intentions and limitations are, then you can start working things out.

The last thing you want is to do nothing. Time won't slow down. But rash decisions are almost as bad. Takumi at least makes his intentions very clear and since no one else is speaking up and time is valuable, he's strong-arming his way through. Nobu and Nana O are dropping the ball as well here by walking away, though at least Nana O is now coming to face the music. 

Regardless of any of the choices, the situation is at the very least way too complicated for Junko to tell Hachi what to do. She's really overstepping her boundaries here. 
>> ARTICLE
> The best thing to do in these situations is talk first. Everyone has to speak up and say what their intentions and limitations are, then you can start working things out.

That is very true.  There is a lot more talking in the open going on in these recent episodes, but still not complete.

More jumbled thoughts:

* Naoki and Yasu just hanging out, glad the other characters have lives independent of our Nanas.
* Naoki can't keep his mouth shut. Maybe this will cause friction between Nana and Ren down the road? Will she even see him again before they start recording?
* Nobu checked out and I don't blame him. Don't get dragged down with her if she's not dedicated to you.
* Junko and Kyosuke with the solid advice and necessary lecture yet again. Wonder how they would react if Hachi told them Takumi was in Trapnest?
* [This needs to be stated and followed through in every series.](http://i.imgur.com/OKMxcIP.png) Kyosuke has the right idea for Nobu, and Nobu even said as much. Show him that you care about *him*, Hachi. On the other hand, maybe she's right to let him go for his sake.
* Junko runs through all the right steps: gotta let Nobu go, the kid's raised as Takumi's even if it's not, and Takumi may not love the kid. Harsh truths but ones Hachi needs to accept.
* Both Nanas fled to their most trusted friends for this. You'd think they were both having the baby, and really Nana O is reacting to it more than I was expecting.
* Nana wants to watch over Hachi the same way Yasu watches over her... I wonder what *he* thinks of her perspective of him.
* Maybe Takumi's not as much of an ass as I'd thought? Or he's still being manipulative and controlling. Hard to tell.

He's both. He's still a dick even if he does good things from time to time to show he "loves" Hachi. He just makes me so angry!

I love the music that starts when Hachi goes into mom mode with Shinichi, noir-ish with a muted trumpet.

Whoops, Sachiko can't get away from this meeting either. I was half expecting Nana to beat up Shouji and... yep, she was about to if Sachiko didn't step in. Nana cares for Hachi a lot more than she'll admit. Waiting with her is one thing, but leaping to destroy Shouji in her defense without prompting is another.

Hachi's comment about being mature enough to *forgive* his betrayal is interesting, because I really don't see this as something that should be forgiven. Maybe I'm still immature myself.

Okay, Hachi dreaming of Ren showing up at the door got me. I fully expect that to happen at some later point now.

"Don't say he was cheating," really, Junko? She laid down some harsh truths for Hachi after that, but that's exactly what happened.

I guess this concert she got tickets for is gonna be important. And again with the imagery of Ren at the door. Hm.. could Hachi date Ren at some point? That's gonna be bad.

And Hachi's single now! Time to get her life together... or maybe just fall for another guy and continue the cycle. Wonder which one will happen?

The dub had this as "try not to think of it like that".

She actually said "Shouji has been tricking/deceiving/fooling [] (damasarete ita) me all along."

Damasu [] doesn't mean cheating in a relationship sense to my knowledge, though it can mean to cheat someone out of something. Perhaps the translator translated it as "Shouji has been cheating me all along, and the editor added an 'on', based on the context.

The word for cheating in an infidelity sense would have been uwaki suru [].

Junko's reply was "It wasn't all along! And don't use words like 'deceiving'!"

Maybe she doesn't completely disagree, but thought Hachi was being too harsh with her word choices. She knows for example that Shouji was worried enough about it before to open up to Kyosuke.
>> ARTICLE
>Waiting with her is one thing, but leaping to destroy Shouji in her defense without prompting is another.

I don't think Nana fully comprehends how "loose" Hachi tends to be with her relationships. Nana and Ren were so close when they were dating so when Shoji admits to double timing, she imagines a similar degree of betrayal between him and Hachi as if Ren had cheated on her. She despised Shoji with all her being that moment and she snapped.

>"Don't say he was cheating," really, Junko?

Yeah, after all this time, I still don't know what to make of that line.

Clouds at different altitudes can be carried in different directions by winds differing in direction at those altitudes.  But my guess here is that it's supposed to symbolize deep change coming for both Nanas, and in different ways.

Just wondering, why not? Now that Hachi has more or less broken it off with Shoji and Shoji has come out with everything that's been happening, it seems reasonable that Sachiko and Shoji will work out.
>> ARTICLE
I got the impression that Sachiko feels super guilty over it, plus I think based on how their relationship started, there'd be some serious trust issues later on if it continued. If they continue, I wouldn't expect it to last long.

I do hope to see more of Sachiko though, she's a pretty interesting character and it'd be interested to see her developed a bit more.
>> ARTICLE
Heh, Nana K's dramatic "warning" scene with Shin.  She is a trifle manipulative, isn't she.  Doesn't seem to realize it yet, though.

But then Nana O immediately points it out in relation to how Nana K deals with Shoji.

Funny how many ways Nana O manages to be protective of Nana K without dropping her cool act.  From the jacket in the cold, to the takeout later on, to jumping Shoji.

Speaking of which.  Sachiko jumping to his defense.  People keep saying it won't work out for her and Shoji, but that seems more borne out of a wish to punish Shoji.  The two of them really do seem to care a lot about one another.

Meanwhile, Nana K almost seems to give up instantly.  (Nice imagery of her mind turning off like a CRT TV picture.)  And Nana O doesn't seem to quite get how Nana K can feel that way  her own experiences with love would preclude such a reaction.

And the two Nanas sleep together again in the wake of the drama.  It would be easy to make a yuri 'ship joke at this point, but I don't feel like it.  :(  Interesting that this time it's in Nana K's room, Trapnest poster and all.

Nana K's got the heartbroken blues.  I've been there, girl.

Two fakeouts in a row, first with Shoji, then with Ren.  You gotta stop playing with my emotions like that, guys!

Jun shows up to help sweep up the pieces.  Again, she's a little bit of an audience surrogate, here, trying to see things from all sides.  To point out that neither side is completely blameless.

By the way, maybe I missed it, but I'm still clueless as to what Nana O's job is.  Does she actually have one?

Nana O:  "When you're in a bind, she always seems to come through.  That's what mothers are for, I guess."  Me, speaking for Nana O's thoughts, bitterly:  "Not that *I* would know."

Hahaha, wow.  Comedy sequence with the toilet, pulling up panties in a panic, suicide misunderstanding.  I don't know how to feel about this!

So all this Ren-showing-up-at-the-door imagery seems to portend him coming back into the scene.  Not that I doubted it for a second.  I can't quite tell if it's supposed to indicate Nana K being interested in/fated to be involved with Ren, or just having literary-style visions/dreams of the future  one where she ends up bringing him into things generally (opening the door).

**Episode 14:**

"I thought Tokyo would be a much warmer place". Nope! Hachi thought that when she gets to Tokyo, everything about her life would be perfect. That'd she just have an easy and happy life...

Ah so it's this episode...

Hachi is always so dramatic haha. 

Sachiko is actually pretty cute, and she's not such a terrible homewrecker. 

RIP!!! Shoji gets caught so quickly. NANA being the badass friend she is, wants to rip Shoji's head apart. I would have punched Sachiko though :P

Just leave Hachi. I cannot take this anymore. Shoji is worthless. Ahh the music. I can't take this!
When I first watched this, I was so angry. I wanted to fast forward it. I tend to do that with scenes I cannot emotionally take.

Trapnest song is playing <3 

REN??? NOOOOOOOO WHAT THE FUCK! I fell for it twice.

Hachi isn't that upset, I'm happy. She's not an emotional wreck I expected she to be. She's growing? Yeah she's still going to be upset and cry, but at least she's not incredibly whiny. Okay maybe not. But hey atleast she got out of her bed!!!

Junko with the truth, it's going to hurt Hachi a bit. It's always nice to have a friend who's willing to absolutely call you out on your bullshit, BUT keeps it in a nice way(as much as possible) 

Trapnest live concert? Will NANA go?

I always loved this episode because what shin said about hachi in the taxi kind of sums up why I love this series so much. Nobu idealizes hachi and makes her out to be this pure girl, but she's really not. A lot of other romance genre series, both shoujo and shounen, give you this female protagonist that IS that pure girl that Nobu imagines hachi is. They're kind hearted, don't have any sexual desires, and most of the obstacles that they face are brought on by external factors like the evil ex of the male protagonist, or other things that just make them out to be this pure victim. But hachi, nana, and reira (as we see from the end of this episode) aren't that girl at all. And I think it's refreshing and just really hits closer to home.
>> ARTICLE
And this is why the change in OP and END. Things are starting to turn sour for a few characters. Still like the first OP though.

Really find it humorous with Shin dolling out some practical advice from, you know, his romantic dealings being a prostitute. :P Still gave Nobu a verbal slap for being apathetic towards Hachi.

Takumi being jealous and claiming Hachi so Nobu can never have her. How nice, and yet no one call out anyone for their mistakes/idiotic actions.

Yasu. Yasu you are the nicest person in this show, and yet we hardly get to see what's going on in your mind, or your emotions. Also, Nana calling on/relying on Yasu instead of Ren (hehe, take that).

Best scene is car scene. Nana showing that she wanted to keep people to herself, because it made her happy, and when they have someone else, she retreats into herself emotionally. Great that she can see her own selfishness.

Also, Yasu calling her out for thinking everyone else is being taken by Tranest, when Yasu never left, yet everyone else, including Nana have been taken by them. Boom! Yasu calls em like he sees em.

Nobu weirdly throwing down the gauntlet... to Hachi.

Sad to see Hachi sitting there alone, waiting for Nana, while Nana buys some things to stay at Ren's place.

Things are starting to get dramatic!

Also, Reina paying Shin for naughty time. Welp, good thing Yasu got out of that relationship years ago.

Holy crap. I couldn't even take notes while watching this episode. Had to go back and re-watch.

Side-note: Seeing more use of 3D modeling in the show. [Here's a stereoscopic conversion](http://imgur.com/a/FCztg) of the strawberry glasses in the OP. Guess that glass survived the fall in OP1. Should also be possible to do some of OP2's overhead light and bathtub clips if anyone's interested.

* Shin & Nobu sure have different views.
* Thought for a second that was the restaurant Shouji and Sachiko worked at.
* Isn't Yasu a little too winded from just running from the taxi to the front door? Jeeze guy, you're out of shape.
* Man, wish everyone had a friend like Yasu.
* I think Takumi is like Hachi in a way- too focused on his own desires, doesn't really think much about how others feel. Basically the opposite of Ren and Yasu, who care more about others than themselves.
* Nana brought up the [same point I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3c3o3k/spoilers_nana_rewatch_episode_21_discussion_thread/css1p7v), but yeah. I still don't see that happening.
* Wow, so it was because it was Trapnest that she felt so hurt. Kind of cute how much difficulty she had explaining the way she felt. Yasu seemed completely lost.
* Haha, awesome line by Yasu, and Nana's realization that she's sleeping with the enemy.
* Much, much better job on the snow in Yasu's flashback this episode compared to episode 3 & 4. 
* Well, pretty sure he wasn't lying about having work to do, even if Ren doesn't. He has all those autographs to sign for one thing...
* Yasu has a Powerbook G3 (possibly a Wallstreet model). Memories, memories...
* Hah, so much happens in the last few seconds.

I think what made this episode so compelling is Nana opening up more. While Hachi is pretty much an open book, we rarely get to see what makes Nana tick. She's still very much an enigma, it's hard to predict how she would react to certain things.

> Man, wish everyone had a friend like Yasu.

I know, I'm sad I don't.

Wasn't paying attention to that, did notice the continued use of single-hue color palettes for flashbacks. And the flashbacks still only happen for Nana O's circle of friends.

That startup sound still hasn't changed.

That's an interesting perspective. I wonder if you'll change your opinion as we go further.

>Basically the opposite of Ren and Yasu, who care more about others than themselves.

Interesting you say that about Yasu. Yes, he is an extremely caring man, but the reason he broke up with Reira was because he put his career before anything else. Then again, he was faced with the same choice when Nana moved to Tokyo, but this time he made the opposite decision.

>Hah, so much happens in the last few seconds.

Any thoughts on Reira paying for Shin and Nana moving back in with Ren? This was the episode that sold me on Starless Night as the ED.

>I think what made this episode so compelling is Nana opening up more. While Hachi is pretty much an open book, we rarely get to see what makes Nana tick. She's still very much an enigma, it's hard to predict how she would react to certain things.

A lot of it has to do with Hachi being the narrator, I think. I promise Nana will be taking over soon, and then we'll really get to know her well.
>> ARTICLE
> That's an interesting perspective. I wonder if you'll change your opinion as we go further.

Guess we'll see. He seemed genuinely surprised when everyone turned on him at the party, so I'm thinking "This guy only thinks about himself."

> the reason he broke up with Reira was because he put his career before anything else.

I think the career was just an excuse.

The circumstances aren't totally clear, but I would guess he thought Trapnest was better for Reira so he let her go, using his job as an excuse. Ren being there to look out for her probably made it a little easier for him. In Nana's and Nobu's case, he still feels they need him so he followed them to Tokyo after tying up lose ends.

> Any thoughts on Reira paying for Shin and Nana moving back in with Ren?

No comment on Reira x Shin. It isn't clear that she's moving in, the things she bought just suggest "stay over," which makes sense for a steady relationship.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I'm impressed by the reads you have; you're almost dead on. One thing to point out though, Reira went to Tokyo with Trapnest a year before Ren went and joined them, so he wouldn't have been there to look out for her.

>> ARTICLE
Dang, Shin.  You're women-wise beyond your years, lad.  His assessment seems dead-on.  The only thing he and Nobu missed was just how well Nana understood what she was doing with Takumi.  At first.

What the hell, Nobu?  You correctly say that when you love someone, you want everything from them.  But then you go on to say you have to give and never ask for anything in return?  People aren't mind-readers, man.

When Nana O finally said Takumi was at their place, Yasu had just put the coffee cup to his lips.  I was expecting a spit-take.  Dude's too cool for that, though.

Having sex with a girl under a poster of you she put there.  What a life.

I just want to take a second to appreciate that right here is a scene in an anime where two people are talking seriously in a post-coital glow, about how it went, and who has long-term relationships or not and why, and then going right back at it.  This ain't your typical show, sadly!

The conversation where Takumi says he leads a lonely life makes me feel like he and Nana K are talking past one another.  She seems to be talking about sex (believing he gets loads), and he seems to be talking about long-term relationships (saying he gets none).  They conclude with him saying he wants exclusivity, but carefully worded for *her* exclusivity, not his.  Hmmmmm.

I'm a little surprised at the lack of reaction from Yasu regarding the news.  Just a straightforward expression of regret that it's Takumi.  Does *nothing* ever ruffle his feathers?

"I don't give a damn about his bad reputation!"  Joan Jett reference, noice!  Perfect for Nana O, too.

"Ultimately, we're all alone."  Jeez, way to bring down the room, Nana O.  It's sweet the way she feels protective of Nana K, and still feels bad about feeling that way.

Trapnest takes and takes from Blast.  I guess that's true, between the direct band member transfers and the relationships.  But in the case of the relationships, it could equally be said Blast takes from Trapnest.

Nobu!  Bold move, showing up like that!  Even if it's a bit late.  Go man, go!  Say it!  *Say it!*  ***Damn you, say it!!***  (This is like a _WataMote_ moment for me, urrghhhh!!)  Aaaaand he runs off.  >:(  But not before invoking a soap-opera-level orchestra sting!  "Takumi.  *[DUNNNNNNN]*"  What must Nana K be thinking in the wake of that little performance?

Yasu's the man, quietly takin' care o' bidness.  Record label deal pending?

Whoa, *what?*  Reira's gonna "hire" Shin after all?  Yikes.  That'll simplify everything for sure  *[Rolls eyes so hard they get injured]*

Hm.  That konbini scene with Ren and Nana O.  Toiletries, including a toothbrush?  Those look like "semi moving in" items.  Hmmm!  Also, what's the deal with that manga/LN/whatever volume Ren throws in, complete with floating heart?

So many quick scenes packed in at the end, each one of which seems pretty portentous!

That's the million dollar question. I wonder if she thinks Nana snitched.

Also, she looked kind of awkward buying it with the 2000yen Yasu gave her.

> It's sweet the way she feels protective of Nana K, and still feels bad about feeling that way.

Nana feels she is being too possessive of those she cares for, something that we'll be touching on multiple times later on.

>Also, what's the deal with that manga/LN/whatever volume Ren throws in, complete with floating heart?

I think that was just a "flavor scene" thrown in to add a bit of characterization - showing Ren as a person rather than the guy that ditched Nana/Blast for Trapnest.

**Episode 23**

Hey Nana. Remember the time I fucked up? Yeah it's right now.

NANA couldn't stand it so much she left. Good. This girl doesn't learn. She had a huge support staff guiding her and all she does is fuck up. Don't know why people defend this.

Shin is way too smart. But I still don't think it justifies Hachi(yes I'm in full Hachi hate mode)

Yasu is so dependable.

Fuck this scene. Fuck fuck fuck. Please next scene. I cannot stand Takumi. He's working his way around her heart. Saying all the right things. She's going to chew it up like a dog toy.

Doesn't NANA sound like she's voiced bymiyuki sawashiro sometimes?

NANA realizes that relationships don't mean ownership. That's good.

No matter how good Takumi seems like right now, I just remember the club scene. Fuck that.

Declaration of a fight. Hype!

Reira and Shin hype? Black Stone pro debut chance hype? So many things happened those last few mins.

> Don't know why people defend this.

Because people do things wrong like this all the time.  You don't have to approve of what she does to understand and empathize.
>> ARTICLE
Hachi has a unique relationship with Shin so he's trying to look out for her, makes sense. It's interesting how he and Nobu have different perspectives on women and sexuality though.

Ah yes, Nana's out to see Yasu. Wait, why *Yasu* and not Ren like how Hachi guessed at the beginning? And in the middle of the night at that. It's incredible how much he cares for her, I have to think they would be dating if Ren had been completely out of the picture.

I'm conflicted about Takumi. It seems like he's the distant person Hachi claimed she wants with failing to stay in contact and such (and not contacting her at all during the tour) but... he wants to stay with her? I want to think he's being honest and maybe he is but he's just bad at relationships.

Nobu came *so close* to asking Hachi out, but not quite. With any luck she'll figure out what he meant with all that. I'm cheering for him now, he seems to be one of the better guys in all of this.

I don't blame Nana for being upset about Trapnest stealing everyone close to her. Ren, Hachi, and even Shin it looks like (I still think he and Reira were bad for each other). And her too, from Yasu's perspective. Feels like the entire thing will implode soon.
>> ARTICLE
> Wait, why Yasu and not Ren like how Hachi guessed at the beginning?

She knew Ren was still busy with the Trapnest after parties, and she was stuck at the diner with no money to pay her bill so needed help fast. Ren texted her as soon as he was done, ~~and she still beat him back to his apartment~~.

> I want to think he's being honest and maybe he is but he's just bad at relationships.

I think he's mostly just greedy.
>> ARTICLE
> She knew Ren was still busy with the Trapnest after parties, and she was stuck at the diner with no money to pay her bill so needed help fast.

Makes sense for why not Ren, but it didn't seem like she had ordered anything by the time Yasu got there so I don't think it would have been necessary to call him.

> I think he's mostly just greedy.

You're probably right, but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.
>> ARTICLE
>She knew Ren...

Eh, I'd say it's more she reacted by going to the closest person to her (which is Yasu, who she depends on a lot), and not Ren because Takumi is also his band-mate and wouldn't want to make waves for them.

Also, she didn't beat him to his apartment. The shot of her in the apartment is just a shot, and Ren walked into frame, not the front door.

Takumi and nobu rivalry 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure I'm liking Nobu at the moment that much. Defeatist attitude, getting aggressive with Shin, and "Hachi's not that kind of woman"? Not sure how it's his business if she decides to have a fling or not, and I don't like how he pedestalizes women. Shin confirming his position as best male character around alongside Yasu. Lots of wisdom from our sixteen year old. And of course, Nobu subtlety insults him by saying he's the same as Takumi -- not sure I agree with that either, as Shin hasn't been shown to have the same arrogant and disrespectful attitude.

I get the impression that Takumi is pretty much manipulating Hachiko at this point, especially with that music in the background as they talk!

Nana's less pissed than I expected, just sad about possibly losing Hachi.

Nobu chickens out again and just makes some vague comment about Takumi, leaving Hachi confused. Smooth.

WHOA. Reira hiring Shin?! I wonder if that money is for something else, haha, I can't believe it.

For those who missed it, I posted [a spiffy 3D image](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3bdqcj/cgi_scene_in_nana_episode_14_converted_to/) I made from the previous episode.

This episode had me both empathizing with and wanting to throttle Hachi. But that's going to be the whole series I'm guessing.

* Fourth wall breaking, haha. There was more than a little foreshadowing in the 11.5 recap I guess.
* She could totally take Shin to the concert if Nana bails. I get the feeling Nana's going to go though.
* Oh the groupie came to Tokyo? ... and hijinks ensues.
* Awesome first live performance of Rose - **Edit:** The high grain look was a pretty nice touch. Added a grunge feel, and it mimics how actual video footage might look taken in a dark venue.
* [Shiiing!](http://i.imgur.com/KDgOY7x.png) - **Edit:** Looking more and more like Hachi's going to go on a killing spree, thus the sad narrations thinking back on how everything went wrong. I'm going to continue collecting evidence for this hypothesis.
* Hachi's cynical streak had me chuckling at some points.
* Dawww at Nana's hurt expression.
* Hachi talks about wishing she understood her better then during the epilogue narration, but Nana never really opened up to her so far. She shares some of the blame IMO.

I had to go back and make sure I wasn't watching a recap episode as Junko and Shji went and broke the fourth wall at the beginning. Eventually Kyosuke joined in too! That was a weird scene, I don't mind it for the recap episodes but it hadn't been established as a thing before now so it felt out of place.

Hachi, you can't just replace a boyfriend with Nana in basically the same situation. Well, you can try but I don't think she'll appreciate it.

Kinda wish they did more with the concert but I'm happy with what we got. That's the girl that gave Nana her jacket, isn't it? And just like that Hachi's jealous of Misato too.

Nana did *not* have the reaction I was expecting when Hachi yelled at her at the end. Hit a weak point there.
>> ARTICLE
>it hadn't been established as a thing before now so it felt out of place.

Yeah, it definitely caught me off guard as well. Funny though, because in the manga, the characters have more 4th wall breaking thought bubbles (ie "What's with the manga ka and the number 7?"). 

>Nana did not have the reaction I was expecting when Hachi yelled at her at the end. Hit a weak point there.

What do you think was going through Nana's head at that point?
>> ARTICLE
> What do you think was going through Nana's head at that point?

Maybe she *was* feeling selfish and a bit lonely, letting a fan dote on her like that. Hachi had just gone through a big breakup and Nana should still know well how that feels.

Alternatively, Nana could have possibly looked to Hachi for some support with her own life, but she hadn't yet and was staying closed off and maybe felt guilty about that.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's both. Nana feels guilty for essentially ignoring Hachi due to a fan, along with the fear of losing someone who supports and dots on her. 

They are very much alike in that regard; symbiotic to an extent. They both need the other for support, yet show/express it in different ways. 
>> ARTICLE
> That was a weird scene, I don't mind it for the recap episodes but it hadn't been established as a thing before now so it felt out of place.

Until the last line after Shouji left, the wall was shaking, but it could have just been joking among friends. The last line pushed it a little too far though, and the wall came tumbling down.

**Episode 15:**

Haha Shoji too ashamed. Good for him. 

Please disappear Shoji.

"I won't fall in love again" yeah sure buddy

Damn NANA...she always wears the most badass outfits.

Same song again :o 

I always liked Misato, she seems like she'd be a really great friend. 

Why is Hachi getting so jealous...she gets too attached. 

Hachi's life isn't that bad, yeah she has a bad job but atleast she gets paid. She also lives in a world-class city with affordable rent. 

And of course Sachiko is there...

Don't do this Hachi, what the fuck. Must be one of those moments when you think about stuff you previously done and cringe. Future Hachi must be thinking like this...

I really like this episode as it enforces how Hachi really only thinks about herself, and relies on those wanting her. Perfect example being Nana having someone else she believes can easily replace Hachi, thus her being sad and jealous.

Man, right out of the gate.  "Back in those days, I didn't really know how to love someone.  But I wanted so much to be loved."  Brutal truth from a future self.

"The way I see it, you don't wanna apologize to Nana 'cuz you care about her.  You wanna apologize 'cuz you think it'll make you feel better."  Man, Kyousuke.  It must be nice to know better than everyone else, huh, buddy?  Crimony, let the guy give closure and be done with it, willya?

"Go easy on the women, tell it like it is to the men."  Seems Kyosuke and Jun have mirror attitudes about this.

Hah, Shoji going above and beyond for Sachiko.  Guilt imparts eagerness sometimes.

Man.  This show has no compunction at all about joking about suicide!

Hm, Kyosuke's car is left-hand-drive.  Odd.

Ahhhhaha, Jun's a farm girl!

Never falling in love again, eh, Nana K?  Yeah, right!

Wait, what?  Blast is short for Black Stones?  (Then who's the Black Mick Jagger, hue hue?)

Heyyy, Goldilocks is back!  Cute how Nana K talking with her pretty much single-handedly convinced the whole venue to un-abandon them.  A little too intense, though  weeping when the first song starts?  Easy there, girlie!

And now Nana O has a weird knee-connecting strap.  Was this an actual fashion at that time in Japan?

Nana K with the sudden jealousy over Nana O.  What is up with you?  This isn't going to turn into _Single White Female_, is it?

Hahahhahaha!  Nana K going into detail about hot girl-on-girl action.  You are a treasure sometimes, Nana.  And then "I gotta get laid!", haha.  Hey, you have fingers, you know!

Dang.  Didn't take much of a push-back from Nana K to send Nana O into a cower.

Alright. Missed the last episode yesterday, made it up today.

Phew. Now we get to a turn point arc, with what looks like some big things about to go down. BLAST is being hushed away by Gaia, Trapnest is flying overseas, and Hachi is... well, alone for the most part.

Really, really loved Yasu being the one coming to the rescue, and loosing his cool over people harassing Nana. Every time a woman he cares for is involved, his stoic persona melts away in an instant. Great punch, too. Nice of them to threaten his job, for standing up to them.

Wonderful of Nana to call out to Hachi with all the cameras turned on her. Probably the best way to get a semblance of her feelings across.

Nana being all angry at Yasu for standing up for her, but you know she loves him for it. :)

Poor Naoki, beginning the running gag of wanting to be a stand out character, when he's always sidelined.

Biggest thing in this episode is Takumi, weirdly. Honestly one of the most notorious in this show, as most would agree. Not only did he shout down Hachi, sideline her feelings over his own work, but there was a depressingly bright insight into his past/something that shaped him. Stating that having a father being there meant nothing when they treated you like nothing. Something that may have helped contribute turning him into the person he is now. Saddening, honestly, although that doesn't excuse his actions towards Hachi.

Still trying to figure out if she was telling Jun-chan that she loves Takumi, or herself, and easily blaming it on always falling for the worst person while those they actually love her are always sidelined.

See, that's what you get for being so tech-deprived, Nana O.  (There always has to be stuff like this in stories nowadays; if everyone were conscientious about maintaining a cell phone, many kinds of conflicts are almost impossible to write plausibly.)

I like the detail of Shouji's fancy Mac on the table in the background.  Looks like there's a flatbed scanner next to it, too.

Oh, Takumi coming to meet the family Sunday.  I guess that's off after the events of this episode

[Look how incredibly taller Takumi is than Nana K.  Has that always been so, or is this shot just drawn a little off?](http://i.imgur.com/dAf1Oom.jpg)

Takumi's been worried all along about Ren and Nana O being found out.  Bet he'd blow a gasket (more than usual, I mean) if he knew what has been happening all along with Reira and Shin  the media circus when that's inevitably brought to light should make the Ren/Nana O thing look like a walk in the park.  And now Takumi calls the marriage into question again, again based on the idea of the kid being messed up because the parent is messed up, with himself as proof.  Well, Nana K should be proof as well that even having two good, stable parents is no guarantee either.  In a way, I guess Ren (and even Shin, kinda, despite his feelings about it) would be proof that the kid can also turn out ok even given shitty (or no) parents.

Now Nana K is claiming she's truly in love with Takumi, and not just doing it for the baby.  Jun seems to accept it, too.  I dunno, I don't see the evidence.  But she knows (all too well, it seems) that she would have been much better off with Nobu, or Shouji before him.  Yeah, Nana K, just what is your damage, anyway?

Man, the gossip industry in Japan is intense.  Live breaking coverage on the scene, by multiple outlets?

Nobu's ability to trust is eroded.  So much that he's not thinking straight.  Why would Kawano come over to whisk you guys to privacy if he orchestrated this as a publicity stunt?

Yasu being a badass.  :3

This flower-sprouting-from-your-head thing is a standard symbol of something, isn't it.  I know I've seen it before

Nana O being badass.  Nana K being happy, and Jun laughing her ass off.  :3

Well, all hell is breaking loose, to be sure.  So I guess we're gonna get to see some Trapnest shenanigans in England?  I just watched the _K-On!_ movie as part of /r/awwnime's rewatch the other day, so that should be a fun contrast

**Episode 39**

Would you guys say Nana is a romance or drama first?

The You got a chance now bit is always so fun :)

Nana's family is always interesting haha

Takumi yelling at Nana...just when they were looking like they could maybe work out...

Oh so she does love Takumi over Nobu?

I'm at my limit with Nana's crying voice...never had that ear pain from someones voice but it's finally happened

More reasons why the Nanas can't meet up

Yasu being Yasu <3

Wow what a punch! Really thought he would have lawyered them or something ha

Didn't like how he punched the guy as in he could lose his job but seeing it more as in he's commited to the band is a nice resgnation ;)

Ren's a smart guy. Like seeing this side of him actually

NANA being great on TV too

Things are looking good again!!!^^^ForNow

I'd say a drama first.  It definitely overrides the romance when it wants to.

Romance-drama, as a lot of the drama stems from the romance angle. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess I see it more like I see Gekkan Shoujo, it uses romantic situations to springboard it's comedy so I consider it a comedy firstly

I think it uses comedic elements to break up the serious drama that occurs during the scenes. 

They usually come up after something serious has happened/is being discussed. :P

Looked like the moon is starting to set at the end of the OP. Not sure if that was happening before, was always there, or I'm just seeing things.

We get basically every character but Sachiko and Sakagami in this one, all reacting to the news. Junko and Kyosuke are looking out for Hachi, who just wants to make amends with Nana (sort of an inversion of last episode).

I still don't know what Takumi's thinking about Hachi. Trying to protect the band and his image, I guess? Hachi could easily make that blow up in his face but would probably wreck her own life in the process. She loves him though so that won't happen... I think. She's more of a force of nature than Nana is when it comes to men, unpredictable and capable of lots of destruction.

Yasu is *pissed* and doing exactly what us viewers want all of them to do (I imagine) by punching the guy in front of Nana's door. I didn't expect Nana to be the patient one this time, but it's a good balance with Yasu. As she said, she knows Ren and vice-versa so they don't need to say anything to each other right now.

[Naoki and Reira are adorable.](http://i.imgur.com/3juGc4r.png) and [I love her attitude](http://i.imgur.com/93QfZFG.png) when she's thinking of Shin. Takumi still has some power [over her heart](http://i.imgur.com/JidnYu0.png) though.

I love [Nana's statement at the end.](http://i.imgur.com/0pX4pHE.png) If Hachi wrote a love letter to Nana, this is her declaration of love right back.

Takumi was right about Hachi getting involved and even her friends told her the same thing.

Dude is still a dick though, but apparently he comes from a messed up family.

Last episode was the the windup, this one's the pitch. Gotta see if the next one will be a hit or a miss.

* Huh, only 3 performances in Tokyo, and already headlining.
* Haha, those two youngins probably a big influence on the scout there. Junko helps people out even unconsciously.
* Nana may or may not be right about the guy not knowing Rock or Punk, but anyone could read that crowd.
* Reira's up to something... Oh snap, Shin's getting a message.

Nana is continuously touched by Hachi's kindness. Meanwhile Hachi is so desperate for affection, she seeks out Takumi. The two Nanas really need to learn how to communicate with each other.

Very curious if the four will run into each other in the morning- I think Reira may have that in mind.
>> ARTICLE
Another concert! And wow, they're really popular now. I've always thought it's a bit strange to be the roommate of someone incredibly popular like that; like Hachi I need to remember that they're people like everyone else. Junko and Kyosuke are the best, again, letting those two girls in instead. They kinda feel like a cameo from somewhere else but nothing I remember seeing.

[Yes, Shin, sushi.](http://i.imgur.com/TRwCSWm.png) It's easy to forget he's a teenager sometimes.

The rest of the episode is one "ugh" moment after another though. Hachi's feeling abandoned even though Nana really does care for her as more than just another follower of the band. Nana just isn't the kind of person to really tell her that, though.

Takumi's calling to make sure Hachi's new roommate is a girl? He's an ass for thinking he has any say in that. And that's literally the only thing he talked to her about. Hachi's desperate though. Not the first time she's fled to Takumi and I'd be surprised if it's the last.

I'm starting to like Reira more, she's funny. She got the idea from Takumi to rope in Shin and it worked! He was a lot more eager to go see her than I was expecting. Maybe they aren't going to be horrible for each other like I first thought, and [their scene in the bath at the end was really cute.](http://i.imgur.com/Z7V5C6R.png)

Unfortunately for Hachi, Nobu's understandably done trying to chase her. Or at least he says he is, sometimes it's hard to actually let go. We'll see if he holds up there. Kinda funny that Nana's not done encouraging him though.

I think Nana has a good idea of how Hachi's feeling by the end, but I also wonder if she can actually do anything about it.
>> ARTICLE
> I think Nana has a good idea of how Hachi's feeling by the end, but I also wonder if she can actually do anything about it.

I don't think she can. Like Nana, she has a hard time properly communicating your true feelings and thoughts, because she'll either lose the person, or doesn't want to impose on their emotions. Two scared girls wanting to stay together.

Yep, looks like them.
>> ARTICLE
Man.  Only their third public show and packin' 'em in from all four corners.  Talk about a meteoric start!

Also, girls, don't take a *plane* somewhere just *hoping* to be able to buy tickets for the thing you're flying there for when you arrive.  Planning!  (But maybe planning ain't punk.)  Also, I can see Nana O is a style-setter.

Dude.  That looks fuckin' *dangerous*.  Even the stairs are packed full.  This place is ripe to be shut down by the fire department.

"I didn't think people in Tokyo could *be* that nice!"  What kind of a reputation does Tokyo have in Japan, anyway?  Are they seen as the Rude New Yorkers of the country?

Nana O walks out on stage like she owns the place.  And she does, pretty much.  *That's right, rock star, comin' through, bitches.*

The dub voice casting/acting on the record-label guy is spot-on.  I can just hear him saying "Ya got *moxie*, kid.  Sign with me an' we'll set da *world* on fire."  Then he takes a puff of a cigar.  I would be a little afraid he'll have Blast enslaved, but then again Yasu's on their side.

Huh, Jun and Kyousuke are in an exhibition.  Good that their lives are shown to be moving along and not just forgotten.  I half-expected Nana K to be all excited about it, but it just depressed her.  Poor thing.  What happened to her school plans, anyway?  Just abandoned?

And the "left behind" vibes pile up for Nana K.  You shoulda taken up that tambourine-player position while you had the chance!

Look at Nobu.  Pushing his feelings down.  :(

Haha, guess they didn't plan any security for the stage door.  Nana O seems to take to the fan adoration like a duck to water.  Shin, on the other hand, looks a little shell shocked.  Yasu, as always, is completely unperturbed.  And Nobu he looks as normal as anything.  Wonder what he's thinking.  Maybe about drowning his Nana-K-related sorrows in a little fangirl indulgence.  Or maybe about how that's what Takumi would do.

Everyone always seems so impressed with Nana K's cooking.  Maybe she should look into being a chef.

Nana K at least tries to use Misato as an excuse not to see Takumi, as I'd wondered about last time.  But the (lack of) wording in her message draws a somewhat testy call-back from Takumi.  I thought he was going to be the uncaring philanderer type, but this looks more like the possessive, jealous boyfriend type.  For just an instant, it looks like Reira picks up on the vibe.  And then Nana K totally caves to her own feelings of loneliness.  That satisfied expression on Takumi's face makes me a little ill.

What's going on with Reira that she was going to be driven somewhere else?  And then she play-acts to get a room at the same hotel instead?  I'm not following.

You're going to pay for your own cab fare, Nana K?  If you're going to be involved with Takumi, at least make the big rock star pay for that much!

Pretty funny/scary to see Shin and Nana O thinking of Bigshot J. Recordexec as some lax newbie.  You better nip that in the bud or he'll eat you alive.

Nana O manages to simultaneously tease Nobu and 'ship him with Nana K, with a simple quip about growing his hair long.  That's a talent.

"Hi hi hi hi hi~!"  Heheh, for some reason I just love Misato's squeaky-breaky (dub) voice when she gets excited.  By the way, that's a hell of a sleeping outfit she has there.  It's like I'm watching _Little House On The Prairie_ again.

Ah, the truth comes out.  And Nana O probably feels like she drove Nana K right back into Takumi's arms.  Inadvertently, I guess she did.

My my~, Misato!  What kind of "love" for Nana O (from both you and Nana K) are you talking about here?

I guess I didn't notice before now that the Nanas had no microwave oven.  How can anyone live without one?  (I remember the dark days before those were a thing)

The leftovers.  Silently twisting that knife of guilt into Nana O.  Even a cute cake with "Black Stones" on it.  Ouuuch.

Ok, wait.  That *is* Reira with Shin this time, right?  (I feel gun-shy after my confusion yesterday)

Geez, *so much* seems to happen in each of these episodes!

> Dude. That looks fuckin' dangerous.

I forgot to mention that. Yes, yes it does. Especially after recently watching a thing about [The Station nightclub fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Station_nightclub_fire). (Don't look up the video unless you're prepared for a major downer)

> What kind of a reputation does Tokyo have in Japan, anyway? Are they seen as the Rude New Yorkers of the country?

Not rude so much as cold/disinterested. Amusingly, Junko isn't from Tokyo, so...

> Ok, wait. That is Reira with Shin this time, right? (I feel gun-shy after my confusion yesterday)

Haha, don't worry, Ryouko's out of the country right now. ;)

**Episode 26**

Boy am I happy to see Blast doing quite well. Everything is going right for them.

Misato coming back adds a happy dynamic to Hachi's life. Now it's not that depressing and pathetic.

Takumi only responded when he had a reason to be jealous. There's still some motivations that aren't clear from him but I still think he's by far a negative entity in this show.

Hurts to see Hachi's food get uneaten, but damn she goes so hard when she wants to make something...

Just want to say that probably around episode 8 I couldn't help it and started to binge. But I stopped around episode 44 because I loved the story (as much as I got frustrated with some actions some characters took), but realized the story would be nowhere near completion by its "conclusion." I haven't been able to continue because of that fact. It's heartbreaking. I want to know what happens but knowing I will never know is frustrating.

Love the comparative reactions to the live performance between Misato and Jun-chan.


Really nice seeing their popularity, and Jun-chan giving up their 'seats.'


Ladies fighting over Yasu, as they should be.

Shin acting professional, and it's all for sushi.

:( Poor Nana. Everyone else is moving forward and she feels left behind, forgotten, and she's falling into some dark thoughts. being lonely takes you down some bad decisions. 

Reina stole Shin from Hachi as well. :(

Misato has some adorable sleepwear.

Hachi thinks Nana is leaving her, Nana thinks Hachi is leaving her.

Nana just realized she pulled a Takumi when she opened the fridge. Opps.

I really like the voice over at the end of each episode. It really emphasis what happened in the episode, plus a little foreshadowing.

Huh.  In retrospect, that opening bit by Nana O about abandonment by both Ren and her mom seems obvious, but I never made the connection till now.  Also explains a lot of her somewhat prickly attitude towards Ren.  In other news, she was 16 and already with Ren??  How long were they together before he went to Tokyo, anyway?

Nana O thinks she was too harsh on Nobu, but by my recollection, the things he said to her were much more of a splash in the face.

Nana "changes for work", but it looks hardly any different to me, hah.

Those "cute little strawberries" glasses.  Seems so long ago now.

"What's with her?  It's like she's his lapdog."  Instead of yours, you mean?  Someone sounds jealous.

Uh, wow.  Takumi.  Easy, man.  I don't blame you for being angry, but *this* is more than weird.

Yep, Nana O's acting like Nobu might have been expected to.  Jilted boyfriend type thoughts.  And the cute little strawberry glasses are more of a symbol than i thought.  Took kind of a dark turn there, too.  "Good.  Now they're together."  This isn't going to turn into a murder-suicide ending, is it?

Jesus Christ.  Takumi, master of tact as always.  *Oh, uh, I almost forgot:  I'm getting married, so yeah*

Holy shit.  [No topic is out of bounds for the comedy in this show!](http://i.imgur.com/V8eYukC.jpg)

Ahh, the Layla/Reira thing.  Neat.  But, uh, WOW.  Fifty-five hundred yen for a damn CD?!?  Is that pricing accurate??

Poor Reira seems pretty torn up about Takumi.  Guess she's been carrying a torch for him the whole time.  But now *she's* going to run to Yasu too??  Poor guy's like everyone's janitor, mopping up after their messes.

Oh jeez.  The cheese has slipped of Nana O's cracker.  And now Nana K thinks Nana O hates her, I bet.  In a way, maybe she's right.  We barely get any time to see what's going on in Nobu's head, either.  Even so, he still manages to cover for and worry about Nana O.  Guy deserves better, I tells ya.

**Episode 34:**

NANA regretting that she yelled at Nobu. Makes sense. Nobu did nothing wrong, in fact he did everything right...Nobu can win in love but he can't win with his bad luck...

Takumi making it difficult for NANA, even when it comes with Ren...

Traitor. 

I take it the glass scene means exactly this: NANA and Hachi's friendship will be forever broken and it'll leave a scar on NANA wherever she goes.

Ugh that's gotta hurt Shin. But it's not what you think it means!

I think Takumi and NANA are very similar. They both want control, they both want Hachi and they both lose control when mad. 

----

>> ARTICLE
I am really liking the Nana voiceover this time around. Such a nice contrast to Hachi's, same tone as each other, plus Nana's voice sounds so melancholy with the VA work. 

So... Yasu... yeah, Nana. He's the only person you can really talk to, as you don't see him as someone who's betrayed you or upset you personally.

Going to gloss over Takumi 'taking what's his,' as that is so damn wrong and is the perfect example of why I dislike him so damn much.

Both glasses broke into the shape of a broken heart. symbolism *within* symbolism. Interesting that the negative emotions hit such a critical point that Nana effectively 'switched off.' Kind of like to think she went back to Yasu's, and he was awesome enough to drop her off at Ren's place. :)

Takumi with the line "grow to love someone." Welp, there you have their relationship in a nutshell. Neither love each other, but kinda like a certain aspect of their respective personalities, so marriage is cool, right? Cannot wait for Nami and Takumi to meet. 

Reina looses the plot. The feelings she's had to Takumi come to a head, and he's know it, but will never acknowledge it. Feel bad for Shin, as he's finally opening his feelings up to someone, and sadly he's third on her list of feelings.

Yasu to the rescue, again. Get another glimpse of him slipping from his cool demeanor. Had to stop at the steps, take a breath and light a cigarette before gaining his composure and letting Reina see him. There's a weird aesthetic aloofness he likes to put on, but you can tell he really, really cares about people. Might be old feelings die hard in regards to Reina, or attraction to Nana, but I think he genuinely cares about the people he's close to. I mean, he moved to Tokyo just for Nana, is always there for her, kept in contact with Ren the entire time he was gone (and challenged him about Nana to get his feelings back on track), and ran all the way to see Reina.

He's a white knight in shades, black suit, bald and smoking.

**"You know, Hachi... I was too small of a person to accept everything about you. I was like a cheap glass. It was just that I preferred the pain of breaking into pieces, to the loneliness I felt from losing everything.**

**I was just too fragile. It's not your fault."**

Two broken glasses, two broken Nana's, two broken singers and two people to pick up the pieces. 

The easiest cause to point at today is also the easiest character to hate. In contrast to previous episodes, Takumi does not come off well here, no matter how you spin it. Everything he does the moment Nana enters the apartment is a deliberate push to drive a wedge between Nana and Hachi. 

This is maybe the definitive moment as to why I cannot like Takumi as a person despite how interesting a character he is. Because through all of his pragmatic resolve, redeemable moments and obvious intelligence and capability, there is still a callous, proud man. 

He simply does not hesitate to do anything he deems beneficial to him to people he doesn't care about. It doesn't make a difference if you're someone he hates or is simply indifferent about, if he doesn't need you or does not care for you, you are at risk. 

But as I said, it's easy to point to the guy who instigates sex with a pregnant woman with her best friend aware of it next door... yeah, it was even more repulsive than it sounds. Nonetheless, Hachi and Nana just let it happen. Again, they're not speaking up to each other. Nana fails her resolve and even leaves doing effectively the opposite of what she came for. Hachi, whether through fear, stupidity, cowardice or other emotions, doesn't even open her mouth to Nana. For all the stupidity before, this is the moment where I hate her most. The opportunity to do something is right in front of her, but she's been mentally pummelled into silence by everything the past few days. She's weak and she thinks she has to pay a horrible price at the end of today's episode. 

Takumi's actions also have some unexpected fallout elsewhere. Layla loves him and she can't deal with definitively losing him. Shin's immaturity comes to bite him in the ass when the woman he has come to love seeks solace not with him, but with Yasu. 

It's not really his fault, since Yasu is just a way more stable, adult and reassuring presence than him, but it still stings. I can't say I'm that sorry though, it was a long time coming that he would get hurt and not undeservedly. 

As a final note, the two glasses are a simply beautiful metaphor for the relationship between the two Nana's. It's a bond forged through being similarly fragile and broken, but together their pieces match up to become whole. 

[This image](http://imgur.com/A8QQKIM) to me is the definitive image of Nana.

> instigates sex with a pregnant woman with her best friend aware of it next door... yeah, it was even more repulsive than it sounds

Well neither of those things is really what does anything to me in that scene  sex with a pregnant woman is perfectly ok, and studies have even shown it to be beneficial; and he could plausibly convince himself Nana O couldn't hear anyway.  No, what gets me is that he's explicitly doing it in anger, telling her to just shut up and service him.  How he can even be horny in that situation is somewhat disturbing.

>Shin [] would get hurt and not undeservedly.

Eh?  What has he done to deserve being hurt?
>> ARTICLE
Completely agree on Takumi's actions. It's his attitude while instigating it that reveals a very ugly possessive, even oppressive side to him. 

> Eh? What has he done to deserve being hurt?

Let's face it: he has been whoring himself out to women on a regular basis and had been acting like he had the world figured out already. Emotionally he was more of a child than Hachi, yet he lacked any manner of self reflection on his actions. 

One could even argue that he has likely played with the emotions of his female 'clients', which would hurt them in a similar manner as Layla has hurt him now. We don't know for sure, but it doesn't sound far-fetched at all. 

So maybe deserved isn't the right word. But it was a long time coming that he would get knocked down a peg and in his case it is a good thing: it will humble him and hopefully make him grow as a person. At the very least, it should make him more aware of people's emotions.

>> ARTICLE
* Takumi *had been* kind of doing the right thing but he's still a dick about all of it. Has he even asked Hachi what she thinks about any of this? Everything he said in the bedroom with Hachi is just ew.
* Hachi's broken. [And now so is Nana.](http://i.imgur.com/Ct5z1lW.png)
* Reira's real name *is* Layla! And I wanted to start calling her that a while ago.
* Reira took the news about Takumi hard. Yasu is not the person I wanted her to go see though, and Shin is even complicit in reuniting them.
* Basically: sucks to be a member of BLAST right now. Unless you're Yasu, in which case everyone else is coming to you with their problems.

I don't want to cause a shit storm like /u/AmethystItalian so I waited for the thread to calm down before posting but this is becoming hard to watch.

The first half of the show was good. The SoL element of the show was fun and I liked most of the characters. However the second half so far hasn't been enjoyable.

Sure it might be realistic compared to a bland MC with a harem of cute girls drooling over him but it just feels like I'm watching a bad soap opera. This is a term I hate to use but the drama feels so 'forced'.
>> ARTICLE
Similar feelings. I still enjoy the fact the SoL/comedy pops up here and there, but I'm just not much of a drama guy, I guess. I still think it's better executed than some of the other stuff I've seen though, like Kokoro Connect which was just horribly forced and repetitive.


>> ARTICLE
Both of you can say whatever you like about the show. :) I don't mind at all if someone doesn't like the show, and where it heads down, as we all have different tastes in regard to entertainment. 

Only thing I will say is that this down isn't on the bright, happy side, and yes it's been going down a darker tone, but it's been going down that path pretty much since the start. 

I hope the show becomes a lot more enjoyable for you though. :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you don't wanna do what I did haha that was not fun.

I agree on the bad soap department.
>> ARTICLE
> However the second half so far hasn't been enjoyable.

Not a knock on you by any means, but I wonder what your expectations were beforehand if you feel this right now?

It isn't supposed to be enjoyable in the traditional sense. The show isn't all happy, there are lows that are actually lows, not just temporary setbacks in the grand scheme that we know will come to fruition anyway. It's a romance drama, the indication was there beforehand.

> This is a term I hate to use but the drama feels so 'forced'.

Mind elaborating? Most of the resulting drama flows pretty naturally from the characters' actions and personalities. Overwrought I can get, but forced not so much. 
>> ARTICLE
 I didn't know anything about the series beforehand so I didn't really have any expectations going into it. The way the show started was what moulded my expectations for it so the sudden (at least it felt sudden to me) tone change has thrown me off a bit. I'm not criticising that, pregnancy is a sudden thing.

I shouldn't have used the word forced but it's too overblown for me. Maybe I'm just too young to relate to the mature drama. 

>> ARTICLE
What I'm not understanding is that there was literally no tone change.

It's always been this from the start. The only thing that's been happening is the quicker pace. Things are escalating much faster than before. 
>> ARTICLE
Really? Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention then lol. Apart from the Sachiko fiasco the first half definitely felt like more of a light hearted comedy/slice of life show to me.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe to say the drama was less "serious", but it certainly wasn't light hearted lol. IMO at least. 
>> ARTICLE
Well less serious to more serious is still a tone change :P
>> ARTICLE
No, the tone is still *serious*.

Also you're going to have to elaborate on the "forced" drama aspect. It's too vague. It's always used as a blanket term to describe any drama that people do not like.

Everything is forced.

Everything in NANA has been foreshadowed. Not much has been randomly pulled on you. From the monologues, to the character lines. A lot of the drama has been planned from a long time.

At first I didn't think Takumi was that bad, and thought he was getting some undeserved flak... But that was pretty rapey, yo
>> ARTICLE
> But that was pretty rapey, yo

But think of his feelings !!!

He needs control so badly that he almost forces her to have sex with him.
God that scene made me feel so uncomfortable and it's my 2nd time watching it.

Nana sees Reira's affinity for Takumi and suspects an affair.  It's odd, but after all this time I've begun to question why Takumi has this womanizing reputation in the first place.  He doesn't actually seem to be all that interested in lots of girls.  Is it just his own PR coming back to bite him?

Jeez, Nana K's gotten pretty blas about Takumi.  Familiarity breeds contempt, they say.  When that seeps into a marriage, it's probably bad news.  (And, hell, they aren't even technically married yet)

Kind of funny to see Jun so taken aback time and again at what Nana K says these days.

Hah, wow.  So porn star Yuri really is after Nobu, big-time.

Nana O getting all seethingly anti-normalcy.  Smash the machine, girl!  Punk forever!  Woooo!  Just don't pull a Kurt Cobain on us, huh?

Kindergartner Nana O so cuuuuute!

Why was everyone so shocked at Nobu's cell phone disdain?  Just not used to hearing him sound bitter?

Interesting that Nana K sees an analogy that goes *Shouji : Nana K :: Nana K : Nobu*.  She fears that she'll only be serving herself to put closure on what she had with Nobu; but she should really ask herself:  would she feel bad were Shouji to do the same for her?

Man.  Jackson Hole, Jun and Kyousuke, Shouji and Sachiko.  The gang's all here and the sense of nostalgia is about to knock me over.  (Sachiko even gets some lines, yay!)

Well, hell.  Now I'm all hyped up for this reunion back in room 707.  You know that means either it's not going to happen or everything will go horribly wrong.

By that same token, I have kind of a bad feeling about where this Nana O/Ren marriage thread is going.  Can't put my finger on why.

Earlier I wouldn't have been surprised if that's exactly what happened by the end of the series, but at this point it's unlikely.

> You know that means either it's not going to happen or everything will go horribly wrong.

I'm... not sure. I want to think everyone just meets up and realizes that they have to move on and go about their own lives. Nana K will never be entirely separated from the band (simply because of all of the relationships between BLAST and Trapnest) but she won't be embedded in it like she had been earlier.
>> ARTICLE
>  You know that means either it's not going to happen or everything will go horribly wrong.

Haha accurate I'm still hoping for something happy though.

Nice indication as to how Nana is falling into absolute need for Ren.

It's really interesting when you put the two most important people in front of Nana: Ren is this all consuming, and incredibly destructive love that both easily get swept up in. Honestly, it's the greatest unhealthy realtionship in this show, I am am comparing it to the distant, emotionless Takumi, and underage sex worker Shin and Reira. This is a dramatic version of Sid and Nancy, where they'll burn each other out.

Then you have Hachi, who is also consuming for Nana, but in a more positive, supporting light. Eventhough there is this misunderstanding between the two of them, and it'll affecting their standing to one-another, Hachi is this supreme supportive love in Nana's life, and it's continuing to become clear that she desperately needs her.

Ren is a drowning sea Nana easily gets swept under, and Hachi is a life vest keeping her afloat and safe.

I'm just really happy Ginpei is there, fawning over the boys and being a supportive staff member that is there for them all. 

This is possibly the best Hachi episode, because we're shown a great deal of growth and maturity besides her usual air-headedness. Stating that she doesn't want Nana to look after her like some lover, but to have an unconditional friendship where Nana and Hachi can speak from the heart to one-another and be supportive in any way.

Yuri and Miu, polar opposites in personality, and budding relationships between Nobu. Nobu you chose poorly again.

Nana's light keeps growing darker and darker, forcing her to cling to Ren in some desperate way. Even accepting the marriage proposal was timid.

Hachi out-maneuvered Jun-chan so easily in this episode. The usual cool answering, level-headed friend could not come up with any response to a very, very real problem. You don't want someone to hate you, but is talking to them actually going to help ease that pain, or just ultimately make you feel better? She had nothing to say to that.

Yuri laying it on thick, but as soon as something personal pops up in Nobu's life, Hachi comes in like a wrecking ball, and the whole band goes crazy. Mother, friend, roommate, lover. She's ingrained in this band.

Miu and Yasu, that was cute.

I think Nana has a lot of wishful thinking that meeting up once in the old apartment is going to immediately repair the wound they've both suffered.

Well, there you have, they share a name, and now the exact same engagement ring. :)
>> ARTICLE
> This is possibly the best Hachi episode, because we're shown a great deal of growth and maturity besides her usual air-headness.

I didn't even think about that, I've forgotten about the old endlessly bouncy Hachi from the first half of the show. She's changed a lot in the last couple of months.

> Hachi comes in like a wrecking ball, and the whole band goes crazy.

An apt comparison, considering she could probably tear BLAST apart if she was so inclined. It's not in her to do so though, instead she's a buoyant force for them ^(aside from Nobu.)
>> ARTICLE
>I didn't even think about that....

It's really interesting that Hachi is evolving this subtle maturity in response to the situation she keeps finding herself in.

>An apt comparison... 

You know, I didn't even think about it till now but in regard to the power dynamics in the band, Hachi holds a lot of sway. Besides Yasu, she is actually the emotional connectiobs between the band members, and can easily impact their emotional state. 
>> ARTICLE
The title cards really do get pretty abstract, this one was hard to make out for 45.

* Haha, the three of them pissed off at Takumi's closeness to Reira; reacting in the same way but probably for different reasons.
* The "Hachi", "Nana" countdown was pretty smooth.
* Interesting conversation with Yuri and Miu
* lol, Yuri's jab at Miu.
* [Dawww.](http://i.imgur.com/2oV5nOL.jpg)
* Junko doesn't have the answers this time. She looked blindsided.
* Woooooo Sachiko gets a line!
* Wooo Another line!
* Another!
* 4, 4 lines! Ha. Ha. Ha.
* Haha- Nobu's getting his own harem.

Another new ending song, not sure what to say though. So much set up for the next episode, let's see where it leads.

Yep, this one took me a minute to figure out.

> So much set up for the next episode, let's see where it leads.

Hachi breaks up with Takumi and marries Nobu instead, Nana ditches Ren and finally goes out with Yasu, Shin and Reira have their happy ending, and everything is rainbows and puppies forever?

Actually I don't want that, it would just feel forced for Nobu at this point. Not sure about Ren/Nana/Yasu now. At least Shin and Reira have something nice going for them?

---
You really do pick up speech patterns from those you're close to, but I kinda feel like Nana was projecting a bit at the end when she heard Hachi in Nobu. Even at the beginning of the episode she's suspecting Takumi of cheating with Reira.

Hachi feels lonely as Nana isn't relying on her anymore... give it a few more months and she'll have someone that won't be able to live without her constant supervision. Still, they're drifting apart even more. How many episodes has it been since they've talked to each other face-to-face?

[Aww, Miu and Yuri are competing for Nobu,](http://i.imgur.com/R0eA0o5.png) even if Miu doesn't realize it yet. I was hoping she would change her mind.

I'm a little sad that there was no drama whatsoever on the show itself. But that's what happens when the band gets controlled by an agency and wants to make it big. And now Nana's considering marrying Ren even if she was about to break up with him, for the same kinds of reasons. You can't just do whatever you want in life and be successful, that's one of the overarching themes of the series and now we see Nana coming to terms with that just as Hachi did. [D'aww, kid Nana.](http://i.imgur.com/FYz8NY0.png)

Shji and Sachiko briefly return along with Jackson Hole, setting up the end of the series in the next couple of episodes. How many people can Hachi get closure with in ~40 minutes?

More mahjong but without quite the same level of energy and cheerfulness as when they were in 707. At least Nobu's a lot more cheerful than I've seen him in a while... and then the specter of Hachi returns with the invitation to the fireworks that had been canceled what feels like so long ago.

I like the strawberry glass going in reverse, Nana's attempt to rewrite their lives. However, unlike another certain romance series (you know the one) that level of bullshit will not work here.

As much as I love their new song I wish they would play their old one sometimes too!!

Looks like Ren and NANA are doing better

I also want Nobu to just find someone...

But not this AV girl haha

Yasu moving in on Yuri too haha

Well hopefully it all works out and they can all meet up :)

**"Hey Hachi. Who could have imagined in their wildest dreams, that the day would come where you and I, with completely different tastes, would each be wearing a matching set of treasures? I know you're fickle and crave new things. But I hope you still treasure it even now. That generic looking ring from a high-end jewelry store."**

So many recurring things today, yet there is hardly anything conclusive to say about them. Everything is still hanging in the balance and that makes it that much sadder that we're really nearing the end. 

There is one particular relationship I want to highlight because it's still shrouded in doubt. The relationship between Takumi and Layla remains a mystery hardly anyone can unravel at this point. We know nothing about Takumi's inner thoughts ever and Layla's progressing relationship with Shin may or may not have impacted her love for Takumi.

Which makes Ren's assured demeanor when rejecting the notion of romantic involvement between the two curious to say the least. If we believe him (I do, for one), then that raises even more questions. Or maybe just one: why not? Takumi has shown he has an impulsive streak and a crazy libido, Layla clearly loved or even still loves him deeply... why is he keeping her out? 

Apart from that there's Nana being conflicted. What's new? She seamlessly cycles between frustrated, resigned and defiant, fighting her inner demons heavily at every turn. You get the feeling that at this point a spark is all that is needed to set her ablaze, though it seems well-needed and deserved stability is within reach, with Ren and Hachi not as unavailable as previously thought. 

Lots of other stuff, but nothing too definite that it should be addressed, though one can guess that both Nobu and today's Shoji-surprise will spell drama for Hachi. 
>> ARTICLE
> The relationship between Takumi and Layla remains a mystery hardly anyone can unravel at this point. We know nothing about Takumi's inner thoughts ever

I pretty much took him at his word when he privately told Ren he just isn't interested in her that way.  He had no real reason to lie about it.
>> ARTICLE
Did he? He has the image and the future of the band depending on him and he is really, really aware of the fact that its success is critically dependent on Layla. 

That's just the obvious part. I still have the feeling that there is more to it than just not being interested. 
>> ARTICLE
But what possible reason would he have to lie *to Ren* about it?
>> ARTICLE
Ren is pretty close to Layla, hence part of the reason Nana was jealous and wary of her. 

Basically, who is to say anything he says isn't passed on to Layla? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm done with baseball analogies. I've never even watched a game. On a completely unrelated note, I had a dream recently where Hachi was on the run from the law for illegal use of demonic magic.

* Oh good, they didn't forget to get the booze. For a minor.
* Yeah, I saw Shin's age being a problem for going pro. Didn't foresee Yasu coming to the rescue though.
* Whoa.
* But is it really over in Takumi's mind?

Anyway, just "Whoa."
>> ARTICLE
> But is it really over in Takumi's mind

Probably not :(
>> ARTICLE
Nana sure is worrying a lot about what Nobu will think of her, considering he already knows everything.  Or does she not know that?

Poor Misato, still asking if Nana K has a boyfriend.  And no one seems to be in any hurry to clear things up for her.

Shin seems awfully sensitive about his parental situation, given the others' statuses in that regard.  Easy, kid, you're among peers.

Interesting slip of the tongue from Misato:  "Are you [, Yasyu,] all right with tha I mean, is Nobu all right with that?"  I thought for a second Yasu's "personal question" for her was going to be "do you have a boyfriend?", but this is also interesting.  An alias, what for?  Don't tell me she turns out to be a crazy stalker after all?

Nobu suddenly has such a knack for saying the right thing at every turn.  But Nana K still has this weird idea that Nobu should hate her for wanting to be with him.  Not many guys would think that way, girl.  At any rate, careful what you promise, there, Nobu.  It may not be so easy.

Hahaha, Nana O internally raging at Nobu for *not* screwing the hell out of Nana K right then and there.  Yet Nana K herself thinks Nana O will be angry for breaking it off with Takumi.  If only you'd (both!) just talk these things out instead of hiding!

Welp, poster comes down.  You done, Takumi.  But, uh, breaking up over the phone?  C'mon, Nana K.

Weird how Takumi would consider it a "scandal" if it got out that Ren has a girlfriend.  And again poor Naoki gets no respect, no respect at all, I wanna tell ya.

And only once she's actually talking to him on the phone does she realize that it's "pretty cold".  You swing wildly between perceptive and not, Nana K.

Hm, I think that's the first time we've seen Nana K genuinely angry!  And kind of an odd thing for her to snap over  just that one word, "inconvenience".  Maybe he should have said "disaster"?  Oh well.  Whatever gets the inevitable breakup underway.  As a side note, it's kind of fascinating how similar Ren and Takumi sound in their little talk after the call, just on opposite sides of the issue.

Record store clerk.  Why do I feel like I should have guessed?  But, yeah, Nobu, you gotta learn you're locked on to a girl who moves *fast*.

Why does Nana O seem so shocked to realize Nana K went after Nobu, especially when she was pulling so hard for Nobu to go after her?  Also, is that bedroom scene between Nobu and Nana K real, or just Nana O imagining?  Guess we'll soon see!

There's not been a lot in the letter-from-the-future framing device for awhile, so this "That old claw foot bathtub isn't around anymore." kinda comes outta left field.

>> ARTICLE
**Episode 28**

Things are working pretty nicely for Nobu. He's able to work Hachi's heart fairly easily because they are perfect for each other.

A new storyline with Shin seems to be starting and even Misato has secrets!

Trapnest starts complaining about the paparazzi. I wonder if this will be the next storyline for NANA/Ren. Reira is always funny :P

We finally see a "breakoff" between Hachi and Takumi. The cold "inconvenience" line really sealed the deal. With that we get a little insight on Ren, he's definitely a nice guy. I don't think we need to worry about Ren/NANA.

She's got to leave Takumi like instantly...but she probably won't

Yasu suspicious of everyone :O

Seriously these two are so cute together...should drop it now...

My canon ending would have them married and Blast plays at their wedding

See how much of a better ending that is!

UGH!! I doubt that was enough of a break up -.-

Didn't know bloodtypes were that important :O

Now she seems so clingey haha but he clearly doesn't mind :p
>> ARTICLE
A happy opening scene for once! Aaaand we come back down to reality. Hachi, why wait for so long if you really did want to go out with Nobu instead of Takumi?

What's with these hidden/fake names all of a sudden? And Shin got lawyered by Yasu there.

Don't think about it too hard Hachi, just run with Nobu. Call Takumi and say something along the lines of "nope, we're done here" and go. Nobu's a bit optimistic about Hachi breaking things off and sorting out her feelings but it's a good hurdle for her to overcome by herself first.

I understand Hachi wanting to meet him in person but oy... wait, she dumped him just like that, nice. You're free, Nana!  Nobu's wise to *try* to wait for her to get some time and distance but like Yasu said, a man becomes weak when in love.

The tub's not there in the end? I have to wonder if the apartment gets destroyed or something. Worse, it sounds like Hachi's writing to Nana as if she died.

[Speculation about other likely foreshadowing](/s "Bringing up Hachi possibly having a baby is concerning me as that's not the first time pregnancy's been mentioned. Now I think it's bound to happen at some point, I'm guessing unintentionally with Hachi as Nana's been shown to be proactive about birth control. Not something I'm looking forward to at the moment as she's not ready to handle it.")

The flag is about as obvious as Shigatsu's death flag.

Hachi probably filled the bathtub with acid to dispose of the bodies, and had to get rid of it afterwards.

Shin and Misato with secrets about their past/families. Yasu is so damn perceptive.

Hachi and Nana still have a weird conversational barrier. Need to actually talk from the heart for once.

Noaki, you great guy. Wish they made a spin-off of him and Yasu teaming up for a concert or something.

Nobu and Hachi, finally! Although you really didn't break up with Takumi, like you think, Hachi.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I didn't finish the episode so I was wondering what the hell was the bathtub comment. But it does seem like it would be a letter from Hachi to NANA. Probably cause BLAST made it big, and Hachi is just reminiscing about the good times.

I wonder if Hachi taking things way too fast is going to hurt her and Nobu's relationship. Probably. 

Poor Takumi, my heart goes out to you. It's interesting how Ren wants to still start a family, even though he has something nice going on with Trapnest. 


>> ARTICLE
God, that was a terrible way to break up with someone. I'm guessing Takumi won't take her seriously with that, especially considering it's Hachiko.

Also, I don't really trust Ren that much. He seems very similar to Takumi, honestly, but much more socially aware, which would essentially allow him to be much more manipulative.


>> ARTICLE
Everyone okay?

* Heh, interesting new Japanese word for me in Nana's message to Hachi: "" (noroke hanashi), which means blabber about one's love life/lover. 
* As I thought, Reira's under a lot of pressure to keep up her image. Her actual personality would probably be better suited to a sugary J-Pop group, though that would be a waste of her vocal talent. Maybe she should get into acting, if she even had Shin fooled at first.
* Yasu afraid Shin was gonna get eaten?
* Hah, yup, she did assume Nana snitched. Glad she asked and got it cleared up quickly.
* "Love." -That blush.
* Was not expecting bathtub a cappella.
* Daww, Reira's so cute. Shin's expression in the Elevator afterwards... He's not as detached as he pretends to be. Another friend of Nana might get trap-nested. Anyhow, at least he got his holy hand grenade back.
* He did it! ... And lots of soul searching by Hachi.

Oh yeah, so no record deal quite yet. I was just thinking, it's beyond convenient having a lawyer as band leader. No way Yasu will get screwed by stupid lopsided contracts.

Hmm I was hoping NANA avoid Hachi a little longer.

Forget all of that! Reira time! Some good backstory and then we are back to Hachi...

Confident NANA :D hope it works out for Blast.

NANA is lying D: and so is Takumi...

Choose Nobu...Redeem yourself Hachi...

Shin's style is always so interesting. And Reira is so into Shin :o

Hachi and Nobuuuuu cmon!! So awkward. He confessed !!!

Shipping Shin and Reira hard an I'm not even sure why!

Nobu is too nice of a guy...truly is what he says he is. Too bad Hachi is too hung over on Takumi.

> Nobu is too nice of a guy...truly is what he says he is.

He's the best...second to Yasu but still he needs to find his Sachiko
>> ARTICLE
Little indepth piece about Reina. She, like Yasu are characters that easily hide a lot od their true feelings. Always intrigues me, but that little moment of honesty resonated with Shin, as we can see in the elevator.

Good to see Nobu finally taking charge. Too bad it was after Takumi, but here's to hoping it spurs something positive.

Really like Hachi actually breaking it down with logic vs emotion. She's coming to realise that the fantasy of Takumi does not match thr reality, but it's still hard to remove that fantasy. At least with Nobu's confession it's really allowing her to try and discect it all.

In the end, it's sad that Nana and Hachi are starting to distant themselves, as they've come to rely on the other. Rewlly wish Nana told Hachi the truth and stayed by ber side. I blame Ren.
>> ARTICLE
> but here's to hoping it spurs something positive.

It better...


>> ARTICLE
Things are getting messier. Reira didn't want to just sleep with Shin but he's having none of that.

Nana's not very forthright about her concerns with Takumi and tries to reassure Hachi that everything will be all right, but is she trying to convince her roommate or herself?

I like that *everyone* knows what's going on with Nobu, and he doesn't continue to waffle around about it before finally telling Hachi that he loves her (also I really like Shin's line that he can beat Takumi at love). So close to being my favorite moment in the series so far... but she turns him down. This is probably going to be awkward in the future.

I'm trying to compare Shin to Hachi because they *feel* like they're in similar places right now but I'm having a difficult time putting it into words. They're both avoiding getting into relationships that would be good for them?
>> ARTICLE
> she turns him down

Did she, though?  I thought it was left pretty open.
>> ARTICLE
When Nobu asked if she's in love with Takumi, she gave a nod. So he took it as a rejection anyhow.

Given Hachi's personality, I don't think she'll easily be able to break things off with Takumi. She realizes this herself thankfully, so at least she didn't immediately accept then hurt Nobu by jumping into Takumi's arms again.  She's kind of a coward, so I wouldn't be surprised if she tries to sabotage her relationship with Takumi so he breaks things off instead, though that could backfire too.
>> ARTICLE
Given her track record, it wouldn't surprise me to see her try to make a legitimate go of it with Takumi and still run it off the rails!  :(
>> ARTICLE
> Reira didn't want to just sleep with Shin but he's having none of that.

Out of respect for Yasu maybe?

And yeah that confession scene could have been amazing if she didn't turn him down :(
>> ARTICLE
>I'm trying to compare Shin to Hachi because they feel like they're in similar places right now but I'm having a difficult time putting it into words. They're both avoiding getting into relationships that would be good for them?

The two of them are in similar, but inverse situations. Shin is in complete control of himself. He knows what he's doing with his job as a male prostitute and because of that, he has a hard time letting himself go. In fact, I don't think he knows how to properly express his emotions. Sex is just work for him, and it carries no sentimental value. Sometimes we forget that he is still so young because he has a very mature outlook on "reality" that's been ingrained in him as part of his occupation. However, that does mean he was never exposed to the immature/idealist side of life. 

As for Hachi, she too is very well aware of her situation, but she can not longer control it as a result of her prior actions and personality. She has always let herself go completely in a desperate search for a fantasy romance while trying to remain ignorant of reality. Actions have consequences, not only for yourself, but those around you as well - Hachi is being forced to learn this lesson the hard way.

Anyway, all of this will continue to be developed as the story continues to unfold. I look forward to reading everybody's thoughts on upcoming events.

So, indeed Nana O is sorta staying with Ren, as suspected.

Backstory for Reira  half American.  Kinda odd how the instinct with her PR people is to *hide* her halfsies nature, otherwise it's seen as nothing unusual to be talented?  Like Americans are somehow naturally superior, therefore it's no big deal for her to be beautiful and have a good voice?  But if she's pure Japanese, then it *is* noteworthy?  Weirdly poor national self-esteem there.  Or perhaps it's a "mixed people are prettier" thing  which is nothing I'd expect from the Japanese public.  Even if so, the instinct in American PR would be to *play up* that mixed status, not hide it.  "It's hard to be human."  True, but what a strange thing to say, Reira.

I kind of love how everyone's adopted Nana K's "demon lord" shtick.

Haha, what are those chicken chicks around Shin's head?  I'm not familiar with this symbology

Cute seeing both Nanas excited (or as excited as they respectively get!) talking about the record label news.

Nana O is really bending over backwards to be supportive over the whole Takumi thing, but Nana K is drowning in doubts about her own motivations.  It's an odd sort of reversal of their usual positions on the nave/worldly axis.

Heh, jeez.  Everyone in the world apparently knows about it, Nana K.  Too late to worry about that horse getting out of the barn when it's running down the road.

Nana O trying to be really diplomatic about what Takumi said at the party, but Nana K instantly figuring out what really happened.  Sometimes you're amazingly insightful, Nana K.  And in the next breath she comes to the conclusion that she's dense as hell for not getting that Nobu is into her.

D'aww, Nobu blushing hard.

"Pay in advance."  Ooof.  Cold as hell, Shin.  You're going to be that "hooker with a heart of gold" character, aren't you?  The kind who understands everything about love but has a self-imposed immunity to it.

"Maybe I've made a big mistake."  *Gee, ya think?*  Maybe just one or two?  Or ten?

Good that Nana K was not enthralled by "I want you all to myself" from Takumi.

Man, that episode felt about eight minutes long.

>> ARTICLE
>Nana O is really bending over backwards to be supportive over the whole Takumi thing

Man, every time I watch that conversation I feel terrible for Nana. You can just tell she's in pain saying those things and trying to convince herself that Takumi isn't a terrible person.

>Cold as hell, Shin. You're going to be that "hooker with a heart of gold" character, aren't you? The kind who understands everything about love but has a self-imposed immunity to it.

Is he immune to love or does he not have an understanding of love? Shin's job as a male prostitute at such a young age has robbed him of his innocence. He understands the darker side of human desire completely, but he has no experience in the purity/innocence of love as an emotion.

Possibly another way of putting what I was trying to say.  He knows what inputs to the system will result in what outputs, and can read its status with some accuracy.  So his advice is disturbingly good.  But he either can't or won't be a part of love himself.

There are plenty of Japanese musical artists in real life whose mixed heritage is not hidden  too. At least in that they may have a different upbringing than being strictly Japanese so they could be seen as unique or exotic compared to the usual talent.

I think that might have been a roundabout remark about the xenophobia in Japan. It's still an insulated culture, and finding out that she is half European would cuase a backlash. Instead of highlighting that, i suppose the writer went with a different meaning.

> Cute seeing both Nanas excited. 

I do like how the drama disappated on the news od a record deal, and Hachi was freaking out.
>> ARTICLE
Good episode again, but I don't even think there's a point in saying that anymore. Sort of a given.

Beyond that, not much to say. The entire time while Nobu was confessing to Hachi I just kept thinking "dump Takumi now!"

>> ARTICLE
Didn't think K hachi would turn nobu down especially with Nana singing in the background,  hoping nobu doesn't give up 
>> ARTICLE
* And the delving into Reira's character finally begins! She is definitely in my top 5 of favorite female characters. I feel like the two Nanas, though very complex, can still be kind of put into tropes: Nana is like that broken badass punk girl, Hachi is the cute and girly needy girl. But I always thought Reira was just pretty unique as a character. Her speaking voice is so nice too!
* That insert song that plays around 18:30 gets me every time... It's when the real heartbreak starts.
* On another note, I am absolutely obsessed with that Vivienne Westwood lighter.
* I'm rewatching this for probably the 5th time and I'm noticing some foreshadowing and I'm just going crazy not being able to talk about it!
>> ARTICLE
Whoa, new opening!

Huh, street promoter?  That actually sounds like a pretty fair application of Nana K's genki talents.  Though $100/day isn't as tremendous as she seems to think it is.  (Or is it?)

"SERVI**S**E QUEEN".  Oooops.

*Sigh*.  Once again, wishing to see cute girls looking cute is a perversion of what, exactly??  Don't listen to 'em, Yasu, you're 100% correct!

Nana O blew away all their wishes.  Hope that doesn't symbolize anything greater

Hmmm, looks like Nana K is letting her hopes regarding Takumi get the better of her after all.  At least a little.

It's cool that Jun has continuous access to all that farm-fresh produce, but how?  Is her family mailing it to her?  That can't be cheap!

You know, I have yet to understand why there's a utility sink right next to the dining room table.  Also, it didn't occur to me before this shot of the two Nanas sitting at that table, but that decorative set of crossbars at the bottom of the legs must be annoying as hell to actually sit at.  Constantly hitting your ankles against them and whatnot.

Backstage, again we see Takumi taking the role of the sensible, practical one.  Kind of odd considering the current story arc.

Shin being an obvious prostitute with a reporter in the room.  What could go wrong?

Man, Takumi really makes it hard to get a read on his true intentions.  He doesn't remember "Hachiko", Nana K's teasing nickname, instead instantly recognizing her real one; but he callously lets slip that he banged her in the course of figuring out the logistics of an autograph, going so far as to brag about how willing she was.  Not to mention showing up at her door that night as promised after all.  Just what is your deal here, Takumi?

Also interesting to see both Nobu and Shin getting royally pissed off at Takumi over Nana K.  Gonna be quite something to see if either of them lets this news slip with Yasu.

As for Nana O, she doesn't have to be told, I suppose, given that last scene.  I expected her to yell at them and break it up, but instead she quietly retreats and seems somewhat terrified.  Meanwhile Nana K gives narration that seems to say "be careful what you wish for; you may get it".  Sounds like that means this Takumi thing is going to end in more tears after all.  :(

>> ARTICLE
>It's cool that Jun has continuous access to all that farm-fresh produce, but how? Is her family mailing it to her? That can't be cheap!

The way she talks about it seems like somebody's is delivering them to her, but then there's that prologue scene from yesterday's(?) episode where we see Junko sitting in garden, so maybe she makes the occasional trip? I don't see that happening since she was so adverse to returning home though.

>Just what is your deal here, Takumi?

Wouldn't we all like to know? He's certainly one of the most interesting characters in the show/manga.


>> ARTICLE
Nice write-up.

> Though $100/day isn't as tremendous as she seems to think it is. (Or is it?)

It would be decent pay if it was stable work, she doesn't mention how many hours/day but assuming 8 that's like $12.50/hr- minimum wage in Tokyo is about $8/hr. It's basically a temp job, so I doubt she gets 5 days/week out of it.

> Is her family mailing it to her? That can't be cheap!

Not that bad really, I'm guessing her hometown is somewhere in/near Miyagi prefecture; I ran a shippping cost thing and even with the max size box it's only about 2000yen to Tokyo (flat-rate, 30kg limit).
>> ARTICLE
* She's finally fully accepted her nickname- her [tanzaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabata#Customs) was signed "Hachi"
* New OP! Hmm. I'll save my judgement for a while.
* Hachi should totally try out for the tambourinist position in Trapnest. It's Blast's fault for letting a talent like that slip away.
* Since no one's said it in a while, "[Damn it Nana!](http://i.imgur.com/sowXJLb.png)"
* Daww, vaguely heart-shaped tomato.
* Pfft, of course he has business cards.
* Hah, Nobu's opinion of Reira changed quick.
* It's been a while since we've seen Nana so shaken. That surprised me more than Takumi's attitude.

Edit: Oh crap, I forgot to watch the re-cap. \*goes back to the TV\*

21.5:

* Nice, 'live' version of Rose for the OP.
* \*sigh\* Guess I'll have to settle for re-cap Sachiko. Really do want to see more of her soon though.
* Very cool recap of Blast's first performance in Tokyo.
* Haha at Sakagami's jab at the other three.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 22**

These Nana intros have become something I really look forward to now

But miss the old OP...

Kyosuke and Junko are just so stable^^^ForNow

She seems good for this demo job!

Just saw the Tanzaku thing for Nagato ha

Their wishes...right out the window haha fun little scene

NANA really does care for her...wow

Nobu looking sharp!!

Reira and Shin are like kids...well one of them still is!

Nobu...he cared for her...wow

NOOOOOO...what a jerk...this is just wrong...

Well I'm angry now...
>> ARTICLE
What do you think of the new OP? It's definitely not as punk as Rose, but it's pretty catchy, I think.
>> ARTICLE
It's good and it fits more with right now but that first one was just amazing
>> ARTICLE
As much as I loved the first intro, I've grown to enjoy the second even moreso.
>> ARTICLE
Brief notes on 21.5, the recap episode:

* For some reason the OP is a different recording of the song from the one normally used.
* Lots of other songs used again, nice.
* Sakagami makes a return! And she points out that these recaps are for characters that don't have any more scenes in the show, I love it.


---
New OP? Not sure how I feel about it yet, but it didn't grab me like the first one did.

We're a couple days off for the Tanabata episode, but I'm amused it's as close as it is. I'm glad they just laughed off all of the papers blowing out the window, it's those kind of accidents that you tend to remember and make better memories rather than the holidays where everything went right and they just blend together. Aww, Nana's wish was for Hachi to find a (long-haired) boyfriend. Could that be Takumi?

I think I may get Naoki and Nobu mixed up if they're in the same room together. On the other hand, Reira and Shin probably shouldn't be allowed in the same room as I'm guessing they'll be bad influences on each other.

Oooh, Ren isn't happy about Takumi sleeping with Hachi, I didn't expect that. Same goes for Shin. Nobu I get though, he likes her now. I *really* didn't think Takumi would come to Hachi that night, though.

Take note of Hachi's narration at the end though: having dreams come true and achieving happiness aren't the same. This isn't going to end well for her. I mean, we could have inferred as much from everything else going on, but that pretty much seals it.
>> ARTICLE
>On the other hand, Reira and Shin probably shouldn't be allowed in the same room as I'm guessing they'll be bad influences on each other.

This made me laugh out loud. But Shin's *such* a cute boy!

>Same goes for Shin

What do you make of his reaction? To me, it almost seemed like he was acting on behalf of Nobu.

>I really didn't think Takumi would come to Hachi that night, though.

Perhaps he isn't just a playboy like everybody is making him out to be?
>> ARTICLE
Naoki is always a small ray of sunshine in this drama. 

Sad to see Hachi fall into her old self, just to be rid of some lonliness. Nana definetly should have written that note.

Takumo going back to Hachi just to spite Nobu and Shin, but mainly Nobu. 

It's okay Nana, I felt the same way seeing that the first time around as well. 
>> ARTICLE
New OP, i dont think that takumi cares for hachi at all.  I'm just curious about his motivation for going to see her after the party (to show up nobu and shin or just his rumored womanizing ways) 
>> ARTICLE
At this point it's definitely the former. He had no intention on seeing her before then.

But damn was it satisfying to see shin and Nobu crash his party

What Nobu did was heartbreaking and what Shin did was badass
>> ARTICLE
Hoping nobu gets a chance to say something to hachi before things get too serious 
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god I love Shin. He is amazing. And Reira is pretty awesome too.

 Takumi confirmed for shitbag as expected, and saw that ending coming. I don't know, on one hand I feel bad for Hachiko, but at the same time I can't too strongly empathize with her given her streak of making really shitty decisions and having dumb expectations. As for Nobu, it seems like he's interested in Hachiko but not really making a move. Partially on him there, like Ren agrees with.

Series going great overall, I'm going to be really upset with the end though, as I've heard there's no proper conclusion.

RIP old opening. You will be missed.

**Episode 22**

So I'll preface my notes today with the following;

#FuckHachi

That is all.

Another eventful episode. We got to see more Reira :D and her first interaction with Shin and Nobu.

But the most interesting thing about today's episode was the afterparty. It's incredible clear that Nobu has feelings for Hachi. He completely freaked out at Takumi! With good reason too. Fuck Takumi. And I clapped hard when Shin joined in too. 

Even Reira liked it haha! Then he goes on saying that Nobu will never surpass him? And then goes to Hachi's place? Mad disrespect. Nana isn't going to like this...

This episode definitely confirmed all the foreshadowing...Takumi is also not a good guy.

---

Should probably add #FuckTakumi
>> ARTICLE
> Fucked Hachi

Fixed That For You

or rather

>Fucked Hachi .. Again !
>> ARTICLE
> #FuckHachi

There's already enough of that going on. But why be mad at her?


>> ARTICLE
Even though she's more self-aware with her navet, she still falls for the same tricks. I don't understand her dreams and her wants. 

>> ARTICLE
Well, she did want a cold guy next. carefulwhatyouwishfor.

I think it could still be a fun experience for her, if she remembers not to take it too seriously (Hah, yeah right). I'm pretty sure the dinner they had last episode cost more than her rent. probably more than two month's worth.

I get the feeling there's more to Takumi's character than this episode leads us to believe as well.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, you're more optimistic. Takumi is a player, and the way he acted at the afterparty is why he's a jackass.

Go Shin and Nobu!
>> ARTICLE
> Should probably add #FuckTakumi

Seconding -.-

This is all a game to this fucking guy. And Hachi still eats it up even though she knows that it's wrong.

I'm just going to count my blessings on NANA. Shes the only MC that is understandable.

Hopefully she stays that way...poor Nobu :(
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised he didn't fuck him up. I'd love to see that. The way he casually slipped that he slept with her. The fact that he went to her house after it all, almost as if he's doing it in spite of Nobu. Fuck man I'm so angyyy.

**Episode 29**

Just having a poster of your friend's boyfriend on your wall is a bit weird ha

Seriously they are adorable together :)

The retun of Shouji :O

Shin's situation seems so  complicated

Hope they just focus on that and leave Nobu and Nana as a happy couple :p




>> ARTICLE
>Episode 27

Eh??
>> ARTICLE
Whoops! haha thanks :p
>> ARTICLE
Very past-focused episode. Best one in a while IMO.

* What was that poster backed with, some kind of solvent? A few months shouldn't have left a mark like that on the wall. Hachi doesn't even smoke.
* [=3](http://imgur.com/a/9oupE)
* Ohh, the tables have turned. Let Hachi worry about coddling a guy for a while.
* Haha, Junko/Kyousuke/Burger Guy teasing Shouji.
* Woot! Sachiko scene. Wait, that's it!? \*shakes fist\*
* Awesome explanation on the Shouji/Hachi breakup.
* As I thought, Takumi doesn't think it's over. And Ren is afraid to stir the pot. Can't say I blame him too much, the guy is already breaking shit.

Lots of insight into Nana's character this episode. She's evidently very possessive, which helps explain the way she's been acting.

I've been focusing on Hachi under the assumption that she will	 be the one to go on a murderous rampage, but it might turn out to be Nana. (They say it's always the quiet ones.)
>> ARTICLE
I'm no expert, but I think it takes a lot longer than that to get that level of sun-fading on interior paint.  Makes for a nice visual symbol, though.

Well, guess that answers my question about that scene being real.  Such adorable pillow talk, d'awwww!  Also, cat-eyed queen Nana O best Nana O.

But this is a sudden burst of backstory for Nana O!  Look at that cute high-schooler.  Nobu called her a "goth chick", but she dressed pretty preppy

Good to see Nana K discovering the joys of being the doter and not just the dotee.

Hey, the exhibition!  Sweet, I didn't think we were actually going to see it, much less have it turn into a date between Nana K and Nobu!  And just like that, Jun and Kyousuke return to the loop.

Holy shit, Shouji is back *and has dialogue*!  But it seems pretty unfair for them to *still* be putting him through such a wringer over ancient history.

Nobu's just a play-actor who happens to be optimal for Nana K?  God damn, Jun and Kyousuke, you guys are cynical as *hell*.

*Double holy shit*, we get to see Shouji and Sachiko at home too?  Man, the surprises just keep coming!

That bed scene between Jun and Kyousuke packs in a lot of Greek Chorus.  Strange to see them so much more sympathetic to Shouji once he's safely out of earshot.  Also it kinda weirds me out to see Jun's switched her hair to dreads just like Kyousuke.

HAHAHA, Ren feeling up Nana O while she cooks.  A classic small pleasure in life.

Uhhhhhh.  Nana O, why did you have to go and say that?  Why?  Nobu was feeling so good about Nana K and you had to throw a monkey wrench into the works.

Shin's adopted?  Or maybe a step-child?  And has an older brother?  And dad doesn't give a fuck about him?  Still trying to figure out where his story line is going.

Again, it seems like *so much* went on during this episode.  How does this show keep managing to do that?

>> ARTICLE
> Again, it seems like so much went on during this episode. How does this show keep managing to do that?

Me: *Wow, this was a really good episode.* \*glances at progress bar\* *15 minutes left!?*
>> ARTICLE
Aww, Nobu and Hachi (sorry Hachi, not calling you Nana anymore) are really cute together. Again, I like that they're showing a naked couple in bed without full [modesty bedsheets](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestyBedsheet).

Nana knew what was going on with Hachi and Nobu and approved, she just liked to toy with her. I expected it to go on a bit longer but Hachi was thankfully pretty blunt about things.

And suddenly back to Hachi's old friends. I guess they mostly missed out on Takumi there, but that's for the best. Not sure how I feel about Junko trashing Shji with him right there but it's a good reflection on how Hachi's changed (or hasn't) so far.

Yes Takumi, suffer. Unfortunately he doesn't get that things are over on her end.

Funny how Shin and Nana wanted Nobu and Hachi together for different reasons, both for their own benefit rather than the new couple's. That's a good point about how possessive Nana is though, I didn't think much of it.

Yeah, still don't know what happened with Shin's past. That's going to come back and bite him at some point.
>> ARTICLE
**Episode 29**

Wow this episode was a lot of fun!

We got to see more of Hachi and Nobu together...so intense already.

We got to see Shoji and Sachiko again haha! They seem to be going strong. This is probably the last we're going to see of them. We got closure on how Shoji felt during the end of his relationship with Hachi.

NANA when she was younger looked so cool :o and what she said to Nobu...so fierce.

Hachi attempts to move on but it seems Takumi hasn't got the message!

--

>> ARTICLE
Can't really blame takumi for not knowing hachi broke up with him.  She didn't really say that on the phone. Nobu and hachi seem like  a good match until Nana said that she wanted to keep hachi in her backyard. That kind of creeped me out a bit. As I thought shin has had a rough 15yrs, glad he has found some happiness with the band and hopefully reirra too
>> ARTICLE
Man, this episode was pretty crazy. Just the ending of Hachi talking to NANA, and Shins father telling Yasu that he never cared or loved Shin. Pretty sad last few minutes of an episode. The last frames of NANA just chilling there watching the river with a wine bottle invoked a pretty lonely feeling also.

And Takumi doesn't think that Hachi broke up with him. This will be pretty good drama, I can already tell. 

I don't understand why Nobu was so suprised at what NANA said to him about Hachi and the leash. He should have known what personality the girl he has known for a while. 

>> ARTICLE
Back to the beginning with some extra knowledge about the characters! That framing letter is still a mystery, though.

Nana K's obviously really anxious about whether or not Shoji was accepted to his university, as right now her entire future hinges on it. Her goal is to be reunited with him and her friends and it's a massive relief to her that she can make the journey. Speaking of which, she dumps her entire life back home to make the trip. Not necessarily at the level of burning bridges, but she's definitely straining the relationships she has with her coworkers and particularly her family. Were they even aware of her plans? It's short-sighted to say the least and we can only hope she'll make it in Tokyo.

I remember I was initially wondering why she wasn't just going to move in with Shoji, and we get something of an explanation here as their relationship is still in its early stages. I think I've been harsher on Shoji than necessary but I'm still trying to look out for Nana's best interests.

On the other end we have Nana O, who is still closed off to us in this episode but we can guess what's going on with her. She's out to make a name for herself on a much bigger stage, and it's amusing that the other Nana assumes she's already famous; I have to wonder if that boosted her confidence a bit. And I imagine she sees her opposite in Nana K when they first meet, a girl following her heart to be with her boyfriend. Does that give her pause, to make her wonder if she made the right choice? Or does she see Nana as simply foolish? 
>> ARTICLE
> And I imagine she sees her opposite in Nana K when they first meet, a girl following her heart to be with her boyfriend. Does that give her pause, to make her wonder if she made the right choice? Or does she see Nana as simply foolish?

I got the feeling both Nanas are a little envious of each other, that they wish they could be a little more like the other. Nana K's impression of Nana O is pretty clear from the first time around (pretty, great style, cool), but this time the way the conversation flows leads me to think Nana O wishes she could be more true to her feelings like Nana K.
>> ARTICLE
> It's short-sighted to say the least and we can only hope she'll make it in Tokyo.

Ah that's the word I was thinking of! So short-sighted! But that fits her perfectly it seems.


>> ARTICLE
And we're back... to the start. Yeah, it's a little taxing to see half the pilot again, but at least Nana K is back too.

Who hasn't changed much in a year. She immediately quits her job and takes to the road in pursuit of Shoji, something we see now was not wholly agreed upon in advance. Selfish, careless and impulsive. But that's why we love her. 

Anyway, I said yesterday that this episode is a nice testament to how the laid out past impacts our empathy with the characters. The train conversation immediately shows that: it carries a lot more weight and subtleties become clear that weren't there before. 

Notice in particular the facial expression of Nana O when she asks why Nana K didn't go after Shoji (9 minute mark, give or take). It's easy to miss, but now that we know Nana O a little better, we see that the question isn't only directed at Nana K. It's almost as if she's asking the question to herself, hoping that Nana K can provide her the answer that she can't give herself. A futile effort and the expression vanishes, but it's a moment we recognize as a tiny moment of vulnerability in the Nana O that seemed impregnably cool in the pilot. 

In the explanation that follows from Nana K, we also recognize a nice little change when she acknowledges that she doesn't have any dreams (objective) and understands that that is a problem. The entire importance of the problem has not yet dawned on her, but at least she knows of its existence. 

Aside from the train scene, there is another big realisation in this episode. Nana K gets scolded twice here. Once by Shoji for not getting her ass into gear for the important stuff and once by Junko for her inability to do things alone. What this comes down to is the simple fact that while Nana K has stayed the same in the past year, waiting for the moment she can start her life as an adult, her friends living in Tokyo have taken a head start and have grown as people in search of their goals, adapting to life as grown-ups. As a result, we see a disconnect and a little bit of tension forming in the relationships Nana has with Junko and Shoji, like a band that has been stretched because one of the ends has moved, while the other one hasn't. 

There's an interesting visual cue alluding to this in the car scene. [Here](http://imgur.com/AZwgo4G) Nana K talks about how nice it feels to have the four of them together again like the old days, but notice how the lighting and colouring conspire to give Junko, Kyosuke and Shoji the same colour coats. Nana K is the odd one out, with her vibrant colour showing her untainted personality, where the other three have a weathered colour showing their more world worn personalities. 

The conclusion is that Nana K will have to catch up in order to get the relationships back to what they were, but there are no guarantees that that will happen even if she catches up with them. 

But when all is said and done, it's nice to have the Nana's together again. Tomorrow we'll finally start the story with them together, so a big cheer is in order! 

Sidenote: /u/Durinthal has pointed out that I got a little bit too ahead of the show in my write-ups. I've tried to tone that down a little, but let me know if there are still things that seem too ahead of the curve and I will adjust accordingly. It's my first time doing these for a show with an overarching plot, so I'm still striking the balance in my observations. Suffice to say that feedback is always welcome, especially constructive criticism.

I missed that, will need to keep a sharper eye out.

Nope, you're good. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
That was interesting, seeing the train conversation again. I'll be honest, I didn't have many new thoughts though. But when they got off the train, maybe Nana O immediately left because she didn't want to see Nana K reunite with her boyfriend when things ended the way they did with Ren. Sure, it's been over a year but being that close to someone, it can take a while to move on completely. 

Her reunion with Jun is more meaningful and there's a serenity seeing all of them together. When Nana arrived at Shoji's place the first time around, I wasn't sure what would happen. Seeing how the show has handled sexuality, I find myself thinking "of course it's okay to stay over, Nana." That hug was nice and Nana's embarrassment is cute. 

Additionally I don't think anyone would be bothered with this much of a recap if we were watching on a weekly basis. 
>> ARTICLE
Things probably would have gone differently if Shouji was waiting outside the gate rather than on the platform. Rather than not wanting to see the reunion, I got more of the feeling that she didn't want to get in the way of it. She probably was a bit curious to see the guy she'd heard so much about though, her eyes were following them as she turned around to walk away.

Also, seems like Nana O should have been quicker to look when someone called her name there, haha.
>> ARTICLE
Very possible. 
>> ARTICLE
> maybe Nana O immediately left because she didn't want to see Nana K reunite with her boyfriend when things ended the way they did with Ren.

Ouu didn't think of that. I just thought she was just being her cool usual self and couldn't be bothered. I like your thought a lot more.

* I think she can count out a letter of recommendation from the video rental place.
* Yup, definitely feel more of the undercurrents watching the train scene again after the backstory.
* Pretty well done [mix of still photography and illustration](http://i.imgur.com/RAv2xIw.png) immediately after the bridge. The shinkansen they took was a [200 Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_Series_Shinkansen), which was retired a couple of years ago.
* Shouji suddenly less cold looking with the added scenes. Its like episode 1 shows Nana Ks mindset, while this one shows more of the full picture.
* Pfft, I missed it the first time, but Nana and Nana move into room 707 (nana zero nana). What is this, [Maison Ikkoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Maison_Ikkoku_characters#Creation_and_conception)?

**Episode 6**

Feels like it's been awhile since we've hear Nana's voice, don't think Ive missed her though haha

No 2 weeks notice? Well she's happy at least!

He's not a cheater? That's good to hear^^^ForNow

I always seem to underestimate Nana's "carefreeness"

Calling them old couple haha it kinda suits them

Didn't expect this much of a recap...wanted more from NANA's POV

A couple extra scenes but yeah...

He may not be a cheater, but like you say relationships might not go well in Nana. There are plenty of douchebag things you can do..

Why are we all skeptical of Shoji? He's not *that* bad but I don't really trust him and I can't say why.

I like them! Can we have another series about the couple in a stable serious relationship?

Probably because he seems a little flaky like Nana K herself.

I'm skeptical of everyone!!! Shoji, so far, though has been pretty great though.

I like them too and yes! I would be all for this :3
>> ARTICLE

**Episode 6:**

Nana quits her job, she's off to Tokyo.

One of the reasons why I love this OP so much is how it begins before the visuals start.
I love shows that do that. 

Congrats to Shoji for making it to college! Don't say that Junko. 
She's already packing LOL.

Just a note left to your parents? What the fuck???
This shows the massive contrast between both Nanas.
Our Hachi is willing to above and beyond to be with her boyfriend while black hair Nana is much more reluctant to just tag along.

So we finally got to the fateful encounter again. We're still not past where we were.
Twin tails Nana O.o

He finally realized...she cleaned for you! 

"Living like hermits"...ouch. But atleast they're actually a mature couple!

OK NOW WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD!  We should have watched 2 episodes today, especially since there is a recap episode in this series.

I don't know if I like the OP better than the ED.

I prefer Trapnest's voice over Nana's but they both serve their purposes perfectly.

>> ARTICLE
Not much to say about this episode, really. We've seen it all before. There's some more context, but it seems like a really weird decision to have a recap episode only 6 episodes in, even assuming that we were watching this weekly.
>> ARTICLE
I like this little enhanced revisit.  Everything takes on a new look in the light of what we now know about their pasts, and a few extra scenes are added to flesh it out further.  For example, in the first episode, I thought Shoji seemed kind of uncaring and distant.  Doesn't seem that way at all now.

Hey everybody, I managed to find some time to actually post today! I realize now that I look at it from your guy's perspective, it would have been better to watch episodes 6 and 7 in one go, so sorry for that oversight. I personally really enjoyed this episode because it's very nostalgic, but I won't say any more for fear of spoilers. Tomorrow's episode will finally move past what we've seen already and there shouldn't be any more pacing issues.

**"Hey Hachi. I always thought life was about standing your ground, no matter how strong the current is. But going with the flow is not such a bad thing at all. As long as you're moving forward."**

Well, another 'in between' episode, though we do get a nice Nana^2 moment. 

Nana O's comment at the end is particularly relevant this time around. I always quote them, because I think they're maybe the best thing in the show and provide an extra dimension to the story, but today's quote is a bit unusual. 

This episode focused on Nobu and Nana in particular, with the ending quote highlighting the biggest difference between the two. Nana is uncompromising because of her pride, to the point of bull-headed stubbornness, while Nobu is more easy-going to the point of having a wishy-washy nature, never truly committing to something and refusing to back down. 

During my second time around, I have to say I've changed my view on those attributes a little. I admired Nana for her resolve and chided Nobu for his lack of it, but now I have to say that though they are polar opposite attributes, neither is inherently good or bad. 

It has brought them somewhat equal amounts of joy and hurt. We see Nana in pain when she did not come with Ren to Tokyo and through her refusal to speak to Hachi, but we also see her absolute resolve to achieve what she wants, through whatever peril she might face. We see Nobu simply give up on Hachi through sheer lack of resolve, but he also seems to put sunken ships behind him more easily. 

Ultimately, both have their merits, like Nana says herself. But I don't agree entirely: both have to balance out this character trait more and choose their moments to stand their ground. Otherwise it will keep costing them, perhaps dearly. 

Moving forward is fine, as long as you don't dwell on regrets and learn from your mistakes.  
>> ARTICLE
Sheesh, everyone's freaking out a bit much over simple hyperventilation, aren't they?  Though I would say it's not a bad idea generally for Nana O to see a psychiatrist.

Kind of a dumb move for Reira to wear that lighter if she doesn't want anyone knowing about what it represents, ain't it?

Aw, Nana O wore Misato's heart jacket for the shoot!

Ok, that's the second time in the space of half an episode Gloomy-chan covered her wrist with it upturned.  Gotta be a cutter, or even a suicide attempt.

The dub VA does a pretty bad job of distinguishing "myu" from "miu".  Oh well.

Another new song for the ending?  The hits just keep comin'

>> ARTICLE
It might be simple in hindsight, but when it suddenly happens in front of you and you have no idea what is actually happening to them, you tend to freak out. 
>> ARTICLE
More Miu is always welcomed. Funny to see her at the start all over again, where she comes across as really spaced out. Comforts a panicked Nobu, saying that Yasu being there will make her feel better, and being a little jealous of it [Manga spoilers](/s "completely forgot that her first meeting of Yasu was him holding Nana. Her jealously towards their relationship later on makes it a lot more clearer.")

Still really like their manager. He's such a great fit for the band, and really comes across as caring, along with the rest of the band. Just because you feel weak at times, doesn't mean people with abandon you, Nana. 

Man, the amount a band has to do in one day in Japan, just to hit it big is insane. Good for Nana, as she can just dive into work and not let her emotions come up again.

Nobu got a new crush. Sadly Miu comes with a lot of emotional baggage, even going by Gin-chans reaction to the guard comparing Nana to Miu, the hyperventilating and her continue efforts to hide her wrist. :(

Great that Nana sent Hachi an invite to her live performance. It's almost like her trying to succeed if half for herself, half for Hachi now.

Still need to stop being so down about it, Nana. Just talk to her, and your panic attacks will cease. Good thing Yasu is there to calm you down, eventhough you think you don't need him around for comfort.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty good episode.

* Yasu x Ginpei.
* Haha, I want to see Naoki's stuffed animal stuffed room.
* C'mon Shin, there's a place right next door you could meet her at...
* Reira's totally fallen for him now.
* Hah, Yasu has to force Nana to bow to people.
* Heh, Hummer.
* Hah, giant poster faceoff.
* Time's really scooting by. A month in there already.
* Hmm. She might break Ren. Wonder if he'll be able to function.
* Miu obviously has some issues, and she seems to be into Nobu. Looks like she hid where she cut her wrists when he came into the room- I could see where she might have trouble getting parts. Nobu's the white knight type (He reached out to Nana in High School and all that), so even if he knows Miu's problems he'd probably still pursue a relationship with her.
* So Trapnest knows Blast will be appearing with them, but does Blast know? I think Yasu might.
* Ah, I've heard this ending song on the radio occasionally.

Things are starting to get some traction. Let's see which band sells more.
>> ARTICLE
Things are looking up for blast. Nana may finally be looking in Yasu's direction. Everything seems to be coming together for them,  hachi even got a chance to seem even though they weren't aware that she was there.  Guys we are almost at the end... 
>> ARTICLE
And despite all that I have a sense of foreboding and I'm waiting for something terrible to happen, just because it seems like it's that kind of series.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah probably and since we only have a few episodes left and kinda prompts you to continue with Manga
>> ARTICLE
Poor ~~AV star~~ Miu, seems like she has a rough life. Sketchy agency through and through, just calling Ginpei for Nana there. At least he seems to be looking out for them.

Hah, Reira's keeping Shin's influence on her away from Takumi.

BLAST's all sorts of busy with preparing for their debut. Good for Nana avoiding Ren, not good for her avoiding Hachi and Shin/Reira.

Miu keeps covering up her wrist and I never see what she's hiding. Scars? Tattoos? Yep, seems like Nobu has a new girl. They're cute together so I'm all for it.

Someone told Hachi where to go for their stealth concert! I'll admit I squeed when I saw her there.

Whoa, Nana's really going to end things with Ren? I was still a little uncertain last episode but I guess she's going for it.

And another new ED song. I have to say I like that they're ramping up for the end of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It's actually not that sketchy. If you think of it from a company stand point: They don't want Nana going to a random hospital and seeing a random doctor where a bunch of people will see her and then rumours will spread, and the focus of the media towards the band will be just that 
>> ARTICLE
> Someone told Hachi where to go for their stealth concert! I'll admit I squeed when I saw her there.

It was Nana herself, wasn't it?
>> ARTICLE
Probably, but I think saw the name Yasu in the text and Nana's own phone was broken, right?
>> ARTICLE
Iindeed.  I had been confused as to why Yasu's name was there at all, but that would explain it.
>> ARTICLE
Right, the from line said Yasu, but the message was signed Nana. Pretty sure she borrowed his phone to tell her.

I thought it was interesting that she stayed all the way across the street; she used to always be in the front row.

Miu isn't the AV star, that was Yuri. I was confused at first too since they were both introduced so close together.

Ah gotcha. Yeah, definitely didn't realize they're different people.

**Episode 13:**

Nana can't spend time with Shoji. She's pretty much lost. 

Shoji feeling the guilty already, and Kyosuke is a god like boyfriend.

I gotta hand it to Hachi. Didn't think she'd land the job, especially at such a profressional workplace. 

Fuck Shoji, Hachi have some fun times with the band!

Gotta say, Shoji fell out of love pretty fast. 

Junko is trying to be friends to both of them. Remember she's best friends with both of them. She can't just leave Shoji behind. 	

So they finally meet, the guilt is sinking in for Shoji and Sachiko...

Shin is straight! And he gets laid quite a bit lol. He's a "player" lmao

Nana is already sensing something is up
>> ARTICLE
* They love those panning shots in the prologues. Might be interesting to splice them all together.
* Hachi's [OL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_lady) life. I'd watch a show about that.
* Shin's transformation, haha.
* Another phone call. Awkward... Really does bring to mind Hachi's fling with the married guy.
* You tell that Sakagami, Hachi!
* Things just got real for Sachiko. A face to go with the name, and Hachi gave a mature and kind impression. If Shouji's ending things with Hachi, I don't see his relationship with Sachiko lasting very long. She'd have to feel pretty guilty.
>> ARTICLE
Sachiko is pushing back against him, he's fallen out of love with Hachi, at this rate it looks like Shoji is going to end up all by his lonesome.
>> ARTICLE
> Another phone call. Awkward... Really does bring to mind Hachi's fling with the married guy.
 
Didn't think of it at the time but yeah, it's kinda similar.

> If Shouji's ending things with Hachi, I don't see his relationship with Sachiko lasting very long. She'd have to feel pretty guilty.

I'm not sure, I could see it going either way at this point. Sachiko does feel guilty now but... she won. And she's the one that encouraged Shouji in the first place. It can be enough to make you overlook the pain you caused the other person.
>> ARTICLE
And here's an episode of Shoji avoiding responsibility for his actions. He tries to find an ally in Kyosuke (nope), continues visiting Sachiko, and he doesn't tell Nana a thing, avoiding her even more.

Aside from that, Hachi has a bothersome bossy lady in Sakagami but I hope there's a good side to her as well, because there are probably few good qualities to be found in the men working there.

Interesting that Junko wants to avoid telling Hachi anything as well, does she have a history of doing terrible things to herself after breakups? Given the monologue at the end where she says she would have drowned herself in the river if Nana wasn't there, I guess so. I have to wonder about the timing of that statement though. I can only assume she knew what was coming at that point *or* it's in reference to after Shoji talked to her, otherwise it seems overly dramatic even for her.

Nice use of shade [here with Kyosuke and Junko.](http://i.imgur.com/NnUfRyg.png) It's rare that you see shadows cast across characters like that without there being some dramatic reason for it. Just trees.

I want Sachiko and Nana to both drop Shoji's ass and become friends instead, but that's far too optimistic of me. They're both generally nice and bubbly and we saw that in their interaction, but would they remain that way if Nana knew what was happening?
>> ARTICLE
>I can only assume she knew what was coming at that point or it's in reference to after Shoji talked to her, otherwise it seems overly dramatic even for her.

Hachi's narration is coming from far off into the future. Like in previous episodes and all the episodes to come, the narrations are like letters or diary entries by one Nana to the other in the future. Yes, the way I worded that does mean we will be getting Nana O narrations eventually.
>> ARTICLE
>  It's rare that you see shadows cast across characters like that without there being some dramatic reason for it. Just trees.

But there is a dramatic reason.  Shadows being darkness, but here intermixed with bright sunlight, and all shifting around.  Lots of uncertainty.

I was thinking that under different circumstances, the two probably would have been good friends.

There goes the Nobu x Shin ship.

Yeah, dunno why, but I had a feeling that both Shin and Nobu swinged that way. Turns out Shin is a real playa!

I started this with the intention of watching just one episode a day. If I get too far ahead, I'll probably get mixed up between episodes in the discussion threads. This is hard, man...

Haha, self control, man! This is definitely one of those shows where I, as a rewatcher, am almost uncomfortable discussing what is happening because what I want to say is influenced by what I know happens later in the show (and the manga).
>> ARTICLE
Geez.  When it was Mizukoshi, it was fine and he was a great guy, but when the guys in the office hit on her, they're disgusting lechers?  This is unfair discrimination!

Yeah, dressing up and commuting on the train to work in the big downtown sounds all cool and metropolitan, doesn't it, Nana.  And it seems like it for about the first week.  After that not so much.

Heh, Nana O is so jazzed about Blast having a gig!  So much for being cool and going it alone, eh?

Interesting to see Sachiko going out of her way to help Shoji keep Nana K from getting suspicious.

Even more interesting to see Kyousuke and Jun joining in on the It's-Best-If-Nana-K-Doesn't-Know-Right-Now brigade.  It's true she's been quite down on herself for losing her long string of boyfriends in the past, and how she pins so much of her worth on her relationship status.

That was oddly touching to see Nana O be so explicitly approving of Nana K being so helpful with Sachiko.  I wonder if Nana O herself would have done anything like that.

Hahah, Shin, the 15-year-old punk gigolo.

Hm, wonder what Shoji's going to tell her.  "We have to break up" and he'll try to make a go of it with Sachiko?  Or "I've cheated on you and I'm sorry" and try to make a go of it with Nana K?  Or maybe just "we need to work harder on our relationship" and quietly let the thing with Sachiko drop?  Or something else?  Sachiko herself seems to be pushing hard for Shoji breaking it off and going back to Nana K.  But Nana K's suicidal thoughts in the last line seems to indicate something traumatic from her point of view is coming next.  That means either "let's break up" or "I cheated", methinks.  "I cheated" would probably prompt introspection on her part regarding her own previous role as the *other woman*, karma, et cetera.  I doubt that would result in suicidal thoughts at this point, though.  So my money is on breakup.

Hmm.  Well, it will probably hurt, but in the long run it may be for the best all around, really.
>> ARTICLE
>That was oddly touching to see Nana O be so explicitly approving of Nana K being so helpful with Sachiko.

This is just a sign of you boarding the S.S. Nana^2

> I wonder if Nana O herself would have done anything like that.

Interesting question. Both Nanas have worked in a restaurant before, but I'd think Nana K, being more of a pull yourself up by the bootstraps gal, would have felt bad for Sachiko, but thought it was a good learning experience for her.

>Hahah, Shin, the 15-year-old punk gigolo.

So that's what I did wrong back in my youth, I knew I should've dyed my hair blue.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Shoji did go the "be a bastard" route. He could've fessed up, broken off things, and went with Sachiko, but for some reason he tried double timing despite the fact he doesn't even seem to like Nana. The guy hung around Nana while not being direct about his interest in her forever - he seems pretty weak willed and unable to take initiative, so his 'solve the problem by doing nothing' approach wasn't really surprising.

Also, Shin's a badass. That hair, though..




>> ARTICLE
Shoji is literally a mess on every scene now, smh. Junko and kyousuke reacted more calmly than I would have imagined 
>> ARTICLE
Nana is simply the queen of romance and anyone who says otherwise hasn't seen it.

The thing that separates Nana from every other romance show out there is that it's real. There are no perfect relationships. There are no perfect resolutions to problems. There are no perfect people. 

No 'misunderstandings', or black hole density MC's, or girls shyer than most wildlife, or ----*dere*. All those tropes, and all their perfect resolutions, they're all absent.

In Nana, people fuck up. Because that's what we do. And there is no magical fix. No 'when life deals you lemons, you make lemonade'. Sometimes when life gives you lemons, prepare for it to be fucking sour. And because they fuck up, you'll hate them for it. And you'll also love them for it.  

I feel your pain, man. And whatever the PADS may drive you to, do **NOT** read the manga. It will tear your hart out and break it into a thousand pieces. Trust me on this one.  

And don't listen to Kuroi Namida, because that will not make it better at all. 
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga and sometimes wish I didn't. I really really really hope that Ai Yazawa finishes it someday. But I have a feeling that the way the story is, is the reason she stopped. 

Being such a real series, I know a lot of authors get attached to their characters. I just wish I had a little bit more closure.

I'm really torn when it comes to Nana. On one hand, it was a great drama, I really enjoyed that aspect of it, I felt that the characters were really well fleshed out, and the realism of each character was something that's hard to find in other movie or show, not only anime but in general.

On the other hand, it didn't really feel like romance, which might be a bald statement for a show being considered the best romance anime has to offer. There were two relationships that actually felt deep, in my opinion, and that was Jasu's affection towards Nana and Nana's friendship towards Hachi. All the other characters felt as if they're more concerned about themselves than their love interest. Plus, Hachi as a character, while I appreciated her being a realistic depiction of a naive girl in big Tokyo, was unlikeable and irresponsible to the limit, I just couldn't cheer for her and wanted somebody to kick her in the arse so that she snaps out of it.
>> ARTICLE
I should watch Nana again some time but it seemed to me that although Hachi was consistently lackadaisical and happy-go-lucky when the chips were down she made very calculated pragmatic decisions.  People often criticized her character as being unrealistic but she reminded me very much of a couple of waitresses I knew from my days working at a restaurant.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but her pragmatism mostly shines when it came to relationships, which bothered me the most. When it came to her daily life, she was really acting irresponsibly. I don't think her character is unrealistic, quite the opposite, I just find it unlikeable, because I don't like people that can't get their shit together and always rely on others, emotionally or financially. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved Nana.  It's very unfortunate that Ai Yazawa became seriously ill and couldn't complete the manga.  I'm glad she survived and hopefully she'll be able to return to finish the series.

If you'd like more anime that relate to life then here are some recommendations:

 Movie [5cm per second](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter)
 A very good drama, slice of life, and romance rated as one of the best anime movies. It also has one of the best art in animated films.

Movie [Kotonoha no Niwa](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16782/Kotonoha_no_Niwa)
 Made by the same person as 5cm per second. It has even better art than 5cm per second and has a really good story along with it.

Anime Series [Clannad: After Story](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad:_After_Story) 
 Hands down one of the best dramas relating to life I have ever watched, this anime will make reevaluate your life. **The only downside is you'll have to get through season 1 which is your typical slice of life highschool anime. Bearing through the first season is EXTREMELY worth it though. Some people find the character models to be odd and distracting and miss out on such a great anime.**

>> ARTICLE
Definitely has that sense of realism to it. I loved all the characters in it and how they did the show.

If you want something similar?

There is Beck - although more of a coming of age SoL. It works very well for what it is. Its shows people as people. Warning: it has Rap/Rock as its music. 

Detroit Metal City - had me rolling. Haven't laughed so hard. Might help with PADS. Speed/Death Metal - tons of nsfw language.

Your Lie in April - um.. Yea maybe wait a bit. Still my favorite heart wrencher of them all.  Classical music is its forte and it works well with the story.
>> ARTICLE
If you want more Nana, she's a character in Golden Time
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that thing people always say about fighting being good is a load of horseshit.  I should know.

Aghhh 9/11!

Good to see Nana O settling down a little in her angst regarding Ren.  "'Cuz I love him.  It's that simple."  Right!

Surprising amount of conversation spent on the strawberry glasses!  And Nana O learns first-hand the importance of backups, especially when you have weird blackout episodes.

"Hachiko's got morning sickness and it's raining.  I'm sure she'll be home."  Not to mention she seems more or less confined to the castle keep at this point, one way or another.

Ughhhh that paparazzo's voice!  (In the dub!)  Who *is* that guy, it's driving me nuts!

Geez, Nana K is already using Takumi's name.  And so much for the theory about her being in.

Really taking precautions against visitors  precautions that building is pretty advanced to be providing.  *Yes, our front desk guy is a consummate actor!*  But Nana O sees though it, bless her quasi-boyfriend soul.

Gotta admit, Shin's blunt advice sounds like the actual right course of action to me.  But, that "I wish I'd been born as your child" seems to come right out of his amazing ability to say exactly the most affecting thing.

Ooof.  Sounds like Shin's mom had an affair and offed herself out of shame.  And that's why we get dad being so cold to him.

Haha, Trapnest being described as "goody-goody".  And our editor friend seems to be firmly in the anti-Takumi camp (like many here).

So Nana O waited there all day, yet Nana K didn't do anything but meet with Shin.  Guess they talked longer than it looked like.  But this "passing by behind Nana O's back, thus missing her" is getting to be a habit!  Funny how Nana K's now falling right into the pattern that allows Shin to do what he does, and how he gets this across to her directly, even giving advice for avoiding it.  Again, hooker with a heart of gold.

Sudden media spotlight.  Shin:  shocked.  Nobu:  shocked.  Nana K:  shocked.  Yasu:  *pissed*.

>> ARTICLE
There isn't much to say about this episode. As a matter of fact, this is more of a breather, the silence before the storm. Because nothing actually happens.

Nana O gets herself together, but misses Hachi through a rare case of plot convenience, something that still irks me. The show just doesn't need it and practically never resorts to these kinds of cheap tension tricks, but for some reason they are implemented here.

In any case, the reason for her missing Hachi is because of a talk the latter had with Shin. After being unusually solid last episode, Hachi can't get a streak going. Shin is talking sense here and Hachi just barely offers a rebuttal and a really weak one at that (accepting weaknesses... come on, really?). Furthermore, she tries to get some clues out of Shin as to avoid her child becoming like Shin in the future. 

Well guess what? It won't turn out that way. Because the answer to your questions is the same as your rebuttal should have been: you actually want the child. You want to raise it, you want to be a mother, unlike Shin's. All your actions of the past few days have pointed towards that. You've chosen a hard road, but at least it requires conviction. 

So don't you dare doubt yourself now, Hachi. Your choice may not be the right one, but you've followed through enough that it's too late to look back. There are legitimate reasons to abandon the path you've chosen, but this is not one of them. 

And that's it. Among the drama of past episodes we've still been setting the stage for another bomb: today the fuse has been lit. Now we have to wait for the bang... and deal with the fallout.

Aww, Shin left his holy hand grenade with Reira again.

I hate [this kind of thing](http://i.imgur.com/selrzhs.png) where one person [just barely misses another](http://i.imgur.com/3dBVM2M.png). I know it happens in real life too but it's just annoying to watch.

Oh, and Shin and Hachi have a depressing conversation and everything blows up at the end with the TV segment. That's about it this episode.

>> ARTICLE
I'm finding less to say about the episodes in the 2nd half. A lot of the mystery is gone, though that's not really a bad thing.

* Get to see Yasu's musical tastes there.
* Takumi making all the ladies cry.
* Ah, a normal modern key for once.
* Wasn't expecting Yasu to sell her out.
* Rent on the first apartment she looked at was (very) roughly $10,000/month. The location was somewhere in [Minami Aoyama](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/Minamiaoyama,+Minato,+Tokyo+107-0062), which is close to [Roppongi Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roppongi_Hills). 

The scene with Nana and Nobu was pretty awesome. We think of Yasu as the one that gives strength to their circle of friends, but Nobu might actually support them as much or more. He's definitely the one most true to his feelings.

>> ARTICLE
Nana O specifically calls out the cut on her cheek from the broken glass.  I didn't say anything last time, but that little detail seemed super unlikely.  I don't think I've ever seen anyone sustain an injury like that  dropped glass breaks and rockets a piece right into your face.  Also, I guess I missed it back then that it was a 100-yen store.  It kind of amuses me to learn there are 100-yen stores.  This dumb concept seems to have infected the whole world!

"I've gotta stop being so dependent on Yasu.  He isn't my boyfriend."  Cut to Reira clinging to him.  Hmm.  Yasu's a rock, but it's gotta be tough to comfort your ex over her torch-carrying being crushed.

Yep, that's about the most emotion Yasu's shown so far.  Poor guy.

Dude!  Yasu has Nirvana's _Incesticide_!  I thought I was the only one!

This "be calm, then snap" act of Takumi's is getting to be a pattern.  Sorry, Mari.

We briefly touch on Takumi's treatment of and attitude toward Reira, but I'm not sure I get the plan.  Why avoid confronting the issue, and so carefully feign ignorance for so long?  Was the idea to string her along so she'd stay in the band?  I wouldn't put it past him.  But it *really* doesn't make sense how he just dropped the bomb right at that crucial moment to ruin the recording session.  Dumb move, Takumi.

I can't believe Ren's actually suggesting what he seems to be suggesting  dump Nana K and marry Reira for the band's sake.  Even though he notes that it's a Machiavellian plot.  Not to mention his casual assessment of Nana K as a gold-digger.  Sheesh.  You tryin' to compete with Takumi in the Jerk Olympics, Ren?  I can only hope he only has a strange sense of humor or something.

And then Takumi calls Ren out for being a sellout.  Quite a friendship you two have.

I didn't catch till now that Reira's so angsty about her singing.  Kind of a diva in reverse.

What's the significance of Nobu calling Nana K "Nana" instead of "Hachi"?  Also, sad the guy's blaming himself.

I don't get why Nana O thinks she can't patch things up with Nana K just because she feels she owes Nobu.  Does she think he'd be hurt or something?  She should know better than that.

Ah, now the muckraking begins in earnest.  That'll surely help!

$10K a month and she's shocked.  Must mean she's been given free rein as far as budget or else she'd know what prices to expect.  (By the way, it feels weird to have so little screen time for Nana K!)

Huh, so that's Nana O's angle with Ren  "win him back" by excelling as a singer.  Kind of an odd motivation and an odd attitude.  On the other hand, we still don't quite know what Ren's reasoning was in joining Trapnest anyway.  He said before he was fine with anything so long as he got to play guitar.  But he also seemed pretty serious about being ambitious.  If he really doesn't care that much about the music, but cares more about having success, then it seems like Nana O's plan to impress him with singing prowess is doomed to fail.  Unless that's only a vehicle for her to *also* be a huge business success.  But I'm not sure he'd care about anyone's success besides his own anyway.

100 yen shops are the best thing ever. Unlike dollar stores in the US, everything really is 100yen (well almost, maybe like 5% could cost more), and the quality is usually pretty decent. Check out The Daiso if you ever go to Japan.

Transitioning from friendly/romantic to distant relationship. Everyone close to her in that group calls her Hachi.

Only one glass... oh right, Nana doesn't remember that she deliberately dropped the other one too. And even she's worried about relying on Yasu too much.

Aww, Reira. That's gotta be rough for Yasu too, with everyone depending on him.

Ren knows Takumi well. That was an interesting conversation between them and we get a slightly better view of Takumi as he's less controlling around Ren.

That's harsh, Yasu, turning Reira in like that. She has the right idea of things though, Takumi cares more about the product than the people.

And now Nana's relying on Nobu too. She went to Ren's before but did she really connect with him like she does with Yasu and Nobu? Bad idea to not try to patch things up with Hachi immediately though, this is just gonna drive them further apart.

Paparazzi investigating Ren and Nana? Looks like we're gearing up for a more heated rivalry between BLAST and Trapnest now. I didn't see it as Reira stealing Ren from Nana like she does.

So the two bands are drifting apart and Hachi's being forcefully pulled to Trapnest's side. Will anyone in BLAST try to drag her back?
>> ARTICLE
More Yasu is always good. I like these insights into his thoughts and emotions. You can see a great deal of love, or care, for Reira, even going so far as to admit to Takumi that the reason he broke up with her was for her voice, her reason for living, essentially. Plus I'm sure he knew how much Reira loved Takumi, that's hard to compete with.

Still no physical touching from him though, always keeping people at arms length, not letting his emotions get the better of him. Still have the Eric Clapton CD though.

I actually wonder how Nana would feel if she knew Reira went to Yasu, and stayed at his place.

On Takumi's part, you know get the feeling there's more to the relationship than brother and sister. Another good reason to read the manga. Ren's 'advice' on the other hand... is in poor taste.

Nana being the one that's there for Nabu, and realizing that he's been a friend to her for so long, possibly her only friend (excluding Yasu because romantic/sexual tension) since forever. Good to see her finally step up and act like the friend he's always been to her. of course he's shoulders would feel stronger than Ren's, he's never stopped being there for you. 

Oh course she'd never patch things up with Hachi, she hurt her only friend, and ostracized herself from the group as she has yet or never will fully explain what's going on with Takumi, the baby, and Nobu. Although thinking that she can move her emotional attachment (strawberry glasses) over to Ren is a little... drastic and not really thought out well.

Tabloid boss trying to force Blast into the spotlight.

**"You know, Hachi... I was hostile towards Trapnest, because I was envious of Reira for stealing Ren's heart, not as a woman but as a singer. I only wanted Ren to notice me more. I never wanted to make them my enemy.**

**But ever since that day when you were taken away from me, I couldn't help but feel the need to defeat them.**

**I wanted you back... no matter what."**

By now everyone should have gotten the feeling that the true relationship that this show is about, is the bond between our two Nana's. This is by far the most interesting relationship in the show, but today we get a glimpse of the one I feel is also incredibly interesting: the relationship between Layla and Takumi. 

From Layla's side, things are the most simple, which isn't saying much. She loves Takumi and it's not just some whimsical crush: she is utterly and completely in love with him. We also see a side to Layla that we haven't seen in full detail yet in that she might just be the member of our cast with the least amount of self-worth, even less than Hachi. Speaking of Hachi, her and Layla have way more in common than any other pairing in the show. 

Anyway, Layla is amazingly insecure and considers herself worthless except for her talent in singing, so much so that she fears Takumi might leave her behind if she can't sing anymore. The poor girl is scared out of her mind that without her singing she will be left with nothing.

Now we look at the other side and things get fascinating. I think Takumi knows everything I've just said. He knows Layla loves him. He knows what he's doing to her is wrong. And I also believe he knows how desperate Layla really is about herself. 

He says he doesn't love her. I don't buy it. First of all, Ren doesn't believe him either. Secondly, it is undeniable that they have a strong bond, he admits so himself. And lastly, remember when Layla cried about the song she had to write lyrics to, saying it was beautiful and emotional, praising Ren? Well Ren might have written it in a literal sense, but it's Takumi's song. In the same episode, Ren says he writes songs according to Takumi's instructions. He's the one supporting Layla, not Ren. 

Sure, Takumi is keen enough to see that Layla is the linchpin of the success of the band, but I don't think that's the only reason he needs her. There is more to the story than that and I think Layla is one of the biggest reasons for Takumi doing the things he does. 

That relationship aside, we get to see a glimpse of Nobu again! All rejoice in happiness... probably not. Not Nobu's fault though. What is his fault, is that he's throwing in the towel. Saying Hachi loved Takumi all along, pitying himself... the guy has no trust in his virtues as a person and in the bonds he forms. I think he could still win Hachi back if he were just willing to fight. But he simply does not have the strength of will for that. 

Nana O scolds him for it, although lovingly. But leave it to her to make the wrong decision based on emotional impulses. Nobu and Hachi are over and through a misguided sense of fidelity towards Nobu she decides to not make up with Hachi. I get it, in a way, but if there is anything she should have learned is not to act rashly while not in a calm state of mind. I fear she might regret it, sooner or later. 
>> ARTICLE
Takumi's becoming more likable as the series goes on, mostly because both us and the other characters now understand his priorities. First work, then little Sachiko (which is a hilariously awful name for Hachi's sake), then Hachi herself.

I'm enjoying the interaction between Shin and Reira, even though she has yet to reply. She's still hung up on Takumi for a while, but I think Shin's wise enough to be patient with her.

Mari shows hidden depths with her law school background! I like her too. And that sets up the little interaction between Nana and Yasu where they state what I'm guessing was already known between them. It's looking more likely that they might end up together before we're through. From the start of the series Ren's been more distant from Nana, even after they were reunited, and I can't help but feel that he'll eventually leave her again.

Ending with Starless Night again is a good choice (edit: though maybe not the intended one?), with all the talk of looking up at the stars in this episode. Nana's reminded of Ren, Shin's reminded of Reira. Tying them together through that theme, are both of those couples doomed to failure?
>> ARTICLE
> Takumi's becoming more likable as the series goes on, mostly because both us and the other characters now understand his priorities.

Understandable to a degree. He still thinks that supplementing Hachi is to shower her in material things that she's always wanted/believes what a relationship should be, without any emotion involvement. 
>> ARTICLE
So is just me, or are Nana's prologue/epilogue narrations a lot easier to understand?
Hachi kind of waxes poetic I guess.

* Hah, yeah the Yakuza analogy fits Takumi.
* Awww, poor Stella.
* So she actually is wearing the glasses for show, pfft.
* Hahahahaha. Sachiko.
* Hachi's man trouble has rubbed off on Nana.
* Shin's emails are pretty long-winded - takes a whole episode to read.

Ends with "a little pain" again (or it should, rather). Is that Reira calling to Shin this time, "I'm here waiting for you?" Or maybe just his lighter is there waiting for him.
>> ARTICLE
> So is just me, or are Nana's prologue/epilogue narrations a lot easier to understand?

Not just you, Nana's pretty blunt about these things.

I thought he was sending a series of emails? Or I just missed that it was the same one each time.

> I thought he was sending a series of emails? Or I just missed that it was the same one each time

It's a series of e-mails. They've been at the camp for X days and he's sending them each day (I presume).

"The fatal flaw in my plan"?  We talkin' about the "get Nana K back" plan or the "use the press frenzy to hype the band" plan?

Bread for breakfast?  How about some damn bacon and eggs?  Jeez, live a little!

Huh, so the Takumi/family visit's happening after all.  It seems like they already know what Takumi he is.  That means we won't get to see (as much of) a freakout when he shows up.  Aw.  :/

Nana K biting her tongue when her sister gives Takumi the benefit of the doubt.  At least I think that's what that was.

Reira seems to oddly identify with this "Stella".  Is there really a Stella at all?

Training camp for Blast?  That's kind of a hilarious concept in itself.  Not very punk, guys!  And then it turns out everything Nana O cooks comes out too salty.  She really should stop smoking

Aha, the idea of having Misato as a manager is brought up explicitly.  I once suggested that Nana K should do that.  What might have been!  Also, this Ginpei manager guy seems to be the same VA I recognize but can't pin down as the paparazzo.  Argh.  *[Goes off to search the Web to settle the question once and for all]*  Richard Ian Cox!  Voice of Inuyasha!  Too bad no one in the show is named Kagome, then I'd have gotten it instantly.

It seems pretty clear by now Shin's fallen for Reira, despite his pretending, and the lack of saying explicitly.  This device of showing his emails kinda worries me.  Is Gaia (and by extension, the media shit-stirrers) seeing all these emails, surreptitiously?

Mari's a lawyer by trade too?  Interesting.  And she deftly brushed off the question of why someone like her would end up gofering for a band.  I sense hidden depths.

Time once again for Fun With Subs Vs. Dubs!

>Dub:

>>[Reira]:  "How did I get stuck in a band with guys who hit on every girl they see?  You're pigs!"

>Sub:

>>[Reira]:  "Why do all our members try to seduce every woman they see?!  **Are you Italian?!**"

>Heh!

This is kind of a lot of discussion around the mechanics of Yasu's lawyer status.  Suspicious.

Ah, that lighthearted music when Takumi gets back to the apartment.  Seems like forever since we've heard that.  And if Takumi seems to have some serious pickpocket skills.  Credit where it's due, though  he straight-up says 90% of him is all about the business of the band, meaning everything else (including Nana K and the baby) will be a vastly distant second.  No one can say he didn't warn her.

So all this time, Reira's not replied to any of Shin's emails?  That ain't so good.

Now we have both Ren and Nana O feeling an emotional distance from one another.  And finally this low simmer between Nana O and Yasu comes to the fore too.  Add to that the publicity stunt fallout and I think we all see where this is headed.

Haaah, Nana K torpedoed herself on this baby name business.

Wait, what?  Different ending, but back to the old song?

>> ARTICLE
> "The fatal flaw in my plan"? We talkin' about the "get Nana K back" plan or the "use the press frenzy to hype the band" plan?

'Get Hachi Back.'

She says all this, but doesn't actually consider Hachi's feelings, or the position she's in already. One again Nana's dominance over those close to her rears its head.
>> ARTICLE
Naoki, that was some serious talk for about a second on how Ren should forget Nana... because she puts too much salt in his miso soup. This is why you are so amazing, Naoki. I want you and Yasu to have a spin-off serious where you guys live together. Like Sienfeld, but better.

Reira using Stella as a soundboard for her own feelings towards Takumi. That candle has been aflame for a long, long time. At least Shin is there to distract her, e-mailing her his going-ons, creating a communication between the two of them.

Oh man, I love BLAST's manager. He resonates really well with the band, and just generally feels like a good fit.

It's interesting, that from both bands, we get little insights into the production and sales of bands in Japan (if any of it is true or now).

The rumor about Yasu and Nana hit Ren right in the gut. It looks like that has always been a fear of his, especially since he left them behind. Interesting to see a well established celebrity fearful of loosing someone because he's not close enough to them constantly.

Now Reira jumps to the same conclusion as Ren, thinking all of this is just for Nana's sake, even changing his mind (and their break up). Always thought he broke it off with Reira because he knew he couldn't be the one that'd make Reira truly happen, support her and help her get back Takumi. Though he broke it off for her sake, more than his own.

At least Takumi lays it out there for Hachi, stating that work will always be a priority, although the child and Nana come second. Sadly he said women, not in the context of his soon-to-be-wife and child...

Sachiko rears her ugly head once more.

Interesting way of confessing, with Nana calling him out. Of course you feel lonely and distant to Ren, back home he was your everything, but now you are growing, and on your own journey. Only Nana can make Nana happy, along with some Hachi and Yasu.

**"Hey Hachi. Humans are such pathetic creatures. The harder they struggle, the deeper they sink. If I were to be reborn again, I want to be fish. Ren and I, just the two of us would swim in a small fish tank"**

The tables in our relationships are turning: what was strong now appears weak and what looked fragile grows stronger. But it's important to see why. 

The relationship between Ren and Nana has always been a peculiar one. The one thing that can be said with certainty is that it's intense: it's clear as day that they can't live without each other. 
But it's also clear that their relationship is not all that healthy. 

The root cause of all that is that the driving factor behind their relationship is not love, at least, not love as it should be: pure, without restrictions and mutual. Instead, their relationship is founded on an intense need for love (OP1 rears its head again). They are entwined through that mutual need, both seeing a kindred soul with a huge hole that needs to be filled. The problem being that neither have enough love to give to fill their holes, which is why they are not happy and complete together, but even more empty and lost without each other. 

On the other hand we see Layla and Shin, who are also both individuals with a strong need, though I'd say their need is more of a need to be valued for who they are rather than the stronger need for unconditional love Ren and Nana face. 

The key difference is precisely the depth of that need and the corresponding (in)ability to give. Relationships, especially romantic ones, are balancing acts where the people involved should give and take more or less equally. With Shin and Layla, we see the possibility for that balance to work out. But with Ren and Nana, their personalities are so unbalanced it is very hard to see it succeed. 

That unbalanced personality of Nana O is why she is so drawn to Hachi, to the point of obsession. Hachi is someone who despite all her faults draws people towards her by always giving off energy and love. She is similarly unbalanced and runs into many troubles because of it, but exactly to the opposite side with respect to Nana O. And for that reason the relationship between the two is so important: Hachi is the only one that can balance the scale with Nana O.

The one Nana needs in her life isn't Ren, nor even Yasu, who could never provide enough love for her. The one Nana needs by her side is Hachi.  
>> ARTICLE
Don't care about anything else in this episode, because [Miu](https://41.media.tumblr.com/953de46ec7de292c33d1b88f85cac986/tumblr_n93b5hqqvS1ts2fqoo1_500.png) made her entrance, and she is splendid. Come on, more of her.

There was also the whole Nana having a panic attack and hyperventilating due to fearing not being able to have Hachi back in her life; as connections between the two of them are becoming fewer and fewer. Good thing Yasu and Miu are there.

And Takumi politely going to see Hachi's family, winning them over with expensive gifts and silver tongued words. The only glimpse of realism is him talking about his family. Interesting to see an insight into how he's been shaped to a degree to his emotionally detached person. A whole lot of resentment towards his family, and how he himself is tarnished by his own father.

Hachi can see that the laughter Takumi has is somewhat genuine; as Nana also pointed out, people from horrible homes/lack of family always strive to be around a family that's actually warm and happy. Little bit of understanding for Takumi, and compounding what Jun-chan said about needing to make Takumi feel loved, welcomed, etc... in the home (she said that, right?).

Still acts like he does with every other interaction. A lot of platitudes and politeness, no much realism.

Ren messed up in the bathtub. Sounds like he's been on something for quite some time, and Nana doesn't even know about it, nor a lot of people. Interesting to see the relationship between Reira and Ren. There's love there, but not in a romantic sense. Can't really put my finger on it.

But I digress: Miu! So happy right now. :) :)
>> ARTICLE
Miu seems really interesting! 

> hyperventilating due to fearing not being able to have Hachi back in her life

Unexpected for me, I know they're close and formed a friendship but that's a bigger reaction then I thought!

I was so scared...a lot of stuff were going well so I thought they'd introduce that to shake things up haha

Reply received from Reira. Nearly as long-winded as Shin's, but not quite.

* Woo, I finally get to see Nami's reaction. Pretty funny, but too bad it doesn't show the moment she first sees him.
* Ren's surprisingly fragile. I thought he was the most dependable person in Trapnest, but Reira really steps up as well.
* Haha, love hotel. That could be convenient.
* Pfft, wonder how much [Norio Wakamoto](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=954) got for that single line as Gaia's president.
* That ~~porn~~ girl's seen some shit.

Looks like we'll be cycling through the ending songs in these last few episodes. "Starless Night" is back for this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Nana K's still so secretive and/or shame-filled about Nobu.  Never does reply to him, either.

Ah, ok.  I guess that was all one big email from Shin last time.  And now we get the symmetrically big email from Reira back.  They both get so poetic in them, too.

Heh, Nami freaking out.  No one else seems to, though.

Wait, what?  Takumi's 6'1"??  Are you really Japanese, man?  Guy knows how to lay on the charm for the family, though.

Doesn't take much criticism of Nana O's singing to get under her skin!

So Takumi's family's almost as messed-up as Shin's.  Those two should compare notes.

Not sure I get what's up with Ren drinking himself into a stupor and passing out in the tub.  I don't remember him being too much of a drinker up to this point

Haha, Ai Yazawa gave herself a trashy romance novel credit.  Not clear on whether Shin requested Mika to buy him an erotic novel or she volunteered.

"I almost wish [Ren]'d just leave me alone if he can't give me all his attention."  You're one to talk, Nana O!

Whoa, even the illustrious Nana O is taken aback by how hot this Yuri is.

Nobu's very understandably trying to cut himself off from the painful memory of Kana K.  But it seems to induce a mini panic attack with Nana O.  By this point it almost seems like the two worlds of the two Nanas are nearly perforated into being completely separate.  Nana O seems to feel somewhere in her soul that Nana K is very important to stay connected to, despite the gradually increasing distance between them.  I guess her abandonment issues are really powerful, hidden though they are under the surface.

Who the heck was that chick outta nowhere with the hyperventilation diagnosis?

>> ARTICLE
Hah, Nobu's not completely done with Hachi yet... or maybe he is, after she didn't reply to him by the time they got back to Tokyo.

Aww, Reira's replying to Shin in kind. I wonder if it's a proper conversation or if it was just a bunch of emails from Shin followed by a bunch of emails from Reira.

Whee Takumi getting grilled by Hachi's dad. This is fun! I like that she gets a little insight to Takumi's past by comparing him to Nana, she's finally maturing and thinking about others.

Both Ren and Nana aren't doing too well. Again, I don't think they're staying together through the end of the series.
>> ARTICLE
> Both Ren and Nana aren't doing too well. Again, I don't think they're staying together through the end of the series.

Food wins over any negative feelings at the time, especially when you're hangry.

Misato to the rescue, supporting them anyway she can, and easily moving past any questions about her personal life.

Nobu can resist the sushi though, and Yasu is just as suspicious as Nobu about all this leaked information and drama, only difference being Yasu will use it to rocket Nana and the other band members to the spotlight they deserve, by any means. 

I like the contrast between himself and Takumi. They are both the business behind the band, and both put on a stoic front, by Yasu actually cares about them on a deeply personal level, where most of the time Takumi only cares about the brand, the name, and not the people wholeheartedly (besides Reira).

Hachi trying her best to patch things up, while on the other end we have Reira teaching Takumi about his other woman in England. Little childish, for a spurred love interest, Reira. :(

Little heart-to-heart with over beers between Nobu and Nana. I like that she apologizes to Nobu about herself and her actions. She rarely does that with anyone, and I think it's a great indicator to their solid friendship.

Hachi and Nobu thinking about each other, still. Even when someone hurts you in the worst way, love sometimes never dies, and now they've turned to getting Hachi back.

Gaia immediately throwing down the gauntlet, releasing BLAST's new single against Trapnests'.

Hachi don't take no insult to her woman!

I'm not convinced he cares about her that much personally either, just as the singer and thus the band's keystone.  And he knows about her feelings, so he goes a little more out of his way to try to make her feel better.

So.  Looks like a "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" situation.  Or, in this case, when life gives you shit, make fertilizer.  (And make your own flowers bloom!)

Well, looks like the plan of making Blast the talk of the town (nation?) certainly worked.  Too bad we don't get any scenes inside Search Magazine to see the evil glee.

Kawano seems like a good guy.  But he's in a slimy industry.

Misato's back!  And looking more Shirley Temple-esque than ever.  Poor girl seems to be not only an unpaid servant for them, but is actually sacrificing her own life and spending her own money for the privilege.

"Super fancy sushi!"  Knowing almost nothing about sushi, I wonder how one can tell

"Is this what the major labels are like?"  Shitty, you mean?  Yes.  Very yes.  I've never been involved in the music business and I coulda toldja that, Nobu.

"If we're gonna be on a major label, it's best to deal with one that gives us loads of money for production and promotion."  Pretty much the *only* reason to be on a major label.  You could create music, play gigs, and make your own recordings forever on your own.  The label is there to push you on a grand scale.  And to wring money for themselves out of the bargain.

"Stella", eh?  Dollars to doughnuts we get an eyeful of Stella quite soon.  And Reira needling Takumi about her is adorable!

"The three of us are gonna be one happy family!"  , dammit!

She had to finally *ask* for a ring.  Smooth, Takumi.  :/

Hm.  We all thought the Nana K/Nobu thing was over and done with.  (I did, anyway.)   But apparently not.  Now even Nana O is on board with forcing that 'ship.  And the door is indeed open a crack, if it's any indication that Nana K is musing that her time with him was the happiest she's ever been.  Making it happen would be *super* painful for Nana K, I fear.

Whoa.  She went back home after all!  Video clerk guy is a blast (heh) from the past.

Huh, right you are, one of my previous comments acknowledged 2001.  How did I get shifted off by one?  Weird.

At any rate, that means my other call-out of 9/11 actually was relevant.  Looking it up now, the show aired in 2006/2007, so it's not like they were writing before the shown dates, yet there's not a mention of it despite explicitly showing that date.  Weird.

From what I can tell, its about two girls, both named nana living together in Tokyo.


Nana k. Is overtly eccentric, and is described as a lost puppy with how she interacts with people(positive but clingy). Before she moved to Tokyo, she had a history a poor of relationships. She finds a BF who is moving to Tokyo for school, and a year later she follows to be with him.


Other nana is a goth looking chick with all the personality of raven from teen titans, but is a pretty decent singer. She had a shitty home life. Started dating this one guy who was a lead singer in a band. They move in together, he gets a job offer (as a guitarist or whatever) in Tokyo and leaves. A yearish later she goes to Tokyo to try and make it as a singer.


Both Nana's meet eachother for the first time on the train to tokyo and get acquainted but split soon after getting to Tokyo. They both meet again when they find a cheap apt, and decide to become room mates.


Thats pretty much everything from episode 1-6. Watch them if you want, but I found them to be boring AF. But it picks up afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
I felt episodes 1-6 needed to happen in order to establish both Nana's backstories and so you can feel for them later on (i just started episode 7) when either shit hits the fan or they just need support.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think that establishing character like that is necessary. You can judge how a character is just by watching the story unfolds without the plot telling you. That being said, what they did wasn't wrong, its just that they could have made the exposition shorter for what little content it had.


But if the was something specific that happens and is later reincorporated, that would be necessary. On ep 11 as of now
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I missed the part in your previous post where you said you were only at episode 10. That explains your annoyance at the flashbacks. Keep watching, the events in those episodes are definitely relevant in the remainder of the show!
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it was also just a way to show how they got to where they are now without it starting off as a highschool anime?

And true, I'm still on episode 7 (might watch a bit at work) so I dont know how much the story plot'll unfold in the later episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't mind a slow start much, as long as it leads to something.

Romance series. Supposed to be a fairly good one without much of the forced drama that a lot of series pull. I'm in the process of watching it for the first time so I don't have much detail to give. 
>> ARTICLE
Just based off that it sounds right up my alley.
>> ARTICLE
The animation is a little wonky to me, but I'm still enjoying it so far. 

There's also a rewatch going on right now that you could join in. I think they're only on episode 3 or 4 so now would be a good time to hop in.

Shoujo anime about a small-town girl from Hokkaido who moves to Tokyo on little more than a whim. Here she ends up becoming flat mates with a goth-rock musician trying to make a name for herself in the big city, who she met on the train to Tokyo, and who shares her name: Nana (#TitleDrop).

Nana's strength is definitely that it's not afraid of handling mature themes that other anime tends to shy away from, or even ignore exist. That means it actually feels a lot more connected to real life than your average SoL.
>> ARTICLE
It's more realistic than most real shows. A bit angsty, but amazingly good. Well worth the watch if you enjoy drama in general.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sold, I'll try to make some time to watch it, at least bit by bit.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like I'm joining the rewatch then.
>> ARTICLE
Yes! We'll be glad to have you!
>> ARTICLE
First the re-watch, now this. Feeling like this is a great week. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Nana yesterday. I feel lost. 
>> ARTICLE
Great. I ran out of stuffs to watch recently and now Nana is on Netflix the day before I left the state for vacation. Guess I have to wait a little longer to watch it then.
>> ARTICLE
Netflix has really been expanding their anime collection recently. It seems like a new show is being added every month or even sooner. I wonder what sparked this recent interest of adding more and more anime for the company. Well, I guess being one of the few legal places to watch anime does help with getting those subscriptions. I hope this trend continues! 
>> ARTICLE
The cynic in me believes that somebody from Netflix is keeping tabs on reddit activity and they add shows we're attracting attention to so they get viewership. I mean, a 9 year old *josei* anime gets added the day after our rewatch starts? C'mon, you don't need a tinfoil hat to link those two together!
>> ARTICLE
If that is the case then thank you secret Netflix employee! Where ever you are! Keep the anime coming!
>> ARTICLE
...or maybe they just worked out a deal with Viz Media to include more anime shows that they license, since Moribito was added as well.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, that makes too much sense, man...
>> ARTICLE
For some reason I couldn't get into Nana. Not sure why. But I'm glad for everyone that did enjoy it that it's back on Netflix. Maybe I'll watch it again and try to look at it with more of an open mind. 
>> ARTICLE
If you do decide to try again, please do join our rewatch! 
>> ARTICLE
Totally, I'm game. Thanks! I just need to keep an eye out for the rewatch thread. 
>> ARTICLE
Million dollar question!

Should i watch it dubbed or subbed? :)
i'm so excited about this Anime
>> ARTICLE
Hey there! I'm hosting the NANA rewatch going on right now and I'm watching the dub this time around. I have to say that the dub is really well done, so just watch whichever you feel more comfortable with. We are only on the second episode, so feel free to join in on our discussions!
>> ARTICLE
Great! thanks, think i go for the dub aswell then.
>> ARTICLE
Yes!!!! I never got around to finishing this show back when I was watching it and I could never find a place that was streaming it that I was familiar with, so this I'm glad I can finally finish this show.
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching this anime, I'm up to episode 14. I'm really enjoying this anime so far, and the characters are pretty great with a small exception to the main Nana. But every time Nana narrates the beginning and ends of every episode, I feel sad, like something terrible is going to obviously happen and I feel like this anime will prolly leave some void in me because I like the two of them together. :(
>> ARTICLE
Sweeeet, now I don't have to suffer through Hulu's ads (and my annoyingly outdated Media Hint)
>> ARTICLE
This is fantastic news!
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't sleep last night dreaming about what happens after it really got me ticked off tho when they should a flash back of the "future" and then boom last episode they're at the fireworks show...but I really do hope that the author will be making more episodes espicially since she's sick actually has any one heard ANY news on that because I read some where that a man and a woman I guess age her co-workers said "in the future I can see new episodes of nana and that dont hold ur breath that there won't be any new episodes out for a long while....please say something some one
