Saitama having Genos trash talk for him was hilarious.

Specials come out starting December 24. That's not even 4 days from now.

Wipe your tears, it's not over yet.

[Also, ONE's tweet about the episode.](https://twitter.com/ONE_rakugaki/status/678616210934665217) "It was ridiculously good. That was amazing."
>> ARTICLE
Man, he must be so freaking elated at watching this.
>> ARTICLE
Next manga chapter is also gonna be released Dec. 24. The anime may finished but the manga is still going strong. I'm super glad that the Boros scene animated encouraged Murata to start pumping out the chapters faster so we have enough content for season 2. This is the second time an anime was so good that I read the manga since I didn't want to wait next week to see what happened. The manga is a 10/10 and has the same pacing and comedy we love the anime for having, definitely read the manga, the arcs after Boros are SO GOOD.

Imagine how awesome this feels for ONE. Your webcomic you do for fun gets adapted by a high profile manga artist and then it gets an anime? He's come a long way, I'm glad Murata enjoyed ONE's simple little webcomic enough to redraw it. Without that, we wouldn't have a manga or an anime and nobody would know who Saitama is.

This anime was amazing.

**SERIOUS PUNCH** > Collapsing Star Planet Buster Meteor Burst Roaring Cannon

all these crazy moves and none of the heros on the ground noticed anything? Saitama got shot to the fucking moon.

Just a normal day with Saitama.

Dude, they did the moon perfectly. No real sound took he jumped. Details
>> ARTICLE
For a second I thought he was gonna break it from the force of his jump.
>> ARTICLE
Well, he did calculate how much force to use by tossing that moon rock up for a few seconds.
>> ARTICLE
How did he only score 26 on his intelligence test?

They noticed when Saitama came back from the moon the ship fell, but they thought it was Tatsumaki.

She knows there's something going on with Saitama, but that's it.
>> ARTICLE
The ship was pretty ginormous, and everyone else was directly underneath the giant ship.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I actually thought this was pretty clever way for the fight to play out without Saitama being noticed, the giant maze does an awesome job at showing how crazy huge the ship is.

Also, ya know, that fact that it was as big as an ENTIRE CITY.

I love comics like these where the characters are watching their own anime. It's even more awesome that the two creators doing something like that.

Murata, like Genos, is a very eager worker, and talented in what he is doing, but One is the raw super-talent who spouts his genius around with no effort, like Saitama. Could it be that Murata is looking up to One as Genos is looking up to Saitama?

I like what they did with the moon scene. In the manga you can see what Saitama thinks, while in the anime it's complete silence. The manga was funnier while the anime had more atmosphere. That's why it's best to know both versions.

I like how he was playing with the moon rock, as if seeing stuff in low gravity was the coolest thing that's happened to him today.

*"Look at how slowly it falls!  Ah well, I guess I better get back to that alien ship that's ravaging the city..."*
>> ARTICLE
I believe the playing with the moon rock was there to visualize that he considered the lower gravity for his jump back to earth, because the anime didn't had Saitamas thoughts.
>> ARTICLE
Obviously calculating the amount force he needs to use to get back without causing a mass extinction on earth.
>> ARTICLE
Actually wouldn't the Anime have less atmosphere?^Because^^he's^^^on^^^^the^^^^^moon
>> ARTICLE

I liked that they had Saitama do things like tossing a moon rock up to see the weight difference. Sad he didn't bring the rock with him, though. He could've gotten a huge amount of fortune compared to the pebble he lost in the parking lot.

Edit: forgot a word.
>> ARTICLE
I thought he was gonna throw it from the moon at Boros.

I liked the anime adaptation more. They did a really good job of showing Saitama's thought process without having him monologue.
>> ARTICLE
Show, don't tell. 
>> ARTICLE
That's something anime is generally *horrible* at, so it's all the more impressive. 
>> ARTICLE
It's funny how this is Saitama's attitude in general. Always telling people dumping exposition to shut up and be more concise.
>> ARTICLE
I love how taken back the monologuers are. They know they're powerful, but are at a loss of words when Saitama brushes them off. Like they want to say something *else* now, but... they can't.

Haha, totally. Saitama just derails the thought-train and they can't get back on the track.

Man, I still prefer the translation ''Handsomely Masked Sweet Mask''.

They do translate it like that, it's just that they don't use that all the time. They only sometimes actually say "ikemen kamen amai mask". Otherwise it's just "amai mask".

A sad ending for both fighters. Boros just wanted a fair, and even a challenging fight. But all he got for searching the universe for 20 years is getting squished like a bug.

Saitama, anticipating a real fight for the first time in his life after being a hero, was disappointed after being shown his enemies' extent of abilities. Seriously, the part where he went ***"Shut up."*** isn't a face of annoyance, but utter disappointment. In the end, no one really won that fight.

As expected, Madhouse fucking delivered on the final episode. Animation, OP song insert, and sound design were fucking amazing. I can't wait to get my hands on the BD's to see an ever better version of that (and hopefully, better animation for certain episodes). I hope someday we get to see One Punch Man S2. You all anime-only's are missing out on King, Garou, Metal Bat, and that sweet, sweet Fubuki booty.

Not only that, Boros was fighting across the universe looking for strong opponents and Saitama was the strongest he ever faced, making it even less likely Saitama.has a chance of a real fight.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, the reason the battle dragged for so long was probably because Saitama was dealing with the fact that it was just another easy fight and maybe sympathy towards another overpowerfull being that got bored of his own power.


It's also touching how Saitama tried to lie to Boros saying they both gave their all just to give him a fulfilling death, but Boros could easily tell he wasn't even trying. In the end none of them got the glorious deathbattle they wished for.

>> ARTICLE
It would've been pretty funny if Boros had become Saitama's disciple
>> ARTICLE
[yes](http://i.imgur.com/ONFWxT9.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
The greatest part about of this episode for me was how Boros finally found what Saitama had been looking for. Near the end of the battle the same music Saitama had during his dream-fight with the Subtarraneans kicks in, and when he uses his planet ending attack the sort of "coming alive" heartbeat Saitama felt in the same dream happened...except it was Boros' heart instead. Boros was experiencing the fantasy Saitama could only dream about.

It's sort of sad actually, because Saitama felt nothing. He may have even been a little jealous, since Boros was able to go all out, and he knew he could have ended the whole thing in one shot from the beginning.  
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved this part. In addition after he lands and the music starts playing, when Boros narrows his eyes and says "This man.. makes me wanna go all out!" the way he runs towards Saitama is exactly the same way Saitama ran toward the Subterranean king right before his dream ended, starting slow then picking up pace. These parts were an amazing parallel.
>> ARTICLE
> It's sort of sad actually, because Saitama felt nothing

the after credits scene gives a different impression than this. although saitama didn't get to feel the rush of going all out, he still found a fight that wasn't completely boring. he had to throw out a number of punches, including a serious one, which he maybe has never done before.
>> ARTICLE
I love that Saitama tried to preserve that for him by lying though. He actually lied to make his enemy feel better about the fight. What a guy.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed. The line

>You lie

And then Saitamas look. Chills. Coupled with music and you really start to feel sorry for him. Saitama waited so long and even tho he quickly noticed that this match wouldnt turn out to be his 'life saver' he still allowed Boros to have at least his part of fun, and played punch bag as long as he could (the moment boros was about to unleash power that was threathing the area he had to end it). 

And then he even said

>Yeah it sure was.

Liar. ;_; Wanna give him a hug

>> ARTICLE
> the sort of "coming alive" heartbeat Saitama felt in the same dream happened...except it was Boros' heart instead. Boros was experiencing the fantasy Saitama could only dream about.

That gave me chills. This is something that the manga didn't even have, and I'm glad they added in such a unique portrayal of the thrill of battle (albeit one wasn't real). Maybe one day it will finally come around full circle, where Saitama finds someone else extremely stronger than him, feeling excitement from it, and only to get crushed without effort. It's the only happy ending I can imagine.

Farewell [Caped Baldy and Blond Cyborg](http://i.imgur.com/Qdx9kAE.jpg), until season 2.
>> ARTICLE
I cried for Boros. Guys this is cheating he is too strong.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
My only complaint about this adaption was that it ended on the Boros arc and not the arc after; the Boros arc, despite how epic the fight is, is actually more of a buildup arc that introduces a lot of new characters and plot lines that come into relevance  later on in the story. That's also why Genos had a much smaller role in this arc than the previous ones. 

Also, running some quick calculations with the [volume release dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_One-Punch_Man_chapters), it took around two years for the 7 volumes needed for one season to be possible. Extrapolating, it would take another two years (roughly) for another season. But that would suck, as that season would end in the middle of an arc, so they would probably try to adapt 24 episodes, which would take another two years. They can probably start the adaptation a bit earlier, so we could potentially see a second season in 3-4 years. 

**THIS IS NOT AN ACCURATE PREDICTION, JUST SOMETHING TO GET SOME DISCUSSION GOING**

The only way for a quicker release would be to adapt the webcomic directly instead of the manga, which I hope they won't do. Besides the fact that the anime's main purpose is advertising the manga and boosting sales, the webcomic is going to be missing out one some spectacular manga-only content.

>> ARTICLE
Murata did say he's trying to speed up how quickly he can put out new chapters because the anime was too good. Depending on what else he's working on, it should be much less than 4 years.
>> ARTICLE
I think this was the perfect ending for season 1. 
>> ARTICLE
yes, saitama is still OPM (compared to what people said last week... that he didnt one punch boros... pfft)

yes, the manga and webcomic is still ongoing and translated by fangroups, manga is currently during garou arc (with metal bat being one of my fav S Rank hero), webcomic is currently at saitama vs [](/s "tatsumaki"), [](/s "or at least they just finished.")

just checked, next arc starts with mangachapter 37, though i recommend reading from the beginning, since there are sidestories added by murata, which will probably not animated anytime soon. updates are... biweekly to once every 2 months...

also, the manga adds few scenes compared to the webnovel ([](/s "like the current encounter garou vs metalbat and seniour centipide raging 1000-7"). if you caught up to date with manga, it continues in webnovel with chapter 53, start from chapter 52 for context.

This is literally the best adaptation of a manga I've ever seen.

Question here, but what if Boros' hit didn't send Saitama RIGHT to the moon? It's a pretty big coincidence given how big the sky is (unless Saitama directed himself to go there somehow). If Saitama was hit just into the void of space he basically would've died since he can't breathe right?

The other question: how crazy is Saitama's aiming power? He hit the center of a (admittedly 15-km-long) ship by jumping. From the moon.

I woke up at 6 AM to watch this episode.

Loved it! The fight was really amazing. It ended quickly than I imagined but it was really awesome. I would still vote the Subterraneans fight as the #1 animated fight.

The S Class heroes are pretty nice too. I thought they'd be a bit more helpless but they turned out pretty strong.

I like how they talked about Metal Knight. It gives hints of a sequel, which obviously should be made.

ONE PUUUNNNCCHHH!

Its quite a reflection of human nature. We work so hard to get everything we want, but once we have too much of it, we no longer see how precious it is and we finally see the realization and emptiness of acquiring something we desired and no longer be able to find any further satisfaction. The lonely feeling of being at the top and lack of any further purpose for existence.

Did that loli figure think that she did not bring down the ship? She was questioning Saitama on why he was on the ship. So she kinda knows he did some major damage or something from the look of her expression when she saw the ship going down.

Amazing fight scene. I thought that Saitama was tanking the fight and not doing anything the first time I watched it but if you watch the fight on youtube from when the theme music plays, the 2 seconds of normal speed footage is made of 1 frame clips that show Saitama punching/blocking and dodging Boros's attacks, and Boros blocking a couple of punches! I completely missed it until I a youtube clip at 0.25 speed.

With all the action on the ship I'm surprised Tatsumaki is presumably the only S-class hero that really had an idea of the fight going on. Now we wait for season 2.

In the manga though Lord Boros mentioned anaerobic exercise more than once which is funny and am I the only one who finds it funny that he compares his power to anaerobic exercise?

Nooo, it's over. Bloody loved that, didn't know anything about it before I watched it so everything was unexpected.

Probably the anime which I've most looked forward to seeing every week and one that I would definitely show to someone who knows nothing about anime or has prejudices against it. And I don't think there's any higher praise than that!!

FUCK CITY A DISAPPEARING! HE DENTED THE MOON!

I think we need another 60+ episodes of OPM. Shit this one season is great but I want more! Why is that Akumai guy such a douchebag and why was Metal Knight an "enemy" of Genos? Is it connected to what happened to him before? And where the fuck is Fubooty that manga readers have been raving about?! I want a piece of that too!

At least he didn't blow it up, like that asshole Piccolo.

The boros fight was the most hyped ever coming into an already hyped series. Everybody kept on saying "just wait until Boros" and "just wait until the last episode." It was a lot of expectation.

And they fucking exceeded it. Wow. Just wow. It sucks so much that we have to wait for a now almost guaranteed season 2, but at least I will be able to watch this last episode over and over again as it had the sickest anime fight I've even seen.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for amazing three months, madhouse , ONE and Murata. This is amazing series and made my Monday much brighter
>> ARTICLE
One thing I noticed is that, right after the meteoric burst, there's wasn't the amazing detailed punch against the pillar/spiky thing Boros threw at Saitama that ended up piercing through his own ship. I guess it got replaced with those nonetheless amazing scenes before the moon kick we didn't get in the mangas anyways so can't complain I guess haha, thought I'd just share:

Rakudai delivered one of the best One-hit kill duel. OPM just deliver the greatest... duel... yet.

You can clearly see where the studio cut corners that's why I'm really hyped for the BD release when they finally add some details and polish some of the plain key frames to perfection.

Really worthy of a rewatch.

This thing is just glorious. Had the passengers behind me during my train commute looking on my smartphone while I replay the freaking fight over and over. Goosebumps.

And the fact that Saitama remains intact while subjected to the vacuum of space speaks volumes of how his body down to his every cell is super tough.

One of these days Saitama, POW! Straight to the moon!!!!  Holy fuck that was AWESOME.  Next to Noragami for me, this is THE show of the season.  Funny, awesome fights, beautiful animation and kicked tons of ass.  I seriously cannot find any flaws with it - a 10 out of 10 show.  Screw marvel and DC, Saitama is the best hero out there :D
>> ARTICLE
**THAT WAS AWESOME!!!!**
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck... this was indeed the show that lived up to the pre-release hype. 

He freaking got punched to the moon, and jumped off of it breaking the surface. How he survived in vacuum? By sheer muscle strength ofc. 

What is up with that douche Amai Mask... He's going to be a villain duo with Metal Knight , isn't he?

Now, excuse me, I'm off to read the manga, while I wait for OPM to release the OST. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, I really loved how they used the track they used in the last fight of the first episode, to show you that this was the kind of fight Saitama wants.

And I'm kinda sad to see that even Boros couldn't entertain Saitama that much, but I guess he did for a moment since we did hear that heartbeat for a moment during the fight.

Man, OPM has been pretty great. ^^^^^Season ^^^^^2 ^^^^^when? ^^^^^:'(
>> ARTICLE
I saw it more as from Lord Boros perspective since the heartbeat was blue instead of red. Saitama was Lord Boros' dream fight that he searched ages for and came true
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that makes a lot more sense, then, cause it did seem like Saitama didn't get what he wanted from that fight, but man, I really loved their interaction at the end, with how Saitama pretended like he gave it his all and all that.

the design of boros is god damn amazing, he has several different forms which are all sick, i hope we get some high quality stills of him soon.

The scene when he was uppercutted to another celestial body could be the best animated scene of 2015. The minor details that Boros punches so hard that he suspends reality around him, hydrogen and nitrogen in the atmosphere quantum frozen out of existence. Boros then his them with so much energy that he creates nuclear fusion, gamma rays disintegrating the ship and disorts the fabric of space around him.

It wasn't an uppercut, it was a knee

Boros was amazing! the way he transforms in seconds to where you don't notice at first but all of a sudden long hair and crazy color.

He survived a final attack from Saitama! He even realized his effort wasn't enough and that Saitama is suffering the same way he was before he arrived.. Truly a great ending to the series.

I like the random night scene they add after Saitama's serious punch. It shows the punch is powerful enough to cause shockwave to the other hemisphere. Those little details really show how much effort they put into this anime.

I don't know if anybody else saw this, but there was an ad at the end of the episode on DAISUKE that said "DAISUKE will continue to support One Punch Man. More info to come."

I don't know about you guys, but that sounds like a very heavy hint at a season 2 being in the works.

Saitama was in real danger in this fight. He can't fly, so if he had missed the moon he'd still be flying through space

So now that the exposition is done and we all the necessary characters are introduced, when do we get the first big story arc? Spring 17?

There HAS to be another season. I can't see it not being planned before the release of the first one, simply due to some unfinished stories, two of which are mentioned in this last episode : Genos vs Metal Knight story and then there is this blue-haired justice freak who didn't want to be S-rank hero, he has some nice potential to be the future bad guy and i just cannot imagine this anime not being continued.

Hearing Amai Mask aka Light Yagami talk about justice and killing evil brought a tear to my eye. 
>> ARTICLE
This show surprised me. 

Good but slow worldbuilding with definite hints to more (and in my oppinion suffering for only having 12 Episodes) going on in the world and especially the "Hero Industry" and somewhat realistic humane reactions "of the masses" if we like it or not. 

The main characters are really cool and despite the joke beeing that Saitama suppossedly no personality i find he haes the best of any hero in recent time. The other characters are okay and designs are neat and i like that there is so much fanservice for the ladies. :-P

The soundtrack was the other thing that really stuck out as great work. One of the few Animes in recent years where the music made me perk up my ears and listen.

I really like the story and the highlight and most intense moment of this show for me was not actualy the last battle but the struggle of the c and a heroes against the Deep Sea King and how Saitama downplayed his strength to honor their sacrifices.

Oh yeah also:

Mumen Rider best girl. 
>> ARTICLE
Sweet baby *Jesus.*

This is probably one of the best things I have witnessed in my life.

Just...absolutely full of hype, excitement, anger, frustration, humor, laughter, sometimes a hint of sadness and loss of direction...*Much like real life.*

I fucking loved this show, but more than that I loved this story, for all that it cannot take itself seriously, it still carries such a powerful message of just that, remarkably enough.

Don't take it all so seriously, and enjoy the ride. The destination is important, but it is no less so than the journey there.

Bravo.

Such a good ending for such a good series, they set a lot of the stuff that would be in season 2 up really well too. As a manga reader who already knew this would be good, the series went above and beyond even my expectations that were already high.

You may STILL feel a bit dissapointed, though, after watching the ending and realizing, like Boros did, that Saitama COULD have one-punched him from the beginning :P

The whole fight was technically 5 moves.  One punch to break his armor, a second one took off his arm, third punch to the stomach, injuring him, the Consecutive Normal Punches, and then the "Serious Punch" to finish it.

Not even. Boros had regeneration. Saitama just kept on seeing how much Boros could take.

I know Mumen Rider doesn't really do anything in this episode but I found this comment on Youtube that was really touching.

"There are two lights in the world. One is the sun, this represents Saitama. It shines so brilliantly that it outshines every other light in the sky. it protects us, keeps us warm, and chases away the darkness that no one else could. We would all be dead without it. The other light is the moon. It will never shine as bright as the sun, not even close. But on a clear night, it shines pure. More pure than any other light. This is the light of a true heroic spirit, one who embodies what it really means to be a hero. This spark, this candle in the darkness, is the piece  of humanity that makes us rise up. The hero inside all of us that makes us become protectors, defenders, heroes. 

Power of a true hero, Spirit of a true hero." -Dakota Berggren

I feel like a lot of people focus on OPM's comedy but if you look past the humor there is a lot of deep and meaningful themes. OPM was truly a fantastic series and will definitely have a spot on my top 5 animes of all time. Hopefully there will be a season 2!

Great anime, I think that it's vastly overrated since it's number 11 on MAL right now but that doesn't change the fact that it's one of the most enjoyable and well produced anime of the year.

12 episodes total? Are we expecting more any time soon?

Me while watching this episode: "HOLY SHIT THE BUDGET, OH GOD THE BUDGET, I'M NOT DESERVING OF THIS".

It was amazing. Hope OPM breaks the Madhouse curse and gets S2.
>> ARTICLE
Budget is actually just average for this series.  If you look beyond the main fight you can see where they cut back.  They concentrated all the money on the Boros fight which is why it looked so good.
>> ARTICLE
No Madhouse curse since Madhouse doesn't decide this.
>> ARTICLE
There are going to be more episodes right???

>> ARTICLE
An amazing series, that finally comes to conclusion. I felt it was magnificent throughout, however, the weak ending brought that down a bit. While giving something a perfect score isn't something to be trifled with, I had mixed emotions about the finale. 
First of all, the entire Boros fight was breathtaking, with a unique approach to the usage of the music for Boros's powering up, and glee in fighting. 
Interestingly noted, Tatsumaki realized it wasn't her doing that the ship went down.
However, the problems lie: When some of the attacks were so powerful that you could clearly see the explosions go off of the sides of the ship, someone must have noticed. Genos and Kid Emperor were clearly at a hightened altitude to notice the explosions of the sides of the ship (though, they were still under the ship, so they wouldnt have seen the earlier attacks that took place on top of the ship). The "Serious Punch" is something that is nearly impossible to not have noticed, and is simply absurd. Boros's attack must have been felt by some, and the energy flew off in two directions off of the ship; Saitama parted the clouds halfway around the world, it is frustrating plot convenience that no one would notice this

Then again, there was a disappointing lack of closure to the arc. Despite noticing Saitama in the ship, and that she did not take down the ship, Tatsumaki never went into detail and the show never took advantage of these facts to build her character, and interaction with Saitama and Genos. I was expecting a bit more of a satisfying summation and settlement of the situation in the show after such a dramatic battle, yet the resolution was lackluster, and all too brief compared. 
While many will attribute this to the show being a Gag manga, it still leaves a slight yearning for more character development and going more in depth into relationships after every battle, something this anime/manga strongly neglects doing, instead preferring to keep it very curt (perhaps too curt)

tl;dr I desire more subtle moments and "wrapping up the situation"
Many may disagree
>> ARTICLE
Tatsumaki was throwing debris at the ship, causing explosions, multiple explosions. Everyone probably assumed that was it making all the noise and quakes. 
>> ARTICLE
I won't lie, the Serious Punch scene was pretty underwhelming.
>> ARTICLE
well it is just a punch after all you cant have fireworks like in the OP,the reason it felt underwhelming is bc saitama still has not put much effort

but after the sea king and boros fight we the viewers can relate with saitamas boring anticlimactic hero life and that it actually sucks 
>> ARTICLE
they made that part go too fast imo. the reason it was so amazing in the manga was because of that page by page build up

The funniest part about this battle is that SAITAMA WON DUE TO EXTREME LUCK.  If the angle of his launch had been off even one degree in ANY DIRECTION, he would have missed the moon and been launched into the endless expanse of space, and died from suffocation.

Boros arc is incredible. It really shows the other side of Saitama's situation. Boros was so strong that no one could pose a threat to him that he went out of his way to find a worthy rival only to be crushed. To really show Boros's strength, it took one punch that didn't even connect to kill Deep Sea King. Boros was the first character to take a fist from Saitama and live. He wasn't even immediately killed off by Serious Series Serious Punch.

Hopefully Murata catches up on the next arc in the manga so we can get Season 2.

It pisses me off how nobody witnessed Saitama destroy the strongest being in the universe. 

"You're just a Class B. How dare you butt in like that?"

Bitch, you and all the heroes combined wouldn't be able to defeat Boros. If Saitama hadn't stepped in, the entire planet would have been annihilated. Saitama doesn't get the respect he deserves, and that depresses me.

(I'm sorry for calling you a bitch Tatsumaki. You're perfect.)

It was everything plus more that the subreddit promised.

This actually lived up to the hype.

Most of the hype came from the fans of the manga. It had some actual reasoning

That plus its a Madhouse adaptation. They've been killing it lately. With the source material it'll be really hard for this series to not continue to live up to the hype.

Madhouse and BONES have been knocking it out of the park every single season recently. I love it.

Thank you for the info! For anyone who knows Japanese [here it is.](http://galaxyheavyblow.web.fc2.com/) You'll likely recognize the plot of [52](http://galaxyheavyblow.web.fc2.com/52.html) if you've been following the manga. It doesn't seem like it was a perfect adaptation, since it seems to be going in a slightly different direction from there.

Also, for anyone that likes english a tad more, you can find it on a site that sounds like balto with the author being ONE. I'm not sure if I can link to it here, despite the original's status as free/unlicensed.

The original has art so bad it's funny. The redraw has art that's so good it's funny.

I just realized we live in a world where One Punch Man and a new Monogatari season are airing at the same time, Kizumonogatari (part 1) just got a release date, Attack on Titan S2 just got a preview, and hell even SAO randomly gets a movie announcement, all in the span of 24 hours. That's excluding all the other greatness that will be airing this season (More Gintama, Haikyuu!! S2, Noragami S2, and more). 

We enjoy a medium where we rarely see a completed story and must suffer as a result, but just this once, I feel pretty damn lucky. 

Also, the animators did this justice, which is very hard to say for One Punch Man.

2016 potentially:

The strangest thing, is that OPM is obviously strong, but there had been many superheroes in other franchises that could do similar things in theory. But due to the level of gore this is never allowed. It's not that OPM's strength is unusual, it is that he was allowed to go all out on enemies instead of any kind of no kill policy. It is however sad that as a result, he had to kill a really hot villainess. Equal opportunity, women are treated the same as men. Being sexy is no reason to keep her alive. But yet, I felt bad.

Madhouse delivers! Even the Opening looks great. It looks like the anime will live up to the large amount of hype and that's no easy feat. It's only the first episode but Madhouse has rarely let us down.

I also read somewhere that some great animators are working on this and every episode will have a lot of action.
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing the opening is based on Saitama's dreams because [spoiler](/s "there's no opponent in the OPM universe that would make him get THAT serious...")
>> ARTICLE
The consecutive normal punches have appeared in battles though.
>> ARTICLE
No I meant Saitama's screaming rage/determination face while throwing a punch
>> ARTICLE
It's funny that people are saying "Madhouse delivers". Some of the best parts of this are from Bones animators (Or at least Bones' regular freelancers). They've gathered some of the best freelancers out there to do work that Madhouse in-house staff just can't.

Well that's what we are thankful to madhouse for, for managing to bring together the best people for the job, that's what an animation studio does anyways.

Everyone has an interesting back story besides OPM. That's kind of funny.


Damn that crab thing got his guts pulled out through his eye hole.


"That guy on your shoulder! Kill him"


The art gets pretty wild for a moment there.


He even kills the alarm clock with one punch.


Wow, that show was really something else. My heart was racing so hard during that fight scene.

I'm aware there was a thread earlier when it pre-aired but I was asked to make a second post for it.

The whole part about him loosing his emotions more and more because he got so strong was missing in leaked version. Which is something i would consider pretty important.

My dick was not prepared. I feel like i need to call my docter it has been over 12 hours
>> ARTICLE
This is the first currently airing anime I've ever watched so I'm pretty happy about that.

I really like the art style and the fight scene was pretty well choreographed and exciting. Kinda reminded me of Birdy the Mighty: Decode in that way. Other than that though, I thought it was ok. I look forward to seeing where this will go but it doesn't seem to have much of a plot yet.

It has a lot of potential but like the main character said, things will get pretty boring if it only takes one punch to defeat all his enemies. I'm willing to bet there will be plenty of enemies that can withstand more than one punch in the future though. 

The music and animation was top notch as was expected from Madhouse.

Overall, I look forward to the next episode but wasn't that impressed by this one.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry this episode covers the first four chapters of the manga which is known for being the most boring part of OPM. It will get more interesting =D
>> ARTICLE
It gets so much better. Although Saitama will continue to take out [](/s "most") monsters in one punch, there is a lot of focus on side characters that will make for longer battles and there is a story element introduced a bit later.

These villians [rival](/s "Samurai Flemenco") in how ridiculous they are.

All that heroing and you still live in such a tiny apartment? You need to start charging bro.

Everything is hype. It's perfect. :,)

This show is where Madhouse will showcase their animator talent. The animation sequences are just nuts. Can't wait to delve into the sakuga we get from this.

O N E P U N C H B O Y S
>> ARTICLE
funny you say inhouse talent when they contracted a lot of freelance animators to do a fair amount of cuts.
>> ARTICLE
!! Did not know that! Fuck in-house talent, this is the industry's best and upcoming talent.

Just soo many good pieces of animation. 
>> ARTICLE
The animators that worked on this show must have had killer credentials. 
>> ARTICLE
**Yoshimichi Kameda:** The best action animator in FMA: Brotherhood and all around genius.

**Yorifumi Kugai:** Relatively young animator with incredible background animation skills. Created stunning work on the first and last episodes of Space Dandy.

**Se Jun Kim:** One of the best effects animators out there (loves beams). Chief Animation Director of Gundam Build Fighters.

**Sushio**: Chief Animation Director for Kill la Kill and effects genius

**Arifumi Imai**: Wit Studio animator known for awesome scenes in Attack on Titan and Rolling Girls. Especially the Titan fight scene in Episode 25.

**Naoki Kobayashi**: A new animator working with MAPPA. Brought on to do incredible fight scenes for Naruto Shippuden. Impressed producers so much that he's now a Animation Director of Boruto: The Naruto Movie.

And that's just what's been worked out so far. You're definitely right about those killer credentials. Right now, One-Punch Man is assembling a star team of animators that's rivaling even Space Dandy. 

Edit: Added a few more interesting names to the ever growing One Punch Man superstars.
>> ARTICLE
wow Madhouse is really going all out getting all these legendary animators for One Punch Man. 
>> ARTICLE
Whichever Madhouse Producer managed to get all these names deserves a goddamn raise.
>> ARTICLE
...and I'll be damned.

If they ever sell a artbook showcasing the keyframes in this anime I might actually buy it considering all the talent put behind this show.

Is there a Wikipedia out there for stuff like this? Y'know, a IMDB for animators?
>> ARTICLE
Kind of! There's multiple resources, but my favourite is the [**SakugaBooru**](http://sakuga.yshi.org/) and then I just find any unfamiliar names on ANN to find any other interesting info.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the episode when it was pre-aired, but it being in HD makes it so much better. My 11 y/o sister loved it, too. She thought that the strangest thing is why all of the villains Saitama fought don't wear pants.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, I'm a believer now. I've been holding off of reading the manga because of the hype for the anime adaptation, and Madhouse knocked it right out of the park. The last type I got this hyped for future episodes of a show is when the newest season of Gintama first aired. 

I feel like Saitama is going to have some freaking brilliant facial expressions in this show given what I've seen in threads over at /r/manga. 
>> ARTICLE
THIS IS AWESOME! i might aswell start the manga now. cant wait for the next episode

>> ARTICLE
Anime of the Decade.

I just realized that [Tada Banri](http://myanimelist.net/people/17635/Makoto_Furukawa) and [Misuo Yanagisawa's](http://myanimelist.net/people/20156/Kaito_Ishikawa) VA's are re-united.

One of the few 10/10, the manga is a monster and the anime looks awesome too.
>> ARTICLE
This is everything I hoped it would be, and more
>> ARTICLE
Is this released on Daisuki?

I can't see the episode!
>> ARTICLE
That most likely means you're in a region they're not simulcasting it in.
>> ARTICLE
Ffffffffuck that sucks.

Daisuki y u do dis to Singapore.
>> ARTICLE
use zenmate on your browser mate and you are good.
>> ARTICLE
VPN bro.
>> ARTICLE
God i'm happy that germany finally gets some love in terms of legal anime streaming. The last few years have been amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I never thought the day would come. This is why I love anime.
>> ARTICLE
This was awesome
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else see the end of the opening matches a certain series of panels from the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap that was incredible, plus that ending tho. School girl wasn't labelled school girl tho, madhouse ruined the adaption. 
>> ARTICLE
Well that was everything I expected and more. Holy shit this is great.  
That dream fight was fantastic, animation, direction, choreography, cinematography, all top fucking notch. I like how they used different animation styles for individual shots, you can definitely tell this was the same director who worked on Space Dandy.  
Right now the only thing that bothers me is how the show just brushes off the deaths of thousands of civilians. Can you really consider yourself a hero if you're barely saving anyone?  
I still feel kinda sorry for One Punch Man though. Being unable to brofist anyone without fear of their arm exploding must be a major downer.
>> ARTICLE
Don't feel sorry. He's always holding back his power. Even when he one punches he's holding back his power. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I'm the only one who laughed when the cities were named with a single letter. 
>> ARTICLE
is it just me or is the kid literally a dickhead??
amazing first episode i don't know how they can top this.
>> ARTICLE
I've heard the opening song before in the promo video, BUT I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST IDEA THAT THE OPENING WOULD BE SO OMFG EPIC!
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't even excited for this but I really enjoyed it. I hated the fact that the coolest part was a dream...
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe that just delivered in literally every single aspect.

And side note, I love how shoujo-y that ED is.
>> ARTICLE
yes i love the ED too. apparently it is sung by the cat
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck that was incredible
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck the animation is incredible, gives me a Gurren Lagann vibe personally 
>> ARTICLE
what the fuck was that car monster LMAO, I definitely don't remember that from the manga
>> ARTICLE
that scene was anime only, thats why in the leaked version that part wasnt translated, theye were just copying the manga
>> ARTICLE
the animation felt more like trigger than madhouse tbh
>> ARTICLE
As awesome as it was to watch episode one again did they change or add anything beside the opening, ending, intermission title cards and next episode preview?

The poor giant brother. Surely he could tell which side of his head his brother's voice was coming from. 
>> ARTICLE
That opening is epic.
>> ARTICLE
I love the transition between awesome face Saitama and bored face Saitama.  It's seamless and works so damn well.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't notice it in reading the manga.  Didn't notice it watching the episode.  I can't believe I just notice, right now, that the brothers are a spoof of the Toguro brothers from Yuu Yuu Hakusho.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I wasn't expecting it to be THAT good. 
HOT DAMN! 
>> ARTICLE
eh. strong showing.
>> ARTICLE
"I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun."

Don't know if metal as fuck or troll as fuck.

Oh wait its Saitama. Definitely troll as fuck.

One Punch Man the anime to watch this season. 10/10 top kek.
>> ARTICLE
OP is amazing and really fits. But ED feel so...generic. Like you could put it in on any other anime. I was hoping they added a bunch of character visuals. 
>> ARTICLE
It was kind of a nice come down after 22 minutes of insanity lol
>> ARTICLE
i liked the ED. it reminded me of the good old 80s animes. its definitely a grower though
>> ARTICLE
* Fly me to the moon, let me play among the stars... *
>> ARTICLE
I watched it when it leaked. Time to watch it again.
>> ARTICLE
doesn't viz have it on neon ally too?
>> ARTICLE
The hype is real, such a fun & good first episode.

Can't wait for next week.
>> ARTICLE
The moment we've been waiting for is finally here!!!!
>> ARTICLE
A fabulous first episode
>> ARTICLE
Guys, please tell me someone noticed that ending was straight out of Garden of Words.
>> ARTICLE
Love that fucking gleam in his eyes when he fights seriously. Some people will know what I'm talking about.

Base MadHouse, please, make this a couple seasons long.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fucking shit. This was brutal. Madhouse does it again. I actually read some of the source material but didn't remember that the fight against the Subterraneans was just a dream. Really awesome animation in that fight
>> ARTICLE
Poor Saitama.  Even in his wildest dreams it only takes 1 punch to handle his enemies.
>> ARTICLE
I hope it doesn't stray from the manga. Because as it stands currently it's perfect 10/10
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse is working together with ONE and Murata so I only expect a perfect adaptation plus small improvements 
>> ARTICLE
*Ending theme comes up*

A-Am I still watching OPM?

Well I went into this with no expectations aside from the genre and it's quite bizarre. In a good way.

 No clear story so far it seems except that OP Man is having a little trouble getting excited again. Hopefully, that dream will keep his pumped-upness in check for a little bit. Also, fantastic way of villain introductions. Kinda reminds me of another series but this was much better. Dunno if it's relevant but that guy in the hood passing through right before everything goes down the shithole might be significant. Maybe just a symbolic representation that there's much more to this city than people would know. 

Also, terrific animation with the perspectives done incredibly well during in the dream sequence (little guy versus huge monsters). The sheer force of it got my adrenaline pumping, to say the least. 

Opening song is a bit much for my taste. Strong beginning but I didn't quite like the rest of the song. ED is nice though. Solid music used throughout the episode. 

Overall, much like OPM, this was an incredibly strong first episode. 
>> ARTICLE
This was a good unexpected. I thought it would be more serious based on trailers but I still like the humorous approach. Of course madhouse animation is top notch, plus the ED song is amazing . 
>> ARTICLE
Not sure how far this is going to get in the source, but I really hope it animates the Boros arc. That was one hellavu fight.
>> ARTICLE
They presented all S-rank heroes, so the show will definitely get that far.

edit: a word
>> ARTICLE
[My body is ready](https://media.giphy.com/media/FjeGBljESVAzu/giphy.gif)

words can't describe how awesome that was...

best first episode of the season bar none. i was hyped for other shows like gakusen, rakudai, heavy object & noragami, but this one takes the cake.
>> ARTICLE
Shit that was good. 
>> ARTICLE
The sakuga fan in me was crying tears of joy throughout this episode. I doubt they can repeat this quality every episode but clearly Shingo Natsume and co. are doing amazing things with digital animation.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, that was pretty fucking awesome. The action was super visceral and the absurd comedy was on point. I was purposefully avoiding any hype for anything this season, so this was a super awesome start.
>> ARTICLE
All of my expectations have been lived up to and absolutely demolished.

This was fucking awesome.
>> ARTICLE
That was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. This season is gonna be awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Welp... this one stays on the watch list.
>> ARTICLE
This may get buried but I would really like to know

Does anyone know the name of the song playing in PV2 at around 0:23 and ends around 1:25?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeaFvbUi7mU
>> ARTICLE
this made it to the front page. well done errbody
>> ARTICLE
I think it was plainly excellent. If the quality persists this will be one of the great classic anime we will look back upon years from now.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been watching much anime in the past year or so, but I definitely picked a good one to start. I've been reading the manga and this episode was so faithful and.. and.. beautiful. Jesus, the animation is fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
[It was glorious....](http://i.imgur.com/09LkMGq.gif)
>> ARTICLE
No lie, trying to watch on Daisuki right now and not getting any video, only audio.  Anyone know of anyway to fix it?  Switching to Hulu for now.
>> ARTICLE
Great first Episode. Last season was a bit disappointing (for me at least), but we are off to a great start with this one
>> ARTICLE
An actual anime that can live up to its hype
>> ARTICLE
All that happened in one episode? This can't be real... (and it wasn't since it was a dream in the last part) but god damn! I can see why people hyped the coming of this show (unlike Owari).

I am a bit skeptic of how can this show can keep itself to be interesting by providing new challenges to such an OP MC. 

Even then, it's the best episode I've seen this season, and most likely a strong contender for AOTS.
>> ARTICLE
whoever came up with the name for the original manga is a genius. I would not be watching this superhero show if it wasn't called "one punch man," about a guy who can kill anything in one punch. I have no idea how they're going to go anywhere with that concept, but they have my attention.  good first ep.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Actual animation in my anime?! What's going on here?

Seriously though, this episode had some gorgeous animation sequences of the like I can't remember seeing since... maybe Space Dandy? So, I guess it hasn't been that long, but long enough.
>> ARTICLE
Just in case you didn't know, its the same director that did Space Dandy.

**Presentation:**

**OP** - I didn't care for the sound until the choir/band kicked in, but from them on I either liked it or loved it. Very energetic. The art during the OP was really good as well, either in stills format, or animated, with varied art-styles, smooth animation, and a nice colour palette.

**ED** - Quiet, chill, quite nice. I like it. Very much the opposite of the OP in terms of style. Very common style of ED, but better done than usual.

I think I'll start with this header for this show. First, and not foremost, the sound direction was good, and immediately after the OP, when we met Crablante, I thought to myself, "Hm, this BGM, and speech sound effects sound just like Fairy Tail (2011)!" and I looked it up, and turns out I was right, seeing as Hata Shouji was the sound director for that show, as well as this show. The sound effects are good, the music is good, and the OP and ED are both good as well.

Now the art, this show is very good looking. Crisp, gritty, cute, serious. It picks all sorts of moods, and the looks that go with them, going alongside a scale of details, rough lines to smooth, etc. And each of those looks wholesome and fitting of the show as a whole. The fight sequences also tend to use more than one style, with the cute rounded style at some, and a grittier style that makes heavy use of thick black lines, with sharper chins in the other.

This show looks *good*, and when it chooses to not look good, it still looks competent.

**Themes / Story / Atmosphere:**

Let's start with my overall impression and feeling for the show. The show feels like what you'd get if you'd combine Hataraku Maou-Sama (which I thought was "fine"), Blood Lad (which I thought was "eh"), Gintama (couldn't hold my attention) and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Liked, not loved, grew tired of the never-ending Cairo arc). Long story short, I think this show is fun, I think this show is gorgeous, but thus far, it just might not be the show for me, and that's fine. Not every show needs to be for me.

I would tell you though that I'm writing all of this with a grain of salt, because we don't really know what the show is going to be like/do, story-wise, just yet. From the trailers, I know Saitama is going to collect a whole menagerie of crazy characters around him, but we haven't met any of them yet. I do hope they introduce them faster than one at a time, because while meeting new characters can be fun, I am more curious at what he'll *do* once they're all together.

For now, you could see Saitama's ennui as commentary on the nature of the world we live in, where we do things half-heartedly, but if we don't really put our all into it, then we grow bored, and then can't put in even half a heart. That this is life, and many of us live without true desires, just wishes we remember from our childhood, but they're not true overdriving desires.

Or we could see what it's like saving people, being "heroes", when we lack conviction. Or how lonely it is to be at the top, and what are we here for anyway? We usually complain when things get rough, but would we really like them to be easy, as a way of life?

But that's something the show raises more as a premise, less as a concept to seriously explore, I think, and if it does explore it seriously, then we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

One Punch Man is a well-made, fun show, at least by its pretty great premiere, but it didn't grab me, and that's fine. I'd have watched the hell out of a pure action version of the show though, and I'm still going to keep watching, because, well, it's still *fun*, even if its attempts at humor left me cold.

([Check out my blog](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/) or the [episodics notes page](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/episodic-observations) if you enjoy reading my stuff.)
>> ARTICLE
For anyone who didn't catch it, in the OP, [](/s "(in 3, 2, 1 sequence) Saitama faced a Tiger, a Demon, a Dragon, and I guess a God.")
>> ARTICLE
I think its a allusion to the hero association's threat level system. [](/s "Lowest is Tiger, then Demon, then Dragon, then God is the highest tier threat.")
>> ARTICLE
So this is the first time I've ever tried to watch a show on Daisuki and I'm not very impressed. I made an account so I could watch in HD and it was still pretty blurry, especially during the action scenes. That's a total shame because from what I could see they are extremely well animated (thanks Yoshimichi Kameda)! Anyway, I dug the show, the monster designs are clever and the jokes mostly landed. I'll definitely be checking out more.
>> ARTICLE
god damn a couple stills in the opening really seemed redline-esque to me ... fuck everything this holy adaption is already my favorite anime of the year. and i know itll only gets better and better

i gotta say it's really awesome how madhouse pairs low quality scenes with high quality to keep the overall quality high 
>> ARTICLE
"Low quality" is actually not low quality. It's an actual style of animation that allows fluid action.
>> ARTICLE
Favorite.
>> ARTICLE
It's time... Time to get hype for what I'm looking forward to the most. 
>> ARTICLE
That's by far the best first episode ever.
>> ARTICLE
So fucking good!  
And Saitama's VA([Furukawa Makoto](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=creator&creatorid=34070)) was a really good choice. To think that Banri could shout like that.

The music fits perfectly with the scenes they are in, and absolutely enhances them. So good!

wooooah that was crazy! i wasn't very excited at first but when it got to the battle with the subterranean king! the animation and music went very well together. dropped the manga, but i'll be following this anime whoo

wut? Where did you drop the manga?

On Daisuki, the video won't load past a blank screen that says AD in the corner. Does anyone know how to fix this, or maybe a different place to watch it?

Adblock gave me this issue, had to turn it off in order for the video to play.

People did reviews on this episode a couple weeks ago.. But it just came out? I'm confused..

is there anywhere else besides Hulu to watch it pls my CR account does nothing!!!

daisuki is the only legal website that I know has it

Thanks

cool la, I think my cousin would like it.

Wow this first episode was really good. Is there another anime that this reminds anyone of? I'm having a hard time finding new ones and this looks good
>> ARTICLE
That was awesome
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow this series is everything everyone hyped about and more. The animation, the OP, the ED--*wipes away  a tear* ;u;)

(Also there's some nice nods to other series--DBZ, Super Sentai, Kamen Rider, Gintama--the next episode preview/title card and voice over)

The manga fans were not exaggerating when they said this series was amazing. I can't wait for the next episode!
EDIT: Speaking of the OP, it's so great to hear JAM PROJECT again! (ED is good too!)
>> ARTICLE
First episode aired. Season two already confirmed (for me, at least).

Damn that fighting animation is so fucking fluid and beautiful. I hope the whole season is like this

2500 upvotes!! I knew One Punch Man was popular but wow I am still impressed. Feels good seeing it on Reddit's front page.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the preview for this a while ago and thought it might be alright... I wasn't expecting to like it *this* much though. The humour is great and I love the fight scenes already, it's a shame that the only enemies to make him bleed were in his dreams. Poor Saitama.
>> ARTICLE
God damn was this episode AWESOME!  This show looks like it's gonna be kick-ass!  Beautiful action AND great humor, I wasn't expecting to laugh like I did :).  Dis gun be gooooood.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first episode yesterday and was really impressed. It seems to be right up my street with a good mixture of action and goofiness and the animation was beautiful. That whole dream sequence towards the end looked especially great.

I have never felt such hype before.
>> ARTICLE
Some pretty good laughs even though I remember most of this episode from the manga. The giant guy accidentally killing his brother and the subterraneans made me laugh out  loud. Really enjoyed some of the action, specifically the more detailed one punch kills looked particularly brutal. Definitely gonna keep watching, hope the quality keeps up, Madhouse did a great job with this first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Quick thoughts:

* The OP was incredibly hype. The metal track was really awesome and the visuals really get you pumped up.

* I love the way the setting weaves the idea of commonly-appearing, impossibly fantastical monsters into a realistic setting where people react appropriately to seeing them. And I love OPM's reactions when fighting them. I like that the premise of the series was basically introduced in a single episode while still keeping the episode fun and interesting. Not enough anime can get through the exposition cleanly without boring the audience.

* The comedy in this episode is on point. I had multiple laugh out loud moments.

* I didn't expect much out of the animation in this series and even though I noticed some segments where stills were obviously used to save time and money I thought the parts that were animated we're really nicely done. The way they convey OPM's ridiculous strength is very visceral and believable. I don't think I've enjoyed action in an anime this much since I was 14 and watching Toonami.

* I thought that OPM might be pretty good, but so far it it is much better than I thought. I was expecting a 7/10 and so far we're in 8 or 9 territory.
>> ARTICLE
Just you wait. If anything, any budget they MIGHT need to save is going into the final fights, and it's going to be absolutely glorious.
>> ARTICLE
seems like a show that might get interesting later. How is it so far compared to the manga?

I love the way they animated this, it felt weird at first but then I realized it's like directly taken out of pages of manga with some additional frames thrown here and there

I usually try to break down my thoughts on first episodes, and explain my pros and cons, etc., etc.

I only have one thing to say about this.

**IT'S GLORIOUS.**
>> ARTICLE
this could be the best first episode i have ever seen.
Solid candidate for AOTY. as expected from Madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
This show is fucking awesome in so many ways. Never read One Punch Man cause I've been waiting for the anime, so glad I did. This show is everything I've dreamed of.
>> ARTICLE
This anime was a pleasant surprise, I didn't know what to expect and wasn't disappointed.

Also holy shit, that was all a dream? What a killjoy...
>> ARTICLE
Does this release on Sundays or Mondays?

Edit: In the US.

AOTS.
>> ARTICLE
hell if they can keep up with this level of animation, i would't be surprised if its the AOTY
>> ARTICLE
I usually wait for a show to finish airing because I like to binge and hate following weekly, but right now this is the one exception. Amazing start.
>> ARTICLE
Now this is how you do a first episode right. I've read some of the manga, and seeing the chapters I've read being animated so nicely is just great. Cannot wait to see more!

Daaamn this OST is knocking it out of the park so far.

So I enjoyed this. Never seen the source. Is it worth watching? I think so!

Well, lets just say that the art in the manga is impossible to adapt without unlimited budget works.

Still Madhouse did an extremely good job.

That shit was fucking hype as shit!!!!

I'm not sure if I can wait an entire week for another episode.

Just read the manga man. In my opinion that will only enhance the experience as you'll look forward to hoe madhouse is going to deliver.

Wow, the animation for his fight with the subterraneans was fantastic.  Really well done.  

Loved the manga so this was always a no-brainer for me to watch, but I'm glad at just how well it's being done so far.

That moment when you realize Saitama's VA is the same as Tada Banri of Golden Time....

I didn't know I wanted this anime.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while for me to watch Kanada style animation other than Gainax anime. Maybe the final ep of Yoru no Yatterman is an exception? There're many Kanada children so I can see them enjoying drawing these battle scenes. 

And climax from the beginning with many homage is good.

Whats with the eye glowing thing?  I don't remember it being a thing in the manga

Probably [OPM MANGA](/s "Meant to differentiate between his "serious series" and usual self.")

its meant to show how theres fire in his eyes when he's fighting.
now his eyes are empty because everything ends with one punch lol

The opening looks kick ass so I'm wondering who is he target audience? What anime is this similar too? If I like what will I like this?
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic slapstick humour, and amazingly animated, hype-filled action scenes. Just give the first episode a try, really.
>> ARTICLE
I knew zero about this show, so I decided to give it a try. It's so cool! I hope he turns his apathy around.
>> ARTICLE
I find this Anime very representative of my own feelings about animes !! The hero is very strong but he is bored by all his enemies no matter how strong they are! Me too, i m very bored by all the animes that are out there no matter how interesting people find them, but this one seems pretty much cool !! I m very excited about it !!!
>> ARTICLE
For some reason I didn't like it that much. Manga is epic and hilarious (both One's and Murata's), but I feel like the epicness and humor doesn't transition into anime that well.

Not saying anime is bad, but manga is way better.
>> ARTICLE
Equally good
>> ARTICLE
I mean, sure Murata's artwork can't be adapted but this has been very faithful and by no means didn't translate the epicness of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
So is this just the same episode that aired on NicoNico a month ago or was that some sort of exclusive?
>> ARTICLE
It's the same episode but this is the official broadcast and has the OP & ED and is fully subbed. 
>> ARTICLE
It's the same, except with bitrate.
>> ARTICLE
looks alright, I hope they turn it into a real story instead of him just punching shit. the fights are neat I guess
>> ARTICLE
Why hope? The manga is the source, if anything I would only expect good things due to the constant hype on the manga and now the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I just don't read any manga so I wouldn't know about it
>> ARTICLE
I'll tell you right now, it's going to be an action-comedy and not much more, so don't get your hopes up toooo much for a serious story. This ain't that kinda show.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I've been waiting for this since I read the first chapter. It delivered in literally every way imaginable. Voices, sound, art, animation, humor, everything was perfect. 

It's not easy to copy Murata's god-tier art, but Madhouse did a damn good job. If only they could've done Eyeshield 21 and given it the proper treatment it deserved.

Edit: Also, the ED doesn't really fit what I was expecting, but I **really** like it, haha
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't this episode already released on September 6th? I remember watching it, and I don't think I'm hallucinating
>> ARTICLE
It was leaked during a pre-airing. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised you watched the prescreening without even knowing it was the prescreening.. 

Actually I'm really surprised how many people here are unaware of what they're watching 
>> ARTICLE
Well, to be honest, I didn't realize it was a prescreening, mostly because the subs were out of sync, so I immedietly stopped watching and left it at that. It was a month ago man, so it's been a while, after time I'm gonna forget about it
>> ARTICLE
Going to play devils advocate here, as good as it was I found myself disappointed with a few parts. 

- Some of the smaller details that would've been easy to put in were just let out randomly (ie. the girl in the first scene has a shirt that has the characters "School Child" on it. Its nothing major but it gives the world a unique personality)

- Really failed to re create some of the comedy in it. The boy and the soccer ball part felt really forced and seemed added just because it was part of the series and not really used as comic relief.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not understanding the hype. Maybe I just don't get it, but that was actually pretty boring and not entertaining. The music was cool though.
>> ARTICLE
The first few chapters / This first episode is all about setting up Saitama's character. From now on, the perspective will switch a bit to the characters in and around Saitama's life, and how this impossibly powerful being is throwing the world of heroes and villains on its head just by *being*.
>> ARTICLE
Yea I figured that is the route it was taking. I am in no way judging the entirety of the show or story based on the first episode and I will definitely be watching the entire series(no drop master race), but it seemed to pale compared to the other first episodes so far.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone describe to me why everyone is hyping over this?

Honestly I just found it really boring and would like a discussion about what everyone thinks made it super incredible because I'm not feeling anything special. :/
>> ARTICLE
For me its because its deconstructing the typical unbeatable shoen hero stereotype. When a person in a work of fiction wins every fight, but doesnt know if they will before hand, it can create tension even though its still likely that they will win anyways. But with this, it mocks the hero always winning thing that happens all the time by having him know that he will win no matter what. His attitude is supposed to mimic that of a savvy viewer. If I watch Bleach, I know that the good guys will win and wont die, so my reaction to fights is "This looks kinda cool, but I dont care cause they are gonna win." Saitama feels that way too.

TLDR It mocks other shows with unbeatable heroes while still having awesome fights.
>> ARTICLE
It gets surprisingly good. Trust me. If they stick to the source material, its gonna be a great ride.
>> ARTICLE
Oh don't worry, it gets better.

We only got to see one character from the huge amount this show has to offer.
>> ARTICLE
This is everything I wanted it to be, If this is how great the fight scenes are in the first episode I cant wait to see more.
>> ARTICLE
I was sold as soon as I saw the kid with the chin testicles. 
>> ARTICLE
Wtf this is the first episode? I watched it like a month ago, i'm so confused.
>> ARTICLE
ITT: It was perfect. 
>> ARTICLE
This is an amazing start. I wonder how much they could manage to adapt though. Are they going to adapt up to the original webcomic or the manga? 
>> ARTICLE
Unpopular Opinion time...

I'm only slightly amused by this first episode. I smiled some, and had an audible chuckle once. The art, animation, and sound track are gonna have me coming back to watch more at  least. Hopefully it gets a lot better.
>> ARTICLE
yea i dont understand what all the hype is about. i mean, it was decent. it wasnt AMAZING. i dont think i laughed even once...

edit: i actually laughed at the car monster, but thats only because i thought it was hilarious that they made it look like a bosozoku car.
>> ARTICLE
So what is this show about? I rarely see new releases lately. Is it too juvenile? I usually watch animes like FMA, Gurren Lagann, Death Note. I like those because they tend to cross the line towards more mature content and storyline.
>> ARTICLE
if you liked gurren lagaan i'm sure you will like this one. its about a hero who defeats villains with one punch.
>> ARTICLE
Just watched the first episode. I had a good laugh but was most impressed with the animation quality. I mean, WTF! There's no way they can keep up with that sort of quality for the rest of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, you're in for a ride. They're taking it from Murata's version, so there's no choice as to whether or not to have good animation.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely up there with Gurren Lagann at least.

Its main focus is comedy with parody elements, and can be pretty graphic when it comes to fights.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if Adlet can actually be stronger than him

It s interesting because when u get used to the usual schemes in mangas animes or movies u begin to get bored no matter how great the anime seems to be !!

>> ARTICLE
to be very honest, when I saw the the trailers I was not taking this series seriously, I thought it would be some form of comedy and it would be cheesy AF, but to be honest episode 1 was actually entertaining and I am really looking forwards to the One punch man  - ep02   **Bravo this show is a clapper**

It is comedy at its core.

which makes the serious moments even better

Well that tasted like awesome

There were some cuts during the colossal titan fight that looked kinda bad, but overall an incredible first episode. I kinda wish I hadn't watched the low resolution version, but it was still jaw dropping a second time.
>> ARTICLE
its good thats about it. 
>> ARTICLE
this is pretty much inferno cop with a budget
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if this is a compliment 
>> ARTICLE
I.... I don't get it.  

I tried hard to like this show given the hype surrounding it, and understand it's supposed to be a comedy, but I can't seem to find what's so funny about it. It tries to go for the "ridiculous over the top" trope, but the lack of reactions from characters in the show gives the opposite ambience, and as a result so many jokes fall flat. I can guess they're just trying to *boke* all the way and have the viewers do the *tsukkomi*, but all the attempts are too childish, and the lack of proper atmosphere really kills it. Shows like Gintama or Kill-la-Kill pulls these kinds of humor off much better and are much more intelligent with it.  

The show also gives off a vibe of... Laziness. The premise is lazy, "Guy trains too much and becomes too strong", meant to parody overpowered MCs. Lazy attempt at a laugh with comparison between how he looked 3 years ago vs now. *All the "punchlines" in the jokes in this first episode could be seen from miles away* because all the jokes are straightlines without any creative twists to them. The delivery of the shoulder kill was awful, gags like these should be pulled off fast instead of giving the viewer time to go "uh huh hurry up and slap the wrong guy already".  

Compared to shorts I see Japanese comedians perform on TV, this first episode just seems juvenile. All it does is scream "look how ridiculius I am!" without thought.   

Maybe the manga is better?  

I'll give this until episode 3 before deciding to drop it or not, but if nothing changes, this will be a disappointing waste of great animation.  

Let the "omg this guy no like my fav anime downvote without any counter arguments" begin
>> ARTICLE
This utilizes a lot less boke/tsukkomi style humor than most anime. It's more deadpan and absurdist style (think Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), which normally should resonate better with a Western audience. 

The humor stems from the main character going about his everyday life without caring about the amazing and ridiculous things going on around him, including his own feats.

Then add a healthy dose of satire and relevant social commentary (you'll see more as the show progresses), and you get a series that many people greatly enjoy. 
>> ARTICLE
Give it at least until episode 5 (or around that, there's no real way to know how they'll pace it, but it gets really real really soon). Wouldn't say it's for everyone, and mostly I feel like it's the best of the season exactly BECAUSE I read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
That's good to hear, I'll stick around at least until to the part where everyone in this sub orgasms then haha
>> ARTICLE
Seems like the anime is not for you. It's fine don't bother watching if you don't like it. Everyone got their own opinions you know? You don't have to force yourself to like what is popular.

It's a comparison between the scenes in the anime, the panels in the Murata's webmanga and ONE's webcomic.

Yes.

This is truly the best way to do it. That final gif in particular really benefits from comparing Murata's bargain day face with ONE's.

For an average guy like Saitama it's a hellish training. He trained until his body broke so he broke his limiter and become strong. A strong guy would have a higher limits so that training won't break their body and become strong.

Well obviously you've never done 100 squats much less 10 km of running afterwards
>> ARTICLE
I can do both separately, but admittedly i cannot do both in a row. And that is why I have hair. :D
>> ARTICLE
I tried for some time during last summer but I had to stop because of school and I noticed 3 things:


- when I went to sleep I wouldn't wake up before sleeping for at least 10 hours

- my stomach and muscles were always screaming

- I lost 4-5 kg
>> ARTICLE
Did you tell your muscles to stop screaming?
>> ARTICLE
Yea but did you turn off the A/C? That's the real key here, otherwise your mind gets fatigued and you give up. :P

Yep, I was the only member of my family without an A/C, sometimes I slept on the floor of the bathroom 'cause it was a little cooler

I dunno man, you should be invincible now. Maybe you should try shaving your head bald to see if that helps :D
>> ARTICLE
Nah man the balding has to happen naturally.
>> ARTICLE
But what if your arms make weird cracking noises?!?
>> ARTICLE
Keep doing push ups of course.
>> ARTICLE
Until they both break...? I think I can see where this is going.
>> ARTICLE
Alternatively, you can do 50 push-ups, 50 sit-ups, 50 squats, 5 km running every day to become a 2-punch man.

Also, half a banana for breakfast
>> ARTICLE
Does that mean if I do 200 push-ups, 200 sit-ups, 200 squats and 20km running with two bananas for breakfast everyday I can become a half-punch man?
>> ARTICLE
Sure but can you really half punch someone?
>> ARTICLE
What's a half punch? Do you defeat people with just a quick jab?
>> ARTICLE
Just a flick.
>> ARTICLE
By that logic, if I do 400 push-ups, 400 sit-ups, 400 squats and 40km running with four bananas for breakfast everyday, would I become zero-punch man?
>> ARTICLE
Actually that's incorrect, By going in the sequence that /u/irishsaltytuna specified, 400 would make you a quarter-punch man, not a zero-punch man. If halving gets you two punches, and doubling gets you half a punch, quadrupling gets you a quarter of a punch. That's basic logical sequence.

Having said that, this is One Punch Man we're talking about, and he defies and ignores logic, so I guess you're right.
>> ARTICLE
You'll only become zero-punch man if you do limit as n goes to infinity of n push-ups, n sit-ups, n squats, and n*10 km running with n bananas for breakfast every day.
>> ARTICLE
You kill people just be being in their presence

Wow, the evolution chart shown was not only in completedly correct German, but also spelled like they would have been in the late 19h century. Really impressed to see this amount of detail in research.

I do find it amusing that while we were drooling over Mosquito Girl last episode, they were gushing over Genos.

Anyway, regarding the episode, I actually heard a good theory about how Saitama's power. Basically, it wasn't the workout routine that made him so strong, but his *mental state*.

He was so focused during his training that he approached Buddha levels of concentration, which is where his power stems from. 
>> ARTICLE
I can promise you that they're either going to act the same way once Speed of Sound Sonic gets introduced or start pairing him up with Saitama or Genos for weird Rule 34 yaoi comics.

It's even more funny because in the manga he gets a fandom similar to that later on too.

It helps that the manga has a bunch of lampshading scenes with boatloads of exposition, where they can just have it panning over a single shot for a while. They did that with Genos introducing himself, just several shots panning across Saitama's apartment for several minutes. And then they pump all that saved money into making one damn good still to pan, and making damn good fights.

* Gigantic one day sale.
* Saving the world.

Saitama sure does have his priorities in order.   
>> ARTICLE
This is not a spoiler as they never told you this in the story, but basically for the last 3 years Saitama had been unemployed and live off his savings and the occasional donation of vegetables from people he rescued. Sales are important because he can't afford the food otherwise.
In other words, right now Saitama, Earth's mightiest hero, is living in extreme poverty.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't he get money from [Manga Spoilers](/s "Being a registered Hero? I mean, even C Ranks get some kind of cash for beating monsters, right?")
>> ARTICLE
[Manga Spoilers](/s "C Class heroes get abysmal pay, not really much to live on. Genos is the breadwinner in the family.")
>> ARTICLE
[Manga Spoilers](/s "In the manga he's B- class rank 7. That's nearly A; Satima gets paid okay.")
>> ARTICLE
[Original WEB Manga Spoilers](/s "He's actually A-Class Rank-7 now after defeating Garou")
>> ARTICLE
[Expanding on both of you](/s "He starts off as non-registered, then becomes C-Class, stays at C-Class after the meteor, gets promoed to B-Class after the Sea King, stays B-Class after Boros, and then gets to A-Class after the Monster Association + Garou.")
>> ARTICLE
Wait, where can I read the web comic, I know the [regular manga](/s " is only at B rank.")
>> ARTICLE
Look for "Onepunch Man (ONE)"; just look for OPM as normal and pick the other option because most of the places I've seen have both of them.  If the art looks really shitty, you've found it.

Translations for the webcomic only started at ~ch30 so that's the other indicator.
>> ARTICLE
Found it, holy shit the art is terrible but it's still hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
How are ranks decided? By number of monsters you beat? As someone who knew little to nothing about OPM until the anime showed up, I read up on the wiki and it didn't explain how ranks were obtained iirc. Saitama has been viewed destroying baddies even the best heroes couldn't scratch, so I don't think it's by strength.

Edit: Thanks for all of the input guys, it's nice to know!
>> ARTICLE
In short?  Credit.  The only thing that matters is for someone to report that Person X defeated Monster Y, and then Person X gets Monster Y's worth of rank increase for it.  The exact value of Monster Y is very arbitrary although it vaguely follows the disaster level system.  Also, if they mess up rating the disaster level for whatever reason, the credit drops.

If the person who beats the monster is not witnessed at the scene but someone else is, then that other person gets the credit.

If there's a mix of lower-ranked heroes and higher-ranked heroes, the higher-ranked heroes generally get more credit because they're perceived as having done more work.

If nobody reports and the Heroes Association does not notice anybody resolving the incident, then nobody gets credit for it.
>> ARTICLE
[spoiler](/s "It is rated by popularity, most of his victories were rewarded to someone else")
>> ARTICLE
I'm completely certain that's not true, read /u/upads comment below. Fans vote on what rank they think they should be but that's pretty much a fantasy league.
>> ARTICLE
That really sucks. I await the day when he gets recognition then!
>> ARTICLE
The problem is, and this doesn't really spoil anything, is that nobody ever seems to see him defeat these monsters. They all think he's lying.
>> ARTICLE
My issue is with Genos, then. Genos is S-rank, ridiculously powerful, and knows first-hand how powerful Saitama is. You'd think his ranks influence would be able to sway the ranking system into giving Saitama a rank that suits him.
>> ARTICLE
There're a few factors:

1. How active you are, if you're not active you get the sack (C class only)

2. How many reported monster defeat---you get rank up according to how many monsters you defeat, but you gotta report it yourself, or have others report you.  One reason Saitama has is that he doesn't report his monster defeat, and quite a few of his kills either go unreported, or is reported under the wrong [name](/s "King got the credit, and so much credit he went into S-Class")

3. To get a class-up, you will need to be judged by the panel, and also, by a member of A-Class rank 1.

But if you're simply insanely strong that people can't measure you, you get into S-Class.
>> ARTICLE
Your spoiler tag isn't working, too many ]'s after 'name'
>> ARTICLE
> But if you're simply insanely strong that people can't measure you, you get into S-Class.

Why isn't he S-class them?
>> ARTICLE
[Manga Spoilers](/s "Even then, Saitama isn't currently registered as a hero right?")
>> ARTICLE
That's what I thought. Haven't read the manga [but] (/s "I assumed his whole 'hero for fun' shtick precluded him from being in the organization.") And not even like they won't let him in. Like he literally doesn't know they exist, or just doesn't join for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
He just didn't know it existed at all.  
>> ARTICLE
Right answer.
>> ARTICLE
So much respect for Saitama. I assumed he was on some sort of budget when I was reading, but didn't realize he was that poor.

He's literally the hero we don't deserve, but the hero we need.

Okay, so as you've probably realised, One Punch Man's star team of animators aren't going away anytime soon. Here's the big names for Episode 3:

**Yoshimichi Kameda**: Kameda's back again with some of his rapid action and brushwork style. You'll remember him from the Underdweller fight scene in Episode 1.

**Toshiyuki Sato**: Much like the rest of the staff, Sato is a Space Dandy animator with great effects work. He did some of Genos' attacks in this episode including that awesome battle between Genos and Carnage in the Street Fighter training level. [This is a great example](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/d85bfae7b991ca879803398c769b888f.mp4) of some of his work from Space Dandy.

**Abe Shingo**: Yeah! More Gundam animators! Thing with effects animation is that you can often find some of the best examples in mecha shows. So Shingo Abe actually fits a superpower centric show quite well. Abe has this obsession with depth and you'll find that on a lot of his works. For example, [this clip from Gundam Orphans.](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/a564205058f073df7c9bcb4b3a2be1e1.webm)

**Sakakibara Tomotsugu**: Not a big name (Well, in terms of length I guess it is), but he's one of the many Hunter X Hunter animators who have suddenly jumped on board. [Here's an example](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/f3a8c243ffc039f800b3a1ef80af2976.webm) of his character animation.

A lot of the rest are actually Madhouse people for a change. They're not responsible for many of the "super cool" bits, but this does mean that the people above had a lot more time to shine themselves. The Action Animator Director was Kameda and the Chief Animation Director was Chikashi Kubota who, like everyone else, a really talented animator from Space Dandy.

Next episode's Animation Director is Sejoon Kim, the Gundam Build Fighters Chief Mecha Animator. He's kind of obsessed with beams, so... expect a lot of those.
>> ARTICLE
When Saitama's training regimen was revealed in the original web comic, it finally convinced me that this story is a brilliant work of comedy/parody. In typical action type stories, we often find our protagonist having to go through some type of special training in order to become more powerful, such as the infamous Hyberbolic Time Chamber or being bit by a radioactive spider. The author, ONE, instead says screw all that, those explanations make no sense and you are going to buy it anyways. Instead, here's something simple, just as ridiculous, and you are going to have to accept it.

One Punch Man doesn't need explanations because there can never be an explanation that will make sense or is not convenient, so why not skip all that and just have some fun? I personally think it is brilliant and the story is filled with many moments like that, which to me is no surprise why One Punch Man is doing as well as it is. [People will put up with this kind of artwork because of ONE's story telling,](http://galaxyheavyblow.web.fc2.com/) though that's not to say that the "terrible" artwork doesn't have some charms of its own. I think that those who have enjoyed One Punch Man thus far will definitely enjoy what's to come.

I take it Genos is going to be the [Worf](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main.TheWorfEffect) of the series: every enemy of the week beats him up just to show how strong they are.

A fight isn't serious unless Genos loses some body parts.

I've read the manga a billion times, and I know excactly whats gonna happen. But its still sooooo good !!

I translated some of the reviews:

> *Story*: 3/5, *Animation:* 4/5, *Voice acting:* 3.5/5, *Music:* 3.5/5, *Characters:* 3.5/5, *Overall:* 3.5/5

>Is this a movie? Because that's the level of animation here!

>I get the impression that a lot of work was put into the fight scenes in particular.

>I feel like my initial grasp of the series is limited due to the lack of proper explanation.

>From what I've seen of the first episode, couldn't this just have been a five-minute anime? I feel like that, but I don't know how it's going to turn out from now on.

>*Episode 1*

>The guy at the beginning looked like Piccolo from Dragon Ball, and the guy in his eye looked like Frieza! Yooo! Well, that's what I thought, but I still felt that various things weren't explained enough, like why the main character became a hero, or even what his name is.

>It looks like a lot of money was put into this series, so I hope the staff continue to work hard from now on.

>*Episode 2*

>The episode where Genos appears and we meet Mosquito Girl and many of the other monsters.

>Genos's backstory in the B part was so long... I feel like the voice actor could make you cry. As of episode 2 we now know what the name of the main character is and how old he is. Saitama, 25, and Genos, 19.

>That mad scientist-looking character turned up very briefly, so I feel like they're going to have to defeat him.

>*Episode 3*

>The mad scientist turned out to just be a mob character. Saitama fought and defeated a monster who looked like Unit 01 from Evangelion with one punch.

>Genos is surprisingly weak. It looks like next episode is going to focus around him, but I'm looking forward to yet another fight that's over in one punch.

>**Less of a review, more just my thoughts**, by Aoi Hoshi [Blue Star].

>*Story*: 3/5, *Animation:* 4/5, *Voice acting:* 3.5/5, *Music:* 3/5, *Characters:* 4/5, *Overall:* 3.5/5

>I like the original manga, but the anime adaptation feels a little lacking. I'll try and think of why. Not enough characters appear in the beginning!

>[This bit is spoilers for a few episodes from now](/s "The story's charm is in the various energetic and reliable heroes, so until the S-Class heroes, Fubuki, or any of the other appealing characters show up, isn't it somewhat low-quality? That's my thoughts.")

OK (as someone who has never read the source materials) so from the past 3 episodes, every time a backstory shows a character gain superhero skills, it involves a shining of the eyes in a mysterious hue. In that case, it seems to react to the circumstances of each character giving an insight to how they are formed. (which might eventually explain how or which one saitama's was)

Were these sort of hints included in the source material as well? Seems like a great side mystery for huge payoff later, but I dunno if it was just added in later since now they have color to work with.
>> ARTICLE
Basically, in this universe obsession and drive unlocks your limiter. There's a side comic where Saitama-in-training battles someone who shadowboxed the pull-switch for an electric light so much he became a berserk, superstrong boxer.

So this is anime-original, but it's a good visual indication.

It is a pity the scientist didn't explained the origin of Saitama's power.

Well, Murata's version hasn't reached that side-story either.

Since it is not *really* a spoiler, i'll mention it, but marked as a spoiler:

[According to the 'House of Evolution' genius scientist, the origin of Saitama's power is...(Original Webcomic Spoiler)](/s "that Saitama was able to remove the limitation of a living being. His powers have no limits. Living beings are born with a limitation to their capabilities, so they don't go crazy with unlimited abilities. 'Carnage Kabuto' goes crazy for 1 week when going at full power because of that. But Saitama was able to remove his limitations without going crazy, only using his own will and discipline. The only thing he lost in exchange for limitless power was his hair.")

Im just mentioning it because **it is** related to 'Carnage Kabuto' going crazy.

/r/whowouldwin is going to love all the OPM posts while this show is airing.
>> ARTICLE
inb4 hundreds of people try the training and in three years the true OPM will appear
>> ARTICLE
Seems like being obsessed with a particular goal is the reason for all these strange happenings. Genus obsessed with evolving humanity, Punch Man obsessed with being the strongest, Car dude obsessed with car, and Lobster Man obsessed with Lobsters. Seems to me being obsessed with something makes you into that obsession. 

So does that mean if someone obsessed so much into being a Oh I don't know a pair of breast does that mean that someone will become a pair of walking breast??

TODAY IS THE SPECIAL SALE DAY

I feel sorry for any anime-only reading these discussions there's always tonnes of spoilers sprinkled by the manga readers, even if they are referring to something only manga reader's would understand its still slightly disappointing.

saitama told us how to get as strong as him see you guys in 3 years.

Saitama training level: Troll.

Lol I love how Saitama is so chill about Genos.  "you turned Genos into a piece of modern art..." best line of the anime... haha
>> ARTICLE
I may have missed this mentioned somewhere but is there a particular reason a lot of the voice actors have come out of HxH or is that just coincidence?

Madhouse also did HxH

Birdie-01 vs Saitama o:

I love how seeing Saitama's antics is enough to give up on evolution after 50+ years or hard work and research
>> ARTICLE
So did he actually get this strong by training or is there something more to it? 
>> ARTICLE
Nope.  That's all he did.
>> ARTICLE
This show is great

And that was the day when the great Hero and his disciple accomplished an amazing deed...they arrived to the special sales on time :D

Well looking back at the trend, this discussion thread will be the third top discussion thread of /r/anime right behind episode 2 and episode 1.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't be surprised if the top 12 discussion threads of /r/anime is from One Punch Man.
>> ARTICLE
OPM has too many amazing faces. And we have only had 3 episodes thus far.
>> ARTICLE
No man has ever given less fucks than Saitama.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love that soundtrack that comes on (at least in this case) when Saitama was getting pummelled.
>> ARTICLE
This episode clearly says that it was worth waiting for this anime. Definetly best anime of this season.
>> ARTICLE
I've just gotta say... I adore that ED song.
>> ARTICLE
Yeeeees I knew there were dozens of us. DOZENS!
>> ARTICLE
Why is everything written in german in this anime?
And why is it even correct?
>> ARTICLE
i wonder if there's an actual reason why saitama is so absurdly strong or if the training is actually all he's done and there's nothing more to it
>> ARTICLE
"Scientists HATE THIS! How to get SUPERHERO RIPPED in 3 SIMPLE STEPS!"
>> ARTICLE
Every motivational speech in anime should just burst out in a sudden "Black Ink Spongebob" art style. Seriously, that made it even funnier compared to how Saitama explained it in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
God everything about this show is just so well done, I couldn't stop laughing when Saitama and Genos blew a hole in the wall to make it to the sale, and can we just talk about that machine gun blow kick that Genos did!? Hot damn that was impressive even if he got his ass kicked immediately after. 
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse is delivering *so hard* with the art in this. If only Eyeshield could've gotten the respect this is getting. They really butchered Murata's god tier art in that one.
>> ARTICLE
I liked how Asura Beetle went from the JP Rhino beetle into a Hercules beetle

I also like how much dedication Madhouse put into the adaptation. Really is like the mango
>> ARTICLE
I find it funny that Saitama broke the trope that the longer your hair the more powerful you become.
>> ARTICLE
This. Was. Hilarious!!!

I can't help but be amazed by such amazing animation.

The episode was really fun. Saitama is worried about the most normal of things. 

Saitama's training regime was quite predicatable. 100 push ups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats, 10 km run, no AC/heater, strict timings. 

I can't say the comedy and jokes are unique, but the situation makes them a lot more funnier.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama catching Genos reminded me of Goku catching Vegeta after he got the snot beaten out of him by one of the Ginyus (?) on Namek.
>> ARTICLE
Next week: "A childlike smile."
>> ARTICLE
What's the OST when they're battling? Its so fucking hype.
>> ARTICLE
That fucking OST.  Its needs to come out ASAP so I have a new gym soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
I love how they kept the tense music while he explains his training schedule instead of suddenly pausing it.
>> ARTICLE
That ending had me in tears. This is the anime we deserve.
>> ARTICLE
The music, damn the music!
>> ARTICLE
I'm requesting a picture of Saitama with the menacing aura and the dumb face for 5 internets and a karma
>> ARTICLE
I felt like he was facing a rampaging EVA unit for a bit there. Man, amazing episode as always. 
>> ARTICLE
Everyone here is comparing Carnage Kabuto Carnage mode to Eva 01 yet I think he looks like a Brachydios.
>> ARTICLE
Anybody spotted the references ( if they were ) ? I found two personally :

Fighting room looking like the training room in SSFIV 

Triple Rewind on Carnage Kabuto punch as in HxH
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know the soundtrack that was played when he was getting hit by Carnage Kabuto? 
>> ARTICLE
I thought he was going to bring up that if he had to fight Kabuto for a week he was going to miss the next day's sale, BUT THIS WAS A MUCH BETTER OUTCOME.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so happy that this anime is living up to the hype.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, Eva-01 went berserk 
>> ARTICLE
I never noticed how much pre-OPM Saitama looks like Genos with black hair and normal eyes. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn, this show has a TON of hype. I can't remember any recent anime that's gotten this much attention, even the manga is starting to get a lot of traction here in the US. 

Also, if you don't enjoy the relationship between Saitama and Genos, there's something wrong with you! 
>> ARTICLE
So did anyone else notice that Carnage Kabuto has the same VA as Old man Joseph from jojo? 
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit the BGM during Carnage mode

>> ARTICLE
One has to wonder if doing that intense training regimen religiously for three solid years would actually have done that.
it seems normal, but when you factor that he did it nonstop withoutn giving himself even a single day to let his bones and muscles regrow, it sounds pretty crazy.

also, in the one punch man universe, obsession seems to give people what they want, in saitama's case he obsessed for the power to kill a foe in one punch, three straight years of focusing and obsessing later, he's literally what he imagined he would be.

that might be the explanation for his power.
>> ARTICLE
Does Daisuki stutter like crazy for yall?

I basically have to strap on my pirate hat every week cause i literally cant watch it on Daisuki
>> ARTICLE
1080p is unwatchable for me but 720 is fine,

Really? That's sad :( I really like Daisuki as it works flawlessly to me, unlike how Crunchyroll used to work when I was subbed there.  
I'm living in Finland and maybe it depends where you live?
>> ARTICLE
Im in the US, i turn off adblock for Daisuki, and it still stutters on my laptop and my roommates. It did that when i was watching Kuroko on Daisuki when it aired. I gave up after awhile

I laughed so hard knowing he was worrying about the sale.
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse is doing really good. I love it.

Only 3 chapters this time huh?

Saitama says he got to where he is just from training and trying and not stopping every day is really inspiring. Hell I might have something incredibly inside me to! And so could anyone else here!

What is that "shine" on their eyes? It happened with Saitama on the dream and with the scientist dude now, what does that mean?

It means that they gain the drive that makes them powerful. In this case it made him a genius

Carnage Kabuto's colour scheme is the same as Shinji's evangelion.

Asura Rhino has the same VA as Joseph Joestar

I'm hoping that this anime will make it all the way to the later chapters. The fights get better and better so I hope the anime doesn't stop short. I'm kinda worried since this is only 12 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
It'll probably get to [Spoiler](/s "Sea King") and might just get to [Spoiler](/s "Boros").
>> ARTICLE
I love the fight scenes in this show, hunter x hunter level good
>> ARTICLE
Who did the voice for Carnage Kabuto? Kinda sounded like Joseph Joestar in Stardust, or Isaac Netero in HxH. Can anyone pls confirm?
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait to see fucking King and Fubuki animated



*especially Fubuki*

this anime just keeps getting better and better. 
the animators are truly doing the manga justice

This anime is modern art. 10/10

Very rarely do I physically laugh out loud from anime, but there's just been at least a moment or two every episode where I'm cracking up from some of the stupid shit said or shown.

Anyone else watching on Hulu? The subtitles on the ps4 are awful.

I heard someone saying that the Suns are rendered locally, so try it on another platform?

A little light on action this episode, which is kind of a shame since that's where all the great animation is. Still good though. The brushstroke visuals were pretty neat.  
Of course Saitama cares more about the sale than the giant monster trying to kill him. I wouldn't expect anything else.
>> ARTICLE
~~Tobio~~ Genos is such a good complement to Saitama. And Saitama is just amazing. The animation is insanely consistent as well. I love Sundays now
>> ARTICLE
well... did they make the supermarket on time or not....
>> ARTICLE
I guess we know what the story arc is going to be.
>> ARTICLE
How long is the manga? Also how many chapters does each episode average? 
>> ARTICLE
The ONE comic is well into the hundred+ chapters range. Not really sure how many chapters they're covering an episode, but I'm pretty sure it's less than 7-10 so the anime is set for this season at the very least.
>> ARTICLE
I'm enjoying it so i hope it keeps going.
>> ARTICLE
I'm always scared that it'll get boring and the animation will be bad. I've never been so happy to be proven wrong in my life. Best fight scenes eva.

Is it me or the fight scene's music sounds kinda like Slayer?

Top tip for not getting one-punched:  don't keep him from supermarket sale days, can't mess around with them deals!

Piece of modern art LOL 

Genos fucking rekt the building making Saitama depressed XDDDD

Dat Genos hair!

That training is actually sick, doing that for three years, i can see how that would make someone that strong (obviously overdone here xDDDDD)

NOT THE SALE!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah no rest, training everyday is pretty freaking intense
>> ARTICLE
Well, now the secret is out. The source of his power. 

[One hundred push-ups and a hundred sit-ups.](http://i.imgur.com/SOKs22r.jpg)

[Then a ten kilometer run](http://i.imgur.com/lYpR5W0.jpg)

Do this [every single day](http://i.imgur.com/5M9mQps.jpg) and you two could have the power of the one punch man.  
>> ARTICLE
Fuck Kabuto, PRAISE HELIX!
>> ARTICLE
Glad they changed the name From Rhino to Kabuto, because he have nothing to do with rhinos but he looks like a kabuto ( insect)
>> ARTICLE
He looks like rhinoceros beetle and kabuto is a rhinoceros beetle so......
>> ARTICLE
While Madhouse is doing an absolutely outstanding job with the animation in this series, I feel as if they're stretching some of the jokes out a bit too long. It's also weird seeing jokes delivered differently than how I read them.

But still, fun episode! Can't wait to see how they animate the other fights in the series.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was hilarious, but does anyone else hope they introduce the hero league soon? 
>> ARTICLE
We should be seeing some members next episode.

I hope so!

ALRIGHT R/ANIME ITS TIME TO GET STRONG! You want to get your waifu? You cant get senpai to notice you? Just want to get strong? Do Saitama's training regimen every day and post results every Sunday in time for the new episodes!

I'll be surprised if anyone is insane enough to do his routine.
No rest and training everyday is pretty damn tough for a beginner.
>> ARTICLE
Half of /r/anime would get injuries from going to the couch to running too much quickly.

Not to mention those squats... I can't even do a single push-up lol
>> ARTICLE
God damn i didn't realize Genos was so strong. The OST in this show is really fantastic, another hilarious/entertaining episode. I feel like this show just keeps getting better and better.  10/10
>> ARTICLE
the point is Genos has the crazy DBZ styled figts then Saitama comes in with the punch, it only gets better
>> ARTICLE
Hang on... I'm confused.. they were going to do an eight story tower raid and then genos blows up the building.. but then the door to the secret lab is on the floor.. what would have been the point of climbing the tower if the floor they needed to go to was on the floor? Maybe i'm just over thinking this.
>> ARTICLE
It was a hidden door. They were meant to be tricked into going up the 8 floors of trap like normal people, but instead they just blew up the building revealing the hidden basement level.
>> ARTICLE
The tower of evolution is one evolved creature each level. The top floor one is the strongest one that is free. The basement houses Asura Rhino who is considered a failure because he's insane and uncontrollable, but he's the strongest one by far. Geno's blows up the 8 guys and floors in one go, letting them skip straight to fighting the failed experiment that was to be used as a last resort.
>> ARTICLE
I guess to trick them into thinking the top floor is where the boss is? 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone knows the soundtrack playing when Asura rhino entered asura mode?

All I want to say is that I'm sad Boros is unlikely to make an appearance if this stops at 13 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Ity's 12 episodes, and IT IS gonna appear, (though its most likely there where the anime will end), because in the previews of the series they showed Tatsumaki and Saitama's first encounter when he went to the Heroes' Association S-Class meeting with Genos and Bang OxO

Motherfucker, you can't watch *ANYTHING* in Thailand!
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one not seeing the appeal of this? Yes, it has creative characters, good animation and soundtrack...but thats about it. For humor, it is less fun than the AoT parody and many others and story so far is basicly non-existent. Also, so far, the characters really didn't seem to be interesting in any way. In short, so far this seems to me to be pretty much a worse Gintama with higher production quality, but worse humor, characters and story.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah im with you dropped after 3 episodes I just dont find it funny at all. Puts me to sleep honestly.
>> ARTICLE
>creative characters, good animation and sountrack

Most shows don't even come close to having this lol. Also the show just has 3 eps, the ride just keeps getting better as the series goes on. If you don't like it that's fine, but at least give it a chance.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but those 3 don't make good shows. GC has the last two good as example but is horrible.
>> ARTICLE
Guilty Crown took itself seriously. This is satire through and through. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mean to compare the two in tone. Simply saying that having high production quality isn't enough to make an anime.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the tone I'm talking about, but the plot and character settings and such. I'm saying that the show has more than its high production quality.

Saitama is in the position of an escapist fantasy style protagonist, but the interesting part about him is that he no longer seeks strength at all. He's truly and honestly bored, and understandably so. The humor comes from his reactions not matching what an ordinary person's would be, though. In this episode, he's reacting with shock when he's being battered around by the berserk beetle, but for the unexpected reason of having missed the sale.

It's a bit repetitive, but it doesn't rely on that exact joke too much more.

Genos is a classic protagonist type character seeking strength, but he's funny because he's the sidekick and he gets himself destroyed in silly ways (like the afro this episode).

In the future it has more satire of silly tropes and more ridiculousness to look forward to.

If you don't get the humor, whatever. You can make all of the people laugh some of the time, or make some of the people laugh all of the time, but you can't make all of the people laugh all of the time.
>> ARTICLE
You're not the only one but that's just because maybe parodies aren't your thing.
I like it because it took every trope that been had been built up in the shonen genre and superhero comics and turned it on it's head.
I also really like the humour in it. 
It also has a story but it kicks in later. 
Again I'm sure there are a lot of people who don't like Onepunch-Man just like you but that's your preference of taste.
For instance maybe you hate that hangover movie with Bradley whathisname but I thought it was really funny.
>> ARTICLE
I still really like the show, but is the humor getting really predictable to anyone else?

I'm in the mood to see you; in the mood to cry; in the mood for a Romantic Night,

So I hope these feelings reach you!

After all, I always know the ways in which you're trying so hard...

The person I love is so strong it worries me,

So show your weakness to me alone!

I still dunno. It will be pretty boring if this is the formula. The cyborg guy fights them in a flasy way then he comes and knocks them out with one punch. I just dont find enjoyment in the fights this way so far.

That's the best part, no matter how serious a fight gets he just throws out some extremely normal punch as his super ultra skill.

Except when he uses the serious punch combo.

i feel serious just means he's doing them properly. like his punches are usually just a bonk  with his fist but the serious moves are punches/or things done properly

Normal means hes holding back his power

He's always holding back.

The most anyone's ever gotten out of him is to make him actually start trying a little.

Okay, so as a follow up to my [One Punch Man Animation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDmZM3GkYxU) earlier.

The staff for One Punch Man Episode 2 involves:

**Sawada Hidehiko**: Hunter X Hunter's best action animator. All of your favourite [fight scenes](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/9e0c52bec433486d80b69e23c77fd9d0.webm)? Yeah, that's him. [Bit of a spoiler in the link]

**Nakayama Ryu** and **Enokido Shun**: These guys are a part of a group of web-generation animators (Guys who learnt animation themselves and uploaded it onto the internet) formed by Tatsunoko Production. They're [incredible](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/973949953f20343972297dd820898032.webm). (Got a bit of a video about that web generation team [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEK4JJE7YWQ) )

**Uda Sakiko**: In Episode 1 of OPM, they featured Gundam Build Fighters' best animator, Se Jun Kim. Episode 2, here's the [second best](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/c1a010b0b80cf11546538af5e77fd774.webm). He's also doing some amazing work on Gundam Orphans right [now.](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/109e3bf4799a0811903431ab0e9fdd60.webm)

**Atsuki Shimizu**: Created some of the most memorable scenes in [Tokyo Ghoul](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/6c38530719cbabbf3b63e64c71fae45a.webm). Everything he does has this sort of blossom of explosions. (If that metaphor makes any sense).

There's more, but those are the biggest names. I've been told that Episode 3 features a lot more of Madhouse's in-house talents who have been kind of absent so far. But I think this pretty much infers that this quality of animation is going to be consistent.
>> ARTICLE
It seems like there's going to be a more even mix of in house Madhouse talent vs freelancers as the series progresses. 
For example, Shinichiro Ushijima directed this week's episode(Also confirmed to be doing more on OPM down the line) along with Kunio Takahide who has been slowly getting more confident with his KA(Check out his cuts in Ore Monogatari/the latter half of HxH) 

I'll be shocked if Liang Boya and migmi don't show up somewhere in this series. Yoshihiro Kanno ADing/doing KA for an episode would be the cherry on top but he might be too busy with Ushio and Tora
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Madhouse is gonna go all out with this one.
>> ARTICLE
Sawada Hidehiko is pretty much assembling a lot of animators himself, specifically Shun Enokido who did [this](http://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/15733/animated-background_animation-effects-hunter_x_hun) cut. I assume Ryu just came along for the ride. This is Madhouse taking a backseat, a load of these are still people who Natsume knew from Space Dandy. Next week is Madhouse's turn to going all out! :D
>> ARTICLE
Genos is a fucking badass.
>> ARTICLE
His eyes is really cool its like a black hole
>> ARTICLE
He's quite the slick bastard.
>> ARTICLE
My only problem with this show is that it's so good that all of the discussion about the show is just "this show is so good" and "I love this show." But that's not really such a bad problem to have. 
>> ARTICLE
Haha [the face](http://i.imgur.com/eTYpmHT.jpg)

It's incredible how faithful they are being in that aspect. Then again it's Madhouse.

Seriously, the spread page after that in mangahere.com **(before it got serialized)** was insane, it got over 1k Tsukkomis. Then it got replaced, and it STILL got over 1k Tsukkomis!!
>> ARTICLE
now tokyo ghoul:re with one page at chapter 9 is the only page with 1000+ tsukkomu...

(if there are others ones, feel free to link me to those)
>> ARTICLE
There's one with Noragami with 500 tsukkomis, but I'm afraid if you're watching the current season it's gonna be a HUGE spoiler
>> ARTICLE
What site should i use to read One punch Man?
>> ARTICLE
Most would recommend batoto, but they usually delete licensed/popular manga. So the best I can recommend you is [](/s "mangareader or mangadoom") (google it)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I already checked batoto and they deleted it and i also checked google but they all have different ones in Manga fox they only have 52 ch+ and in Mangapanda they have 81 chapters 
>> ARTICLE
It's the same amount. They just like to name the chapters differently. Murata does the remake of the ONE version, and he releases his chapters in batches. Some scanlators count the batch release as chapters, others count the completed chapter as chapter
>> ARTICLE
Batoto has the webcomic but not the manga, I think.

I don't know if we'll get this far but I'm excited to see [Spoilers](/s "Super Serious Series: Serious Consecutive Side Hops").

Oh wait, Madhouse aren't know for second seasons. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
They are still a company, if this show does really well they will make a second season for the guaranteed $$$. People overestimate how good some shows sell and think they should have a second season when in reality they didn't make the company that much money. I have a feeling OPM will sell like hotcakes. 
>> ARTICLE
> if this show does really well they will make a second season for the guaranteed $$$

Tell that to those of us who watched No Game No Life.

[](#WRYYY)
>> ARTICLE
Like I said, people tend to overestimate how much the show makes for them. It sold 8kish for the first volume which while pretty good, but that's not free money territory for the company. The light novel sales likely don't help them at all, and most likely the light novel producers won't give support for more than one season as shows are expensive. Fate/zero is a show that is in free money territory with over 35k sales for the first volume, that's what I'm talking about. If you sell more than 20k then the odds of a second season are very high, Shaft and Ufotable are both milking their series for all their worth because they have extremely high sales. NGNL was an above average selling show, but nothing compared to gatari or the Fate series.

Can't wait to see Genos in all his animated glory. Time to watch.

E: Late to watching it since I got locked out of my apartment for one and a half hours. Damn, those fights were beast! 

I sorta skimmed over Genos's backstory in the manga since it was told in like a few condensed speech bubbles, but man do you really feel for him in the anime. I have a feeling Dr. Stench, or whatever he's called in the anime, the scientist who turned him into a cyborg to clear up after the crazed cyborg was in fact responsible for the aforementioned incident and is trying to atone for the tragedy he caused. Though with One-Punch Man you can never really know.

You have already seen a MINION of someone at god level. But you wouldn't be able to identify what I am talking about unless you read the web comic. Even then, you might miss the clues.

Basically someone at God level was portrayed in the web comic, but not yet fought.

Nope. Noone that strong has showed up yet.

Once again my thoughts as I'm watching:

* Strongest mosquito ever.


* I know this gets said about every city in a super hero story but seriously why does anyone even live here? The city got destroyed like 4 times just in the last episode. and now there's piranha 3d mosquito's flying around.


* That op. That falsetto. So much hype. 


* He didn't just get a death flag, he stole it from Sean Bean and sprinted through a pit of fire with it.


* And the newest monster girl is...


* Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. That is not how you villain. You're supposed to answer the question and explain your evil plan for 5 minutes before you try to kill them. Have you never seen a shounen before?


* Misquitto girl forgot that bug type Pokemon are weak to fire. Seriously though that would be like throwing out a Venasaur against a Gyarados only to realize that the Gyarados knows Fire blast.


* How do you just stumble upon that? "Oh is it another apocalypse?"


* Are you proud of yourself for that joke? I imagine that in his down time he just comes up with terrible dad jokes and puns.


* This show's timing is impeccable. I'm literally laughing out loud. It's also amazingly self aware.


* i really want that lean to avoid the claw swipe to be an edited gif of him dodging something. Downvotes maybe?


* I don't think I've ever seen a character who is simultaneously so OP and bored.


* I knew he'd pop up, but holy shit that face. That needs to be a new comment face now. Five minutes later and I'm still laughing at it.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think I could wait an entire week for the new episode, but I did, and I'm about to enjoy the hell out of this week's episode.

Edit: I enjoyed the *hell* out of this episode.
>> ARTICLE
A week is a blessing for the manga readers. Can you imagine waiting every month or two for a small update? 
>> ARTICLE
Bitch please, I've followed Hunter X Hunter.
>> ARTICLE
I read Berserk, so yes, I absolutely can imagine that.
>> ARTICLE

Saitama vs Mosquito was hilarious.

Genos vs Mosquito girl was absolutely awesome to watch.

Saitama bitch slapping Mosquito girl was hilarious.

Genos telling his story and speeding up throughout was absolutely hilarious.

Saitama+Genos vs House of evolution beasts was epic.

This is AOTY no friggin doubt.

After credits scene btw.

This is the hypest show this season by a lot and so far it's living up to it.

That's where I ended up watching it last week haha

I'm just hijacking this comment to ask you to not link directly to the OPM episodes in the future. The link to the episode itself is region dependent and a link for a different region won't work and will display a "this video is not available in your region" error.

For example, here's a link that works for me, but it will probably throw an error for you: http://www.daisuki.net/anime/watch/ONEPUNCHMAN/yqd

It would be better if you linked to the series page instead of the episode: http://www.daisuki.net/anime/watch/ONEPUNCHMAN/

[I thought I was gonna laugh at this series, but man.](http://puu.sh/kGxFP/d70d05f6dd.jpg) This is the most fun I've had with an adaptation in a while. Madhouse are doing an excellent job of mixxing the humor and action together. This shit is hilarious.

Daisuki isn't available in my country, and Hulu ain't available in my country either.

On top of that Crunchyroll has been having buffering problems recently and for some reason Netflix is broken for me today too.

You know you've done something right in your life if you are fapping to an anthropomorphic mosquito woman. 
I liked her appearance in the manga better although(the face sold it to me.. yes the face).

So far OPM seems like a pretty good manga adaptation.

I didn't understand the hype before the first episode aired but now I do.

I can't remember the last time I got as into an anime as I have with this one. Everything about it is just extremely well done, the animation, the writing, and all of the characters fit perfectly. It was so awesome to see Genos animated, he's such a badass

I have got to say. The Opening is pretty damn sexy.

I've always loved how Saitama can kill anything with one punch, but takes hundreds of attempts to kill one tiny mosquito.

And thus ended the short reign of the most glamorous woman in OPM.  The Queen is dead!  All hail the Queen!

Another amazing episode! Watched it with my younger sister, as I did with the first episode. She laughed so hard at the scenes with Saitama after Genos incinerated all the mosquitos and the "Found you" scene. This show is so much fun.
>> ARTICLE
Mosquito musume you say? Quick, call Rachne.

Anyway, I feel like from here on out, I'm going to be here each week saying how amazing this show is. And that's kind of boring :O
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck, my sides.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama's expression bouncing between serious, nonchalant, and humorless is priceless. The action - Oh my goodness - The action is sublime! The fluidity of animation and the pacing of every second of tension is so well done, it flowed together into such gratuitous bliss.

Everything about this episode made me so happy- Except for when the credits rolled, and I was reminded there is only so much to be seen.

NEED. MORE!

Edit: On the bright side, I have double 3-day weekends this week, the wait will *feel* much shorter for me. n_n

Beast King actually looked pretty badass. Real nice character design. Oop he's dead now.

"Consecutive Normal Punches."

These are his normal punches. They don't completely murder you quite as much.

Question: Can anyone translate the ED? It looks so out of place compared to the rest of the show it feels like it's supposed to be a parody of a stereotypical anime ED or something. You won't even realize which anime it's from if its the first time you're watching.

Can't wait to see her animated, even a little. Since I don't think the anime will reach the part where she become more prominent in the series.

Holy shit Saitama slapping the mosquito with that stupid smile on his face after that super serious battle had me bust out the best laugh I've had in forever. This is too good.

I like how the shows takes into account real-ish physics too. Genos spinning his arms after he got sent flying by Mosquito Girl to slow down his momentum was good, but seeing him use the burners in his palms to gain spinning momentum for a kick on the gorilla was even better.

EPISODE 2 CONTINUES THE HYPE TRAIN

CHOO CHOO

This is one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. They've managed to adapt the frenetic dynamism to animation perfectly, and the comedic timing is spot on.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is pure awesomeness.

So many fight scenes and with good ol' key animation. Not a CGI in sight.

Saitama is really funny. I love his different facial gestures in different situations.

The opening is really nice and all action-y. Can't say the same for the calm ED though.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Can't believe how much this show has lived up to its hype! Probably one of the most enjoyable shows I've seen and it's only the 2nd episode!
>> ARTICLE
This is the first anime I've ever watched on a week by week basis as it originally aired, and I've never read the OPM webcomic or manga before. 

Needless to say, despite having watched a decent amount of anime I have no goddamn idea what to expect at this point and I'm loving every moment of this show. This episode was fucking hilarious, and I really like that there are side characters like Genos that can provide more conventional action sequences alongside Saitama's comically one-sided fights.
>> ARTICLE
This show is a fucking gif factory.
>> ARTICLE
Manga too. Some chapters have visible fps.
>> ARTICLE
I'll try to keep this to 20 words or less:

HOLY SHIT THIS ANIME IS GOING TO SPOIL ME, THERE BETTER BE MORE SUPER-ANIMATOR COLLABORATIONS LIKE THIS TO COME.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit that Genos backstory had me laughing in tears hahaha
And did anyone else got surprised when Saitama suddenly appeared outta nowhere? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm still in shock that this is all happening. It's fantastic. I'm hyped for next episode.
>> ARTICLE
OnePunch man, the latest in jumpscares. (You have seen the episode, you know whatface/moment im talking of here). 

I'm enjoying every second of this as its finally animated... and already dreading when it's over.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, since I read the manga and knew it would happen, I didn't even realize it'd be considered a jump scare.

Pretty cool touch, though.
>> ARTICLE
I was expecting him to appear on the side like the manga but nearly shat my pants when Saitama appeared in the middle lol
>> ARTICLE
This show is too good. Amazing animation, good comedy (especially ones poking at tropes like the overly long backstory), good music and foreshadowing for more good things to come. This is how to hook a viewer.

Wonder if anyone knows how many episodes this will have? I want 100+.
>> ARTICLE
Well we learned setting important today and that is that Saitama is able to call time out in the middle of a fight.

I still have to say, my favourite part of the opening is the happy star about to shank him with a knife just get utterly destroyed.
>> ARTICLE
OP man is like a lv99 human in a world of some lv10-30 supeheroes and all of us lv2 humans, i bet he just found a good area to farm exp

This show is my jam.
>> ARTICLE
Reminder that there's always a scene after the credits; don't stop watching.

Just saying because it seems like half the time there's a show with stingers, no one notices.
>> ARTICLE
The first two episodes have had a good balance of humour and crazy, brilliantly animated action sequences. This show is right up my street and I hope it continues as it's started. 

I knew literally nothing of this series going in. Never read the manga - is the anime adaptation being entirely faithful to it? 
>> ARTICLE
100% faithful? No. However, the variations are extremely minor. The plots and panels are all done the same. It still might diverge in the future but so far it can be considered in spirit to the original.
>> ARTICLE
is it just me or did that mantis man bursting the wall and the slug man "sensing" him is a FTL reference ?
>> ARTICLE
My favorite part? "Bozo Cyborgu" 
>> ARTICLE
They skipped the part where he compares his opponents to insects while swatting that mosquito, I guess they didn't want to repeat the monologue from ep1. Making it silent was still funny in a different way.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking God-Tier. 
>> ARTICLE
Anime is saved. One Punch at a time.
>> ARTICLE
Someone please freshen my memory; did he use Consecutive Normal Punches in the manga at this point? I thought the first time he used it was way later in the [Manga spoilers](/s "Alien invasion arc")?
>> ARTICLE
Yes he used it as a counter to the beast king's ultimate move.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if it's too early to call this an INSTANT CLASSIC
>> ARTICLE
Okay, this series is awesome. I have had huge problems with watching anime for a long time now. They just make all the awesomeness of manga so... slow. And they change the humor and add stupid shit way too often. I'm not just talking about filler episodes, I'm talking about adding unnecessary and boring stuff in to the proper episodes themselves. 

So, I went into One Punch Man expecting it to be ruined like they did with Beelsebub, which was simply the funniest manga I've ever read, but was totally ruined in the anime version, where they thought that the baby crying and electrocuting everyone was the pinnacle of good humor. 

Anyway, this is AWESOME. It captures the humor of the comic and doesn't add unnecessary shit. The animation is superb and there's no needless shit so far. It's just... so well done. If only this was done more with anime. I know, there are plenty good adaptations, but there are way more ruined ones. 

>> ARTICLE
Poor Cyborg has real trouble keeping up with his master.

i havent enjoyed a shonen this much since... i cant even remember!

this is literally all i could have asked for!

One Punch Man is a seinen though..
>> ARTICLE
Another great episode! After seeing Genos vs. Mosquito Girl, I can't wait to see some of the later non-Saitama fights animated. Madhouse have done an excellent job. Hopefully this gets a S2 once the manga finishes adapting the next arc!
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god I can't wait 7 days for this every time. We need to divert all the worlds resources to One-Punch man episodes and put them out daily.
>> ARTICLE
This OST is fucking amazing, it does a perfect job of hyping up the fights even if we know who is going to win. Kind of a weird choice for the ED though, but I like it anyway.
>> ARTICLE
saitama is the boss

>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed this episode it was very entertaining especially when saitama was trying to kill that lone mosquito lol

If there is one thing that i learned from watching this episode,
Its that Mosquitos suck

This satisfies the same itch that "The Tick" scratched, only better drawn, with better protagonists, and better jokes.

 Did not read either the original or the redraw, but i have a feeling that his cactus is going to be as important as the plant which Leon had in *Leon the Professional*. Can't wait to see him getting absolutely furious when someone is going to touch his cactus.

Something I noticed: at the start of the OP, it shows Saitama staring down a traditional-stylized tiger, an ogre (demon), a dragon, and a divine-looking thing (god), which correspond to the threat levels used in the show.

There's also wolf level but that doesn't appear.

because plot

sorta

Because of how easy it is to be a villain in this series it kinda makes a lot of sense.
>> ARTICLE
wha? eating so many crabs you turn into a crabman is not an easy path! i bet each of these villains have a deep and captivating past

[ie](/s "phoenix man, who wore a bird costume so long he fused with it and gained extraordinary powers. he probably lost all his friends and family from the stink of the bird suit, and it probably itched real bad, but he stuck through it and became a supervillian!")

Kinda the same with the opening, don't you see? It makes one think he's gonna watch a series that's 100% of pure epic action without end...and we get Saitama and mosquitos that suck XD I think the point of both is making totally opposite contrast with the series itself :P

can someone please explain to me why is everyone and their overpriced body pillows is talking about this anime. even before it even started airing? whats all the hype about? (serious question)
>> ARTICLE
The manga is really awesome. We didn't expect it to adapt well to anime. Then they pre-aired the first episode last month, and it blew all of our expectations away, by being actually better than the manga. It's awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched it yet? The animation on its own is pretty good, but the memorable gags are yet to come. It just gets more hilarious as time passes...at least as far as a first season would be concerned. It does eventually step back and get...a little serious. I don't think they'll make it that far in season one, and I'm okay with that.

Yeah, I'm thinking this show isn't for me. It looks nice enough but the premise just doesn't interest me.

Why would you consider it overrated? It's receiving exactly as much praise as I think it deserves. 

It's just... So well executed. 

I actually don't know if it's as mainstream in Japan as WSJ titles like Bleach, but it's certainly very popular and for a reason.

i never seen normal nonMS anime got this many upvotes before on this sub
>> ARTICLE
"Its popular, so it must suck."

I think you can compare it to UBW which, at its best, garnered around half the upvotes. 

That was hype that...didn't pan out as well as this. Diehard fans enjoyed the adaptation but it wasn't really great anime in the sense that this is, so more people didn't participate in the discussion. Also there were more people who probably just didn't watch. 

By comparison, the simpler world, less reliance on reading the source material, the better animation (these fights are far more fun to watch than UBW), and the avoidance of simply relying on the standard tropes sets this show apart.

That twat saying that Sea King was a weak monster and Saitama was a fraud pissed me off *WAY* more than it should have!

He's the "le epic trole" neckbeard that is all talk but nothing to show for it. Turns into a coward when someone challenges his words and demands him to act on them.
>> ARTICLE
I can see why though. 

You see these heroes standing up when they're scared shitless to stall time, Mumen rider going in when he knows he's fucked, and Genos almost dying to save the little girl, and then this dick comes along and says "yeah, y'all just suck, you didn't do anything at all"
>> ARTICLE
I mean, yeah, but at the same time this is the guy that destroyed a giant meteor, even with the help of S classes like they believe. 

If anything, the ranking system was fraudulent, not Saitama, the Sea King, or the heroes he defeated. Saitama is a better person than all of us, I would've punched that fucker
>> ARTICLE
Seemed more like there were rumors that Saitama just stole credit for the giant meteor though.

Not sure what you mean by the ranking system. Seems generally pretty sound, except how he got placed into C somehow lol
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, if I was the general public and a giant Monster defeated a bunch of Class S, A, B, and C tier heroes, I'd be a little weary if a C class came in and one shot the big bad monster too. Not to the degree of that one dick, but yeah
>> ARTICLE
I agree with this sentiment. We as audience get to see how Genos, Saitama, and the heroes feel. We get to see all the damage. The public only sees flashy effects and ridiculous battles. So when a logic-defying hero like Saitama arrives, doesn't look the part, doesn't act particularly cool or like the other heroes, and delivers a blow faster than you can see, it's completely understandable that the public just wouldn't understand what happened. They can't tell he's that strong. They just see something impossible, so they write it off immediately as fake. And in this episode, they gladly take Saitama's lie because it's easier to believe.

Saitama, if he were more of a megalomaniac, COULD sucker the public by pulling all his punches, having a big fake battle where he's bullshitting the whole time, but that's not what he wants. He wants a legitimate epic fight were he is challenged. The clash of interests makes it impossible for the public to recognize Saitama for what he is.
>> ARTICLE
Even if saitama was weak and was only able to win because the other heroes weakened the monster, there was no one left to fight him. If saitama wasn't there to finish him off they would all die, he didn't deserve that treatment.

The manga on the web has two different versions of this punch.

I'm so glad they chose to adapt this version.
>> ARTICLE
Two versions as in the difference between the ONE comic and the manga? Or was it drawn twice? It's been a while since I read this scene in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
There are TWO version of his punch in the MANGA available on the web.

[Version 1] (http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/onepunchman/images/a/ae/Screen_Shot_2013-08-03_at_9.08.11_PM.png/revision/latest?cb=20130804040953)

[Version 2] (http://40.media.tumblr.com/37b740588b642b009f6daf0c23395205/tumblr_nrc59by3eR1s2hq72o5_r1_1280.jpg) 

They chose one of those two version to print in the physical copies which are getting adapted by this anime. 

It's a personal thing and subjective but I like the version they used in the end way more than the other one! :)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'd have to agree with you. The second version seems more impactful to me than the regular "hype-punch" in the first version.

You literally saw this thing jump through a reinforced bunker, and hit a dude *so hard* that he smashed him through the other side of said reinforced bunker. And those were just the parts that *you saw*. Then this other dude showed up and hit the monster so damn hard that he created an impact shockwave that blew clouds away.

"They weren't heroic at all!"

>At least they had the spine to try and defend you, you worthless piece of shit. They gave their own lives to try and extend yours a bit longer, sure sounds like heroism to me.

"That Class C did everything, they died for nothing!"

>If it weren't for the Class C heroes stepping in, all of the people there would've died the moment the Sea King broke into the shelter. What's more, Genos is the only reason all of them weren't ultimately killed again. Buying time wasn't an option for the common man, and thanks to their sacrifices, Saitama managed to get there in time.

It's like everyone who isn't a hero is a complete fool in this anime. It bugs me how the average person can't seem to form a coherent, logical thought in this show.




>> ARTICLE
> Genos is the only reason all of them weren't ultimately killed again.

Mumen Rider was the true savior this episode to be honest. He took that beating like a man and withheld Genos' death. He put as much of an impact on the Sea King, but by simply being there he stopped the deaths of everyone. If he wasn't there Genos was a guaranteed kill, and given his speed and strength I wouldn't be surprised if he completely throttled everyone there before Saitama even arrived.

To be fair, everyone did their part and you could say that Genos stalled them out just as much. But I would argue that Mumen Rider went the extra mile simply because he went in fully aware that he would make no difference on the situation but gave it effort anyway and succeeded. Genos technically "failed" at his goal to defeat the Sea King and protect everyone, Mumen Rider succeeded in his effort to do *anything* but nothing.

 Frieza/SeaKing both killed/beat up some 'strong' guys Krillin, Piccolo, Gohan/Puri-Puri-Prisoner, Stinger, Sneck Lightning Max. Then killed/beat to near death the MC's partner who's fairly stronger than the previous guys (Vegeta/Genos), and in the end the MC beat the villains ass.

Who's more heroic? Saitama, who never cares about the danger level and always goes out to fight monsters? Or Licenseless Rider, who does the same?

I always loved the idea that Licenseless rider and Saitama are two sides of the same coin. Saitama would have become something like Licenseless rider if he never got his power.

And he would have been happy. Licenseless Rider is literally living Saitama's dream. He always gets to fight opponents that test him, the people and the bureaucracy love him, and he's still able to make a difference. He's basically the quintessential superhero. 

I also really loved their relationship at the end. Even if Saitama hides it, you can tell he was slightly hurt that everyone hated him (otherwise he wouldn't be so excited about getting a fanclub). Genos and Mumen would take the sting out of it though.
>> ARTICLE
It's truly beautiful if you think about it. 

Licenseless Rider has the heart and spirit and wants to save everyone even if it means his death, because who will if not him? It's this motivation Saitama is lacking. While for Saitama the working quota is just annoying and pressure, it's a heroic deed for Licenseless Rider.

Saitama has the strength Licenseless Rider admires because it's the strength to save people. He knows that and opens the way for Saitama to get what he wishes for. And he says what only matters after this whole incident. "THANK YOU"

Both of them certainly have something the other admires and craves for. And guess what? This lays the foundation for a good friendship. 
>> ARTICLE
Yoooooo, how can you say Saitama is lacking empathy when he willing painted himself as a cheater just so the other heroes wouldn't be looked down upon?  

Let's not forget the entire reason he even became a hero is because he couldn't just sit back let an innocent kid get killed. The main difference between him and Mumen is that While they both admit they're not strong enough, Saitama actually went and did something about it. 
>> ARTICLE
Loss of empathy may the wrong word; perhaps apathy? Mumen is the definition of proactive, always doing things not required of him. Saitama does hero stuff for fun; the rest of the time he just spends lazying around. 
>> ARTICLE
Saitama is a superhero.

Licenseless Rider is a hero.

and this is why for us manga readers licenseless rider/mumen rider is one of the best heroes out there.

he knows he is to weak to fight against the sea king, but he is willing to protect everyone even if it is impossible.

because, like saitama said, if the heroes run away, who is left to protect everybody?
>> ARTICLE
I love licenseless rider. He's got heart, and even though he knows he would be hurt badly, he tries with all his might!

Licenseless rider is not as good a name as Mumen Rider (a pun on Kamen Rider), so I think his English name should be...

***The Unlicensed Cyclist***

I like the [consonance](https://www.google.com/search?q=consonance&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) to that name. Or... it can go with Licenseless Cyclist, which doubles down on the "l" sounds and the "s" sounds

> he knows he is to weak to fight against the sea king, but he is willing to protect everyone even if it is impossible.

Reminds me of Touma.
>> ARTICLE
I could see the resemblance. Although, isn't there just a small difference?

Licenseless Rider believes in what he does because that's what he thinks heroes should do. Touma does what he does because he doesn't believe in heroes and that's what people should do regardless.


Reminds me of what Touma said to Accelerator during [](/s "their second fight.")

[](/s "Does a Level 0 like me really seem that incredible?! Hero? Villain? Stop kidding around! Cant you save someone if youre not standing
at that spot?! In front of your eyes are people that dont wish to cry that are crying! In front of your eyes are people that can only clench their teeth while struggling and cant even say the words please save me! Is that not enough!! Just step up already!!

**Edit 2:** I'm assuming /u/Enigmaboob isn't talking about the Choronzon theory, but about the Imagine Breaker itself.
>> ARTICLE
His power only negates other powers, he's more or less screwed against people who don't strictly rely on powers.
>> ARTICLE
And even then, he can't negate powers that are too strong. Angel Class power will overwhelm and crush him before Imagine Breaker can even begin to put a dent in it. /u/Enigmaboob's comment is blatantly false, but somehow has 35 points. I don't know what the fuck is going on.

Okay did anybody legitimately tear up a bit when Licenseless Rider was giving his speech, and everyone started cheering him on? 

Did not expect a moment like that from this show, wow
>> ARTICLE
I was doing my best not to let the tears out, like how did this happen.
>> ARTICLE
"Hey, it stopped raining."

No. No, Saitama, it didn't...
>> ARTICLE
Saitama's selfless act was also tearjerker.


>> ARTICLE
Saitama is like the hero for heroes
>> ARTICLE
The King of Heroes, you may say.

Genos' reaction when Saitama takes the bullet sealed the deal.

This episode was, to me, the best so far. It wasn't the most action packed, but it had these huge characters moments that make me love it so much more.
>> ARTICLE
Season 2 better happen Madhouse. Each arc and fight gets more hype.
>> ARTICLE
There's no season 2. There won't be for 2 or 3 years at least.
>> ARTICLE
try 4 or 5 unless by some miracle of god the team is fully able to come back together. Doubt Madhouse would even think of a S2 without the current animating team, madhouse would get a lot of shit for a massive quality drop.
>> ARTICLE
There's not enough material right now for a second season unless they adapt the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I just hope it comes *eventually*.
>> ARTICLE
I like most characters in this show...but the public are just huge jerks.
>> ARTICLE
It's kinda realistic though in a way?  

If there were really superheroes, they'd probably be trashed non-stop by a vocal minority, especially on anonymous forums like reddit.
>> ARTICLE
This time they were actually quite cool, except that one brat of course. We all were waiting for that one dude to punch him in the face xD

How can anyone not root for this guy?
>> ARTICLE
The hero we do not need nor deserve but want to aspire to be.
>> ARTICLE
Did they really add extra scenes to the Genos vs Sea King fight?! 

My god these people know what they are doing. And they do it perfectly!
>> ARTICLE
I really hope they do it too with "THAT" fight.
>> ARTICLE
tbh they dont even need to do that. I just want them to adapt Saitamas [](/s "Serious Punch") like it was in the Manga.
>> ARTICLE
Licenseless Rider is who we should all aspire to be.
>> ARTICLE
Actually LL Rider and Saitama are quite similar. Both do it not for fame or ranks, but because they want to do it, weather they succeed or not. That's what everyone should aspire. 

Because in life, the things you're most fond of is the thing you love the most doing. Great and touching episode
>> ARTICLE
yeah I had never got all the hype for Mumen Rider from the sub as an anime watcher, but this episode really sealed the deal with him being a legend. 
>> ARTICLE
I dunno. I think we'd just die before we even had the chance to start our moving speech.

We'd die just by thinking about the exercise we would get riding a bicycle... oh the horror.

We'd die panicking from the idea of going outside, before we reach the bike.

I'm glad they added that Puri-Puri Prisoner scene at the hospital.

It was not it the manga but it adds more depth to his character which I already loved.

Holy shit, we are already at episode 9, only 3 more episodes to go :'(  
Time freaking flies as fast as saitama can run. Madhouse please give us a second season.  
I would do 100 push ups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats, 10 km (oh and a banana every morning) for the rest of my life if a second season is released.

Everyone is giving Mumen Rider his well deserved praise, but I think people are overlooking Genos' character growth. In his first appearance, the battle with mosquito girl, he is so focused on killing her that he used incineration with a bystander as collateral damage. Granted it was Saitama, but Genos didn't know that at the time. In this fight Genos threw himself in the way of the acid knowing that he wasn't only inconveniencing himself, but risking death. They talk about in later manga chapters how Saitama changed Genos' disposition, but it's nice to see the results. 
>> ARTICLE
Genos just forgot there was a bystander there. He even said he was free to fire away because he already confirmed there was no living human within 500 meters. He actually is always focused on collateral damage just like in the Meteor episode.

This was one of the most satisfying arcs I've ever read in a manga, and they did an amazing job translating it to the screen. I'm really excited to see what they do with the next big villain. 

I love how this series can have its cake and eat it too, with both super intense, dramatic fights between evenly matched opponents and hilariously one-sided bouts between saitama and literally everyone else.

Also, I did [an analysis of the OP](https://youtu.be/syXo_JeSzuE) that I think you guys might enjoy, though it's best for people up to date with the manga.

Wow all they had to do was play the guitar version of what is usually their epic main theme OST and suddenly i'm feeling super emotional over Saitama and licenseless rider

And that folks is why Licenseless Rider is the best hero EVER. Even though he knew that the odds were against him, he still fought. What a saint!

I think I might have cried during that scene.

Damn Saitama channeling his inner Hachiman on this last one. Now we just need the saitama ->8man->batman to complete the cycle

I actually nearly cried when Licenseless was giving that speech and everyone cried and stuff.

Now I understand why Mumen Rider was regarded so highly. That's some true display of heroism. All of his interactions with Saitama were incredible as well, I really hope to see more of him.

The music in this series has been incredible, OST / BGM or whatever, but the piece that was playing during the Mumen Rider flashback was so incredibly fitting and just made that moment so much better.

The moment that slimy scumbag started the whole "he wasn't that strong" got me so goddamn mad. Did these guys not notice that Saitama punched the fucking rain away? Saitama throwing himself under the buss like that hurt, but that has earned him so much respect as a character from me.
>> ARTICLE
This episode went from feels to comedy in 3 sec.
>> ARTICLE
with one punch
>> ARTICLE
It irks me that the hero association obviously knows that he is that powerful. I understand that it is part of the comedy but when he broke every record an s-class set, then they have the recording of him vs sea king and he punches faster than the camera can record, you would think they would acknowledge him.

Saitama is actually so cool though, i mean he's actually a fucking hero.  
He doesnt want to get praised upon because of what happened to the other heroes so he makes himself look like a dick.  
Now that's a hero
>> ARTICLE
Licenseless Rider was the real MVP this episode. Both of his moments when taking on the Sea King and when he thanked Saitama were both really emotional scenes for me. 

A thing that's irked me in the series was the fact that Saitama doesn't get the credit he deserves for stuff he's done. But I actually liked how he sacrificed his credit in order to preserve the other heroes' reputations. Then I realized, I think I like it better when he has his bros like Genos and Licenseless Rider that knows what he's done.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't expecting this show to give me so many feels ;_; Was fighting to hold back tears at Licenseless Rider's speech, but they just overflowed when Saitama saves all the other heroes reputation by sacrificing his own. 

It was also heart warming that the one thank-you letter amongst all the hatemail was from Licenseless Rider. It doesn't matter to Saitama if the whole world hated him, but it's probably little gestures of appreciation like this that gives him reason to keep being a hero.
>> ARTICLE
I love how they purposefully put Amai mask in this episode, just to juxtapose him with Saitama. That hero obviously goes out of his way to put other heroes down because if they're of poor quality, they'll "make him look bad." For saitama on the hand, he doesn't belittle any of the other heroes' contributions, no matter how small, because in the end, if those weak C class heroes weren't there, it wouldn't have mattered if an S class hero eventually came to save the day. They would've been too late. Saitama obviously realizes that while amai mask doesn't, and puts himself down to raise the other heroes up

Did anyone else get really sad when Puri puri saw that newspaper article about him?
>> ARTICLE
The kid that was cheering Mumen Rider on was the same kid in episode 4 where his balloon got stuck in the tree and Rider got it out the tree.
>> ARTICLE
Normally when a villain is built up into an unstoppable monster, you would expect a hero to struggle with him. I was hyped that Saitama would finally meet a creature worthy of his strength.

When Genos got beaten, my hype got even higher.

And then... One punch(roll credits).

I'm not disappointed because I'm sure when an opponent finally survives the first punch, I'll get that payoff of watching how Saitama reacts. The hype will explode from by body with the force of 1,000 dying suns. Maybe it won't even happen this season. I am prepared for that, considering this series is so much more than combat.

I'm realizing this series is not about fight scenes, power levels, and action. Fighting is secondary to the overall story of a normal salary-man achieving greatness through hard work and determination. The Hero Association's hierarchy as it ties into society, the origin of evil creatures, Saitama's struggle with public approval and proper accreditation for his work...

This world is compelling and complex, full of mystery and emotion. The ending scene between Mumen Rider and Saitama makes up for the public's negative opinion of Saitama as a cheater. Anyone watching this to see a typical Seinen action anime is only focusing on a small fraction of what OPM brings to the table, and will only leave disappointed.

Few thoughts on the episode:

1. I was so hyped for Mumen Rider's speech and was not disappointed! 

2. I know Genos gets torn to shreds pretty frequently, but when he was covered in acid it was so brutal! I'm sure that little girl is scarred for life now.

3. Fuck that pig looking bastard.

As someone who didn't read the manga, I always came to the discussion threads and saw people loving Licenseless Rider. I really didn't know why.

But damn, now I know why. He's amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Real talk: Saitama isn't just my god he's my nigga.

He's the kind of guy who will hold things down. Love this bald headed motherfucker. He (and this anime) make me so happy.

I came so close to crying, tho, when he decided to take one for the hero team and play it off as if he hadn't been the sole fucking reason all them dumbass civilians were saved. You are too good for this world.

ALSO:

I am beginning to believe that if Mumen Rider trained for three years like Saitama then he would be unstoppable. This little man has HEART.

Honestly: Saitama is sooo fucking chill. Had it been me getting doubted by the Hero Association and the general public

My response: "First of all, *bitches*"

Fucking love this show.

I think this is one of my most favorite episodes. I love the message and Saitama's character more.

I love Mumen Rider in here, his determination struck a chord in me somehow, barring power differences, he's just like how Saitama would've been at a younger age. He wants to be a hero, not for fame, but because that's what he feels like he should be doing.

Coming off from the meteor episode a couple episodes back, I love the ongoing theme that

A. Being a hero isn't just about power, the fact that Saitama is willing to sacrifice his fame for other heroes who pretty much sacrificed themselves to protect these guys

B. Vitriolic smack talk shouldn't prevent you from doing what you love. Everyone wanting Saitama to quit, and Saitama refusing to have any of it because being a hero is genuinely what he loves to do, and he damn well trained hard enough to achieve that honor. That's a great message in my opinion.

As both a Superhero geek and a OPM fan, this brought me to tears

I've really got to get back to reading this. 
ONE has to be one of my favourite mangakas ever. 
>> ARTICLE
Everyone's gushing over Mumen Rider, but Saitama really impressed me. People who fight even though there's no hope of winning, even though they're weak, are a dime a dozen in storytelling. I've seen this character more times than I can possibly remember. It's easy to fight a losing battle when everyone's cheering you on, because you get to be a hero to people. To actively toss away your reputation to save other people's honor, that's impressive. Saitama acts like he doesn't care what people think of him, but he does care quite a lot. He tries to hide it, but it weighs on him. 

Saitama's a really impressive guy.

>> ARTICLE
I may be inebriated but I cried when mumen rider did his thing, He's my favorite character from the series.

Mumen Rider is the embodiment of what all heroes should strive to become, someone who is fearless in the face of death and will put their life on the line even with knowing the inevitable outcome. 

I know I sound hipster, but when I read the manga way before the anime was even conceivable (both versions) this scene wasn't as emotionally strong for me as it was in the anime adaptation.

I give the MAJOR props to the animation studio that puts out this kind of work, we may be watching their content for free over seas but I am 150% grateful for their work.
The amount of time and effort studios and mangaka put into their work is ridiculous at least to american standards, You never hear the guys at marvel/DC comics working 18 hours+ daily, Thank you ALL Manga/Manhwa And animation studios.

I'v been following anime and manga just like everyone else, albeit probably not as a big a fan as you guys.

Thanks for your continued support of the anime and manga industry, without you guys, before I was born, I'd have never have watched and read all the pillars of manga.

The freelancers working at Madhouse are really delivering as usual, I think that the fact they broke the fight up into two episodes really gave it some weight and helped keep me hooked on what's happening.

Getting really tired of the whole "People accusing Satiama of being a cheat/fraud" thing considering how they *saw him kill the sea king*. But the fact that it isn't a huge source of melodrama for him really makes it less grating.

Really excited for the next arc! From what I read of the manga we're really going to be in for a treat.

So how does one go about joining the mumen/licenseless rider fan club?

Can someone explain to me how Licenseless Rider got into C rank?

He has the hero mentality but doesn't seem like he has the physical power to keep up with anyone. Is it like the opposite of Saitama, where he did shit on the physical exam but aced the written exam? That would secure the whole two sides of the same coin theory which is pretty amazing in my opinion.

C class heros are basically average people in costumes who want to be heros. Licenseless Rider is the one who most consistently showed up to help anyone and everyone, even above the weekly quota so I could see how he's #1.

Alright i don't know if its just me or not but has the DAISUKI stream for OPM been extremely stuttery and almost merging frames recently? I don't know if thats due to server stress or something site wise.

Lowering stream quality to potato level doesn't help either

Mumen Rider too good for this world, too pure.

It bothered me for a while, that Sea King's VA sounded familiar to me. I couldn't put my finger on it until now. It's the same VA for Wang Qi from Kingdom. Both using the same flamboyant tone. :x

Sea King's VA is Rikiya Koyama, he also voiced Kiritsugu from Fate/Zero, Takamura from Hajime no Ippo, Tora from Ushio no Tora and other characters. One of my favorite VAs actually.

One of my favorites too. I first heard him as Captain Yamato from Naruto Shippuden and I've loved hearing him as characters ever since. 

Another favorite of mine that's been in this anime is Unsh Ishizuka. He voiced Ashura Kabuto and I know him as Joseph Joestar. Two really awesome voice actors.

Amazing how easily they managed to swing between action, serious, and hilarious. 
>> ARTICLE
There hasn't been a bro like Saitama since Chamber from Gargantia.
>> ARTICLE
Did Saitama's fist even have contact? Or did the force of the punch blow a hole into Sea King?
>> ARTICLE
Does anybody know which parts of Genos is human? After getting hit by Sea King's acid, it looks like Genos lost all his internal organs. I'm surprised he actually survived. In a previous episode, we saw him eating, but did he have a stomach back then?
>> ARTICLE
There's a lot of bits of him that look like flesh but it's probably artificial or just that color.  

A lot of the parts like face and arms have been totally wrecked or removed before this scene so it's tough to believe that stuff is real or it grew back in there.
>> ARTICLE
It was explained that Doctor Kuseno made him so that he can still taste food so that he can feel more human. The food actually gets converted to energy source for him.
>> ARTICLE
Probably just his brain.

Why is everyone believing rumours, it's not professional at all to make judgment by just some damn rumours. And where the hell are those rumours  coming from, probably that shit talker of an asshole kid 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really think about it when reading the manga, but watching the anime I wonder if there's actually a theme to this series other than just being awesome and hilarious.

It boils down to what really makes a hero, contrasting people like Mumen Rider and Saitama from the rest of the "heroes" that do it for the fame and money.  Saitama is a "true" hero because his motives are mostly pure and he's willing to take the role of a villain in order to make the lesser "heroes" look better.  Mumen Rider is also a "true" hero because he knows his limitations but still faces impossible threats in order to help citizens.

And the REAL theme of it is that it doesn't take super powers to make people heroes.  I got THIS thought because of the strangely out-of-theme end credits, which would normally belong in a "slice-of-life" series.  That would make this series pretty deep in terms of writing and theme.

Shouldn't saitama's ability to punch the rain away sort of let the norms know that he's kind of amazing?

Unless they think the rain stopped in the same moment by coincidence :D

Oh man, when Genos charged up to the Deep Sea King dude I had some serious Gurren Laggan flashbacks.

Jesus Christ, that Mumen Rider scene almost made me cry. God damn.
>> ARTICLE
i dont understand how such a predictable and anti-climactic show manages to be a 10/10 and has me dying to watch the next episode every time
>> ARTICLE
That's just HOW GOOD this is. Saitama's story is probably the ONLY one about an absurdly OP character that makes that WORK (Though seeing as he is THE OP CHARACTER...)
>> ARTICLE
The question is never "can he win?" and more of "how long can they last?"
>> ARTICLE
Best girl has shown its potential
>> ARTICLE
Ok, Mumen is nice and all, but results do matter, and Saitama not only did obtain results, he was the better man and tried to focus all the criticism onto him. 

Here I thought I am going to watch OPM to have fun, and for a couple of episode, all I can get is "damn what fucking scumbags"

And Genos the coolest of them all keeps getting wrecked constantly to prove how powerful are the enemies Saitama is about to KO with one punch.
>> ARTICLE
What made me hate the people this episode wasn't that they ignored what they saw to bash Satima, it was that one idiot was all it took to make them shit on the other heroes, despite seeing them risk their lives and nearly die.

They don't "deserve" any heroes.

Mob mentality is real, and all it takes is one person to steer the group in a direction.

Real people are like that too. It takes only one vocal person to steer the opinion of many people who don't think for themselves.

Did we watch the same episode? One dude told the little brat to be quiet and that the heroes risked their lives, another one grabbed him and was about to punch him in the face. Who else than the little brat was shitting on the heroes?

Licenseless Rider, the hero we both need AND deserve!
>> ARTICLE
I cry when people chanting Mumen rider...
>> ARTICLE
Ah, damn it. I already knew it was coming but I still teared up a little. The music and voice acting was on point during that scene.

Also, lots of KLK vibes throughout the fight scenes that it's almost nostalgic. This has turned out to be one of the best episodes as an adaptation, IMO.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode. That redditor making fun of Saitama should have gotten his face punched in.
>> ARTICLE
Mumen Rider ~~deserves~~ is guarunteed to win the next "Best Guy" competition.

I cried. I literally fucking cried this episode. Also, fuck that asshole, Saitama could've been a legend. I know that's how the story is set up and he was necessary, but fuck that asshole!

And under the rain, Justice stood against the Ruler of the Deep Sea. For even if he had no power, he was still a True Hero. And his heart was so great and his soul burnt so bright that, even when he fell, the Bald One, Savior, was there to hold him, and tell him what the truth with a smile, before ending the Deep One:

"Nice Fight."


...okay, that aside, amazing episode, now everyone who only saw the anime should know what Mumen/Licenseless Rider is a True Hero (Also, his theme song is SO awesome). And dat after credit-scene...God, THE HYPE IS REAL!! IS EVERYONE READY FOR THE BEST ANIME FIGHT OF THE YEAR?! IT'S COOOMIIIINGGG!!

Best episode yet.  11/10.

That was just lovely. What a nice guy Licenceless Rider is. 
>> ARTICLE
MadHouse did an amazing job adapting this arc. Specifically about the Sea king's face. I didn't really get it at first since I've never read this arc in ONE's version but Murata's depiction of the Sea king had two different faces. He also had 2 different versions when Saitama showed up, the art was great but it was at least confusing for me. Madhouse made it look as if the sea king can freely change form from one to the other.

Edit: Wait. Did Saitama just used his left hand? Talk about going easy.
>> ARTICLE
Please season 2 !
>> ARTICLE
Now I get why some many people were hype for Mumen Rider. 
>> ARTICLE
ONE PUNCH
>> ARTICLE
I was hoping the fight to be slightly more elongated such that Saitama got his serious eyes.

Too awesome an anime. And I love the moral values this anime has. Both Saitama and Mumen Rider are amazing characters with amazing personalities.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, it looks like it's beginning to rain.
>> ARTICLE
Really good episode--the fight scenes were fantastic as always! :) That speech by Mumen Rider was really nice as well! Saitama is so selfless by making himself out to be a cheater--I hope people will be more convinced as he moves up in rank and proves how strong he really is and his logic behind becoming a hero in the first place. That one guy was a total dick for downplaying the heroes' efforts. I was hoping the bystanders would deck him in the face a couple of times to shut him up.
>> ARTICLE
I need like the entirety of Mumen/Licenseless Rider's speech screenshotted. That moved me, the feels train was running wild.

With 3 episodes left, all that's left to surprise you anime-only watchers one last time is the greatest arc of the series [besides] (/s "the Garou arc") is none other than [the] (/s "BOROS ARC!!!")

I would torture sea king so bad if i would was saitama, after all sea king can heal every non lethal wound un seconds, that means endless torture

I love how relieved Saitama was after he knew Genos was alive. 

Such Bros
>> ARTICLE
Man I did not expect that from Saitama. He is a real class act! And Mumen rider really has heart.
>> ARTICLE
Well, now, I wasn't expecting to [feel things](http://data.whicdn.com/images/45550600/large.gif) today. 

Mumen Rider, in a single episode, instantly became one of the best characters in the show. Even with how annoying he seemed to me from time to time, I had a feeling that there were parallels between him and Saitama, including their (then-current) C-class rank. Seeing them eat dinner together was a satisfying way to end this two-parter. 
>> ARTICLE
The build up to the punch was awesome. I was so into it. I'm watching with headphones on, when the punch came, the boom was unsuspecting, felt it through my heart
>> ARTICLE
Watching the rest one episode at a time is going to be impossible knowing what's coming, better abstain untill they're all out and then watch them in one sitting.

I for one welcome our new [](/s "alien") overlords

Soooooo, [](/s "When do we get to see Saitama kill the shit out of Boros?")

I hate to say it, but I think Genos is best girl.

mumen rider is the best, most precious. i love the small friendship that is happening between him and saitama. like yes he needs the support. theyre really similar at the core. 
that fight between genos and sea king was amazing. so well done.

>> ARTICLE
Based on the previews,

It looks like boros arc will be done in 3 episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Next arc is going to be so fucking awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't help but laugh at everyone's hopes being dashed away as mumen rider got pummeled but I can see now why all you guys saw him as a true hero 

I thought it was kinda sweet that saitama took a dive for the other heroes so that they could save face. but it looks like some of those guys are pissed off at the fact

Can we please get a gif version of Saitama's final blow on S.K

You can do it mumen rider!!!

Maaaan, seeing Genos all fucked up shocked me too much.

Anyone knows when the OST's are coming out? I really love Genos theme.

A punch so strong, the rain was eradicated.

I was laughing pretty hard at the scene where the ninja is spoiling for action with all his gears and goes....where is the action, guys?!

I felt cockblocked with the one-punch-kill, but the genos fight was nice and both Mumen Rider and Saitama's dedication to being a hero are just so great to see.

Mumen Raider might not be strong physically but he is the hero heroes look up to!

Damn, the seriousness of this anime crept up on me.

What's that song that plays during Genos' attack? Does he have his own theme? (since I recall hearing it the few other fights too)
>> ARTICLE
I've been reading the original for a long time now and to see the anime live in person is pretty much a dream come true. I can't see it with my friends though since I cry throughout every episode, especially License-less Rider's speech today.
>> ARTICLE
and people wonder why some people hate kids 
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful rain when Licenceless rider has his speech
>> ARTICLE
I feel like mumen riders speech would've had more impact if he had actually mentioned the thing saitama told him in the manga that "if all the other heroes run then whose gonna stand up to the danger?" cause I thought that was mumen riders like sole reason for becoming a hero
>> ARTICLE
I just watched the episode again, I can't get over how good this was, the visuals and the story hit me too much
>> ARTICLE
i seriously question why no one was like

"well how come you didnt do anything?"

to that one dude in the group of citizens saying how much do the heroes suck 
>> ARTICLE
The shockwave from Saitama punching seafreak stopped the rain. lol
>> ARTICLE
The anime added something small, that being, Mr Fish only stopped swinging Licenseless Rider into the ground because his sleeve ripped, like it was a complete accident, and Sea King just kinda shrugged and forgot about him.

Oh, and Saitama's trash talk was slightly less epic =( But that's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I remember this being the moment in the manga where my respect for Licenseless rider grew tenfold.
>> ARTICLE
I was really hyped after eight ended and the episode was pretty good in my opinion 
>> ARTICLE
If only Genos wasn't careless and didn't have anyone around to protect, he would have defeated Seaking. Single-handedly. *pun intended*
>> ARTICLE
I do feel that his fighting style definitely makes people view his adversaries as much weaker than they actually are. So while the ranking system seems poorly balanced, his overwhelming power makes everything he fights seem like complete pushovers. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope that Saitama gets recognition for his acts soon. So painful that everyone thinks he's a fraud.

Sidenote, I just got to see Saitama's VA at a convention panel and he was awesome.

Saitama should have destroyed buildings along with the sea monster with his punch to shut people up.

After this episode, I will be forever a Madhouse fanboy

Madhouse is my second favourite studio.

You will hate them when you never receive a second season.

This is the only show that gives me this child like excitement i used to get with dbz and other shows.

I believe this is the last time we are going to hear from the Hero Association discussing Saitama's record breaking exam. It pisses me off that the manga just lets that part go and basically forgets he destroyed the records by a wide margin. If I were them I would test Saitama again and look at him first hand
>> ARTICLE

Exactly. Why not verify?
>> ARTICLE
So as someone who has not read the manga... do the citizens ever stop being idiots and actually realize who is the one helping them and give him proper credit? Or is it just some gag throughout the story?

Saitama's strength is just too absurd to believe even if they saw it with their own eyes.

Genos looks like the chocolate lady from spongebob after the acid got on him

does the chapter on the king happen before or after boros?

is it me or does one of hero association staff looks exactly like mumen rider??....the one with spectacles (maybe this fellow is mumen rider brother or something) because while the other heroes association higher up doubting saitamas OP power he barged in and said "rumor is just rumors" hmm.. 
>> ARTICLE
Mumen Rider reminds me a lot of Masayoshi from Samurai Flamenco. (If this is one cour,) it's hard to believe this series is coming to an end soon.
>> ARTICLE
Knowing the next arc and how well animated everything has been so far I'm really excited for the [](/s "Serious Punch").
>> ARTICLE
Well damn, that was a good episode. Don't you just want to give Licenseless Rider a hug? He tries so hard to help people, it's adorable. 

Animation in this fight scene was also a major step up from the previous episodes. Always good to see.

I just want to see Saitama get some goddamn recognition. He's saved the entire city too many times now, I need him to get the respect he deserves right soon.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama-sensei's Sacrifice and Mumen rider's Speech really is worthy more than those hero called S class haha
>> ARTICLE
So I just caught up (was three episodes behind). 

Everyone is talking about the rider being a hero. But what really struck me as a hero between the asteroid and the ending of this episode is Saitama's willingness to be a hero even if those who he saves don't appreciate what he is really doing. That earns a lot more respect in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Doesnt look like anyone mentioned that this episode basically confirms that Sonic is stronger than Genos
>> ARTICLE
Sea King+ was invulnerable to Sonic- and Sea King+ got a freebie hit on Genos when Genos was overconfident / distracted.

After Genos lost an arm, Genos- went even with Sea King+ until he had to take one for that girl.

Inconclusive.  No idea on how Sonic+ would fare against Sea King+.  Also it *seems like* Genos with 2 arms was doing quite the number on SK+.
>> ARTICLE
No it didn't.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly,  that was my favorite ep. In the end,  Saitama got a real thank you in the form of food.  &  Mozuku! 
>> ARTICLE
While you all appreciate Saitama and Mumen, I'm here fanboying for Genos.

His the A part on Saitama's B part of the cassette tape. He just brings epic fights into the table and always giving his 100%. He also keeps developing new skills as well. Then we switch to side B for that one punch.

YEAH, genos moments are the best, so intense XD

Licenseless Rider is the bike messenger of feels

Please properly tag your spoilers. You can see the sidebar for how to do that.

theoretically if Saitama repeatedly punches behind him, will he not be propelled by the force of the punch? Would that not be a faster way of travel
>> ARTICLE
physics don't apply in this anime, but yes.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode! but how can people be so blind? I mean he literally punched the rain away! how could anyone fake something like that?

BTW someone please make a gif of that punch :)
>> ARTICLE
Memory is incredibley suggestible, there was something I saw a while back (think it was on a charlie brooker screenwipe) where they got people to describe a video of a crime they just saw. If the stooge with them after the video said something like "He had a gun" or "She was wearing blue" with confidence, the real person would agree and recount this later with confidence too.
>> ARTICLE
It's a shame that they didn't put Puri-Puri-Prisoner prison scene in. I guess that's what happens when you have a 12 episode anime... :(
>> ARTICLE
It was a bonus chapter and they don't animate any bonus chapters, not even in the OVAs, unfortunately. 
>> ARTICLE
I teared up a bit when everyone was cheering 'rider on. Good thing Saitama was nearby, though :p
>> ARTICLE
I love the point that Saitama despite trying to look and act all cool when he doesn't need to fight and tries to impress people. But when it really counts he really doesn't care about reputation or fame at all.

Like the fact he made himself the bad guy to make the other heroes and hero association look good. 

Thus making him cool in front of the people who really knows how strong he really is.
>> ARTICLE
All it takes is one thank you note, to make his day.   I got emotional at that bit, he's finally got a fan!
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or did they not cut out the breathing from Amai Mask's lines?
>> ARTICLE
The fucker who said the Sea King was weak rustled my Jimmies.  Heck, if Saitama was actually setting that up, I would actually be MORE scared, since he has the ability to summon up monsters to one punch at will, because said monsters can level cities.

The degree by which the ranking system is busted will become more apparent the longer this goes.
>> ARTICLE
When that asshole started talking, I was like "You fookin' wot m8?".
>> ARTICLE
Baldy for da win
>> ARTICLE
Laugh at me if you want, but I dropped a few tears when the Sea King almost kills Genos.
>> ARTICLE
I guess we found out (grossly) that Genos does have some human parts left. I thought he was basically a brain in a robotic body but I guess not. Look like he still has half a ribcage (seems strange not to replace that, but whatever) and his trap muscles.... don't get it 
>> ARTICLE
In the manga he is portrayed as more mechanical.
>> ARTICLE
My reaction when seeing the asshole making saitama look like a cheater was basically this

"WHY?!"
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know the acoustic guitar song during Genos' flashback?
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know the name of the song being played when Genos fights the sea king?
>> ARTICLE
If he could stop rain, I wonder if he could stop an earthquake, tornado, etc. with one punch.
>> ARTICLE
I think the manga should eventually end with an opponent that - get this - takes a whole TWO punches to be defeated by Saitama. 
>> ARTICLE
I hate seeing these gay character types that force their affections onto straight males. It's Beelzebub all over again, fucking disgusting.

I haven't even watched this series yet, but Saitama is already my spirit animal.

Oh man. Mumen Rider's little speech was really touching. I even shared a few tears when all the people started cheering him on. That little kid he helped out earlier was there as well. [That's the face of a true hero.](http://puu.sh/lD6tK/403ffbebd2.jpg)

[Also, this little shitface right here.](http://puu.sh/lD6GI/82d006fa3c.jpg) I hope he dies a terrible death.

[Genos' face](http://puu.sh/lD761/d14ab960d8.jpg) cracked me up so hard. It's nice to be able to get a laugh off after all those feels.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit disappointed in how Genos was used as a prop to set up Saitama's big appearance. He's a S-class hero and main character in his own right, and I think he deserved a bigger role in the fight than pulling the viewer sympathy card.

That being said, I'm not at all unhappy about how he set up Mumem Rider's heroic appearance. What a legend.
>> ARTICLE
It is unfortunate that Genos is often used as the Worf of the series for Saitama, since he is a cool character. 

That said, an I feel an important undercurrent of the series is that Genos learns how to be a hero from Saitama. And a hero is going to save the civilian, regardless of the cost to himself. I think Genos himself comments on the fact that he could have ended up being more like Metal Knight.
>> ARTICLE
Genos loses most of his fights and always gets torn up despite being a super-cool powerful cyborg in comparison to the goofy-looking Saitama, it's basically the running joke with him.
>> ARTICLE
The entirety of the show is a long sequence to set up Saitama's appearances though.
>> ARTICLE
genos fucked up cuz he let his guard down 
>> ARTICLE
Amazing episode yet again, had me in tears on license less rider's speech and even more for what saitama did. Even though, Saitama wanted recognition for his heroism..... and was doing it for fun, he place himself as a fraud to save the Heroe's Association reputation. Can't wait for Boros Arc... THAT SOUNDTRACK AND PUNCH THOUGH!!! XD
>> ARTICLE
Ah. It feels like it's raining inside my house...
>> ARTICLE
It's actually raining now for me so watching this ep while raining was awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone get the vibe that Licenseless Rider might be Blast?  I don't really think he could be, what with being a punching bag, but somehow I get the vibe that he could be him.

In other news, the OST for OPM is so fucking sick.
>> ARTICLE
The animation in the first half of this episode was glorious. Gotta find out who directed this episode. Also, I have a crazy theory about Mumen Rider.

I think at the end of the series, he may be the one to succeed Saitama as the strongest hero. Like Saitama, he started out as a normal guy who fights because of his passion for protecting others and embodying what it means to be a hero. I think Saitama may take him under his wing and he'll achieve that amazing power by doing 100 push-ups, sit-ups, etc because he has the same hero's soul that Saitama has. Now does he become jaded like Saitama when he gets that power? Who knows.  
>> ARTICLE
Mumen Rider's speech.

Deep Sea King punching Saitama in the back of the head, and his head just bobbling.

Saitama making all the others look good even though he outclassed all of them.

"JUSTICE CRASH!"

This episode and last episode are next level.

I will cry manly tears if there is no season 2.

Edit: also I need a Puri Puri Prisoner spin-off. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh....we weren't meant to laugh at that scene?...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I feel kinda bad laughing at Licenseless Rider but it was like Looney Tunes with him getting swung around by the arm like that.
>> ARTICLE
When they were cheering him on, i just had this shit eating grin. Made me dismiss it as anything serious.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody's commenting on the detail given to the crowd?

I was reminded of Ghibli  (and now that I think of it Kiseijuu too) for some reason.

I'm gonna be honest, this "everyone shit on Saitama" thing is getting old 
>> ARTICLE
It was only one or two people who shit on him, the rest were in gray area about the rumors.

>> ARTICLE
Well you do have a point but the part with Rider was to showcase what Saitama said in some previous episode to Genos about heroes needing to be there to fight, if they just run and hide there's no one left to defend the civilians. The bicycle guy understood this and that's why he was doing everything he could to just stall for time. He didn't know Saitama was gonna show up but he had to buy time for something.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama is so badass he has an S class as his disciple even though he himself is C class. Based.
>> ARTICLE
Like Genos said the exams are a waste of time. How could they give someone as powerful as Saitama a freakin C?
>> ARTICLE
Because, like many senseless associations through the Multiverse, the Hero Association thinks that it's something LOGICAL to make half his exams about 'intelligence'...which is overrated when you're stronger than anything in the Multiverse XD
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's about intelligence but about morale and acting cool as a hero. For example what is more important, listening to the plan of the enemy or hurry for the discount at the supermarket?
>> ARTICLE
Finish the enemy in one punch, then hurry to the discount at the supermarket. 
>> ARTICLE
The Hero Association doesn't believe in silly things like "weighted scores."
>> ARTICLE
He did bad on the written exam, but got a perfect score on the physical exam.
>> ARTICLE
There should be extra credit...
>> ARTICLE
He already got it....
>> ARTICLE
He broke the physical exam.
>> ARTICLE
Which is a common criticism/joke regarding tests in Japan, for anyone confused: focusing more on technical knowledge than practical skill.

I like how they don't speak it outright and leave you to remember that fucking kid.

> remember that fucking kid.

How can you not remember that ~~chin~~ kid?
>> ARTICLE
I thought to myself when they said it was founded 3 years ago that saitama was involved, it was confirmed when they showed that tiny picture of the guy with the chin
>> ARTICLE
Yeah uhhh...they really should translate the silly names. 'Ago' = 'chin'.
>> ARTICLE
the thing i don't understand is why they translate only half the name

"numen raider" and "amai mask" are horrible translations because they don't explain anything about the heroes like full translation would (sweet mask->obsessed with beauty for example) and they sound a lot stupider (what the hell should amai mask mean for a person that doesn't know what amai is? he doesn't have a mask, that's just confusing)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why they don't just put "Chinner" or Sweet Mask" or "License-less Rider". Looks/reads so much better.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah.  When it's a name that obviously references something that the English speaker won't get without the translation, I think it should be translated.  

Chinner works, License-less Rider. The list goes on.

For those wondering: There's a general concensus among the fanbase as for why Saitama scored so poorly on the written test:

"Q: What should you do in when confronted with a dangerous X situation?"

A: "Punch X".


He wasn't wrong, he was just unaccounted for.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because Saitama doesn't care even if he puts civilian's lives in danger(Beefcake's case and meteor.). Genos on the other hand always check if there's a possibility that civilians will get hurt(like in the mosquito or meteor case) so he aced the test.
Association gets it funding from the civilians so they're lives are the highest priority.
>> ARTICLE
He cares, but sometimes he gives too little of a fuck and accidentally creates collateral damage
>> ARTICLE
Saving lives isn't really his top priority though, that is why being a hero is just a hobby for him. Most of the time he can prevent deaths just like with Beefcake. He could have killed Beefcake before Beefcake destroyed City D.
>> ARTICLE
"Q: How would you describe an average Saturday night?"

A: Have to get to the supermarket before the sale ends!
>> ARTICLE
What if X has a hostage?

"Run fast, punch X."
>> ARTICLE
Meteor incoming.  What do you do?

Punch the meteor.


>> ARTICLE

no worries, saitama's punch will create a new sun
>> ARTICLE
Heh that could be true. Or they had to write an essay about the reason they are heroes and he just wrote that it's a hobby.
>> ARTICLE
I could see this being the reason. The people associated with the hero organization put it's reputation and prestige very highly. So I'm assuming his answers didn't align with their mantras. When you look at Genos' long speeches about what his motivations are along with his perfect score you see what the test likely looked for in determining levels of aptitude.

So, right now One Punch Man is a pissing contest between some of the best action animators out there. And it's bloody brilliant. Here's some of the names credited to Episode 5 of One-Punch Man.

This week was a pain in the ass, because AnimatorsCorner.com (Translated credits) was down. So I kind of had to use a Japanese resource which was exactly as fun as it sounds.

**Arifumi Imai** was this week's highlight! Did you enjoy the dramatic fire effects that had such incredible impact that you had to say "wow" out loud? Thank Imai. I mentioned a battle between action animators and Imai was not to be dis-included with [this amazing shot](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/e753be9ea5c82f5cce81c05da5a26c3b.mp4). A lot of his best work before today has come from Wit Studio projects like Attack on Titan and The Rolling Girls as well as some amazing stuff on the Boruto Film.

**Hidehiko Sawada** was Animation Director this week and of course, was a key animator too. He did a lot of brilliant action work on Hunter X Hunter before One Punch Man and his work on OPM continues to shine out.

(I'm afraid this is literally all I have right now, I'll try and update this when the resources update since my kanji is appallingly bad.) EDIT: Actually, that really is all there is in terms of the larger names. It's just that Sawada and Imai did a good enough job to hold up various parts of the episode themselves.

Outside of these, the episode was actually outsourced quite a bit and you'll find a lot of Korean names (Just not the cool Koreans like Sejoon Kim) credited.

Thanks!

I was expecting the Sparring scene to look good, **but they made it look gorgeous.**

I wasn't expecting Snek to sound like Kaiki at all, if anything it's the complete opposite. Looks like they're going to divert a little from the manga and have Sweet Mask play a slightly bigger role in the grand scheme of things. Basically, Madhouse is rescripting Murata's rescript of ONE's version.

No matter how many times I've read it, [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/M2ZcipH.jpg?1) will never not be funny to me. Even better in the anime.

> I knew it was gonna be good because I heard they were outsourcing animators or something? (Correct me if I'm wrong), but THE ANIMATION QUALITY BLEW MY PANTS OFF.

This really depends. Most anime productions are partly animated by outsourced animators. However, the quality of outsourced animation varies. When *Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu.* outsourced large parts (or all) of whole episodes, the results were terrible, likely because they just got the first animators they could get a hold ofI think they mainly got Korean animators. Good animators are usually busy during the middle of the season, so a schedule problem can force studios to hire "less stellar" animators, or, alternatively, hire fewer animators.

In any case, it's pretty rare to think than an outsourced episode is going to have better animation. That could be the case if inviting an expert animation director is considered outsourcing, but outsourcing usually refers to the animators themselves.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, really informative! Thanks so much!
>> ARTICLE
>  When Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu. outsourced large parts (or all) of whole episodes, the results were terrible, likely because they just got the first animators they could get a hold ofI think they mainly got Korean animators.

Yeah, luckily it was only for two or three episodes - the finale was a proper Twintail Galore.

And Blurays fixed the shitty key frames.
>> ARTICLE
i think this time cuz they didn't just did a "outside contracting" but did a "crowd gathering"-esk thing, there they essentiall gathered famous people who has worked together before

so there would not be too much of a jumble

but here's my question, in terms of animation, i understand it's good, but [is it really the best?](http://strawpoll.me/5893073)  comparing to something like a ufotable production

is it really THAT worthy of praise?
>> ARTICLE
I think so, since the anime is gathering the best of the best in the anime industry. I really don't know the exact situation with ufotable, so I won't really know if it would be better animated in that studio compared to Madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
Someone mentioned before that Ufotable does particle effects really well, but their fight scenes are lackluster. Personally, I find them to quick to follow and blows are a blur.

OPM does fight scenes a lot better; you can actually follow what's happening.
>> ARTICLE
UBW fights were quite blurred and speedy, but that was more of a choice for that show. They can do great fight scenes if they choose to, like [this](http://i.imgur.com/4PzBSs7.gifv) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/Dk6ZTyT.gifv) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rfegRjLj0I)
>> ARTICLE
1. How can you judge animation if you link to an SVP'd version? That's just...horrible.

They use like 30 different cuts for each of those scenes, never letting the action speak for itself.

It's like modern Hollywood movies where they cut away from each blow, versus a Jackie Chan movie where the camera follows the characters around a scene as they whack at each other with silly props.

See [this relevant Every Frame a Painting analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ).
>> ARTICLE
First, can you stop downvoting comments that add to discussion but you don't agree with?

Second, this train of conversation was discussing whether you could follow the fights themselves, not about judging animation from these fights. 

As for the cutting: Cutting doesn't inherently change whether you can follow a fight or not-these fights were quite clear in the events occurring. I've already seen the video, and it discussed how the cuts were used to disguise the lack of action because cuts augment the feeling and illusion of action. The fight scenes already have action in them, rather than, say an example from the video, the Guardians of the Galaxy fight. Look at the second link-the camera cuts did augment the action, but it still existed, like in the frame where they traded blows, moved the spear to the side, and then continued-more like a Winter Soldier fight between the Winter Soldier and Captain where the two traded significant blows even without the cuts, but the cuts and camera rotation helped add to the fight.

A valid criticism would be towards the Shiki vs Araya fight, where most of the action was in the cuts and rotations only, but for everyone one of those, you have a straightforward no camera-motion fight like here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peti9MoQJGc&t=2m20s

>> ARTICLE
[This](http://i.imgur.com/ElSjWlX.gif) looks pretty slow speed to me.

That was after the fight had mostly ended and there was only one move left to worry about. Most of the Lancer vs Archer fights are decently faster and a bit hard to keep up with.

ufotable has lots of flashy effects, but their character animation isn't particularly amazing.

You should be comparing with KyoAni or the best of Dogakobo, although those don't really do battle scenes so direct comparison is difficult.
>> ARTICLE
Kara No Kyoukai stuff? F/Z stuff? How good was their character animation there?
>> ARTICLE
It's not as fluid and...animated.

Kara no Kyoukai was choreographed in 3D in a computer, I believe (I saw a gif somewhere showing this?), as the framework for the hand drawings.

These are straight from an animator's imagination.
>> ARTICLE
What about unlimited budget works? I think it's pretty great screen quality there.
>> ARTICLE
That's just flashy particle effects added in post that distract from the actual characters moving.

I think the best animation was in the first episode (Archer versus Lancer) and it otherwise wasn't particularly great.
>> ARTICLE
I had a bone to pick with that Archer vs Lancer scene.  Dat Archer running is just horrible.

But all in all, I think it's all about preference.  Flashy preference apart, they do pay a ton of attention to details.  A lot of people complain how they draw the sand dunes badly, but for those who understand what they are watching especially engineers who knows how the real thing look like, the details is so close to real life it's not even funny.
>> ARTICLE
What made that fight's animation the best?
>> ARTICLE
I thought it felt the most powerful and had great rhythm.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, so each frame being drawn instead of drawing the initials and then animating them using a computer?

Also I don't really see how much less fluid the results were compared to the sudden jaggedness of, say, the Saitama vs Genos one.
>> ARTICLE
No, each frame being hand drawn versus glorified tracing. (It's less obviously tracing than was done in the slow-mo scene in the first episode of FLCL.) Here they allow the models to distort to make motions clearer and to express the power behind the attacks, but the CG tracings were very strictly on model and less powerful.

Also, fluidity of motion has less to do with the cleanliness of the drawings than, well, the motions themselves. The jaggedness of the art is a stylistic imitation of real world motion blur.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the jaggedness of the art part makes sense.

I'm a bit confused one how one would qualify the motions themselves as more smooth or not though. Would this be more frames in between and smoother shifting from frame to frame, and how would one evaluate between better or worse motion.
>> ARTICLE
There is frame count (how many animation frames per second), how many keyframes per second (sometimes you'll see really smooth animation with really jerky direction changes when they tween every frame but don't have enough keyframes), and how well the keyframes themselves are done which is subjective.

Here for the fights they're doing pretty much no tweening at all, with keyframes every two or three frames. So you're getting the pure, unaltered output of the animator (although cleaned up and colored).

So some may be "smoother" with tweening but they can be actually jerkier since the tweener doesn't necessarily know the acceleration that the keyframer intended. (That's also why I don't like SVP, since it only linearly interpolates between frames and magnifies tweening errors.)
>> ARTICLE
> ufotable 

One thing I've always been curious about with ufotable... are a lot of their backgrounds just doctored photos of real places?  Because that's the impression I always got watching Kara no Kyoukai.
>> ARTICLE
I've not noticed that.

You'd be surprised how out-of-place a real photo looks when you try to tonemap it to the limited dynamic range of an anime. That and the framing: a lot of anime shots are far more telephoto (narrow angle) than would be feasible to take a photo of in real life. 

They might trace or use a real photo as a reference, but certainly not merely 'doctoring'.

This episode had a lot of Genos compared to last week so I'm sure Tumblr is gonna have a field day with this one.

The anime version is cool but I love this version too. It would be awesome if they animated this version and included in the Blu-ray or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Technically, it was still animated. We didn't get the first part, but the second where Genos was hitting Saitama's afterimage was in the anime.

The anime one is more extensive; I doubt they would add a five second clip of the first part as a special.

[that sparring session](#gintamathispleasesme)
>> ARTICLE
Snek really had a death wish challenging Saitama like that.

And holy shit, Saitama's punch literally was screaming Death against Genos, what an amazing fight as well.
>> ARTICLE
How much effort do you think Saitama put into hitting Snek? I'm betting he just poked him and was done with it
>> ARTICLE
I think Snek just punched him and the sheer recoil of the impact caused his fist to rebound into his own face. Saitama probably didn't even notice.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama definitely posts on /fit/. He's a NEET, wears an OPPAI hoodie, has a shippable same-sex sidekick...

The scenes with Amai Mask were completely original, including the udon scene. They definitely felt like great details though, given the show in rise of Genos's popularity, how Mask would react to his instant S-rank and how much he can eat as a cyborg.

I like how Genos is giving it all out of himself in the fight, yet destruction, caused by him, is far far lesser than destruction from unfinished Saitama's punch

Sorry Saitama, but Genos has got at least 3 more hero wins than you 1) money 
2) fangirls
3) hair

oh and that ability to get all you can eat udon for free

At times like this i wish this sub was enabled for /r/all to view, can get new potential watchers that might enjoy it as well

Acceptance is the first step towards giving up and becoming a bigger weeb
>> ARTICLE
I cannot be the only one who was giggling during the Saitama vs Genos fight. Laughing because it's been so damn long since we've got such a well made fight with totally OP characters.

When you've seen mediocre animation all year round and then see OP man, you can't help but cry. Not a single CGI in sight. That was animation heaven.

I just hope Saitama doesn't get caught in the rank battle and quickly advances to S-1.

This is so going to be in my Top 3 anime of all time.
>> ARTICLE
so in the anime they showed how devastating Saitama's punch can be, in the manga the only after effects you see is a bunch of dust which is still impressive, but in this episode you see that just the wind pressure was able to blow away a mountain, similar to Genos' laser on the house of evolution

Probably the best part of this is them only paying attention to Genos' overwhelming power and not Saitama's overwhelmingly overoveroverwhelming power. It's made so seriously, too.

The stupid way he dangled from the ceiling by his neck made me laugh so hard I fell out of bed.

AotS.
>> ARTICLE
Why has no one questioned Genos's calling of Saitama "Sensei"? It seems like something that the people in the Association would pick up on, because they think that Genos is so strong S-class, and that Saitama is just a C-class nobody, why would he be calling a C-class Sensei?
>> ARTICLE
According to my karate instructor, in martial arts title of "Sensei" refers to the first person under which you honed your skills. Even if you outrank, become better or move to another school, said person will still be your sensei.

Awesome episode :) But then again, all of OPM episodes are awesome.

Am I the only manga reader who's bothered by Mumen Rider and Amai Mask? The joke works if we understand the word; it sounds silly in Japanese, it should be changed to sound silly in English (IMO).

The animation's been absolutely on point!

Thank you based Madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
I just don't get why we can't have the literal translation of hero names like Licence-less Rider or Sweet Mask. I mean, that's suppose to be the joke. We're not suppose to think Mugen or Amai is a cool hero name. To a Japanese, Amai and Mugen are just literal descriptions of the hero. Why can't we have that too? ;-;


~~Just really salty because I like Licence-less Rider way better. Sorry about that :/~~

Mumen, not Mugen. Mugen is way too badass.

That death-ridden punch Saitama threw at Genos was fucking savage

That sparring scene was beautiful.

A little late on this, but I'm surprised Saitama didn't realize the hero association was founded because of him.

"A passerby by saved his grandchild from a monster" 

And if you look to the top right, you see a man with the same chin that little kid had.

Saitama was the reason the Hero Association was founded, and they just didn't put two and two together.

My fiance rarely watches anime (DBZ, Pokemon, loves GTO which stands out from the others) but Tuesday of every week she asks me when One Punch Man comes out. And Wed. And Thursday.

Honestly, I feel this show is way over hyped so I was trying to be really critical but after this episode, I realize that it is just way too funny. The fight scenes are really well animated, actually, everything in general has fantastic animation, the characters are funny, the OP grew on me, and SAITAMA'S FUCKING FACE!!! At the end of the series, can someone please link me to an image album of all the funny Saitama faces.

Someone please get the webms of the fight scene

The sparring scene is seriously amazing. You simply *have* to frame-step through it; otherwise you can't see Saitama dodging even if you know what to look for (it's clearly shown in the manga volumes though).

2-Only the incredibly unreal heroes through most of media don't succumb before the might of Money XD

It's hilarious how strong Saitama is and the only person who recognizes his strength is Genos. Loved the fight in this episode, looked really awesome. I don't want to wait for the next episode :(

Cant believe I miss this in the manga. Just realize Saitama was the reason the hero association started.

Shouldn't a cyborg have a more advanced phone...or at least have a phone equipped internally?

When Saitama was about to start the physical test I was thinking to myself "Now Saitama, try not to break anyth-" *watches his face get detailed and his eyebrows appear* "Oh fuck!"

And the "fight" when Genos was fantastic. That was some beautiful animation.
>> ARTICLE
I think this anime is in my top 3 right now, absolutely amazing, especially the fight with saitama and genos, great animation.
>> ARTICLE
The Saitama Genos ship is real.
>> ARTICLE
Might be an early overreaction but I hope they keep the anime-original scenes/content to a minimum. The quality takes a noticeable drop when they're not taking frames and drawings from the manga, so I hope they get through to at least chapter 50 by the 12th episode without any side content that detracts too far from the source material. 
>> ARTICLE
The girl shaking Genos hand is the equivalent of the tumblr fandom
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. Up to this point they were 99% faithful to the manga. In this episode they introduced a whole bunch of scenes that flesh out the "behind the scenes" of the Heroes Association, introduced Sweet Mask super early, add some more wacky stuff in the physical test and make the Chinman reference to the kid more subtle.
>> ARTICLE
Man its just sad that many people wont get to see the funny name translations from some characters like Licenseless Rider, Handsomely Masked Sweet Mask, Dr Stench etc.

The names sometimes have hints about the characters or jokes.
>> ARTICLE
If Superman took Cyborg as an apprentice.  I wonder if anyone at DC is watching or maybe Snyder.
>> ARTICLE
The sparring scene with Genos and Saitama... Good lord, that was some of the most badass fighting without any real damage being done to the other person that I've ever seen. 

This show... God damn I love this show, also I love how it seems as though Saitama and Genos were going separate ways to be dramatic only to have that "absolutely not" scene thrown in at the end with Genos moving into Saitamas apartment. Fucking hilarious, I'm completely hooked on this anime. 
>> ARTICLE
So.. where do I sign up for the Oppai hoodie?

By far and beyond my favorite show for the season. It's too bad they don't do the literal translation for the hero names like they do for the manga in the sub. That is my only complaint.

Madhouse has really out done themselves with this.

>> ARTICLE
I'm not a huge action fan but I've rewatched that fight half a dozen times now just to marvel and gawk at it. Plus the humor, highly enjoyable test, and opening the world setting by expanding on the hero association makes this the best episode yet. I'm so pleased with this adaptation and ready to geek out with you all weekly.
>> ARTICLE
How did A class guy get hit in the face without dying? 
>> ARTICLE
Same reason Hammerhead didn't die. Saitama generally avoids killing humans. He hit only as hard as he needs to. The shockwave in the quarry is what happens when he "almost" didn't hold back, just because Genos asked Saitama to show off a little.
>> ARTICLE
That entire fight scene - Well it was really just a practice bout/sparring session... Anyway, it was one of the most glorious things I've ever seen. This episode had so much going for it visually.
>> ARTICLE
why does the licenseless rider a rank c? He should be dead! Remember earlier episode. one punch KO by thugs.
>> ARTICLE
My main man Licenseless Rider is too good to die to some punks like that.

They showed him later lively being interviewed. After all he got the credit for "defeating" the last villains.

Just knocked out.

Also, he may not have a license, but he always wears his helmet when on duty.

So I guess heroes get their superhero name sometime after registration so maybe Saitama will actually be called One Punch Man at some point.

I would pick up the manga this very second if it weren't for the fact that the OST during the Genos fight was also god damn amazing...

I'm just gonna assume Madhouse has an bottomless pile of money hidden somewhere because that fight between Saitama and Genos was beautiful.

And they stated they had an average budget for this.

The bout scene was amazing  
Saitama's physical exams were awesome

One of the few shows where I don't mind if the main character is stupidly overpowered. Love watching Saitama.

One thing that continues to blow my mind is how much design detail goes into these unimportant characters. Like the Lion King or whatever from last episode: he was on the screen for maybe 6 minutes(?) but his character design was so amazingly done

The scene when Genos and Saitama parted on the bridge, I felt so sad.

Well, they *were* the only two to pass the exam. Unless the physical exam is just unfairly difficult (which in all honestly it could be all things considered), it seems that a lot of people didn't do so well on the written portion. I think it's more that Genos is just unnaturally smart, though Saitama is probably a little below average.
>> ARTICLE
It would make sense for them to thin out applicants by making the physical portion of the test much harder considering the amount heroes that have gotten the shit beaten out of them so far.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's that Saitama isn't smart, it's just that his attitude towards it is really different.

Makes me wonder why they haven't sent someone to recruit Saitama. I mean he basically destroyed two huge monsters who could level cities.

No one has seen Saitama. He always arrive at the scene when the people already evacuated or dead because he is always late. He always leaves the scene after blasting the monsters into the oblivion. In the sidestories the only witnesses to his Heroic deed were kids and grandmas.

That will be addressed in future episodes.

Is Genos basically the overclocked version of Ironman? I can't stop drooling.

Genos is what all cyborgs aspire to become.  He's way cooler than Saitama in appearance, origin, attitude, tone.  Genos is an intense dude.  But Saitama is the most powerful mortal in existence.

Them cyborg fighting skills and weapons.

Saitama may be the most powerful existence in existence...

> He's way cooler than Saitama in appearance, origin, attitude, tone

He's such an amazing foil to Saitama.  Good stuff.

That vertical jump test scene...holy crap. I don't think I've laughed at an anime like that. So good.

I love the pacing so far, I was afraid it might move slowly since anime adaptations tend to do that, but it's been really great so far. 
>> ARTICLE
Woke hour early than usually for this.   Worth 100%
>> ARTICLE
The fight was everything I wanted and more!
>> ARTICLE
I'm just speculating, and I haven't read the manga so I'm just throwing ideas out there, so technically it cannot be even considered a spoiler. Is it possible that Saitama's source of power is actually something foreign, and during the manga / anime it will be revealed, that he is actually pretty weak, but something external made him strong? I'm just guessing since he noticed going bald 1.5 year into his 3 year training and he was already pretty strong back then... 
>> ARTICLE
After watching this episode I'm convinced Saitama can fly and just doesn't realize it...
>> ARTICLE
Loved this episode. Newbie crushing backfired, lol.
>> ARTICLE
This episode got me thinking. Considering all the tests are standardized, that means that offscreen, Genos was obliterating the Whack A Mole machine with as much serious indifference as usual.
>> ARTICLE
 I love how over the top every person who fights him is like but he is just like *Did i forget to turn the air conditioner off?*
>> ARTICLE
"Filling time with previews is a common practice in this industry!"
>> ARTICLE
That was far too short.
>> ARTICLE
who the fuck let amai mask in the house
>> ARTICLE
I have to say, with all the hype leading up to this series, the anime has been whelming.  Neither overwhelming, nor underwhelming.  It has lived up to every bit of the hype.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because the first 20 or so chapters were mainly gags instead of fighting and that can't be translated well to screen. Once the stronger enemies show up, the pace picks up.
>> ARTICLE
I think you are misunderstanding my comment.  So far this show is everything it has been hyped up to be and it's still early.
>> ARTICLE
Just as I'm about to watch Na'vi vs Envyus. OPM has higher priority.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't surprised when Saitama was ranked C, he probably fucked the written test haha

He got a 21/50. So it's an F ranking on the written exam lol.

I will gladly take up that udon challenge any day!

This episode has one of the top 3 scenes I was hyped for. The sparing sessions was amazing when I read the manga for the first time. 

I'm a little disappointed they didn't have [this](http://i.imgur.com/xlWvFs8.jpg?1) [scene](http://i.imgur.com/BRWUms4.jpg) in the final shot of the sparring. 
It was badass and hilarious at the same time. Considering the contrast of the "frightening" aura and him asking if he likes udon.

I like Saitama's oppai sweater. :P That mock battle between Genos and Saitama was pretty intense too!
>> ARTICLE
Wait, I think I missed something. Why didn't Saitama get an interview like Genos? Is that why he did so poorly on non-physical portion of the test or did he just not do well period?
>> ARTICLE
The Hero Association suspected Genos had destroyed the House of Evolution building, so interviewed to confirm it. Saitama was not even on their radar.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I was unsure if the interview was specifically for Genos and he didn't realize that or if Saitama just forgot about an interview and everyone was supposed to take it. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think it was specifically for Genos.
>> ARTICLE
Poor Saitama, not getting the rank he deserves.  
But hey, at least that fight scene was awesome.

The only missing thing from that Bridge Scene was License-less rider having a collision with Saitama resulting in Saitama falling off the bridge and getting Retrograde Amnesia.

Im starting to believe the series is going to end at the sea king arc... No problem to me, that shit was awesome! Piru Piru Prisoner is my favorite character kkk ( dont judge me )
I dont think we will be seeing Boros .... it just seems to far, considering the pace the anime is going =/
I hope I am wrong thought! >.>
>> ARTICLE
The opening has all the heroes that come out in the Boros arc,
 along with Saitama's punch at the very ending of the op. Pretty sure the anime will end at the Boros arc. If they need to cut anything out to make space for that, they could easily cut out the kelp monster chapter

They didn't if the preview screen shots are anything to go by.

There's one scene which has a plot-hole with the original web-comic.

It says 12 episodes so possibly this anime would end with Lord Boros? I don't know but if it is that would be beyond EPIC

It all seems to indicate that it will be that way, because in the previews of the anime it was shown when Tatsumaki talked with Saitama the first time, which is when the S-Class gathers, just before the aliens attack :D

That's the volume version.
>> ARTICLE
I said a little
>> ARTICLE
sigh I know the show is a parody but I really want it to get serious like in the dream sequence in the first episode I want him to find his fighting spirit again and actually have a good fight now just have the side character do all the fighting then he comes in and one punches it 
>> ARTICLE
keep watchin bro =D
>> ARTICLE
hmm
>> ARTICLE
You will probably get to see that at the end of the season...but, unlike the dream, he will NEVER get a 'True' challenge, I mean, something that can truly seem to hurt/beat him, because taht's the whole point of his character XP
>> ARTICLE
I would imagine this show to get really dull soon if they dont change up the formula they always have the side characters fight for awile then he comes in and one punches I really hope it does not get dull 
>> ARTICLE
This is probably the ONLY show when the MC can be absurdly overpowered above everything and NEVER get dull. Keep watching and you will know why XD
>> ARTICLE
I am kinda bored with it, its seems to be the same thing each episode have a side character fight half the episode then he one punches them I know its a parody show but really no substance and it will get dull fast i want him to get his fighting spirit back like he did in the dream in the first episode and I really want the story to get serious at some point but I know it will never happen
>> ARTICLE
Why do you keep posting and complaining about the same thing? 
>> ARTICLE
I want people to see it
>> ARTICLE
Then you're really wasting time of your life, bro.
>> ARTICLE
nothing better to do
>> ARTICLE
That's...kind of sad, actually ._.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, the story DOES get serious at several points, just not in the way you may expect. Also, even if he never will really get something that can 'defeat him', for that's the point of the series, you may want to wait to the last chapters of the season to see him find a 'worthy challenge'...but if you don't like the idea in itself, then maybt this series is not for you XP
>> ARTICLE
I'm still not understanding why this is the top anime this season. It's like the least exciting out of the current anime im watching. The animation is awesome, but everything else is so god damn slow. 
>> ARTICLE
What else are you watching that you consider to be more exciting?
>> ARTICLE
Noragami Aragoto is #1 for me, most definitely, every episode has really been 10/10, my expectations have been BLOWN away, at the moment it's leagues ahead out of the anime airing this season. And then there's Gundam IBO, for starters. And there's Heavy Object which i'm finding quite intense and a huge hidden gem to me. I'm also finding Taimadou Gakuen 35 really entertaining, minus the plot, the character interactions and the music is amazing; second to Noragami Aragoto this season, i'm in love with the music. 

One Punch Man is entertaining, but I keep finding myself with my head to the face of my palm when I watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Not your genre then. The majority of watchers love it.
>> ARTICLE
Plot progression takes a backseat to comedy, genre deconstruction, and character interaction. Your expectations match this series about as well as a school girl comedy like K-On talking about their parents secret death and find clues to the killer all in the same episode or two. OPM doesn't work like that. Its how things slowly develop around characters in day to day life, with that daily life being about being heros.

The very first indication about what you should expect is Saitama's laid back attitude about not taking things seriously. The second with Genos's battles with cool explosions and casual gore. That's basically it.
>> ARTICLE
Do the previous characters at least play some part in later arcs? I'm most excited to see Saori Hayami's character because she's Saori Hayami. 
>> ARTICLE
Lots of characters play more and more parts and the arcs go on. They each have their time to shine, but not all, since there are too many. Basically as it goes on Saitama becomes less and less in focus and is only there so the world doesn't explode or as a device to interact and reveal other character's traits.
>> ARTICLE
>Saitama's ~~laid back attitude about not taking things seriously~~ tendency to prioritise the everyday mundane things more than the fights themselves.

Seriously, he wouldn't be as charming if not for the moments of frustrations due to almost missing out on the sale and such. 
>> ARTICLE
When I say laid back and so forth, I mean on the level of large matters, like schooling and career and saving lives. That doesn't mean he can't get mad at dying in video games or someone talking about themselves for 30 minutes straight, or be happy at a good sale going on. Its just on a lower level.

Week1: Too strong for his own good

I was really hoping that they'd just use the manga as keyframes for #7. I mean, it still captures Saitama's lack of shits given, but this might be the first anime where I'm going to regularly think "yeah, this was better-animated *in the manga*."
>> ARTICLE
It looks like they decided to enhance the Sonic vs Hammerhead instead because it looked way better than the manga with the falling rocks.

Also in that same fight there is a rotational hammerhead scene, so I know Madhouse is capable of using the manga keyframes for the Sonic-Saitama fight in the same way, dunno why they didn't decide to do so.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, it had more momentum. Really feels like Sonic is closing in with each jump and about to go for the kill.

Saitama's lack of expression I think is due to Sonic speed and that all that happened in a short time frame.

Which, IMO is really dumb, since nobody who doesn't understand Japanese is gonna understand what the hell Mumen means.  Shit, half the people who read it probably think Mumen is some sort of name.
>> ARTICLE
I just thought that they kept it because its suppose to sounds like Kamen Rider (which his belt obviously is a reference to it). The No-License part was really just them finding a relevant sounding words to make it perfect which it did. I guess one way or the other, its gona lost meaning in translation, and they chose to keep Mumen
>> ARTICLE
Andbody knows what Mumen means ?

I'm guessing it's just a similar sounding word to Kamen, since he's a parodie of Kamen Rider superheroes

Literally means "No-license".

You anime watchers have it nice. You already know that Sonic is a manly man with a manly voice. But we manga readers (by which I mean me) had to read multiple to chapters to finally realize that, yes, this is supposed to be a man.

Stupid Sexy Sonic.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, it happens so often in manga and anime that as soon as I saw the images for Sonic before the anime was even airing, it seemed obvious to me. In a romantic comedy, it's obvious who the "totally not gay" character is, the clumsy one, the "punches you through a wall for making her think embarrassing thoughts" girl, the perv, etc... Action ones have the same thing.

There's rarely a time when an anime or manga surprises me with its character designs. Works like One Punch Man make the ride fun regardless though, which is why I'm enjoying it so much.
>> ARTICLE
I fucking know right
>> ARTICLE
jesus christ do I feel like shit
>> ARTICLE
Sonic is a delicious trap, and he gets trappier as the manga goes on. I don't know if the anime'll adapt far enough for us to really see his curves, but I certainly hope so!
>> ARTICLE
To be totally fair to all of us, the further the chapters we go in the more feminized Sonic seems to look. And with the amount of punishment he gets in certain areas, I wouldn't be surprised if Saitama eliminated his manliness in one punch.
>> ARTICLE
Took me so long to figure that one out.
>> ARTICLE
I feel you man, it wasn't until he was shown without a shirt on that I realized that he was a man, and even then I thought that it was a very flat girl
>> ARTICLE
Sonic=super speed Totsuka
>> ARTICLE
Lol am I the only person who recognized Sonic as a guy right away in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Nop. Knew that he was best guy as soon as I saw him :x
>> ARTICLE
I thought he was a guy at first then I thought he was a girl then I found out for sure that he was a guy. I skipped the seaking arc when I first discovered the manga and sonic is a lot more hour glass shaped in later chapters.

No. I think most of us did.

with his personality he would make a great tsundere. Always chasing Saitama and claiming to hate him and blushing when people question his fixation.

I would additionally add that it probably isn't that nice for a girl to land pelvis first on an unmoving fist regardless of whose fist it is
>> ARTICLE
Eh, can't argue with that.
>> ARTICLE
http://i.imgur.com/7tZRwlg.jpg
>> ARTICLE
Well, being hit by Saitama pretty much anywhere would hurt, I feel...
>> ARTICLE
I think Sonic more walked into Saitama's fist. If Saitama actually went for the punch I don't think Sonic would've survived.
>> ARTICLE
It seemed pretty clear to me that Saitama just raised his fist and Sonic jumped into it, if there was any kind of upward motion in Saitama's fist at the point of impact then Sonic would have definitely become a girl at the very least.
>> ARTICLE
Yeup. And according to Newton's second law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Since he's travelling at more than the speed of sound, he's done quite a bit of work. Impacting his crotch into Saitama's fist at supersonic speed, so it's unclear now whether Sonic's going to remain a guy.

Idk about you, but I definitely saw his bulge

Okay! So, here's a list of the big animation names within One Punch Man Episode 4.

The animation director this time around is Gundam Build Fighters chief mecha animator, **Se Jun Kim**. His effects work is incredibly elaborate and flashy and he also worked as a key animator on the project himself.

**Oda Gosei** is back again. Remember that fight with the Brothers with the super fluid animation? That was him. You may also know his work from Space Dandy and Xam'd.

**Toshiyuki Sato** is back too, in this reunion episode of One Punch Man! He's an animator known for his work on Yozakura Quartet, Yuru Yuri and (like everyone else) Space Dandy. He also did the best cuts from Episode 3 where Genos fought Beetle Dude. (Forgot his name)

**Toda Mai** is an action animator primarily known for his work on Code;Breaker, with [this cut](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/6e18af742bcdce2868a3ec4ccdb7fb14.webm) standing out as a great example of his work.

**Kameda Yoshimichi** is here to stay, it looks like! I've spoken about him before in these posts, but the best point of reference is that underdweller fight from episode 1. [The really cool one.](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/1c14bf39d2aa24c2253327a4ca6c4f33.mp4). Yeah, he's back for Episode 4!

**Norifumi Kugai** is here too! It definitely looks like Shingo Natsume's star cast are here to stay and it's great to see Kugai again. For reference, he was an animator on Space Dandy and he worked on the [second part of the underdweller fight](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/d4d2f2864b9c56845f426c550188081f.mp4).

EDIT:

**Yuuki Watanabe**. I saw this name in the translated credits but I assumed it must be a different one. Yeah, turns out it is the same guy. This is a Doga Kobo animator as part of the Love Lab/YuruYuri/Plastic Memories etc. team. If there's one thing about that team, it's their unmatched character animation work that kind of excels beyond anyone else in the industry. So... it looks like he's on One Punch Man. I'd say that was a surprise, but this staff is crazy right now.

Once again, very very light on Madhouse staff. Less than Episode 3 again. Definitely a project that should be attributed to the names above rather than the faceless "Madhouse did great animation on One Punch Man". When it's worked out exactly who did what, it'll be live on http://sakuga.yshi.org/post?tags=one-punch_man
>> ARTICLE
Hey canipa, do you think it would be a good idea to crosspost your comment to the /r/onepunchman weekly discussion threads as well?

That scene from codebreaker seems scarily similar to an old scene from naruto. 
>> ARTICLE
Funnily enough, Toda Mai also worked on Naruto Shippuden for a time as a key animator. That scene may have been the same guy!

It's this post I look forward to the most after every episode. After the first watch, I've been going back and trying to pick up more detail from each animator's work.

Thanks again, Canipa! I can't pick most of these guys, so hearing who it is is great \^_\^ I have watched enough Build Fighters to be able to pick Se Jun Kim, though. That shot of Sonic charging at Hammerhead down the boulder-gauntlet was definitely Kim.

Yeah. It was definitely either Kim or Kim leering over someone's shoulder whispering "Make it flashier" :P

Spoilers

[Here](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/03/06/chapter-of-one-punch-man-manga-turned-into-incredible-animated-gif) is more of them.
>> ARTICLE
Should note that there are spoilers in that link!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, there are a lot of moments like this in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
how come they couldn't just call him Licenseless rider? 
>> ARTICLE
I guess they wanted to show they were parodying Kamen Rider.
>> ARTICLE
Which is completely obvious, even with the licenseless name, and in turn they completely removed the joke that he has no motorcycle license. Bad translator.
>> ARTICLE
In the official translation of the manga, he's referred to as Mumen Rider. I guess the subbers are going with the official name.
>> ARTICLE
Which is weird because in the anime PV they kept it as license-less rider.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you're thinking.

>> ARTICLE
I was really disappointed they didn't try to replicate the manga version of the scene. Although, I really doubt they could get anywhere close to Murata's level. 
>> ARTICLE
In the anime's defense, it's near impossible to get anywhere close to that scene in the manga. It's just too damn awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Well we have quality like Red Line, but that took 8 years to animate a 2 hour movie.....we wouldn't have this series after a decade with the manga standard 
>> ARTICLE
That moment when a manga has better animation than some anime... 
>> ARTICLE
well, this is actually one of the few mangas that will have better art than the anime no matter what.
>> ARTICLE
That probably depends on what you mean. I doubt I'd believe that the manga is drawn even better than the anime is animated were I to read it. This is probably the best looking anime ever? Yeah? Ever?
>> ARTICLE
MOST manga have better art than the anime

except hunter x hunter's later chapters :c
>> ARTICLE
Really? The anime art has been amazing. The manga isn't better.
>> ARTICLE
*Cough* Prison School *Cough*
>> ARTICLE
what are you talking about? i'd say a vast majority of mangas have better art than the anime. The only one i can think of that was an improvement was Hunter X Hunter and JoJos bizzare adventure

Manga art is better than anime in: One piece, Naruto, Death note, Shokugeki no Souma, D. Gray Man, berserk, Full metal Alchemist, Tokyo Ghoul, Ruroni Kenshin, Hajime no ippo..

anyway, you get my point
>> ARTICLE
[Jitsu wa Watashi wa](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=11048) anime looked better than the mango.

I'd argue that Attack on Titan is a much better looking anime than the manga. Not just with the animation, the character designs are much cleaner overall in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Early chapters for Attack on Titan are really bad. It's like the Japanese Rob Liefeld. 
>> ARTICLE
Thats definitely a good example of that.

IMO a lot of mangas have better art than the anime.

Don't worry this isn't even one of the better examples

Three: Doctor's hairstyle is unbeatable.  
  
Four: It's still physically impossible to give less fucks than Saitama.
>> ARTICLE
So when Sonic landed on Saitama's fist... was he accidentally castrated or something? Or can it only destroy things when he actually does a full wind-up punch?
>> ARTICLE
Saitama said he stop his fist, but momentum carried it forward. So it wasn't a full power normal punch. Also, Hammerhead survived a punch as well. Off day for Saitama or God like self control.
>> ARTICLE
He didn't punched hammerhead but instead he just did a "knock" on his chest, you can clearly see it the manga
>> ARTICLE
He didn't punch Mosquito but look what happened to her
>> ARTICLE
Yea but she was a mosquito and slapping them is what you do.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Saitama elbow-jabbed Hammerhead?
>> ARTICLE
Elbowed jabbed his amour to pieces. Dude has crazy precision. 
>> ARTICLE
Not really. His fist had completely stopped. Sonic practically impaled himself on his fist.

If Saitama had failed to pull his punch, Sonic would certainly be splattered everywhere at the speed of sound.
>> ARTICLE
God-like Self Control  
  
Afterall, he did let Hammerhead live because they're similar 
>> ARTICLE
Saitama saw a little bit of himself in Hammerhead. Unemployed and discouraged. Instead of becoming a villain and hating society, he become a hero for a hobby.

"I'm not so different...from those unemployed guys. One wrong step and I could've been one of them." - Saitama

Also Hammerhead did the helicopter-arms trick just like Saitama did when he was 5.

 I just realised something.
Both OPM and the Marvel X-men universe had hero registrations.

But what makes one publically accepted and the other lead to civil war?

Simple. In X-men, if you don't register you go to jail.
In OPM, if you don't register you don't get paid.

In Marvel, Registration is treated like a requirement and you get nothing but bother for registering. In OPM, they PAY you a salary, and they actually had to reject applicants who don't pass qualifications.

Marvel Universe governments got it all wrong. They used Registration in a way that treat heroes like they are criminals. But in OPM, heroes have no reason not to register. Because in OPM registering makes a hero's life easier. Money, recognitions, services.

To be registered in OPM is like getting access to social services. I guess in the United States, they would call it Communism/free handouts and be against it?
>> ARTICLE
the hero registration in the marvel universe is such BS. if you don't register you're fucked. if you register you are still fucked.

Nice and clean
>> ARTICLE
Maybe my comedy standards are way to low but I actually had to pause the episode from laughing too hard at Saitama's dream.

Knowing absolutely nothing about the source material I had no idea that the hero registry was a thing. I remember Saitama getting stares when he was in the supermarket in the first episode.

I figured he got those stares because of his outfit but maybe it was because literally no one knew who he was because he wasn't on the registry.

The guy's a shoe-in however. There's no way he can fail.

Who voices Sonic? He sounds kinda like Yuki Kaji/Eren Yeager.

Surely, I can't be the only one that noticed the resemblance between Hammerhead and [Spopovich](http://i.imgur.com/2iY9Qm4.png) from Dragon Ball Z.

>> ARTICLE
For anyone that hasn't understood some of the names so far (they're all ridiculous.)

Dr. Kuseno is literally Dr. Stench.

Mumen Rider is literally Licenseless Rider.  A joke about the fact that he doesn't have a motorcycle license.

Blizzard of Hell will hopefully be referred to as Fubuki.

Tornado of Terror will hopefully be referred to as Tatsumaki.

I'm sure there will be more.

>> ARTICLE
Is it weird that as a completely straight heterosexual man I find Sonic attractive? 
>> ARTICLE
Everyone wants Sonic.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny because while watching the episode, having known NOTHING about One Punch Man, never having read the manga, nothing, my main thought throughout the episode was "Wow, Sonic is really hot. I know he's a guy, but he's really really cute. What's wrong with me? Am I gay? Why am I thinking these things?"

And then I go to the comments after the episode, and literally the top most rated comment is that guys think Sonic is sexy. And I breathed a huge sigh of relief that I wasn't the only one who felt that way.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the episode. The License-less Rider introduction was really good, one of my favorite characters.
Some parts were boring but I didn't really like them in the Manga either so I'm not disappointed.

So did Sonic go fast to the hospital to get that crotch checked for any permanent damage? Cause Saitama looked concerned after technical difficulties passed.

>> ARTICLE
I thought I recognised Sonic's voice somewhere. It's friggin' Katsura from Gintama XD
>> ARTICLE
I dunno what's weirder, that the main character of a show called One Punch Man gets bored beating people with one punch or that I never get bored of him beating people with one punch
>> ARTICLE
Scene at the end was the best.

What does it mean to be a hero, or a shounen anime protagonist?

This episode let us see how superficial and flimsy so many motivations are. The ninja had no reason to fight Saitama, or declare him a rival. This episode made that feel entirely contrived, just like the sidekick trope. Of course, they both are, more often than not.

It also held a mirror up to the motivations we accept for villains. Wanting to create a new world is pretty shady framework for wanton destruction. And that's the only difference between hero and villain? One's way of thought? Morals? One's willingness to function within society? All these labels are so abstract, and all these conflicts are so pointless.

This runs parallel to the recognition plot. Not only is it lampshading that trope, but it's asking a question. If heroes aren't rewarded for their merit, what are they rewarded for? One's willingness to function within society? 

I love how this series has done away with all the superficial nonsense that often obstructs any of the larger questions about the genre at large.

its a common facet of manga/anime of the swordsman who cuts so fast blood doesn't have time to spray out until well after the cut.

As each episode of this show comes out it becomes harder and harder to not go read the web comic. I'm absolutely hooked, and not to mention I can't wait for next weeks episode since it will finally have caught up with the manga!

Saitama didn't 'punch him', he himself said so, he just put his fist there to 'threaten' him, but Sonic's momentum carried him crotch first on it at sonic-speeds, and as Saitama's body is resistent enough to survive explosions that end universes and be inmune to any almighty power thanks to his training...well, it hurt him a lot XD

I think many people consider it AotC, if not AotY.  I recommend watching the first two episodes.  If you're still turned off, ~~you're not human~~ it's not for you.  But I think you'll fucking love it!
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it's probably one of the greatest series ever XD As for the plot, is exactly as the title says 'A guy who beats every enemy in one punch'. Now, that may sound boring or stupid, but believe me, this series makes it WORK. Also, this guy isn't an alien or has some fancy power...he's a perfectly 'normal' guy :D In essence, OP-man is a parody to any and all shonen and action manga, mixing priceless comedy with epic fights in a way that's beyond hilarious XD
>> ARTICLE
Yes its good. Go watch it noooooow
>> ARTICLE
So far the consensus seems to be very positive, with fans of the original being pleased at its accuracy to the source material. If you are into shows that poke fun at other shows (in this case making fun of most action anime) then this is definitely good for you.

BASIC PREMISE: A man named Saitama has trained to become the ultimate hero, but he succeeded... too well though. He now is so strong that he can defeat any opponent in one punch (hence the title), but since he craves a challenge he is now bored and apathetic about saving the day. The show is meant to deconstruct the typical invincible hero trope seen in lots of anime, and make many jokes about how overly dramatic it can get.

Hope this helps!

The official manga translation has Mumen Rider too, they wanna make sure you know is a parody of Kamen Rider.

Licence-less Rider is my favorite too tho.
>> ARTICLE
The reason that nobody knows about the mystery of the Ghost Town is because Saitama is really dumb, and really lazy. One way to get recognition of acts is by people reporting them to the Hero Society. Saitama gives no fucks, so everything that has happened in there has been unknown. Nobody knows what he has done or accomplished, and he has never said he did it.

And of course Genos been equally dumb, he never explains this stuff to him until the last minute, and never reports or talks about what they both have done. They are also part of the reason that town is feared by monsters. 
>> ARTICLE
I interpreted that Saitama was actually the mystery. He's caused a lot of damage in that area, and there's no way he would know it was himself. 
>> ARTICLE
He is part of the mistery himself. Just part.

yep...everybody hears powerful monsters were spotted and killed in the town yet no hero is claiming them so must be a even more powerful monster.

Unfortunately, not for at least a year. Murata has to adapt the "second season" stuff first, I think. And he's about... 3/5 way into it? Maybe 1/2. That's when the next good stopping point for an anime season will be.

Huh, I just noticed in number 5. Exploding Shuriken, the middle shuriken (or the one on the top left) isn't spinning. It's drawn as spinning, but it's not animated. To be specific, it's only got one frame and it's bobbing up and down on the image. Whereas the other shuriken have probably 3-4 frames to illustrate the spinning.
>> ARTICLE
It is spinning in the anime. It looks like that particular one only had 2 frames so when the gif was made (dropping frames), it looked like it's not animated.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I went back to check the anime and you're right. Heh, giffing problems.

I like that they used the ONE version of the Chomp scene. More badass when you see the entire blade breaking into pieces instead of the close-up.

In case you're curious, the manga Saitama reads, "Gokiburi Buster", really exists as a one-shot created by the OPM author-radrawer pair of ONE and Yusuke Murata (who are actually credited on the manga itself as that in this episode). It's hilarious.

No but like... Despite him not knowing what the hell he's talking about when motivating Genos, he actually made sense and has a point.

Also Genos pls. This is very sad when you have such popularity and yet you're a housemaid for a guy who does nothing all day currently. And then there's the fact that Saitama gets a badass maid that cleans everything and fixes everything for him. And Saitama totally deserves it for everything he's done too.

You may not have the fame and glory, but you certainly have the easy life, Saitama.

12 Episodes long 

about 80 Manga chapter

It's only 104 webcomic chapters.

Some one should make a clip where Genos reads off all his fan mail from tumbler.

I'm getting the feeling that this is going to be a recurring problem for Saitama. Oh well. They have to promote him at some point...right?

Well... [Mild spoiler](/s "Yes. He gets promted")
>> ARTICLE
Is there ever a point Saitama gets recognized for his insane power? It's actually starting to irk me a little that *the only person in the world* who knows how strong he is despite his numerous feats is Genos. Plus, every time he does something amazing, it's either put off as easy or nobody finds out it was him. How do they not correlate the death of the huge threats in the first episodes with him, like seriously?

:(

Well, I guess I better change my expectations of this or else I'll end up not enjoying the rest of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Though the most recent webcomic chapters are at the point where they pretty much *have* to address how powerful he is soon. There's no beating around the bush for much longer.
>> ARTICLE
Well, after the [One Punch Man Meteor Arc](/s "One S ranker see's Saitama destroy a meteor and becomes a bit like Genos but not a fanboyish. But no, until after the Garou arc, none of the other heroes acknowledge him and even then, guys like Tatsumaki dont rate him much. Fubuki does though and that's all that matters.")
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure that [](/s "Silver Fang and King knew that he's very strong before the Garou arc ended. And in latest chapters pretty sure Tatsumaki is beginning to fear him, as he's completely unphased by her assault and basically tossing him around the city like a rag doll.")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "I'm pretty sure Silver Fang acknowledges Saitama as strong since the meteor arc.

No I mean why doesn't he tell

But he can report to the association can't he? "Yo man, this guy totally rocked the fuck out of everything with ONE OUNCH. I'm a S class hero and I ain't lying!"

That only assumes they are ignorant about what a great guy PriPri is.

Ahh yeah, they'll just accept the fact he's a rapist
>> ARTICLE
That's like saying The Punisher of Marvel is a serial killer. Context is important. But if one can't look beyond superficial elements then one can't appreciate heroism.
>> ARTICLE
He is still a hero because he can rape villains and nobody will call his bullshit on that. 
>> ARTICLE
He stays in prison so that instead of raping guys outside, he just rapes the ones in there. That's the context. Does that make it better? Yeah, nope.
>> ARTICLE
You missed what he does entirely. He watches the news and when ever he hears about a psychopath on the loose, he bust out of prison and grabs the guy, and bring him back for some "re-education".
Essentially he only targets violent criminals, who he PERSONALLY captures and put away. So he makes the streets safe for the civilians.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, he *is* a serial killer.
>> ARTICLE
But is he a serial *murderer*?
>> ARTICLE
He's a satire to the gay relationships that supposedly happen in prisons and he does what he does only to criminals. But at least he is depicted as a badass nonetheless.

When Saitama karate chops Sonic he said "I'm here" which I think its wrong.

When directly translated he actually said "Over here", however since Saitama was busy looking for a bad guy its more likely he's talking to himself "The bad guy is over here" instead of playing hide and seek with Sonic "I am over here"

So there is these powerful monsters that rumor to be in city z (the city where saitama lives), which attract the kombu monster to it. However, there was no monster present. This is probaly because saitama defeated all of them swifty. 

At the end of the episode, it turns out that all that destruction was caused by saitama, leading people to believe that a powerful creature is living there.

Am I right?

Saori Hayami..... god damn, she had like 4 lines in total within this episode and I'm already gushing over her. She sounds great as Fubuki and I'm glad she wasn't typecasted somewhere else (like one of the HA moderators, for example).

Fubuki and Tatsumaki's appearance are anime original. I'm glad Madhouse is aptly rearranging things so more characters would appear in every episode.

Tatsumaki seems a lot more prominent in this than she was in the manga. Probably because they realized how popular she was haha

Haha, the way they completely elided the monster fight and let us imagine what happened.  The shape carved out of that building says it all.  Well, except for the seaweed for dinner.

I think the rumor about the monster is actually about Saitama living there.

Also, I know that Saitama is supposed to be completely overpowered but I want an actual close fight. I feel like we're never getting one. Genos vs the sonic dude would've been epic. I feel like they are about as strong as each other.

>> ARTICLE
[I have bad news for you...](http://imgur.com/a/RZp8c)

We need to wait a bit longer for the glorious goddess Fubuki-sama
>> ARTICLE
God I love the interactions between sonic and saitama. That sword chomp was badass

Tatsumaki is here! I never really liked her all that much compared to Fubuki. Too much of a brat to me.

Sweet! Free Seaweed!

Best girl Fubuki is here!

Poor Saitama. He deserves to be famous too!
>> ARTICLE
And here is my theory about Saitama's power. As we have seen from this episode, he eats the monsters he defeats. That is why his hair fell out and that is why he become a super human.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Saitama would get a lot further in the hero business if he took credit for doing things.

It is rather hilarious that both monsters and humans know of his deeds but no one knows who he is.
>> ARTICLE
No episode next week?
>> ARTICLE
Did you just misinterpret Fubuki saying they are not to be shown on the episode next week?
>> ARTICLE
That's why I'm asking, is there an episode next week?
>> ARTICLE
There should be, unless I'm missing something.
>> ARTICLE
WHY?! HOW?!
>> ARTICLE
No
>> ARTICLE
A little light on action this episode, as well as animation, but hey, we got some great reaction faces so we're all good.
>> ARTICLE
Worry, not, that's because from next week onwards, epic-action is gonna rock XD
>> ARTICLE
>rock

I see what you did there
>> ARTICLE
I know it's the point of the whole anime, but I can't help feeling annoyed when Saitama doesn't get the credit he deserves :/.
>> ARTICLE
Just binge-read all of the manga a few days ago. I'm still not sure if that was a good idea (spoilers and what-not) but it's fun seeing the things I saw in the manga come to life. 
>> ARTICLE
If this keeps going on the path I'm thinking then I can't wait for the next episode as the man tears will flow.[Spoiler](/s "A Meteor and a Sacrifice")
>> ARTICLE
so does the Hero organization ever find out that Saitama is the shit or is it going to be a running gag the whole season?
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry. It's going to be way better then that.
If you want to find out you could read the manga and webcomic.
But this show IS partly about parody.
[Spoiler](/s "They already sort of know that Saitama is strong, he broke all records when he did audition to become a hero.")
But just to say it again, this show is not that serious, that is part of the charm. Just like how Saitama just doesn't give a f*ck.
>> ARTICLE
Well it was hard for this episode to be better than the Saitama vs Genos fight.. In fact all, this episode only made me rewatch that fight like 5 more times.

[I wonder though, what kind of toothpaste OPM uses...](http://i.imgur.com/2XkHnAF.png)

>> ARTICLE
Really late to this, but just noticed a reference to Beelzebub in this episode.  

Anyone remember [Mammon](http://imgur.com/a/WYtqk)?
>> ARTICLE
Ugh, it's frustating to see all these random people not acknowledging the lord and saviour that is Saitama. I really like the episodes, but I hate how nobody but Genos has figured out that Saitama is in fact a monster himself. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, then your frustration will only go on, because the fact that NO ONE recognizes his efforts its actually a recurring 'joke' of the series D= Even all the way to where the manga is now there is barely a handful of people that you can count in 1 hand that does KNOW that he's truly the motherfucking boss O,O
>> ARTICLE
I...like this twist. Can't wait to see how he keeps *not* getting recognized in upcoming episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a mix of 'funny' and 'frustrating', depending of how you see it, but it's hilariously interesting nonetheless XP
>> ARTICLE
But this show will lose it's charm when ppl will think highly of Saitama and when ppl will swarm around him, like what is happening with Genos already.
[Spoiler](/s "Like what vanelladeath said, there are some ppl who will recognise his power because they have seen it in action. But since Saitama himself in the end doesn't really care about all of it, it will mostly stay the same, the only thing that really changes is his rank.")
>> ARTICLE
Hold up.  Is everything getting a bit out of order?  Doesn't the Blizzard Group come along a bit later?
>> ARTICLE
They're just 'showing' the characters to us, like they did with Sweet Mask in the past chapter, to give a bit more background to the series and flesh-out the chapters, I guess XP Also, if you watch again the 'preview' of the next episode you can hear Fubuki complaining that they AREN'T gonna appear next chapter, as her subordinate tells her :P
>> ARTICLE
Wow.  I somehow skipped the last 2 seconds or something.  [I am Megumi Tadokoro](http://i.imgur.com/FUjVrJh.png)
>> ARTICLE
LOL, good reference XD?
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Are you REALLY asking that -_-? Saitama could even take head on all of Ainz spells and get out unharmed XD
>> ARTICLE
People seem to forget that Saitama is embodiment of a concept power. Unless the other character has similar level, e.g. All Fiction, otherwise you cannot defeat a concept
>> ARTICLE
Saitama dodges all of Ainz's spells, and then one-punches him once it gets boring.
>> ARTICLE
This is a great show, but it's still making me a bit sad that Saitama is just not getting recognized for all the important stuff he does. I pray for the day these cocky A-Class Heroes see how good he is.

Also, I'm an anime only watcher, but this whole entire episode was hinting that Saitama is something superhuman/monstrous. Being feared by others while running around? The woman's dog barking at him? A queen bee drawing other monsters near? Feared by humans and monsters alike? "I wouldn't want to face this thing..." I'm definitely expecting a big reveal that will probably shake Saitama's own sense of self. 

Personally, I'm hoping for Saitama learning his true source of power, and becoming torn about whether to become a monster/villain or not.
>> ARTICLE
For how much the anime is likely to cover nah he's not gonna get any recognition really. Not that he cares
>> ARTICLE
You're gonna be truly dissapointed, them. The whole thing about Saitama's character is that THERE IS NO SECRET to his power, he's really just an average guy O,O The whole 'monster' thing and such happenings are just to point out how the world gets screwed in all senses when he passes by but nobody really NOTICES him. Also that NOTHING really fazes him, except to mundane problems of everyday life. The series basically shits on all that 'expectation' things you're getting, because it was created as a parody for any and all action-shonen maga and such XD
>> ARTICLE
Well, thanks for the info, but I hope that's not totally true, since I know the story's still ongoing -- there are still many unknowns. Looking forward to seeing where it goes!
>> ARTICLE
EH, I can tell that you at least will ENJOY the series a lot, especially becase from next chapter on is where the most 'awesome' things start happening, but above the other thing, don't wait with a held breath XP
>> ARTICLE
Why can't they recognize Saitama already :(

>> ARTICLE
Because that 'joke' is, sadly, oneof the main points of the series, so don't expect it happening, like, ever...maybe at the end of the webcomic, whenever that is XP
>> ARTICLE
Sonic wastes himself by being in this anime. Dude's pretty cool, but gets beaten all time.
>> ARTICLE
So apparently Saitama is now a cannibal. 

Well.... apparently one punch man is following the huge quest

https://youtu.be/n0wqhdZn4v0
>> ARTICLE
so..... when does this show get serious?
>> ARTICLE
Dude, seriously, if you're gonna do nothing but complain about the series and try to argue your point over everyone who doesn't think like you every week, why don't you drop it? Let the millions of people that KNOW how awesome is to enjoy it in peace XP
>> ARTICLE
It probably won't change much from what you've already seen.
>> ARTICLE
Well you have to keep in mind that it *is* a parody, and parodies are never serious. But i think episode 8 onwards might be more "serious", as in seriously epic.
>> ARTICLE
Shame ill prob drop it if does not get some good plot soon but it seemed this episode was ok first few had the same formula have a side character fight someone and then he comes in and one shots them meh it gets dull   
>> ARTICLE
he's the victory screen, you are conveniently ignoring other characters' struggles
>> ARTICLE
What struggle kek everyone is op the only struggle I have seen so far is that he is sad that he got a C because he is braindead and failed the intelligence exam. I want a villian he cant one punch I want him to have his fighting spirit like he did in the dream sequence. Im not against comedy but when your whole show is nothing but the same joke over and over again it gets dry and one punch man so far is dry
>> ARTICLE

My personal view is that he actually looks like that all the time, Just we see him through the eyes of other heroes who think he is an idiot

It was a janitor to be precise, which makes this whole thing just even more hilarious!

I think the website sells it, or amazon.

The map seems to go by the name of "Papa's maze" since the person who found the map was the daughter of the artist.

no, he is a professional mazist now
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but I hear he's just a class B

And even then, he only got there by taking other people's credit.
>> ARTICLE
that ending scene with Lord Boros was amazing.  I am surprised no one commented how he tanked a casual "normal" punch from Saitama.  The "ok" scene came out brilliantly. 

>> ARTICLE
Not only did he tank the hit, but the armor that it actually broke only served to restrict his full power.

We may actually get to see someone survive a few punches, then again, it's obvious Saitama didn't actually put his full force in the first punch.

He never does.

Boros' backstory was pretty interesting. Separated by billions of miles of universe, him & Saitama pretty much were looking for the same thing in a worthy opponent. They both got bored with fighting, and thus- bored with their lives. But now they've finally found each other... fighting-soulmates? 
>> ARTICLE
Did Boros survive the punch? Or did Saitama defeat his armour in a single punch?
>> ARTICLE
The question is whether or not Saitama *intended* to defeat him in one punch.  Otherwise that was like breaking Hammerhead's armor.
>> ARTICLE
He did. Saitama has never held back against a non-human. EDIT: I meant he has never hit a non-human without the intent to kill. [Next episode spoilers](/s "I've read the manga. I know it was a normal punch. The question wasn't 'did Saitama use his full power', it was 'did Saitama intend to defeat Boros with that punch', and the answer is yes.")
>> ARTICLE
He can still obliterate foes while holding back.  Has he even done one serious punch yet in the series?  He's done consecutive normal punches for sure.

Tatsumaki is actually pretty cool. She just has to stick to one or two lines of dialogue per episode, so that she doesn't get unbearably smug. 

Also, didn't think Bang was powerful enough to face that monster. He looks kinda.. old.

He didn't kill Boros with One Punch? OMG. Maybe next episode I'm gonna get another fight scene that I watch repeatedly ( like I do with the Genos vs Saitama fight )

Can we get a discussion about just how amazing the opening and closing themes are? It's like the opening is made of hype. I don't understand Japanese so to me I'm kind of just going rararararRA HERO! The BGM is pretty good always seemingly perfectly setting the tone. Then that close is like: "Okay we know that episode was awesome but now it's time to calm the fuck down. Too much hype will give you a heart attack. "

I love it.

Geryunganshoop: I am the supreme telekinetic power in the universe!

*throws pebbles* 

Tatsumaki: .....

*throws around city busting bombardments*

Tatsumaki: Bitch please.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think it's a shame that we saw Tatsumaki's power earlier with the dino in the anime.  In the manga, you don't really see it until she attacks the ship, a bit after Geryunganshoop's claim, so it makes more impact.  And personally I'd've preferred it if Tatsumaki was the one going up against Geryunganshoop, but ah well.
>> ARTICLE
Eh I think it's important to show that Saitama isn't just limited to muscleheads that try to beat him in melee combat. Sure a psychic versus psychic fight would have been more interesting to animate for those few seconds, but they reinforce the scope of what Saitama can tank and defeat.
>> ARTICLE
a lot of hype about saitama vs boros, but honestly, the best part about OPM isn't even the titular character. don't get me wrong, saitama is great, but the interaction between the other heroes is just amazing, it was shown during the sea king battle, and once again here.

that group of brute strength heroes who don't know how to back off and fight differently (batman, bang, samurai, puri puri) eventually find the weakness they were looking for, and tatsumaki's sassy attitude as she nonchalantly destroys the ship's weapon system (and dem legs)

you have to use a external program to render it in 60fps its called SVP

Also looks like that subreddit needs some activity, I may start posting if I can get around to converting.

How did you it 60fps saveable? Using SVP you can stream 60fps but only when watching not saving the video as 60fps

It took me about 1:30h to convert this 8min clip and the file size is about double the original so about 2gb per episode!

They made Metal Bat look badass this episode. I'm satisfied. I hope they add more spice to the Melzargard(?) fight in the BDs though, I still prefer how the fight looked in the manga compared to what we got here.

**Edit:** If you're interested how it looked in the manga, it's in the [middle of Chapter 41](http://tonarinoyj.jp/manga/onepanman/41/). Read right to left, same as when you're going to next/previous page.

I'm so glad they're putting some anime-original stuff, like how the other heroes such as Mumen Rider, Stinger, and Inazuma Max were actually out there rescuing people.

Boros-sama tanked a hit from Saitama, impressive. Admittedly not a serious hit, and I've no doubt Saitama will smash him with WAN PANCH next episode, but still. 

And please, tentacle monster. You, the supreme telekinetic power in the universe? Tatsumaki would absolutely fuck your shit up.
>> ARTICLE
It's simply incredible how this anime manages to deliver a steady amount of hype every single episode. It only keeps building up. The only other anime this season with such steady quality is Haikyuu imo, in a different way of course. (fun fact: the Melgansomething monster apparently shares a VA with Tsukishima. I knew that voice from somewhere but just couldn't figure it out and it bugged me so much)

When that blonde dude screamed "ah let's retreat and think of another way to defeat him, like heat or something" all I could think was where the fuck was Genos doing, but it was nice that the other heroes could stand their ground. And then there's Tatsumaki being Tatsumaki.

The fight with the telekinetic blue monster made me wonder a bit, though. What if Saitama faces an enemy that could telekinetically just keep him away, or was intangible, therefore unable to be punched? Now I'm not speaking about someone that could defeat him, which seems to be hardly possible, but such a stalemate situation would be interesting to see...

>> ARTICLE
I honestly expected Saitama's reaction to be a bit different than just ["OK"](https://i.imgur.com/pfP3ogd.jpg).

I thought he would either be in disbelief that someone could withstand a punch, or be in pure excitement that he finally found someone strong enough for a proper fight. Another option was him be in fear, but that's is so unlikely.

Instead we got a joke. I like to think of it as him being in both excitement and disbelief though. He definitely didn't expect Boros to withstand that hit.

Loved this episode. I was honestly going to be pissed if we didn't at least get some action between them, but MadHouse delivers. Love this show so much.
>> ARTICLE
The "OK" was more a reaction to Boros bragging about his armour being used to seal his incredible power etc. At least that's how it comes off in the manga.

s it me or this episode animation quality is bad in comparaison of the last one?

I agree. The fight with Melzalgald is quite disappointing imo. There are a couple of shots that are good. Like the one where Metal bat is avoiding the attacks. But the rest are meh.

However I'm still fine with it because I'm confident they're saving their best for last.

We're so lucky to have this anime adapted by madhouse 
this anime wouldn't be this good adapted from any other
studio and that much passion put into it 
>> ARTICLE
Next episode is going to be so cool. I loved the neo-light alien in this.
>> ARTICLE
That punch on Boros!!sooo good man
>> ARTICLE
I like how it doesn't matter how fast speed o sound sonic is he always seems to be late to the action, at least that's what I think is going to happen.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to be very upset once One Punch Man is over. :(
>> ARTICLE
I love how Boros' look is completely out of place, he's so cartoony and colorful he seems to be ripped from a Disgaea game. 
>> ARTICLE
No screen time for Genos.
>> ARTICLE
I guess we have to change the name of the series now....
>> ARTICLE
man boros unleashed looks so epic
>> ARTICLE
I've been waiting to see everyone's reactions to when Boros survives one of Saitama's punches.

What I love about this fight is how Boros and Saitama both have the same dream of meeting a worthy opponent and that both do what they do for fun.
>> ARTICLE
I got friggin' chills at that ending.

Also, I bought some reduced sushi before watching this - seemed appropriate.

I can't wait till we get a second season so we get more of best girl blizzard of hell!

Wait is the next episode the ***last*** last episode of the anime? Or what?
>> ARTICLE
**dies of hype**
>> ARTICLE
Anyone have the gif where Saitama one bangs lord Boros?
>> ARTICLE
It was so awesome seeing all the heroes being awesome, especially Mumen Rider. Though I'm sure some aren't happy at Genos only getting a brief non action scene.
>> ARTICLE
"Now, it is time!" *snap* No its not D:
>> ARTICLE
So will we see something from King?
>> ARTICLE
no
>> ARTICLE
Just me or the hero with the bat looks like one of the characters from HunterXHunter? That hairstyle.
>> ARTICLE
It's the typical student delinquent look in anime with school uniform and pompadour hairstyle.  Other characters with similar looks and personalities are Knuckle from Hunter x Hunter (as you mentioned), Kuwabara from Yu Yu Hakusho and Takamura from Hajime no Ippo, and there are probably quite a few others as well.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit the S hero fight was awsome animated. Imagine the Boros fight. 

Hype. Is. Tingling.

Disco Boros !

All hail the denominator of the universe!

He's.......he's going [](/s "Meteoric Burst From the start?")

It's just his normal transformation after the armor is broken.

YEEEAH, I went into this being like, they better atleast show the first punch of the boros fight, im soo hyped for next weeks "serious" attack
>> ARTICLE
The next episode is going to be fucking awesome.
>> ARTICLE
"Oops, I broke it..."
>> ARTICLE
They nailed that "OK" part. Where's a gif of him in that state when you need it?!
>> ARTICLE
Not exactly a fan of the *BWAHH*s. Nailed everything else.

Hit the ball out of the park with Metal Bat. The animation was sometimes choppy but idc.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'll probably cry to the beauty of the punch I'm expecting next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Nice and clean
>> ARTICLE
Props to the maker of that armour for actually protecting its wearer from Saitama's punch.
>> ARTICLE
this show should honestly be one hundred episodes.  
>> ARTICLE
They nailed the "Okay" part XD
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully those added scenes of Dr.Genus being a Takoyaki Cook is a sign that they're practicing for season 2! 
>> ARTICLE
All the Amai Mask filler scenes and showing Garou in the anime indicates that they really want to do a second season :D
>> ARTICLE
Am I only one who though that saitama would be left super suprised and happy after seeing boros not going down with one punch like other enemies did?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe, but he wasn't really in a 'good' mood after Boros confesed having been wracking chaos and destruction through the universe only because he was bored (Which is a point to let us once again see that, despite suffering something similar, Saitama still would NEVER do something like crazy/evil as Boros did)

Does anyone know if the Dominator-Denominator joke holds in Japanese too, or is it a joke for the English translation only?

There's many variations to that joke. The joke is Saitama always make mistake on names like Jack o lantern panic. The other versions are "Ruler of the universe" to "Looter of the universe" and "subjugator of the universe" to "sub educator of the universe"

I gotta say nothing touched my heart quite like seeing Mumen Rider just doing his hero thing. Power be damned he is the real MVP in too many ways that count the most.

While Saitama-sensei protects the heavens, the Cyclist for Justice watches over us on the Earth =D

This looks fire in 60fps. Really, it's a disservice not to watch it in 60fps. Anyway, this is probably the best episode so far, and that's saying something.

**[One Punch-man is listed as a 12-episode show on MAL.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30276/One_Punch_Man)**
>> ARTICLE
Body is ready for serious series punch rekting Boros.
>> ARTICLE
Hyped, fuck where's the HD streams
>> ARTICLE
I think it's login on Daisuki
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure some of you missed it but...

Boros tells Geryuganshoop to gather the top lieutenants (Geryuganshoop, Groribas and Melzargard) to take care of Saitama.  This places the lieutenants at roughly the same overall power level with respect to each other.  We know Saitama already one punched Groribas, and he was able to take care of Geryuganshoop with a single pebble.  Meanwhile, the majority of the Class S heroes are all working together and having one hell of a time defeating just one lieutenant (Melzargard) which really tells you just how strong Saitama is compared to every other hero in the Association.  One lieutenant against the Class S heroes appears intimidating, while one lieutenant against Saitama just looks comical.
>> ARTICLE
Could Saitama one punch melzargard though? I feel like he would have punched and missed a marble and had to do another one.
>> ARTICLE
Or he would have pulverized the marbles with his one punch.
>> ARTICLE
The shockwave would bust all of them
>> ARTICLE
From what I've seen, and this is the same in the manga, each Marble controls a pair of eyes, which signify a "head". The main body is just a mass of clay to be molded into weapons. He normally has all of his eyes stacked up, and loses a pair per body he makes. 

Assuming he doesn't move the marbles, that means all of them are in the head when a fight starts. At that moment, Saitama or anyone, hell even a nuke right in the head would pop all of them.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope that they play the OP for next episode's fight. 

Next episode will be amazing.
>> ARTICLE
all aboard the hype train
>> ARTICLE
Sitting here imagining how screwed the other heroes would be without Saitama ... 
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't even need to use his punch to defeat that blue thing. What the fuck.
>> ARTICLE
i will say it again, it is not hype, this is the best thing that has happened to anime in a lot of time.
>> ARTICLE
ok.
>> ARTICLE
lol it was fun when he asked them about their boss xD

and that door part "ops" lmao
>> ARTICLE
AOTY in my opinion. Can't see this series do anything but get more popular once the Blu-Rays come out. This WILL get a season two, or I'll eat a pair of shiny red gloves.

Especially the way the web comic is written. You think you're hype now? The hype train has barely made it out of the station.
>> ARTICLE
I woke up at 6 AM to watch this episode.

The side battles weren't much fun aside from Saitama versus the octopus.

Saitama must be glad to find someone who can withstand his punch. Next episode is going to be awesome. I hope the make it as well they did the first episode in Saitama vs Subterraneans.
>> ARTICLE
That was the only way they could have done the "Okay" scene and it came out perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
i dont even know what to watch after this is over :(
>> ARTICLE
Go right.


Shrewed face... Guess I'll go left, hehe.


Me on every instruction given to me ever.
>> ARTICLE
Boros' voice actor is Morikawa Toshiyuki!
>> ARTICLE
Wow can't wait for [Spoiler](/s "Saitama getting kicked all the way to the moon") and [Spoiler](/s "SERIOUS PUNCH")
>> ARTICLE
'What does it mean to be the 'Strongest'...Saitama?'

Who else felt the endless chills of hype intensifying at those preview-words :D?
>> ARTICLE
Seriously. That Saitama face at the end. Looks like he's seen some shit and is like... 'ah crap'.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, that's just his 'OK...good story, I don't really care bro'-face :P
>> ARTICLE
New to this. Why is there only 12 episodes? Why can't there be like 100 episodes like all other animes? Please I don't want this to end.
>> ARTICLE
The manga the anime is based on is really small. For example, the 12 episode anime has covered over 60% of the source material. So even if they wanted to make 100 episodes, they couldn't due to the lack of source material.
>> ARTICLE
Its a combination of source material and budget. Usually shows will have a set budget, and they have to use that budget in whatever way they want as long as they deliver. This is why some episodes have less than great animation while others have spectacular animation, they move it to areas they deem more important as they wish. With that in mind, its better to have 12 episodes of awesome animation than 24 or more episodes of okay or average animation, especially since this show needs the action scenes to work for the story and comedy to come into full force. In addition to that, too many episodes will make it harder to cover everything without filler or pacing issues. This is why many shows with higher episode counts have "recap episodes" where they save on a lot of money and time by recycling previous episode animation. Finally, the anime is basing many scenes off of both the manga and webcomic, so they need to wait for ONE (the webcomic) to make more, and for Murata (the manga) to adapt more, as going off of these would make them non canon very fast as more volumes come out. This is why they likely did this, as the great reception of this show currently is allowing them to wait for material for season 2.

So in short, by making it 12 episodes, we get no filler, great animation, and faithfulness to the source material without having to make the animators go overbudget. The reason this is important is that many projects do not get continuations of sequels if they go overbudget, as it makes it harder to recooperate costs that way. So doing it this way also helps increase the chances of a second season or more OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
Wow thanks for the explanation!
>> ARTICLE
Isn't this the end of One punch man? Boros took one punch ... it will just continue in the same way with opponents with more and more armour, taking more and more punches ... ?
>> ARTICLE
No it actually gets better
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Boros is the most powerful enemy so far in the manga")
>> ARTICLE
Not in the webcomic though.
>> ARTICLE
[DEBATABLE](/s "Boros would probably rekt Garou tho. He did say one of his attacks (WOULD NOT EVEN LEAVE A BONE BEHIND) in the manga, so there's nothing for Garou to evolve with.")
>> ARTICLE
Yea, it is. 
>> ARTICLE
[Webcomic Spoiler](/s "ONE: Garou vs Boros, who would win, you ask? Before (pre-monster Garou), it was quite obvious Boros was ways above him. But now that Garou has basically become the perfect monster, it is hard to tell who would win, it would've been one hell of a battle. I do believe that Garou is stronger in close combat, where he would simply dodge all punches and kicks.")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "That only tells me that ONE thinks Garou is stronger in CQC, which Boros is most definitely not limited to. He has fucking off the charts energy projection in comparison to anything seen thus far. He also has fantastic durability and regeneration. Also keep in mind that the webcomic Boros is nowhere near as powerful as the manga/anime Boros. The manga adds lots of feats which give Boros a huge advantage. His strength is fucking massive, he wouldn't need to punch Garou to demolish him at all. Until Murata gives Garou some psycho feats, Manga Boros is way stronger than Webcomic Garou. And it wouldn't matter once the planet buster cannon was brought out anyways.")
>> ARTICLE
[Webcomic Spoiler](/s "Remember that everything that happens in the manga is done on ONE's say so, you can't just say that the manga stuff overrides webcomic stuff, especially with the webcomic being OG canon. Garou also takes more hits from Saitama than Boros, like WAAAY more hits. Also, Boros literally only does CQC the entire time he's fighting Saitama and it's only at the end that he uses that last desperation move which is probably why ONE can't tell who would win. Saitama's fighting style is always very lax and reactive to what his enemy does but Garou actually initiates his fights and has huge intents to kill, he would try to finish Boros off as fast as possible so who knows if Boros would even have the chance to bring out his cannon, either way it'd be a super close fight and there's no real way to know who would win so it's better to take it at ONE's word that they'd probably be equal.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh, so that's where that panel everyone links comes from.  
Anyway, I'm hyped for the final fight, looks like it's going to be more epic than anything else in the series thus far.
>> ARTICLE
The cliffhanger. [This is going to be a long ass week.](http://i.imgur.com/v7dCxeg.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Damn it I really wanted to watch the fight. But we gotta wait a week even though we know what happens.

Also I am surprised they showed the maze in black and white instead of reanimate it.
>> ARTICLE
The preview reminded me there was only one episode left u_u
>> ARTICLE
Probably my most favorite aspect of this entire series, manga or anime, is the [over-the-top complex design of the villains in comparison to the hero.](http://i19.servimg.com/u/f19/12/74/50/36/lordbo10.jpg)  The immense contrast adds to the comedy and even action sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
>  over-the-top complex design of the villains in comparison to the hero. The immense contrast adds to the comedy and even action sometimes.

And Genos.  Genos is like the ultimate foil for Saitama.
>> ARTICLE
Genos is exactly like the hero people expect Saitama to be.  Awesome design, dramatic back story, cool powers/gadgets.  But instead we get a bald egg head in a yellow jumpsuit.  I'm not even mad, though.
>> ARTICLE
I know it's kinda late to ask this but..... if Saitama's power is kinda being ultra strong. Wouldn't poison kill him ?



Last episode next week guys !

See you at Season 2 /ovas o7

I'm thinking his body is just really resistant to shit. I mean gravity increased to deadly levels on him this episode and he didn't even flinch.

> he spaceship is made up of parts, so I guess it'll break down part by part. And since it's at zero velocity, Saitama will have to go on it to destroy it unlike the meteor that was hurling towards Earth.

This could explain why he could do that training from day 1 to day 1095 without rest

Like Saitama said to Genos when Genos destroyed the house of evolution in one attack "That was kind of mean"

A meteor is a single entity. Saitama broke it into pieces.

The spaceship is made up of parts, so I guess it'll break down part by part. And since it's at zero velocity, Saitama will have to go on it to destroy it unlike the meteor that was hurling towards Earth.

OR Saitama might just want to know who is the owner of the spaceship so that he can fight him.

Well...[SPOILER](/s "Yes, you're kinda right, he wanted to make Boros pay face-to-face for destroying A-City. And the guy above is also right, he COULD have destroyed the ship with one punch if he wanted...just wait next episode and see, you will understand a bit more just how 'absolute' Saitama truly is by the end of the fight XP")

Annnnnddd I wanna fuck Lord Boros.

an average hero

I love Saitama running though the ship and thinking its like a video game

"I should have ran into the boss by now..."
>> ARTICLE
Saitama LOVES video games! If you haven't read the manga you'll see why soon enough ;) 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's because fights in video games are actually a challenge for him.
>> ARTICLE
Or maybe he's dead already. 


That line made me laugh, since he one punches everyone, there really is no way for him to differentiate henchmen from bosses.
>> ARTICLE
Thatd be pretty funny if they had done that. Hes just like "wheres the boss?" Then the next scene is a dead body. 
>> ARTICLE
He is rather genre savy, he's done his hero homework.

>> ARTICLE
I am going to be so upset when this ends
>> ARTICLE
The post-anime-depression that will hit after this show ends will probably be similar to the receiving end of a Saitama punch.

Death take me swiftly, for I do not want to live in a world without OPM airing.

great job with these!
>> ARTICLE
I prefer the transitions you already use; 01/02 don't seem to flow together as well. Keep up the great work!
>> ARTICLE
These are awesome!
>> ARTICLE
No. 1 was done so much better in the manga, I didn't really get the contrast of atmosphere in the anime. That was a bit disappointing.
>> ARTICLE
Yay you are here!! Thanks for the gifs
>> ARTICLE
So, can someone explain the webcomic version to me? Was this like the rough sketches before it became a serious Manga style or? 
>> ARTICLE
It's the original version of OPM by ONE, which was later redrawn with better artwork by Yusuke Murata.
>> ARTICLE
Was the guy having fun with the artwork or it was "serious"?

>> ARTICLE
Can't it be both? I find it incredibly charming.
>> ARTICLE
ONE is a manga artist in Japan.  His main work is called Mob Psycho 100 and it's published in an actual magazine in Japan.  He started drawing One Punch Man as a webcomic in his spare time, publishing it online for people to read for free.  Basically through a whole bunch of events Yusuke Murata(the current artist for OPM) approached ONE and asked if he could redraw the webcomic.  ONE agreed, and it ended up making it into the Young Jump magazine in Japan(a Seinen magazine) and now we're here.  ONE works with Murata on each new chapter of OPM for the manga and makes additions that weren't in the webcomic.  Basically, drawing OPM is just his hobby, not his actual job.  So no, he doesn't take drawing OPM seriously most of the time.  

TL;DR: OPM is his hobby.
>> ARTICLE
I dont think I really like that transition style, I'd rather look at the whole picture you know?

Still though, fantastic work! I look forward to these every week!
>> ARTICLE
I like how they keep having Tatsumaki go between the manga-like drawing of her and the original web-comic drawings throughout the anime.
>> ARTICLE
It happens in the manga too. I think Saitama's the only other one Murata does that for, so it might be his way of expressing power so great it can't be comprehended by many. That's my theory, at least. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the transition style you've been using is great cuz it changes in a way I can compare between the anime and the manga more easily... but that;s just my opinion. As usual, thanks for your effort :)
>> ARTICLE
Could you please do the part where Saitama kicks back the projectile / massive bullet thing (chapter 32 in manga, 34 in webcomic, if that helps)? 

The scene where Melzalgald smashes Iaian's helmet (32 manga, 34 webcomic), or his arm and everything behind it (32 manga, 35 webcomic) could be good too.

For the sidenote transitions, can you do a slight zoom-out when you reach the top of the manga so you get the more of the image at once? Dunno if that might work better.
>> ARTICLE
Added as #9 and #10 respectively :)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, looks great as always!

>> ARTICLE
Thanks for doing this every week. It's become something I really look forwards to seeing after the episode. It's cool to have this comparison to the source material.
>> ARTICLE
It's great, but it always gets me thinking, If I was doing crappy drawings and having some super talent come along and make it awesome, I would be so tempted to draw crazy bad characters or super low detail but with lots of stuff going on, just to see how the talent would interpret it like.

I wounder if One's ever drawn a character and thought "I wounder how this will look when Murata's done with it"
>> ARTICLE
Awesome work! Thanks!

> Sidenote, what do you think about this transition style: 01 / 02? Not sure if I like it or not.

I find it harder to get a whole view of the manga version because it spends less time zoomed out on the whole thing. Prefer it the way it is now. But it's not *that* big of a difference.
>> ARTICLE
The spaceship has the biggest difference in the 3 versions xD
>> ARTICLE
Dat ONE detail haha!
>> ARTICLE
The manga spaceship has such an unreal amount of detail. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it's no wonder the manga takes forever to produce. Each panel is masterfully crafted.
>> ARTICLE
It's a small detail, but I like how this series allows side characters - even ones with barely any screen time - to have their own stories and arcs. Licenseless Rider is probably the most obvious example, but Puri Puri Prisoner, despite being ridiculous even by OPM's standards, manages to have some depth. Him receiving a beatdown and a lecture on fighting with determination from the Deep Sea King, followed by his self-doubt at seeing the tabloids slander him, and then changing his fighting style in the next fight gives him a mini-character arc that makes him vastly more interesting and likeable than he would otherwise be. It's so minor in the grand scheme of things, but it works surprisingly well. 
>> ARTICLE
One of the strengths of the series is the fact that this show doesn't revolve around Saitama, but everything else that is around Saitama. Supporting characters, world-building, politics, etc. It kinda makes me sad when some people take those things for granted and doesn't give a shit until Saitama or Genos is on-screen.
>> ARTICLE

[Saitama staning on the roof in the manga already looked cool.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mO0rXoxO4Mg/Vjlnc1gYW9I/AAAAAAABmgs/9c0fsTITKt0/s16000-Ic42/004.jpg) But not cool enough for our anime staff. First they nailed the above, then they added **[BWAAAAH!](http://www.myinstants.com/instant/inception-button/)** and the scene was perfect.


Also, the anime original Tatsumaki content was nice. She has way too little screen time in the anime anyway.
>> ARTICLE
So noone takes notice that this noname hero who showed up at the meeting just punched a whole through the ceiling of their base that just survived a alien bombardment.
>> ARTICLE
To add on to the other points already made, things made to withstand high forces from outside tend to not be as strong for forces from the inside, think of an egg for example.
>> ARTICLE
Alien invasions and BWAAH! SFX go hand in hand.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I remember when it was horn fanfares and violin tremolos and PEW PEW PEW
>> ARTICLE
I didn't know this until just recently. 

But TIL Tatsumaki is actually 28. Shes just extremely short.

Not relevant to the episode at all but i didn't actually know this and never guessed

edit: [This is going to be the next big meta joke eh] (http://i.imgur.com/Aqd3BHR.png)
>> ARTICLE
Have you ever seen any Japanese Idols? some of them look like they're 18 when they're 25-28. It's just the way they age; plus there are plenty of short and young looking 28 year old females around the world, it's not like it's a far-fetched idea.

One thing I like about the series is that they're putting more emphasis on the other heroes, aside from Genos and Saitama.

They take a great deal of care to show that these costumed idiots take their jobs *very* seriously. They can be gimmicky, and not always effective, but they're (often) righteous, selfless, and *utterly fearless*. And when civilians are in danger, they'll throw themselves head-long into the fray, even when they know full well they have minimal chance of surviving, much less winning.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, and later arcs help show actually how great all of the S-class heroes are, even through all their quirks and weirdness. From the ones they have shown, they add small stuff but it adds a ton to their character.
>> ARTICLE
Two words: Metal Bat.

Holy. *Shit*. Metal Bat.

I laughed so fucking hard when Superalloy Blackluster started talking because he sounds so much like Momonga / Ainz. They had Clementine's VA playing as Tatsumaki as well, and I'm glad she got the role because she's fucking talented (and pulls off Tatsumaki really well).

Also, [Saitama knows.](http://i.imgur.com/VO7t37W.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Saitama actually was looking in that direction when he was drawn in Murata manga as well, maybe for Ones but I can't quite remember. My theory is that rather than looking at the reader/watcher he was looking for which part of the building was the easiest to get out of and this is him settling on just jumping through the roof.
>> ARTICLE
I think he just noticed the incoming space ship.  Which is why he commented that it could happen today.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama's comment could just be practical/philosophical, like some of his past comments: 

> I'll leave tomorrow's problems to tomorrow me...

In past episodes, Genos was the guy that sensed incoming enemies. Saitama spacing off into the corner might be Saitama soaking things in, like a kid at a theme park. There was a past episode where Genos was hanging out with Saitama, and Saitama's just looking off into a high corner of his room, oblivious to Geno's understanding of the whatever politics had gone on in the episode (I don't remember which episode it was).
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit that's really genius, really subtle way of showing how far leagues above everyone else he is.
>> ARTICLE
Tatsumaki's voice is squeaky cute.
>> ARTICLE
Tatsumakis VA fucking nails that role, loving her so much more than in the Manga, well both the anime and the webcomic made realise how great she really is.
>> ARTICLE
They simply nailed King. His voice. His engine. Perfect. I look forward to see more of him in the possible season 2 in a few years.

And yes it's possible, the "Madhouse so no second season" argument doesn't work in this series as Madhouse is not the decisive body here.

After all they got hired by the company named Shueisha that is known for hiring studios to adapt Shounen jump manga ( which One Punch Man is ). So let's pray to them that they'll still see the great potential in this series, hire Natsume Shingo and Madhouse again, and give us another masterpiece like this.

Anyway I'm pumped to see this orgasm of a fight in the next 2 episodes!

This is true. Though Saitama is depicted this way considerably more often.

It's great because when they wanna cut corners and save a little cash on animation they can make jokes referencing ONE's original artwork

It's also notable that she and Saitama are the only heroes who go ONE-style chibi somewhat often. If a villain ever does it, I'll be worried.

I wasn't mention thing I really loved in this bit.

One of my favorite things about Saitama is how his strength is played up in more subtle ways then kick giant bullets back into a spaceship.

A spaceship level an entire city in a second. Only one building survived, because it was specially designed to be sturdier and more reliable than any kind of disaster shelter. 

The heroes start to leave to see what could have caused this kind of destruction. And where is Saitama? He's already *jumped through* the building that survived the attack that destroyed the entire city and is on the roof. 

And of course, only Genos notices.

Well, approximately all the shit is going down now. It's good to see the rest of the S class heroes, I always like it when a story actually goes into detail on the different aspects of the world.

Just a heads up, but vol.10 got released in japan and with it came an OVA of Saitama first getting his costume. Pretty good, not too spectacular, but enjoyable. You're going to have to sail the high seas to watch it though. 

Also, a few extra chapters came along with it. [One of them got translated on /r/manga.](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/3vnbbj/one_punch_man_tatsumakis_day_off_potato_quality/).

In fact, you should go read all the volumes after the anime is finished; they all come with some pretty awesome side stories that open up the world and are just [*funny*](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sNINdXUeO9k/VjARYkdWt6I/AAAAAAAAkqU/0pMDhl7004U/s16000/0031-030.jpg). If nothing else, you should atleast read ch 20.6 and 37.7, but of them are imperative for OPM fans. If you can't obtain the volumes legally, manga life has the first 5 up.

Anyway, PSA regarding this arc: 
[Spoiler as Requested](/s "THIS IS NOT AS EMOTIONAL AS THE SEAKING ARK.
If you're looking for impassioned speeches or tearjerking moments, you'll be disappointed. This arc isn't bad, most people think it's more epic than the previous one. Just, epic in the biblical sense.

Oddly Tatsumaki character design was one of the things that stand out the most to me in One Punch Man, It's very simple but everything just meshes together so well, it's also always surprising to see a "seductive" design that doesn't look stupid in anime.

Thanks Boros for raining down justice/death on the scumbags without dirtying the heroes' hands!!!
>> ARTICLE
the joke of the show is that Saitama IS the ultimate existence, and not only was he not created that way, he acquired it through almost no effort.


>> ARTICLE
No effort?? He actually become strong because of effort alone. Give me an average guy who can do 100 reps of pushups, situps, squats and 10km run right of the bat without conditioning or starting at lower reps. Let's say this average guy managed to do it, can he do it again the next day with all his muscles aching?

Actually Saitama even said his bones were breaking but he still continued it and that effort and willpower made him break his limiter so he got infinite strength.

> ok, I like OPM, but common "effort and willpower" , this is cliche as hell, you see that in every single shounen battle, dont try to make Saitma is better or unique than other characters.


You are ABSOLUTELY wrong.
Nearly every shonen battle manga SHIT on hard work and willpower. The protagonist is nearly always a unique snowflake who has an advantage no on else has, and obtain powers everyone else needed decades to earn, within months if not weeks. And the protagonist is usually the son or daughter of someone really powerful, or some freak of nature. Basically, Shonen Manga tells us that hard work doesn't work, that the only way to be number 1 is to be BORN into privilege, or to cheat in some way.

Dragon Ball? Protagonist is an Alien. YYH? Protagonist's dad was one of the three kings of the underworld. Bleach? Protagonist has supernatural father. Naruto? Protagonist has a powerful father AND magical pet. One Piece? Magic fruit. Even HxH is about a son following his father.

Hard work? What's that?

OPM is special because it is ABOUT hard work.

>> ARTICLE
Meh, I dont agree, is too easy for author to do what he did. Saitama make some exercises and now can jump to the moon ? How this is better than Goku being Alien and Goku never had to work to be strong ? GTFO. And dont try to say what Saitama did is impossible, there is thousand of athletes in the world with a much harder routine of exercises. But I dont blame the author, I only find ridiculous how people try to debunk other MCs.

[TFW you save an entire city, and someone complains about stupid shit.](http://i.imgur.com/9yrvSU9.png)
>> ARTICLE
Just to piggyback on this and point out that no matter what you do to help people, as long as some form of damage occurs, even if you did all you could they will always (myself included) be unsatisfied and try to push the blame/anger somewhere and the easiest is usually the person who just busted their ass off to save us in the first place.

This is one part of our human nature we have to work very hard to fight against. Instead of telling him thanks for saving his life this guy complained about a car as if his car > his life. Maybe I'm being too deep but I think the writer did this on purpose, either that or I'm an idiot but oh well that's my 2 cents.
>> ARTICLE
I think the people complained because they thought the other S class heros could have saved the city without the damage. So the people probably thought Saitama came in and messed things up.

If only the people knew that the S class heros were powerless, then they wouldn't have blamed Saitama for the inevitable damage.
>> ARTICLE
>no matter what you do ~~to help people, as long as some form of damage occurs, even if you did all you could~~ they will always (myself included) be unsatisfied

I really like Saitama's character. I was honestly expecting that to lead into a tirade about how could they have not put him in S class, but instead it was "Oh man, that's great!" And he's so modest that he feels destroying a continent-crushing meteor was just a "small thing" for such a huge jump in ranking. Rally says something about the type of person he is, that and his reaction to the crowd.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair he's so ridiculously strong that punching the meteor into oblivion was a completely effortless task. Can't blame him for getting surprised about the jump in ranking when from his perspective it took less effort than he put into putting on the costume.  
[](#nico-heart)
>> ARTICLE
I know that a lot of it has to do with his immense strength, but the thing is he's gotten so strong that he doesn't even seem to remember that what he's doing is on par with acts of God. Not even the S-Rank 7 could scratch that meteor, and he simply punched right through it.

The manga is amazing.  Although the anime does it justice very well, you're missing out on so much by not reading it
>> ARTICLE
I like that dude.  I hope we see more of him.
>> ARTICLE
You're gonna get plenty more Bang. :D
>> ARTICLE
You see a decent amount of almost all the S class rank heroes.
>> ARTICLE
Are most of the S-Class a bunch of pompous assholes? Because other than Bang, that seems to be the running theme here. We had snooty lady from episode 6, along with gravity girl, and now Metal Knight just can't be assed to actually save anyone without having something in it for him. My guess is a lot of the S-Class aren't going to appreciate Saitama the young upstart coming in and doing whatever he can to help just because he feels like it.
>> ARTICLE
>  snooty lady from episode 6, along with gravity girl

Who? If you're talking about the floating green haired girl, she is quite arrogant, though considering her strength thats pretty understandable. 

Idk who you mean by snooty lady in ep. 6, and there's only one girl in S-rank (tatsumaki)
>> ARTICLE
I think he was talking about Fubuki. Probably an anime only guy and doesn't know she's a B class.
>> ARTICLE
Lets see:
[S Rank Heroes](/s "
S1 Blast (thus far unseen)
S2 Tornado (Utterly disdain of anyone below her in rank and power, but she does have what it takes to back it up).
S3 Bang, as you saw, a cool old kung fu master.
S4 Atomic Samurai, also a fairly cool guy.
S5 Child Emperor, a wee bit on the immature side, and somewhat gullable.
S6 Metal Knight, an asshole.
S7 King, actually a pretty cool guy.  Saitama plays video games with him.
S8 Zombieman.  Not a guy you want to hangout with, but really not his fault.
S9 Drive Knight.  Nothing out of him outside a single line of dialogue.
S10 Pig God.  Other than his appearance, a fairly friendly guy.
S11 Superalloy Blackluster.  A more realistic Saitama.  Also bald, but still human and not god.
S12 Watchdog Man.  A very powerful guy who doesn't have much interaction with any of the other heroes.
S13 Flashy Flash.  Hero Association's version of Sonic, and just as much of a dick.
S14 Tank-Top Master.  Of all of the Tank Top guys, the most friendly one.  Too bad lately he's just the butt of a bunch of jokes.
S15 Genos
S16 Metal Bat.  Your arch-type Japanese delinquent as a super hero, but he does have the prowess to back his persona.  A very good hero.
S17 Puri-Puri-Prisoner.  Lets just hope you don't catch his fancy.

you are more or less right, pretty much all the S class heroes are a bit too self centered, however most of them do want to help people.

the webcomic drawing is really ugly.... but the story is so godlike....
>> ARTICLE
ONE has been getting progressively better and better though. Garou Arc (very late into the series) looked pretty damn awesome and the fight scenes were very clear. I'm pretty sure ONE has taken some inspiration from Murata's style of portraying movements. He's getting better at paneling scenes as well.
>> ARTICLE
I love how those two work together and apparently learn a lot from each other. As much as Madhouse put heart and soul in this anime, those two put it in their story and art aswell.

Can we appreciate how in #1 the japanese letters appear as if they're falling with the meteors?

I can not explain why I love the original webcomic art so much, but by god do I get a good laugh every time it shows up at the end of one of these.

This might be the first series I've ever seen where the manga is better animated than the anime
>> ARTICLE
Imagine waiting all week for the next chapter to see what happens, and you find out its 10 pages of just rock flying through space. Makes an epic gif though!
>> ARTICLE
I agree, but it's important to note that each animation in the manga took the whole chapter. And chapters came once every two weeks.
>> ARTICLE
And sometimes it's not even a new chapter but a redrawn one! That's why if you go to other manga sites, you see at least 3 different versions of the same chapter. Man, Murata can't be satisfied with his own art!

you're kidding right? the fight scenes in kill la kill were incredibly well done and animated.
>> ARTICLE
Do you not have eyes? That show had terrible animation the vast majority of the time. This isn't even something worth a debate, you are simply incorrect. The show had a super low budget, and you can argue that they hid it well (I would disagree but w/e), but you can't argue that the animation is good, because it is flat out bad (most of the time)

i am arguing that right now, the show was very well done in animation.

I dunno man, I wish my standards were as low as yours. Would def enjoy more things that way

I'm pretty sure KlK was a low budget production.  So what they managed to do with that budget was very impressive.

[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
On the contrary, I think managing to make the show as compelling and exciting as it was with such a limited budged *does* make it good.  A show can have a good fight without spending a bunch of money on the animation.  The fights all had a certain *suspense* to them that made them very entertaining and exciting to watch.

Gundam: Iron-blooded Orphans is very damned hype. It's a Sunday show too, so it's a good contrast to OPM.

Noragami Aragoto is shaping up quite nicely, too.

Gunam, OPM and Utawara are the shit

The only shows I'm hyped every time I watch an episode are One Punch Man, Owarimonogatari, and Utawarerumono. Gundam is a close runner up.

Don't get me wrong, I love every show currently on my Watching list, but only those shows get me bouncing-in-my-seat excited to watch an epsiode.

Not counting Gintama or long airing shows. Spring Season 2016 will be good.

I really love how the anime translates meanings so much better. In the manga, I sorta understood what Saitama meant when he was reacting to the citizens after the meteor, but in the anime his reaction and his attitude was very very clear.
>> ARTICLE
I felt the exact same. In the manga I know what Saitama was trying to get at but it seemed like he was being a dick about it. In a "I don't really care about the people, I'm just being a hero cuz" way.

Here it's easier to understand. He is being a hero and he does care about people, he just isn't doing it for the fame (Although he does complain about it sometimes) and he certainly isn't putting up with people's petty problems in front of world ending threats.

Dude got his priorities straights.

Priority #1: Catch those grocery sales.
Priority #2: Be a hero.
>> ARTICLE
I think the wording is a bit strange, I doubt he doesn't care about the citizens like metal knight does.  What he actually means is that he doesn't care about anyone telling him how to do his job because he wants to be a hero.  If someone has a problem with having their ass saved they can say it to his face and we'll see what happens.

To be fair (To the idea of fighting him, the rest they're both fuckers) they, like most people, thought he had in truth done almost nothing and that Genos and Metal Knight were the ones that really did most of destroying the meteor, and that he only was there as an excuse to get his rank up O-O (So, yeah, idiots -x-)

So we're halfway through and the animation quality has far from dropped. The action animation director for this episode was **Norifumi Kugai** and the animators are as follows:

**Norifumi Kugai** is back, this time as both an animation director and as an animator. You'll remember that he worked on the [incredible Underdweller fight scene in episode 1](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/d4d2f2864b9c56845f426c550188081f.mp4) and worked on Space Dandy before this. It's been presumed that he worked on the scene where Saitama destroys the meteor and the cut of shrapnel destroying the city.

**Handa Shuhei** is a new face in One Punch Man. I'd say it's a surprise, but we're a bit beyond surprises at this point. Handa does a lot of work with Studio Trigger, with some of his best work being on [Little Witch Academia](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/13dcab3f19856012356dece07bd9d79a.webm) and [Little Witch Academia 2](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/da5ef4d78c994435f9b80f233dbc907b.webm) (link is a bit spoilery). As you can see, Handa is a pretty varied guy with a particular talent with effects animation, which he is attributed to on this episode.

**Keiichiro Watanabe** is back, after we saw his work on Episode 2. Watanabe is one of those people that doesn't have many places within credits, but seems to do [incredible work](http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/f63344bb143048eda24d5ca52809794b.mp4) everytime. He's one of the people that we can most definitely thank Director Shingo Natsume for bringing onto the project, as a Space Dandy animator.

And that's our star cast for this week. Norifumi Kugai was definitely this episode's MVP, but Shuhei's debut was very very welcome. Unfortunately, there was a bit of outsourcing with this episode, so some of the more minor movements may look a bit off.

I really want to know what they will name the absolutely _amazing_ OST piece that plays during Saitama's greatest moments, such as the dream fight agaist the subterrans, against Hammerhead and in this episode when destroying the meteor. Know this, this will appear in "Most Epic Anime OST" lists _a lot._ I like how they even played a simpler, calmer version of it by the end.

Another thing that's I have been curious about it why is the ending theme a _love_ song? I mean, OPM is like, super devoid of romance. Admiration and all that yes, but actual romance seems a bit weird for OPM.
>> ARTICLE
Well, for me, isn't OPM a parody of all shounen hero manga/anime? And most shounen hero anime have love songs as their ED, especially the really old ones. Also, the ED is kinda generic which reminds me of the mellow EDs of old anime. Maybe it's to reflect that?

This sounds like it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx-kzs3KPfg

But I don't think it is that one exactly.

That one is just a re-creation based on what the creator heard in the series. The actual OST sounds even more amazing, and will take some to be released. ;_;

Hmnnn... maybe the song is supposed to be from the perspective of people who actually cares about him? [a.k.a. Genos,](/s "Bang, Licenceless Rider, King, and potentially Fubuki")?

Or at least, that's what I think of whenever it gets to the *"watashi ni dake wa yowasa misete"* line. I mean, they do know that he's strong and this fact alone can scare anyone off, but Saitama is so chill to people who aren't hostile to him that he's pretty much open (to possible attacks, which would be considered a weakness).
>> ARTICLE
He was alone before he trained for his power. Like that lobster monster said, he had the same lifeless eyes. I think Saitama just threw away most of his emotions and is doing this hero gig as his life goes. What he isn't noticing is that he's making friends, but he keeps them distant.

They clearly know about the relationship between Saitama and best girl Speed 'o' Sound Sonic
>> ARTICLE
So i fucking love OPM so far but i was wondering if the manga readers could spoil something for me. Is there actually anyone in the manga that can come close to challenging saitama or is he just busted beyond belief>
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Well there will soon be someone he punches more than once he even does a serious series punch, but an actual challenge? Not really.")

>> ARTICLE
He is op man.
>> ARTICLE
he essentially has toon force. he is as physically and willfully powerful as he needs to be to easily defeat any enemy or perform any task, without rhyme or reason. sometimes he'll dick around and let enemies wail on him, but he is never in any actual danger and, should he play seriously, he'll end it in one punch as his name implies.

short answer: no. bigger, badder things than meteors have tried (and failed abysmally).
>> ARTICLE
[Webcomic Spoiler](/s "No, no one so far was an actual threat or challenge for Saitama. Although in the webcomic of ONE we recently ended the longest fight of Saitama to date. If I had to predict how long this fight would be in Manga chapters/Anime episode minutes, I would say at least 3 chapters and easily 10-15 minutes full of awesome fight. Thats the closest an enemy besides the one that will appear in the anime came to be a threat for Saitama ")

>> ARTICLE
[Manga Spoiler](/s "Boros could have killed Saitama if that kick had missed the Moon and sent him flying among the stars. Even if he somehow survived he would still have no way of getting back while flying through vacuum")

He'd just punch the void of space to propel himself back. Gravity ain't got shit on Saitama.

>> ARTICLE
hmm i see

>no. bigger, badder things than meteors have tried

i assume he faces a bunch of god level threats in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
He's going to face a Frieza in the last few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
no god level threat has ever officially been declared, in either webcomic or manga. but some things have come damn close and yeah, the only one who can deal with them is Saitama.
>> ARTICLE
If god-level threat is actually just 'threat to humanity', there's at least one, and possibly two that qualify.
>> ARTICLE
Luckily, [](/s "King is too busy playing visual novels to bother conquering the world").
>> ARTICLE
Can you give an example of one? Sorry if im being annoying xd
>> ARTICLE
Well there is one who he considered worthy [] (/s "AND THAT IS OUR LORD BOROS") he only said he was worthy but didn't forced saitama to use full strength
>> ARTICLE
In fact, if what ONE (The author himself) said about his full strength is true, Boros didn't even force him to use a 0,0000000000001% of his true power :P

ONE probably never actually said that. No one can find a source for it, it's just been passed around from forum to forum for months without any backing.

[This Spoiler WILL ruin the last three episodes of the anime.](/s "The self proclaimed strongest alien warlord of the universe (Lord Boros) comes to earth because he is tired of never having anyone of equal power to fight, and a prophet told him that a worthy opponent lives on earth.  
Saitama throws two half assed punches for shits and giggles and then annihalates the alien with one serious punch. The alien had a planet-busting laser attack.")
>> ARTICLE
[further](/s "the punch never even connects and the mere shockwave is the one that destroys him")
>> ARTICLE
Saitama's biggest enemies are the ones that he can't defeat with violence, like his lack of direction in life or the lack of respect the other heroes give him. Which is what makes him somewhat relatable as a protagonist--his problems and worries are the same ones that we face.

Actually, yes.

/u/Wafflezlolqt asked a question directed to manga readers if anyone even comes close to Saitama and /u/Pred007 replies with wrong information which to who isn't familiar with the manga to believe that it is in fact true. If /u/Wafflezlolqt put a "sarcasm tag" on his comment I would be in the wrong and /u/Pred007 would be correct unfortunately I think /u/Wafflezlolqt was asking a serious question. And seeing how wrong information was provided I attempted to clear it up.

Notice how the initial question only got 8 points while the troll answer got 105. Seems like the troll answer was for you guys and not exactly the person needing the answer the most. So in words of Saitama. [You can shut up!](https://i.imgur.com/9yrvSU9.png)

That might be true, but I based my thinking on the fact that this is an ANIME thread and not Manga and generally anime watchers don't want to be spoiled unless they specifically ask. And that is what I answered. So no I did not think of it a single way, I just based it on the setting of the question.

I get the feeling the Hero Association isn't what it's cut out to be. Last minute evacuations. Political squandering between heroes for rankings. Not only thatMetal Knight and Sweet Mask are giving me bad vibes. Metal Knight wanted to use the meteor event for a WEAPONS TEST when he's safe away in his dark lab?!

I think Genos is thinking the same thing. Maybe further in the series, Saitama and Genos will have to fight rogues in the Association. Genos vs Metal Knight!
>> ARTICLE
I think the association has good intentions, they just can't control their heroes. The Association builds threat shelters and organizes heroes in order to protect the people, but isn't powerful enough to force S class heroes in action.

[Personality Spoilers](/s "It also doesn't help that a lot of the heroes are kind of shitty people only out to help themselves. They couldn't care less about what the association wants them to do unless it increases their fame. This includes a lot of S class")

Amazing.

I like how Saitama didn't try and defend himself against something that clearly wasn't his fault, and pointed out the meteor caused the destruction and they can go suck an egg. I was expecting some sort of gag or something to end the segment, instead we got to see what makes him such a good hero; he'll save the day whether people appreciate him or not.

I haven't read the manga or anything, but I'm starting to think of Saitama as a Jesus type figure who is supposed to be "all powerful" but no one (the public) really respects him. Only the ones close to him really do.

#Episode 7: Tumblr Goes Wild

This episode gave us a bit of an outlook on Saitama's character. He's not doing it for people's gratitude, he's doing it because he just feels like it. This might be a twisted and warped idealism of what a hero should be, but Saitama is always going to be Saitama and he's more of a hero than those who label themselves as one.

For what would seem like a filler episode (in a comedy show, no less), this had a great amount of substance that makes this show feel a lot more alive than just having the usual gags. The action and visuals for OPM is great, but shit like this is what makes it amazing. ONE might've had subpar artistic skills compared to Murata, but goddamn if he isn't a good writer.

ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL EPISODE 10/10.

They managed to re-create intense action sequences, the comedy shined through being sprinkled throughout the episode, and it even manages to be thoughtful with the crowd mentality and reactions of the public in general to similar events.

I felt the weakest part though was Saitama yelling to the crowd, it came off as a bit quiet/flat, seemingly a weak performance (though this may have been intentional, he's a guy who really wouldn't yell much, so it is in character I suppose...)

Overall, this is an episode that brilliantly highlights the potentials of One Punch Man, and the reason why so many love the manga.

IF YOU'RE UNSURE OF RECOMMENDING A FRIEND ONE PUNCH MAN,

SHOW THEM THIS EPISODE!!!

Read the manga many times both Murata and One's version, by far my fav manga, loved the scene where Saitama tells the crowd to fuck off, but I can't help but relate to the crowd just a tiny bit. 

Cause if my house that I spent years of 40+ hours of hardwork per weeks to paid off was destroyed along with my car and my 20+ years of anime/manga collection, (if I had one) was destroyed, I would be devastated. Even though I'm not a materialistic person, but this is what I spent years of effort and hardship on, I might be able to get some of that stuff back but I can't get back the time I spent working for it. What I'm trying to say is, if that happened to me in real life, I might not want to start all over and just end it, but maybe i'm being over dramatic.

This might go up in one of my top anime of all time. Please for the love of guava juice let them make this a long running series.

Nice and clean

There's so many moments every single episode that are memorable (and also gifable), it's pretty insane.

ohh

God that scene with Genos in arms mode looked amazing

Saitama gives no fucks about a metor or the BS coming these salty ass tank top siblings

Sea King arc incoming! Anime only's are in for a treat.

Bang does look like Zeno Zoldyck.
I love the idea of Saitama actually getting to express himself to the citizens he is saving. I think Saitama is going to start using the threat levels to his advantage to save the day and try to promote  his class rank, so he can honestly nitpick what are problems he may have to step in and contribute too.

SEA KING HYPE!

I can't wait for Smile Man's big chance...

Another excellently animated fight scene, nice. Too bad Saitama's not getting the recognition he deserves.

The moment when he destroys the meteor is absolutely magical. The music, everything. God, I love this show. :')
>> ARTICLE
I love the OP, listen to it when I need when I need that extra bit of motivation to hit the gym and it works every time. ONE PUNCH!! 
>> ARTICLE
The show really catches the essence of the manga where you read it and then it's gone in 5 seconds 
>> ARTICLE
At first I thought that they missed the opportunity to have that guy named Tank-top Puma (or something black) to stay in theme with his brother. Then he started talking. Tank-Top ~~Black~~Ass-hole seems appropriate. 

Also, is there anything OPM can't beat with one punch? Can he "defeat" entropy by punching it? 

And Genos is going to keep upgrading to bigger and bigger fists, ain't he? 
>> ARTICLE
The best part is definitely when the tank top fucks think that they're gonna destroy Saitama, but the exact opposite happens. Especially when Tank Top Black Hole goes from bragging about his 2,800 psi grip strength to crying in like, five seconds.
>> ARTICLE
Cool guys don't look at explosions.

Haha what an episode :)

Can't wait for the next episodes.

i hope saitama~sensei punches the Top brothers to the point of those assh*les being a mere dust ..my BP reach its peak when sensei was being booed

I'll definitely remember those crop top guys.

whoa, unexpected depths from this episode! i was feeling so-so from this anime until now. great ep!

everything's shaping up to be so interesting. glad i stuck with it.
>> ARTICLE
Damn this soundtrack is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
The real star of this anime is the soundtrack

The serious theme/motif that played when Saitama went after the meteor and when he and Genos were walking home is incredible

Genos' inner monologue theme is just perfect
>> ARTICLE
I like the scene at the end.  

Shows that Genos is changing as and individual, and his respect for Saitama who doesn't care of people's opinion, he just wants to help people. 
>> ARTICLE
You'd think this isn't an anime subreddit with the amount of spoilerish manga talk and stupid hints everywhere.
>> ARTICLE
Think the mods have given up as well
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much given up on even avoiding them at this point. To be fair, from what I've read so far it doesn't seem like this is the kind of series where spoilers will ruin the experience much. No big plot twists or particularly big developments.
>> ARTICLE
Even as a manga reader I've seen webcomic hints and spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
Sea King next week :)
>> ARTICLE
Saitama looks like the bald one of brazzers. They could totally make a   OPM parody.

Also, Genos theme is so great I'm just waiting for the anime  OST release :)
>> ARTICLE
Hated this show at first...

Now I'm enjoying it quite a bit. I don't understand all the gushing hype for it. But I'm hoping the show can prove me wrong.

I think I'm hesitant because it feels like there is no adversity, at all. There's a problem? I'm sure the dude will show up with his fist and save the day. I don't feel stressed out enough watching the show 

But it's enjoyable at least

And it doesn't hurt that it has the 2nd best OP of the season(behind noragami arogoto)
>> ARTICLE
It begins!!!

Why does this opening theme feel shorter than any other anime OP's?

Edit: They had the "Ippan Zin" shirt!
>> ARTICLE
> Why does this opening theme feel shorter than any other anime OP's?

Because it's really really good.

Also, I think it is actually a little bit shorter than most.
>> ARTICLE
It's still a minute and a half. 1:24 to 2:53.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, it does feel shorter!
>> ARTICLE
This epsiode reminded me so much of Gatchaman CROWDS Insight.

I swear, Hajime and Saitaman need to be friends
>> ARTICLE
Amazing episode, I ship Saitama and Genos even more now. On a serious note though, will we ever see that Tornado person witnessing the greatness of our lord and saviour Saitama?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, but not this season.
>> ARTICLE
That would probably be in Season 3, if it ever happens.
>> ARTICLE
The music was perfect during that moment, really loving how great this is coming out animated.
>> ARTICLE
There is a song in the ost that sounds like a music from FF7. Specifically the music that plays in the Mako Reactor. This is the second time I've heard it so far in OPM.

edit: or is it shinra?
>> ARTICLE
So is it implied that Saitama was the one who was reading the reactions on the internet?
>> ARTICLE
What? You blind or something?
>> ARTICLE
The episode ended too soon.. :-(
>> ARTICLE
Bang = Killua's grampa 
>> ARTICLE
Without spoiling anything. The next Arc is the best imo. Really sets the tone for the series.
>> ARTICLE
Poor Genos, just ineffectual in comparison to sensei
>> ARTICLE
But he looks cool being ineffectual.  That cyborg arm cannon and modular armor briefcase.  He's awesome.
>> ARTICLE
This episode just demonstrates how shitty the authority are in this anime when it comes to emergency evacuation procedures. 30 mins in and that's the time they decided to tell the people to evacuate.

I guess it also goes to say how dumb some people are for not seeing the meteor 2-3 hours ago and for trusting superheroes dressed in tank tops (I really hate those guys.)
>> ARTICLE
Did Saitama punch Tiger tank top?  


>> ARTICLE
Super normal tap lol
>> ARTICLE
More like he 'lightly' pushed him away :P
>> ARTICLE
 I blinked and missed the impact point, and was so confused about why Tank top flew away instead of turning into a rest mist. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, is understandable XP Besides, Saitama-sensei doesn't punch people, even trash like those two, he only kills monsters/threats :P
>> ARTICLE
My friend put this on yesterday so I finally started watching (originally thought it was a boxing anime so I didn't watch it at the start of the season, by the time I realised my mistake I just kept putting off starting it.)

I think this series is definitely solidly in the 8/10 category for me, it has a kind of "nanatsu no taizu without the awkard fanservice or talking pig" feel to it..

Can't say it's going to be my AOTY though, or even AOTS with Owarimonogatari in the mix.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit those points! <_<

The public can be so dumb and gullibe. Can't believe they'd listen to some ravings by two C-class losers over the guy who saved their city.
>> ARTICLE
Disappointed...Metal Knight scene didn't last the whole episode.
>> ARTICLE
im glad saitama is at least getting some credit from the organisation, i hate things were there is misunderstanding where either somebody doesnt get credit for something or gets blamed for something they didnt do, those situations piss me off more than anything.

even though i love DBZ i would always get annoyed that Mr satan would always get credit for shit he didn't do when he was worthless.
>> ARTICLE
Too bad they didn't animate the meteor quite the same way as the manga did it.  Ah well, the rest was fantastic as always.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama is a tsundere confirmed
>> ARTICLE
I think at this point it can be established that saitama is superman. I mean depending on how seriously the show takes itself it may stick to he just trained a lot but I do hope we get some more info on how he can pretty much fly and move really fast.
>> ARTICLE
He can't fly because, as he himself said, 'normal peope can't fly, idiot' XD Of course, when you can move faster than anything and jump beyond anything, flying becomes overated :P
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he's flying actually. It certainly looks like he does but before going to hit the meteor he crouched first. That was a jump.

Also the last monster he defeated he ate the seaweed stuff. Maybe eating monsters is how he got strong?
>> ARTICLE
the show told you what he did to get strong.bog standard weight training. also determination to transcend his limits.
>> ARTICLE
He ate that monster to grow hair
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how Saitama masturbates if he does, does he just tone down his force?
>> ARTICLE
His junk's just every bit as indestructible as he is.
>> ARTICLE
One Pump Man
>> ARTICLE
The Hero Association must have some sort of conspiracy against Saitama.  
No way they'd assume that it wasnt all Saitama that stopped the meteor after they had received a report of the whole incident from Genos and Bang.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more the "Heroes" rather than the association itself. 

The Heroes are mostly just beefed up bullies who want to earn an easy buck off of doing what they do best. That's why they bully the new guys and try to get as much credit as they can. That's how most of the heroes might be like.

Except Mumen Rider

He's kind enough to retrieve balloon for a young kid

Wait for it, you still don't know the true limits of heroicity and awesomeness that Licenseless Rider can achieve :)

I'm glad he stayed, though, because his fight was awesome :D
>> ARTICLE
Yeah his fight was super hyped especially the part where've got naked lol
>> ARTICLE
Would've been cool to see him fight the Sea King with his weapons, but oh well.
>> ARTICLE
According to ONE, he would have won if he'd had weapons.
>> ARTICLE
sorry new here, who is ONE?
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for noob question but who is ONE?
>> ARTICLE
The original creator of the Onepunchman webcomic. He both writes and draws it, it's much further along in the story than the manga version he writes and Yusuke Murata draws.
>> ARTICLE
Would you say that the art style changes significantly when Muruta is the one drawing? Also I'm an idiot I just got the third volume of one punch man yesterday and It says on the left written by ONE :P
>> ARTICLE
ha ha... yeah... there's a bit of a difference. I don't know if there's a rule against linking to scans of manga (on the sidebar it says not to link to torrents/unofficial streams so I'll play it safe) but there are links on /r/OnePunchMan 

ONE's art has gotten a lot better since he started OPM. But he's no Murata.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for taking your time for answering my questions. Hope you have a great day. 
>> ARTICLE
Should i read ONE? What is it exactly?

>> ARTICLE
ONE is the creator of onepunchman. He makes it as a sideproject while doing other stuff like Mob Psycho 100. His version is the webcomic with... different art. Yusuke Murata then came in and started redrawing everything.
>> ARTICLE
WHAT. Thanks for the INFO.
>> ARTICLE
Whats Sonic power level suppose to be anyway? He was certainly not below pri pri, so equal to Genos?
>> ARTICLE
S-class and probably the same as genos because [Manga Spoilers] (/s "They're on equal terms when they were fighting and its more like they're the real rivals instead of saitama and sonic")
>> ARTICLE
Yes. [Manga](/s "They fight each other to a standstill in the Fubuki arc")
>> ARTICLE
Also according to ONE: A fight between Sonic and Genos (that isn't stopped by a third party) would end in a tie.
>> ARTICLE
Huh... so does that mean Genos is gonna get jobbed AGAIN next week?
>> ARTICLE
Genos gets jobbed practically every episode he's in. Why would next week be any different?

Episode 2: Mosquito Girl - jobbed. Held his own against gorilla man.

Episode 3: Asura Kabuto - jobbed.

Episode 4: Not in the episode long enough to get into a fight to get jobbed.

Episode 5: Picked a serious fight with Saitama - Knew he woulda been jobbed at least twice, but Saitama was clearly more interested in Udon.

Episode 6: Leaves the jobbing to the A-rankers, too busy cleaning a toilet.

Episode 7: Tries to take out the meteor, fails. Saitama shows up and shatters it like it ain't no thing.

Episode 8: Not in long enough to get jobbed along with the rest of the small fry.

It just means his Episode 9 jobbing will have extra budget.
>> ARTICLE
I won't spoil what happens in the episode, but my first comment in this chain was about ONE saying sonic could have beaten sea king if he had his weapons. 
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, who is ONE?
>> ARTICLE
The guy who created Onepunchman. It started out as a webcomic written and drawn by him. Then it was redrawn by Yusuke Murata. There's... a palpable difference.

Example: http://i.imgur.com/c8dleMC.jpg

ONE's version is much further along than the redraw, and the redraw is much further along than the anime will get to for a long time (if ever).

ONE also makes Mob Psycho 100, for which the art is vastly better than his work on OPM. He's a talented writer and his art's improving, but OPM is absolutely a sideproject compared to his other stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Note that both Sonic and Genos have powered up since the Sea King fight, so it is unknown if they would tie at this point in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Sauce? Not because I don't believe you, because I love when the creators answer hypotheticals like that.
>> ARTICLE
It was either an interview or one of the side things where Genos answers questions in the original webcomic. Can't remember which.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't ONE also say that Sonic could beat pre-rain Sea King only?
>> ARTICLE
Pre-rain WITH weapons.
>> ARTICLE
As much as Snek is a jackass to Saitama, at least he is trying to be real hero when it actually matters, even if he isn't really... effective.
>> ARTICLE
Class A heroes, as you saw are actually good and are the ones dealing with most of the stuff, it's just that some monsters are hard to take even for S-class.
>> ARTICLE
And then there's Saitama.

>> ARTICLE
I hope he starts 100 pressups/situps training soon.
>> ARTICLE
But how far on a bike is the equivalent of a 10km run?
>> ARTICLE
From my understanding an ironman is supposed to be the marathon equivalent for both swimming and biking also.

An ironman is consisting of a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2-mile (42.2 km) run.

Using those numbers I would say it's a 42.7km bike ride. Sooo almost the equivalent of a marathon. That's pretty interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Damn those red lights when you're trying to save the world!
>> ARTICLE
He's trying to get that license YO!
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait to show this episode to my friend.  He's the kind of guy that obeys all traffic regulations when playing Grand Theft Auto.
>> ARTICLE
That properly cracked me up. The humour in this episode was on point.
>> ARTICLE
They got me with Genos and Saitama's running animation.
>> ARTICLE
What's more is that is probably more accurate than stylized running like in Naruto.
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact about that. In the house of evolution episode, Genos is doing that silly ninja run, while Saitama is running like a human.

And now we are in this episode and they are both running normally. And Saitama doesn't think he can teach Genos anything.
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact 

Anime characters run like that to save money on animation 
>> ARTICLE
I had literally goosebumps looking at Saitama's serious face at the end scene..!!!
I can't wait for the next episode!!!

I actually shouted "OH SHIIIT YEH"
Huge hype for next episode

My shout was more akin to a scream of agony but I get you

Pretty sure this is the first cliffhanger of the anime so far and given how well they handled it, I'm ok with it. Still sort of blue balled us, but damned if I'm not excited for next week.

Im glad they didn't cliffhanger it when he broke into the Shelter tbh. Theres only so much good OPM content you can stuff in a single episode

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he seems like a pretty nice guy too since he gave Saitama a ride.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I've always felt, Licenseless Rider is Saitama if he never became strong. It's still a hobby, but he takes it more seriously and has a much harder time of it, so he's far less jaded/desensitized.
>> ARTICLE
If you read the manga or webcomic it's more clear that Mumen Rider is probably one of the truest heroes.
>> ARTICLE
He's is kind of like Superman if he didn't have powers. The same kind of personality.
>> ARTICLE
He's Captain America (or the .jp version) without powers.

They gave him Captain America's VA from the JP dub, apparently.

the webcomic isnt from THAT far back. ONE just kinda scribbles it out. The trick is that it might not LOOK good, but in other technical aspects its pretty solid, and that's why all Murata does for the manga is take that same scene and make it look incredible.

It's the original webcomic by ONE. The "better" drawn images is the redrawn version by Murata Yusuke.

Saitama is a good man. There's a quote from Terry Pratchett's Men At Arms that describes Saitama perfectly. 

 Something Vimes had learned as a young guard drifted up from memory. If you have to look along the shaft of an arrow from the wrong end, if a man has you entirely at his mercy, then hope like hell that man is an evil man. Because the evil like power, power over people, and they want to see you in fear. They want you to know you're going to die. So they'll talk. They'll gloat.

They'll watch you squirm. They'll put off the moment of murder like another man will put off a good cigar.

So hope like hell your captor is an evil man. **A good man will kill you with hardly a word**.
*Terry Pratchett, Men at Arms*

Saitama will usually watch to see what they can do, rather than gloat.

Read the webcomic it explains everything

We actually know, it has been more or less revealed in the ONE version. 
>> ARTICLE
[ONE](/s "Except that it hasn't been revealed what allowed Saitama to *survive* his training.  Willpower alone will not keep your body from breaking when you overtrain.  So I'd call that "training past the limits" thing a red herring.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Garou was able to become stronger too when he was about to break his limits just like when Saitama still have a hair. Saitama was already strong even before he lost his hair and Garou is probably just as strong as Saitama with hair. The narration in garou part clearly said Garou seems to be breaking his limits but not fully broken just like Saitama without hair")

Mind telling me here or pm-ing me the source for that? Can't seem to remember where that was mentioned?

>> ARTICLE
Saitama pretty easily defeated the first monster he came across to save that chin kid. He didn't actually punch it, but still way stronger than licenseless rider.
>> ARTICLE
That was mostly using leverage to make the most of a weak point. I don't think he did anything that Licenseless Rider couldn't also do, but LLR might not have thought of that on the spot like Saitama.
>> ARTICLE
I read that as you saying he got his power from sarcasm. XD
>> ARTICLE
Yup, if he were to train hard enough to kill himself and somehow survive.
>> ARTICLE
He probably can. He just need an extreme goal and willpower. The air boxing monster turned into that because he constantly air boxed. Saitama wanted to beat anything with 1 punch, hence he got strong enough for that. If Licenseless Rider wants to beat everything with a tackle, he just got to work out with a lot of willpower like Saitama.
>> ARTICLE
Mumen rider is the kind of person who SHOULD have Saitama's powers.
>> ARTICLE
Well, Licenceless Rider is such an important character because he's exactly what Saitama was before he became too strong to care anymore. We'll learn more about it eventually, but we know Saitama began training because he wanted to fight for justice. That's what pushed him so hard in the first place. His issue is that being so powerful takes all of the excitement and fulfillment out of justice. So I'll retort by saying that if Licenseless Rider had Saitama's insane power, he'd be pretty much the same.

yes, pri-pri-prisoner has a thing for males.

yes, the sea king looks kinda... gay (no, seriously, this is not an insult, for me he just looks that way)

and at this moment we manga readers realized... that sonic is a guy...
>> ARTICLE
we knew sonic was a guy:

http://1pun.ch/handjob.gif
>> ARTICLE
Haha yeah in the anime he is portrayed clearly as a guy, but in the manga he has a womanly figure so most readers assumed sonic was a she
>> ARTICLE
They didn't really portray him any differently... He just has a voice so.
>> ARTICLE
The difference was that in the Manga we didn't had that scene to verify that he was a guy. If you check it out just seem like Sonic still acted as a girl 
>> ARTICLE
I mean we didn't have that amazing ball physics in the manga indeed. But we still had that [shaky legs moment](http://i.imgur.com/Pik6TiD.jpg?1), that almost proved that he was a guy. The ones that kept calling him a girl even after that were just in denial.

Wait, I don't understand. Why does this shaky legs picture prove he's a guy?

It doesn't, this guy just thinks that it wouldn't hurt for a girl to fall sensitive parts first onto an immovable object like saitama's fist at the speed of sound.

Oh, right. Breaking your pelvis is great :D

Well actually, a punch to the snatch can also hurt really, really bad too.

Especially a punch from Saitama.
>> ARTICLE
But he didn't punch him. Sonic fell unto his fist.
>> ARTICLE
he fell onto an object at the speed of sound... 
>> ARTICLE
My case maintains. Saitama didn't punch him if he did then, in the best case scenario, Sonic wouldn't be a man anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Well, with the speed at which he moves, he probably has gone through some special training to make them resistant.

Otherwise I'm not sure he'd be very comfortable with all the shaking.

Hell, even [King](http://i.imgur.com/cwXquq5.png) looks good now and then. And in this episode, we got [more Sonic and and Angel](https://i.imgur.com/4wFoyFP.jpg) (if you're into that).

And speaking of fanservice, we can't forget the [SaitamaxGenos](http://i.imgur.com/7C6j9FR.jpg) shipping that's been going now. Fuck, even MADHOUSE has gotten in on it, just look at the [lyrics for the ED!](http://www.lyrical-nonsense.com/lyrics/hiroko-moriguchi/hoshi-yori-saki-ni-mitsukete-ageru/#page=English) Looks it was written by a fujo.

Saitama may seem like he doesn't care most of the time, but when Genos is in danger and he shows [this face](http://i.imgur.com/buh5Eki.png), you know shit just got real.
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't know Genos is fighting the Seaking yet though does he?
>> ARTICLE
The Hero Association said that a S-class hero was taken down, but Saitama doesn't that it was pri-pri-prisoner.  He probably thinks it's Genos, so that's why he's serious.
>> ARTICLE
Well the Hero Association talked about an S Class Hero being defeated, and the only S Class Hero Saitama knew was around was Genos.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably implied, since he knows genos went ahead of him, and he probably doesnt know any other s heros himself, being saitama and all
>> ARTICLE
It's not implied that he is worried about Genos, he knows Genos can survive a lot, been a cyborg and all of that, so he can be easily recovered. It's the danger of the situation, so far we haven't heard about an S class been defeated, even if we saw incredibly powerful enemies already, this is the first one that is grounded on the rest of the world by fighting one of the strongest heroes known to Earth, instead of facing the god that Saitama is.

It's not about Genos, it's about a strong enemy, which is what he's been searching for for years.

It's been a pretty great adaptation so far. Really great animation overall. That said, it can't compare to the redrawn manga's art. But to be fair, that is asking a weekly animation team to match up to freaking Murata

The panel with Lighting Max' smashed face was missing in the anime.

Many things that the anime did different is also because it adapts the physical copy of the manga, in other words the Volumes you can purchase. 

Many scenes were drawn differently in the Volumes than they were in the manga you can find on the net.
>> ARTICLE
But the picture is from the volume.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of stuff was missing in the anime, for example the manga showed the three heroes being beaten one by one, the anime only showed Snek thrown out.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I noticed that too. The scene where the Sea King pierces one of them looked brutal in the manga because only on the next page you were told he was a cyborg. This episode felt a bit "mild".
>> ARTICLE
It's true. But I don't feel like the anime is rushing anything either. They're saving time for the good parts of the Deep Sea King arc. No one really cares to see Snek and the other 3 hereos ousted real quickly. It was hardly significant in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I am not saying that cutting that was bad. But they did add new scenes with Rider and Saitama, I don't know how to feel about that. The only reason I am against cutting and changing small parts is because it makes the manga-anime index harder to create for me.
>> ARTICLE
Weekly reminder OPM basically reddit hugged of death DAISUKI

>> ARTICLE
Alright guys, we can say this episode was a turn on for the next one. But here's the thing, this was one of the best episodes in this anime, because it was the only episode where a hero who's not Saitama or Genos has shown his true power and has defeated some enemies (I'm talking about that Lancer, of course ) because until this episode every hero but the protagonists were useless as hell. It makes it look realistic and really made me think about what hero will come to help instead of just waiting for Saitama, this is an enormous step forward in my opinion.

The Post-Ending Preview music sounds SUPER familiar! Anyone can help me relate it and also find it for me? The same track was used at post ending of Episode 4.

Pretty Please!
>> ARTICLE
Another great episode OwO! Highlights this week: Genos comment about naked-Sonic, Licenceless Rider showing how dedicated to being a Hero he is, and Sonic vs. Sea King (I won't mention him against Pri-Pri-Prisoner for...obvious reasons). That epic face of Saitama at the end is also an advice for anime-only viewers: Get ready for some epic feels and TRUE JUSTICE next week :D!
>> ARTICLE
The subtlety of the rain starting to fall after Puri Puri Prisoner gets KTFO.

The whole episode was awesome, yet again, but this was my favorite part.
>> ARTICLE
Amazing episode! Finally a well executed cliffhanger, can't wait how Saitama destroys sea king next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Dammit the ended it right when I was really hyped up! Next episode's fight will probably last about 20 seconds though as Saitama will make easy work out of him I'm guessing. We're starting to see the start of people recognising him as One Punch Man I think as they were saying he defeated everyone in one punch. Can't wait for next week!
>> ARTICLE
Am I imagining things, or does Stinger have the same VA as Lancer from FS/N?
>> ARTICLE
Licenseless Rider has the "hero character." Like we saw in the episode, where other C class heroes were running away, he was running towards the danger, for the sake of justice. He's a regular hero with a heart of gold, and even if he can't do much, or he's too weak, he'll sure as hell never give up and run away.
>> ARTICLE
I just can't wait for new episodes, this hurts me so much.
>> ARTICLE
So next episode we've got Seafolk Arc conclusion and probably [OPM spoilers](/s "Boros arc introduction").

We'll see King this season, right?
>> ARTICLE
Already did
>> ARTICLE
I was pretty butt hurt when the ending credits started to roll. Fack. needs. to. see. Saitama. One. Punch. People. PLZ.

OMFG this was so good!!!

''Who are you?''
''I am the hero Saitama''

I read the manga........ but.........

FUCK YOU MADHOUSE!! FUCK YOU AND YOUR MOTHER-FUCKING CLIFFHANGERS! I hate that studio so much.

I love that studio so much.

Manga reader question.

We're making better pace through the series than I thought we would.  Only 8/13, and we've been introduced to Sea King.  Are we going to get to [Spoilers](/s "The alien invasion") by episode 13/13?
>> ARTICLE
This season has 12 episodes and the arc should start by episode 10.
>> ARTICLE
ARGHHH cliffhanger...
>> ARTICLE
Am i the only one who thought the big bad at the beginning was Cthulu??
>> ARTICLE
Holy Jesus, maybe it's because I've read the manga and I know where this goes but I felt so insanely hyped at all the build up toward the end of the episode. Pacing was perfect. 
>> ARTICLE
That cliffhanger is gonna kill me.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know what the ost at the end of episode 8 is?
>> ARTICLE
sigh...nobody knows yet. The OST isn't out yet.
>> ARTICLE
Stinger with the TTGL Drill moves? His weapon looks like Grandaddy Simons drill-staff.
>> ARTICLE
Finally they start showing more heroes in action. I get even more hyped when I imagine the boros arc.
>> ARTICLE
Cliff hanger 
>> ARTICLE
Well, Puri-Puri-Prisoner is unexpectedly fabulous. 

Goddamn cliffhangers though. This is definitely a show made for binge-watching.
>> ARTICLE
dat pedal. gotta hime!

no but seriously, great episode! i can't believe it ended on a cliffhanger but that just hypes me up for next week's episode.
>> ARTICLE
love the animation during the sonic and sea king fight. dat slow motion!!
>> ARTICLE
I was afraid this episode was going to end up being a two parter :( 


>> ARTICLE
When they decided that Episode 7 was going to solely cover the meteor and aftermath I knew that the Deep Sea King was going to take 2 episodes. That's ok though cause now we know the pacing and we know how the season should end. I'M SO HYPED.
>> ARTICLE
No way to fit all of that in one episode.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, just excited to see whats to come animated :) 
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse is doing an amazing job with One Punch Man.

I read the manga before the anime started and thought it was ok, not amazing, but not shit either.

Now the anime is a highlight of the week, I can't wait for Monday to roll around. Love the soundtrack too, the music for the fight scenes is great & that opening, I usually skip openings but I love it.
>> ARTICLE
I guess this means the episode is out?
>> ARTICLE
That would be the logical conclusion, yes.

It was a side chapter. Anime on a short episode run don't run side chapters usually.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's why it sad that Murata didn't make it a normal chapter. Most bonus chapter would feel out of place because they are unrelated to the current plot, but this one would fit very well.
>> ARTICLE
[The ultimate enemy appeared this episode! Saitama doesn't stand a chance in a fight with this opponent! The dreaded Octopus Man!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFeT8UuV0d4)

Nothing against Saitama, but now that we're into the more fleshed out story arcs, it's a lot better now that the focus is off of him. Puri Puri Prisoner is the best. I'm sure everyone already noticed, but it was great how Sonic wound up with his shirt ripped up so he'd look like a girl.

Deep Sea King gets faster in the rain, he has the Swift Swim ability. 

King Torture would be so ashamed of you, Amai Mask! You have almost the same attitude on crime fighting that Flamenco Daimond had!

Poor Snek, he knew he didn't have a chance but led everyone to do the best they could.

Next episode Genos and Mumen Rider fight the Deep Sea King, hype hype hype. 
>> ARTICLE
Gotta give it to Snek though that even with that prideful attitude of his, he still managed to stand up and face against impossible odds. Albeit he ran at the evacuation center first like the others XD He earned a little respect from me at least!
>> ARTICLE
Is anyone else having trouble watching this? Daisuki's been struggling to load for me and the site I use won't load it either. Looks like everyone wants to watch the episode this week. I need my OPM fix!

If you are in the States and don't mind yellow subs, try Hulu.
>> ARTICLE
I don't get why people like the Rider so much, I mean he has his moments but not that much more than any other one-scene hero.

Guess it's a manga thing, so guess I'll find out later.

Till then, Genos hype, and hopefully Sonic will come back next episode as well.

You don't know nothing, I repeat nothing until next episode.

Sea king:"I hate posers.....as in, I REALLY, REALLY, REAALLLLY hate posers......it makes me want to kill them. and not in the "oh i'm going to kill you lol ded" sort of way....no...it makes me want to slowly, painfully torture the shit out of them.....to watch them squirm...kind of like watching a fine wine ferment before beating your wife upside the head with the bottle for- oh, wait, where was i? oh right, hey...stinger, wanna see something cool?"

stinger:"w-wha-"

sea king: "It's my new catch-phrase! i figured if i'm going to be up here, violently conquering mankind, I should have a catch-phrase.."

Sea-King: "Hiiii."


Lightning max: "HOLYFUCKINGWHATTHEFUCKSHITGODDAMNNOPE.AVI/MPEGDAFQDIE!!"

*uses a kicking sort of attack*

Sea king: *while brushing off smoking shoulder* "Heard you were talking shit."

Lightning max: "I am the awesomely superpowerful, totally stealthy hero lightning max and I'm going t-"

sea king: "that's nice kid." *bitchslaps him into a building.*

Max:"th-the fuck. okay, I got this, holy shit he's looming right over me, but I still got this, and, and, and-"

sea king: "Hey kid, wanna see something cool?"

Lightning max: "wha-wha- GO FUCK YOURSELF! ULTIMATE FLASHY ATTACK OF DOOOOOM!!"

*Building flashes with a massive explosion*


*few seconds pass*


sea king; "FUCK YEAH! SEAKING!!"

*max gets punched through the building and is caught by quite possibly the manliest hero on earth.*


sea king:"I guess the hype just wasn't enough."


Puri-Puri prisoner: "IT'S A GOOD THING I JUST CAME OUT OF JAIL TO STHAVE THE HANDSOME LITTLE BOYS OF THIS FINE STHITY FROM CERTAIN DESTHTRUCTIONNN! HEY THERE LITTLE BOY STHONIC, HOW YA DOIN?"

sonic: "Go fuck yourself."

sea king: "Okay, I give up. what the hell are you supposed to be?"

Puri:"I'M THE MOST FABULOUSTH STH RANK HERO IN THE WORLD!! I SAVE WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM EVIL LIKE YOU!!" 


*Turns to the camera* 

"No hetero"

sea-king: "then allow me to introduce myself with my fabulous new catch phrase."

puri:"AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE STHAILO-"

sea-king:"Oooohh.........magika-"

Puri:"WELL AREN'T WE A STHASSY BITCH?!" *FABULOUSLY BONE CRUSHING PUNCH*

sea king:"that one actually hurt...somewhat, kinda.....okay mostly tickled but you get the point."

Puri:"YEAH, TOTALLY DIDN'T HURT! YOU PUNCH LIKE A BITCH!" 

*discreetly relocates fractured jaw and ponders a trip to the hospital before realizing most nurses are women and discarding the thought entirely."


*turns to the camera* 

"No hetero."

Sea king: "well, then, show me what else you've got!"


Puri: "FINE! I'LL JUST USE MY FANTABULOUS SUPERPOWERED ANGEL COMBO!!! STHAILOR TRANSFOOOOORM!!!"

*CENSORED*


Puri: "ANGEL COMBO ATTACK!!"


*SO FUCKING CENSORED*

Sonic: "and here I am, just standing here...NOT masturbating.....dammit saitaima."

Sea king:"was that seriously it? my wife punches better than you do! haha! oh that reminds me, I need to get another bottle of wine later today...so I can stare at it while it ferments.......fermenting my many myriad forms of self loathing to the lowest possible pit of my interna- OH THAT'S RIGHT!! i need to teach you a basic lesson! you see combo attacks are supposed to basically finish OFF your opponent. and seeing as to how I'm standing here....chastising you...welll.....-"


Puri:"wait wha-"

sea king: "FUCK YEAH!!! SEAKING COMBO!!!"

*AS CENSORED AS CENSORED CAN POSSIBLY GET*

sea king: "so, little boy, wanna have a good time?"


*turns to the camera* 

"No homo"


sonic:"you know what? sure, why the fuck not? I just broke out of jail, i'm bored to tears, and I'm way faster than you, case in point-"
*attacks*

sonic:"see? way faster-HOLY FUCK-"

sea king: "whath? isth only my tenthacle tongue!"

sonic: *uppercuts seaking's jaw and cuts off the tentacle*
"THAT'S FUCKING DISGUSTING!! WHAT DO YOU THINK WE JAPANESE ARE? TENTACLE FETISHISTS?!"


sea king: "this has absolutely no effect on me whatsoever." 

*internal screaming*

*ten minutes of go fast later*

sonic: "HA!! I HAVE HIM ON THE ROPES!!! ALL I CAN DO IS DODGE HIS ATTACKS!! actually, wait, why am i dodging? i should just run away! this is boring!"

*runs to nearby rooftop*

"huh, the fuck's a cardboard box doing here? seriously, this ain't the 70s people don't use that anymore."


sea king: "BOO!!"


sonic:"wait, how did you just-"


sea king:" it's been raining for like...an hour now. I mean come on man, don't you ever check abilities? seakings always have swift swim!"

sonic: "Oh......I understood that refere-HOOOLY GOD-"

*MEANWHILE*

saitama: "so let me get this straight, there's a giant fish man."

Director: "Yep. he's way too strong! you should run, as in, the general away direction!"

saitama:"and he's scary powerful?"

director:"THE STRONGEST WE'VE EVER SEEN!!! DEMON LEVEL THREAT!!"

saitama:"I honestly don't see the problem, I mean, it's not like he's bastardizing the image of one of my favorite games or anything."

director: "He's called the "seaking" and he's extremely powerful! he's already injured and killed several S class heroes!"

saitama: "wait, you play that game too?"

director:"what? n-no! there's a fish monster, he's calling himself seaking and fucking everyone's shit up! what are you on about? a videogame?!"

saitama:" that was one of my favorite pokemon...."

director:"hey, stay with me here c rank, you need to evacuate, as in, NOW."

saitama:"he's...ruining my number one pokemon's good name..."

director:"saitaima? he apparently has this catch phrase too, you'll recognize him by it, he shouts "fuck yeah, seaking!" whenever he kills someone, if you hear that, run!"

>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'm kinda disappointed.

Last episode was almost like a filler. We only got to meet Fang (or Bang?) which AFAIK is an important character. We also got a glimpse of Metal Knight.

And this week's episode was just building up hype. Yeah there were a couple of good fights but damn we're 8 episodes in and we still haven't seen any real Saitama action.

I mean sure hype is good but I just can't believe I have to wait another whole week :(
>> ARTICLE
Now you know why Saitama has been so frustrated. He wants real action as much as you do.
>> ARTICLE
Just so that you people know, Pri Pri Prisoner is a rapist.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't that the implication of his character? That he can't stop "attacking" handsome men? 

Why was it necessary for you to point it out... 
>> ARTICLE
Probably figured a lotta people wouldn't realize it without the Prison scene bonus chapter being adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Did they skip the prison scene or is it not where I remember in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Its a bonus chapter, 22.5 or something I think, but it does take place during the events of this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I forgot about that. I know the OVAs are supposed to be original but I hope the prison scene is in one of them.
>> ARTICLE
The seven OVAs are confirmed to be original content so we can only hope for more OVAs =D
>> ARTICLE
What's the song that was playing when Sonic was fighting fabulous sea king? 
>> ARTICLE
The Sakuga this episode was amazing. When the show looks good, it looks REAL GOOD.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that animation during the sonic and sea king fight was so good my heart was beating fast
>> ARTICLE
bro, u spoiled it!

>> ARTICLE
Shit's about to go down in the next EPs
>> ARTICLE
Don't mind me just waiting for the guy who does the anime/manga comparison gifs (the best part after watching the episode)    

edit: and he posted right before me lel
>> ARTICLE
The scene with Sonic and Puripuri Prisoner were the best and I laughed at Genos' and Saitama's naked comments lol. Anime-only watchers missed out on how they bust out but it's an obvious cut for the show. 
>> ARTICLE
That's because that was a side-story/special chapter and so far it doesn't seem they're animating any of those :O
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely cannot wait for next week. The most character development for Saitama for quite a while. 
>> ARTICLE
so many butts this episode 
man that cliffhanger made me feel like somethings missing and i cant wait till next sunday 
>> ARTICLE
Hey, trying to watch the new episode, but I am a snob; why is Daiskui.net only showing me the episode in 360p or 480p?
>> ARTICLE
You gotta create an account with them for higher resolutions, but its a free sign up so its shouldn't be a problem

thanks
>> ARTICLE
You know what, I can already guess, how the fight will end. But still I want to see it so badly, WHY DO I HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER WEAK, YOU CRUEL WORLD!
>> ARTICLE
BLUE BALLS'ED
>> ARTICLE
God damn that badass ending face by Saitama. NEXT EPISODE HURRY, THE FUCK UP.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama's going to fuck this up!!
>> ARTICLE
I fully expected Puri Puri to get a Mahou Shoujo costume for his transformation. Honestly I'm a little disappointed. He's awesome though, in a frightening sort of way.
>> ARTICLE
So manga readers, similar to the running gag in Nisekoi where Raku just couldn't take a hint about her harem, does the non-recognition of Saitama's exploits be a running gag as well up to the latest chapters?

I just hope by the end of this adaptation, Saitama gets 'some' recognition. Maybe a Class up.

And the Hero Association Entrance Exam is flawed giving 50% weight to intellectual capacity.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I can't find any stills of Stinger. I really want one for an edit I wanna make. 

Anyway, episode was great. I loved the added filler of Rider and Saitama's ride to the scene.
>> ARTICLE
Not very satisfied. =(

I was hoping to see Saitama fight. Now I have to wait a whole week. Anyway, Sonic fight was great... Puri Puri Prisioner... man... imagine Sailor Moon like that.
>> ARTICLE
like, naked?
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone notice Yagami Light's voice actor from Death Note? That was pretty funny.
>> ARTICLE
yanno I kinda wanna watch two ppl of similar caliber fight... like I wanna see carnage kabuto vs the sea king... I think that would be a cool fight to watch
>> ARTICLE
No contest. Carnage Kabuto is dragon level and the only dude who sensed Saitama's strenght.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man i haven't been hit by a cliffhanger like this in awhile. Serious blue balls, well executed blue balls. 
>> ARTICLE
Puri-puri Prisoners introduction reminds me of Purple Aki.
>> ARTICLE
Gotta appreciate that Kawajiri touch.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably been asked before -- but for manga/webcomic readers; does Saitama eventually get the recognition he deserves?
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "he goes up in ranks but still nobody knows him") 
>> ARTICLE
Sea king sounds like Tora from Ushio to Tora...anyone know if it's the same VA?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. Same person. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the reply :)
>> ARTICLE
twiddles thumbs until the sea king and Genos share fisticuffs....
>> ARTICLE
This is total speculation but I think it's going to be hilarious when Licenseless Rider becomes A or S rank just for being everywhere Saitama is. 
>> ARTICLE
Go read the manga. Now. 
>> ARTICLE
I was showing this to another friend, and he was the first to say it's a "weird" show in a negative way.  I asked what he thought of the action and comedy, and he said it's just too "out there" for him.  It saddened me that he doesn't get it.
>> ARTICLE
Dammit, cliffhanger D:

Great episode, anyway! Pri pri prisoner got introduced! :D
Licenseless rider to the rescue! Saitama didn't have too big a role, sadly.
Sea king is fucking disturbing.

Hyped
>> ARTICLE
Hisoka vibe from the Sea King...
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck, I was getting chilly when he was answering the phone
>> ARTICLE
This topic was harder to track down than I thought. 
>> ARTICLE
Soooooooo.... Is sonic, like, intentionally really feminine looking? Why was a point made to cut off the middle of his outfit? Why was Puri-Puri Prisoner making a move on him? I had thought that it was just my imagination but it seems like one giant in joke that I'm just not getting.

Please tell me it's not just me.
>> ARTICLE
From what I've heard Sonic in the original webcomic was pretty normal looking but the author who drew the manga was bored by the lack of important female characters and as a joke made Sonic more feminine, because he can. At this point it really is a running gag. 
>> ARTICLE
he had a very feminine waist too
>> ARTICLE
The Deep Sea King looks like Final Fantasy VI's Kefka if he decided to retreat to the ocean for thousands of years of heavy-duty strength training.

But in all seriousness, shit's getting real for me here. I haven't read the manga for this, so I can't wait to see how this arc of the story ends.  
>> ARTICLE
Saitama's serious/angry face at the end of the episode says to me that next episode will be awesome.
>> ARTICLE
i nobody else mentioning that stinger was basically just lancer, am i the only one that thought that?

lightning max also reminded me of laxus from fairy tail.
>> ARTICLE
wow an arc that lasts longer than an episode!
>> ARTICLE
Some people say saitama a fraud but anyone that delivers the fatal blow should deserve more credit than hero who was incapacitated from the fight.

Licenceless-Rider screentime.

Saitama with the shit just got real face.


Yeah man, nothing happened.
>> ARTICLE
Great. 
Summarized that is: Seaking bashes nonames and Puri-puri.

Nothing substantial happened.
>> ARTICLE
I think you don't get the joke of this show. 

It sets up a handful of character against a strong enemy, makes them all loose just so that it gets one shotted by Saitama. That's the joke and that's how the show works.

As this is a reoccurring thing since the first episode I guess the show simply isn't something for you
>> ARTICLE
Oh, no no.
I understand that and totally love the show, but this Episode felt like a filler.
>> ARTICLE
It's just the first event that spans two episodes. That's all. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, really? 

That's odd since this show has one of the most important character developments so far and this episode was kind of the set up for that. But I guess for anime only this is visible once the whole arc is over. 

Then just deal with it for now. I can guarantee you that next episode has a bomb. You might feel like that the episode after that but the last two will be just insane.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call it a joke, because that would be discrediting the efforts those people put in, especially the likes of Sonic, Genos and so on.

You don't get the point of this show if you think this is all a joke

Hey there again, zombie. Seeing as everyone already told you the usual this week, I will be the civilized one today and just tell you straight out: STOP WATCHING THIS. If you REALLY hate the series that much then you do realize that you are wasting weeks of your life in this, not only watching it but posting useless comments that NO ONE is gonna agree with you about? Seriously, anyone would think you WANT people to tell you to get out of here every week...
>> ARTICLE
Its not the point of people agree its saying how my opinion is right
>> ARTICLE
But you CAN'T say that your opinion is right when EVERYONE else agrees that it isn't. So, really, you seem to only be here to be based ._. Everyone else that didn't 'like' the series like you droped it in the 3rd or 4th chapter at the very best. Nowadays, you can go through the thousand comments here and you won't find anyone that shares your supposedly 'right' opinion, they're already gone and watching/doing things they like.
>> ARTICLE
But my opinion is the only one that matters thats what I am getting at I dont give a shit if you like it I hate it simple as that
>> ARTICLE
You've been posting the same ignorant shit for several weeks now. Please actually pay attention to the show instead of giving us plenty of opportunities to downvote you.
>> ARTICLE
oh no downvotes what am I going to do! I dont give a single shit I am already -100 and have been for a long time its live achievement points they do nothing

you do realise that reddit hides anything -5 right? No one is going to treat your words seriously on other matters if you keep this trolling antics up.

Ya for comments I dont get a shit as long as my opinion gets out

You're watching this for the wrong reasons. Not every show needs to have a deep plot or constantly fast pacing.

Do you not enjoy any slice of life shows? 

This is a slice of life comedy.

It really isn't its a watered down shit battle shounen that used the same gag over and over again but the show gets no where I know there are 2 female characters that I know nothing about so manby some better character development but right now just no character development besides oh look this guy is really OP but no one sees him as a good hero bleh 
>> ARTICLE
You're supposed to relate to the main character because he struggles with the same things we do, *not* with fighting the enemies.

I know that feeling of making a purchase right before something goes on discount (heh /r/buildapcsales)(missing the special sale day), 

People hating me for being smarter than them in middle school (like when they yelled at him for destroying the meteor). 

That feeling of trying and failing to swat a mosquito. 

When you didn't realize you had to fill out that form within the week for your insurance reimbursement (when he learned he has to apprehend one criminal a week). 

It's the everyday trials that make the show relatable. He's a frickin superhero, but he has to fill his quota like the salaryman he didn't want to be three years before. He's invincible, but he's lost his hair. He's got a sidekick who wants to learn how to become strong, but *even he doesn't know how!*

And then there's the side dish of getting to watch awesome animation as the bad guys duke it out with other heroes.

OBJECTION! Ace Attorney anime in April.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama impressed me there with his law knowledge.
Maybe he was a law student?
>> ARTICLE
Most likely he learned it from TV.
>> ARTICLE
Did you not watch the first episode?

He was a business man looking for a job
>> ARTICLE
A salaryman isn't necessarily a business man, and wearing a suit for job interviews isn't probably that special in japan. At least I think so.
>> ARTICLE
In fact, most people wear suits to interviews where I'm from...I thought that was pretty standard. How does a suit infer legal knowledge?!
>> ARTICLE
business man =/= law student or lawyer. It's possible, but remember how he pointed out the transformation vs just being a wierdo to the bad guy? He got that from the tv show he was watching. I think he's more of a guy that just knows a bunch of random tidbits of information. I haven't read the webcomic or manga, so I don't know his true background, but that is my guess.
>> ARTICLE
Business students need to know a lot of law. Probably learned stuff when he was trying to become a business man
>> ARTICLE
business man =/= studied business. He was trying to be a normal Japanese worker in a business. You don't generally need to have special business knowledge for that. 
>> ARTICLE
My favorite part is that Saitama's chopsticks at the end were separated improperly. It seems extremely fitting and I'm not sure why.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure that's a panel somewhere in the manga among the bonus pages.
>> ARTICLE
I had just read [this chapter](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O9kr03mpMWA/VjATGiKKIBI/AAAAAAAAlPc/BTG4qQgOqGo/s16000/0034.5-001.jpg) before watching the OVA, too.
>> ARTICLE
That's a nice little store bento. Even has a half-price sticker.

I wonder how many wolves Saitama had to beat up in order to win it.
>> ARTICLE
Probably because he's extremely strong and also kinda a dork at the same time. There really are multiple layers of correct to that one minor detail.
>> ARTICLE
That and separating those fucking things without leaving a little bit connected at the top is damn near impossible, even for Saitama, the God himself.
>> ARTICLE
Azumanga Daioh has taught me how to separate them properly.  You pull them apart from the other end.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I've ever disconnected them improperly...

Then again, Saitama is incapable of slapping a mosquito anyway.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't think I've ever disconnected them improperly...

A big part is how cheaply made they are. Those you get at a small restaurant are probably decent, but those you get at a street stall are likely the cheapest possible and more likely to snap like that.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's true. Though I also bought "bento"-like sushi packs in supermarkets before and while a bit more difficult to break properly, it wasn't impossible.

The ones at restaurants break almost by themselves.
>> ARTICLE
Now we know how and where Saitama got this hero costume from. I would have actually liked to see him wearing [this](http://i.imgur.com/svYMbCu.png) version.

Also, [Genos](http://i.imgur.com/Ide2wz5.png) learned something as well.




>> ARTICLE
I'm sure we'll be seeing fanart of Saitama in that get-up fairly soon.
>> ARTICLE
That line is wrongly translated. What Genos said was more along the lines of, 

"In short, you've been wanting to throw away that hero suit that you've stained with soy sauce but can't because its filled with memories."
>> ARTICLE
That makes a lot more sense considering what Saitama says to him next.
>> ARTICLE
I knew i heard "shoyu." Are the following lines translated correctly?
>> ARTICLE
That entire episode was filled with horrible translation.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I was pretty appalled by the translations in this episode. Sure, I don't have the time or the knowhow to do better ones, but still...
>> ARTICLE
The tailor clearly talks about the town being a "goosto taun" and yet the subtitles are completely different...

I'm glad someone translated it, but it wasn't a good translation.

I thought he was speaking a bit too long for it to be something so simple.

^ This is correct. Well, more correct than the line in the above screenshot.

This was 24 min long.

There are 6 OVAs coming out. 

Holy fuck. We're getting a half cour of extra OPM? All original? 

Assuming that each is 24 min long, but if so, Madhouse is awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse is probably the most consistently awesome anime studio.
>> ARTICLE
> Holy fuck. We're getting a half cour of extra OPM? All original?

Think of it as them realizing the sheer popularity this series has now. 
>> ARTICLE
This and they want to give the buyer of the Manga Volume 10 and the BD some extra content. 

God bless Shueisha, Natsume, all the people he gathered and Madhouse for supporting the project.
>> ARTICLE
This will be the only OVA with full episode length. The other will be around half an episode long. So we get about 16 episodes in total.

Edit: Not Madhouse, Natsume Shingo and his team is awesome :3

>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
For what?

It was in many articles that there will be a full length OVA with the release of Volume 10 and 6 shorter OVA with the BD Volumes.

If you mean the other thing about Natsume, I can gladly explain it :)
>> ARTICLE
I see,thanks
>> ARTICLE
Well we should give some props for Madhouse to give N.Shingo that much of freedom and trust. To tell you the truth this is like a historical moment for a studio/director/team/author & artist to have perfect harmony with each other to make a legendary product. 

Its almost like Firefly or the first trilogy in Star Wars...yeah...
>> ARTICLE
Of course of course! :o
I'm not saying they don't deserve it, it's just that the majority of the work is done by those "hidden heroes" gathered by Natsume. 

Well, you can't blame people for not knowing that they mainly animate it because on the surface all there is as an information is "Madhouse".

It would be just nice to see someone with influence clarifying things a little bit so that people know about them :)

But I have mad respect for all of them, but especially for Natsume. Whenever this man is involved he creates something awesome.

Anyway my main point is that they also get their appreciation and that people stop using this "MADHOUSE SO NO SEASON 2 RIP" argument.

 It's Shueisha that decides this, if they want a second season they'll get it. Even if it means switching studios if Madhouse can't or doesn't want to be involved in the second season. As long as they get Natsume in they are good to go :)
>> ARTICLE
Ah... I hope they could get the original team for season 2... The great thing of this whole situation is that its a proof that "Money doesn't automatically mean great product." At the same time it doesn't matter how much cash Shueisha is willing to spend if they cannot assemble the original team.

Its like Diablo 2 and Torch light, or Golden Eye and Perfect Dark. Same Devs = great game.
>> ARTICLE
I hope so too seems like a good working environment there.

Yes exactly! Natsume managed to assemble the best animators that are in the industry as well as animators from the web generation. Those two combined can create something amazing out of any budget.

Well that's where I'm certain that the team will stay the same. Shueisha approached Natsume because they saw the potential in the anime adaptation of OPM. Natsume agreed because he himself saw also the potential in this show and I bet so do all the dedicated animators there. I imagine this project as an project under friends, so I can totally see this as something they look forward to do again. 

Anyway, good thing is that Murata works for Shueisha so the close relationship to the artist, and with that indirectly to the author, is present. 

So I see no problem for a second season once the source material allows it :)
>> ARTICLE
Aren't these all written or at least supervised by ONE too? 

Wonderful, this'll tide us over for the very long wait if there even will be a season 2
>> ARTICLE
ONE wrote completely original stories for every individual OVA.
>> ARTICLE
Yes they are all written by the author ONE, therefore it's anime original content. 

The anime in general is supervised by ONE and Murata.
>> ARTICLE
Anime original and probably also canon, which makes it even better.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah they are and should be considered canon. It's basically a great chance for ONE to deepen some minor things he just didn't feel like doing so far or planned for the future. I mean there are a lot of things behind Saitama we still don't know, the story behind his suit was one of them. I simply love that they do this because it's even a little surprise for us manga and webcomic readers :)
>> ARTICLE
Didn't expect the OVA to come out this early but it makes up for pain of knowing that OPM is going to end soon...
>> ARTICLE
the cour will end but given the popularity of OPM especially the mainstream popularity basically everywhere around the world it would be a huge, huge fuckup by MadHouse to not continue the series.
>> ARTICLE
>huge fuckup by MadHouse to not continue the series.

You mean like No Game No Life? Sure it's not OPM level, but it was pretty big too, no?
>> ARTICLE
Noone knows for sure, but its expected to have been dropped do to the tracing accusaions at the author.
>> ARTICLE
You can't compare those two. Difference is that Madhouse has no say in the production of OPM. They merely got hired and only fulfill a minor role. They could easily be replaced for a second season.
>> ARTICLE
doubt it considering that director was the only one (and probably is the only one) who can pull the same animating team back together so easily.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I think you misunderstood me, I meant that Madhouse could simply be replaced not the director and his team. They NEED Natsume Shingo and the team he assembled. 

The thing is that the animation studio ( in this case Madhouse ) doesn't have an important role in this production. That's quite the rare occasion but it's happening now and then, I think the last time was in 2014 with Space Dandy. 

If Madhouse doesn't want to ( or doesn't have the means to ) do a second season they can just switch studios while keeping Natsume and his team. So the "Madhouse, so no Season 2" argument people are throwing around doesn't work here :P
>> ARTICLE
Well that one wasn't anyones fuck up...The artist for the original novel got sued for copyright issues, disrupting the creation process. Now you can blame the artist, but the copyright that he violated was merely figure "posing and posture,"  everything else was quite fine (which to me sounds ridiculous). 
>> ARTICLE
Well, nobody's quite sure if the tracing thing actually happened or if it was just an accusation, [but here are comparisons between his art and that of who he supposedly traced](http://www.otakutale.com/2014/no-game-no-life-artist-yuu-kamiya-allegedly-caught-tracing-other-peoples-work/)
>> ARTICLE
pretty obviously traced some of them. Lol at the comments tho.
"its not tracing it just happens to look the same".
Denial much
>> ARTICLE
It's not Madhouse that decides this. They merely got hired by the company Shueisha. They are the ones that decide if there will be a second season.

If they want one, they will get one with or without Madhouse.

But since they saw the potential in the adaptation and gave it their all by hiring Natsume Shingo, I'm sure they will continue to go down that road
>> ARTICLE
There isnt really enough in the manga to do a 2nd season and if there is the pacing wont be great. 3rd season is out of the question though.
>> ARTICLE
I read somewhere on the subreddit that there was just enough for the second season 
>> ARTICLE
Their is definitely enough material for a second season if they did it based off the original webcomic, but since the anime would then go past the manga it would cause issues. Thus, it will be years before any season 2, if we even got one.
>> ARTICLE
There is arguably enough for full two story arcs (if they start production right now), but not from Murata's redrawn but from One's original web comic. However, this is only if One can keep on uploading in a monthly basis, as second arc is arguably in the middle of the story.
>> ARTICLE
judging by where this cour is going to end, there should be just, or almost enough redraw for 12 more eps, and there's about double the redraw's worth in the original?
>> ARTICLE
This really depends, if we expect this season ends in [Spoiler](/s "Boros' Invasion Arc") this means that it took 48 redraw chapters for 1 season. Thus if we divide 12 episodes, 1 episode takes around 4 chapters of redraw, at least for season 1. If we assume this and calculate the current chapter of the online redraw at 84-48=36/4=9 we should have enough for 9 episode of season 2 currently.

However, if we go by page numbers it took around 1390 pages for season 1's total. This is important as some episode requires more page numbers for epic action sequence. Currently, if starting from chapter 49, around 510 pages...not even half of season 1. 

So unless you want a lot of talk and no fights, we'll have to wait a lot more. In this calculation season 2, if they'll ever do it will be purely [Spoiler](/s "Garo's Rampage Arc") 
>> ARTICLE
I'd assume it would end AFTER that arc?

and yeah that's what i was expecting for s2.. it's.. imo quite boring comparatively actually, but very lengthy.
>> ARTICLE
Yup probably, because there is a lot more S-class hero fights in that arc than anything in Season 1. So basically if they'll ever do it in the same quality as now...it would expected to be like episode 5 Genos vs Saitma for at least 3~5 episodes...Man that'll kill the staff...

Just on the side note: If following the redraw currently, don't worry, if it follows the original writing, its going to be exciting real soon.
>> ARTICLE
Do they need Murata's redraw to make the anime? After all this OVA was done without any murata redraws; it was straight from ONE's head to anime

>> ARTICLE
ah so ONE did have lots of input to the anime?
>> ARTICLE
ONE is the original author, he has more to say about this than Murata.
>> ARTICLE
yeah i know that, just didn't know he was directly involved in the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Well...I would say on the safe side... yes...As much talent ONE has for story telling, a lot the action scenes that make this show great were developed by Murata's redraws. That whole episode 5 Genos vs Saitama scene wouldn't be as exciting without Murata's refinement: http://galaxyheavyblow.web.fc2.com/17.html.

As a point, I found to myself that this OVA episode lacked the "epic-ness" of the usual episodes. Granted this is understood as Saitama is still at low-level and the fights are also low level too, which doesn't trigger a contradiction in our minds (which is why ONE and the Director are brilliant).

Edit: Added more info

Edit 2: Also some parts of the story also has some edits by Murata and ONE in the redraw. This is peer-review done by each author to make sure the final product flows nicely and adds more spotlight to other characters. For example, Metal-Bat was redrawn with more spot-light in the Garou-arc of the current redraw (and boy he is much a cool character than the original.) Same with Mumen-rider getting more bromance scenes. 

Edit 3: I also highly doubt Murata had no say in this. I suspect he too did some minor character design and story board with the team (sorry for all the after edits, lol.)
>> ARTICLE
iirc there's probably JUST enough of the redraw to do a second cour

there's enough in the original to do a 3rd, maybe a 4th, but it'd be a lot harder without the redraw to go off perhaps?
>> ARTICLE
There is if they use the web version. Or, like, wait half a year.

They could pull an Arslan Senki, keep going with anime based on mangaka's designs and general plans for manga adaptation's plot instead of waiting 2-3 years or more for the content to come.


...And shortly after the second cour ends, announce ANOTHER SEASON where they'll adapt even more content from novels, also based on mangaka's prototype designs.
>> ARTICLE
Well i mean in the future in general. I wasn't talking about a second cour soon
>> ARTICLE
did the fish guy spit out ball gags? wow
>> ARTICLE
The joke to that character was that "metamorphosis" and "sexual pervert" are the same phrase in Japanese (hentai = literally 'changed state' for both usages) so he was a metamorphosizing pervert, or hentai hentai.
>> ARTICLE
The joke is actually that the fish guy meant to use "henshin" as in transformation like superheroes or monsters do in those series to power-up or use their powers in first place, while Saitama uses the term that can mean both pervert and metamorphosis:

Henshin:
http://jisho.org/word/%E5%A4%89%E8%BA%AB

Hentai:
http://jisho.org/word/%E5%A4%89%E6%85%8B


>> ARTICLE
That's the start of their conversation, but Saitama concludes with "You were already a little hentai when you went hentai, so you're a true complete hentai."  That's why I said that character's gag is in being hentai hentai. (meaning either perverted metamorphosis -or- metamorphosized pervert).
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was meant to be like "you were a little hen (strange), but then you became completely hentai (pervert/metamorph)".

Language jokes are always hard to properly explain...
>> ARTICLE
That's fascinating, why did no one ever explain this to me before
>> ARTICLE
So this is the story behind Saitama's superhero attire. The sentiment behind it was touching and all, but seriously, what the fuck is it made out of for it to not rip from his body when he's moving so fast? You'd also think that his gloves would burn from friction when it made contact with the meteor (or well, anything really).

Also hey, it's rare seeing Saitama having hair or visibly having trouble keeping up against attacks. You bet your ass I savored that as much as possible.

This also contained a little bit of a spoiler which pretty much shows you how monsters are "born" within OPM's universe [Webcomic Spoiler](/s "And as you can expect, through a slightly different process, this is also how some heroes with superhuman abilities are born.")  Well, I call it a spoiler since this has not been brought up yet in Murata's redraw version. 
>> ARTICLE
That spoiler is kind of implied with [implied spoilers](/s "Saitama's glowing eyes") but I didn't know it extended to a general rule instead of just being uniquely special in that regard. My [implied spoilers](/s "theory that Saitama is an alien/not strictly human (like superman kind of) is now out the window though. I thought his abilities had something to do with his origins but I guess not.")
>> ARTICLE
That theory is bonkers. Especially if you already read the Garou arc to the end.

[](/s "Garou was a completely normal human. He was a genius at martial arts, but he didn't have superhuman powers, strength or endurance. But by constantly breaking his limits and coming back from near-death experiences, his body eventually shaped and changed from his clothes, sweat and blood, into a demonic, monstrous form. He also gained strength nearing God level of threat, capable of beating multiple S-rank heroes in a row without breaking a sweat.")

Saitama also had a physical transformation, but his was benign, he only went bald. But his training regime triggered the "limit break" effect that the dude from House of Evolution hinted to.
>> ARTICLE
Or maybe, you know, training until your hair falls off works too.
>> ARTICLE
It's all actually in the strength, training, just watch. He's just the first person to actually stick to the regimen all the way through, or something stupid like that :P End game will be everyone trains and suddenly Saitama's level becomes "normal", so he effectively becomes as normal as he looks, but loves it because he actually gets a challenge from fighting people on his level.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, won't happen.

[one of the S-class hero's backstory spoilers, not revealed in anime yet](/s "Superalloy Darkshine started as a weakling like Saitama, but he trained his entire life constantly pushing his limits. First, with small dumbbells his parents gave him. He quickly transitioned into larger, larger, even larger dumbbells until he was lifting literally tons. His muscles are like steel and his strength is inhuman. Yet he's nowhere near Saitama despite training probably as hard if not harder and much longer.")

That's because he used the AC

Probably wasn't eating bananas either.

>someone who hasnt read the web comic or manga

So do you have any plans on reading it after the anime is over?
>> ARTICLE
Yes! I think once this season finishes up ill jump right in and read through all of it. 
>> ARTICLE
>could also apply to people who are truly good

*cough* Saitama *cough*
>> ARTICLE
Does this mean mumen rider will become like twice as strong as Saitama?
>> ARTICLE
This process most likely doesnt distinguish between the extent of their good deeds, being more like "all or nothing" principle. 

Besides, Mumen raider and Saitama are not diffrent at all. Saitama is just as, if not more good hearted than he is. Saitama just lost his inital motives because he does this hero stuff for so long already, and his immense power turned him into this "i dont care" person. But its shown very often how good he is. Look at ep 9..
>> ARTICLE
> This process most likely doesnt distinguish between the extent of their good deeds, being more like "all or nothing" principle.

It's not exactly all or nothing. We can see that Saitama already is very strong, much stronger than normal people - he's fighting a Wolf level of opponent without getting seriously hurt, despite being tired from constant fights and his training regime. He can jump from heights and his body is clearly getting more buff.

He was probably 1/3 through his training, shortly before his hair fell out and before he gained his power.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama and his rewards lmao. Anyway wishes Saitama punched his landlord too she's a criminal.
>> ARTICLE
strictly legally speaking, I don't think she can be charged of anything, she is just providing criminals with rooms in her apartment (I am assuming she means that the rent they pay is her main income, not that she is part of the crime), I am sure she can get away with saying: "I had no idea of their private activities, I was merely doing my apartment rental business"
>> ARTICLE
It is really unclear if they are just simple tenants or if she is actively involved with them in some way. I took it to mean she takes a cut and lets them live there no questions asked.

i imagine she does take a cut, but it doesn't matter as long as there are no official records of her directly assisting them knowingly

I mean, unless you bought the Vol 10 bundle with the OVA, you're watching this pirated. That means stealing something that someone else has put in the effort to provide.

I'm a fansubber and translator too, and I don't believe fansubbers have any right to complain about credit when we're all sharing pirated material. I have a note on my site that essentially says you can take my translations and use them/modify them however you wish without giving me any credit.

I just want to make sure that anime gets translated, not to take credit for it.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, I just think it's dumb for him to say he did the translation, when he didn't. He presumably did time the subtitles to the video.

I mean, for all we know, the subtitles don't actually match what is being said. What we know here is that this translation two different languages: Japanese -> Spanish -> English. What if the translation from JP->SP is off? Then the EN one probably is as well. I don't think that's what actually happened here, but it's just what's going through my mind. That's just why I think it's dumb to do that.

> I mean, for all we know, the subtitles don't actually match what is being said. 

It's especially apparent when they say English words like "ghost town" which then don't appear in the subs.

As an anime-watcher I'd love a spoiler-free synopsis if anyone can be so kind?
>> ARTICLE
This wasn't in the manga. It's anime original, but ONE did the story.

This OVA tells you the story behind Saitamas hero costume.

It's new for all of us, anime original content. 

Apparently it's the story how Saitama got his hero outfit

er where am I supposed to watch this? I cant find it on daisuke

It's not on Daisuki, it was bundled with the 10th volume of the manga.

Not gonna lie that chopstick break was fantastic.  I saw that and I was like "WHOA, NO WAY, they totally did that!"
>> ARTICLE
do you know if the ova will be getting another release down the road, with higher quality ?
>> ARTICLE
Extremely disappointed they never showed any fights or progression of saitaman's fighting skill, the episode was a bit of a let down for me.
>> ARTICLE
How the fuck do I watch it?
>> ARTICLE
That was pretty good. the only problem was the length of the OVA. That was too short in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Take One Punch Man, remove all action, 95% of the comedy, and also 90% of the drama you usually find in it. Add a fishman in a gimp suit, and this is it. Totally forgettable. You can do better things with your time, including watching the show's [full OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOMpvUbhN88) by Jam Project 7 times, which takes a couple of minutes longer, and which I've done, and you'll get more out of it.

>> ARTICLE
When you can't do the hentai pun n English it loses the majority of the humor
>> ARTICLE
Gotta agree, it felt uninspired, really relying on the preexisting hype of the real series.
>> ARTICLE
I found the episode to be quite comedic (which is subjective of course), and felt that Saitama's character is better due to the backstory given by the episode. 
>> ARTICLE
is horriblesubs going to sub this?

HorribleSubs does not sub.

i just go to horriblesubs to get my shit and it wasnt out  
edit: tfw i have to watch some 480p stream like some fucking peasant

It's not going to be subbed anywhere because it's an OVA and not part of the actual licensed season, so Horriblesubs has nothing to steal. The same goes for all the future OPM OVAs.

Oh, what caused this to happen and how grand is it?

I won't really spoil the whole thing, but [let's just say] (/s "it involves Tatsumaki's sister, Fubuki.") And we'll leave it to that.
>> ARTICLE
I don't mind some spoilers, I cant wait that long. Also, is it a cool fight?
>> ARTICLE
And that's why there is the webcomic, where it is *LEAGUES* ahead of where the plot is at the manga. As for the fight, FUCK YEA it's awesome!! [Frickkin] (/s "Tatsumaki drags Saitama all around a bunch of cities, bringing down a gang and a giant monster down unintentionally. And after Tatsumaki tried flying him upwards and failing because he was heavy, she then splits open the ground and traps him inside.") And it's not even done yet!! So get to it.

[Spoilers](/s "Basically, Tatsumaki doesn't approve of who Fubuki is hanging out with so she goes to kick the shit out of Saitama. It's basically Tatsumaki going apeshit and Saitama waiting for her to finish up.")

Is Mob Psycho good? Have you seen/read it?

A lot of people seem to like it and it is getting an adaption. I've personally not read it, but I hear it's quite a bit different than OPM as far as quality is concerned (because OPM was ONE's quick, dirty, messy sketching).

thanks
>> ARTICLE
It's fantastic. Highly recommend reading it... in a little while. They're on what seems to be the final arc, so you'll end up with back-to-back cliffhangers if you catch up now.

I cracked up so hard when she just walked away without saying a word.
>> ARTICLE
i think i missed a joke. what was so special about it?
>> ARTICLE
Usually the waitress would respond cheerfully but her just pausing for a bit and then just walking away silently means she obviously thought Saitama was weird for just ordering a side of fries.

that behavior is preaty normal were i live (waitress)

Or you're just weird

She thought he was weird and pathetic for coming to a family restaurant alone, dressed in a funny outfit, and ordering the cheapest item.

And it's not even the main menu, it's a side menu.

So that's why people have confused faces when I order only French fries...

So there are going to be 6 OVAs, each 12 minutes long. That makes it equal to 3 episodes.

**WE'RE GETTING 3 MORE EPISODES OF OPM**

As for the OVA itself, it seems to be situated after the Mosquito lady fight and before Genos becomes the disciple. So 6 OVAs situated in between the episodes.

I hope we get one featuring Fubuki. Like 12 minutes of Fubuki and 12 minutes of Tatsumaki. That would be amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Since each Blu-Ray is 2 episodes and each one has an OVA, we can tentatively assume from this one that the OVAs take place after each Blu-Ray's events (1, 2, OVA 1, 3, 4, OVA 2, 5, 6, OVA 3, etc.)

This is the first OPM thread I came upon, so I'm asking here. Is it confirmed yet that the series will be continued? I just finished watching and I want more!
>> ARTICLE
At least the anime got 70% of the manga, and we are talking of 3 years of work, if they confirm it, it will be in 2017 at least
>> ARTICLE
Although there's plenty of webcomic available, Murata is pretty far behind with the manga. Since the anime artstyle is based off of Murata's drawings and goes to him for artistic direction, he has to catch up the manga before they can even start considering a 2nd season.
>> ARTICLE
I think a 2nd season could arrive in 2017 at the earliest. The first season adapted up to chapter 37 and the latest chapter is chapter 50 something (or 90 depending onyour website).
>> ARTICLE
I could definitely see a Fall 2017 announcement sometime next year.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks so much for the help!
>> ARTICLE
Murata did make a statement that he will work as hard as he can to make season2 happen.
>> ARTICLE
Plus Murata is pretty amazing at what he does. I ended up binge reading the manga after e12, and it's pretty much a low FPS version of the anime. The art is virtually identical, and it really makes the transition to the manga a great, and natural experience.
>> ARTICLE
One PPT Man
>> ARTICLE
even better at times imo 
>> ARTICLE
No, not in the slightest. Everyone wants it to be, staff and fans alike, but there's absolutely no confirmation of an S2. This is just one of several OVAs being released along with the Blu-Rays.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the help!
>> ARTICLE
Wait this is OVA #1? then what was the one about Saitama's suit posted 3 weeks ago?

That came bundled with the newest manga volume, it's not part of the upcoming ones. These are the OVAs included on the DVD/Blu-Ray releases (2 episodes and 1 OVA per disc for $50/70).

I'm not sure how it worked, but I saw it listed as OVA 0 on one of the websites

I love it when people represent animation quality with a still frame. It makes absolutely no sense, and I fucking love it.

The animation was pretty good and smooth in this OVA, i just thought this frame looked funny because Saitama looks weird.
>> ARTICLE
What I mean is a still frame is *art*, moving frames is *animation*. Some frames during an animation may look weird because they're not frames that people will see details in because of how fast they go by.

I hope this isn't gonna be a thing. You guys know these are transitive frames, right?

Aww, you can't watch it on daisuki? I was starting to really love that site...

Daisuki's only airing the show, the Road to Hero OVA came with the most recent manga volume and these shorter OVAs are Blu-Ray exclusives so they can't be streamed legally.

This was OK but I thought it lacked a certain something that the main series had. I felt the same way about the Road to Hero OVA. I'm glad they exist but they're kind of bland.
>> ARTICLE
These are practically SoL episodes. The main series had a pretty fast pacing, even for the comedy. These OVAs had been pretty chill.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. They're meant to flesh out the characters, show "behind the scenes" of what happened between the episodes and be more or less an insight into the characters' lives.

OPM is all you need

Hello,

1/10 needs to be longer.

Huh? I've been watching on Hulu.

Well, some of us are not so fortunate to live in the only region that isn't completely fucked by licensing.

The ED was very refreshing with Chibi versions of  saitama, Genos, Licenseless rider and best girl.

What's the name of the song that plays during Saitama's monologue at the end of the OVA?
>> ARTICLE
This was a'ight. I liked the ED.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so this is what Genos was doing before he asked directly to be Saitama's apprentice? Doesn't that not work out because he was being repaired in that time?

Have you seen how dumb genos can be when fighting? The poor doc probably has pre made spare parts to get it done faster

Great, now it's time for bed but I want french fries...
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait to get episodes with Tatsumaki and/or Fubuki. I didn't read webcomic nor manga so I am really excited to see more of Fubuki...
>> ARTICLE
oh yeah, and what did he mean when he said "it's time for the job again?" Did he go beat a monster or a criminal offscreen that we didn't see?
>> ARTICLE
ONE has said that Saitama takes real jobs every once in a while, such as being a convenience store clerk, then saves up the money and quits in order to fund his being a hero for a hobby
>> ARTICLE
This is before he registered with the Hero Association.
>> ARTICLE
I know, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't call fighting a monster that's destroying the city to be "the job" for a hobby hero, does it? And what did he mean if that wasn't it?
>> ARTICLE
I think he meant literally getting a job because he's broke.
>> ARTICLE
No, he doesn't get paid for fighting monsters at this point (apart from donations from thankful victims.) He literally meant that he needs to get a job because he's flat broke.
>> ARTICLE
Even when he's part of the Hero Association I don't think he calls fighting monsters/criminals his "job" as in occupation, I figured he meant "the job" just as in working to protect the city, if a monster was even what he was talking about, I just thought he was being figurative. It seemed like he just then noticed something and thought he had to get up to do something. 
>> ARTICLE
Heh, the ED looked very much like the [Gundam-san ED](https://youtu.be/4r6gEAvgw-s), though I guess the song itself is an traditional Japanese song.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry Saitama, you lost me when you said you did not like the short and crispy fries in favor of the long and soft fries.

Terrible taste. FRIES ARE FRIED AND MUST BE CRISPY.
>> ARTICLE
Crispy ones are dry and tasteless on the inside. Long soft ones are nice and flavorful.

This was a pre-screening, so maybe that was omitted intentionally?

Based Madhouse with that incredible animation. I enjoyed that dream a lot more than the manga.
>> ARTICLE
The animation in the dream fight...


Unbelievable
>> ARTICLE
That was like the climax of three movies put together in one. You could see as different animators did different scenes. My favorite was the part on the collapsed highway; the monsters look so 3D there. 
>> ARTICLE
If that was animation with crappy quality.. Holy shit, just imagine watching it in HD
>> ARTICLE
It's not about HD (resolution), it's about the framerate.  Imagine that animation with enough frames to be fluid!  Like, say, Cowboy Bebop or Madoka movie fights fluid!
>> ARTICLE
I just have my fingers crossed that Madhouse is going to pull the same shtick they have with their last few shows and just consistently up the ante at every turn.

I wonder if the mods will archive this thread or the inevitable one that will be posted when it is officially airing (I am guessing the latter.) Either way it is bizarre to me to see a thread like this one be made in the wake of a leak.
>> ARTICLE
In the wake of all previous leaks I remember there have been discussion threads.  
>> ARTICLE
afaik, discussion posts are allowed to be made as soon as there are subs because people will inevitably watch it and want to talk about it.

We could go ahead and make another post once it airs. I'd just delete this one and link it later.

Only half of the episode was aired on the version I saw

Yeah but next time put the Nico/prescreening tag in the title so to separate out from the official ep 1

It would be really weird for them to use this thread.

Firstly, it's impossible to view with subs through legal sources right now (and you aren't even allowed to post illegal sources here). Secondly, the only way to view it with fansubs is through a rip of the Nico stream, which will be in relatively low quality.  
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention the only subs available are incomplete and pieced together from the manga. For something like this this id rather just wait for an official release and view it in proper quality. 
>> ARTICLE
Is there a legal way to see it coming soon? Where would it be? Crunchyroll?
>> ARTICLE
Subs are out. Translations are mostly okay since the subbers took them straight from the manga.

Edit: So... the scene at 13:00-15:00 isn't subbed. Can any bilingual buddies lend a hand here?
>> ARTICLE
do you know why that bit isnt subbed?
>> ARTICLE
Nah, the subs are pretty shit. The first two minutes the subs had many mistakes, the rest of the episode was the same.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, not a translator, but you could probably just find that scene in the manga? No?
>> ARTICLE
The subbers grabbed their translations from the manga. That scene is anime original, so they didn't sub it. :/
>> ARTICLE
Ah my bad, haven't quite gotten around to watching yet. 
>> ARTICLE
I wrote up a translation of that section for you, but I'm no pro by any standards so just keep that in mind. The monster dude was annoying to translate because of whatever kinda accent he's got going on, and his sentences got cut in half by Saitama, but oh well. 

**Saitama:** "In the middle of the night there's no sign of any evil presence. Just the same as before I became a hero. Which means that I haven't managed to be at all helpful to society . I'm not particularly sad about that. But right now, I'm worried about something- that everyday my feelings are becoming more transparent. I've stopped being able to feel fear, nerves, joy and anger. In exchange for power , I wonder if I might have lost something important as a person?"

**I can hardly understand whatever monster dudes on about but here goes:** "Berry berry? If I've been seen then it can't be helped. I'm whatever my name is. I take apart cars" (here's where Saitama starts talking over him)

**Saitama:** " In the past during a fight all sorts of emotions surged through me. Fear, hurriedness, rage

**Monster dude:** "If you get in my way,  then I'll do something to that headlight of yours (referring to his bald head)."

**Saitama:** "But now, it just ends with one punch "

"I'll have egg on rice for dinner tonight."

"Returning to my home unscathed, the days spent washing these gloves. When I'm fighting monsters, my soul  just isn't conflicting with anything.  It's just that I'm being a hero as a hobby.  So really, as long as I can satisfy myself, that's good enough.

I feel like some of those lines were a part of the monologue he had at the beginning of [the next arc] (/s "The Mosquito Girl/Genos arc"). Maybe to speed up the progression of the story, but it may not be from that monologue. Guess we'll see by next month.

I'm wondering if they're gonna follow the "frame-by-frame" scenes Murata did.
>> ARTICLE
Those arent in the paperbacks.. The main reason why I wont buy the paperback Manga. . 
>> ARTICLE
Wait what? Is there a [edit: print] version with them? 
>> ARTICLE
Yes. The Manga that gets released every now and then has them. The ones in paperback dont.
>> ARTICLE
Meaning hardcover versions have them? 
>> ARTICLE
No. Iirc, Murata's bimonthly release is digital. So he can draw varying number of pages. That's why some chapters have 8 pages and there are also 50 pages in another, because there's no waste if it's digital. But in the volume release, it is printed so they have to cut down the "frame by frame" pages from the digital release in a single page. Some fanmade music videos has them.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly, yes. They replaced it with normal panels. I was surprised when I saw that too
>> ARTICLE
Only a few minor differences. It was pretty much a 1:1 adaption. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Murata is basically doing an anime storyboard with his version.
>> ARTICLE
The only things that were different were extra material that just made it better. They put a lot more details into the dream sequence, and it was a lot more fun that way. 
>> ARTICLE
Aside from the nice animation, I'm really looking forward to the sound design.  Just from this episode it sounds like it's gonna be pretty nice.  Saitama's zipper jingling, Genos' metal parts moving, etc. all show signs of some pretty good sound design.  Hopefully it's not just 1st episode production values, though.  I'm hoping for close to yozakura quartet levels of sound design.

In currently at the latest released chapter in Murata's version - any ideas on what chapter it is in one 's Manga? 
>> ARTICLE
ONE's version is the original, and is a looooong way ahead of Murata's. The current arc in Murata's version has already ended in ONE's.

ONE's version is really crappily drawn, although this is most likely intentional and the shitty art actually looks good sometimes. It just takes some getting used to, I suppose. Reading ONE's version will make you love Murata's version even more, although the original is amazing in itself.

Murata's version has some original filler though. For example, [latest Murata OPM spoilers](/s "Saitama doesn't join a martial arts tournament disguised as Charanko - the entire martial arts tournament thing doesn't happen iirc")

Edit: just realised I didn't answer the question. To be honest, I have no idea what chapter it's on right now. (Definitely past 100 though)

I was wondering why there wasn't any subs for the first minute of the second half, til I realized that it's just subbing the manga material parts. Though I do question why it also subbed the anime original scenes for the manga material.

Fuck it, I don't mind it for now because it's Onepunch-Man, and this episode made me squeal like a little fangirl. You cannot fathom how much I was reacting like on the first minute and so on. I was fanboying so much, that I actually used the word "fathom" on a sentence, and I'm not the type that uses serious words like that.

Thanks to this episode preview, I don't need to feel that excited for it to officially come out, since I have now seen it beforehand (although, that doesn't mean I won't be fanboying for it like crazy in the end.)

Vaccine Man is a seriously drawn version of Bacteria Man from Anpan Man (Saitama's costume is also based on the one worn by Anpan Man). They also got Bacteria Man's VA to voice the character.

I rest i dunno....a lot of people have accused Beefcake of being based a mixture of the Colossal and Armored Titans, but that chapter in the original (which has the same design for Beefcake) predates AoT's manga entirely by a month or two.

The mole men look the same as the ones described in the Journey to the Center of the earth, the novel.

Wow, so many shots looked straight out of TTGL. Does anyone know if there's some staffing cross-over between Madhouse and Gainax/Trigger, or something else going on maybe?

I think there where an animator that have worked on TTGL who are also working on OPM.

If that was true and if we get to the [](/s "Boros' Arc"). Then we would have an anime to surpass TTGL.

Well, if nothing else, i think everyone else has had time to study TTGL and stuff so they can probably copy it.

I read volumes 1 and 2 today so this is interesting to watch, but I'm mostly seeing what I just read and a bit of the episode isn't subbed yet. I still liked it and the dream fight still pumped me up despite the fact the I've seen it a promo video before. I can't wait for the next episode, but first I have to wait for the first episode to be released for real, but it will be higher quality.

Everyone is.

The people who subbed it don't actually know Japanese, they just copied from the manga translations.

where does one see the episode i cant seem to find it anywhere

It was okay. They added a little too much animation at points which threw off the comedic timing. Also the animation during the major parts like the giant and the dream fight was way too mushy.

Subs are bad, but the music was fantastic. Looking forward to seeing this animated. The manga is a hella fun read.
>> ARTICLE
Even with the shitty quality that made my eyes bleed a little... that was still awesome.

Every time I watch something by Madhouse it makes me wish they could have done Tokyo Ghoul lol :(


>> ARTICLE
Seeing as this series is going to be as about as enjoyable and budget as anime can get, I think I'll wait for a better release.
>> ARTICLE
Shame you got down voted here, it was just unfortunate wording. Yeah the sub's are unofficial and a bit awkward so it would t be bad to wait, I'll probably watch both.

What are you talking about?

The animation was superb!
>> ARTICLE
Budget in the "Kyoani budget" or "ufotable budget" sense, I presume. 

People be changin' the meaning of words now. 
>> ARTICLE
The way he wrote that makes it seem like it's a bad show. Both in the animation and enjoyment apartment.

What he (probably) meant is that he's waiting for a better quality video with subs, since it would be a shame to watch something with such a high budget in low quality.

Right?
>> ARTICLE
Well, in the context of anime, "quality" = bad quality, and recently "budget" = high budget (at least here on Reddit).

Nobody gets confused when people refer to QUALITY, at least.

Oh shit, so many down votes! I generally thought a 'budget' something implied it was amazing. I guess that's just an /a/ thing? I've only recently started posting here.

Really liked this episode. The parody/deconstruction elements are excelent. Saitama's jaded way of looking at things is very interesting. I haven't read the manga so I'm not sure how the anime goes on but the first episode was great both in terms of the content as well as the presentation.
>> ARTICLE
Oh christ the deconstruction blog posts are already starting I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Not really sure what you mean. I'm just talking about how it takes the standard shounen trope of "being the strongest in the world" and applies it to a more realistic setting, where being the strongest in the world would be quite boring since you no longer have any challenges to face.
>> ARTICLE
>I'm just talking about how it takes the standard shounen trope of "being the strongest in the world" and applies it to a more realistic setting

1) You can't seriously call this setting "realistic".

2) The point of "genre deconstruction" (as it is understood among anime/manga fans) is to make a critique. 

OPM is not deconstructing anything. It is not really exposing how stupid the genre is. On the contrary, it's revalidating the genre's worth by following the rules and making it more interesting for once. They just took the well known "monster of the week agains hero" setting and put an overwhelmingly overpowered protagonist into it.
>> ARTICLE
> You can't seriously call this setting "realistic".

I didn't. I said more realistic, as in "more realistic than the standard shounen".

> OPM is not deconstructing anything. It is not really exposing how stupid the genre is.

I think you are assuming that a critique is inherently negative which is not the case.

>> ARTICLE
>"more realistic than the standard shounen".

The world and the people in it should behave realistically because it helps to expose flaws in the tropes that are getting "deconstructed". That does not happen in OPM. 

>I think you are assuming that a critique is inherently negative

I'm not assuming, in the case of -what we undestand as- "genre deconstructions" the critique is negative. "This is wrong", "This is silly", "It should be more like this". That's the kind of message you get from a genre deconstruction. And succesful ones spawn works that follow those new ideas.

OPM feels more like a very modern take on the genre (Murata's manga in particular having very innovative composition). But it's absolutely not a genre deconstruction.



PD: If you want a genre deconstruction, Zetman (the manga) fits the description better. How the Hero is born. How the monster of the week setting gets established.... Zetman does these more realistically.
>> ARTICLE
1. Stop being so defensive. You'll end up becoming a shield.  
2. Do you even latin? de- + construction, to analyse the elements of construction so that it can be made again, without destroying it.
>> ARTICLE
1. Don't patronize me.
2. Reconstruction is also on the TVTropes page and I'm aware of it. Madoka could be considered a Dereconstruction. I'm not bringing it up because OP was arguing that OPM was a deconstruction. Also, we can have a conversation without abusing these buzzwords.
>> ARTICLE
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreDeconstruction

Edit: Nanoha and Madoka both have deconstruction elements but at no point they go "Yeah, magical girls are dumb and shouldn't exists". If anything they have both changed and renewed the magical girl genre and inspired works that have moved the magical girl genre from it's original shoujo demographic to a seinen one, like symphogear and Yuuki Yuuna.
>> ARTICLE
To your edit: The point of the negative critique is to say "this stuff can be done better", not that they shouldn't exist (don't put words on my mouth). 

It's widely known how Madoka did not go all the way with the genre deconstruction, and many hardcore Mahou Shoujo fans were dissapointed by that. But still, many tropes did get critiqued and new works spawned from those lessons. 

Also, genre deconstruction is not the only way to make a genre critique and inspire creators. OPM is doing a lot of stuff right and I'm sure it'll be inspiring for many, but that doesn't define it as a genre deconstruction.
>> ARTICLE
>  It's widely known how Madoka did not go all the way with the genre deconstruction, and many hardcore Mahou Shoujo fans were dissapointed by this. But many tropes did get critiqued and new works spawned from those lessons. That doesn't mean that stuff like Precure will stop getting aired.

I was prefectly fine with the amount of critique Madoka had, I also have no problem with the standard mahou shoujo stuff existing at all... I honestly don't see why it should stop existing at all.

> OPM is doing a lot of stuff right and I'm sure it'll be inspiring for many, but that doesn't define it as a genre deconstruction.

I've only seen one episode so far and pointed out it had some deconstruction elements to it. I never said it was a full analitical deconstruction of the battle shounen genre

>> ARTICLE
> I honestly don't see why it should stop existing at all.

Again.

>The point of the negative critique is to say "this stuff can be done better", not that they shouldn't exist (don't put words on my mouth). 

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, read it.

>Merely making a genre Darker and Edgier is not the same as deconstructing it. To deconstruct a genre, the essential elements of the genre must be clearly demonstrated and taken to their **most logical conclusions, and this causality must be plausible.**
>> ARTICLE
"most logical conclusions"

I think that "being the strongest guy in the world would make it so you don't have any challenges left" is a very logical conclusion.
>> ARTICLE
I agree but why are you stopping there? I'm sure there would be more to it.

Think about it dude: What if tomorrow, the strongest guy in the world appeared on TV? What would happen to him? How would the government react? 

It wouldn't be realistic that the only consequence of his existence to be his personal apathy. That's not a trope deconstruction nor anything, that's just a GAG that's funny.
>> ARTICLE
try writing a story that ends like this. "the hero beats the baddie with one punch." multiple arcs. it takes a lot of effort to keep the story interesting. there's 100 odd chapters so far. read em and you'll understand why it's good.

it's more of a gag manga instead of a typical shounen

I just wanna talk about Saitama punching people dawg.
>> ARTICLE
It appears that you've read the manga so could you answer a question about it? I liked the first episode and I thought it was pretty funny but I'm concerned that this could turn into a "bad guy of the week" show and I suspect that could get old after a few episodes. I've heard people mention arcs, so are there actually underlying plotlines, or is it just the same "evil guy that looks badass gets his ass kicked by Saitama who doesn't take him seriously, comedy ensues" repeated over and over?
>> ARTICLE
The series is less about Saitama and more about the world around him.
>> ARTICLE
Nah the story focuses on many different heroes in an interesting world. The most recent big arc didn't even have that much Saitama in it until the final fight.

The first few episodes might be a TAD monster of the week, but it'll pick up really shortly after.
>> ARTICLE
Saitama's involvement in the most recent arc mostly boiled down to (light spoilers?) him walking around aimlessly trying to get someone to listen to him complaining about his broken microwave... and stuff...

You don't just go around breaking a dude's stuff though, that's not cool at all.

Episode 18 iirc, when [Garo]( /s "Leon and Alfonso fight over who will wield Garo.")

Thanks I'll check it out. 

Is that episode the pinnacle of the anime's animation?

It's the single most concentrated moment of sakuga I think, but the finale is also pretty intense. It's just this scene in particular lacks the CGI that's in pretty much every other fight scene, so the animation has a better chance to shine. (And it really is a very impressive sequence.)

What's the difference? It's not like you won't be pirating that as well. Just watch it again when it's out in better quality.
>> ARTICLE
It's because I feel we won't have a proper discussion since not everybody will be watching the live streamed version.
>> ARTICLE
Very torn on this. It's not that I didn't like it but I excepted a lot more in terms of drawing and quality.  What I saw was some really standard anime drawing, god eater feels more unique then this.  

Still I will reserve my judgment till later, I want to see what else they can do. 
>> ARTICLE
feel the same, it remind me gurren lagan's animation, and knowing that ttgl come out at 2007....i suppose i expect more for a big anime like OPM made by a big company like Madhouse, at least be a better animation than a 2007's show, its not bad by any means, but feels standard
>> ARTICLE
I agree.
>> ARTICLE
For an example:

Look at the animation at roughly 17:44 to 17:54 (at least in my version. This is the scene on top of the collapsed overpass section before he gets knocked away down the length of the highway); that sequence is insanely well animated. The monsters look really 'solid' with very consistent perspective and realistic shading. There are even details like one of the monsters grabbing and ripping his shirt off in a very realistic way.

That's some seriously good animation that you're overlooking.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, like you have said, it is only a 10 seconds scene, and yeah it is pretty amazing (far from the best scene that i saw in my life, but still amazing) the problems is 1 inconsinstency which is somethig that i dislike because pull me of the anime that i'm watching and makes difficult to me to immerse into it and 2 if u make a show where the 80-90% of the animation is standar with few moments with a pretty good animation, the animation of that show will still be standard. An i want to point out a thing that i thing is important to remark, standard or a bit above of standard doesn't mean bat by any means, but is not "oh my god, that animation"
>> ARTICLE
The tough part here is that for this show, there has to be a quality quantity tradeoff and they did a bang up job. Not crazy smooth, but really evocative. 

Furthermore, in terms of the expressiveness of the animation it was overall excellent. It's not like every character has to be on model and sharply defined for every single frame, that leads to kinda sterile action scenes. 

The scene with the giant used a sketch style to get across the blind rage as he lamented killing his brother. The dream sequence was amazing for the feeling of the power of the monsters involved, and the tension and danger that Saitama felt. 

Maybe in terms of pure animation it wasn't perfect, but the direction was outstanding. Music, acting, and the animation together brought this great feeling to the show, far more than most anime manage. 
>> ARTICLE
The anime promises great things,I like the parody part and the feelings it generates when the guy wakes up.But honestly,the drawing level peaks from best to worst within seconds!Let me give you an example.In one moment it reminds me of how one piece was in its early ,glorious days.Well polished hits,great lighting,great facial expressions.But the next moment I see leg and arm stretches that look like the horrible drawing from naruto (8 tails) vs pain fight.
>> ARTICLE
the animation reminded me gurren lagan animation, and i don't know how to feel abou that, is not an animation style that i like at all, and gurren lagan aired in 2007, maybe is an early version and the final version will be more....consisten. its not bad, but i just dont feel like an amazing animation like everyone is saying
>> ARTICLE
meh i think the author has no clue how to continue the manga anymore. he still hasnt explained how he got his powers
>> ARTICLE
This didn't impress me at all. The animation was ok, but for the rest it was just mindless.
>> ARTICLE
what the hell. literally just got trolled by genos for the whole episode.. 
>> ARTICLE
They had to preserve their remaining budget, so they resorted to making Genos use Talk No Jutsu for the entire episode.
>> ARTICLE
I see... Sasuga Saitama sensei.

In giving the errands to Genos, Saitama was actually training him in Time Management. But since he's a superhero, he had to visit 2 spots in a small amount of time. In addition, since we never know what the world throws at us, some villains showed up to act as a hindrance and further stretch out the time.

Hmmm, very nice training. Saitama sure knows how to train.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like Genos has a reddit account. 
>> ARTICLE
Why is a guy with a robot body taking a bath in the first place is what i want to know.
>> ARTICLE
He's just there for Saitama. He would get a foot massage if it meant he could be closer to him.

Why Saitama thought Genos would get a cold is beyond me.
>> ARTICLE
If even Saitama-sensei can get cold, Genos doesn't have a chance.
>> ARTICLE
The dreaded Japanese Cold. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm fairly confident that was Saitama's way of telling Genos to go away and hoping he wouldn't question it.

It feels good

>> ARTICLE
It's because of the placement of the tongue in the mouth. Sounds like Ahh or Uhh are closer to the bottom while stuff like Ii is higher up. So it becomes Ahh because it's the path of least resistance.
>> ARTICLE
Genos is surprisingly strict with his music. 
>> ARTICLE
Hence the ED
>> ARTICLE
That ED, though. I guess he was serious about his ear for music. But for real though, Genos has some fuckin' pipes on him.
>> ARTICLE
I can't be the only one who was making those weird noises at the beginning of this. Can confirm that ahhh feels the best. 

And the quality difference between these OVAs and the series is insane. 
>> ARTICLE
>  Can confirm that ahhh feels the best.

Come on, why would you want to inhale even the slightest bit of air to perform the 'ahh' sound? The best sounds clearly start with fuuu or uuu gradully building into a more 'a' or 'i' sound like uuuuuuuwhaaaaa for optimal relaxation. It's almost like a relaxing growl, *uuuuuuuuuuuhwhaaaaaaaaa* before you slink into the abyss of the warm tub.
>> ARTICLE
Having not watched them yet, worse or better?
>> ARTICLE
None of the OVAs have been very good so far imo. They're pretty boring / not funny.
>> ARTICLE
Worse. Though can't really fault animators for OVAs imo.
>> ARTICLE
In fairness it would be really hard to top the original episodes without some major action. The OVAs are still making me smile and chuckle which to me is all they need to do in their short form.

Also ED might be a contestant for ED of the season so far
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. As long as the comedy is retained I'll definitely watch them.

You know with the amount of OVA's they're releasing might as well call it a "second first season".
>> ARTICLE
Well each episode is of only 10 mins or so. 6 epsiodes equal to one hour i.e. Two more episodes. I don't think two episodes count as a whole season.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't think two episodes count as a whole season

If No Game No Life got two more EP's worth of *anything* I'd probably call it a second season. Or, at least *part* of a second season.

It's just OPM has hit unprecedented levels of popularity, so it gets the spoils.
>> ARTICLE
No Game No Life did have those 6 3-minute shorts that fit between the episodes. Would you consider those a season?
>> ARTICLE
its not ie its MIIIII
>> ARTICLE
An average episode is 24 mins minus 2 mins OP and 2 mins ED. So 20 minutes per regular episode, 3 episodes in an hour. Still not enough to count as a whole season though.

The Bathroom scene was the best!

looks like we got the winner of 2016

Was rather sad that it's only 10 mins but it's better than nothing

That wasn't as good as the first one or the series, but it wasn't that bad. Hopefully the rest focus more on the side characters instead of Saitama/Genos.

OVA2? Wouldn't this be Special 2 or OVA 3?

I preferred the OVA and the first Special. In this one, a lot of the jokes missed their mark, and it seemed mostly like Fujoshi bait.

As someone who's not following the series, I can only really assume that One Punch Man is some sort of anime Jesus at this point. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a solid anime.

The characters are likable, so the main story point you look forward to is just seeing more of them, the animation is on point because the team in charge of it heavily enjoys working on it, it's funny and has superheroes.

Any young boy would love the shit out of it. Manchilds alike.
>> ARTICLE
I checked it out recently. It's certainly entertaining, but I do feel that it's overhyped.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean. They all can't defeat the bad then he comes in and saves the day without any effort. It'll get boring if they don't change that approach.
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing. It doesn't get boring. At least not yet and I'm caught up with the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but I really feel like the scene you described is the backdrop to the story of Saitama trying to find a reason to live, in that nothing makes him feel alive anymore.  The struggle isn't against the monsters for him the struggle is in himself.
>> ARTICLE
That's because a lot of the hype is from people that know what's going to happen in the future. 
>> ARTICLE
As someone who has followed the series for a while, I feel like it is appropriately hyped.
>> ARTICLE
I would agree if it hasn't aired yet.

BUT we are 8 episodes in man. People are hyped according to what the show delivered. Therefore it earned its hype completely.
>> ARTICLE
The problem isn't the hype, but the people who usually can't put out their opinion beyond  'it's great' or 'it's amazing'. So it's not very convincing to those who hasn't seen it yet or just don't feel the same way about it. :p

Everytime you think a show is overhyped, go to /a/ in 4chan.

They'll find a way to shit on everything.

It's a breakout from the hivemind alright.

But the hivemind is to hate everything. It's just different, still the hivemind though.

Not knowing "the score" of a comment is a lot better though

 Reddit self censors conflicting opinions based on popularity which makes discussions where one part doesn't like what everyone else does really stupid. This doesn't really happen on 4 chan, but you also have to wade through all the supershitty comments.

Advantages and disadvantages.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much everything is overrated because there will always be people worshipping certain shows. OPM is simple and that's fun for lots of people.
>> ARTICLE
I went in expecting to dislike OPM. I was only going to watch it because I knew it was gonna be the thing everyone's talking about, but I'm enjoying it a lot. It's really easy to watch, which I like, and of course it looks great. Sure, it's not anything mind blowing, but it isn't trying to be. It's just trying to be fun, and dammit if I don't have fun during every episode.
>> ARTICLE
Its so big, i keep seeing references everywhere on reddit. Just came back from askreddit and theres a OPM reference.

Which thread??

If you've ever watched or lined shonen, you'll love it. It's amazing and hilarious and gets better every episode so far. He's the ultimate super hero and they take  it to comedic levels.

I used to love anime as a kid and young teen. I thought I had outgrown anime, but One Punch Man has pulled me right back in. It's amazing. I do recommend waiting until the season is out though. I regret starting in the middle of the season, as waiting a week for a 22 minute episode is just terrible. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah I got into the hype train real early and ahve been enduring the wait since episode 1
>> ARTICLE
Active anime hype. People said the same thing about Kill La Kill, Akame Ga Kill, and pretty much every action anime over the past 3 years.

Turns out action anime is fun, no matter what year its from. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah thats bullshit and im tired of it, yes there were hype for all animes you said and i really like them but at the end of them i fell like "hey that was a great anime" and yes OPM is included

BUT the diference is that I am enjoying every moment of OnePunch man EVERY SINGLE  ONE and I FEEL the diference between a GOOD anime that i like and a MASTERPIECE that i love, so even knowing i have my expextations to high on OPM (didnt read the manga) im just tired of the bullshit and people like you saying " it just hype"

Nah dude fuck you and your "is just hype" attitude, OPM is amazing i can say it a lot of times i want to, and im glad OP did this post because i agree with him

Damn i also dislike the hype trains and people who likes animes blindisly but i really reallly like OPM


>> ARTICLE
There are plenty of anime that are a lot better than One Punch Man. There's nothing so special about One Punch Man that it deserves all this attention.
>> ARTICLE
The massive attention comes from the fact that it's likable to a very large audience, don't get me wrong the show is great - it's actually an amazing battle shounen but it's biggest strength is that it's very hard to dislike it, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.

It's just fun for everyone.
>> ARTICLE
You're free to like it. But nobody should judge an anime objectively as 'the best anime ever' until its been out long enough to get some context. OPM is still running. 

I love SAO, when it runs its great. But when I take a step back and look at it in context? Hell no is it nowhere near the 'best anime ever'. 
>> ARTICLE
And thats because SAO will never be considered great it was ok at the most. Went from something interesting to another harem waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
He never said it was the best anime ever, just that the hype is justified. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it isn't the best anime ever until next episode. That's when it becomes the best.
>> ARTICLE
The thing is that all they have to do is keep up some semblance of the current level of animation quality and stick to the script the manga has laid out.

We already knew [the manga was the bees knees.](http://myanimelist.net/manga/44347/One_Punch-Man) Which in turn mostly follows ONE's original comic. There's One Punch Man to spare and honestly if the anime follows the manga, what you've seen so far is arguably the weakest part of the show.

Or, at least, I didn't think the manga kicked off until the heroes association entered the picture, and I thought that  
>Sea King Arc < Boros Arc < Garou Arc

I'm not going to necessarily say OPM is the best anime ever, but I'm pretty doubtful it's going to get worse, not when the manga which they're sticking pretty tight to only got better.
>> ARTICLE
The hype is beyond anything those 2 anime had though. IIRC a OPM discussion thread is the highest upvoted thread on /r/anime ever.

1st ep discussion hit /r/all with like 7000 upvotes

Enjoy shounen but have grown up to look past things like dragon ball?

I don't actually like battle shonen per se, my main complaint with it is that I would like to see some sick battles but they end up looking cheap, and there's too much talking without any point to fill space. 

OPM has neither of these issues and is my anime of the year.
>> ARTICLE
I have never enjoyed that much shounen, and I'm pretty skeptical of any "action-anime" cause long action scenes are usually boring for me. I'm one of those people who enjoy a good slice of life more than the average people. I didn't have a change to watch dragonball as a kid, and when I tried as a teenager I couldn't get in to it, even less now as an adult. One punch man still blew my mind, and I its the anime I have enjoyed the most in many years. It fills me up with anticipation and I can't wait until next week.  It has made me re-evaluate my stands on action anime. Maybe i shouldn't be so scared of them.

Yeah I'm the type of person who only watches shows once they've finished airing and at this point if OPM is not an 11/10 I'll feel ripped off.

You'll be sorely disappointed.  It is good but it is not the 11/10 you seek.  Read the manga, not the webcomic, for an idea of what to expect, instead.  Don't let hype let you down, you'll only ruin your own experience.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the manga is significantly better than the anime, and the anime is pretty great. 
>> ARTICLE
so far they have been near identical?
>> ARTICLE
The stories are mostly the same, but the manga has much better execution and pacing (Saitama vs Sonic is more energetic in the manga, Genos' backstory dump, the leadup to the Saitama vs Carnage Kabuto is better-paced, Metal Knight's arrival is _gorgeously animated_ in the manga).

these were consecutive pages in the manga. Literally higher quality than the counterpart in the anime. Im not ragging on the anime, but the statement that the manga is better animated in parts is actually totally true

edit: http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/e66253b77379c92527e254c294e244c71362610434_full.gif

this one too
>> ARTICLE
Why would you say it's better?
>> ARTICLE
Each scene is drawn in much higher-quality, the art makes it very easy to follow the fights anyways and the "animated scenes" in the manga's web-version are much smoother (webms of them and anime/manga comparisons are available in the discussion threads here.)

The anime's a good anime by itself, but merely a good adaptation of an excellent source.
>> ARTICLE
Can only agree. I hear people giving so much credit to Madhouse, and yes they did a great job. But most of the credit should really go to ONE for the comedy and pacing and to Murata for the art.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, unfortunately Madhouse does not have an infinite animation budget like we would like them to have.
>> ARTICLE
Sunrise does, but they dont do anything out of mecha.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama is not mecha
>> ARTICLE
I actually feel that one of the reasons why it's so popular is because it has managed to get the attention of people who haven't watched anime before. I was surprised when quite a few of my non-anime watching friends started watching OPM. When I asked them why they started watching it, they simply said it was because it looked really cool. Even without getting any of the references, it's still nice to watch it superficially just for the sheer badassery.
>> ARTICLE
It puts enough of a spin on the formula and poking fun at it without totally denouncing it. I still don't look past battle shonens like Dragonball, but I think people who were a bit out of the loop with battle shonen or has grown a bit jaded can really appreciate the angle of attack OPM comes from, as a parody.
>> ARTICLE
What's funny to me is that Dragon Ball started out with a very similar premise. Here's this guy who looks weak but is actually so incredibly strong he takes out any buff guy with ease. Also when it came out DB was a pure comedy series as well.
>> ARTICLE
The thing with OnePunchMan is that it knows what it wants to be, IT has an identity and doesn't try to force japanese popculture. You see alot of manga like fairytail they try to do a little bit of everything and you can't really feel where the story is going.

With OPM, you can see what it's about, a hero who is op and is somewhat awkward in social situations. thats what sells it, he's hilarious without trying.
>> ARTICLE
I don't wanna be that guy but Madhouse ain't doing much since 90% of the people working on opm are freelancers. Same thing that happened with space dandy.
>> ARTICLE
Why doesn't Madhouse just hire them? Genuine question, I don't know how the dealings of anime productions work.
>> ARTICLE
It's literally the industry's dream team. There's not enough money to keep them around.
>> ARTICLE
The people working on OPM are the industries greatest talents they are always busy working on something or for one company or for another.
>> ARTICLE
$ (or, in this case, )
>> ARTICLE
Didn't Space Dandy get a season 2?
>> ARTICLE
Yup.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, and it was even more amazing than the first.
>> ARTICLE
One could say it's also a bit of Madhouse's model for animation too. They have a similar setup for many of their shows (namely the huge list of outside companies in the credits as well as Korean names). That being said, a buttload of producer companies have helped Madhouse fund this show  too. So they have even more outside animation company help working on it at the same time. So they probably allowed more time for animators to work their magic.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you. I've reached the point of not giving a flying fuck over the naysayers that will go "it's good if you're into the genre" (well no shit, that's like telling me that the best meat in the world is only good if you like eating meat), that "it's overrated" and all that usual connoisseur shitting that basically comes from people who are underachievers and attempt to identify their self-value from their ability to relate emotionally with shows.

No, you're distorting what I'm saying.

I have ZERO issues with people who love/hate a show. I have issues with people who hate a show and go around shitting on people who like it, calling them out for their taste.
>> ARTICLE
But neither of the things you said are that:

"it's good if you're into the genre" is a valid statement, since there are plenty of shows that are good even if you are not into that genre ( for example, FMA:B is an excelent show even if you are not into shounen, or Bebop being an excelent show even if you are not into sci-fi ), and likewise, the statement can also mean that you need knowldge of that genre ( i.e.: "being into it" ) to understand some things about it. For example if I wasn't into super heroes, OPM may not be a very interesting show for me.

Likewise "overrated" is also a pretty valid assesment if used in context of a rating sistem like MAL since rating do imply a certain degree of quality so a show with a high rating is "better" than a show with low rating. And so, if a show is critically bad but very popular it can end up as an overrated show, with shows like SAO being a classic example of this ( granted it's raiting has been decreasing slowly but that's another subject ). This topic would be pretty long to discuss tho so I wont.

I get it that you are an OPM fan ( with that name and all ) but no need to be so aggressive about it. Just because you like something doesn't mean it can't be criticized.

Edit: Speaking of overrated, I remember OPM being on MAL's top...lets say 30 ( I don't remember that well ) two months before the anime was released ( this has happened with lots of manga adaptation so it's not only OPM either ). In that case I don't think anyone could disagree that OPM was overrated since it was an anime that didn't even exist, but was still rated higher than stuff that did exist.

EditII: My three favorite shows are Gintama, LoGH and Mushishi and because I've seen those shows many, many times and I love them I have no problems with people critizicing them because in the end doubt anyone could ever find more flaws on them than I do.

Yes, you are being harassed when you say that One Punch Man is literally the greatest cultural achievement in mankind's history and we tell you it's not. You are being "harassed" when some guy posts an incoherent and pointless rant of fanboyism for OPM, a shitpost that should've been removed for low effort, and it gets 1000 upvotes from people who just blindly click the up arrow every time they see "One Punch Man" in a title.

I honestly feel like you guys are harassing me a lot more than the other way around. I am being harassed for failing to be uniform in onion with the hive mind.
>> ARTICLE
I don't get why everyone is so against other people enjoying it. Like there's literally a comment in here saying "Is a good show but relax man." as if he shouldnt be allowed to enjoy it as much as he is. /r/anime seems to have this thing for OPM especially, and any show that gets hyped up a lot with the exception of a couple of shows like HxH, Shirobako, or FMA:B.
>> ARTICLE
I think it sort of applies to shows like HxH and FMA:B (even Code Geass). A better example would be shows like Madoka Magica, Evangelion or Spice and Wolf. Go to any discussion thread for Spice and Wolf for example, the fans there honestly aren't very different from fans of SAO for example, except nobody tells you to calm down when you show your enjoyment for Spice and Wolf because it's "objectively good" or something snobby like that.
>> ARTICLE
No one tells you to calm down when you show your enjoyment for spice and wolf because everyone who has seen spice and wolf knows how great Holo is!

In all seriousness though, if a post about someone enjoying spice and wolf made it to the front page with this many upvotes, I garentee there would be people telling OP to calm down.

Totally have to agree with you. I've got those same vibes. 

I'm just sick of seeing people playing the "overhyped" card every single time. I mean hey I would agree if the show hasn't aired yet. People are often rash about that.

BUT the thing is we are 8 episodes in. People are hyping according to what they saw and what the anime delivered so far. I think the show earned its hype in a legit way with that.
>> ARTICLE
Anime Hipsters are a thing you know

Can't blame them for liking something that earned its popularity.

One punch man is a bad example since its pretty damn quality in most fields

NGNL is a perfect example of wars between Rabid fans and hipsters

Thats what I'm saying. It makes its hype reasonable. An exception but it happens :D

Oh yeah O.o

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed NGNL but I don't pretend it was the masterpiece others do

Same her man. For me OPM is the rare exception. Got hype even before it aired which is usually but it keeps it throughout the series.

I should probably watch One Punch Man.

TTGL is quite literally the fuel for my soul and spirit right now.

Every single time I even have the small wavering in doubts in pursuing my dream I just recite to myself in my mind the following lines:

**Your drill is the drill that will pierce the heavens! Even if there is a wall in the way you just keep digging...if you dig through then IT'S YOUR VICTORY!! Little by little we inch forward, evolving past the person we were a minute before, that's how a drill works!! My drill is the drill that creates the heavens!**

**WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!!??**

...and then after all that getting back to work becomes a cakewalk.

Also I should probably watch One Punch Man too.

Knowing someday you may be able to be as strong as Saitama... it fills you with determination.

Goddamn, so much negativity in this thread. I completely understand what you're experiencing. I've seen so many animes that are praised to death on here and walked away from them underwhelmed. One-Punch Man is *exactly* the anime I've always wanted. Anime hardly ever makes me laugh or gets me pumped up. I'm blown away by how often both happen when I'm watching. It's so. Goddamn. Fun.

If after 8 episodes in people are still hyped about the next one then that says a lot. It's not like being hyped for a show that hasn't released which later turned out to be disappointing.

I can't even remember how many years it's been since I've actually been waiting for the next episode of something.

So far i have to agree OPM is a rare anime or show in general. There arent very many shows that put in that level of care and detail in to each and every eps. Game of thrones and the first season of  true detective is the only other shows that comes to mind that fit in that same criteria. 
>> ARTICLE
Go watch The Wire.
>> ARTICLE
>Game of Thrones

>True Detective

>Only other shows that fit that criteria

>> ARTICLE
I am literally cringing right now. Comparing OPM to the first season of True Detective is just.. ugh.

EDIT: Err, are people upvoting this because they actually think I'm saying OPM is better? ._____.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen true detective , are you saying it's better than OPM or worse ? =/ 
>> ARTICLE
I'm saying OPM doesn't even compare to True Detective. Like, at all. True Detective's first season was a goddamn masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
And OPM is even better.
>> ARTICLE
You have got to be fucking kidding me.
>> ARTICLE
To each his taste i guess.
>> ARTICLE
We're talking objectivity here, not subjectivity.
>> ARTICLE
Whilst you can try to be objective about it show it will ultimately be subjective. True detective isn't meant to be a 'fun' show. 

I don't think I'd rewatch true detective again any time soon, but I would OPM. So which should I consider to be 'better'. 

I recognise The Wire as technically one of the best TV shows ever made yet I'd rather watch Lost again over it because I really like the characters. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't enjoy true detective as much as I enjoyed OPM, Mr.Robot or game of thrones. Thats how i rate the things I watch, by how much I enjoyed them.
>> ARTICLE
Don't bother man this is the anime subreddit after all

Some here probably think fucking K-on is better than GoT or TD S1
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I've given up trying to prove my point. 
>> ARTICLE
True Detective was really good, but it did kind of falter a little bit plotwise near the end. Namely on the true nature of the criminal organization they were taking down not really being touched upon. Though I suppose they were doing that for the sake of mystery too. 

I kind of put Breaking Bad a notch higher as far as crime dramas go in being able to wrap it up in a pretty package. All great shows though. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's also my main gripe with True Detective. Hell, even Breaking Bad had a weak link for me that was its second season, and it still managed to pull it off as a season decently. 

And yes, Breaking Bad will forever be the pinnacle of crime dramas for years to come.
>> ARTICLE
Better Call Saul started out rocking with 5 or so excellent episodes and then some really weak episodes to finish it. I hope it continues/ends strongly too. BCS feels like a direct continuation (well, a prequel) to Breaking Bad.

They are two completely different things. Lol what?

Apparently, comment thread OP doesn't think so. I am only responding to that.

>> ARTICLE
People like to pull this one out whenever an opinion they like comparing an anime to a Western Show gets disagreed with.

Like a week or two back there was a thread about how OPM had a higher IMDB rating than Band of Brothers.

"OPM is better than BoB!"

"No, it isn't, BoB is deep with tons of character development, very good action, and is much more emotionally moving than OPM can ever hope to be.  I love OPM but it simply isn't better than BoB."

"Well, you can't really compare them"

"Oh, *now* we can't compare them, can we?  Is that how this works?  You don't seem to mind people who think OPM is better comparing them, but you're running around and posting that you can't compare them as a reply to every person who disagrees."
>> ARTICLE
Too bad the second season went downhill fast. 
>> ARTICLE
Ugh. Please don't remind me it exists.. ;____;
>> ARTICLE
It was a bit of a mess, but it had some amazing character building. It's rare that a show can be that convoluted and still pack an emotional punch in the last episode like season 2 did. 
>> ARTICLE
lol you need to watch more anime AND more tv shows if you think that

And I'm not sure I would put OPM alongside True Detective S1 and GoT.
Its a fun show but thats about it

This and noragami has ignited my love for animes

How is 2nd season og Noragami so far? Haven't gotten around to watching it yet.
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul and Fate/Zero just ignited mine last week :)
>> ARTICLE
Is Fate/Zero good ? I pretty much need something to fill the void since i just finished catching up on the Noragami manga and for some reason I just couldn't enjoy Tokyo Ghoul.
>> ARTICLE
I really like it.  Haven't watched Fate/Stay Night yet but googling told me to Fate/Zero first.  It's on Netflix.

Basically a bunch of people in a big tournament.  The part I love is how there are multiple characters you really want to win and are attached to, but you know only one will.

Also the best battle animations I've ever seen.  I haven't seen One Punch Man tho its next in my list.
>> ARTICLE
That sounds pretty interesting and i have heard from my friends how amazing the battle animations are will get to it right away when i'm done with SAO. Boy are you in for a treat when you watch OPM hope you will enjoy it. 
>> ARTICLE
Fate series is phenomenal highly recommend
>> ARTICLE
Alright , next on my list then after im done with SAO 
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul needs a Madhouse Adaption, the current adaption skips some good character development and it's a bit rushed because it has to fit within their 12 episode seasons.  A lot of moments don't come over as strong because they miss little but important details. 

I highly recommend the manga once you're done watching.

>> ARTICLE
I'm glad a lot of people are enjoying it, but my god is the hype too much already. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy OPM as well since I've waited so long for the adaptation of a brilliant manga that I really enjoyed, but I absolutely do not understand why it's suddenly become like the fucking "savior of anime" all of a sudden.

I personally think OPM gets hyped too much since this season arguably doesn't have the greatest of offerings, and quality series are sparse. 

Since OPM caters to the majority of the audience (being shonen), while also being good at its own right, it gets overhyped since there's arguably not much competition this season in quality shows (for example, Owarimonogatari, even if it's one of the best this season, is still a polarizing show).

It is a great show. It is excellent at what it does and at what it wants to portray, but it's not perfect, and is definitely not the "savior of anime".

People need to relax and tone down a bit on the hype. Let time pass before evaluating the whole series. Hype can blind people too much sometimes.

EDIT: Yes, I'm pretty sure all the downvotes add to the discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I don't consider it the savior of anime in terms of quality of show (although I'll never say it isn't great), but it actually is breaking the mold in a very important way. Instead of working the animators to death, paying them a few cents per frame, and hiring out-of-house animators to help them push out episodes as fast as possible, from what I've heard it's being made entirely by an in-studio animation crew (Edit: sorry, sorry sorry, I am actually very wrong about them all being in-studio animators, a lot of the major names were taken from outside of Madhouse Studios, but they aren't animators that were hired for cheap for the freelance work, they were specifically chosen and asked to do the work) who are working well together, taking their time, and loving what they're making. I'd honestly really rather go a couple of years with no anime that I enjoy as much coming out if the shows that are being made could be more and more labors of love and less and less making artists hate their lives. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess it is a demographics thing as you have mentioned. People love fighting anime and it has a huge demographic, so people kind of jump aboard it more readily than let's say, comedy or romance where the demographics even within the fandom can be split on it. While action is pretty straightforward and honest as an appeal for its fans.
>> ARTICLE
Actually Romance is damn popular when done correctly, Even as a not really into feelings kinda guy, I love a good love story between two characters that actually fit each other
>> ARTICLE
Cause if they didn't animate it amazingly well it would be remembered embarrassingly enough as the ''Anime where the manga had better animations than the anime''. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, murata sensei did such a good job with the official version! where're the obligatory gifs?

Oh man do I ever feel ya. One punch man gots me so fucking hype. Every time I hear the opening at the start of an episode, I can feel the hype juices.

OPM is animated by arguably the best team of animators that were first brought together to do Space Dandy in 2014. They are freelancers and I doubt many of them were working on Hajime no Ippo. Just had to clarify that.

One Punch Man is the best thing since JoJo.
>> ARTICLE
Heh, I love your post/review.  I have to be honest though, I seriously don't get why Dragonball is so popular.  I've watched it, but it was one of the worst animes I've ever seen. It must be an age thing, I guess.  Kind of like Pokemon...like, yeah, sure, good game and all, but there's this whole community that has some sort of weird religious attachment to it for some reason.

I guess I'm only saying this because I do love One Punch Man, but I also get the feeling that other people aren't getting the jokes, the things it skewers with such adroitness.
>> ARTICLE
Weird religious attachment?  Uhh.  I mean, you go around catching little monsters and training and evolving them.  It's just wonderfully unique.

But yeah I thought Dragon Ball was kinda funny at times but not great.  Never enjoyed DBZ it was always people talking about how much they gonna win and then charging up blasts.

Fight 1: Woah he used a level 1 blast!

Fight 2: A level 2 blast was used omg!

Fight 3: Impossible he used the never before seen level 3 blast!!!

Etc.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, DBZ is one of the anime that built the shonen tropes as we know them today. 

Maybe it doesn't age well to some?
>> ARTICLE
I watched DBZ for the first time last year and thought it was great (I watched Kai though). I was 18 so I don't think it's an age thing, you just may not like battle shounen much. It's also probably the most influential series of all time, so if you felt like you had already seen the same thing in another show, chances are DB was the origin of that trope.
>> ARTICLE
dbz isnt for weebs 
>> ARTICLE
its good but its not THE BEST ANIME EVAH like /r/anime would have you believe. 

Its funny and well animated but its a bit of a mixed bag, you don't really know what you are going to get with each episodes, some are downright sluggish. 

It is my favorite anime of this season, but people need to relax. Hype only makes things worse by raising your expectations. 
>> ARTICLE
ok, maybe THE BEST ANIME EVAH is a bit of an exaggeration. but this one's solidly great, and a candidate for best anime of the season, if not the year
>> ARTICLE
I think episodes 5 and 8 might get you pumped up in a similar way, let's just suffice to say the main character isn't the only awesome hero you'll be seeing in this show. I hope you keep watching and keep enjoying. 

By the way, you mentioned you really appreciated all the send-ups in that first episode, I can tell you now that they don't stop just in that first episode! Would you mind sharing some of the other hero shows you like while we wait for episode 9 tomorrow?

I didn't watch past the first episode. Didn't find anything compelling at all in it.

Yep, I have the same feeling. This some how resonated with me a LOT.

One Punch Man is one of those rare shows that can legitimately be considered art. The amount of dedication that the animators, musicians, and producers have to this show is beyond the scope of being just a show - it's one of the few that I would recommend to anyone at all, whether or not they watch anime, and holy shit is that saying something.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's a nice sentiment from you, but the anime itself is nothing I found to be worthwhile. It just seemed like one of the many.

I usually don't do this with anime, but never had I listened to an OP theme and used it as workout fuel.  OPM delivers and motivates on so many levels that it shocked the hell out of me.  Now if I can workout like Saitama and get that strong, I would be set for life.
>> ARTICLE
If you like One Punch Man, and have yet to see Shokugeki no Souma, you should watch that too. Same producers. I believe they stopped producing Shokugeki so they could make one punch man. Which is perfectly fine with me but they both are amazing shows with beautiful animations and they're hysterically funny!
>> ARTICLE
Good for you. I was instead bored after 10 minutes of repeating the same one hit one kill joke, and it never goes away.

Also, the true Dragonball is a slapstick comedy you heathen!
>> ARTICLE
"The same one hit one kill joke" lmao you've entirely missed the point of OPM. From how I see it it's a parody of typical shit shounen and its literally in its name "one punch man". 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I agree. It's far from the anime jesus everyone is hyping it to be and as enjoyable as it is, I find it to be just 'okay'.
>> ARTICLE
Beating the monster in one hit every time isn't the joke, the joke is about what happens when you take that concept and apply more logic to it. Saitama started out by wishing that he could be one of the hot-blooded heroes who has to grit his teeth and almost die to save the day, but now that he has real super powers he is never challenged anymore and he's still unemployed, wastes his time on comics and video games, and he has negative social skills so now he's become despondent. He never bothers to question why there are so many giant monsters attacking all the time because they're inconsequential to him, even though the rest of the country is living in terror because you get monsters and villains nearly every day. And then there are also all the fights that don't involve OPM himself, or even the ones that he is in but doesn't punch the guy he's fighting for a while, those are great.

True Dragon Ball wasn't just slapstick, it was also super powers and adventure from the beginning. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not worth it man. This guy is a pseudointellectual with very average intelligence. He doesn't understand half of what he thinks he does and doesn't care about your logic or opinion. Trust me, I've been there and tried to reason with him.

I don't know if this has all his streams but [here's a youtube channel filled with them](https://www.youtube.com/user/Relampaghost/videos)
>> ARTICLE
I have to say I never really noticed it before but Genos's arms are huge. Just because he doesn't really have real muscles doesn't mean he's not ripped.

Jesus the entire washroom is just filled with bombs.

Dem back rockets. Genos is such a badass.
>> ARTICLE
FUBUKI!

Is she really voiced by Saori Hayami in the OVA? 
If so, she definitely has a lot more range than her more commonly used Onii-sama voice.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, that's really Saori Hayami -  is definitely listed in the credits.  

If you watched Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen, she also used a voice similar to her Fubuki tone in that show as the character Munechika. [Here's an example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrTKmbYGWHU)
>> ARTICLE
She's even more talented than I had expected~! 
>> ARTICLE
She also did the legendary [Hatoko rant](http://web.archive.org/web/20150611093337/http://a.pomf.se/ieeciu.webm) from Inou Battle n a single take.
>> ARTICLE
She also does some pretty cool stuff as Shiraishi in Yamada and the seven witches. Her character and the MC switch bodies, and she has to speak like a delinquent. 
>> ARTICLE
Fubuki's chin bothered me more than it should
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the animation is kinda underwhelming. Fubuki is drawn pretty underwhelming too. But since its just OVA Ill let it pass. 
>> ARTICLE
I am surprised they don't use the side stories from the manga/web comic for these, there are some good ones.

>> ARTICLE
Now I'm hyped for the all the stuff that might happen in the hypothetical third season. Also, I now have diabetes.
>> ARTICLE
Third??? We haven't even had a second yet!
>> ARTICLE
Webcomic stuff involving the sisters will probably be a major part of the arc that will make up the third season if it ever gets made. 
>> ARTICLE
I still hope we get more development in the webcomic itself. That little arc was unsatisfying =(
>> ARTICLE
Ah that makes sense, thanks for the info!
>> ARTICLE
Probably the best one of these so far.
>> ARTICLE
They've been incrementally getting better, though I'd rank Road to Hero above the following two.

The next and final OVA looks like it'll top all the previous ones.
>> ARTICLE
The French fry one was just awful.
>> ARTICLE
I know. How the hell could someone just steal the best potato? HOW?
>> ARTICLE
Fubuki continues being best girl!
>> ARTICLE
So many best girls in this OVA!
>> ARTICLE
well there are only like 2? Fubuki and Tatsumaki, not counting side characters, so ya xD.
>> ARTICLE
They never told us that C-class woman's name!
>> ARTICLE
Cutest heroine of them all
>> ARTICLE
You *have* to count Lily. On principle! She wasn't in the original, Murata added her in the remake because there weren't enough women.
>> ARTICLE
Is the manga different from the webcomic?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. Certainly, there is the redrawing aspect, but also some details change and a few things are left out or added. Nothing too big though. It's done in close cooperation with ONE, who writes the web comic. Many of the changes are ones he requested.
>> ARTICLE
Oh so ONE added Lily, thanks for explaining that. So is there two versions of the webcomic floating around? I would imagine adding a whole character is a pretty big change.
>> ARTICLE
So, ONE made the original, which is a webcomic. And Murata made the redrawing, which in turn got adapted into the anime. Murata added Lily, but she's a side character, so it isn't that big of a change. She simply gives a name to the Fubuki group. Now, Murata added Lily into the early chapters, but after he did so, she appeared in ONE's version, just only in the very late chapters. So she appears earlier in Murata's version, both in chapters and in real-world time, but is in both.
>> ARTICLE
There's a webcomic and a manga, that's all. And Lily has been in the manga like once or twice so it's not that big of a change.
>> ARTICLE
i did as a side character :). it's still 2 main-ish characters xD.
>> ARTICLE
So when will season 2 be probable? I've read that there was not enough source material to make a season 2 last fall.
>> ARTICLE
In 2-3 years at least. OPM is a labor of love considering Murata will redo entire scenes and even take out scenes(it's sad to say he took out a scene that involves Saitama and chair-fu). Him and ONE also have other things going on like ONE with his other series Mob Psycho 100 and Murata doing the art for the Street Fighter novel. 
>> ARTICLE
Correct me if I'm wrong but Mob Psycho 100 ended awhile ago and Murata was merely doing Street Fighter artwork for Street Fighter Vs launch....
>> ARTICLE
You're half right. Mob Psycho just had a new chapter that might've started a new arc and like I said earlier Murata was(don't know what else he's doing now since I can't read the moonrunes on his twitter) doing art for the Street Fighter novel.
>> ARTICLE
Mob is still ongoing, though it might be about to start a final arc. The anime is starting in the very near future though!
>> ARTICLE
2-3 years makes me depressed
>> ARTICLE
The wait is almost the same for AoT since it's the same problem. Besides, there's a lot of great shows happening this season and the following others. That and you could just...well read the manga. You get more King, Fubuki(besto garl OH YEA), and the best big brother Metal Bat.
>> ARTICLE
great shows like what? i dont know anything airing this season.
>> ARTICLE
Watch the lost village 
>> ARTICLE
3-episode rule. Just follow the threads that get posted here.

Boku no Hero Academia is a good one; Kuma Miko is your seasonal SoL; Mayoiga has some mystery; Sakamoto is generally funny; Koutetsujou no Kabaneri feels a lot like AoT if you like action.

Lily of the Three Section Staff

Imo, the best special so far. Even better than the original ova.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed.
>> ARTICLE
This is my favorite one so far.
>> ARTICLE
The time between these is so damn long! Luckily the current season is pretty enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Fubuki is defintely a class act, I hope we see more of her soon. Also I love that simple piano piece that plays towards the end, it's really atmospheric.

Though how lewd was Genos at the end there!
>> ARTICLE
where is everyone watching the OVAs at? HALP ME!!!

Genos is in fucking love with his Sensei.

Yes
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
well, that was kinda boring.

only liked the last part with sai and genos with his doctor
>> ARTICLE
This episode only made me wonder if there are any Fubuki x Tatsumaki doujinshis. Not much more to say about it really. 
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who'd like to see more of that C-class female cutie? 
>> ARTICLE
Aww, Ino and Sonic were so cute together.

Also, that [face](https://i.imgur.com/tJ5LHhs.gifv) that Saitama made was pretty creepy.

Overall, I think I liked this one the most so far from the OVAs!
>> ARTICLE
>  face

The true face of terror.

Not sure if he's trying to kill the bear or steal candy from a baby.

Reminds me of [this] (http://lolheaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2428-600x396.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Sonic's training was inspirational. It's too bad that it's never going to help him beat Saitama. 
>> ARTICLE
He just needs to switch up his routine a bit. Work in some strength training, like push-ups or sit-ups. Maybe a little running.
>> ARTICLE
Eat a banana here and then
>> ARTICLE
lose some hair here and there too

But no air conditioning.  That's the key.

Ino is the most adorable nutritious meal.  
[](#nico-heart)
>> ARTICLE
Aww Sonic's got a adorable little sidekick/henchpig.

Nice to see Sonic getting over his horrific trauma and Saitama's face when he went for the bear was chilling.
>> ARTICLE
Sonic is always going to ~~marry~~ remember the first one that touched him in his special place. 

Also, end scenes with Saitama had top notch animation. You could tell One is involved. 
>> ARTICLE
When does the OVA/special with the sisters come out?
>> ARTICLE
April 22nd.
>> ARTICLE
For a minute I though Ino became food.
>> ARTICLE
"Most animals are edible, in fact, so are most aliens. And monsters. And demons...dragons...devils...elder beasts, beings from outside our realm of existence, and gods. If you can kill them you can eat them. I usually prefer pork and vegetables though."

It sucks that the hunter guy didn't get his revenge. Good for Saitama though, he got free food. ^^^Not ^^^free ^^^french ^^^fries ^^^though

Cute, but i was a little sad we didnt get to see a Saitama and Sonic rematch :/

:/ but they did have a rematch. Remember the episode with the quota.

Yeah, when Saitama ate his fucking sword.

>> ARTICLE
Cross-posting from /r/OnePunchMan since the subs are out.
>> ARTICLE
Well this was unexpected as hell. Traverse the seven seas with me mates
>> ARTICLE
So finally an OVA without Genos playing a central role? Nice.
>> ARTICLE
The only OVA I have seen was for Mirai Nikki. Is this worth a watch.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it definitely is. Not as exciting as the actual episodes, but it gives more characterisation to Sonic. Also it's canon since ONE writes these.

OVA 1 was somewhat entertaining, but didn't really add anything new other than how precious Saitama considers long fries, and OVA 2 was sorta fanservice for the Fujoshi crowd. This is my favourite special so far, but Road to Hero (sorta OVA 0) is definitely worth watching too.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, thanks for the input I'll give these a shot after I finish NGE.

Found it hilarious that out of all their confrontations the thing that gives him PTSD is the punch to the balls lol.

Anyone want to tell me if there is a good release of it (you don't have to tell me what I'll search for it)... as when the first OVA while it was airing came out I remember it being shit double translate release so I didn't watch it..
>> ARTICLE
I kind of felt bad for the old man. 

Saitama crushes his spirit, and was close to crushing his skull as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Saitama's face was brillaint though. One of the few anime to actually make me laugh out loud instead of exhaling through my nose...
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, this is one of the only shows in a while that had me in physical pain from laughing. When Saitama reached for the hammer and it slide, the face he made was priceless

Hey, As you can guess I have no ownership of the design so would be poor form to give it out not to mention- possibly illegal.

Absolutely gorgeous, man. Blows my One Punch OC out of the water! I remember your fan art contest submission, you're the reason I stopped working on my entry! :D

I'm trying to get the hang of painting and coloring in Photoshop, maybe sometime we can arrange a group Skype drawing sesh! But anyways, again, fantastic work!

Anyway, this is really cool! Well done! My only complaint is that this makes Genos look kind of... young? Feminine? I don't know. Still cool. Did I mention this is cool? Yeah, it's cool.
>> ARTICLE
He looked a bit thinner in the manga, so I think this is closer to that.

> this makes Genos look kind of... young? Feminine?

"Bishy".

Thanks! I did want to make him look like a pretty boy since he seems to be depicted as such, so going by your comment I think it worked out pretty well!

Wow damn that's some real amazing art right there! Love the details and how Genos looks, it's incredible to be honest. Hopefully you do the scene of the big giant hole in the moutains after Saitama's punch vs Genos! I would really love that.

Hi Sudocremed_Myself, this is posted on *all* fanart submissions, so if you've already done what I'm about to ask, please ignore me!

We prefer if all fanart submissions contained:

Blocked in my country (US), though I found ~~this version on vimeo~~. It doesn't sound pitch-shifted, but if anyone can confirm it then that would be great.

There's no pitch shifter, but the audio is sped up. It's going to mess up our syncing process.

Yes! Finally! This would be my first one ever. Quick question, I want to do this as a group with my friends so we might all record on the same mic. Can we also record a video of us doing this? Like at the beginning before the OP really kicks off, when everyone is saying random funny stuff, you can show us gathering around the mic and getting ready. If that's too much work, it's fine, the point is I may have a group together on one mic.

HYPE!
>> ARTICLE
Sure. I'm not sure how we might use it (or not use it at all) but feel free to send it.
>> ARTICLE
If it can't be used, the audio will be there. We were planning on doing some sort of choreographed singing thing since everyone has seen the opening to OPM. This was an idea I had for a while, I thing everyone that sends audio to you should do this so we can all see who sings. I think it'd be cool. 

Think this but from everyone in /r/ anime (without the special effects): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQP3l5q4JtA

Just tried practicing it before school. Happy to say neighbours arent happy

Also I hope Kail doing this means that you are going to do something else, (Kyouran Hey Kids pls)

If you have everyone signing together, I'm in. If its like the one you did for Haikyuu where you play individuals in sections, ill pass. Its more fun as one large group, plus we sound better.
>> ARTICLE
Dang. My voice fluctuates from day to day from sad to fairly average...I think it depends on how much time I spend exercising my vocal chords in the shower. I'll totally try to find a day when I'm home alone to try this, and I look forward to everyone's entries! :D

I'm going to do this one. I told myself I would have to finally do one of these if it was the one punch man op. Prepare yourselves.

For a straight up redraw of a scene, its pretty decent. There are some things that could be really touched up, like the jagged jawline, and the perspective of the fist. The coloring is by far the best part of this
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the constructive criticism! I am not going to lie but you picked out the two parts that have been bothering me the most haha
The jawline is something I can't help but look at and the fist is simply due to me being shit at drawing hands.
Thank you though I hope you come back to see more, I like a critical eye!

Its nice that most other people in this thread are all positive, but as an artist I know how little that helps in terms of getting better. You definitely have potential, keep practicing.

Murata is simply an amazing man. 

I've seen a lot of his streams. He greets everyone in multiple languages and constantly talks with his viewers. He even speaks fluent english and keeps people like me informed about the newest releases.

He kicks in his playlist of good music and just starts drawing. In his lunch break he talks with us and shows us his work as an assistance. 

Additional to that he streams for hours...hours of pure drawing and the quality gets just better and better.

He even shows us how he makes his pencil by taping two chopsticks together or gives us drawing lessons in how to do shades or details.

Truly a dedicated man who loves his work and the people that share this passion with him.
>> ARTICLE
Do you have a link to his streams?
>> ARTICLE
I think it's this [one](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nebu-kuro1)?
>> ARTICLE
> He even shows us how he makes his pencil by taping two chopsticks together

wait what
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he likes to use a pencil consisting of two chopsticks ( You can See that, just watch one of his recordings ). He said it's better this way because then the pencil won't role around an accidentally paint his work. He can also do those long curved lines easier thanks to the length of the chopsticks. :D
>> ARTICLE
i was quickly skipping through some of them since i was in class and dident see it in any of them :(

i dont understand how he makes a pencil out of chopsticks tho...
>> ARTICLE
He builds them now and then but you always see him using this "pencil". 

He tapes two chopsticks together until there is a thick layer of tape where his hand holds the "pencil". Then he takes a knife and makes the end smaler so he can put on a dispensing head. And it's done:D
>> ARTICLE
Link?

in one of these vods:

It was actually just 2 or 3 days ago. You should find it on his ustream. Should be the one on Friday. He tells you that in Japanese tho but you can interpret it quite well.

Wow. He's like the anti-Togashi.
>> ARTICLE
Why?
>> ARTICLE
Murata speaks English fluently. Togashi can barely speak it. Murata keeps people informed about the newest releases. Togashi takes year long hiatuses with hardly any warning and doesn't inform anyone what he's doing or how he's doing.
>> ARTICLE
togashi sound like the guy from berserk, yearly hiatus 
>> ARTICLE
There are 2 things that are usually required for second seasons.

Sales, and the source work's permission.

So far, this is very good news.

I just looked at the [Amazon JP dvd rankings for Anime](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/bestsellers/dvd/562020/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_d_1_2_last) and OPM is currently number 12, so the sales figures wont be a problem, hopefully.

It may end up in the top 5 soon.

Please can we give Murata the Manga Artist of the year like seriously everything he does is just a God's work his art is GODLIKE (like LORD Boros and Saitama) and his dedication is Unreal so yeah Yusuke Murata [FTW] (http://imgur.com/fmGr9b1)

EXTRA:He also streams like wtf that's awesome showing his skills LIVE makes him more impressive.

EDIT:Don't forget about EYESHIELD 21 

EXTRA: He also have a YT channel called Caped Baldy but i dont think he updates it that much.

Sometimes while he streams he does push-ups.

>> ARTICLE
There was that chapter that i couldn't tell who is taking to who
>> ARTICLE
All that hiatus is really going into drawing food
>> ARTICLE
I love this page because the chicken is so detailed...
>> ARTICLE
It's as if he was so proud of himself drawing the turkey that he just decided he deserved the break from drawing for the rest of the page
>> ARTICLE
That's almost certainly what happened. Togashi explicitly won't do anything that stresses him out because it's detrimental to his mental health and he/his wife make tons off of their series' royalties. So he probably sketched the basic page layout, worked on the first panel on and off until it stopped being enjoyable and then quickly finalized the other panels so he could move onto something else.

>> ARTICLE
But will ONE start working harder to release new webcomics?

I need to see the end of this [webcomic spoilers](/s "Tatsumaki tsundere arc") pleeaaase.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it has only been so slow since he has been working out the anime production of OPM and Mob. I mean, he's probably handling a lot of it himself. 
>> ARTICLE
Currently he is streaming way more often. He is also releasing 4 chapters in 4 weeks. That's superb for Murata
>> ARTICLE
I was referring to ONE. Not Murata. I know Murata has been very busy lately. 
>> ARTICLE
One is pretty consistent about getting out 1 chapter a week, it's just that One Punch Man isn't the only thing he works on. That being said,  his other series, Mob Psycho 100, seems to be in its final stretch, so there might be more frequent One Punch Man chapters in the near future.
>> ARTICLE
I hope Mob Psycho 100 gets redrawn at some point. I can't read it because the art is so bad.
>> ARTICLE
Lol I actually really like the art, the beginning is pretty bad but it becomes a lot better later on. 
>> ARTICLE
His art in Mob Psycho is much, much better than it was at the start of OPM. He got a few assistants who help him a lot, and he's just gotten a lot better. Plus the story is better than OPM's.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's getting a Bones anime.
>> ARTICLE
Aren't they going to mimic One's artsyle, though?
>> ARTICLE
More like draw inspiration from it.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't mind if they did. Ping Pong The Animation turned out pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
Who said that
>> ARTICLE
Just a rumor since the only source material is ONE's webcomic.

Also because [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LtSw0r-2z4) exist.
>> ARTICLE
That looks like it could be an animated story board though (yes I know about ones style) I've seen stuff like that on YouTube before
>> ARTICLE
That's probably the plan. He's been "finishing" the last chapter of Mob for a few weeks now, so he'll probably go back to releasing more OPM then.
>> ARTICLE
As well as source material; which is why he's saying he'll work hard. Hopefully we get a second season within a few years. 
>> ARTICLE
The story so far have [104 chapter](http://galaxyheavyblow.web.fc2.com/index.html) by the author.

Meaning that in worst case scenario they can use the art by Murata in a second season while using the work by One until chapter 104.
>> ARTICLE
Doubt it; a lot of the character art would be decided by MH and not Murata, which wouldn't jive well with him I'm sure. Additionally, there's going to be extra arcs in the manga that weren't in the webcomic, so the anime going off of the webcomic would be an inferior product.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, maintaining the current speed it will take quite a while to reach enough material for 12 more episodes. Specially if they use the filler for ovas. Which is kinda sad for me, OPM was the first fortnightly manga that I started to read and the waits always take their toll.
>> ARTICLE
Weren't the OVAs supposed to be anime original?
>> ARTICLE
Im not sure, there are "mini-chapters" released in between the main story, that are usually short arcs or stuff about before him becoming the super Saitama. I assumed they were using those for the ovas. There is also the webcomic, but I dont follow it and dont know if its even cannon anymore.
>> ARTICLE
The webcomic done by ONE is the original work.
>> ARTICLE
The webcomic is the original, it is the canon.               
The manga is simply a prettier adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
Not just prettier, Murata adds more content and also ties some knots that ONE left out.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, most of the story changes were probably prompted by ONE himself. I'm sure he would love to go over his story in more detail and fix stuff.

Murata doesn't add anything that wasn't approved by ONE.
>> ARTICLE
I know, I believe both of them add stuff but what Murata adds must be approved by ONE first. And in the other comment with "Murata" I meant his version.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure the OVAs are all anime original and written by ONE.

Hey man 10 manga chapters for Togashi is working hard. Taking a break from Dragon Quest to actually write is a massive sacrifice.

Given Togashi has to write and draw. Not to mention backpains and family. I can sorta understand his stress and laziness. Still not fucking cool to torture us like this.

Still has back pains after two years. Ok

I forgot to air quote it.

He could have gotten injured couldn't he? My step-dad has had like metal plates or something put in his lower back and he's got pain all the time there.

It wasnt like he was hit by a car. I am guessing it is backpain from sitting too long.
>> ARTICLE
if that's true, then he will feel pain for the rest of his career unless he finds a way
>> ARTICLE
> and draw.

That's subjective (though it is pretty good in the 10 chapters post anime)

His laziness is kind of unwarranted though, Togashi is just a very lazy person, as proven from his own unwillingness to work from interviews. You could argue that Japan is a very stress work environemnt especially for mangaka, however people like Oda, Araki, Yasuhisa and Murata prove that passionate people still strive (even through adversity or when raising family). Togashi on the other hand chose the wrong profession and simply isn't fit to do it. You could make excuses in favor of him, but all of the people I've listed have gone through similar problems and kept going.

does he get paid well? i guess so given the size of the fan base. but i dabbled with art for a bit and it's honestly the least financially rewarding career one can pursue given the amount of time/effort one puts in for even a single page. like ive been watching some art streams lately and it honestly takes a day per page. and no, it's not just 8 or 10 hours of work. it's like 12 hours for a single page. 4hrs for sketch, 4hrs for line art/adjustments, 4 hours for toning/shading. so say you get $100 per page. that's $8/hour, less than minimum wage in canada. there's no way it's worth it. like even imagine if he gets $10,000 per chapter and it has 20 pages (highly unlikely!). that's $500 per page. $500/12hours, is still $40/hr. $80k/year. decent money but if you went to a decent school and in a STEM field, it's not worth it. sure it's not all about money and sure you'll draw faster over time, but he's definitely not getting $10k per chapter lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny that you bring that up, because Murata is actually highly praised for his ridiculous quality artwork for One Punch Man, Araki and Yasuhisa as well, but Murata especially and it's that exact person that's saying he's willing to work harder for something he believes in and is passionate towards. And this is being done *preemptively* before criticisms and complaints amount the longevity or intentions of the OPM anime.

For that reason I don't think the two are comparable. One works hard, then works harder, while the other sort of tries in his own special way.
>> ARTICLE
Four hours for sketching one page? Are you serious? Isn't that the antithesis of what a sketch is?
>> ARTICLE
>His laziness is kind of unwarranted though

See, I'm not a fan of the guy, but that's bullshit. 

The reason that he's allowed to do what he does with Hunter X Hunter is because back when he was working on Yu Yu Hakusho he was worked TO THE BONE. Really fucking shitty working conditions and terrible deadlines put in place by Shonen Jump. They fucked with the story of YYH through his editors and made it continue when even he didn't want it to. 

However, Togashi made YYH a big success for Shuiesha and that's where HxH comes into play. Having made them, well, so much money, he got a nice big shiny contract that said "do whatever the fuck you want!" as many successful mangaka will get when finishing a series like YYH.

THAT is why Togashi is allowed to say "fuck it" in regards to Hunter X Hunter, it's because he wasn't a lazy fuck back then and pushed it to the limit. I'd say that he deserves what he has now, though I'd like him to make more manga.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like we're way to harsh on Togashi. I'd rather he enjoys his life to the fullest, then spend most of it leaning over a desk, writing/story boarding Hunter X Hunter.
>> ARTICLE
I think you mean Togashi, Sorachi does Gintama iirc. But yeah, I can kinda understand where you come from. Mangaka deserve a break every now and then. Eventually, I think we'll see a movement to monthly manga with chapters the size of two or three weeks worth of weekly manga, which will allow the creators to create extra and have some saved up for when they want vacation. However, there is a difference between "a break" and what Togashi does haha.

I want to know, is the series as popular in Japan as it is outside Japan? 


>> ARTICLE
According to [Ani-Me](http://ani-me.jp/news/7255) it's been ranked top 2 week after week for a while this season, so it's rated quite highly over there as well as the West.  In terms of actual viewership numbers though, I don't think it was doing all that fantastic in Japan.  Stuff like Monogatari and Rakudai and some others I can't recall of the top of my head were beating OPM in TV viewing numbers on multiple occasions.  I'm trying to find some of those viewership numbers, but it is proving to be difficult.  They were usually up on 4chan.

We'll have to see how well the blu-rays of it sell before we really know anything ;P
>> ARTICLE
Well, tv numbers don't matter in general. In other words they don't mind if the views on tv are bad because this is expected. Anime air really really late and just a minority of people actually watched tv that late because of the Japanese work culture. It's not considered a important income source nor a sign of popularity. The Manga Sales and BD Sales will show its true popularity
>> ARTICLE
Eh, the TV ratings in *comparison* to other shows matter, and in that regard OPM hasn't been all that special.  The TV ratings as an absolute mean little though, yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what kind of insight these numbers should give but they don't replicate anything regarding the show's popularity. Only a handful of the population watches tv that late which is mostly passioned anime fans and in most cases they have to make decisions what to watch otherwise they would stay up until a very late hour. 

This comparison is strongly influenced by the time and their everyday life. If I would want to know its popularity I would rather look at things that are purchasable at free will and at any time like manga volumes or BD/DVD. 

Sigh, kinda of a bummer that anime has to air that late in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
My point is simply that in comparison to other late-night anime, OPM hasn't fared all that well in TV ratings.  It could mean everything, it could mean nothing, we'll see ;P
>> ARTICLE
I went to go buy the volumes that come after the series and the regular non-manga bookstore I went to had like twenty of each volume in a big display. They usually keep one copy of each volume of a series they carry in stock other than the newest couple
>> ARTICLE
I saw ads for it while riding the train when I was in Japan if that means any thing.
>> ARTICLE
I visited Tokyo around three weeks ago. In all the major Manga stores that I went to I saw tons of One-punch comics. Probably 3-to-1 in comparison to anything else. In some of the stores in Shinjuku I heard the OP song being played. So based off that I figured it was.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is consistently a top seller in Japan.
>> ARTICLE
Canadian here. Last anime I watched the way I watch this was Gundam 00. Nothing since has grabbed me until OPM. 

I am hooked on this and pressure everyone I know with an inkling of anime indulgence to watch this and drive sales/views. 

Saitama deserves a chance to exert himself. 
>> ARTICLE
"As popular"? Probably not, since right now this show is being mentioned everywhere on the internet. For example, back when Attack on Titan was airing, it had a similar effect of "being mentioned everywhere" like One Punch Man is, but you could also see that this popularity was being translated directly in Japan. This doesn't seem to be the case for OPM. However, it probably still is quite popular, just not sure how much. 
>> ARTICLE
The preorder numbers I saw were respectable but not as good as some other shows this season. 
>> ARTICLE
No show can beat a good gundam or a  monogatari show. Like its not possible at all
>> ARTICLE
I think it is but still we need to wait for its DvD/BD sales.
>> ARTICLE
well i've already bought the manga, gonna get the BD as well

gotta have fubuki animated 
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking this because I've seen a few Japan lists and it's hovered around #8 or so on Top 20 so I think it's popular, maybe just not as popular.

I swear if OPM doesn't have anything but amazing BD/DVD sales, I'm gonna ~~stop watching anime~~ be a little angry at Japan for the rest of ~~my lifetime~~ the decade. This is seriously the most hype anime of the year. Even a friend of mine who never watches (and said that never would) simulcasts is watching it as it is airing.
>> ARTICLE
Why doesn't your friend like simulcasts? Not a fan of subs? If it's that, I can understand that. Reading text while trying to look at the entire screen can be a bit hectic if you're a slow reader.
>> ARTICLE
Not OP or said friend, but I also have a friend who does the same. His reasoning is that he prefers to have all episodes out before watching it.
>> ARTICLE
I am someone who doesn't watch airing shows. (Unless it is a very specific show I care about.)

My reasoning is a few things. First off, I'm terribly lazy at times. Keeping up with an anime is work for me. Having other people test the waters of a show to see if I would enjoy it or not helps make sure that I can watch the good stuff first. 

Second, I like to watch at my own pace. Sometimes I'll only be able to force myself to sit down and enjoy an episode of one thing once a day. Other times I'm bored enough or in the mood to juggernaut through a large amount of a series.

Also helps avoid split cour cliffhangers and similar. (Or infamous recap episodes.)

Hey there, if figuring out show scheduling is a bit of a challenge, you may want to try senpai.moe . I recently started using it and it helps with keeping track of things. You can sync it to your MAL and it'll give you a day-by-day breakdown of currently airing shows on your list. Just a thought!

What's wrong with Toei? I like their one cour shows.

Edit: To clarify, I'm talking about one cour shows, which OPM S2 undoubtedly will be. Granted, I haven't seen too many Toei works, but Mononoke and Kyousougiga are some of my favorite shows.

Naturally, long run shonens tend to dip in quality. Unless you're Madhouse.
>> ARTICLE
Well they've been pretty damn lazy with One Piece the past few years so that's left me as less of a fan of them.
>> ARTICLE
as sad as it is, they don't have to raise the quality for one piece because it's already the king and the mangasales are still going strong. A series running for 15 years just can't be compared to 12-24 episode seasons and they are probably operating on a lower budget for OP. 
>> ARTICLE
Long running series from Toei tend to have terrible animation because they need to stretch out the budget towards an indefinite number of episodes. There's no such thing as being lazy when fighting tight deadlines, low funds, and shit pay. Nostalgia-bait cash-ins that they're made to animate aren't exactly high priority either. DBZ:S and Sailormoon Crystal? With all due respect to their original series, they're old. They don't bring in the sales boost that anime are made for. So they only get low resources to work with, simple as that.

The [quality](https://sakuga.yshi.org/data/96bb96f8abc33bd411e1dad1970d99a0.mp4) of Toei's [one cour](https://sakuga.yshi.org/data/ab5a240f5f6081f45007c6e7d7d440a9.mp4) series are very well above many other studios.

And that's not even including the [long-running series](https://sakuga.yshi.org/data/b1ae13f863c6520454075c3f70ae08cb.mp4) that do get the [resources](https://sakuga.yshi.org/data/26474e4c43c9ff332942635acf6c7624.webm) they need to produce [something decent](https://sakuga.yshi.org/data/e5c55a9329d04ed7c209dda7cacf8712.mp4).

>> ARTICLE
I mean, I like Toei, but to say they are above KyoAni, Shaft, Madhouse, UFOtable, BONES, JC Staff, A1, or any other similar size studio, is just wrong. Maybe if you compare them to really small studios with less pedigree, like Mappa or DEEN, you would be right, but Toei is still not nearly as good as many others. 
>> ARTICLE
I said "many other studios". Obviously I'm implying they're above average studios of which there are many and each season tends to be filled with shows from these studios. 

Now compared to say... JC Staff? Their drawings are more higher quality overall but Toei has them beat in series with unique art direction and action. Toei fight scenes are usually animated in a more three dimensional space which is considerably more difficult. I'd take a good Precure fight over anything in DanMachi. Toei has better CGI as well. I forgot to mention this but they actually have some of the [best in the industry](https://d.maxfile.ro/tknefhheng.webm). I did not like the job JC did with Heavy Object.

Now obviously unless we set some kind of metric for comparison, this all really comes down to personal preference. So here's my point:

Yes, many of Toei's shows are low quality because cheap production is their business model and it's why they're given long series to adapt. Toei does not release many one-cour series or movies but every time I've seen them do it, I am amazed because they're visually stunning and usually wind up in the Top 10 for their respective years. Whenever Precure has a good action sequence, it is usually some of the best sakuga you'll see out of the year. Good work deserves to be compared with the best, regardless of where they end up ranking among them.

Unfortunately, a mangaka doesn't have too much say in whether or not a show will get a second season. That is in the hands of the magazine in which the series is being serialized (whether they feel funding an anime season for one of their series is a worthwhile venture), and the production committee. 
>> ARTICLE
You'll be hard-pressed to find a Jump series that hasn't received a 2nd season. Haikyuu S2 is ongoing, we just got word of Shoukugeki no Soma S2, and AssClass S2 is next season.
>> ARTICLE
I understand what you're saying, and it's true that Jump series have a very good record of anime adaptations, but the 3 you named aren't just Jump series, they are extremely successful Jump series (especially Haikyuu and AssClass). There are Jump series that either don't have anime adaptations or have anime adaptations that end early with no apparent plan of returning. 

Also, you should know that One Punch Man actually is not serialized in Weekly Shounen Jump, but rather Tonari no Young Jump.

OPM's sales were actually very impressive in the past fiscal year for a manga without an anime . It actually outsold Soma and kept pace with Haikyuu. To really put it into perspective:

this is awesome for three reasons. One, it means that there will be a second season sooner than expected. Two, it means the manga artist will start chugging out content faster, which is amazing because the manga is spectacular. Three, the original webcomic artist will have to start chugging out work faster, or just scrap the webcomic altogether and just write story for the official manga. Which I'm all for, as I think that if ONE and Murata worked directly together on one project rather than separately on two with ONE consulting Murata on how to draw the manga.

ONE and Murata are actually working together on The redraw. They discuss the storyboard together and what things to add. ONE brings in ideas and content, a great opportunity. Still, ONE should Continue drawing his webcomic. Besides the practice, it's also way easier to redraw on actual scenes than creating completely new content
>> ARTICLE
I wish the Hunter x Hunter artist Togashi was half as much of a go-getter as Murata...
>> ARTICLE
That series will never be finished.

>> ARTICLE
This guy just got even more awesome!
>> ARTICLE
Yes!!
>> ARTICLE
It has to get a second season
>> ARTICLE
Murata continues to deliver!
>> ARTICLE
He's really working hard!
>> ARTICLE
ok.
>> ARTICLE
Please Murata! I love OPM!
>> ARTICLE
I dont really care about the anime at this point I just want Viz Media to hurry up and translate more.
>> ARTICLE
Okay... so how do you actually plan to do it?

By doubling the amount of panels that you draw and catching up to the source much quicker?

if anything, it's still rides on how fast ONE releases his story.
>> ARTICLE
There is no way we are getting a season two, cuz its Madhouse, and Madhouse never ever make season twos.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the second season yet, but I'm sure it will be the savior of anime.
>> ARTICLE
While reading the title of this post I got an erection. I wonder why.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't ONE the creator & this guy just draws the manga, who the hell is he to say that
>> ARTICLE
well, Shueisha has no rights over ONE's version, so they have to adapt Murata's version, which is an adaptation of ONE's.

So yes, he's the one who has to work harder. ONE made enough material for two seasons and a half so far i believe.
>> ARTICLE
They are basically one person because they both work on the manga together. It's THEIR project, not only Murata's
>> ARTICLE
Knowing that someday, all of your hard work will get your work a second anime season, it feels you with DETERMINATION
>> ARTICLE
I VERY doubt that will happen, lets be realistic about it.
>> ARTICLE
i hope not.

i will take my downvotes, thank you.
>> ARTICLE
May I know why?
Is it simpy because of the type of humor?
The artstyle?
The story itself?
>> ARTICLE
The story. The comedy. I like the artstyle, the animation is smooth.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, so It's simply just not your type of show?
Why are you against a second season then?
I mean... you don't have to watch it, but simply being against a second season because you don't likeit seems weird.
>> ARTICLE
Yea. Well if someone told you they are going to make a good show, you will say yes right? For example this show. You want a second reason because you like it. Isnt it fair that i dont want more bad shows and want more good shows from my perspective?
You like that show, thats totally fine. But it is not weird to wish a show dont exist, even though i dont have to watch it. 

Next you will ask me what good shows i like then lel.
>> ARTICLE
I don't wish for the walking dead, kill la kill, or Sword art online to dissappear just because I dislike them.
Each of the shows brings in money and people like them.
So they can't be bad, disagreeing with something that you don't like doesn't mean that it Should stop production.
Like... some people don't like tofu, or insects.
But that doesn't mean that people have to stop eating them all over the world.
>> ARTICLE
You've got a point, but it's not revelent to what I mean.

For example, The Kardashians show, do you like it? If not, don't you wish it never existed?
>> ARTICLE
I can't honestly give an answer to that, It doesn't even air where I live, but I'll stand by my point, denying someone the pleasure of watching something because I don't like it would be dumb.
I can't stand some shows that air where I live,
But I still think that there's a difference between a show like One punch man wich got nice humor , a decent storyline, and amazing animation... and well something like.... Eiken

>> ARTICLE
I dont think i can explain more than this. You gave your point, and i gave mine. This is going nowhere if we continue, so let's call it off. See ya later.

As far as I'm aware, no.  There is nothing you need to watch for you to understand what's going on.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched a gundam series in a loonnnnnng time, so I don't see why you couldn't start with it. Its not like most anime "series" where they follow the stories of other ones. That being said the general theme and such is similar to other ones in the series, but it's not like you have to watch other shows first.
>> ARTICLE

I'd have to ask if you dig giant robots.
>> ARTICLE
How much time ya got buddy? and how long can you deal with Amuro being a little bitch all day erry day.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, it's a complete standalone! Enjoy!
>> ARTICLE
It seems like 70% of the good anime this season is stuff stacked ontop of other stuff. Like I hear Owarimonogatari is good, but I've never seen an any episode of the franchise.

Any good recommendations for standalone things, or stuff you can watch by itself?
>> ARTICLE
Try to find a version of the franchise that does slide editing. It's a masterwork and where SHAFT mints it's money.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed there!

Personally, I'm not watching a whole bunch of shows this season (yet), but from what I am watching:

One Punch Man is a really cool and funny action/comedy show. Loads of hype there, but of course it's not for everyone. Sakurako-san is an interesting detective show where they solve mysteries by analysing skeletons. I'm enjoying it so far, and it seems to have potential, looks like it's building up to lots of drama. Great animation too. And there's also the aforementioned Gundam.

There's also the new series Heavy Object. I'm not really liking it so far, and it seems pretty campy and uninteresting. Still worth trying out and forming your own opinion though.

There's also a fair bit of stuff that I've heard about but not tried myself yet. The Perfect Insider is a mystery show that seems to be getting quite a bit of attention. Utawaremerowhatever is a romance that can apparently also be watched without having seen the first one. The Asterisk War and the Cavalry show are both regarded as "generic but interesting and cool". There's also Concrete Revolutio and Comet Lucifer, but I'm not sure what they are about.

Those seem to be the most popular new/standalone shows of the season. Hope this helps!
>> ARTICLE
>Utawaremerowhatever

Underwater Ray Romano. When in doubt, just call it that.
>> ARTICLE
Well, go watch all of monogatari
>> ARTICLE
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans and Concrete Revolutio are the other two I enjoy on Sundays.

They look fantastic! I love the detailing on Genos's cyber-arms!
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how he does the black eyes? Like a contact lens wouldnt cover the whole eye like that right?
>> ARTICLE
Was wondering the same, so I looked into it because every method I could think of wouldn't look nearly that good or be dangerous/permanent. It turns out there are contact lenses that big they're called sclera lenses, they cost about 15-30 dollars per lens. Seems like they are also fairly difficult to insert and remove which lead to a lot of people injuring their eyes.
>> ARTICLE
Sclera contacts are larger than regular ones and cover the whites of the eyes. 

[Here's a video of someone putting them in!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBkJa679ffE) they're pretty strange to look at, and look really uncomfortable to be perfectly honest.

You can get contact lenses that make your eyes black. They are larger than regular contacts.

i'm aware of that. but there are no contacts that can literally make your eyes larger. look at those gaping holes in his face where his eyes are. they're unnaturally huge.

That's a leek. They're rather popular in Japanese cooking, so they're often pictured in grocery bags. OPM is no exception to this, being pictured carrying a leek in his grocery bag often.

Nope, green onions are similar, but leeks are longer, stiffer, and have more of a milder flavor.

I'm planning on cosplaying Saitama in May next year at MCM London. Seeing this makes me even more excited.

I got banned because my friend was scrapping tickets and I was there but didn't know what was going down.

Nice man, he will probably be there so don't show him up xD

You're going to MCM London? Hopefully I'll see you there!

I went in May this year, too! I was dressed as Master Roshi.

I only went last month (as Ryuko Matoi).

Oh sweet! Do you have any pics?

Haha that's absolutely amazing! Excellent job, and glad to see you didn't lose your way 
>> ARTICLE
It was my first cosplay and it wasn't comfortable to wear at all. [I'm probably going to go as casual Ryuko](https://24.media.tumblr.com/1ea6d37c0f3ceb463b3930fc229caebb/tumblr_n34sdu4xdY1sn2bkjo1_250.gif) in May, unless I decide to go as Satsuki or Homura.
>> ARTICLE
Do you think I could pull off Satsuki?

I'm a guy, btw.
>> ARTICLE
Depends on what you look like.
>> ARTICLE
I met this guy! He was awesome! I was so happy to see that cosplay
>> ARTICLE
So did I! Comic Con in Birmingham?
>> ARTICLE
Yup thats the one :D
>> ARTICLE
Same, really nice guy and best cosplay there :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I was there too! Saw him from across the hall, pretty amazing cosplay.
>> ARTICLE
Seems to be in incredible shape. What's his workout routine? if you don't mind my asking.
>> ARTICLE
100 press ups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats, 10k run and no AC in summer and winter. THIS IS EVERYDAY. So crazy.
>> ARTICLE
And he eats 3 meals everyday, though sometimes a banana is fine in the morning.
>> ARTICLE
Dat Genos tho...
>> ARTICLE
nailed that unassuming look
>> ARTICLE
Anyone have a mirror?
>> ARTICLE
C rank.
>> ARTICLE
And again: Best girl Genos!
>> ARTICLE
those red hunter boots tho
>> ARTICLE
Fail. His face has too much vigor and hope
>> ARTICLE
He needs a grocery bag with some leeks in it.
>> ARTICLE
He said he will improve it, so the bag of leaks will be an addition :D 
>> ARTICLE
his " average" look makes him look constipated 
>> ARTICLE
That's his, fuck you face. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn he's serious
>> ARTICLE
Was this the guy at the Funimation panel at NYCC?
>> ARTICLE
lol no

>> ARTICLE
he looks just like the dude who dressed up as Saitama there haha
>> ARTICLE
I think you mean that they both look like Saitama
>> ARTICLE
not enough dedication. should have shaved off eyebrows and drew on new eye brows. 
>> ARTICLE
He has eyebrows tho
>> ARTICLE
You should xpost this to /r/manga! 
>> ARTICLE
so many of these pictures are spot on 
>> ARTICLE
This is just awesome.
>> ARTICLE
He's literally a bald man with a cape.
>> ARTICLE
I've never said this before - But I regret only having one upvote to give.
This.  Is.  Good.

>> ARTICLE
I seen a lot of cosplayer that look sexy. This one is just... average. :P 
>> ARTICLE
**OK**
>> ARTICLE
With a chrome dome like that, he should do a cosplay of Hitman, codename 47

>> ARTICLE
Not average enough im afraid!
>> ARTICLE
Anybody have a mirror? Source is not working. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the creator knew what they where doing.."we need a bald hero, he will appease to cancergroups everywhere!, but his costume must also be piss-easy to immitate, so cosplayers will be abundant"
>> ARTICLE
I wish I was white so I can cosplay Saitama... Or anything!
>> ARTICLE
Haha is there a sub for cosplayers doing mundane things like picking out candy?
>> ARTICLE
Well you tell Mr. Friends that his costume is just delightful.
>> ARTICLE
This is a great cosplay! That expression in the last photo look so alike.
>> ARTICLE
1/10 need more oppai sweater
>> ARTICLE
Was he bald to begin with or did he train until his hair fell out?
>> ARTICLE
If I ever get cancer I'll just rock the bald look with 24/7 Saitama cosplay.

His head is brighter than my future...

Anyways great cosplay!

100 push-ups. 100 sit-ups 100 squats. And 10km running.  Everyday.

Is saitama the easiest character to cosplay? Just a bald head and a costume and every1 is caped baldy

The year on r/anime has been great with awesome content from all of you. I am trying to return the favor with this video and wish you a merry christmas! There haven't been enough OPM Opening parodies yet /s  
It took me around 50 hours to create this. The only programs I used were Microsoft Paint (With a mouse, no cheating with pen and tablet) and Sony Vegas (to put the images together / use transparency / animate). No Photoshop at all.
I hope you like it!
>> ARTICLE
You put a new meaning to

>Source: 1000 hours in Paint.
>> ARTICLE
amazing effort.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the One Punch Vi parody I saw on League sub. That shit was beautiful. I concur, there should be more parodies.

Nice job on yours. 
>> ARTICLE
Hey man, really enjoyed the video, very nice job. I was wondering as a person who has a small but burning desire to make animated videos like these, using limited sources, programs like paint since I don't have the programs which the "pros" use. Which version of Sony Vegas were you using for this video? I looked up the products and there is a bunch of different types varying from different prices (20$-800$). I'm okay with spending my hard worked cash for a program like this, which gives me that "edge" I need to make nice looking videos, like yours, using only simple programs. I'd appreciate any feedback.

Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays to you.
>> ARTICLE
IIRC Gimp/some other animation softwares have free copies available.    

Or you could just get a borrow it from a friend on the internet. 
>> ARTICLE
I would also recommend Sony Movie Studio. It's pretty much the downgraded version of Vegas (at a lot cheaper) but has most of its features that you'll use (no freeform masking).
>> ARTICLE
You could always get a 'totally legit' copy
>> ARTICLE
The best free option I know of is Da Vinci Resolve
>> ARTICLE
I am using Sony Vegas Pro. I can totally recommend it, without it this wouldn't have been possible to make. Free programs like Windows Movie Maker are no match for this. But the price is indeed high.  
I think there is a free demo version for 30 days(?) which you should try, it's quite easy to get into it. A similar program would be Adobe After Effects, but the price is nearly the same I think.  
Btw. happy cake day :)
>> ARTICLE
I fully agree. Try it out for 30 days first.
>> ARTICLE
Adobe After Effects is not the same thing. Adobe After Effects is a composting program, not an editing program. It's used for special effects and making significant edits to small portions of video, where an editing program like Sony Vegas or Adobe Premiere is primarily for putting clips together and adding superficial edits, like text or pictures overlaying the video, or picture-in-picture display. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, you are right, I mixed up After Effects and Premiere. My fault.
>> ARTICLE
No problem, just didn't want someone buying an expensive composting program expecting it to be ANYTHING like Sony Vegas. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude, I am genuinely impressed by this, that was really a job well done. 
>> ARTICLE
You drew that with a mouse? I'm quitting my "profession" as an artist.

You forgot... Erm... Here. \

No, I think he's drowning.

She's bratty but not a tsundere. 
>> ARTICLE
She will be.
>> ARTICLE
She's a Yandere like Yuno from Mirai Nikki. Won't give details, go read the webcomic.

Definitely not Tsundere. 
>> ARTICLE
Webcomic's not over by a long shot.
>> ARTICLE
[Webcomic spoilers](/s "Nope. Unless she redeems herself this arc, she's a controlling psycho bitch")
>> ARTICLE
She will. She's too popular to throw away so easily.
>> ARTICLE
[webcomic spoilers](/s "that's unfortunate. she ought to go over to mob psycho and have mob teach her some life lessons. It's probably better for him to do it than caped baldy")
>> ARTICLE
There's been ton of hints she actually does care and is a well done tsundere if you pay attention.
>> ARTICLE
There's no question about whether she cares. [Webcomic spoilers](/s "She is a soft yandere, for all intents and purposes. The main thing that separates her from someone like yuno is that she makes sure she doesn't kill people. That doesn't stop her from being a psychotic bitch. That's how you would describe a person who attacks anyone in their way in order to kidnap an unwilling family member.")
>> ARTICLE
Best girl is Fubuki, though
>> ARTICLE
FUBOOTY BEST GIRL
>> ARTICLE
sorry but [fubuki has already been recognized by our lord and savior as best girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4PO9wI1K5Y)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but what about ONE's opinion?
>> ARTICLE
Probably Fubuki. Tatsumaki is a little shit right now in the webcomic. 
>> ARTICLE
If Murata is our lord and savior, then who is ONE?
>> ARTICLE
ONE  = God. 

Murata = jesus aka lord and savior

Given God's silence on this issue, all the guidance we can hope for will come from our lord and savior, Murata. 
>> ARTICLE
If ONE is God the Father, Murata is Jesus, then who is the Holy Spirit?
>> ARTICLE
Madhouse
>> ARTICLE
I would argue for shingo natsume instead
>> ARTICLE
Wrap it up boys. Unload your guns, the treaty has been signed. Best girl confirmed by Murata 
>> ARTICLE
I want to say that this guy kept with the webcomic level drawing tradition for Tatsumaki.
>> ARTICLE
I know but she is more cuter on ONE sensei version.
>> ARTICLE
This reminds of that one Gintama episode where the staff actually did [the OP in MS Paint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usjwNp3s94c).
>> ARTICLE
I laughed pretty hard
>> ARTICLE
Thats some Gainax level of quality control there. 

Was that just them poking fun at Gainax? 
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, it was a reference to dialogue from within the show, although I could very well be wrong since I haven't watched it (yet?).
>> ARTICLE
[Gintama spoilers](/s "This is from the popularity poll arc. People could vote for their favorite Gintama characters, and in this arc the characters complain about the rankings they got and eventually start trying to take out each other to improve their own ranking. Since the guy who draws the original manga also appears as a character in Gintama and scored relatively high in the ranking, one of the other characters attacked, which caused the animation to go haywire.")
>> ARTICLE
They do stuff like this all the time. Like some episodes are just characters talking with a single shot of a building, the scene never changes. Throughout the scene they'll complain about the animators being lazy or the studio is going broke.

Gintama is pretty tongue in cheek and pokes at the industry a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Man I really need to start watching this show. 300 episodes so daunting tho @.@
>> ARTICLE
You can't binge watch it, I tried and felt like dying. Don't get me wrong, it's a great show but you can't watch 15 episodes in a row without your brain turning to mush. Watch it in bursts every week over a period of time until you catch up. This allows you to watch other anime (or do other stuff quite frankly) and continue watching this on the side.
>> ARTICLE
> but you can't watch 15 episodes in a row without your brain turning to mush.

Why's that? How is it more difficult to binge than any other show on the planet?
>> ARTICLE
your face will hurt
>> ARTICLE
I can very much confirm that.

Source: Face still hasn't recovered, I'm now considering surgery.
>> ARTICLE
Bigger series like Gintama and One Piece are actually great. Why? Unending content that you can take your own time to enjoy.

Want to watch 2 episodes today? Go ahead. Want to watch 10? Go ahead. Don't have time to watch one today? No problem.

Because of the length of the series, you don't run into shitty problems like, "Shit, this series ended, now I need to look for another series to watch at my pace."

Haven't you ever felt you don't want a series to end? Now you can experience it. Instead of "300 episodes is daunting" it will become "there are only 300 episodes? GIMME MORE"

Hope this helps.
>> ARTICLE
I'm only 10 episodes in and I can tell you that it is already worth it. If you don't want to keep watching nobody is forcing you to watch all 300 :) But I have a feeling I'm not going to want to stop any time soon

The tatsumaki part was the fucking best dude. 10/10

I love how some scenes are extremely accurate and some are extremely ''paint-y''

amazing

The whole time I was wondering if you were going to animate licenseless rider. You pulled through OP. It had me cracking up. Pelvic-trust-licenseless rider.
>> ARTICLE
I don't get it. Looked like the original to me.
>> ARTICLE
Oh look, ONE did the opm op
>> ARTICLE
I fucking respect you.

I don't know whats better, Tatsumaki, or Mumen Rider grinding on that bicycle seconds before her.

This is fantastic can you share some of the key frames as hig res pics?
for example saitama punching star face?

ofc, here you go: http://i.imgur.com/YrBXYdo.png

Best part of the original OP, Speedo Starface attacking Saitama with a butter knife.

thats fantastic

11/10, would watch again.

You, uh, probably shouldn't have used the original song..
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the video will probably get deleted because of copyright soon :/ But without the song it isn't even half as good. Do you have an idea how to solve this?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe you'll get lucky since it seems they haven't been taking them down ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixXqHh_Bts8)).

As for a solution, altering the audio is your only bet ([like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQG6n35PKuI)).
>> ARTICLE
Some videos got taken down, like One Punch Vi, others didn't. It probably depends on popularity and luck I think.  
For now I will just hope I'm lucky. And for future projects I might use the reddit sings version of songs. According to  some sources changing speed or pitch of the song doesn't work anymore. 
>> ARTICLE
our reddit sings has gotten taken down before though
>> ARTICLE
REPLACE IT WITH A KAZOO VERSION
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to DEEN

That syncing with the song holy moly...

I appreciate your use of the camera, OP. Nicu.

quality annie may

Mumen rider. Stahp.

The running at 0:26 is so funny.

We need a GIF of the scene where Saitama is running on water

This is what they'd get if they had asked ONE to do the OP instead of madhouse.

It looked like Mumen Rider was just humping the air there I love it!

The running at 2:26 nearly killed me
>> ARTICLE
it that you ONE?
>> ARTICLE
That was amazing

That's freaking awesome
Now do Owari no seraph in paint please ^^

Well that was fucking awesome!
>> ARTICLE
Way better than anything I could do, I love it! And Tatsumaki is the most show accurate character, it's like you traced her, it's perfect.

I was expecting to laugh the whole time but as soon as the song got going I found myself getting super into it anyways.

The theme song always gets me pumped!

Hahahha nice =D It reminded me of "paint" times on Windows

This is hilarious!

this is so amazing

I swear, OP just copy pasted Tornado from the actual OP into this.

>> ARTICLE
This is the only thing that is holding me back from gun-jumping at this awesome news.

The animation production has to do the manga justice to capture the true One-Punch Man feel!
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if doing the manga justice will be possible considering how beautiful it is, lets at least hope it captures at least a good portion of what the manga is like. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda hope it looks similar to the original artwork where it looks like it was done by a guy doodling at work. I think it makes the Saitama even more ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
The redraw does a good job of playing up villains; I like the contrast between Saitama and everything around him. The anime could work either way.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh man, this has me feeling pretty split. On one hand, One Punch Man anime, but on the other hand, it's really going to suffer not having Murata's artwork. Just as ES21 did.

Edit: if they don't get Sugita to voice Saitama, this will be dead to me.
>> ARTICLE
> Sugita 

I think Abe Atsushi (Touma from Index/Railgun) would be a better fit for Saitama. He's got the happy-go-lucky voice down.
>> ARTICLE
Sugita's voice is too saucy for Saitama, I'm expecting someone more like Osaka Ryouta (Maou from Hataraku). You want a traditional MC voice without the recent lightness ones

...inb4 Yoshitsugu because fuck you
>> ARTICLE
Anything but Yoshitsugu please... He's in everything...
>> ARTICLE
Anyone but Yoshitsugu. I really don't want Kirito and Saitama to have the same voice.
>> ARTICLE
Sugita just has that amazing sense of sarcasm among his voice that I feel would be perfect for Saitama. 

I'm a Sugita fanboy though, so it is what it is. 
>> ARTICLE
> I'm a Sugita fanboy though

Sugita+Gintama+One Piece I think we would get along just fine.

[...](http://i.imgur.com/4MmX4zh.webm)
>> ARTICLE
Can't forget Samurai Flamenco, JoJo, Haruhi, or hell I even watch Tokyo Encounter like that is just Sugita playing video games with his bros. 
>> ARTICLE
Recently I have only really heard him as supporting or minor characters. Luckily the new season of Gintama and the Haruhi spinoff Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu start this spring so I can't wait.

It isn't everyday that Tokyo Encounter is mentioned which reminds me I need to get around to catching up.

>> ARTICLE
Hiroshi Kamiya... Speed of Sound Sonic... gimme  _ 
>> ARTICLE
If they had Sugita as Saitama and Kamiya as Genos I might never stop laughing for the rest of eternity. 

(I started watching Arakawa Under the Bridge for the sole reason that it had scenes of back and forth dialogue between the 2)
>> ARTICLE
Kamiyan is too light for Geno, probably even for Sonic as well
>> ARTICLE
I'd have to agree, but still, a man can dream.

I always picture Sonic with Kamiya's voice cause he looks a lot like Yato.

After reading the article, it seems like Murata is really excited about the anime and will be heavily involved in its production. Of course he won't have much control over the production quality or artwork, but hopefully he'll ensure that it's done well :)
>> ARTICLE
I mean, that's great and all but there's just such a slim chance that it could hold up to his drawings. I'm pretty burnt on what happened to ES21, it really made me mad that people pretty much discard it because of the anime. I have a lot of respect for the (in this case not really but still) original artist and ensuring that their work gets translated correctly to animation.

Bottom line I think people really aughta read it, because Yusuke Murata is really fucking good at drawing manga. I'm definitely happy for wherever this adaptation takes us though.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the Anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'm burning through ES21 right now...is it worth watching the Anime if I enjoyed it?

I'll admit, I was a bit turned off by its quality and odd VA choices.

>> ARTICLE
Another thing is they tried to make the animes focus target a young audience, I feel as if that and the art killed that anime for the Manga fans. 

Eyeshield 21 is my favorite Manga.

I loved the Anime and bought the manga later and loved it also.

Well, to be honest, Murata really excels at using manga as a medium to its full potential with his artwork. I think no matter how good the anime turns out, it still won't be able to truly portray the beautiful artwork in the manga. So in that respect, I think you'll end up getting disappointed no matter what, even if a studio like Madhouse ends up picking it up. I'd say just try and view the anime as its own thing, because it really won't be like the manga's artwork (though maybe I can somehow be proven wrong). 
>> ARTICLE
I think you know as well as I do how hard it is to view it as it's own thing, especially when it's a series you really enjoy!

I completely get where you're coming from, I should put my biases aside for it. It's just hard not to get swept up in.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I think that if the anime itself is well done, then even if it doesn't necessarily portray the beauty of the manga but still receives high praise through its own merits, it won't be too bad. 

But I get that nothing is worse than when an anime adaptation doesn't properly represent a manga, and people criticize the entire series (both the anime AND the manga), for faults found purely within the anime. Lets just hope that's not what will happen here. 
>> ARTICLE
Just woke my roommates I was so excited about this, here are some gifs made from the manga to get you an idea of what you're getting into.

All right I'm honestly asking this and not meaning to ask in a 
disrespectful manner or anything, but what's so good about One Punch Man?

I'm aware it has great artwork, but besides that what about the story? Doesn't it get repetitive all the time, isn't it just a guy who defeats everyone in one punch what more is there? Idk because everyone seems to hype it, maybe I'm missing something as I haven't read it.  
>> ARTICLE
The great artwork version is a redrawn form of the original webcomic by ONE.

Onepunch man is one of the funniest manga I have ever read and makes fun of standard anime/manga tropes at every turn.
>> ARTICLE
Well even the manga recognizes that an unstoppable power is boring. The MC says as much. It's more about the comedy and characters (and murata art).
>> ARTICLE
The series is less about the fights and more about how other people (both other Superheroes and the population at large) view and interact with Saitama.  I don't think I'm allowed to link you directly but chapter 34.55 (a no-spoilers side story) will give you a great idea about what the manga's about.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I guess I'll give it a go then. I'll have to read it to understand it I guess and the art is superb. Brb, reading One Punch Man from chapter 1.   
>> ARTICLE
Could you PM it to me?
>> ARTICLE
Batoto is the site that /r/manga uses. /R/anime mods would be asses to bitch about me telling avout Batoto though
>> ARTICLE
It is about a guy that defeats everyone with one punch... for the first few chapters. Then the story branches out towards the struggles of the other heroes; that's about when you start to get a sense of just how powerful Saitama is. Strangely enough, the story sometimes blurs the line between what constitutes a hero, and what is a villain. It's a comedy with some philosophical undertones, presented in beautiful artwork.
>> ARTICLE
The main character is hilarious. While Saitama is an OP badass, he's kind of there for comedic relief. It's kind of difficult to explain all of the great qualities, but I encourage you to try reading the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it doesn't just focus on the MC all the time. And to be honest, he has his own checks and balances. The first thing that makes it so good is the fact that the premise sounds so... plotless, and yet the actual story is ridiculously good. If I had to describe it: it's a comedy, but it does drama better than a vast majority of manga at the same time. Additionally, Murata's artwork in the redo version just elevates it to a god tier story. Murata's artwork is actually so good that I can't be excited for the anime. There's probably a 90% chance that the anime will not look as good as Murata's artwork, and for that matter it might not even represent the action as well as his still scenes.

Anyway, as with everything: [there's only one way to find out for yourself if it's good or not](http://bato.to/read/_/164083/onepunch-man_ch1v3_by_boon-scanlation).

Well I'll be damned. I really hope they can do Murata's artwork justice.

Or it's gonna be a 5-minute per episode flash anime based on ONE's artwork :)

It's easy. Just use the pages as key frames.

Unless you're referring to the original ONE manga, then im not sure, but for the other one: Nope, although thankfully they're easy to purchase since they're on [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/One-Punch-Man-Vol-1-ONE-ebook/dp/B00I9IO7FE). The scans you see on mangahere and stuff are illegal.

To be fair, since MapleStory is basically a wide open MMO so there was just nothing substantive to adapt, that and the fact that it was before MadHouse's prime (which is RIGHT NOW seeing as they finished HxH in 2014, made Wolf Children in 2012, and are finishing up Parasyte).

Why not David Production? Animation similar to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure would be awesome
>> ARTICLE
I think it's unlikely, they have JoJo on their hands and hasn't exactly been the most productive of studios outside of that franchise.

Unlikely, but not impossible! I mean, Diomeda barely did 3 anime a year and suddenly they're doing [Kantai Collection](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21511/Kantai_Collection:_KanColle), [Binan Koukou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/27727/Binan_Koukou_Chikyuu_Bouei-bu_LOVE!), [Fafnir](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24873/Juuou_Mujin_no_Fafnir) and [World Break](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22663/Seiken_Tsukai_no_World_Break) in a single season

Seeing as how the announcement said it'd be announced at a Bandai event, I'd imagine they'd be having Sunrise do it.

Which is perfectly fine in my book.

No. Any studio that puts out an abomination [like this one](http://i.imgur.com/b8roGj4.jpg) is automatically disqualified in my eyes.

GAHHHH

what the hell is that?

holy crap.

It's Cross Ange, an unholy walking disaster.

That I just can't stop watching, because it's so fucking good.
>> ARTICLE
[Why I'm still watching Ange](http://i.imgur.com/lpEguBI.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Sunrise is great. I'd wish people learn that Madhouse and Ufotable aren't the only talented studios out there.
>> ARTICLE
I think White Fox is pretty great, and A-1 can be good but they vary.  
>> ARTICLE
Ufotable are capable of putting out stinkers too, just take a look at Gyo for example. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think highly of Ufotable either because the range of what they're adapting is far too narrow for my taste (not to mention that I never got the Type-Moon craze to begin with, but that's another story). I'm all for Madhouse, Bones and Mappa, assuming the last one has enough budget for a given project.
>> ARTICLE
I have to say, based on the seven episodes i've watched of SnB:G so far, if Mappa is give a good budget, they can put out something truly beautiful. I adore the animation quality in the series, it's so fucking great.
>> ARTICLE
The individual studio that made Cross Ange is getting shut down after it finishes

And it's directed by a hack. 

Nice try tho. 
>> ARTICLE
And nothing of value will be lost.


>> ARTICLE
I like watching Fukuda trainwrecks. That's just me though.

[You seem to be under the impression that Sunrise is a single studio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_(company\)#Studios)

Edit: Besides, they did not only do Cross Ange (which has been plagues by production issues).

Just because a company had one letdown, doesn't mean all of their other works will be just as bad too.

I might just watch gundam build fighters now
>> ARTICLE
Why are we showing off Build Fighters when we could be showing off [Unicorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYtxTJfcaX8)? (SPOILERS for episodes 1 and 2)

Build Fighters is flashy, but Unicorn (also recent) is much, much, much better animated.
>> ARTICLE
Come on, man... if you're gonna post a video of Unicorn, don't make it an AMV. At least link a trailer [or something.](http://youtu.be/CNgatOvVdlU)
>> ARTICLE
I wanted a decent amount and decent variety of 1080 footage. The trailers lack variety, and thanks to copyright claims there isn't many individual scenes left that aren't 360.
>> ARTICLE
I wanted to, but Gundam Unicorn was a high-budget OVA/movie series, and not a TV anime.

Add Gintama to that list as well.

Gintama team might actually be a good fit comedy style wise. Just need other teams to help out with the actual combat stuff

Emmm. Wait. It's actually happening? You mean, seriously? All these years we made fun of it never happening, and now it just...*happens?*

Is there even enough material for an anime? , at least ONE is participating in production meetings 
>> ARTICLE
I'd say there's at least enough material for 12 episodes. You might be able to make 24 if you really push the side hero action in the whole sea invasion arc.
>> ARTICLE
I recon you could go to 24 if you go off the original
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's true. I imagine since this is through Shuiesha it's leaning more towards Murata's direction- despite ONE being in production meetings.

Honestly, you could easily do 24 if you went to the end of Garou, no problem.

Don't forget just *how many* fight scenes there are in this. There are a lot, and that takes a lot of time.

When that thread about "your Half Life 3 of Anime" hit the front page of this sub yesterday I immediately thought of One Punch Man.
>> ARTICLE
Likewise! But now to see news that one of our favorite Mangas is getting an anime makes me all giddy on the inside 
>> ARTICLE
Does that mean, Half Life 3 confirmed?
>> ARTICLE
 The only studio worthy enough for this is David Production as far as I know. When you ask me to name an over-the-top shounen series with fantastic artwork, humor, and battles, I'll say Jojo. The *other* answer is One Punch Man.

Nevertheless, here's a [fanmade OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z_AF8iIASA) for your hype.

They MUST use that as the OP. I can't imagine it any other way.

Probably the reason why you aren't working in that industry then. Have faith in them

Captain here :
[True source for the fanmade OP] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihiVQwHftU), which started from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl0gRhqrOFM).

I just created a reddit account to give due creddit to those guys. Shindehai deserve to be known imho.

I started the manga only because of this fanmade OP. No regrets.
>> ARTICLE
And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ur7Vae4ros) is a redrawn opening of Majin Bone with OPM and most likely an accurate representation of what the anime will look/feel like compared to the manga. 

(to clarify I love the video)

>> ARTICLE
But most of them have a lot of potential for action scenes.
>> ARTICLE
There is already a [fan animation](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/653685) that is pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that this is going to go well. Something about the panel play and the way that it adds to the deadpan humor and weirdness of the manga is going to be lost on an anime. Over-the-top, full page drawings of enemies that end up being obliterated on the next page to 10+ drawings just to zoom in from space or high in the sky to one scene of something like Saitama picking his nose just won't feel right on the screen I think.

My hopes for this are really low, but I'll be extremely happy if they pull it off well. I'd even be happy if they added filler in the form of more nonsense every day fights or just Saitama dealing with his lackluster ratings and life, as long as they pulled it off well. That being said, an entire arc dedicated to Watchdog-man would win me over quickly, also.

that's the problem of reddit in general

Regardless of upvotes and downvotes, if this many people in the thread are saying to read the manga and that an anime couldn't possibly replicate the experience I'll trust them. Just because its a "hive mind" opinion doesn't make it wrong. Karma is just an imaginary number that means nothing anyhow.

I may have to read this now based on the amount of hype it's generating here. It always looked pretty interesting to me but I was put off because I thought the art wasn't very good. Apparently it's amazing though so I guess I was wrong I'll give it a shot. Sounds cool guys!

You're probably thinking of ONE's One Punch Man where it has his signature horrible (yet fun) art.  Yusuke Murata, of Eyeshield 21 fame, re-draws all of ONE's art and it is absolutely glorious.
>> ARTICLE
Our prayers have been answered! All the fucking yes!!!!! YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
People in here are all skeptical about the budget for this. If this is as popular as I've heard it is in Japan, then the budget will NOT be a problem. They will have lots to spend on it. 

Also, if you look at Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (done by Studio David, who I hope does OPM) they apparently had a low budget and in my opinion, it looks great. They had enough to make an extra ED for use in one episode too.

Best news I've heard this year so far.
>> ARTICLE
See I'm pumped as all hell for this but this is the same thing with Berserk or Vagabond, where this anime won't be the same because the art for the manga is at a level so high I don't think anyone can do it justice unless you poured a TOOON of money on it.

I woke up to some really good news!
>> ARTICLE
- Bones
- Madhouse
- Sunrise
- *Maybe* Production IG
- *Maybe* MAPPA

Those are probably the only studios I'll ever want them the consider. I wouldn't mind Pierrot if they make it a long-running series, which is doubtful. 
>> ARTICLE
No trigger?
>> ARTICLE
I thought about studios like Trigger and A-1, but I honestly don't really like how they animated action scenes. Trigger still uses a lot of still frames that slide, and they (as well as A-1) almost always "breaks down" images in order to give them movement.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Just because it's Bandai, doesn't mean it'll be Sunrise.

For example: Eureka7 and Ghost in the Shell can also be considered under "Bandai Visual," and so is Junketsu no Mari and Kuroko no Basket. Hell, even Girls und Panzer can be considered one.

EDIT: Wait, now I read the article that was linked in the comments. I'd be happy if it was confirmed to be Sunrise, if it was the right studio...although I'm fairly confident any studio will have consistent quality.
>> ARTICLE
Now the question is, which studio from Sunrise if that's the case? Fairly unlikely to be studio 8 since there's not enough cute girls, and 1 always does gundam stuff


...Gintama team!?
>> ARTICLE
Studio 8's only real "moe cute girls" show is Love Live. Other than that, they've done Buddy Complex, Accel World, Horizon, Mai-Hime...fairly normal series. I think it would be best for the world if Studio 8 gets the job, but I'm *sure* they're busy with the Love Live movie. Or maybe (hopefully) some sequel of either AW or Horizon.

Studio 1 is, as you said, most likely is going to be busy with Gundam. Either ORIGIN or maybe a GBF sequel or *something* Gundam-related.

Gintama's team will probably be busy with Gintama (Studio 5), so I wouldn't mind a Studio 6 (TIGER&BUNNY) or 7 (Sacred Seven).
>> ARTICLE
>Buddy Complex, Accel World, Horizon, Mai-Hime..

All have cute girls in it if you think about it, multiple in fact for the last 3.
>> ARTICLE
And so does One Punch Man. I'd say [these](http://i.imgur.com/8Vagswg.jpg) two [girs](http://blog-imgs-75.fc2.com/j/u/m/jumpmatome2ch/20150208053802068.jpg) are quite cute.

In fact, so do almost any other anime. Gintama has even more than all of them combined probably.
>> ARTICLE
They don't appear until quite late into the season, so I don't think the studio would be satisfied with drawing dudes the whole time
>> ARTICLE
The entire Buddy Complex with all that "Connective Dio" and "Acception" was so...you know. So I don't think they mind.
>> ARTICLE
At least there was a cute girl early, instead of just dudes the whole time

Speed of Sound Sonic and Licenseless Rider hype

Licenseless Rider is at the top of the thread, all is as it should be

Licenseless Rider kyaaa~

[](#hypeoverload)

And everyone knew, there was no chance of him winning.

Licenseless Rider is being voiced by Nakamura Yuuichi too. Can he be any more based?
>> ARTICLE
Licenseless Rider is actually one of the better heroes to me even if he's not strong. He has so much passion
>> ARTICLE
He's right, but he's not strong.  That makes him a fake.  But he's a fake trying to be the real thing, which makes him better than the real thing.

He has the heart of a true hero, if not the strength.

its a running joke that he is a girl because how feminine his body could be. There are some fanart out there thats simply adding boobs onto his existing art completely transformed him into female. His personality too could make a wonderful tsundere twist to the story.

*Note: This is my own translation by ear and as such some parts may be interpreted differently by others or may even be incorrect.*

00:00: Overwhelming power is a dull thing.  
00:05: What an enormous explosion we've just witnessed! Casualties by the monster has reached record highs and the body count is still rising! The association has just issued the monster a top-level ranking...!  
00:17: [Text: Justice executed.]  
00:19: Over in one punch... again!  
00:24: I managed to become the hero I always wanted to be. However, something feels missing.  
00:32: My name is... eh?  
00:34: Pay for the damage you did to my damn roof. // Why is it that I'm never satisfied with myself?  
00:40: Please, tell me your name! I wish to become your student... as repayment. // I will destroy you. // Tell me how I can become as strong as you are.  
00:56: I perform all duties from assassination to bodyguard duty. I am the greatest ninja there is: Sonic Speed!  
1:03: I find you displeasing. Disappear from my sight.  
1:06: Unlicensed Rider, Cycler of Justice at your service!  
1:14: I no longer feel fear nor nervousness. No happiness nor anger. In exchange for power, did I lose something important as a human being?  
1:29: What sort of parts do you use, Sensei?  
1:31: I don't use any.  
1:33: Then what's with that skin-coloured armour on your head?  
1:36: That's my skin.  
1:37: Wait a minute. That would mean you're going bald at a young age.  
1:40: Yeah, I'm bald! Get off my case, goddammit!  

EDIT:  (non-licensed), not  (maskless, faceless).
>> ARTICLE
Some slight corrections, afaik in the manga they're called "Licenceless Rider" and "Speed of Sound Sonic".

For the Licenceless Rider part, it's a pun on masked rider series, I guess.  (non-licensed) and  (maskless, faceless) pronounce similar in Japanese.

Wow man, dat winning streak. No fucking pauses! It's like they turnover the torch of awesomeness to their new show every season.


Also, I am so fucking hyped about Licenseless Rider UGH.
>> ARTICLE
I have yet to see a madhouse show that surpasses Hibike!II

And I've already dropped Overlord, this season.

I just hope they don't ruin One Punch Man.
>> ARTICLE
Death Parade was kinda meh to me, how has Ore Monogatari been?
>> ARTICLE
Felt the same way, dropped it while it was airing and then ended up picking it back up when it was done. It was enjoyed and well done imo. 
>> ARTICLE
Fan-fucking-tastic. If you like romantic comedies or shoujos, I'd say it's a must watch. Really funny and sweet with actual progress. Also features one of the best wingmen in fiction, Suna Ma-bro-to
>> ARTICLE
DO YOU LIKE ACTUAL COMMUNICATION IN YOUR ROMANCES?

DO YOU LIKE LOVE TRIANGLES THAT ARE QUICKLY RESOLVED WITH LITTLE UPSET?

DO YOU WANT A ROMANCE WHERE EVERY MAJOR CHARACTER GENUINELY CARES ABOUT EACH OTHER?

DO YOU LIKE SHOWS WHERE THE PROTAGONISTS ACTUALLY PROCLAIM THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER?

If you said "YES!" to any of these questions, Ore Monogatari will probably be enjoyable for you.

Well I heard the bluray sold like 700 copies so i suppose most people don't =(

THis sounds good, I should finish it

So much. I don't usually like these super saccharine shows, but the way Ore Monogatari is unfolding is wonderful. So many overused tropes avoided or minimized.

I heavily recommend overlord. Very interesting premise with a MC who is smart and ruthless(kind of like Shiroe from Log Horizon except more on the villainous side).

Man, I literally just finished reading it yesterday. It was an amazing ride full of emotions.

Had to take a break from anime, manga, and gaming for a week after reading the series...It played with my emotions so much that I just had to take a rest.

(No spoilers pls, only up to volume 3.) I bought the first 2 volumes because I remember some threads on /a/ about it, and after reading the first chapter, I went and bought all of the volumes the next day.

Yea. Meant the total. That's not a bad price.

Oh man, we can see more voice acting stuff for Saitama. I think it sounds pretty great
>> ARTICLE
You mean he sounded pretty average. Great choice of VA by them, but I don't know how the VA feels knowing that his voice is considered as average.
>> ARTICLE
He is supposed to sound that way, it's just a job requirement to adapt. He did Tada Banri in Goden Time, so i think he can do his stuff decently. And the last line in the PV where he gets mad about Genos talking about his bald head was delivered really well.
>> ARTICLE
...Tada Banri is incredibly average too...

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it sounds just like the ''average'' bald caped hero.
>> ARTICLE
He sounds so average it's hilarious. They absolutely nailed the VA
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts exactly. PV1 sounded exactly like I had imagined Saitama.

Also, Genos is looking a lot less lame than his key visual for the anime. Awesome!
>> ARTICLE
Not very often you hear this arrangement of words :p
>> ARTICLE
Especially with such a highly hyped show
>> ARTICLE
I really hope they adapt the Sea King battle, one of my favorite parts

Licenseless Rider for the win!
>> ARTICLE
There's no way we're not getting that arc. I don't think the anime could be complete without Lord Boros, though.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah Lord Boros seems like the perfect arc to end it with [](/s "Consecutive Normal Punches"), but it really depends on the pacing and episode count. Either way its gonna be great


>> ARTICLE
Actually from one of the translators here. Saying Saitama saying 'My name is eh' means that this pretty much is going to happen and we are going to see beyond Lord Boros arc. Because he is only named 'Caped Baldy' after that battle.
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "Near the end of the PV it looks like they show Saitamas moon jump that happened during the Lord Boros fight.")
>> ARTICLE
[But](/s "It also looks like him jumping out of the giant's crater")
>> ARTICLE
Boros would be a fairly natural closing point and given that the PV had a glimpse of Tornado of Terror then it would be fairly safe to assume they are at least getting to that arc.

I'm just slightly sad we are not likely to get any Blizzard of Hell.
>> ARTICLE
The soundtrack sounds really nice. If the show maintains the same soundtrack quality, it'll join the ranks of anime with epic OSTs
>> ARTICLE
I wonder who the composer is. I'm guessing Hiroyuki Sawano from what I just heard.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope it is.He has never disappointed me with a soundtrack so far.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, the guitar sounds far too traditional... and he hasn't worked with Madhouse before, as far as I know. Still, I might be wrong, and I don't have a substitute answer!
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he has, but it's not like he's bound to just one studio either. Considering his popularity I wouldn't be surprised if it was him.

The bit at 55 seconds really reminds me of him for some reason though. But I'm not sure what it reminds me of.
>> ARTICLE
i like the fact that they keep the anticlimatic moments for saitama, good job madhouse!
>> ARTICLE
Do we know how many episodes this will run for ?
>> ARTICLE
Not confirmed yet, I believe.
>> ARTICLE
from the stuff they showed in the PV im guessing its 24. Because they showed some advanced stuff already
>> ARTICLE
I highly, highly doubt it, but I really hope we get to see Boros.
>> ARTICLE
If they end it after the fight with Boros, I'd be satisfied. I'd like to see more, of course, but seeing that fight animated by Madhouse... *heavy breathing*

If Fubuki is there then I hope we get Accelerate... that was just amazing to read.

Me first hearing about OPM: I don't understand why OPM is considered good. I mean, c'mon, it's about a guy who is so strong he defeats everyone in single hit. That sound like the worst and most boring wish fullfilment fantasy ever.

Me after reading Murata's version in one sitting: *AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa*

Well, to be more serious now, I still don't know *why* but between the characters and setting and humor and action scenes, it all works together so great. (please don't fuck up the anime)

It's Madhouse. You know it's going to kick ass.

I'm sure it does, but it still taints their resume a little.

The series is one of those pretty much anyone can appreciate on at least some level, not really a matter of taste. It's got a lot of heart, it's simple and easy to understand, it's funny and despite its boring-sounding premise, very engaging.

Also the action is really cool.

Licenseless Rider is a very important character who comes in at key parts, and in my opinion is much better than most of those S-rank "heroes"(compaired to licenseless rider that s stands for scrubs)

Licenseless Rider if definitely way above the other heroes in terms of character. I mean minor as in he's not apart of the main ensemble of characters that Saitama usually hangs out with.

It's pretty cool or worrying, the fact that I understood most of the PV only having watched anime. Psyched about this show!

I never read One-Punch Man but im excited for this since ive heard alot about it
>> ARTICLE
Highly recommend it. Probably one of the most hyped up and respected adaptions this entire year. Go read Murata Yusuke's version first (the manga) and then continue with the ONE version (the webcomic), or better yet, switch around from both versions because are both vastly different yet still the same but is still the one of the best series you will EVER read.
>> ARTICLE
Wait a sec, there are *two* versions of the manga? 

I only read one, can you provide links please?
>> ARTICLE
[Here's the webcomic] (http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Onepunch-Man-ONE) It's VERY far ahead of the manga. So start at I think around chapter 50.
>> ARTICLE
Onepunch-man (ONE) is the original, and it goes many chapters beyond the current "oh my god this art is fantastic" remake.
>> ARTICLE
ITS AMAZING
>> ARTICLE
And the art of the Murata version (which the anime is adapting) is fucking godly.

This is going to be soo good.

From what I can make out in the first few moments of the PV, it seems that he's doesn't like the fact that he is too powerful. It's boring. 

Edit: I didn't mean the show is boring lol, I'm just saying what he said
>> ARTICLE
The side hero's is where the real action is.
>> ARTICLE
The best thing about OPM isn't necessarily how Saitama feels about his power its other character's reaction to it too. Its my favorite manga to date.
>> ARTICLE
He's called One-Punch Man for a reason.   
>> ARTICLE
There is a whole underlying thing in the manga where he is always trying to find someone stronger than himself so that its not over in one punch. He finds some people eventually that get close - but then he gets 'serious' and ends it instantly.
>> ARTICLE
Even then, its more of a casual seriousness :)
>> ARTICLE
That's the point. He's so powerful he's bored with it. The series is a comedy and regularly parodies how stupid power scaling can get
>> ARTICLE
That is exactly the story.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY CRAP everyone's voices fit the characters so perfectly. The art looks great, the music seems to fit well, and it looks like the humor will still be there. I'm super hyped for this!!

Totally reminds me of a grown up version of [Caillou](http://i.imgur.com/LOgSS7hh.jpg).

I can't get it out of my head and with how awful of a show Caillou was, it's ruining this for me. (I babysat some kids almost daily for a coupe years and I had to watch so much of that horrible horrible show. Burned into my memories forever. )

Thank god while I was a kid I saw how god awful it was and stopped watching it. I now have few memories or the abomination.

SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT JUST SHIT MY PANTS OH MY
WHY CAN'T OCTOBER COME SOONER 
>> ARTICLE
THE HYPE IS REAL

I'm more excited for Licenseless Rider and Tornado of Terror than the main 3 somehow!

I'm so happy Madhouse got my favorite manga.
>> ARTICLE
This looks great.  I wasn't particularly interested in OPM, but it seems like an anime version of Hancock, so my interest has been piqued. 
>> ARTICLE
That's... yeah, actually, kind of. He is more heroic than Hancock, but they both have a complete 'no fucks given' attitude.
>> ARTICLE
What's the joke in the end? I guess he's asking why he has no hair?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, he was asking if he lost his hair due to his superpower. Then he said he didnt have super powers. And then something about just being bald. IIRC from the manga
>> ARTICLE
He's asking what parts he uses (for his head) and he replies that he doesn't use any (cyborg) parts, he's just a baldy.
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone link the first pv?
>> ARTICLE
If that's not Sawano, I will eat my shoes. Everything sounds exactly the same, as always. I was hoping OPM would get something unique. It deserves it.

Either way, this is looking great. Definitely my most anticipated show.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck I am so fucking fuckity hyped right fucking now holy fuck fucks this fucks fucks.

Licenseless Rider uses his bike of justice to stop crime!

not really, i think that's how the manga translates it

I was afraid they'd get Sawano for the soundtrack, and that sounded 100% Sawano to my ears. I don't think I've really liked a soundtrack from him since Attack on Titan. Woohoo now this show can sound like generic shounen action title 2033, regardless of whether that's an accurate reflection of the content of the show.

I'm so fucking hype for this my ears are bleeding.

Oh man I can't wait for this its going to be so hilarious time to see Caped Baldie in action.

HYPE!
>> ARTICLE
I am amusing its like s-CRY-ed where there is a limited amount of punches but super OP?
>> ARTICLE
Just the fact you mentioned S-CRY-ed makes me very happy.
>> ARTICLE
No, main guy is basically just a god in human form where physical power is concerned. Its actually played for a gag most of the time while the drama unfolds around other characters who aren't able to one shot everything.
>> ARTICLE
CGI....what the fuck!
>> ARTICLE
Looks good. But the trailer is a bit too serious.
>> ARTICLE
OPM needs to be serious as well as comedic. The way it takes itself seriously is also a joke, because the content is so utterly ridiculous. That's how Genos works - he's so serious and earnest that he's a foil for Saitama's hilarious pragmatism. 

The show won't be *too* serious. Don't worry. 
>> ARTICLE
Idk, I think I am one of the few not interested.
>> ARTICLE
I am interested but it seems like it's again a series that gets overhyped by people who read the source material.
>> ARTICLE
Then go read the source material instead of making inane comments on how you don't like stuff because other people do you twat lol.  
>> ARTICLE
I said nothing about liking it or not, though. I simply don't care for now.

> you twat lol

Really? This sub sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
so why did you feel compelled to come tell everyone who is excited for it, that you don't know anything about it and you don't care? because you are a twat. lol
>> ARTICLE
Same here, people are hyping it up too much.
>> ARTICLE
If you read the manga, you'll know what all the fuss is about. Or not.
>> ARTICLE
looks like genos got the short end of the animation budget...


>> ARTICLE
We'll see. If they do Accelerate, or some of the better training sessions, he'll have some amazing moments for animation to shine. 
>> ARTICLE
All the budget went to that shiny head.

And Genos looks badass don't know what you are talking about.
>> ARTICLE
I can still wait. I like the manga but I don't like madhouse 
>> ARTICLE
>I don't like madhouse

Why?
>> ARTICLE
Idk tbh the only show I like mahouka 
>> ARTICLE
Don't down vote this guy for answering a question. Yes, Mahouka was awful, but it was also a faithful adaptation that was competently produced. 
>> ARTICLE
Everyone just hates Painn unfortunately, which sucks because he's the most earnest person on this sub.
>> ARTICLE
Everything by Madhouse has been faithfully adapted and competently produced. The fact that he singled out Mahouka means he likes the story and characters more than the other shows that actually have good story and characters.
>> ARTICLE
Really, the one show you like by Madhouse is fucking Mahouka???
>> ARTICLE
I know right. It's weird. I just like tatsuya and how he smites people. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, Saitama from One-Punch Man is more OP than Tatsuya, so there's that...
>> ARTICLE
I know I never said I hate OPM I just said I don't like madhouse 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that makes sense if you like OP protags who go around smiting people
>> ARTICLE
why? They made DN, HxH, Monster, Beck, Death Parade, Nana and One Outs and that's just the tip of the iceberg, most of these are generally well received
>> ARTICLE
DN haven't seen it yet, HxH don't like it at all, monster didn't like it that much, death parade was ok, the other two haven't seen
>> ARTICLE
So the two most well received anime... *ever*... you just flat out don't like. I mean, it's fine that you have different opinions, but just... lol
>> ARTICLE
MRW best bro /u/darthnick426 is guest of the week!

[](#jibrilaww)

On the OPM review: I really like how you touched upon the adaptation being almost too faithful the web comic so it leaves us with lose ends that won't be cleared up in the anime. It's very true and a very valid criticism that I have with OPM too as well and it's an interesting downside to the mostly positive aspect of staying following the source material closely.


Somehow it's only fitting that Best Bro has a super suave voice and when he says "you're goddamn right" it sounds like Troy Baker. 

[MFW darthnick's voice](#flattered)

Oh nice, I just started the Fate route less than half an hour ago. Apparently Saber will be great, but I don't know. This podcast was great to hear as always.

> I just started the Fate route less than half an hour ago.

[Go on.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyfdcoocex8)

I'm sorry I don't watch moe. Blame my best friend for starting my anime career with shonen. The first couple anime series I ever watched were: Inuyasha, Yu Yu Hakusho, FMA 2003, Bleach, and Darker than Black. Literally never watched a moe or SoL show until last year. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm in the prologue now so I have a long way to go lol. 

I'd recommend some moe shows that still have a decent story outside of the cute faces, but you already watch those. Gakkou Gurashi has a fantastic story with cute and relaxing girls though, you should try that.
>> ARTICLE
/u/darthnick426 I can also recommend Gakkou Gurashi, [I even wrote a WT! for it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3mvcqm/wt_gakkou_gurashi_a_true_slice_of_life/)

Seriously, we could've devoted an entire half hour to Saber alone, but we actually managed to skim over most of it. I'm impressed with ourselves.

Basically there's some doubt over whether this claim is legit or not.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, I'll have to address that on the next episode!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I think if there's any one thing that you should refer to it's this comment:

>It's not true. This all originates from an article where a ufotable employee was interviewed, and the topic of continuation/sequels came up. The ufotable guy made a general statement about the industry, saying that these days, if an anime sells really well, a sequel is pretty much guaranteed. He made an example with FHA; if UBW sells 100k (a completely arbitrary number, representing high sales), then they would obviously make something like F/HA (or just more Fate in general). It does not mean we will definitely get FHA if UBW sells 100k; it isn't some milestone number that is required for anything.

>Sadly, people continue to spread misinformation even though haven't even read the original article.

Also if you translate the blog post (don't know Japanese though so I had to use Google) it becomes clearer that it was was more of an example of a business model than an actual guarantee.

EDIT: Holy moly, $82?! You're selling yourself way short, dude! High quality figurines of popular characters can go for $200 and those are made by friggin machines.
>> ARTICLE
The molding on figures are machine made, but up to a certain point. Fine grinding, paint, and polishing is usually by hand.
>> ARTICLE
True, but this Saitama head blows that sorta thing out of the water, and although I admit I don't know for 100% certain, I feel pretty sure the cost of those expensive figurines is artificially inflated. Otaku will buy anything, and companies know it.

It's fine, I'm not blaming them or going "darn that capitalism" -- sales like that make a lot of anime possible. Still. The Saitama bust is obviously better quality.
>> ARTICLE
They gotta make decent money somehow, considering material and labor cost is a thing. Anyone out of country pays more for obvious shipping costs, so there's that. Personally, I always thought the figure market has always been fair. Only time it isn't fair is when you missed your preorders on a single wave release item.

There are things of great quality. Max Factory has always been producing great figures of great details. Then there are some smaller companies who makes garage kit come out even better stuff, but lack the manpower. Forever never getting that Yuudachi Kai Ni by El Dorado.
>> ARTICLE
Thats what I was thinking.  I was expecting it to be a shit ton but $82 for something like this is waaaaay cheap!
>> ARTICLE
Yea $82 is way too cheap. I'd expect to pay something closer to $2000 for a bust of this size and quality. 
>> ARTICLE
Considering a high quality (mass produced) anime figurine goes for like $50-150, $82 seems like pennies for a god damn handmade custom bust.

If I had money to spare, I would commission enough to decorate my mantle lol. 
>> ARTICLE
$82 for 100 hours does seem pretty under selling yourself. 
>> ARTICLE
It's much faster now that I can base it off a completed original!

How much time did you spend on creating it though? I mean, I know you've put a lot of effort into it but I'm still [curious](http://orig08.deviantart.net/87e8/f/2015/135/0/0/i_m_curious___gif__by_earthonmars-d8nji59.gif) about how long it took you.

My most regretted drop is Hyouka at episode 1..

You can always go back, you know?
>> ARTICLE
No, he made his decision. He must stick with it.
>> ARTICLE
Easily over 100 hours. I try to give my sculptures a realistic design so the hardest part is doing multiple drafts and trying to decide on a look that I'm satisfied with. Once I'm satisfied with the basic look, the rest is just detailing and that's not too bad.
>> ARTICLE
Do you use a CAD software to visualise your sculptures? 
>> ARTICLE
No, just drafts in clay/wax that allow me to test out ideas before proceeding in a harder medium like carving stone.
>> ARTICLE
Ever gave digital sculpting a try?
>> ARTICLE
Hate it, a big part of sculpting for me is getting to work with my hands. Imo, even if it's very impressive and time-saving, I think digital sculpting lacks the soul of an artist, the small hand marks and tiny imperfections that carry the artist's physical touch to the piece's owner. Just me being sappy lol
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree. The small imperfections are always some of the best parts of any kind of crafted item. I can't even say how many times those imperfections have helped make something even better later on.
>> ARTICLE
These are the words of a man who is truly one with his medium. Well spoken.
>> ARTICLE
What tips would you recommend for a person who wants to get into sculpting? Also amazing work it really made me gasp at the quality
>> ARTICLE
A great place for beginners to start would be some Super Sculpey and [a set of these](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Set-6-Pcs-Aluminum-Polymer-Clay-Sculpting-Tools-Wax-Modeling-Molds-/190938356746?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2c74d01c0a). If you are interested in sculpting humans, there's quite a few [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m17DFYI0GLc) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvgFNmsKuQE) on Youtube to get you started. Improvement comes slow but steady, so keep at it!
>> ARTICLE
Juding from the looks I would guess that those utensils are mostly used for scraping things away? Or would you also use it a lot for pressing stuff?
>> ARTICLE
Yep, for scraping and carving away!
>> ARTICLE
Jesus, those sculptures are much cheaper than I expected considering how long it takes to make! I sound like a shill right now but I was honestly surprised. Im guessing it takes much less time replicating sculptures.
>> ARTICLE
It's much faster once I have a completed original to reference so I don't mind charging a reasonable price!
>> ARTICLE
Wow! That's ridiculously awesome!

[**Nice job!**](#helmetbro)
>> ARTICLE
Sorry to ask, but what anime is that from? I know I've seen it somewhere before, it looks very familiar.
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea. My best guess is one of the early Gundam series since it's in space and the art style looks like it could be from that era. /u/wingsoflight or /u/encoreac could correct me if I'm horribly wrong.

Hi! It's from the [2nd opening of Zeta Gundam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNAzAgkhy94) /u/Pyrelord .

Hi Graphesium, this is posted on *all* fanart submissions, so if you've already done what I'm about to ask, please ignore me!

We prefer if all fanart submissions contained:

* The name of the anime the fanart is from.

* A link back to the original artist - consider using [SauceNAO](http://saucenao.com/) to find them.

If you've already done that, good job! If not, please edit your post with the needed information.

How much extra would a custom made one cost?

If it's not based on my finished design, a custom made sculpture [starts at $800 USD](http://www.gsculpt.com/pages/commissions). Otherwise it [starts at $82](http://www.gsculpt.com/products/saitama).
>> ARTICLE
> $800 USD

[](#forgotkeys)

It's a fair prize but I don't have that kind of money laying around. Then I'll just ask you, do you have any plans on making a Lelouch (Code Geass), Kamina (TTGL) or Kaneki-Ken (Tokyo Ghoul) one?
>> ARTICLE
No, no, and yes. Kaneki is on my to-do list!

Oh sick, I really want to buy that one. Could you spoil which look you'll go for? [TG Spoiler](/s "With or without eyepatch, centipede form or regular form, Kagune exposed or hidden etc").

Wow. Please post in this sub again once you have more anime sculptures. I didn't like OPM but would gladly buy such a sculpture if I like the character.

When this is done I want one ASAP, can I prepay? I know I will forget, never check back and they will be gone by the time I find it again.

Please let me know what other anime ones you decide to work on, definitely considering getting one on display for my apartment, but I can't afford the $800 custom tag TT__TT

Hmm, I guess I can share with you my [full list of characters](http://i.imgur.com/RLOcdj3.jpg) that I'm considering :) *This only means they are on my mind and is by no means a definitive list!

Anything from evangelion and im 100% a buyer. Considering maybe buying jinx when youre done with that too. Amazing work!

God damn... I'll put in a down payment if you end up choosing any of the Evangelion ones :T

On a side note, do you do busts only? Because a full body [Riven](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xB5fqWxR7z4/maxresdefault.jpg) or Ahri would look pretty amazing.

Only busts for now, there's just so many characters I want to sculpt haha

I've been meaning to get into sculpting and had a question for you: what's carving stone? Google gives me soapstone but your site's faq made me believe it's something you can pour into a mold. Me confused.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very niche product called Winterstone, you can mold it and then carve in details like clay while it slowly dries. High learning curve and took me a lot of time to get used to it.
>> ARTICLE
Only $82???? I bet you can sell quite a few.

Great job. I would definitely buy one if I had the money

Band Of Brothers was a masterpiece for me. Then again, I was in middle school. But that show and Saving Private Ryan really opened up my love for history.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched it three times. It is absolutely deserving of the best Mini-series of all time. It's just brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah - when it holds this rating after 200,000 people even bother to vote and manage to keep the average at a 9.6, then you'll have something.
>> ARTICLE
Its Rick and Morty all over again
>> ARTICLE
To be fair to Rick and Morty it's still on a pretty amazing 9.3, and it now has a comparable number of votes to anything in the top 20 for animated tv shows. It has about 20% the number of votes The Simpsons has, for example, and more than many other higher rated shows.

It is still second in rating only to OPM, in fact (other than something called "Yup Yups" which has literally five votes...)

New shows and films do tend to get skewed too high though for sure, it's hard to say how much R&M may continue to drop, and OPM certainly will too to some extent.

RM100YRS.COM/RM4EVER
>> ARTICLE
What's the story with it's ratings?
>> ARTICLE
Basically it had a hand full of ratings at like 10 or so from super fans that skewed it to be "best rated show of all time". Which, said superfans kept constantly bringing up. Then as more people rated the show it eventually leveled out at a more realistic number.
>> ARTICLE
The baesian rating should actually do the exact opposite. If a show has very little votes, then no matter how high the rating is, the baesian skews towards the global average (cca 6.6). But the more votes a show has, the more representative the score is and the less skewed it is.

What I'm saying that is a show is getting 9.6 with very little ratings, the baesian is expected to grow even more with more votes.

However that does not take into account different types of people voting at different times.

>> ARTICLE
Rick and Morty is still at an insanely high 9.3 though.
>> ARTICLE
Because it's still considered really really good by a lot of people 
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, don't get me wrong, I agree with the score. Just was pointing out that even with a ton of ratings, it's still considered really good.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously what's so great about Rick and Morty?
>> ARTICLE
Rick and Morty basically subverts and deconstructs sci-fi concepts a whole lot better than its peers, while giving its cast human elements, though it does muck up on the latter portions. It has very good writing for a show that relies a lot on improvising.

Other than Futurama, it's hard to name a show that does what R&M is doing right now.
>> ARTICLE
It's very funny, and the characters actually develop.

(It was written by the same guy from Community so not surprised)
>> ARTICLE
It is like futurama but not futurama, while at the same time original and dank. The show itself is a paradox and thus amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen it yet, that style of cartoon really doesn't do it for me though.  I like anime because of the storytelling, and as for comedy I prefer South Park.  I am considering watching Rick and Morty though
>> ARTICLE
Well, I find it funny. That's about it. That's the whole reason I watch it anyway.
>> ARTICLE
it'll need at least 5,000 votes to rank I think. since it's only like, a fifth of the way there, it dropping is sort of a given. still wouldn't be surprised at it maintaining a high placement though.  
  
(IMDB ratings are basically like MAL ratings but even worse if you could imagine that. taking stock in what their top shows are is sort of silly)
>> ARTICLE
I don't think there's a way to say which movie or TV show is the best universally. It all comes down to opinions in the end.
>> ARTICLE
I think 25,000 is the required number to rank in the top 250.
>> ARTICLE
> I think 25,000

You're talking about votes yeah? If you look at the top 250 list you'll see shows that goes down to 7k -5k votes, so no I don't think it's 25k
>> ARTICLE
idk why you were downvoted, 5,000 is definitely the minimum number of votes
>> ARTICLE
25k for movies, while 5k for series.
>> ARTICLE
Is there a rating source anybody considers good or at least reasonably good for Anime content?

Bit like how RT is imperfect but still mostly good for movies.
>> ARTICLE
[There's AnimetaCritic](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/2/), which represents critical opinion with a lot more consistency than MAL user ratings. certain shows that are often neglected by the general public are given a lot better placement, like Simoun, Utena, Turn A, etc, while reasonably flawed popular shows see a massive drop, like Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown, Sword Art Online, etc. problem is, it only goes up to late 2013, but if you work around that, especially for help informing your backlog, it's a competent source. 
>> ARTICLE
AniDb...
It's now a bunch of really seasoned anime veterans who use the website, so the rating system is pretty damn harsh. Like if a show is above 7 its watchable, 8 is pretty damn must see. 9 is SUPER rare. 
>> ARTICLE
is it should be. Because those are extremely high.
>> ARTICLE
> AniDb

Ah man I dislike AniDB, it's basically drama/psychological/mystery/other ''mature'' genres get good ratings while shounen/super power/harem/ecchi animes always get shit ratings, even if they're good.
>> ARTICLE
AniDb is great. For the past eight years, I have used AniDB as a reference when looking for something new to watch. Seems to have one of the better rating systems out there. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but the difference between OPM and Band of Brothers is a little over 195000 ratings.
>> ARTICLE

Curious, I wonder if roriknobfan does reddit.

He does. Just gets downvoted a lot.

I'm expecting it to decrease soon. Will probably still stay above 9, but not at the very top.
>> ARTICLE
It's amazing how popular this is, even among casual fans and non-anime fans. He's dominating to the point of excess on /r/whowouldwin. 

Most ratings tend to go down drastically after the show finishes and some time passes though, so it should be taken with a big grain of salt. It also has very few ratings thus far so it's probably just the small dedicated fanbase.
>> ARTICLE
> It's amazing how popular this is, even among casual fans and non-anime fans.

Yeah, I've been hearing a lot of people talk about it in my various classes from ethics to game design. It kinda cool, and I think OPM will be a good one to suggest people to watch to get into anime in the future. (Well, the mosquito-girl part was a bit much but oh well.)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but it's that one thing, so you can usually brush that off with "Well, it's japan being wonky" or "Well, it's kind of a joke on japanese series' normally heavily sexualized female monsters. You know, even a musquito can be drawn with hips and a waist" and then just pray they don't think about it for more then half a minute after.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, if Spriggans and Flame Atronachs in Skyrim don't cause people to bat an eye, I doubt the mosquito will either.
>> ARTICLE
What was wrong with the mosquito-girl? Have I watched too much anime or something? Because to me it was just a weird looking monster that was a girl.
>> ARTICLE
She was a bit....sensual
>> ARTICLE
Over sexualized. I know it isn't bad by anime standards, but in the second episode it's hard to really stomach for non-anime watching people.
>> ARTICLE
Its the most popular anime this year in my country
>> ARTICLE
Ratings tend to drop after a show finishes because a lot of people rate the show after they've acrually seen all of it (go figure).
>> ARTICLE
OPM is likely to end on a high note, though. (Not that it should beat BoB or some of the other "best ever" shows, but i think it will place pretty highly. If they adapt the next arc that would put it up higher imo.)
>> ARTICLE
yeah I'm really astounded how it became SO POPULAR ALL OVER THE WORLD that i'm now kinda creeped out when i hear some normal people (people that i know that doesn't watch any anime) talk about it casually :O

Does /r/whowouldwin use all the info from the manga? As far as I've seen in the anime, Saitama doesn't really have any limits. The whole premise is that he can win every fight without effort.
>> ARTICLE
They use as many feats as they can, and many of them are indeed from the manga. That's actually why he's so controversial over there right now - the "no limits" thing makes him difficult to rank in matchups. 

Lots of people are still constantly posting prompts involving him, so the subreddit is starting to get weary of him overall.
>> ARTICLE
Why even try? The whole point of OPM is how silly power levels are anyway. It's the best parts of dragonball action sequences with higher production and none of the "this isn't even my final form" or power level bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
When you have a character whose power is defined as "the ability to win any fight/defeat any enemy in a single punch" it's just senseless to try to "compare" to some other character. It's not even "the strength of his punch can defeat any enemy", that leaves the possibility that he might not be able to hit something or whatever. Just give him a lifetime achievement award and ban him from showing up in /r/whowouldwin :P
>> ARTICLE
Nah, they don't wanna ban any characters, which is nice.

Plus, due to Saitama's current no limits fallacy, people have had to come up with more creative "battles" for him. Like "Which team could convince Saitama to join first - Justice League or The Avengers?" 

Though, they're not the type of people to believe in "can win anything" abilities anyway. If we ever get shown Saitama's full power, they will place that limit on him immediately and compare him to others. As it is now? Meh. They still think Goku and other absurdly strong people could beat him.

Buu would win, he is his weakness, he can just regenerate himself
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Considering Buu could destroy the planet Saitama's on with relative ease  faster than Saitama's been shown to go, and Saitama's been shown that he needs a planet to survive (breathing, eating, can't fly through space, etc), it's totally reasonable to assume Buu would win.

This reminds me of when The Interview got a 10 rating on imdb soon after it got pulled from theaters. It's funny how far it dropped.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry.  One Punch man is a good show, but it doesn't even hold a candle to Band of Brothers.
>> ARTICLE
Can we call it overhyped now?  
I mean I like it. It's a comfy action comedy but nothing really beyond that.  
Having it averaging over 9 is just wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah 9 is definitely wrong but as an action comedy anime it's looking to be one of the greats of that genre.
>> ARTICLE
Not when it aces both action and comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
That's not a really high bar to set. It's not like the comedy is amazing either. I mean it does what it sets out to do very well but it doesn't set out to do all that much. It's better than setting the bar too high and tripping over it but it's still not worth the hype.

But you have to realize that the opinion of many says it's hype. You might not think it deserves it, but other people think otherwise.

I know it's hyped. I can see that it's hyped.  
I'm saying I don't see why it's so hyped.

How dare you go against the anime hype machine! Stop having a unique opinion.

A fairly original anime in a sea of formulaic little boy and harem anime that isn't trying to be what it is not vs. a fairly standard war show among a sea of war shows that is pretending to be a documentary but is really just your standard Hollywood fantasy nonsense out for feels.  Sorry to YOU, but BoB vs. OPM, BoB dead in one punch.

Band of Brothers was pretty boring to me. I prefer Rescuing Private Ryan

I prefer Letters From Iwo Jima to both of them.

I could never get into band of brothers, sure it was good for what it was, but not for me.
>> ARTICLE
I think people are just enjoying the show. OPM is not even best anime, but it sure is enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, there's no fuckin' way it's even close.  Maybe as far as TV anime goes OPM might be up there, but compared to something like BoB, not a snowballs chance in hell.
>> ARTICLE
What a brave opinion.
>> ARTICLE
That's not how subjectivity and ratings work. Band of Brothers is good, but I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in watching it again (same with The Wire so many people love). 

But I would gladly re-watch One Punch Man over and over. And that's coming from someone who follows the Web comic and the Manga - even knowing what's coming in the anime it's still amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
I never thought I'd be talking about Band of Brothers in /r/anime because of One Punch Man. Seriously though, Band of Brothers is legendary. I don't think One Punch Man could really be compared to Band of Brothers.

And while we're on the topic, has anyone else watched The Pacific? I feel that show is pretty underrated just because Band of Brothers' legacy overshadowed it.
>> ARTICLE
It's an IMDB rating. It means nothing.
>> ARTICLE
Ratings always don't mean anything to someone regardless if the website is well-known or not. 

For me, the best metric is to see how much people talk about it on the internet.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a massive band of brothers fan, but lets not pretend it's perfect. One Punch Man is a comedy, BoB is a historical war series... Comparing them in the first place is a bad idea.
>> ARTICLE
Its like comparing a burger to wine. Both are great at what they aim to achieve.

I'd take a burger over wine any day.

Its more like compare steak and sushi, hardly to compare

I agree, but to me Band of Brothers is the best "TV" show ever made.
>> ARTICLE
Breaking Bad tho
>> ARTICLE
This guy gets it.
>> ARTICLE
If you actually think BB is the best show of all time watch; band of brothers, the Wire, the sopranos, deadwood
>> ARTICLE
I seen all and still think Breaking Bad is the best. Is this sub toxic to those with opinions?
>> ARTICLE
I guess it is. I have the same opinion as you and got downvoted like hell so basically I can't have an opinion :)
>> ARTICLE
i mean, you can feel free to like it the most, but when looked at from a purely quality stand point, BB is quite a bit inferior to those other shows. No ones saying anything about which you personally liked more
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Breaking Bad is not on the same tier as the four you mentioned. Some people might find Breaking Bad more entertaining then those four shows, but they're fundamentally different types of shows.

If anyone has read/seen Bakuman it's like when Mashiro explains that his favourite manga is Ashita no Joe, but the best manga in his opinion Barefoot Gen.
>> ARTICLE
I read and watched Bakuman and remember that same thing. For me Naruto, is my favourite Manga, but Berserk/Monster are probably the best ones, imo. And I love them too. 

But in this scenario I still prefer Breaking Bad. Maybe it's just my favourite and I can't see it now, but I really think it's the best TV show.
>> ARTICLE
I personally think Avatar: The Last Airbender is the most perfect series in existence. However i totally agree that Band Of Brothers is a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Is it really that good?

I personally think Generation Kill is better. The way they portrayed soldiers felt much more real and human to me. 

Also, it's lame as hell to compare the two anyway. You're basically fishing for upvotes with that comment.

the wire

better than any anime you'll see

Its on HBOgo if you have that.  If you have a cable package with hbo you can log in with that on HBOgo.

For me, The Simpsons at their peak is the greatest TV show of all time. I mean that across all genres, all countries, all networks, all styles of TV. No other show was as effective at being as utterly brilliant at comedy, drama, action & adventure all at once.

It could flicker from highly charged, emotional scenes to side splitting humour, but what was more brilliant was the way the jokes worked on so many levels, IF you liked your humour intellectual, they had you covered. Dry, witty? Sure. Or maybe you were low brow? Easily done at the same time. Sometimes with the same joke.
>> ARTICLE
Great point. People always like to pick out deeply emotional highbrow shows as the "best ever made", but in practice we spend a lot more time watching easy going shows like Simpsons. Simpsons is also culturally one of the most influental shows.
>> ARTICLE
I think The Wire takes the spot of best tv ever made
>> ARTICLE
Eh. The Wire is fantastic, but BoB is definitely better. I think the big thing that BoB has over the The Wire is length. BoB was like 11 episodes. Each episode was amazing, and the character development through the entire show was spectacular (don't get me wrong, it's the same in The Wire). The Wire overall was great, but there were definitely very weak moments for me in the show (cough season 2). 
>> ARTICLE
I just don't feel comfortable comparing a mini series to a full fledged t.v series personally. I adore both of those series. I WISH more things even came close to BoB's caliber. But one had to come up with a lot more content than the other. 

But it's the same issue I run into comparing 26 episode series to 80 episode ones. One went longer than the other for numerous reasons, (some that are sometimes outside the creators control), and that can be to the longer series detriment.

Also agreed about season 2. 
>> ARTICLE
I see where you are coming from, but I always disagree that Season 2 was a weak point. It was very daring, introducing a completely new storyline and cast of characters, and for me packed the biggest emotional punch of the series.
>> ARTICLE
I think its not totally fair to compare. I could go on about the wire for hours, but season 2 was a great season as well. that show went over every aspect of the drug trade in the city, and the port systems is a very important player in that world. 
>> ARTICLE
Damn, best tv show made huh? I should check that out soon. Thanks for recommendation. But do you think any anime holds a candle to it? 
>> ARTICLE
I would honestly say no.  Even when I rate an anime a 10 it can still have flaws.  Band of Brothers is as close to perfect as you can get in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. Interesting. I see you have Hunter x Hunter 2011 on hold. I highly recommend with all my heart that show. I was about to say that the writing in the show is phenomenal and is a possible contestant for best TV show. Personally, its my favorite, but outside of that, its the full package that it offers. I would say that the great non-anime TV shows definitely knock 90% of what anime currently has to offer, but the remaining 10% is capable of rivaling the best ones. I dont really watch TV shows that much, pretty much non-existent at this point, but ill give BoB a try. Breaking Bad was great. Other than that, my perception of non-anime TV shows is pretty much bad. All those live reality dramas and what not. 

EDIT: Any awesome, short, non-anime TV show recommendations would be nice too. Thought i dont know where to watch them.
>> ARTICLE
Hannibal, Black Sails (got really good in 2nd season), Fargo etc.
>> ARTICLE
Check out Mr.Robot, the first season ended a couple of months ago and it's really good and has been highly praised everywhere. Also check out Black Mirror a pretty good scifi show. Each episode is stand alone and deals with it's own topics, 2 seasons. You might have heard this show but check out True Detective if you haven't. 2 seasons but each season is a stand alone mini series with a different actors and locations. 

Most of these shows you can pirate but I'll tell you where to find them legally. With Mr. Robot I think your only option is watching it on Amazon, Black Mirror you can find it on Netflix, and with True Detective you can either watch it on Amazon or HBO GO/Now.
>> ARTICLE
Man Mr. Robot was entertaining but high quality it was not. The over-dramatic anti-The Man ranting and all the bullshit that came attached with it was SUPER cringey. I adore Rami Malek though and he made it worth it for me.
>> ARTICLE
I though it was mostly high quality, the acting and cinematography was pretty good. I agree Rami Malek and Christian Slater were great. I agree that the writing at times was cringey though but I"m interested to see where it will go, the director I believed said the first season was just to set everything up.
>> ARTICLE
It is absolutely great.  No, I personally do not think any anime holds a candle to it.  I love anime, but as I've been saying elsewhere in this thread, Band of Brothers is on an entirely different level of good from the best anime I've ever seen.  Same with the 'sequel' (or sister series, or whatever) The Pacific.  Its made by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and it really shows just how good they are at this kind of thing.

I absolutely cannot wait for Masters of the Air.  Its going to be the 3rd WWII series by them and reportedly has the largest budget for any TV show in history.

I'm glad you're open to trying it, I have a couple of friends who refuse to even look at good western shows or books I tell them about because they aren't anime/light novels.
>> ARTICLE
For some reason, Pacific never did live up to BoB, in my eyes.  I don't know if it was the characters or what.  Still a good show, though.  I hadn't heard about Masters of the Air, but just the notion of a new series along the same vein as those two has me pretty pumped.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was really cheesy in comparison. BoB was based on true stories, and they had the actual people telling the stories. The Pacific was some over dramatic generic Hollywoodized war story, with forced in drama. Also, tried really hard to get on the level of BoB, but the writing was just not as good, partially because it was mostly fictitious, instead of true story.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed BoB is a masterpiece, I love it.

OPM is fun sure..but thats about it. Not very special 
>> ARTICLE
I agree completely. When the credits rolled on EP10, I couldn't think of anything else other than; "This is *the* best and most worthwhile thing I've ever watched".

I've been through many emotions watching anime and many other TV shows, but I honestly fail to see how anything could ever top Band of Brothers.
>> ARTICLE
Band of Brothers is the only show I re-watch every year. I have seen it probably 10 times.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen the series nearly 10 times now, that's how much I love Band of Brothers.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I saw it when it came out on TV way back when and thought this was the greatest thing ever and that opinion hasn't changed since.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Few things have ever hit me as hard as watching that scene where they enter Dachau. 14-year old me had obviously heard of the Holocaust, but the true horror and scope of it all never hit me until I watched [that scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHcJtU9dr6I). 

In fact, I just rewatched it now. I ended up staring at the wall for a good few minutes before I ended up posting this comment.

but what about when Saitama punched Sonic in the dick tho
>> ARTICLE
Award winning moment right there
>> ARTICLE
Say what you want about the story, characters, and premise or whatever, but the entertainment it brings is immense. The humor is there too.
>> ARTICLE
For anyone who hasn't seen Band of Brothers, you definitely should watch it immediately. 

I'm extremely satisfied the response to OPM has been this great though. I think most people would agree it's probably an instant classic.

Can someone let me know why One Punch Man is so amazing?  I've watched the first few episodes and it just doesn't seem like there's a plot or anything, why does everyone cream their jeans over it?

>> ARTICLE
Quality content
>> ARTICLE
it's everything we ever wanted out of a shonen manga

did you ever watch a show where the protagonist underwent **massive** training [](/s "like the 2 year timeskip in one piece for example") only to come back for another 15 episode fight against the new evil dude? You kinda wish the protagonist, just for once, would come back from his training and just one-hit KO the new antagonist, because he powered up that much. Shows don't usually do this. One Punch Man does.
>> ARTICLE
Fairy Tail has got the be the most guilty perpetrator of this. In fact I first heard of OPM on a discussion thread because it was becoming  that ridiculous. 1-2 shotting baddies like nobodies business, at least it's been dialed back a bit so Natsu actually looks like he needs to put effort now.
>> ARTICLE
you have to title your spoiler bro...
>> ARTICLE
Definitely has a plot, it's just not the point of the show/manga.
>> ARTICLE
At this rate it'll be as controversial as SAO by the time it finishes airing

Nah, we've passed the halfway point in this season and it hasn't gotten terrible yet. 
>> ARTICLE
Excuse you SAO is great 
>> ARTICLE
I'm of the opinion that the first season half is good and then they pull a death note and totally fuck the second half.

I mean SAO is great overall. Mainly because of alicization

It actually gets better from here on out

The manga steps it up so hard, that if this is a 9.6, it'll be a 15 soon.

most anime is average at best

I mean.. FMA:B is 9.1 on IMDB (!) and i think OPM will rate higher.

kinda surprised IMDB rates Steins Gate 'only' 8.8 though. I assume the MC annoyed a lot of IMDBers and they couldn't finish it.

ED:... yeah, sort by hated, at least onedidn't even watch past ep5. that's the problem with IMDB, don't have to watch it all to rate.

I think in it's genre it's probably better

FMA is pretty heavy as far as anime goes.

Pshhht you ain't a *real* fan then. :P
>> ARTICLE
> At this rate it'll be as controversial as SAO by the time it finishes airing

I don't think that'll be the case. SAO is controversial because there is a large division between people who love it and those who think it is absolute shit. 

For OPM, it's more so a lot of people love it then people saying "Yeah it's aight, but not as good as everyone thinks it is". I'd say OPM would be more closer to say, Madoka or Monogatari in terms of circle-jerk vs. anti-circlejerk 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, you're right. I didn't realize that.
>> ARTICLE
I don't see shitty writing or a harem in OPM
>> ARTICLE
But you do see hypers and anti-hypers

But it also means OPM is more deserving of the hype
>> ARTICLE
Cue people who don't like OPM knocking the rating down a peg.
>> ARTICLE
I love OPM, I really do, my favorite anime of the year, but I'm sorry it is not anywhere *near* as good as Band of Brothers.  If we're putting BoB at 9.6/10 then OPM is an 8 at best.

How do you compare them smh

Counterjerk is going strong in this thread.

It's true, unfortunately.

I mean basically the only people who have rated it so far are people who love it (who else goes and rates an anime on imdb before it's even finished)

True.

So why is a currently airing show allowed to be rated? Airing shows should only be rated after the show has finished.
>> ARTICLE
Says the person who has scored Hyouka 9/10 after only 2 episodes lol.
>> ARTICLE
I've already seen it but I'm currently doing a rewatch
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, my bad.

Anyway, why do you think you should only rate a show after it's finished? I'm not for or against doing that; I don't even score the anime or manga that I watch/read. I'm just curious.
>> ARTICLE
I like to be able to see what my friends are thinking of airing shows. I don't know why it really hurts anything. 
>> ARTICLE
Totally agree, maybe after 24 or 50 episodes, because then stuff like One piece will never get rated, after that many episodes you can decide the rating as chances are it's not going to get alot better or worse.But before that, things can change lots, especially for 24 episode anime that covers the entire series/story.
>> ARTICLE
My friend has an interesting theory that one punch man is Caillou.

Going by this logic, a show with a single perfect rating is the greatest show in history :D

It's called Hype.

I started watching yesterday. Already like it.

IMDB ratings don't mean shit, also you have to factor in the amount of people that voted it. New shows usually have higher ratings because there's only a few people that voted yet.
>> ARTICLE
It's a really good anime but that's way too much, it will come down.
>> ARTICLE
Band of Brothers is a really excellent 10 hour movie.
>> ARTICLE
After hearing so much about it I started to watch it even though it doesn't look like the type of thing I would normally enjoy. I got half way through episode 2 when the cyborg arms guy was fighting the queen mosquito or whatever and dropped it. Am I missing out? I get the whole parody of shonen thing, but that alone doesn't interest me too much tbh. It wasn't particularly bad or anything, but I didn't find it entertaining. Have I made a mistake?

Not sure if it matters but FMA:B and HxH are my top two.

>> ARTICLE
The show is just stupidity and action for the sake of being badass. That's it. It's just fun to watch, I'm sure that's why a lot of people enjoy it. Complex plot, life reflecting circumstances, intellectually fulfilling characters and life lessons are things that you won't get out of this show. It's absolutely fine if you don't find it good bro, no sweat.
>> ARTICLE
HxH and FMA weren't that great towards the beginning either, maybe give it another shot when the hype dies down and you don't have unrealistic expectations.




>> ARTICLE
It really picks up from there. The cyborg is used as a foil showing a high powered badass getting crushed before satiama (sp) bitch slaps whatever they're fighting into oblivion. The next part takes a couple episodes, but once he discovers the heroes association, it gets really good.

It still may not be your thing and it's very transparent in what it is, but it does it incredibly well and will keep getting better at it for at least 2-3 seasons worth of material.
>> ARTICLE
There will be some of us that just don't find it as entertaining, and there is not really anything you can say you're "missing out" on. The show is supposed to be fun and if you don't find it fun then it's just not for you. I feel the same way, dropped it after two episodes, and have already started to brace for the salt when saitama and genos cruise through the next best character competition.
>> ARTICLE
Is IMDB even can be trusted? 1000 is not even a good number of voters. There are more people who love it and give it a 10, than people who are not giving a fuck to login imdb to give it 7 or lower.
>> ARTICLE
Its a funny and decent show, but nothing more, its SAO and AoT again.
>> ARTICLE
Except this sub hates SAO, but by the time someone's typed "one pu-" two hundred redditors have jizzed.
>> ARTICLE
Wait for it to finish then we will see what /r/anime really thinks of OPM.

Im actively on this sub for almost two years now and this happened to Parasyte it was very hyped in /r/anime (not as much as OPM of course) and I remember everyone was jizzing over it every episode calling it AOTY,AOTS then when it finished a big wave of hate came and bad reviews started popping up on this sub. I see a lot of people calling it only 7/10 or 6/10 now with the second half being a let down.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't understand what's so great about One Punch Man. The first ep was a huge turnoff...
>> ARTICLE
It damn deserves it imo! Not an episode has gone past where I haven't laughed at least once. 
>> ARTICLE
God this show is so overhyped.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. It's decent and funny but I don't think it's a masterpiece. Certainly not as good as I expected from all the praise it gets.
>> ARTICLE
It's a solid 7.5-8.5, but there's no way in hell it should be rated a 9.
>> ARTICLE
Def a 9 could be a 10 depending on if the story actually progresses from now on into something fluent, I'd give it a 9 just for animation and sound alone as it stands.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it can hit it's target any more perfectly

It's the epitome of action because action in an anime
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill is a better "action because action" OPM is not about that, is just absurd humor about being a hero, and how stupid some things can be, or how absurd is a man that can defeat anyone with one punch, etc...in OPM the important thing is the idea, not the action
>> ARTICLE
Kill la kill is more absurd, like TTGL

OPM is much easier to stomach, closer to DBZ.
>> ARTICLE
i agree with that, thats why i said that the epitome of action because action is Kill la Kill, as more action because action an anime is, more absurd it is, and i don't think OPM is action because action like kill la kill, neither i see it like DBZ i think is similar to gintama, but as you have said, much easier to get in
>> ARTICLE
I haven't actually seen gintama

but.. yeah, you're right, OPM is (until now at least) largely day to day life then, well, one punch

next ep/til the end is a giant rollercoaster of action though, it's glorious.
>> ARTICLE
Difficult to assess just what you mean by that without a list of your own ratings :(
>> ARTICLE
I hype it up just as much as anyone else and that's the score range I'm aiming for (manga reader).

Hype isn't ever indicative of quality, it's a measure of excitement.
>> ARTICLE
the problem is ppl saying "is the best anime ever","the best animation of any show","OPM is a masterpiece" etc...ppl that say "this show is fucking awesome, i will rate it with a 7.5-8.5 its fcking amazing" i think are totally fine
>> ARTICLE
most people rate according to their personal enjoyment, saying something should or should not have a certain rating is stupid since a rating is a 100% subjective to the person rating it.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Hey man, I thought I'd reiterate what /u/len416 said: good is subjective, by any sort of logic you put into practice. 

With that said, I've got to respectfully disagree. This show, for me at least, is some of the most fun I've had as a viewer in quite some time. It doesn't pretend to be something it's not, which is refreshing. Because it's been such a great ride, thus far at least, it deserves most of the praise it's been given.

But like I said, that's just how I feel about it.
>> ARTICLE
And I think it's just okay, which is also my subjective opinion
>> ARTICLE
not sure why this is downvoted, since having that opinion is perfectly fine.
>> ARTICLE
Reason(s) for that? Just curious. It's fine and dandy that that's how you feel about it. I'm just trying to gain some perspective here.
>> ARTICLE
It's just a comedy series with good action. I don't find any of the characters particularly interesting, and the comedy is only an 8/10 for me.
>> ARTICLE
wtf for jumps are you taking, of course you can say it's good or bad with certain arguments on why you think that way. You however can't say it's objectively good or bad. Since almost ever aspect of anime you can critique is subjective(artstyle, characters, story, sound). The only thing i can think if that is objective is animation.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Then go and rate it low to pull the rating down if that's your opinion.
>> ARTICLE
its overhyped for a reason, because it's good
>> ARTICLE
Finally, someone fucking said it. The show is good. It's well animated. And it respects the source material. But having read the manga, watching the show is sort of a dull experience. At times it feels like a countdown to X, Y, and Z. And in an odd way, I feel like watching a 30 minute episode actually brings out the flaws of the series that I did not notice while reading it. OPM is hilarious, has great fight sequences, but that's pretty much it. The premise makes the story predictable. The characters are mostly one dimensional super powers. And most of all, the show really lacks any heart, emotional resonance, or thematic heft that makes a truly great show.
>> ARTICLE
I love the OPM manga, and the I'm really enjoying the show, but goddamn is it way overhyped. It's good, but it's not *that* good.
>> ARTICLE
Don't care, I'm having a blast. It's totally that good
>> ARTICLE
Problem is, OPM is great because it's not trying to be a social commentary or *something more*. It's just simple dumb fun. And it's doing a fantastic job of it. In fact, it's probably best *dumb fun* (action) anime I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Depends on who you ask, if it was me it is that good, it has me laughing each episode and in awe of its awesome animation. Its awesome.
>> ARTICLE
But is it as good as *Band of Brothers*?  I doubt that.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I didn't care much for Band of Brothers. It was mawkish.

Different strokes, different folks, and all that.
>> ARTICLE
It may not blow my socks off but I appreciate it because of how different it is. In a market saturated with thinly veiled shounen and excessive moe, it's a welcome change.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like OPM is gonna become the one show all of r/anime (or at least 90%) can agree to be good.

It's a double edged blade though, since it means no one can disagree without getting downvotes.
>> ARTICLE
> the one show

We already have FMA:B for a show that probably 99% of /r/anime liked. If you decrease that percentage to 90% you can probably add shows like Steins;Gate, Baccano, Hunter x Hunter, Hyouka, TTGL and Bebop.
>> ARTICLE
Well. I'm in that 1% of people that don't like FMA:B. I haven't watched it, granted, but from what I've seen it just doesn't seem appealing to me.

How can you possibly not like something you haven't watched? That's just asinine.

because of the charm it has, it seems like the show tries to be edgy exlain thing etc, but when watching it, it was just the way all is presented, how the talk, even if is meaningless, is just charming... i don't know how to explain it, but basically is like being hypnotized by that style, is nothing special, but is nothing special explained, showed, and animated as something special....
>> ARTICLE
To me it felt like a Tarantino film without substance. It's got its dry humor, its artsy camera shots, its fanservice, tries to be edgy and smooth... but aside from aesthetics it's just all dialogue that acts like its way more advanced or deep or meaningful or substantial then it really is. The whole selling point is the show's dialogue, and it just isn't that well written.

It's one of my lowest rated series. If it didn't look and sound good, it probably be last.
>> ARTICLE
Pls don't even put it in the same sentence as Tarantino movies. There in a completely different league.
>> ARTICLE
I meant the style of the cinematography . I love Tarantino.

But the cinematic elements (camerawork, artsy feel) reminded me of Tarantino, but had none of the substance (character, dialogue, world building etc) of a Tarantino movie.

A guess a little, I didn't notice it at all whilst watching it. inb4 Tarantino uses a neck tilt in new movie lol.

I don't think FMA:B one of the best shows ever made. I was expecting it to be a lot better than it actually was, given it was #1 on MAL for such a long time (and still is). It's way worse than HxH and on the same level as shonens like Magi in my opinion. I never understood why people liked it so much, and I'm still confused after I watched it.
>> ARTICLE
It's not that FMA:B is *that* good (though IMO among action shonen it's a cut above), but rather that it has something for everyone.  The setting is western enough and the cast is diverse enough and the story is juuuust complex enough that it's hard to not like it as least *somewhat*.  Add a well-done English dub and it has universal appeal.  
>> ARTICLE
Don't think of #1 as "the best shit evaaah" but as "a lot of people like it a lot and very few don't" - hence the high *average* score.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte?

edit: Btw I don't mean that in a "you missed one" way, I'm actually curious as to how it's received here. I'm not on this sub a ton. I remember it being huge when it aired but haven't seen much mention of it since. It and TTGL are my two favorite series ever.

I think it's because a lot of madhouse shows are just easy to watch. I looked up a list of what they've made and many of those shows are the kind of shows you can show to people who are just getting into anime and they'll enjoy. That's what I think anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I mean One Punch Man is seeming like a great anime, but ranking it among the greatest anime and even on top of that the greatest moving picture anything, not even close.
>> ARTICLE
only because 1,615 people have voted on it... Band of Brothers has 196,000 votes
>> ARTICLE
For me it's a 6.5-7/10 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really interested in why you rated it this low
>> ARTICLE
I personally don't find it that funny. It has it's moments but I'm not laughing as much as other people seem to be. I feel like I've seen this kind of humor elsewhere before, so it's not really doing it for me now. It's alright for me, maybe it'll get better? 

Edit: also to add on, before some people tell me how it epic the fights are, I think it's cool, but after watching fights in anime like AoT, FSN UBW etc, I guess those are the kinds of fights I prefer, I have a hard time taking a single punch as 'epic', yes he can own anything with a punch and that concept is aight, but how many times can he do that before it gets old? I'll still watch the anime, but atm it's a 6.5-7 for me. 


>> ARTICLE
First off, I'm really not trying to convince to to rate it higher, I'm just interested in your opinion and your reasoning.

I mean, everyones rating systems are different but let's say you rate it like most people do(what you probably are not).

Music,Art/Animation,Characters,Story,Personal enjoyment.

So if we objectively say that the Art and Animation is a solid 9 or 10 and I'm just guessing you like the music(so 8 or 9).

And let's say your personal Enjoyment is on a 6 then your rating would only make sense if you think that the Characters and Story together only bring 5/10 each. Maybe you only rate after personal enjoyment? 
>> ARTICLE
> So if we objectively say that the Art... is a solid 9 or 10 

Liking an art style is subjective. Art style =/= animation.
>> ARTICLE
Art = Animation. Animation is apart of the art category, just as much as the artstyle and other aspects of visuals are.
>> ARTICLE
You're taking my comment out of context, did you read the comment I replied to? I thought the person was saying that art style is objective and I even mention what you're saying in a reply to him again.
>> ARTICLE
He never said "artstyle" though so I dont know where your argument came from.
>> ARTICLE
As you said, I know that art contains both art style and animation. In his comment, he said "art and animation" and I assumed because he didn't just say "art" he meant "art style and animation".
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I see. I can see why you would have said that then.
>> ARTICLE
sure but I meant Art/Animation to be one category, not 2.

Of course I know that Art style and Animation is not the same, if I would have thought that I would not have said Art AND Animation to be one category. Animation is objective and Art(style) is not, I'm aware of that. It's 2 entirely different things, yet people rate the both in the same category.
>> ARTICLE
Most reviews that I've seen always put art style and animation under "art" and then discuss both separately, never seen them ranked as one though. 

Your wording made it confusing, it could've meant separate categories or one. If you had put "Art/animation" like in your reply, it would've been better.

And obviously you understand that they're different, so now my comment is pointless, sorry for bothering you.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah pretty much, except I'm not calculating it precisely with effort by looking at all the factors, I just gave it a general rating. If I were to do that then the actual rating might even be lower. Enjoyment has to play a huge role, if I don't find it humorous like most of you do then I won't find it that entertaining because that's the kind of anime this is, supposedly a funny one. 
>> ARTICLE
"Art and Animation solid 9 or 10" saying that the year were UBW and Hibike came out, and the world were kyoani and ufoatble exist.....i mean, the animation is pretty good, a solid 8 but not more than that, the style is rather generic, with a pale color palette with nothing impressive, i have to admit that the lines are well defined the majority of the time which makes it more well done, but sometimes the animation is inconsisten and is only "amazing" in certain fights. So basically the art style is generic and the animation great, which for me is an 8, but not near to a 9 or 10
>> ARTICLE
I don't actually like One Punch Man, but it has way better animation than UBW.
>> ARTICLE
loool i mean, you can not like the stroy of UBW but there is no anime serie(there are some movies)with better animation tha UBW, and that is something i have seen evryone said, maybe they have problems with the pacing, the story or the characters but the animation is always mentioned as the best of the best 
>> ARTICLE
Actually, no. Most of UBW's "animation" is just a ton of 3D effects work on top of ok animation. (IMO ufotable's style in general is way too busy with effects work to actually be considered aesthetically pleasing, but whatever floats your boat.) One-Punch Man, meanwhile, has brought in an all-star team of the top animators in Japan to do their thing. 
>> ARTICLE
"just a ton of 3D effects" because is extremly easy to do, so easy that all the other shows can do, but instead they use way worst animation not because doing what ufotable does is hard, but because they like to do shit quality, i personaly find UBW WAAAY more aestheatically pleasing than One punch man, the daily scenes of OPM can be from OPM or any generic show with above average animation, the only thing that is "amazing" are the fight where the animation is inconsisten as fck, overexagerated and with easy to see the frames between moves, UBW is far better in the daily scenes and the fights(excluding the 2 of shirou), with amazing backgrounds instead of generic ones, and consisten animation, the only thing that they did bad was those dam noses and is not that bad after you see 2 or 3 chapters, AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY HAVE AMAZING 3D EFFECTS but ofcourse, that should be pressing a button and magic, everyone can do that so, is not important....(also if you see the hand drawed of UBW is extremly amazing, but of course because that stupid cirle-jerk about UBW only being about "ton of 3D effects" it doesnt matter)
>> ARTICLE
It kinda sounds like maybe you just don't like [sakuga](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-09-30/the-joy-of-sakuga/.93579)? In which case I don't really think we can reconcile our aesthetic preferences. 
>> ARTICLE
You cannot rate something by comparing it to something specific. Fate and Hibike were top in this aspect and One-Punch Man is too, but as people have already mentioned art is subjective. Fate is all about art and isn't as packed in animation to be honest
>> ARTICLE
i think UBW's animation, except in the latest chapters is pretty amazing, i don't know which aspect OPM is top, the pretty few detailed moments in fights? i mean, is great but i have seen that before, and as well done, i don't know, when watching OPM chapter's i did not find myself surprised or amazed by the animation because i don't see anything "special" 
>> ARTICLE
I'm another counterjerker, confused about the sudden hype.

Mere mocking references to generic pop culture DC/Marvel+Shonen alone does not do it for me (though the mix is interesting, especially with the wonderful art). 

But comedy-wise, I just dont see it. If we're talking about mockery, compare it to Gintama...

Maybe if there were some more of lowbrow to hook people early on, but as it is first 3 episodes left me pretty disappointed.

It is also rated an 8.82 on MAL from 35,636 users, putting it at Number 23 on MAL's Top Anime Series list.  
  
1. I fucking hate it when people rate shows before it either finishes airing or before they finish watching it.  
2. For me, it's currently at a 7.5 and it has to have some crazy next episodes for me to consider giving it above an 8. 10 is completely out of the question,
>> ARTICLE
Two things I wish MAL would do

1) Ratings while Airing/Before the person completes the series would be differentiated from 100% completed.

2) In the 'Episode watched'/'Out of Total' that 'Episode watched' would be capped at the current number aired.
>> ARTICLE
well you know if people never rated shows before they were over people wouldn't really have recommendations as to what to watch during a season. I do agree if they rate a show before it even airs but it can only help people for recommendations during an airing season. Besides rating can fall if people don't like the ending and people can change their rating if they feel strongly enough to deviate from their original rating. There are tons of shows that fall after the ending of a show i.e "Charlotte", and if you don't want to see a rating of a show just don't look it up, and you can look at the rating after it's over. 

It's just people's opinions it doesn't have to change yours.
>> ARTICLE
Why do you like only slightly more than your average anime? I think it's much better in many ways.  
Most of the scores are probably from manga readers who know that it gets better progressively

at first you think it might be stupid. You look at the title and go "wtf" and then you realize, "wtf, why not, I am bored anyways". So you watch the first episode and you find it funny. 

By the 7th episode you are hooked, cause it isn't as dumb as it seemed at first and is funny at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
Don't know if it's your fault OP, but even though the "TV" list still shows 9.5, Band of Brothers' rating on its own page is now 9.6 (for me  anyways)


I don't mind one bit if this results in BoB taking a complete top spot (currently tied), that was a great series.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't count for anything until it hits 5,000 votes, but its a good sign so far. Rick and Morty still holds the top 10 I believe, although I personally dont put much stock into IMDB user ratings since AoT has an 8.9

Remember when The Dark Knight was the top-rated movie on IMDB? The hype will fade. People outside the circlejerk will finish it, rate it below a 9, and it'll balance out.

What a bold title for someone who does not understand how ratings work. I'm sure the majority of the kids that are subbed don't even know what Band of Brothers is.

I think OPM is really good but definitely cannot be compared to BoB, because they are entirely different. Yeah but seriously OPM is being overhyped way too much, its kind of like the attack on titan of this year.

I am currently watching this show, and I enjoy it. But it does not deserve such a high rating.

OPM is great but nowhere near on the level of BoB.

Why is everyone such a giant baby when it comes to the hype surrounding the show? Yeah, we get it. You don't like the show as much as everyone else what the fuck do you want people to do, stop liking what you don't like? Get over it already. 

It's also stupid as fuck when you say something about the show like "It has no plot" or "The premise is stupid" and then when someone attacks those statements you say "W-Well it's just my opinion! Everything is subjective". I agree with that statement, but why is it unacceptable for this anime to be so hyped up then if everything is subjective? If you're going to say "It's just my opinion" without even defending your opinion of the show then people full well have the right to overhype OPM to high heaven regardless of your opinion on it.

That's also what I dislike about /r/anime, some opinions are allowed but others are not. You can say "OPM is overhyped" or "SAO is trash" and add nothing to it and people will praise you for being "brave" about your opinions and the defense against anyone who challenges those opinions is "W-Well it's all subjective!". But say shit about something like Shirobako which /r/anime *truly* does have a hard-on for (Unlike SAO which everyone here hates anyways so speaking ill about it isn't "brave") and /r/anime will come down hard on you. Try and use the defense "W-Well it's all subjective!" and that still won't work. I don't even bother to make a point about Shirobako whenever I see it praised, if someone can be that happy over a show, even if I don't like it as much as them I won't shit on their parade. They liked it, I didn't like it as much, big fucking deal.

**TL;DR: Let people like what they like. Even if you don't like it, that's making someone else happy. Don't shit on their parade.**

For me I watched episode 1 when it came out and then left it for a while, it was decent but i didn't really feel what the hype was all about as i didn't understand where it could go since Saitama's hyped up as already being the strongest man in the world. I came back to the series two weeks ago after hearing everyone was enjoying it so much and I've been loving every minute of it, i feel the comedy gets a lot better playing between Saitama and Genos who gets introduced in the second episode.

Afaik Murata has literally said he would try his best to get a season 2. Right now there isn't enough content, yes, but saying that the publisher has said there won't be a season 2 is pretty much misinformation and not helpful at all...So yeah so much for "helping the community", right?

Cool I'd love to see the article.  

Also, the end result is the same isn't it?  Still isn't a season 2 and probably won't be in near future.  So yeah, it's a helpful answer.  :)
>> ARTICLE
The difference between "there isn't enough yet" and "there won't be" is intention and context. Yes the end result is the same but saying that there just won't be another season insinuates that even with enough material there still wouldn't be another season.
>> ARTICLE
You're seriously arguing the semantics that we already established don't matter.  Just shut up lol.  No season 2 right now!  Maybe later!  No one has a for sure answer.  Lmfao!

Nice language. Semantics matter to people that want things, and since people want a second season it matters whether they creator is even willing to allow it to happen.

They matter. Do they matter right now because we won't be getting another season yet due to a lack of content, no of course not; to act like they don't matter at all is a bit naive though.

Btw, those semantics you're saying don't matter were something I did purposely make the distinction between in my reply. He was quoting me, not you.

> No season 2 right now!

Yes we can all read the charts for the next seasons, too. No one is trying to claim there will be another season of OPM this year. However, you claim to be relaying information from the publisher, but the fact is your claims are false, as proven by the source I provided below. By relaying misinformation, the end result is not "the same." It is not a case of the community being immature, you are being downvoted because you were providing false information. Do not try to act like you are in the right here.

I doubt it will be that long if it is indeed happening. The author averages 1 chapter every 2 weeks, and the first season covered 50 chapters. He's currently on chapter 86, so about 7 more months should suffice to reaching 100 chapters, and giving enough material for a second season.

I'm sure there's going to be a bunch of filler then.

ONE has already started a second arc, so once Murata finishes redrawing the next completed arc they can bang the anime right out.  He's even tweeted about getting it done quickly.  I wouldn't be surprised if we get it next winter.

edit:  We'll have Mob Psycho 100 to hold us off anyway :)

Since his other Manga series are wrapping up/Done you can probably expect more to come out a little bit faster for a while.

Then i imagine he will slow down on releasing chapters since Murata really wants a season 2 of the anime also.

Murata isn't the writer, and doesn't really have a say. In fact ONE was written special scripts for the OVA's.

There's only real 56 chapters in the manga. 87 is wrong number. The chapters are released by parts so other manga hosting sites counts per release but it will only contain like 5 pages which is not enough for a chapter.

Who is fubuki (I dont remember her from the show)?

And also, Murata is the one making the manga version right (and if so where did that video come from?)?
>> ARTICLE
Fubuki is Tatsumaki's sister and she only had a brief appearance in the anime during one of the earlier episodes but she plays a much bigger role in the upcoming arcs.

That video is from Murata's stream he does when he draws the manga.

This is actually a bizarrely appropriate comparison. ONE set the guidelines and gave Murata the power to carry out his will. Then eventually Murata officially established the series using the power of Madhouse.

All according to keikaku*.

The episode with the seaweed monster. Both Fubuki and Tatsumaki appear for the first time in this episode. She is in the short period when they send a calling for more heroes since the to A class are down - Spring Mustache calls for backup, and we have some very short cutscenes with other heroes deciding to go or pass. Fubuki is surrounded by her henchmen and she says she'll pass on this.

If you can't see a dick how is the image ruined? For all intents and purposes most "trap" cosplays are 100% female in appearance, so you can be attracted to them, but not romantically or sexually. *not accounting for sexual preference*

As a straight male you're attracted to the feminine traits, and if they appear female, just assume they are, because knowing there is a dick doesn't change anything (in a positive way) unless you try to set up a relationship with that person.

Porn addiction contributes to straight men needing to see a girl and a dick. Constant porn consumption leads men to feel inadequate and subservient to the larger cocks they are constantly looking at, and they begin to emulate the women they see worshiping them. Large cocks have been worshiped as gods on earth for thousands of years by peoples all over the world. It's a mental illness, don't let the downvotes fool you.

Kek 

As if OPM wasn't a hit everywhere 
>> ARTICLE
It isn't.

In japan, where it matters, there are MANY other anime selling way more, better received by the target demographic: japanese people. 

BD sales say OPM is average there. 

**[OPM BD1 sold 7k BDs, Osomatsu-san (largely ignored by /r/anime) sold 34k.](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1449116)**

Almost 5x the amount.

For context:

Owarimonogatari sold 28k.  
Gochuumon S2 sold 11k.  

7k is pretty meh.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it is not like OPM was in the top 11 of manga sales in 2015 right ? And that is japan "where it matters", you can try as hard as you want but the anime completed it's objective, that is raise the awareness of the manga

Really? Social media in general loves this series. Besides [look how much upvotes this kill la kill cosplay got.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3pj2dh/amazing_kill_la_kill_ryuko_satsuki_cosplay_xpost/)

This sub is 91% male after all. 
>> ARTICLE
> Social media in general loves this series.

Most of their stuff come from reddit, though.

Considering **how much** people **TIRELESSLY** speaks of OPM here (**way** **way** more than other social media), it is a fitting nickname.

It is a surprise to no one OPM is super-hyper-mega-ultra-[magnitude-adjetive-here] popular *here*.

>Besides look how much upvotes this kill la kill cosplay got.

Of course cosplay posts get upvotes, i just said so on the reply you answered!

What's your point?

>> ARTICLE
It sounds like needless complaining. 
>> ARTICLE
Nah, simply stating a fact.

*"A woman cosplaying one-punch man character will, without fail, get frontpage with over 2k upvotes. Guaranteed front page content"*

If you see a negative connotation with that statement, that's *your* interpretation.
>> ARTICLE
You are correct, that is my interpretation. You may be stating is a fact, but i personally see it as needless complaining and not attributing to any discussion. Of course there is a correlation between upvotes and cosplay of a woman, we do not need to be told about it.
>> ARTICLE
> but i personally see it as 

Im not responsible of how you "personally see things"...
>> ARTICLE
Of course you aren't, it's my own interpretation of your comment. I believe I already said this in the first sentence of my previous reply.
>> ARTICLE
Then there is no reason for you to complain nor reply, isn't it?

* You admitted im being factual.     
* You admitted there is no inherent negative connotation in my reply.  

* You admitted it is not my fault if others see a negative connotation.

&nbsp;

I fail to see how your *"i see it a needlessly complaining"* comment is relevant, after these 3 points.
>> ARTICLE
I never stated that you were factual or said that there are no negative connotations in your reply. I can only give you my interpretation, my opinion is not a fact, this opinion is that your comments come off as needless complaints. About the third point, I would have agreed if you didn't present your point as fact, rather than it being your own opinion which it is. My facebook feed has been blowing up with one punch man related stuff, it went viral online, that is a fact. I've seen one punch man in other reddit threads, all that tells me is that it has become mainstream. Is reddit obsessed with game of thrones because it's everywhere on this website? No, it is simply popular. Sorry if I had made you thought that i agreed with you because i do not. I have nothing more to say to you on this matter.

Edit: Oh and i understand how a previous comment made you think that i said it was a fact. I meant "You may be stating it as a fact" rather than "You may be stating is a fact". The "it" being your opinion.

>> ARTICLE
I think the scene is just badly set up.  The multiple earth benders were the ones who raised the wall of earth, but for some reason they had them still moving afterwards.  The person who levitated the rock is the same person who propelled it.  But the timing of everything and the camera angles used just make it all confusing on a first look.

I'm sure you'll love it! The only "bad" thing about it is that the new version gets updated so slowly but that's because of the phenomenal quality of the artwork being in it. It's always worth the wait.
>> ARTICLE
Just a question, non-manga reader here, is it still interesting if he is that OP? I mean, the fights aren't interesting if he beats everyone in one or two punches, I think?
>> ARTICLE
The plot is more about him trying to be the top hero. The monsters he destroys don't matter too much. There's an organization of heroes, and the main character is only C rank (it ranges from D, C, B, A, S). 
>> ARTICLE
spoiler alert...
>> ARTICLE
That's a basic summary of the story...
>> ARTICLE
I wonder about how much he really cares about being the top hero.

[Don't read this if you haven't read the series] (/s "Sure, he is frustrated by the fact that he isn't famous, but it seems to me that he sees that as an admittedly-selfish secondary goal. When the Tank Tops try to turn the town against Saitama after the meteor incident, he announces that he doesn't care what they think, and that he does his hero work because he wants to. He tells Blizzard much later in the series in no uncertain terms that he thinks hero ranks and hierarchy are bullshit. He does have a desire to reach the top, but is much more concerned about keeping the public safe and happy (like when he deliberately made himself look like an ass after the Sea King invasion) and struggles more with the fact that he's losing the emotion and excitement that makes being human worth living.")
>> ARTICLE
You've described a big part of why I like the series very much.
>> ARTICLE
Read the manga. It's HILARIOUS.  Also very well drawn.. I'm talking about the graphic novels, not the original web comic!
>> ARTICLE
He's the main character, but the story revolves around other characters, it's an interesting dynamic and unlike Superman.
>> ARTICLE
He is the most one of them most OP characters ever. To counteract this he has the biggest character flaw possible. He is not main character material. 


>> ARTICLE
The manga atleast is really interesing, but to fully understand one punch man you should have read alot of shonen to see the gen that its 
>> ARTICLE
The actual story is about finding meaning in life without meaningful challenge. Among many other things. Trust me, the manga (at least) delivers. There's a reason everyone is so hype for this show.
>> ARTICLE
There's the entire background of how he became onepunch-man and the challenges he faces even with god-like abilities. 

Have you ever read Noblesse? The MC is pretty much the strongest in the world right from the beginning of that as well, but the story is amazing and even with power the MC has drawbacks. Similar in style to Onepunch-man, he's not an infallible hero, just super strong.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, because it's mainly a comedy. He also doesn't loosely throw punches--being a hero is primarily his HOBBY. He's very different from other heroes in that his main goal is to save people and kill time, not to get glory or beat shit up. He doesn't mind that extra stuff, though.
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda new to Reddit, so if I want to reply to you all for commenting on me, I think I have to answer at my own post, I guess. Anyways, thanks for the information. Looks definility fun! I'm going to look forward to this for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Most OPs say their thanks by editing the original parent comment.
>> ARTICLE
Its his demeanor about the fights that is interesting.  He is the ultimate apathetic hero, he really doesn't care until he does, usually with only one punch.  You don't have to worry about it being boring though, the author has written it in such a way that it's really funny and exciting.  It's definitely my favorite new shounen comedy manga to be released in a while.
>> ARTICLE
He is very, very OP, and that's actually one of the interesting bits. How fun is it to hack a game and sit there with max level party from the beginning? Yeah, it's old when you reach the first boss. Saitama is sort of stuck with this hack and thus bored out of his mind.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the entire series, but for the most part, his actual contribution to the fight is played for laughs - Saitama coming in and one-shotting his foes is decidedly anticlimactic. To counterbalance that, the real fighting tends to happen before he shows up, where the  bad guy gets a chance to show off how terrifying they are to civilians or against the less-in-need-of-nerfing superheroes.
>> ARTICLE
The funny thing is, I don't think I would say OPM is really about Saitama. It's much more about the world and its characters, and how they interact and change. 
>> ARTICLE
And how that enigma disrupted the nice balance
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. The first couple chapters of the manga didn't catch my attention too much. It seemed like the joke was played out after the first couple times he defeated the monster of the week in one punch. But then more characters showed up and things got interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean about the initial chapters, how they can make you feel like the joke will play out quickly. But I do kind of hope to see that stuff make a return. I thought it was an interesting perspective to see the existential struggle of a man losing his excitement and passion for life. As much as I love how the series exploded in diversity and zaniness, it's also easy to forget in the later chapters that we're reading a story about a man whose greatest enemies and challenges give him the feeling that he's just listlessly brushing ants away. It's no wonder to me that he's such a strange dude; when you're so disconnected from everyone around you, what do you care if the public likes/dislikes you, or what rank they give you.
>> ARTICLE
It's one of the most interesting manga I've read in recent years. The art alone (in Murata's version) is spectacular enough to read the manga. The characters are all great and the humor is also very well done. Even though he is OP, the fight scenes are incredible to see in any of the arcs. And opposite to his power, Saitama's personality is pretty refreshing and is very different compared to what a "true" superhero's personality usually is. It's incredible fun to see him kick ass with ease and hasn't gotten boring yet. 
>> ARTICLE
Yet Saitama, despite not being very pure of heart or whatever, is a better hero than most. The encouragement he gave Licenseless Rider after the Sea King arc, for example. "That was a good fight!"
>> ARTICLE
He's not "pure of heart" but he's almost honest and simple to a fault. Such a great character in general. 
>> ARTICLE
so Gon?
>> ARTICLE
He's not as naive as Gon, though. He can pick up on some very subtle clues about people and their behaviors.
>> ARTICLE
He's very nice and ethical. 
>> ARTICLE
and FRUGAL
>> ARTICLE
(That's more because he doesn't have any money... though technically he should have some post-Boros!)
>> ARTICLE
I've commented on this before but I really love how the manga addresses major philosophical questions without ever directly putting the spotlight on them.

[These details are all spoilers] (/s "One of the big ones is about what makes a good person. The manga is full of characters who consistently step up to protect the public, but they have ulterior motives, or just straight up terrible personalities. Meanwhile, one of the series' greatest villains goes out of his way to avoid killing humans, causing rampant destruction for the goal of uniting humanity against him, and to prevent it from turning on itself...horribly misguided perhaps, but would you call that "having an evil nature?"") 

I could seriously talk about OPM for hours. It works on beautiful artwork and silly comedy, and has incredible depth and serious themes for readers who want to read it a little more closely.

TLDR: If you have any free time in your day, GO READ THE MANGA!
>> ARTICLE
>  the fights aren't interesting if he beats everyone in one or two punches

The manga addresses this a lot, actually. One of his biggest challenges is that he has no thrill in fighting any more. Also, collateral damage and no respect.

The secondary fights are actually serious though.
>> ARTICLE
And the best part, when Saitama gets serious he 11-ups (on a scale of 1-up) everyone's amazing feats.  
Sometimes in the most boring way possible, sometimes in the funniest way possible, sometimes in the most epic way that could be drawn possible.
>> ARTICLE
11-up is an underestimation. That serious sidestep was hilariously amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
To borrow the internet colloquialism: "Dat meteor tho."


On a more serous note: that fight with the alien invasion force was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
> The manga addresses this a lot, actually. One of his biggest challenges is that he has no thrill in fighting any more.

To add to that, as a whole the series isn't entirely focused on fights and sort of mocks traditional battle manga. There's a lot of gags, character development, and world-building that plays off that mockery/humor. 

The punching is just the main attraction, the story is rich with subplots.

>> ARTICLE
As someone who doesn't really know much about One Punch Man.. what's with his face?
>> ARTICLE
He trained so hard that all his hair fell out.
>> ARTICLE
The author wanted the character to be as bland as possible, so he made him bald with a simple face. This also helps with the theme of Saitama being a hero who's repeatedly written off because he doesn't look like a hero despite the fact he can destroy anything with a single punch.
>> ARTICLE
The cool-ness of his appearance is directly proportional to how serious he is about things. Most of the time, Saitama is barely more than a toddler's sketch, but during panels where he does badass stuff, he actually looks the part. It's a great running joke.

That's so cool. Thanks for informing me!

Never read the manga, but I know all about the concept from various /r/whowouldwin threads.  Been meaning to start the manga for awhile now, so needless to say I was excited when the anime got announced.  SUPER hyped.  Any manga readers wanna tell me if it's worth the hype?
>> ARTICLE
The only reason not to be hyped should be because you're worried the anime won't live up to the incredible detail, intensity, and comedy that defines the manga.
>> ARTICLE
> Any manga readers wanna tell me if it's worth the hype?

Just binged through half the manga... don't get hyped, because chances are that said readers will bash the heck out of the anime for not being as intense as the manga panels.

It can be done, but it will still be a different style that people won't like because it's not the same thing.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely worth. The love for this series is well deserved. Just go start reading! The art in Murata's redraw of ONE's original comic is simply outstanding.
>> ARTICLE
So do you think I should read the Manga while I wait? Or hold off so I'm blown away by the anime?
>> ARTICLE
I would definitely read it. Go check out Murata's redraw, as the art is absolutely incredible. If you still want to keep reading after catching up, go read ONE's original.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read much of the manga, but this is exactly what I expected.

YEAH ONE PUNCH MAN HYPE!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
I hear a lot of hype around this one so i figured ill just read the manga before watching the anime, you guys think?

I haven't read the series at all (and if someone could tell me where I could, I'd appreciate the hell out of that person), but I know that there were two different artists and that there's an obvious preference.

Hmm, I was under the impression that OPM was still clear for 3rd party scanlation for some reason but mainly just due to the fact that it still exists on batoto. Usually illegal content gets removed from the site. Isn't weekly shonen jump free to read online anyway? I think that's where I was reading Shokugeki no Souma recently, or maybe that's a different shonen jump.


In any case, if the mods say it's not allowed I can remove the links and change the comment to direct people to /r/manga . I was just waiting for a confirmation from /u/TheEnigmaBlade

edit:

just saw your edit with the link. I'll just remove my links and add that official viz one in.

From my understanding Batoto doesn't allow rips of officially released content but they still still have scanlations for a lot of licensed manga.

As for Viz's Weekly Shonen Jump last month they released the newest issues for free for that period of time but that is already over. It costs $26 for a year subscription although they have sales of around $20 every once in a while. Also on rightstuf there is a bundle for the Rightstuf Got Anime 1 year membership and 1 year of Viz's Weekly Shonen Jump for only $26.

if you want hype, awesome mc, HYPE, gorgeous art and more fucking hype...read it. Also its pretty funny.

The originals art is reeeeally bad and hard to get into, stick to the Murata version

Any idea if the volume's that have Murata's art are going to be sold in english too?
I fucking read the whole thing yesterday night and I love it.
Would be nice if I could get this as my first physical book (manga)

I'm planning on it! I just couldn't find a very good website for it. But the guy down there has me covered, so I think I know what I'm doing tonight!

Actually reading original is interesting, leaving aside story etc - it's how ONE's art improves noticably over time what's really fun to notice.
>> ARTICLE
Well, at the end of the day it's still a webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure it's still pretty good. Having seen the guy's art, I don't think it looks bad at all. But when you put it next to Murata's there's not much else you can say about it. I'll start with Murata's version, and if I'm compelled, I'll definitely look at ONE's. I think I might have to if I catch up.
>> ARTICLE
Should I read the manga or wait till the anime? I'm really hyped about this but I'm not sure which would be best.
>> ARTICLE
If you are going to check out the manga either way I would say you might as well wait for the anime first and then later read the manga and enjoy the awesome art by Yusuke Murata. Although if you truly can't wait then I would say go ahead and read the manga now and watch the anime when it comes out. 
>> ARTICLE
One wrote the original and Murata remade it with his own art. We love One, his art just sucks. His name's on the box because he created One Punch Man.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, so it's only because he's still credited as the author. I see people talking about his art all the time, so his name on the illustrations made me wonder.
>> ARTICLE
ONE is the creator and owner of One Punch Man. If you actually compare the original webcomic with the Murata-drawn manga, you'll see that the stories are pretty much panel-for-panel identical, but the new artwork really gives the stories that whoa-factor. So when these images have ONE in the corner, it's indicating that the franchise is property of ONE. All the artwork would be inspired primarily off Murata's redraw, and there shouldn't be any difference whatsoever when it comes to story quality.
>> ARTICLE
No, ONE is the original author

Murata's version is basically a remake with better art, that's it, the story's still handled by ONE
>> ARTICLE
You guys are really hyped about this, eh?

>> ARTICLE
Alright guys, explain to me why I should get hyped for this.
>> ARTICLE
Onepunch-Man is simply a genuinely hilarious story, man. Its characters are memorable and designed well, the world is intriguing, and it ~~pokes~~ punches fun at pretty much every Shonen trope. The titular character, Saitama, is so wonderfully nihilistic, and it's great to see him be incredibly bored in the face of villains-of-the-week.
>> ARTICLE
Does it ever get deep with plot with a somehow challenging antagonist or anything like that? Or is it more episodic funny stuff?
>> ARTICLE
There is an over-arching plot to the story. There's a massive organization of crime-fighting heroes, which Saitama joins. He just never advances through the ranks and tiers because 1: People just don't pay him any attention because he's so plain looking and 2: He just goes home right after taking care of hero stuff.

Saitama pretty much just hangs around, bored out of his mind, while the dozens of other characters yell at each other and vie for power and prestige. The plot *is* deep and complex, but Saitama isn't part of the plot because no one in the story cares about him.

And no, nothing has ever challenged him yet, and it's likely nothing ever will.

Do yourself a favor and go read it (Murata's redraw is preferred). It's 1000x more amazing than I could possibly make it sound. There's a reason everyone is so flippin' hyped about the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I will go give it a read, one last question though, does the story cover the other heroes in the crime fighting organization as they struggle for power or something like that.

I hate to use Bleach as an Example, but similar to how there was Ichigo and then the Gotei 13 could have their own story?

http://mangafox.me/manga/onepunch_man/ Is this one the redraw? One thing I have trouble with is understanding what's going on in fight scenes in Manga

Saitama is a Satire of overpowered heroes afterall~
>> ARTICLE
What OP hero comes to mind?  Even superman faces challenges.  I can't think of a main character or super hero that is as infallible.  Maybe they're given free powers like bleach/naruto, but they always struggle. 

If they were doing satire of a hero that always finds a way to win no matter what (bleach/naruto), it wouldn't be done like this.  OPM doesn't have any semblance of struggle, even mockingly (as a satire would present it), he's just a guy going through his life that happens to be impossibly strong and the struggle that comes along with it. 

Satire inherently presents something in a serious way and then takes it to the hilarious extreme of whatever it's subject is.  OPM is missing the sudden powerups, the spirit bombs, the digging deep inside to find a way to win.  He just IS.   

Let me know your take
>> ARTICLE
Superman (i don't know about the new DC universe) but in the pre crisis universe Superman never truly faced any challenges. (save for doomsday and maybe a few very rare situations. Normally had the risk of being exposed to Kryptonite) Superman always held back when he faced opponents because he never wanted to just downright kill them by mistake because his powers were so massive/strong.

An example of him cutting a bit more loose was everytime he would face darkseid for example. "Im always afraid of hurting someone or breaking something, but with you. I get to cut back a little bit" - Superman to Dark Seid. JJLA series.

And even then he wouldn't fight him at 100%

Edit: even when faced with a massive disadvantage. (again save Doomsday) superman would not go 100%. He would only adjust to compensate

Genos nendoroid when
>> ARTICLE
Forget Genos nendoroid, we need a Genos dakimakura!
>> ARTICLE
I actually kinda hope that this is the only nendroid for OPM and all the other characters get very realistic, well-articulated figurines. :P
>> ARTICLE
I honestly have grown a bit tired of the nenderoid trend; there are a lot of characters I want figurines of but only seem to exist in nenderoid form. 

This also goes for the Pops characters. Wanted a proper hulkbuster figurine but there only seem to be pops out there.

They can create a Tatsumaki nendroid since she's also a character with "simple faces"

Such an underrated anime. Imouto was 10/10.

Ass was fat. No wait that was Arthur 
>> ARTICLE
How much would this be? I would totally buy it
>> ARTICLE
Wait for it to go on sale, but make sure it's not a [missed sale](http://1pun.ch/missed_sale.png)
>> ARTICLE
Since it doesn't come with many accessories it should be around 25-33 dollars . It goes up for pre-order tonight. i recommend buying from [amiami](http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/detail?gcode=FIGURE-014894&page=top). They are the cheapest usually and you only pay when they ready to deliver the item.
>> ARTICLE
oh wat? Tonight as in night time in the states or where? I need to preorder him

>> ARTICLE
Okay thanks alot OP
>> ARTICLE
His MSRP is 4,200 JPY. ~$34-$35 USD based on today's exchange rate.
>> ARTICLE
Is there anyone else you'd reccommend that will have it for preorder? Several people below you have mentioned problems with amiami.
>> ARTICLE
I use Tokyo Otaku Mode, personally.
>> ARTICLE
And you support their shifty practices? I mean I've bought from them before since they sometimes carry older figures that are sold out elsewhere in brand new condition, but once they suddenly stopped doing their discounted free shipping promo events (normally it's $100+) I completely dropped them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what you mean by their "shitty practices." Not trying to be smart, I simply don't know. As for the shipping issue (I don't personally consider your point an issue) I pre-ordered the new link nendoroid from them and got free shipping as part of a promotion. Also came with a free display case.
>> ARTICLE
Aside from their occasional restocks of older hard-to-find figures, Otakumode has a thing for sly business tactics but it's not obvious to people who don't do a bit of research. I'm not saying this as a fact but as speculation, but I've always received e-mails from them about "exclusive" sales in the past and would sometimes check on the items available and their price. Prior to this however, I had my eyes on a certain item that was apparently on sale before this "exclusive" sales event (it was like $36.99), and when this sales event started I noticed that the price was exactly the same except they added a $44.99 right next to the original price and marked a "cut" to make it seem like the item had some sort of "discount", but in reality it didn't.

Otakumode also used to have discounted shipping promo events where it wasn't always $100+ free shipping or a certain item qualified for free shipping regardless. They used to be generous and held promotions where that $100+ free shipping went down to $50 or even $30 at one point. I'd be lying if I said that I missed those days...
>> ARTICLE
Sure i would go with [Hobbysearch](http://www.1999.co.jp/eng/10356724) or [Hobbylink Japan](https://www.hlj.com/) . i have personally used them and they are reputable sites too
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck do you know about being reputable you reposting karmawhoring piece of shit?
>> ARTICLE
How much was shipping?
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I appreciate it!
>> ARTICLE
Never had a problem with Amiami. I buy almost all my figure from them. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you had to deal with their god awful customer service?
>> ARTICLE
Thankfully no. Like I said, never had a problem with them. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuck Amiami. I've tried buying items from them twice and they're refusing to sell items to me nor are they replying back saying why.  Their first email back to me was something to the tune of "We have rejected your order, please do not contact us. We will not respond to any replies." Fast forward a few months. I bought some items on amazon.co.jp. Apparently some of the items I bought were from Amiami. Again, they cancelled my order and refused to answer any questions. I haven't had any issues buying from any other retail stores like hobbysearch or any other sellers from Rakuten and amazon.co.jp.

Here is their email to me if anyone is interested:

  
   


>> ARTICLE
First off, why is your email in Japanese? Secondly, you do know that amiami has an english website, right? I've ordered from them many times without any problems and all of my emails from them were in english.
>> ARTICLE
Because I use a Japanese Address.  Registering on the Japan site has the prefecture, municipality, city, block, wards address lines better suited for exactly what I need to put in.  Registering on the English site only has the generic Address line 1/Address Line 2/City/State lines which isn't really tailored for a Japanese address. Fearing risk of getting my stuff lost in the mail due to a crappy address, I signed up on the Japanese site.

And you can't sign into the English site if you registered on the Japanese Site and vice versa.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah amiami has good prices but their customer service is beyond horrible and not knowing shipping costs is also a big thing
>> ARTICLE
I use Tenso.com forwarding service to ship my stuff out. When you sign up with them, they give you a Japanese address.  You buy your items like normal but use their address as the shipping address. So you can buy things from multiple sellers, combine them into one package and have that package shipped to you. Shipping is still pretty expensive, but if you want to buy things from multiple sellers, it's a good way to go.
>> ARTICLE
Are you have a bad track record keep cancelled an order on that site? I've never have a problem with amiami, it's amazing site and price just good. But indeed the biggest cons of that site, they never put an estimated shipping cost before you put an order. So if you dont like a shipping, you need cancel it. And they are disheartedly against it and will blacklist you if you keep do it
>> ARTICLE
Nope, the first time I ordered, they refused to sell stuff to me.
>> ARTICLE
I bought a fumo from them and they sent me one with a ripped skirt. When I complained they said they'd either put 3 dollar credit in my account (it was like 25 dollars) or I would have to pay for shipping on both return and replacement. Which is like, 40 dollars total.

I told them to fuck off, and that was the first and last amiami order I placed.
>> ARTICLE
Or just wait for your closest anime convention and buy it from the merchant's room for $80.
>> ARTICLE
Amiami are always super nice to me when I need anything, and their packaging is very secure yet lightweight. Definitely would recommend.

It really amazes me how a webcomic made by a mediocre artist was able to become one of them most beloved animes of all time
>> ARTICLE
It's not mediocre... his arts/designs meant to be that way to build the stories. Look at other characters and when the main character when he becomes serious. The artist and art designs are anything but mediocre.

I'm sure he confused it with the manga, which isn't drawn by the dude that did the webcomic, though he does the story? I think. 
>> ARTICLE
Is he flying in pic 7?  If so, how?  Another stick that we can't see?
>> ARTICLE
it has a plastic support that connects to the back and allows you to move it around
>> ARTICLE
The stick looks like this:

http://i.imgur.com/KJwlFVq.jpg
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I have some Nens, I just didn't think that stand was stable enough in their backs to support flight.
>> ARTICLE
You can tighten or loosen the joint with the screw on the side.  I don't think I trust the peg inserted in the body that much though, to have them displayed like that.  Just for a short time or photograph.
>> ARTICLE
I have two of the Attack on Titan Nendoroid's and they're both "flying" and have been since I got them. No issues with them staying elevated (though Levi's hole for the peg in his back was not wide enough, so I had to make some modifications).

Finally a nendoroid I would actually buy!

I've always wondered how they switch the facial expressions. Do they have separate heads or something?

My toon link one has separate faces you can put on, but I think this one just has different heads

It would make sense. Most figures have hair that cover the face-swap edges but this guy....

DO WANT.

Didn't think they could make him look any cuter

Is it just me or does his head look a little to big?

I think it's about time I start collecting these.

Damn it, just when I said I was done collecting these things.

A bobble-head would be awesome too.

I wonder if Lord Boros would get a figure.

Or Garou, or Sonic, or Mosquito Girl, or Tatsumaki, or Bang, or Blizzard. 

Shit, this series is going to milk all of my money if these figures come out.

Tatsumaki would have the plus of being close to scale.

where did he get it and why on earth is he wearing that Madoka dress.

The guy in the dress is [jParecki](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW62aW5p76SWU_L9l2qDghQ), another youtuber who does guitar covers among other things.
>> ARTICLE
Asian guy in a dress is something I see way too often on anime covers.
>> ARTICLE
Just to clarify for you - the kazoo man and the guitarist in the Madoka dress are two different people, the Guren no Yumiya thing was a collaboration. Though the kazoo man does play Guitar... and drums... and sings... and plays one other instrument as well, though I forgot what he said it was when I asked him.

Why on earth wouldn't you wear a Madoka dress?

Because he does not know where he can buy one!

For real, his kazoo covers are godlike. Been subscribed to him for about a year and they never disappoint.

I'm not as big of a fan of hers as some of the others I've heard. She has a really breathy singing voice that makes it sound like she's trying to seduce the song.

I'm ashamed to say it took me a few seconds to realize that it was the same guy playing all the instruments and parts.

Maybe I just like One Punch Man way too much, but both the OP and this give me chills. Very well done

I was a little disappointed that there were no kazoos. Great cover anyways

Wow, this actually sounds really nice. Among the best english covers I've ever seen, honest to goodness. Subscribed.

Really well done.  Too bad the lyrics don't translate well/sound good in just english.
>> ARTICLE
Damn this is spot on. They better be hired for the English Dub. 
>> ARTICLE
It is just one guy, who does all of that !!
>> ARTICLE
The instrumental was better than the singing or lyrics. 

I feel like a lot of English covers change too much or end up using weird translations. They find a change of words that fit the syllables easily enough and run with that even if the translation is literal as hell (when poetic translation is much better for things like songs).

Wasn't awful, though. Just not to my taste.

if only everyone was that hyped about nichijou compared to OPM, we'd probably have a season 2.......
>> ARTICLE
Probably gonna get downvoted for this, but I've never seen anyone say anything positive about Nichijou ever outside of this subreddit. And I gotta admit I'm on board with them. The humor is just way too random for me. Feels to me like the spork-girl was the producer for this anime.   

EDIT: Truth is harsh, /r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
> The humor is just way too random for me.

Funny how easily you went from just your opinion to truth.
>> ARTICLE
Truth is harsh in terms of a lot of people agreeing with me, otherwise Nichijou would've been a bigger commerical success.
>> ARTICLE
Well it shouldn't surprise you so much. Reddit is kind of a hive-mind after all.

Personally, I kinda liked it but I had other things I wanted to watch at the time so I put it on hold and never picked it back up.

*Or* the BDs should be afordable.

well, then they'd be unprofitable....

you do know studios don't usually hire accountants, and lowering the price will not be well received amongst the people who actually paid that much

Then I found [this](http://www.amazon.com/Animation-Nichijou-Vol-10-Japan-KAXA-3223/dp/B004V1ZCAW) for way more. Is there a difference besides one being Blu-ray? Does the more expensive one come with extra content? 
>> ARTICLE
no, no extra content at all

but usually, blue ray is in higher res. with 60fps vs 30fps, and that 30 fps make  huuuuuge difference if you're watching for action/animation


>> ARTICLE
Well, both of them don't have English subtitles, so won't get far there unless you know Japanese.

After finding a ([better listing](http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/KAXA-3223)) the only difference is that they are BD. But those two you listed aren't from official stores (Amazon, HMV etc etc) so prices can fluctuate on their end.

You also have to think of the economics of it. Making anime isn't cheap, money has to come from somewhere and (If I recall) they don't make ANY money having it on TBS etc etc. They pay for their anime to be put on the station (Advertising it) Companies have to make back their money somehow (Merchandising, licensing it to Sentai/Funimation etc)

1:09 to 1:13 is amazingly well done.     

Also, not enough Mio. Most of her crazier scenes fit the song.

mio....

i think the ending was good tho.....
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god this is amazing. 

The ironic thing is that nichijou animation is almost as good. Shame they didn't use the hallway running scene though...
>> ARTICLE
almost as good? I'd say its better. Nichijou maintains its level of animation throughout while the only remarkable animation in One Punch are the action scenes
>> ARTICLE
Isn't that the main joke of One Punch Man, though?
>> ARTICLE
But aren't action scenes the only part where animation quality is more noticeable?
>> ARTICLE
Are you implying that the animation quality of non-actions scenes is unimportant?
>> ARTICLE
No, just that it's harder to tell the quality of the animation when there is less to animate.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely [relevant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YamWNqHQvgQ)
>> ARTICLE
No that simply means it's shitty animation. Even the most mundane things can be animated beautifully if you put the effort into it. 

Like [entering a room](http://i.imgur.com/8hF0spd.gif) or [drawing](https://33.media.tumblr.com/5dea3126874ad956e07cf1b46b4e4c7b/tumblr_mocacaO7Me1rrlw41o1_500.gif) or even just [a city street.](http://i.imgur.com/HZBkDtC.gif) 

>> ARTICLE
"Effort" seems to be just adding a shaky cam. You're third example is just terrible if you want to demonstrate great animation, it's literally still images with falling petals. Nothing about that screams "great animation".
>> ARTICLE
>"Effort" seems to be just adding a shaky cam

what does a "shaky cam" have to do with anything? 

>You're third example is just terrible if you want to demonstrate great animation 

Things that don't move are also part of animation. They provide a reference frame for things that do. 

I'm not sure what you are trying to say, other than arguing for the sake of arguing. Are you going to put in the "effort" of providing counter examples? If not then why bother replying just to say you don't like the examples? 
>> ARTICLE
There's not much moving besides the camera. Hence "shaky cam". None of the pictures have model changes. There aren't continuous camera pans that change the viewpoint of objects.There's just not that much that's you know, animated.  They're pretty, but that's different from well animated.
>> ARTICLE
I guess you could argue that for the 2nd one, but not the first one. The entire room is CGI, if you didn't notice. 
>> ARTICLE
Oreki meeting Chitanda for the first time is the starting point in their relationship. It's by no means just a scene of "entering a room".

Also, comparing a movie to anime series is like comparing TV series to movies - a lot different sizes of their budgets and workforce.
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Where are these from?
>> ARTICLE
The first one is [Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka). Excellent animation quality for 20+ episodes, coupled with an extremely subtly executed coming of age story. Some mysteries too. Give it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
Subtly, but the last episode hits you with it at full force.
>> ARTICLE
[Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka), [The Garden of Words](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16782/Kotonoha_no_Niwa) and [5 Centimeters Per Second](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter). 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! Will add them to my PTW
>> ARTICLE
I don't like when people compare Garden, 5CM, or Redline to an anime series. Those were standalone movies with a focus on beautiful animation, and shouldn't be held against a show where focus is often put elsewhere.

I'll give them Hyouka to an extent, since it was gorgeous.
>> ARTICLE
Was never comparing. Simply making the argument that non-action scenes can be animated well. 
>> ARTICLE
Your first example isn't really a mundane scene. It's probably one of the most important establishing shots in the franchise. The fact it was animated on ones means it's not a non-important scene. Second example contains almost no animation aside from a couple inbetweens. Same with the third.

I agree with you in that animation in non-important scenes can look better but none of your examples showed that. Any random scene in Hyouka where the characters talk would be enough to prove your point.
>> ARTICLE
Good animation doesn't need to mean "laborious" or "high-effort" or "a shit ton of keyframes". Good animation is beautifully making still-images come to life, which is definitely established in the second and third examples. 
>> ARTICLE
I think you're confusing animation with visuals. Animation is strictly based on how smooth and consistent movement can be and has nothing to do with post processing used in the examples above. 

Whether the character maintains proportions when moving or using tricks to compensate for a lower framerate. [Here](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZQQmaopajrBNS/giphy.gif) is an example that goes with what I mentioned above. Notice how even non-important scenes can be animated better.
>> ARTICLE
I was going to say better, but last time I questioned the unrivaled animational superiority of OPM, fanboys came out of the woodwork to rip me a new one. 
>> ARTICLE
UNRIVALED???

sir, you're in the wrong side of the opinion

OPM is great, but has only yet to be entered in the very good animation, and above that there's god like (idk, some would say nichijou has god like animation)

but yeah, OPM is no where near unrivaled, 

you got a bunch of good shows you haven't watched, and get hyped
>> ARTICLE
....not really following you. What?
>> ARTICLE
I think he thought that you said one punch man had unrivaled animation, and then explained that you have a lot of really good shows left to watch if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
It seems like /u/_vogonpoetry_ was questioning the *opinion* that OPM's animation was superior, but then got backlash for doing so, at which point /u/1832vin misunderstood, thinking that /u/_vogonpoetry_ was saying that it was unrivaled, when in fact, they were saying the opposite. The take away is: no matter what opinion you have here in /r/anime, someone will vehemently disagree with you. 
>> ARTICLE
#AMEN!!!
>> ARTICLE
But Nichijou's character designs are way simpler compared to everything in OPM except Saitama's face (purposely simple for comedy). Simple and clean = easier to animate.

the moment you add "too much" to any such quantity statement it becomes redundant, because by the very phrasing of the words "too much" means that you have already crossed the line of what is good for you, no matter how far that line stand.

Mirroring is merely just to make it easier for the people to see the content, and I put the source in the comments for the people who preferred a better quality video.

Mirroring takes more effort than not to mirror.

>> ARTICLE
I like a woman with a full figure. Don't get me wrong, Tatsumaki is attractive, but I don't really like short women.
>> ARTICLE
Bueh, to me it's just people jumping in the bandwagon. Even in the manga she was a pain in the ass until she became kinda friends with Saitama and co.
>> ARTICLE
I fell in love at first sight. And not too long ago wasn't everyone all over Tatsumaki instead of the other way around? Wtf happened?
>> ARTICLE
There's three girls in the series: Fubuki, Tatsumaki, and unimportant Lily (Works for Fubuki).

People are going to choose sides and flip flop around. The competition for Best Girl is going to be fierce due to there only being two sides of either curvy babe or legal loli, especially when Best Waifu was already won by Genos.

In my opinion, Tatsumaki also has a more stereotypical personality.

I will never understand why people keep saying Tatsumaki is a loli. [These](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/onepunchman/images/6/65/Tatsumaki_design.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150508094046) are not the hips of a loli. I mean, Christ!

>> ARTICLE
One of her jokes is being constantly mistaken as a child, your argument is bullshit.
>> ARTICLE
>I will never understand why people keep saying Tatsumaki is a loli.

Because she behaves like a child.
>> ARTICLE
acting childish = loli?

Where did this new thing came from?
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Tatsumaki is a **short woman** (who also happens to have small breasts). That's it.
>> ARTICLE
Also acts like one and appears to be a child even though she's not.

Boom. Criteria met.
>> ARTICLE
If a woman with huge boobs acted like a child would she be a loli? Acting like a child is not a criteria to begin with...and if I say anything more it end up being spoiler
>> ARTICLE
Well it's not a big criteria, but it does add to how loli someone is.

As for that question, it depends how developed the rest of her body is.
>> ARTICLE
So, suppose someone has a loli like body but acts like an adult, she is a loli, right?

but if someone has an adult body but acts like a child then she isn't a loli?


This pretty much proves that acting like a child is no criteria at all
>> ARTICLE
There's no point in debating it man. I completely agree with you and have made the same argument before but everyone else just wants to call her a loli...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I swear I do this on every thread, it's ridiculous. Everybody is a goddamn loli with these people. I give up.
>> ARTICLE
As a guideline if she looks like a child and acts like one, she's a loli.

Isn't that the definition of a term?
>> ARTICLE
>acts like one

If you are anime only or manga only, you don't know much about the S class heroes fam, so I will just let you know that the Boros arc is superficial regarding the S class heroes characterization
>> ARTICLE
Well the point of contention is whether or not she physically looks like a child. We simply disagree there so I'll leave it at that. I also don't really know if she acts like one either, she's just kinda bitchy tbh. Idk when that became criteria either though, there are a ton of lolis that don't act like children.
>> ARTICLE
She's a legal loli.
>> ARTICLE
Best type of Loli.
>> ARTICLE
Yup all the fetish, none of the moral, legal, or cultural problems. Everyone wins.
>> ARTICLE
Not just her being short. Like said, she's immature and childish. She also has noticeable but definitely flat breasts. The curves aren't nearly as defined when you take proportions into consideration and she has an overall appearance and body of a child.

Therefore, I conclude that she is a loli.

>> ARTICLE
So like...I don't remember/recognize Fubuki at all. Anyone wanna refresh my memory?
>> ARTICLE
She's only really introduced in the next few chapters in the manga. That said shes not really a major character as far as I can see, I havent read ONEs web comic, only Murata's manga adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
Current webcomic arc focuses on her and Tatsumaki's relationship
>> ARTICLE
yeah I thought the same I didn't remember her at all I thought maybe I fell asleep watching one of the episodes
>> ARTICLE
Remember when Saitama was being promoted to class B? They called that blue haired guy (Mr. Liar Mask?) to help the association decide but he declined. They then called Fubuki.


Might not be 100% accurate. I suffered some memory loss transitioning from anime to manga to webcomic. The graphical differences is traumatizing, but I know it will be worth it. I hope Q.Q

She appeared briefly in the episode 6, voiced by the one and only, Hayami Saori.

If I recall correctly, she only has one very short scene in the show. Not really much to remember her by.

Sorry, but am I missing something? Fubuki seems to get so much love yet in the anime she was shown for like a minute. Is there a reason for this? Or is it mainly because of manga readers?

whats great is that iirc, the manga had a popularity poll when she'd barely had any time shown still - she won that hands down.  She beat Saitama and Genos for goodness sake.

Wait, what? I need to find a better place to read OPM. In the version I read that little piece of info isn't there.

I actually wouldn't be surprised by it at all. Although I did expect it to be real when the comment said spoilers.

Considering a legal loli is number 2 the rumor isn't all that shitty lol.

It's the John Wick or Dredd of anime. Everyone working on OPM just understands what the show is. It isn't pretending to be something its not, or trying to be like some other show. It's cohesive.

I think it does owe as much to Keanu Reeves being very watchable as an action hero as it does to the stuntmen who made the film. Reeves has fight choreography pretty much nailed for some reason, even though I'm fairly certain he has no background in any martial arts. He did do some judo and jujitsu to prepare for the film, though.

He may not have decades of martial arts training (or maybe he does?), but he does have decades of *hollywood*-martial arts experience. The dude just has kicking on-screen ass perfected down to a science.

You will not be disappointed. No high-minded philosophy, no social satire, true to the source material.

Just a fun romp of kickass action and jokes. It's a comedy first, so even when shit is going down it's leading to a punch line. 

>> ARTICLE
Heh
>> ARTICLE
No kids or high schoolers either. Just a grown ass man who's powerful and no one respects him.
>> ARTICLE
I think there's "high-minded" philosophy, in OPM. It's just not pretentious or ham-fisted into dialogue. It's also a story that everyone can relate to. Saitama was in a deep existential crisis and damn near depressed before he met Genos. Hell Saitama was that way before he saved the kid with balls for a chin. But he found his true purpose and came out of that funk. Finding your calling is some important shit. Some might say it's the most important shit.
>> ARTICLE
>It's a comedy first, so even when shit is going down it's leading to a punch line.

Agreed, but regarding the story of OPM, - this major theme of OPM hasn't really been introduced yet so I'll tag it - [OPM Spoilers](/s "I really enjoy that the original writer didn't settle with just making a comedy/action story but also makes a real commentary on a "true" hero, therefore giving OPM even more substance. Based on how good the story in the manga is and how much better the Anime is, I'm sooooooo pumped up.")

I'm REALLY looking forward to the [](/s "aftermath of the meteor"). In my opinion, that's the first time you see Saitama defined as a character.

What I find so incredible is that they captured the source material damn near EXACTLY the way it was meant to be. And not only that, but Murata adapted it from ONE's original EXACTLY the way it should have been re-drawn. The fact both those feats were done so well is mind-blowing to me.

I know people have said it before, but OPM makes me feel like a kid again. I'm a grown ass man, and this show has me waiting up every Sunday night for the next release.

Lets just say that the original ONE manga was the "Name" or storyboard that would become the fantastic manga/anime adaptation... without it there is no OPM. I wish there were more creative minds that didnt care about the drawing and tried to express their idea anyway they could in hopes that a talented artist would redraw it.... lets be real... sometimes the best artists arent always the best story writers

But a great story can also get ruined by crappy writing.
>> ARTICLE
>You mean see both?

Yes.

> There is also the original crappy drawn manga.

The original is kind of an acquired taste. One that still irks me a little, and I only read because I love the series as a whole... The other two, however, are enjoyable by almost everyone that likes the respective medium.
>> ARTICLE
If it can't wait till next year to see where the original is headed, then the taste can be picked up easily. Do like Pig God.
>> ARTICLE
I find the original hilarious because of how crappy it is. And the redraw hilarious because of how phenomenal it is. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, I had no idea there was a crappy webcomic, is that the very first original one? Why is the animation (and writing, honestly) so bad? Was this like an aspiring mangakas first every project or something.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the awful art just exacerbates the hilarity of Saitama's character. Especially that one page full of panels leading up to him picking his nose.
>> ARTICLE
Both have strengths and weaknesses.

The webcomic is drawn in a rough comic style; Saitama in the webcomic, while goofy, is the standard rather than the exception. This causes the webcomic to really shine in the development of plot (and laughs).

The manga redraw is nearly the opposite; Saitama is goofy in utter contrast to the rest of the world. This causes us to focus even more on Saitama *the hero* and not just as the main character. This focus is multiplied when Saitama appears to be serious, suddenly flush with the rest of the seriously-drawn world, and standing out that much more in comparison to his usual self.

just start the webcomic anew. It has a different style to it, despite the plot being the same, so I think it would really be worth your time to read the ONE version.

Man, I don't know if I've come across a show recently that's been so analyzed so thoroughly when it comes to who's responsible for which animation and all. I think Space Dandy got some love this way (which makes sense, since they share a lot of the same animators), but holy wow. I mean, I love it because I'm really enjoying learning more about the anime industry, but it's pretty crazy and cool to see all the attention it's getting.
>> ARTICLE
If you want to learn more about the anime industry, you should watch Shirobako. It's an anime about making anime and it's really interesting to see the process go from pitching a show to a completed product. 
>> ARTICLE
I think of Space Dandy like an arthouse exhibition, as if Watanabe gathered up all the greatest animators and directors he could find, threw money at them and told them to make a story about a Dandy guy in space, and it ended up really good.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, that's pretty much literally what he did. Each episode was essentially done by a different team. Some up and coming industry people and some legends. Sometimes match ups that have never happened. Stuff like that. 
>> ARTICLE
> I think Space Dandy got some love this way 

Dandy got [a lot of love] (https://vanishingtrooper.wordpress.com/2014/12/30/a-look-at-the-sakuga-and-animation-of-2014/) from the "sakuga" fandom, its just harder to find since most of the time these pieces are posted on peoples own blogs. Its great to see that ANN has noticed that people are interested though, everyone wins by learning more about the things they enjoy.

That's cause there's only like... three female characters in the entire series. So few that Murata goes all out when one does show up. I mean did you see Mosquito Girl?

Even if one doesn't want to delve deep enough to know animators by name or anything of the sort, it's nice to appreciate the one who drew the cuts in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
What secret? It's a good story and they animated it well. That's all it takes to have something marketable when you're not catering to children, teens and fan-service-obsessed plebeians. 

Cohesion is all it takes. If everything fits and the starting concept is engaging, people will resonate.

>> ARTICLE
Its a madhouse show. There is no season 2.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the do make season two. I can name diamond ace from the top of my head and searching in Google would probably show more shows with season two. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a poor reason to say there's no season 2 was because its madhouse. Just because a company never had a record of creating a season 2 doesn't mean they will never try to create one.

The reason season 2 won't appear for a long time is because the next arc is very long and the manga is barely halfway there.
>> ARTICLE
Why couldn't they just adapt it straight from the ONE material? 
>> ARTICLE
The anime uses panels from the Murata version as key frames for the anime.
>> ARTICLE
True but I'd have faith in Madhouse to create quality animation from basically scratch. Especially since they'll already have a solid history of drawing all the characters and backdrops, it shouldn't be too difficult to keep up the quality.

Sadly, I think the other guy who replied to me is right in saying that it'll never happen because the anime is just an advertisement for Murata's manga redrawing. 
>> ARTICLE
Well Onepunch is a Shonen Jump series and a lot of their shows are either ongoing or getting multiple seasons so you never know. 

Edit: Judging from what I've seen on Bakuman, Jump tends to give their mangakas a lot of flexibility in regards to anime production, so ultimately I guess its up to ONE to decide whether or not he wants another season.
>> ARTICLE
Because the anime only exist to advert the Murata version, there is no reason to show something that still dont happen in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
can anyone who can speak Japanese post other scores from this season so we can see how OPM is doing relative to its peers?
>> ARTICLE
[According to this page](http://www.anikore.jp/chronicle/2015/autumn/ac:tv/), One Punch Man is #1 of TV anime for autumn.

Safe to say scores are not reliable until the full season has aired and people are allowed to reflect on its entirety.
>> ARTICLE
Well you can't really say that now. Since the tv viewership and its income is nearly non existing no one really cares about that.

Where the success kicks in is in the BD - sales, boost in the sales of the source material and merchandize. Therefore to say if an anime did horrible - not good - fine - good - great - absolutely good , we'll have to wait some time maybe even a year or two ( we mustn't forget that anime is a long running income source through continuing sales, re airing and so on )

Personally I can only think of an huge success. The already high sales on the source material got even higher. It was Japan's most anticipated anime adaption ( and as we see madhouse is doing a great job ) so I guess an success is guaranteed. 
>> ARTICLE
Plus, isn't the studio bringing in (outsourcing) to top/great Japanese animators for different scenes/episodes?
>> ARTICLE
That's what I've heard as well. Seems like they are fucking killing it too.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much what the article stated. The secret of One-Punch Man's success is Shingo Natsume. He's the one bringing cool people in.
>> ARTICLE
I always love learning about this stuff. It's interesting to read and see just what goes into making something of such quality. Yeah it has its flaws, but it's amazing nonetheless. It's also nice learning about just who did the animation for it, rather than lumping it all together and saying "It's really good because Madhouse did it," but it's not just that. The people behind it are all incredibly passionate and they've done wonderful projects, and I'm grateful that they're putting their all into this.
>> ARTICLE
Keep your explanation to 20 words or less!
>> ARTICLE
How come they mentioned Madhouse and Murata, but they didn't mention ONE? I mean, he created the dang story
>> ARTICLE
Very interesting read.

I don't usually read these articles but I read through this one.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, no one else on Reddit reads articles. Frankly, I'm amazed you actually did. I just read the headlines and guess what the article is saying. This is especially useful when I want to have an angry rant about something I'm very poorly informed about.

On a serious note, a lot of the ANN articles that get to the front page here lately have been a lot higher quality than when I originally started seeing them. The quality seems to have gone up, although I'm not a regular of the site by any means, I just see them posted a lot. The quality used to be very sketchy there.

>You, probably.

>we'll see the anime world's time honored tradition on trashing overhyped shonens start soon enough.

Except OPM is about trashing stupid shounens, it sounds like you barely grazed over the manga not bothering to understand how meta it is.  


>> ARTICLE
See, this is how people end up calling fans like you blindfolded. A blind defense of a show is no better than blind hate.

And at no point did I say One Punch Man was a bad show. But of course, these things don't matter to you, do they? All that matters is that you punish anyone who dares speak against your favorite shows in the slightest way.

And there's no denying OPM is overhyped. Certainly it deserves a good portion of it, but 2/3k upvotes for every discussion thread is an inflated number and you know it.
>> ARTICLE
If people trash OPM for being an over hyped shounen they're fucking morons, that's what I'm getting at.  Your prediction of how OPM will actually be criticized is wrong.  I'm not blindly defending it, I'm calling you out on not understanding what type of narrative OPM is trying to accomplish.
The criticism will come from wether or not ONE has made a viable commentary on the themes present.
>> ARTICLE
What... the fuck are you talking about? /u/snowywish wasn't saying OPM is an overhyped shonen, he was saying the show itself was overhyped. Which is true for any show as popular as OPM, it's just how anime works.

> The criticism will come from wether or not ONE has made a viable commentary on the themes present.

This part I just don't understand at all. Whether it makes a "viable commentary" is the only outlet of criticism the show is able to receive? It's perfect in every other aspect? This is the exact definition of overhyping, stating a show is devoid of flaws because of the current excitement/fandom the show has. Madoka Magica and NGE both make amazing critiques of concept of their settings but I can still think of criticisms for it.

>> ARTICLE
There prob is a circle jerk (Like most popular animes have), but it's absolutely certain OPM is popular among a lot of different audiences with it's beautiful animation, hype soundtracks, and the humor. This causes it to get the upvotes it gets, it's just a likeable anime. I personally love OPM and don't mind the huge amount of hype its receiving, it's a very satirical and refreshing anime. Not to mention the anime adaptation has been so faithful to the manga. Now you don't have to think it's the anime sent from the gods, hell you can even hate it, just don't be surprised or confused by the hype/success its receiving.
>> ARTICLE
but the episodes are only gonna get better
>> ARTICLE
I've read the mangas. I know what's coming.

That aside, I won't be one of the people trashing OPM. I'm just about as certain that these people will come about as the sun will rise tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
You can't say that, though. I love OPM just as much as the next guy but it's stupid to definitively say that the episodes will only get better. People thought Attack on Titan was going to be pure perfection, many thought it already was. Now people in the community think it's pretty average (though it's still wildly popular).

I don't know why /u/snowywish is being downvoted. He's only being reasonable, he hasn't even shit on the show at all. But I guess this is what happens when you try to be objective towards r/anime's anime of the year.
>> ARTICLE
No idea why hes getting downvoted but its pretty clear its gonna get better since the next 6 episodes will cover 3 arc and each will be better than the one before. and the next ep will be one of the best yet. 
>> ARTICLE
>It hasn't even been a decade since his first showing as Animation Director in Welcome to the NHK #4, which established him as a young animator to look out for due to his charismatic loose art and interesting layouts.

We just went over episode #4 in the rewatch thread, and nearly everyone commented on how ugly it was. Some people nearly dropped it. I'm guessing that it *was* for artistic effect, but the sudden introduction of a massive amount of [off model animation](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel) was strange and hugely inconsistent with the rest of the anime. This was also, of course, his very first job.
>> ARTICLE
I also think that is is refreshing to have a main character as different as OPM is. Most stories the main char is always training and learning from his fights blah blah blah same shit every anime right? We still love that shit but it is repetitive. 

OPM comes along and everyone is expecting the same formula. Then BAM OPM surprises everyone with a different twist on the hero story. Has some good humor and doesn't take itself to seriously. It is a really fun show.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the article would discuss the success in terms of the heroes and it being a parody of the shounen trope.
>> ARTICLE
So is Majin Bone worth watching? I'm curious to see Murata's work toward actual animation
>> ARTICLE
Nope. The CG fights are better than this show deserves, while the 2D art is low detail, low budget. As for the rest - it's just a generic shounen geared towards a young audience to sell a digital card game. 

If you're thinking it might be a Shingeki no Bahamut situation - nope, it's completely unremarkable. 
>> ARTICLE
Its on HULU, does anyone know if its "censored" or "cut"? I REALLY want to watch this now.
>> ARTICLE
daisuki.net has all the episodes for streaming already I think.
>> ARTICLE
awesome thanks, are they HD?
>> ARTICLE
Yep but you have to create a free account to watch it in HD.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the heads up. I figured it would cost me so I never even checked. You're right though, 1080P with a free account. It got rid of the ads as well. Thanks again!
>> ARTICLE
Is this site better than hulu, I currently have hulu and they have it on there. Is it ALL censored till the blu-ray?
>> ARTICLE
I am not completely sure, ~~but they aren't like 360p or anything haha~~ (EDIT: I lied, looks like default is 360p, with a 480p option. You might get HD from registering). I don't think you have to register either cuz I was able to watch episode 6 right away. From my experience so far, there's a 30 sec ad right before the episode starts, and then one after the OP, but after that I didn't see another ad. Just in reply to what /u/arbeh said about registering and commercials :P
>> ARTICLE
I know when I sign in I get 1080p (though I have to select it a few times since their player sucks.)

I'm in Canada though so I only had ads for like a week and then they stopped entirely.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I didn't even look for the resolution option in the video settings. I watched on my PoS laptop which was having a hard time playing the video already anyways, I never bothered looking. So I guess without signing in highest it goes is 480p.

But they probably stopped spamming ads in their player in general after a time. Maybe found enough sponsors or some kind of revenue so that they don't need the ads anymore.
>> ARTICLE
If you register (it's free) it' there. Some countries have commercials as well (placed where they would be while the show is airing).
>> ARTICLE
eh... I wish I was more serious at times I want to know more about the world and more characters right now its just oh look a goofy hero that people dont know lets have him 1 shot things
>> ARTICLE
Keep watching and you'll get your wish.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean, but I still think it's hilarious. I honestly don't like gag animes/mangas. I've never been able to sit through the cringe puns/jokes and stuff. But this anime did it in a more subtle way where I found it hilarious. Some of it was stupid, but something about the MC being air-headed but also the strongest man even though no one else knows (except Genos) makes it hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
The success of webcomic is impressive too. It just shows people value the concept behind it or the funny/good story it has despite having a crappy art, that's the reason why a seasoned mangaka made it into a manga. I hope more people post their comic/fictionstory/novel online because you'll never know, your passion or hobby might get popular. just like how the author of OPM had a hobby of posting webcomic turned into an anime adaptation. mad respect.
>> ARTICLE
This is probably the same information... [but it's in audio visual format!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDmZM3GkYxU)
>> ARTICLE
I attribute the success to OPM being JAM Project
>> ARTICLE
whoa i think that first gif in mine! lol
>> ARTICLE
Wow, those visuals are pretty amazing, but how's the plot?  I might check it out, if only for a dose of mindless action, heh.  :-p
>> ARTICLE
The plot is straight forward. It's a comedy where the MC can beat all enemies with one punch. The jokes are great, the animation and fights are awesome, and it will only be 12 eps so it's a fast watch.
>> ARTICLE
it's a secret? haha
>> ARTICLE
The secret really is the way the manga satires all other anime super-powered heroes. Saitama-sama is boosted beyond belief from the first time we meet him so we don't have to go through 5 season or arcs and another 3 of fillers to achieve all the power to defeat the villain...Just three square meals a day and a vigorous exercise. As far as others complaints that there is no character development for one-punch man fail to see the point that he is already developed and we are just watching him three years after he changed everything about him to become a hero and in turn through new episodes you start to unravel his layers which to us are mundane, but him, it is a very important like Saturday sale at the store or wanting to square-off with an opponent regardless if that person is good or evil.
>> ARTICLE
Now I am more sad there's only 6 episodes left...
>> ARTICLE
Simply because concept is good which lacking on modern anime/ manga. You pick a random anime/manga, you will always find same formula used . Its really boredom me to the core, I am skip so many animes cause of this

>> ARTICLE
This series rocks! I was lukewarm on the series for the first 4 eps because it seemed episodic and not that interesting if it was going to be monster of the week.  However, ep 5 caused me to do a 180 with the introduction of the hero association.  Ep 6 was also great so I ended up reading the manga and original webcomic once I ran out of manga material.  Now I'm out of webcomic material and I'm sad cause I want more! I love one punch now! 
>> ARTICLE
It's a great anime, I can't wait to watch it every week - but let's be serious, under what measures is it a success? Do we have data on the japanese DVD sales?
>> ARTICLE
How would they have released a DVD of a series that isn't finished yet?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe preorder numbers or some other indicators?
>> ARTICLE
It's not unheard of. K Project started selling BDs like halfway through the first season. 
>> ARTICLE
It's good.

That's all, really.
>> ARTICLE
The "secret" is the manga and the webcomic..
>> ARTICLE
How is it that JUST when I discover One Punch Man the entire rest of the world discovers it too? I seriously clocked a link on TV Tropes about it and thought "Huh, that's pretty cool." Two days later the entire planet is exploding over it.
>> ARTICLE
Any news on the England dub? I am interested as to who they will choose to voice opm.
>> ARTICLE
This was way too long to say something so simple
>> ARTICLE
Best anime have seen so far, probably even on par with one piece and may be better. But how long can the creators keep it going... 1000+ episodes?? I hope. 
>> ARTICLE
If you're speaking just about the anime there are a ton of things better than One Piece. Most notably Hunter x Hunter.

That being said One Punch Man is an incredible piece of work and definitely rivals the best of the best.
>> ARTICLE
Hxh has already ended. It couldn't keep going long enough. One Piece is the best so far. Flamingo event is still going strong and the creators have noted that event only marks about halfway of the anime. OPM seems to have the potential of One Piece. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't you know we circlejerk HxH on this sub? Endless downvotes for you.
>> ARTICLE
Lol
>> ARTICLE
Yes HxH has already ended, doesnt change the fact it's the best shounen anime there is. I love One Piece but the quality of the anime is definitely sub-par. It's still very good because Oda is a genius but so little work goes in to creating those episodes because they are going to do well regardless of budget.

Imagine if One Piece had animation on par with One Punch Man, now that would be incredible.
>> ARTICLE
It's good. But too short. Gon's power seems to reach his limit at the end. I would love to see more though. And hope the creators would come back to continue his saga. But at the moment, One Piece remains and Luffy's continuing upping his power...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm not sure where he plans to go with Gon, unfortunately I don't think we'll ever find out.

I have speculation but it'd be spoilers and not really relevant.
>> ARTICLE
It might have been the best if it kept going. Also it's definitely not a fact it's the "best shonen anime", that's your opinion. It definitely has some of my favorite fights, but it had its flaws as well, pacing being one of them. I think HxH is amazing but definitely not that much more superior to One Piece. One could even argue YYH was better then HxH. Best shonen anime there is? Gurren Lagann or FMA:Brotherhood imo.
>> ARTICLE
You must realize just how stupid that sounds, right? A story's worth isn't measured in its length.
>> ARTICLE
no. how? you have any other anime to compare to make your point?
>> ARTICLE
Top tier anime:

* Shinsekai Yori. 25 episodes.

* Zetsuen no Tempest. 24 episodes.

* Fate/Zero. 25 episodes

* Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai. 50 episodes

The list goes on and on. Length has nothing to do with how good something is. In fact, the longer something goes, typically speaking, the worse it gets. Ever heard the phrase "jumping the shark"?
>> ARTICLE
Sure. But why are you upsetting over my opinions?! I have my own preference as much as you have yours.

To me length says a lot. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy short anime though. Some are very good too. Sadly, many of those short ones were too abruptly ended or were left open, or the creators didn't follow up for years, leaving many of us fans hanging. 

Thanks for the list however. There are couple in there I haven't watched yet. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not upset at all. I'm just pointing out that length is a horrible measurement of a series' quality.
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion Hunter X Hunter is a much better anime but One piece is a better manga.
>> ARTICLE
One Piece is definitely the better manga.
>> ARTICLE
It's really not hard being better than One Piece. The adaptation is shit.
>> ARTICLE
You have recommendation? I have watched quite a few different anime. I love to check out any anime I may have missed. 
>> ARTICLE
If you like One Piece, Dragon Ball, Naruto, Bleach, Gurren Lagann and Hunter x Hunter could be to your liking.
>> ARTICLE
All watched.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, how about Riding Bean, Iria: The Zeiram Animation, Golden Boy, Afro Samurai, Dr. Slump, Y Y Hakusho, Nadia and Shaman King? Shaman King has always been my favorite shounen anime, though I've heard it's quite different than the manga.

For something a little bit different I can recommend X, Dennou Coil, Legend of the Galactic Heroes (start with the movies) and Planetes.
>> ARTICLE
Hakusho and Shaman King are ok. I'll check out the others. 
>> ARTICLE
There is a lot of source material. the anime is currently on chapter ~20 of the manga and webcomic. The manga currently has 80 chapters, while the webcomic has 104.

They are following the source material. The current season is 12 episodes, and they don't have enough for another season after that. I do wish I could watch 1000 episodes of one punch man though.

>> ARTICLE
Just read the translated manga beside it.

I'll wait and see, If there's a studio r/anime likes to over-hype it's MadHouse. The animation looks fluid and vibrant, which is surprising because Madhouse's animation tends to be rather stiff and lifeless.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo is pretty much proof of how wrong you are.
>> ARTICLE
One exception doesn't disprove the trend. Parasyte was guilty of it, Death Billiards even more, Ore Monogatari while entertaining has some awful moments - the characters look simply robotic.

And Hajime no Ippo is not a good example. That's just like saying Naruto is beautifully animated, just because some scenes do look good while the remaining 99% look like utter crap. Hajime no Ippo has its moments, nothing else.

In your opinion. I like all of Ippo, it's really fucking good, and the badly animated parts are heavily outnumbered by the good.

I mean Overlord is pretty lifeless but... you know.

It's being directed by one of the people behind Space Dandy, which gives me more hope for the visuals than MadHouse ever did.

I honestly like it this way. Don't get me wrong, Sawano's music although extremely good is very repetitive. It's almost as if he wrote a one size fits all soundtrack for every show he works on rather than creating a unique soundtrack to complement the show specifically.

I think he's pretty good, very similar style to Sawano.

So much hype

Hype train ain't stopping

They don't show [whose rank one.](/s "That makes me giggle because anime-only viewers probably assume that's the One Punch Man, Saitama... Hehehehe...")

Also, I think they got the Hero rankings wrong in the video.

They change during the series. I think this is what they are at the start.

That was an awesome first episode especially the ANIMATION.  Damn can't wait for [Spoiler](/s "the Alien invasion arc hehehe especially Lord Boros fight and Genos best girl")

Man the list of characters in this show sounds more like rejected Megaman bosses. This shows going to be fun to watch.

Saitama punched through my doubts, he prevaled  where my hear was weak and did not hype, one punch was all it took...
that music, that animation... holy shit this is the show that will save anime HYYYYYYYYYYPE

>> ARTICLE
Can someone familiar with the series explain the power rankings?
>> ARTICLE
There is a hero association the mc does not know about it until later in the series so he does not get credit for any of his heroic acts so no one knows who he is. Basically its just a teir list. 
>> ARTICLE
When one first signs up to for the Heroes Association they take a placement test. From that test the Association members rank the heroes according to their perceived strength. For example: [Saitama/Genos Spoilers](/s "Genos passed the physical/written test with flying colors and was automatically ranked in the S class. While Saitama, despite having god like powers, failed and was ranked in the C class.")

Heroes are ranked in the following order. Strongest to Weakest (Rank 1 being the strongest in each category): 

S - 17 Heroes


A - 38 Heroes

B - 101 Heroes

C - 390 Heroes

To advance ranks heroes must perform feats of strength/kill monsters for the association. Now a hero can advance to the next class only when they reach rank 1 in their respective class. They can choose to either stay as rank 1 or become the bottom rank of the next class. Now you can't surpass someone in a rank 1 position and advance to the next class unless you show the association that you are stronger than the current rank 1. For example, Sweet Mask is A Class Rank 1 but could easily be a high ranking S class. He, for some reason, doesn't want anyone to advance to S class so he holds his A Class Rank 1 position with a tight grasp. I should note that like the Hunter's Association in HxH the higher your rank the more deadly the missions the association gives you. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's spoiler territory yet, but I get the impression that at some point Sweet Mask will be revealed to be stronger than all the S Class heroes as well. Then again, I don't think anyone has seen Blast, and the #2 S Class girl Terrible Tornado is pretty godlike too...
>> ARTICLE
Nope. Sweet mask is definitely S rank worthy but he is not strong as some of the higher members of S rank. You see him fighting near the end of the Garou arc.
>> ARTICLE
Do we really see him fight, though? I was thinking that by chapter 54 (waiting room 2) or so all he's been shown doing is mercing a few people effortlessly?
>> ARTICLE
OPM is based on an ongoing webcomic by ONE which I'm up to date with. In the original the garou arc has finished and during it you see Sweet Mask fight. He proves himself to be atleast as strong as mid tier S class but nowhere near the same region as the current Rank 2.
>> ARTICLE
Gotcha, I know of the webcomic but have only read the manga. Sounds like the webcomic is a bit ahead (I actually thought once the manga gained popularity the webcomic stopped). 

Thanks for clearing it up!
>> ARTICLE
No problem. If you enjoy the well drawn OPM then I recommend you read the webcomic as well. The art may not be as good but the humour is the same and OPM has so much filler in it which slows down the plot. Currently OPM is only about 20% in the Garou arc.
>> ARTICLE
The manga also seems to be diverging from the webcomic in terms of plot, so there's another reason to read the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
Some more specifics: the hero entrance score only determines what class you start at, as you start at the bottom rank of said class regardless of the score (though it might decide the ranking among various people entering at once).

So Genos, who got a 100%, enters S class directly at its bottom rank, bypassing Sweet Mask, the A-1 who serves as a gate-keeper against those potential unworthy of S class. If you think about it that's probably how Child Emperor became S-class too, instead of being in the initial batch (Genos is said to be the first in a while to score 100%, so consequently there's a precedent).
>> ARTICLE
One thing that should be mentioned is that ALL (iirc) of the S rank members at the start of the anime received their S rank directly without having to reach A rank 1 (their position within the S rank changes based on their missions). 

All of the current S rank used to be B or C rank but the admins noticed that these weirdos always beat the monsters almost always effortlessly regardless of how strong the monsters were. Meanwhile some of the A ranks were dying to some of the same monsters. So the admins created the special S class to accommodate the special low rankers who always win.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, basically the ranks used to be all about playing politics and PR so that you would get promoted based on popularity and ass-kissing. Once the A-rankers started getting wiped out by random monsters, though, they created a special tier for all of the heroes who were incredibly strong but couldn't be bothered playing politics. 
>> ARTICLE
MC is basically god his problem is he wants a good fight but he beats everyone and thing in legit one punch 
>> ARTICLE
I get that part. I'm mainly talking about the other characters.  In the video they are all s rank but is it better to have a higher or lower s rank number?
>> ARTICLE
Higher. Strongest would be s-rank 1.
>> ARTICLE
It's better to have a lower number within S rank. For example, S rank 3 is higher ranked than S rank 7.

Was that Piccolo at 0:20?

Parasyte pulled it off, why can't we be hopeful here?
>> ARTICLE
I think we should tamper expectations a bit. If they go above and beyond, awesome. But if it's moderately well done with action and crucial shots looking good, I'd be more than happy.
>> ARTICLE
I have high hopes actually. If you think about it a lot of One Punch Man's humour is based on timing, ONE is fantastic at pacing his version of the manga. I'm sure the anime can do a good job capturing that timing based humor at least. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah, ONE's art is pretty hard to beat.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how ONE feels about the fact more people like Murata's remake more than his original webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I would honestly imagine it would be like a webcomic in america getting picked up by Image and have the art done by Fiona Staples. I'm sure its a pretty awesome feeling to see your work in a printed format.
>> ARTICLE
It's still his story just with much higher quality art. I'm sure he understands the difference in quality is what helped the series to get an anime.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
for those that don't read the manga, is this the original art style or is it something else? i took a look at the manga some weeks ago and i dont remember looking like this
>> ARTICLE
OPM is originally a web comic created by ONE, which looks like the one linked above. Murata's is a remake of it, which now is serialized in Young Jump.
>> ARTICLE
I was writing a edit but will put as response here.

Just so people know what the joke is about. The user I replied probably meant to refer to Onepunch man, I know, but One is the author of the manga and webcomic (which I linked to). The art we fans are expecting is made by Murata Yuusuke (who also did Eyeshield 21) who is the artist behind the manga but not One who does the art for the webcomic. It was supposed to be just a little ol' switch-a-roo.
>> ARTICLE
That's the art from the mangas original creator [One](http://i.imgur.com/pjtCjy9.jpg). What you usually see is from the re-make done by [Murata](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/onepunchman/images/f/f1/Img000003.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131205222342).
>> ARTICLE
Gee thanks! Your comment solves all the doubt !
>> ARTICLE
Yes that is the original style done by the original creator, ONE. Eventually [Yusuke Murata](http://myanimelist.net/people/1903/Yusuke_Murata) decided that he would redraw the series while matching the content of the original panels.

[Example of original](http://img.bato.to/comics/2013/11/16/o/read528803dfb80ab/img000008.jpg)

[Example of Murata's](http://z.mhcdn.net/store/manga/11912/001.0/compressed/lopm_001_012.jpg?v=11350898681)
>> ARTICLE
Personally never had issues w/ ONE's original, there's enough information in there most of the time that you can fill in the blank in your own head.  Murata's conversion sometimes feels a bit too... deliberate.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry what? I understand the love for the original creator, but man oh man does Murata's conversion look SICK. There is simply no comparison in my opinion - think preschooler and professor at MIT.
>> ARTICLE
Probably no comparison if Murata's version is your first exposure.  I'd probably be thinking "how the hell was I able to look at this" if I went back to the original that's already been covered by Murata.  I got addicted to the original webcomics a long time back when I was going thru neet-sha's list of comics, and among one of its charms was certainly the paradox of a comic drawn seemingly so crude and simply having such ridiculous intensity.  Murata's done an exceptional job, certainly agree with that.

If I were to compare though, it'd be a high school film project vs a professional product.  Everything looks like it's done the wrong way and everything screams out amateur, but somehow it keeps drawing you in.
>> ARTICLE
From a comic-making perspective, ONE is actually rather adept at proper page constriction for such a low quality of art. Sure, he isn't perfect and fails in conveying information properly at times, but as a (seemingly) novice artist it's pretty damn good. I've seen pros *cough*bleach*cough* fail at page layouts worse than he does. 

His character designs may be crude and simple, but you can clearly tell them apart on the page (perhaps *because* they are so simple). By contrast, [in the last chapter of Attack on Titan, (minor SPOILERS)](/s "I didn't realize it was Major Hanji lying injured in the wagon because her design was so unclear without her glasses I couldn't tell her apart from anyone else (also, I forgot she got hurt a few chapters ago)")

I love Murata's redo, I really do. He fixes up a lot of the issues with page design, composition, panel flow, clarity, and MY GOD THE ARRTTTT, all of which comes from being an industry veteran with lots of talent. Is it necessary, though? Not really. You can read the original and understand it just fine and still understand everything pretty well. 

I don't really get what /u/frumply is trying to get at, though. While there IS such a thing as "too much clarity," where it gets insulting to the reader's intelligence, I wouldn't say Murata ever approaches anything close to that level. Maybe he thinks it's like Murata is jacking off in your face with all the "look at how good at comics I am!!" But frankly, I for one don't mind him covering my face with his glorious art talent juice. 
>> ARTICLE
Isayama is an excellent storyteller, but not quite as good at drawing. Probably better than One, but nowhere close to Murata.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, the story is totally the main draw for AoT, at least for the manga. Although, it can be said that Isayama's lower-quality art/lack of proper anatomy that helps make the titans look *so damn creepy*

My main point is that sometimes characters in AoT are hard to tell apart, whereas ONE is able to make characters easier to differentiate with much weaker art.

You should probably put those spoilers in actual spoiler tags, I was already reading them before my brain realised what I was doing.

O man , Genos and Saitama look bad ass
>> ARTICLE
I kind of don't like that; Saitama is supposed to be someone who everyone underestimates and who struggles to be taken seriously as a superhero. If he's all muscles then it's harder to understand why people think he's an easy target to be pushed around.

He's drawn as both bad ass and dumb ass ALL the time, it's part of the joke.

Oh you should read them both of them. Start with the Murata version then when you are finished with that and can stand some bad art go find the original.
>> ARTICLE
Are they both complete? I think I'm following one translation but it's certainly nowhere near a complete story.

Also, if I had to guess, I'd say it's probably the Murata translated, since the art's pretty awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Neither are still on going but they are the same story. Murata's version is about half way point compared to One's Original, and reading the original just makes waiting to see it all in Murata's art that much greater. One's story is so good you can't stop reading it and Murata's art is so good you want to read it again.
>> ARTICLE
I'll have to go find the original at some point. Thanks!

I would, but I can't stand reading manga unless I have a physical copy of the book. There's just something about manga on a screen that I don't like.

Why does every bald character look like Ikkaku to me
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if you are being serious, but it likely has to do with the way characters are differentiated in anime/manga. Most of the time, there are only minor differences in character's facial structure and silhouette so instead they use the character's hair and other accessorizing features like clothing to set that character apart from the rest of the cast. As such, if you have two characters who are bald, you end up having them look the same on a quick glance unless you spend extra time having one or both of them differ from the rest of the cast's design. 
>> ARTICLE
hmm then why don't half of dragon balls characters look the same?
>> ARTICLE
Krillin has no nose, Tien has a third eye, Piccolo's green and has pointy ears, Nappa has his facial hair.  I also like to think that Dragon Ball characters have eyebrows that stand out different from other series'.

The *real* question now is, which Sunrise studio will it be? As we know they have more than a dozen studios with varying quality.

>> ARTICLE
That one's closing I think
>> ARTICLE
That is indeed the million dollar question, hopefully it's their best one and that they get a solid director on board as well.
>> ARTICLE
And a solid budget as well.
>> ARTICLE
It's unlikely to be 5 as they are starting Gintama soon, unlikely to be 8 either as they seem to be preparing for more Love Live after the movie. I hope it's 3 as they did a great job for the action scenes of Build Fighters, but they haven't done anything non-Gundam related for a long time. 
>> ARTICLE
Not to dash your hopes, but it's unlikely to be 3 either. GBF is strongly hinting at a season 3 in the show, and recent tweets from the producers seems to imply the same thing.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope a 3rd season of GBF happens. Season 2 might not have been as good as season 1 but I still enjoyed it a lot and have been looking forward to the finals.
>> ARTICLE
If you were talking about the tweet that got picked up on /r/Gundam, that was just a tweet asking if the director can cameo some more gunplas, and nothing really about a third season.

The latest episode, though...many strong hints.

I'm actually thinking that it may be something along the lines of Studio 1, since they'll be done with G-Reco after this season, and they've done their share of non-Gundam works.

EDIT: And 8 probably will stop after the LL movie. That little teaser thing in the magazine a while back only seems to be a project within the magazine. The director of LL didn't even know about it until it was announced...so unless it's a new series with a completely different director, I don't think we'll have a iM@S Cinderella Girls version of Love Live.
>> ARTICLE
I hope it's not 1 since they are the most old school of all the anime studios and giving OPM to them would lead to the most safe version of OPM possible. I don't think 3 is likely too but they or 5 would be the best choices and the ones likely to create a great OPM adaption. 

The director of LL have already said things are moving without his knowledge, so it's likely there are plans for a LL series that he is not involved in.  
>> ARTICLE
I actually like the old-school feel of 1, but my top choice would be 5...although I doubt it because they would be too busy.

Regarding LL, the director of LL said that in response to the project that was released in the magazine. It's just as likely for a new series as it is a simple project only within the magazine.

If they're going to make a new series with the normal club members from the game, they'll have to be prepared to run about 4~5 different storylines at once, since they all come from different schools.

This made me want a one punch man anime one year ago. Now it's happening. My levels of happy are off the charts.
>> ARTICLE
I heard from my sister that this manga is actually have great story despite the premise that its about a man who beats people with one punch. 

So what's it about?
>> ARTICLE
http://www.reddit.com/r/OnePunchMan/comments/2yj7v8/a_possible_interpretation_of_the_plot_of_opm/
>> ARTICLE
It's about a superhero who, through a intense training regime, becomes one of, if not the, strongest heroes on Earth, strong enough to defeat any enemy with one punch. Problem is, he's become incredibly bored with the superhero life as a result, until he becomes the sensei of Genos, a cyborg who hopes to find and defeat the cyborg that killed his parents. Hilarity ensues

It's basically a comedic parody of superhero shounen shows, with nearly every trope of the genre either made fun of or taken to a natural conclusion.
>> ARTICLE
I just did a wiki on it. My OCD bothers me one thing. If he is possibly the strongest heroes, why is he ranked low? even Genos is ranked higher than him too. 

I don't look into plot as its too spoilery. Just powers and stuff. 
>> ARTICLE
In addition to what has been already said (he doesn't care about the reputation, no one really believes he can do what he says), my understanding was that's simply how the bureaucracy of the Heroes Association works. This may be a little spoilery, but nothing big is given away.

He passed the entry test (doing terribly in the written portion, and exceptionally in the physical portion to make up for his low score) with a mediocre total score, putting him at a low position of entry into the organization, while Genos topped the scores for both the written portion and the physical portion of the test, putting him at a top-level spot when he joined. But to advance in the ranks, you must first earn your way through your entire rank (obtain rank 1 out of the many members in your rank), and then you can start at the very bottom of the next rank. i.e. start at C-300, take part in enough fights to be promoted to C-1, then you can start at B-300 and repeat the process. And the fights required seem to mostly be quantity over quality too, which doesn't help the ranking up.

Basically, it's for comedy - higher ranking hero's treat him poorly because they think he's a low-ranking weakling, but they can't back up their talk.


>> ARTICLE
Most people don't connect his great deeds to him, mostly because he wasn't a registered hero, partly because [he looks so silly](http://i16.mangareader.net/onepunch-man/1/onepunch-man-3798641.jpg) (the pic is from the first chapter, so no worries of spoilers). They assume he was a weakling as a result.
>> ARTICLE
He's ranked so low because no one in the hero organization actually knows how strong he is. Seitama simply doesn't care for fame at all, so he never corrects anyone when people go with logical conclusions. He usually just goes home after his business is done anyway.

Seitama is basically Superman in a world that's operating at Saiyan arc Dragonball. He's so hilariously over powered compared to everyone else, that he doesn't care about what people think of him.
>> ARTICLE
are you saying the rank system is not based on power but reputation as well? Is that why the ranking system really is not a measurement of power?
>> ARTICLE
It is, but the MC barely passed the intellectual exam when he became a hero and his physical results were taken as a joke due to the ridiculous numbers he is able to achieve.

Basically he beat every single record on the physical tests but was dumb as a rock for the rest of it. So he starts at the bottom as the organization doesn't know what to do with him.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's a mix of power, reputation, and feats they've accomplished. One would lose rank if they just sat around doing nothing, and gain a ton of they personally saved a town from a threat, and stuff.
>> ARTICLE
There's never really any witnesses.  People don't believe him since he looks weak and they attribute his victories to someone else. And he really doesn't give a fuck about his rank.
>> ARTICLE
There is also a thing about him being too strong of a low rank that people starting to doubt him and pretty much see him as a phony hero. People think of him as a shameless hero who leech other hero's deeds.

Saitama himself doesn't give a shit about it though.

My hype is so fucking real.  Like no one has been this hyped since the end of the Great War. I am so hyped that if they ever found a way to convert hype to energy I would immediately go hypernova. Not some pussy ass supernova, no, I'm talking a "blow up a quadrant of the galaxy" type shit. I'd make Hiroshima look like a firecracker. I'm so hyped that of it doesn't at least meet half of my expectations my spirits will drop so hard that they create a singularity and the whole solar system is consumed.

Just look it up on amazon. They have them.

Personally, if you are going this route, you should probably buy the manga and then just read it on your computer.

Not for the anime, though. The anime key visual will probably pop up later. This just looks like some colored art Murata drew for this announcement.
>> ARTICLE
Are we 100% sure tho/?
>> ARTICLE
But not one piece of information about the staff or cast has been revealed. I doubt they would throw out a key visual into the media without any sort of information, particularly the character designer.

This was just an announcement that it's getting green-lit for an adaptation, and seeing that it was the same art as the one in Young Jump, I think it's safe to say it's drawn by Murata.
>> ARTICLE
What if Murata is also drawing for the anime?
>> ARTICLE
He probably won't be doing the character designs, though.

He'll do key animation. I've seen his name in Majin Bone in one of its earlier episodes where he seemingly drew key animation. But I don't think he'll do stuff like character designs. It'll be too detailed for anime.
>> ARTICLE
I keep hearing about this. Is this suppose to be a good series? I apologize but I am not familiar with it. I like good stories and would to know if this one has that.
>> ARTICLE
Read it and find out for yourself
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty awesome. Try it out!
>> ARTICLE
There's not really much to the story, it's just hilarious and over the top. The premise is essentially what happens when you make the main character so OP that it becomes funny. Like they build up an elaborate villain with an intricate plan and then the mc just walks in and wrecks their day. The world is also interesting as there is like a bureaucratic organization of heroes who fight off monsters and how the mc fits into that is pretty fun to read.

And it's not like Saitama uses toonforce either; the manga does a great job of being hilarious yet taking itself serious at the same time.

Its sarcasm. One's version is obviously not very beautiful. Or its beautiful in its own way.

I know about that, but at first it just didn't seem relevant to a post comparing Murata's version and the anime. Thanks for explaining! I don't understand the downvotes though, I didn't say anything bad about one, or the anime, or the manga.

Is the original ONE version pretty much comparable to the Duwang translation of JJBA?
>> ARTICLE
Every translation I've come across just searching randomly has been great. It's the art that isn't as good as the manga, but that's because it's just a sidejob, a hobby. ONE has been getting a lot better as an artist since he started OPM. Over in Mob Psycho 100 it's even more obvious how he's grown. The writing is very very good either way.
>> ARTICLE
Not at all, Duwang was a shitty translation done by a Chinese student fueled by his love of JoJo, ONE's version while badly drawn, you can easily follow the action and the drawings are pretty clear. Both are hilarious, but the web comic has a lot of merit on its own.
>> ARTICLE
Great job! Thanks for your hard work.

I really enjoyed the Genos vs Saitama fight in the anime better

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann has similar themes of ridiculously overpowered beings doing ridiculous things. Not as funny and OPM but just as epic.

Your example show is different type  from One punch man lol


Maybe **Gintama** (But its not for everyone and a lot of people gives up early since the comedy is not for them)

-Long running series

-Likes to parody other anime and anime throphes

-the main arcs are usually full of action/drama (but you dont get that till later on the show)

Its a series that has everything but its mostly a comedy anime.
>> ARTICLE
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
>> ARTICLE
Having never seen the show or read the manga... but being fully aware of all the hype.

Why are there two different manga pictures? One good looking and the other that looks like children's scrawl?
>> ARTICLE
The children's scrawl is the original webcomic by ONE, who wrote and drew OPM as a hobby, a freaking hobby, which is why there wasn't a lot of effort put into the artwork.

Murata loved the story so much that he asked ONE if he could redo the artwork, and ONE agreed.  [Here is more info in an interview with the two of them.](http://onepunchman.wikia.com/wiki/Interviews)
>> ARTICLE
The most important detail here is ONE was about to quit drawing. Murata didn't want him to quit because he wanted to do a collab with him one of these days. Murata was sick during that time, so in a YOLO move he contacted ONE immediately and asked for a collab.
>> ARTICLE
There's something you get reading ONE's version that is impossible with amazing artwork..
>> ARTICLE
Cancer?
>> ARTICLE
There is something oddly inspirational about ONE's webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. It shows that even with lackluster art you can still have a fantastic story. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually one of the first anime I know who not only took it straight from the manga but actually add their own creative taste to it too....just like Tokyo Ghoul and Akame Ga Kill ( both those two animes ended ....horribly )
>> ARTICLE
Saitama is really good looking when he's drawn seriously. Those eyes make such a huge difference. 
>> ARTICLE
That's my only issue with the series, I was hoping they would make him look serious all the time in the anime, but it makes sense considering it's more of a comedy than anything
>> ARTICLE
That's like the point of the entire thing...Even when Murata started drawing him, he still drew him as plain as possible.
>> ARTICLE
I like having him only being serious occasionally because it's much more rewarding, in my opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the fact that he doesn't look or act serious a lot of the time is a huge reason why the series is so popular.
>> ARTICLE
It's like the whole point of the show. It's a super serious Shonen with a completely out of place main character. If Saitama looked like everyone else and just had a goofy personality, it would be every other Shonen. One Punch walks a very fine line between comedy and Shonen-action and pushing it any further in either direction would ruin the dynamic 
>> ARTICLE
Dynamic artwork help differentiate comedic and serious moments to give both more depth. Bakuman touches upon this topic when dealing with a series that has only heavily-inked serious tones, lacking artistic whimsy. 

A good recent example of this is Shokugeki No Soma. People don't read manga/comics or watch animations for hyper-realism. :P

Chibi faces probably also make animation a lot easier.
>> ARTICLE
One of the funniest thing to me is that Saitama doesn't look any different from his original webcomic counterpart.

[](/s "Garou") arc confirmed?

The first image has all the relevant characters for it.
>> ARTICLE
If this is two-cour, it'll probably only go up to the end of the Boros arc.
>> ARTICLE
No way. But I think the Boros arc is.
>> ARTICLE
Obviously not for this season, since the arc isn't close to finishing. Every character shown did appear before it started. 

If it's a 12 episode season, it'll go up to [](/s "Sea King").  
If it's 24 episodes, it'll cover up to the end of the [](/s "Boros arc")
>> ARTICLE
I actually don't think you need 24 eps
>> ARTICLE
In both [](/s "Sea king") and [](/s "boros") there is not enough content to fill 12 episodes.

At max each arc could last 6 episodes, and some fans would say its too much.

They could always use ONE manga as source if don't want to wait for Murata to end [](/s "garou") arc.
>> ARTICLE
Up to the end of [](/s "Sea King") is 28 chapters, which could be condensed to around 12 eps.

There's only 8 more chapters till the end of the [](/s "Boros arc"), so like you said, they could stretch it across maybe 6 episodes at most. The omakes or anime original filler could pad out the rest of the season if it's 10 or 12 episodes.

The problem with the entering into the [](/s "Garou arc") is there would be no good place to end the season with the content so far or what's to come, until it finishes in the manga. 

I want them to announce the episode count already so we'll be able to guess what to expect.
>> ARTICLE
Can they not use the original webcomic? I doubt they'd go into the [](/s "Garou") arc, but with what's out so far from ONE there's definitely enough source material.
>> ARTICLE
No, they definitely won't go into the webcomic for 2 main reasons.

1. Anime is just mainly advertisement for the manga. Having the anime go past the manga might lessen the need to buy the manga as a big appeal of manga is to read what happens next if you simply can't wait on the next seasons. 
2. The manga is deviating from the webcomic and adding a lot of new content. They can't just skip to the webcomic because they'll skip important/relevant stuff in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind that some chapters are REALLY short
>> ARTICLE
Like, 6 pages short...
>> ARTICLE
even 4 I think D:
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "I doubt it, they're all there during the Boros arc too.")
>> ARTICLE
Idr Fubuki being in the Boros arc. 
>> ARTICLE
The whole Hero Association and the top heroes are introduces in Boros arc.
>> ARTICLE
It's honestly hard to tell how far the anime will go. A lot of the chapters of OPM feel a lot longer than they are because of the frame-by-frame pages. 

What takes a minute to pan through online or in a book can boil down to 10 seconds of slow-motion action on-screen because it's basically a flip-book.

20+ minutes per episode can cover a lot. Plus, this is MADHOUSE we're talking about; I fully expect them to respect our time and make every scene count.
>> ARTICLE
Genos looks a lot more like a cowboy than I imagined... those boots
>> ARTICLE
I knew Genos was going to be a little disappointing. He looks way too shiny, detailed and cool in the manga for it be reasonable to replicate in the anime. Everyone else looks great though.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the outfit they show him wearing is going to be his main one at least. It looks like the black one will be.
>> ARTICLE
We've got to remember that in the manga he has upgraded several times. Plus we know that his appearance will be higher quality during fights. 
>> ARTICLE
The anime's website got updated with the visual and some character pics: http://onepunchman-anime.net/
Also, Murata liked the 1st episode: https://twitter.com/daisuki_net/status/638302717861982208

(It isn't surprising though)
>> ARTICLE
Wait a minute...

If the first episode is finished, then why aren't they releasing it?

Has it something to do with the timeslots?
>> ARTICLE
I guess he liked the storyboard.
>> ARTICLE

**the pre-screening of the episode 01 and 02** at Nicovideo (Region Blocked?) and at Saitama city in japan is scheduled on **the 06 September  (In 3 days)**

http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv230543404

http://ch.nicovideo.jp/onepunchman

so the episode 01 and 02 are ready
>> ARTICLE
I'm hoping someone subs the pre-screening.
>> ARTICLE
I imagine they want to have more time to work on each episode instead of finishing episodes right before it airs. Take that as a good sign, because it means more time and quality can be put into each episode.
>> ARTICLE
It's scheduled to broadcast starting in October. Because of 1) the way TV broadcasting works, 2) the expectation of one episode a week, and 3) the work required to finish an animated series, they start production well in advance of the broadcast date.


As a side note, I recommend watching Shirobako if you want to learn more about Anime production. It also helps illuminate why scheduling might slip, part of the reason they start early production.
>> ARTICLE
I know next to nothing about this series yet I'm still looking forward to it. From what I've seen, it looks like an awesome blend of action and surreal humor. I can absolutely get behind that.

He is special in that he doesn't have a normal limit. When he worked out, he wasn't being limited and his power simply grew with his effort without ... Limit. He becomes a hero because he is doing it all for the right reasons, while no one else really is. Basically he is neo.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if the whole thing with him simply doing pushups, situps, and running is supposed to be a lengthy gag that's never explained or if it will be revealed later that One Punch Man had secret powers or DNA or some other crazy shit that allowed it to be unlocked. 

Personally, I think it would be better to have a mix of the two where it's a humorous reason as to why he was able to do this, but that he really is special. Also the biggest reason I think they will have "reasoning" behind it is because of the scene earlier in the manga where he is fighting a really tough enemy in one of his original fights during training. He's close to death, can barely move and can't seem to do anything, then suddenly he just pops up, with his new simply-drawn look and states "oh I'm fine now" and wins.
>> ARTICLE
Darkshine is stated to have developed his power and baldness just by working out.
>> ARTICLE
don't know, since no one believes him.
>> ARTICLE
Shit, **I** don't believe him.

I bet he got his powers through some serum or some shit, but is too stupid to realize it's what gave him the powers.
>> ARTICLE
idk why you're getting downvoted so much. it's very well possible that he got super strong due to something other than him training.
Then again, a guy turned into a giant crab just because he ate so much crab, so I guess anything's possible in this series.
>> ARTICLE
I think the success of this show is really going to come down to the voice acting. 

It just won't work if it doesn't have super serious shonen voices. If everyone - barring Saitama - is constantly doing the standard-comedy-anime "whaaaaat!!! are you doing!!!" over the top funny reactions it will kill the show. 

The reason OPM is funny and entertaining is because it refuses to acknowledge that it's a comedy. It really commits to an ultra-serious Shonen/seinen plot and universe, and while characters are often comically over-the-top, they still aren't comedy characters; they're just ridiculously masculine Shonen characters.  

The juxtaposition of Saitama with the rest of the world and cast is what makes it funny. You have this ridiculous Fist of the North Star-style manliness-fest, with a poorly drawn dopey character somehow defeating everyone. To make any of the characters *not* stereotypically macho would ruin the dynamic. If the voice actors for anyone but Saitama try to do anything other than super-serious Shonen voices, it will mess everything up, IMO

I'd say Inio Asano's stuff comes somewhere close, albeit he mostly focuses on the stunning landscapes and the character design is fairly simple, though realistic
>> ARTICLE
oh yes I agree i forgot about Oyasumi punpun
>> ARTICLE
Also Yang Kyung-Il (artist for Shin Angyo Onshi and March Story), Nihei Tsutomu's earlier work, Yumeka Sumomo/AKA Sahara Mizu (Watashitachi no Shiawase na Jikan), Douman Seiman (Voynich Hotel) has very very stylistic art but it is amazing, and Yamazaki Mari (a rather unknown mangaka in the US but has an english published series, Thermae Romae).

Also if we consider manhwa (which we do in /r/manga) Ha Il-Kwon (Annarasumanara) and Kim Hye-Jin (Nineteen, Twenty-one) are just as good as the others. Annararsumanara is one of the most beautiful works of art in manga/manhwa. 

Murata is one of the best at anime ready art but not atypical-stylistic art.

I can't wait for this anime judging by the artwork it looks promising. The manga is hilarious but, might be more so if done right in action.
>> ARTICLE
Fingers crossed this will end with the end of the Boros arc. Would make for a good finale and I think the characters shown fit that assumption.

who the hell is the guy in the dog costume? dd i just forget that there's a character in a dog costume? 
>> ARTICLE
Watchdog-man. S-class hero so strong that when he reports that an area is quiet it's assumed he means 'since I got here nothing everything's been taken care of.'
>> ARTICLE
So when do the BDs come out for the new hentai OAV Donkey Punch-Man?
>> ARTICLE
Blonde guy looks totally like Hollow Ichigo / Zangetsu :)
>> ARTICLE
Theres a dog. I like dogs.

I wish there was a Serious Arc where they show Saitama's serious face a little more often.. Not all the time just some critical moments.

But I feel like if that happened it be near the end of the comic..
>> ARTICLE
I keep seeing adverts for this..  what the hells up with his hair and lack of facial features?  Compared to how detailed everyone else is drawn, he looks weird! 

Whats his power?
>> ARTICLE
His artstyle changes drastically at times depending on the situation. He is an oblivious but ridiculously op guy that injects the biggest aprt of the humor into the manga. The protagonist is drawn like that on purpose and often gets drawn with added realism or even less details for visual comedy.
>> ARTICLE
wow..  even less detail? lol
>> ARTICLE
Okay, maybe I should say in a more sketchy way, rather than less detail. 


These images are a bunch of different ways he is portrayed, **don't click them if you don't want to recieve a meta spoiler concerning the art** I guess :P

It's all about that number 5. [Anime episode 2 spoilers] - They just showed that scene in the anime hahahaha
>> ARTICLE
He lost his hair doing ["extensive training](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uxN898mmGIE/UJ0cv3Xl27I/AAAAAAAAEcc/aLsurQ7ySqQ/006.jpg?imgmax=3000)"

The lack of features is for humor, because everything else in the manga is like INSANELY detailed, giving a stark contrast and for the reader to take the story, and Saitama (One Punch Man) less seriously lol. But you better believe he gets detailed too (see above link).

His power? Come on man, he defeats his enemies in ONE PUNCH of course!!!

>> ARTICLE
lol .. i thought the one punch was going to be a gimmicky title like.. he doesnt really defeat enemies in one punch, just lots of little punches and the last punch is delivered after taking a beating and he summons all his strength for it. 

>> ARTICLE
That's the best part of this manga, it explores what it really means to be the ultimate hero, or "the strongest." He's depressed, feels empty inside, and doesn't know what to do with himself because nothing is a challenge. It's more of a deconstruction of shonens really.

> he doesnt really defeat enemies in one punch, just lots of little punches and the last punch is delivered after taking a beating and he summons all his strength for it.

Actually he does. All the time. With no effort. 

With larger baddies he could defeat them with one punch but likes to play around to entertain himself because he is so bored. When he is done playing he uses one punch and ends it. Also "taking a beating" is more like getting dirty he doesn't get hurt. He is basically god. 

[for example (spoiler from a recent Murata chapter)](/s "He casually knocks out Garou, the strongest villain to exist up until this point, because he did not know who he was and was blocking his way. Garou had been offing a ton of other high power heroes.") The spoiler will be post anime though. 
>> ARTICLE
Word of warning: don't expect a normal battle manga where the protagonist struggles with fighting opponents tougher than himself, trains harshly through each arc in order to power up and finally overcome the villain.

The whole point is that he trained to become a hero so he could fight monsters, but somehow overtrained and can now one-shot everything, robbing him completely of any excitement.

Half the fun is the Zoro-esque wandering about.

Handsome Kamen with blue hair.... wtf?
>> ARTICLE
Remember when people shotdown Accel World for the MC? Why is this show so hyped up? 
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't Accel World's MC like really weak or something? Not sure, haven't watched it. OPM's MC just looks retarded, in reality he's actually a Mary Sue character. Anyway, just read the manga to see why it's so hyped.

This art style looks like Bo Bo Boboo boooboo
