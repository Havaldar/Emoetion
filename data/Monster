Easily the most interesting part of that is the unmentioned characteristics they share.

As an Australian;

Snakes > Spiders.

(You know how fucking scary big spiders are? Let alone spiders *that* big. They just don't fucking die... and they're so fast... oh god the trauma.)
>> ARTICLE
I always thought it was the small ones to be more afraid of. But I guess you just can't handle all the glory Rachnera
>> ARTICLE
Small ones are easy, just get a slipper and splat (or use your hand) the big ones though... 

There was a fucking massive huntsman on my sister's mirror in her room, up pretty high so it was hard to reach, out of range of slippers (+ didnt want to damage the mirror). Bug spray only option (not outside, can't turn into makeshift flamethrower). Start spraying, following it as it runs all the way down the wall high mirror, it reaches the floor, runs straight under my sister's bed (which she was standing on top of at the time - insert screams here).

Now we're both stuck for what to do. Massive fucking spider confirmed in that part of the room, it's in advantageous territory. Can't slide under the bed, no idea where it might be - don't particularly fancy a massive spider on my face, or my neck.

Tell sister to watch carefully to make sure it doesn't escape and quickly run downstairs to grab slipper, decide that slipper doesn't provide enough effective range, instead grab two massive, heavy, pathology theory books. Run back upstairs.

Carefully scope out the underside of the bed. Checking all angles. Lift up mattress to get a better view. Underside of bed confirmed safe. Only remaining hiding spot is inside or behind one of the two bedtime tables, I choose to check the left one. Standing on top of the bed I carefully gaze at the gap between the wall and the bedside table, good god there's the fucker. Okay... what do. If I move the bedside table it'll run away again or run onto me, nope.png.

Move bed and other bedside table to the corner of the room. Quarantining the area and giving as much reaction space as possible.

Spray bugspray into gap while holding pathology book 1 in other hand, spider makes a run for it. Throw pathology book at spider, near perfect hit - seems safe... then... it starts to fucking crawl out from underneath, oh my fucking god (carpet floor). At this point, fuck everything else, it's stomping time.

And thus ends the tale of the 'strayan and the spider. I hope you enjoyed it. I got chills remembering it and wont be able to sleep tonight.

So thanks /r/anime, you now have forced me to watch yet another show that I can't talk to any of my friends or family about. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.

So Monster Musume is finally here and to many people the monster girl thing might be new and or strange. Sure neko/cat girls have been around forever and I'm sure more than a handful of you are a fan of Holo, but characters with the bottom of a snake or of a horse generally aren't seen that often outside of something like the Dungeons & Dragons Monster Manual. As someone that has been following the emergence of this "genre" for several years I think I can share some knowledge to those of you coming to it for the first time through the Monster Musume anime.  
  
To begin Monster Musume is an adaptation of the manga by Inui Takemaru, also known as Okayado. It began publication in Comic Ryu in May 2012 and continues to this day. It follows the main character, ~~Kimihito~~ "darling," who gets stuck being a host for an exchange program for Monster Girls and then ensues echii harem hijinks. However, if you are here you probably already know that and the purpose of this post is to go further back into the history of Monster Musume and monster girls as a genre/thing. 
  
Okayado didn't just start with Monster Musume and we can go back about a decade to see the roots of this series and growth of monster girls as a whole. However, given that Monster Musume is an echii series it is unsurprising that these roots are quite lewd, so I won't really be able provide visual examples. Anyways the early work included various drawings and sketches of monster girls; these early drawings would featured some prototype characters for what would evolve into Monster Musume. More specifically there were a series of short doujins called Living With Monster Girls. Each "Living With Monster Girls" featured one of eight brothers who all lived with their own monster girl girl friend. Each one had a part one and two and featured a lamia, a minotaur, a spider girl, a mermaid, a slime girl, and more. Some of those character should sound similar to the cast of Monster Musume and the brothers bear a resemblance to the MC. Outside of Living with Monster Girls there were also encyclopedia like entries with information on the characters that were similar to the work of another artist that is very important to monster girls. That artist is Kenkou Cross and the influence was the Monster Girl Encyclopedia.  
  
Okayado is one of the early monster girl artists and obviously one of the most prominent with Monster Musume being a top seller and getting an anime adaptation. However, the thing that probably really ignited the whole monster girl thing was Kenkou Cross and the Monster Girl Encyclopedia. Before sure you'd get stuff like vampires, mermaids, kitsunes, succubi, etc, but I'd say this was kind of a turning point for an explosion in different character types that typically weren't seen outside of rpg enemies and were typically much more bestial. Kenkou Cross created a series of Encyclopedic entries on monster girls all existing in world of his creation. This encyclopedia is similar to something like the previously mentioned Dungeons & Dragons Monster Manual. Each entry has details about the appearance, behavior, diet, environment, etc of a type of monster girl. Each of these entries help to detail the world of the monster girl encyclopedia... which is a long history of conflict between monster and humans. The sources of these monsters are drawn from things various mythologies from all over the world both modern and ancient. Only instead of this being a typical fantasy setting things get twisted with there being a succubus demonlord that turned the monsters into monster girls that all lust for humans and you can probably imagine the rest.  
  
Lots of artists borrowed elements from the Monster Girl Encyclopedia when creating their own monster girl art... also it pretty much gave us Monster Girl Quest, but unfortunately Okaydo didn't contribute to that project. However, like I mentioned earlier Okayado's early work did feature similar encyclopedic entry type drawings. Okayado's setting takes influence from Kenkou Cross's Monster Girl Encylopedia world, only without as strong a focus on monsters kidnapping men. Okayado like a lot of other artists focused on making worlds where the monster girls were less sex crazed succubi and more focused on the dynamic of different races/species with differing cultures having to over come various difference and relying on each other for continued existence. Similarly the actual character designs and types of "monsters" featured take a lot of influence from the Monster Girl Encylopedia. While the Monster Girl Encylopedia turned to creatures from folklore and mythology from all over the world, the biggest source of these were largely western. Looking at the cast of Monster Musume and you can also see the the prominence of creatures from western sources. Centorea is a centaur which have their origins in ancient Greece, Miia is a lamia which also have origins in ancient Greece, Papi is a harpy which yet again have origins in ancient Greece, and Rachnera is an arachne which ~~likely is inspired by driders from Dungeons & Dragons~~ is ancient Greece again. Most of the revealed cast follow this trend and even though a lot of the emerging monster girl genre is centered in Japan not a lot on the monster girls have origins with eastern myths or creatures.  
  
tl;dr  
Monster Musume is an echii harem monster girl show based on lewder doujins by Okaydo with influences from the Monster Girl Encylopedia. [One more thing](/s "Miia is best girl")

MonsterGirls as a whole is just getting broader and broader! Hope the attention brings in open minds too!

Yeah you've got stuff like Centaur no Nayami which pretty much cuts the fan service and creates a slice of life world and examines the relations between different species trying to get along that parallel a lot of real modern race relations. There is also Dr Hitomi's Infirmary which has its fair share of echii and the characters might be a bit closer to mutants than straight monster girls, but it is a setting certainly evolved from the reverse rape for MGE world.

So far, this MC has the potential to be one of the best MC in all of creation. Also anyone noticed his eyes were pale unless the situation got serious?
>> ARTICLE
He's got that all throughout the manga, to the point that people are actually counting the number of times his actual eyes show (hint: not a lot.)

Also, keep his name in mind because after this we may never hear it again.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. 34 chapters and his name is mentioned, what, once?
>> ARTICLE
Once at the very beginning. And none of the girls remember his name either. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems to have captured the manga's tone and style perfectly.

Animation greatly exceeded expectations.

The VAs are doing a great job.

This... is... *different*. ('_)

My dick is, like, *meta*-confused right now. Like "yeah, the human half is hot as hell, and the other half is *a fucking snake/horse/bird*, but the fact that its sexually confusing is kind of hot in and of itself"... I guess I'll just keep watching and see where my member takes me...

Also, I don't know whether I'm happy or sad to say that this is looking like the best ecchi show of a season where To Love Ru is also airing.

All I hoped  and dreamed for from this adaptation was the first scene done well, and boy did they deliver. No matter how the rest goes, I'm satisfied.

edit: Miia's Charl-esq "darling no ecchi"'s and "darling no hentai"'s are too die for.

MC's voice fits really well too. Glad they didn't go with Matsuoka :P

You're gonna have to wait at least 2-3 weeks, if the pacing is going to be 2 Chaps = 1 episode like this one. I can't wait to get this manga animated in the first place.

Such a thing may or may not exist; if it *does* (and I'm not saying that it does, but if it did) then it would only be released when all is said and done.

There are no light bars or censor screens. There was at least one case of a weird "jump" over where you'd expect there to be nipples, though.  It's hard to say with this episode TBH.

I'm not sure exactly why, but I kinda liked it. Lewdness worked really well, because instead of your usual high school stuff with boy falling on girl's boobs it's instead a snake woman who keeps yanking her male around and tries to have her way with him. But at the same time it is portrayed surprisingly seriously and affectionately. Plus, Miia is cute as all hells, being voiced by Amamiya Sora. I also loved the level of detail that went to the idea of living with a giant snake girl.

First things first, this was nearly SCENE FOR SCENE directly for the manga, so bonus points there. The fact everything looks so fantastic and clean makes me so happy this is finally out. The OP was so good, and I was stupid not to think the MON girls and Smith would be doing a metal ED.

Considering the manga's stance on censorship, this was actually pretty tame. I love how they didn't do any obtrusive forms like an already posted screen cap from To-Love Ru Darkness 2nd, but went with the more subtle and casual tail or hair placement. I hope they stick close to the manga like this first episode because some of the "events" that come up would make me burst into tears watching it.

In all, my most anticipated anime this season has not disappointed. Everything was near perfection (not talking about Miia here, she is perfection) and the VA are spot on. I can't wait to see more and anyone who just needs a good laugh or wants some ecchi NEEDS to watch this!

#YESH, IT'S FINALLY HERE!

Good to see how the manga art is taken into the anime (most notable is the fact that "Darling" doesn't have "regular" eyes most of the time). While I'm not the kind of person to "want a certain VA" to voice things, I'm overjoyed by the fact that they can still give me the feeling of the character (I would feel awkward if they gave Mia a serious voice and Ms. Smith a moe one, but tastes differ I guess. :P).

One thing I'm mostly an anime watcher is because of this:

Manga are able tell us a story, show us a story, experience the story in expressions and understanding of the characters. Anime are able to put things in motion, give things a "life". It gives off a nice feeling of "interaction" with its viewers through visual and auditorial contact. 

One of the reasons why I'm stating this is because the hilarity/comedic effect of the things that happen here (smacked out of the lingerie shop, the "Darling Punch of Justice!" At the hotel) is emphasized and increased due to the motion. Of course, all the embarrassing moments and stuff are also strengthened due to the added audio.   

I'm not, in any way, saying that anime is superior to manga or vice versa. Don't get me wrong. And this is also merely an opinion. :)

Anyway,

As the manga reader, I'm so happy to see how the 1st episode is loyal to the source. While some minor added details on the manga were left out (at the hotel, she states she likes the bathroom at home more), it's good to see that the anime is adapting most, if not all, of the things from the manga. Here is to hoping for Ep. 2 to be as great as this!

Edit: Also wanted to mention how lovely the OP is and giving [manga and upcoming anime spoiler](/s "Monster 'SWAT' Agency a.k.a MON") the ED was a nice touch!

It's a good day to be alive. It's a glorious day to have Internet! 
>> ARTICLE
I love how all of us are just ignoring and accepting the fact that all 6 girls used a heart shaped Spirit Ball on Darling in the OP. We don't even question it or anything
>> ARTICLE
...well. ahem. yeah.. AOTS. best girl of the season. close up shop, we're done.
>> ARTICLE
Well this episode has reignited my love for Miia. It was nice seeing everything animated in it's full glory (oh god I've become one of those guys) but more impressive were several of the sequences in the show that truly capture Miia's dereness. I have to admit, I wasn't overly fond of the casting choice but after seeing this, I am 100% on board. 

I additionally love the small details that were included in show such as Miia's chibi-esque face when she pulled Darling to bed in the begginning as well as the scene with the SWAT team broke in and condoms flew all over the place with the wall and the subsequent SWAT team member apologizing profusely to the couple in the next room over to Miia and Darling's, not to mention Smith's split-second ass-shot in that sequence. 

The exposition felt just a tiny bit clunky but the world in which this shows exists is a fascinating one, but not one without an underlying discrimination. Miia's feelings for him may be overly passionate but they're well-placed given her known experience with humans and her experience with Darling. It's able to avoid the pesky "oh your an MC, MY HERO" harem trope in exchange for the "you changed my view and life" harem trope but it was executed very sweetly as we were able see Miia's slight reserved and worried appearance just minutes after her first arrival at Darling's house. The passion and love she feels for Darling feels very much real and I applaud the anime for getting it across (even if she tends to launch Darling thourgh a window).

As a manga-reader with a short term mermory, I distinctly remember the manga so I'm kinda going into the anime with a fresh view. I look forward to a great show. What was I talking about?
>> ARTICLE
I honestly didn't know what to expect from this. But it was fucking hilarious and it made me question if I was attracted to snake girls, also that fucking punch!! 

Is this show gonna start another Great Waifu War?

That one girl in the OP though, half spider? Fucking nope to that shit.
>> ARTICLE
Wait until you see her, she has ways of convincing you. 
>> ARTICLE
Hype as fuck.

The OP and ED were amazing aswell. Cant wait til next week
>> ARTICLE
Liking this adaptation, will most likely stick with it. Smith's VA is a lot different than expected, but also better.

Main 6 does the OP, Monster Police Force does the ED. AW YISS.


>> ARTICLE
Literally got goosebumps from the happiness i felt from seeing the notification on my phone
>> ARTICLE
1.  EP1 had a lot more actual quality in terms of humor and dialogue than I ecpected; props.

2.  Is it too soon to declare Miia best girl?
>> ARTICLE
So happy that Yu Kobayashi is Ms Smith and sing the Metal ED. Ms Smith stock has gone up on my end. Brew that woman some coffee, pun not intend.
>> ARTICLE
This first episode surprised me, I had a lot of laughs and funny what-the-hell-am-I-watching moments.  For some reason the fact that it's echi and harem still doesn't push me away for some reason.  Probably how in this shows world monsters an humans live together now?  Makes me wonder what more monsters are gonna make an appearance and what quirks they are gonna have.  Plus, it helps that I was laughing with the show and not at it.  Ah screw it, I'm sold so far lol.
>> ARTICLE
So I came into this not knowing anything about it.

I also came out of it not knowing anything about it.

I also came into it.

loved the spirit bomb in the opening

This is was a fantastic episode feels odd to see something you know the source material to come to life.

Remembered finding out this manga in 2013, and now it has an anime. Tears of joy have been shed.

Seems like I'm the only one rooting for Mero. No love for [this hot mermaid](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/dailylifewithamonstergirl/images/2/2d/Meroune_Lorelei_colored.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20130722033913)?
>> ARTICLE
Now to wait for best girl. 
>> ARTICLE
I have to say, I'm *very* impressed by this so far. Now, I was always a Monmusu fan, because Miia is best girl, but even if I hadn't been I would be now. The animation so far has been pretty fluid, and has captured the spirit of the manga really well (especially the faces heh), and the background music is really fitting. I was hesitant about Miia's voice in the PV at first (best girl must have best voice), because I always thought of her as having a voice like Chitoge's, but her voice in this was wonderful!

Also, if I'm remembering right they introduced the tip-of-the-tail erogenous zone a little earlier than it's shown in the manga. Miia ending confirmed--he's already sexually violated her, earlier than in the manga, so now he definitely has to marry her right? Right?! Of course, then again [Minor spoilers](/s "We sort of already knew that when he promised Miia he'd marry her when Lala was chasing them...still salty that the next chapter wasn't the wedding")
>> ARTICLE
Actually he was using the epic one liners of several franchises like fate stay night, Madoka and others to Taunt death. The after this "I'm going to marry" or "I'm going to move to the country" are infamous on how prone characters that say them tend to die in those arcs. They are the equivalent of "just a couple of days to his retirement" in cop movies.

That is the level of badass of Kurusu, he openly taunts death XD
>> ARTICLE
I don't know about you guys, but my jaw never left the ground while I was watching this anime. I am really unsure about how to feel (about my life) now that I've seen the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Smith is best girl
>> ARTICLE
So when she rattles her tail does that mean shes getting off?
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait for the Blue Ray to be released already ;3
>> ARTICLE
There was almost no censorship, barely 5 nipple shots and most where disguised by camera angle, tail or hair placement and in only one instance steam. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched this with the biggest grim on my face and holding back tears of laughter. It is everything I could have asked for in an anime adaptation. And as for the Waifu wars. The answer is easy... All of them!
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I'm mainly watching this just to see what the hype is about, and also testing the limits of how weird the things I'm willing to put up with can get. I have a question though. What makes this different from furries? They're both fetishising creatures that are part human and part animal, so why the vast difference in attitude towards the fandoms?
>> ARTICLE
Furries are for the most part anthropomorphic beings that gained human traits. They are often depicted in western art. 

Monster girls are a part of Japanese culture of humanizing stuff, be from objects coming to life, myths if youkai or adapting western myths. Not to be confused with Gijinjkas that are anthropomorphic concepts like Windows or other stuff. 

It's a weird line but it comes mostly on the culture that creates them. Monster girls do take inspiration from myths whereas Furries tend to rely on conceptual recreation. 

The author of this drew inspiration from the monsterpedia, wich has the lore of a Monster Lord modifying the beings of the world to assimilate human beings by procreation and has a huge lore with corruption and war going on wich often ends up in a kink fest due to how big it is and how varied the monsters ended up being. The author tough differentiated from it in the world building aspect by using the unmasked world trope instead of a full blown magical Genesis. 
>> ARTICLE
Ms Smith has way too much sex appeal. Otherwise pretty good, so far.
>> ARTICLE
Now I just need to wait for all the 1/8 scale and Nendo figures to drop so I can destroy my wallet and stare at my display case for hours on end wishing my GF was a snake :(
>> ARTICLE
Ho-lee shit. We have waited YEARS for this.

SOMEONE MAKE A HYPE TRAIN JPG PLEASE
>> ARTICLE
Lol, this show highlights all that is wonderful and weird about anime! 
>> ARTICLE
Well that was a cute, yet boner-confusing first episode. I'm confusingly in.
>> ARTICLE
I broke my don't watch anime while airing rule... This is worth it. I love Miia. 
>> ARTICLE
That's a bad rule, non on biyori repeat and Ore monogatarai are both weeping for you.
>> ARTICLE
I am so glad the MC is not a stereotypical harem "loser" that can't talk to girls, gets scared from his own shadow,  somehow gets the girl by acting cold and isolated. Or is a pervert that lurks inside closets.
>> ARTICLE
welp... I just watched a thing 
>> ARTICLE
I have 0 regrets, that my interest got the better of me and I clicked on this thread.

Same. I wasn't really planning to watch until I read the thread and then I was so curious I had to watch the show. It has me interested so far.

I'm^okay^with^that

Someone explain to me why I fucking *love* this show
>> ARTICLE
Because it's a very unique premise with a creative, humorous story and an entertaining, well-developed cast? :D
>> ARTICLE
The fuck did I just watch.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly inever realy liked harem/etchy series but this episode made me being interested in the series definsly more unique tipe of series:)
>> ARTICLE
I could not imagine a more perfect voice actor for Darling.  Junji Majima just has the perfect tone for panic.
>> ARTICLE
Trouble is, this MC isn't really supposed to panic alot..although he'll certainly get enough to panic about. Rito would've had a heartattack..but then again, Rito panics all the time.
>> ARTICLE
Next waifu war is here aww yea still haven't made my choice yet but this looks like another fun ecchi show :D
>> ARTICLE
We need an anime counter on how many times we see the MP's actual eyes, just like in the manga.

As a guy who usually hates ecchi/harem, since they are just fap material, I gotta say that I actually enjoy this series. 

The manga is genuinely pretty damn hilarious most times, and they seem to have adapted this first episode quite well. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, 2 minutes in and I already have a boner, so I guess this is going to be good.
>> ARTICLE
Never struck me how "large" Miia is with that hot body of hers. 
>> ARTICLE
Looks like the most promising anime this season
>> ARTICLE
See this is how you do an ecchi show, you don't need to be Borderline Hentai *cough* *cough* **Shinmai** *cough* *cough*, you can try to do the dirty deed but rather make jokes out of it.

This might be the series that makes me somewhat like the ecchi harem genre again.
>> ARTICLE
Lamia are female only?!  What kind of bullshit is that, I want to be one!  Also how did they reproduce before their existence became public?  Those subspecies were awesome, especially Echidna.

This show is all kinds of ridiculous and I love it.  Sad to see Lamia are discriminated against, but that punch by Darling-kun was fantastic!

I'd be just fine if it were just Miia for the rest of the show, but I'm sure I'll like some of the other girls as well.

Oh, missed one thing.  She has a pussy and butthole?  That would make the entire snake portion tail and no snake has that long of a tail.
>> ARTICLE
Legend has it, there exists a massive tome called the Monster girl encyclopedia, and it holds the answers to all monster girl related questions.  
>> ARTICLE
Read a little into the discussion and found out how they reproduced.  Still, I want to be a Lamia :(
>> ARTICLE
I can't tell you how much I've been waiting for this, and words can't express how much I'm satisfied.

And: Bring on the best (spider)girl!
>> ARTICLE
I hope that they animate the shedding scene in the anime. I need it for... erm... reasons. 

Also, Miia best girl. ^^^fite ^^^me 
>> ARTICLE
tbh that was a pretty fun episode, abusive snake girl makes me laugh, what can i say
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone know if this is going to be a 12 or 24 episode season?
>> ARTICLE
I love that they kept a lot of the 'non-standard' faces that were in the manga (like the chibi ones and stuff), most get cut out in a lot of anime.
>> ARTICLE
Makes me happy so many people enjoyed this too, I hope it sells like hot cakes.  First episode was fantastic. 
>> ARTICLE
After reading the manga this so far has been exactly what I expected it to be.
>> ARTICLE
How censors is this?
>> ARTICLE
Depending on what version, they show a nipple and her "taco" to some extent.
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll I'm assuming is black bars across half the screen? 
>> ARTICLE
Watched the First episode, read quite a bit of the manga to get an intro of all the girls, decided Miia is still best girl. I mean she was introduced first, so it's clear that she's top monster already.
>> ARTICLE
People be like "OMG the anime is out" while I'm like "That's nice but when are there going to be some new chapters in the manga"

But yeah... hype for Parpy the Hapi next episode. And for Suu later.. 
>> ARTICLE
It's going to feel a tad weird fapping to this.  At first.

My goodness, this show is great.

I like the OP and ED a lot.
>> ARTICLE
What a time to be alive
>> ARTICLE
Had to wait for some alone time to watch this, there's no way I can explain this to non anime watchers. Lol

Great stuff though, was worried they would tone it down.
>> ARTICLE
I will give it the three (or six) episode rule. I'm not entirely sold on it yet, but from the hype around it, I assume it will get better. 
>> ARTICLE
Two months ago I found a copy on the manga in the toilets of our library. It was a library copy, but it was a bit of a mess and I don't think anyone would want to issue it out anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Leave it in a nearby forest for future generations.
>> ARTICLE
Woo! Didn't even know this was getting an anime until a couple of weks ago!

Really liked this, captured the manga really well imho! Loved the bits where mia just pulled darling back whenever he tried to get away!! Can't wait for the full moon episode...
>> ARTICLE
So this is going to be my second straight-up harem (well, third, but one was watched ironically), in spite of myself. They're not really my bag, but I just like monster girls. I like looking at them.

About the show itself, it seems, you know, okay. I have a personal hatred for those kinds of shows where it's like, "Hey, you know that thing you want to happen? Yeah, we're going to make it not happen and tease you about it the whole time. Hope that's cool." I personally don't find it funny to keep getting close to them fucking and then they don't. It's just annoying. Aside from that, I thought the humor was alright. Smith is 100% great.

There's probably not much more to say, even as the show progresses. All I gotta ask is: who honestly likes the bird girl? She doesn't even have hands!
>> ARTICLE
I want to tag you with "I just like monster girls. I like looking at them", but you're already tagged with ""Her face makes me uncomfortable."...
>> ARTICLE
I'm flattered. What's the character limit on tags? I think you can fit them both.
>> ARTICLE
Been reading the manga for a while now and it's a great first episode i've been looking forward to this for so long and its turned out so well to start

Though i don't remember even in the manga ever getting MC's name so i was kinda surprised when smith just said it, but maybe im just forgetting it happening.

Now we just wait for best girls cerea and rachnera
>> ARTICLE
No that's in the manga and the only time it's ever said
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, manga his name is literally mentioned TWICE. Which is why Darling is forever going to be referred to as Darling.
>> ARTICLE
Miia > Papi > Suu > Rachnera  > Mero > Cerea > Ms Smith  > Lala

but of course they are all amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Almost the same as me, but my list is:

Miia > Papi > Mero > Suu/Cerea > Rachnera > Ms Smith > Lala.

Lala may be higher but we just don't know jack about her, plus the whole kinda-sorta-but-not-really shinigami thing with her is kind of a turn off.
>> ARTICLE
Does this anime have any plot or what?
>> ARTICLE
I feel like, after watching the first episode, this series actually has some potential to tackle some race issues in a fairly unique way. I haven't read the manga at all though, so for all I know it's pretty much just gonna be boobs.
>> ARTICLE
Centaur no Nayami takes that aspect better. This one is mostly comedy with girls that have large bodies or special needs, it gets dark at some point but it still delivers comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
I've read the manga.  There was very little I didn't expect.  That OP and ED though?  Yeah.......didn't expect that.
>> ARTICLE
The OP and ED were perfect, especially with the respective groups singing um. Smith and MON kill it with metal, while Miia and the girls just make my repeat button break with how catchy the song is.
>> ARTICLE
Monster anime of the millineum.

That was weird...

1.2k upvotes, 800 comments. This must be the most hyped show of the season, and I'd never heard of its source material.

Not bad, but I feel it'd be a lot better if the dude was a tentacle monster and the rest of his (eventual?) harem was humans.
>> ARTICLE
There is one tentacle monster in the story. He/She/It/the Outergod just doesn't make it obvious.

serious question here:

can someone please give me an in-depth explanation of the appeal of monster girls? i can only sort of half see it. i would like to understand this.
>> ARTICLE
> i can only sort of half see it

The girl half? ba dum dum dushhh.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, ironically I watch monster girl stories for the vanilla romances. Because Japan really isn't into vanilla stuff, they always had to spice things up to the point of giving girls borderline mental illnesses and dysfunctional relationships. But with Monstergirls the story generally doesn't need spicing up, the girls are exotic on their own. So I can sit down and watch a girl meets boy story without too much crazy drama.
>> ARTICLE
That is actually one of the main selling points! 
>> ARTICLE
So uhh...where can I watch the uncensored version?
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if this will eventually get uncensored liked the manga. Either way, I'm still watching this. :D
>> ARTICLE
I uhh... 

Not sure what I expected but it wasn't that.
>> ARTICLE
Best I put away my boner. I've rewatched the first minute of the episode so many times already.
>> ARTICLE
Is this censored?
>> ARTICLE
Apparently it depends on where you watch it.
>> ARTICLE
barely- just the Nipples a bit, but completely without some Lightbeams across the Screen.
>> ARTICLE
How could you even consider Rachnera when Suu is in the race for best girl?

Get your priorities in order guys
>> ARTICLE
Does Ms. Smith keep blueballing later? That depends if I drop this. 
>> ARTICLE
If you want hentai let me tell you that the monster girl genre has a doujin fan base almost as large as Touhou. 

But nope most of the blue balling comes from other circumstances or the MC actually doing the right thing to keep being the host of the girls, lets not forget some girls want him for themselves thus often block each others causing hilarity to ensue.

Let's be honest here, this is one of the few MC of a harem show that actually has a working brain and decent libido while still thinking of the girls happiness first, that's one of the main reasons this Manga was received so well, it might not resolve the sexual tension with one girl but raise the real possibility among the ladies of entering a relationship and so far every bit has counted so status Quo hasn't been preserved unlike other harem works. 
>> ARTICLE
Well then, now that we've ran out of plot, I'm looking forward to seeing you all in the future threads where those who care about such things (not me, not here) complain about the utterly episodic nature of the series. 
>> ARTICLE
I usually despise harem shows. This is one of the few I somewhat enjoy.

This show is interesting to say the least. The first harem MC who has a legitimate reason to be dense is awesome. He is also blessed with the power of the Falcon Punch.
>> ARTICLE
+10 MC points for that punch to the face.
>> ARTICLE
This should be perfect as i am very close to finishing Nisekoi, can never get enough of people banging their heads against things. This will fill the void just fine!
>> ARTICLE
Well, I watched it and was thoroughly entertained. Looking forward to seeing more. A question though; are all of the monster species in this universe female-only or is it just the lamias?
>> ARTICLE
there's ntr with the centaurs but good luck finding another male character showing up in the anime. Harpies are all female I think and there's fish people like in Spongebob.
>> ARTICLE
Wow this show...actually has some substance to it. It basically has two themes: discrimination and sex. It actually creates a conflict and keeps things interesting.

The MC not being a total limp dick is a big help too.

For it's genre all quite above average points. TBH if the show didn't have tons of girls and just focused on his relationship with the snake girl it actually good be a solid show with a fleshed out plot line. I predict storytelling will start to break down as it introduces more and more characters though. Too bad.


>> ARTICLE
A harem plot where all girls want the MC. But this one is funny, at least the manga is, and there are cool story arcs but the plot doesn't get anywhere nontheless. Harem will end with MC not picking anyone.

A gold mine for monster girl fetishes everywhere
>> ARTICLE
Quite true, I guess I'm just disappointed because I see another potential hidden show underneath the harem plot.

The show nonetheless gets kudos for giving a damn about the setting. My first reaction was "Holy shit this show has lore!"
>> ARTICLE
Interesting take on a harem.  Kinda funny, I like the designs for the girls.  MC lead is the same as every harem lead but the idea of monster girls and the setting makes up for it.

Now that was... interesting. 

First learned about the Monster Girl genre via hentai, though was never really turned on by that (for obvious reasons). (I mean, how exactly do you procreate with a legless mermaid?)

Though as a romcom manga, it might just work.

This was funny as all hell
>> ARTICLE
MC is the champion 
>> ARTICLE
Man, I liked everything about this. I loved the OP, and the ED was a bit surprising, but hell, I loved that, too. Music didn't really stand out to me, which I call a good thing. I'm not much of a musician, so usually if music is standing out to me, that means it's distracting from the scene. Which is bad.

Every voice so far, even the ones shown in the preview, absolutely spot-on. Darling's was a bit odd to me at first, but I got used to it pretty fast. And it's extremely faithful to the manga so far, right down to how often we actually see the MC's eyes. 

Miia is the flawless snake baby she was meant to be, and Smith is everything I wanted her to be. The animation is gorgeous, and it's really adding to the imagery. The staff is really making use of Miia's tail as a way to show her emotion. The rattling noises when she gets angry and the wagging of the tip when she's happy. 

I also really, really liked the end card. I don't recall ever being given that information on lamia subspecies in the manga, so that was an interesting read. One thing I really like about this series is that, yes, it's primarily about sexy hijinks with ladies with animal parts, Okayado didn't eschew world-building. It's pretty well thought-out for a series whose main selling point is oppai.

Not gonna stop looking forward to this one each week. Should be interesting to see what they adapt, specifically, once each girl is introduced. 

Oh, and one last thing. [Best girl is](/s "Rachnee.")
>> ARTICLE
This is going to be a fun watch.  I read the manga recently so I wonder how there going to censor all the nude scenes but I guess they are going with the barbie doll effect.
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't help but feel that Mia's interactions with her "darling" were, how should I put it, kind of rapey? Sneaking into his bed, dragging him into the bathtub and taking off his clothes, ignoring his constant protest and in some cases clear discomfort? I had trouble laughing at some of those scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
Normally one get a Man getting a bit before lewd on a willing woman in Japanese media it's nice to see the assertive strong female on a rather willing guy, so far you can just assume it's a Lamia thing caused by a social barrier.

Too hyped, video isn't loading, will edit after ~~masturbating~~ watching...

**MONSTER EDIT**: After facing shitty anime sites for my phone, and my college classes, I finally got the chance to watch it! And it was AMAZING!!! I saw someone say that this would be censored, so I was afraid of such a predicament when the evil black and white beams would appear. But I'm pleased with the result of just not showing any nipple on the boobs.

The opening was catchy and well animated, and I loved the tidbit at the end of it. The way thu animated Everything, from the tail latching to the attacks was very powerful and clean. I especially loved **Mr. Darlingsirhusbandhoneymaster's punch** at the end. Like it was the entity of every Miia fan's hatred for those two bastards. And thankfully, there will be more ofthose punches later on! The ending was really good too. Gotta love those MON girls. :3 

This is the series that makes every ecchi harem series crumble, and I just wanna watch it crumble more and more of those series as it progresses, cause this is **ONE OF THE BEST HAREM SERIES EVER CREATED!!!!!**

Having read the manga I can safely say that I like all the girls and that there's probably something for everyone here. Finally an ecchi harem show I can get behind.
>> ARTICLE
Man what a great summer for anime
>> ARTICLE
Snakes are cool and all, but i dont know how im gonna feel about a spider-girl ..

This anime seems like its gonna be one of the best for this season 
>> ARTICLE
This was a good first ep. I have no experience with the manga so I'm just gonna assume Miia is the best girl of the series

The couple in the second half got what they deserved. So satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
I think that I read somewhere that they were going to censor this, is that true? I just want to make sure I get my full goodie bag of goodness.
>> ARTICLE
Only difference was a nipple, the rest was done classy. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't expect to like this that much but this was great. Laughed out loud quite a few times. Going to stick with this one, so much good anime this season.
>> ARTICLE
I came into this expecting to be disappointed (I'm usually not big on raunchy harem anime), but I was actually pretty entertained by this. The MC isn't dense so far, Miia is surprisingly adorable, and most of the humor was pretty spot-on. I'll stick with it.
>> ARTICLE
So lamias do not have male versions and they need human males to reproduce... How does a man stick his P into her... What does she have? Is there a sex Ed class for lamias? 
>> ARTICLE
Google snake love ball for some natgeo explanation. Now just replace female with captured human male, and males with female lamias. Unless you are reading some specific monster Pedia archives that go for Yandere like lamias that never give up the social species follow that behavior. 
>> ARTICLE
Aight so she has a hole it's just that it needs to open up when she's excited 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't this a manga spoiler? 
>> ARTICLE
You can bypass it by showing some interpretation of the monsterpedia, several lamia species and different approaches for all :3
>> ARTICLE
It was shown at the very end of the episode telling a bit about snake girls
>> ARTICLE
The common rule with monster girls involves that they must capture, seduce, or force human males into mating with them. What happens after the deed depends on the type of monster girl, either they live happy, or the male gets killed, or turned into a slave.
>> ARTICLE
Well it doesn't seem that Miia is going to turn her darling into a slave. Cannot say the same thing for if she kills him though
>> ARTICLE
there's no such thing as male lamias. all girl species
>> ARTICLE
I know I said that
>> ARTICLE
This is what Nadeko should have been like!
>> ARTICLE
It's finally here. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see the sub-species spec ops get the ed to themselves <3

>> ARTICLE
I'm still wondering how do snake-panties work, this show was so "weirlewd" !
>> ARTICLE
does he get to fuck anyone in the manga?
>> ARTICLE
Picked this manga up when they were only at the second chapter, enjoyed it a lot, and like a year or so later it really has grown. Even the manga illustrator and creator himself is incredibly surprised at the amount of international popularity and attention it's received. We were all waiting for them to introduce an anime. It was just a matter of time I suppose.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know where I can watch it uncensored
>> ARTICLE
where do i watch it uncencred?
>> ARTICLE
Im not sure what to think of this show.

* Is it hentai?  
* Is it a very very very lewd ecchi?  
* Is it a heartwarming cute story?

I read the manga chapters 1~2 but i still have no idea.

The first 3 minutes are almost hentai, **[but the end was quite cute heartwarming](http://gfycat.com/ScaredLameBanteng).**

Also, im curious: **[was this ever answered on the story?](http://i.imgur.com/7j2cJPk.png)**

I wonder if this show may be to my liking or not.
>> ARTICLE
I assume B simply because the way she wears her panties indicates her vag is in the front.
>> ARTICLE
No hentai because no actual sex or showing genitals.

That being said, they do a lot in between.
>> ARTICLE
that's why he said almost hentai. It was pretty close ; voice acted orgasm :P
>> ARTICLE
I generally dislike harem/ecchi anime since they are just there to take advantage of horny/lonely people and don't really bring anything to the table but I make an exception for this one and Sidonia since they at least put some effort into having a different type of harem instead of the boring, usual one.

I also like the fact that the MC in this one has a real excuse to not bone any of the girls even if he obviously wants to, instead of being the usual dense self-centered asshole.
>> ARTICLE
I went into the first episode thinking I would drop halfway in... it's entertaining. Goddamnit, this is gonna be my guilty pleasure of the season.

Also, I'm kind of scared for Gakkou Gurashi, both this and Ranpo Kittan have pretty good quality. I really hope Gakkou Gurashi doesn't get butchered and end up being a QUALITY show.
>> ARTICLE
Can I watch this anime series without knowing about it? Or are there other seasons before this one? 
>> ARTICLE
This is the first season so yeah it's perfectly fine.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, you can just jump right into it. This is an anime adaption of the manga. So you can start with that if you really wanted to. 
>> ARTICLE
Anime of the season, boys.
>> ARTICLE
Does this mean that sometime down the line a Katawa Shoujo anime would be possible?

^^^Pleaseletithappen
>> ARTICLE
Heck yes. It's here, at last. I got to start reading more manga/VNs/LNs/source material, I thought by reading the source material and not having the surprise element to the story, It would ruin the anime for me. Nope, if anything it's just more hype when you know what's in store. 

Get ready boys, the hype don't stop with just Miia, all the girls in this harem are "best girl" candidates. HYPE! 
>> ARTICLE
This was the funnest shit ever, and the main character is not a weak pansy but a strong and caring person thats likeable. Miia is also likeable and funny as hell also.
>> ARTICLE
I swear to god, this is the most confusing erection I have ever had.
>> ARTICLE
Darling-kun x Miia-chan

OTP
>> ARTICLE
Guys, a word of advice. If you don't know who you think best girl is yet, wait for Suu. You won't regret it.
>> ARTICLE
Entertaining cheesecake? Sure.

Worst premise ever? Definitely.
>> ARTICLE
What. The. Fuck.
>> ARTICLE
So how much "worse" will the ecchi go? So far it seems like it could be entertaining but I'm wondering if it will become just borderline porn?

High school dxd didn't really bother me in terms of ecchi but it also had a story and other things happening. Is there any actual story to this?

instead of just downvoting me can i get an actual answer, this is a genuine question that i want to know.
>> ARTICLE
The furthest the ecchi goes in the manga [Chapter 20(?) spoilers](/s "Involves suckling tits to draw illegal pollutants out of a skyscraper-sized tree-girl"), and [Chapter 33 spoilers](/s "Milking the breasts of a minotaur-girl because she got an in argument with the farmer and can't do it herself.")

Pretty sure that's as far as it actually goes.
>> ARTICLE
The plot resolves in small arcs and it's mostly episodic, however if you pay a small amount of attention you start to notice issues that resurfaced due to a poorly planned interspecies law, that theme has so far being consistent in the Manga. If you add the fish out of the water syndrome that most girls struggle with not only for coming from different backgrounds but for having bodies that aren't entirely functional to every day life become a recurrent theme despite being played by the laughs. 

If you want to see political correctness gone wrong and cold war tension between species I would recommend centaur no nayami wich is a hard centered xenofiction work centered around world building that gets cute as fuck sometimes. 
>> ARTICLE
so there are reasons to watch this other than pretty much just the fanservice?
>> ARTICLE
Yes, the comedy and nice commentary on society from time to time. 
>> ARTICLE
I am surprised how incredible good it was. This will be the Anime of the year. 
>> ARTICLE
Fucking great first episode. I'm hyped! 
>> ARTICLE
I can not begin to describe how much I have been looking forward to this!!

this was shit, if it is to make things like this then just do it hentai

I vote [Smith-san](http://i.imgur.com/78UwNdd.png) for best (non-monster) girl

[She's even got MC named as Darling on her phone](http://i.imgur.com/X9XTmhd.png)
>> ARTICLE
We haven't had any real competition though in the non-monster girl department.

^^She ^^is ^^great ^^though ^^of ^^course, ^^just ^^saying ^^it's ^^not ^^saying ^^much.
>> ARTICLE
Does she ever actually get any competition...?
>> ARTICLE
Huh. They switched the katakana and hiragana. Should be .
>> ARTICLE
smith is basically all but confirmed a vampire. He added everything else from the poll but not vampire which came in #1/2 or some shit. Insert all the other /a/ theories about it too.

>> ARTICLE
related page from the manga - http://imgur.com/P2mKTqo
>> ARTICLE
That's kind of funny how she spelled Darling-kun on her phone, because Darling should've been in katakana (as a foreign word) while -kun should've been hiragana, but they're switched. Anyone know if that's a thing people do?

And damn, Smith always looked good in the manga, but now she's like DAMN!
>> ARTICLE
Agent Smith is best girl.
>> ARTICLE
Totally my reaction to her appearances this episode:

[](#urbansmile "HELL YES")
>> ARTICLE
Hell I would vote her for best monster girl too after this episode. 
>> ARTICLE
That's okay, as long as we still all agree Miia best monster girl
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I mean you're wrong but that's okay.

Rachnee master race.
>> ARTICLE
Rachnee best girl for now but Suu is secret top-tier. Can't wait till she drops the clueless act for good and we get to see her true power.
>> ARTICLE
One of the many reasons I love Monster Musume, even the girls outside the harem are competing for best girl.  
  
Let the waifu wars commence.
>> ARTICLE
I find her voice to be sexy. She's also Sarutobi in Gintama. I'd recognize her anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
After Seitokai Yakuindomo i just cant miss her no matter what anime i hear her in, i love her voice!
>> ARTICLE
It's because even smith doesn't remember his name.
>> ARTICLE
Mr. Darling?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think any1 knows his name, especially the readers or watchers. His name has been said only once during the whole series in manga and both anime. 
>> ARTICLE
So his name is almost as elusive as Kyon's.
>> ARTICLE
actually twice according to the wiki.
>> ARTICLE

I hope they fix that,unlikely that it'll happen but I still hope so.
>> ARTICLE
You're doing God's work son.
>> ARTICLE
She refers to him as "aruji", so it may both mean Master and Husband, depending on kanji.


>> ARTICLE
With breasts that big, what is the Centaur's thing going to be? Sorry, haven't read for a while
>> ARTICLE
OH MY GOD YES!
>> ARTICLE
I'm so upset about that! All the girls call him something different ;3; 
>> ARTICLE
goshujin in a literal sense means "master" or "owner"

hence the maids calling people goshujin-sama in anime.

it was also a phrase that some wives used to call their husbands as well. (kinda archaic now, but some old-fashioned couples still do. Shows you the social position of women back in the day)
>> ARTICLE
That would explain the fan translation's choice of the word "husband" instead
>> ARTICLE
She calls him (Goshujin) so it's not like the translation is wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
[](#brofist)

Next week is the full moon episode, hype train!!
>> ARTICLE
[Fuck yeah](#brofist)
>> ARTICLE
Well, she's been calling him master so far. I never saw the raws of the manga, so hubby could be a translation thing.
>> ARTICLE
[](#deranosebleed)

I've seen her call him either hubby or Boss.
>> ARTICLE
I never saw her call him boss o.0 maybe I wasn't paying attention when I read those parts.

Some harem-MCs get their harem out of thin air. Some fight in order to get them them. Some are the nicest people ever. A few are even able to sweat talk their way to haremhood.

But Darling/Master/Kimihito (Try to remember that name. Or dont; they probably won't mention it ever again.) gets his harem because his body is made of steel.

Or something like this. He has to be half-oger. Ms. Smith has to be more cunning than she leads on - she knew he could take the abuse of ~~a~~ ~~2~~ 3 monster girls.

I'm not sure if I should be envious of this harem. I like boobs but I also like not being in pain.  
(Who am i kidding - I would take the pain for a single monster girl. They are awesome.)
>> ARTICLE
i've been wondering what was up with the super-punch in episode 1. that isn't human right?

That punch was definitely human. It was just a fucking rage punch.

Yes, I am also able to watch the intro with [Should their names be spoiler tagged? Let's be safe here.] (/s "Suu, Mero and Rachnera") in it. And I also read the manga.

I cannot describe why, but I really, really like this show. I'm not that fan of harems and I'm certainly not a fan of ecchi. But for some reason I really do enjoy this show! Maybe it's protagonist, who is kinda default, but at the same time total badass. Maybe it's because it really does dedicate a lot of time into the idea of actually living with monster girls (Papi not being able to fly because her wings got wet! Like, wow, I wasn't expecting that). Maybe because monster girls themselves are super fun. Maybe because it's just [really freaking funny](http://i.imgur.com/NILgK8k.jpg)! I don't know. But I'm gonna keep watching.

>> ARTICLE
What makes this anime/manga so incredible is the amount of details the writer of the manga put into the world.  
  
Seriously, in the newer chapters he's mostly been busy doing *even more* world building.  
  
How do monstergirls intergrate into human society? How do the humans adapt the the monstergirls? What quirks do which monstergirls go through? [Even some awkward stuff like ](/s "Miia actually sheds her skin, papi lays an egg and how the fuck does a centaur swim?")  
  
It's fun to read and imagine how well this would go in a modern society where we haven't even fully accepted homosexuality/different skincolours yet.
>> ARTICLE
It's the monster girls, the beloved, over-loving, adorable monster girls.
>> ARTICLE
The thing that makes the MC likeable is because he's not oblivious. But at the same time he is an upstanding and responsible guy who, above all else, wants the girls to be happy *without breaking the law*. He knows he's walking a fine line between keeping them happy, breaking the law, and straight up surviving, which makes the situations they get into hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. And there's a justifiable reason for why he cannot have sex with them. It is literally illegal. 
>> ARTICLE
It is such a small, but smart plot device that provides an answer from the start to everyone's biggest frustration in many harem shows: "they are literally throwing themselves at you MC... Why...don't... you...JUST DO IT?"

 *flex*

Oh wow, Papi was a lot cuter in the anime than I remember her being in the manga. And the voices for Centorea and Papi were really good to! 

So this covered chapters 3+4. 

Here are a few comparisons (since it has always been cool to see when other people do this)

[Frozen Anime](http://imgur.com/lhAQM62,vQH7TYh) / [Manga](http://imgur.com/lhAQM62,vQH7TYh#1)

I find it interesting comparing the changes in that were made.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, still living up to my expectations I see MonMusu. Another 2 chapters done beautifully, while still being slightly tv friendly. Glad they didn't remove the Popsicle scene from Papi's intro. Cerea's intro was very low key compared to the manga though, less boob flying to be honest.

All in all this still is AOTY material for me being such a long fan. And the next episode I GUARANTEE will be great, although probably censored to hell. [Let's just say](/s "you will pray for more full moons after it is all over")

Animated Papi is a lot cuter than I thought she would be.

I'm really liking how well this is doing as an adaptation. On one hand, it would've been interesting to see some of these scenes reimagined, but as it stands they're doing pretty much shot-by-shot copies of the manga which is respectable in and of itself. Better yet, they're taking a hentai-in-all-but-name manga and adapting it without the use of dackscreen, convenient fog, or unnatural beams of light (lookin' at you, Prison School) while still making it serviceable. That kind of censorship takes creativity, and I can respect that.
>> ARTICLE
Is... Is this show some kind of Vietnamese sexual torture program? It couldn't be more amusing and fun, but *I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT WEIRD SHIT AFTERWARDS.* (;) 

Okay, so, unless you are *the most hardcore* of tits-men, Miia and Centorea should... *probably* be out of the question. You can't fuck snakes (I would know), and to a human, horse-vagina must be the loosest, most *humbling* thing on the planet. Now with *Papi*, we're getting somewhere. *Human lady-parts are intact.* BUT. The bird-brain thing; She would probably forget the two of you were doing it 3 minutes in, ^but ^I ^dunno, ^^time-limits ^^turn ^^^some ^^^people ^^^on.

A-Anyway, uh... C-Centorea best girl... I think...
>> ARTICLE
Mia her 'lady parts' as you put it, are intact as well.  
The Snake part starts right under it.  

the first episode already implied this with the toilet question and her panties.  
Her tail is frankly entirely useless, it doesn't houses any important organs, it just replaces her leggs.  
Even her digestion system is just in her human part, and her anus is located at her human butt, not near the end of the tail like with a snake.
>> ARTICLE
So uh, funny story & some spoilers [spoiler](/s "a lot of the female monster species are essentially rape-trains ran on the men they 'choose' as they are *exclusively* female races. Harpies are an all female species and tend to bring men back to their homes and share them. Lamia's do this to a much greater extent, to the point that Miia was sent out exclusively to get a man to bring back to the village... she was sent off with signs and banners and everything. Centaurs have males, but the females consider them to be stupid brutes, their race uses male teasers/fluffers for the females which often results in NTR scenario's both ways, some females prefer their teasers others get teased and then end up with the brute. Arachne are a largely female only species as well... along with a lot of other monster girls")

Haha darling is such a handy man, he is just great at doing house works. I like how they chose Majima to voice the main character, it suits him well (fyi he also voiced Ryuuji in Toradora and Ayumu in Kore wa Zombie, who are also good at doing chores). [This video from Digibro is extremely relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocg62MF9A84)

Although I already read the manga but man, the anime is even funnier to watch. This episode is great with the appearances of 2 more characters but I feel like they rushed it a bit (2 main char in only an episode). I just hope they slow down a bit and can't wait to see the mermaid appears.

Just watched it today, don't really agree on that thought the ending was fantastically done. It's possible that it's rushed compared to the manga (no idea) but as a standalone it was done very well.

This show is filled with massive reasons.

This episode we get a half-chicken and a half-horse harem member, complete with a crotch fall, questionable-looking Popsicle eating, and boob groping galore....wtf am I watching and how do they make the laughter contagious enough to come back before the next episode??!?!?!?   'Tis a mystery, one that requires more clue gathering.....

On serious note, rarely do I watch lewd harems, this show is obviously doing something right, I just can't put my finger on it...?
>> ARTICLE
"Are you going to incest Papi now?" with an innocent expression

Lol ah yes, cant forget about another staple in anime  the incest jokes either

Loli-bird and Oppai-horse make a great addition to Tsun-snake.

I really like the op and ed of this. And does anyone know when slime girl will join the harem?
>> ARTICLE
I was scared that this anime adaptation wouldn't live up to my expectations.

It's really nice when a show exceeds expectations by a long shot. This is my favorite show of the season.

And the censoring is done amazingly well. No beams of light/caution tape/ridiculous steam.

I thought i would be against Monster-Girls >.> I am totally wrong...

Wasn't Papi supposed to call the MC "husband"? Why is she calling him master? That's Centorea's schtick. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I don't know why they changed it, either. Maybe it's just the translators?
>> ARTICLE
Nope. She used "goshujin" that as far as I know means customer or master (goshujin-sama).

So no, there wasn't a translation problem. Or am I a bird brain and Papi calls him husband later in the story not off the bat, right when she moves in
>> ARTICLE
Checking the manga. It doesn't look like Papi refers to him by anything until she's in the house and Mrs. Smith tells her that MC-kun is going to be to her host family from now on, and then she immediately starts to referring to him as 'Husband'.
>> ARTICLE
In the official English Manga she calls him Boss. Lotsa different translations here. 
>> ARTICLE
Yo guys. I guess nobody will see this, but if you are ever interested in hearing more of the guy who made the ending, I'll give you some info! 

His name's yuyoyuppe. He also mixes under the name DJ Tekina something and he also made the ending for Yuri Kuma Arashi. Yup, the dude's pretty versatile.

He started as a Vocaloid music producer and pretty much* started the whole Vocaloud trend. His most popular songs include songs such as Palette, Lost Story, Leia or Hope. He also made several indie albums under his doujin circle's name : Draw the Emotional, often using Touhou songs and rearranging them. He even made a [rearrange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPpSGhA5Ghg) of the popular Bad Apple that's really good. 

If you want more from yuyoyuppe, please check out his [official Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DrawtheEmotional/videos) and maybe head over /r/Vocaloid for even more recommendations. You can also just ask me for more recommendations, I'll be glad to help you! 

In any case. On to the episode in itself. 

Well holy fuck... MonMusu might be turning me into a Monster Girl lover. I really didn't expect to get so much into it when I first started and yet, here I am... This shit is actually pretty clever and having a lore that clearly states those Monster Girls might have a thing for the D helps a lot. 

Cerea kind of has a good reason to stay with MC-kun and I really liked that. Papi is just the token loli, but I guess she's funny enough to oversee that she just got there because we needed another member in the harem. 

I also like those little insignificant details like Cerea not beating the shit out of MC-kun after he apologized like many haremette would do in another harem. I even cheered a bit when he dodge that kick from Cerea. Shit hurts like a motherfucking truck, good on him. 

While it's not gonna a 11/10 with rice masterpiece deconstruction of the harem genre, MonMusu is going to be a really enjoyable anime to watch this summer at least. 

Edit : I a word.

Huh? [You just posted the best girl!](http://i.imgur.com/AhIdEz0.gif)

I don't know what I was expecting, but yeah. I still love everything about this.

Every voice, all the music, I love the sound effects for Miia's slithering and Cerea's clippity-clops, all the characters and how they're being presented, the OP and ED - I'm a habitual skipper, but I listen to both on these. I particularly like when I can hear the characters singing. 

But yeah, this anime is everything I wanted it to be and more. Full moon hype for next week. Even the censoring is surprisingly tasteful. Disappointing, to be sure, but at least it's not as blatant and giant white or black patches. Creative placement of objects and characters and simple framing are much preferred.

Of course, no censoring at all would be best. (   )

On one hand this show is great, on the other hand it feels really awkward to acknowledge that you've viewed this and know the source material.

This has to be the best anime of this season so far.

This show's great, all the girls are really fun to watch and we haven't even seen all of them yet.

This show is just glorious. :D

Funny and disturbingly hot, all this show needs is the feels, (which I'm sure are coming) then this will be my AOTY. 

I really like the sense of weight to Mia and Cerea, (why do I feel like I should whisper that?) they definitely move like the size they are, it's great animation.

Miias full length is said to be 8 meters, but her weight is a formally a secret. But we can assume we are talking about a body weighing around 350-450 kg

Oh god, I just can't get over how sexy Ms. Smith's voice turned out. Now I can't read the manga without that silken smooth voice playing in my head.

Also, I can't help but notice that they've given quite some eye candy shots for Ms. Smith alone.

I'm confused at you guys that are making an early pick of Centorea for your waifu-for-this-show. Unlike the other girls, she doesn't have conveniently placed genitals. They are in fact all horse. I guess it's not unlikely that would be someone's fetish though, so I guess more power to you.

Impossible things to accomplish = choosing best girl in Monster Musume 
>> ARTICLE
The answer is all of them
>> ARTICLE
Slightly dissappointed how Papi didn't refer to him as in the manga as that's another difference between the 3 girls.

While Cerea uses Master and Miia using Darling, Papi in the manga calls [him](/s "Husband") rather than "master" as well. It's the small things. Q_Q (manga spoil tagged it out of safety's fuckin' sake)

Also to note to those who don't read the manga and possible reading subs, there is a wordplay with Papi and "deport" in the manga. While it was translated whether they were gonna "incest" her (doesn't make any sense at all but w/e) in the anime, the manga translation kept the wordplay by using the word "deflower". 

Again, this is just small nitpicking detail crap, but the 1st one really feels a bit wrong imo. The 2nd isn't really necessary but it's still something with more value than what they used in the anime.

/nitpicky rant

ANYWAY...I'm happy how they did manage to maintain the source's adaptation. Just some minor details I picked out from it.

^^^^Slightly ^^^^salty ^^^^on ^^^^the ^^^^fact ^^^^how ^^^^most ^^^^manga ^^^^ecchi ^^^^moments ^^^^were ^^^^cropped/cut ^^^^from ^^^^screen ^^^^()
>> ARTICLE
Minor nitpick to the nitpick, she technically calls him Boss. At least that's the official term, the fan translations have it as husband.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually thinking that the manga scanlators took the liberty and rephrased those word plays so that they could work in English.
 
I'm by no means a Japanese speaker, but my guess would be that the words for "deport" and "incest" sound more similar in Japanese. So, in essence, Crunchyroll translated it fine, but just more word by word and with less ... finesse ... when it comes to Japanese word plays. 

Also, if I remember correctly, Papi refers to him as "goshujin" which would be "master" if translated into English. Probably also a liberty taken by the scanlation team.
>> ARTICLE
While it was just minor (personal) nitpicking (and having next to zero proper knowledge regarding the Japanese language), I did laugh less at the incest -> deport rather than deflower -> deport.

Doesn't make me stop enjoying the fact how this show is animated and really makes things alive lol. (Cuz fuck minor details lol)

Something sort of irks me about the way Smith's VA is speaking, it sometimes sounds like she's exhaling every second word or something.

Regardless, I'm really liking how this is going, it's so much better than I thought it would be, don't know if the lack of actual nudity bother me though, admittedly I don't know if it should bother me, but with or without the comedy is superb and the everything that made each character awesome is present in abundance, and it's also great to find out new things about myself.. Yeah.. I'm not a weirdo..

1:08 Judging soely on body type i do believe Best Girl has arrived

Does anyone have some translations for the opening? Please. Google gave me no hope.
>> ARTICLE
Well this week's episode was slightly less inappropriate to watch on the subway. There were also less people, so it was much easier to shamefully hide in a corner.
>> ARTICLE
It surprised me that even if they toned down the amount of ecchi in this episode, but I am not even mad. The humor is perfect, chuckling like every 10th second. The characters are excellent written and interesting with flaws and strengths. The setting are superb with little fun details hiding in the background. I just want to hug Centoria.

Wow so much Agent Smith fanservice.  Excellent.

You know, I was just thinking... Would a "cyborg" monster girl be a thing? Or has that already been done? I haven't picked up the manga yet beyond Rachnee's chapter debute because I wanted to let the mangaka pump out more chapters before I read them.

Oh God what am I doing with my life.  
So I'm actually enjoying this show, even if I'll probably never be able to reconcile the idea of a monster-girl fetish in my life.  
Anyway, here's my best girl hierarchy for now. Miia = Cerea > Smith > Papi.  
Girls who are overly stupid don't really do much for me. Smith, despite being a filthy human and not a glorious animal girl like the rest ^^^/s is still actually really great, but not as entertaining as the ever-devoted Miia. Cerea also got a pretty great introduction, being essentially oppai Saber with a horsebutt. 
>> ARTICLE
Was there ever a point in history when there were this many ashamed boners in such a short period of time?
>> ARTICLE
there go my first ..... to this anime.
>> ARTICLE
I love how they are working around the uber ecchi of the manga with the anime. Instead of light beams and the 'fog of war' we get interesting camera angles that block the shot instead. 

It hasn't detracted from the plot... or the PLOT imo. I just wonder how they are going to do some of the future chapters.... 
>> ARTICLE
This was made to be a hentai show. xD
>> ARTICLE
Funny you should say that. The original one-shot mangas were actually hentai. Then the mangaka decided to tone it down a notch, as you can tell from the anime it's only a single notch, and turn it into a ecchi manga series.
>> ARTICLE
Read like 3 chapters of this manga a while ago, and felt oddly curious as I watched. But in the end I felt like I needed a shower to get the weirdness off of me. I simply can't get into this show, too weird even for my tastes. If you love this show then all the more power to you, I just can't do it.

We're *almost* there! The correct two are Suu and Rachnera.

you must be a leg man then right? on a side note.. what's your opinion on best MON? and Lala for that matter

As far as MON goes they all are pretty much tied IMO, their pros and cons equal out and I can't really choose. Lala has potential to be top tier best girl material, but she's still pretty new so we have to wait and see.

I see you also have good taste. Suu and Rachnee-chan are too best for some of these silly bakas to comprehend.

And by "help" you mean provide more monster girls, right?   
First start reading the manga, maybe pick up 12 Beasts, Centaur No Nayami, & Dr. Hitomi's Infirmary while you are at it.  
Then go play Monster Girl Quest.  
After that construct a shrine to Dargoth and pray that he finishes his translation of Monster Girl Quest Paradox and Sei Monmusu Gakuen.

So how does one go about playing this Monster Girl Quest?  You know, for science and with rice purposes.

[I actually like the main character's "normal face". You don't see it too often.](http://imgur.com/7eQi3kO)
>> ARTICLE
It's a running gag in the manga as well. Unless he is saying something profound, he always has a reaction face.
>> ARTICLE
It's kind of the same deal with [Kohina](http://i.imgur.com/hJAJ7ss.jpg) from [Gugure Kokkuri-san](http://i.imgur.com/2O4EayU.jpg). 
>> ARTICLE
seriously, I loved the normal kohina so much, though maybe it's because it's rare that I think it's so adorable
>> ARTICLE
You only see it when he says or does something really important.
>> ARTICLE
I like this (but I also liked it in the manga).

We all can clearly see that his life is not easy - so most of the time he is more in an "endurance" mode. (You know, in order to survive all the stuff thrown at him.)  
But when he gets serious he snaps back and shows his normal face.

So instead of having a character that brushes back his hair or throws away his weighted training clothes to get into "serious mode" we have a character that just usually tones it down a level or two.  
I think it fits his at times borderline stoic character.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, and he's genuinely thoughtful.

It is such a big distinction from "nice." Most nice harem protagonists just help with what they need to, and are otherwise dumber than a box of rocks. This guy knows everything about all the girls, and is genuinely interested in taking care of their special needs.

It's like he's already acting as a husband to each of them.
>> ARTICLE
It's like we've finally discovered a real person
>> ARTICLE
And in this episode MC-kun got:

- kicked in the face by the equivalent of a horse
- hit by three tranquilizers each of which was strong enough to take out a centaur or a lamia
- smashed by a door that took out an enraged and horny harpy
- pummeled by three monster girls

All in a single day (and those are only the major injuries). His physical endurance is god-like...  
I think the girls would be in more danger than him should they ever have sex. All three of them will panting for him to stop before his stamina even drops noticably...

There's actually an in-universe explanation for that. Not sure if it'll show up in this season, though.

Speaking of milk breed, I wonder if they'll ever show a minatauros girl in one of the endings
>> ARTICLE
I'm just hoping they don't skip any chapters or scenes.
>> ARTICLE
From the preview for the next episode, it seems they'll be skipping the shedding scenes for an episode all about Suu.
>> ARTICLE
But with only 12 episodes they won't make it that far in the show, I think they are going to end with Lala.

>> ARTICLE
Oh pretty please let them end it with [spoiler](/s "his promise that he'd marry Miia"). I don't even care that it's just there as a death flag to introduce Lala, I want it anyway. 
>> ARTICLE
It'll probably end with Lala being revealed to be a "delusional 8th grader"
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly how I think they'll end it.

I'd rather they slow it down and show more of the sol-side too besides all the ecchi stuff

whos the giant M.O.N girl with the horn and what species is she? i like tall girls (   )
>> ARTICLE
Tionishia and she's a Ogre/Oni depending on how you translate it.
>> ARTICLE
She's an ogre; [oni generally have two horns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni) and [there was one introduced in Chapter 34 as well](http://i.imgur.com/eIMk8gR.png)
>> ARTICLE
Actually usually when two onis are portrayed, one would get two horns and the other would get one. And to be even more traditional, one would have red skin while the other have blue skin. It's just a cultural thing. (Hint: Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley)

Oni is basically the Japanese equivalent of an evil dragon, living in a lair waiting to be killed by a hero, except they are humanoid and thus get translated into ogres.
>> ARTICLE
that would be Tionishia "Tio", the ogre

These subspecies breakdowns are one of my favorite things about this adaptation.

Monmusu isn't just an excuse to slap tits onto different animals. Okayado put a lot of thought into how the different species function, and how they exist in our world. Some of it's truly fascinating.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the full moon episode. This chapter was the one that made me realize I wanted to fuck a lamina.


>> ARTICLE
And a centaur and a harpy
>> ARTICLE
Having sex with a centaur is literally just having sex with a horse.
>> ARTICLE
Not at all. As opposed to a mere horse, a centaur would react like a human to the stimulation, making the intercourse much more enjoyable for both parties.  
Also, there is a lot more that can be done to a female upper body than to a horse head.
>> ARTICLE
The question is, is Cerea JRHNBR? You gotta have that JRHNBR, dog.
>> ARTICLE
It wouldn't matter to me

Son of a fuck I didn't want to remember that video.

Oh god please don't remind me of that.

> Also, there is a lot more that can be done to a female upper body than to a horse head.

But... not at the same time as the lower body, unless you're Reed Richards or some shit.
>> ARTICLE
That's true
>> ARTICLE
> Unless you are a centaur too

FYP
>> ARTICLE
Manga [spoiler](/s "not necessarily, it has been stated explicitly that humans and centaurs can have sex and reproduce")

Not that you can really spoil this show
>> ARTICLE
I meant it more like a centaur can handle both the upper and the lower body simultaneously, while Darling-kun would have problems with that.

its going to be a shame, but I don't think we will make it to chapter 18. But other possible chapters to close on would be 24, 26, or 30 if we get lucky.

And if its a two season, maaaan are we going to have some fun.

I googled, its apparently exactly the same as humen but the vagina is just higher up. Probably a stool or something to get you on the same level and you need to get the horse in heat and keep the mare from moving away when you fuck.

Now you are like us and wait every week for the next dose that we are all strung out on. And pray the manga hiatus ends soon so we can see the next part of [the](/s "Mero is an actual princess") story

Why is it on hiatus? ;_;

Last I knew it was only serialized in a monthly thing. But someone else said the latest chapter was released recently so it could be off now.
>> ARTICLE
I hope so. I would love for this to get popular enough for a second season.
>> ARTICLE
It definitely is. Each volume has been high if not number 1 on the New York Times sales list so popularity and funding is not much of an issue.
>> ARTICLE
Oh thank god, how about material? Is there enough or nearly enough?
>> ARTICLE
If the manga is out with a new chapter that will be 35. At 2 chapters an episode it's almost enough for another 6 if they keep up the trend so far. But we still got time for more chapters
>> ARTICLE
Yay. There's hope
>> ARTICLE
With the following (read: uproar) unless they go anime only ending and actually go through with a marriage instead of ending with chapters 23 & 24, I highly suspect a season 2 is gonna come. Hell, Akagami no Shirayukihime is only 3 episodes in and it already has a second season in the works for next year. If a dark horse hit can do it MonMusu can definitely do it too. Plus BD sales will be pretty damn big too.

It's not fair. I wanted to hate this show. I wanted to so bad. I had this mind set that this show was the reason why bad anime stereotypes exist to those that don't understand the medium. I remember when this show got announced I got disgusted and talked to some friends who are kind of in to anime about why I think this is a horrible show idea, and no one in their right mind could find entertainment from this pure shit.

And here I am three episodes in, extremely flustered and wanting so much more. I don't even have a preferred "best girl" yet because they all have been pretty entertaining. I don't understand it, but I think I'm in love.

Another perfect recreation of 2 chapters. Of course cause they had to censor it, the Full Moon wasn't in all its glory but they did a fantastic job with what they had. They captured Cerea's embarrassed face wonderfully and even the part where best girl schools the newcomers on how the house is gonna be run. Can't wait for the BD so we can see the true wonder of the Full Moon. And with Suu coming next episode it only gets ecchi-er from here guys.

Were those descriptive endcards present in the manga as well? I don't recall if they were, for I haven't read them yet. Though I must say, they add some depth to the show. I hope they are not restricted to the species of the main cast.
>> ARTICLE
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3e35m0/spoilers_monster_musume_no_iru_nichijou_episode_3/ctb2qcy

Supposedly they're better than what the manga has. Doesn't the main cast only go to ~6 monster girls? I'm guessing they'll have to branch out eventually.
>> ARTICLE
They probably draw from some of Okayado's previous stuff, though.  He's done a shit ton of Monster Girl related stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Well, only 6 live with him, with a 7th dropping by frequently. There are a lot more than that though. The police squad show up often, and pretty much every other new chapter introduces characters for just that short story.
>> ARTICLE
Ohhhh myyy....Miia is definitely a seductress (   )(   )
>> ARTICLE
I think putting these girls in a "Best Girl" poll similar to the ongoing poll here will be a sin.

All of them are best girls.

But my personal favorite is Suu.
>> ARTICLE
Some interesting things to notice when watching this episode:

Cerea had to expose her rear-end to Darling-kun in order to kick him in the bath at the beginning of the episode.  In other words, Darling-Kun has likely seen *all* of her, but doesn't remember it thanks to severe head trauma.

Seeing Ms. Smith naked in the bath is strangely erotic.  Perhaps, because of the constant assault of half naked monster girl seductresses, seeing a normal human naked becomes the fetish.  A strange reversal.

Slowly but surely, we advance towards Darling-kun's favorite girl (he's a leg man).

Edit:  Shit, I forgot to mention how Papi's VA is fucking nailing this performance.  I'd honestly say she is giving the best performance out of the VA's so far.

If you like comedy,  likeable characters such an MC with an actually functional brain and balls that actually deserves the love of the girls plus an harem of potential best girls(not kidding, all are good) you should try it. 

Also the censorship is near non existent and handled classy... So you might not want to watch this accompanied by others.

I like this show as much as everyone else, but I think that sooner or later, the whole scenario where all the girls fight, and the MC is stuck in the middle, will get old. I mean, we had two of those scenes this episode.

Another fun episode, I was a little worried at the beginning because I thought all the arguing and sex jokes would get old, but I was wrong. That animation change during the fight in the park was awesome and Horse woman was pretty cool and cute this episode. Darling-kun said some odd things this episode he said all the law breaking and fighting the girls are doing is bad, but he said they shouldn't hold back. It's good to be yourself, but they hurt him a lot even without the full moon. Later Darling-kun said he'd be serious about dating each of them and then decide who to marry. That's an oddly mature thing for a harem protagonist to do even if it's wrong for Smith-san to force him into marriage so soon or if it's wrong for Darling-kun to feel that he needs to marry one of them. Marriage this soon into the series isn't going to happen, Dragon quest waifu is next episode and we saw more girls in the intro. Final thoughts, yay jojo reference, yay Smith-san in the bath, and yay Darling-kun is cool.

Fantastic post.

Banjo has some STRONG competition here.

Let's see next episode. I think both Miia and Rachne will have equal screen time. But who will have the most number of screenshots.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, so glad someone did this. Not quite on Banjo's level as far as file name and formatting, but nonetheless, very good to see sufficient appreciation for our lovable arachnid. Keep up the good work!
>> ARTICLE
Eh, it could have been worse. 

I like to make commentary and there's just too damn many to name without there being a ton of duplicates.

At least I grouped them together. Originally it was all in one mass or each on their own line.

Man, Banjo must really work hard at this stuff, huh? All the same, keep it up. I want to see this again next week, you hear?

You're god damn right. You can almost hear the skittering as the brood grows in numbers, and it's my duty to carry her light into the darkness of the shitter loser worst girl masses.

Why isnt this on top? Also you should compete againt's the guy who post miia's screenshot for every episode, we can't let them win the best girl war!

Because the casuals of /r/anime can't comprehend the glory of Rachnee.

And don't worry, now that best girl has made her debut I plan on doing this every episode.

Too bad she doesn't get that much screentime :c
>> ARTICLE
> Too bad she doesn't get that much screentime :c

It's only a matter of time brother! (I hope, don't crush my dreams I don't read the manga.)
>> ARTICLE
She's still around plenty, but due to the fact that she's fucking huge means she's limited in where she can go. Miia is long but can wrap up nicely, Cerea can run wherever she needs to. Rachnee is enormous and not that fast and hates people so she tends to stay home a lot.

But the things she does at home make it all the worthwhile.

Did you just screen grab the entire episode?

Not that I'm complaining...

Well the episode was like 90% Zombina and Rachnee, so basically yeah.

That's totally okay, man. I know we give each other guff over it, but it really is okay to think whoever you like is Best Girl.

I'm pretty sure everyone in this thread has to retake their English classes or something cause y'all keep misspelling Papi.

With Manako's personality and cute body (and LEGS), she's definitely top tier for me.

>> ARTICLE
M OOOO N
>> ARTICLE
I'll try extracting the acapella out of the second song using the instrumental (yay for invert phasing) to see if I can get this as a ring tone.
>> ARTICLE
Are you good at doing that? I tried to use an OST to cancel out some background music to get clean dialogue, but I was never able to get it working.
>> ARTICLE
Audio for shows and film are mixed and mastered in a different way (broadcast limiting, 5.1 mixed down to stereo, differing home releases, Japanese vs. English mastering, etc.) compared to official CD releases of vocal tracks and background music. I would say that if you are wanting to extract dialogue from a show or film, pull out the 5.1 audio from DVD and extract the center front channel. A lazy mix will only have stereo music on the left and right channels, leaving dialogue and positional SFX (which will be spread across all channels) to the center.

For invert phasing to work, the instrumental music needs to be exactly the same in the main source too, dynamics and all. The acapella may be imperfect with clashing frequencies from the music, but that's the nature of a DIY acapella compared to an official release. Never use lossy (MP3) sources either, get as raw a source (wav CD rips or lossless conversions) as possible.

Also, I have considerable less success doing this with Japanese music compared to western. I've tried using main tracks and instrumentals on the same Japanese CD single for a lot of releases, but whatever mastering process that seems to be the norm in Japanese music studios, they tend to do separate full mixing and mastering passes on the main track and instrumental, which causes analog fluxes in effects (reverbs especially) and tape use in older songs. Music from the west tends to be more 'lazy' in that it will do a mixing pass on the instrumental music, throw the acapella on it, do a basic limiting pass for the main track, then just mute the acapella and do it again. I assure you, all this makes sense to us insane sound engineers.

My one success doing invert phasing with a Japanese song was with [BERSERK -Forces-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkYYYew8CUI) of all things, and even then there was horn sections in the instrumental/dub not present in the main track, as well as some rather harsh reverb bleed. I'll throw it on the net some day, if I feel a reason to.

So I decided to read a little of the manga. And guys, as much as I hate to admit defeat, Rachnera is indeed best girl. 

I didn't think it possible, that someone could come along and be better than Papi, but she did. And by the 8 legs of God did she.

Papi will always be my favourite character in the show, but there is no denying that Rachnera will lead the harem to new heights that only a spider could reach.

Just you wait, you may not appreciate her yet, but she will spin her web upon you and you will never wish to leave it's firm bondagy grasp.

**TY For the gold, I shall not disappoint for next weeks episode.  Fellow brothers who are fighting the same battle, FIGHT ON!**
My girlfriend just caught me watching this on my day off.  I was about to close the player and she was like "nah keep it on".  As it was getting hot and steamy in the episode,  i was sweating even more because I didnt want her to think it was my fetish or anything.  She's now watching the beginning episodes and Im freaking out over here. 

edit:I left my apartment.  I told her I was going to go running for a bit.  The last time I worked out was when we first met.  *That was 2 years ago* 

**EDIT**: As I got back she mentions "Well that was fast..." (WELL FUCK YOU TOO). I told her that it was too hot.  I took a quick shower, changed clothes and I'm back on the couch.  I decided I wanted to catch up on my manly shows so I popped in Game of Thrones.  Half hour into the episode, She sits on the couch too albeit somewhat distant to me and I know the *fight* is about to start...

**Her:**That was an interesting show, the one with monster girls"

**Me:** *Fuck yeah it's interesting but ahem* Yeah I just watch it to pass time.

**Her:**Are you into that kind of-" 

**Me:** BEFORE you even mention it babe, no I'm not.  I just watch it to pass time and it's something different.

**Her:**Okay?...well which one is your favor-

**Me:** I'M NOT GETTING INTO THIS.  

**Her:**Why are you getting mad?!, All I'm asking is- 

**Me:** I KNOW YOU LIKE JON SNOW AND GO ON REDDIT TO EXPRESS YOUR LOVE FOR THE STARK BOYZ

**Her:**WHAT!?, *Scoffs* Nooo.  He's just fictional.  Why are you getting so defensive about this?

**Me:**I'm sorry, That run has got my heart pumped up and my blood running.  I'm just a bit on edge.

**Her:**But you probably only ran around the block" 

**Me: ( !!!**

**EDIT 2:** After more lazing around I proceeded to ask her what did she think about the anime. I'll try and phrase this as best as possible, sorry for grammar and punctuation.

**Me:**How'd you like the anime?

**Her:** It's weird, borderline hentai but I guess I can see why guys like it, it really is *different*"

**Me:**Like I said, it's just eye candy.

**Her:**So....Which one would you kill, fuck, and marry???

**Me:** [Here we go...] (http://i.imgur.com/TSrMmuU.gif)

**Me:**Okay fine.  I'd marry Tio the ogre chick, kill Kimihito (The lead guy), and I'd fuck Rachnera the spider chick.

**Her:**Hahahaha that's hella lame, Why would you marry the most boring person in the series???

**Me:** [Really...](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CCeUwxIUsAAw-48.jpg) Well then what about you? what would 
YOU pick hmm?

**Me:**That's interesting.  So you don't mind it when I watch this show?

**Her:**Let's watch the next episode together and if it gets worse, yeah you might as well be cheating on me and watching porn.

You can ask her to *dress up* like a spider and play with "webs", but deep down in your heart, you'll know it's just not the same. That's not what you want. What you want can never be, and some pathetic imitation will only spoil the whole fantasy.

Don't let this come between you two. You can still put her on stilts and pretend she's Tio.
>> ARTICLE
See, and this is why it's conflicting me so much.  She's going to ask me "SO WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE GIRL HUH?!".  And I know she's expecting me to say "Rachnera" but NO.  My favorite girl has exposed the *LEAST* amount of ecchi.

YES I'm part of team Tio.

If "least amount of ecchi" is your barometer, don't expect to stay on that team too long...

*I can't wait*.  Here's another thing waiting to burn into flames.  Tio is the tallest *and sexiest* out of the rest of the girls.  My girl is also conscious of her height at times (She's 5'4 and I'm 6'0).  If she finds out that my favorite is Tio , she'll immediately say "Oh you like taller girls huh".

I'm not going to win today.

"Monoeye." Really? Okay then. 

If this were any other show, I would critique the fuck out of the premise that a diplomatic law had such a gaping blind spot that the visiting entity could violently assault and detain citizens of the host nation with nigh impunity. But this is Monster Musume, and common sense is suspended from 12:30 to 1:00 pm Tuesday afternoons.

Now then: I FUCKING TOLD YOU ALL. 

Did I not bring you prompt tidings of best girl's arrival? Did I not import upon you her glory? But I confess, even I, her herald, was not entirely prepared. I knew she would be nothing short of magnificent, but foolishly neglected that this fact would apply to her voice as well. So soft, so silky, so mischievously malicious, could there be another voice suited to the role? I say thee nay.

That voice did it for me.  
RACHNEE IS BEST GIRL!

That's because there are subspecies under Monoeye. Cyclops is one of them, which are far stronger and larger in size.

... just in case you're wondering why they're not just called "Cyclops" to begin with.

I'm just wondering how One-Eyed Monk is a subspecies to begin with. They're biologically similar to regular monoeyes, just with a religious twist.

I have to say, the swapping of the opening and ending was genius. Opening with the monster squad, who was the focus of the beginning, then closing with the girls when the final girl is added to the house. It seems so obvious in hindsight, but I'm floored by how effective it was.

Excellent question! It is not!

It's actually a fomaldehyde-based blood substitute! Feel free to consult [my source.](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/dailylifewithamonstergirl/images/6/62/Zombina%27s_Secret.png/revision/latest?cb=20140217170412) yourself for more information.

Now, there's a reason the things in this show don't actually exist; they're simply not possible. But I really do have to give Okayado kudos for putting real thought into how they could. Really adds to the overall depth of the world that he thinks about this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Actually if things go the way I suspect, it is very possible Zombina is a Lovecraft inspired undead, which means her blood would be made from a special formula made by Doctor West.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_West%E2%80%93Reanimator
This makes sense because that version of undead is not contagious, and is specifically using a blood substitute.

>> ARTICLE
I don't even know what to say anymore. I'd been reading Monmusu for several months already when I first heard about the anime adaptation. I was excited, and every new bit of information released made me look forward to it more. But I couldn't help but worry at the same time. Adaptations can be a rough business. What if they censored it too heavily? What if the voices didn't seem quite right? What if the music, or the various new sound effects necessary slime and wings and tails and hooves and such didn't sound good?

But every single episode has just been perfection. Every voice is perfect. I listen to the character song demos on repeat. The animation is fluid and beautiful. Even the censorship is creative without being distracting. Simple angle, cropping, and tricks of placement to cover things up that can be easily moved around for the BDs. 

And now Best Girl is here. Next episode, she meets the girls and starts her new life in Darling's attic. It still amazes me that so much of this is nearly panel-for-panel in terms of source material loyalty. And some things are truly incredibly to see animated. Doppel's transformation, for one, was an incredible scene to see. And Rachnee, well shit, just about everything about Rachnee is perfect, as I expected.

Again, there's just nothing left to say. Everything about this series is fantastic, and I can only hope there's enough material in the manga for a season two when the time for it comes. Hell, from what I've seen from the daily clips, I wouldn't mind more original stuff from the studio, because they clearly know what they're working with here.

10/10, AotS, AotY, Best Girls, everything.

And I adored how the end credit music started to roll with the appearance of the it's-totally-gonna-be-canon-look-at-that-pure-white-background-and-hazy-blush OTP.

It's like the director was saying: "The actors have taken their places! NOW LET'S GIT THIS PARTY STARTED!"

There are times when I feel like the only leg lover around here who doesn't like spider legs. I'll take best girl Miia any day

\>leg lover

\>picks the one with no legs


>> ARTICLE
Strange the way these things work. Between you and me, my subconscious seems to consider Miia's tail as basically legs. She's the shapeliest of them (at least as far as *human* shapes go), except for Mero who doesn't count because fuck it, and her tail in the manga is almost always outside the panel--in most panels she just looks like she's got dem sexy hips, and your brain sort of fills legs in, because there are *supposed* to be sexy legs holding her hips up

Too little doppel love in this thread.
>> ARTICLE
I am so conflicted after watching this episode
>> ARTICLE
Honest question...anyone have Centura as their best girl? I am a Mia fan myself just curious if she gets any love
>> ARTICLE
Cerea is probably a close second for me right after Rachnera. I've always thought centaurs were pretty awesome. She may not be my best girl but she's still really awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Cereafag here, she gets some of the most adorkable moments in the series to be honest.

There is not nearly enough Tio love in these comments.

Is anyone else amused that the leg fetish guy was living with two girls that have no legs? Suu might be a third since her legs are optional.

i loved that the opening theme was the outro. what a clever idea thrown since introducing MON was the point in the first half.
>> ARTICLE
The first half of this episode was the most fun I've had in this show.
>> ARTICLE
I know this is heresy, but I don't really get the hype about Rachnera. She's definitely entertaining and I look forward to the situations that are bound to happen, but for me she's not best girl.

I find the MON girls more interesting, personally. Doppel and Zombina are my favorites so far. Those names though. I can tell a lot of thought went into them :p

Also, the Monoeye end card. Backbeard? "When anyone shows them the slightest kindness, they shout, "you damn lolicon!" and run the other way." lolwut
>> ARTICLE
There are a couple of reasons she's popular, but in my opinion, there are two main reasons:

1. The way she acts towards MC-kun as she starts to warm up to him. Between her claws and her webs, she's shown to be the most dangerous of the girls we've seen, and can easily take any of the others in a fight. At the same time, she's the only one who never actually hurt MC-kun. She loves to tease, but she shows tons of physical restraint, and she's also the only one who really seems to understand his situation: Being forced to pick the person you're going to spend the rest of your life with.

2. She also shows the other side of the Exchange Program. People love the catgirls and the bunny girls that started showing up with the program, and they favor the more human-like extraspecies. But at the same time, there are other non-human-like species, like Arachnee, that people find disgusting, or frightening.
>> ARTICLE
I first read the manga a couple years ago because I heard it had a lamia in it, and ever since then Mia has been best girl in my heart.

But man, animated Rachnera just stole that title.

I'm now officially team Rachnera

Cyclops-chan's VA is more moe than I would have imagined the character.

Sexiest zombie 

And then Zombina tells Dopplet to put on some clothes while her chest is fully exposed. Legit! 

I really like Arache's personality but the body type is really offputting. If only she would have looked a bit more like [this](http://www.f2p.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Elise_concept.jpg)

EDIT : Oh yeah, next episode is the sick MC episode. Incoming proof that Suu is better girl. Hidrating MC and stuff.

Ok, this is the best comedy this season, or year, if not decade. I wasn't entirely decided between MonMusu and Shimoneta, but this show makes me cry of laughter. Every. Damn. Episode. At this rate, I will even buy a fucking figures! ^\(Mia&nbsp;figure&nbsp;when?)

Man all the girls in monster musume are top tier
>> ARTICLE
Like I've been saying, I think this is all going to come down to Miia and Rachnee. Suu is a close third, then Papi and Cenorea, and Mero is last due to outside factors.
>> ARTICLE
I think I've seen the light everyone. While something about the manga made them seem different then they do now, i can now admit something freely. Rachnee SECOND best girl with Zombina bringing up Third (sorry Miia still #1). It's sad that there's only 5 episodes left because of how damn amazing this anime is becoming. Best tree coming up soon so get ready folks!

Just read everything from the beginning. No censoring = greatness.
>> ARTICLE
Hey I forgot the about the chief, anyone want to take a guess whose father he is?
>> ARTICLE
[Do you really want to know?](/s "AFAIK, one of the bonus chapters heavily implies he is Papi's father, although it's kind of up for debate. Harpies are migratory and move place to place, breeding with practically anybody they can find to keep the gene-pool varied. It's never stated how many men Papi's mom was with before she decided to settle down with the chief.")


>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's what I was talking about.
>> ARTICLE
[You know...](/s "I only just realized that none of these girls have actual fathers. Miia was a product of a Lamia orgy, we're not really use if the chief is really Papi's father, Centorea never even met her father, no idea about Suu, Mero doesn't seem to have a father at all, and I've got a theory about Rachnera, but nothing concrete.")


>> ARTICLE
Still a Miia man but damn Rachnera's getting close to second place! Her character is very adorable and she seems like a great girl, I hope she ends up with darling-kun, that way I'll get Miia.
>> ARTICLE
The voices for MON squad was well chosen and we'll executed, although the cyclops one sounded a bit to "squeaky" but was fine regardless. Also coincidence or pure chance, (or I am biased)  that they took inspiration from the "Warcraft 3" ogres when designing the ogre girl? Also best anime of 2015!
>> ARTICLE
So... is Doppel's dress her skin or not?
>> ARTICLE
Not too sure why but the second segment feels really choppy and doesn't flow as well as the other episodes. Might need to check the manga to see if they tried to squeeze in too much stuff
>> ARTICLE
Huh, they switched the ED and the OP around. I don't think I've ever seen that before.  
So the MON squad is pretty cool. Cyclops-chan is cute, but the ogre girl is even cuter somehow. Zombie girl has a great not-giving-a fuck attitude, and the doppelganger has easily the best sexual potential out of any character in the show so far.  
And now, the spider girl. I hate to admit it, but she is legitimately great, despite the fact that spiders are the hellspawn of Satan and should be exterminated from the face of the earth.  
Final Monster Girl Hierarchy!  
1. Miia - She's had the longest time to grow on me, and she's ridiculously adorable when she's jealous.  
2. Rachnera - I don't know how, but they made a sexy spider girl work. And I'm not even a leg man.  
3. Cerea - I really like the whole chivalry / loyalty to the master thing. Also oppai.  
4th equal. Papi & Suu - These two seem more like little kids than actual harem members, but they do have their moments.  
6. Mero - She's alright, I guess. The whole tragic romance fetish doesn't really do anything for me.

Hey guys! I just started watching this show, AND I FUCKING LOVE IT.

I'm glad I was able to catch up to today's new Episode. Question, so this show airs a new ep every Wednesday? (My Time Zone is (UTC+08:00) ) And how many episodes is this show planning to have?

Anyways, things escalated with Rachnera today. I love her already. She's my new Best Girl! (Also my Leg Fetish has been reflected upon today. ._. )

Glad to be with you guys for this ongoing show!
>> ARTICLE
12 episodes, yes every Wednesday/Tuesday. Rachnera best girl.
>> ARTICLE
Only 12? Oh well, hope this show is doing well in Japan to warrant an OVA or Second Season! And hopefully some neat merchandise such as figures!
>> ARTICLE
Well considering they sold out of Miia daki's costing 800 DOLLARS in like 30 minutes, demand for monster is high.

So I'm guessing the less eyes a sniper's got, the more accurate her shot is? Probably why Cyclops girl is most suited as sniper since she doesn't have to worry about closing any extra eyes.

Ok.....well....she's.....fi-.....she is f-.......SHE'S FINE OKAY FUCK.

 Rachnera isn't as bad as I thought. She is okay ONLY because she doesn't have the creepy fangs spiders have and her legs arent hairy and stuff. She's got like plastic legs or like crab legs. Still my arcanhophobia ain't going nowhere fuck spiders.
>> ARTICLE
She has needleteeth, they appear retractable. She pulls them out when she is trying to scare people.

They arent fat and hairy like usual spiders right? 

Or are they like [this....NSFW AS FUCK](http://oglaf.com/8legs/)

She probably has chlecerae in the form of her retractable fangs, but no. She definitely has no pedipalps. Those would sorta kill any semblance to a humanoid face someone with 8 red eyes can have.

Ok she is fine....*for now*

Actually, she does have pedipalps. They're the "legs" that look like human legs, where her human torso meets her spider torso. They're apparently used to hold their human mates in place during copulation.

Heh, its funny because pedipalps are used by spiders to hold trapped prey- OH. Ironically, pedipalps have another use, I hope darling- kun likes pegging.

She ironically looks [more nude](http://m.imgur.com/xFc5jXJ) with her having a coat on

Damn kids using their [childhood immunity of touching older girls!](http://m.imgur.com/jmdfI02)

Wow. Possibly the best MonMusu episode yet. I never expected to cheer this hard for a slime girl. The way she is basically nude everywhere is pretty hilarious but  her heroic streak of using her own body as a protective buffer is pretty cool. Papi was also the MVP knowing Suu was harmless. Papi truly does have mother's intuition even when she acts childlike at times.
>> ARTICLE
One of my favorite things about this series is that all the girls have an unexpected side to their personality that, while not obvious, makes completely sense for their character. Despite looking childlike herself, Papi has surprisingly strong mothering instincts. Despite her insistence on loyally serving her master and behaving properly, Cerea has some surprisingly domestic desires.

Anyway, here are some slightly spoiler-y manga panels of Papi being motherly:

Green lives in the forest and contain high amount of toxins from all the poisonous plants it eats. Is very rude verbally. The poison can be used as a projectile weapon.
Black lives in heavily polluted areas, became black because of contamination. Violent and antagonist towards humans.

I saw something weird in Banjo's weekly Miia post. A few images flash quickly when Papi says Darling almost dies all the time. [This](https://i.imgur.com/fG78ISB.jpg) was one of them.

Another fun and energetic episode that introduces Suu who I think is really cute and has a good dynamic with Papi. The funniest part was when Papi said Darling-kun almost dies all the time. The other girls were cute too, Mila had a cute first scene and Horse woman was cute when Darling-kun was cleaning her plot. The family photo scene was good and cute too, thanks to the people who screencaped it. Next week we have another water based girl with a mermaid, I wonder if she has to be in a wheel chair on land. This might be a cliche, but I want someone from Darling-kun past like his family that's overseas to freak out over his harem.

Was nobody else bothered by a being with four legs tripping and falling because one of those four legs stepped in a slippery spot? Despite the anime tropes demanding that characters fall into each other, horses need to trip at least two legs simultaneously to fall. It's one of the big benefits of having four legs.

They did not remove the shredding episode, its coming in the future, they chose to remove that segment in order to make the entire episode dedicated to Suu.

Okay, so I finally decided to start watching this. I like it way more than I should...

Anyway, we got a slime girl! I love those cute things!

Once again this show makes me severely question my sexual preferences. This week, amorphous slime girls!  
I'm torn on the idea of slime girls, mainly because I'm convinced that touching one would feel extremely gross. However, the adjustable breast size is a big plus, and being effectively indestructible can't hurt either.

Really enjoy those monmusu collection end cards.

Wow... Suu's close-ups are fucking gorgeous. Cuteness level over 9000. She's much cuter here compared to the colored panels in the manga.

Is it just me or has Miia been kind of pushed off to the side? That's disappointing, but everyone is adorable so far so I'm not too upset by it.
>> ARTICLE
At least she had a good, cute scene at the beginning. 
>> ARTICLE
Sadly, she does kinda get pushed off to the side as more girls are introduced, and it doesn't help they skipped Chapter 7, which was Miia-centric and a very strong bonding session for her and MC-kun.
>> ARTICLE
That's a shame. Oh well...
>> ARTICLE
Eh, hopefully it'll be included with the disc release as an extra episode. Or maybe it'll be an OVA.
>> ARTICLE
It's the shedding scenario, right?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. Yes it is.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic ep as always but they skipped ch7 and it makes me sad :(
>> ARTICLE
The consensus seems to be it'll be included later when it's more relevant to whats going on.

They have Chapter 7, and then a few chapters later, another scene related to it. They'll probably include the two scenes together.
>> ARTICLE
Which chapter do you mean? I can't remember off the top of my head
>> ARTICLE
[Manga spoilers](/s "Chapter 14. In Miia's room, there's a big bag of shedded Lamia skin. The phony director tries to steal it along with what he thinks is Papi's egg.")

So, I guess I'm not really much a fan of Suu.  I mean she's ok, but meh.

Miia still best girl, ep4 and going strong.

Edit:  Although Centorea's voice in the opening song is pretty hit.

everyone has racism and fundies and anti-immigrationists, but the US is still much better than Japan with racism and immigrants, where there are no laws banning discrimination, and there are still businesses with [No Gaijin](http://japanfocus.org/-the_asahi_shimbun_culture_research_center-/2932/article.html) policies. At least in the US immigrants have some legal protections. 

also 

> the most insane religious fundamentalists of any country

have you even heard of ISIS?

I have to give you the getting shot point, everyone I know in the US has been shot, in fact, I was shot twice last week. The gun violence is just terrible here, people just getting shot left and right.

Did the creators honestly just zoom in on a couple of 8 year old girls' soaked chests? Ecchi? Sure, fine. Smut? Guilty pleasure, okay. But this?  Shows all 0 oz of respect this piece has towards the audience. "Here's some hentai that we can make money off of."

Enjoy what you like, but this is the reason the anime industry is not being taken seriously outside of Japan. More of this cheap cash grab smut, less of pieces of actual worth. Complaining about "Oh, why don't we see more creatively staggering shows like Shin Sekai Yori nowadays (made literally 0 yen)?" or "Why is Ghibli going on hiatus?" or "Why are my favorite shows not getting sequels?" Well, Here is (part of) your answer. 

Sorry for the rant and I'm not against all Ecchi. However, the inconsistency among anime viewers bugs me.

>> ARTICLE
could u explain me what the part B mood is? a certain period of an episode?
>> ARTICLE
A lot of shows are split in to two fairly distinct parts (usually with the commercial break in between), which are usually just referred to as A and B. Sometimes each part has a separate title (think Spongebob, Adventure Time, etc.) but other times there's not (like this show). Other options include two simultaneous plots that both go throughout the whole episode, alternating every scene (Seinfeld and a lot of sitcoms use this approach), or three or more distinct parts (a lot of anime adapted from 4-koma use this).

It's important to never let your lamia cook. They have absolutely atrocious senses of taste (like most predators) and things either end up being way to strong, horrifyingly flavored or potentially poisonous.

It is okay to let your Centaur cook though, and harpies as well (though you may have to help them).

The numbers given in the manga for the rough senses of taste possessed by both were that lamia's had about 1/25th the ability to taste things that people do, and that centaurs had 40x the ability to taste (and with some additional looking into it on my part, I found out that predators do indeed have awful senses of taste and herbivores have amazing senses of taste). The real interesting bit was finding out that [spoiler](/s "Fish have some of the most sensitive palates on the planet and often have the ability to taste things through their skin alone")
>> ARTICLE
But cooking *for* your lamia...That's a totally different story...
>> ARTICLE
Well... I think that Miia could probably boil eggs, or pickle things or a number of other things safely, but for stuff with actual nuanced flavors (or the potential to be inedible due to spiciness or the like) it's best not to leave her in control.

Fortunately lamia in the setting seem to LOEV EGGZ.

Is ok, she doesn't need to cook, she just needs to cuddle. And I mean, Miia is objectively best cuddler :3

Wait, isn't Suu immune to Miia's cooking? Or anything poisonous at all? [That's actually a pretty important part about her] (/s "that makes her best girl.") XD

Also, I guess they didn't have enough money to hire camera men for the dude in the anime. Oh well, looking forward to Rachnera and the MON squad.
>> ARTICLE
The cameraman just disappeared from the story in the manga. It is probably decided that he was a loose end consider that he was an accomplice who's not accounted for, so it was better that he never existed.

Actually, Miia and Centorea take the cameramen out in the manga. I assume Smith arrests them when she arrives.

I assume Miia's cooking is Just. That. Bad.

Thanks Japan for somehow making skin shedding lewd.
>> ARTICLE
And just like that, Darling-kun has reached third base with Mia. 
>> ARTICLE
One of the many reasons why MiiaXDarling is almost certainly going to be the manga ending (apart from the fact that Miia is kinda the mangaka's baby) is that...sexually...Miia is the only girl that he's gone anywhere with, although not always on purpose. There have been a number of very intimate moments, sexual or not, between the two, more than with any of the other girls--and I think it's worth mentioning that Miia's been brought to orgasm by him (again, intentional or not) more than all the others combined 

Plus, Miia's just best girl. So, I mean, how could that not be the ending?

My friends, nay, my brothers. So far, you've seen some shit: lamias, harpies, centaurs and mermaids. You have liked some of what you have seen. Even prematurely declared a best girl. It's fine, I forgive you. I forgive you because I understand. The frontier upon which we tread is ripe with delectable fruits, it's only natural that you would seize upon the first promising candidate you see.

But now you must understand: this has all been mere preparation. Innoculation. Had you been introduced to best girl Rachnee from the very beginning, your mind would have reeled, your skin would have prickled and your blood would have run thick with dread as the fiend in the depths of your heart clawed its way to the surface in one viscious thrust in order to cry out in deviant jubliee. "Who'd want to fuck a spider?" you would ask, blissfully unaware of your [ignorance](http://i.imgur.com/4r9ZHKl.png), much like Adam before he bit into the fruit. But you are a different man (or woman: we have those, right?) than the one you were not even two months ago, are you not? Something inside you has changed. Mutated. The serpent stands ready to make his offer.

So we ask, are you worthy? Of course not. That's why you were treated to but a mere glimpse of best girl Rachnee this week. Take this final week to reflect upon yourselves, and renounce the false idols that you have taken. Next week...next week, you shall experience revelation.

She's actually the most fleshed out in terms of depth. She's quite insecure about her truly monstrous appearance, (yeah, everybody here who keeps talking about arachnophobia, that's exactly what bothers her) and thinks of herself as a burden on others. But she plays it off very subtly, she doesn't talk much about it, and never shows any self pity. Most of the time, she acts really easy going and cool. She spends her time playing pranks on the other girls.

Also, whenever Suu turns it all around on her (Suu is the only one she can't bind) Rachnera's reaction is one of flustered innocence. It's really quite funny to see her put in a situation out of her control.

Waifu wars are now Pokemon battles, and it's like we're all kids again. *We've come full-circle*.
>> ARTICLE
That is disingenuous. Saying they are like Pokemon battles implies that Waifu can be traded and caught. They are much more like Digimon battles. The Waifu can evolve to a higher form, but you don't pick your Waifu. Your Waifu picks you, and you are together forever. 
>> ARTICLE
Now that I think of it, Digimon had quite a variety of Waifu worthy girls. Angel-girl (whose cloth was more revealing then any demons) Plant-girl, Fox-girl, Fairy Girl.... etc

Ah, Miia. This chapter was adorable enough in the manga, but now I'm *really* happy about the VA choice they made for best girl. I was skeptical at first, but Miia's voice *makes* this chapter. And I ain't even talking about the...errrr...moans. Sad Miia, all embarrassed about her shedding--I knew it would be even cuter in animated form (to the degree that that's possible--poor Miia in the manga chapter makes you want to jump in the page and cuddle her until she feels better), but I didn't have any idea *how* cute her VA would make it

This episode MC-kun got:

- hit on the head and crushed by a door with the impact of a charging Lamia
- strangled (but really, he is probably completely immune to strangle damage by now)
- his neck broken at least twice
- poisened
- clubbed by three enraged monster girls (and one copying one)

And we saw another Darling-Punch!!! - or is it a Gojujii-Punch!!! since he did it for the sake of Papi?
>> ARTICLE
The answer to that last question is yes, yes it was. But yeah, doors are his natural predator as a Darling-kun and his body is sturdier than adamantium. 
>> ARTICLE
And welcome back to Wild Mosntergirl Kingdom. We've got a fascinating specimen today - we're observing a domestic Darling-kun in it's natural habitat, his home. The Darling-kun is noted only for its incredibly strength and resilience, but also its abilities as a homemaker and natural resistance to prejudice and quick judgments. Darling-kuns use their kind and accepting nature to attract females of various species as potential mates. In this area, the Darling-kun has a symbiotic sort of relationship with its neighbor, the Coordinator, who often find themselves in charge of an excess of females. More on that in a later episode, however.

Now then, we've managed to track down a Darling-kun's nest. This one seems to be fairly far along already. It appears he has 5 potential mates in his habitat, and it seems that the associated Coordinator has already begun the mating ritual. This is a very long and convoluted process, but it necessary for the Darling-kun to prove his ability to care for both his mate and any potential offspring. In most of his interactions with a potential mate, she will likely injure the Darling-kun in some way. While most species have their own ways to test a Darling-kun's strength, by far his most potent enemy is the Door. A Darling-kun will typically have a fairly large number of Doors placed throughout his nest to assist his candidates in testing his worth. This both ingratiates them and serves to differentiate each candidate's place within the Darling-kun's nest. Today, it seems this Darling-kun is continuing to advance his relationship with a Harpy and a Lamia currently in residence in his nest. The Darling-kun has made exellent progress today. He's proven his resilience to his natural enemy, the Door, ingestion of poisonous substances, blunt force trauma, and having his neck snapped.

However, it's worth noting that a Darling-kun's role in the mating dance is more complex than simply sustaining injury. He must be cautious not to make the mating candidates worry about his wellbeing, as this can upset them greatly. To keep reminders of his merits fresh, a Darling-kun can also sometimes be seen assisting his candidates with intimate physical tasks, and protecting them from predators.

Join us again next week, when we'll continue our surveillance of this Darling-kun and see how he confronts capture at the hands of a larger predator.

Watch a loli(?) experience child birth... Another one for the fucked up things I see in anime. It's trending close to the infamous toothbrush scene
>> ARTICLE
Papi is an adult and egg laying is something that harpies do regularly. I believe they even describe the size of the egg in the manga... well they show the egg in the show anyways. What darling was doing was kind of massaging the stomach and helping push the egg down a little - which is really just more about comfort than necessity.
>> ARTICLE
We are long past the toothbrush scene and there is no sign of slowing down. Welcome to Monmusu!
>> ARTICLE
It's outright stated that Papi is a fully grown, adult Harpy, and this comes as a huge shock to the other members of the household.

Papi's particular variety of Harpy is physically small for the purposes of flight. There are other varieties that don't fly and are generally much larger.

[Spoilers](/s "We see her mother in the manga, she's exactly the same size. In fact, without her mother's excessive makeup and bleached-blonde hair, it's impossible to tell them apart.")

Well, it isn't hard to get to "adorable" when you started with "jumping spider"

Did you notice that her "hair ties" are actually a third set of eyes.

>> ARTICLE
It's kind of ambiguous. They're definitely designed to look like another set of eyes, but they still might be hair ties. Her hair is tied up and spiders don't usually have eyes that bulge that far out.

She doesn't have to be a Nazi, the Japanese still wear armbands for non-Nazi related activities

Papi's chapter is one of the lewder ones by far. Partly because it's just kinda bizarre. Miia's chapter isn't actually all that lewd, apart from the...errr...moaning--what always made Papi's egg chapter so much weirder for me was that it was much more explicitly sexual, whereas Miia's really isn't. That is, if the moaning wasn't included. Miia's shedding is also just cuter :3

Yeah, they'll eat pretty much anything. Papi eats chicken and doesn't like vegetables, Mero is somewhat fond of fish and seafood. Centorea can only eat vegetables, but horse meat doesn't seem to bother her in the least.
>> ARTICLE
[Manga](/s "I know that Mero eats seafood, the recent arc in the manga covered that. But there was horse meat in there? Is it a regular product in Japan? Why would it come to Centorea seeing horse meat?")
>> ARTICLE
Ah yes, the best of all the Miia chapters, finally animated. And that's saying something, because I mean every Miia chapter is best chapter. 

By the way, why did nobody tell me that [this](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31121/Monster_Musume_no_Iru_Nichijou:_Hobo_Mainichi_OO!_Namappoi_Douga) exists? There's some quality Miia cuteness in there \^^

Oh yeah, and Papi was in this episode too. I think.

So... it's this episode.

There is no going back after this. Once you've seen it, you are forever bounded to monster girls.

Loved this episode you guys were right about the shedding scene being good, but the directer was creepy and not fun at least we got a darling punch out of it. I do think that some of the writing and jokes were a bit obvious like cooking Papi's egg, but Darling calling it out helped a bit.

In celebration of next episode, I went and read the chapter, where Rachnera is introduced. Rachnera is really only spider in my heart. Even though I hate pretty much all kinds of instects, arachnids and other small and yucky stuff, Rachnera is only exception to this rule so far.
>> ARTICLE
Well, an anime has successfully given me a boner with a skin-shedding scene. What has become of my life?  
Also spider~~bro~~girl next episode. You know, this show convinced me to be able to find snakes and birds sexy, but I just don't know if I can feel the same way about spiders. We'll see. I'm kinda scared though.

Dear god it felt so wrong to watch this. They made shedding skin so lewd dear god. It was still hilarious though.
>> ARTICLE
Group dynamic gets full power next week, get hype people.
>> ARTICLE
Holy hell, I knew this episode will be good, but this blasted any expectations I had through the roof! Miia's voice actor, a favorite of mine for a long while, was out of this world, and it felt so wrong and so right at the same time, mainly because I associate her voice with characters of tamer nature. I'm also loving Papi's voice.

In any case, [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3glybs/spoilers_monster_musume_no_iru_nichijou_episode_6/ctzahxh) summarizes this pretty well. I'm more of a Miia person myself, but I definitely understand the sentiment the comment poster describes. Next week is going to be as delicious as this one, at the very least, and that means something. Look forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
At this point it isn't a guilty pleasure to be watching this show. It's a Pleasure.
>> ARTICLE
I love the extra visual metaphors for this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I loved this episode so much. Best girl getting her shedding scene that is a huge step in her relationship with Darling-kun. The director really came off as the sleeze-ball he was in the manga, but I'm pretty sure he had a crew with him then (correct me if I'm wrong, been awhile since I've read these chapters). They really should've added like flashing letters saying Suu was just copying the others, since that was the funny part of that particular scene. Second best girl Papi humming the theme at the end killed me with how adorable it was. Darling once again shows us he is pretty much immortal, and has near superhuman strength when he's protecting his women. Can't wait to see Zombina and the rest of MON in action tomorrow, as well as Miss Bondage herself!
>> ARTICLE
next week we get introduced to best girls 1-3. oh how they love to spoil us.

Wow, I'm out of the loop with anime. Didn't realise they actually turned Monster Musume into an anime. I remember reading the manga last year wondering if some studio would pick this one up. 

And it looks fab (   )

God damn this mc is such a badass. Its so refreshing seeing him punch assholes around.

Oh god, someone please get this OP out my head.

And..POP goes the neck. I swear you could make a drinking game of the number of times Kimihito has been accidentally hurt by Miia alone.

Not only did Darling-kun show again he has a mean right hook but he tricked him into breaking his camera, AND smashing an egg on his face. REKT

Best girl finally arrives next week! #legman

So does this mean we aren't getting a sick MC adaptation?  Or is it just going to be changed slightly?  Because I really, really like that chapter.  It's another showing of why Suu is just so great.
>> ARTICLE
They switched around a few scenes to make them more relevant to the scenario, so I assume they're going to add in the Sick MC-kun scenario later on. It is a pretty strong bonding session between him and Suu, and there's absolutely no reason to leave it out.
>> ARTICLE
Has anyone found or translated the OP and ED lyrics? I'm really curious to know what each girl is singing!!

I could watch the MC punch the fuck outta people all day, guy's got a monster fist O.O

Well we got snake shedding and egg laying marked on new fetishes.
>> ARTICLE
Having seen the Butterfly Boy yesterday, that shedding scene made me very uncomfortable.

Wait does the MC have an official name or is "Darling" really all we have?
>> ARTICLE
His official name is Kurusu Kimihito. They rarely use it, though.
>> ARTICLE
Just like his non-reaction face...
>> ARTICLE
He actually had it for longer than usual this episode when consoling Miia about shedding.
>> ARTICLE
Okay that line between r/anime and r/hentai_gif is getting blurred. Shinometa and Monsume that line is going to break.

You say that like it's a bad thing.

Can someone tell me what chapter in the manga this is?

The shedding is chapter 7. The director is chapter 14.

So TIL, Papi is the same voice actress as Kurumi from Gekkou Garashi. I cannot see her in the same light now, and may have just earned some points inching her closer to the best girl spot (Miia is still in the lead though, I'm afraid of what would happen if she took on Akame's talents through voice actress osmosis)

My reaction to the first half:

>> ARTICLE
Anyone else notice how MC got more normal-eyed time this episode? 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else suddenly craving eggs?
>> ARTICLE
What if you're afraid of spiders and saw the next episode. I can only imagine.
>> ARTICLE
I just hope, they do not overdo it with our Spider Monster Girl. Please, do not make her Legs to realistic.. Some has a instinct fear of Spiders, special Females fans, you know

Please take that into account, if you create future Human-Monsters hybrids. The natural fear of Human against small creatures or insects. Like big bird Spider, some kind of Worms and such. you know, do not draw them to much realistic, just to be save


>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure this comment is entirely English...
>> ARTICLE
I wish they make the legs as realistic as possible. I just want to see her climb down from up there.

Update: last night laying in bed I decided to imagine such a sight. "What if Rachnee was hanging on the ceiling right here and then climbed down the wall? I'd be pretty scared at first" I thought to myself "but relieved it was her. But... what if it was not her, but a real spider instead?". So I imagined a 12 ft wide spider hanging on the ceiling of my room in the middle of the night. "My god, what kind of fangs would it have? It'd be enormous!" I looked to the door as I was laying in bed, remembering how quickly can spiders jump. "Would I make it out of the room". I pondered feeling uneasy then imagined a 2 ft long fang hitting me in the back as I was attempting to flee. I shuddered, rolled over to the other side and went to sleep afraid.

Needless to say I regretted making this comment. Still stand by it though.

One thing I don't see mentioned too often in these threads is how good the opening is. This show's OP is one of the most relentlessly optimistic and upbeat songs I've ever heard - plus, I'm a sucker for any songs where the actual character VAs are singing.

I'm gonna miss the hell out of this show, in a weird monster fetish kind of way.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, one of the few openings I never skip. Really good and catchy song!
>> ARTICLE
I get to listen to music while I work. All these buff sweaty men around me are listening to 80's hard rock while I'm listening to a kawaii song about some dude wanting to bang monster girls.
>> ARTICLE
My favorite part is the counting sequence after the title but then Mero has to jump in saying something like 'aoi chotto ga ii' and ruins it.  
>> ARTICLE
This OP has been stuck in my head since the start of the show. All I can say is I've probably listened to it more than 12 times ^^x10
>> ARTICLE
It even follows the structure of the usual Harem/RomCom OP to the book. 

I'll try to explain with my own words. Many OPs in this genre follow more or less this rough plan:

1. Show/Cast Appeal - All main characters are shown, and you are informed what kind of anime this is.
2. Title
3. Individual Appeal - This segment is usually 2 verses-long and each girl gets her introduction "card" shown (usually, static shots of detailed character art).
4. Prelude to action - A constrained cut of the girls that leads into:
5. Chorus+Action Individual Appeal - The girls are showcased again, but in very animated cut.
6. Action Cast Appeal - Animated harem gag that leads into:
7. Ends with a Group picture

OPs that somewhat follow this structure (NSFW):

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Bx7jxD0qQ
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OskJQctyJnM
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HFnBgAGLCc
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2272PmvmUE (lol same chorus as above)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXB4M1Od2NI
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tgoTOncWyc
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r6HUlG478M
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2272PmvmUE

I actually prefer when OPs don't follow that structure, but MonMosu executes it really well.
>> ARTICLE
Try the full version. Catchy as fuck.

It still amazes me how low Japanese VA's can go on the octaves for characters. THE VOICES WHY ARE THEY SO LOW AND CUTE
>> ARTICLE
Most shows i dont even watch OP. But with this, whenever i came home on tuesdays and thought "Oh i can watch the new MonMusu" somewhere it my head it started.... "Monster, Monster, Mo Mo Mo Mo Monster ...."
>> ARTICLE
*Nee, Darling!*
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: In each of the girl's own version of the OP, they call out Kimihito by the name *they* most often use for him, so like Papi's is "Goshujin", Centorea's is "Aruji-dono", and Miia's is of course "Darling" :D
>> ARTICLE
I love you.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that just in the back of my mind listening to Rachnera's. Like five minutes after I'd finished listening, I thought "hey, she said 'honey', not 'darling'..."
>> ARTICLE
.. And "Honey" for Rachnera, "Master" for Suu and "Dana-sama" for Mero. That's a realy nice touch, imho.
>> ARTICLE
Papi's catches me off guard every time. I love it!
>> ARTICLE
Mm I just listened to Papi's version. Ah the beautiful voice of Ari Ozama. That "ne Goshujin". Aw so cute
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait for each version to be released! :D
>> ARTICLE
They're all already available for 1,600 Yen each (there are 6 albums) in Amazon.co.jp. 2 solo song and 1 solo OP for each album. Best album? Papi's album. That Papism and Papi Dance song is so awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so you'd have to pay **9600 yen ($80) (52)** to get the music for this show legally? That's absurdly expensive...
>> ARTICLE
I don't see this as absurd... Miia's dakimakura that costs $800 got sold out in 1 hour.... 
>> ARTICLE
>Wait, so you'd have to pay 9600 yen ($80) (52) to get the music for this show legally? That's absurdly expensive...

That's not really abnormal for anime in Japan.  Heck, it's normal to pay $80 for 3 episodes on DVD.
>> ARTICLE
I believe each one is released. They were released with the character songs, and assuming Rachnera was the last one, they are all available.

This entire season, I thought Papi was #1 and Suu #2. After this episode the two have switched.

SUU IS LOVE SUU IS LIFE
>> ARTICLE
OP purposefully did not add Poison Suu, knowing it would destroy the competition
>> ARTICLE
I can see that a lot have mighty fine taste~ Go Rachnee
>> ARTICLE
I find it funny because every poll ends up with Rachnee head and shoulders above the other girls. 

Just as god intended.
>> ARTICLE
Why though? Is it just because of the bondage thing?
>> ARTICLE
[This is the reason](http://i.imgur.com/9gjN2Up.jpg)

>> ARTICLE
Imo she's probably the character with the most depth in the entire show. It's explained in the very next chapter that didn't make the cut, and a few chapters later. 

All the girls are insanely dangerous to Honey, as you saw in this episode. Rachnee has never hurt him despite being the easiest of all of them to seriously injure someone. Her fingers are razors, her legs end in knives, and she could crush you by sitting on you, yet she takes the most care of all of them to keep from hurting anyone. 

Then you have Rachnee herself. Equally sexy and dangerous, she's a tease and she knows it, and is an expert at her artwork. Basically yeah spider bondage lol.
>> ARTICLE
This is why rachnee will always be at least a head over any of the other girls in term of character in our unblinded hearts. 

Actually though people who are pretty great at bondage tend to understand being gentle to others and not hurting others better. At least from my few irl friends (who a good amount are bdsm lovers) can probably confirm this for me.

[tfw no one likes Mero](http://i.imgur.com/mOfmBt0.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
As of right now you, me & two others know Mero is best girl.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Fools all of them. How can they not see Mero is the one true [best girl](http://i.imgur.com/3LQDBZz.png), kneel peasants.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's because her quirk as a harem member is extremely specific that it takes a lot of effort to pull off gags that involves Mero. Thus, less gags -> less screentime -> less popular.

I still like her though. I hope the payoff from her current character arc would be good so she'd be on par with the other girls.
>> ARTICLE
Well that's because she got the least screen time among the main girls. Fortunately, she's important in the current arc in the manga. :D
>> ARTICLE
Lala has less. Even as a member of the harem she appears rarely. 
>> ARTICLE
Lala is all about that end game. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure the author said somewhere she is meant to be more of a side character.

That happens when you basically have to maintain a cast of 12 or so (manga total roughly) girls.

Welp. Going back to my dull and boring Tuesdays again.... sigh.

I don't care what people would think about me as a person or about my preferences. I enjoyed it a lot when reading the manga, and it's been beautifully adapted as a show. Other than giving us glorious fanservice, it also managed to establish an interesting world. The amount of biological and anatomical stuff that they included to make for some of the most interesting quirks for characters is also amazing. 

**I'm giving this shit a 10/10.** 
>> ARTICLE
This anime awoke a side of weird shit in me I never knew before. This anime is honestly a 10/10 its a harem ecchi but it tries to be different from both genres and does a good job at it.

Needless to say I will be soon doing MGO and fate VN on Tuesdays so I am fine

[el psy congroo](http://i.imgur.com/JlsCmU8.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I actually thought that was a chunnibyou reference there for a moment. 

Then I realized that's retarded and probably not the case. I don't understand Japanese so tfw not enough context.
>> ARTICLE
Yellow eye and eyepatch is definitely Chuunibyou.

"La jodaso stiana" is almost definitely a play on "El Psy Congroo."

I don't think you're wrong. Lots of references this episode, including a Touhou yukkuri.
>> ARTICLE
I think both Chuunibyou and S;G are referenced here. And possibly a lot more that I don't recognise.
>> ARTICLE
God bless the author and his based referencing of everything that at the time of him writing was popular shit.
>> ARTICLE
The reference actually precedes Steins;Gate and references the original term from the [meme 2ch copypasta that Okabe's character is based on. ](https://archive.moe/a/thread/62451238/#q62455109)
>> ARTICLE
It also referenced Fate/Stay Night when Darling made a string of deathflags, one of which belongs to [Fate route spoilers](/s "Archer, when Rin orders him to stay behind in Einsbern Castle to buy them time to escape from Berserker, knowing that it is impossible for him to beat Heracles, to which he responds 'You don't mind if I beat that thing do you?' ")

I'm pretty sure every other death flag raised during that scene was also taken from other series, but I was only able to recognize the Fate one.
>> ARTICLE
The "I'm not afraid of anything anymore!" is a reference to Madoka Magica.
>> ARTICLE
Well it was a pretty obvious reference :]

Dark Flame Master is from [Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14741/Chuunibyou_demo_Koi_ga_Shitai!)

and

Dark and Dark is from [Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25159/Inou-Battle_wa_Nichijou-kei_no_Naka_de)

The only thing worse than knowing that this is the last episode of this we'll have for a while is not waking up to a deredere lamia waifu every day. Such is life.

Maybe one day we'll discover a secret island full of  beautiful monster girls.

Ahh, what a beautiful world that will be.

Gene therapy yourself into looking and physically being a 20 year old again then.

well, in the meantime go check out a cute little harem show called Omamori Himari. Sure it's not monster girls like Monster Musume....but there's great character chemistry, really funny self-aware humor, and most the girls are youkai, so there's that.

That, and read the manga. 

Or read the doujins.

Or play monster girl quest.

I am not ashamed of what I have become.

I'm guessing someone in the animation department went like:

"So we had a shit ton of budget left and decided to blow it all on the last episode"

It's hilarious how in a season full of animation problems, the best animated episode belongs to an ecchi show about monster girls.

I'm hope they make a second season of this soon. Probably the best new show of this season.

See you, Space Lamia.

The animation was epic, but they dialled down the artwork in the first half in order to do that fluid animation.

I would've preferred the old style though.

All best girl wars and wishing for a monster girlfriend aside, this show has been perfect.

I've been reading the manga for quite a while now, and when I saw that an anime was announced, I was very...VERY wary of it. I saw what was done to Rosario+Vampire. I feared the worst.

But damn, this anime adaptation has been utterly perfect. It captured the manga perfectly...and it's been great seeing the characters come to life. I'll be buying the Blu-Rays as soon as I possibly can. Totally worth it.

shadows!

> Where'smyessaydammit!

Ha!

I have not forgotten about it. Like I've said, I prioritize my reviews/essays of the anime that I am watching first. Been too busy to devote time outside of them, for this essay or anything else really. I am even behind on my my once-per-season, research-driven piece that I need to set aside time for. Said time eludes me at every turn, though. :(

That being the case, I will try to get to some more of your reviews-of-my-reviews in the coming days. For you or anyone, I no longer want to make any kind of promises since I do not want to eat my own words, which I am already doing slightly with the essay in question.

> (though at this point, while I do still plan on doing your reviews, I am planning on putting much more attention into your other essay than I ever did with your reviews!)

Oh yea, definitely, which is why I did not want to slap something together just to have it. I felt that would be discourteous to you and unbecoming of me.

> Seriously though. We can't finish what we never start.

True.

At the minimum, and despite my previous words, I will guarantee that the essay will be out to you before my review of the anime (Akagami), since it would make little sense to finish them in the reverse order.

I have and I will respond to it soon.

>I did not want to slap something together just to have it. I felt that would be discourteous to you and unbecoming of me.

It's getting to the point that I almost wish you would do that much.

I can't exactly do more than hound you about it like I have been, so there's no point in ranting at you over it, so I'll leave it be. I'm really just hoping that you didn't forget about it, so I do this to remind you.

> I am even behind on my my once-per-season, research-driven piece that I need to set aside time for.

!!!

What the hell, now you tell me! I had no idea that this was something you do every season!

Dear god the possibilities just opened up!

I have a proposal now:

In place of your seasonal solo research project, how do you feel about making it a joint project? 

Busy with college as I am, I'm sure that I can still set aside enough time to do something like this!

In my mind, I have it like this: In place of your Akagami essay and/or in place of your current ideas for the research project, we work together to make a project out of the essay prompt I gave you before. Of course, the prompt will need to be changed to something that will be more easily explored, but that's not a big deal.

Here's the benefits as I see them: Your project is completed as planned, you get to see how I would do it (the more examples you have, the better off you tend to be as a writer I find), and I get to work closely with you on your writing process. I would be helping you for the entirety of the project instead of just playing catch up at the end, and you would be getting instantaneous feedback for your work.

Now for the hard part:

Of course, it sounds strange to propose a cooperative research project on *anime* of all things, but trust me, it can be done! And more importantly, it can be done even considering our unique relationship! Let me break it down for you a little more.

1. This is still *your* project, therefore
2. You will have the final say as to what goes on concerning the project; in essence, you are the project lead
3. You can choose to do whatever you want for the project, I'm sure you already have some ideas. I would personally recommend expanding the essay prompt I gave you into something like (and this is off the top of my head) *Explore the anime Akagami no Shirayuki-hime as it pertains to feminism.* or something like *Discuss the use of symbolism in the anime Akagami no Shirayuki-hime.* or *Interpret the anime Akagami no Shirayuki-hime.* That part's not that important, these are just to get the ideas going, the final prompt/thesis can be decided later.
4. My role in this will be mainly to provide ideas, perspective, and insight. That is, apart from helping you with your editing. Like I said, this is your show, and you can do whatever you want with it.
5. (extra/optional) If you would prefer, we could arrange to work on this in a different way entirely: splitting the project into parts for each of us to do, and collaborate with each other on our work would be (to some extent) ideal for this particular situation, as you would get the full amount of the benefits that I listed already, and probably a number more besides. (I'm in a rush again so I'm probably missing a lot, sorry)

I've been entertaining thoughts of doing something like this for a while now myself, so (as you can see) pretty excited at the thought of actually doing something.

Let me know what you think! I still have a few more things pertaining to this in mind that I haven't said yet, but I don't want to overwhelm you.

Also, I don't remember that particular anime well enough to take sides, that comment face just happened to be what I was looking for at the moment!

[Well?](#mug2)

> Thanks for posting these, always a highlight of the comments.

No problem!

Still be on the lookout for a separate thread that I may or may not be making that contains every single picture of Miia from this season!

> The question is, which is your favourite Mia moment from the season or are you going to wait for the BDs to answer that?

Probably going to have to wait for them BDs! :P

But if I was not counting them, I would probably say the very quick moment where they showed seven or so snapshots of Miia, MC, and their child, having fun at a picnic and at home. Seeing that melted my heart the first time I saw it. :3

I took MC's "dark past" more as a "chuunibyou" reference of the general kind, and not specifically in relation to Chu2Koi. His eyepatch is on the wrong eye, his arm bandages are on the wrong arm, and the words he is saying do not match!

the eyepatch was a direct opposite of Rikka's though! Opposite eye for the patch, but yellow gold right eye. :p

While it was nowhere in the manga, the Shokugeki style Cerea moment was phenomenal. I can't remember if it went into Kurusu's chunni past though. Best girl Miia ready to lay down her life to protect her man while toxic Suu was slightly more tame here. Enjoyed seeing the racist couple go boom during the chase scene.

In all this wild ride was a perfect recreation of the manga. They may have played with chapter orders a bit to make it make more sense but in all it was amazing. We all know that with the BDs there will me more than enough money to get a second season, so we gotta pray to the based monster gods to let it happen as more chapters are slowly getting released.

[Suu a cute](http://i.imgur.com/VJhjEwu.png)

It is sad to see this great anime coming to an end, luckily there is still the manga which is truely worth getting into if you can't say goodbye to your favourite monster girl. I can't even imagine my life without them anymore. 
>> ARTICLE
Jokes about fetishes and what I've become aside, this has been an incredibly fun series.

I think that the entire MonMusu franchise is legitimately incredibly entertaining, the manga is great as it is, but watching all those unique and fun characters and personalities come to life, with all their craziness and quirkiness and, has just been a massive treat.

It also didn't matter whether you prefer multiple legs or none, each of the girls was endearing and engaging by her own right. Darling is also one of my favorite harem MCs, he's got a really good head on him, and I really like how he accepts everyone without questioning, he's kind for the sake of kindness. I definitely wish a second season comes, sooner preferred over later, but until then I'll have the manga.

The only 10/10 of the entire season. I'm seriously going to miss the weekly discussions every Tuesday. Time to re-read the manga.

This was just a message from the producer.

Sorry for bad English but from [here](https://i.imgur.com/1T6yxMw.jpg) and [here](http://imgur.com/a/WWktd), this is what he said:

With that being said, but first, let's enjoy the special event coming on 11/15! Please use and send us a coupon included in 1st volume of DVD&BD limeted edition to get a event ticket!!"

I hope there will be 2nd season!
>> ARTICLE
I loved the second half of the episode. Seeing Monster Girls get accepted and appreciated by common folk was really refreshing and kinda heartwarming after seeing them get scolded and laughed at previously. Also, Darling realizing that Lala was just a chuuni because of his own past was hilarious.

Well, that was fun. No jokes, no irony, actually fun. Super enjoyable and varied characters, solid humor, actual exploration of an idea of living with monster girls, and some really touching (in every sense of the word) moments. I legit want season 2 now. And more Rachnera please!
>> ARTICLE
And thus ends the first adapted seasons of a modern masterpiece.

I'm so happy this got its own series, the world needed to be enlightened. Truly, this was a turning point for mankind, and i'm glad I was alive to witness it.

I doubt there will be a bester cast of best girls animated, or even a harem of this caliber in general, ever again.'

P.S. Don't forget to read the manga!

That cowboy music playing during Centorea's saddle riding was hilarious. This is why I like anime so much better than manga.

I don't know how you can claim Rachne is best girl when she would have allowed him to die (despite him not wanting to).

Suu's best girl and is low maintenance (no food requirements). And toxic Suu is best Suu. 

Overall a nice episode of Shokugeki no Darling. I hope there's more to come.

I can't believe I'm actually going to miss this show.

I'm really happy to see how much effort was put into this ep, a lot of the animation was just great, e.g. the chase scene, Cerea's Shokugeki no Soma moment, Suu's pokemon battle. Tons of love was put into this show, and it was an awesomely fun ride even if there are a lot of harems out there. Ah well, guess I'll have to keep reading the manga to hold me over... and also [T-Rex na Kanojo](http://bato.to/read/_/327526/t-rex-na-kanojo_ch1--v2-_by_raptor-scans).

This is going to sound weird, but this reminds of Akagami no Shirayuki-hime because both had finales that fired on all cylinders and wrapped things up despite having more content.

Can't believe they took Polt out of the river scene then put her in the endcard. RIP Hot Dog Buns.

Well, I  just wanted to day that this show has been a revelation as far as harems go. It is amazing to see people who normally don't watch ecchi or harem shows fall in love with this show because of the fun twist of the monster girls that feels very fresh. I am already an ecchi and harem fan but even for me, this show really does stand out. The comedy, the monster eroticism, the action, it was just so on point.

The animation studio Lerche deserved so much credit here considering just how unproven they are, yet they made one of the consistently well animated shows of the season. Everything has been so well done, whether it is the key shots (many of which was improved upon from the manga) or fight or comedy scene. Vocal performances  have been excellent too.

And of course, I  have to mention the amazing fandom for being so chill and fun to hang around with for this show. It has been a pleasure and I  hope season 2 is not too long into the future!

SEASON 2 OR RIOT

The first half of this episode had insanely fluid animation at the cost of some of the detail artwork.

The second half was pretty much the same but overall, this episode had quite a lot of differences in the art and animation department as compared to the previous ones. 

One would not expect the studio to do these kind of things in the finale.

As for the episode itself, I really liked it. They showed all the characters that appeared till now, the Lala skit was pretty fun as well as weird, in a fun way.

The second half showing the real "Everyday life with monster girls" was really good.

(It was probably because I was watching in 360p, but does anyone else think that the first few frames of animation in the beginning of this episode were a bit...unpolished?)

I can't believe its over. 

I told myself before that I would stray off from watching any ecchi/harem anime from now on and try to find real good shows that don't rely on tits and fanservice just for the sake of being "good".

But after seeing this show and Shimoneta this season, all I can say is: FUCK ALL I SAID BEFORE, THESE SHOWS ARE AMAZING.

I'm glad MonMusu is a really enjoyable harem show. Sure the ecchi and fanservice is there, but it doesn't take away from the main essence of the show. Like you could take away the fanservice, I would probably still like this anime. Because it has fun and well-established characters, a more likeable harem MC, and an interesting world and setting.

It's been fun guys. I hope we can get a season 2. :)

Man, it's been a long time since I was this entertained by an ecchi harem show. MonMusu is the only show where, even as the final episode closes out, I *still* can't decide who best girl is.

This show taught me a few things: I learned that I'm even *weirder* than I thought I was, and I thought I was really fucking weird. I also learned that 2D monster girls > 2D regular girls.

I'm going to miss it. I'm going to miss Darling-kun's constant near-death experiences. I'm going to miss all of the best girl posts. But most of all, I'm going to miss the weekly shitpost.

Wow, Lerche went all out this episode. The animation was on a completely different level than the rest of the show.  
Even outside of the visuals, there were so many great moments this week. Cerea's Shokugeki no Souma scene, Lala being chuuni and the subsequent flashback to Darling's past, poison Suu, it's all good. I'm sad that this show's ending, but at least we're going out on a high note.  
Overall, this was the surprise hit of the season. Before I started, I thought it would be just another trashy ecchi that catered to a very specific fetish, and wasn't planning to watch more than an episode or two. But I have seen the light, my brothers!  
Now to catch up on the manga, because I can't wait for a possible second season, I need my fix of monster girls NOW!

I'm definitely gonna have to try and read this now. Very few manga have I picked up after finishing the anime but this I feel deserves a read from me.

Will miss Tuesdays.

I really wanted Papi to be best girl, but Mia seems more like the real thing. 

Suu, Zombina, Manako, and Dullahan-san were pretty chill too.

Miia is the real thing.

I am patiently waiting for the Blu Ray release (   )

I gotta say, great episode. 

The animation quality felt leaps and bounds above other episodes, am I the only one in feeling this? Definitely felt like a considerable amount of the budget went towards this final episode and the proof is there. Hoping season 2 comes out now!

I hope there's a second season because [Manga Spoilers](/s "I'm pretty sure in the manga there's a chapter were all their mothers come over. Also, there's one where Rachnera's old host family try and win her back.") So they have some good material for a second season!
>> ARTICLE
Nooo!

I want more!

Also, the first half seemed to be exceptionally well animated.
>> ARTICLE
I liked Suu's interaction with Master in this episode. Lots of dialogue by Suu too! Loved it! 
>> ARTICLE
Overall, it was a fun watch.  Not a show I would want to buy to own but it was amusing, even if it there were heaps of times where I was laughing, thinking to myself "WTF am I watching" lol.  Can't really decide on a score for it yet considering Echi Harems are not my thing so it would be unfair to rate it low because I'm not the target audience.  It had solid animation, humor, etc buuuuut a show like Ranpo Kitan or Kekkai Sensen has tons more worth and stomps all over this show for me so I can't give it a rating in the neighborhood of those shows.....I'm conflicted....damn it!

EDIT:  Gave it 7 out of 10.  For me if I have to watch some echi harem and a choice, this show would pop up first.  The monster ladies made things interesting personality wise.

I had Slime Girl ERP with a girl buddy because of this show.

Excuse me if this is obvious, but Lala was the mystery letter writer, right? (Except for the MON team date, which its letter was done by a bored Doppel.)

now that you know this you will see it more (Yuri Kuma Arashi and Maria Holic use it often).

If it makes you feel better, that was mostly a joke. I mean, if you watch the show from the very beginning, it's *two minutes* until you see Miia having an orgasm... so I really doubt they're actually losing their "innocence," haha. :D

Holy shit!

They said Darling's name *twice* this episode!

Fuck this anime-original bullshit. They haven't said Darling's name in the manga since chapter one. I can't believe they'd depart from the source material like this. I'm dropping this and never looking back. I feel betrayed.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, my only issue is that they're not referring to him by different names now.

Manga, Miia calls him Darling, Centorea calls him Master, Mero calls him Sir, and Papi calls him Husband.
>> ARTICLE
wat?

Miia calls him "daarin" (darling), Centorea calls him "arujin" or "arujin-dono" (master/lord, think knights and lords, which is kind of Centorea's theme), Papi calls him "goshujin" (master yet again... this is actually how servers at maid cafes refer to customers), and Mero calls him "dan'na-sama" (lord/master/husband; quite formal).

It's hard to come up with single words that convey the differences... they can pretty much all be translated as "master", and they are all fanservice-y in one way or another.

Mero and Miia in particular are complete opposites... Miia speaks in a very informal manner, whereas Mero speaks in a very formal manner. That's where the whole thing about Mero being like royalty comes from.
>> ARTICLE
Technically Japanese is a bit similar to Spanish here in that several words can translate into the same meaning in other language given that they hold the same meaning. 

While master is an appropriate translation the overall theme of boss master and Lord with a tertiary connotation to husband or housekeeper are on the air on this work. 

Just look at the names of the girls, everything in the anime is a wordplay or pun up to the name of darling that is pretty much public figure or could be interpreted as the guy with a house. 

TLDR the Manga is puntastic and allows the translators to have fun with it given the natural amount of context that is already lost if you don't read Japanese.

If you drop it you won't see Suu's and Papi's magnificent scenes anymore.

Glad to see the guesses about combining Miia's shedding and Papi's egg-laying were right after all. If I were to guess, they'll probably pair MON with Sick Darling for the week after that, with a sneak peek at Rachnee with the director at the end, maybe even after the credits.

I'm the same, I got like 30 seconds into the first episode (knowing nothing about it beforehand)and was like "This is porn! This is fan service porn, in record time!" and turned it off.

But a few hours later I was like, "But I kinda sort of need to know where the fuck they were going with the snake-woman thing". And now here we are at guilty-pleasure o'clock.

The girls are pretty sweet and the MC isn't a huge pervert or a Yuuki Rito. The show seems pretty "realistic" in the way lots of these people react.

That gotta catch em all mentality. It's the "new pokemon" smell. We are too busy learning the behaviors of those MonMusu to worry about the trivial ecchi moments
>> ARTICLE
That's right kids. Mero is an NTR fetishist. 

Anyway, like a lot of people suspected, the molting got bumped up to be mixed with the egg laying. Best girl should make her appearance the episode after that. You think you've had the desires in the darkest corners of your heart stirred by this show? That's adorable. We're just getting started.
>> ARTICLE
She's interested in adultery more specifically
>> ARTICLE
Eh? But Suu was introduced last episode? Maybe you missed it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if "NTR" is the right term in this case. NTR usually involves the main character's loved one being *taken* from them; Mero just wants to be a mistress in a forbidden relationship~

>> ARTICLE
Yea i feel like the word NTR is being used too loosely. So let me clear things up for y'all vanilla lovers who have never gone to the deep end.

Cheating - porn where cheating occurs. The cheater could be the male or the female. This covers the largest area in terms of categories. Usually in this category, the person being cheated on does NOT play a big role (sometimes not even mentioned)

Cuckold - A special type of cheating porn that focuses on the humility of getting cheated on. The person being cheated on are usually tied up and forced to watch.

Netorare (NTR)- A general term used for porn where a loved one is seduced away from the MC. The loved one can be a girlfriend/boyfriend, but it can also be sisters, mothers, etc. This category can be sub divided into further categories:

NTR Type A - NTR where the girl is willing and enjoys cheating. The sex is consensual from beginning to end

NTR Type B - NTR that begins with rape/blackmail/etc, but the girl ends up liking it

NTR Type C - NTR that is non-consensual from start to finish

Voluntary NTR - NTR where the MC is actually the one who organized everything

Yuri NTR - NTR involving girls only

Reverse NTR - The guy is the one who gets seduced away from a girl (this is more rare)


Sources: VNDB

EDIT: BTW Mero doesn't have a cheating fetish. She has a tragedy fetish. She yearns for love that can never be (sort of like the little mermaid, NOT THE DISNEY VERSION, but the tragic tale published in 1837 where she turns into sea foam)

>> ARTICLE
So more of a cuckquean fetish.

The manga version I read translated this pun a bit more [deliberately.](http://i.imgur.com/VMuxEIO.jpg)

I don't know much Japanese, but I'm pretty sure the verb used there, "yareru" carries that sort of double meaning.
>> ARTICLE
well, the verb is yaru, one of a few ways in Japanese to say "to do" carrying the same double meaning as in English.

btw yareru is the potential form of yaru

It's very rare to see his name, he is just darling-kun.

Up next week: best Miia episode! A bit upset they combined it with Papi's stupid egg-laying episode--Miia's skin shedding is cute and adorable, but Papi's egg-laying was bizarre. But whatever, we get one of the best Miia chapters animated. Now we just need to have the chapter with Miia's mother to confirm for even the non-manga readers MiiaXDarling. But that's too far, it's after where the show would end :(

Good lord, that eight second prolonged shot of Suu 'drinking' from Centorea. EIGHT SECONDS.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Wait until the Dryad Girl shows up. Good lord.")
>> ARTICLE
Suu went from 0 to 100 really fast at the start. I've always liked her "assault" scenes, and watching them animated is nothing short of delicious.

I've been watching the color choices in the designs closely this episode, I can't shake the feeling that there's a "carpet matching the drapes" joke underneath the surface. I'm also impressed by the details of the character designs in general.

The real deal is going to be next episode though, aside from anime's best arachnid's imminent arrival either next week or the week after that, you don't know what a fetish is until you've witnessed what's to come.
>> ARTICLE
I stayed for the preview and was kinda sad to see they skipped [spoilers] (/s "The introduction to MON and the nursing chapter where Suu talks for the first time. But seeing how they're doing the shedding chapter after Mero's intro, I'm still hoping for the nursing chapter.")

Well anyways, looks like we're gonna start the Rachnera arc next episode, where we will also see another beautiful 'Darling Punch'. Brace yourselves, cause the true 'Monster Waifu Wars' will finally  begin in the next couple episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, MON's introduction is kinda important, so they'll likely same it for when its more relevant, like they're hopefully doing with the shedding scene.

With the amount of boobs the manga had, it had better be uncensored. 
>> ARTICLE
> She just has that youthful petit figure and a fantastic bubbly caretaker personality.

It's like you're going out of your way to not say loli.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, people tend to be in one of two camps on that. One is that Loli implies underage, one is that lolis just LOOK young. Papi is firmly in the second camp, if you want to call her a loli. She is the same age as the others.
>> ARTICLE
The issue with the first camp is you have all those BS characters that happen to look like they are 10 but are really 1500 years old (so it's OK to see their pantsu)

Mia shedding and papi egg episode next week. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, Mero arriving doesn't get me hyped.

However, I do look forward to the next episode.  Will be intriguing to see those animated.  And while I'm also looking forward to the introduction of [Character spoiler](/s "Rachnera"), I do really want to see Chapter 13 get animated, and since that takes place before their introduction, just not entirely sure when it's gonna fall.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't like the first half too much (except super lewd Suu), but the episode got pretty good with the second half with Miia being all super cute saying she loves fairy tales too and wants to be carried by her prince. Then it happened, she might have died, but it's okay Darling got to a cool guy again like how he just rolls with all the crazy stuff that happens. It's cool that Darling is getting used to all the danger, fan service, and dangerous fan service that happens on a regular basis, it makes him a more believable character. Anyway I should probably talk about Mero who has a good design and I wonder how her tragic love story is going to go.  
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but dehydrated Suu may have been more lewd than in the manga. Yay for shedding scene next week!
>> ARTICLE
Suu in her little bucket is adorable, the slime rape of the other three not-so-much...

This just just keeps getting more and more ridiculous *aaaand* we're getting shedding and egg laying next week, oh god.

Can someone thell me what kind of Monster  the dark skinned girl in the ending is?
>> ARTICLE
She's a Doppleganger. Basically, a shape-shifter.
>> ARTICLE
thank you :)
>> ARTICLE
No problem.
>> ARTICLE
She is actually much more than that, but I think the author prefer to keep her true identity a secret and don't explore further. Let's just say the words "Crawling" and "Chaos" are involved.
>> ARTICLE
I dont read the manga so its just a guess, but I think she transforms to other people and fucks shit up.
>> ARTICLE
Uhn nya
>> ARTICLE
Best monster girl still to be seen.

Oh, the shedding is next episode... Can't wait.

I knew they would not remove the shredding episode! YES, YES!

Monster musume aka have you seen how big my snake is aka birds of a feather diddle together aka dont look a gift horse in the vagina aka slime time aka flapping my flounder aka there's a spider in my pants aka poison cant penetrate plastic lips aka literally giving head aka.... too many fetishes to count
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know any manga or anime with monster girls in it just like this one or similar? Hooked on this genre now
>> ARTICLE
Hitomi infirmary, centaur no nayami, trex na kanojo are on the popular side of the cute spectrum. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh my, that yuri scene. [ ] (#deranosebleed)  
Awww, Miia's so cute when she's jealous.  
I forgot to do this last week, so here's my best girl hierarchy!  
Miia > Cerea > Smith > Papi = Suu > Mero
>> ARTICLE
The one thing I really enjoy about this show is the MC since he's got some interesting expressions. Also, because he's a prinny :P
>> ARTICLE
That's a deep indoor pool.
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, its 15 meters deep.

So yeah, it is a very deep indoor pool.
>> ARTICLE
On the 2nd floor?
>> ARTICLE
If Smith doesn't acknowledge Suu then Slime Rape Legal?  
>> ARTICLE
I like all of them, but for me Suu is best girl, and Papi is a close second. That made that Suu on Papi action all the better.

[](#prelenny)
>> ARTICLE
And Suu continues to keep that best girl spot! Oh the joys of monster girls getting slime raped.
>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
never thought id be so happy to see next weeks episode is shedding and eggs. i thought they were gonna skip that completely
>> ARTICLE
Yes,yes. It is Tuesday

This show know the borderline of Ecchi and H-Stuff. i am impressed
I love this Show


>> ARTICLE
This is a show that is ecchi that gets close to H, that is't borderline. Shinmai Maou no Testament. Now that is borderline.
>> ARTICLE
No, Shinmai Maou no Testament, is H for me. When they do this Pact with her, he touch her Boobies and she moan and more, later we see the succubus clean the Floor of some wet fluid...
So whoever had this idea to Flesh out this "love Pact" with her, had overdone it for me

Thats was to much H for me. Well perhaps we have different definition of this borderline

>> ARTICLE
You don't see any sexual intercourse going on at all. You know something happened and she came, 9 times I think, but you don't know what they did. That isn't H.

The way you put it just the knowledge of characters having sex implies it's H, ergo by your definition of H  [spoiler] (/s "Clannad") is also H since sex isn't implied but mention by one of the characters.

The fluid on the floor is to show us what the master needs to do in order to make the curse stop. They made a pack through a succubus. Did you expect anything less than her having orgasms? I was expecting more, like actually sex. The way they give you the info is indeed a crude way of doing it but it gets the message across pretty efficiently. 
>> ARTICLE
No penetration = no H. Thats my standards
>> ARTICLE
If it is implied that there is penetration, where do you stand there? Clearly it isn't, at least for me, or I see what's going on and it's H or it's implied, I don't see it, and it isn't.
>> ARTICLE
Thats a gray area for me.
>> ARTICLE
Let me give you the example of [spoiler] (/s "Clannad") again. Is  [spoiler] (/s "Clannad") a H because sex is implied? Actually it isn't implied  [spoiler] (/s "Nagisa") actually states that she did, in fact, have sex, I can't believe I forgot about that.
>> ARTICLE
Nah man, they just hold hands
>> ARTICLE
Oh boyyyy, next week is the egg laying episode. 
>> ARTICLE
And here I was thinking Miia was best girl....Suu you showed me the error of my beliefs,

>> ARTICLE
Favorite OP of the reason
>> ARTICLE
Well this weeks episode was . . . Interesting to say the least...
>> ARTICLE
I guess Mero is going to call him 'Master', too?

In the manga, she refers to him as Sir.
>> ARTICLE
Technically, Papi's 'goshujin', Centoria's 'aruji', and Mero's 'danna' can all mean 'master' and 'husband', but they're also totally different words because they have tertiary meanings.

'Goshujin' can also mean 'owner', 'aruji' can also mean 'lord', and 'danna' can also mean 'patron'. Whenever Papi, Centoria, and Mero refer to darling by their respective noun of choice, they're calling him all 3 meanings at once.

'Master' is not an inaccurate translation of what they're saying, but its lacking the intricacies of the word play. The manga's localization is straight up inaccurate, but it took liberties with the translation for the sake of better differentiating the characters.
>> ARTICLE
So, master, lord, dear?

>and 'danna' can also mean 'patron'. 

My favorite usage of this term is in Fate/Zero
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming you're attempting to go with words that are accurate whilst simultaneously keeping the the characters distinct.

Translating Papi's 'goshujin' into master isn't wrong, but the problem is Suu calls Darling "master" through Katakana. So you'd still end up with Papi and Suu sharing a noun for Darling.

In the context of what Mero is trying to communicate, 'Dear' would imply a too much intimacy. She used 'danna' because it not only acknowledges Darling as her 'master' but also serves to showcase the distance between her and Darling. She's reinforcing the idea that she will never be his wife because she imagines losing him while she's the tragic character, much like how a geisha will never be able to be close with her patron.

Damn near everything about her is supposed to communicate "I'm a tragic character", from her wheelchair to her maid outfit to the way she constantly fantasizes about tragedy. The manga translator gets pretty darn close through the use of 'dear sir', despite the fact that its not exactly accurate.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I like Papi's "Hubby", Cerea's "Master", and Mero's "Dear Sir"
>> ARTICLE
I believe there are subs that use the manga's localization instead.
>> ARTICLE
still adding girls to the Harem they should have skip this and just start the show with the guy living with all the girl...

Bluray version is uncensored, what aired on TV was censored it's pretty standard practice.

So you'll have to get the BDs.

Nope, and doubt anyone ever will. The resolution of the stream is only 704 x 392 to boot. Prison School has also had some limited uncensored releases on Nico Nico that has yet to be ripped and made publicly available either.

Well that burst my bubble.

Was also waiting for uncensored Triage X

Yeah the first 2 volumes of the Triage X BDs have been released but no rip for either yet... Similarly waiting for Shinmai Maou no Testament Volume 5 as well.

Where is the uncensored version from? Is it fan-edited or has a uncensored one actually been released?

As I said nico nico.

Not a fan edit, if you have a premium nico nico account (Japanese streaming service) they where showing the official uncensored for a limited time.

See? This is why I love Rachnera so much. She's probably the most empathetic, caring, and understanding of all the girls.
>> ARTICLE
Bingo.

If you pay attention, despite constantly tying people up and toying with them, she has never hurt anyone. Except the flashback part. She's incredibly aware that her hands are razor blades and her legs are almost as sharp. But she makes a huge effort not to hurt anyone, even as the other girls crush him, drown him, drop him from the air, etc.

Also very subtle, but her line "head wounds are no laughing matter" is a direct reference to how often the girls put Honey in mortal danger for the sake of comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
It's sad that the main reason she's so much more empathetic and caring is because of how harshly she's been treated and because of how self-aware she is of how easily she can hurt people.

I got the flu - where is my slimegirl nurse that brings me back to health? All I have is coughing, sneezing and pain everywhere...

But then again - judging by MC-kun taking a whole day to recover from his illness he probably had ebolacanceraids with a sprinkle of Black Death.  
Anything else would only survive seconds in his night invincible body.

^(I would still be willing to contract this for a few precious moments with a slimegirl nurse...)

Zombina is my kinda girl.

If we saw more of her, she could easily become best girl. Hell, pretty much every girl in this show has the potential of best girl.

Suu got her time to shine.. it's episodes like this that I wonder if she's best girl instead of Papi.

I mean, whoever you think best girl is... Suu can replicate her. That makes her "best girl"+ 

Yep. I think I will go with that. Suu wins.

I could never choose between Rachnera and Suu. This episode simply reaffirms that fact.

So, Rachnera doesn't take shit from anyone, is willing to kick some ass, and doesn't waltz around the issue. She's like Kouko, Marika and a spider hybrid. FUCKING AWESOME!

So as promised I watched this episode with my girlfriend.  [After our conversation last week] (https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3hgp9u/spoilers_monster_musume_no_iru_nichijou_episode_7/cu78rwp?context=3) this episode was going to be the turning point of being able to watch this.

THANK GOD the beginning half of this episode was soooo educational and just not much ecchi.  She actually enjoyed it but had to leave mid-episode for a confrence call.  Oh man the 2nd-half of the show was going to *DESTROY* me.  

Life worked out well and I love this show.  And my girl approves of it.  

**EDIT: BREAKING NEWS, NOW SHE WANTS TO WATCH THE 2ND HALF**
>> ARTICLE
I'm depending on you to deliver weekly reports now.
>> ARTICLE
God damn, the bullet you dodged. Though you should probably tell her that the series is over now, cause ecchi is just getting started now.
>> ARTICLE
That was a very good episode, especially at the end with how they presented Suu.

Although, two issues:

[](/s "Honestly, I expected Centorea's shouting to be more... shouting like. Louder and more frantic, especially with how she seems to scream it in the manga. It just seemed too reserved. And probably just me, but I think they should have included the line about Suu filtering her own water through her boobs.")

She gets a bit of development later on, I'm pretty sure. Not much, but it's there.

[Major Manga Spoilers](/s "If you think Mero was stuck on the backburner, wait for Lala. A good six chapter story arc leading up to her introduction, and then... nothing. She just pops in here and there and never really does anything. In fact, you know what, I think she shows up maybe three times between chapters 27 and 34.")

General opinion from manga readers is that she is ignorant of her own biology and thus got it wrong in her fantasy. For practical purposes, the author likely did that because it is impossible for the reader to identify a pregnant centaur.

...Nothing, really. Her only constant is that she expands in water, and she'll dilute and die if she takes on too much.

Edit: Also, she only tends to really talk when she's around MC-kun, and it's shown that it's more habit than anything. She can talk perfectly fine around others, but chooses not to.

Welp. Another Tuesday, another absolutely perfect episode of Monster Musume.

Like, the issues I have with this are the fucking stupidest shit. Like, I wish Rachnee and squeezed her fingers together like claws when she said she's not a crab. And sometimes Rachnee closed her main eyes, but her higher-up satellite eyes remain open. And Rachnee wasn't on the screen enough. And Rachnee didn't talk enough. And Rachnee is the greatest. That's not a criticism, it's just been on my mind a lot lately.

Cool things, though, I've been waiting a *long* time to see Rachnee in motion, and I loved watching her walk. They did the pattern of the leg movement right, which I was a little concerned for. I was worried about how Rachnee would be fit in to the nursing situation, but having her be the one to try to put a lid on it made sense. I love the sounds of her webs and legs moving. Of course, I also like the flapping noises of Papi's wings, and Miia's slither noises. But Rachnee is the greatest.

Some other stuff that was great, though, Cerea and Suu really knocked it out of the park today. Cerea sounded incredibly cute when she was prattling off about body temperature after forehead-touching Suuling-kun. And Suu's VA taking on everybody's voice mannerisms was incredible. They all sounded so different I sometimes couldn't tell if it was Suu's VA or not. 

Have to say, though, *seriously* disappointed about the gym chapter being cut. Hopefully it'll be an OVA or an extra or something at least, but Polt is actually secondary best girl, so it's a real shame we don't get too her wag her tail or twitch her ears... Dog girls are cute, you guys.
>> ARTICLE
I really want the rest of Smith's squad to get some move love. I believe they will, but it remains to be seen. Zombina is a treat, and Manako and Tionisha are adorable. I'm neutral about Doppel, but I'd be glad if they changed my opinion.

Suu shined this episode, and I always have fun seeing the relationships between Kimihito and the girls develop, and between the girls themselves as well.
>> ARTICLE
give it some time
>> ARTICLE
Nurse Miia is best Miia. 

Rachnera has taken #2 spot for me. She's definitely better than the others, just not better than Miia.... Yet. With the way this show is going I honestly have no idea who my favorite will be at the end

Hoping to see more of the Mon Squad again soon, Zombina is such a fun character!
>> ARTICLE
What do you enjoy so much about Miia? I find her annoying as fuck sometimes especially the way she says darling.
>> ARTICLE
She does her best though, even with all her childish behavior you genuinely see her try to improve herself and win MCs affections. Moreso then Papi or Meroune.

Pretty much my ideals right now. I'm still team Miia for the entirety though, you cannot say no to Nurse Miia.

Rachne demonstrating why she's Best Girl once again.

I've always been for Rachnera as best girl, but this episode has taught me the way of Suu. I still find Rachnera to be the most attractive, but I concede the title of best girl to Suu.

Rachnera is the best obviously, maybe because she reminds me of Quelaag (our Fair Lady).

I seriously hate the guy who's making fun of the monster girls all the time. I know its a way of showing how there are still humans that don't accept the monster people yet, but I still want that guy dead. Also that fake director. Screw those guys.

I really wish there's another friendly human in the series aside from Ms. Smith.

I don't remember Rachnera being in the sick chapter, but I liked how they just added her. Although I thought she might add something new in it, but it was just a few lines and didn't really change from the manga chapter. I thought they were also going to make her teach Suu something.

Also, Suu is cute as fuck.

1st half of the show was suppose to boost Rachneesan popularity but she probably got drowned by Suu in the 2nd half.

Also 4 times. 2 flashback, 1 middle card and 1 present. Darling has normal eyes. I swear those animators are getting lazy making Darling have those eyes.

I really do believe that the six girls are already infected...

By swirly eyes syndrome.

I got caught up on the manga in the past week and I'm kind of disappointed that Rachnee isn't in it more often. It seems like Mia, Cerea, and Papi get the bulk of the focus.

The voice acting was top-notch this episode, especially with Cerea and Suu's part. Fantastic episode.

I didn't laugh that much when reading the second half in the manga. But seeing it animated had me in tears.

I would have never believed that it would come to this but rachnera is truly best girl.

With spicy food, there's a very light sense of pain that somehow makes the experience more enjoyable. So it is with Rachnera; you're battling disgust and arousal at the same time, and somehow the combination just adds to the lasciviousness.

There is no reason why I should be liking this show as much as I do and developing a monster girl fetish. Oh god, what is wrong with me?

Miia ain't got no chill.

I guess this guy has learned nothing from the past 2 times he's shown up. I guess third time's the charm. Go Rachnera

As much as I believe Rachnera will forever be best girl, Suu did her thing coming to the rescue showcasing her 10/10 nursing skills and she can finally talk

Looks like we're starting the "D" arc next week.

Damn it! 

It's getting harder and harder to choose which girl to root for. Suu and Cerea were absolutely adorable in this episode yet Rachnera and Miia are as bold as always. This is becoming the first harem show I've ever seen where I can't decide on just one girl.

But we will be getting a demon girl in an episode or 2! Hold off for 2 more and we should get [Lilith](http://dailylifewithamonstergirl.wikia.com/wiki/Lilith) soon enough
>> ARTICLE
Damn... Lerche's rendition of Rachne is creeping the hell out of me especially when she's crawling on the wall, the ceiling and outside Darling-kun's window. That and add the camera works and panning. Freaking scary as fuck just straight from a horror movie.

But still... I fucking love it. My god... what is this conflicting feeling inside of me.

And my girl Suu has Miia beat. Breast fed slime fluids is the best for Darling-kun.

Here's hoping that we get to see Kii so the triumvirate of Papi, Suu, Kii will finally be completed.
>> ARTICLE
...I only just realized we don't have a VA or even a design for Kii.

I guess they'll be skipping her chapter entirely, same with Polt.
>> ARTICLE
Kii has already been confirmed
>> ARTICLE
The VA has been teased a lot, we even had a reddit post with a QA session with the VA of the D arc girls. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd love to see the other side of this show developed more with a more serious tone.  Something like the Patlabor movies or even You're Under Arrest.  They seem to kind of hint at it with the op and ed swapping last week.  Honestly, I think the monster squad seems to be a bit more interesting bunch of characters than the rest.
>> ARTICLE
Went from hating spiders to being attracted by them.
>> ARTICLE
Cerea was adorably cute this episode, she's a great character, I love how MC-kun patted her back when she felt all gloomy
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Cerea is adorable when she gets flustered. That scene when she kidnaps MC actually bumped her up a rank on my best girl hierarchy. The current ranking is Miia > Rachnera = Cerea > Papi > Suu > Mero.  
However, how the hell does [this] (http://i.imgur.com/aN3YoCX.jpg) work? If her vagina is on the horse part, then why would the baby gestate in the human part? Is her birth canal seriously that freaking long? Completely unrealistic, fucking dropped.  
Hey, turns out Suu is actually useful! It's good to see that every girl has their moment to shine. I sense a beautiful future for Darling-kun.

both suu and rachnea was 10/10 this episode really like both of them alot, not quite Papi best girl level but still

Rachnera best girl.
>> ARTICLE
Reminder that 2 mote weeks and we'll finally have best girl!
>> ARTICLE
So, the episode was amusing as always. But, unfortunately, the ecchi factor is all but dead for me. Every scene with Rachnera is composed of the cold, dark terror of the abyss staring back at you.

The few, precious moments of (   ) occurred when Suu was treating MC. But it couldn't last.

Good episode overall, but I'm really disappointed that they left out a pretty important scene with Mero at the end. 

Basically, while she's initially happy that Darling and Miia finally have their happy moment, she ends up starting to feel jealous (and perhaps that her "tragic love" scenario kind of sucks). 

For those of you who forget or just haven't read the manga, I'm talking about these two pages [here](http://i.imgur.com/fxzrbtU.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/YUV8eCO.jpg).

So last night 2 of my exes were over (one of which is engaged to my roommate even though we only broke up like 5 months ago) and my roommate (the engaged one) were chilling. I was feeling a little uncomfortable so I turned on MonMusu to scare everyone off.

They all got hooked.

Now they want to come over and watch this episode. And the series.

In regards to the episode, Miia continues to be my favorite girl while Suu X Papi is my favorite ship. This episode will be gif'd for quite awhile.

We need to know, who are their favorites?!

Ex who I am friends with - undecided.

Ex who is now engaged - Miia.

Here's is what I said over in r/MonsterMusume   
Great episode and the MGS references are timed perfectly because MGS5 comes out today. I knew about Solid Smiia, but I didn't know about Sniper Wolf Spider, that's awesome! The episode did have a bunch of generic sex or harem anime jokes, but it was still funny, the last one with Papi made me laugh. The date with Darling and Miia + Mero was cute and I really liked the part when Darling and Miia were alone, but the kiss being interrupted was super easy to call. Then after the Mero and Dolphin show, Miia left with a strange monster person which is dumb because Miia isn't supposed to leave without Darling and someone is trying to kill Darling. I didn't like how Miia was held down so easily, but maybe Draco is super strong, whatever Darling got to do a cool thing. It also turns out that Draco just wanted a friend even though she held Miia down and opened her shirt. For a second I thought Dragon lady was going to be added to Darling's harem when Darling started to be nice to her and we found out she is a girl, but I guess not. We did get a very cute moment of Darling giving Miia a necklace and Tio was pretty good this episode, I hope for more M.O.N. squad next week!

I loved Suu in this one so much! Perving out on Papi and Mero? Check. Metal Gear Solid box roleplay? Check. Helping girls with their silly plans? Check.

She was always in the thick of things and she always got what she wanted. I can't believe I'm falling for an adorable box.

Aww, they changed the costumes. In the Manga, the cosplayers were direct references to Touhou.

You can always count on Suu to make a situation much more lewd than it would normally be.  
I've said it before, but jealous Miia is the most adorable thing in existence. She almost got to kiss Darling too, but worst girl Mero just had to ruin it with her stupid fish trivia.  
Draco was surprisingly cute though. She just made the mistake of messing with the harem, which apparently unlocks Darling's secret ultra-badass mode.

Wait, I haven't seen the episode yet, but did they actually make Draco fly? Like up-up-and-away fly and not just glide? Cause if so that might be the first thing they've messed up.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it does show her lifting off from the ground, so... Not entirely sure, actually. I'm just probably getting the wrong implication.
>> ARTICLE
References are among my favorite things, mainly if they're done well, so even without ever touching any MGS related material my entire life, I laughed my heart out to the references in this episode.

I'm kind of upset by the kissblocking this episode, but kind of fine with it. I don't know, it's weird. In any case, a great episode, Miia is incredibly adorable, and Papi.. oh my.. Next episode is going to be a blast too, so I'm looking forward to that.

Interesting fact I noticed: the song Miia hums for two seconds at the very beginning of her date (starting right after the mid-episode commercial break) is [her own character song "Kiss Me Darling" from the Monmusu character CDs that are being released today in Japan \(09/02\).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeZA87zIICk)

>> ARTICLE
> I am constantly amazed how few fucks they give when naming these characters? Oh... you're a dragon? Draco it is!

Actually I feel that the fact that **every** character name (other than some sheep) is a pun on their species means that quite a few fucks were given coming up with them.
>> ARTICLE
> "I just wanted a friend... to grope" . I am constantly amazed how few fucks they give when naming these characters? Oh... you're a dragon? Draco it is!

Then you missed the joke entirely. She isn't really a Dragon, she is literally a "Draco". A gliding lizard, sometimes nicknamed a "flying dragon".

Am I the only one who's not really impressed with Miia as the MC's main love interest?

She arguable has the least character development of all the girls living with MC, and she was there first. Hell, Rachnera got more character depth in half an episode than Miia did in 9. So far the only thing we know about Miia is that she's super jealous, and that really isn't a quality that makes a character more likeable IMO. 

Almost all of the other girls have more interesting and complex character development.

She gets more development during the mom arc.

A few differences which I thought were worth mentioning, bare in mind that I'm working with a fan translation here between a manga and a voiced anime...

* [Rachnera is possessive!](http://2.p.mpcdn.net/351024/595929/34.jpg)

* [Rachnera makes the distinction between child and adult consequences for her.](http://2.p.mpcdn.net/351024/595929/36.jpg)

* [A segue from the dinner scene to the final scene](http://2.p.mpcdn.net/351024/595929/39.jpg), and showing that 'the spider is in the attic', which I thought was a little amusing.

* and then the ***[TOTALLY AND ENTIRELY NOT SAFE FOR WORK](http://2.p.mpcdn.net/351024/595929/40.jpg)*** final "interrogation" scene.

So, um, 'sister' in the anime, and um, 'that' in the manga (based on that translation. Caveat: fan translation can contain errors and language drift)

Also ~~FANSERVICE~~ bath episode (also ***NSFW [boobies]***) which would be at the start of this episode

[1](http://2.p.mpcdn.net/351024/595929/1.jpg)

Rachnera know how the World turn around, and she is the realistic Monster Female of all of them, but also She is an SM Mistress... and i mean a Full SM Mistress Professional

I did not know, that this Show could also have Hot Spicy Ecchiness and Humor in a beautiful Symbiosis

I assume English is not your first language. What you wrote is understandable, poetic even, but your choice of words could be slightly different. Here's a few suggestions, provided I interpreted your comment correctly. It's mostly little things like punctuation and grammar. Other than that, your vocabulary is wonderful. Keep up the good work.

> Part A: Like someone wrote Suu-Zilla!!!! Tears of laughing came out of my Eyes. Well done.

Part A: I like that someone wrote Suu-zilla! I cried tears of laughter. Well done.

> Warning!! The Solution to stole this Monster his Nutrients to get her little solution.. Well, it's like a Fresh Mother feeds her/His Newborn Baby (Yeah. Mind Pictures running!!)

Warning! The Solution to removing the monster's nutrients and making her smaller were... Well, like a mother breastfeeding her child. Yeah, picture that.

> Part B: Warning!! The Shoots of Monster Musume come very close to the borderline of Spicy Ecchiness and H Stuff, nearly crossing the line

Part B: Warning! Monster Musume come very close to crossing the border of Hot Spicy Ecchiness straight into hentai.

(I love your use of "Hot Spicy Ecchiness". Please use that phrase as much as you can.)

> But Part B give us Character Development of our Centaur female

Part B gave our female centaur more character development.

> Rachnera know how the World turn around, and she is the realistic Monster Female of all of them, but also She is an SM Mistress... and i mean a Full SM Mistress Professional

Rachnera knows how the world works, and she is the most realistic monster female of all of them, but she is also an SM mistress... and professional one at that.

> I did not know, that this Show could also have Hot Spicy Ecchiness and Humor in a beautiful Symbiosis

I did not know that this show could have Hot Spicy Ecchiness and humor in a beautiful symbiosis.

(I loved this comment, so I only changed it for punctuation and grammar.)

>> ARTICLE
>If it meant I could hang out with Zombina forever, I'd be down for that

I mean she is the best girl on the show so I'd want to hang out with her forever too.
>> ARTICLE
I would let Rachnera punish me like that anyday.
>> ARTICLE
Is Lillith supposed to be a succubus?  Is that a thing in Monster Girls?
>> ARTICLE
I'd assume that it would count.
>> ARTICLE
Rachnera was already the best girl, but now it's just cheating. 
>> ARTICLE
MC-kun is back to his old self! After he got barely hurt in the last episode in this one he got:  
- his stomach crushed by strong vines  
- his entire body smashed under two giantesses  
- hit by a sudden horse butt  
- his ankle twisted (as we all know, the most serious of anime injuries)

Also... Lilith-chan has dark skin - could this be a play on Black Lilith?
>> ARTICLE
Lol Suu eats all the vegetables with pleasure :D
>> ARTICLE
Best Girl 
>> ARTICLE
[Next episode!] (/s "MON Squad harem date! The 7th haremette approaches!")

Oh Lilith. Provoking Rachnera was not a good idea. XD Which reminds me. If the are only [2 more episodes left, excluding the next one...] (/s "Would there be enough time to introduce the monster milfs, Rachnera's previous owner, and/or Darling's secret to monster girl survival?") I really hope there is enough time for some of those events.

Also, that ~~cat girl~~ Polt cameo! 

Edit: Been forever since I had read her chapter.
>> ARTICLE
[Stitch time! 4 of Lilith, 2 of Kii, but only 1 of Papi booty and Rachnera :(](http://imgur.com/a/6MMMC)
>> ARTICLE
This anime is so random, I love it.
Also Young Turanga Leela should get more screentime, all of Mon should. Hopefully next episode we'll see more of them.
Poor Mia only got a couple of lines this time around.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone please put that final interrogation scene in to a video loop?

Please?

 [](#plz)
>> ARTICLE
More monster girls for your choosing!

Kii is absolutely adorable. Sucks that Papi has birdbrain and forgot about her.

RUN!! IT'S SUUZILLA!!

Centorea looks pretty badass in that armor.

No wait Polt! Come back! Guess they're saving her introduction for later or skipping it entirely.

Oh my looks like Lilith learned the hard way Rachnee ain't nothin to fuck with.

Next week, D is finally revealed.
>> ARTICLE
R...Rach-Neesan?!?
>> ARTICLE
If you don't like it, go and...umm.... suck a tree?

>> ARTICLE
>I'm keeping an eye on you.

Is that one of those things that only monoeye are allowed to say, and if a two-eye says it it's racist?
>> ARTICLE
No Miia this episode 0/10.  
But we got a Dryad and a Devil, which almost makes up for it. And that furry girl, although she didn't even do anything.  
Cerea can be ridiculously adorable when she gets embarrassed though. 
>> ARTICLE
Attack on Driad :3

At last we got some Polt. 
>> ARTICLE
Best date with best girls.  Suuzilla was awesome!
Also nice to see the kobold show up.

Next week's episode looks like it'll be excellent as well with a new character plus MON Squad.
>> ARTICLE
Date with M.O.N next week. Also Godzilla Suu was awesome! Also Dopple is definitely 100% Nyarlathotep.
>> ARTICLE
Cerea was great this episode
>> ARTICLE
Here is what I said over in r/MonsterMusume  
   
I guess we have a monster girl of week with monster girl dates format with two new girls this week, this might be a formulaic, but it makes things more actiony and energetic. Like how in this episode Suu cosplayed Godzilla and Darling had to tit suck a plant lady back into loli form. After that happened we had a really cool date with Centorea that showed romantic possibilities between her and Darling, I've only really seen that in Miia and Rachnera before. Speaking of Rachnera she was cool and had good insight this episode and then she "interrogated" Lilith which probably counts as kidnapping and other things, but Rachnera is good at avoiding trouble. The M.O.N. squad were good this episode and I love that we'll see more of them next episode.  
>> ARTICLE
I can't watch it yet my sister is here. Help
>> ARTICLE
first half was funny but kinda pointless. Darling-kun sucking that dryads boobs was kinda weird to add in my opinion and it was rushed. Enjoyed the second half though. Though we hardly got anything from Rachnera-san yet
>> ARTICLE
This is one of the few shows that has constant quality. And I fucking love it! 

2nd season when?
>> ARTICLE
dont mind me i just wanted to mention how this episode is going to surpass high art when the uncensored version is out
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna need someone to make a gif of Rachnee lowering the salt for the next "Best Girl" contest!
>> ARTICLE
Can't wait to watch this on a crowded train when I go to work today.

This and Overlord.
>> ARTICLE
Are we getting some of Darling-kun wooing Zombina next episode?  I think I remember a particular scene involving sewing.
>> ARTICLE
He woos everybody just by virtue of being a legitimately good person who likes to help and isn't afraid of the monsters just because they're different.

I'm not even joking. [](/s "Tio likes him because he just sees her as a really big girl, not to mention he can sew and adjust clothes so they fit her better. Zombina likes him because he's affected entirely by the fact that she's a she, and not because she's a walking corpse. And Manako likes him because he's kind and looks right at her, rather than slightly to the side like most people.")
>> ARTICLE
Mia isn't going to be happy when she hears about all this boob sucking.

God this episode really was on the H side...
>> ARTICLE
Gotta say I loved the Godzilla Homage. Was really faithful to the old movies, down to the film grain and even the pattern of Suu's hair!

Also god fucking dammit, I can no longer pretend that part of the reason I watch the anime isn't for the fan service, Rachenra is just too awesome.

No shame, no ragrets, beat off to fictional animated women
>> ARTICLE
Can't believe they actually had the Polt Cameo, I wasn't expecting it.
>> ARTICLE
Dryads are **HOT**
>> ARTICLE
I.....I...don't even know what I watched anymore but I liked it......Help
>> ARTICLE
Can your best girl turn into Godzilla? Suu can. 

Suu and Papi in the same episode make it harder to decide best girl.

Manako : "I'll keep an EYE on you". Get it? Because she only has one! Hilarious.

Centorea being inconvenient (not fitting doors) and insecure about it. Like always. 

I'd say... Rachnera doesn't even need Honey anymore. She has Lilith now. The ship has sailed. 

Next Episode : The girl who often looses her head [](/s "Literally")
>> ARTICLE
No, she can't but DID YOU SEE HER ARMOR???
>> ARTICLE
Suu came to the rescue twice this episode

For someone who's supposed to be a child, she's got really wide hips.

>> ARTICLE
On one hand, I'm glad to at least see a cameo by Polt, but on the other it feels like a slight kick in the nuts that they're skipping her chapter and just tossing her in as a cameo. 

Still, it's possible we're going to [see her](/s "in the food/shopping chapter which is now most likely going to act as the season's ending"). Probably they'll change it slightly to have her introduce herself there and use the gym as an OVA or even second season material. 

We're gonna have a good long wait on our hands to find out about that, [aren't we?](http://i.imgur.com/aEuIwwR.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Well while the laser wasn't in the manga, I like the touch they did with Suu-zilla. Yes boys and girls, this episode is gonna be fantastic when BD ship. I loved how they cameo'd Polt the Kobold a few times (she was the jogging almost dog looking girl) but we still shouldve gotten a proper intro for her. If not the shopping episode we probably will get for her intro, most likely next season with [manga spoiler](/s "the family visit arc. They may use that as an easy segue into Cerea vs her mother in the joust.") Not enough Miia but Rachnee showing off her dominatrix side with Lilith was nice. I hope they make Miia's reaction to Lala cute like it was in the [manga](/s "audio of her passing out could be adorable if they do it right")

Poor Zombina.

>> ARTICLE
...Okay, the mouth-laser was not in the comic. Not complaining, though.

Nice to see Polt, [](/s "One of the more common recurring characters"), even if we skipped her introductory chapter.
>> ARTICLE
This season is great. Especialy if you are a ~~pervert~~ sex connoisseur. 

Prison school, shimoneta, Bikini Warriors, My Wife is the Student Council President and obviously Monster Musume.

edit: added clarification

T'was the season of ecchi.

We are sex connoisseurs!

Someone should do a Manga/Anime comparison..for science.

Here's hoping that the Plot cameo today means we night get her into this season after all! 

Also suu-zilla was god teir awesome and funny!

How can one anime have so many best girls at once

I know. I can't choose between Manako, Zombina, Papi, Centorea, and Rachnera, Kii, Draco, and Next week's girl.
>> ARTICLE
THEY SEVERELY CUT DOWN ON THE BEST PART
>> ARTICLE
Best Part?
>> ARTICLE
the one where he sucks on the dryads breasts, it's way better in the manga
>> ARTICLE
I'm wondering if you guys think Rachnera would be considered Yandere? 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely not.

Yanderes are nutso and incredibly violent. Rachnee likes to tie people up, but it's never out-right malicious.

Definitely worth noting, she's got razor-sharp claws, and could kill a human very easily, but she shows tons of physical restraint and is the only girl who has never actually hurt MC-kun. She loves to tease, but she'd never hurt him, even on accident.

Goddamn it's been I a while since I've read the manga, and even with only 3 minutes of screen time I'm reminded of why I love Rachnera so much.

Do not call Darling by his slave name
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, after an entire season of "Darling," "Honey," and "Master," I forgot his real name until today from the comment by u/XLauncher.
>> ARTICLE
Legit didn't know he had one until reading that, I thought it was a subtle running joke that he has no actual name given by the author. Has he been called Kimihito even once?
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 1. From Ms. Smith by his full name.

That's the only one I could remember.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. They even reference it in the manga. 

"Do you even know Master's real name?"

"Uh..." *collective blank faces*
>> ARTICLE
My favorite gag based on this is Smith naming him Darling-kun in her phone contacts.

All these sexy monster girls and I keep thinking to myself how darling is such a babe.

I'm pretty sure most studios uncensor shows when putting them on DVD and BluRay.

Because don't kid yourself, series is getting super popular and if we all aren't just being meta about MonMusu we are probably going to make BD sales skyrocket.
>> ARTICLE
But there's not nearly enough source material right now. We're up to 25ish in the anime but there's only 36 chapters so far.

Hopes = Crushed. 

Saving my money for the Next seasons BD's (whenever they do season 2 then release those BD's) = Begun

I will be patient. My fakku stories/fanfics will suffice until then.

So we only need about a year and half more manga chapters for a second season! That means at least a two year wait for any second season...

Another near perfect adaptation. 10/10 episode. Also another Polt cameo! Woo!

I'm really sad that next week is the last episode. Unless they skip a chapter, we're going to miss out on the last Rachnee focused episode before the parents arc, and that makes me sad. From the preview I honestly have no idea what they're planning, but I'm guessing they're going to keep finish the Lala arc, which means the second half is going to be one of two chapters. Either an almost filler chapter that has a lot of character development (and we get to see Toxic Suu), or we get the Rachnera focused one which ends with the perfect setup to a second season.

Oh well, it's been an awesome ride and I'm so glad they adapted it.

I'd like to remind everyone that Lala's VA is Ai Kakuma. 

She's voiced Sento from Amagi Brilliant Park and Chamo from Rokka no Yuusha. What a range, right?

For some reason I like the black sclera Doppel and Lala have. Anyone else?
>> ARTICLE
It fits with the whole supernatural, other-worldly thing the two of them have going on. God of Death and Lovecraftian shapeshifter aren't exactly "down to Earth" after all.
>> ARTICLE
Here is what I said over in r/MonsterMusume   
   
I'm glad that we got to see M.O.N. outside of work, but we really didn't see a lot of Doppel, at least the mystery was mostly cleared up. We did see a really cute scene with Tio, it reminded of Miia in episode 1, Zombina is cool, and her boob falling off was hilarious. What Manako said about people not being able to look at her was interesting because I had a hard looking at one eyed anime girls because the Monster Infirmary cover creeped me out. Reading it helped and now I think anime Leelas are cute. Darling was pretty cool too being helpful with sewing and treating them like normal girls made them feel real good. Then Leela appeared and Darling finally got some head, but he almost got arrested because it was in a public place. Anyway I liked that scene despite all the bad touching and I do like Leela, I'm just not sure how to feel about her personality, maybe I'll decide next episode. Too bad next episode is the season finale and I'm caught up with the manga, I need more monster girls.

My guess is Dullahan girl will become a part of the harem.

Tio could max all my credit cards if it meant I could take her shopping.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't understand how people can honestly choose just one best girl.  I don't think I've had more trouble choosing than in this series.  I can maybe narrow it down to the best two which is definitely Zombina-chan and Papi.  But even then I would still have Miia and Tio highly ranked as well.  And Suu....  I mean seriously, come on!  Just one?  No can do.

The lack of Zombina, Dopple and Rach-nee in your struggle for best girl is **NOT** understandable!

Ai Kakuma. She's voiced Sento from Amaburi, Chamo from Rokka, Est from Bladedance, and Mayumi (childhood friend) from Shokugeki no Soma.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the MON squad dates. The three girls are adorable, with Zombina being my favorite. Almost fell in love here. We're also getting the Dullahan, which is a pleasure. Her cute side was pretty damn adorable too. Her more erotic moments were, uhh.. delicious. Such a shame it's ending next week.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how they're going to set up the last episode. Will it still cover 2 episodes or will they stretch out the next chapter as a finale?
>> ARTICLE
Wouldn't it be really great if Lala is voiced by Sawashiro Miyuki? :D

I was thinking the same thing. Her voice would be perfect for Lala's Chunni moments. But who they have makes normal Lala sound so adorable

I never liked Lala before, but now that we got a voice for that ridiculous Chuuni behavior, she kind of grew on me. But in the end, she's nothing but rape material for best girl Suu and Arachne.

Lala is pretty cool, but Celty will always be best dullahan.

Also, is it strange that Manako is actually the one that weirds me out the most? I'm fine with spider legs, snake tails, wings for arms, severed heads and all that, but there's something about having one giant eye I just can't get over. I guess "normal" faces are really important psychologically.

1. Who the heck is downvoting everything?

2. Not a fan of them all just referring to him as Boyfriend-chan. They all referred to him as something different in the manga, and their little pet-names suited them a bit better than just 'Boyfriend-chan'.

3. Hello Polt, hello Racists, hello Police Guy.

4. This is probably the most we're actually going to see of Lala. For whatever reason, they had a big multi-chapter story-arc leading up to her introduction, and then she just kinda got put on the back-burner. Hell, she only makes one actual appearance beyond Chapter 30.
>> ARTICLE
> Not a fan of them all just referring to him as Boyfriend-chan. They all referred to him as something different in the manga, and their little pet-names suited them a bit better than just 'Boyfriend-chan'.

To be fair, since his actual name is "Kurisu," it kind of sounds like "Kareshi" which means "boyfriend" in Japanese. It's pretty much the same for other girls whose names are puns for their respective species (Rachne from Arachnoids, Miia for Lamias, Papi for Harpies, etc.)

Edit: Forgot to mention that the MON squad girls have been calling him "Kurisu-san" throughout the dates.

My fellow cow(girl)-lover. Cathyl really did get the short stick there, only one of the original species to only get one page, and then only one to not be a main character in the manga (and not even as a secondary character, a minor character that shows up for half a chapter).
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, her scene is one of the best ones for me. But yeah, dunno why she isn't that popular, considering cowgirls are... well pretty popular too.
>> ARTICLE
*coughcough* [New Cathyl information here](/r/MonsterMusume/comments/3l93i9/cathyl_merino_cott_and_tons_secrets_english/) *coughcough*

shameless self promotion :D
>> ARTICLE
If I had to guess it would be *because* cowgirls are pretty popular. They're probably the third most common animalgirl design (after cat/dog/foxgirls and bunnygirls) in media (I'm including characters that wear animal-ear hairbands). So Okayado (the creator) probably didn't think he had enough new jokes that hadn't been done a hundred times already to make her a recurring character.
>> ARTICLE
Probably, but the way he handled her, for example was pretty great. Huge, bulking, hard working,temperamental, and well voluptuous characters are not that common. Dunno, feels like the way he handled her was pretty great, would have been awesome to have her as a character.

This has been on my watch list for awhile now. I may try to get in on this. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched it when it first came out, and only remember it being great, not much of what actually happens, however. I keep putting it off because of length, saying, 'Oh, I'll just watch this short series first to get it out of the way, then I'll get to Monster. Actually, this other short series first as well, you know, just to get it out of the way.' 


I have been getting short series 'out of the way' for years now! Finally an excuse to watch this now.
>> ARTICLE
Finished this about 2 or so months ago, and you've been missing out! This is not only one of the best anime, but one of the best TV shows in general. Let's hope that this rewatch pulls Monster off of your "To Watch"  and on to your "completed".

Nice. Something to push me through this.

I'm all up for the re-watch but can't we do like one episode per day ? Although that's just me, majority vote wins though and I'll watch it any which way the group does.
>> ARTICLE
We could do that,  but for one thing it would take longer.  Another thing is I don't want to flood /r/anime.  It also gives viewers a bit more leeway on when they want to watch. For example,  someone may not be able to watch one on a day because something is due the next day,  but are able to watch multiple the next day.  It just gives more freedom for the viewer,  being able to watch on a two day rotation. 

Also,  people may not be able to contain themselves watching one at a time :P
>> ARTICLE
People who want to binge-watch will do it irregardless of how the group watches, can't stop that. Why not put up a straw poll thingy and have the people decide ?  
  
I only say this cause the NGE group-watch was the first one I did and I liked the way they did it. Gives each episode a thread of it's own and you don't have to watch a lot.
>> ARTICLE
I'll make a straw poll and put it up a day before. So would the options be my schedule and then 1/day, or what would you suggest?

I like my schedule, but I'm definitely open to changing it if other people want a different schedule.

Also, NGE is different than Monster in that its like a third as long. What works for 25 episode shows may not work for 74 episode shows.

Choice 1 - Episode/day  
Choice 2 - What you originally planned/suggested

Tfw I finished 3 weeks ago... oh well will definetely check up on these threads for some good discussion.
>> ARTICLE
episode 57
>> ARTICLE
I'm on episode 65
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Sunday...
>> ARTICLE
So this rewatch means we watch it at our place and comment on discussion thread?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's generally how rewatches work... unless you want us to meet up somewhere to watch it haha.
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
Was this announced before?

Also could you add dates?
>> ARTICLE
It was announced like three weeks ago. And yeah, good idea.
>> ARTICLE
Cool, I've never been apart of a re-watch. I'M APART OF SOMETHING MA'! (This will be my first time viewing though, so be gentle.)
>> ARTICLE
It's all good, this is most peoples first time viewing it too :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm in. I hear great things about it 
>> ARTICLE
The first few episodes are slightly slow and boring(imo), but it gets better and better the deeper you go. Don't give up!
>> ARTICLE
Count me in dude
>> ARTICLE
Yay! Monster has been on my watch list for a while now, let's do this thing!
>> ARTICLE
Gives me a reason to rewatch this masterpiece. It's remained in my top 5 favorite anime even after a few years of finishing it.
>> ARTICLE
I literally just started watching this the other day for the first time! 
>> ARTICLE
We watching sub or dub? 

Let's all agree to use spoiler tags so we can get good discussion day to day without holding back. Honestly tho.... excited as hell for this!

Munch munch, chomp chomp, gobble gobble... gulp.
>> ARTICLE
That last linee
>> ARTICLE
I'm hoping everyone uses spoiler tags well.. not looking to delve into such a long series for someone to ruin it half way through.
>> ARTICLE
Viewers can watch either sub or dub. It shouldn't affect discussion at all. Personally, I'm going to watch the dub because I've already seen the sub. 

And yes, I'll be sure to enforce spoiler tags. I'm super excited too :D
>> ARTICLE
Dub is pretty good. No complaints really.
>> ARTICLE
Do you know if there's a version of the dub out there that *doesn't* have the soundtrack replaced for the first 20 or so episodes? The main thing that keeps me from watching the dub is knowing that they swapped out the soundtrack for the first chunk of episodes on the North American DVD release for a far inferior version. I'd love to give the dub a try, but only if it has the original soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
My only complaint is that his voice wasn't as good as his sub voice. 
>> ARTICLE
His? Tenma?
>> ARTICLE
Johan, I think Tenma's was alright
>> ARTICLE
I actually liked Keith Silverstein's voice more than the Japanese dub. 
>> ARTICLE
I remember it sounding weird when I started the show. Now I quite like it. It's somewhat creepy unnatural sound. Suits him.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen up to episode 24 dubbed and can say it's pretty solid. Could be better but can't most dubs?
>> ARTICLE
I'm in
>> ARTICLE
Finally something to motivate me to watch the entire thing! Excited!
>> ARTICLE
I'm down for this. Got to around halfway the first time; loved it, but then moved house and stalled out as a result.

2-3 episodes sounds good, any less and we'd be here until the end of time. Nice anime selection, OP!
>> ARTICLE
It is planned to be every other day.  I'm afraid participation would drop if it was 2-3 per day 
>> ARTICLE
Where to watch thou?
>> ARTICLE
I started watching this a while ago but temporarily stopped because I was busy, I'm on episode 40 and I'd say I've really enjoyed the show so far! I didn't love the art style but got used to it, a little slow here and there but the pacing itself isn't bad. I was on the edge of my seat several times. So far a 9/10, if the ending is great it'll be a 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, you gonna start over or just continue when we catch up?

And yeah, the ending is great. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I'll rewatch all 40 episodes, but I will rewatch my favorite parts and pick back up where I left off when the group reaches it. Can't wait to see how it all ends too.
>> ARTICLE
Hhhnnggg, my favorite anime of all time. It's gonna be hella difficult to stick with the schedule.
>> ARTICLE
Hehe, will definitely be tough once we get into it.
>> ARTICLE
May 9th? That's my birthday! Maybe I should join this then...
>> ARTICLE
Man, I'm in the middle of watching this show right now.

So far, Inspector Lunge is my favorite character. He's just such an entertaining character to watch whenever he's on screen.
>> ARTICLE
Right on time. I was going to watch this today. Good thing I check reddit before watching anime.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely going to tag along for this. Heard great things about this show.
>> ARTICLE
So where do I legally watch this in 360p or whatever the standard for this is, since I tried to watch this when I was new but didn't stick with it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not aware of any legal stream of it.
>> ARTICLE
I AM DOWN FOR THIS! Also, do you recommend subbed or dubbed?
>> ARTICLE
I've only watched it subbed (this rewatch I'm watching dubbed though). I have heard that the Monster dub is really good though, one of the best dubs out there.
>> ARTICLE
I'll probably won't be able to keep up the schedule, but I'll give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
Do you have a better schedule suggestion?
>> ARTICLE
Sounds fun.
>> ARTICLE
Good, I've interested in this for a while. The length is still a bit off  putting but knowing it's not a shonen, it should be fine.

And to add to the discussion on the schedule - I like it the way it is. If I don't feel like watching an episode one day, I can just catch up the next day. Though I would probably stick with 2 episodes per 2 days for the entire duration of the rewatch, since I would like to watch/do another things during the rewatch (the truth is, I started playing Cities: Skylines and it's eating up all my free time...).
>> ARTICLE
Nice. First time viewer here. Excitement!
>> ARTICLE
RemindMe! 6 days
>> ARTICLE
Been wanting to watch this for a while, the episode count is a little scary since I keep it 26 max usually and have trouble finishing those ones even. Will try to keep up!
>> ARTICLE
How can one watch (preferably legally) this show?
>> ARTICLE
I watched the whole thing on YouTube a couple of months ago. All of the videos still appear to be available and both the sub & dub are there.
>> ARTICLE
Monster isn't available on any streaming website so you'll have to sail the seas.
>> ARTICLE
This is by far the biggest downside I've had so far living on campus. If caught sailing they give me a fine. :(
>> ARTICLE
Look up Peer Block, it keeps people from looking at what you're uploading or downloading, it's what my friend uses. But you should still be cautious.
>> ARTICLE
There is a reliable, safe website that has the sub and dub. According to what a mod once told me, I'm only not allowed to say the *name* of the site. To put it bluntly, if you type in Watch Anime Online on Google, the website in question is always the very first result. Use the search on that site and you're good to go. I use it for anything that's not available legally, it's always been 100% reliable with no issues.
>> ARTICLE
Ooh, I'm gonna like seeing people's theories while they watch
>> ARTICLE
I think I'll actually join you guys in this. I watched monster to around episode 30 and just dropped it. It wasn't horrible and I could tell it was going to get good but things came up in life and I had other things to do. When I tried to go back I pretty much forgot everything. Perfect time to watch this series now. Look forward to it!
>> ARTICLE
Ok, this time im going to watch past 10 episodes. I keep starting this anime then dropping it. I hope this time I can get into it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so in-its been on my watch list for quite awhile :)
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad I'm not the only one! This is definitely incentive to start watching and join in on the discussion fun!

>> ARTICLE
Have been on episode 24 for about 3 months now. Can't wait to start watching again.
>> ARTICLE
Do you recommend subs or dubs?

If I can find subs, that is.

edit: nevermind, I actually found the dual audio version
>> ARTICLE
I've only watched with subs,  but I'll be watching with dubs this time.  I've heard the dub for monster is fantastic, so hopefully that's true. 
>> ARTICLE
Glad this is happening. More people need to watch this awesome show.
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching this (first time). Already watched 48 episodes...
>> ARTICLE
The Manga is basically my favorite thing ever but I never bothered to watch the anime because it just felt redundant. Its been a few years since I've read so this rewatch seems to be just what I'm looking for. 
>> ARTICLE
Yay =D
>> ARTICLE
YEES. I need inspiration to actually finish watching this. It's so slow and I'm a little more than a third of the way done. Thank you for doing this.
>> ARTICLE
Sweet.  I'm down to knock this one out with the sub!

Had this in my list for a while now and I finally have a reason to watch it. It's perfect to since everything in school is done after this week for me. Good scheduling op
>> ARTICLE
I've had Monster on hold for quite some time, so maybe I'll join you guys on this.
>> ARTICLE
Hurrah my favorite anime! I won't re-watch it but ill definitely post my perspective of the show without spoiling, maybe adding a quick recap of the episode for the veterans who have already seen the episode know what they can comment on? D.w about it if its too much work. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll see what I can do =) 
>> ARTICLE
Yessss, my favorite anime is finally getting its time in the spotlight.

So... Dub or sub? :)

The dub is pretty good.

Thanks for mentioning the censoring. I found it to be one of the best jobs I've seen, mainly because looking at some of the uncensored scenes vs the regular television version, there's very little that's fundamentally different with the scene, it's mainly an effect of having a different crop, which makes the TV-air version seem virtually free of overt censoring.
>> ARTICLE
higi!

I think it was me from my "Should You Watch It?" thread, but I did not double-check simply because I liked the wording here for the review and did not want to change it simply because I mirrored my past self. :3

> groovy word choice man

You know me, I am always looking for some slick new words, which is why I daily follow the "Word of the Day" to expand my lexicon!

> feeling a bit miffed at a different show there banjo?

If we are talking about Charlotte, that is my next review (I am currently writing it). I cannot tell where people sit with this one -- meaning if the majority find it good or bad -- so the conclusion I come to should prove interesting and debatable! :3

> Thanks for mentioning the censoring.

No problem!

I agree, MM fought the good fight and brought us some sexy material without completely voiding its on-screen proceedings. I would not necessarily call it great to see -- since having *no* censoring whatsoever would be the optimal situation -- but they reduced it to the point that it was hardly noticeable except in very specific areas (e.g. Papi landing on top of Darling during the full moon with the shot of her crotch darkened completely).

Thanks for commenting as usual, higi! :)
>> ARTICLE
>I liked the wording here for the review and did not want to change

tsk tsk banjo, I expect more of you ^^/s

>Bodacious

actually, I was referring to how it seemed like you were channeling the 80's (hence: *groovy* word choice)

about charlotte. I personally didn't go into the final episode thread, but judging by rash of negative threads about it, I think it would be safe to say that not too many people enjoyed the finale.

Well, if we were in a perfect world, censoring wouldn't have to a fight, but given the realities of it's situation, MM did well. Actually now that I think about it, I think the main overtly noticeable scenes were mainly papi crotch-shots. I guess that could be something to note about where her main sexual appeal comes from. (I'm not a fan of papi, so I'm not sure about this)
>> ARTICLE
> tsk tsk banjo, I expect more of you

Ha!

> actually, I was referring to how it seemed like you were channeling the 80's (hence: groovy word choice)

Ahh!

I just like that word, "bodacious." Plus, since I (normally) like to mix up my word choice, and given the context of the anime, it seemed like the perfect fit!

> ...I think it would be safe to say that not too many people enjoyed the finale.

Hopefully my thread will hold lively discussion of the same sort! :3

> I guess that could be something to note about where her main sexual appeal comes from.

That is an interesting point!

Papi acts like a dolt and is unbelievably carefree, which is part of the appeal. More than likely she is aimed at the "loli" crowd given her stature and "I look like a kid but I am actually 100 years old."

As for if her crotch is her main sexual appeal, as I say in my review, for all of the monster girls it is "the inside that counts," so I think it is more of her personality that is attractive as opposed to something like her chicken wings. :P

*An eight out of ten show rated by Banjo the critic? Even an ecchi one?*

[**surprise**](#banjoisahellofadrug)

Anyway, it was interesting that one could actually put Monmusu into long passages, hehe. Honestly, I would just recommend someone to watch it to spike their curiosity and hopefully gain a new set of fetishes. The show is really enjoyable - I thought I would be really weird out by Monmusu. I kind of hope a season two is in place, and there's still manga so I'll be catching up from there.

So, why do you choose snek as best girl? Why not Papi? :v
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Banjo usually likes Ecchi shows. They're just rarely done well is all. 
>> ARTICLE
funti, my friend.

> An eight out of ten show rated by Banjo the critic? Even an ecchi one?

Ha!

At the end of the day, it is all about execution. And as an "ecchi," comedic harem, MM executes all of its elements quite well with only a handful of issues to speak of. For that, I give it a high grade.

Looking at my own scores, this is now perhaps my favorite harem anime of all-time, and I would not have it any other way. :3

> Anyway, it was interesting that one could actually put Monmusu into long passages, hehe.

Hence why I am a critic! :P

> ...I thought I would be really weird out by Monmusu.

What I love about anime is just how stupid it can get. MM is really ridiculous; if I walked up to my father and said, "Want to watch as a slime girl tentacle-gropes a headless, blue-skinned woman?" he would ponder why he ever had me born in the first place. So going into this one, I was eager to see this new-but-not-really side to anime.

Obviously it did not disappoint!

> So, why do you choose snek as best girl? Why not Papi? :v

Papi is a boatload of fun, but Miia is the most attractive to me, personality- and body-wise. So she beats out Papi and everyone else.

Here is my (the official!) list of Best Monster Girls:

Miia > Lala > Centorea > Rachnera > Suu > Papi > Lorelei

Any other order is simply wrong. ;)

[finally](#rickastatic)

Being as when I found the manga for this it became a fast favorite of mine, the anime does get a little bias from me. The fact that only slight little things were cut or shuffled around from the manga into this adaptation is amazing. For the first few episodes, it was nearly a panel for panel animation. What stopped this from being 10/10 for me as a fan of the series (again biased), was the stuff that was cut. A character who ends up being pretty damn important gets reduced to a cameo role with only minor effects as the extend of her voicing, the Kobold, Polt. She holds the title of the most fun monster girl to be around, the one you would really wanna be with, that is not part of the harem. While I understand why the animators decided to do this, and it kinda helps bring to mind that throwing her in was a tease at a possible season 2, it does kinda hurt.

The fact that they kept the mannerisms of the girls based on their respective myths is fantastic. Lamias being known for their raw sexuality is demonstrated from the first scene in the show. [Spoiler from manga](/s "If they do a second season, this will be even more reinforced during the Parent Visit arc when Mama Miia (yesss I had to make that (and the other one now) pun) comes into town. Here you even learn the reasoning behind Miia becoming an ambassador through the Cultural Exchange Program") Hell, the only one who doesn't embody the first thing you think of when you hear their species, is the monoeye Manako. When people first hear monoeye they think of cyclops, but she isn't a cyclops, she's a regular monoeye. The little blurbs at the end of each episode of the various species and their subspecies was an amazing touch. All of it was an interesting read and really fleshed out how important being themselves was to each of the girls. 

Kimihito, or Darling-kun if you prefer, being so bland and, god forbid this ever happens in anime, **normal** is an absolute necessity to have the series work. If he was some super popular guy that had every girl wanting him.... okay less than he is now, it would take away from everyone else. He is so normal in fact, it helps him stand out from the rest of the cast. The only other notable humans, Smith-san and the racist couple who get caught in the truck explosion in the final episode's chase scene. All 3 of these people have their eccentricities that give them character. Kimihito with some quirk of his own would make him just blend in with the crowd. 

God I could go on and on about what this show did right and how each detail really plays a major role in how the story progresses and affects character interactions. Yes this is ecchi for the sake of being ecchi in a comedic way, but the writers were smart. Little details not a lot of people could get without really thinking about why things were done this way or that way really prove how much research was done on the separate species themselves. Hell I am almost considering doing a couple write ups on how each character pretty much exemplifies the stereotypes of their monster species, because when you look into that, you see how close to the source these girls get. Now we wait for season 2...

[](#miiatears)
>> ARTICLE
I never actually liked Polt. Did she any sort of relevance in the manga? I can't recall. I just remember going "ehhh" everytime she appeared. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. There were a couple scenes (mainly the gym scene) that got cut with Polt's removal. She gets more important in the scenes after where the anime stopped adapting
>> ARTICLE
You mind tagging what makes her important or at least mentioning the relevant chapters? I don't really have the time for a full reread.
>> ARTICLE
Chapters 17 and 29 are the ones I remember. Bout to go to class but those are the ones that I know Polt is important
>> ARTICLE
Nitro with the mega comment!

> A character who ends up being pretty damn important gets reduced to a cameo role with only minor effects as the extend of her voicing, the Kobold, Polt.

I heard about this, something about a gym scene with the dog that is amazing or some-such that got eliminated from the anime since Polt (the monster dog) was effectively removed. Hopefully she has more a role in any sort of continuation.

> The little blurbs at the end of each episode of the various species and their subspecies was an amazing touch.

Not only were they a nice inclusion, but they kept the focus on Miia, Lala, and the rest since verbose explanations about who they were and what they did were left to the end as opposed to being the center of attention.

> Kimihito with some quirk of his own would make him just blend in with the crowd.

Exactly! I see him under the same light; him having nothing special about him is what makes him special relative to the women that surround him. Better yet, his plainness accentuates the monster girls' qualities, more so than if did have some peculiarity of his own.

> Hell I am almost considering doing a couple write ups on how each character pretty much exemplifies the stereotypes of their monster species...

You should! Such a read would be interesting since the fantastical creatures they are based on are steeped in history (even if it is fictitious).

> Now we wait for season 2...

It better be sooner rather than later!

Thanks for the big comment, Nitro. I greatly appreciate it!

Like I said, my bias for this means I can go on longer than I objectively should :3

Ima do some more research (not to be confused with "research" dirty minds) and maybe try my hand out with one on the Lamia and how Miia just oozes what they represent. If it goes well maybe I'll do some more for the other girls, maybe even some of the MON girls if the main ones go well.

Oh god I actually kinda feel sorry for anime-only fans of Miia [Manga Spoil](/s "because the combination of her and Miia is heavenly")
>> ARTICLE
You know my pain now of waiting to see if a second season comes out. [Spoil](/s "How can we forget about the Papis combo, or the Cerea vs Mama Cerea jousting match. If the D arc was my favorite for actually making a mystery plot in an ecchi manga, the Parent Visit arc is my favorite only for the funny sexiness it adds. Plus you can't go wrong with an excuse to get Polt in the scene")
>> ARTICLE
I feel like i'm in the minority when it comes to this show.  Most people  seem to love it but it just looks like another ecchi harem show, except this time the girls are monsters.  I watched the first 4 eps and I just didn't get why people were loving it. The fanservice was ridiculous and over the top, not in a particularly funny way.  Jokes got stale quick and the main guy was rather boring. If the girls weren't monsters, or at least didn't look like monsters, and it played out in a similar way, would people still like it?  I don't know if I should try to give it another shot, but I just can't see why a lot of harems get hate while this gets a pass.  I will say though that it is at least a good looking show and the music is quite catchy.  Maybe one day i'll pick the show back up, but for now it just really isn't my type of anime. 
>> ARTICLE
What makes it better than most harems is actually the plot. And also some things that may not seem important but can be in the future [Manga spoiler](/s " all the girls have human dads and have daddy issues so there's probably going to be a big plot around that later. ")
>> ARTICLE
Er, it's because monster girls.  That simple.  Consider how many bizarre situations the cast gets into *because* they are monster girls.  Those are situations you *wont* see in any other harem/ecchi show.

I mean, there are other obviously redeeming elements like the great animation, well-done censorship, fantastic audio/sound, and the fact that the show isn't ashamed of what it is, but the central selling point is simply how unique it is due to monster girls.

If 10 more monster girl shows came out, I'm sure none of them would get as much attention because it'll have been done at that point.

I never watch Ecchi.... but I watched MonMusu because it seemed different.  That's my entire reason, and it was worth it!
>> ARTICLE
I think the main character being such a cardboard cutout was what made me dislike the show. There was no question of "how is he going to react?' because he always reacted in the same way to everything: "Oh that's okay." 


>> ARTICLE
If they weren't monsters it wouldn't work because of how Kimihito is written. He is purposely written as this bland boring character because literally EVERY single other character in the show, including the few other humans, are so expressive and unique, that him being normal makes him stand out. He isn't like most harem MCs because he actually acknowledges the feelings of all the girls and actively tries to make a choice, it just hasn't happened yet. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a little confused. Are people hating on you BECAUSE you didn't mention monster girls or the ecchi?
>> ARTICLE
Could be cause I'm looking at it differently. Reddit isn't the place to have a different opinion usually. 
>> ARTICLE
That's because it is a typical ecchi harem show. The story might well have not been there, the characters were copy-paste's of any other show and the comedy wasn't even good. 
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]

I normally actually hate them.  But my biggest problem with most shows recently is that they just shove obvious tropes into whatever semi-formed world the creator dreamed up.  The fact that MM actually sells itself chiefly in terms of its unique characteristics is a change.
>> ARTICLE
Literally every reason is because of monstergirls. People love it because monstergirls. People would hate it without monstergirls. It gets a pass because monstergirls. It's a fetish. You don't ask why.


>> ARTICLE
> If the girls weren't monsters, would people still like it?

I find this to be a weird question. The fact that the girls are monsters is the selling point of the show. If you took the central premise away, of course people wouldn't like it. The same can be said for literally every other piece of fiction in existence.
>> ARTICLE
If the girls weren't monsters, then they'd have needed more than a single dimension to their personality.

DAMMMNNNNNNNN

but yeah I agree, from my perspective the whole show was just softcore porn with no other value than something to jerk off to.

Ah... here's a way to put it. Monster Musume was just 20 minute long episodes of Bikini Warriors.

(That, or I suck at jokes. :3)

Yep, that is it!

However, its the elusive word "execution" that makes it *better* than other anime in its given genres. The monster motif certainly adds a twist and/or spin to the events, but because it always keeps itself centered on the the sex, the laughs, and the monsters -- each of its three goals -- it manages to refrain from heading into territory that it might otherwise not be capable of handling. So we see kidnappings and heroic speeches, but the show makes sure to flip it the other way, aligning itself with its intentions at all times.

Another way to describe it is "it knows itself" or "it does not take itself seriously," and because of this it is able to accomplish its goals without reservation.

> ...and the main guy was rather boring

I find this to be really clever, in the sense that Darling is *so* generic and *so* boring that you forget about him. You are not meant to care about his person, which causes you (the viewer) to place more attention/focus on the monster girls around him.

> If the girls weren't monsters, or at least didn't look like monsters, and it played out in a similar way, would people still like it?

Probably not as much -- the monster part is a unique modifier that is certainly appealing on multiple levels -- but as long as it maintained the same level of execution throughout, I could see myself praising it just as much.

> I will say though that it is at least a good looking show...

The show is beautiful! And not just the women, but the art, the lighting, the camera, and the animation are top-notch and another reason why MM surpasses other "ecchi," comedy harems.

> Maybe one day i'll pick the show back up, but for now it just really isn't my type of anime.

It is all good.

That just means more Miia, Lala, and Centorea for me!!! :D

[MRW I confuse the masses. :P](http://i.imgur.com/P15yRFR.gif)

To get a bit more serious, just because it is "another 'ecchi,' comedic harem" does not automatically earn it a low score! It executed its separate parts quite well, with my review and my rating reflecting that sentiment.

It is all about execution to me, and MM had it in droves. :3

haha it's because i've seen a handful of your reviews in past seasons that have low to mediocre scores, so i thought for sure you'll give this one quite a low score as well. I mean i was also a bit surprised when you gave Rokka no Yuusha 8/10 as well.
Also, i initially decided to pass on Rokka no Yuusha but after you gave it 8/10 i've now decided to watch it :D

Yes, I am not averse to going harsh on an anime, but that is only when it deserves it.

MM deserves nothing but praise for being a (within its realms) well-executed anime. :)

RnY is another good one and therefore deserved its high score as well.

Do not worry, I will be dishing out the low scores shortly. ;)

Hey Banjo!

This may be buried by other comments right now but I still want to express myself on your review for Monster Musume. In general I have always agreed with your opinion on anime ever since I decided to comment on your reviews, but this time I will not. At least not too much.

I think your first paragraph of the "story"-point is exactly how I feel about the show. Once you get used to the novelty of the girls being half-monsters the show feels like nothing more than "just another ecchi", though admittedly well-executed. For example, I really enjoyed the first half of the last episode with all its references. Moreover, like you said, it managed censorship way better than certain other ecchi this season (Prison School *cough*). All that being said I'm really glad it didn't try to be more than that because that makes anime like this way worse.

But while it didn't ruin itself to bring in plot where there isn't any it also couldn't be anything better. The anime brought one girl after another to us, introduced us to their quirks and certain sexual possibilities with them, possibly repeated them, and well, that's about it. The result is that if you don't come to like any of the girls enough you will not enjoy the show sufficiently. That brings me to my next thought...

> Kimihito is extremely bland

Personally, I think such a thing is never appropriate in a story, ever. Even if this is used for the above mentioned "damage control", I can't stand main characters you could very well just leave out only to make it more appealing to the male viewer. It's hard to imagine how ecchi anime could improve in that point without bringing in unnecessary and stupid story, but I feel that it's possible. And I think that many ecchi anime waste potential with this.

All in all, I did kind of enjoy it, like most ecchi anime I watch, but in my mind this show will probably be forgotten among the flood of ecchi anime out there. Or maybe I'm just a salty Lorelei fan who's mad about her not getting development. Who knows. :)

Good read, as always!

I was away from my computer a bit yesterday, so I apologize for getting to this so late! :3

> All that being said I'm really glad it didn't try to be more than that because that makes anime like this way worse.

Yep, MM knew what it was and what it wanted to be, and because of that it managed to keep itself from being something that it was not. The result is a strong "ecchi" anime (even if it happens to be "just another one of those types of shows" :P).

> The result is that if you don't come to like any of the girls enough you will not enjoy the show sufficiently.

That is true. Part of the allure of an anime like this -- "ecchi/comedy/harem -- is to have the characters, and especially the women, be people who you want to invest yourself in. That has multiple meanings: it could be attraction, liking their personality, finding them interesting, and so on. Since a (male lead) harem requires the women involved to be fun and captivating, when they are not it only hurts the show overall.

Admittedly, *any* anime falls under the idea; a strong cast leads to a better show!

> It's hard to imagine how ecchi anime could improve in that point without bringing in unnecessary and stupid story, but I feel that it's possible.

It would certainly prove strange to see an intricate plot/main character within an "ecchi" anime. Perhaps that will be the first one of its kind to receive unanimous 10's across the board!

> Or maybe I'm just a salty Lorelei fan who's mad about her not getting development. Who knows. :)

Now we get to the *real* issue of why you do not find MM to be of high quality. ;)

> Good read, as always!

Thank you Illus! I hope to see you in the next one, too!!!

It is certainly less 'bland' than other titles of similar nature. I have only seen 3 episodes or so, but it is already more enjoyable than *To Love-ru*. I agree that the censoring is definitely done better (compared to other ecchi shows) from what I have seen so far. Monster girls aren't really my thing, but I can see why people adore it so.

I am unsure on the 'doesn't take it self seriously' aspect. The show does generate some small drama with the 'racism' between monster girls and humans. Though I have not seen enough to judge this aspect accurately (unfortunately). For all I know, it may not delve deeper on this.

I may finish it, especially because my friend will gut me if I don't -- but for now, it is an above-average ecchi-romcom that I am not really in the mood for at this time.

AKA it will be my go-to ecchi next time I feel like watching ecchi :p

It was *so* nice not having a black bar covering half the screen for half the episode (*cough* Prison School *cough*).

> For all I know, it may not delve deeper on this.

[MM Season One Spoilers](/s "That is about as far as it goes, the scene in the first episode with the American-esque couple insulting Miia. And even then, immediately afterward the dude gets his face demolished. Other moments include a kidnapping and an almost-rape, but again the situations are diffused so quickly that the level of drama barely reaches one inch off the ground.")

> ...but for now, it is an above-average ecchi-romcom that I am not really in the mood for at this time.

I'll agree it's above average, but that's because there's so many TERRIBLE ecchi anime skewing the curve towards the negative that it's hard NOT to be above average if you have a decent budget and an established fan base.
>> ARTICLE
> ...it's hard NOT to be above average if you have a decent budget and an established fan base.

True!

Most "ecchi" anime are terrible because they focus way too much on lewd for the sake of being lewd. There is no variety, no pizzazz to speak of.

But *monster* girls? That literally speaks for itself. :P
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately there's zero character development. Frankly, Bikini Warriors had more character development, and that's four minute long episodes where half the frames count as softcore porn! The characters in the final episode are the same as in the first episode. They learn nothing, they don't build relationships, and there's no significant interplay between the monster girls. It's just the girls fawning around "darling" for no apparent reason other than "He was nice to them when other people were being mean."

And that's each girl's entire motivation, "Oh he wasn't mean to me, so I love him." There's no depth to the main character, so thus there's no depth to the monster girls whose entire personality is "Loves the main character and is (single adjective).
>> ARTICLE
I appreciate you writing this -- but I don't really look for character development in ecchi shows, y'know?

It is true that the show may be devoid of this aspect, but it doesn't need it, or rely on it. If it wants to change the status quo, it will happen when it happens. Besides, if things happened quickly they would miss out on making money.    
See: *every popular harem ever.*    


>> ARTICLE
If a show like Bikini Warriors can have character development in four minute episodes and still have plenty of creative ecchi, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect it a bit from a show like Monster Girls.

I'm not saying they need to have fully fleshed out (lol ecchi) character arcs and drama, but I don't think it's asking too much to have the characters at least form relationships and personalities that aren't "You like Darling? I like Darling too! Hooray for Darling!" 
>> ARTICLE
True, but moreso than that, it's that I don't mind either way. If the characters themselves are interesting, development is not needed for a comedy.

It could potentially make it better though.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed. I get what they were going for: ecchi that gets around a lot of censorship because "they're not human, so it's okay." Reminds me of how Marvell argued that the mutants in X-Men are not human, because there's a higher import tax for human dolls than non-human dolls. 

I feel they could have replaced a lot of the scenes of "standing around awkwardly" with just conversations between the characters to develop them further.
>> ARTICLE
>I feel they could have replaced a lot of the scenes of "standing around awkwardly" with just conversations between the characters to develop them further.

That works for me. I haven't seen enough of the series to make a proper, personal judgment. But that does sound better to the latter.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I understand that "It was answered in the manga" but one element that struck me as odd was that they never went into why these monster girls had decided to participate in the cultural exchange program.

As it's identified that each of the girls come from their own culture, they must have a community they come from. So why did each of these girls decide "I'm going to leave my community and go live among the humans in a cultural exchange program." It's not explored in the show, and none of their personalities match up with someone who would do that. It would be like... a military anime where half the characters have a personality where it's clear "this person does not belong in the military."
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they want to go into it at later arcs (that haven't been created yet). Or they want to keep things simple, and work on the present, not the past.
>> ARTICLE
Well, they're not working on the present because they're not moving towards the future. The characters have no past, so their entire character is "I am a monster, I love darling, and I'm a (one word adjective)." There's nothing else to them.

Rachnerra is the only one that has any personality development, as she develops a protective side for her "family." That's it.

It nails it, to say the least.

It is arguably the best "ecchi" anime I have ever encountered (if the Monogatari series does not get filed under that moniker), so it was almost too easy to rate it as such. :3

Monster Musume was pretty much everything I could ever want in a romcom harem ecchi SoL. It pretty much executed it *perfectly* with no real complaints at all about the series based on what my expectations were.

Musume was also one of the few series where I actually can't choose best girl clear cut. Everyone pretty much had their own moments to shine and they did so spectacularly. 

Even Darling was a pretty great harem MC who I would put up with one of the better harem MCs in anime. (Man protects his harem, gotta respect that especially after that godly punch in episode 1 and the egg punch as well.) 

Also I can't wait until the rest of the BDs are out so I can watch it again in it's uncensored glory.

Hello Banjo!

I've got to be honest with you, I didn't think this one was all that good of a show. I figured out that monster girls are kinda neat, that's for sure, but I felt like most of the characters just didn't grab me. Papi and Centorea were nearly unbearable for me, and Mia sometimes annoyed me as well. On top of that the side characters (Dryad, Lizard) didn't click with me, and if it wasn't for Melo & Rachnera I might have actually dropped this one. It just felt like another harem to me, and not different enough for me to really enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, Fes!

> I figured out that monster girls are kinda neat, that's for sure, but I felt like most of the characters just didn't grab me.

Hrmm!

That is definitely going to affect your connection to the anime for sure. In a harem, if the characters are not to your liking then that spells instant doom for the series in question!

> Papi and Centorea were nearly unbearable for me, and Mia sometimes annoyed me as well.

They were so hilarious and cute no matter what they did!

But I can see such a reaction because their mannerisms are a bit overzealous. Though that might have to be expected, considering how exotic the women technically are.

> ...and if it wasn't for Melo & Rachnera I might have actually dropped this one.

At least you managed to find some monster girls you enjoyed. ;)

> It just felt like another harem to me, and not different enough for me to really enjoy it.

Interesting!

It executes many of its elements pretty darn well regardless of how favorable the characters are. Its story is focused, the cast has meaning, and the art/music is top-notch. There is so much here that *does* make it different from the regular "ecchi"/comedy/harems. :3

from what I read in your review it's a pretty (objectively speaking) good show. But I think that a show can be really good in every aspect, if the show isn't really to your taste, then all of that won't matter at all.

The voice actresses did a splendid job overall. They captured their characters -- voice, mannerisms, and tics -- in a wonderful way. From sultry sounds to frantic speaking, they all nailed it hard.

Nice review, Banjo! I think that you have a pretty good idea of why people seem to like this show so much, despite it being as competent an ecchi comedy as any other. The combination of keeping the MC out of the equation (of awesomeness), the unique designs and general cuteness of everything made it feel a lot better, even if the most of the same elements of an ecchi are there.


Some things I liked about MonMusu:

* Art direction for each character was great and unique.
* Great Voice Acting, esp. Sora Amamiya, a.k.a. [Best Girl](#miiaembarassed)
* OP and ED capture the personalities of the characters participating, and sounded great to boot!

Hey, xJet!

It is a clever move, to make the self-insert so self-insert that you do not self-insert because he "does not exist" within the figurative space of the anime.

> Great Voice Acting, esp. Sora Amamiya, a.k.a. Best Girl

She is one of my favorite VAs because she has that natural princess voice that makes whichever character she plays pretty darn cute. And on top of that, she knows how to control her voice to match the emotion of specific moments, making most of her renditions top-notch no matter which character she happens to be playing.

And do not forget about Ari Ozawa! She did fantastic as Papi, too. :3

Banjo, I think there was another snake-like creature that became active when you were watching Monmusu. 

[Got ya **there.**](#kukuku)

No, but seriously I rarely take to ecchi shows, but this one was a great time. The characters are just fun, likable, and have enough uniqueness in their personalities to make them stand out. It also helps that the show never takes itself too seriously, and knows exactly what it is. It's dumb, sure, but it knows it. I think that's why I was on-board the whole time. 

Oh, and I love Miia and all, but I think Centorea's my girl. They're all enjoyable characters, though.....Except Draco, she's been frustrating thus far.

Hi, Tentaculat. Thanks for stopping by.

Prison School is another interesting one because it takes arguably as ridiculous of an approach as "women who are half-monster." That is part of why we love these ones so much I presume, for having a unique concept that challenges how we would normally view these types of shows.

I honestly didn't expect to like MonMusu as much as I did. Characters were super fun and varied, comedy was really solid, and it actually explored the idea of living with monster girls. To me show was at its best when it actually explored all those ideas and characters. That's why, for example, the episode where all girls are stalking Darling while pretending to be humans was the weakest one. It was just the usual stuff you could see in any other harem/ecchi show. Suu becoming Godzilla or eating too many poisonous mushrooms and thus getting kinda toxic herself, however, was just brilliant.

Also, Rachnera is just the best. Her story is the most interesting one as her appearance and danger levels contrast very heavily with other girls, and she's also the only character who has her head screwed on her shoulders. 

Good review! You're also quite fast with your reviews this season.

> Characters were super fun and varied, comedy was really solid, and it actually explored the idea of living with monster girls.

The characters being as awesome as they were -- not written-wise but fun-wise -- is what makes this stand out from other "ecchi," comedy harems. Most harems have maybe one or two that you like or get behind, with the others being too annoying or boring to follow. Here, *every* girl has something unique about them, and even if you love one the most, you are still bound to like all of them to some degree.

> That's why, for example, the episode where all girls are stalking Darling while pretending to be humans was the weakest one.

Good point!

Yes, when it used the monster motif to bring about the content -- such as the Suuzilla like you mentioned, or Miia's shedding, Centorea's overprotective behavior when around Rachnera, and Lala eating food through the hole in her head -- it shone brightly.

> ...and she's also the only character who has her head screwed on her shoulders.

Yep, that kind of contrast -- her being the one who is looked at as the "most different" but her being the one that understands others/the situation the most -- makes her one of the better characters in terms of character depth.

Still, Miia, Lala, and Centorea are better!!! :3

> Good review! You're also quite fast with your reviews this season.

And yes, I am trying to get these out faster. I have approximately ~25 to get through, so time is precious. At the rate I am going, I might be able to have two weeks left to spare at the end of the Fall 2015 season.

This show is just a gem. My favorite scene in the entire series is the one in the kitchen when all the girls realize Kimihito went missing (by Rachnera's hands). The girls are talking in the kitchen, worrying about Kimihito while Papi and Suu are bringing groceries in. This immediately suggests that he has come back and that Papi and Suu are helping him. You expect him to pop into the screen any second and most likely get strangled by Miia. Having done talking to each other the girls finally notice them and inquire about the groceries, to which they reply "We found them on the street, so we're bringing them in", making them realize Kimihito went missing.

This scene is so beautiful because it does so much in so little time: it subverts the viewer's expectation of seeing Kimihito, fulfills the girls' worries moving the plot along and informs the characters of Papi and Suu at the same time: Papi being denser than the other girls not realising what had happened, naive - not suspecting anything sinister by seeing bags of food on the street and helpful - bringing them into the house for everybody. It also informs the trust between Papi and Suu, Suu not questioning Papi's motives and just happily following along. And the best thing is that you didn't know all this was happening until it unfolded.
>> ARTICLE
> "We found them on the street, so we're bringing them in"...

That was seriously funny because they are (still) so carefree about anything. In other words, the *delivery* makes it. :3

> This scene is so beautiful because...

It is always interesting to see the minute details that go into even just a single joke that lasts all of twenty seconds, which in turn demonstrates the strength of MM's comedy.

Thanks for the comment and insight, Shepard!

Edit: Phrasing!
>> ARTICLE
EDIT - [Phrasing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2CE0DjDdVA)

I'd also like to say how surprised I was to find that Suu became my favourite character in the show. At first I did not see the appeal of her. My initial thoughts about people saying "Suu best girl" was "What? This barely cognitive being that is barely a person who pervs out on other girls for no reason? She's barely a character. Yeah I get it, she's cute, but she's miles away from being best anything here". But as I continued watching I kept noticing small little details about her that eventually made me question my initial impression.

Looking at my previous favourite character, Papi, I realised the quality I like about her the most when compared to others is her carefree attitude, and how it also translates into shamelessness. "I want to take a bath in a fountain? No problem! Oh, wait, better remove my clothes. I mean seriously, who'd bathe with their clothes on ;P", she sees Miia and Centorea perving out on Suu who changed her form into Darling? "I want in on this too! Whaaat? It's just Suu". This shamelessness would put others in an embarrassing situations (which I find funny) and sometimes inadvertently make them realise their own actions (as in the case where Miia and Centorea were only pretending to show Kimihito-Suu how to treat Darling-kun but actually were just giving into their own temptations). That's what I love about Papi - careless, sexy and overwhelmingly cute (the motherly instinct is a heart melter but let's get back on track).

That's where Suu comes in. At first look she's a failed harem trope - she drinks water and grows a gorgeous body with huge boobs just "because". She pervs out on other girls for an absurd reason - "you see, she tasted some sweat that means we had to have a slime rape scene in here. No, trust me, we _have_ to put it in here". She seems like a force of nature. Something you can program and you can't argue with.

if Taste(sweat) then Rape(sweat.Owner());

and every girl now knows and accepts the fact that sometimes these things just happen. "What are you gonna do, it's just Suu being Suu".

But that's when a thought crossed my mind. "What if this is not the case, what if she actually _does_ know what she's doing and just doesn't care? What if she is an actual person?" Then I started noticing things: the same scene, where she turns into Kimihito-Suu and all the other girls are perving out, she's pretty reserved. Hypothesis: She cares about Darling-kun and wants to help him, realising this is no time for personal pleasure. "This might be possible" I thought. On the last episode when her and Darling go to meet the forest girl and she realises that the forest girl might not give Darling food she charges in to pleasure her. Not to fulfill her own desires, but to help Darling. On the episode where all the girls spied on Kimihito's date Suu became clothes for Centorea and Miia. There we saw Suu trying her best to hold on when they started running away from each other. She could have perved out on them both but she didn't. Why? Wait, let's check the formula: if sweat then rape, yes there it is. Clear as a day. But she didn't. She simply helped them out. 

"Wait, could it be that she's the biggest pervert on the show and has been flying under the radar the whole show?" I thought. This might be plausable. The show convinces us that Suu has very little agency (to the point of being able to actually be someone else), and when she shows it, it's usually a big moment. However, it might also be that the show also distracts us from the fact that every pervy moment with her was not due to "that's how nature works" but due to Suu having a desire and making a choice. That's why the moment I realised that Suu is my own power fantasy she became my favourite character in the show. And every other girl just goes with it! I'm still baffled and amazed! You're even more shameless than Papi and I love it, Suu.
>> ARTICLE
> ...Papi, I realised the quality I like about her the most when compared to others is her carefree attitude, and how it also translates into shamelessness.

Yea, Papi's ability to pretty much not care about anything gives her a certain edge since she does what "feels right" in the moment. And in her actions, she is pretty logical which, considering her birdbrain self, makes the viewer go, "Huh. I guess she is right." :P

> if Taste(sweat) then Rape(sweat.Owner());

bool sweating = true;

while (sweating)

{
     
     suu_attacks();

     if (still_sweating())
     {
           continue;
     }
     else
     {
          sweating = false;
     }

}

> Hypothesis: She cares about Darling-kun and wants to help him, realising this is no time for personal pleasure.

Deep down, she probably does want to help him as much as she can. While she is still learning and mimicking for the most part, she might feel as though she wants to repay him for all that he has done for her. I do not believe she is *fully* aware of what she is doing -- that it is all purposeful on her end -- but I could see it as subconscious behavior.

I am actually interested in when Suu becomes the most intelligent of the group, as in she is a genius and capable of doing things completely on her own without the need to copy others after slowly gaining all of the knowledge around her. I think it would be hilarious to see her outsmarting everyone else after being relegated to her simpleton role for so long. :3

> ...but due to Suu having a desire and making a choice.

At the end of the day, we all desire something. And in Suu's (and every other girl's case), that something is Darling!

Strangely I don't find the show that titillating, but it is a lot of fun. No pretentiousness, no angst ridden drama, just a straight up fun ride for ~~the whole family~~ crazed anime fans to enjoy. The girls are sweet and adorable, each fulfilling their niches well.

Despite him being a bland everybody, one thing I particularly liked about Darling-Kun, was that (unlike many harem MCs), you can tell why the girl's like him so much. Yeah it would be interesting to see some character development, (exploring is dark past?) but it won't trouble me if they don't.

In all its a lot fun and I can't wait for season 2 or more of the Manga.

> ...make me despise you.

I think it is pretty awesome that you have so much passion when it comes to my work. I am being serious here and not at all sarcastic. It is important to have dissenting perspectives like yours in the mix because if I got all praise all of the time it would only serve to get to my head (or my ass, apparently :P).

Taking what you are saying here, I am still learning. Truth be told I have only been a critic for a little over a year now -- I started back in August of 2014 -- so I am by no means at the pinnacle of my craft. This is why I include my little blurb at the beginning, "Just a dude looking to get better at reviewing/analyzing anime." *Looking to get better*. That is the most important part of that statement. I am someone who believes that, no matter how good or bad someone might be at something, there is always room for improvement. And for me, that is writing. Meaning even when I become the greatest writer of the era, I will still be including that phrase because I will still be looking to hone my skills.

I hope my future reviews will be more to your liking!

Why must you be so likable Banjo? I try and be a huge dick for once and you come and make me feel bad about it. 

If you still give a slight fuck what I say, I think you need to take a step back and stop rating everything on the same scale. NGE had a fucking mess of a plot, pretty shit animation, and the rest of it was messy, but it doesn't make it any less good. On the other hand, no matter how good of an ecchi MonMusu is, it can never live up to a decently written series with a better subject matter.

Ha!

I do not know. I just like other see other people smile or be happy, and the quickest way to make that happen is for me to be happy myself. So I am always smiling and always trying to spread good vibes. :D

> I try and be a huge dick for once and you come and make me feel bad about it.

Don't feel bad! I am fine, trust me. "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me," as they say. ;)

> If you still give a slight fuck what I say...

I do!

> ...I think you need to take a step back and stop rating everything on the same scale.

That being said, I cannot follow this sentiment!

Here is why. It comes down to *execution*. You will see me spouting this word in my reviews and in my threads. "It executed this well, it executed that well, the execution, here, here, and here was easy to see," and so on. Execution is the name of the game. So if an "ecchi," comedic harem executes itself well, it gets a high score. If NGE, with its crazy strong characters and deep themes, executes itself well, it gets a high score. That is the "same scale" here. I do not compare one anime to another (unless it has a sequel/prequel). I observe each one in a vacuum, separate from other shows, in order to make a judgement that is as fair to it (the show being scrutinized) as possible. This is because every anime has different ideas, goals, and motivations. Trying to view a battle "shounen" anime with the same light as a "josei" one is not fair to the battle "shounen" because it is doing things differently, and the reverse order is the same as well. But for both, execution is key, and is therefore what I critique!

So when you see my scores, do not think that "He gave an 8 to MM and a 9 to NGE, so he believes that MM's themes/characters/story are practically of comparable value," instead think "He gave an 8 to MM and a 9 to NGE, so he believes that MM and NGE had comparable execution of their elements." The latter, not the former, is the truth! :3

I'm pretty much in the middle of watching Monster right now (about half-way done), but I just wanted to comment on how well done the first episodes are. A lot of people shit on Monster by saying it has slow pacing and unnecessary side stories, but as I've watched it I've always felt that there was this dark atmosphere to the show that really captivates you from the start. Monster's first episode is one of the best first episodes that I have seen so far, as it really nails this tone down and sets out what this show is going to be like for the next 73 episodes.

Oh man. This is gonna be one hell of a ride. A lot of people on this sub love to complain about how Monster was apparently boring and slow-paced, but when I watched this for the first time I was hooked. This may be the first re-watch thread that I actually participate in.

I personally find hard to finish the series because of the art and character design... I don't see how the pace is bad, sometimes is even faster that it should be, every episode I watched serves a purpose, or at least that what it made me think. Don't get me wrong tho, I think the general design of the show fits well the general theme, but sometimes is just boring because of boring colors, that's my opinion and probably other people see this as well and drop the show like I did myself in the past.

The art and character design are fantastic, they are expressive and have a ton of detail, and I love the realistic grounded feeling they give to the show. The problem is they work far better in manga, which has fantastic art and only gets better. The anime doesn't have a large enough budget to handle it all so you have these detailed expressive faces that are completely still with only very basic lip flaps. Its a good thing this is a horror show because it is thoroughly creepy. 
>> ARTICLE
It is slow to start, and the pacing overall is slow, but I like the deliberate pacing choices here. It allows to atmosphere to build up and for the audience to absorb all the nuance and subtlety in the characters and narrative.
>> ARTICLE
I agree.  I hear so many complaints about pacing and I think... Did we watch the same show?!  The pacing felt perfect. I'm excited to rewatch it. 
>> ARTICLE
I was just about to start marathoning this last night. Good thing I didn't. This will be my first watch. Much excitement... I hope I can hold myself back from binging though if its as captivating and intriguing as people keep saying it is.
>> ARTICLE
I'm excited for you! It's my favorite show of all time. Nothing really comes close to it for me in terms of storytelling and characters. It's really amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah the first 2 episodes. I remember the first time I watched these I knew I was in for something special. Like a lot of Urasawa's work, the ''human'' element of it all just comes across so well, from the dialogue and moral dilemmas presented, to the excellent art style and subtle music cues. Having watched this once before, I also enjoy seeing a lot of foreshadowing.

In any case, the cogs of this series have started moving and will keep moving slowly but surely til the very end.
>> ARTICLE
Many people stop watching due to the 'slow' story progression, stick with it. It has some of the most amazing characters and plot developments you will witness in a anime.
>> ARTICLE
While it may be slow I feel mostly every episode is important. I've watched 35 episodes so far and I can only single out 1 or 2 episodes that could have been removed.
>> ARTICLE
So this is my first time watching, and all I can think after the first two episodes is, WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG!?

I love the feel of the show. The creepy music, the totally immoral and corrupt behavior of the other doctors.  I can just tell that Tenma is going to turn bad at some point.

At the end of the first two episodes I'm sure one of the two Liebert kids is evil, or possibly both. I'm just not sure which, but I would bet on Johan.  It doesn't seem like Johan could get around the hospital to kill the two doctors, Boyer and Oppenheim though.  Anna has been roaming around, and maybe she killed them for bringing them near her brother? Not sure.  Maybe Johan killed them because of what he overheard in his coma from Tenma and the director.

But then, who killed the director? It seems like Tenma would have been too drunk at the time to pull anything like that off.  It's possible he did it in a drunken stupor, but I feel like the director's death would be messier then. I wonder if the director was poisoned with something at the hospital and then made it to his home office before the effects hit him.  Either one of the Liebert children or Tenma could potentially be responsible for this.

Can't wait to see what happens (and I'm probably going to watch ahead now, at least a little bit...let's face it I'm going to binge watch now).
>> ARTICLE
It seems like the doctors were poisoned as no blood was shown, but their faces looked fear-struck, almost like they were scared to death. Also pretty sure Johan is evil too, especially when he opened his eyes after Tenma left, that just looked evil.
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, I felt the same way when I first watched it. Make sure to take part in discussions even if you watch ahead! :D

[**David Sylvian - For the Love of Life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhPGbr51jfc)

This is hands down my favorite ed of anime series I've seen, and the complete song (which I linked above) is even more amazing. What I really like is that he wrote this song specifically for Monster. He had this to say about it: "I was attracted to the Monster material by the moral dilemma faced by its central character. The calm surface of the music giving way to darker undercurrents signifying the conscience of the lead protagonist and the themes of morality, fate, resignation, and free will." [(from his site)](http://www.davidsylvian.net/releases/tracks-poems/60-tracks-davidsylvian/823-for-the-love-of-life.html)

> Some of Eva's faces, especially the way they draw her mouth, just ooze that "self-satisfied spoiled bitch" aura that I hate so much.

seriously is like watching something really disgusting whenever this happens. props to the animators, they did a really good job in that regard.

>"And slowly, we come to realize: it's all as it should be" oh my god nope nope nope.

the ed calms me for some reason :/


>> ARTICLE
Haha, yeah as a first-time viewer I totally agree about Eva. That scene of her eating steak in the restaurant...I've never hated a character for how they ate steak as much since I watched Cypher in The Matrix.  "Ignorance is bliss" applies to both characters, honestly. Eva would love to live her life completely ignorant to the plight of people who weren't born equal.
>> ARTICLE
Ah man, I could handle Eva, but her father *is such a piece of shit*. By the end of the first episode I had taken to calling him Nazi Doctor Heinemann.

... Yes, I do want that fan nickname to become a thing. But can you blame me?

I watched these first two episodes before, but I wanted to ask if the dub is any good. I love well done dubs
>> ARTICLE
The dub is easily equal to the sub. The only minor criticism I have of it is that Tenmas VA slips into the animetypical "Strained whisper" for dramatic sections.
>> ARTICLE
It makes up for it since his VA is the same that did Yasuo from League of Legends.
>> ARTICLE
Dub is excellent. The only flaw is the lack of German accents in Germany - though you don't get accents in Japanese either.
>> ARTICLE
Dub is great. I personally like the dub for this series over the sub because it moves at a slow pace at times and with the dub I can multi task while watching without losing out on the conversations.
>> ARTICLE
The dub is really good.
>> ARTICLE
Yes,  the dub is excellent! I'll actually add that into the OP in a second. 
>> ARTICLE
Dub is great. There's only really one Asian guy so it's not like they look Japanese or anything like most anime. 
>> ARTICLE
so any news on the hbo adaption?
>> ARTICLE
Its one of about 25 projects that Del Toro has on the backburner, along with an adaptation of Lovecrafts "Mountains of Madness", among others.
>> ARTICLE
Not that I know of =[
>> ARTICLE
I was initially going to rewatch Evangelion the other day while the sub was doing that but things fell through and I didn't get around to it. 

Maybe I'll try watching this tonight after Kantai and Kiseijuu. Its been in my backlog for a while.
>> ARTICLE
As a first-time watcher, I wish I wasn't spoiled about the [boy](/s "being a major suspect for local murders") after reading the MAL synopsis. I feel like I'm missing out on some of the mystery, suspense, and intrigue. Although there were some big hints in the first two episodes, it would've been nice to have suspicions confirmed rather than known beforehand. I gather that [the boy](/s "is a psychopathic killer (a monster), who was faking his tears when he saw his twin sister. And his sister keeps trying to tell people to please kill him. I'm guessing the girl or a third party shot the boy, or he was somehow shot by accident. Now he's killing these doctors because he heard Dr. Tenma talk about the director/doctors being immoral and better off dead. Alternatively, Dr. Tenma could have a homicidal alter ego that he isn't aware of and the evil kid is just a fabrication of his mind. I doubt that's the case though. It would be interesting if the brain surgery caused the boy to turn into a serial killer, but I also doubt that seeing how his sister freaks out upon seeing him.")

I can already tell that I'm going to love this series. It's already bringing up the big moral dilemmas about the value of human lives compared to others. Is the life of an adored celebrity worth more than the average Joe? What if the average Joe came to the hospital first and has a more severe injury? While the hospital director may seem greedy, one could argue that the hospital making more money would translate to better staff, equipment, facilities, and research, thus saving more human lives.

The worth of a human life reminds me of a writing prompt I had in high school. The victims (or their families if they were deceased) of 9/11 [were monetarily compensated by the government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11th_Victim_Compensation_Fund). They received money estimated to be "how much each victim would have earned in a full lifetime". A value was literally put on people's lives. It makes you wonder about the morality and fairness of such a thing.

I look forward to seeing how Monster deals with such moral grey areas.
>> ARTICLE
What you say you have spoiled isn't **entirely** accurate, and what is accurate is shown pretty soon (read: next couple episodes) in the show. So really don't worry about that.

And yes, I'm sure you'll absolutely love the show. It's a show pretty much about those morally grey areas.
>> ARTICLE
Good to know. Now I'm speculating what I didn't get right. I'll just wait and see.
>> ARTICLE
Guys, dont watch it at night like I did. It was really scary sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Or alternatively, always watch it at night :D
>> ARTICLE
This is my first time watching Monster, and, like I did with Higurashi, I'm only going to watch this at night.  I personally think watching/reading horror stories all alone and in the dark makes them more effective, but, of course, to each their own.
>> ARTICLE
Take a laptop to an abandoned castle in the middle of the night and watch it there. Alone.


[](#glasses-push)
>> ARTICLE
I personally dislike every character from the first few episodes besides Dr. Tenma. By dislike I mean their personalities. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I like Tenma right now. I mean, he knows he's right in this situation about operating the kid, he's still somehow doubting himself. I guess that's what happen when you are new in any career, but I really don't like how he's being so hard on himself
>> ARTICLE
Eva, Becker, Director Heinemann...Yeah, I pretty much agree.

But the characters really do get amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I'm 25 episodes into this show. Looks like I got here on time :D
>> ARTICLE
same here, I'm on episode 24. I always get stuck around this part of the show, this is my third try to watch the full series. Maybe these threads will make it entertaining for me to actually finish it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad I decided to start rewatching. I'm seeing the show in kind of a new light now, seeing it for the second time.
>> ARTICLE
Well, anyone here who has been stalking my posts (which is no one ^^^^hopefully) knows that I got stuck around episode 16 of this series and then just...stopped. Suppose I'll jump in these threads with some real discussion (perhaps) around then, should serve as a nice excuse to finally finish this.

Thanks for the excuse, /r/anime!
>> ARTICLE
Feel free to participate in the discussions for episodes you've already seen! I'm sure you have stuff to say :)
>> ARTICLE
I probably will before episode 16. Right in the middle of watching Eureka Seven at the moment, so after I finish that (within the next few days, probably) I'll have ~~enough computer space~~ I mean, plenty of time to watch Monster
>> ARTICLE
This is 1a on my all-time list, so I'll take a perfect excuse to watch it again.
>> ARTICLE
If I had more time I'd totally rewatch this again. I still stand by it being one of the most mature and well-written anime out there.

Some of the absolute best written characters as well. Those who haven't watched it yet are in for a ride. 
>> ARTICLE
Well i completely forgot about this  looks like its 4 episodes for me today!
>> ARTICLE
Well threads are only posted every other day, so you have time to watch the next two :D
>> ARTICLE
First time watching. The music for these episodes does seem amazing, really sets the mood for the dark nature of the episodes. 

I liked how it shows how doctors are choosing the politics of the office over the well-being of their patients, kinda makes you think about the disgusting nature of this practice. Find it kind of implausible that Tenma is the only doctor capable of saving a patient, that he's the only doctor so skilled in the "best" hospital of Germany. 

Really wanna watch ahead but fighting the urge, seems like exactly my type of show though (loved Death Note and Code Geass). 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I'll be watching the anime in the same increments as you guys will be because of the number of episodes I usually watch in a day, especially with all the current shows I'm watching. Episode one however was great and I really enjoyed it.

Only one episode in and you can tell that Tenma's morals really are quite a step above some of the other character's.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed these first two episodes, and I can't wait to see if it gets any better.  Although I hated the personalities of most characters, I have heard that the characters only get better, so I'll be watching to see if that is the case.  I did really enjoy the dark environment that Monster has set up already, and I also thought it was a great idea to make Tenma choose between the lives of the boy and the mayor.  Watching him make such a terrible choice really helped to humanize his character.  Also, why is it that I get the feeling it will be really hard to resist marathoning this anime?
>> ARTICLE
Oh man you guys are in for an adventure
>> ARTICLE
Oh! It's vincent law from ergo proxy, and they even seem like similiar characters. Really hyped for this communal viewing as it's my first watch, and while i say that i don't want ANY spoilers, i intend on loving this show and spoilers piss me off.
>> ARTICLE
Soo... I'm jumping in on this rewatch and I'll catch up with you soon, guys! The first two episodes already establish a nice, dark ambience and I hope it will be maintained. It reminds me somewhat of *The Crow* - not too much, but it's also quite gloomy and somewhat gothic. And the ending theme, man!

It's also one of the few animes I've watched without any moe or otaku elements (well, it's only been 2 episodes, but I think it's already safe to say so). Makes me long for similar series after finishing this one. It aired only ten years ago, but it's so different from the bulk of the more recent shows I've seen...
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see you joining in!  We aren't too far in so not a bad time to start! 

You're right about the Dark and Gothic type of ambience.  It almost feels like some sort of Western media just due to the suspense,  topic,  and execution.  And yes,  that means there are literally no moe or otaku elements.  At all.  That surprised me when I first watched it,  and definitely in a good way. 
>> ARTICLE
I tried *five* times to get into this show because of the constant praise it gets here.



But it just sucks.  Sorry.  I'm going to love the manga, I'm sure, but the show is trash.
>> ARTICLE
what are you talking about? the show is not bad.. I can understand not liking the art or maybe the character designs but the writing is really good and the adaptation is well done with a good cast and a excellent soundtrack that fits well the ambient of the show and the pace is not too fast or too slow.

I always got stuck in the half part of the series, but that's because I don't really like the art, it looks too boring for me, but even then I can understand how people like this show so much, is really hard to find well written pieces like this nowadays.

I personally going to take these threads as a push for me to finish the series, I know is a really good show and is just my brain telling me that it doesn't like gray-like pallets in animation design, maybe you should too.
>> ARTICLE
Wow if you want to get motivated to do something with yourself, I don't know if watch anime is a worthy goalpost let alone this one.



I managed so suffer up to about episode 9 or something before realizing I could simply read the manga for far better pacing and way less cringe.  This web site loves Monster more than life itself but I just couldn't do it.

corporate tax returns were due monday and I have pretty much reddited nonstop since....

It's good. Don't expect flashy shit to keep you interested. It's deep, complex, and you have to appreciate it more than enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
It's it anything like death note?
>> ARTICLE
Apart from the similarities due to the genre overlap, not at all. Death Note is about mind games, very much typical Shounen in its execution (see potato chips), whereas Monster is a slow-burning psychological thriller; I think the latter is directed at the Seinen demographic. Can't remember right now. 

If I had to liken them to something, Death Note is kinda Catch Me if You Can meets... Idk, Face/Off. Monster is more The Departed/Shutter Island. 
>> ARTICLE
> very much typical Shounen in its execution (see potato chips)

Not shounen at all,it just happened to either be a failed scene and be funny or they just tried to put a joke in there,I have watched a lot of shounen and I definitely wouldn't consider death note one.
>> ARTICLE
The potato chips mention was a joke, and the show has the teens>>>the world vibe that I nearly always get from Shounen shows, and maintains it even going into the final third despite the protagonist technically falling foul of the age restriction. 
>> ARTICLE
Death Note is definitely in the "appeals to teenagers" group. Whether or not that's equal to Shounen by some sort of official definition isn't the point, I don't think. The writing for the show was clever, but frankly it reeked of some kind of teenage power fantasy.
>> ARTICLE
So basically like 90% of anime? 

Most anime are made to appeal to teenagers and there is nothing wrong with it
>> ARTICLE
I don't have a problem with Shounen stuff specifically. I didn't care for Death Note being somewhere in the middle. Light felt like he was created by an antisocial teenager who honestly thinks he is too smart for the rest of us. I'm really not into that, and I don't think Death Note would have resonated with me years ago when I was in high school either. It honestly has little to do that it's aimed at a teenager audience and more to do with the fact that I think it's a kind of an awkward show that comes off incredibly naive and hard to believe. The fact that young fans practically worshiped Light as an anti-hero (he's not) at the time really irritated me too.

I'll watch Shounen if it's good, and frankly there are a lot of pretty great ones out there. I just think Death Note is not an example of a good one.
>> ARTICLE
That was the point (regarding Light) I think you just don't like the characters and thats fine

I don't think Light and L were unconvincing or absurd as characters, The show wasn't "realistic" or anything but I never expected that

I wanted a thriller that kept me on the edge of the seat and thats what I got, were they smarter than they should have been? Sure but I don't care

Plus we had the whole moral question with the Death Note and killing off criminals, and that was very interesting 

Monster wasn't very realistic either, especially Johan who had some sort of magical ability to manipulate everyone whenever he wanted

I can understand people thinking that Light is an anti hero (he is definitely a villian though) 

The crime was reduced by 70% all over the world because of him, so he did do a lot of good (with wrong motives, becoming a god)


>> ARTICLE
You're right that it mainly comes down to my subjective dislike of the characters. I'm not trying to put down people who enjoyed the show or anything like that. I have a really intense dislike for some aspects of the show for some reason, and I admitted that I was and am peculiarly harsh with my stance on the show. There's something about the show that absolutely rubs me the wrong way, and it's not so easy to explain. I can't change how I feel about it because I've tried and it didn't work. I guess I am unable to suspend my disbelief for this specific case.
>> ARTICLE
No problem mate, everyone has that kind of show (for me its TTGL) 



>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
Is death note just supposed to appeal to teenagers because the protagonist is one and they can relate to him?
>> ARTICLE
Not really. Death Note is more two sides duking it out while Monster is much more one man's hunt for redemption. They both have manipulative villains but they have completely different motives. Biggest thing for me is that Death Note is extremely addictive. You can't stop watching, it's a show that begs to be binged as it relies a lot on elaborate tricks and plans. Monster is much more slow to begin. For instance, to get through the first 25 episodes took me 3 months, the last 50 about 3 or 4 days. It's not reliant on tricks or schemes but more about psychology and themes and relationships. Overall, their both masterpieces, but completely different.
>> ARTICLE
Monster is a "plot-driven" anime with little action. It's more about the complex storyline. Death Note and Monster are similar in genre, but there's nothing supernatural in Monster. 

I personally believe many people who like one will like the other anime, as long as you're committed to watching Monster til the end.
>> ARTICLE
I may add it to my PTW list but I don't know. I already have a lot of anime there.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
It's far more mature than Death Note, and also just plain better in my own opinion. All they really have in common is that they're psychological thrillers from a similar era of animation and style. But the difference in writing and plot quality is astounding.

I'll admit that I'm pretty harsh about Death Note. That show comes off to me as a watered down thriller aimed at teenagers. It's good for what it is, but I am not at all a fan and I hate when it's compared to something as good as Monster.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Okay
>> ARTICLE
I like both for different reasons 

They really aren't similiar at all 
>> ARTICLE
I agree that they aren't similar in a meaningful way, as I said.

Death Note as a show..had it's moments where I had to admit that the writer was very clever. The premise was neat, it was executed well at times, but Light and L were so unconvincing so much of the time I couldn't stop rolling my eyes. It's ironic that the death gods and magical notebooks come off as less absurd than Light and L as characters in their circumstances and intellectual abilities. They were soulless fantasies that had the potential to so much more meaningful even in the context of being a show that is meant for a younger audience.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I enjoy Death Note, but Monster is just way more intricate and its characters are much more fleshed out. When I see Monster recommended to people on the premise that it's similar to Death Note, it kinda breaks my heart because that person will probably not end up enjoying Monster due to the wrong expectations.
>> ARTICLE
Is there police that tried to investigate?
>> ARTICLE
There is a police element, and one of the main characters is an investigator from the BKA named Lunge. However, the police play more of an antagonistic role, and most scenes featuring the police are when conflicting with the MC. It's not the main part of the story though.
>> ARTICLE
This actually sounds like my kind of show. I will start watching this later.
>> ARTICLE
It's an excellent series, if a bit lengthy for my taste. It's very heavy on psychological and philosophical themes, if you are into that kind of thing. I also like that it's set in post-unification Germany, instead of being yet another anime set in, say, a freaking high school.

The main draw, however, is Johan. That son of a bitch is TERRIFYING. He's what I imagine the antichrist would be like if the Book of Revelation actually happened. I'm convinced that Johan would defeat any other anime villain in a one-on-one fight: not by winning through physical power, but by convincing his opponents to kill themselves.
>> ARTICLE
Bit lengthy, heh. 

My opinion is that this show is a 4 or 5 out of 10 at best, but I'll admit that it COULD have been 8 or 9. The total runtime is about 30 hours, of which probably 5-6 hours are either intro, flashbacks or characters repeating their life story for the umpteenth time.

Cologne, Dsseldorf, Munich and Prague. It's seriously like for each new city they wrote themselves into a blind alley of pointless characters and story, so they kill of a couple of new people they introduced, let the protagonist meet Johan and freeze up (uuhhh) for then to carry on to the next city. 

The inflation of characters and side stories is way over the top. I get that this is based on a manga, but adapting it for the screen requires some compromises, and it seems that they chose to include EVERY turn Tenma/Nina made on their journeys. The pointless countryside doctor routine, Nina's history as a waitress at an Italian resturant (a full episode too), Schuwald/Munich and his business empire, "The Baby" and the neo-nazis, the whole Czech secret police debacle, the list goes on.

Point is, a third of all this would have been plenty. Lunge, a kinda interesting character, is left out for stretches of 5+ episodes. Having the story centered around Tenma/Nina and the hunt for Johan, with Lunge as the police and assistance from Gillen and Grimmer would have been plenty. 

The show tries to be intelligent, but is it? They somehow need to spoon-feed us that Lunge, a man devoid of emotion and utterly devoted to his job, lost his wife and daughter to a lack of attention. Yes, we got it, Lunge is ice cold, yet they AGAIN reintroduce his daughter for a meeting in Munich (which he, surprise, choose not to attend because of his job). Five minutes wasted. Monologues, flashbacks, hints, it's like they tattoo the plot explanation onto your brain. Sometimes I'd like to figure out this myself, thank you very much. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest, so far I've seen forty five episodes or so and haven't seen Johan do a damn thing to make him intimidating yet. Sure it's mentioned what he did at Kinderheim sounds terrifying and I'd love to see it, but so far it's all talk no action and he just comes off as a clever, sorta spooky dude. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you heard what Johan did to general Wolf and "why"?

Most of Johan's doings can't be shown and it might be too easy to miss just how huge his influence on other characters' actions and personalities are.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if I have, I drifted off after being disappointed with how bland I was finding everything. And while I'm not demanding a vivid portrayal of all his subtle doings and so, actually being able to witness the events of Kinderheim would be great to watch. His crowning achievement in subtle destruction and disparity is largely kept in the dark, and I would love to see the chilling and brilliant subtle strokes he took in ripping that place apart. 
>> ARTICLE
I think you might like the last story arc of the anime.

Still, monsters are most terrifying when they can't be seen. If Johan was too much in the spotlight he would've become more of a cartoonish super villain. It's Urasawa's signature style to keep things under the hood. Most of his chapters begin with no clue who the people talking in the scene are. 20th Century Boys went even further by not showing the face of the antagonist, yet every character that saw his face went quite literally insane. It was such a uniquely frustrating and gripping manga to read through.

I really appreciate this kind of slow and hidden approach to storytelling but I understand it's not for everyone.
>> ARTICLE
And again, I'm not looking for a cackling villain grandly displaying his evil plans to all, but maybe seeing him pulling the strings like Littlefinger from *Game of Thrones* or something. Seeing people go white at just his face is spooky and all, but if I haven't actually seen him do anything that chills me to my core I can't feel much more than a bit of an eery feeling, not the existential dread I was hoping for. 
>> ARTICLE
But intimidating?

You make allowances for lack of character development in the beginning, but when you are pushing 50 episodes and still lack a fundamental explanation for his insanity I give up. And this is not because I don't "get it", I just don't find him very terrifying. Everything about him is hidden behind a lazy layer of assumptions.
>> ARTICLE
You haven't finished the story yet you make harsh judgements. I don't understand you. There's very clear reason to Johan's personality and it lies within the Red Rose Mansion and "I'm back" episode but those are some of the later ones. Monster is a mystery story so why would it reveal the biggest questions too soon?

Also even if you don't find his actions terrifying (like I do) I wouldn't see that as a failure of the character. You just prefer different kind of antagonists. But the way he manipulates people, even children, is pretty damn unsettling to me.
>> ARTICLE
My point was that a new viewer would need to watch until the region of the 50th episode before anything that drives him is explained. There are a lot of interesting topics about his upbringing, 511 etc, but really it's for the most part a big blur which we are basing assumptions on for way too long. 

Interpreting his actions at face value as terrifying is just not happening for me. The series spends way too much time having numerous characters describing him as a manipulative insane mastermind and whatnot without letting the viewer in on the action. 

And I would be careful reading too much into all the "hints" they drop on his personality along the way, remember for all other twists and turns every subtlety is served on a platter. 
>> ARTICLE
Finding out what drives Johan is a big turning point which leads directly to the final story arc. Your impatience is your own issue to deal with. You shouldn't demand stories to match your expectations. You can stop watching and say that you didn't like it but you shouldn't critisize the plot or the characters before you've actually listened what the storyteller had to say.

I dislike the way you describe your disappointment as "not letting the viewer in on the action". Like I said in my original comment, there isn't much to be shown here. How can you visualize psychological horror and fear? IMO there are plenty of victims brought up, Tenma, Nina, Kinderheim, general Wolfe, the kids in Prague, Richard, that blind old rich man, the thursday boy, several serial killers around Germany etc. In addition almost all the characters suffer indirectly from Johan's actions like Dieter, Eva and Lunge.

I'd be curious to hear if you have some other psychological horror series that are better in your opinion or did you just pick a wrong genre to watch. I haven't found many similar series. Too often horror and malice are measured in gore and deathcount.
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps my mistake is comparing and judging an anime series against it's genre and not against other animes. I mean, True Detective told a crime/thriller story in 8 hours. I suspect a lot of the problems lie in the adaption from the comic book to the screen, though. Better writing and some solid chopping would have done wonders. 

What I don't get is how this is a perfect 10 in so many peoples eyes. For me, this is a very good story told in a disappointing way. 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm maybe I should look into True Detective then. I've heard interesting stuff about it before as well.

I could see Monster getting scored 10s but I also don't think 10/10 represents perfection since there's no such thing in any media. Even with some pacing issues I don't think there was any filler in the anime. All the different characters and side stories were interesting and fleshed out the setting. The cities Tenma visited weren't some empty, generic, soulless places. To me the long journey was well worth it. It was believable and unique in ways that most anime are not.
>> ARTICLE
It's amazing. Like others say, it's slow paced at times but its highs are incredible. Every one goes through their own fair share of development, and while I won't say I end up liking every character, my opinions vastly changed over the course of the show. The atmosphere is also just something else. It's not scary in the traditional sense, rather the main antagonist along with this anime's very much sinister tone leaves you in a feeling of dread.
>> ARTICLE
it's as good as a serious thriller can get in anime form. 

but frankly i prefer pluto and 20th century boys over monster.
>> ARTICLE
I'll have to keep those in mind after I'm done with Monster. Is there an anime adaptation of Pluto?
>> ARTICLE
> Is there an anime adaptation of Pluto?

Nope, wish there was though. 
>> ARTICLE
Its great but its very very slow paced a lot of people gives up on the first 20+ episodes but if you stick by it  to the end   you would be rewarded on one of the best anime's of all time. The manga is better paced so if you like manga's try that instead but the story is the same.

Also in my opinion Johan Liebert is the greatest Main villain of all time(Hell the whole show is named after him !)


>> ARTICLE
I've been trying to decide whether to watch or read. I guess I'll go with read!
>> ARTICLE
One of the best shows I've watched, with one of the creepiest villains. Definitely would recommend watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Really good, and really slow. If you expect something important happening every episode, you're going to have a bad time.  If you're prepared to be patient the reward is fantastic.  Monster might feel a bit difficult to get through, but it will leave a lasting impact.
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to put into words just what's so good about Monster. I  guess I like the psychological and moral themes it brings up. There is some seriously creepy stuff all the while staying realistic, making good use of recent historical events and the european setting.

If you want sort of a stamp of quality, few years ago HBO and Guillermo del Toro announced plans for a live action adaptation. Too bad that everything related to GDT is forever cursed to rot in pre-production limbo or gets cancelled.
>> ARTICLE
One of the few shows I gave a 10,amazing story and even more amazing characters,I could easily fill my favorite characters list just from Monster alone

Naoki Urasawa is a brilliant writer, he knows how to do thrillers and keep you intrigued to the last moment,his mysteries unfold gradually in a way that makes sense (with a proper amount of suspension of disbelieve),there aren't many shocking out of nowhere twists,only a larger plot unfolding a little by little
>> ARTICLE
It was good in the beginning, the first 10 episodes or so, and then it slowed down, the pacing was really bad but not awful, in the end nothing is resolved, we still don't understand a certain character and that character just leaves without the show giving us any resolve. It's like they just tried to entertain us episode through episode without thinking about the ending and the plot. 
>> ARTICLE
Thought provoking story with an ending I diagree with rather than dislike it
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed it. Some parts were very well done
>> ARTICLE
I found out about Monster because I was looking for shows that people said were similar to Death Note. Unfortunately it wasn't really all that similar. 

If I were to rate it compared to other animes I saw, I think I'd rate it somewhere in the middle. It has enough to keep you going, but you're not likely to see many episodes in a single run, because its pacing is slow and it isn't all that entertaining.

To keep spoilers to a minimum, it's about a doctor that gets wrongly accused of a murder and is forced to become a fugitive for most of the show. He moves from place to place, trying to hunt down the criminal who actually did the deed he was wrongly accused for.

In the meantime, a detective, who is convinced the doctor is the murderer, follows the trail of the real murderer in order to find the doctor. A lot of the show will be about the doctor moving around from place to place, saving people, and getting prepared to face the murderer. There's even a whole episode where he trains to shoot a gun, skipping rope for hand to eye coordination and stuff like that.

During all this time, the aforementioned murderer is having loads of fun, psychologically manipulating people into killing each other. If there's anything I'd recommend this show for, it's the realism and the main villain. His backstory only gets fully revealed towards the end, but it's a pretty damn good one.
>> ARTICLE
It's got a great dubbed cast, at least for doctor Tenma and lunge, and it's really easy on the eyes. I haven't finished it yet (around 40) but so far i've really liked it. My only grievance is that it's hard to remember the spiderweb of character's interactions, various locations, and times, which can be confusing sometimes.

>> ARTICLE
Honestly it's pretty solid in every aspect however it's not that entertaining. It has the same feel as death note I'm just not as excited by it and it's extremely drawn out. 


>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
To me honestly it's just a more complex but boring version of Death Note, while both are amazing in there own right Monster just didn't grab me as much as other thrillers, like if I wanted that kind of thing I'd just watch True Detective. 
>> ARTICLE
True, depending on your preferences regarding pacing. Monster goes at a sedate, fairly realistic pace, but does on occasion lose its way, if you will.

I remember thinking when I watched it that it had a little bit of a bad habit of going off on a tangent, can't remember anymore exactly where. A bit tighter focus about halfway through or so would have helped cut down the number of episodes without sacrificing quality, I think... But I can't back any of this up seeing as it's been a while since I watched it. 
>> ARTICLE
I have no problem with the pacing/tempo of the series in general, my problem is with the actual plot development. Of the 30 hours you spend on this, around 15 of them are attributed to happenings irrelevant for the main story. Let's be real here, I know you are fans of anime and all, but using 70 episodes to tell this story is unforgivable.
 
>> ARTICLE
>not that entertaining

I'd have to disagree. I found Monster extremely riveting and engaging when I first watched it, and it still stands at the spot of my favorite anime I've watched.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly a personal favorite!
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely fantastic.  There simply aren't any other psychological thrillers in the medium that compares to it.  Adding to that, it is probably the least anime anime I've ever seen.  It follows none of the standard tropes, and the feel is completely foreign to most anime audiences.  Do not be surprised if you see a live-action remake on HBO at some point or another that knocks it out of the park.
>> ARTICLE
Watched Monster almost exactly one year ago, and it remains my favorite anime of all time. People like to call Monster "boring" and "not that entertaining" but the exact opposite was true for me. It just depends on what kind of shows you generally like. It's a lot more talky and the action is sparse, but the narrative is compelling and mysterious, the soundtrack and setting are both excellent, and the ending is both chilling and conclusive. 
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people seem to enjoy it. I see talked about quite often. I feel like I need to pick it up as well.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen this show referenced quite a bit. Quick MAL search for 'Monster' came up with a lot of hits. Are we talking about [this?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster)

Worth a 74 episode watch?
>> ARTICLE
This series scores close to 9 on user votes, but to use an exhausted expression, this is just circlejerking. I simply don't get why people are making so many allowances for anime's to make bad judgements on story telling and focus where the real screen would've gotten slaughtered. Are all the (bland) parallel stories OK because it's anime? Is it OK that they spoon-feed every tiny bit of development through flashbacks and monologue yet continualy refuse to explain the mental state of the main villain? What are his beliefs and motivations? Let us carefully explain to you which temperature Nina served the coffee at when she was 16 years old working at a resturant instead.  

This show wants to be taken seriously as an investigative crime drama, so please judge is as that and not as a standard anime. 

In a parallel universe where this show aired as a real screen, how would you have like it? 

>> ARTICLE
yes and yes, if you like serious shows

 fantastic story with a great set of characters,each complex,different and unique, in a very realistic environment and brilliant atmosphere.

some find it too slow for their taste, I didn't, I enjoyed all of it even the parts that some people find to be boring.
>> ARTICLE
Its really good, but kinda slow. I gave up on ep.25 and started reading the Manga.
>> ARTICLE
It's incredible. It wasn't the most enjoyable show ever to watch the first time, but after watching a ton of series afterwards, this always stood tall as one of the best series I have ever watched (in any medium), and after understanding alot more of the story after finishing it, reading the manga and rewatching the anime is so enjoyable. Truly one of the greats, enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
Good anime but the manga is WAYY better than the anime 
>> ARTICLE
As someone whose favorite genres are mysteries and psychological thrillers, Monster is my go-to example for everything I look for when I say that.

It does a very good job portraying human emotion too, with a wide variety of characters. There are quite a few shifts in focus. Since the plot is carried so well throughout, I was hooked by the end of the first "arc" and enjoyed the entire thing. It's definitely a favorite.
>> ARTICLE
One of only three anime I've given a 10.


>> ARTICLE
I started it around a week ago. I'm currently at episode 27. It's been pretty good so far. The settings/characters have been mostly realistic except that some of them are *Fucked.* *Up.*
>> ARTICLE
One of the only 4 animes I have given a perfect 10. One of the best stories I have ever seen even if the end is sort of a "oh, well ok then" kind of ending. Dr Tenma is one of my favorite characters of all time, to me he is the epitome of human kindness. I'm going to MTAC this year and my first ever cosplay is going to be him.
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently watching it. It isn't something that I'm marathoning but I enjoy watching an episode or five every three weeks.

One of the best written anime ever created.

Monster's absolutely fantastic. It grabbed me from the first episode and didn't let go until it was all over. It was an all around excellent story. It just makes me wish someone would adapt Nobuo Uematsu's other stuff.

I feel as though its a severely under-rated anime.

I finished it.  I really disliked it, but it seems the majority opinion is quite favorable.  In that case, you should probably watch it.

What did you dislike about it if I may ask?
>> ARTICLE
The build up of a certain storyline then they switch to a different one before its resolved. Animation and music were average to me. The biggest problem is I just didn`t like Johann and he is the reason the show is so well liked. I dropped it twice and then finally pushed all of the way through and the ending was not good in my opinion.  I was expecting to like it also. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, for starters the ending was pretty horrible. I can't imagine how doctor Tenma could have been any dumber.
>> ARTICLE
the ending was so dumb. and im a fan of a show
>> ARTICLE
Here's a comment I made on this a while ago:

Monster
I watched this for the first time recently and was pretty disappointed despite slogging it al the way to the end. I can see why it would have gone down well upon release, but it's rather dated now: it is very episodic at times, the plot and characters are sometimes pretty contrived in order to follow the ideas of the author and the plot relies on the principal characters bumping into each other by accident again and again. Overall I felt that it was to be lauded for its ambition and tone but that it falls well short of its goals and pretends to be a grown up story rather than actually being one.
>> ARTICLE
There isn't much to say, it's Good. An anime that doesn't rely on cheap comedy and stupid "waifus". It has a story, a good setting and characters that are ACTUAL characters not just mere archetypes.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty good, tastes a bit better than Red Bull
>> ARTICLE
A must watch for anyone willing to take anime seriously 
>> ARTICLE
Monster is fucking great and one of the best arguments to shut up morons who go "Anime isn't art".
>> ARTICLE
Its was good but it was WAY too slow so i dropped it at episode 24
>> ARTICLE
I dropped it after the first episode... *but not because it was bad in any way.*

Like most people do with anime, I read a quick summary of Monster's plot. It sounded like a great show, it really did. However, I found myself predicting everything that was going to happen *due to the fact that I had read the summary.* For me, the summary ruined the mystery of the watching the first episode  where the plot unfolds itself for the audience. My suggestion is to watch it blind, this goes for anyone considering Monster.

**TL;DR: This is an anime you should go into blind.**

Scene from To Love Ru Darkness. I think it's episode 12 but not 100% sure. S2 of TLR: Darkness is currently airing but I'd suggest holding off until the uncensored version is out.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so, here an **personal** assesement of the whole to Love Ru Shebang including TLR: Darkness.

The first season is mindbendingly dull even when big things happen. It starts promising but the promise gets never fullfilled.
It is somewhat passable though.

The second season was the first anime show that ever made me skip trough the episodes and made fanservice really, REALLY grindingly awfull. I never was really a fan of fanservice (Ha!) but this show kills it and that in the negative meaning of the word. 
IT IS THE WORST. IT IS THE MOST LOW TO AWFULL QUALITY NONSENSE. NOTHING EVER HAPPENS. 

To Love Ru again has some promise and it kinda looks good, but it is full with awfull writing like for example what is suppossed to be the main characters FIANCEE is BARELY IN IT. Oh yeah and the main character cheats on her with her sister.
There are potentially interesting characters in it, but by that point most of what feels good only feels good because everything else feels really, really awfull or because it speaks to the basic human instincts (besides the "Oh my God they look like children, RUN AWAY!" But by now you have probably goten used to that. :-P ).

TL:DR: First Season: intersting start but fizzles out bland as heck.
Second Season: AVOID like the plague, makes fanservice a boring grind. Really, really stupid.
Third Season: Softporn, some promising characters, especially those that seem to bring on some pressure to the proceedings, some good, mostly nothing happens. 
BARELY ANY TO NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.

>> ARTICLE
There are meta-reasons for this. The author had a nasty breakup with his wife, of which Haruna was based on. This is part of the reason the series originally concluded. When he began Darkness, he then switched the focus away from Lala (who honestly, is really boring) and Haruna (she 'triggers' him or something?), and focused more on fan favorite characters like Mikan, Momo, and Yami.
>> ARTICLE
This still doesn't make the writing less bad. :-(

Sadly, because i actually liked the premisse, even if it was cheesy and kitchy. :-P

>> ARTICLE
I don't know exactly what he's thinking and I cba to watch the rest of the video, but I do have a few guesses. 

* He could mean that he isn't attracted to black guys, which is as common (maybe even moreso) in gay communities as it is in straight communities. I see lots of grindr profiles stating their racial preferences, and it's often "white guys only" or just white-passing guys (i.e. latino or middle eastern but caucasian facial structure). I most commonly see "not into black guys or asians."
* Society, and the media especially, portray black men (and PoC in general) as more aggressive/masculine, so with that stereotype in mind he doesn't see how that can fit with the stereotype of the more feminine/less aggressive gay man.

Depends. In this show it also depends per species; lamia and harpy are both female-only monster races. And mer-men are reverse mermaids, big fish with legs.  But male centaurs are definitely a thing. They're portrayed as singularly brutish and unattractive though. 
>> ARTICLE
I think they're more like [Deep Ones](http://www.gwthomas.org/deeponetop.jpg) than mermen

**LEGS SHAKING FURIOUSLY**
>> ARTICLE
That leg spasm 
>> ARTICLE
I know what that is, I also am constantly moving my legs involuntarily in the same fashion... I don't know how it works but it happens I don't even notice unless people call me out on it.

I also don't get tired from doing that
>> ARTICLE
I do it too. Oddly enough, I find that it happens because I'm applying a downward pressure with the tip of my foot
>> ARTICLE
I actually developed it because there's a shitload of rivers where I used to live in Suzhou, which meant a lot of prime mosquito breeding ground. And a leg in motion is bitten less than a leg in stasis, so yeah.

It annoys people. I like it more because of that now.
>> ARTICLE
90% of the time sitting down I'm doing it. I think its cause I'm a very active person who works out, but I sit for so many hours of the day like in class, studying, eating, computer, that I just have to do it because of the pent up energy in me. Sometimes when studying for long hours it gets to the point where I have to furiously do squats for 10 min until I'm actually able to sit still enough to focus. Also in my morning lecture I'll spend most of the time holding my foot in the air. Its very tiring but works the muscles in my leg enough that it actually feels better afterward. I'm sure in 10 years when I have less energy I'll stop.
>> ARTICLE

I like ecchi anime because it has some of the best corny cliche humor around and sometimes the art isn't too bad.

I understand that. Based on the downvotes I assume that my original comment came across as if I was knocking people who do enjoy the show's content, which wasn't my intention. In fact, I enjoy the humorous aspects of the show. However, unlike TessHKM who commented below, for some reason I have not been able to come to terms with the monster girl fetish. My comment was more of an attempt at questioning why this particular fetish is so unappealing to me; whereas most people who view this show enjoy it/have no issues with it. Looking back at my previous comment, I now realize it was a pretty piss poor attempt at expressing what I was thinking.

So I'm German, and this is the least *anime* anime I have ever watched. I feel like I may have a bit of a worthwhile perspective on this series based on having been alive (albeit young) during the time period portrayed in Monster, and having spent my life in this same society.

In most cases when anime characters are German or speak German or whatever, it's either completely clichd or irrelevant enough to basically not matter. Monster, though, is almost like watching a local TV series from that time. The way the show portrays late 80s/early 90s Germany, especially its dirty underbelly, is so spot-on that it adds a completely new level of uncanny for any German viewer.

If you have watched this show and you find that this particular aspect of it has left you with an itch needing to be scratched, let me namedrop the long-running German crime-themed movie series [Tatort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatort), which is (or used to be, according to long-time fans/hipsters) much more of a talky character drama than a shooty action thriller like your average CSI Miami. You may be able to find a few of them with English subtitles, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9C750C8B61FF3DFA) (unfortunately it's a more recent one, being from 2010, but it's the first one with subtitles that I came across).

AMA about Monster-era Germany, while keeping in mind that I was like 5 at the time.

Edit: [The NY Times article linked on Wikipedia about Tatort](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/arts/television/27abroad.html?_r=0) is actually quite good.
>> ARTICLE
Not really about the anime. So does Germany's pride as a country or nation come back at that time? I'm curious how the Germans view them selves in Monster-era Germany.
>> ARTICLE
Well, to begin with, Germany's reunification only happens a few years before Monster's main plot, and people were still grappling with the overarching national identity after having been seperated into two countries for decades.

Casual patriotism is a very new thing in Germany, the world cup of 2006 is often seen as a turning point in common consciousness where it was for the first time widely accepted to fly the flag from your house, your car and so on. Monster is 10 years prior to that. On the flip side, there are still many people born before WW2, and while vocal public patriotism is largely frowned upon, there is assumed to be a large number of "closet nationalists" (a common sentiment, at least in hushed tones among friends, used to be "If only Hitler hadn't attacked Russia, we could have won the war and everything would have turned out fine"), providing ample breeding grounds for nationalistic groups operating in the shadows. But sentiments that people would utter out loud in public at the time were at most closer to things like "we Germans have a rich cultural heritage, and now that we are also politically reunited, it's time to figure out our place in the modern times."

tl;dr: Pride, kinda, yes, but not in the way someone in America would probably think.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. Did their victory last year in the World Cup help?
>> ARTICLE
It didn't make a big difference in my eyes. There were lots of flags around again, and maybe the people critical of them were slightly less numerous and received slightly more eye rolling than in 2006, but I didn't see a fundamental difference.
>> ARTICLE
The "real monster" being the twins' mother was such a goddamn good twist and really poignant. This series definitely gets a 10/10 from me, especially with how fantastic the last episodes are. 

it's a shame we don't see more anime of this same cloth as this one more....
>> ARTICLE
I'd argue the real monster is not the mom. If you think about the position she was placed in (can u truly blame her?)...plus all criminals were given a reasonable back story to their actions. Which makes me think that: The author meant the real monster is a presence within anyone able to consume ones (natural) good personal values and personality transforming them into the monster within. (munch munch - chomp chomp - gobble gobble!). Which makes Tenma so interesting because he stuck to his values through all that to the end. Showing in the authors perspective what it means to succeed against the 'monster'. Further at the end, having Yohan escape to me at least is symbolic that the monster is never dead... and that its humanities duty to fight it on a daily basis.

But I personally also LOVED the twist! And agree masterpieces of this kind are extremely rare.
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely empathize with the mom and that situation. What really shocked Johan I think, however, was the fact that she couldn't tell him and Nina apart.  
>> ARTICLE
Haha! It feels weird being thanked personally in the OP for participating in a rewatch discussion.

The final episodes felt like a roller coaster. I'll just post my reaction notes to the final episodes for the time being. I need a day or two to mull over what I just saw, write up my analysis, and form an opinion on Monster as a whole.

---

**Episode 71: Grimmer**

* Lunge vs Roberto (the machine vs smooth assassin). Who will win? I get the feeling that Lunge will get ambushed.

* Holy cow, Grimmer walked out unarmed in front of a house full of crazy gunmen. I can't decide if that was ridiculously stupid or ridiculously ballsy. 

* GRIMMER, NOOOOOO!!! 

[](#chiho-wut)

* ...Grimmer's end was incredibly well done. The emotions...him becoming human again...I hate to say it, but it feels appropriate how Grimmer's story ended. 

---

**Episode 72: Nina's Memories and Lunge's Fight**

* LUNGE, NOOOOOO!!! DON'T DIE LIKE THAT!

* Oh, so Poppe *did* steal the mom's name by killing everyone who knew her. I guess he "gave back her name" by not killing any more people who knew her. And I was right, the letter was about unrequited love. Poppe wasn't the husband or lover as I had thought though.

* LUNGE, YOU'RE ALIVE!! THANK GOD YOU'RE SMART WITH A GUN!

* Wait, Roberto is seeing Lunge's wife? And he's like a grandfather to Lunge's grandson!? Shiiiit, that's messed up. Maybe he's making it up. 

* Roberto used to be Grimmer's friend at Kinderheim! Fuuuck, they'll never get to have their reunion over hot cocoa...It would have been really interesting to see how they would react to each other.

* Lunge makes an awesome badass, fighting off Roberto like that. Lunge sticking out his tongue while being choked looked silly though. I couldn't stop thinking of frogs and toads.

* Gotta love how they animated Nina remembering stuff...I was nervous that she would go crazy and attack the criminologist again.

---

**Episode 73: Climax**

* There's no way Johan will die by Poppe's hand. It doesn't suit the story...yup, Roberto shot Poppe instead. Wait, ROBERTO!? There's no way Lunge could've died. I'm sure of it.

* SERIOUSLY!? Poppe's ominous hand reaching out from the darkness wasn't ominous after all. This ENTIRE TIME, he was just reaching out to caress Nina's cheek!! Wooow, after all the times we've seen that white hand in the OP and in Nina's flashbacks too. Oh shit! Does this mean that Bonaparta killed all those people with wine in order to save the twins from even more experimentation!?

* The stare-off between Johan and Tenma was amazing. I'll have to figure out the meaning behind Johan and Tenma in a desolate land.

* Nina suddenly wants to forgive Johan! Again, this will require some analysis. What exactly changed Nina's mind? Why did Poppe's words to Nina as a child hold so much weight?

* WTF TENMA SHOT JOHAN?? Oh, it was actually someone else. WTF, A MINOR SIDE CHARACTER KILLS JOHAN!?!? That's can't be right...maybe Johan can be saved with brain surgery again. 

* OH MY GOD, I WAS RIGHT!! 

[](#ohmygod)

* Well then, I sort of saw this coming. I said a LONG time ago that it would be neat if Dr. Tenma ends up performing brain surgery on Johan again because it would make nice symmetry to the beginning of the show. But *really?* Johan survives getting shot in the head *twice*?? That's stupendously lucky. Although, considering Johan's background, he's also led a reaally unlucky life.

* I can't believe Lunge left Roberto unconscious without tying him up. I'm also surprised that Roberto didn't just kill Lunge. Simply knocking Lunge unconscious feels out of character for him.

* How can Dr. Tenma, a criminal fugitive, be allowed to perform brain surgery? There must be a shit ton of red tape to deal with.

* So Poppe is officially dead now?

---

**Episode 74: Resolution**

* Eva: "People are so strange. Sadness fades away and only happy memories remain." That *is* strange now that I think about it. Although, regret could be a counterpoint to that; sometimes regret never fades away.

* Lunge gives Grimmer one last beer. The death flag was actually for Grimmer :(

* Lol, "Munster University" offered Tenma a job as a professor.

* So much for seeing Lunge reconnect with his grandson. He's on the right path though, finally getting to know his own daughter.

* The mom: "Who is the real monster?" That is *such* a loaded question. To answer that, we would have to discuss philosophy.

* Nice to see Nina is back to her old happy life. Has her character changed though? Probably. It's too bad that we don't know what her thesis was about. That was a missed opportunity to tie it in with everything that's happened in Monster.

* Whoa! Johan still knows how to be creepy even when he's in a coma! "That time...when the monster appeared in front of me." Who is the monster that appeared before Johan? Is the monster his mom, the memory of his sister being taken away, Poppe, betrayal, or something else? I'd say it's open to interpretation.

* The flashback of the mom and twins was powerful. 

* "Don't let go of my hand." I see a connection between the twins telling their mom that, and the mom telling the man she loved the same thing (I think it was her who said it. Maybe it was the man). I think there's an overarching symbolic theme behind hands. I'll analyze it later.

* "Which one of us was the unwanted one?" HHMMMMMmmmmm....This would require some thought. I wonder if the mom's right hand, or what the twins said had something to do with her decision. When Tenma was talking to the mom, she was staring at her right hand--the hand that let go of Nina.

* Tenma knows Nina and Johan's real names. Again with the names! I wonder what Johan's real name means to Johan symbolically. Would it change him if he knew it? Did Tenma tell Johan his real name in that brief moment of silence?

* Johan escapes the hospital again, just like in the beginning of the show. Nina forgave him. Does he go on another killing spree or not? 

WHAT!! THAT WAS IT!?!? It's SO open ended! I have so many unanswered questions! I still have theories that were neither confirmed nor denied! *sigh* I'll have to really think it through after all. I'm disappointed that we don't get to see the mom reunite with the twins, Nina having better closure with Johan, and Tenma's reasoning for saving Johan's life. Right now, it feels like the show's message or moral is fuzzy. Sure, it was decided that Johan's life was worth saving, but was it really for the best? He escaped and could cause even more deaths. 

Despite my gripes with the show, I'd say Monster has been great if only for the brilliant poignant moments sprinkled throughout. That's the gist of my opinion for now. It could change after mulling it over. 
>> ARTICLE
> Roberto used to be Grimmer's friend at Kinderheim! Fuuuck, they'll never get to have their reunion over hot cocoa...It would have been really interesting to see how they would react to each other.

It seems interesting to me to compare their recollections of that experience. Grimmer's memory centred on Roberto sharing the one luxury they ever had with him, but Roberto only remembered the cocoa itself. Unless my memory is as ruined as theirs, anyway.

They seem to have been used to look at two sides of the same idea. Both are essentially sociopathic, but Grimmer devoted himself to making others happy anyway. Robertos many sex scenes and the general pleasure he seems to get out of his life imply he made it to his 40s as a self-centred hedonist. Johan showed up, gave him the cocoa and recreated the memory, and from then on hes devoted to the guy.

They learned different lessons from the abusive orphanage. A memory showing the basic decency of humanity contrasted with one showing a life of misery broken only by the occasional pleasure. Quite a shame, really, since Roberto was the one who made the decent gesture.

If their lives were defined by such a minor difference in memory, it'd be quite the shame. Still, Johan's final scene deals with the same issue, so I'm inclined to think they were written that way intentionally.

It's always nice when a show gives you this much to think about. And as you said, the poignant moments scattered throughout alone would be enough to make it great. Oddly enough, the one that sticks out to me a week later is Peter apek's death wondering what the point of half his life was while staring out at that desolate place.

>> ARTICLE
> Wait, Roberto is seeing Lunge's wife? And he's like a grandfather to Lunge's grandson!? Shiiiit, that's messed up. Maybe he's making it up.

Heh, somehow I didn't pick up on it, I thought he implied that he was observing his family, so it felt more like a threat to me. Now I'm wondering.

> I can't believe Lunge left Roberto unconscious without tying him up. I'm also surprised that Roberto didn't just kill Lunge. Simply knocking Lunge unconscious feels out of character for him.

He knew he was too awesome to kill :P

> WHAT!! THAT WAS IT!?!? It's SO open ended! I have so many unanswered questions! I still have theories that were neither confirmed nor denied! sigh I'll have to really think it through after all.

That's what I love about such endings, they leave a lot to interpretation. Makes you dwell on the show longer ;)
>> ARTICLE
I like the callback they did to the very first scene of the series, and how it establishes why some people were truly terrified of Johan.

https://imgur.com/loeZng9.png

So clearly everyone who was afraid of Johan...was just drunk off their asses!

[](#kukuku)
>> ARTICLE
I assume the desolate landscape with Tenma is supposed to parallel Johan crossing the German-Czech border with Nina. Johan has stated that he remembered seeing "the end" at that time, so it's only appropriate that he should return here when his "true end" finally arrives. The desolation does suit the idea of wiping away the memory of himself in his "perfect suicide".

This time however, It's Tenma he's ending things with. It's originally the spot of the separation of the Monsters with no name, and it is now the end of the story where the Monster will have no one with which to share his new identity.
>> ARTICLE
Great observation! So I guess that imagery was a hypothetical scenario where Johan successfully killed everyone who knew him. Because only then would the story of the Monster without a name *really* fit. Karl, Schuwald, the apprentice, Nina and others who remember Johan are still alive. If Johan wasn't shot there, who knows what would've happened to those people.

The German-Czech border is also where General Wolfe found the twins and gave Johan his name. So the location also represents where the person, "Johan", was born. A fitting location for his "perfect suicide" indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you all for the rewatch, especially /u/johnnywup for organizing it. It was great that you had the motivation to post these thread regularly and come up with some questions to discuss ;) I learned about this rewatch quite randomly and Im glad I jumped in, otherwise *Monster* could get stuck on my PTW indefinitely. It was really helpful to have some steady pace and I think having to discuss the episodes made the whole experience deeper :D

I had some trouble sorting all my thoughts on the show, since there's so much to discuss, so I decided to focus on the characters I found most important. It's a bit of a long read, but I hope you'll find some parts interesting and it doesn't sound too much like an essay ;p
 
** **
**Dr Tenma**
Arguably, the closest we get to the MC, though I still think *Monster* is mainly Johan's story. Tenma didn't change that much in the end  it turns out he stayed true to his values. Would he shot Johan if not for Wim's father's intervention? Hard to say, but it's a good thing for him it didn't happen. He's the kind of man who would never forgive himself and always wonder what he could've done differently. That's what he did with his first surgery on Johan, after all.

Quite surprising ending, with Johan surviving again and Tenma having to operate him! I don't think I'd be able to do that. Apparently, that's the question Tenma had to answer during the course of the show  are all human lives equal? Tenma's answer is 'Yes.' That's an idealistic stance, but perhaps one fitting for a doctor. The last scene  Johan's escape?  only adds impact to his decision. Maybe he was wrong, but even knowing that, he probably would have done the same.

**Johan**
The real hero of the show. I don't think we can understand his actions completely, but his last monologue may have been crucial (at least if we assume it wasn't Tenma's daydream). He always wondered whether he was the unwanted child, and that along with his experiences in 511 Kinderheim broke him. There's also his mother's wish  'If I don't kill you, the children growing inside me will.' If we accept supernatural explanations, maybe that wish somehow got imprinted on Johan.

Johan's name is important, too. I think growing up without real identity made him somehow angry on people who had it, and that's why he wanted to take it away from them. If he didn't deserve it, they didn't either. Learning his true name from Tenma could bring him some closure, but I think the last scene shows it was too late  he escaped, so he probably wanted to continue living like before. Maybe he didn't see another way, being a 'monster' his whole life.

**Nina**
Her being the one taken to the Red Rose Mansion was one of the biggest surprises of the show. Somehow, she managed to forget these memories and grow up to be a fairly normal person, which is seriously amazing. I wonder if she'll want to meet her biological mother at some point.
In contrast to Tenma, her chase of Johan was really just to understand what had happened, to uncover the full story of her childhood and bring her some closure. I really think that forgiving Johan was more important to her than to him - not to downgrade her actions, of course.

**Mr. Grimmer and Roberto**
An example proving the thesis that 'humans can become whatever they want.' I don't have much sympathy for Roberto, though I can understand why he would grow up to be a person he had become. Grimmer, on the other hand, managed to make a lot of people happy, even though he had to force himself to feel any emotion. I grew to like him and though I was prepared to see him die, it was quite a tearjerker.

**Inspector Lunge**
I said previously that he was my best guy, right? :D It's partly because I have a thing for exceptional detectives, but his transformation throughout this show was amazing. At first, he was an ambitious workaholic. Then, he was threatened with losing his position and started to become obsessed, losing his reason, but he fortunately regained it after deciding to doubt his own judgment for once. Then, he finally had his moment of truth in the last episodes. I seriously consider his apology to Tenma one of the most impactful scenes of the show. He may not be able to put his family relations back in order, but through this whole ordeal, he became a better man.

**Eva**
Another amazing psychological journey. At the beginning of the show, many people here called her a bitch, and I admit I was no better, but I understood all too well what she was going through. Not everyone has the strength of Grimmer to overcome life's various obstacles and emerge unscathed. Eva appeared cynical and hateful, but she had to experience a real turmoil inside. I'm glad her story received a happy ending, especially because I believe most of us can relate to her on some plane.

** **
Now I wonder if the manga ends in the same way, maybe it's a good idea to read it someday. As I said once before, my problem with *Monster* was the lack of relatable characters in the first half, but it improved towards the end. Not to mention that the story was amazingly well done, and the long journey made for a satisfying ending. It was nice experiencing it with you all :>
>> ARTICLE
im 2 months late, but didnt johan kill those 2 random old people that they met at this farm before he even went to 511 kinderheim?
>> ARTICLE
You know, I'll tell you frankly. At this point, I don't even remember anymore :P Somebody should make a timeline for this.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, the manga ends the same way, but I highly recommend checking out the author's other mystery series [20th Century Boys](http://myanimelist.net/manga/3/20th_Century_Boys) and [Pluto](http://myanimelist.net/manga/745/Pluto). 

Also, really enjoyed reading what you thought on the characters. Personally, Grimmer was my favorite, probably because he sorta reminded me of Vash the Stampede, they're both fun loving guys with some heavy baggage they tend to hide. Also, it helped reading your thoughts on what may have "created" Johan as a killer.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. 20th Century Boys is the best manga I've read and I think everyone that enjoyed Monster will love this. Can't say about Pluto though because I haven't read it yet...
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, it's good to know it was appreciated :D

Reeeally hoping for that HBO adaptation now, this series was fantastic!

Crap, I'm still on episode 67, gotta catch up today! I've heard the ending's great!
>> ARTICLE
There was a little mini doc on Urusawa that talked about how he didn't end 20 century boys with the ending people wanted... But with what he wanted. His editor actually strongly protested the ending. I think monster's ending really goes against expectations as well. Urusawa has incredible vision for his stories... And he obviously plans them well ahead. It's refreshing for an author to dedicate themselves so fully to their vision, no matter what others desire. It's what makes him my favorite storyteller.

That's really cool. Only watched bits and pieces but [is it this video?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtjZdO2l_84)

Yepp!  Urusawa is an inspiration to me as a storyteller. I have no idea how he plans such intricate plots.

This was a blast the whole way through, at first I was scarred away by how many episodes the show had but very few felt slow.
Great show.

I didn't understand one thing though. Did Nina develop feelings for Tenma by the end of the series?

She loves him as a *father figure*, they have like a 20 year age difference dude...

Yeah, that's what I thought 
>> ARTICLE
Such an eerie and chillingly realistic show. A must-watch, assuming you can handle the slower pace
>> ARTICLE
What I did was just read the manga, and switch to the anime whenever there's an intense scene/episode. The anime is so faithful to the manga, that alternating between them to deal with the slow pacing worked out pretty well. But I guess that method is only for people who like manga, too.
>> ARTICLE
The appeal with "Monster" wasn't its climax, it was the journey. The climax, in my opinion, was actually rather weak in comparison, and was befuddled with ideas that didn't seem to hit its mark for me.

Also, don't expect coming into it that "Monster" is in the horror, or even suspense genre, or you'll be sorely disappointed, like I was. It's mostly just a crime mystery.

I respect what Monster is, and I understand the appeal it holds for so many people. I think it's quite a unique piece of work, and I don't believe we'll see one of its kind in a very long while yet, but I don't believe it's a masterpiece in any way.
>> ARTICLE
just waiting for the hbo adaption. it'll come someday
>> ARTICLE
My one caveat about the show is this: after the first dozen or so episodes, the series grinds almost to a halt for a while. After Tenma begins his journey proper, the show launches into an incredibly slow, repetitive arc of "Tenma meets his friend-of-the-week", where the same few points are hammered into the audience over and over again for about 10-14 episodes, with little actual progression of the main plot. 

Most (but not all) of the characters do play a role later in the story, so it's worth introducing them, but the way that the show becomes almost an episodic drama during that section isn't the best way to go about it. Once you're past that part, though, it does begin to settle back into being the mystery/thriller that it started off as.
>> ARTICLE
You took the words out of my mouth.  The only thing that intrigued me was how the MC would finish the Monster.  I wish the series was half as long.

I did finished the series but Monster doesn't have as many cliffhangers as i hoped for, especially since the series is so long.

Monster is a true masterpiece. 
>> ARTICLE
Monster was the first non-shonen anime that I've watched and I have very good memories of it, it was amazing. When you mentioned that it was 74 episodes, I was like "nah there's no way it felt more like 40ish episodes" but sure enough it is 74 episode. Wow!
>> ARTICLE
As did I!  Though I had already read the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Monster is one of those shows that I constantly hear is a classic. It's done by my fav studio and I definitely believe it is something I would like by it's description and genre. For some reason I haven't gotten to watching it yet though. I plan to change that in a few weeks!
>> ARTICLE
Masterpiece is the one word that comes to mind when someone mentions monster! It's the single anime that has threatened FMA:B as my favourite anime ever, and I loved that.
>> ARTICLE
Pacing "problems" huh...

Can't say I ever felt like it had that while watching Monster. Not once. Ever. It was exactly right for me. I finished watching the whole series in 1-2 weeks or so and it was fucking amazing. No episode felt like a waste of time. I haven't watched *that* much anime in total, but this is pretty much the only one that is 100% for sure a 10/10 for me. The other two are more like 9.5/10 or whatever.

Why do I get this feeling that people who can't stand Monster's pacing would also not like Umineko's (the visual novel, not the anime) pacing... well, both are masterpieces in my eyes.
>> ARTICLE
Same. The pacing was absolutely perfect. I don't understand the complaints about it. Every episode was amazing and a treat, every episode had me engaged completely...it's absolutely my favorite anime, and by a long shot.
>> ARTICLE
While I'm liking the show, I find that it's not something you can binge-watch. I watch about an episode every day or two...

74 episodes at 20 minutes an episode is 24 hours. Watching all of that in three days is pushing it a little, I think!

well, I'm at episode 25 now...will see if I will have the same.

Not something you can binge-watch? I watched the whole thing in the space of 5 days. AM I BROKEN?!

Sleeping for more than 3 hours disqualifies you action as being "binge-watch." And if you haven't held off your piss for at least 4 episodes then you really haven't binged it.

lol. Well it's 70+ episodes, so watching the series, eating and sleeping was all I was doing. I'm sorry, I don't have a shit-bucket. ;_;

As someone who has seen many of what people consider the best anime around: This is an absolute must watch show.

If you like quality, then Monster is for you
>> ARTICLE
>  If that doesnt excite you, then perhaps good taste is mythical after all.

> which is only proved if people can still dislike an anime I hold as highly as Monster.

I dislike *Monster* intensely.  I've never been a fan of horror/crime drama in any fashion, and this show did nothing to break me of that.  Before you ask, yes, I gave it a chance; some 20 episodes, to be exact, and it did absolutely nothing for me.

If that means you believe my taste is shit, so be it.  If that means I'M in the wrong, that's the way it'll have to be.  I'd much rather watch a meh show that entertains me than some legendary greatness that bores me to tears. 
>> ARTICLE
No, that's fine. :) Like I said in the edit, I meant to say there's no such thing as an objective "good taste".

What I would like to know though, is what you thought of Death Note, as a thriller/crime anime?
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed the live-action movie.  I sat through a dozen episodes of the anime with... um... it's not a series I'd much care to watch again.

Let me explain something... For many, many years, a friend of mine would come over for dinner, conversation and anime every Thursday night.  One of us would choose a series to watch, which we'd do until an endpoint was reached (or the series ended, whichever), then the other would choose.

That's how I saw *Monster* and *Death Note*... my friend wanted to watch them, and I wasn't going to say no to her.  Besides, I wouldn't have seen them otherwise, so why not?
>> ARTICLE
>EDIT: Just realized that the last sentence could be badly misconstrued. I didn't mean that if you dislikeMonsteryou have bad taste; rather, that the idea that there exists of a set of anime which dictates whether you have good taste or not is itself a myth, which is only proved if people can still dislike an anime I hold as highly asMonster. This was meant to be an ironic comparison to the earlier definition of "good taste" I hinted at in the first paragraph, but I guess I was being a bit too ambitious with my writing.damnpeasants


No no, you legitimately have shit taste if you can't recognize monster's  brilliance. 


>> ARTICLE
/r/anime tells me *everyone* legitimately has shit taste. Except me, of course. :P

Wholeheartedly recommending Monster as well. Though I'd say that the anime has some issues with the pacing at times, which is why I prefer the manga. A shame that Urasawa's other big works haven't gotten their anime adaption yet, even though Mappa does want to animate Pluto at some point.

>> ARTICLE
Yes I meant publishing and yes Billy Bat is looking great.
>> ARTICLE
Not really the biggest fan of Kenzo, because despite going through so much, he never really develops to the point where he does anything shocking or drastic. Once you get to know his character in the beginning, most of his actions become quite predictable (well, the end result, at least) throughout the story. The development of the side characters and their relevance to the plot was amazing, though. And this anime has a terrifying villain, for sure. 

Speaking of Urasawa's works, how the hell did 20th Century Boys never get an anime? I heard it got a live-action adaptation, but those usually don't stay faithful to the source material.

I was recommended Monster by a reviewer since I liked Deathnote and i was a little hesitant to watch it (like most anime), but I'm glad I did. I think i watched about 7 episodes the first day, and after those few episodes I was convinced that it was one of the best amines ever. This belief only grow as I kept watching it. I only wish that more ppl I know watch Monster, so far I have one friend that has. 
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: Also Madhouse aired Hajime no Ippo series too though.

Currently going through it at a slow pace of a handful of episodes per week (up to episode 14 now I think). I'm definitely getting the slow tense built up atmosphere that you mentioned. It's not an edge of the seat look forward to every next episode kind of anime, but I can see it building into something truly great. Might take me a while to finish but it's certainly drawing me into its world more and more. 
>> ARTICLE
Cool! I'm glad at least one section of the OP came close to accurately describing the show. :D Have fun with the watch!
>> ARTICLE
I am watching Monster right now (episode 41) and I am liking it so far. I can feel the slow pace but it doesn't bother me so much because there is always something new or because of the characters.

The only weird thing is as good as each episode is I am not feeling like watching the next right after. But I am curious where this journey is going.

I was about to write a [WT!] for Monster, but your post is great.

Only thing I disagree with is the dub. I watched it subbed and the emotions were just amazing. Then I went back and listened to the voices of the English voice actors, and it just didn't feel the same.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's a valid criticism of any dub, tbh. If you've watched *74 episodes* (i.e. *a long damn time*) associating a face to a certain voice, any other voice - especially another language - is going to sound odd and out of place. I thought subs were better than dubs for a long time because of that kind of thinking:

>Watch subs for show

>Watch dubs after I finish marathon

>Dubs don't sound like subs?

>Poop.

But after I started watching more dubs first, like Steins;Gate, I learnt they really can have a lot of quality.

Just saying that watching a show in one language entirely can skew your perspective on the other language, so be careful about that!
>> ARTICLE
That's a good point. I didn't think about it like that, but yeah you're totally right. Interesting. I'll give dubs a try at some point.

Either way, Monster is by far my favorite anime. Nothing's  come close to it for me.

All the yes. My mates wont watch it, thinking it's long and boring. The furthest one got was about three episodes before Johan came back.

"Good taste" has quotation marks for a reason. I know some people can't handle some shows, and that's perfectly fine. In fact, I'm expecting debates regarding Monster's quality in the comments, and specifically its pacing because it can be dreary to some. That's okay, though! I like debates, as long as they remain fun for everyone.

came across the "Monsterization" page, have to say this made me laugh:

>The physical changes of rockin' tits, flawless sensitive skin, and more importantly thirty foot tails or an ass the size of a wagon therefore do not prevent the immediate use of those attributes for sexy times.

Edit, also this part:

>To the casual bystander, monsterization usually involves a woman becoming substantially more attractive and then raping that bystander

Edit 2, the edit that keeps on giving

>In the current era, transformation into a monster girl is mostly accomplished by the various one-on-one methods mentioned previously: getting yuri raped by a succubus, having a parasite egg stuffed up your barren vagina, being mauled by a werewolf, etc.

Okayado is Inui Takemaru, the one who wrote these, originally wrote those NSFW shorts. You can even tell the character designs are nearly the same when he decided to fully adapt his shorts to his published work, Monster Musume.

An the thing is, it's not just a flat harem anime. It actually has some depth to it. 

In 12 episodes, they've managed to tackle issues on racism, sexism, and self esteem. At least that's how I saw it. 

Also it's a pretty funny show. There a very little anime that I laugh out loud at and this one is no exception. They made some cheeky references I liked as well

Something I've always wondered: How big are these scan-and-translate groups? Is it something like you and a couple friends, or a dozen random H enthusiasts with similar taste that group up to split the load and get translations out faster?
>> ARTICLE
You can actually just go to the credit page of each chapter to see how many people worked on it. Our group is a few members large. Scanlation isn't always big when it comes to hentai. We do share the same general preference. We are just random people working towards the same goal, getting out stuff we like and in a way help the artist get exposure. Also to contribute to the community. I know a bunch of other scanlators that are solo (tl, cleaning, redrawing) + sometimes a proofreader.

NSFW? More like not safe from FBI watchlist.

Ah yes, even more reasons to be off /r/all. No wonder people think watching anime is for perverts.

I think we're past arguing about that, now we just need to make people realize being a pervert is natural and okay.

Most of the time, yes. But IMO lolicons are right at that line, and others view it as being over it.

The official translation, Papi says "Boss." At this point it's about being consistent, English and Japanese don't always translate easily and boss was close enough.

I'll mention this to you, but comic posts are not allowed in this sub.

Edit: actually there is the potential now that this post will stay up thanks to the "Albums of 5 or more images" exception. I am not sure if that applies to comic post, but if that does then it leaves some potential for future comic post to this sub.

I think I'm good m8
>> ARTICLE
That is actually a good point, I have yet too see a comic survive a nuken, but all the ones I have seen nuked were just manga post, uploaded to illicit sites or had   less than five images in them. If this post survives the It will be the first time I have seen a comic make it through unscathed!
>> ARTICLE
My god, stop with the damn moderating stuff. You're not a mod, [one of the mods said they'd rather users not police for them and to simply report problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/46hgqq/anime_irl/d055jha?context=3) which was intended for you, and there's absolutely no need for it, just report it. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay let me state a few things: 

I don't think I am a mod, I do not have the ability to police this sub. Nor do I make any commands that people delete their post & such stuff. I do do notify people sometimes that they are potentially breaking the rules, sometimes advise them to edit their post when they are breaking say the spoiler rules or banned NSFW content rules to avoid removal before mod intervention. Some people also don't know they could in some instances that they can edit their removed post & potentially get it reinstated (which is great to salvage a  post if it has a lot of discussion going on in it before the removal), those users rarely get told about that possibility & usually don't know that it does exist.

I also don't see any down sides with telling people about these things  in a calm &/or friendly manor. I don't bother with people that are breaking the rules with malcontent (outside of reporting them), I don't do this with every single rule breaking post that isn't salvageable either. Those ones are just fine leaving to the mods. I even report the salvageable ones because they exist in a state that is breaking the rules & I report all posts that I suspect break the rules.

I am not doing this out of impotent rage, I am doing this because I want to help some of those submitters by clarifying some stuff or advising on a few things. You'd think all these comments & downvotes telling me "you are stupid for doing this because it is pointless & you don't need to do this because you don't wield any power" (of course I don't wield much power, I am not a mod) would get me down & to stop doing this. But the instances If I have helped people & the instances those people have thanked me has kinda make doing this worth it. It doesn't always happen, but when it does It is nice.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, you're taking this way too seriously.

Honestly though, mods contact people when their salvageable post has been removed to tell them what rule they broke, so they'll know how to fix it anyway.

You aren't adding any value.
>> ARTICLE
In the cases where a report will suffice and the user cannot fix their content, (like this), we would prefer just a report please. Especially if you're not certain of the rule, like in this case. Comics are allowed if they're 5 or more images, unless they're fanart, in which case we'd ask them to be posted as fanart. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright, then I guess I'll stop doing stuff on the totally unsalvageable posts then. 
>> ARTICLE
thanks

From someone who hasn't watched/read Monster Musume...

wtf

Over-sexualized much? 

So are people really this sexually repressed or is it from an anxiety making them unable to seek actual sexual attention? 

Real talk gents, there are nerdy anime and tech loving women out there who will fulfill your sexual desires in exchange for being treated decently and appreciated. 

And you're not going to get them by being socially retarded or using ignorant pick-ups you learned from watch japanese fantasy anime.

Socialize, put yourself into situations to meet people, reap the benefits.

Mujaki no Rakuen is borderline hentai but it's not actual porn, not sure about Rescue Me! but I'll assume that it's some OVA with sex scenes but isn't actually hentai too although I gotta say that's interesting that she got to voice her 3rd main character already even though the first two times it was for an OVA.

Well, it's mostly 3D CG animation in the form of a manga but it's still better than nothing. I like it to be honest (it's porn, as long as it's fappable).

OMG please don't be a censor fest. I don't have to patience to wait for the BD
>> ARTICLE
It most likely will be unless AT-X is being generous and airs it uncensored.
>> ARTICLE
That's the studio's decision. Dunno much about Lerche but it seems it's the first time they do one of these ecchi heavy shows, let's hope they do the right thing..
>> ARTICLE
That's not always the studio's decision or DxD would be airing uncensored on other channels too and Akame ga Kill! wouldn't had to use Nico Nico to show the uncensored episode.
>> ARTICLE
It can't air uncensored on other channels because they aren't paid cable like AT-X, it would be impossible no matter at what time it airs. The studio decides whether it lets AT-X air uncensored or not.

Akame ga Kill the only difference is they chose to make the deal with nico nico instead

I shouldn't say studio, more like the committee behind the show
>> ARTICLE
First time I've heard of that, TIL. In that case I just hope that they air it uncensored, I don't want a white version of Tokyo Ghoul.

Funny you say that because of all the (current) girls, she is probably the least likely to win. Unless they go harem end.

I have a feeling that the anime will end with a vague ending while the manga will go with a harem end, a vague ending, or snake girl ending.  I think the snake girl will win if there's only one girl picked because she's the first girl and was displayed the most in the PV.

Heck yea. Hoping rachnea [manga? spoils](/s "stays with him and doesnt move back with the other family. "). She will be getting [](/s "another ") another adventure with him eventually right?

haha, funny you getting downvoted. the series has about much plot as nisekoi, its straight up generic harem with a twist of funny monster girls.
>> ARTICLE
It actually deals with somewhat realistic problems on several points, such as how the houses and such has to be refit, what species can get along while some others have harder time, adjusting to new culture etc.
>> ARTICLE
Might be the cool down show of season for me. I'll give it a shot, I think.
>> ARTICLE
Why not both? 
>> ARTICLE
It's actually surprisingly good for "monster girl harem" stuff. 
>> ARTICLE
It's actually very good imo. Of course fan service is rampant but it only makes it funnier. Also unlike most harem shows the main character isn't a clueless piece of shit who doesn't notice that a million girls all want his dick.

Can confirm. Reading a harem which MC actually gets the hint is so goddam refreshing.

In a way it is. If you want to try to get an idea, maybe read the first chapter or so of the manga. It's hard to explain, yet it's awesome. :3
>> ARTICLE
It's a harem but it still has somewhat of a story and isn't just fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
So like dxd?
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, I think it's great for what it is. Considering other things in it's vein, it's quite good, but don't expect a deep enthralling story. You'll see a fairly well thought-out excuse for monster girls to exist and an imaginative world wherein they can co-exist with humans. 

I feel like people are kinda over-selling the story.  I think the manga is pretty good, but I would not cite the story as part of my reasoning.

While I'm as hyped (okay, much, much, *more* hyped) as the next person I can't help but feel like the characters looked a bit... weird in this PV. Huge fan of the manga so it's nothing to do with the character designs themselves - the proportions of face to body to ears etc seemed to keep shifting around throughout the PV - particularly with Miia.

Hmm, well, hopefully it's just my imagination or it'll be consistent when the show actually airs.

^\^Which ^is ^not ^soon ^enough.

I hope the opening sequence in the manga gets done well. Still one of my favourite parts of all ;)
>> ARTICLE
At first I was a little bit taken aback by the character designs and some of the voices, particularly best girl Miia's and Rachnee's. Miia in particular didn't sound anything like I thought she would, most of her dialogue makes you think she'd have a girly nasal voice. But I must say, I'm rather pleasantly surprised by Miia's voice, it suits her pretty well. Particularly because when she says "Darling" with this voice it sounds really cute \>.<

For what it's worth, the proportions in the manga aren't always consistent either. Best girl Miia's boobs have been getting increasingly bigger from what I can tell, and her hips were much more prominent early on. And Centorea's nipples have gotten waaaay more prominent recently, they're like caltrops glued to her boobs
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you about Miia's voice. While reading the manga I had something like Chitoge's voice going through my head (probably because of her use of darling :3) but I think the voice shown in the PV could work pretty well as well.

>For what it's worth, the proportions in the manga aren't always consistent either.

Very true - I think most of that can be put down to the mangaka working out how he wants the characters to look (likely based on fan feedback - zzz) as he went along.
>> ARTICLE
> I had something like Chitoge's voice

Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking too, her "Darling's" and generally bubbly personality are like a really excited Chitoge. Surprised I didn't make the connection. Really liking her new voice now--the more I hear its the nicer it gets, she sounds very cute. I feel like more non-believers will realize Miia's superiority, since a lot of the complaints I hear about her revolve around the idea that she's obnoxious or valley-girl-like, which I think is more due to the fact that I think a lot of people imagine her voice like Chitoge's.

I have to admit, looking at this PV, that there is something about the idea of it being an anime that still gives me an off impression about it. Don't get me wrong, I love the series more than the next guy but I can't pinpoint what still makes me cautiously optimistic. Miia's VA also seems just a bit too dere for me but we'll see how it goes. It seems Best Girl Mero is going to be fine though. That's right. **BEST GIRL**.
>> ARTICLE
>It seems Best Girl Mero is going to be fine though. That's right. BEST GIRL.

No.
 
Yeah I kinda agree with you on being cautiously optimistic. First of all, censoring issues, and second, how high/low quality are the animations gonna be? I'm always skeptical about anime adaptations of manga/LNs because of these two factors.
>> ARTICLE
Just looked it up and the studio is the same who did AssClass and Unbreakable Machine-Doll (which explains why the style felt very similar at the start of the PV). I'm pretty content with AssClass so it should be good in that respect. I can't recall much, if any, scenes with actual tits showing. Unless they decide to censor the ecchi, which would be ridiculous. 
>> ARTICLE
Tits were shown in the manga.

I don't mind if they did the censoring in-anime, meaning no black boxes or white lights, honestly.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Ok yea I think you're right. Worst case scenario, they pull an etotama and draw the white lights on the cells hehe. Really though, Shinmai didn't get lucky last season so we'll have to keep our hopes up.

Today I saw slime boobs in an anime.
>> ARTICLE
[My life is complete.](http://i.imgur.com/pRPKycX.png)
>> ARTICLE
The manga is selling like hotcakes on Amazon when a new volume comes out. I actually like it and it's funny 
>> ARTICLE
Watching this I start to consider questions such as: "how *would* you have sex with a girl/snake?" I mean, wouldn't it be awkward being with a girl in the bedroom and having two snakes to handle? 

>> ARTICLE
I cant contain my hype!
>> ARTICLE
MOM, I SWEAR IT'S JUST A VIDEO ABOUT ANIME!!
>> ARTICLE
I thought I should read the first chapter to see what's with all this hype. 

I am now half way trough it... this stuff is crazy...
>> ARTICLE
This...is...ALL I ever WANTED.

This was the first manga I bought in Japan, thinking it looked like fun and now it's having a anime. 


>> ARTICLE
Monster?

No, They are goddess.
>> ARTICLE
The thing that threw me the most was that the MC actually had irises and pupils.  Most of the time he just has an endless white void in his eyes.  Like he's seen and experienced too much.


>> ARTICLE
I read through the entire manga one night. I thought hit was one of those one off sex comics so I'd thought I finished, but I ended up reading the whole thing and forgetting about the sex part as it was just flashing tits. 

I can't wait. I surprisingly like the idea. 
>> ARTICLE
What a time to be alive.

**Adds to PTW list.**

Hnnnnnggggg

That song is SO catchy!

I think I just broke my dick.

Best Centaur and Slime Girl! 
>> ARTICLE
I was considering this show until I saw the Spider girl. 
>> ARTICLE
They hype is real :3
>> ARTICLE
I don't... It... What?
>> ARTICLE
This looks like absolute shit. But I'm going to watch it. Hell, I'm going to enjoy it. 

I'm ready. 
>> ARTICLE
isn't there a [](/s "dullahan") somewhere in there too?
>> ARTICLE
She comes in a much later chapter, which may not have made it into the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Makes sense
>> ARTICLE
Subtle anime. 

Also the amount of fear bones this anime will produce with a 'sexy' half-spider is going to be hilarious. 
>> ARTICLE
Why can't I watch this video? says its set to private.
>> ARTICLE
[Toho Animation decided to re-upload it for some reason.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-IfYF_oesk)
>> ARTICLE
Not any Papi love here? More for me I guess...
>> ARTICLE
Papi's adorable.
>> ARTICLE
I never understood the allure of monster girls, but I kinda fear that show might will do more than just enlighten me.
>> ARTICLE
You and me bro. I've always sort of avoided monster girls up until now. I'll try to take the plunge with this one. 

Anime and more specifically doujin manga are changing me into something I never expected to become... 
>> ARTICLE
Embrace it.
>> ARTICLE
This is...weird. 

Even for anime standards this is uncommon.

Im going to guess its going to be censored. The PV showed uncovered nipples.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, you don't know how hyped I am right now. I'm currently in class right now and I am on the verge of screaming out of impati-**OH GOD I JUST CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS SHIT PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!**
>> ARTICLE
I must say, with all the hype going on here since the announcement, I never really understood. It looked so generic.

However, I can see the appeal now. And it just became my 3rd most anticipated show of the summer.

One question comes to mind. Is it like DxD? *Plot* with Plot? And I mean at least somewhat meaningful plot? And if yes, is it as good as DxD? Or at least comparable? ^^^Please ^^^be ^^^as ^^^good, ^^^that ^^^would ^^^be ^^^glorious!

EDIT: ~~Also, what is the pink one? A dinosaur?~~ nvm, she's a mermaid
>> ARTICLE
There's a ton of worldbuilding, as well as research done with the girls themselves (snakes can't handle low temperatures, so Miia always comically can't handle cold weather, etc) but it doesn't really have the wide and expansive story that DXD can have.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it does have somewhat of a story. Nothing on the level of demons vs angels vs fallen angels like DxD but it's instead just a romcom of a guy getting forced into the Cultural Exchange Between Species Act.

Also the pink one is a mermaid.
>> ARTICLE
I know it's probably a very popular word but "Nichijou" always gives me that brief moment of hope that a 2nd season got announced... :(
>> ARTICLE
I am totally creeped out by this BUT it also made me curious. gonna give it a shot when it comes out i guess. -_-
>> ARTICLE
It's based on a manga! It's strangely good, seeing how the girls cope with being so different from the human MC. I would totally definitely recommend it, if you want a peek.
>> ARTICLE
Just so i can know the level of censorship this will have, does it show nipples a la DxD? 
>> ARTICLE
Fucktons of nipples in the manga
>> ARTICLE
Think Nisekoi but with better MC, plot progression and girls that don't mind to take the initiative.
>> ARTICLE
Only if the girls weren't half animals.. :(
>> ARTICLE
That only makes it better (   )
>> ARTICLE
Better to be half-snake than all gorilla.
>> ARTICLE
Touch
>> ARTICLE
> better MC

Well, I'd argue that he is even blander than Raku, but he isn't as dense. At least there is an explanation as to why he doesn't go and have sex with all of those girls.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I honestly could do with some better backstory and such for the MC. I mean for crying out loud, his name is used like 1-2 times in the beginning and forgotten. Hell I don't think the girls even know it.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget that his eyes are barely ever drawn in the manga.  Just an endless white void.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, that dude has seen some shit.

Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't this start off as a hentai doujin series?
>> ARTICLE
2-page short porn comics on pixiv that shared the same character designs. None of the characters had names though. Then a full non-porn manga was serialized years afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
...My google-fu is too weak apparently. Anyone got a link?
>> ARTICLE
On pixiv, yeah.
>> ARTICLE
OMG the voice actresses are peerrffeccctt!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who had to think about the second Dragonball Kai OP when listening to the second half of the PV?
>> ARTICLE
Wow the animation/art direction seems off and low budget :/
>> ARTICLE
I said "I never watch ecchi!" but why I don't know, I want to wait for Monster Musume. It's to weird.
>> ARTICLE
Needs more fan service. 
>> ARTICLE
Started reading the manga and I love it! Mero is my favorite girl since I love mermaids :)
>> ARTICLE
Where is my plant girl :(
>> ARTICLE
My only problem is that I sort of envisioned best girl Miia's voice to be something closer to Chitoge from Nisekoi. All of the other voices are pretty spot on imo. I'm still hyped though.
>> ARTICLE
Is that a fucking octopus girl!???
>> ARTICLE
Oh its a harpy thats kinda weird... NEXT. the bigboobed blonde girl!  Ah,its a centaurus, cool......okay next gir.. WUT WHAAAA... ????
>> ARTICLE
slime actually
>> ARTICLE
I can't tell what the 4th and 5th girls are supposed to be.
>> ARTICLE
4th is a slime

5th is a mermaid
>> ARTICLE
Why do people like Rachnee?Best choices are obviously either Miia or Lala.Sucks they didn't introduce one of them.

Lala has legs.Plus Rachnee's legs are terrible,quality>quantity.

When I saw this manga in the book store, I was like no way this will recieve an anime due its pornographic nature. Yet here we are, and I won't deny: I'm actually really excited 
>> ARTICLE
my brain advice system is giving me strange signals, someone can help me out please
>> ARTICLE
I have the weirdest boner right now...
>> ARTICLE
Echidna or turtle tier of weird? 
>> ARTICLE
B-both...? I'm not really into monster girls, but this series has peaked my ecchi interests.
>> ARTICLE
As someone that had a vet girlfriend I'll tell you that the turtle and echidna boners are on completely different tiers of weird XD, Google if you dare. 

I have been following the author of the manga since he was a pixiv artist, and even tough his work is NSFW it was still heartwarming to an extent, I would recommend you to read the manga is fun to be honest. At least the first chapter to dodge spoilers tough. 
>> ARTICLE
Damnit, they fucked up Miias voice. >:c

At least I can say that I was here from the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone give me a good overview of what this is? I think I've heard of Monster Girls before because my friends told me about a song titled "Touch Fluffy Tail" and they said it came from that. But I don't know anything about this. All I know is that there is a spider girl and Dark Souls has prepared me to love spider girls even though I'm afraid of spiders. 

Also I'm hoping for a legit overview/explanation, not something where someone tells me who best girl/waifu is. Cuz I see that a lot of people are very polarized over that topic by looking at a few posts in here.
>> ARTICLE
A romcom starring monster girls, with a surprisingly amount of "research" into their unique featuring that makes it refreshing from the usual romcom slogs. There's also some decent world building as well.
>> ARTICLE
Touch fluffy tail comes from a character in monster girl quest, an eroge...tough it has a really enthralling story likeable characters and good humour, the touch fluffy tail comes from 1 out of 3 choices given by a character named Tamamo in the game, 2 are bad...well not bad endings to be honest XD considering the results. 

Like monster girl quest, monster musume no iru nichijou, wich is this Anime it drew inspiration from the monsterpedia wich is a compendium of art pieces and world building towards the monster girl topic, to put it short as it is quite a big thing :3

Short version it's the bleached underpants of a NSFW work adapted into a romcom manga and then Anime for the upcoming season, hope that helps. 
>> ARTICLE
This Series is Super Fun Like more Adult Version of Nisekoi If anyone seen that show But i cant wait to talk about the anime on my YT Channel
>> ARTICLE
anybody know the name of the song playing towards the end of the video?
>> ARTICLE
Shit, I thought Snake was voiced by Sakura Ayane there for a second. Amamiya Sora's okay too.
>> ARTICLE
they missed one....the one that "ALWAYS" save darling from death...wait revive him...

Speechless, the animation, the sound, the voice acting, (although Mias voice was the only one sounding off) My biggest fear was that they were going to cut corners when animating the animal parts, but that don't seam to be the case.

Why is the hype so big?

Because the manga is really good. It's a funny ecchi harem SoL monster girl manga, that actually goes indept in how these monsters have to adapt to our culture. Also; The MC is the opposite of your avarage harem MC.  
  
It's good shit if you keep an open mind.

Man I love Monster Girls as much as the next guy, and I liked the original stories the manga was based on, but this just ain't doing it for me. Call me when we get a proper Monster Girl Quest adaptation.

AOTY confirmed! I'm so HYPED!

Please tell me that I'm not the only one who read it as "Morning Musume" and got really confused.  
That being said, [despite my briefly amused reaction to this](http://excellent.mezgr.de/pair%20of%20titties), I think I'll stick to Monster High dolls for my moster girl fix. Fanservice isn't really my thing.
>> ARTICLE
thanks Japan
thanks for that one
>> ARTICLE
I never judge a book by its cover, but I feel like all this trailer did was have me nope out of this show really quickly.

I wanna say something else, but I'm mostly speechless...

It's just a romcom with a twist, gonna more interesting than your typical ones

It's not dead, but it's taken like 500 steps backward.

Thank you.

It's scary to see how many people are willing to defend hyper-sexuality. WHICH I sometimes like. Ecchi is good for horny people or people who are ready for it. I love the **Freezing** series. Because it knows what it's doing.

But I don't want it in everything>.<
>> ARTICLE
yeah i heard a song i didn't like yesterday. Music is dead.
>> ARTICLE
If we can't see that anime isn't going to stop getting more and more sexualized then we're blind.

So much boobage, soooo much sister fetish, **soooo many body pillow sales needed!!!**

I think I'ma just stay with anime movies
>> ARTICLE
"I don't like something therefore it's shit"
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely not that I don't like the medium. There has just been a shitty trend of animation lately.

Why even have other genres anymore? We already know everything is ecchi/harem now. So f it.
>> ARTICLE
Plenty of nonsexual anime come out every year though. You could just not watch it and then there wouldn't be a problem. Anime has a lot of genres and some are pervy, thats just the way it is
>> ARTICLE
"Plenty"

https://www.livechart.me/summer-2015/tv

Shall we count how many animes on that list that aren't super-hyper-mega sexualized, ,mainly towards females(regaurdless of their age), for more views. (Btw, I'm definitely not a feminist, I don't hate fanservice, I even enjoy it. But too much is too much. Panty shots don't forward anything besides blood to a dick) And how many of those anime would actually be worth it to watch? I'm definitely not watching *Dogakobo*, surface value it's thumbnail looks pretty PG, but I'm sure once someone starts watching it there'll be a bunch of girls hugging in front of senpai for attention, not to mention it'd most likely be boring as all hell anyways.

Don't even get me started on just lolli-fetish. It's another word for pedo-service. 
>> ARTICLE
Gakkou Gurashi

And Dogakobo is the name of a studio
>> ARTICLE
You don't have to hate fanservice to be a feminist.
>> ARTICLE
You don't know what you're talking about you boob hating jihadist!!!!!!

Jk=]

All feminists hate fanservice but not all fanservice makes feminists??
>> ARTICLE
What I mean is that I consider myself a feminist and I don't hate fanservice. It's basically a form of pornography, and pornography itself isn't necessarily creating or supporting barriers to the advancement of women, though in cases it may be used as such. A misogynist's weapon isn't always a weapon made for misogyny.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone's a feminist, everyone's a manist or whatever. 

Being a feminist is pretty much almost pointless now-a-days anyways because they already get paid the same, can vote, hold jobs in office including president, and everything a man can do. 

Fanservice isn't used to degrade women, it's used to sell sex. Because sex sells.

But my problem is sex doesn't have to be in literally **everything**. Why do we even have genres anymore if everything is going to be ecchi/harem. 

I really like the series *Freezing*, but you know from the start what you're getting into. The same themes never had to come up in SAO for example. That along with other shit-brain ideas totally killed the show's second half. And it's second season, from the ~10eps I watched, is garbage as well. After Aincrad, they kinda lost all urgency and mortality. Then added sister fetish and lots of fanservice. Why?

Wolf Children didn't need any of it. Princess Mononoke got along JUST fine. Avatar:The Last Airbender had zilch. **ANIMATORS WHAT ARE YOU DOING, PLEASE STAWP!!!!**
>> ARTICLE
I'd say it isn't pointless despite the playing field being almost leveled, simply because there's plenty of people trying to unlevel it again and also do so outside of government, such as in church hierarchies and social settings. Besides, that's just the US and much of the first-world, shit's still rife elsewhere.

>Why?

You're probably being rhetorical, but I'll say because in the greater scheme it's a story about the repercussions and lingering effects of the SAO game/system. Why use the sister? Because her story is tragic as fuck (for a relatively normal and infatuated teenage girl anyway). Why the slight fanservice shots? [Well you answered that yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON-7v4qnHP8).

I guess you didn't dig Avatar's beach episode for the same reasons I did, and I don't mean the melodramatic self reflections around a campfire.
>> ARTICLE
Man you sound so ignorant atm jumping to false conclusions this quickly.

I'm now waiting on you to change the topic to try to defend yourself
>> ARTICLE
This looks dreadful.
>> ARTICLE
It will be dreadful. I've read 75% of the manga that's been released.
>> ARTICLE
Pity the plot is boring as hell, and the MC is just beyond boring. The only thing it has going for it is some of the unique girls. Other than that, its about as generic harem series you can get
>> ARTICLE
This only reconfirms my suspicions that the vast majority of anime is shit, and that most anime-watchers are either 14, or have incredibly shit taste, or both.
>> ARTICLE
Considering we usually get leftovers from the sweat-dripping otakus in Japan, that's true. Although most of them are 30 years old.
>> ARTICLE
Just because it isn't a genre you enjoy, doesn't mean it's objectively shit. I don't like Mushishi, but I wouldn't call it shit, because I'm capable of basing my opinion of something's quality on the aesthetics it's striving for. You're judging this too hastily and obviously on the wrong aesthetic standards. And I'm not afraid to call things shit that are shit, as some angry people with shit taste stalking my posts will tell you.
>> ARTICLE
 Dude, you are making a ton of assumptions as to why I think it's shit. 
>> ARTICLE
Well if you weren't assuming it's shit based on the PV, I might've thought otherwise about your motivations. Wait until it does something like contradict previously established rules of the world or something.
>> ARTICLE
<sarcasm>Yeah, I hate it when something comes out that other people like but I don't.</sarcasm>
>> ARTICLE
Who said anything about hate?

People can like what they like. Doesn't mean it's not shit.

>People can have opinions.  
 However, those opinions are wrong.  
  
Yeah dude you sure have a firm grasp on how opinions work.

Those statements aren't contradictory, friend.

Theres something fishy going on [here](http://i.imgur.com/ZO9lyfU.jpg) and i thought that before the eerie music 

amnesia? adoption? 

Oh wow im dense its the sister

I cant imagine how shes possibly feeling
she has no recollection of anything before she was 10 and yet still reacts in such a manner to the topic of murder

Also seeing johan [here](http://i.imgur.com/D2e1ByA.jpg) so calm so at ease hes stalking his prey in such a careful and in control manner... dudes oooozing psycho

Same here man, at first I was like WTF is this new girl, and then I got used to it because Urasawa pretty much uses this technique for every new arc.
>> ARTICLE
For me it was so obvious that I was doubting myself.
>> ARTICLE
Yea me too I immediately thought it was her but started to wonder if maybe she wasn't 
>> ARTICLE
To answer your discussion question  I thought she was a new character at first and a badass one at that!  i was thinking she may be a side kick of sorts to Dr. Tenma  (she still might be idk first time watcher) when it hit me that its Anna   i felt sooooo dumb haha   and soooo sad when i realized her parents (those wonderful loving people) are up on the chopping block.
>> ARTICLE
These episodes felt slow to me because nothing caught my interest  until I heard about Johan enjoying the fear of people dying, and when the doctor finally found the foster parents. Learning about Nina's background and seeing Dr. Tenma search through the archives just felt...boring. I think the execution is at fault here rather than the content itself. 

I had my suspicions about Nina being Anna the moment I noticed that she was blonde. I was starting to think she wasn't Anna because she seemed like a normal girl (seeing how Anna was traumatized as a child), but her amnesia explained that away. 

To answer the discussion question, I think Nina/Anna comes off as a near flawless person. Aside from being late to class often, she's intelligent, hardworking, athletic, and friendly. Her life will probably come crashing down once she regains her memories or if Johan kills her foster parents. Also, I think Anna seeing her brother and passing out could have been done better. I didn't get a sense of "absolute evil" when he was just staring at her with a bright white background. 

The journalist raised a death flag when he said he would stop smoking once Dr. Tenma came back alive...I'm pretty sure he's dead/dying once the doctor gets back. In fact, I bet the parents are also dead. Johan comes off as too evil, intelligent, and methodical to mess up a job. Especially this early in the show.
>> ARTICLE
Mamiko Noto! Oh, God, what fantastic news I received. Hearing her voice is beautiful. I was so unlucky of not finding her in any show or just doing really minor characters recently that this is great.
>> ARTICLE
This seems to be moving kind of slow IMO. The overall plot isn't that apparent aside from stopping Liebert.
>> ARTICLE
Monster has an amazing pace, It condenses an insurmountable amount of plot within its episodes. There is almost no filler. If you think its slow or cannot appreciate the constant stream of progression and emotional thrill ride than you should probably seek out the fastest route to terminate yourself.

In fact im going to edit myself, There is ZERO filler in the entire anime. Every second of every episode is fucking plot integral masterpiece of story telling transcending the norm for anime.

Your words are fucking heresy and I would burn you at the stake if you didn't repent for this at some point.

The plot is apparent from within 3 episodes. A doctor sacrificed his career to save a boy who became a mastermind serial killer, He struggles to deal with his choices and whether he should seek vengeance or answers. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to link to this comment from now on for people who call it slow. I agree completely. The pacing is PERFECT. 
>> ARTICLE
[General spoilers] (/s "Three words: road trip episode. Seriously, I love this story, but that episode contributed barely anything to it and could easily have been cut. Also, at some point they show a flashback for character backstory, and then episodes later show the *exact same flashback* a second time for no reason (other than to fill time). A similar thing happens only a few episodes from now; they devote an insane amount of time to unnecessary flashbacks (which are full of material we've already seen) in the section right before Tenma goes to the gun instructor. It's entirely unnecessary. There is absolutely some filler/time-wasting in this show, and that's what keeps me from calling it a masterpiece. To say that every second of every episode is necessary for the story is just plain inaccurate.")
>> ARTICLE
Your post gave me brain cancer so I cannot actually reply to that insanity you just dropped.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly can't tell if you're trolling or not.
>> ARTICLE
Until the time jump, it really is just setting up the plot. This is certainly a show that takes its time, but it all becomes more and more relevant the further you watch.
>> ARTICLE
Not as much slow as it is moving at a realistic pace. It really picks up with the next 20 episode iirc.
>> ARTICLE
You think the first 6 episodes are moving slow? God bless your soul...
>> ARTICLE
The first 6 episodes are probably one of the fastest sections of the show lol.
>> ARTICLE
ah shit. I just finished my own rewatch oblivious that this one was going on :(
>> ARTICLE
Just started watching Monster yesterday, caught up to Ep 6 just now.

Current thoughts:  
**HOLY SHIT THIS SHOW IS TERRIFYING.**

*Edit:*  
This is my first time watching. Nina being Anna was apparent from the get-go, but I wasn't sure how Johan was going to get to her, or what his intentions are with her. I don't feel like he wants to kill her... he seems to have some sort of a sister complex. I'm kind of convinced at this point that he either killed his parents himself, or he witnessed his parents being killed and "died" trying to protect his sister. After waking up from his coma, he turned into a psychopath himself due to the trauma of having his parents brutally murdered.

Either ways I'm both terrified and excited to watch the story unfold.

Oh cool,  you listened to me and caught up! :D really interesting to shear your thoughts and glad you're enjoying it!

Glad you like it, but you haven't seen anything yet, so to speak ;).

> I'm kind of convinced [...] After waking up from his coma, he turned into a psychopath himself due to the trauma of having his parents brutally murdered.

Throughout the story keep on thinking about who Johan is and why he is who he is.  I found it super intriguing on my first watch.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm already thinking about why this anime was named "Monster", who the monster really is, etc. etc. 

Really thought-provoking show, to say the least! Really excited for the upcoming Ep 7 & 8 discussion :)

He's probably dead by now. 1995 was over 50 years ago.

Also MGQ Paradox confirmed for a release in 3 days. The TL group says they have everything set up already to hit it at full speed the moment it comes out. Get hype.
>> ARTICLE
Is this true? I've been waiting on Paradox since I beat all 3 chapters in a week lmao
>> ARTICLE
When your working with slow internet, limited storage, and searching images one at time through pixiv, tumblr, chans, and various boorus it is hard to get that much while maintaining some quality standards.

Also I've had MGQ Paradox kind of on my radar, but since I was looking forward to Sei Monmusu Gakuen and because I try to avoid investing too much into things before they are finished I'm a little torn.
>> ARTICLE
>Sei Monmusu Gakuen

Brushing up on your Japanese or do you have more faith in Dargoth than he seems to have in himself? 
>> ARTICLE
The amount excitement I have for a monster girl eroge is almost embarrassing. 
>> ARTICLE
From what I played of the Demo it looks like it will actually be really fucking good, even without the fantastic eroge element. It plays like Dragon Quest and it's got a good mystery behind it. Also shit tons of monster girls. Like, shit tons.

Do you know if it will be three parts this time as well? or just one game?

I'd read a chronological report on the Waifu Wars.

There any more of it?

There are ones with a spider girl, a harpy, a lamia, a mermaid, a cow girl, a slime, a dullahan, and more. If you meant if there was more that I could post here? No, that would break the no hentai rule.  
  
edit:  
The series were called "Living With _____". For example the picture I posted was the start of Living With Centaur and there would be others like Living with Lamia or Living with Harpy. A search for Living With Monster Girls should get you what you want.

Looks like it's got a good "plot" .

If it is basing off the manga, it may have an alright plot.

Stuff like this is why it's never going to be seen as socially acceptable to watch anime. 

That said I'm totally gonna watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
I generally like to watch things that could at least be considered vaguely (emphasis on vaguely) intellectual.

I'm not familiar with MM's storyline and such, but I feel like I'm going to make an exception.
>> ARTICLE
It's not intellectual, but it delves on the issues of the more monstrous, bigger and less humanize monster girls adapting to human life bathed in comedy gold funny background events, references and echi. 

You know it's not hard to love a cat girl, but a giant spider with razor-sharp claws finds it a bit harder to adapt to human society than those, and this Manga runs on it XD

Educate me, please. What is this and why is everyone so hyped about it?

It's based on the idea that this manga could never have possible gotten an anime adaptation. The hype comes from pure disbelief.

It really is absolutely mind blowing.  I never thought Monster Musume would have gotten an adaptation over some of the other popular manga.  Thinking about it though, it explains the author's recent break.

this has been my favorite manga for a few years and i really hope it doesn't go the rosario + vampire way of being adapted

Considering that Monster Musume doesn't have much of a serious plot like R+V's manga did, they shouldn't have much trouble producing a faithful adaptation
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Cause one of the subplots of the manga [appears in Chapter 5](/s "MC is given the option to choose one of the girls for marriage as a test program"). They even exemplify it again in Chapter 30. 

From my observations, the mangaka does a good job of providing thoughtful exposition of all the new homestays.

[To those who are unfamiliar/want to know about this, it's an adapation of the manga called "Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou"](http://mangafox.me/manga/monster_musume_no_iru_nichijou/v07/c030/1.html)

It's an ecchi harem and it revolves around the idea of having monsters (up until now only monster girls) and humans co-exist with each other.

It's still being translated by fan-translations and is currently at Ch. 30 as of this writing.

It is just another harem anime/manga.  It is just with a twist that the members of the harem are all monsters.  There is a Lamia (Snake Girl), Centaur, Harpy, Mermaid, Dullahan, Slime Monster, and Arachne.  If you like harem manga/anime you'll love it.  If not, then stay away...unless you have a monster girl fetish.
>> ARTICLE
Well then I guess I won't watch it. I'm kinda confused though why so many people are excited for it, I guess a lot of people on /r/anime love harem?
>> ARTICLE
Yea its just better written then most of the genre. Better characters, better humor, isn't as cheesy as others, and contains interesting trivia about animals. 

If you hate harem ecchi comedies then don't watch it. For a comparison - Id say it is similar to To LOVE Ru (manga and later seasons of the anime)
>> ARTICLE
There are good ecchi/ harem stories and bad ecchi/ harem stories, and Monster Musume is pretty good. The "story" is nothing to write home about (it's very much slice-of-life), but the scenario is interesting, it's funny, has a few heartwarming moments and genuinely likable characters. 
>> ARTICLE
At first glance this seems like typical harem trash in the vein of Nisekoi, but with monstergirls. Is that impression incorrect?
>> ARTICLE
As someone who's enjoyed reading the manga, I will say the girls are the absolute only thing this has going for it. The main character guy is one of the most bland harem MC's I've ever seen. Also, the show has some problems with how the cast keeps expanding...there's like what, seven or eight girls living at his house now? 

If you like harem/ecchi, watch it. The girls are what carries the show (hence whenever this show will be mentioned, it WILL turn into a waifu war). However, unlike Nisekoi, Monster Musume doesn't pretend to have a plot. It knows it doesn't and it just has fun with the premise.

As much as it pains me to say, it's pretty much like To Love-Ru with monster girls.

So yeah, if you want a harem show that breaks the mold, it's not here. Honestly, DxD is the only harem show that really breaks the mold IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
Haremtrash?! How dare you
>> ARTICLE
This one actually makes you laugh and the MC is not as generic as others, also think of it of adapting your life to a bunch of girls with large bodies in a society with some harsh prejudice to anything that isn't a cat girl. It's decent, loads of boobs but decent in its history progression.

Making the writing not awful isn't easy.
>> ARTICLE
Is it really that much funnier than the average generic ecchi comedy? I honestly don't know if all this hype is over the monster girl fetish or the actual comedy
>> ARTICLE
> Is it really that much funnier than the average generic ecchi comedy?

Yes. It's by no means ground breaking, but it takes a popular element and injects humor that plays off the character traits. The MC has a brain and the ecchi isn't great, so I would just go to sadpanda if ecchi was all it had.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly can't remember the last time I saw an ecchi comedy that can't be classified as generic, so forgive me for being skeptical.
>> ARTICLE
No Game No Life. I wasn't really interested because for me personally ecchi comedy is wasting my time. But I had nothing to do, checked out the first episode and it was hilarious and actually very well written, not your usually dumb boob-in-face jokes. It was self aware, they knew how silly it was and made fun about it which made it special.

I wonder if there are any other shows that I might have liked. At the moment I see this cover and think "God that looks like shit. Next!" Maybe I should give it a try?
>> ARTICLE
There was nothing nothing special about NGNL. It's your typical self-insertion power-fantasy trip with slightly above average comedy and bright animation. It's still generic
>> ARTICLE
I've read some of the manga and TBH I don't really get why so many people are gushing about it. Having said that, it's not terrible either. So if the idea of monster girls sounds unique/interesting enough to you, you might as well give it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
Depends on what you meant be genetic. If you want to be detailed Warubure is quite different to Shinmaimaou in terms of character dynamics, setting, story progression and so on.

Generic is a very blunt tool to use as criticism as you can call all romance generic, all fantasy action generic... etc
>> ARTICLE
It's blunt if you don't elaborate, which I will be happy to do when the show actually comes out
>> ARTICLE
Not generic might mean Steins;Gate, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Higurashi, Mushishi. Shows that are easily distinguishable by plot and characters. The male lead in most ecchi comedies for example is a pair of trousers, then there is the child hood friend, the nerdy girl, the shy girl, the loud girl, the science girl etc. Yawn.

Edit: Now that I think about it, the girls part is exactly Steins;Gate. It's not so easy after all.

Mc is generic harem mc, only thing special about the manga is great art, ecchi as fuck, it's kinda like a generic harem, but with monster girls which changes a few of the generic harem situations. Also, this will have a high probability of having censorship.

They absorb ..."*nutrients*" and then use the extra 'slime' they got from that to divide, so basically like amoebas. The new slime is smaller and will get the, uh, nutrients from guys to grow bigger, and then repeat the process. 

You should look up the Monster Girl Encyclopedia :p 
>> ARTICLE
Oh.... 'nutrients', huh....

Thank you for fueling my curiosity. 
>> ARTICLE
>Oh.... 'nutrients', huh....

Yup. Most Monster Girls are sex crazed and, in a lot of cases, kinda ~~very~~ rapey. Heh. Or, at least, the precedence set by the Monster Girl Encyclopedia says they are. 

No problem! ;)
>> ARTICLE
I thought Monster Musume wasn't based (but partly inspired) by the Monster Girl Encyclopedia? The initial doujinshi are older than the MGE as far as I know.

 This explains some of the design disparity in the Monster Girls. The girls in the MGE are also more sex-craved than the Musume girls as far as I can tell.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure which came first... I know the original doujins are pretty damn old, but I think Kenkou was also drawing monster girl type stuff on Pixiv at the time, so I dunno. 

I think the doujins might've been first and like you said, MonMusu itself is inspired by/takes from the MGE, but has like original characters and is *way* less sex-focused (although still *very* sex focused lol) 

But MGE was the first thing to properly write out and come up with details of monster girls like their habits and nature and stuff, hence why I said precedence :p
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it was MGE that game first. Okayado even did some of his own MGE like thing.  

Here are some of the encyclopedic type creations by Okayado [1](http://i.imgur.com/y3dKgz3.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/WTbnT7M.png), [3](http://i.imgur.com/KUyS1nm.png), [4](http://i.imgur.com/ZPKaa3g.png), [5](http://i.imgur.com/hRqdFr1.png).  
Compare to the MGE by Kenkou Cross [1](http://i.imgur.com/621COew.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/722hkaO.jpg), [3](http://i.imgur.com/n3yp1ZD.png), [4](http://i.imgur.com/A1fZEyq.jpg)  
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I've never really looked into Okayado's art past 12 Beast/MonMusu/the original doujins, so I didn't know he made his own MGE style stuff. 

Makes sense that MGE was first then! ^ ^
>> ARTICLE
I think Okayado's early works were around the same time as the start of the MGE (or at least how I remember with material being translated at the time). Before he even did his short doujins with prototype characters he even did his own style of encyclopedic entries mirroring the MGE. So yeah they are partly inspired, but not as directly based off of it like Monster Girl Quest.

I found that anime to be very much not funny. it seemed really dumb and boring. im sure i was just missing something or it didnt hit my funny bone but most of the rest on that list i laughed at.
>> ARTICLE
While I did enjoy cromartie, bobobo had the same effect on me. It just seemed like a dumb random joke machine gun.
>> ARTICLE
Did you watch Cromartie High's English dub? That, and Golden Boy, (and maybe Ghost Story...) just really lose something in Japanese. The humor translates much better in the English dub.
>> ARTICLE
How did you not laugh at the opening scene? 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished reading the first manga of that! Someone randomly gave it to me and I was surprised by how hilarious it is! Going to watch the anime now...
>> ARTICLE
Ah! Since you have read the manga, what did the main character (Kamiyama) do that wound him up at Cromartie? The anime doesn't mention it and specifically says "if you want to know, read the manga."
>> ARTICLE
Back in middle school, Kamiyama participated in a school project to break the world record for number of dominoes falling in a chain. After a month, he gets fed up with the project. At the time, the world record was 37,402 dominoes knocked down at once. So, the night before the Guiness officials come to see the record be broken, Kamiyama superglues the 37,402nd domino to the floor, meaning it won't fall over and the record will remain unbroken.
>> ARTICLE
That's great! Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
His friend is really stupid and I think he wasn't going to bother applying to one because he knew he would fail. Kamiyama says something like, "Cromartie High School would be really easy to get into. I'll apply with you!" to be a good friend. So they both apply, but his friend fails anyway so he has to go alone.

I know *I* laughed.

I laughed as well, although it may have sound like I was a maniac
>> ARTICLE
Agreed with everything up to this point and I'll throw in Sket Dance and School Rumble as well. Still one of the more solid list I've seen posted here.
>> ARTICLE
School Rumble has all kinds of great absurdity.  Also, Eri best girl.
>> ARTICLE
No golden boy? Gtfo! 
>> ARTICLE
That is what I came here to say, golden boy is literally a golden piece of art!

ITT: Everyone nominating their own favorite comedy anime.

Good list, though.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's a damn shame Servant x Service isn't on there!
>> ARTICLE
I was honestly expecting more discussion of whether the six already there truly belong on such a list. Instead everyone is just having a great time adding any mildly popular comedy.
>> ARTICLE
Any thoughts on Angel Densetsu? I prefer the manga over the anime in this case.
>> ARTICLE
Never seen it, sorry.
>> ARTICLE
It's insane that you wouldn't include School Rumble on the list. It's one of the best romantic comedies in anime with multiple references to other series and endearing characters. No other anime has made me laugh as much and those who haven't seen it are truly missing out on a great show.
>> ARTICLE
Indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Was gonna comment on School Rumble as well. The first episode is so hilarious it just sucks you right into the series. I still re-watch it whenever I want a good laugh.
>> ARTICLE
My personal list would definitely include [Hataraku Maou-sama](http://i.minus.com/i7RTIf59KeGrK.gif) and [D-Frag](http://cdn.awwni.me/n36z.gif), I thought they were both hilarious.

D-Frag is especially good if you enjoy straight man/funny man type comedy

Edit:gifs
>> ARTICLE
D-Frag is hilarious. Every single episode had me in tears. 
>> ARTICLE
Despite how short it was, I found Plastic Nee-san to be an absolute riot. Don't know if it deserves on the list but it is a contender
>> ARTICLE
I gave up on Lucky Star when I realized I had spent 5 minutes listening to a conversation about the best way to eat a chocolate cornet.
>> ARTICLE
They changed the director at episode 3, so it starts to go uphill after the infamous cornet discussion
>> ARTICLE
they change directors like episode 3-5, to be honest though I still loved it even before that improvement...
>> ARTICLE
Funny... I knew I was going to love everything ahead of me when I realized I had spent 5 minutes listening to a conversation about the best way to eat a chocolate cornet.

2 kinds of people, I suppose...
>> ARTICLE
Wow i literally just watched the first episode and thought it was pure shit, I will give it another chance. I hate how half of the episode was about how to eat a stupid cone.
>> ARTICLE
Lucky Star is more dry and deadpan than a lot of the other series mentioned.  If you like that style of humor, it's great.  Also, the post-credit mini series "Lucky Channel" has some ridiculously funny moments. 
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it will make you give the series another chance, but if you're still on the fence about it, every other episode is leagues better than that miserable first episode of Lucky Star. I think I had read that they even fired the director after just the first episode and got a new one for the rest. Whatever the case, you might consider picking Lucky Star back up at episode 2. Episode 1 is infamous for how dull and dragged out that conversation is.
>> ARTICLE
I believe it's the 4th or 5th episode where they change directors. The change in timing/pace of the jokes is quite noticeable too.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. I may just have to give that show a second chance...
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to nominate Devil is a Part-Timer to the list.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I mentioned earlier in a thread that I named my Pen at work "Dullahan" 

I did this because everyone named their pens, and I got a kick out of saying "Permission to unleash the dullahan?" every time I used it. 

Should have known what would happen. Babysitting my sisters puppy this weekend. The fucker chewed it up. My reaction?

D-D-DULLAHAAAAAN!!!

RIP. What should I name my next pen?
>> ARTICLE
What kind of work requires you to name your pen? Also, name it Pen.
>> ARTICLE
PenPen
>> ARTICLE
I work in an Electroplating lab. We write things down a LOT so we always carry pens. 

Me and my co-workers just named our pens because we always have them on us, and because we don't like people using our pens. 

"Hey, that's Maximus!"

"My bad."

"Hey, throw me Dullahan real quick"

It makes work a bit more quirky.

The Kraken.
>> ARTICLE
Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is comedic gold
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy is pretty much a Zapp Branigan anime. 


This alone is proof enough that you want to watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Baka and Test is also fucking hilarious. 

And OP should watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
Due to Baka and Test not being on this list, the list itself is invalid. Comedy gold
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy, he's a dandy guy in space.
>> ARTICLE
Space Dandy is great. I've nearly finished Season 1 as I type this, very much looking forward to getting to Season 2.

Admittedly there have been one or two episodes that weren't as interesting (at least to me) but generally I love the humour. :D I think my favourite episode so far is episode...7, I think? The one with the space race. :P

Seitokai Yakuindomo does have a second season. 

You're welcome.

Only the second season is on CR not the first. Is it okay to just start watching the second season?
>> ARTICLE
It's not, it a direct sequel to the first so you won't understand the character relations if you don't.
>> ARTICLE
and a season's worth of OVAs
>> ARTICLE
Just a fair warning that Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei (and all the other seasons and OVAs) won't be like the others if you think you can just lay back, watch, relax and laugh.
>> ARTICLE
ghost stories dub!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxJ4VWoeOzs
>> ARTICLE
In addition to the list. 

Seto No Hanayome/My Bride is a Mermaid is also a great, hilarious watch with a blast of an ending. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if this is a common opinion for Seto no Hanayome but I found the first half a bit tedious. The second half, however, was fantastic so anyone watching it for the first time should definitely make sure to stick with it.
>> ARTICLE
My immediate thought was that Seto no Hanayome isn't here, clearly the list is incomplete.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone should give Gintama a try. It starts off slow but trust me, you will fall in love with it.
>> ARTICLE
The dub version of [Ghost Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxJ4VWoeOzs) is also hilarious. The original wasn't suppose to be a comedy, but the english dubbers made it HILARIOUS. 
>> ARTICLE
'Squid Girl' is not bad. Also, for a more weird, I think Ping Pong Club, an older but hilarious anime with some stereotypes.
>> ARTICLE
SZS is more than 12 episodes. It has multiple seasons. Also, the opening and ending means something...

Aside from this, there's Galaxy Angels. That's classic comedy too.
>> ARTICLE
It's a shame [Sexy Commando Gaiden: Sugoiyo!! Masaru-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/582/Sexy_Commando_Gaiden:_Sugoiyo!!_Masaru-san) is never on anyone's list, despite practically setting the mold for some of these absurd comedy anime. Y'all need some culture!
>> ARTICLE
That Nichijou gif actually made me laugh out loud. 

I'd definitely add Great Teacher Onizuka to that list, amazing anime.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the list - I'll look some of these animes up : )
>> ARTICLE
I second Nichijou and Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
I know it's incredibly short, but I feel like [Plastic Nee-san](http://youtu.be/1cvP8fPOPWE) should be here. 

Many laughs to be had if you have a spare 27 minutes.

Edit: Wasn't aware of D-Frag before this thread, I love it!
>> ARTICLE
Add GTO, full metal panic fumoffu,  and School Rumble then you will have my full support:)

How has no one mentioned Maou-Sama!?

I feel obligated to add Arakawa Under the Bridge to this list. About a gang of odd fellows who live on the bank of a river. Also adapted by studio Shaft!

Can anyone tell me why Gintama is good. I think I tried watching it once, i dont think i made it past 4-5 episodes before i dropped it lol
>> ARTICLE
It seems to have a cult following but I'm with you. I tried to give it a shot, it didn't really grab my attention in the first few episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if these count as comedies, since they are also largely action based, but I would also recommend:

-Law of Ueki, Flame of Recca, and Trigun (although who hasn't seen Trigun I guess).

Oruchuban Ebichu was pretty funny too back in the day.
>> ARTICLE
Panty & Stocking With Garterbelt is pretty entertaining, as well.
>> ARTICLE
Where's Mitsudomoe??
>> ARTICLE
since there's no Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka!? on the list I call it bullshit
>> ARTICLE
I had to force myself to finish Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star, but Nichijou is in my top 10. You can't explain that.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting, those exact three anime are some of my favourite comedy anime. Nichijou is my current favourite, with Lucky Star/Daily Lives of High School Boys in second/third (hard for me to choose which way round) and then Azumanga Daioh in fourth. :)

Then again I haven't yet worked Space Dandy and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei into this hierarchy, and I *still* haven't started Gintama yet, so things may get shaken up soon. :P
>> ARTICLE
Add Seto no Hanayome it's one of the best in my opinion 
>> ARTICLE
I found Lucky Star to be actually quite boring despite having its admittedly funny moments,  there were times when the comedy didn't click and I found myself a bit bored.  However two shows of the same concept but are in my opinion,  funnier,  are YuruYuri and Yuyushiki. Both of which get down the balance of cute girls doing cute things and actually being a comedy. Maybe Lucky Star is just a little too mellow for my tastes! 
>> ARTICLE
You are not alone 
>> ARTICLE
English dubbed Cromartie High School  is wildly hilarious. I recommend everybody watch it.
>> ARTICLE
For me:

Cromartie High (amazing dub)

Golden Boy (amazing dub, NSFW)

D-frag!

Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt (amazing dub, NSFW, cartoon parody)

Plastic Nee-san

Space Dandy (amazing dub, S2 airing this season)
>> ARTICLE
Literally any thread with recommendations will have people recommending their own and the title basically turns into a question.
>> ARTICLE
Missing a lot of amazing comedies most of which have already been mentioned. Would like to add Binbougami ga! (Good Luck Girl!) to the list which hasn't been mentioned yet.
>> ARTICLE
I also really love Binbougami ga! it's an underrated gem.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone remember Level E? It might be obscure, but it was my type of comedy and I loved the hell out of it.
>> ARTICLE
First arc was hilarious! A breath of fresh air with all these cute girls doing stupid things and we'll pretend it's funny shows.
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to raise a warning flag for Lucky Star: While it may look like your brain dead show, it is absolutely not one. Jokes are mostly references to popular culture (anime, video game, Internet, etc..). So there's a chance that the joke might go above someone's head if they're still very new to anime. For example,

[spoiler](/s "there's a joke that Izumi is a big fan of the voice actress Aya Hirano (Haruhi Suzumiya). which is funny because Hirano is also acting the role of Izumi in Lucky Star. They even kept the same joke in the english dub by keeping the same english voice actress for both Haruhi Suzumiya and Izumi.")
>> ARTICLE
>  While it may look like your brain dead show, it is absolutely not one. Jokes are mostly references to popular culture

Brain dead show with lots references to popular culture then?
>> ARTICLE
Brain-dead or not, personally I enjoyed it a lot. :P I can see how it's more of an acquired taste than most comedy anime, though.
>> ARTICLE
The lack of D-Frag on this list sincerely disturbs me
>> ARTICLE
Gintama. Nichijou, Nichibros are the fucking best
>> ARTICLE
Why is GTO not on this list?
>> ARTICLE
Full Metal panic fumoffu should be on this list. 
>> ARTICLE
My own list of best comedies from what I watched:

All of these in my mind are hilarious, but I've separated them into groups.

More lighthearted:

* School Rumble (romcom)

* Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (slice)

* Level E (trollface aliens on earth)

* Slayers (RPG)

* Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu (army nut in school blows up suspicious desks; Requires Full Metal Panic beforehand)

* Zero no Tsukaima (only season 1)

* No Game No Life (battle of wits)

More drama:

* Love Hina (romcom)

* Tora Dora (romcom / matchmaker crush)

* Oreimo (drama / family)

* Trigun (sci-fi adv / comedy / drama)

Social commentary / Sarcasm:

* Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei (all seasons)

"Life is beautiful":

* NHK ni Youkoso

* Genshiken

i have seen all of these expect 2 :D (-half of gintama, still going on with it because of the lenght) Every one of these is absolutely amazing. My favorites are definetly Gintama, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, and Seitokai Yakuindomo.

>> ARTICLE
A few of my favorite comedy anime that didn't make the list:    
[Potemayo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2744/Potemayo). Don't let the moe blob design turn you off, this show is hilarious. If you sit through the first episode and don't laugh out loud then you are clinically dead inside.    
[Yuyushiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15911/Yuyushiki). I think of this show as a take on the Seinfeld line "a show about nothing". It's just 3 highschool girls sitting around talking with each other but it's so damn funny.    
[Joshiraku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12679/Joshiraku). If you're an otaku or just interested in otaku stuff then this show for you. I remember when it first came out I had to look up explanations of some of the jokes to understand the anime industry inside stuff. Even if you don't get every line there are so many jokes and they're so well done that you're bound find yourself laughing.

finished Yuyushiki a few days ago, it was damn good.

I've tried Gintama, but I could never really get into it, and just stopped watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Up to Ep 24 the show is rather dry to watch and not that funny but you should retry it as it really gets amazing.  
If you don't feel like watching the build up episodes just skip to ep25 and watch until about ep35, this should give a better impression of the shows quality up until around ep50 where it starts to get even better. The show really keeps jumping up a notch after every 20 - 30 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I've dropped it once and tried again after some time. Past some episodes it got so better, that it turned into my favorite anime.
>> ARTICLE
Beelzebub.....
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I did not like a single one of those. Maybe I just have different taste.
>> ARTICLE
Apparently so. Out of curiosity, are there any comedy anime series you do like?
>> ARTICLE
Off the top of my head FLCL and Abenobashi Magical Shopping Arcade but in general I don't usually enjoy the genre; however, I personally believe that it has more to do with the format of the shows themselves than the fact that they are comedy based. I really, really dislike the azumanga daioh short cut format that many comedy series tend to stick with.

It's a shame this rewatch isn't more popular, I'm watching this for the first time and it's really grabbed me. I'm gonna try and post my real-time notes in every thread from here on, I just hope I can keep it up.

**Episode 11**

-Poor estate agent, no sell for you I'm afraid.

-Well that orphanage has seen better days, Johan must've had something to do with it.

-Thanks for the exposition, creepy old lady.

-A tragedy? Yep, Johan is definitely involved.

-STRANGER DANGER. STRANGER DANGER.

-So the orphanage was basically a prison, no wonder Johan is so fucked up.

-"Incident", here we go.

-Uprising; not what I was expecting but there's probably more to it.

-OH SHIT THIS GUY IS NOT COOL.

-STRANGER DANGER. STRANGER DANGER.

-C'mon Tenma you're a doctor, you can see the signs of abuse.

-Oh shit, Tenma's cover's blown.

-Man, Hartmann is such a creeper.

-Tenma to the rescue!

-Don't leave him alone! This can only end badly.

-Oh the orpanage, of course!

-Kinderheim has a terrifying reputation, jeez.

-Human experiments? Shiiiiiiiiiiiiit.
 
**Episode 12**

-Man Kinderheim was fucked up.

-Oh christ, Hartmann was behind it all. Should have seen that coming.

-Man, I hope Deiter is gonna be alright.

-Johan incited mass murder amongst them. Jesus.

-OH CHRIST NO.

-"A little detour" He couldn't be any creepier if he tried.

-Ok, he can be creepier.

-Someone's gonna end up dead by the end of the episode, I can feel it.

-Detective Tenma, on the case!

-Johan's gonna be in a photo somewhere.

-Called it.

-Hartmann has such a punchable face.

-Failed again? So he's tried to create multiple Johans? The concept alone is terrifying.

-Yep, Johan was born evil.

-"SHOOT HER! SHOOOOOOT HEEERRR!"

-MY MAN DEITER

-Man, Hartmann is so pathetic.

-I thought he was gonna go full Kurt Cobain there for a second.

**Episode 13**

-A little boy? So Deiter came with him?

-Deiter gives no fucks.

-Yeah, cause THAT'S not obvious.

-"Chang", sure we'll roll with that.

-HIS MOTHER IS A SAINT

-Ok, not quite a Saint. The joke still stands.

-"Eat her gulash" Gross.

-Man she's mad sick.

-Yeah that was obvious.

-OH SHIT HE'S SEEN HIS FACE.

-TENMA TO THE RESCUE.

-DEITER PLEASE *facepalm*

-Tenma gives no fucks about that gun.

-Again with the gulash. This man is such a horndog.

-YEAH GET THE FUCK OUT.

-So he's basically the opposite of Tenma. Chose to climb the ladder instead of taking care of his patients.

-Oh man, that's rough.

-Heinz doing the right thing, my man.

-Gotta take one life before he can save many.

-I JUST SAID THAT TENMA, STOP STEALING MY LINES

**Overall thoughts**

The series is progressing in an interesting way. It's taken on a more episodic-style with Tenma meeting all kinds of people and changing their lives one way or another. The main story hasn't been abandoned though, we're gathering new information about Tenma and Johan every episode and it feels like there hasn't been any dead space so far; every second is important in some way and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.


>> ARTICLE
I just want to say I really appreciate your notes/thoughts! Really makes me happy at least one person is pretty invested in the show =P really looking forward to continue hearing your predictions and thoughts! =D

Thanks a lot! I'm really glad this rewatch is happening otherwise I might not have started watching Monster in the first place.

**Episode 11**

When I found out that Johan was raised in a facility that did cruel experiments, I immediately wondered if Johan was raised to be a monster or if he's just inherently a monster. It goes back to the whole nature vs. nurture debate. If he is a monster created by his circumstances or mental insanity, can we really blame him for his actions? In court, I could imagine Johan pleading not guilty and his lawyer using his insanity and upbringing as an excuse. It's another moral grey area.

**Episode 12**

That foster parent is seriously crazy for wanting to create another Johan, and then having an emotional breakdown when Dieter leaves him. He says the orphanage didn't create a monster, but I still think the environment influenced Johan and enabled him to do some really evil stuff. Also, we now know that Johan isn't just manipulative, he's a mastermind who can lead people into darkness.

Oh, and I like how the foster parent and child-Johan were drawn. The old man looked really creepy when he was taking Dieter "somewhere else." Johan as a boy looked...unnatural with his smiling eyes inside that dark orphanage.

**Episode 13**

The events felt a little too contrived in this episode. Tenma runs into a cop who later realizes he's a fugitive, said cop's mother happens to collapse right when Tenma visits, only Tenma can save her with his brain surgery skills, and then the cop let's Tenma off the hook. It just feels too convenient. Otherwise, it was a pleasant enough episode.

I'm surprised Tenma is letting Dieter tag along on his dangerous mission to kill a monster. If I were the doctor, I would've forced Dieter to stay someplace safe. He's going to be a major liability. I mean, the kid's just asking to be kidnapped, held hostage, or manipulated due to his association with Tenma. He could unwittingly tip off the police too. 

The village doctor let's Dieter go with Tenma because he sees that there is darkness in Tenma--a darkness that he hopes the innocent boy can keep Tenma away from.
>> ARTICLE
Why would the minister adopt Johan in the first place? Also I think its kinda weird that Tenma didn't kill Hartmann, considering he's partly responsible for Johan - whats stopping him from getting more kids to attempt to recreate Johan? Needed more Lunge in these episodes.

You bring up a good point about Harmann. They don't show him getting arrested or anything, and I find it hard to believe that Tenma would let him go scot-free. Tenma is a kind doctor and not a stone cold murderer, so I don't think it's weird that he didn't kill Hartmann. Taking a person's life is far from easy for Tenma (a monster like Johan may be an exception). I could see him shooting to save Dieter or in self-defense though, but it never comes to that.
>> ARTICLE
No parents, raised in an orphanage, grows up to be a killer psychopath. Yes, I'm talking about Voldemort here...

I thought I had everything figured out when they mentioned orphanage experiments, but if what Hartmann said was true, Johan was already broken when he arrived. I'm curious what happened on that Czechoslovakian border.

Quite gripping episodes, anyway. Especially *A Little Experiment*, I was sure either Hartmann would kill Dieter, or be killed by Tenma. As to *Petra and Schumann*, I thought Tenma would finally turn himself in, just out of lack of other options, if not for anything else. Finally, he's bound to meet an officer who won't hesitate to apprehend him... He's already had a few very close escapes.

In other news, I'm surprised we didn't see the thief from the previous episodes. I expected this story to continue.
>> ARTICLE
LOL voldemort.  Wow. 

I'll just say that's not the last time you see that thief! 
>> ARTICLE
*First-timer notes.*

Oh my god, this is such a nasty, **nasty** show. The rage I feel for Hartmann for being such a despicable human being and the pain I feel for Dieter for not knowing any better because he was raised in such a dysfunctional environment... what makes all this worse is the fact that I *know* that somewhere out there, there's a child suffering the exact same treatment from an abusive adult.

However, Hartmann's breakdown toward the end of Ep 12 was a little disappointing. He's such a hardened sociopath, I expected him to shoot or be shot by Tenma. That was weak writing, imo.

Ep 13 was a nice break from all the intensity of the previous 2 episodes. I really like the pacing of the show so far, and it's really done a great job of developing Tenma's character. I'm hoping to see more of Johan and Anna in the next few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't get the whole Dieter story, was the guy just abusing him or was Dieter part of an experiment?, how did the guy got dieter in the first place?, not sure if I didn't pay attention or just plot-holes.

I really liked the "Petra and Schumann" episode, it shows that Tenma is still an awesome doctor and people still respect him as such, like Schumann did in this episode

>> ARTICLE
From what I can gather it seems like after the orphanage fell to pieces Hartmann started taking in orphans, trying to mold them to "create" another Johan, but ultimately failed to do so. The abuse seemed to be his way of exposing them to violence in order to make them "stronger".
>> ARTICLE
yeah I got the whole orphanage testing facility thing. What I didn't get was where did Dieter come from? was he a child from Kinderheim 511 too? why does he lives with the guy?
>> ARTICLE
Johan was the only surviving child from 511 Kinderheim so he's not from there; instead, I believe Hartmann used his status as a government official to adopt children from other orphanages.
>> ARTICLE
yeah that make sense.. its not shown in the episodes tho

In the mal description it says that Hartmann was trying to make Dieter into another Johan. So I'm guessing he originally  adopted Dieter for that purpose.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah based on what he said to Tenma I assumed he was adopting children in order to create a second Johan, and because his involvement with 511 was erased he could use his status as a government official to essentially hide any signs of abuse towards the kids.
>> ARTICLE
Just started reading the manga of this series, I'm hooked. How does the anime compare? 
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty much the exact same thing. The anime is adapted (almost exactly) scene for scene -- so it's basically the manga in an animated format =]
>> ARTICLE
Where can I watch this? I see that this was not fully released in the US. 
>> ARTICLE
There are *ahem* sites. Due to subreddit rules I can't say here. If you PM me, I can tell you the one I watch it on.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that was quick!

I pretty much plowed through these episodes. The show seems to be picking up pace with the ceremony. And now I'm stuck with that damned cliffhanger, I will not be able to watch *Monster* until tomorrow :/

Yeah, I'm late to say this, but I had a feeling these books would burn. Maybe Johan is simply interested in chaos after all; maybe I was wrong looking for some superior motif here. Or was I? Anyway, something tells me that the scope of Johan's murders might change. He seemed to be satisfied with killing selected people, but now he's quite content with collateral damage. This is some Joker-level stuff right here, and it makes me happy in a wicked way :D

What happens at the end of *A Nameless Monster*? Does Tenma finally break and shoots Roberto? I really need to watch the next episode :P Lunge and Reichwein are late to the party, but they will definitely join in soon. I wonder what will happen to Schubert and all the attendants, I don't suppose they will all die in the fire - this show is dark, but not that dark yet.

I wonder how the picture book relates to Johan's backstory...
>> ARTICLE
Oooooh shit.
>> ARTICLE
THE TENSION!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, the show is getting really good with that last episode.

* In the karaoke scene, I got excited to see Lunge sing. Then I was disappointed when he declined. Dammit Lunge, I'm pretty sure Tenma would've sung.

* I'm also pretty sure that shooting Johan in front of a large audience is worse than shooting him in a forest. The audience could go into a panic causing injuries and maybe a heart-attack or two. Whereas in the forest, only an ex-soldier-now-hippie would be sad about nature being "defiled" or whatever.

* Did Mr. Schubert send his son away to protect him from Johan?

* Tenma definitely didn't die there because he's the main protagonist and we're only halfway through the show. So Tenma, Lunge, or Anna shot Roberto.

**The picture book!** Oh man, I think I understand Johan much better now:

* Johan is the monster that went east looking for happiness or a place to belong by trying on different names (identities). However, he keeps becoming unsatisfied with each new identity despite gaining so much praise and respect (by society's standards). Why? Because he has the hunger to kill. So he repeatedly ends up destroying the identity and killing everyone who adored him just like the monster in the book. He tried being an orphan prodigy at Kinderheim 511, but he ended up leaving and having everyone kill each other. He tried being a good son to various foster parents, but he ended up leaving and killing them. He tried being the head of a criminal underground bank, but he ended up leaving and causing the criminals to kill each other. Now he's tried to be a college student gaining economic influence through Mr. Schubert, but now he's leaving Mr. Schubert, everyone who came to see him, and Schubert's beloved books to burn.

* Anna is the monster that went west and found happiness and a place to belong despite not having a name (identity). In a way, Anna doesn't have a real static identity because it keeps changing throughout the show. She's been a foster child with amnesia, a fake prostitute, a waitress, and a college student in Munich. Yet she can still find some measure of happiness, satisfaction, or friendship in all of those different roles. This is the opposite to Johan's situation. At the end of the book, she gets eaten by the other monster though...does that mean Johan wants to kill Anna? Crap, I hope not.

* Eventually, the eastern monster finds a name he likes to keep (the prince's name, Johan) and continues to kill people when his hunger grows too big. My theory is that Johan will eventually come to realize that the best name (identity) for him is Johan (the serial killer). He has a calling for killing--not fitting in with society. Although, it's possible that he has already realized this, and he's taking on different identities as a means to kill more people in new novel ways rather than still searching for happiness in becoming someone else. Who knows? Maybe Johan was freaked out by the book because he realized that he is fated to be a monster who kills everyone he knows and remain utterly alone.

IIRC; he only briefly mentions (to Smith?) that his parents are out of the country on business. 

I believe it was early on and in reference to the custom bath for Mia, but it might have been during another of the construction projects too.

I'm still not sure where to place my bets for his parents reaction.

A. "What the hell happened to our house!? Who are all these strange women!? Why is this slime creature groping me?!"

or B. Parents are totally cool with this. They were extra-species the whole time. Darling-kun is adopted.

Both would be wonderful!

I can actually see Darling having been adopted, would explain why he was so cool with everything to some degree XD.

But I think the first one would be most entertaining from a comedy perspective.

It would be amusing if parents were Dopples. However, then we would have multiple dopplegangers and some people would complain about certain species being over-represented.

And Darling is a genetically engineered super-diplomat unknowingly in a testing phase where he has to manage interspecies relations amidst high sexual tension without delving into chaos; monster girls are routinely added to the area in a controlled fashion to determine Kurusu0371's diplomatic capacity before a ranking is set and he is sent out in the field.

Seriously, those delusional -monogatari fans.  Watch a show about incest, pedophilia and bestiality and claim its totally about the character development.

Nothing like the glorious MonMusu fans who trumpet the glory of our sweet, sweet sexualized monster girls.  I feel kind of bad for the -monogatari girls, whose fans are too ashamed of their vices to fully rejoice in them.
>> ARTICLE
> Nothing like the glorious MonMusu fans who trumpet the glory of our sweet, sweet sexualized monster girls.

yes this is once again the case of something you can only ever be proud saying over the internet in a discussion thread where it's obvious that the majority participating in said thread will agree with you... 


at no point did i defend monogatari, you simply put words in my mouth that weren't there. however without a doubt it has more worthy elements to it then this absolutely trash 100% fetish fulfilling anime. 


ask yourself this deep down; is there literally anything separating this anime from the hoards of stereotypical ecchi anime with no plot or character development, ASIDE from its clear monster girl-fetish fulfillment?
>> ARTICLE
I assumed you were defending monogatari because you gave it an 8 on MAL, whereas you dropped MonMusu.  It seemed fair to infer your opinions from that.

What sets MonMusu aside from hordes of stereotypical ecchi anime for me is pretty simple: I found this one funny.  Comedy is tricky business, and rather personal.  The humor I enjoyed in this show was the comedy of the absurd.  Absurd things are often funny, and I found this one to be highly absurd.

If you didn't enjoy it, that's okay.  I don't expect everyone to have the same sense of humor as me.
>> ARTICLE
I think with the monogatari series, most if not all fans love their character for what they are, not what tropes they represent. Using myself as an example, I like Shinobu for Shinobu, not for her vampire-loli, big breastedness, dress wearing, panty-less, blonde, servant-master, actually 1000+ year trope(s). Less about ignorance, more about acceptance.

This last episode ends with such a cliffhanger, but I'm going to test my will and keep the pace of the rewatch... I think 3 episodes per 2 days is just about right, by the way. Ending with an uneven number tickles my little OCD, but nevermind :P

It was great to see some background of Inspector Lunge. It made me like him even more, though he might turn to be a real asshole later on.

*Be My Baby* and *Wolf's Confession*... just wow. The sequence with Anna running around the masion only to find dead bodies was *creepy*, just like the message Johan left on the wall. I think it proves that any kind of reasoning with him is pointless (as a comment to the extremists). I didn't expect the whole Hitler stuff, but the show handled it pretty well by far, they could easily ruin it into some cliche. But it's fine as it is and I'm looking forward to the next episode.

Monster hype! This series just gets better and better. I ended up watching the episodes in advance so I have my notes ready to go!

**Episode 14**

-"I did not have sexual relations with that woman."

-Lunge being as creepy as ever.

-As a side note, I just noticed Deiter in the credits, so he's obviously gonna play a more prominent role than he already has.

-Lunge is very analytical, I'm sure he thinks in binary.

-"You're only human." I doubt that.

-Such a maverick, he don't give a fuck about procedure.

-Oh Christ, it's Eva again.

-Surely Lunge would have done research into Johan and found something by now. If Tenma can uncover his past, so can he.

-Lunge pushing all the wrong buttons.

-Even at home he's pushing the wrong buttons.

-OH SNAP.

-Man, he just doesn't give a semblance of a fuck.

-You're off the case!

-Urgh, no more Eva, please.

-What a bitch, jeez.

-I think it's impossible to make her happy.

-Little girl please. Not cool.

-Dude, don't even think about it. Never stick your dick in crazy.

-"Worthy of my company" Everything she says just makes me hate her more.

-No, you're not a good person.

-You stuck your dick in crazy, you done fucked up.

-Oh she's drunk again. Yaaaaaaay.

-Yes, I can believe Johan can kill someone.

-She says it's a split personality, yet there's a picture of the kid RIGHT THERE.

-Well she changed her tone fast.

-"Tend your gardens" Steady on sailor.

-She literally has no redeeming features.

-Not even those puppy dog eyes can make me feel sorry for her.

-Sorry kid, it's not gonna be your mother.

-Alright, I was wrong.

-THAT'S RIGHT CRY BITCH MUHAHAHAHAHA.

-Well SHIIIIIIIIIIT.

**Episode 15**

-Eva again?

-Nope, it's Nina. Man, she's changed a lot.

-Seems like she's investigating Johan as well.

-Oh it's Bucktooth again.

-I'm sure kids hate you as well.

-Well he's suspicious.

-Oh it's the crooked cop in league with Johan.

-Ex-cop. Bummer.

-Might wanna keep your voice down, buddy.

-Organisation?

-Told her? Nina, obviously.

-Oh, so he's a Nazi, this is gonna be fun.

-Bait? Oh shit.

-Time to meet Nazi boy.

-BUT FIRST LET'S PUT ON SOME FUNKY FRESH TUNES.

-Why is everyone in this show a creeper?

-Johan is totally gonna show up at some point.

-I'm pretty sure Turks know their rugs, mate.

-Of course. Nazis. I'm sure Tenma would stand out in a place like that.

-OH FUCK.

-She probably has another gun somewhere.

-And yet another creeper.

-Oh, so he was with Hartmann at 511 Kinderheim.

-Are they trying to turn Johan into Hitler 2.0?

-I hate Nazis.

-Tenma has seen better days.

-"We're not gonna hurt you." You ran him over, it's a bit late for that.

-The Baby would be right at home in Gotham City pissing off Batman.

-SECOND GUN. CALLED IT.

-Knock, knock.

-Oh it's that other girl that was kidnapped.

-I really, really hate Nazis.

**Episode 16**

-Side-note: the OP is incredible, it suits the atmosphere of the show perfectly.

-Like I said, I'm pretty sure he knows what that rug is worth.

-You do know Tenma's wanted for murder, right? I'm sure name-dropping him everywhere isn't a good idea.

-Yep, there's NO WAY it can be the same Japanese guy you met earlier.

-Deiter to the rescue?

-Knock, knock.

-Wolf is gonna be some sort of uber-nazi isn't he?

-Ouch, that's gonna leave a mark.

-Deiter looking to pick up chicks.

-Deiter gonna get wasted.

-NO. FUCKS. GIVEN.

-Been there before, buddy.

-Deiter's got balls of steel.

-OH SHIT.

-"First good person" What about the woman looking after your baby?

-Well that doesn't sound good.

-First rule of horror: don't go upstairs.

-Uh, oh.

-Deiter you fucked up.

-YOOOOOOOOOO

-Nina looking for vengeance.

-Is this Johan's doing?

-This is defintely Johan's doing.

-Or maybe it was Wolf?

-Tenma laying down the law.

-"Run Forrest, run!"

-Nina is probably already gone.

-Yep, the creeper from the photo.

-Fear? Of Johan?

-Oh, so he's not trying to create Super-Hitler.

-A second savior of Johan. An interesting parallel.

-So Johan murdered this guy's entire family? Shit.

-It WAS Johan who killed everyone.

-I like the cut of Wolf's gib.

-Bucktooth you might wanna keep your voice down.

-*facepalm*

-Tenma's on a mission.

-FIRST RULE OF HORROR: DON'T. GO. UPSTAIRS.

-WHAT IS WHAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

Things have really picked up: the return of Nina; the introduction of Wolf and the Nazis; Deiter growing as a character; but more importantly, Johan is making his presence known, and no doubt he'll turn up for real in the next couple of episodes. Shit's about to go down.

There's already an interesting parallel to be drawn between Johan and Deiter. Both were saved by Tenma as a young child but whereas Johan continued to be a sociopathic monster, Deiter is learning from Tenma that there is good in the world, and that all life is precious. It wouldn't surprise me to see this become a recurring theme in the show as Deiter's character develops furhter.

>"I did not have sexual relations with that woman."

Top fucking kek. Nice notes dude. What episode are you up to, or did you just watch yesterday?

Hah thanks :). I haven't watched past 16 yet, I'll probably binge through the next 3 today or tomorrow ready for the discussion, though it's getting harder to resist the urge to keep going; these cliffhangers are brutal.

The Baby is just such a detestable character, right down to his voice and insistent terminology.

Definitely; I love dark, psychological stuff so this show is right up my alley. :)

From a guy who is almost on episode 60 it keeps getting better, brother. ;)

**Episode 14**

I'm baffled that the robot, Lunge, has a wife and daughter. How did *that* happen? Maybe he wasn't always so cold and unemotional. If that's the case I can only imagine what changed him to be who he is now. And wow, Eva has reeaally gone off the deep end. It looks like Mr. Robot and Psycho-woman are going to become a duo to take down the evil Dr. Tenma.

Seriously though, Eva and Lunge make a very interesting juxtaposition of dysfunctional characters. Lunge has intense focus on his work. Eva is aimlessly living off of her inheritance. Lunge never takes a break. Eva is perpetually on break. Lunge is stiff. Eva is loose. Lunge lacks all emotion. Eva is overwhelmed by emotion. They are two different extremes. But one thing they have in common is the usage of shady methods (blackmail, threats, "adding pressure").

**Episode 15 and 16**

* Aw, I was wrong about the detectives being innocent. I thought it would be too hard to have criminals become high ranking detectives. I guess I was too naive.
* Anna is becoming an interesting character. Before, she seemed like just an ordinary girl (as an adult). Now she's courageously taking risks with that gun of hers like it's no one's business.
* The second coming of Hitler and Nazis. I actually did not see that coming. I was wondering if this was the actual theme for Monster, but that quickly went out the window.
* I don't like how Dieter's character has changed so much in such a short time. It's unrealistic. He was abused and traumatized by a creepy old man a few episodes ago (broken ribs, dislocated shoulder). Now he's unafraid to be alone, talking and interacting with random strangers with a carefree attitude. Really?

I've noticed that the show has been building up Johan more and more as time goes on. At first he was just a creepy serial killer. Now he's a manipulative mastermind with godlike charisma and leadership skills. He strikes fear in everyone (sometimes by just looking at them), high ranking officials practically worship him, and he's more evil than Hitler. What's next? He's also an expert at torture?
>> ARTICLE
I like how you compared Lunge and Eva. It certainly makes for quite the odd pairing, huh! Lunge, as a character, reminds me of how the general public perceives people with Asperger's Syndrome. The ridiculously good memory, the "fingers are constantly typing" mannerism, the lack of common empathy, etc.

I completely agree with you on Dieter. Any normal kid who underwent such traumatic events should have some sort of emotional scarring left behind. He wasn't receptive at all when Tenma first met him, how is he being all snarky and cute to strangers now?

The hype for Johan is too real. When he finally makes an appearance, I expect there to be rays of darkness emanating from within him. Also there should be death metal playing in the background.
>> ARTICLE
*First-timer notes.*

**Ep 14:** OMG, Lunge figured out the mystery! ... wait, he thinks Johan is Tenma's split personality? |: All in all a pretty depressing episode for Lunge. Also, that bitch cray.

**Ep 15:** A-Anna? Was that blonde bombshell Anna?! ... annnnd everything got super dark with the right-wing extremists right at the end. Monster probably has the most comprehensive cast of villains in all of the animes I've seen so far.

**Ep 16:** What is what?! Hnnnnngh, cliff hanger...
>> ARTICLE
I'm down with it, but as you've mentioned yourself, there's too many rewatches going on right now.  Maybe you can do the rewatch in a few months, when there are less anime being rewatched.
>> ARTICLE
Would be very interested, I have seen a lot of praise for this show in the past and the only thing that kept me from watching it so far is the daunting episode count.

Probably a good idea to wait until the current rewatches finish though.
>> ARTICLE
I want to join. I always wanted to watch it but never could pull myself through to episode 10..
I think this will be a nice push like: watch 1 or 2 every day.
I'm in if we are going to do this.
>> ARTICLE
To the people who plan on watching this for the first time, be aware that the pacing of the show is really slow. I think the pacing is done masterfully, but some people might be bothered by it. If that's the case, I suggest reading the manga. It's a very faithful adaptation so you won't miss out on any content, and it usually ends a lot quicker(I read it in like 3 days). Just my 2 cents.
>> ARTICLE
I wish people would stop saying stuff like this.  It gets viewers to start thinking about stuff like this,  when they should just be enjoying the show.  I thought the pacing was absolutely perfect,  and it didn't feel slow at all to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I think people say this because there's a particular way that Urasawa set up the story in that he likes to jump around from story arcs but starting at seemingly unrelated points. I loved this, cause it made things so much more satisfying once the pieces clicked into place, but I can see how others might see it as meandering or unimportant.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah for me it wasn't like "why is this relevant"  and more like "I can't wait to see how this all ties together!" 
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was just a bit unsettling when the Munich arc started, but I quickly got used to it. Every scene where Tenma showed up after we hadn't seen him for a while became awesome, [like](/s "Tenma showing up in time to save Reichwein from Roberto.")
>> ARTICLE
Wait for most of the plebeian rewatches to finish, then we can start this glorious series.
>> ARTICLE
god bless
>> ARTICLE
There are 5 re-watches going on with one finishing today and the other one finishing in 4 days. That leaves the Mirai Nikki, Gundam and Key re-watches which aren't finishing any time soon. Then we also have the Oregairu re-watch happening during March, Katanagatari starting this Friday and K-On!/S&W starting mid to late Spring season.

Now trying to fit the Monster re-watch would require us to schedule it during the Summer season which is usually loaded with anime so the idea with 2-3 episodes every day would be a bit too much and the Fall season is similar.

My suggestion would be to have 3 episodes every 2 days or 5 every 3 days starting on the 4th week of Summer so in both cases it would be possible to finish it before the season ends.
>> ARTICLE
That's in such a long time though D=

I'm guessing that most people aren't rewatching all of the current [re]watches (and that most are just [re]watching one), so I don't think it's an issue for it to overlap with a few. I just don't want it to be too many so that the front page will be overloaded with rewatch threads. 

I do really like your idea of 3 per 2 days or 5 per 3 days though. I really like that idea, it would take longer but be much more digestible, I'd think.

I think I want to start it some time in the next month or two. Maybe when Mirai Nikki rewatch finishes.
>> ARTICLE
Well I wanted to keep 2-3 daily ones and a single weekly/bi-weekly one to not flood the subreddit.

Now if we would look when the re-watches would end then it's

Re-watch | Last day
---|---
Mirai Nikki | 13th March
Gundam | 28th February 
Key Rewatch | 8th June
Katanagatari | 3rd April

Now it all depends on the whether the Gundam rewatch finishes after the current series. If it does then we'll have 3 daily re-watches and a 2 bi-weekly ones which is fine by me.
>> ARTICLE
While that's true, the Key and Gundam re-watches don't have too much discussion at the moment. I imagine that when clannad after story comes along, the Key one will be pretty popular but I dunno about Gundam. In any case, they don't really flood the subreddit becasue there aren't many comments or votes so it doesn't get very high on the subreddit every day. 
>> ARTICLE
There is no 100% guarantee that the Monster re-watch will have tons of comments either. Similar case is Gintama which is a far more popular show but it rarely got over 40 comments and usually only had around 10-20.

If the ones organizing the Key and Gundam re-watch want to stop theirs because it doesn't have that much participation then it'll solve the issue but it'll be considered flooding if way too many are happening and some people complained about them during the last Metathread. You also need to take into account that there are more series airing during Spring too.

This is just an attempt to organize all the current re-watch and stop people from starting ones when other re-watches where announced/scheduled earlier.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the three per two days is a good idea. Some episodes can be very slow or focus on side characters without much progression on the plot.
>> ARTICLE
That being said, that's part of the enjoyment of the show. All the characters are so well done.
>> ARTICLE
I should watch Monster and this would be a great opportunity.  I'll keep an eye out for whenever you decide to do it.
>> ARTICLE
Watching through it slowly right now, I just finished episode 19 yesterday. So yeah, since I'm watching it anyway, I'd support this :D
>> ARTICLE
I'll join.  It is an amazing serious.  I would recommend doing this in Spring.  April maybe.
>> ARTICLE
+1 to interest counter.
>> ARTICLE
Just started watching it for the first time a few days ago! I'm on episode 10 at the moment, I'd be interested in a rewatch
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually watching right now, I really like it (at ep.16), but I can see interest waning for most people after a couple seasons worth of content (i.e. 2 seasons of monster, then watch a new anime, go back to monster.) I don't think it would be the best "rewatch." 

We also have way to many watch groups going on right now :/
>> ARTICLE
I havent seen it but i would be down to watch it and discuss it n the subreddit as a first time viewer.
>> ARTICLE
I'd be down. I love this show so much.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually trying to wrap this up now so I can get to the current rewatches! lol
>> ARTICLE
I've read the full manga, but never seen the anime. I'd be down for watching it. Is the anime the same quality as the manga?
>> ARTICLE
It's adapted almost scene for scene.  So it's almost the exact same as the manga.  In other words,  the quality is awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
Monster is one of my favorite manga, so that's great to hear.
>> ARTICLE
I've been meaning to get started on it for a while now. I'll be down for this.
>> ARTICLE
I've been on episode 14 for a while now so i feel like having a discussion could help some of us get back into the anime! 
>> ARTICLE
I've seen some pretty excessive gore in anime, but goddamn, the bit with the nail clippers made me more uncomfortable than probably anything else before or since. 
>> ARTICLE
Ugh I had to skim that scene; it was too discomforting for me to watch.
>> ARTICLE
I was already wincing when he first raised those clippers on the catwalk. My imagination went wild with a dozen horrific ways to torture someone with nail clippers (this is why I don't like horror movies or games).
>> ARTICLE
Wow, more great episodes. It looks like the theme is that everyone has a monster inside of them. Grimmer with his violent face smashing, Anna who appears to be shooting and poisoning the corrupt, Eva with her blackmailing and hatred, Lunge who turns his back on his family, and Johan. Everyone has a different shade of darkness within them. I'm still unsure about Tenma though. The darkest thing he has done was wish some doctors were dead and shoot Roberto in self-defense.

**Episode 41**

* I guess Grimmer isn't perfect at reconnaissance and intuition as I thought he was. After some false assumptions, he eventually got to the truth though .

* It was unwise for Grimmer to just waltz into a place full of kids who were presumably brainwashed into violent killing machines. 

* Anna??? I think it's Anna. The hairstyle looks exactly like hers. I'm guessing that someone else killed those folks before Anna showed up. Anna killing non-threatening people is too out of character for her...unless she changed in that one scene when she remembered something about the three frogs and her the rest of her childhood.

**Episode 42**

* The fat cop is surprisingly competent with the unlicensed orphanage murder case. Usually, side-character policemen are incompetent compared to the main characters who break the rules--oh wait, he's actually a crooked cop. That explains it.

* Yeah, Grimmer isn't a super spy after all. He got caught, but at least he's really good at withholding information and resisting torture.

* Survivors of 511 Kinderheim!? I guess there are going to be more evil characters. So many characters in this show.

**Episode 43**

* New detective. And he tells the cops to detain anyone who looks suspicious...HAHAHAHAHAHA, what a noob!

* New detective putting the moves on Anna: "I'm Jan Suk, I'm not a stalker or anything." holy crap, this guy is hilarious! Even his name is funny. You could say he Suks at many things.

* Ah, so Anna isn't her real name; in fact, she has no name. Her being the monster that went west in the picture book makes even more sense now. I just hope someone will stop Johan before he eats Anna.

* I figured out that Grimmer's blood type is AB based on the police investigation. Japan believes blood types determine a person's personality (a lot like horoscopes). The description for AB type personalities fits Grimmer very well: aloof, likes freedom, can have opposite characteristics at the same time, etc.

* WHISKEY BONBONS! I totally remember the doctors dying from poisoned whiskey bonbons in the beginning. It bugs me how *only* the corrupted officers ate the bonbons just like how *only* the bad doctors ate the bonbons. The bonbons were offered to other innocent cops too (including Suk), but they declined. Too convenient.

* I'm still unsure if Anna is really a murderer now. [I came up with some theories elsewhere in this discussion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/32y442/spoilers_monster_rewatch_episode_41_42_and_43/cqgddzn) 
>> ARTICLE
Nina using the old Johan candy trick... but honestly, how do they poison them and reseal the package? Do they have connections in candy factory or something? :D

Seriously though, I don't know what to think about Nina at that point. Is she falling to the same condition as Johan, or was she like that all along? Or maybe she didn't really commit any of those crimes? We never actually see her killing anyone. Maybe she has a decoy? (conspiracy intensifies)

Yeah, Grimmer... that torture scene was hard to watch. Anime gore broke me, what the hell.

All in all, a lot of surprises in these episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I posted in the thread yesterday but no responses. Can you give a quick summary of events and characters up until this point? I watched a bit over half of this series before putting it on hold.
>> ARTICLE
I can try. Let's see so [](/s "The show is about Dr. Tenma, who saved a young boy instead of an important official which ended up nearly costing him his career and cost him his fiancee (Eva). A few years later, Tenma meets the boy, Johan, and finds out that he is a serial killer. He learns that Johan will likely go find his twin sister for unknown reasons. Tenma manages to get to her first and warns her (Anna) of Johan's plans. Anna's family dies but she and Tenma escape. She ditches Tenma and he is framed for the murder because of Eva giving (false) evidence to a detective (Lunge) because Tenma wouldn't take her back.")

[](/s "Tenma trains in how to shoot a gun and tracks Johan's past to an orphanage called Kinderheim 511. Apparently, the orphanage was designed to create the perfect soldiers. He learns that Johan ended up convincing nearly everyone in the orphanage to kill each other and they do. Tenma meets with some dude who used to help run the orphanage and learns that he is now trying to get this new kid (Deiter) to become Johan 2.0. Tenma manages to save the kid who then becomes his side-kick/friend.")

[](/s "Lunge's wife and daughter leave him because of his obsession with his cases and he becomes more determined to find Tenma. meanwhile Eva falls in love and has her heart broken, fueling her hatred towards Tenma for not taking her back.")

[](/s "Enter neo-nazi arc. Anna tries to infiltrate a neo-nazi group to learn about Johan. They capture her, hoping to lure Johan so that they can make him Hitler 2.0. Tenma's also captured by them but learns of the neo-nazi's plans to burn a Turkish district as a welcome to Johan ,so he send Dieter out to warn the people.Unlike Anna, he is instead taken to meet a guy named General Wolf who confesses to having found Johan and Anna in the Czech-German border and that he put Johan in Kinderheim 511 but put Anna in a different orphanage. he asks Tenma to  kill Johan  and to stop the Turkish district from burning. Anna escapes, Tenma succeeds adn saves the district with Dieter's help and returns to  find that Johan has killed most of the neo-nazi's while he was busy. Anna briefly meets with Tenma before leaving again.")

[](/s "Tenma goes to meet an old college buddy, a detective (Dr. Gillen) who at first believes that Johan is just a persona created by Tenma but he faces a case which forces him to believe that Johan is real. He helps Tenma escape a police pursuit but worries that Tenma may be unable to ever clear his name. meanwhile, Anna becomes friends with a former assassin while working as a waitress for a bit.")

[](/s "Lunge tries to lure in Tenma but is instead injured/saved by him. Later, Eva is saved by Tenma when she gets close to an assassin of Johan's (Roberto) who tries to destroy her proof of Johan's existence and to use her to kill Tenma.")

[] (/s "Enter Library/University arc. Story switches focus to two college students (Karl and Lotte). Karl's father is some rich guy (Hans George Schuwald)  he works for but who he never informs is his father. Lotte is his friend who tries to help him through his feeling toward his dad and presumably has a crush on him. Meanwhile, Schuwald hires a detective (Richard Braun) to investigate the suicide of an employee of his. Richard is a former alcoholic who works through his temptations by meeting with a psychiatrist (Dr. Julius Reichwein). Richard tells Reichwein all the details of his investigation. Meanwhile, Johan introduces himself as a Law student to Karl and Lotte and helps convince Karl to tell Schuwald that he is his father. He does and the two reunite as father and son. Johan, as a result is made this rich guy's trusted assistant. Meanwhile Richard's investigation nearly leads him to the truth, that Johan had tricked the young boy to get close to Schuwald, so Johan kills Richard, making his death look like a suicide.")

[](/s "Dr. Reichwein who had been told all the details of the case up until Richard's death and doesn't believe that it was a suicide, contacts a former student of his, Dr. Gillen, who believes the homicide may be connected to Tenma's case. Roberto attempts to kill Dr. Reichwein but he is saved by Tenma, who was informed by Dr. Gillen of the case. Dr.Reichwein and Tenma discuss the case and tenma finally gets his eyes on Johan's position. he is close to Schuwald. Schuwald decides to donate his books to a University and decided to have a speech for the occasion at the University library. Tenma decided to use a sniper rifle to kill Johan here on the day of the speech. Johan on the other hand, plans to kill Shuwald here to gain mad stackz as his assistant. BUT, in the library, Johan finds a book, "The nameless Monster" which awakens past memories within him and his plans change. Dieter meets a boy who had been influenced by Johan and convinces him not to attempt suicide.")

[](/s "The day of the speech, Johan sets the library on fire and locks the place, Roberto prevents Tenma from killing Johan. Anna/Nina finds out through Lotte, after befriending her about Johan and also attends the speech only to be injured and unable to kill Johan. Simultaneously, Dr. Gillen entrusts lunge with his views on Tenma's innocence and of his location. Lunge pretend to believe him and follows Tenma into the city. Tenma manages to help break everyone out of the burning library. Johan escapes from the city and Tenma ditches the city with Dieter in Dr.Schuwald's care. Nina/Anna takes Dieter to Prague  with her after recovering from her injuries in to figure out the secret behind some dreams she has been having. Tenma also leaves to Prague, learning from Schuwald that Johan and Anna's mother may reside there.")

[](/s "Tenma meets a man (Grimmer) on his way to Prague who helps him avoid the cops. Grimmer's a journalist studying child abuse and psychological reprogramming in former East Germany orphanages  like Kinderheim 511. Grimmer and Tenma split after arriving in Prague and Grimmer meets a former psychiatrist from Kinderheim 511.") 

Hopefully from here you can start at episode 41. if you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

EDIT: In paragraph 7, said that Schuwald was Lotte's dad. he's actually Karl's dad.

I can give you a rundown, I was reluctant to respond, because, well, I'm lazy. But here you go, someone please correct me if I get something wrong ;) I already see this is going to be a bit long, so brace yourself. Couldn't get it any shorter.

The show starts when a couple of East German diplomats who fled to the West part get murdered. Kenzo Tenma, prospering neurosurgeon, operates on one of the now-orphaned twins who has been shot in the head, disobeying an order to operate on the town's mayor. The victim, Johan Liebert, is actually the culprit - unbeknowst to Tenma or anyone else. His sister, Anna, stays at the same hospital.

Tenma loses his position in the hospital and is abandoned by his fiancee, hospital director's daughter - Eva. Shortly after though, the director is murdered along with two other staff members - iirc, they've all been poisoned by Johan. The kid disappears mysteriously. Investigation for murders starts, led by Inspector Lunge. Tenma is one of the main suspects, though for now he's left alone.

Time skip a few years ahead. The twins are now around 20-21 years old. Tenma treats a patient - Junkers - who is a suspect in the case of series of murders of middle-aged couples. He admits that he was hired to do it by Johan, though he refers to him only as 'the monster'. He runs away from the hospital in fear. Tenma follows and they reach an abandoned building, where they find Johan. Tenma sees him for the first time in years. Johan shoots the patient and walks away.

Meanwhile, Anna, Johan's sister, lives with her foster parents under the name 'Nina Fortner'. She goes to college and doesn't yet realize she's adopted - she lost her memories before the accident from first episodes. After the death of Junkers, Tenma is interested in the murders of middle-aged couples, knowing it's Johan's doing. He finds Nina and discovers that her parents might be the next target. He doesn't manage to save them, but he runs away with Nina, pursued by policemen corrupted by Johan. Nina and Tenma part ways.

After Tenma returned to his old position in hospital and even became chief surgeon, Eva tried to get back with him, to no avail. She now threatens Tenma that she will rat him to Lunge, having gotten hold of 'evidence' against him. Lunge connects him to the recent serious murders and this is all he needs. Tenma doesn't give in to threats, so he has to run away.

Now fugitive, Tenma practices shooting a gun, anticipating a confrontation with Johan. He meets Heckel, a burglar who tries to make an underground doctor out of him. They share a few adventures. Later, Tenma investigates Johan's past.

Johan and Anna/Nina were found as little children on East German-Czechoslovakian border. Their origin unknown, they were placed in separate orphanages. Johan wound up in 511 Kinderheim, an experimental orphanage led by Ministry of Internal Affairs. He ended up pitting all the kids and staff against each other, resulting in pretty much everyone's deaths. After the incident, he was put in the same foster family as Anna. After a few 'accidents' (Johan killing the parents) they were adopted by the Lieberts, diplomats from the 1st episode.

Tenma finds former official working in 511 Kinderheim at that time and gets the details from him. The man, Hartmann, is taking care of Dieter, kid from another orphanage. He abuses him; Tenma runs away with Dieter, who refuses to leave him from then on.

Both Tenma and Nina, who is also pursuing Johan on her own, learn about a criminal leader nicknamed 'Baby'. Baby plans to burn down the Turkish district in his town and utilize Johan in his fascist-nationalist plans. Johan is not so fond of the idea and kills Baby's men; Tenma and Nina manage to stop the fire and have an unexpected reunion. They find Johan's message - the monster inside him is 'growing'. It sounds like a cry for help.

Tenma meets up with Rudy, his old college friend, and manages to convince him of his innocence. Rudy will try to help him from then on. Meanwhile, Nina has her own chase and encounters Roberto, a hitman hired by Johan. She escapes - for now.

Lunge sets a trap for Tenma. He thinks 'Johan' is just an alter ego for the doctor. Lunge gets severely wounded and is treated by Tenma, but doesn't stop to chase him.

Roberto finds Eva and asks if she wants revenge on Tenma. When they find him, Eva realizes she actually doesn't want to kill him. Roberto, cheated, shoots Eva and runs away. Tenma tends to her wounds and leaves to continue his chase.

That's episode 25 and we're nearing the current arc. It shouldn't take this long to describe it, fewer events take place here. I think I'll take a break now, maybe describe the rest tomorrow - it's 12 am here. So stay tuned ;)

I have some conspiracy theories:

* It's possible that Nina was the one who poisoned those doctors with the whisky bonbons. The bonbons were a gift meant for Johan after all...correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember Johan admitting that it was him who added the poison--he only implied it when he said that he thought Tenma would be glad that those doctors died.

* It feels out of character for Nina to be killing people like this. Maybe it was Nina and Johan's mom? (a mom with nice legs), or maybe Johan was cross dressing as Nina? (/jk). It could also be someone completely random like a long lost sister (triplets? *Three* frogs?) If Nina is actually a murderer now, it's probably related to her childhood memories coming back in that one scene (when she was trying to remember what the three frogs were, and it suddenly hit her). I'm leaning towards Nina being the murderer though.
>> ARTICLE
OMG! When Nina found the book and started reading it, it was the creepiest thing ever.

I love this series so much.  Really looking forward to what Guillermo does with the live action series.

ahhhhhhhhhh, this is the first time I've heard of this! Thanks for making my day!!!! I'm so excited for this, hopefully they won't fuck it up...


Monster was one of the first anime I've watched, and it's still my favorite today! 

On a side note, I've never really read a manga and didn't like it the few times I had a little peak, so do you think I might like it if would commit myself to reading a whole story?

I didn't like it because it felt like reading a shitty version of a book that constricted my imagination. Also the art style looked unrealistic and fabricated, what hindered me from liking it or connecting to characters.

Do you get used to it and it gets better? Is it normal for people to at first dislike it or should I just stop?
>> ARTICLE
I've never actually had the chance to read the manga sadly, though I have heard great things about it.
>> ARTICLE
It's common to not immediately like an unfamiliar medium. You say that you've never more than peeked at a few mangas, so it's not weird at all that you don't seem fond of it.

> do you think I might like it if would commit myself to reading a whole story?

Maybe. It takes about two afternoons to find out. Find at least 3 finished manga shorter than 300 chapters (150 if it was a monthly manga), as different as possible, read the first 3 volumes of each one (~20 chapters) and then finish the most interesting one.

> the art style looked unrealistic and fabricated

I try not to get too caught up in the artstyle of individual manga. Many manga that look amazing towards the end look like shit early on, which is quite common when it's the authors first work. If you ask me, the first volumes of Beck look terrible and Slam Dunk's art is unimpressive, but both series see gradual improvement until they look stunning at the end. 

Style sometimes also changes because of the sheer length of the series. It's understandable that Ah! My Goddess! and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure look different when they both have been running for over a quarter of a century.

As for the art of Monster specifically, it remains consistent throughout the entire series and also 20th Century Boys. I can't tell you to ignore the art if it's really bothering you that much, all I can say is that I tend to eventually get used to the style of the author, even if I don't think it's that good.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the way it was done (in Japanese, much creepier than the English version) was fantastic. Very very chilling. Still creeps me out thinking about it though.
>> ARTICLE
Her eyes were insane, and later when she was remembering tings of the past repeating 'tadaima, okaeri, tadaima, okaeri...' was really intense.
>> ARTICLE
May be somewhat far fetched, but I hope they don't move the setting out of Germany and not let the main character be the Japanese prodigal doctor Tenma. I have a feeling they may shuffle around the nationalities and character types a bunch though.
>> ARTICLE
I hate to play devil's advocate here, but Tenma's nationality is not at all essential to the story. The only thing about his character that *needs* to be retained is him being a foreigner -- someone from outside of Germany, as it's the crux of his characterization.

That being said, the story absolutely *needs* to be set in Germany to work due to its subject matter. And either way, Del Toro's talked about how he wants to keep it 100% faithful *and* Urasawa has to approve each episode's script himself. I think it's gonna turn out brilliantly.
>> ARTICLE
It isn't but yes, he needs to be foreign, particularly a recognizable one especially because of the issues with racism, etc. It can't be just someone from the UK for example, that wouldn't be believable, so in fact, I expect him to be Asian. I personally would hate to see the 'doctor' not named Tenma but I think Del Toro will be as faithful as possible though.
>> ARTICLE
But there wasn't really any racism toward Tenma. In fact, the only time racism is addressed in Monster is with Johan's backstory, where he was [Spoiler](/s "conditioned to become the next Hitler. And even then, the issue is more with hatred and sociopathic tendencies than it is about racism. The Baby's involvement there is the only time racism is addressed explicitly.")

I see where you're coming from with the UK example, though, since it'd be a European in another European country. Either way, I trust Del Toro to make this work.
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly what I was talking about with The Baby, I guess I wasn't clear. Yes it wasn't prevalent (in Monster overall, the other characters recognize that he is Japanese/Asian but there is no actual racism), but it's in the story and if Tenma isn't recognizable as a definite foreigner then it wouldn't have played out like that. I was just using it to make the point that 'Tenma' can't be any type of foreigner, otherwise they would leave it out/change that scene drastically and I don't think del Toro would do that. I'm only arguing this for the purposes of having a 'perfect' (literal to some degree) faithful adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I see where you're coming from. We need different protagonists in TV anyway, and this seems like a good opportunity to change that.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, completely agree. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, I  don't really disagree with that. I just want Naoki Urasawa's send off to Osamu Tezuka with the Tenma character name being retained somehow. It is not something absolutely crucial of course. I just think it'd be nice to see the character be retained. 
>> ARTICLE
That's fair. I'm sure even if our Tenma is changed, Urasawa will ask for *someone* named Tenma in there.
>> ARTICLE
There was an interview recently where he said that his adaptation would be as faithful as possible. He appeared to be a very big Monster fan in it so I can't see it being messed up (too badly at least) unless someone does it.
>> ARTICLE
IDK Guillermo is such a fan boy, i don't really see him screwing it up too bad.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think del Toro would do that, he seems to really respect the sources he works from.  Especially since a large part of Monster's appeal is its international nature; outside of sci-fi stuff it's not often you see non-Japanese settings and characters treated as well as in Monster.

If you're interested, the original art was printed in storybook form in a collectible book along with the other stories from Monster (man with the big eyes, etc) and some other art/writing from the series.  I got a copy on eBay for $40 or so.

Loved this little story in "Monster" - mostly because it somewhat reminded me of my childhood cartoons (art, presentation, etc), so it left me feeling nostalgic :)

Read the manga, probably one of the best I've read. Love Urasawa, 20th Century Boys was awesome too and Pluto was good.
>> ARTICLE
We're was page 8 loved it though 
>> ARTICLE
That's a good story, but there was another story as well, can't quite remeber how it went, but it was a tragedy.

Something like somebody needed help and the helper then got himself in trouble, by helping.
>> ARTICLE
What would be the miral of this story?
>> ARTICLE
Its less a story that has a moral, and more used to describe people.
>> ARTICLE
I would say the main theme of the story is self-destruction.

The monster's journey for a name is self-destructive. He can take a name but it always ends up causing him to kill everyone around him. This destroys the lives he enjoys and ultimately makes his name pointless. This is just like how people who strive for riches, fame, revenge, or other goals can often be self-destructive. Just like the monster, they might achieve their goal but find that it never was important in the first place. A parallel here is the second monster, who decides that a name isn't important. The first monster, on the other hand, has a name but is no closer to being called by any name.

Another idea is how people can be self-destructive by focusing on short term goals. The people who willingly let the monster inside them assured their doom in return for some temporary benefit. Ultimately, accepting the monster hurt them in the end.


>> ARTICLE
The other side of that monster analogy being that the scariest and truest of monsters are the ones who has no self regard or self respect and hence the state of being a self devouring/destroying monster is actually their entire end goal and their 'ideal' place. I don't want to elaborate too much on that as it's pure spoiler territory though.

It's important to keep in mind that Del Toro is also supposedly working on *a lot* of other projects including:

[The Strain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strain_\(TV_series\))

[Crimson Peak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson_Peak)

An adaptation of Frankenstein for Universal

[At the Mountains of Madness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness#Film)

Something to do with Van Helsing

A 3D Haunted Mansion movie for Disney

A film adaptation of Hater by David Moody

[A freaking video game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insane_\(2013_video_game\))

An adaptation of Beauty and the Beast starring Emma Watson

[A Dark Universe movie](http://www.sohood.com/2013/01/movie-guillermo-del-toro-confirms-dc-dark-universe-movie/)

Some movie called Midnight Delivery

I have no idea how many of these are actually things he's going to do, but the point is the man seems to be working on *everything*.
>> ARTICLE
The Strain sounds like a vampire show I can actually get behind...not this "vampires as lovers" crap (imo) we've had these last few years.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure Mountains of Madness has been canned - he did Pacific Rim instead.

I don't know how many of these projects he's involved in the day-to-day running of, either - he gets a producer and writer credit on a lot of stuff, but he's not directing all of it. I always got the impression he'd help write the first episode of a Monster adaptation (and maybe direct it), but would generally just be an Executive Producer.
>> ARTICLE
The status of a lot of these projects is uncertain, in fact, I didn't list a few because I felt they were very unlikely. It just seems odd to me that he's attached to so many projects when I don't see most people put out more than two things a year.
>> ARTICLE
It really sucks that Mountains of Madness probably isn't happening.

From the Wikipedia article linked above:

> "The studio is really nervous about...it not having a love story or happy ending"

Really Warner Bros.?  *Really?* You want a love story or a happy ending with Lovecraft?!
>> ARTICLE
Did you read the article.

Del Toro planed to make a **pilot** to submit to HBO. If a pilot does well, then it is signed up for a full show.

For every TV show you see on the air now there are about tens of pilots that didn't make it.
>> ARTICLE
It has been about 7 months since that article and no new news, should I be worried that the pilot didn't turn out well?
>> ARTICLE
Meh, I really don't think Monster needs an adaptation, it's already realistic enough.
>> ARTICLE
It would be an important step towards exposing more people to the medium. If in the opening in has something like "based on the anime Monster" or something like that it could lead to increased interest. If it all works out just maybe we'll see more mature anime being produced, which is something I feel has been in heavy decline. 
>> ARTICLE
> "based on the anime Monster"

It's probably going to be based on the manga, rather than adapting the anime (although I have to confess I don't know how closely the anime mirrored the original, so maybe there's not much in it).
>> ARTICLE
The anime pretty much matches the manga word-for-word and scene-for-scene. So no, not really any different.
>> ARTICLE
Del Toro is a busy man. He's working on more than one this. The Strain's pilot was filmed back in September (right after Pacific Rim) and it did well with Fox so now he's working on filming that TV series which will be released in July. Leaves little room to work on Monster's pilot.
>> ARTICLE
del toro did pacific rim for 190 mil last summer.  dude is big time.

if del toro does a pilot for a can't miss adaptation like monster. hbo is obviously going to green-light at least the first season.   

it hasn't come off yet obviously.

 
>> ARTICLE
> del toro did pacific rim for 190 mil last summer. dude is big time.

Pacific Rim wasn't a runaway success. It only took about $101m domestic, and less than $500m internationally. Considering a nearly-$200m budget, that's far from being a hit - I'd be pleasantly surprised if they managed to get a sequel green-lit with anything like the same budget.

I'm not entirely sure more people know del Toro's name off the back of Pacific Rim, either - considering its middling ticket sales, he's unlikely to have reached much of a new audience, and the reviews for the film weren't great either.

set it in israel instead of 80's germany.

Why Israel?

>> ARTICLE
well in monster you have a lot of good guys and bad guys.  for example the nazi are bad guys.  the people that ran the orphanage are bad guys.  i think updating the nazi to say modern day israel or modern day palestine it adds a layer to show where its like i dont know who is right and wrong. 


>> ARTICLE
> updating the nazi to say modern day israel

That would *never* get on TV in the United States.
>> ARTICLE
Or you could just set it in the original setting and leave it the fuck alone. If it ain't broke don't change it.
>> ARTICLE
they already have a show in that setting its great.


why make an adaptation if you are not going to change anything?
>> ARTICLE
Because there are shows that you can't just straight up adapt because it's not feasible. Monster on the other hand could work out perfectly. 
>> ARTICLE
that is what i am saying monster is a good show.  if you like monster the way it is just watch monster again.   

the point of making an adaptation should be to make it better than the original.   

i think an updated setting would be a nice touch.  

anime has used an updated setting to great effect numerous times.  gankusuo, roman empire to space.  


>> ARTICLE
The point of making an adaptation is to adapt it to a new medium, not completely change it. They aren't making this to go side by side with the anime as an alternate version, they are adapting it.
>> ARTICLE
their is really only one adaptation that is a shot by shot recreation of its original,  psycho by gus van sant. 

and everyone's reaction to that movie was what was point.    

if you are recreating a tv show from another tv show and are not going to change anything then ....

what is the point?

just watch monster again if you don't want to see monster in israel.



>> ARTICLE
You fail to understand the issue here. It's like making a movie out of a book, or an anime out of a manga. It's a medium change. It expands the audience. There are plenty of people who would love monster but don't know about it, and would not think that anime could have such amazing shows. By bringing Monster to HBO the story will spread to more people, and the creators will make more money. Changing a great thing is most likely to make it worse.

Monster the anime is already pretty close to an exact adaptation of the manga. The HBO series is most likely to be the same, as it should be. 

It's not a re-imagining, it's an adaptation. There is a huge difference. The contract for this adaption stipulates that they cannot add extra content to increase episode count and that the original author has to approve all the scripts for the first season. This tells us that they are looking to make an adaptation that is as close to the original as possible.

They're not human panties, they're made for lamias. They're kinda like a sticker. (The protagonist doesn't even know what they are when he first sees them, outside of the context of Miia wearing them.)

It's an ecchi harem show with an actually decent male protagonist and a bunch of weird but accessible monmusu fetish stuff. It prints money.
>> ARTICLE
As a female fan, it's a great show even besides the sex stuff; lots of adorable/funny things and pretty interesting characters. The mangaka puts a lot of thought into how demihuman biology would make for humorous situation
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't take itself seriously, it's really up front and totally willing to say, 'look, fanservice!' and not be shy about it, or 'harem!' and not pull the 'idiot = main character' card. And it takes the harem tropes and kinda breaks most of them; it's fun to watch which trope is abused or discarded as it develops.

There are some great moments with the characters, but there's far more in the manga... but they do a great job with the characters, and it's pure leave your brain parked at the door popcorn anime.

Although I did wish they'd done the 'when the parents visit' arc.

But, as with everything, YMMV.

Man, Episode 4. It's one of those episodes that have stuck with me for a long time and I rewatch specific parts of. The last ten minutes of the episode give me chills every time I watch them. It just does everything right. The weather, the lighting, the suspense, Johan's face conceded in shadow, these little things make this one of my favorite moments ever.
>> ARTICLE
I like how he calls him sensei.. its totally creepy because just a few minutes ago you see how Junkers tells Tenma how much he see him as a parent because he saves his life and he also calls him sensei, so in a way Johan calling Tenma the same way makes you think that Tenma is like a parent for Johan and he might feel responsible for Johan's actions, which is not the only reason why Tenma feels responsible for this, but it adds up, giving the characters a really good depth.

Lunge, possibly my favourite character. I like his relentless and deliberate demeanour. The unsettling guy you want working for you, but you would never invite to your house.
>> ARTICLE
I had to just say nooo [biiiitch](http://i.imgur.com/5LVb46w.jpg)  right at this moment. 

Your tears they must have been [delicious](http://i.imgur.com/og1QyKZ.jpg).

so WOW this show   how am i going to be able to stop myself from marathoning !  because of the older art i always pushed it off  so THANK YOU for this rewatch gave me a good reason to watch  and i love reading the discussions

also holy shit how about that liebert guy huh


>> ARTICLE
Such sweet justice.
>> ARTICLE
I was like "fuck yeah, you go tenma. fuck her."

and yes, although it is older art I appreciate it a lot. the art is somewhat more realistic than modern art in anime, in my opinion. Which works very well -- it shows people as they are -- and that often is ugly.
>> ARTICLE
Also, note how she is less ugly after she has lost everything, and becomes ugly again, even uglier than before, once she marries for money several times during the 9 year jump. You can see similar artistic changes with Tenma - his face art is more innocent at the start, but as he gets more involved, you can see subtle changes in the eyes, the brow, and his mouth.
>> ARTICLE
Huh,  I'll have to pay attention to that.  I would spoiler some of that though,  because obviously what tenma is going to do isn't clear yet. 
>> ARTICLE
i totally agree!  i never payed close attention to the art    in my head i just listed it amongst yuyu hakusho rurouni kenshin cow boy be bop etc and thought  ill get to it    but watching it now   wow  rreally do like the more realistic aproach they take to it
>> ARTICLE
This is the only show I've seen that puts the same detail into people's noses as every other part of their face, and I appreciate it. Lately it seems like every anime character's face is a dinner plate with eyes and a mouth drawn on, but Monster made sure to make every person detailed, realistic, and distinctive. It's like an entire cast of ugly, misshapen, fleshy, snowflakes.
>> ARTICLE
>fuck yeah, you go tenma. fuck her.

[nice](http://i.imgur.com/d0Mu9rQ.jpg)

the moment when she touch his hand, I felt so disgusted, like for real. Good for Tenma for not going back to that, fuck that shit
>> ARTICLE
Episode 4 was probably the episode that REALLY got me hooked into the show the first time. Johan is so menacing yet...calm? It really interested me and the whole moral dilemma of choosing to save a normal person becomes even more interesting when you consider "does it matter if that person would grow up to be evil?"
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
I really like those thoughts on lunge!  He definitely does seem similar to Javert - -  very obsessed with his investigation. 
>> ARTICLE
And so we meet Johan. Episode 4 also marks the end of the first Volume of the manga. I've been reading through the manga in parallel to these episode and they are damn near identical down to the cinematography and some line are identical. The only real differences is some of the dialog is trimmed down and one scene where Tenma runs into Eva is on a date with some guy. 

Really good so far, and I love the music. 

>> ARTICLE
First 4 episodes really sets up this show nicely.
>> ARTICLE
I want to talk about the OP sequence for a little and how brilliant it is in capturing the tone of the series. In the OP, notice how he is always looking over his shoulder at the distant ethereal voices, but there is never anything there once he looks, ending with Tenma alone in the middle of nowhere, like his quest to find Johan. Doesn't need any sappy lyrics to tell you what Monster is about. Master-class in OP sequences.
>> ARTICLE
First timer here. I don't really recall watching any other psychological thrillers except psycho pass if that counts. These starting episodes are amazing especially episode 4. I bet it was the sister who killed their parents and tried to kill Johan but we will see where that goes - I only half believe it right now.
>> ARTICLE
When I heard how the doctors died from the candy meant for Johan, I thought he wasn't a killer after all and that someone was trying to kill Johan. But it turned out the kid planted the poison for the doctors. I find it very hard to believe that Johan could predict that those *specific* doctors would visit him and eat a *specific* bag of candy. We know the doctors were kind of scumbags to begin with, but who would've predicted that they'd steal candy from an unconscious kid? It broke my immersion. 

The timeskip was unexpected because I thought we would have a child serial killer (because evil children are creepy as hell). But an innocent-looking, blonde Aryan with a soft-spoken voice works too. 

The confrontation between Johan and Dr. Tenma was captivating. Tenma's decision nine years ago resulted in him regaining his purpose in life (saving lives) and the birth of a serial killer. A killer vs. a lifesaver. Between them is a criminal whose actions facilitated the murder of innocent people, but now wants to start over and redeem himself. In a way, he represents a moral gray area. Tenma selflessly believes he can be redeemed. Johan selfishly believes he must be killed. The two opposing characters are like yin and yang--opposites, but both with a bit of the other in themselves. Johan is evil, but he has enough good in him to be thankful towards Tenma and spare his life. Tenma is good, but he has enough evil in him to wish certain people were dead.

I initially thought that Johan killed his parents because it would explain why his sister freaked out upon seeing him. Now I'm not so sure. Maybe the sight of him just brought back traumatic memories of her parents dying. So maybe Johan's brain surgery *did* change his personality to be a serial killer, or he always had homicidal tendencies to begin with. I'm betting that by the end of the show, Dr. Tenma will still show compassion towards Johan and believe that he still deserves to live...despite whatever atrocities Johan causes.
>> ARTICLE
I love how they reveal Johan's face.
>> ARTICLE
Bonjourno, I'm joining you guys at ep 7! See ya there

i always forgot watch this to fully. I start watch few episode and never finished

Should I be watching these episodes before the discussions come out? (3 and 4 before discussions for 3 and 4 get posted)
>> ARTICLE
Preferably yes, and that's what I'm doing, but do it however you want. I'm sure that if you're reminded to watch when you see the threads, there will be no problem. That being said, they're probably going to be posted later in the evening from now on, so that's less time to watch it if you plan on discussing while the thread is still active. Overall, up to you though.
>> ARTICLE
It definitely feels as if some supernatural forces are at play here... how else could Johan put poison in those candies and predict that the doctors would eat them? I'm kinda surprised by the time skip, I expected these episodes to be focused more on those mysterious murders, and suddenly we're 9 years later and everything is *pretty much* explained.

Tenma is obviously in over his head with that security bureau investigator. I'm curious to see what happens next.
>> ARTICLE
I may have watched 12 episodes last night...
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I keep writing a lot when I don't mean to. Oh well, I can't help it.

**Episode 47: Jigsaw of a past**

* I just realized that Johan must've lived in that area for a long while because so many neighbors know "Anna". Could this mean something?

* Lots of foreshadowing with Nina's fragmented flashbacks. There was a blonde woman who I think is the mom. I'm not sure the wine and roses mean though. There was a celebration of some sort, and Anna escaped through some thorny rose bushes? There's "The Man of the Red Rose Mansion", Franz Bonaparta, who took Johan and the mother away; so clearly that's what the roses refer to. This being a dark show, I bet the celebration was about something devious, but something went wrong--hence the broken wine glass. Perhaps it's the moment that Johan murdered someone for the first time?

* We finally see the white-gloved hand that has always been in the OP.

* Bonaparta made the monster picture book...the pieces are starting to fall into place. There's probably some kind of experiment that went on.

* Nina remembers seeing herself come home...either it was young Johan made to look like Nina, or there's a third sibling after all (i.e. Nina's identical twin).

**Episode 48: Speculations and Lunge 2.0**

**Edit: Crossed out some parts due to misinterpretation of a plot point**


* I knew leaving the tape with Suk's mom was a bad idea!

* Lunge drinking beer!?!? What happened to him? He's not even wearing a suit or a tie. I guess realizing Johan was real snapped him back into reality. There's still hope for Lunge to have a normal life after all. My fingers are crossed that he'll get back with his family and hold his grandson.

* It's been so long, I forgot how good of a detective Lunge can be.

* Why would Bonaparta have sketches of the twins and their mom? He must be related to them somehow. Is he a close friend? A relative? The father!?

* ~~Bonaparta's real name is Johan...whaaat. Does this mean that the picture book was actually about Bonaparta? Or is it his plan for the twins?~~ Is the picture book some plan for the twins? What could the prince represent? What is the connection? I thought the book was just a random story that happened to symbolically relate to the twins, but it holds more significance than I had thought.

* Bonaparta's sketches! Holy crap, when I saw the ED I realized that the prince in the book looks just like the sketch of Johan! Maybe the prince represents Johan's innocence and humanity? Wait, I remember the prince was sick and decided to give the monster his name and the monster went inside of him. Maybe Johan was sick as a boy and some experimentation went down? MAYBE BONAPARTA ~~(A.K.A JOHAN)~~ TRANSPLANTED HIS BRAIN INTO JOHAN!? Nah, this isn't science fiction...right? Right? Maybe he just passed on the torch to Johan with his evil ideas and philosophies.

**Episode 49: Johan's Hell vs Grimmer's Real Tears**

* Grimmer lost his emotions at 511 Kinderheim? But then why the picnics? Why is he so kind to those in need? I find it hard to believe that there is no emotion behind his good deeds. And apparently, his smile was fake this whole time. It makes sense seeing how his smile is rather unusual to begin with.

* Dang, Johan, why are you trying to give that kid an existential crisis? I think Johan has mother abandonment issues of his own. It would explain many of his murders as I suspected.

* DAMN, Johan, why are you trying to give that kid suicidal depression? That's so messed up how he's convincing him that no one wants him...

* OH SHIT, Johan! I had a lightbulb moment and I think I understand you now! **Johan wants the rest of the world to understand the hell inside of him by putting others through the same kind of hell.** I think his personal hell comes from feeling betrayed and abandoned by his mother when he thought she loved him. So he does the same thing in reverse by being the perfect adopted son only to betray and abandon his foster parents later on. Not only that, it explains how he could easily manipulate the ex-alcoholic detective, Richard, into believing that his daughter *doesn't want him*, pushing him to suicide. It explains how Johan can easily manipulate people with parent issues into becoming suicidal killers. It explains how he got kids to play the dangerous rooftop game. It explains Johan's interest in reuniting Schubert with his son and then "changing his mind". Every crime is related to putting other people through a hell of abandonment one way or another by pushing the right buttons. It even explains why he abandoned the criminal world bank. My mind is blown. I could be off target, but it feels so right to me.

* ...Fuck, Grimmer, the way you comforted that kid, Milos, was beautiful. Milos didn't respond to Grimmer's fake faces. Milos only responded and felt wanted when Grimmer showed genuine emotion--emotion Grimmer hadn't felt for decades. The fact that Milos caused Grimmer's emotions to break through makes this scene that much more powerful. I had so many feels when Milos grabbed onto Grimmer tightly. This is probably my favorite scene in the show so far. It brought a tear to my eye.

I wonder what would happen if Johan felt wanted and loved for who he *was* rather than *what he could do for others.*
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure bonapartas name isn't Johan. 

And don't be sorry for writing too much,  I'm always happy to see you enjoying it so much =') and I enjoy reading your thoughts
>> ARTICLE
Oops, I misinterpreted the scene where someone translated the last page of the picture book to Lunge over the phone. "He finally had a name, but all the people who could call him by that name have disappeared. And Johan was such a nice name too." I thought he was talking about Bonaparta instead of quoting the book itself. I'll edit my post so people don't get confused.

And thanks, this is my first time critically thinking about a show episode by episode and writing about it. Usually I just binge through episodes without really thinking and let the reveals surprise me. I'm savoring and processing the show better this way thanks to this rewatch. 

I'm making these posts for myself more than anything, but I'm glad people are getting something out of it. I'm just self-conscious that I'm spending too much time on these posts when I should be doing other things :)
>> ARTICLE
Hehe,  your thoughts are super interesting to read.  I'm glad you're enjoying it so much! And yeah,  your critical thinking is usually pretty on point and interesting to read.  Really enjoy it. 
>> ARTICLE
Milos is going to grow up a really cynical person. His childhood is ending so early that I feel almost sorry for him.

And I totally sympathize with Grimmer since that last episode. *Is that what I'm supposed to feel?* Totally a question I ask myself at times, I'm beginning to understand why you guys like him so much.

Not much to say in the way of the story. I hope to see it slowly resolving in the next episodes, I don't have any serious assumptions. I guess it was the Czechoslovakian police - or namely, Franz Bonaparta - who shaped Johan into who he is now, but I have no idea how at the point. Here's hoping we're in for a satisfying conclusion nearing the end of the show ;)
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Milos will become a cynical person. Grimmer showed him that he cared and wanted him to exist. After seeing so much darkness on the streets, he at least knows that there are still good people like Grimmer in the world. 

Granted, he might be traumatized from that one sex scene.

Dakimakura's are really flexible (assuming similar quality of inner as what I have) so I imagine you could coil it first and then get inside, kind of like a sleeping bag. Don't think it would be great for your back though like that.

Otherwise you could use it as a matress which might work better.

It's 7m long but I think the width is probably the same as a normal pillow? I don't really think it'd work as a mattress.

You're missing out.

As someone who's read the manga, I'm really happy with the adaptation. It's not as lewd as I was expecting (the fanservice isn't DxD level), but it has things implied. The "censoring" is done naturally and there's no obnoxious beams of light and steam a la To Love-Ru. 

The VAs and animation both greatly exceeded my expectations.

Overall, great adaptation so far, and the series is a nice break from typical harems. 
>> ARTICLE
The censoring has mostly been done by cropping. Expect the blurays to have uncropped scenes.

As another manga reader, I find the anime's approach to the lewd bits to be pretty creatively well done in terms of preserving the scenes while also not relying on unnatural beams of light or blackbars.

Probably not as bad as you think. Like most dakimakuras, this is probably just sold as a cover, which can be rolled up like a big scroll.

It would need to include the inner as well. You wont be able to find an inner that side otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
According to [their tweet](https://twitter.com/monmusuofficial/status/622283101448704000), four standard-size dakimakura pillows are needed to stuff the thing with. Though, according to my calculations, four does come up a bit short (240 inches, whilst 7 meters = 276 inches), so you'd need a smaller pillow as well.

In any case, it could come with an inner, or, now could be the right time to invest in a sewing machine, some fabric, and lots of stuffing.

>u cant deport her

Good call.

Regarding the rest, mmm probably but the box would still end up being massive since while the inner will compress it wont compress *that* much. Would be like getting 6 sleeping bags in one box.

The inners usually come vacuum-packed for shipping, so it could probably be made reasonably compact.

I like this answer. It deflects the issue of a pornographic scene by comparing it to what they watch. Then the most they could say is he's perhaps too young for that stuff but the content itself is glossed over.

You're screwed if they request to see it in context, though. Some ecchi moments can be explained, but a show that's practically porn, not so much.
>> ARTICLE
People tend to be hypocrites in that regard, it won't work. 

It's kind of how my mother can despise me for playing video games as a hobby and spend her whole spare time playing shitty facebook games or zuma. 
>> ARTICLE
The hypocrisy can't be helped, sadly. But "despise" is a strong word. It's more likely that your parents simply expect "better" from you: getting involved with the community, doing yard work, studying harder, etc. It's a parent's job to prepare a child for the world, though they're imperfect creatures themselves and often go overboard, forgetting what they were like as children.

I suppose I was lucky. My parents saw me as a shut-in but thought, "eh, he gets good grades and isn't involved with the wrong crowd. It could be worse." They weren't thrilled that I played video games and watched cartoons a lot, but mostly left me be. That said, I could have used an earlier push.

I plan on it. But I just started Shuffle! and am thinking of picking Zero no Tsukaima back up again so I have so much shit to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Zero no Tsukaima... sometimes it makes you think there is relationship or character progression... There's not. Progression would break the winning formula.

I wasted so much time on that show. It definitely makes you want to watch more because it constantly seems promising. But as of halfway through season 3, things are basically no different than halfway through season 1... Goddamn ZnT.
>> ARTICLE
I also heard that the end of season 4 is what makes the series worth it (as there's actually some fucking progress in character development). Also, let me recommend Shuffle!, as I'm currently watching it. It's a harem with a conclusive ending (I know who he chooses, I looked it up, couldn't resist). Tell me if you want the ending spoiled, but I'm still finding it entertaining either way and think you should check it out!
>> ARTICLE
Season 1 was alright. If they stopped at the end of season 2 I'd have enjoyed the series quite a bit. Season 3 was a goddamn disgrace, to the point that it soured much of my enjoyment of everything before that. I mean really. After all that decent quality relationship progression, they apparently realized they didn't know what to do anymore so they decided to do it all again.

Seriously who the fuck allowed that. So many GOOD anime that end after a single season despite plenty of source material left, and Zero no fucking Tsukaima gets 4 seasons. Just ugh...

Anyway, I'll check out Shuffle. I'll never willingly watch another second of ZnT though. Fuck that show. I haven't thought about it in so long, the fact that I still have this much rage for it says something.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, fair enough. I started binging Zero last week, put it on hold, and now it's sitting on my watch list. I stopped at the end of episode of 5 of season 2, and I know quite a few spoilers (oops). If it helps you get to the end/makes it worth it, I know [someone](/s "gets married by the end of season 4, and though the guy that recommended it didn't tell me, my guess would have to be Louise and Saito"), and that's the only reason season 2 is even on my watching list still. Also, I know how season ends, which is cool, and my plan (before I put it on hold) was because my first week of school starts today, and I don't need to deal with PADS, to watch the rest of season 2 and the first 3 or 4 eps of season 3. Now, I'm watching Shuffle! (I'm sad I couldn't binge it last night, but I got 10 eps done) and I like it much fucking better, because I just wanted a good harem with a conclusive ending, and that's what this is (sadly, I know who he chooses, but I approve, so oh well).
>> ARTICLE
If you want, I can spoil the ending of season 2 + beginning of s3 for you, and it will probably save you some time and frustration. I really tried to give s3 a chance after the beginning but... ugh.

I dunno. That kind of bullshit. My familly usually doesn't give a damn when it comes to anime. I'd be rather happy to talk about it with them. Just take time to talk about it calmy and maybe they'll even find interest in it... Well, maybe not in MonMusu, but... y'know...

Be straight with them. Explain why you like it, that it's not meant to be taken seriously, and that it's bothering you that they assume the worst from a single show you were watching on your computer. I'm sure they'll understand. Hell, they might even commend you for your honesty. 
>> ARTICLE
Given that some if not all the creatures are based off Greek myth, just say it's an anime based on that. Cite sources in Greek myths to back up your claim and then further add on the Japanese are a bit weird and like making everything look cute. Or have big boobs. Best to feign confusion as to why that is even though we all know why we like it.

Don't worry, my father caught me reading tsugumomo.

Damn. I guess my parents really don't care.

Some time ago i was watching Ikkitousen and my mother came in while Hakufu got strangled till pissing herself by Ryomu, and some weeks later she also came in precisely during the awkward fuck of Kurono on Kishimoto

Both times she didn't even care

I love how he said nothing, just turned and noped the fuck out. But seriously just say you were watching a show and that was a bad moment to walk in on.

Tell him you are watching a show about a guy who lives with a bunch of mutant hybrid human animal women. 

If he answers, "like 'TerraFormars'?" Maybe like 'TerraFormars' if the characters lived like the Aqua Teen Hunger Force and did, basically, nothing all the time.

The last episode was great, a bird girl played Wii and a guy with no personality looked confused.

Reminds me of that time my dad caught me making lesbian porn gifs for my friends when I was like 11. I tried to tell him it wasn't for me and some guys on the internet asked me to make it as if to mitigate it or something lol.

lmao when I was a kid and my father caught me watching porn, I'd just tell him it was pop ups.

I watched High School DxD while my parents were visiting. They glanced and looked away.

how old are you?

I don't get the obsession with Monster Musume. Wanna explain what the fuck it's about OP?
>> ARTICLE
Why do you think OP is obsessed with MonMusu? You can watch a show without being obsessed with it.
>> ARTICLE
I ment everyone lately. I've been hearing so much about it, I guess this is what people talk about when they go off about the hype on Steins;Gate. I finally understand.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think people are obsessed. MonMusu is an enjoyable ecchi/harem and a good break from more serious shows. I really enjoy it but I am in no way obsessed.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mean obsessed as in literally obsessed. I ment it's the new show everyone is talking about.
>> ARTICLE
Most likely because there usually aren't shows with Monster girls. That makes MonMusu a good answer for many different kind of threads.

>> ARTICLE
What's fun about plunging head-first into shit that labels you a pervert weeaboo virgin cartoon fapper?  Doesn't sound fun to me.  

Again, bring on the downvotes, but these kind of people make up 90% of this subreddit and the reason anime will never be considered "respectable."
>> ARTICLE
NO FUN ALLOWED
>> ARTICLE
I mean if you think watching what's basically cartoon porn is fun.  Like, yeah, sure, go for it if that's what floats your boat, but let's not pretend that there's anything to find in that series besides stuff for people to masturbate to.  It doesn't tell a story like "Monster" or "Death Note."  It doesn't have believable, relatable characters like "Steins;Gate" or "Neon Genesis Evangelion."  So what DOES it have?  Cartoon tits...

I don't understand people having discussions and treating Monster Musume like it's anything besides porn.  I can't understand why anyone would want to let the world know what they masturbate to and then proceed to talk about it with other people who also masturbate to the same things.  I don't understand 90% of this subreddit.

Call me a casual.  Call me a normie.  I don't care.  Fed up with seeing ecchi make it to the frontpage of /r/anime every fucking two days and then everyone treat it like it's a normal thing for anime-watchers to enjoy.  Ecchi is the junk food of anime.  If it was band it would be Nickelback.  If it was a browser it would be Internet Explorer.  Fucking hate this fanbase and its shit fuckin' taste when they can hop on a show's bandwagon for the entire reason of "DURR DURR THERE WAZ SEXI GURLS ND AYE GOT BONURZ."  Not because the characters deal with complex, gut-wrenching issues that are integral to some important, overarching theme and plot.  Not because developments are constantly introduced that make the audience view the entire story through a different perspective.  Not because of a genuinely thought-provoking, existential experience one gains when completing it.  But because it had big fat tits on a centaur.  

Fuck this subreddit...
>> ARTICLE
Because fuck what it labels me, for me it's just about fun enough to watch that I'm not likely to drop it, and I only picked it up because I saw a comment saying it will give you strange fetishes so I was like "challenge accepted".

Tell him your computer lagged for a bit and it ended up playing that video.
>> ARTICLE
That makes no sense. Lagging implies the computer temporarily was unresponsive. How can a video play when a computer is unresponsive?
>> ARTICLE
The browser was lagging, but Flash Player was still running normally. It has a lot to do with drivers, C++ directories, and API servers. Yeah, that's it.
>> ARTICLE
I tend to click alot when that happens and when it finally goes back to normal I accidentally click a link I don't want to open.

just tell them what it was, it's only natural that you watch and enjoy something heavily based around the gender you're attracted to.

what kind of parent would get angry at their kid for being normal?
>> ARTICLE
Grimmer is the best character in this whole show hands down.  It's sad that it takes this long for him to be introduced, because people who drop this show before seeing him don't know what they are missing.  He is one of the most complex, interesting, nicest, scariest character you will ever see in this anime.  I love Mr.Grimmer and I always think of him when I think of the show Monster.  DON'T STOP SMILING.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. When I think Monster, I think Tenma, Johan, Lunge, and Grimmer. In no particular order. Then I think about Dieter and Anna, and the rest of the characters start flooding in. But hose 4 immediately spring to mind
>> ARTICLE
I take it he becomes an important character later on? Huh. Didn't make much of an impression, but I'll wait.

The highlights of these episodes for me were Tenma shooting Roberto and the twins' mother revelation. I wonder what the latter means for the episodes to come.
>> ARTICLE
He's just a generally memorable and well written character. I won't say anything else on the subject to avoid spoilery territory
>> ARTICLE
Thoughts:

* I figured Tenma could shoot Roberto in a kill or be killed situation, and I'm not surprised that Tenma hesitated to shoot a defenseless Johan. But I am surprised that Anna missed all of her shots. It makes me wonder if she missed on purpose.

* Nice throwback with Johan pointing at his forehead. He probably did the exact same thing the night Anna shot him in the head. It almost came full circle. Tenma took a bullet out of Johan's head, and now he was about to put a bullet back in. Speaking of circles...I wonder if Johan is going to get shot in the head and Tenma is going to perform surgery to save him like he did over a decade ago. Having a symmetrical beginning and end would make the story real nice and tidy. Even though Johan comes off as absolute evil to almost everyone, I still think he has some shred of humanity in him because of his emotional scream on seeing the picture book. I also remember him crying way back in the beginning as a boy when Anna ran away from him in the hospital.

* I'm glad Lunge is finally starting to track down Johan. Him trying to be Johan could lead to some bad consequences though since there is an evil hell in Johan.

* The mom is alive!? She's probably crazy and probably linked to some traumatizing event.

* One episode and I'm already liking Grimmer. It feels so right to add a journalist/spy to the show next to the doctors, psychologists, detectives, assassins, and mobsters. So many mind games. Is he actually gullible though when he gave money to the man at the train station? Grimmer seems very perceptive so I think the guy was actually honest about losing his wallet.

EDIT: Also, I'm glad that Anna didn't die there. I freaked out for a moment when the stage collapsed.

So much glorious indeed. And this is just one anime. We still have Anna from Shimoneta and Albedo and Shalltear from Overlord. Might as well add underboob half fiend Fremy from Ryoka and Rory from Gate. ~~And Senjougahara will still remain as the Uncrowned Best Girl Queen.~~

Makes me wonder if the 2016 winner will have legs or just 2 legs.

Ya'll are crazy. None of those girls has anything on the girls from Monmusu.

I'm kinda waiting for dissenting opinions that will be thrown to Monmusu characters in the next poll and the many ways that the fan base will defend them down to the last man. Where will the moral compass of /r/anime swing when that time comes?

Daym... it's going to be an epic shit storm. Based Jordy will be pleased.

Overlord => BattleMaids => Solution 

Based Jordy needs help. I need more Holo... or S2 of NGNL for more Miko... or WHY NO FOXES IN MONSU??????
>> ARTICLE
Coz foxes are overrated? Joke. Monmusu focuses on the least appreciated monster girl species. That's why we don't have Nekos, angels, demons and thos cute little critters as female leads.
>> ARTICLE
Cute yes. Least appreciated? Not sure. Mermaids and centaurs are pretty mainstream. 

And since we're on the topic, maybe I harbor a little resentment because Suu is the only counter to 50 shades of Ranchenee. 
>> ARTICLE
You haven't seen waifu wars until Monmusu. Blood is shed. People are crushed, drowned, strangled, dropped from perilous heights. People tell you your waifu is trash? Bitch please. You can ride your waifu into glorious battle and she will fight be your side. Your waifu can drag your enemies to a watery grave. Your waifu can turn into a kaiju-sized waifu and terrorize Tokyo. These waifus have claws and wings and most of them weigh over 300 pounds. 

And folks, we're not even halfway through the season.

i started regretting them when i saw hentai for the first time. I knew there was no return. I knew it was over.

Nah man, it's one of those where they walk in see what you're watching, and then start watching it with you.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah... That's an accurate way of putting it. Lots of nudes and fetishes towards harpies, lamia, slime, centaurs, spiders, and mermaid. XD
>> ARTICLE
I dunno how I feel about them as fetishes. I mean, it's hot because their top halves are relatively typical sexy anime girl stuff (well, aside from Suu, but the right shape is there still), but the decidedly less human bits don't really seem all that enticing. At least we can assume they have the right sort of parts *down there*, but damn Interspecies regulations are a cockblock.

Hmm, Miia would be pretty interesting as long as my bones and internal organs aren't liable to be crushed into paste. Papi's alright too if you don't get yourself shredded by those talons.

When the Shimoneta clip was posted everyone was crying rape, how is this different?

>> ARTICLE

>> ARTICLE
[](#anko)

On a serious note though, I don't see why people even care... It's animation. It's one of the furthest things from being real. There's shows that are literal massacres or plots that are literally about killing a dozen people but nobody screams murder. Why is a "rape" scene suddenly much more controversial?
>> ARTICLE
No clue, maybe because it is less common in the anime scene since the rise of the moe-blob-cute genre. But I reckon scenes like Shimoneta's are created with 70% fan service and 30% shock value as the ingredients, to just hype it up even more. Lo and behold: they succeeded. 
>> ARTICLE
I've always wondered that myself. Videos of graphic violence involving real people are less controversial than fictional "rape" and "child porn". In general people seem to have their priorities screwed up.

And I'm not saying we should censor violence, nor am I trivializing rape or other sex crimes, I just think that it makes no sense that depictions of sex of any kind are almost always considered worse than depictions of harming and killing people.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's mainly because, in the US at least, sex is a lot more taboo than violence. Any graphic sexual content is censored while violence is often shown to a much greater degree. I'm not saying that it's right I'm just saying that's how we do things in the states. Of course we're talking anime here but it's hard to deny that the US has huge influence on media and the majority of the users here are already used to that mindset.
>> ARTICLE
I think the major reason that rape is seen as inherently worse than murder in media is because you can't rape for good. A hero can kill a villain because he has no other options and must sacrifice one life to save many others. A hero raping a villain isn't going to do anything to stop his/her evil plans. There's no situation in which a hero saying "I had to rape her. I didn't want to, but it was the only way" makes sense. Because a hero can't rape for the greater good the same way they can kill, we never get a depiction of rape as an act of justice the same way that we do for murder. The idea that killing can be just is obviously influenced by real life. War, executions, etc. all reinforce it in societies across the world.

Sweet, so it's up to the point where shit's gotten as real as it gets.  It's like the whole series has been Johan pestering Tenma: "Would you really still save me knowing I'm this much of a monster?" and then leading Tenma to knowledge demonstrating that he's even more of a Monster than previously envisioned ... and then repeating the question again.

So now they're leading to a showdown in this random town.  I hope there are still people around for this discussion by the end next week.
>> ARTICLE
Lunge in that last scene with all these guns was so badass :D *When this job is over, buy me a beer* - why did he have to trip a death flag... But I knew he'd see reason, he's definitely my favourite character now :D

The whole endgame is a classic horror/crime story setting - a town completely cut off from the rest of the world, something straight out of Agatha Chrisite or Stephen King novel. I enjoyed the scenes with Lunge and Grimmer trying to come up with a plan, they make a great impromptu team.

That friendly grandpa is Klaus Poppe? o.O I guess we'll not learn all the details behind his experiment now. It seems it's not that important; they created humans unable to feel love, which was cruel enough, but they didn't create Johan. There was something more about him. I hope for a final clarification scene.

In the next episodes... Well, I might try to guess. The good guys will win, but not without sacrifice. Lunge will die, along with Roberto. Nina and Tenma are going to have their final confrontation with Johan, hopefully revealing some final pieces of the puzzle in the dialogue. Johan will be killed by Tenma, Nina, or by his own hand; each of these outcomes would make for a very different moral of the story. That said, I hope he will commit suicide, preferably something vague and off-screen, like walking into a burning building. He wants to erase himself, after all, and maybe that would be his partial redemption.

If he were to be killed by Tenma or (especially) Nina, it would make for a definitely darker story. If it's going to happen, my bet is on Tenma. He's just capable of doing that; and let's not forget that Nina is going to Ruhenheim without a gun. There are always secondary characters, of course... I can't predict the role that Lunge, Grimmer, Eva, or even Roberto will play in these last chapters, so there's still plenty of room for surprises.

I'm done for today, maybe I'll add some thoughts to the discussion later. Surely enough, the ending looks interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished the final episode....

[](#shock)

You guys are in for a fucking treat, that's all I'm going to say.
>> ARTICLE
So much hype. It feels like the last 65+ episodes were all to setup the grand finale.

**Side note:** This might be beating a dead horse, but Nina's desire to kill herself can be related to the God of Peace book like all the other suicidal characters in Monster. Just like what happened in the story, Johan gave Nina a red hat (a reason) to look in the mirror and see herself as a demon (feeling responsible for Johan becoming evil). To protect the villagers (the people she cared for) from the perceived demon in herself, Nina wanted to shoot herself.

However! She didn't shoot herself just like how the boy Grimmer saved didn't jump off the bridge. Why? Because one of the villagers (Tenma in this case) saved her by showing how much he cared (i.e. the power of LOVE and FRIENDSHIP). 

---

**Episode 68: Following a Trail of Clues**

* It looks like Lunge is much less of a robot now. He complimented a kid on his bike and is thinking of drawing a picture for his grandson! It's like he's more sentimental now.

[**GRIMMER!**](#objection)

* Just when I thought that there wouldn't be enough episodes for him to show up! I wonder if there's something special in that trademark bag he always carries. Is it just extra clothes and picnic items?

* People hear a mysterious gunshot. It might be Johan shooting the underling from the previous episode.

* Grimmer searches for the missing dog. It's also the perfect excuse for him (a stranger in a small town) to scope out the area like any pro spy would. Looks like Lunge got the same idea.

* Kid gets beaten by his alcoholic father. Old hotel manager: "He beat you up pretty good again." WTF, aren't there child safety services or laws that the hotel guy could report to? He's kind of a dick for letting the kid stay with his abusive father like that.

* An old couple wins the lottery. With great money comes great paranoia.

* Lunge vs. Grimmer. Both operate to obtain information in different ways. Lunge uses his authority as a BKA inspector. Grimmer uses his fake smiles and pro social skills.

* DA FUCK!? Random cat cut in two!

* There's a "vampire" house. I think it's Bonaparta's considering all those paintings of the twins. Interesting how this guy is called a vampire just like Schuwald. Is that why Johan had in interest in Schuwald?

* Lunge is working with Grimmer now!? That would be so awesome because they would complement each other sooo well. Lunge's authority paired with Grimmer's sociability would make them an unstoppable detective force.

---

**Episode 69: Heat Massacre for 24 Hours. Add Guns for Flavor. Serves One Town.**

* The old folks talk about some guy's special jam and how he would be pleased to hear their compliments. I'm pretty sure that's a death flag....yup, he's dead.

* Is Johan's apprentice involved in this? 

* The couple finds the dead body, and the husband takes out his gun, pointing it towards his wife. DA FUCK, MAN? One of the first rules of gun safety is to *never* point a gun at anything you have no intention of shooting. Dumbass.

* A town girl met a guy who could whisk her away...Roberto? Roberto has a history of becoming a lover or boyfriend as a ruse (Eva, that one fat hooker Schuwald visited, etc.)

* LORD JESUS! The man in the wheelchair CAN WALK! It's a miracle! Except he's handing out handguns like it's candy. You ungrateful bastard!

* Nina says Johan is trying to recreate the Red Rose Mansion and Kinderheim massacres. But why? I'm guessing this is how Johan wants to carry out his mom's revenge by stealing Klaus Poppe's (aka Bonaparta) name. That is, kill everyone who knows Klaus Poppe personally by name (the townspeople) and wipe away his existence. The same thing that happened to Wolfe and Schuwald who were broken. 

* Looking back at the letter Bonaparta wrote to the mom (Anna), it sort of makes more sense now. Theory: Klaus Poppe gave the mom back her name (i.e. the people who knew her, her life, and her freedom) in exchange for the twins. Whether the deal was made voluntarily or not is still unknown. In any case, it could've caused Nina and Johan to feel unwanted and unloved by their real mother.

* LOL the couple blame each other for their situation. It's the woman's fault for winning the lotto and it's the man's fault for buying the guns. They're both idiots if you asked me. They just have to pack up and leave town, buy a house in a rich gated community, put their money away in a bank. How hard is that? These folks would probably blow all their money away within a few years. Dumbasses.

* Another picture book! This one is easy to interpret though. Obviously the thief represents Klaus Poppe. The art probably isn't as good this time because he doesn't give a shit, being retired and all.

---

**Episode 70: Let the Carnage Games Begin!**

* WOW! Klaus Poppe was the hotel guy all along!? I literally inhaled audibly. Of course they would hide him behind a beard!

* Nina is now headed to where Johan is. It looks like the climax will happen in that little town with all the main cast members (except for Eva, but who knows?). It would be interesting if Nina made herself look like Johan. I'd love to see Johan's reaction to that. Nina meeting Johan dressed as Anna would be cool too (just like old times). Actually, what if they both dressed up as the other? That would be trippy! And it would go along with my previous theory...

* I KNEW IT! It WAS Roberto shacking up with that town girl! She's such a whore hooking up with an old geezer just to get out of town. Or maybe Roberto is just ridiculously smooth with women, putting his assassin skills to work. 

* It looks like Johan is trying to erase all memories of Poppe and himself as I had thought. That whole "stealing names" business that General Wolfe brought up. I understand what Nina meant by Johan's "perfect suicide" now.

* Nina doesn't want her memories of everyone to disappear. This means that she doesn't want to die anymore. 

* It hadn't occurred to me that the story of the Monster Without a Name could apply to Grimmer as well. As a spy, his identity/name keeps changing. He doesn't consume the people around him though.

* The old couple from out of town were manipulated by Johan to give away guns. I can just imagine it: "Oh dear, Johan is just like our dead grandson that we loved so much! Now he wants us to pass out guns so people would kill each other! Why not? He's practically our grandson! It's probably what he would've wanted too. Love conquers all! (Including the lives of innocent people)."

* YES, Grimmer and Lunge picking up guns like badass mofos. Aw man, Grimmer is staying back to protect Poppe and the hotel. Lunge is going in alone and getting all the glory. All that's missing are sunglasses to wear in the rain.

[](#yunocaine)

* Lunge: "Mr. Grimmer, when this job is over, buy me a beer." Hands down, one of the best lines in this show because *Lunge* said that--LUNGE. I'm scared though because they also sound like famous last words (death flag). Fuuuuuuck. Don't you die on me Lunge! That includes Grimmer too! At this point I'm not sure if those two will survive. If Lunge dies, I could imagine him drawing a picture for his grandson in his dying moments :'(

**The end is near! How insane is this going to be? I'm excited.**
>> ARTICLE
> Another picture book! This one is easy to interpret though. Obviously the thief represents Klaus Poppe. The art probably isn't as good this time *because he doesn't give a shit, being retired and all.*

The ridiculous amount of analysis this show makes you do on every last thing Poppe says or does, and now I've just got this picture in my head of him sending his publisher some half-assed sketches because he's got arthritic joints and can't be bothered with a second draft.

The man's got a business to run. Those abused kids need their paychecks so their drunk fathers can steal the money and spend it at his bar.

I just finished this show tonight. I was under the impression anything animated was going to make me cringe more than once, but fortunately it didn't happen. Felt more like a western drama than anything else. It's unusual, but I had a lot of sympathy for Roberto in the end. Interesting backstory when constrated with Grimmer, and the perfect secondary antagonist for someone like Johan.
>> ARTICLE
Haha yeah, Poppe's books made me think *a lot* as you can tell. Connecting the books to everything I knew up to that point was fun in its own way, but I was kind of relieved that the book about the thief was self-explanatory. The story was summarized and skimmed over by the guy who owned the book, and I got the impression that there was no special overarching meaning.  I don't see how it could apply to anyone else besides Poppe.

It's a stark contrast to the other books and a reflection of how Poppe has changed from an evil ruthless researcher to a feeble man knowing that he deserves to be punished--a coward waiting to be caught.

>> ARTICLE
I'll swing around. I'm a little rusty but I definitely would like to talk about the ending. 
>> ARTICLE
For the ending, I suppose I would stick with my old theories. In no particular order:

1. Experimentation on twins to make super humans for world domination. 
2. Johan and Nina are sort of the same person. "You are me, and I am you." Their identities/personalities are interchangeable in some way. Johan can look and act like Nina so why couldn't Nina be acting like Johan?
3. At the end of the *Monster Without a Name* book, Johan eats his twin and they sort of become one...either Johan will try to kill Nina, or Nina will kill Johan...It's possible that Nina ends up taking up name/identity, Johan. I dunno.
4. Roberto dies along with all of Johan's other minions.
5. Tenma will try to save Johan somehow (power of love and friendship?). Brain surgery?
6. Johan has abandonment issues (with his mom and/or sister) that he relives through his victims.
7. Johan became the character, "Johan", from the picture books.
8. Some epic reveal that changes how we see everything that has happened. (Johan and Nina).
9. Grimmer will publish a report on Bonaparta.
10. Lunge will do *something* for his grandson.
11. Dieter plays soccer with orphans.
12. Epilogue montage of ALL the characters and what they're doing after the end.

That's all I can remember off the top of my head.

EDIT: I thought of a couple more.

13. The twins' brains were messed with somehow. Maybe the twins share some of each other's brain through partial brain transplant?
14. **Wild speculation:** Is Eva the mom? It just occurred to me that Eva and the twins' mom are both blonde. I don't think Eva has blue eyes though, but color contacts are a thing. It would explain why Johan didn't kill Eva that one time Eva saw Johan's face at the parking garage. Eva also had a messed up bitchy personality, which I think the mom would have with all that's happened to her.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not participating in the rewatch since I finished the show only 3 months ago, but I just wanted to say that episode 9 is one of my favorites in the series. It's one of those episodes I distinctly remember. I liked that it showed Tenma's resolve and also managed to make me care about the minor characters. It's just a great episode all around.
>> ARTICLE
pretty much a great episode, we got to see Tenma determination and at the same time we see that he haven't really change inside, he's still a good person. [Also dat smile, true forgiveness ](http://i.imgur.com/uNZUBpw.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
First time watching but I really agree that I liked this episode very much!
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, the rewatch still isn't that popular. I had to do a search to find the thread again. Maybe you should post it at the same time you did for the first few rewatch threads. It helps to be on the front page. Although, it's normal for rewatches to lose numbers until something really interesting happens.

**Episode 9:** 

Not much to say. There is a recurring theme of hands in this episode. The girl's hand helping Tenma up, Temna receiving a chick from the girl to put it in its nest, and the trainer holding hands with the girl at the end. Each time, it's slow, gentle, and a little heartwarming--an unsaid message of bonding and helping one another out. This contrasts with Tenma handling a gun. It's fast, mechanical, and procedural. It's almost cold the way Tenma fires the gun without emotion.

**Episode 10:**

So Johan is the type of killer who manipulates others. The message he left for Tenma sounds like crazy excitement--something I wouldn't have expected from a person who always looks calm and collected. 

Tenma's approach towards the terrorists was interesting. He's capable of leaving a man to die if he deems him a monster, but Lawyer's fear of death made him human in Tenma's eyes. Perhaps the fear of death means he's capable of empathy? But then what does that make Tenma if he's not afraid of dying now? I think the doctor's guilt makes him borderline suicidal. Tenma isn't a monster (yet?), but he is losing a bit of his humanity when he doesn't value his own life.

Episode 9 actually managed to move me, as the first one in the series. The moment the girl held the soldier's hand, it wasn't only raining on the screen :P Tenma seems to have a great, positive influence over other people, maybe because he's a doctor. I wonder if this attitude will change later on.

Wow this is awesome coincidently I decided watching Monster a few weeks ago I'm ahead but I thought it was kinda neat that some people are doing a rewatch as I'm watching it!
>> ARTICLE
Wait wait, I just read the manga a couple of weeks back. Are you saying there is an anime adaptation of it? Ohh boy here goes my study time 
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga and thought it was incredible. Is it worth it to watch the anime as well?
>> ARTICLE
Yes. 
>> ARTICLE
One of my all time favorite anime and your right about it blowing Death Note out of the water. When I saw how long it was I had serious doubts about the story being able to keep me interested for that long, man I have never felt better about being wrong. 
>> ARTICLE
Same here. I thought it had started off really slow, and before I knew it, I was hooked. I try recommending it as much as I can. 
>> ARTICLE
Doctor Tenma...

Johan Liebert...

This is actually one of the names I use when I introduce myself to people.

Cool. I'll have to do that soon.

I do it to practice lying. Kinda hard for hitler youth kid to pass off a name like kiritsugu or kotomine. I generally take from movies or books.
>> ARTICLE
I've never seen the anime but I read the manga and it is easily in my top 3 manga right behind berserk so I can imagine the anime being pretty damn awesome if it follow the manga closely.
>> ARTICLE
it follows it almost exactly, I can't recall any scenes which were added in the anime.

>> ARTICLE
hm, guess I'll try it again. seemed like too much of a downer for me go through 74 episodes. I like bad guys to get caught asap, had to stop Death Note as soon as I wanted to see Light ride the lightning straight to hell halfway through the first season.
>> ARTICLE
You're meant to be rooting for the bad guys! Cause they always lose. You know? They are like underdogs. Poor guys..
>> ARTICLE
Depends if one finds the bad guy likable, plus I especially found Light to be detestable--just his smirk sets me off. 

Like the bad guy in Heroes, I hated that guy, so I stopped watching after the first season and I just pretend he died then, just as well since I heard the rest of the show sucked.

>> ARTICLE
that was the amazing part about death note in my opinion, you could root both for Light and L, it just depends on how your view is.
>> ARTICLE
The series is basically *The Fugitive* with horror elements, which is not a bad idea at all.
>> ARTICLE
Monster is an amazing anime, I hope more people would take the time and watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked that people he met and helped along the way would often turn up again rather than being one shot guests of the week.  The story became just as much about saving and protecting Tenma as it was thwarting Johan.  By the end most of the characters, including some of his antagonists, would have thrown themselves in front of a bus for him.

>> ARTICLE
I think Monster is one of the most overrated series ever. The whole story just fell apart when [Anna was actually Johan LOLOLOLOLOL](/spoiler) and when Tenma had multiple changes to shoot Johan he didn't, making the story drag on and demolished the "cat & mouse feel" completely. The story also suffered from way too much branching and completely unbelievable occurances. Branching is good for complex series IF a good conclusion happens, and in Monster the conclusion was half-assed and didn't tie story branches together.
>> ARTICLE
It's funny the when you disagree with the majority and voice the opinion you get downvoted, god forbid you point out the short comings of a series that drags on for 74 episodes when it could have easily fit into 50 or so if they cut even a portion of the recaps from each episode.  
>> ARTICLE
welcome to reddit circlejerk where best bet to amass upvotes is to post Iron Maiden in r/metal over & over again.
>> ARTICLE
TIL I learn that highlighting text reveals spoiler... lol
>> ARTICLE
And besides that, there were many elements that were repeated so many times that they became formulaic.

For example, say there's a standoff between two important characters. One character pulls the trigger, BANG, camera cuts to outside of building. Every damn time!

Then there is the classic "blah blah blah, [insert dramatic pause] *no*, [dramatic pause] blah blah blah" sentence structure that is so distinct that it could work well as one character's signature line, but instead every damn character uses it again and again. 

And the most annoying one of all was the flashbacks. You could count on it being interrupted every single time right before the important thing is revealed. Until the end of the series. Of course, the only time one of these vital flashback is successful is at the climax, of course! 

It's all so much transparent bullshit to build suspense. I don't actually think that Monster was a bad series, but it certainly had its fair share of problems. All the more annoying when a series presents itself as dark and mature...

I watched it a couple of weeks ago and *loved* it. While the story was a little confusing due to Canaan being a sequel-of-sorts to a Wii game, I was able to follow most of it with little trouble.

Plus holy fuck, [that intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFbdJZCBzKw).
>> ARTICLE
and now I REALLY need to watch this.
>> ARTICLE
Then watch it. 

It's really underrated. Hidden Gem in my opinion. That, and I love the interactions between the protagonist and antagonist. The characters for the whole show are very well done. There are little to no "filler" characters. Everyone has a purpose to some degree.

[Have another GIF from the show](http://i.imgur.com/IL5acim.gif)
>> ARTICLE
The show is super underrated and most of my anime friends have never seen it. The first episode had weird pacing so most people don't go beyond it. 
>> ARTICLE
the entire show has weird pacing and story issues.  Sure it looks nice, but that is about all it has.
>> ARTICLE
It's not just that it looks nice.

* You got Sawashiro Miyuki (Kanbaru, Inaba, Sinon etc.) playing Canaan and Sakamoto Maaya (Oshino Shinobu) playing Alphard.
* The [BEST taxi driver ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJsIBJhPIvI).
* ~~Urobuchi wrote the original material for the video game.~~ My bad, I mixed up Canaan with Requiem for the Phantom.
>> ARTICLE
If by Urobuchi you mean Kinoko Nasu (who only wrote the epilogue that the Canaan anime is based on.)

Though the main writer for 428, Yukinori Kitajima, is an award-winning novelist in his own right who went on to write for other masterpieces like all of the Senran Kagura games. I'm not being facetious either; he actually has won multiple awards and he actually did write all the Senran Kagura games.

...And now that I double-check his credits, he was also singlehandedly responsible for the script of the Brynhildr anime, as well as series composition.
>> ARTICLE
He writes the Senran Kagura games? Especially the fan service?
>> ARTICLE
My bad, I mixed up Canaan with Requiem for the Phantom.
>> ARTICLE
The story issue was because it was a sequel to a Wii game. I admit that it kinda detracts from the anime, but all in all it was pretty enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
[Have an Upvote](http://i.imgur.com/nCtcRyW.gif). Just because you have a differing opinion, you shouldn't be downvoted. 

Care to explain what problems you had with the pacing and story?
>> ARTICLE
It has been a while since I've seen it so I can't remember details.  I just remember the story being really terrible.  Some of it just didn't make sense or have any reasoning behind it.
>> ARTICLE
I actually have to agree, I'm in the same boat as you. I finished it and then thought to myself "that did not make any sense at all", I just remember still having a shit ton of questions at the end of the show, which bothers me a lot more than it should.

If you ask me why I don't remember anything, it's probably because there was nothing worth remembering (shit that sounds worse than I wanted it to).
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much.  I haven't seen Code Geass in over 5 years but I still remember a good chunk of it, but if you tell me to remember any specifics of Canaan I'll draw a blank.
>> ARTICLE
I was looking at this comment a few hours ago when it was new and thinking of commenting the exact response you placed. I completely agree, the animation and fight scenes in it were great but a remember having to drag myself through to finish it. Can't remember anything about the story, other then in one of the first few episodes there was a fight scene during a festival.... I think. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I remember having very high hopes for Canaan, but it's plot ended up being thoroughly mediocre.

Just started marathoning Canaan by coincidence. Really enjoying it.
>> ARTICLE
Quick question for those that have watched it. I just recently started jormungand and am loving it. Also loved black lagoon. Both those shows have Canaan as a recommend but everything I see on it, such as this, doesn't really look similar? Am I just seeing the goofy gifs or something? How do they actually compare?
>> ARTICLE
I'll definitely put BL over Canaan, no question.

The thing I liked the most (besides the action and *dialogue*, and Revy's general insanity) in BL is the relationship between Revy and Rock. They're honest with each other even though they're not really the same kinds of people. Plus you actually watched their relationship grow. Additionally, when Rock and Revy fight, they *fight*. In fact, as Rock goes on with the crew, the "fights" get more and more in-your-face as a product of his growth and environment.

Maria and Canaan (in Canaan) try to do the same thing, but it starts out the show already knowing each other and tries to give back story via flashbacks that were short, barely explained anything, and felt really forced. And when there's conflict between the two, it's like the writers are really squeamish about having their MCs not liking each other and end up turning it into some kind of 3rd grade "I don't hate her, but does she hate me?" kind of thing that would've been solved by just talking (the way Rock and Revy do all the time).

On top of that, Canaan's powers feel like they're just some kind of plot device that is used at the whim of the writers with barely any explanation. There is this little touching scene later on (about Canaan not noticing Maria's "color" in the hospital) that was nice but that was about the only time I would've given it a pass.

I'll say though, it was enjoyable enough if you're not looking for anything too much and just want some sick gunfights. (BL still has better ones, of course.)

EDIT: Sorry, haven't seen Jormungand.
>> ARTICLE
[The show definitely has its share of action](http://i.imgur.com/PouGDew.gif)
>> ARTICLE
I've watched all three of those.  All three of them have very nice gun fights and strong(psychopathic) female main characters.  They also have a slightly darker tone to them and feel more "adult" compared to most other anime I have seen.

In all honesty I would recommend all three of them especially if you already enjoyed watching one of those three.  However, I personally wouldn't rate Canaan as high as Black Lagoon or Jormungand as it both shorter and generally more lighthearted.
>> ARTICLE
I would rate Canaan higher than Jormungand but lower than Black Lagoon.
>> ARTICLE
Really?  Maybe it was just because I watched it when I was younger but I found the characters and story of Canaan much flatter in comparison to the other two(although the visuals of Canaan are in their own category)
>> ARTICLE
been meaning to watch this actually 


that's not a main main character, is it?
>> ARTICLE
No a secondary character
>> ARTICLE
She's not wrong
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking of watching this for a while but it had a relatively low rating on MAL, what is it like?
>> ARTICLE
Its a pretty light watch. Nothing complicated plot wise and fairly well paced. Theres no major exposition or symbolism(its there but fairly simple, not overdone or anything). However the action choreography is really well done.

While you dont have anything too similar on your list you do seem to rate action shows fairly high.

Id say give it a try and you will definitely know by 3rd episode.

I hope it comes to fruition at some point, I feel like its the kind of story that the Western audience would eat up so I imagine it would be quite successful.

I think so too.  I just finished a rewatch of it tonight and would absolutely love to see it get a bigger audience.  I think around the time Game of Thrones is finishing it could start up and be HBO's next big show.

It's the only anime series I've seen that rivals FMA:B to me.  What a great ending...

They could just use Tetsuya Kakihara, hell that guy is even born in Dsseldorf. Well I don't know how tall he is tough.

As you said, it has been pretty quite for awhile. I think you know as much as the rest of us sadly.

which i my opinion is a bad sign.  Its not listed on Del Toro IMDB he seems busy enough.  he has a movie coming out in october and is attached to a couple of future projects.

a btw i hope its not faitful to the manga.  the anime is faithful and we already saw it.  i would rather watch an updated version.

Would updating it have the same effect? How would they incorporate the cold war aspect

It's probably a combination of production hell + he's busy with other things. However, very little has been officially released, so this is just speculation of course.

I finally found time to watch episodes 53, 54, 55. I had a busy day yesterday. Time to dig into it [](#glasses-push) for all you lurkers out there [](#thumbs-up)

**Episode 53: Tenma's Breakout (the build up) and Eva's Breakthrough**

* I just realized that the large cast of Monster now includes an expert escape artist (Milch) and an exceptional lawyer (Vardemann). Next to the super assassin, doctor, psychologist, spy, detective, hot girl, and a cross-dressing evil mastermind, this is starting to look like Ocean's Eleven--except everyone is working against each other.

* In Eva's flashbacks, I'm reminded that she was selfish, ungrateful, contemptuous, and just all around bitchy. 

* Whoa! I really like how they're handling Eva's character development. In the past, Tenma's kindness and affection never reached her and she took it for granted. Tenma's picnic for Eva can be seen as a metaphor for this. He made a gesture of affection, but Eva let that affection fly away with the wind and fall into the mud. And all Tenma could do was smile half-heartedly at the dirty sandwiches and say, "What a waste". Now we finally start seeing a change in her when she takes a humble bite from a sandwich she once scorned. I love it because such a simple act speaks volumes. It tells us that Eva is now capable of humbleness, accepting people's kindness, and appreciating the small things in life (i.e. an everyday sandwich on a beautiful day).

* I always knew that Eva would eventually try to help Tenma. She may hate him for dumping her, but she obviously still has strong feelings for him.

**Episode 54: Tenma's (actual) Breakout and Eva's Flight**

* Jesus, Gustav and his fianc! They kept raising death flag after death flag and it just kept going! I was 99% certain that he would get hit by the truck. Let's count the death flags: 1) They're getting married that very day, 2) The wife says she'll stop doing drugs, 3) They're going to have lots of babies, 4) Gustav tells his girl that he loves her, 5) Gustav says he'll stop doing these kinds of jobs after this last one. I'm surprised that he might survive after all though.

* Haha! Wow! I wrote a long time ago that Eva and Lunge were opposites of each other (yin and yang). Now I just realized that even their character developments are the opposite of each other. Eva went from ordering scotch to ordering coffee; Lunge went from ordering coffee to ordering a beer on his vacation. Eva is learning to become more serious and not so overwhelmed by emotions; Lunge is learning to become more relaxed and start having emotions again (i.e. taking a vacation and  enjoying it). They both started out on two opposite extremes of crazy and now they're moving towards the middle to become more sane and well-adjusted. If they both survive by the end of the show, I'll expect to see Lunge holding his grandson and Eva having some closure with Tenma.

* Shiiiiit, I'm afraid Eva might die here because Roberto is a really good assassin. If I had to guess though, I'd say that she'll survive because she JUST started to have some good character development. The person at Eva's door could be *anyone* at this point. Opening the door isn't the smartest thing to do, but if it's Roberto, a locked door wouldn't be able to stop him anyway.

**Episode 55: The Yellow Brick Road to Red Rose Mansion and Vardemann's Breaking Point**

* Now that Tenma is wearing an overcoat and has a scruffy face, he matches the Monster OP. We've come a long way from the  episode 1 clean-cut Dr. Tenma. I also recognized the phone booth from the OP. It's as if destined events are unfolding, and the show is nearing its conclusion. I can't wait to see the details behind that white hand reaching out from the darkness.

* Always good to see Lunge in action again. Am I seeing things or does Lunge have a slight smile now? How long has that been there?

* To discuss Vardemann's story, I'll need to break it up into paragraphs for the sake of readability:


Vardemann's story is interesting. The song "Over the Rainbow" was written for the classic movie, *The Wizard of Oz*, where a young girl get's swept away into a bizarre fantasy world. At the end, she wakes up as if it were all a dream. You could say that Vardemann was living in a fantasy where his dad wasn't a spy. He concocted a delusion for himself and the rest of the world to believe that his dad was innocent using his skills as a lawyer. Throughout the show, we can see his struggle to maintain the lie by telling everyone and himself that his dad was innocent.

I'm not 100% certain, but I think it also explains why he got angry at his wife for playing the song a few episodes ago. On one hand, the song represents Vardemann's father as an owner of a radio station and all the good things he remembers about him; on the other hand, the song also represents his father's betrayal to his country, all the suffering Vardemann had to go through growing up, and the fragile delusion that he tries to maintain. He plays the song in honor of his dad, the *radio station owner*, once in the morning and once at night because that's what his father used to do at the radio station. Playing it at any other time could cause Verdemann's suppressed emotions towards his father, the *spy*, to boil over. 

In the end, he had to wake up from his fantasy world and accept the truth for the sake of helping Tenma stop a monster.

EDIT: All signs point to Red Rose Mansion. It would be the perfect place for the climax/end of Monster because it's most likely the place where it *all* began.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, it's a shame the rewatch is losing interest, although maybe it's not so surprising with a 74-episode show :/ I hope we can make it to the end!

Good episodes, finally something action-filled centered around Tenma. He's definitely changed since the beginning, now that he's able to point a gun at cops and escape from custody. That shows his determination to save other people, and I believe it didn't have to be Eva. I especially liked his cold calculation when he checked the injured bandit - knowing, that there was nothing he could do for him at the moment, he decided to fight for himself.

My predictions for the end? I hope for all the story arcs to be resolved. Perhaps we'll see Mr. Grimmer, I don't really believe it was a final goodbye. I wonder what'll happen to Eva - my prediction is she'll either die (less likely) or go through 'redemption' and witness in favor of Tenma at the end. I also hope that Lunge will realize the real threat here and face Johan, he already stopped pursuing Tenma.

The outcome? Pretty obvious I think, Johan is the bad guy, so he has to die, unless some miracle happens and he is cured of his insanity. I hope that he's going to be killed either by Tenma or (even better) Nina. These two were already close to killing people, they still have to cross that final line, but if they do that, it might add extra depth to the show.

I still can't really speculate on the twins' backstory. It's a mystery, but it has to be revealed soon. As was pointed out in recent thread, the mother of twins should be still alive, so she might yet play a major role. I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Hasn't Nina killed several of Johan's henchmen? Back when Roberto was introduced?
>> ARTICLE
In that ex-detective's mansion? Roberto shot one guy there. Or maybe you're talking about the guys who attacked Nina? It was the detective, then. I'm positive Nina hasn't killed anyone, though she was damn close to killing Johan as a child...
>> ARTICLE
Theory: the rewatch doesn't have much interest because of the timing. I think a significant number of /r/anime redditors are in college or high school, and it's that time of year for final exams. Plus, there's a lot of interesting anime shows going on this spring season. I predict a big jump in interest for the climax and end of the show, because then the people who already watched Monster can jump into the discussion and read first-timer reactions.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I don't understand why people are starting off more rewatchs. They got popular during last season because it was a weaker season, but this season has alot going for it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm following and lurking in this rewatch from day 1 but I don't usually comment on it. So I'm happy that someone is giving his thoughts for each episode and be sure that it's not unnoticed. I know for sure that I'm not the only lurker that reads them...
>> ARTICLE
^ and I seem to be perpetually 2days behind.
>> ARTICLE
Same! I actually decided to watch this starting at the end of March and coincided with the rewatch. There are some episodes where I love to come and read people's reactions to them. I'm excited for the ending!
>> ARTICLE
I missed the discussion question. I'll be brief:

* Johan will die. How? Nina, Tenma (I give him low odds though), suicide, or death penalty.
* Lunge will survive and have a happy ending with family.
* Eva will get closure with Tenma. Dunno if they get back together. She might die helping Tenma--not sure.
* I don't know about Nina. Johan might kill her because it happens in the book, she might die along with Johan because of some twin sibling relationship and self-sacrifice, or she might just live on. It's all up in the air.
* Roberto will die for sure.
* Grimmer will show up again. There's not enough closure for his story.
* Dieter plays soccer with the other orphan kids that Grimmer helped.

There are probably other characters I forgot, but that's the gist of it.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I feel like they've been pushing the regret -> redemption thing for Eva for most of the show. I don't even see Roberto as a character, hes just a face to represent all of Johan's henchmen imo.
>> ARTICLE
I hadn't thought of that. Roberto really isn't much of a character. We know nothing about his past or core motivations. For nearly every other character, we get some insight into why they are the way they are. Maybe there will be a reveal about him later? 
>> ARTICLE
I have to say, there was a **LOT** of dense and interesting material in these episodes--especially episode 56. Those two picture book stories threw me for a loop. I actually got lost with a hundred different thoughts trying to understand the meaning behind everything. Looking over my notes, it'll take me a while to clearly post my thoughts. I'm going to sleep and post what I got later.

I think the show's quality has gone up in these last few episodes. The first half of the Monster was a kind of a drag with all those side stories.
>> ARTICLE
GODDAMMIT, MONSTER! You're making me go crazy, pulling meaning out of everything! Sometimes I can't help it and read into everything. Why do you have to do this to me...**sigh*\* This is going to be the most I ever written on reddit (I'm actually a lurker 97% of the time believe it or not.)

[](#you-bore-me) Let's begin.

**Episode 56: A Shit-Ton of Foreshadowing and Speculation**

* It feels like food and drink is a reoccurring theme. The truck driver told Tenma something along the lines of "you look like you could fall over at any moment" as he offered him a burger. It reminded me of the time that Nina left Tenma a couple of sandwiches and a letter telling him to take care of himself and survive. Once more, Tenma forgets to maintain his own health; I get the feeling that he's becoming more and more self-destructive because each day that Johan lives, more people die. Each life lost weighs down on Tenma's conscience more and more. To quote Cowboy Bebop, *"You're gonna carry that weight."* Right now, that weight is beginning to drown Tenma. I suspect that Tenma will eventually have a breakdown and *all* of the people that he helped will end up saving him from his guilt.

* From Anna's perspective, the mansion is much more creepy. She obviously has PTSD so I expected her to faint or have a panic attack.

* Anna's flashback of dead bodies in that room is telling. It looks like they were all poisoned by the wine, and I assume Johan did it. It fits his MO (poisoned whisky bonbons). Every time Johan used poison, it was to kill some corrupt assholes who were celebrating their evil deeds. Each time, they consume something with alcohol and poison in it. It's ironic because the alcohol is supposed to make them feel even more good, but the poison makes them die a painful death instead.

* The puppets obviously represent Tenma and Johan. It's possibly foreshadowing what will happen. The blue puppet with a blade attacks a "demon", stabbing him over and over until he collapses on top of the demon. This can mean only one thing...Tenma is a top and Johan is a bottom.

[**(They're gay)**](#kukuku)  
 
* Nina has been recovering for three months after fainting!? Her traumatic experience must've been really intense.

* Who is Lipsky, the puppeteer? Why was he *really* in the mansion? Is he one of the survivors from 511 Kinderheim? When Grimmer was being tortured, they said the survivors would be rounded up for Johan to lead I think. After the reveal with Grimmer, I'm suspicious of every new character being one of those survivors.

* Earlier Nina said she would "do the same thing" as the puppet killing the demon. But then she says you can't make him kill the monster. "A human could save that demon." So Nina is having second thoughts about killing her brother? Nina's comment makes me think that someone will try to save Johan from his darkness...and that someone can only be Tenma, Anna, Dieter, and/or some new character we haven't seen yet (a mother's love?).

* Oh boy, it's story time again. This might take a while to figure out how it relates to everything. I'll just pause the show to think about the Big Mouth and Big Eyes.

[](#wtfika)  

* (2 hours of thinking/writing later) OK, I think I get it. Let's finish this episode...FUCK!!! Another story!? You gotta be kidding me...

[](#durr)

* (1 hour later) Screw this, I'm just going to make a separate post about these books and the rest of episode 56.

**Episode 57: The Meaning Behind a Name**

* FINALLY, we get to see what happened with the twins over 10 years ago when Anna shot Johan.

* Johan said a monster came and visited them. Was it Bonaparta!? Come to think of it, he's probably still alive. No one mentioned him being dead. Could it be that the REAL END BOSS to Monster is actually Bonaparta?

* I get the impression that young Johan legitimately cared about his sister when he warned her about a monster coming after her, and told her to shoot him.

* It just occurred to me that Johan's abandonment/betrayal issues might be related to Anna when she ran away from him! So he has issues with his mom and sister maybe.

* Theory: Bonaparta brainwashed the twins such that they can go on a murderous rampage when he provides a certain trigger word or action. Bonaparta's "students" might actually be engineered weapons of mass destruction to wreak havoc in West Germany. Vardemann's father was a spy meeting with Bonaparta after all. Maybe Johan has no control over his actions?

* So Anna and Johan *literally* never had real names to begin with? Perhaps they were born into life as lab rats, and thus have no names?

* Wolfe gave Johan his name! Holy crap! Johan isn't just following what he had learned in those books, he actually *became* Johan from all those books! HOLY SHIT, it's just like what happened in the book! Johan and Anna are literally monsters with *no names* and Johan found that he liked the name, Johan! Wow! I never expected that book to be so literal!

* Ahhhh, so names are proof that you're alive. So in order to take away a person's name and sense of identity, you erase everyone who knew that person. So if I understand correctly, the letter about the twins' mom getting her name back meant that people who knew her were allowed to live and remember her. Johan has been "stealing" General Wolfe and Schuwald's "names" by killing everyone who knew them personally. Just like the monster without a name, Johan "eats" everyone that knew his target before consuming the target himself. Stealing a name means erasing a person's entire existence. What could that mean if Johan is actively erasing his own existence? He kills everyone that knows him, and destroys all physical evidence of his existence. Does it mean he will kill himself in the end? 

* If Johan is meant to be a weapon of warfare, he would be the *ultimate* assassin of mass destruction. Think about it, he *destroys* the livelihoods of **General** Wolfe and Schuwald, who is the **backbone to Europe's economy.** Johan messes them up so hard, they can't even function anymore. And what could be better than a weapon that can erase all evidence of it ever existing? A country wouldn't even *know* a weapon is being used on them because Wolfe and Schuwald's demise would seem natural. Hell, there would be even *less* suspicion if they *don't* die. Just fuck up their lives so they can't do their important jobs anymore.
 
* Dieter quotes Tenma: "If you don't have fond memories, make some! Make some new ones!" Thinking about it, I find myself loving this quote. If I ever find myself in a bad place, or feel miserable, I can just make some new fond memories in the here and now. Fond memories that can bring happiness.

* It's ironic how Mr. Lipsky is a puppeteer when he was likely a puppet for Bonaparta.

* Aww, the Lipsky wants Nina to be happy

* Oh cool! It's Lunge! What? MR. LIPSKY IS BONAPARTA'S SON!?!?

[](#osaka)

I have nothing else to say about that. I can't even guess where they're going with Lipsky.

**Episode 58: I Forgot Eva's in This Show**

* Eva's back to drinking alcohol. I set my expectations too high. I forgot that she's an alcoholic who drinks the most when she's stressed out. Realistically, change takes time and it has its ups and downs.

* I like the bodyguard, Martin Reest, he's cool. I also like how he repeatedly talks about how terrible his job is.

* Eva's trying to replace Tenma by dressing her bodyguard in the same clothes Tenma used to wear. She's hoping that her old lifestyle could make her happy again, but it doesn't. She's different now.

* Who is Eva supposed to meet and what does she have to tell him? Considering the fancy party, he must be someone rich, powerful, or have a high profile. Bonaparta? Schuwald?

* I think this episode had a good rhythm, and it reminded me of *Sin City*.

**The Man with Big Eyes and the Man with the Big Mouth**

The story of Big Mouth and Big Eyes is about how you're damned if you do, and damned if you don't. Either way, the characters end up miserable, regretting their decisions--except  Big Mouth was temporarily happy and had to trade away his garden (I assume that's why it withered. Does it represent his soul?). 

*My* takeaway is that it's pointless to have regrets. It's impossible to know whether you'd be better or worse off if you had taken a different path. It may *seem* obvious that the other choice would have been better, but the possible positives to the other choice could've been temporary or lead to something even worse. That is, falling harder from a greater height, or trading away an important part of who we are now. After all, our choices define us. In the end, we are better off letting go of what could have been...

[](#not-raining)

**However!** This story is actually *dark* and *sinister* because it ends with the characters in despair (that demon is *shady* as *fuck*). Its message is *not* to let go of regret. Its message is that we are all fucked no matter what--that we will always end up hungry, poor, or losing something important--craving for what we don't have and what should have been. (Buddhism teaches that earthly desires only leads to suffering but I won't get into that). 

I think Bonaparta wanted to experiment on his "students" with the help of these books. So really, his message is that you may as well trade with the demon because it is the far better option. That is, trade with the demon and you will never go hungry or be poor--sacrifice your garden for an easier life. In the end, you'll be less miserable than Big Eyes who was still poor and "so hungry, he was about to die." Big Eyes could only watch how awful his world is with painful clarity, and cry large tears of sadness. That, I think, is the intended moral of the story. 

Essentially, I think Bonaparta wanted to make his "students" more pliable to his requests or demands. He is the demon who will "offer" a trade with the promise of "bountiful food". All you have to do, is bend to his will, make some sacrifices, and maybe endure something painful.

With this line of reasoning, Johan is the Big Mouth who traded with Bonaparta and/or a *real* demon within himself. He traded away his humanity so he could do whatever he wanted like make people suffer. Johan appears to be a sadist after all. The big *mouth* allows him to consume more food at once to make himself happy. For Johan, he is gorging on people's death and suffering.

**The God of Peace**

God could be interpreted to be any benevolent person who doesn't see the evil in himself until Johan gives him a little push (giving the red hat). Johan allows people to see themselves as a monster. What does the god do upon seeing the demon inside of him? As the story goes, he wants to protect the villagers from the demon within him. It implies that he must kill himself to protect them. Another interesting thing is that the god gives the villagers *names*. Names are proof of a person's existence and their identity (more on this later).

The ex-alcoholic detective, Richard, saw himself as a monster when he realized that he killed a teenager in cold blood, sober. He couldn't bear the thought of his daughter hating him for what he did, so he gave into alcohol and most likely committed suicide. Richard would be the god who gave Johan his *name*. That is, Richard gave Johan's life meaning and proof that he existed. Johan was the one who had Richard see himself in the mirror as a monster (giving a red hat). And so, god saw no other option than to kill himself to protect his daughter from himself, an unlovable monster.

Johan re-enacts this story with each person that he manipulates into killing themselves. The serial killer who stabbed himself with a pen through the ear, the children playing the falling game, the orphan that Grimmer saved from suicide, and many more. Johan has people look in a mirror to see the hateful monster that is themselves. "You are me. I am you." They become convinced that the world (villagers) would be better off if they died. 

So what about Dr. Tenma? He is the epitome of a benevolent god, saving people's lives. I suspect that Johan will try to make Tenma see himself as a demon. He will drive the guilt into Tenma, pointing out the horrible things he let happen. Tenma wished those doctors were dead, Tenma saved a monster, Tenma is responsible for *all* of the lives Johan took. The final straw could be when Tenma kills Johan. Because he would then have no choice but to admit that he has done evil. Because as Tenma has said before with conviction, all lives are equal.

What was Bonaparta's objective with this story? Perhaps he wanted to teach that there is evil in everyone, even if they do good deeds. Perhaps he wanted to teach that anyone can be made to self-destruct if you know enough about their sins, their shame, and their insecurities.

**Episode 56 ending**

* Johan speaks with the painting of his mom: "She is me, and I am her. You are me and I am you." That's confusing. I assume he's referring to himself, Anna, and his mom. Are they clones of each other or something?

* Young Johan said, "shoot me," to Anna. This ties in with the God of Peace story. In this instance, Johan is taking the place of the god. He *knows* that he's a demon; therefore, he wants to protect people or Anna from himself; he wants to die. But then he says they are one and the same. "Even if I die, you are me and I am you." It could mean that Anna and Johan are two sides of the same coin. Anna is the benevolent god and Johan is the demon in the mirror. (Remember when Anna said she remembers seeing herself come home at the Three Frogs?). So it would only be fitting that Anna kills "herself" by shooting Johan.

Something I like about Monster lately is the use of repetition. It helps to connect different events. Anna and Johan: "I know." The god, Johan, young Johan: "You are me and I am you." Martin: "What a horrible job."
