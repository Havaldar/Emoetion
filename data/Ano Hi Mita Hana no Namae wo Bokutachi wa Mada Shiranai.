I took like a two week break from anime after finishing TTGL.
>> ARTICLE
I had to take a few days to calm down after that one.  I've honestly never found an anime that got me as hype as that one.
>> ARTICLE
Man I loved that show. I always describe it as the only show I know of that has an exponential curve to it's excitement. Every single episode is at least double the previous.
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing about TTGL: It really makes you FEEL it's story. It puts you in the center of a massive and awe-inspiring conflict, and shows you how no true barriers exist by way of breaking through them headfirst again and again.
>> ARTICLE
Everything else just felt so stale and boring compared to it. It took me a while to get back into watching all the shows I wanted to watch because the comparison wasn't even fair.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Now and Then, Here and There after TTGL and it felt so weak in comparison (even emotionally).

I never imagined an anime could be THAT hype..good times

TTGL is essentially hype condensed into art.

Spiral Power is basically hype... power.

Serial Experiments Lain. It basically blew almost everything I'd watched up to that point out of the water.
>> ARTICLE
[Shinsekai Yori](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) it was a very well-written show, yet the ending  had left a very bitter taste(which is not a bad thing in this case). First thing I thought after finishing it was 'I won't enjoy anything in current state so I neeeed a break'. 
>> ARTICLE
That anime was so slow earlier I hated it, but I'm glad I stuck through it. It was so worth it.

SY is definitely one of the most unique anime out there.

It was a goddam rollercoaster. I didn't like the bitterness of it, but I consider any anime that elicits a strong emotion (besides cringe [exception watamote because that's the point {still cant watch that shit}]) to be great. 
>> ARTICLE
That's basically how I feel after recently watching Serial Experiments Lain. I'm not sure how much I actually enjoyed it or how well it was done, but I felt so many things after watching it that I am convinced it must have been great. I'm just unable to rate it as of yet because it still throws me for a bit of a loop.

It was so good I had to take some breaks part of the way through to contemplate shit, probably one of my all time faves.

NGE+EoE, but i guess the depression is half the fun of it.

I watched NGE for the first time this year, and I remember going from Mawaru Penguindrum straight to NGE.

Needless to say, after those two rides I needed a break, some time to collect my thoughts and come to terms with life.

NGE was my first anime (I didn't know what anime was before). Somehow it didn't put me off/break me.

So basically you're saying don't watch Ping Pong until my death bed?
>> ARTICLE
Not anything that came up since, but overall... something tells me that you haven't looked that intensively: you have not watched any other work of Ping Pong's director Masaaki Yuasa. 

DO IT. NOW. He is one of the absolute best in the industry, so go and watch his works. I'd (obviously) recommend The Tatami Galaxy, which rivals Ping Pong as his best work: many think it's even better. It also happens to be my #1 anime.

But you can also try Kaiba and Mind Game, whatever attracts you more. Point is: if you dug Ping Pong as much as you said you did, you owe it to yourself to check out his other work. I really don't think you will regret it.


>> ARTICLE
Second this. Yuasa is pretty much universally phenomenal. Would also throw in Kemonozume which is a lot more inconsistent than his other stuff but is still totally amazing.

I personally enjoyed Ping Pong more than Tatami. Both are **masterpieces** in my opinion but I preferred the humble, grounded slow build and show-don't-tell of Ping-Pong to the aggressive thematic promotion of Tatami. Everyone's got their own experiences though.

I am still unable to enjoy any other anime, besides Parasyte, beyond a superficial degree. The best currently being Shokugeki no Soma and Gangsta. (edit: Charlotte is okay too), but they are both so small scale...

The lack of harmony and depth in art, writing, and directing in most anime is just so much more apparent once I've experienced Hunter X Hunter (2011)...

*Cmon, One Punch Man...*
>> ARTICLE
Tried Tokyo Ghoul?
>> ARTICLE
Seen both the anime and manga.

Tokyo Ghoul started off awesome but has so many problems; the anime's animation is laughably poor and the manga's exposition is dysfunctional and grueling.

The character design and epic climaxes are probably the only things driving sales.
>> ARTICLE
That was the whole point for the TG manga, Kaneki even says it on the first chapter "If I were to write a story with me as the lead character, it would certainly be a tragedy." 


>> ARTICLE
Being a tragedy doesn't mean having dysfunctional exposition.

A good example of the contrary is Attack on Titan, albeit the exposition of that is a tad slow as many have noted in past discussions.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is slow but the characters are really well fleshed out and the whole concept is done extremely well. I don't think character design and epic climaxes are all that is driving sales 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I love the TG manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen Death Parade? I haven't seen the two you mentioned so I can't compare them but I thought Death Parade was pretty great.
>> ARTICLE
Death Parade is an immensely pretentious setup in that it uses religious/spiritual references to justify examining different characters and then throwing them away almost as quickly as they are developed.

If you're not one to look at this analytically, it's a fine episodic serial. For me, it was incredibly slow; the death-match aspect grew stale by episode 4 and I dropped it by episode 6. Edit: And no, the general hype about the remainder of the series did not interest me.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, that was kind of the point, to just give snapshots of each person as an exploration using the tools they set up. I personally think it was done well, and they just didn't have the screen time to do world building, character development, and utilize the narrative 
device they created for themselves.

I really don't think they had a propensity to throw away characters more than HxH, which was one of the things that continually bothered me about that series (usually I just was having too much fun to care).  
>> ARTICLE
Theres so many examples of really well executed direction though...but yeah, most anime will look flat in comparison to HxH
>> ARTICLE
I understand what you mean. I like a lot of anime, but I don't think there will be one I enjoyed as much as HxH. Unless HxH (2028) is announced. 

Fate/Zero came close, but that's like.. 25 episodes.

They are doing overlord atm iirc, it's pretty good(friggin love the clementine VA)

You said iDOLM@TSTER twice.  Was this an honest mistake, or is it so good that it deserves to be said twice?
>> ARTICLE
Not really. What bothers me is that most of the show he mentioned belong to different genre. Not really relevant when comparing like that.
>> ARTICLE
Opinion mate, opinion ...

I still haven't found any anime that could beat Clannad (which also includes After Story) in term of human relationships (father-daughter, brother-sister, husband-wife, family and friends) and the meaning of life. Clannad literally taught me to be a better person, I haven't looked at my surrounding (friends, family) until i watched Clannad.
>> ARTICLE
I mean in terms of family, I don't think there is any anime that is as touching and profound as Clannad, at least nothing that I've seen or heard from. On the bright side though, there are plenty of fantastic anime out there that I would put on par with After Story. It sort of aced its niche, but there is room in many other genres for other "masterpiece" anime, and there are certainly other anime that have made me reevaluate my life...just in different ways than Clannad.

On another note, you have the most beautiful MAL I have ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Clannad, but for someone who has seen both, how does it compare to Summer Wars or The Eccentric Family in terms of family themes?
>> ARTICLE
Summer Wars is a family-movie so I'd say it's quite similar to most of Ghibli movies if you have watched one. But Clannad focuses on stories and life of a couple (specifically it revolves around Tomoya and Nagisa) - rather than a whole big family as oppose to Summer Wars. It depends on what you're looking for, family from the look of individual perspectives or as a whole.

But in terms of better writing, you should try Wolf Children (same creator with Summer Wars) as it touches as deep as Clannad but focuses mostly on mother-children relationship.

Uchouten Kazoku is a very unique one (it's one of my favorite family-theme anime actually) but I mostly enjoyed Uchouten Kazoku for the story it offers, not for the family-relationships wise (UK doesn't have much family interactions, most of the time it's just told by a family member).

My final say is, if you compare them in term of story wise and writings, Clannad is probably the weakest of them but it is the easiest to get into as it offers raw emotions and a wide range of relationships which you can relate to.   
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen either one of those, but Clannad mostly has to do with the loss of family and loved ones. From what I have heard, between the three of them Clannad will likely be the most emotional.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for liking my MAL :P, I spent quite a bit of time to decorate it so yeah.

I agree with your point, there are absolutely many fantastic anime out there (lots of great one I haven't watched). But my point is, Clannad is probably well-rounded in most aspects of human-relationship you can ever find in an anime. It's not the greatest, but it delivers the best in its genre. (although Graves of the fireflies is more depressed, but Clannad has touched the deepest place in my heart)

>but there is room in many other genres for other "masterpiece" anime

This is why I always avoid to compare anime in different genres. It's hard to compare, let's say TTGL and Mushishi ... They're both my favorite, but belong to different genres and how can you even compare them? 
>> ARTICLE
While not my second, I also kind of started my re-introduction to anime (after a 5 year hiatus) with: Angel Beats, Clannad, Steins; Gate and Madoka Magica....

After that all the rest felt very mediocre for a while. (even though those other shows might be very solid, I just started at the top)
>> ARTICLE
First one was AoT cause it was my first anime. Had like a 2 week period where I was doing nothing but looking up AoT related things. 

Second one was Steins; Gate where I obsessed with it for the better part of 2 weeks. 
>> ARTICLE
Had to check to see if anybody had said this yet.  The second part.  Attack on Titan wasn't really that hype to me.  I thought it was pretty good, but definitely not as good as people were making it out to be.

Steins;Gate was the one that made me have to re-evaluate some things.  A bit about myself here; I haven't been able to cry since I was 18.  When I went to my Uncle's funeral in the morning and then immediately had to go to my high school graduation.  Something in my head went out of whack and I just can't cry anymore.

Watching Steins;Gate was just......ugh.  It starts out so innocent.  And by the end, I was the closest to crying I've ever been since that day.  Just....I couldn't handle it.  It was as if there was a waterfall about to come out of my face.  Granted, it didn't, but my point still stands.

I've never had an anime move me like that before.  And don't get me wrong, I've seen quite a few in my time.  I've felt small stirrings of emotion before.  This was full body shaking emotion I felt.  I honestly felt like I couldn't comprehend it.

I stopped talking to people for a week.  Just thinking about it over and over again.  Playing it over in my head.  Hell, thinking about it right now I'm getting emotional.

I was pretty useless for about two weeks after I finished watching it.  I've not felt like that since the end of that show.  I was an emotional wreck.  And I loved every second of it.
>> ARTICLE
This is why I love anime so much, no other medium really takes all possibilities of story-telling and opens them all up to become anything you want. And if you weave each part just the right way they can come together as a blanket and encompass you
>> ARTICLE
> first paragraph 

Omg I'm the exact same, i just watched the op and abridged episode over and over haha
>> ARTICLE
After season 2 of Oregairu, I took a short break. That was the only anime that I watched religiously every single week when it aired.
>> ARTICLE
^ this. I was planning on quitting anime after that. I even looked forward to it more than GoT when both were airing. I remember waiting for that last commie episode. It was like an 8-10 hour delay, I just sat there the whole day pressing F5 on nyaa.
>> ARTICLE
Quitting anime? That seems odd.. Any particular reason why?
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't really too into it like I am now. I didn't watch anime for ten years until last year when I watched Attack on Titan and Psycho-pass and then I followed Tokyo Ghoul and Parasyte, finally watched Steins;Gate, watched a bunch more, Psycho-pass 2, Tokyo ghoul root, durarara x2 etc. and then got into Oregairu. There was no way anything else would make me as excited as I was for Oregairu. And that still rings true. 

Plus I was working 7 days a week for months as a welder on rotating shifts, so it would just be a chore as well to watch other stuff i'm not excited for. But then I lost my job and now im a hikikomori so to kill boredom I watch all the anime..
>> ARTICLE
I suppose I see what you're saying. It's the same with me and video games.
There was a time where I honestly didn't have time or motivation to play video games. Yet, there's always a game (or in this case anime) that will leave you like "Damn. That was one of the best things I've played/seen".
It's the same with movies, too.
There's always bound to be another masterpiece to be released or even already released that I haven't found yet. I guess that's why I enjoy anime so much. You never know when you'll find another Mona Lisa.
Just my two cents.
>> ARTICLE
Little Busters! Refrain was freaking amazing, an absolute 10 in my book, and i just couldn't watch anime for an entire week because they all felt "empty" or something, i don't know how to express it.
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion, changed my entire view on anime and stopped watching anime for almost a month (VERY HARD) and it was summer.
>> ARTICLE
Kill La Kill was so fun to watch. I didnt know what to watch after that.
>> ARTICLE
I took a break after KLK as well. It was so great and so gonzo that I knew anything else was going to be a letdown, like after I binged Gurren Lagann. 
>> ARTICLE
Been nearly 6 months since I marathoned it for the first time. Still hunting for any kind of fix that comes close to the high that was that show. I've settled for the blu ray boxed set in the interim.
>> ARTICLE
This might be a silly recommendation because you've probably seen it, but if you haven't watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann like *right now*. I personally think it beat Kill La Kill in terms of hype.
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree with you about the hype factor but the ending to Gurren was crushing. I mean kill la kill's ending was sad but Gurren's ending left me a sobbing wreck.  Anyone who has not seen it yet should totally watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't actually find Gurren Lagann's ending nearly as sad as everyone else. I mean there is obviously [](/s "Nia's death"), but overall I feel the message was one filled with hope. I was horribly sad that it was over, but the ending itself didn't make me sad. I definitely cried though.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate and Code Geass were flawless and made me stop watching anime for a while.

The entire Evangelion franchise made me go WTF, stand up from my computer and take a long shower to digest what I just saw. Then I devoured every possible analysis I could find and started to countless rewatches. While it didn't stop me from watching any other anime it made me devour everything I could connect to it.
>> ARTICLE
I think table-kun weakened Nina's character a bit, and the fanservice was a bit heavy sometimes. That said though, Code Geass is still the only anime I've watched more than once.
>> ARTICLE
I find it funny that I watched the whole thing in a couple days and didn't notice the Nina scene, then I was like "who the hell is table-kun".

[Hibike! Euphonium.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/27989/Hibike!_Euphonium) Yes, I'm serious.

By the way, What's the difference between White Album, and White Album 2? Should I watch one and not the other?
>> ARTICLE
I love Hibike! so much. So so so much. 
>> ARTICLE
Wa1 is more like a thought experiment on relationships, but are not as well executed despite the more engaging premise.

Wa2 was alot less adventurous, keeping to the tone you'll find in regular jdrama and k drama. However it's a lot better executed.

Personally I like wa1 way more, but that's cause I have years of C/k/J dramas under my belt. Wa2's slow pace annoyed me too.
>> ARTICLE
White Album 2 is not a sequel of White Album. Rather, WA2 is an entirely different story with new characters wherein the only ties to the first White Album is that they used songs from it. I'd recommend WA2 over WA1.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely. It made me wonder whether I should rescale my MAL to what a 10/10 really should be. Lots of anime were demoted that day.
>> ARTICLE
I've always been fairly strict with my MAL ratings, that is, because the average score is 5.5, it therefore makes sense that my average rating should approach this figure. I couldn't bring myself to give it anything less than a 10, which is a position I've not really been in before or since.
>> ARTICLE
Watch White Album 2 it's generally regarded as better and not really attached to the first one.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, thanks. :)
>> ARTICLE
Will i still enjoy it even if I've been spoiled as to the [](/s "-----------cheating----------------?")
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I liked the first one better.
>> ARTICLE
Basically everyone here just recommends the second one since I've only heard the first one wasn't that great and was meh quality
>> ARTICLE
Im watching WA right now. I aways thought the reason people disliked it was due to bad characters and plot development, or something like that. But that is not true at all.. Characters are good, plot is good. 
The problem is.. This is too heavy, you don't get enjoyment from it. Everyone is flawed in this show, they bring all the bad aspects of human relationship. I guess what most people expect is a little drama with romance in it, followed by a happy ending. What they get is a realistic drama, too realistic to be enjoyable, bittersweet from beginning to the end.

Well, for me, and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, it would be [5 Centimeters Per Second](https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter&ved=0CHUQFjAMahUKEwj73aOltNTHAhUhH6YKHZnSAMk&usg=AFQjCNF7aCuYAUuUXbdfI9MIHQ18mBOIhA&sig2=GkL9JnYxys4Pae6lLYsIHg).


[When](/s "Takaki ventures out on the snowy day to Akari, everything seemed to work against him. The snowy weather.  The trains. The wind. It parallels my experience with a best friend of mine - we did everything to keep in contact with each other, but eventually we lost contact as he returned to his home country during primary school (elementary school for the Americans). ")


[Ditto](/s "for the second and last part of the film - I never truly got over the fact that we are both beyond each other's reach. Most of my daily life is actually centred around remembering this best friend of mine, although it did not affect my performance in the latter stages of my education. Watching this film took a lot out of me, and at the conclusion, I was bawling out tears uncontrollably. The harsh reality is this anime just grounded me, and the lifelike visuals also caused much thought about my life in the past.")


I couldn't watch and enjoy anime or any other sort of entertainment for a good two months thereafter. A toast to Makoto Shinkai for this stellar piece of work.

I think most people have experienced something akin to 5cm sometime in their life. It's just so relatable and kicks you in the nuts for being depressed about something basically small like that. Honestly a great movie for improving your life because so many people actually have issues with the themes presented (from distance, to not being able to move on, to not properly expressing yourself and regretting it)

Madoka. I had to stop everything and rethink my whole life for three days after that.
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious what you had to re-think because I'm not sure how the show relates to real life.
>> ARTICLE
haha, it's more of a figure of speech and hyperbole. But I have been watching anime pretty much my whole life, and Madoka was the first one I came across after coming back from a long hiatus, because frankly, I was a little disillusioned at the industry at that point. Madoka blew everything I thought I knew about anime out of the water, and I just had to sit down and process the "holy shit" for a few days.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I think Madoka relates to real life more than most anything else out there. I would even go so far as to say that it's **about** life. [I wrote a piece on it a little while ago if you're curious as to why.](http://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=772691) I understand that not everyone had the same experience with it though, and that's cool.

I nearly broke down three times in the course of that show. I was so emotionally burnt out by the end that when I had dinner with a few friends shortly after finishing it, I physically just couldn't say or do much more than slowly eat.

I feel like Elfen Lied would leave an impact on anyone... like it or not.

Finishing K-On! hit me hard too, and Yui is also my favorite. I was going through a difficult time in my life, and K-On! was there to make me smile despite all the shit I was going through.

Attack on Titan

Steins;Gate

SAO+SAO 2 (Deciding whether I liked it or not was driving me crazy)

Plastic Memories

Kill la Kill

Log Horizon both seasons


It used to be like this for anime in general for me, I ALWAYS marathon, I go into state of immersion where I go blind to whether the show is good or not, I only drop a series when it does something to break that immersion ( [Toaru Majutsu no Index](/s "memory loss") ). Watching episodes from only one series at a time and several in succession, sometimes skipping sleep between two days in order to complete a 20-30 episode series in one go. Two series I did that with would be Steins;Gate and Mirai Nikki. I also completed  Log Horizon in a weekend but I did sleep for an hour and a half between sittings.


Everytime I did this it would render me incapable of thinking about or even process anything but stuff related to the series I recently completed. After a day I would recover while still thinking about it for two more weeks, after those two weeks I would be ready to repeat it with a new series. Recently it has been different though, I completed five different series during the past week, the most ever for me and I am not going insane. Whether or not having the two week cooldown is a good thing will remain to be seen, I still marathon the breaks just seem to have broken...

Link pls. I need to see this for myself.

Search failed me and googling "site:reddit.com date your cousin online" gave me some weird, weird crap dude.  Sorry.

The first season of Psycho Pass almost ruined any anime series I saw after it because of how good it was.

And Wolf Children nearly did the same for me with anime films.
>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter (2011). Like I watched it in a week then I found a part of my soul missing. Took 2 weeks to get into another anime besides the weekly anime I watch.

Death note. Both light and L were very smart.

Magi:The Kingdom of magic I just had to catch up with the manga which is so randomly published

Toradora. I have yet to find a romcom I liked more.

Shokugeki no Soma has raised my anime tolerance so high I'm taking way more anime at one time than I should. Other anime just doesn't effect me like Shokugeki no Soma does, so week after week I'm constantly chasing that dragon, unfortunately the only day I ever catch is on Fridays.

Sora No Woto. I had to take a break because there was no other show I was looking forward to watching an episode of before I left every morning as much as that.

I just slept instead for a week or two.
>> ARTICLE
Samurai Champloo and Bebop I did it the other way round I watched Champloo first then stayed about 5 days without watching anything then went to Bebop and stayed another week without watching more anime, series or movies.
>> ARTICLE
After watching Your lie in April I had to no only stop watching anime for a matter of weeks, I ceased to do anything for that few weeks. The show shattered everything for me.
>> ARTICLE
steins;gate, madoka, and welcome to the NHK, they each made me either take a break from all anime, or just watch them over and over
>> ARTICLE
I should watch Steins;Gate again now that you mention it. 
>> ARTICLE
I take a break after almost every single anime, especially if they're a pain to go through. Once I start an anime it's usually easy to power through the entire thing (unless it's Serial Experiments Lain I hadn't finished in over 10 days - ep8 here). Starting a new anime, however, is the hard part, especially since I'm always so indecisive on what my next anime will be.
>> ARTICLE
I had a burst of anime marathon two years ago that included SAO, Elfen Lied, Kore wa Zombie, Panty&Stocking, and then culminated in everything NGE. I was burnt out after that and didn't watch anything for over a year.
>> ARTICLE
Have one main anime that set the bar too high. FMA: Brotherhood. Can't watch that many anime anymore since they just don't feel as good.
>> ARTICLE
I've never had such an anime. I've been burnt out and had to stop for a while after marathoning entire franchises like I did with Precure and Gundam though.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly those 2 for me too. Just took a break and needed a breather
>> ARTICLE
I just finished fate/zero last week. The end left me feeling very... well I don't know how I should feel about it and its been on my mind quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
The first two parts of JJBA really struck me as masterpieces. I didn't watch a show for a good few weeks letting it sink in. Part 3 didn't click with me as much cause I didn't enjoy stands as much as hamon.

Stands are better. I thought the exact same thing until I finished Part 3. Would have been pretty boring with pure hamon.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

>> ARTICLE
Natsume yuujinchou. It was amazing on so many levels. The soundtrack, the relationship dynamics, the way it told heartwarming/breaking stories in one episodes, character development. Also did I say the soundtrack was awesome. 

Monogatari  - I just never saw a show of this style and thought it was amazing. 


>> ARTICLE
After every monogatari, there's like a one/two month break where I do not watch anything lol. It leaves such an emptiness in me and I am so psyched for October. Not a big fan of the character that is supposedly gonna be the focus but aslong as the rest of the cast make a worthwhile appearance I will be more than happy lol. For a few months atleast 
>> ARTICLE
You don't like Ougi? He/she is a very interesting character and look forward to he/she development. They seem to be more of a antagonist. Althou all I want is more Senjougahara and araragi conversations. 
>> ARTICLE
It is more like I haven't been given enough of the character to really hook me. I'm just a Araragi fanatic and any character he is interacting with I can't get enough of. I love some characters more than others, but ougi is right next to Sengoku pre-Second Season, just don't care/prefer other characters to be on screen lol.
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully the development makes you change your mind in a similar fashion to Nadeko's 

I remember when her arc started in Second season and everyone's like ugh, nadeko arc and after it I am pretty sure most people thought it was damn great
>> ARTICLE
I knew Clannad and Clannad AS would be considered very dramatic from the way the first series was presented. I held from the second series until i knew i could handle it (I did not).

code geass 

was so depressed i finished the story with a amazing ending i stopped watching anime for a couple of weeks 
>> ARTICLE
Toradora! did that to me. The end wasn't sad exactly, but I just couldn't bring myself to watch any anime for like 3-4 days.
>> ARTICLE
K-on! 

Man, the void was real 
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion + EOE.  I watched anime constantly for damn near 2 and a half years before I finally gave NGE a shot.  It was so good that I lost my taste for most of the poorly written anime out there. Also, I knew continuing to watch other anime was pointless considering that everything I could have ever possibly wanted in a show I had just gotten in NGE + EOE.  Since then I have given up on watching anime series in a big way.  Still big into exploring the world of anime MOVIES though... Having said this I am for the first time in a long time realllly excited about some of the new anime series coming out.  WOOT WOOT FOR "ONEPUNCH MAN" AND "DRIFTERS"!!!!

im havent watched anime for about 5 days now after finishing toradora. i have littered my wallpaper files with taiga and ryuuji and it will be a while before i can get over those 2.

Guilty Crown [spoiler](/s "Cant accept that Inori is dead")

I watch so much anime per season that, while I totally get what you mean, I never end up not watching for a while.

However, that happens to me all the time with visual novels. I used to read them non-stop but ever since June of last year when I finished Umineko I have not touched a VN. What's even the point after that.

Ping Pong the Animation raised the bar for story and character development in the anime industry. Ping Pong animation is probably the best anime of all time for me and I have yet to watch another anime that has the same amount depth and breadth of engaging characters that ping pong had. Ping Pong the animation essentially ruined all other anime for me in a sense that ill always be a little disappointed that it didn't satisfy me the way ping pong did.

Shigatsu wa kimi no uso was my first anime that I watched with everyone else, so the effect was big

I have a giant void after finishing Eureka 7. It hit me so hard that I've been re-watching it to somewhat fill the gap. I don't think it took more than a couple days before I started it again and it's helped a ton.
>> ARTICLE
Mawaru penguindrum. It also helps that it lined up with me returning to a pretty intense course load, but that anime blew my mind. 
>> ARTICLE
Katanagatari's ending made me quit for a week or so.  Other than that madoka and Steins gate 
>> ARTICLE
Probably Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. Everything about it was so beautiful.. Especially as the colors faded as the show progressed on. Idk why but that always stuck out to me. The little things.
Plus it was gorgeous.
And.. Well. You all know.

Nothing. Great anime makes me thirst for more. Its the really mediocre stuff that makes my interests drift off for half a season.

Honey & Clover. The void that show left me with will most likely never be beaten. It's a true 10/10 series.

'Your Lie in April' broke me, especially since the main character's just like me. 
>> ARTICLE
I know I'll be flamed for it, but Cross Ange sort of did that for me. I was watching a few things at the same time, but I ended up putting all of them on hold to watch Cross Ange. After being done with Cross Ange, the stuff I was watching (including some really good shows like Maria the Virgin Witch) suddenly felt more dull and less interesting. Even key emotional moments on these shows paled in comparison to simple things in CA like the Rosalie and Chris relationship. While I didn't stop watching anime entirely due to Cross Ange, everything else felt a bit flat comparatively...

And then I started watching Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, and my enjoyment is now back up so everything's good :)

I stopped watching Clannad Afterstory after episode 16. I was so shocked and crushed that I just couldn't go on with another episode. I stopped at 2am and couldn't almost sleep at all the whole night. I was completely exhausted in school and for a couple of days I wondered if I should continue. Then on Friday, after 4 days, I decided to just watch all the way through to the end from episode 17 and I'm fucking glad I did, otherwise I would've probably lived with a hole in my heart for the rest of my life. For others who decide to watch Clannad and Afterstory: DON'T STOP! JUST WATCH IT 'TILL The END! YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE!

Seriously, I usually don't get too worked up about shows but this was something totally different.

Seriously, one of the best show this rich season.

Which other shows aside from this and Iroha do you like this season?
>> ARTICLE
The right is more interesting though. Plus, Poppo wouldn't have traveled the world and gotten with lots of foreign girls in the process if he was going to high school.
>> ARTICLE
Reminds me of the main theme of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, only reversed.


>> ARTICLE
Made my heart sink a little bit. One of the best for this season.
>> ARTICLE
True.

Each episode made me cry.
>> ARTICLE
I think each episode made everyone cry. If not that, tear up at least.
>> ARTICLE
This show is probably my favorite of the season. There's definitely something about this show that tugs at the heart strings. Just thinking about the show made me tear up a little bit. I don't think I've come across a show that has managed to make me at the least tear up before.

For me, it evokes a huge sense of nostalgia, and of wishing I lived my earlier years more fully. I can only imagine what it's like for the 20 somethings watching this show, I'm 17 and it makes me feel regretful and sad about the past. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm 19 and I wish I was 17 again! Please, talk to girls, make friends, and don't let your time go to waste.
>> ARTICLE
I'm already regretting letting time go to waste, just got my yearbook yesterday and seeing everything that has happened over the year has made me release what all I've missed out on. I've done more this year than in others combined, but, there was so much *more* I could have done. Oh well. =\

I guess we're both examples of how you shouldn't waste time. 
>> ARTICLE
The pokemon tie-in hits so close to home for this generation, I was bawwing my eyes out episode two
>> ARTICLE
Is quite a long title, don't you think?
>> ARTICLE
I would've appreciated a translated title, but CrunchyRoll doesn't like to do this too often for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
In case you don't know the title, it's roughly: We still don't know the name of the flower we saw that day.

How Japanese is that?
>> ARTICLE
Incredibly Japanese. I can understand why they'd want to stick with something shorter, viz., Ano Hana, and I suppose coming up with something short from the translation would have been awkward at best.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe "What was that flower?"  but it doesn't carry any of the weight that the actual translation does.  Just that title makes me feel emotions about an anime I haven't even seen!
>> ARTICLE
'Ano Hana' works.

Probably the best series this season. Already preparing for some manly tears by the end.
>> ARTICLE
Is it sad that I am putting off watching this show because I don't want to be sad right now?

Time to go watch the latest episode Nichijou.
>> ARTICLE
i was kind of doing that with this one. but yesterday i was in a really really depressed bender and thought 'what the heck, let's cry some moar' and watched all the episodes in a go. ;____;. hic.  
>> ARTICLE
"We still don't know the name of the flower we saw that day."

That's a pretty long title.

After reading peoples' comments, I'm going to go watch this now. I get nostalgic about when I was young sometimes anyway, so we'll see how this goes. There are only three episodes. [Care to join me?](http://www.animeseason.com/ano-hi-mita-hana-no-namae-o-bokutachi-wa-mada-shiranai-episode-1/)

**edit**: I... I think I got something in my eye. Stupid dust.
>> ARTICLE
Who is the subber for that stream?
>> ARTICLE
Not sure.
>> ARTICLE
New epi tonight I think, so it will become 4.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, at first I said, "It's only three episodes long," but then I realized it's probably just starting the series, so I changed to what's here.
>> ARTICLE
np. and don't ever worry about downvotes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that was a bit petty. I'm just gonna delete that part of the comment. It doesn't matter anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Ah thank you.  The only Japanese words I know are from watching anime so I was reading it as "We didn't know our names the day we saw flowers".

That makes so much more sense.
>> ARTICLE
The thing about Japanese is, you can rearrange the parts of a sentence all over the place (mostly), without losing the meaning, so long as you keep the particles together with the words they're supposed to be with.

For example, the particle "wa" designates the subject of the sentence. *who* is doing whatever we're talking about. It comes after "bokutachi," so we know that the subject is "us."

The particle "no" signifies possession. It's like putting 's on a word. Here, it comes after the word "hana" (flower), so we know that we're talking about "hana no namae" - the flower's name.

The particle "wo" designates the object of the sentence. That's the couple words before it, in this case. It tells you that the main point of the sentence is, we're talking about "the name of the flower."

So far, this is what we have: "We [...] the name of the flower." We're still missing the verb. In Japanese, the verb always comes at the end of the sentence. "Shiranai" is the negative form of "to know." It has a modifier in front - "mada," which means "yet," or "still."

That gives us, "We still don't know the name of the flower."

We still need to deal with "ano hi mita." Technically, this all counts as a modifier for "flower." It's telling which flower we're talking about. "Which flower?" "The one we saw that day." "Ano hi mita hana" is "the flower we saw that day." (mita is the past-tense of 'to see').

Then all you have to do is put it all together and rearrange the words to make sense in an English sentence structure. Who? "Us." What do we do? "still don't know." What don't we know? "The name of the flower." Which flower? "The one we saw that day."

"We still don't know the name of the flower we saw that day."

This lesson in basic Japanese has been brought to you by:

* Boredom

* The time it takes to wait for new things to download

* A bit of alcohol.

* And the number 17

Please tune in next week, when the topic of discussion will be "You want to put **what** in my **where**" and how to get your point across that this is *not* acceptable.
>> ARTICLE
Deliciously interesting, informative, and addresses my structure problems to the letter.

I'm awaiting next week's lecture with baited breath, and not a small quantity of excitement.
>> ARTICLE
You got the words all correct, but without understanding sentence structure, it's difficult to put them together to get the right meaning.

Actually, you did really well for just putting words you knew from anime. I don't think I would have gotten that many, before I started studying seriously.

i'll start anohana and continue hanasaku when my finals are done D: sticking to the happier shows like tiger&bunny, sketdance, azazelsan and gintama for now. i don't wanna anhero just yet orz.

Lots of a really good responses. I just thought of a few other ones that I haven't seen listed yet. 

Edit: Well a few turned into quite a lot as I started remembering more and more. Not all of them are same quality, but I felt like they each fit their respective shows very well and were worth mentioning. I guess I'll put a star next to my favorites. 

Edit2: Is it just me or do sports animes have really bland soundtracks...? I've seen just about every major sports anime, but wasn't able to find too much stuff worth mentioning. 

Edit3: Hint: I really like Kara no Kyoukai. Highly recommended.

So right about Gundam 00. Never skipped it. Hell, I went back and rewatched it from time to time.

I think it's an underrated piece for sure. I've been watching anime for many years, and it's definitely still up there among my favorite ED's. Once the beat starts, I just can't stop listening. 

The other ones below it that I added it took me a bit of browsing through my anime history to find. But I knew I had to include this one for sure.

Aria because they play scenes through it... As for a real answer, I almost never watch EDs because I usually have no reason to stick around unlike OPs. As for OPs, Hyouka's and Magic Kaito's OP2 both stick out for me.
>> ARTICLE
You're missing out! What I usually do is listen to both the OP and ED the very first episode, and again when the OP or ED changes. Sometimes, I'll enjoy it but still just listen to it just that once. Sometimes, I'll take it slow and listen to it every time because it's just that good and fits so well. My finger will be hovering over the next episode button, but I can't click it. If the ED is well done, what the series will usually do is start the ED before the ending of the episode for transition.

[Durarara OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqQgJxA76Bc) - just about the coolest thing ever.

[Witchcraft Works ED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R_PUoTMww0) - funny and goofy.

[Black Lagoon OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9GfkiZPnm8) - if this OP doesn't make you want to watch this amazing anime, I don't want to talk to you.

[Black Lagoon ED](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xENXIVGUDU) - complete opposite musically from the OP, but so necessary after seeing what happens in many of the episodes. Really captures the spirit of the show.  edit: fixed link!

I usually skip the OPs and EDs, not because they're bad but because I want to immediately watch the next episode.

Hunter x Hunter's OP, despite being the same song for 140-ish episodes, it just had this charm to it. Other than that, I'd say the Greed Island and Chimera Ant arc ED's.

The [Ping Pong: The Animation OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZrm7e6Ly14)

OH YEEEEAAH!

And also [Utena OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRnm-769QLE). Wasn't a fan of it in the beginning but it did grow onto me. 

My favorite ending is from [LOGH season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwTn5CKubN8).
>> ARTICLE
None.  I watch intros when I start the anime, and EDs when I finish.  Within the series, I skip.  As much as I've seen some that I like, I cannot stand that kind of repetition, and it seems like a waste of time for me.  One notable exception is the EDs to InuxBoku S.S., which were different each time.  I feel like if the OPs and EDs actually changed (like Game of Thrones' opening does) I'd watch them.
>> ARTICLE
A lot good ones in this thread. 

An older one, I always find [Texhnolyze's ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh1hoNwFfg8) to be completely perfect. [And the 2nd ED manages to be even better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKNv8QKLJeE).
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely loved everything about [Nichijou's 1st ending] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKiph4Pren4) 
>> ARTICLE
A bit older, but I watched the full [ED2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Ehi_b09UA) - (Boku Wa Koko ni Iru) of Kaleido Star every single fucking time it came on.

It was chill, upbeat, hopeful, and in my opinion fit the theme of the series in the best way possible.

I also just like watching Sora rollerblade, ever since the first episode where the animators did some epic shit with her.

Quiet of a series on here as it is, I'm really fond of Tonari no Seki-kun: The Master of Killing Time's [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JDULCok9Fw) and [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pboAwymoStc) 
>> ARTICLE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5lUhHGudEw - The ED for Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni was one of my favorite parts of season one. The music is melancholic and enchanting and the artwork..! Simply beautiful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ-pG5BUGnQ - The OP for Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is one of my all-time favorite OPs, the song and the animation and artwork are fantastic (and they more than make up for the series uncomfortable amount of fanservice).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjjTMNDZi-A - One cannot go wrong with the Death Parade OP.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXmCfikDUvw - I...just really, really like the ED for Sailor Moon Crystal. It's very...I guess, you could say it just feels very nostalgic.

Why do people still stop at 1080p?

This is the world of 4k!

Even 1080p images look low res on my PHONE.
>> ARTICLE
Because size reasons. 4k is ~4 times the size of 1080p. Downloading 1400+ images in 4k resolution would most likely blowout all of my internet allowance, and my internet isn't fast either so it would take several days to download. Heck, most of the anime I watch is in 720p, one for internet reasons and two because honestly there isn't a huge difference between 720p and 1080p,  it is more than clear enough to see what is going on in each scene.
>> ARTICLE
For video, yeah.

For wallpapers? That's ridiculous.

Also, internet allowance? that's a thing?
>> ARTICLE
By 'internet allowance' I meant data cap, which is very much a thing in a lot of countries (I'm in India, for example).

Something I forgot to mention about your first comment. 1080p cannot possibly look low resolution on your phone, in comparison to 4k. Unless you are scrolling dozens of times without looking at the whole picture it will not be in 4k resolution. Even on my laptop, which is 1080p, without zooming out I see 4 different images and if I zoom out it would look no different from the 1080p version as my screen can't magically increase in resolution or size.
>> ARTICLE
No, I mean when applied.

My phone is **1920x1080** in horizontal.

In vertical is **1080x1920**.

Phones are generally used in vertical orientation.

this means the image needs to be stretched nearly 2x to fill the screen. Making the image need to be either made for phones (cutting out it's application as a desktop wallpaper), or be **3413x1920**.

 That just makes it odd, so let's round it to up to 4k at **4096x2160**.

And that really sucks about data allowances. I used 2gb a day on my phone alone.
>> ARTICLE
That blue arrow looks super crisp to me.
>> ARTICLE
I will say this does illustrate the recency bias people have. Statistically speaking, what are the odds that the last two seasons have produced 3 of the Top 10? Even when you consider that most people don't watch anime older than 10 years old, unless it's a classic (NGE, Bebop, Utena, GitS, original Gundam for example) this does seem pretty skewed. 

In my experience, it might be because people have a tendency to rate airing anime against each other, rather than against their whole list. I know I've had to adjust scores after considering my own tendency to do this. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call 00 "original Gundam".  While it's definitely no G Reco or Iron Blooded Orphans, it's not as old as Zeta or anything that age.  Most of the alternate era series have a similar feel to em, like 00, Seed, and current stuff, than the original Universal Century stuff does. 
>> ARTICLE
On the contrary, I'd argue that it's because the popularity of anime makes it so that recent shows get bigger budgets.  The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

There's also the matter that recent shows are likely to be more in line with the tastes of a modern viewer.

These, and various other reasons, are why recent shows tend to get better reviews than older ones.
>> ARTICLE
>The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

The voice acting and music are as good as they've always been, or at least since late 80s. As for the art, I think that in 2005-2008 the studios have mastered digital production and can produce steady high quality animation unless they rush things or cut the budget.

>> ARTICLE
Good points, though I'd argue that English dubs are still improving and have still got a long way to go compared to Japanese VAs.

OSTs have been getting better though - if only because the budgets are bigger.
>> ARTICLE
I think the recency bias has more to it than people just snubbing older series though

1) Older series are just harder to come by on the streaming services. Even if they are on there, you have to really dig through all the recent series to get there. Streaming services tend to push their Simulcasts to justify their licensing expenses

2) Anime crowd skews young. People watch anime of their age before earlier ones. I watched anime from 1995-1999. It wasn't until 2011 that I caught up to things from the 80s and 70s (though I did watch Mazinger-Z and Voltes V in the 90s). 

3) People who HAVE seen those might have moved on to something else in their life, and thus are never really around to mention it enough in today's anime communities, because while they were good, there just wasn't *enough* about them to talk about for 10-20 years. *Pivotal* series like NGE and Cowboy Bebop have been talked about and dissected for so long, particularly in the West, they're just ingrained in the community's collective memory. 

Other series just don't have the same staying power, unless they're a genre defining series. 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu? Meanwhile, how many people will still be talking about Madoka, K-On, Monogatari, and JoJo? Now think about how many Shirobakos, Syokugekis, and Shigatsus there have been in the 20 years since 1995, and have since been forgotten. That contributes *immensely* to recency bias. 
>> ARTICLE
> 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu?

Not sure about Syokugeki, but the other two yes absolutely. Shigatsu will at least have the staying power of Anohana (5 years) or Angel Beats! (6 years).

I need to reply to this because I read your comment and decided to watch a couple episodes earlier today. And by today, I mean a little past midnight. I watched a few episodes... Then a few more... And now it's almost noon and I haven't slept because I binge watched the entire thing. My eyes are bloodshot. Thank you.
>> ARTICLE
Or possibly because people have rubbish rating scales and don't actually care about the numbers they slap on.
>> ARTICLE
But of course you, with your omnipotent, perfectly refined taste, would never do such a thing. /s 

Elitism much? 
>> ARTICLE
No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale. I've seen /u/JexInfinite 's opinion parroted many times in this subreddit, no idea where you're getting the "elitism" claim from.
>> ARTICLE
> No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale.

Its not just people. The entire rating industry had moved toward a 6/7-10 rating scale. 6 these days means terrible, 7 average, 8 good, 9 great, 10 fantastic.

Its just normal. You looking at almost all game or movie ratings, they conform to the warped rating scale. Its just how it is. I think it ultimately came from the academic grading system, where a 50% is a fail, so anything under 5/10 is meaningless.

There is really no point complaining about people using the most common system of rating. 
>> ARTICLE
I vote on a binary "Did I enjoy it or not?" scale.  either an anime gets a 10 or a 1.  
>> ARTICLE
Those people typically are the people less experienced in anime tend to gravitate heavily towards the popular or new shows and slap high numbers on everything because they haven't seen much else and it's all unique and new

This is probably seen in practice by me personally with Gundam 00 vs. Code Geass. Both very similar in quality and plot from the same age, from the same studio. I enjoyed Gundam a lot more but they're two shows in practice which I would see having almost the same score if they were equally popular

But most of the people who've seen 10 shows and given 10 to all of them have seen Code Geass due to popularity and being recommended everywhere. Most of these haven't watched or heard much of Gundam so it has a far fairer score
>> ARTICLE
I've heard of gundam all my life, but it was only after I came to /r/anime that I first heard of Code Geass - so if anything, I'd argue that the bias would go the other way.

Still, as you say, I honestly still don't see what's so good about Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
And this is why I don't rate my list at all :\
>> ARTICLE
I don't rate my list either for the most part, but some notable shows I'll put a 9 or 10 for reference
>> ARTICLE
[Maybe they don't know they can vote less than 5 yet.](http://www.animemaru.com/myanimelist-scores-dramatically-decrease-as-users-realize-they-can-give-scores-lower-than-5/)
>> ARTICLE
I think that's more a result of people not watching anime they know are going to be trash. If something doesn't warrant even a 5 from the people who've already watched it, it's hardly going to garner much viewership from everyone else.
>> ARTICLE
I rate everything I watch a 10, so I'm part of the problem.
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of snobby edgelords on this sub who think you're a scrub if you have an average score over 6. Pay them no mind. If you like something, score it whatever the hell you want. 

Just keep in mind how good you think it is compared to ALL the shows you've seen, not just the recent ones. 
>> ARTICLE
Average score means nothing if you don't know what shows they rate. Some people only watch good shows. You're suggesting that scores be on a bell curve, but I deny this. If a show is good, it is good. The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.
>> ARTICLE
I rate on a bell curve, but the curve is centred around 7.5. Most shows on my list is rated 7 or 8. I simply try to avoid shows if before watching I feel that there's no chance for me to rate the show 8. Life is too short to watch mediocre anime (or read mediocre books, or watch mediocre movies, or play mediocre games), so I don't even bother.
>> ARTICLE
My MAL graph just coincidentally happens to be somewhat resembling of a bell curve, but I would never intentionally adjust the score to fit with everything else. I look at each individual show/movie as its own thing when rating.
>> ARTICLE
> The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.

This is why I kept my "10" rating for Attack on Titan even after seeing much better shows. I just love it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it does, the point of 10 point systems is for it to be relative to other entries 
>> ARTICLE
> Some people only watch good shows.

Yeah, this is sort of the justification I give for rating 10 across the board. I pick what I watch very carefully so that I know I'll enjoy whatever I invest my time in.
>> ARTICLE
So, you've either seen up to 15 shows, or are really generous with scores.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I'm just easy to please. Then again, I've seen no more then 60 shows so I haven't consumed anywhere near as much as material as the average MAL user.
>> ARTICLE
yes, this. Plus from what I've seen from over 20 years of watching, anime *has* gotten better. It'd be dumb to normalize your score to the "average" anime when that average keeps going up every year. 

Instead, I normalize mine to the status quo of being bored. If an anime entertains me even a little bit, it gets a 6. If it makes me feel like I wasted my time, it gets 4 or below. I rarely finish shows that are 5 or below. 

PLUS, people by and large operate based off of recommendations. Essentially normalizing to the average *of what you've seen* is just grading how accurate people's recommendations were to you, which is counter to the spirit of ratings. 

Grading on a bell curve will make sense *only* if you select your anime to watch randomly.
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is a fantastic show because of how it did something completely new. It created several character archetypes which didn't previously exist. Just because those archetypes are now overused and everywhere, it doesn't diminish the value of how they originally affected the industry.

Akira is another example of something that was ahead of its time, but isn't necessary up to today's standard of quality. (I would argue that it absolutely is, but that's beside the point.)
>> ARTICLE
Technically, NGE didn't create archetypes, it just morphed them slightly and made tsundere/kuudere (Asuka vs Rei) more popular. 
>> ARTICLE
Less popular shows get less views, which means less ratings, which means less popularity. It's a loop.

Then there are people like me who just don't have time to watch terrible shows and just stick with what're regarded as "good" shows. What happens then is that my ratings get inflated because I don't watch enough bad shows.
>> ARTICLE
Same, don't even have enough time to watch all of the good stuff let alone the not so good ones. I got a lot of 8 and 9s.

I think people confuse "hype" with "overly memed". Just because people mention it a lot doesn't mean it's "hyped".

I feel like people made this same mistake with OPM. Manga-readers hyped it up. Anime-only kids talked about the art and the jokes a lot.

Much more than Erased for sure (I enjoyed it, but it's ranking is way inflated right now). Also get on that!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this is why MAL makes me sad. You have Gundam 00 but no 08th MS team nor war in the pocket nor unicorn!? 

And only about 6 or 7 shows before 2000 on the list. To be fair older shows do tend to be longer, however there are plenty of shows before 2000 below 26 episodes that arebetter than the likes of gate and no game no life (which is inexplicably at no. 22).

Also the fact that Gunbuster isn't on the list is really sad, that show has probably the best ending of all time (I cry every time the colour hits in!)

Well atleast ping pong, tatami galaxy, and rainbow are high up.
>> ARTICLE
I could think of a bunch of anime that if they came out in the last year would be much higher on this list. Outlaw star, The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, and GTO arn't even on here. Explain that. 08th ms team and pocket are two anime classics probably best in the entire Gundam universe. Im sure im leaving a bunch of quality anime from the 90s and 80s that are 10x better than some of the shows on this list.

>> ARTICLE
Jesus! Those three aren't on the list? I just assumed they were when I scanned it! See this is why I don't trust people...

GTO is 43 episodes and currently ranked 28th on MAL.

yeah I was mistaken on that, I edited it out and replaced it. Such a good anime thought it was much shorter than that.

*stares at every Animebracket contest from /r/anime where Gundam keeps getting snubbed again and again*
>> ARTICLE
Unicorn is rated way higher than 00 and 08th MS Team is pretty close, they just aren't on this list due to OP's weird-ass criteria. They both fit easily into less than 2 cours, he probably just doesn't know exactly how entries of UC Gundam relate to each other and considers it a continuous story, so he only included AUs when making this.

Gundam 00 needs to be removed from this list as it has 2 seasons of 2 cours each.

I still don't get how there's such a gap between Gurren Lagann and KLK on MAL....

KLK only has boobs

Gurrenn Lagann has boobs AND giant robots.

Also I have to feel that an adolescent male protagonist is more relatable to the target audience of both series than a snarky female. 
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill has a *lot* of boobs, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's also part of the Gainax bias...though I agree Gurren Lagann was better crafted & planned out story-wise, Kill La Kill was more enjoyable and the ending=far less a base-breaker with the fans.
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of relative quality, you can't deny that Gurren Lagann is much more approachable to a wide audience than KLK. I feel like that has to be part of it. I also feel that Gurren Lagann was just plain better, for action, themes, and characters. (This isn't an insult to Kill La Kill. I *love* Kill La Kill)
>> ARTICLE
No Outlaw star, Gundam 08th MS team, Gundam war in the pocket,  The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, Gurren Lagann, and Gunbuster all missing from this list. It is funny how skewed toward recency MAL ratings are. 
>> ARTICLE
1) Recent anime are more easily available from streaming services

2) Anime crowd tends to skew young. A lot of people who watched anime, don't anymore

3) hardly anyone mentions those series anymore

There are not many people who would have seen those things you list, and if they have, they probably won't be on MAL now.

People aren't just thumbing their nose at older anime. It's more likely people just don't know about it
>> ARTICLE
Yea I know they arent thumbing there nose, but it is such a shame since there are so many good anime from not that long ago. Movies dont seem to have these issues though on IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes(for the reasons you listed I guess).
>> ARTICLE
well, it's a lot easier to obtain old movies legally than it is to obtain old anime too. Older anime are basically a niche within a niche at this point, and a lot of their distribution rights are held by IP trolls. A better comparison is non-American movies (or movies whose market was never intended to be the American public), and there is absolutely a parallel recency bias there.

I loved konosuba lol The comedy in that show was some of the best I've seen, although I havn't seen that many comedy shows. I honestly found it way more enjoyable than One Punch in my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Both of them are parody shows with stupid yet funny comedy. But I think opm was better overall. Better story, better comedy and better characters. The only good character that came out of konosuba was Kazuma imo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its different for everyone. I just thought the gags/silliness was a lot funnier in konosuba 
>> ARTICLE
OPM has top notch fight scenes with amazing fight direction, an awesome soundtrack, interesting characters, some shounen subversion elements, and most of the comedy was on point. It has almost everything you could want from a light-hearted action series. That's all some people want in a show, so to them it's perfect.
>> ARTICLE
New "twist" on the regular superhero story, cool and likable side characters, competent pacing, interesting setting, great animation & art, good soundtrack, and many people found the comedy to be pretty funny.

It was also a show that I'd say got better as it went along. It started out kinda cool but got more interesting with the Hero Association, got more intense with the Sea King arc, and the Boros fight was the best part of the show and a great finale. I can see why a majority of people would enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty enjoyable myself. I just don't see why people give it a 10/10 when the show barely had any story. My friend gave OPM a 10/10 yet FMA Brotherhood an 8... I just don't understand how its a master piece with such a high rating  lol
>> ARTICLE
Seems you're focusing on a pointless rating system.
>> ARTICLE
Well its not really that, its just people calling it a masterpiece like its the greatest thing is what I don't understand. It was good but nothing that made me say damn that was so amazing greatest thing I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
That's precisely my point. You're focused on a show rated at a 10 being objectively better than an 8, which really couldn't be further from the truth. The entire rating system is a shitshow precisely because people reduce extremely subjective shows to an extremely objective method of comparing them, and completely ignore what makes them unique.

As far as this specific example, I can see why someone would enjoy OPM so much. Its short, sweet, and just a lot of fun. No fat on the story. good visuals. most importantly, its fun, light entertainment. Its not one of my favourite shows, but I can see why someone enjoys it so much.
>> ARTICLE
FMA is quite a bit different than OPM. It's quite a bit more serious (at most points) and can certainly take on a darker tone in some parts. It's also not trying to be subversive. It's a straight up shounen that takes itself more serious than most and with a much more focused narrative. For some people this makes FMA better, for others it's not as much what they're looking for.
>> ARTICLE
Ratings are subjective and a lot of people just enjoyed the show. I don't think there really needs to be much more than that. IMO not having a big in-depth story isn't an issue if it is still one of the most enjoyable shows I've watched. At the end of the day it just comes down to how people rate things and the easiest way to rate something is by how much you enjoyed watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Rating on enjoyment is so much more subjective than rating the actual show (eg characters, plot, themes, soundtrack, animation).
>> ARTICLE
Obviously, but every rating is going to be subjective anyways. In addition you could have the most well written characters and the best objective quality story in existence, but people may not enjoy it. Personally I find just as much value in a review based purely on how much someone enjoyed something as a review that is trying to be objective. At the end of the day I don't care how good something is if I don't enjoy it, and I don't care how bad something is if I do enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I find reviews based on enjoyment to be utterly useless. I can never experience that enjoyment the same way, if at all. What I *can* experience is the characters, plot, soundtrack, etc. Rating and reviewing based on things that are actually in the show rather than how a show made you feel is a lot more logical, and produces scores that have meaning.
>> ARTICLE
But like I said even those things are subjective. Where I see a good character another may see an insufferable twat. Everyone has differing tastes in music, so a soundtrack may be good but still may not be anything you would enjoy. I would think rating the plot would be the easiest to do "objectively", but even then it is usually going to be based on prior experience. When you've watched/read hundreds of shows/books it will be a lot harder to find an original plot that stands out, but for someone without much experience an average or mediocre plot may be amazing.

IMO no review by some random person online is very helpful regardless of the criteria used. A review only becomes truly helpful once you've begun to understand the context the reviewer is looking at the work through. If you have totally different opinions on what constitutes a good character, or anything else, then a reviewer saying that a character is great means nothing to you. Until I understand a reviewer I take their reviews with a huge grain of salt.
>> ARTICLE
Subjective, obviously, but other people are able to witness and experience them. *Nobody* else can experience how the show made you feel, so it's a useless point.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody can tell me for certain how I'm going to feel, but a ton of people can make accurate predictions based on how they felt. If a lot of people think something is sad/funny/enjoyable then I will most likely have the same experience. The whole basis of an averaged score on a site like MAL is that most people will fall in line with the average. If something is rated a 7, regardless of the reasons but as long as those people were as honest as possible, the majority of people will like it but not love it. Maybe you have some particular tastes, but then you can just find a reviewer with tastes more similar to your own. Like on Steam there are curators or, I imagine, the clubs on MAL.

To get back to the original topic of OPM being highly rated, I don't think most people care about an in-depth story. Most people can find plenty of enjoyment in a lacking product, and OPM is executed extremely well in all other aspects. In addition it isn't like it has a bad story - it simply has very little story which I see no problem with. I mean it works for Dark Souls right?
>> ARTICLE
Does your friend rate on personal enjoyment?
>> ARTICLE
Quite clearly, he would. If OPM is higher, it could only be because he enjoyed it more.
>> ARTICLE
When I asked him he just said FMA was "alright" lol
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like it wasn't for him.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm well I think you have to look at it differently. One Punch Man is trying to accomplish different things than FMA. How well does each accomplish what they set out to do? Personally I think OPM does a better job even if FMA has a more ambitious story. More story doesn't automatically make something superior. There are many other aspects to consider. 
>> ARTICLE
The amount of story it had was perfect for the atmosphere the show was trying to create. Not every show has to have super in-depth character backgrounds to be a masterpiece. Dragging out the story would've slowed down the show too much to keep it interesting imo.

At the end of the day it was a really fun show with great music, visuals, comedic timing, and amazing fight scenes. What more do you need?
>> ARTICLE
There was no goal from what I remember with the show? It was just this monster showed up, he goes to fight it. Again I still enjoyed the show I just feel like its way over hyped imo 
>> ARTICLE
IMO part of what makes the show interesting is that the villains are the ones trying to achieve some goal (and get all the power up sequences and other tropey things) instead of Saitama. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably because of the hype. I really like OPM, but I don't think it was a masterpiece as a lot of people claim, the anime was really good and had nice animation, but the best part of the story is still in the webcomics in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind
>> ARTICLE
It's almost like people can have their own opinions and whatnot.
>> ARTICLE
While I can't say I'd give OPM anything above 9 I can easily see why FMA:B would get 8. It's somewhat too long for the story it's telling and has its share of shonen tropes. They're not bad per se, but it's not the masterpiece of deep writing as well.
>> ARTICLE
For me random comedy scenes killed FMA and also Brotherhood . OPM was solid and honestly fun story not the best but worth watching .

Also I think that about  half of shows on this list are overhyped but my it's just my opinion . Maybe it's becouse I like SoL , Drama and Fantasy stories more
>> ARTICLE
eh, the random comedy scenes brought FMA down to earth for me. It's just that FMA had less of those than FMA:B because of the shorter run...
>> ARTICLE

A show doesn't need to have a story if it's not necessary. In OPM having a continuous narrative wasn't necessary since it was a gag comedy.
>> ARTICLE
that would all good if it was actually funny.  Unfortunately it was all too happy making the same joke over and over.
>> ARTICLE
OPM didn't literally have only one single joke. Yes it had the overlying "one punch" gag but it was used in many different ways, sometimes as a joke and sometimes for a serious moment. Overall the show also had a variety of comedy moments that didn't center around Saitama's gag.
>> ARTICLE
ok, list some examples of other kind of gags.  Maybe I'm missing something, but almost all the gags are just people/villains looking down on the MC, who beats the villain effortlessly.  
>> ARTICLE
[OPM spoilers](/s "In the episode where Saitama and Genos were infiltrating the evil doctors lair, he set traps on every floor in preparation for their arrival. Instead of following the standard "clear the dungeon to the boss" trope Genos just instantly blows up the entire building and they enter the basement from there. This was funny because the viewer wouldn't expect this and it subverts the trope.")

[OPM spoilers](/s "After the "robotic monkey" is defeated he is acting like a hardened badass minion and gives the whole "you'll never defeat X" speech. Once he learns that they were actually defeated he drops the robotic voice and takes on a whole different persona asking to be spared. He says that the robotic voice and attitude was him just trying to sound cool. This is funny because it was unexpected at the time and surprises the viewer.")

I could keep going and pull out every single one liner from every single episode that either got a chuckle or an outloud laugh from me but I think you see the point. Every episode didn't have 20 minutes of nothing happening until one single joke about a single punch was pulled at the end. The episodes were lined with small to larger jokes derived from the characters speeches, interactions among each other, and actions in the world they were in which all worked together and created the overall comedic tone/atmosphere of the show.
>> ARTICLE
that's just another variation of the same "Saitama is too powerful" gag, the other being an example of "villains acting all arrogant until they are put in their place by Saitama, who is too powerful" gag
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling you don't really want to be proven wrong. 

Look at his first example, how does that fall under the "single gag" at all? Second example, doesn't fall under the "single gag" either.

These examples are pretty far from the "saitama too strong" gag, so unless you are unfamiliar with the references, its likely pretty clear to most that this isn't a single gag show
>> ARTICLE
And as a variation they're different, they're unique with the characters interacting in different ways which isn't boring or uninteresting for the viewer.

Genos constantly getting turned to modern art, the weird backstories for each villain, the strange character designs for each villain (I mean fucking look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/JJzfkFL.png) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/5qG4z0B.jpg)), [or even just the absurdity of certain situations in the show.](http://gfycat.com/PoshHelpfulIberianbarbel)

On the whole, the comedic situations he's placed in make [Saitama a](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/3wwk6k/anime_irl/?) [very](http://i.imgur.com/8GtTdCl.jpg) [relatable character](https://i.imgur.com/ixk3nTm.jpg) with the added bonus of just being hilarious in general. This is why I can't quite understand why people say the show only has the One Punch gag, it's a comedy with a varied arsenal of jokes to tell, yet for some reason people just say "LEL ONE GAG MAN".
>> ARTICLE
> monologuing

That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.  

>lackadaisical attitude

If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too.  What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.


> modern art

don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

> LEL ONE GAG MAN

personally, I would go with One Punchline Man
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why I tried to give examples, you're actively trying to not have fun with the anime, and that's why the comedy doesn't work with you.

>That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.

Not with most other characters in any fictional media. Most would listen to the long backstory without saying a word, so no, I wouldn't quite say it's a "natural reaction".

>If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too. What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.

Again, the point is that this is abnormal for a main character of a show. Does Superman act like that? No. To give a currently airing show as an example, does All-Mighty act like that? No. These are the characters Saitama is parodying because they're so common, and his character type as MC is so uncommon. See, this is what I mean by the fact that you're actively fighting against this anime tooth and nail in order to not have fun with it. Everyone else sees Saitama as unique and funny, yet you're sitting over here trying to jump through mental hoops to see him as this normal character that is totally obvious to write as the MC of a superhero show.

"Oh my god, they killed Kenny!" ~ Line from a TV show that made millions laugh all around the world.

You don't even bother acknowledging anything else I mentioned, so what was the point in responding?
>> ARTICLE
tbh, the fact that it was nothing but a gag comedy for the first 5 episodes made me question where the hype is coming from. I mean yeah, it was hilarious, but it was the anime equivalent of Chocolate Mint flavor ice cream: you don't get it too often, it's pretty good, but ultimately nothing to be excited about.

The last 7 episodes though, made me think "oh, this was what manga readers were hyping it up for"

Still though, I have to think a fair bit of that was casual anime-only people just parroting the manga hype.

Seconded. I personally think that OPM stands out from the current arc being covered by the manga 'til the end of that arc in the webcomic.

I don't think most people claim it as a masterpiece, it was just a really fun show with a good "hype" factor.

Maybe not in anime communities, but people who don't watch much anime tend to overhype it a lot (look at its IMDB rating).

it's because it's the "not anime anime". People who saw DBZ and thought it was dumb come to this and say "OH MY GOD, IT'S SO AMAZING".

For me it was hard to convince myself to watch it, but when I did, I loved it.  It was a pretty weird experience, that's never happened to me before, but I would definitely recommend watching it.

But what about the culture aspect of the show? Because i dont know jack about the stage comedy storytelling aspect of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Mmm honestly it doesn't really matter. All the stories are self contained, so if there is additional backstory to it, it's not really necessary.  The important parts of the show are generally not the actual performances, and that's where the gold is. The stories are good, but the characters make it great.

>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.

They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.

Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!

KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.

>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.

KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.

In this case it wasn't.

Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.

I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.

I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol

tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.

Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.

Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.

Good luck and may the feels be with you.

You merely adopted the feels. I was born in it, molded by it. I didnt see moe until I was already a man; by then, it was nothing to me but adorable! The tears betray you, because they belong to me.

I was also planning to binge watch Your Lie in April!

Maybe rewatch Grave of the Fireflies for fun, read some Berserk then rewatch plastic neesan to end on a more cheerful note

Probably either finishing Phantom: Requiem For The Phantom, or playing Fate: Hollow Ataraxia since I finally managed to DL it with the help of some nice dude on /r/FateStayNight

JoJo's or a ton of hentai. Can't go wrong either way.

Classic Togashi.
>> ARTICLE
I can't upvote this enough.
>> ARTICLE
Serious question: HxH ? Why? 
>> ARTICLE
Awesome cast of characters, A vast world to explore, great villains and the best character development imo.
The anime ended in a good place where if togashi writes more manga it could open endless possiblities for the show,
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched it and are questioning it? Or have you not watched it?
>> ARTICLE
I have not watch it and was looking for an opinion about it.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because HxH on 2014 had the best year-run of episodes anime has ever seen, with the ending of the anime and especially the ending of the Chimera Ant Arc, best arc in anime history hands down.
>> ARTICLE
If you are in anyway remotely interested or not put off by action/adventures with strategic battles and high episodes counts, I'd say give it a go. In fact I'd say give it a go anyway. 

Hunter x Hunter is a show that starts off good and only gets better with every episode. It's has amazing characters (in particular its villains) that carry an incredible story. There's an over arching plot line but really its "the little detours" our protagonists go on that makes HxH really special. 

I won't tell you what it's actually about because I think it's one of those shows best experienced embarking on the journey from episode one knowing nothing at all. Just a tip though, the second arc (Yorknew city arc) will make you mind up to whether the show is for you or not so if you dont like that arc, there's probably no point watching the next hundred episodes. 

Hope that helped and you decide to watch it. It's not highly acclaimed and AotY contender for nothing.


>> ARTICLE
Thank you. As I am right now picking a new series to watch the ones that have caught my eyes were Legend of the Galactic Heroes or HxH.

Both are lengthy so I didn't want to comit to a large series if it wasn't good at all.

Thanks for the opinion bhvgcf!
>> ARTICLE
would you meteor?
>> ARTICLE
You're welcome :) HxH is one of shows you just gotta share

edit: grammar yo
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching the show a few days ago. I'd say, at the very least watch through the Greed Island arc.  That was probably my 2nd favorite arc.  The Hunter Exam arc was my favorite.  But Greed Island finally starts to give you a taste of Gon's power.  It also has the best ED: "Reason".

The Chimera Ant arc is very, very different from the rest of the show, in my opinion, and dragged on for way too long. It ended extremely well though.

Overall, the show is great, the soundtrack is very good, and there are many cool characters.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. This is pretty much the exact opposite opinion of most fans. The Chimera Ant and Yorkshin arcs are overwhelmingly the most popular, and Greed Island and the Hunter Exam are generally the least popular.

If you really liked the Hunter Exam that much you might be interested in checking out the 1999 version of the show. While everything else may be up for debate, I think most would agree that arc was definitely better in the original.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Greed Island was by far the worst arc for me
>> ARTICLE
That's really interesting to me.

I really don't get why Yorknew is so beloved. I'd rank the Arena arc above that one. The Phantom Troupe had some interesting characters, but they were underutilized.  It revolved around Kurapika mostly, and Kurapika was honestly a pretty boring character to me, despite being voiced by my favorite seiyuu.

The way the Chimera Ant arc wrapped up was fantastic and really surprising to me...but it really changed the tone of the show for me, and it just wasn't fun for me for the first 20 or so episodes of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
YES! Everyone I've met loves the Yorknew arc, and while I wouldnt put it above Heavens Arena, it wasn't very fun. The only interesting parts were the auctions and the [Ep. 50-ish](/s "Kurapika vs. Uvogin fight.") Everything else was mediocre, but maybe that was because I had read up till the very beginning of Greed Island in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, 2011 Hisoka is the best thing to grace anime, without him what's the point?
>> ARTICLE
Greed Island was amazing. Currently on episode 114 (the narration-heavy episodes). So far the Chimera Ant Arc is my favorite. Initially I was put off by it's length and told myself that since it took up almost half the show, it better be pretty damn good. So far I haven't been disappointed. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude get off reddit. If you're on episode 114.. You must continue immediately.

Btw chimera ant arc is my favourite arc but I didnt really start to love it until the final 20 episodes, so if you love it already you're in for a wild ride mate.
>> ARTICLE
The assault was one of the most intense load of episodes I've ever seen.

"Only 30 seconds had passed" but we saw like 5 episodes, it was beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
Everything I knew about good pacing prior to those episodes screamed "this shouldn't work" but the intensity and just all round amazingness that was taking place made me not care. Especially 116 onwards. Incredible.

I gave a quick scroll on the other comments, although I did not watch  Ping Pong yet, I feel confident enough to give my vote to Hunter X Hunter (2011), this revitalisation and also continuation really bought one of my favorite manga and anime series from my childhood back to life. Hisoka is still a creep perv though.
Honorable mention to Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season, one of the few "Sports" anime that is actually great, a step above Prince of Tennis in my opinion. Not sure if sports or battle anime though, the guys from KnB and PoT could easily be in a fighting genre anime with their powers.

1. Hunter x Hunter
2. Parasyte

1) Parasyte 
2) Hunter X Hunter

5) Kill la Kill 

Still haven't seen the second half of Wixoss, the first half of Fate, or the terror anime but I feel like those 5 are probably gonna stay in my top list. On my personal list I wouldn't put on Parasyte since it still airing this doesn't count and would add silver spoon instead, but since this subreddit has such terrible taste nobody added on silver spoon. 
>> ARTICLE
You can add Silver Spoon yourself. 
>> ARTICLE
This is such a hard choice, but I have to go with No Game No Life. It is probably in my top 5 anime (yes, I do have shit taste). My other picks would be F/SN UBW, KLK, and Akame ga Kill. Hunter x Hunter is also fantastic. 
>> ARTICLE
Nagi no Asukara anyone? One of the best shows I've watched for sure and definitely my AOTY.

Yes please! My top anime by far.

Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu all the fucking way.

Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) will win.

Wow, didn't even notice it wasn't in. It definitely should be here 

Edit: [](#mandom)
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! I would personally argue it's my favourite of the year, next to Nozaki-kun and WIXOSS.
>> ARTICLE
My top three are probably Barakamon, Ping Pong and Witch Craft Works. WIXOSS was unexpectedly good too, and Nozaki-kun was hilarious 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Ping Pong, but Witch Craft Works was a fun show as well. But I can't say it was among my favourites. It did have, by far, the best ED of 2014.
>> ARTICLE
You should try Ping Pong out. Especially if you've tried Yuasa's other works like The Tatami Galaxy and Mind Game. 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is overrated, it was good but not that good.. that is my humble opinion at the very least.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, it has extremely well written characters, but almost everything else about the show is rather unremarkable. Or distracting like the art style and animation. The characters carry it to an 8.5  *at best* imho. Aoty for me is Parasyte; HxH had some great parts, but it also had terrible parts(overall probably close to an 8.5 as well). I cant even think of something to complain about Parasyte off the top of my head.
>> ARTICLE
If I were to complain about Parasyte it'd be something along the lines of the side characters being very one-dimensional and undeveloped, but all in all I agree, AOTY 2014.
>> ARTICLE
It's all up to the person if they like it or not, I've heard it's high on Character Development, which is what I want in anime.
>> ARTICLE
It did have impressive character development and the story was good but not even close to as good as people want to make it seem but it's pretty lackluster in the remaining areas, honestly I believe it to be the most overhyped series of 2014... not to say it's bad because it's definitely not.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone has their own tastes :) if everyone's tastes were the same it'd be boring.

Keep in mind that many people haven't seen Ping Pong, so it would still be understandable even if No Game No Life beat out Ping Pong.

They should have something to compensate for the dependency on having seen it.  It would be interesting if we could see votes and rankings for anime *after* controlling for what anime people had seen in addition to it.  My guess is that more people would pick No Game No Life over Ping Pong, but that if you *controlled for people who had seen both* it would be a lot closer.  That's just one of the demerits of these polls.

2014 felt pretty lackluster for me at least, very few anime above an 8/10.  

That being said Ping Pong and Mushishi were easily the best, if I had to pick a third it would probably be WIXOSS, I just loved the shit out of that series even with all the things wrong with it (more so in the second season). Parasyte deserves a vote from me too but I have a thing against voting for/putting shows in a top list when they aren't complete.

Although I do love HxH, I think other shows like Ping Pong, Haikyu, and Fate were the standouts this year. Personally I think Ping Pong is #1 because of how unique and well done it was. A truly incredible show following the best character development I have ever seen in 11 episodes.

I feel bad voting on this because there were so many shows that I didn't vote for simply because I haven't seen them yet.

There's a big difference between not voting for a show because I haven't seen it and not voting for one because it wasn't good enough, and this poll doesn't capture that.

That said, I fucking loved Kill La Kill and it looks like it might win, so yay.

Does that mean that *only* the HxH episodes from 2014 is what we are voting on as well? If that is the case perhaps you should mention it in the post, because it definitely solidifies my vote for Parasyte over it.

Yes. I just figured it would be common sense, wouldn't it? This is a poll for 2014.
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah i guess that does make sense, but few people on reddit(including myself) use their common sense lol. Anyways, I have a feeling most people would still vote for HxH based on their feelings of the anime *as a whole* instead of just the 2014 episodes even if you did edit the op for clarity.

While Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun was pretty good, I don't think it deserves to be top show of the year (as it currently is ranked). For me the only two choices were Mushi-shi and Your Lie in April.

>> ARTICLE
At the time of this comment, No Game No Life is just about taking the lead.


I will seethe quietly in rage if it manages to win.

Yeah, but what I mean is that you shouldn't base it off of anything that happened in 2013 or earlier. Example: Naruto Shippuuden episodes 1-270 ish or wherever they started in 2014 don't count. Just the episodes from 2014 :)

Bakemonogatari. I know it is a very popular series and everyone has watched it. However it came out in 2009 and I dunno when you all watched it but it has been 4 years since it first aired. Also I want to watch it again before [Zenmonogatari](http://i.imgur.com/BSFQ6N9.jpg) begins airing this summer so I don't mind if it ends up being Watch #3 or #4 aslong as it is before the summer season.
>> ARTICLE
I think if this one gets chosen we'll plan on watching Nisemonogatari and Nekomonogatari as well. My tentative schedule would be: 1st Hitagi Crab + Mayoi Snail, 2nd Suruga Monkey + Nadeko Snake, 3rd Tsubasa Cat, 4th first part of Karen Bee, 5th end of Karen Bee, 6th Tsukihi Phoenix, 7th Tsubasa Family. It'd hover between 4-5 episodes for each and would only take 3.5 weeks.

Not chronological? :(

Why chronological if even the novels are achronological?

I don't understand why you'd want chronological. It makes much less sense to start, and ruins surprises. Neko was written with the assumption you already know the characters so if you don't it's not helpful. And you no longer appreciate the foreshadowing in Bake nearly as much.

Chihayafuru

Is this a joke? Chihayafuru is soo recent and the second season is still airing.
>> ARTICLE
>You may nominate any single, complete TV anime you want

Chihayafuru's first season (the one we would watch) aired Fall 2011 and is complete. While more recent than many suggestions here, five seasons ago isn't exactly "so recent."

Chihayafuru's premise can seem daunting at first, as karuta is an extremely niche hobby and the idea of a sports anime focused on it might turn away many viewers. The Anime Club watching the show would give a reason for many to watch something that they might not have otherwise and discover that karuta doesn't make the show any less accessible.

It's a *very* loosely related spin off, the only connection is that the MC is related to the MC in the original Tenchi Muyo series. This show itself is quite highly rated and it's really fun to watch.

I'm reading the manga and I think I'm getting near the part where the anime starts (volume 5?) It's really unique and comfortable.

>> ARTICLE
Same here, I had put off watching it for so long, but I was happy to have seen it. While many call it a deconstruction of the magical girl genre, for me it was more a deconstruction of the fairy tale genre.
>> ARTICLE
I'll upvote because I'll probably only watch it if it gets selected and your image really piques my interest.
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it will be selected, these nomination posts are pretty indicative of the final selection, and this is pretty low.  It's entirely your discretion to check it out, but I'll tell you this much, the characters are really what make this anime.  Each main character is complex, engaging, and most importantly, dynamic.  The story is unique, and the premise is a breath of fresh air compared the anime I've watched so far.

This image in particular was popular enough to kick off an image macro [(What I watched/what I expected/what I got)](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/what-i-watched-what-i-expected-what-i-got) and actually gave the show the unofficial nickname, "Guitar Ninjas", so a lot of viewers really did like it.  If you like character/story-driven shows, and can overlook the initially girly factor, it's worth it.  If not, this probably isn't one you'll enjoy.

Look, not every anime can be an emotional and intellectual dissection of gender identity and sexuality, and that's a good thing. After a more serious character-driven narrative like Spice and Wolf, I thought it might be nice to watch an ironic and unique comedy that might otherwise not get much attention. You are taking my suggestion much too personally, as in the end, it is merely a suggestion, and will count for nothing if people do not decide to vote for it. By showing such hostility towards a simple suggestion, all you're doing is proving your doubt in your show's chances of being picked. Not everyone has to be willing to consistently engage themselves in intellectually stimulating topics, but that fact doesn't make them a lower form of life.
>> ARTICLE
I don't care if Hurou Musuko doesn't get selected. I just opened my backlog and picked something that might generate good content for the club.

What I'm concerned about is that we could end up working with a show that would kill the quality of the comments along with the objective of the club.

>an ironic and unique comedy that might otherwise not get much attention.  

Nichijou not getting enough attention? You can't be serious. 

How about comedies that are actually under-watched like Level E? MariaHolic? or Baka Test? even JoJo was somewhat niche and not as popular as the latest KyoAni moe anime.

>that fact doesn't make them a lower form of life.

It wasn't my intention to hurt anyone's self-esteem.
>> ARTICLE
>It wasn't my intention to hurt anyone's self-esteem.

Sorry, just explaining how your wording made you sound like an elitist.

As for under watched comedies, Nichijou is under watched compared to other shows, not necessarily to others in it's genre. Then again, low viewer counts on comedies tend to be indicative of an issue with the level of quality. It is also certainly  not the latest KyoAni, or even the latest KyoAni comedy, that honor goes to Tamako Market.

The quality of the comments, however, shouldn't even be up for preliminary debate. I always find that the best way to kindle discussion is to start one. For example, Hurou Musuko could be opened up by [homophobic seal](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSyZ75giqOlLK7leroL6EEpfbNmgGNm8bx-0WcVFGtbc41ZHTAIjA), but that doesn't mean someone couldn't create a real discussion. A discussion's quality will always be up to the people participating, and on the internet especially, satisfaction is never guaranteed.

>While at school, Taniyama Mai and her friends like to exchange ghost stories. Apparently, there is an abandoned school building on their campus that is the center of many ghost stories. During the story, they are interrupted by a mysterious male figure. The person turns out to be Shibuya Kazuya, a 17 year old who is president of the Shibuya Psychic Research Company. He was called by the principal to investigate the stories surrounding the abandoned school building.

>The next day, on the way to school, Mai passes the school building in question. While examining a strange camera she spotted inside, she gets surprised by Kazuya's assistant. Unknowingly interfering with the investigation, Mai breaks the camera and Kazuya's assistant gets injured.

>Kazuya forcefully hires Mai in order to pay for the camera and replace his injured assistant. From that point on, Mai begins to learn about the paranormal world and the profession of ghost hunting.

I love how the the top ten illustrates everything you need to know about anime. There's a semi-educational Engrish sketch show, a show about two rabbits in a Soviet prison, an epic space opera, a show about giant robots that fucks with your head, a show about magical school girls that fucks with your head, and a high school romcom featuring ghosts, gods, titties and wordplay. 

Anime gives you everything you need to laugh, to cry and to curl up in a little ball and wonder just what it is we're all doing here in the first place.

And to top it off you get thirty minutes of a guy getting his little sister off with a toothbrush.

Nah, the Best Anime Ever is way below the top 10.  The anime world needs to get over its emo streak.

Appreciate the help in advance. Again, sorry if I'm just being stupid, but I'm just interested in this information is all. I want to try to understand it the best I can.
>> ARTICLE
Average BD/DVD per volume sold domestically in Japan, which is where everything matters. Also it's based on Oricon data which isn't 100% accurate, and then it's based on the volume releases which means it doesn't account for boxset releases afterwards. But it's fair to say that every title on the list can be considered a massive success to some degree.
>> ARTICLE
List doesn't factor in merchandise, which imo is a metric we should def look at as well.

Like the gundam series. They prob make more money in merchandises than from the anime

We look at disk sales because it's the only dataset readily available to the public.

The first episode does a great job world building. The characters are tropish, but cute.

If not seeing much practice in K-On, an anime about music that doesn't involve playing much music, bothered you- be prepared to be irked that they take the easy way out, and never show them learning or getting better.

There is next to zero character development, which is unforunate. They could have really slowed down the pace of the show to make it more interesting from the main character's perspective. 

The show starts with a massive amount of annoying exposition. This could lead you to turn off the show.

The battle scenes are quite good both in design and execution. 

Definitely a short turn-your-brain-off and have fun anime. Maybe just put it on a backlist, for when you're bored?
>> ARTICLE
No, don't listen to this guy.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for having an opinion.
>> ARTICLE
It's an earnest underdog sports story of cute girls driving/commanding historical tanks in an inter-school tournament. It has an absurd setting but plays it totally straight, tankery really is a popular all-girls sport and you just have to accept that. The rest of the show is either friends hanging out together, planning for tank battles, or the genuinely exciting tank battles themselves. If you're into World of Tanks or historical tanks, it's an absolute must, but even if you're not (like me) it's still absolutely endearing.

Oh, and it doesn't have pandering fanservice, which is a pleasant change. Yes, the character designs are quite "mo", but you won't catch a single glimpse up any skirts nor any breast-size jokes. About the only scenes a westerner would consider questionable involve communal bathing, and there's like... two of such scenes in the entire show, which are both literally and metaphorically clean unless you find bare shoulders and backs *too lewd*.

Honestly, give the first two episodes a spin and see what you think.
>> ARTICLE
i do think you see miho's butt in one of the bathing scenes but taken in context it's definitely not pandering.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds alright, guess I'll give it a try soon.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, and it has some amazing "camera" work throughout.
>> ARTICLE
it's fucking great.  it takes the utterly ridiculous premise of "tankwando" as a feminine art and runs all the way to the finish line with it.  the main character is a "thinker" - she bucks tradition and comes up with her own way of doing things (like lelouch or light) in order to succeed.  on top of that, there are **32** characters in the main cast and every one of them is uinique.

it's 12 episodes and 2 recap episodes (5.5 you can skip, 10.5 you should watch), and every time the girls have a tank fight, there's a good reason to get invested.  there are some side stories but they aren't made the focus; rather they're used to bring the characters themselves into focus.  it's really a mastefully done, triumphant, jubilant and heartwarming series.  and it's short enough to marathon in a day if you really can't pace yourself (like me).  go watch it.
>> ARTICLE
>tankwando

Tank-fu, Tankery, and ***[PANZERFAHREN](http://commiesubs.com/your-face-when-we-won-da-panzer-vor/)*** are acceptable substitutes. Tankery is my go-to one for talking about the show, but when it comes to actually watching Madchen und Panzer, only glorious Commie subs are accepted.

i got tankwando from the deadfish sub of OVA 2...  i watched the show with horriblesubs.  aren't horriblesubs/commie both just ripped crunchyroll?
>> ARTICLE
Horrible's crunchy. Commie does half crunchy half other stuff - and in the case of Girls und Panzer, they put their own fantastic spin on it. To not ruin the surprise for anyone else: [Commie GuP](/s "is unique because it uses gratuitous German to replace common phrases - 'Arigatou' (thank you) is subbed as 'Danke', 'Hai!' (yes) with 'Ja!' or 'Jawohl' etc. - it forces a strange trilingualism, the ability to hear Japanese, read German, and understand in English. Since it's pretty much only used for set phrases anyone who's been watching anime for a year or more could recognize, and the German translations should be similarly familiar to anyone with even a cursory knowledge, it's not inconvenient, and often humorous.")

>there are 32 characters in the main cast

That worries me a bit, doesn't a lot of characters mean that each individual character loses a lot of depth?

Apart from that the show definitely sounds interesting, I'll be sure to give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
Some of the tank crews get grouped to the point that you could class them as "one character". This includes the First Years and the Disciplinary Committee - if you watch closely you'll notice they each have their unique points, but in terms of narrative, they're basically 'herded' together and work together to have an individual's worth of impact. It's appropriate, given the collaborative nature of operating a tank.
>> ARTICLE
you'll actually be very surprised.  

actually, i don't think the words are good enough to describe the cast heirarchy.  there's one girl who is obviously the "main character", and there are the girls in her tank who all get backstoried, and then there are the rest of the girls on the tankery team who are all unique and well-characterized but don't get much time spent on their backstories.  they're all "main cast".  

then there's the MC's tank team's families, and the team's opponents, who i would say make up the supporting cast.

Its more of a sports anime to be quite honest. There is your typical underdog team and other sports tropes. Except the sport in this anime is tank paintball. And the tanks are so very detailed and lots of historical Easter eggs thrown in.

Yell yeah, Evangelion and Monogatari!  So SAO lost by 120? I don't know if that is major. Guess I'll go finish GuP.
>> ARTICLE
Golden Eggs still number one. I don't think anything will ever touch those numbers. Absolutely hilarious series.
>> ARTICLE
I would buy Girls under Panzer to add to my collection, but I'd have to get it through Sentai and they removed the Pravda song since they couldn't get the copyright. Honestly that's what initially got me to watch that show in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention that the dub is [really, really bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izf5HxGRdEA)
>> ARTICLE
Even though it's licensed by them, they sell it hybrid so it'll have the subs anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Commenting to find later. Thanks btw
>> ARTICLE
Lol just buy it. Support the industry 'n' such. Or import the original.
>> ARTICLE
GuP is probably one of the only series I would considering importing other than an immaculate adaptation of the Muv Luv Trilogy. 
>> ARTICLE
That's something done on the Japanese side as evidenced by the difference in animation timing/editing. It's likely something done for the international masters, which is something we can't blame Sentai on (for once).
>> ARTICLE
I know it's not Sentai's fault. They couldn't get the copyright so there is nothing they can do about it. It's a shame, though, since that insert song is pretty awesome.
>> ARTICLE
You mean Katioucha/Katyusha?

Yup. Kinda made Pravda my favourite school outside of Ooarai. Russian singing sounds really cool in my opinion.

That was the moment I thought that these were Russians. Up till then it felt like an act to me.

FUCK YEAH GOLDEN EGGS!

the list looks nothing like the mal top 10.  


>> ARTICLE
So anime is saved?

Usavitch sure was entertaining. No sarcasm.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad sells better then the After Story.. Completely reasonable! It takes a different kind of human to be able to look at that when you want to re-watch an anime.. 
>> ARTICLE
Apparently the World of Golden Eggs is an american style cartoon, with 15-minute episodes. It's a children's anime and also is priced more normally (only $55 per season, instead of $300) - maybe that's why it has so many sales. 
[Amazon JP link](http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%87%E3%83%B3%E3%82%A8%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B9-World-GOLDEN-%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%83%B31-DVD%E3%83%9C%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9/dp/B0019JJ4NU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1390438781&sr=8-1&keywords=The+World+of+GOLDEN+EGGS)

Turns out maybe Japanese people don't like paying hundreds of dollars for anime DVDs either!

I never realized that Honey and Clover, Mushishi, and Mononoke sold that well. Makes me kind of happy.

It ended up being better than it seemed like it should have been from its premise. It's worth a watch for sure, IMO.

I think a lot of its success is because its timing of Kantai Collection explosive popularity. 

Only seen two episodes and I'm liking so far, though the heavy usage of CG on the characters is a little jarring but I'll get used to it.

I'm glad a CG heavy show got such good sales. Hopefully it'll lead to more CG shows, leading to an improvement in CG animation. Driving down production costs, meaning more seasons of things and potentially cheaper BD/DVDs.

Absolutely. I was certain it would suck, but it was actually great. Roll on season two.

That gurren lagann vs Fate/zero match was the hardest one for me personally to decide.

Looks like that's going to be the case for a lot of people. TTGL was up 54-53 when I cast my vote. This one's gonna come down to the wire but I have a feeling that TTGL is gonna pull it out. If it can take down NGE by that much of a margin then I think it can take out Fate/Zero too. 
>> ARTICLE
Just cast my vote making TTGL 104-103 F/Z

Come comrades, let our vote count be the count that pierces the heavens!

Currently 147/144.

Man, as a huge League of Legends fan and a Diamond 1 player, I just can't watch LCS. It's so boring seeing the same teams play over and over again. I really wish there were more tournaments instead of the monotony that is LCS.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I switched to Dota 2! Whether or not you like the game better, I think Valve has done a much better job with the pro scene. They host one tournament annually, and there a tons of other, somewhat smaller tournaments throughout the year. There a loads of good teams from each region, and you get to see some interesting hero choices, plays, and strategies.

I like the casters and players a lot better too, there are a lot of different personalities with different... personalities, who all bring something unique to the table. Also, you can watch games from the client or twitch.
>> ARTICLE
Well for me personally I have like 30+ friends who play League and 0 who play Dota 2. And I really love to play with my friends so making the switch would be hard.
>> ARTICLE
The issue is how it's a team-game. So in terms of salary/people... used to watch SC2 GOM tournaments before League, and you can have a lot more players there, with much more change in the matchups.

Then again, more champions, less races.
>> ARTICLE
>Then again, more champions, less races.

It's too bad we only get to see about 20 champions played until next patch when we get a new set of about 20... 
>> ARTICLE
more like replace 2-3 :(
>> ARTICLE
Yeah true. Back in the old days, it was all about tournies. IPL (rip), IEM, Dreamhack. But, I think it's better for the whole industry. Having a LCS makes league more like a real sport and more games means more content from third parties, more drama (yay), more trashtalking, more games to back up that trashtalking, and simply a better stage to prove who really is the better team.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, fortunately it was recently announced that they'll maybe add more participating teams to the lcs next season, so that will maybe create some diversity/uniqueness in matchups

Raildex lost first round

*cries*

Probably because only Index II and Railgun S 1-16 episodes were good.

Mushishi lost to toradora
;_;
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop losing is definitely a travesty and while I understand why TTGL won against Evangelion because it's easier to get into and a more "epic" show, it's still disappointing to see Eva lose. 
>> ARTICLE
This is why I hate the anime community right now. A space-adventure show loses to a harem. We have fallen out of the bounds of geek culture and into something lower. We really have to ask ourselves, is this what we want anime to become? Harems and ecchi? If we keep this mentality up, anime will have to become a form of softcore pornography to keep sales up. Don't get me wrong, the monogatari series is good, and the best of the ecchi harems, but it should not be more popular than the timeless classic that is Bebop. There is something inherently wrong with that. 
>> ARTICLE
You're really throwing Monogatari in with countless generic ecchi harem shows? Have you even seen it?
>> ARTICLE
I said it's the best of the ecchi harem shows. It's still an ecchi harem though. 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is this unique little thing that manages to balance entertainment, themes, and interesting characters with campy humor, endearing/moe characters, and ecchi fanservice.

 It's able to do that because, at its core, all it's trying to do is put on a show. And, in my opinion, that's the best thing a show could try to do. It doesn't pretend to be some amazingly-written and literary piece of art, because it's still an animated late night TV comedy series, and it doesn't try to be heartless, money-milking, tit-squeezing moeshit either, because a show still needs to captivate and cultivate interest in order to entertain.

Is it ecchi? Oh yeah. A harem? A bit. But it's also a show, with great characters, great music, and great comedy. So what's wrong with having some fun? I'd rather have that than another angsty, grimdark series with a permanent scowl and an ugly color palette. 

 And, hell, Bebop is a classic, was one of my first and to this day is one of my most beloved, and I'm sure it's exactly the same with many others. But it had its fair share of problems, just like Monogatari and every piece of entertainment in existence does. The effect that nostalgia has on the series is terrifyingly strong; and that means two things. One, the show was so amazing and innovative that it caused so many people to keep it in their hearts for so long in the first place, and two, people looking back at it now tend to look back it with thick, thick rose-colored glasses.

**TL/DR;** Deciding between favorite TV shows always has and always will be shitty for all involved, let's be friends.
>> ARTICLE
I was being harsh on monogatari. I enjoyed it too. Just expressing general grievances. 
>> ARTICLE
No you're right it's BS that Bebop loss against gatari...
>> ARTICLE
Clannad is about to lose to NGNL. The BS meter is high will this poll.
>> ARTICLE
There's just *a little bit* more too it than just being "an ecchi harem". If that's the only thing you took away from it you very very much need to rewatch it. 
>> ARTICLE
You responded to this guy just as I did homie.

Are you sure you're not spiritually linked to me or something?
>> ARTICLE
The hell man? What's even more strange is that I was writing a much more detailed comment about the Monogatari series and then thought to myself "fuck it, someone else will write it" and then erased it in favor of the short one I left.

But I got nothin'.

As someone who has only seen the original ending of NGE this doesn't surprise me.
>> ARTICLE
Like I said in the other thread, both Eva and Gurren Lagann spiral into insanity at the end. 

Only one of them does it intentionally.
>> ARTICLE
Am I dense for not being certain which you are referring to? They both do everything intentionally. I'm guessing this is supposed to be critical of Eva but the ending was completely deliberate so I'm not really sure...
>> ARTICLE
Bebop had to lose because most people in /r/anime haven't even seen it.
>> ARTICLE
That really seems to be the case and it's a real shame. It's just a classic anime to me right there next to Outlaw Star, Trigun, and Rurouni Kenshin. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I'm currently in the process of watching Bebop (about halfway through) and while its definitely a good show, its not one of my favorites. I would have voted for Bakemonogatari over it.
>> ARTICLE
See the problem here is that most of bebop is episodic until the end where it wraps everything up and makes the journey meaningful. Having not completed a show and claiming other shows are better is just one problem with a popularity contes... I mean tournament like this.
>> ARTICLE
There's an extra poll today today with the previously eliminated shows to decide 17th to 32nd place. Vote for as many as you'd like. http://strawpoll.me/2109607
>> ARTICLE
**Match 1:**  FMA will probably win because it had so much more time to flesh out the story and was done well.  I'd like for Angel Beats to win, but I do have to agree with some its critics in that it does feel rushed.

**Match 4:** NGNL will probably win, due to popularity and recent memory, but I am a bit sad it is able to outclass established classics on that alone.  I'm sure that if this same poll was taken a year or two in the future, NGNL would do significantly worse.  While fun and entertaining, it doesn't really impact the audience in a meaningful way.

**Match 5:** Code Geass will win because it was entertaining, done somewhat well, and because everyone who watched Haruhi remembers the Endless Eight episodes, which severely reduced the audience's experience of Haruhi.

**Match 6:** This one should be close, but I hope for Fate/Zero to win because it was not only entertaining, I feel that it also had better characterization and themes present.  TTGL is fun, but I feel like its overhyped and that's causing me to go against it.

**Match 7:** Toradora should win because it impacts the audience and is memorable as one of the best rom-coms in anime.  Death Note, on the other hand, is entertaining, but I feel that its just a fun show and doesn't really leave any hard message for the audience to remember.

**Match 8:** Bakemonogatari should take the cake since it was memorable in pretty much every way, whereas Anohana has some problems with its drama feeling slightly arbitrary and (as I understand it from others) it feel emotionally manipulative.

I don't feel confident enough to comment on matches 2 and 3 since I haven't seen Psycho-Pass, Stein;s Gate, and Baccano!  I know I should get on them, but I haven't gotten around to watching them due to lack of interest.
>> ARTICLE
For me, in any other bracket, I wouldn't have voted for NGNL, but I'm just one of those stonehearted bastards that utterly hated Clannad/AS
>> ARTICLE
The best-of-16 selections are basically shows that were in /r/anime's favorite anime list from a year ago, plus one flavor-of-the-month, so I'm not sure there's anything interesting to say.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'd hope they'd be on /r/anime's favorites list, or else I'd have done a poor job of selecting anime. That's kind of the whole point of the tournament. It'd be a little strange to choose unpopular anime...

Well, then I miss the point of people fawning over the same shows over and over again.

Okay, next round, here we go.

Also, holy titty, Monogatari was able to pull through and defeat Cowboy Bebop. What a display. I'm glad my favorite show won out, but I definitely understand and sympathize with those who are currently drowning in sorrow. It was a shame to see Bebop go, especially **before fucking No Game No Life**.

**-- Speculation --**

**1.** Angel Beats!, beloved as it is by many, including myself, has much more criticism and hate tethered to it than the majority of the rest of the giants here. I think it's safe to say it's going to taste FMA's big ol' boots right here.

**2.** Champloo and Psycho-Pass. Two mature, well-done, and original shows going neck and neck. While Champloo has had a consistent following ever since it aired, Psycho-Pass is much more fresh in everyone's mind, and having Urobuchi's name attached to it and a second season incoming very soon isn't going to act against it, now, isn't it? Although, hell, Champloo can still pull through this, with its appeal and Watanabe and all. This is a match to watch.

**3.** Two well-done and intelligent shows again here, although I think Steins;Gate has ^(sadly, IMO) a good advantage in popularity, at least here in /r/anime. Not to mention, there's just plain much more available material that pertains to Steins;Gate than there is to Baccano!; more fan-art, more memes, more discussion. Steins;Gate might be the one to take Baccano! out, and I'll be ready to catch my friend as he hits the ground if it comes to that.

**4.** If NGNL beat Madoka, it's going to bring a good, hard challenge to Clannad here. Well, Clannad definitely has a lot of criticism dragging it down, that first season really is a thorn in its side. But I think a lot of people still agree that it's a good show. However, considering the majority of people believe Madoka was a *great* show, I don't know exactly how this all spells out for Clannad. But, shit, NGNL didn't deserve to make it remotely this far. I'm rooting for you, Clannad. Tear shit up.

**5.** Two modern classics here, in terms of popularity. Geass probably has a bit of an edge in the popularity field and the critical acclaim, while Suzumiya is going to hold strong to its dedicated, devoted fanbase. This is going to be a good match, I'm standing to fight for based Haruhi-sama as always, let's see how it all goes.

**6.** Fate/Zero and Gurren Lagann. The King of Kings ^^heh of high-budget action, dark themes, and drama, versus the King of Kings of mecha, adventure, motivation, and campy/fun-loving style. This might be the fairest and most fearsome conflict yet for us to spectate. I'm voting for Fate/Zero myself, but I wouldn't have really minded voting for Lagann. Shivering with anticipation.

**7.** Here we have THE gateway anime versus THE romantic comedy. The fangirls versus the tsundere-lovers. Death Note is going to summon its fearsome and humongous host as always, and Toradora! has its dedicated and loving fans ready to rush to its aid. As for myself, I'm doing my part to defend Toradora! against the Death Note onslaught, and I hope we can hold out. There's gonna be a fight, but I'm remaining faithful.

**8.** I'm applauding you, Monogatari. You exceeded my expectations, and I'm sure the expectations of many others, you sexy little thing. And AnoHana baby, I love you, but if Bebop kicked the bucket, you'd ought to start digging your grave now. I'm sorry, I truly am, you're still one of the best. Ganbatte, Monogatari.
>> ARTICLE
>  Here we have THE gateway anime versus THE romantic comedy

I always thought FMA: Brotherhood was THE gateway anime.

>> ARTICLE
FMA Brotherhood is one of the top ones but Death Note is literally the most popular show show on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but Brotherhood is the highest rated one.
>> ARTICLE
Fear not fellow Madoka fans, it looks we have spot #17 secured.

:(
>> ARTICLE
So my prediction for the final is FMA vs. Code Geass, and I think FMA will win the whole thing though Code Geass should put up a decent fight. As popular as Steins;Gate is, I don't think it can take down down FMA and the matches on the other side are too close for me to think that they'll beat Code Geass (well Monogatari isn't close but I think it's too niche to win against Code Geass).
>> ARTICLE
Out of all the shows in the tournament everything I like has either already lost or is guaranteed going to lose.  

[All is lost](http://i.imgur.com/albpYVX.jpg)  

I was able to predict pretty much every result so far except for NGNL vs Madoka, I thought for sure Madoka would win, like there was absolutely no way for it to lose. I was wrong... so wrong...
>> ARTICLE
Madoka and NGE losing definitely was unexpected
>> ARTICLE
Match 1: I see a lot of love going around for Angel Beats!, but there's no way I can see it beating FMA:B who some would argue is objectively the greatest anime of all time.

Match 2: Personally I'm voting for Psycho Pass. It'll be close but seeing as it's popularity is on the upswing with the upcoming second season and a current re-airing it should win out.

Match 3: I absolutely adore Baccano! and everything about it so I'll do my part to try and push it further, but sadly it doesn't quite have the same following as Steins;Gate so it looks as though this is most likely the end.

Match 4: I liked NLGL fine but it really has no bussiness coming this far simply because it was hyped so hard. If Clannad doesn't take it down Steins;Gate most certainly will.

Match 5: Code Geass is a gateway anime for many people, including myself, and one of my personal favorites. Haruhi should put up a good fight but I think Geass has it.

Match 6: Easily the closest match out of all of them. I personally will be voting for Fate/Zero, but I predict that the manly passion of TTGL will come out on top.

Match 7: Another super popular gateway anime versus everybody's favorite RomCom. This one will be close as well but I think Toradora! is too beloved to lose.

Match 8: Seeing as how the Monogatari Series beat out Cowboy Bebop, one of the great anime classics, AnoHana doesn't really stand a chance.

Excited to see who is going to take the whole thing, personally my bets are on FMA. 

On a side note I'm still depressed Gintama didn't even crack the top 32.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder... should you vote in any of these matches if you haven't seen both shows? I know there's a "I haven't seen either" choice, but what if you've only seen one? Because in many cases I think this kind of turns into a "which show has been viewed by the most people" competition, which isn't particularly interesting.
>> ARTICLE
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CLANNAD!!
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm out. I predict FMA wins, but honestly, I feel like NGNL has a could also have chance, which pisses me off. Stop voting for the hype guys, it'll piss me off if the flavor of the month takes this. This was more fitting yesterday, but allow me to dig up what I had to say about NGNL on a rage thread a few weeks ago. 

>NGNL IS NOT THE GREATEST ANIME EVER CREATED. YOU ALL NEED TO GET YOUR HEADS OUT OF YOUR ASSES. ITS FUN, THATS IT GOD DAMN IT.

>YOU'RE ALL PUTTING IT IN YOUR FAVORITES LISTS NOW, GO BACK TO THE SHOW IN TWO MONTHS WHEN THE HYPE IS GONE. YOU'LL SEE THAT THE SHOW IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN AVERAGE ANIME THAT PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED TO CLING TO FOR SOME STUPID FUCKING REASON.

>REMEMBER SAO, TITAN, KILL LA KILL? ACCORDING TO THE SAME DUMB ASSES THAT ARE PARADING NGNL AROUND LIKE IT'S THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST, ALL THREE OF THOSE SHOWS WERE, AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF, THE BEST ANIME EVER. IT'S A FUCKING PATTERN, STOP GETTING SUCKED INTO THE HYPE.

>TLDR--- FUCK HYPE.

Angry and vulgar, but still my exact feelings. Stop voting for it.
>> ARTICLE
Different people have different opinions. Deal with it
>> ARTICLE
>Stop voting for it.

No.
>> ARTICLE
I just wonder why the NGNL supporters are so silent. Negative post after negative post pile up in these topics, but never anyone defending it. Yet it keeps on winning. Hey, silent majority! Get in here and tell RandomMan why he's full of shit. Arguing is part of the fun of these type of topics after all. 

So why do you guys love NGNL so much?
>> ARTICLE
NGNL was a lot of fun.  It is really silly and free spirited.  The art is very pretty.  The fanservice makes fun of fanservice, which appeals to people who like fanservice and people who hate fanservice (to me the fanservice is satirical parody of other shows).  It is an ongoing show so it doesn't have an ending for people to dislike.

Of all the anime I have seen so far in 2014 my single favorite episode of anything has been NGNL episode #6 - it is hilarious.

I wouldn't go so far as to say NGNL is the greatest anime of all time (I'll give that one to Ghost in the Shell (movie) or my personal favorite (Madoka), but I enjoyed it more than many of the other shows in this contest.
>> ARTICLE
Next you're going to tell me it's a deconstruction of the ecchi genre... >_> 

I'll give you that it's fun and pretty, but I don't buy that it's trying to parody fan service with its non-stop panty shot parade. Instead, it's fully embracing the genre. They know that boobs sell, and they ain't shy about shouting it out to the world.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't people say the same thing about KLK?
>> ARTICLE
I always held that No Game No Life was good because it didn't take itself too serious. It never really tried to be more than what it is, an action ecchi show, and that gave it all the more strength. 

But honestly to say it's anywhere near Madoka Magica, or even a 10 is a little crazy. I wouldn't be surprised to see this show get hit by some level of backlash latter on. Maybe not SAO levels, but some level. It just isn't top 50 of all time.
>> ARTICLE
NGNL is far, far above Madoka, though I agree it's not quite a 10. You know, not everyone is a fan of Madoka. Saying they're crazy for thinking NGNL is better than it is stupid.
>> ARTICLE
eh.

I mean sure, not everyone likes the same things. It's just that, in my opinion, a show that needs to throw a bunch of unnecessary nudes and fan service to keep you entertained is automatically worse than a show that doesn't do that.
>> ARTICLE
My opinion differs in that I don't think NGNL "needed" to have fanservice to be entertaining. In fact, I know I personally would've still been entertained  without the fanservice because I don't really like fanservice all that much. However, the fanservice in NGNL was, I thought, done tastefully and wasn't distracting and annoying like it certainly can be. I either found it hilarious or didn't really notice it.
>> ARTICLE
Whether or not the fan service was needed in the show to be entertaining doesn't matter, even though in the this case I agree it would have been fine or even better without it. The problem is the show thought it needed it and used it heavily. It used those kind of cheap tactics in hopes to stay relevant, and whether or not it really needed them, doesn't change the fact they were used.

As for the way the fan service was done, well.....subtle isn't the word I would use. The bit in episode 6 was a fantastically done joke and was fine, but to list of some of the other problems

* Loliservice
* Like 5 bath scenes
* Tentacle shampoo? (seriously what the hell)
* A whole shit ton of stuff during the finale
* Magically grown boobs
* The first shot of shiro being her panties.

I could also include steph in general but my problems with her and the way the show treats her are way more than just fanservice. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call it subtle either. It wasn't. However, even so I didn't find it distracting or all in-my-face about it. I'll try to explain. Like the stuff with Shiro, for example, I didn't really pay much attention to it. Because, well, she's 11. It'd be like if in real life I saw an 11 year old in their underwear; I wouldn't care at all. It doesn't even register on a sexual scale, so it almost doesn't even come off as fanservice. Or the bath scenes. My attention was being held by the conversations and the funny actions so I wasn't really thinking about the naked bodies. Or Kurumi's boobs. Given her personality, I totally wasn't surprised she'd try something like that. I thought it was funny. 

I know it wasn't all perfect though. Some of it absolutely could've been toned down, but still it really didn't detract from the show enough for me to be bothered by it. 

However, ignoring all that, the main problem you have is that the show did it in the first place. I see why you think that's a problem since it's basically just pandering bullshit, but ultimately if I'm not bothered by something then I just don't care about the why or the necessity of it. I can definitely see why people would have problems with it, but I don't. Some people are against any and all fanservice, but it's not like that for me. The only reason I'm not fond of it is because I've seen so much of it that I just grew tired of it. So, if I think it's done fairly well, I can easily be swayed into not minding it.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call NGNL fanservice tasteful to be honest. They went straight for the ass of a eleven year old when they had the chance and most of it was pushed straigh into your face. It didn't have the tiniest bit of subtlety, just always wanted to show *more* and impress you. In my book thats not tasteful, its obnoxious and distracting.
>> ARTICLE
[Sorry but I had to check to make sure...](/s "According to your MAL, you have never actually seen Madoka Magica")  

Also NGNL is average at best, your opinion is shit m8 :^)
>> ARTICLE
Indeed, my opinion is definitely biased since it's only based on what I've heard and I haven't given Madoka a fair chance. But I don't plan on ever giving it a chance either. I'm not a fan of magical girl anime and that doesn't automatically mean I'm a fan of "Look at me! At first glance I'm your typical magical girl anime but in actuality I'm dark and edgy" either. I'm not a fan of the genre it deconstructs nor am I a fan of grim and dark shows, so it just doesn't have anything for me. I'm not gonna try to argue that my opinion isn't shit but that's just how it is.

AHAHAHAHAH you fucking admitted it too, you haven't even seen the show yet you claim NGNL is "far, far above".

This is actually the first round i voted for No Game, but only because I had Clannad shoved down my throat by some of my friends and it was made a pretty bad experience.
>> ARTICLE
I've voted for NGNL every time so far, not because I think it's an amazing show, I just enjoyed it more than anything it's been up against so far.
>> ARTICLE
Well, considering it's up against Clannad/Afterstory, and I considered most of Clannad (excluding Afterstory) to be sub-par, it's actually my choice this round. That being said, it beat Madoka, so wtf.
>> ARTICLE
Many more people read the subreddit than post on it. That's the actual explanation.

Most people also know the simple truth - they enjoy what they do, and "defending" one's enjoyment is as silly as demanding one do so. They're unlikely to get you to enjoy it more, and they'll enjoy the whole thing less, so why bother?

The conspiracy explanation is people vote for it just to troll people into pointing out how it's not a good show ;)

>> ARTICLE
Well I agree that there reallyis no point in trying to convince other why you like a certain thing but I feel like ngnl gets a lot of hate so ill do it anyways. 

It really just boils down to the fact that I had a great time watching it. is it a critical masterpiece? Not at all. Objectively is it superior to madoka when it comes down to every little nuance of what makes an award-winning show? Lol, hell no. But did I find itmore enjoyable to watch? Yes, which is why I voted for it. 

In a lot of the ping pong discussion threads people were trashing on ngnl because people were calling it anime of the spring season while pingpong is the better show, from a critical standpoint.  And I agree that it was but it doesnt change the fact that it was ngnl that made me upset that I had to wait a week for the next episode, not so much with pingpong.

And its not like ngnl is the transformers of anime. It isnt some worthless show that is only good because fanservice. Just because it has a lot of hype behind it doesnt make it a bad show. Just like how I voted for it over madoka doesnt mean I have shit taste. 

I loved the premise, I loved the absurdity of the games, I loved how creative it got with its fanservice (super heakthy space op), loved the comedy and I really loved the  characters. I mean steph may be a useless character but damn if I dont find ithilarious, and i really love telling my friends how much of a steph they are. Sora and shiro are both ridiculously op (much like a certain character from a certain vrmmorpg anime that people love to hate) but I like that blank never loses. The way they analyze and manipulate ttheir oponnents and the games is awesome.

I really enjoyed watching ngnl, and this contest only asked you one thing, "which was your favorite?" Obviously the hype, and the fact that its still fresh in our minds, probably gave a different result than if this was done 6 months from now. But I know that I wouldnt have voted differently because I genuinely found ngnl to be better than madoka. It may be the unpopular opinion but it doesnt make ngnl worse than madoka, it just means people have different opinions. 
>> ARTICLE
Great response. Personally, I watch anime when I'm stuck at home, bored, looking for something to do. I'm not ashamed to admit that I vote for No Game No Life because it served its purpose: it kept me fucking entertained. It brought a smile to my face, week after week, as Sora and Shiro continued their crazy antics.

Unlike Code Geass, No Game No Life never caused me to contemplate moral or philosophical issues... but it positively impacted my life. Often, I get wrapped up in my own drama: my friend said this, I screwed up by doing that, I don't know how the future will turn out. I'm sure I'm not alone. But No Game No Life reminded me that life should be fun, and that I have the power to make the best out of my situation.

Many people cite episode 6 (the Materialization Shiritori) as one of their favorite episodes, yet I've seen a lot of comments which poke holes in the anime logic. When I first watched it, I didn't really care about that. I was just grinning from ear to ear because damn, did he just break physics?! Later, when I gave it some more thought, I realized that the game's logic did make sense. And then I realized that even if it hadn't made sense, I would have still been amused. I think that's awesome!

To all the haters of No Game No Life: I'm sorry if No Game No Life beat out your favorite anime and disappointed you; I felt the same way when FLCL lost so quickly. Still, I wish you would keep your hate to yourself and not ruin others' enjoyment too. :)

Damn. While I saw it coming, Evangelion losing against one of my most hated shows is frustrating. Now I know how people felt about Madoka yesterday.

>Full Metal Alchemist/FMA: Brotherhood vs Angel Beats!

There is no way that Angel Beats! is winning this one.

>Samurai Champloo vs Psycho-Pass

Psycho-Pass has this one.

>Steins;Gate vs Baccano!

Steins;Gate will win this round.

>No Game No Life vs Clannad/Clannad: After Story

Regardless of how much people like Clannad,  I think people will be voting against No Game No Life out of spite but anything can happen.

>Code Geass vs The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya

I think Code Geass will win.

>Fate/Zero vs Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

As much as I dislike TTGL, It will most likely beat Fate/Zero.

>Death Note vs Toradora!

Ah, Toradora! Another series that I dislike but will probably beat Death Note. But who knows, I was wrong about yesterday's result so I could be wrong here.

>AnoHana vs Monogatari Series

I hate to say it but Monogatari will beat AnoHana.

You said you disliked like half the shows.

I wouldn't say half but I do dislike a good amount of these shows.
>> ARTICLE
I just found this tournament today, but judging from the Day 6 results, I think that I hate you all already.  Or at least whoever keeps voting for NGNL.
>> ARTICLE
I hardly think NGNL vs Madoka was a popularity contest at all. Madoka is #34 in popularity while NGNL is still over #100, but for average ratings it's vice-versa. NGNL won because it was voted by the same people who gave it a higher average score than Madoka. 

So now that it's No Game No Life vs. Clannad, I'm afraid NGNL's number is finally up. After Story is the second highest ranked show in existence, and NGNL just doesn't come close.
>> ARTICLE
When you talk about popularity you have to realize it is trending (current) popularity.

The popularity list on MAL is irrelevant.  It doesn't take into account that 1 person rating madoka 2 years ago translates to much less popularity than 1 person rating NGNL 2 days ago.  It doesn't account for popularity decay at all.

Can you organize this better. Like can you make 1 post with all the days and all the results? Or at least include previous days posts in the next days one. The full bracket is bad because it doesn't show the total votes.

the fact that Bakuman wasn't in this disappoints me.

I would argue that the adaption of Bakuman wasn't as good as the manga.

Same reason I voted against Death Note in one of the rounds, the manga is just the better version when you compare the two.
>> ARTICLE
My first time seeing this Tournament- and holy shit am I surprised.

---

* A little sad to see Durarara go under but it barely has a fan base behind it compared to the fucking monster that is Angel Beats

* My poor baby "Welcome to The NHK" it doesn't matter how great you were, against FMA? You didn't stand a chance

* Happy to see the AOT dying down a bit, a friend of mine enjoyed Psycho-Pass so I'll have to give that a shot


* Honestly, I hope Steins ; Gate at least gets to battle FMA. I know it's overhyped as all hell- but I really do think it's that good. Of course I don't even need to say a thing about FMA, it's more than well deserving of its place atop an anime tournament 

* Really surprised to see Baccano! make it this far, which is great because that show is all kinds of awesome

* WowNGNL vs Madoka and NGNL wonwhat in the hell? Did I watch the wrong anime guys? 

* xD Who's fucking idea was it to put Elfen Lied against Madoka? To say it's a landslide is one hell of an understatement

* Clannad's the best in that section IMO

* I'll try not to write too much more. Code Geass is well-deserving of its place, TTGL is not a surprise- it's great. Sad to see so little love for FLCL (My favorite of all time). NGE stays exactly where it has been the past 20 years with its fan base , "meh". Some people love it and some hate it. I fall in the middle as well. Death Note, like someone said, deserves a hell of a lot of credit for being the ultimate gateway anime against the powerhouse of all romance animes. Anohana is a bit surprising to see surpass Hellsing but I think there's a bigger fan base on r/anime.

* Did Cowboy Bebopjust lose against Bakemontogatari? By 100 votes?! Don't get me wrong guys, shows damn good. But to deny not only the near flawless masterpiece of Bebop AND it's impact on anime? C'mon guys, I thought you were better than this. I'm not madjust disappointed 




 
>> ARTICLE
>WowNGNL vs Madoka and NGNL wonwhat in the hell? Did I watch the wrong anime guys?

>Clannad's the best in that section IMO

As you'll notice, NGNL is currently winning that battle as well. I mean sure, *I* think it's better than Madoka and Clannad but doing this against those two powerhouses is just crazy. That hype man...

I'm sure it won't stand a chance against Steins;Gate though. Or at least if it gets through this round I hope it's stopped there. Hype should only take you so far.

Gintama lost to Naruto? Hmm, interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I still don't understand how that happened. Naruto is now sitting there comfortably in last place of the 17-32nd placement match and I would've thought the weekly Gintama discussions was increasing people's awareness of Gintama. Naruto's not super terrible or anything but just... How?

Yea I mean I enjoy Naruto to an extent and all as it was one of the shows that got me serious into anime...but come on Gintama has it all. To each their own though.

Madoka and AoT are dominating the placement poll. I voted for Bebop, Mushishi, From the New World, and... K-On! Poor K-On, sitting near the bottom. At least it's faring better than Naruto. I thought Naruto would at least be more popular than Yu Yu Hakusho.
>> ARTICLE
sorry but in what universe is stylized otaku pandering better than bebop? ugh this subreddit sometimes...
>> ARTICLE
how the hell is hellsing and yu yu hakusho doing so poorly?  I guess I can't say anything since I haven't watched baccano yet...  but man!  Also, the seeding for kokoro connect was terrible!  Man i loved that anime...  I could see so many anime making it waaay further with better seeds, like raildex, and kenshin.  OH well, this tourney is insane! thanks for doing this!
>> ARTICLE
It's a shame the likes of Hellsing and YYH are doing so badly, but having recently seen Baccano!, it really is something else. You'd do yourself a favor to watch it. 

And sadly I've seen mostly bad things about Kokoro Connect, despite thinking it was above-average as far as slice-of-life dramatic shows go. I know there was some scandal to it at the time it was airing (not really sure what the deal was, exactly) that might have hurt the way some people saw it, but how it goes largely unnoticed while Clannad and AnoHana receive mass attention is beyond me.
>> ARTICLE
I had no idea kokoro had some sort of scandal, but luckily, i give no fucks about the outside worlds going ons when watching the show.  I think the show itself was a small masterpiece and I can easily put it on par with the likes of Angel Beats in terms of length and what they got done.  (I might even say I enjoyed kokoro even more).

I will watch baccano after I get through the gatari series then.  That series put me off years ago, but I tried it again and I can stomache it now.  It may even become a favorite :P

Hellsing...  My did i love that.
>> ARTICLE
I believe the scandal was about a prank they pulled on an aspiring voice actor if I remember correctly. They pretended that he landed some type of major role in the project, but then they made him the coffee boy or gave him like 1 line or something.

And Kokoro Connect was god-awful after the first arc.
>> ARTICLE
>Kokoro Connect was god-awful after the first arc.

Heeey, while I admit the show definitely dropped off the deep end a bit for a while after the introductory arc, it definitely picked up in the end and Michi Random turned it into one of my favorites. But it's cool, friendo, I respect your opinion.

And, here, /u/racheuphist, is a nice document that explains the whole [Kokoro Connect scandal](http://pastebin.com/EvntSeCV).
>> ARTICLE
thanks!  I agree, kokoro connect stayed a strong anime for me because it started strong and ended strong.  I even enjoyed the middle, it's not like it was terrible ever for me.

That prank sounds terrible, but that still doesn't effect my thoughts on the show, just the director person.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone really needs to tell their friends who like Clannad to come and vote. While I loved NGNL it had no business getting this far and has no business going any further. At least Steins;Gate will take it down if all else fails though.
>> ARTICLE
No chance. NGNL is simply a superior anime.
>> ARTICLE
Come on man I just checked your MAL and you haven't even seen Clannad at all. I can understand if you liked NGNL but at least watch Clannad and AS before going around calling NGNL better.

Sure, i plan to. But i was talking about NGNL taking down Steins Gate.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh haha alright I misread that.

NP, when i wrote that i assumed NGNL already won since there was only an hour left and it had a nice lead on clannad.
>> ARTICLE
Voting ending in about an hour.
>> ARTICLE
First match I see going to FMA pretty easily. Second match could be closer, but I'm pretty confident in Samurai Champloo. Third match should be really close. I'm giving it to Steins;Gate by 5%. And then we come to NGNL again. I've been betting against it every round, and I should know better by now, but I still think Clannad wins this one. Code Geass should have a fairly convincing win as well as Gurren Lagann most likely. Death Note will slay Toradora!. And finally, if Monogatari was able to beat Bebop, there's no way it's losing to AnoHana.
>> ARTICLE
You are underestimating Steins;Gate.

I'm pretty sure it will win the entire tournament. Also, underestimating Toradora and Psycho Pass, they should surprise you. Psycho Pass will win, and Toradora will put up a good fight, will be a really close one.
>> ARTICLE
So NGE lost to TTGL. I guess it didn't have enough tits.

>> ARTICLE
Because NGE is completely and utterly devoid of fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
Fan service has little to do with it I think. NGE's plot completely breaks down in the last third of the show. For a show that is supposed to exemplify story and characters that's kind of a death blow.

TTGL never pretends it is too worried about those things, it is all about the experience and the spectacle, and with the exception of episode four it manages to deliver on that again and again while raising its scope each time.

I don't pretend that Gurren Lagann is objectively the best show in the competition, but in terms of fun and enjoyment I think it is.
>> ARTICLE
That penguin shower scene doesn't count.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, NGE has tits. It just didn't have enough drills piercing the heavens.

It did have a earth sized woman having her forehead vulva pierced by a crucified robot... What more do you want??

I don't know man. I wanted NGE to win but, sadly, that didn't happen.

I'm sad about NGE but at least quality is being recognized in the case of NGNL. I see it rigthfully defeating Steins Gate and FMA and going to the finals.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked bakemonogatari but seriously in no way should it have won against bebop... seriously that's kind of sad to see. I get some shows are pretty overrated in r/anime, (overrated might not be the word so much as grossly over represented), but there are a bunch of shows that shouldn't have won their previous bracket such because they are hyped up on anime reddit, (such as no game no life beating madoka!? seriously its like a liar game that focuses too much on fanservice and not enough on the game. Clannad beating from the new world? ummm ok. I liked clannad but from the new world was written better and just a better quality show. Gurren Lagann... I guess I saw this coming. Probably the most over hyped show on this subreddit. Also AnoHana was sad but really it probably shouldnt have beaten Hellsing.

Argh, NGNL vs Clannad. 

A deviant otaku fetishe vs forced emotional gut punches coupled with silly melodrama, guess which one I voted....

It's okay, dude. You can admit that you voted for Clannad. No one will think poorly of you at all.

So then Death Note is objectively bad then too right? Towards then ending of Death Note it was just "I know that you know that I knew that you were thinking that I may have thought...." pretty much predicting what each other would do and where they hid the Notebook.

It's only twelve episodes, which isn't that long.  So sure go ahead and watch it.  I can tell you the anime's main purpose or do I say the plot itself is to make you cry.  I didn't cry, but it had some good highlights.  Not really too hyped for the movie, more interested in the Madoka and S;G movies instead. ;x  
>> ARTICLE
It's eleven episodes. No need to send out the search party for an episode twelve.
>> ARTICLE
Well I did watched it while it air, so its been almost two years.  The anime didn't really stood out to me much to know exactly everything perfectly.  Usually anime are 12 or 24 episodes long, so that got into the mix.  Since it's actually 11 episodes, that would make it even easier to watch.

I think Gurren Lagann or Bebop make it out of the left hand bracket, leaning closer to Gurren Lagann.

Champloo or Full Metal Alchemist is what I would guess on the left hand side. I think No Game No Life will draw enough ire for taking down Madoka that it doesn't make it to the finals.

My goodness, the Psycho-Pass to AoT voting and even the NGNL to Madoka were very, very close.

Remember, upvote the thread.

Match 1: Code Geass by a lot. I think Hunter will get similar numbers to Ping Pong

Match 2:  As much as /r/anime likes cute, I don't think K-On is moving to round 3. Melancholy by a good margin

Match 3: Well Fate/Zero beat SAO, but One Piece has been building a fan base for years. I still think Fate/Zero will win.

Match 4: I haven't actually seen Lagann, but this subreddit is in love with it, and NGE barely made it out of its last match. I'm going with Lagann.

Match 5: Death Note by landslide

Match 6: I'm really hoping Mushishi wins this, but Toradora! is like *the* romantic comedy everyone recommends whenever the topic comes up. Toradora by at least 10%

Match 7: AnoHana won't be beat by some vampires...

Match 8: Bebop's going all the way to the finals. I don't care who they face.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Monogatari is beating Bebop and I'm pretty happy about that.
>> ARTICLE
Anohana is manipulative as all hell, but it's still well made, and people love it for that.

Hellsing, on the other hand is just good, ridiculous fun.  It's enjoyable, but at a very different level.  I doubt it really stands a chance.

> As much as /r/anime likes cute

/r/awwnime, perhaps, but not really /r/anime. Moe seems to be pretty controversial here. Some people like it, other people see it as some sort of maniacal cross between the boogeyman of the anime industry and the heat death of the universe.

Bebop's actually losing at the time I'm posting this. I'm surprised...

Psycho-Pass won by a single point. I am so happy. My bracket is not.
>> ARTICLE
At this point, I can't see much chance of No Game No Life not taking the whole series. If anyone was going to challenge its reign, it would be Madoka - not enough /r/anime users have seen Eva or whatnot for anything else to really put up a fight. I'm putting my money on "the newest show I loved is the best show ever."

At least for me, much of the appeal of NGNL is the "feel" that it gives that's so much like Code Geass, and CG is objectively much better.

It hasn't faced any of the 1 seeds yet. You really think Madoka would be a bigger challenge than FMA or Steins;Gate? No way. NGNL still has far to go.

I'm certain Madoka was a bigger hit than Steins;Gate. Probably less controversial, though you have a point with FMA and its potential staying power.

I think Steins;Gate is more engaging to most people than Madoka is and that's why it will tear down the NGNL terror reign!

The fact that NGNL beat Madoka is a bit ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed NGNL, but there's no way that it is better than Madoka. The hype is real. Also, I kinda hate you for forcing me to pick between Death Note and Pet Girl of Sakurasou. Death Note is going to win simply because it's more popular which I think decided the outcome of a lot of these shows, good shows lost just because they are underwatched and underhyped.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I enjoyed Madoka quite a bit, but I don't think it's that ridiculous that NGNL won out. NGNL and Madoka are so different from one another that one's preference for one genre over another factors in a lot. It would be like comparing Arrested Development to Game of Thrones. It's incredibly difficult to say one is "better" than the other. I do agree that this competition is basically a popularity contest though.
>> ARTICLE
Erm, personally, I preferred NGNL much over Madoka Magica. All in preference.
>> ARTICLE
I'm boycotting the rest of the tournament over the Madoka loss...and my absence will be very much noticed and will greatly sadden the /r/anime community. =P

Speaking seriously though, I think of this tournament as a popularity contest not unlike a prom king/queen vote in High School(btw is that still a big deal? It's been a decade since I was in High School :/). Usually it won't be the best person that wins the contest, but the most well-known and generally liked. [Please remember the golden rule](http://i.imgur.com/tSPcaXQ.gif)...this is just a simple vote by a group of people on the internet you don't even know. It's outcome does not and should not effect how you view your favorite anime. 

That said, if Monogatari, Bebop, or NGE doesn't win [I'm gonna lose my shit!](http://i.imgur.com/DzfSDtx.gif). =P
>> ARTICLE
It really seems to me that the golden rule that people on the Internet forget all the friggin' time is "Enjoyment (or Popularity) =/= Quality". 

I wonder whether that's because people lack critical thinking or because they aren't willing to accept that they like something that's flawed.

Yes, I'm disappointed that Madoka lost. The only way I can deal with this loss is to eat icecream while watching rebellion and try not to taste my own tears.
>> ARTICLE
I hardly think it's a popularity contest at all. Madoka is #34 in popularity while NGNL is still over #100. NGNL won because it was voted by the same people who gave it a higher average rating than Madoka. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, considering Monogatari and Bebop are up against each other already and NGE is losing against TTGL it looks rather grim
>> ARTICLE
As this tournament goes on there's less and less anime I give any shits about. ^My ^favorite ^was ^never ^nominated...

Which is that?

Blame the downvoters. The first two topics (nominations and day 1 voting) were downvoted into oblivion. I only got like 30 or 40 nominations.

True story.  I spent an (potentially) unhealthy amount of time on reddit.  I never saw the first two posts.

I'd recommend contacting the mods in the future (and/or starting a post on /r/MetaAnime).  There's free space in the header, and getting it stuck there might help a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I've always hated how downvote-happy this subreddit seems to be. Going on the second or third pages, I always get really sad for the clueless and innocent people asking questions or attempting to clarify information or sharing some fanart (although fanart's been getting more and more accepted, it seems) and then getting furiously downvoted for it. Some people just feel the need to be mean to others, I guess.

I mean, we're anime fans, after all. We're definitely used to a lot of people who identify with us or share our interests actually being annoying, embarrassing pieces of shit.
>> ARTICLE
> I always get really sad for the clueless and innocent people asking questions or attempting to clarify information or sharing some fanart (although fanart's been getting more and more accepted, it seems) and then getting furiously downvoted for it.

To be fair though, those people that ask questions/seek clarification are usually answered pretty quickly, making it unnecessary for their thread to be upvoted to the front page. Many users that frequent /r/anime(myself included) see that a question has been answered and then downvote the thread to make room for threads that are more new/relevant/interesting. Now the fanart's a whole another story. It's a big ole mixed bag that varies by post in both quality and how it's received by /r/anime.

EDIT: Just saw your username...why the hell have I been running into you everywhere for the past 24 hours?! :P

Well, gee, I never thought of it that way. That makes sense. But still, I mean, downvoting people might make then get the wrong idea, wouldn't just leaving the post neutral be enough to keep it down and away?

> ...why the hell have I been running into you everywhere for the past 24 hours?!

Bro, I don't even know. Just go with it.
>> ARTICLE
>downvoting people might make then get the wrong idea

Perhaps a bit...but I'd think if they're looking to get something answered, getting the actual answer is of far more importance to the person than the upvotes/downvotes on a self-post(which don't contribute to your link karma, just in case you didn't know).

Edit: Now the Monogatari series is beating Cowboy Bebop. Come to your senses anime community. 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, I'm not asking people to vote for the most artistic anime or the best written anime or even the plain best anime. Just whatever anime they happen to like better. I know I voted against objectively better anime a few times just because I like its opponent better for whatever reason. I for one really didn't like NGNL, but I can see why people might.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I was expecting to see something like FMA or Cowboy Bebop win, which is completely fine and understandable, even if I prefer things like NHK or Lain. I'm just really worried that NGNL is actually going to win, which would be terrible. Sure, it can be enjoyable, but at its core it is not a great anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Just out of curiosity, what would you consider to be a great anime? Of the 5 anime you listed (FMA, bebop, NHK, Lain, NGNL), I would personally rank NGNL 2nd after Cowboy Bebop and FMA last (imo, it's a generic shounen with just a bit of maturity sprinkled in). I usually dislike the harem genre, but it's been years since a comedy anime has made me laugh as much as NGNL has, so it's possible that I'm being a bit generous towards it

EDIT: downvotes for having a discussion, awesome.
>> ARTICLE
The characters are shallow and uninteresting and the plot is shallow and uninteresting. I don't find ecchi humor the least bit funny. Maybe I would understand it if I did. Have you even seen Welcome to the NHK? It provides a realistic depiction of a NEET in Satou, who I can say without a doubt is a much better character than Sora. I don't find ecchi humor the least bit funny, so the jokes of NHK were much better for me at least. Even the "fanservice" was done well in NHK. They depicted Satou's sexual fantasies, and then showed the guilt that stemmed from them, rather than throwing breasts in your face. I really just don't think the fanservice of NGNL is in any way appropriate for this kind of thing. If I wanted to see tits that badly I'd just go watch a hentai. 
>> ARTICLE
I have seen NHK and did enjoy it. I liked its believable characters and story and I was really impressed by how it had a realistic conclusion. It was one of the first anime I watched that didn't drown in the usual anime cliches so I do have a soft spot for it as well. 

If echi humor doesn't amuse you, I can see why NGNL was uninteresting for you. I usually dislike echi humor too, but I view NGNL as an affectionate parody of the echi/harem genre and it pushed the echi'ness to ridiculous extremes (The "censorship" in the word game with Jibril was the best implementation of echi humor I've seen in an anime). 

I'm not arguing that NGNL had an amazing deep plot or characters, but it was ridiculously fun to watch for me and many others. Much of the reason I enjoyed NGNL was due to its non-serious nature so I don't necessarily view its shallowness as a bad thing. A more serious and grounded plot would have ruined the atmosphere.
>> ARTICLE
I have a hard time calling something a parody when it becomes the perfect example of what it is trying to ridicule.
>> ARTICLE
It's not exactly uncommon. A whole bunch of shows on [this list (tv tropes  warning)](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AffectionateParody/AnimeAndManga) do exactly that. If you want to talk about why NGNL specifically would count as a parody, the word game with Jibril scene I mentioned beforehand satirizes the censorship methods echi anime use. The werebeast arc in particular was full of self aware parodying of multiple echi genres.
>> ARTICLE
> The werebeast arc in particular was full of self aware parodying of multiple echi genres.

It's not parody, it's more of the same.

Self-referential / Self-aware != parody.
>> ARTICLE
I fail to see the logic where giving you a worse version of something makes it better somehow. Like I said before, if I wanted this sort of thing that badly I would just go watch a hentai.  
>> ARTICLE
How is it exactly a worse version though? Just because you keep saying it's so doesn't make it so. Pretty much all of the fanservice in NGNL is a self aware parody of echi in anime, made more obvious by the ridiculous extremes it takes the fanservice to.

Examples:

1. The word game I keep mentioning. I don't see how that is a worse version of anything. If anything, it's the best version of satirizing arbitrary censorship of breast and genitalia.

2. Sora wants to take pictures of the girls bathing, but Shiro is genre savvy enough to take the the camera and take a picture of her arms strategically placed to look like boobs

3. Jibril's shampoo bottle. Obvious parody of tentacle hentai.

NGNL is definitely a parody of echi anime. It does exactly what a parody is supposed to do. It takes common ideas and cliches from the source genre and pushes them to ridiculous extremes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't see NGNL winning, but if it does I'm going to feel really bad for all of the excellent shows that lost (Lain, NHK, Bebop, FMA and alike) for a kind of fun fanservice-y mess to win.

NGNL just beat my favorite anime and crushed my hopes and dreams; so now I will vote for it in every round so everyone else's hopes and dreams are crushed as well.

It is pretty suspicious that the Madoka/NGNL match had more votes cast in it.  But if any show is going to cheat and break the rules to win a game, it should be NGNL :)

Well, so much for Sakurasou surviving Higurashi. Now it's getting the brutal ol' Death Note execution.

Ah, well, we had a good run, Sakurasou. You lasted longer than we all thought you were going to. Pat yourself on the back.

And good Christ, Madoka losing to something like No Game No Life is the last thing I'd expected to happen. I mean, actual opinions aside, how *did* it happen, logically? Pretty much nobody here wanted NGNL to win, including me, and yet it did. And I think we've all seen how intense the Madoka circlejerking can get in this neck o' the woods. Don't really know how that worked out. Damn lurkers. My God the power of hype is nothing to joke about.

Also, Psycho Pass getting that close to losing to SnK is definitely just a tad embarrassing.

**-- Speculation --**

**1.** Beloved series that served as a gateway anime for countless people including myself, versus an actually good shounen. While the two shows are certainly giants, Hunter X Hunter probably does not have the popularity and fanbase behind it to support it in this confrontation. Geass is going to win, and I'm sure that it's going to keep on winning for quite a while.
 
**2.** Another clash of the titans here. One is popular because it is beloved and had an amazing film sequel, the other because it helped to usher in the "cute girls doing cute things" phase. I'm putting my heart in for precious Haruhi-sama, and I expect the many other dedicated fans of this series to do the same. This spells the end for K-On!.

**3.** If Fate/Zero won against Naruto, I don't think it'd be that much of a stretch to see it win against One Piece ^see ^what ^I ^did ^there. Even though I'll be sad to see One Piece go, hell, that's just how good Fate/Zero was. The Urobutcher has One Piece at his mercy.

**4.** I really doubt that I need to go into much detail so to what Evangelion brings to the table. And, well, Gurren Lagann is still, even after all these years, pretty tender in all of our hearts. While both shows are undeniably extremely, extremely popular, they differ in that one is popular because of how well-liked it is, Lagann, and the other specifically because of how polarizing it is, Evangelion. And being famous for being polarizing doesn't help you too much in this sort of contest.

**5.** *Sigh*. If there's anything that's going to beat Death Note, it is most definitely not Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. I'm content, though, with how far it even made. This is an honorable and shameless defeat.

**6.** Two series that I hold very dear going against each other here. I think that Toradora! definitely has the edge in popularity/accessibility over Mushishi, though, and that that is what is going to give our favorite flat-chested tsundere the win here.

**7.** This here is a battle between two of the major things that anime is known for- feels, and visually intensive blood and gore. I'm putting my foot down and standing with my little buddy AnoHana here, and I'm not too nervous about us holding out, although I'm definitely not expecting Hellsing to go down without a fight.

**8.** Yep, this here is the match that I've been reinforcing the walls of my heart with steel for. My very favorite series versus one of my very first and beloved. An incredibly major handicap that Monogatari always suffers from in popularity contests like this is how it just isn't the show for everybody, and I think that is going to be the downfall of it today. Not everyone likes it, nor does everyone agree on what it is and where it stands. For how adored and loved by its fans it is (w00t), its shadow is teeming with enough critics to balance all this noise out. Bebop, on the other side of the ring, though... Well, who says they don't like Bebop? While it's gotten it's fair share of criticisms and indeed has its fair share of problems, the power of nostalgia is as formidable as, as aforementioned, hype. In a fair and honorable fight that will be sung of for generations to come, Bebop is going to walk away the victor.
>> ARTICLE
I actually agree with the idea that someone cheated and gave NGNL more votes. I just logically do not see it winning, even with hype.
>> ARTICLE
>Well, who says they don't like Bebop? 

My opinion usually matches the majority, but I don't like Bebop very much - and it bugs me to no end that I just can't see what other people worship about the show.

Visually I need not elaborate. Cowboy Bebop is old. [We had new standards years ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-bV6GOGbQI) and the bar [just keeps getting higher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j64JegzWf3c).

I really like Bebop's ED (The Real Folk Blues), but the rest of Bebop's soundtrack (including the OP) is very ...drunk. This is a problem I have with Yoko Kanno in general actually: what others see as 'fluid' and 'energetic', I see as 'messy' and 'uncoordinated'. It's not that I dislike all of her work though - Ghost in the Shell: SAC also had a soundtrack from Yoko Kanno and *that* was 'fluid' and 'energetic' for me, yet also calculated and coordinated in composition. Favorite tracks include: [Torukia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0ow4tGgZWk), [GET9](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqueqtgHeNU), [Run Rabbit Junk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l13RCQNUyI4), among others. In fact, I think The Real Folk Blues is probably more similar to GITS:SAC's soundtrack - which is why it's the exception for me in Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack.

Spike is supposed to be considered one of the greatest characters of all time, yet I really don't see what I'm supposed to love about him. Sure, he has some nice sleight-of-hand and evokes Bruce Lee - but am I supposed to think he's witty as well? Cool? Smart? Badass? Somewhat cute? He doesn't make me laugh like Araragi, nor does he blow my mind like Lelouch. At times he can be 'endearingly oblivious badass' like Yasuri Shichika but there are many other characters (including Yasuri Shichika) who I find much more enjoyable than Spike. 


There's more to nitpick but those are the main reasons I can't love Bebop. It may be a generational gap, but I really like Princess Mononoke and the Ghost in the Shell movie; both of which came out before Bebop. There's one other show in which I am similarly perplexed by the popular opinion (Steins;Gate - how is this better than Madoka, or even Baccano!?), but that's another story.


>> ARTICLE
My votes  
Code Geass vs **Hunter x Hunter** - didn't see Geass but HxH is my favourite shounen  
**Fate/Zero** vs One Piece - Fate/zero wins this easily for me. Have seen quite a bit of One Piece back in my younger years  
**Death Note** vs The Pet Girl of Sakurasou - didn't see Pet Girl of Sakurasou but Death Note is amongst my favourites  
**Monogatari Series** vs Cowboy Bebop - although I like Cowboy Bebop (haven't seen that much) I still enjoyed Monogatari more  
Everything else I couldn't really judge because I mostly didn't see any of them.
>> ARTICLE
You should certainly watch Code Geass. It's quite amazing.
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty high on my "to watch list", don't worry :P
>> ARTICLE
Wait, you didn't see half these shows? Neither have I, but I would think that proper etiquette would be to NOT vote unless you've seen both. That's what I've been doing since the beginning. As much as I would love to vote for AnoHana for example, I have not seen hellsing so it'll have to do without my vote this time around. 


I clearly have a very different approach to this contest than other people if this is the norm. I see this tournament as completely useless if we are just ranking the shows we have SEEN rather than the shows that we believe are of higher caliber. I mean what's the point of the former? If someone could lend me some insight please.... 
>> ARTICLE
If it was about what I have seen I couldn't vote at all. It's about popularity after all. If I haven't seen one of those it's just not popular in my own little universe (I have voted for things I didn't even see, but they are high on my "to watch" list, so for me they are more popular than others) :3 I think you kind of take this a bit too serious. It's not like anyone can win money with this, it's just some polls to have fun.  
That's my point of view and I can totally understand your opinion in your case but for me it's just different :)
>> ARTICLE
So you've voted for shows you haven't seen, because you think that the majority find it more popular? 

So, basically the question, to you, is not "which of these is your personal favourite", but rather, "please regurgitate the opinions of the hive mind. This is a test."

I can see why you'd think I may be taking this too seriously, but, the truth is I just don't understand the point of this whole thing if we go by your method. 

Sure, it's just a contest, but I think some valuable information could be gathered from it. Isn't that the point? 

For example: 

If something other than FMA:B or Steins;Gate wins, I'll be surprised, but it'd be super interesting! It might hint that perhaps those shows aren't the best shows ever like the majority seems to suggest, and that perhaps there is another show that people like better on an individual level. Who knows? I think that's interesting! But what's the point if people just vote for the shows they think will win rather than the shows they like?

Edit: 
"I wouldn't be able to vote"

Well, perhaps, maybe, you shouldn't? I hate to sound mean here :( but...
>> ARTICLE
> So you've voted for shows you haven't seen, because you think that the majority find it more popular?  

No. For example I voted for Haruhi in match 2 because I would more likely watch this than K-On!. So for me it is more popular. It's still a personal taste of popularity and I don't vote for something because other people think it's more popular. And if I wouldn't want to watch either of them I didn't vote at all (for example Ouran High School Host Club vs Yu Yu Hakusho).
>> ARTICLE
"I'm interested in it, So to me it is more popular". 

"My personal taste of popularity".

I don't think that's the definition of popular dude. What you mean is it's more "interesting" to you. But I think the point of the contest is to determine how much we like the shows, not how much we like the premise or the cover art. 

I don't understand the point of the poll if we use your strategy. It's kind of detrimental to the results.  

What I mean to say is, having the information "this guy likes haruhi better  than K-on" is useful, but having the information "this guy thinks haruhi looks better than k-on" isn't really as useful. 
I mean, how many people thought Madoka Magica looked super badass and cool before watching it? Exactly 
>> ARTICLE
Well you maybe have a point here, but I will continue to vote because this is just fun for me. I accept your opinion but it won't change my behavior because of it. The whole thing is flawed because you could just vote over and over for the same thing until it wins and then there goes your analysis about it. Can't be sure if anyone isn't doing it. So bare with me.
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting to me that everyone is so upset about NGNL beating out Madoka "because of the hype". Madoka is also crazy hyped about.  It's not like it trounced it. They were pretty damn close. 
>> ARTICLE
The point is Madoka is a modern classic whereas NGNL is, whether or not you like it, essentially the flavour of the month right now. In a year's time, Madoka will still make top 64 anime lists, but NGNL will likely be replaced by something new, or an old classic will regain its place.

Match 2. Even though I am upset GTO lost to it, I have to vote for Haruhi. Even though I voted against it, I still think it is a fantastic show that was a lot of fun to watch. 

Match 3. Probably the hardest one yet, since I love both shows, but I had to go for Fate/zero in the end, because it had a consistent plot, and actually does end.

Match 5. Got to go with Death note on this one. I really enjoyed the twists and turns of death note, along with the ending. The cat girl show really didn't give me anything as interesting as Death note did.

Match 8. While I will admit Monogatori was great, Cowboy Bebop just had so much I wanted out of a show (mostly based on the atmosphere and stories), that it easily gets my vote.

"cat girl show"



really?
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, that's not very distinctive when it comes to anime. How about Sakurasou pet girl show
>> ARTICLE
No my point is there is literally no cat girls in the entire show. Should watch both shows before making statements on which is better.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, it was more of me looking at the poster for the show again on MAL, and swapping out the pet for cat, than trying to say it had anything to do with cat girls. I didn't mean to say it was about cat girls, I just wanted to abbreviate the title down tremendously (for some reason), but it looks like I did it in a poor/confusing way, and I am sorry that it caused confusion, and also that looking at it again, it looks demeaning (which was not my intention and I am sorry that I made it seem that way). I did watch both shows, otherwise I wouldn't have voted at all, like with the rest of the numbers that were not listed. I don't like Death note enough to defend it against an opponent I have not seen.

Oh, fair enough then. And yeah, the way you put it made it sound like it was a trashy show, and as a fan of Sakurasou I felt obligated to defend it.

While I'm sad to see Durarara! and Shin Sekai Yori go I didn't really expect them to win, very happy to see psycho pass move on though, it is one of my favorite new series. While I hope Baccano! keeps going I don't see it beating Steins;Gate.

Match 1. Code Geass is my second favorite anime of all time and my first true series, while I love HxH, and trust me I do, I have to side with Lelouch on this one.

Match 3. One Piece is okay but in the end it's just your typical battle Shounen, Fate/Zero definitely has this one.

Match 4. I really hope NGE can pull through this, but I don't think it is seeing how much everybody loves TTGL.

Match 5. I watched Death Note along with Geass as I was first getting into anime so it holds a special place in my heart. P.S. screw you Light.

Match 6. Just recently got into Mushishi recently and I'm loving it, though I'm unsure how well it will stack up against Toradora, everyone's favorite romantic comedy.

Match 8. Cowboy Bebop is a classic and one of my all time favorites, however, the Monogatari Series clicked with me so well that that I have to give it my vote. Whether it can eek out a victory over Bebop remains to be seen.

I haven't seen either series in matches 2 and 7 so I'll refrain from voting on those.

On a side note my soul is still crushed that my number one anime of all time, Gintama, lost in the first round to Naruto.

>Code Geass vs Hunter x Hunter

This one might be close. People keep raving about Hunter x Hunter but Code Grass has been a favorite for many for a while now. I'm not sure about this one.

>Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya vs K-On!

This one will be close but I think Haruhi will take it in the end.

>Fate/Zero vs One Piece

Fate/Zero is great but I find that One Piece is much more enjoyable and it has a huge fan base so I think that One Piece will win but not by much.

>Neon Genesis Evangelion vs Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

My favorite series vs one of my most hated series. I hate to say it but TTGL seems to be way more popular so I think it will win this round.

>Death Note vs The Pet Girl of Sakurasou

I think Sakurasou will win this one. People love their feels and I think people's complaints about Death Note's second half will affect this round.

>Mushishi vs Toradora!

I've never seen Mushishi but I voted for it because I can't stand Toradora! but sadly, Toradora! will be the victor.

>Hellsing/Hellsing Ultimate vs AnoHana

I love Hellsing but I don't see it winning against AnoHana.

>Monogatari Series vs Cowboy Bebop

Personally, I didn't enjoy either show, so I didn't vote for either, but people seem to love Monogatari so I think it will be the winner.

Also, I find it both hilarious and satisfying that Madoka Magica lost No Game No Life.

It isn't one of my top favourites, but it is definitely up there.

[I believe my only criticism with AnoHana is -not really a spoiler but just incase-](/s "the characters acted somewhat unbelievably sometimes (mostly in the past).")

Definitely an anime worth watching if you have an interest in drama!
>> ARTICLE
Anohana introduced me to Galileo Galilei, a Japanese indie(?) rock band.

I've fallen in love with them ever since. Give them a listen.
>> ARTICLE
This was my first drama ever and is still one of my favorites. 

(I fucking called it. /r/anime going hard with the super feels WT!s... WA2, Kimiuso, Anohana, now just time to complete it with Nagi no Asukara or some shit.)
>> ARTICLE
Didn't really like NnA but how about Clannad: After Story :D
>> ARTICLE
haven't watched it. I'm really turned off by the artstyle. :/ 

say what you'd like, but artstyle really affects what I watch and enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
Well it definitely is worth a watch but I can understand why you don't like the art-style. It is really bright and colourful and really really moe.  

Just thought I drop the name as you were talking about super feels and Clannad: After Story is arguably the saddest anime, that made the most people cry.

I know how art-style affects people... I haven't watched Code Geass as I didn't like the cover and the character design. Same goes for Nana. But at some point I thought fuck it give them a try and now both are among my favourites :)
>> ARTICLE
I've heard the legends of how sad Clannad AS is. It's definitely tempting to watch regardless. 

But don't get me wrong, I really like moe too. I'm a huge KyoAni fan. But it's just their old stuff that isn't quite as aesthetically pleasing.

Haven't watched CG or Nana either. :/ 
>> ARTICLE
Do you consider Clannad + After Story as old stuff? I mean 2007 and 2008 really isn't that old is it? I personally think they aged pretty well but that is just my personal opinion I guess..  
It definitely looks way better than Air (2005) and Kanon (2006) at least.  

Nana and Code Geass both are really worth a watch and also both have their own sad moments too.
>> ARTICLE
No, I consider "old" to be like pre-2006. It's just that KyoAni's newer stuff is just that much better imo. 

Code geass I dont think I'll be watching anytime soon, but Nana is definitely on my PTW.

> People often say Jinta is stupid because he does (or doesn't do) things they would have done in his situation, as those things are the obvious things to do (in their opinion)

If you are talking about [](/s "Jinta being not able for several episodes to prove to others that Menma is real") - yes, this is good example of [Idiot Ball](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall). Not "in viewers opinion" - no backstory justifies Jinta's stupidity here.

It doesn't matter however - the anime is about emotions, so it succeeds or fails (depending on the viewer) somewhere else.
>> ARTICLE
Yep that was what I was referring to. Well I had a heated conversation about this topic a while ago so I'm just gonna copy and paste what I responded to that guy:  

[major spoilers](/s "So you are Jintan, a guy who is kinda depressed as your first love and one of your best friends died 5 years ago. Also you don't have your other friends anymore to cheer you up as your little group of friends fell apart. Oh your mother died too btw. Additionally you don't go to school and your father doesn't seem to care.
Now that girl who died appears in front of you as an older version of herself and says she wants a wish granted and you need the other guys around to fulfil it. So you would be like 'Oh I'm gonna walk up to those guys I've barely seen for the 5 last years and try to prove that this ghost here is real, although even I don't know if it actually is real!' What could possibly go wrong?
The first few episodes are supposed to introduce the cast and to make Jintan understand that the Menma he sees IS real. But still you have this ghost of your dead childhood friend with you. Even if you try to prove her existence to other people they would totally think your nuts. So he obviously doesn't really wanna tell or prove anything but rather try to help that ghost out without making the other guys think he is insane.
So Menma kinda does try to reveal herself but obviously she is kinda stupid. I mean she talks to and shouts at the other guys and hugs them but she isn't bright enough to e. g. carry something in front of the other guys to make them see shit float in mid-air. Especially as she can see herself and it isn't as obvious for her as it is for us, the viewers, that her carrying stuff creates the impression shit is levitating.")  

[And furthermore I said:](/s "To me it appears that you watched this anime but you didn't really try to understand or relate to the cast especially Jintan. You seem to just see the obvious things you notice as viewer and then immediately want stuff to happen but you don't see where those characters are coming from. You just sit in a chair and call a teenage character, who has lost his best friend/love and his mother within a short period of time and shortly after lost all of his friends, stupid as he cannot handle a freaking supernatural event, a ghost that looks like his dead friend and makes him question his own sanity, to your pace and liking.")

In the second part I used a lot of brackets which I couldn't use now as that would have ruined the spoiler box. The text doesn't necessarily apply to you too but displays my attitude to that topic :)
>> ARTICLE
you were already answered but I want only to point out that what you wrote here:

[](/s "Even if you try to prove her existence to other people they would totally think your nuts. So he obviously doesn't really wannta tell or prove anything but rather try to help that ghost without making the others guys think he is insane")

is a major contradiction in light of the fact Jintan contacts the other precisely about Menma.

And additionally your first assumption is wrong - that people would think you are nuts if you **proved** the existence of Menma. No they wouldn't. The very idea of the **proof** is that if you proved X, people you proved it to would believe it.
>> ARTICLE
I am not wrong at all. They would think you're nuts if you try to prove it until you manage to prove it. No what is the worst case scenario? He tries to prove it but he fails to prove it so the only thing he proved to them is that he *is* nuts. Imo Jinta had that in the back of his head.

Still I do get your point. I think you can argue about those points forever. Imho it is just a matter of interpretation. Especially as Jinta has not much monologue to explain what he is thinking. Some people like you say he is stupid, some people like me say he is confused and doesn't really know what to do so he goes step by step in many directions and I'm pretty sure there are other people with other opinions on him. And I think that it is awesome there are so many things to argue about!
>> ARTICLE
? wait a moment. Your logic is fuzzy here. You accept, I hope, the following:

1. If Jinta doesn't successfully  prove it others will think he is nuts

2. If Jinta does successfully prove it others **won't** think he is nuts

3. If Jinta doesn't try to prove anything, others will think he is nuts

And you are telling me the rational option is not try to prove anything? *Are you nuts?*
>> ARTICLE
Furthermore, why would two of his friends gather around to play Pokeman all night without even verifying her existence?
>> ARTICLE
Hehe :)
Did I say Jinta's decision it was the right or rational option?
You are right with what you say. The **rational** option would be the second option. But what I'm trying to explain is that he wasn't able to make a **rational** decision due to his mental state caused by his childhood trauma and his ghost problem.

Also to me it sounds like you want a main character that is a flawless robot just doing the right things and making rational decisions. Aren't the mistakes and emotions the things that makes characters human? 
>> ARTICLE
Well, mistakes and emotions are perfectly fine. However - that's ofc a matter of personal preference but I don't find idiocy of the protagonists an interesting flaw. Particularly when it fuels the plot. And I don't accept it, no matter how emotional the protagonists are. Either you are an idiot or you aren't, emotional state generally doesn't affect that much - "mental state" and "ghost problem" are just lame excuses. And in my private opinion they don't justify stupidity. If you are a moron character, then you are unpleasant to watch. 

Still I think I understand you, and all the above wasn't even the real issue I had with anime. Just wanted to point out that for some people Jinta (and his friends) are inexcusable idiots and your sentimental explanations aren't able to change that impression.
>> ARTICLE
Well if you don't think the emotional state of a person affects his ability to make proper rational decisions it is your opinion. I guess I could scientifically prove you wrong but I'm too lazy.  

But I rather not listen to you calling my opinion lame excuses. The mental state does justify stupid decisions in my private opinion. If you find him unpleasant to watch just don't watch AnoHana again.

I'm not even trying to change your impression with my 'sentimental explanations'. It is totally ok for me if you don't like it for whatever reasons.  

But I made this WT! as I want to motivate people to give it a try and build their own opinion and not to deal with people that just come here to talk it down with there subjective opinions. So that is it from me. Have a nice day sir!

[Spoilers] (/s " Except he stilled told his friends about Menma. If he didn't want to seem crazy like you said, he wouldn't even mention Menma since it's obvious they can't see her. It is still a big logical leap to assume that he would consistently bring it up, yet never try to prove it. Also, it's not like menma and his mom died recently, it was a while ago. His friends didn't leave him, they just drifted apart in the YEARS since menma died. In regards to Menma, even if she couldn't hold stuff up, she still showed that she could write. Plus, if stuff started levitating around me I'd definitely believe that there's a ghost, so it's still pretty ridiculous that that wouldn't work.")

Well the thing is [spoilers](/s "he has to tell them as the only thing Menma remembers about her wish is that the friends all need to be together to fulfil it. How is he supposed to approach them after all those years? He uses the last thing that connects them -> Menma.")  

[Also](/s "just because they died years ago doesn't necessarily mean he is over it or something. Even in real life people sometimes cannot get over things and rather do drugs or become alcoholics or become depressive loners like Jinta.  
Yea she could write but if you would have paid close attention she can just write in hear own diary. That was revealed pretty late if I remember correctly.  
Also Jinta and Menma both can see her so for them there is no shit levitating as for those two it just looks like she is carrying it.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers] (/s "Well if he wanted his friends help with fulfilling her wish, then it would have been a lot easier to just prove to them menma existed. Sure, Jinta can see menma carrying stuff, but since the others can't see menma, it can be inferred that they would see them levitating. Since menma's wish involved her friends, it would have been easier to just prove her existence and have everyone on board to fulfill her wish.")

Had seen this about 6 months ago now. This was one of the most saddest anime I have ever seen (Clannad tops that list). The story was really beautiful. I did shed a tear or two in the end. The sadder part is that I had lost one of my cousins in a similar way. I had just started Secondary schooling then. It brought back those sad memories. :'(

The characters and their developments and struggles are the main focus of the show and the show handles that perfectly.

I like Anohana. It's got some continuity errors that annoy me, but other than that, it's a great series. Probably one of my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Which are the continuity errors that you mention? I watched the show 3 years ago and can't really recall them.
>> ARTICLE
The show implies that Menma is invisible, not intangible. She can interact with objects, like when she serves the biscuit thingy to the friends, and when she knocks over a cup or something at her family's house. However, there are scenes when other characters don't notice Menma interacting with an object. There's one where Jintan's father walks in Jintan's room, and doesn't notice Menma sleeping on Jintan's bed. She is under a blanket, so from his prospective, he should be seeing a floating blanket on Jintans bed. He doesn't, though. There's also a scene where the friends are walking through a forest. Menma is with them, so someone should have noticed her footprints, or the sound of her walking. Little things like that are scattered throughtout the series. It annoys me.
>> ARTICLE
You do realize there are plenty of people that don't notice actual other people on the street with them...
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, it is a poltergeist effect. The show seems to imply Menma can only use her ability to touch and manipulate  objects  in front of people she is the most emotionally close to. Honestly that makes sense why Jinta has such a tough time explaining it. Also, maybe Jinta's dad does know but keeps it to himself. He doesn't  seem to be the type of person to make a huge deal out of it and he is a very understanding  person. But yeah, I  do wish at least Jinta's dad acknowledged it. Though some viewers are theorizing he is just playing dumb for Jinta's sake.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but that's just a fan theory. It's not even a solid fan theory, it's wishful thinking at best.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how that is 'wishful thinking'. It's more tragic than anything. Also it was specifically mentioned by the creators that Jinta's emotions are fueling her powers as poltergeist.
>> ARTICLE
Just a thought, I don't particularly like when recommendations use hyperbole to convince people to watch. Not because it isn't true, but because it tends to make people not watch the series openly to enjoy it. You tell people they will cry and they're going to brace themselves when the time comes. 

I enjoyed Anohana. It's a sweet story with a relatable cast and it allowed me to reminisce of my own childhood a little bit.
>> ARTICLE
But it's also difficult to skirt the line of telling too much, and misrepresenting.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed the show when I watched it, but after a while I took a step back and put away my personal feelings for the show, and tried to judge it unbiased.

Ultimately it came down to **"ARE YOU FUCKING CRYING YET?"** the anime. 

They force every interaction while staying in the realm of reality. And then force you to feel.

Still enjoyed the series a lot, but I definitely don't praise it like I used to.


>> ARTICLE
Pretty much Nagi no Asukara in a nutshell
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, it IS only 11 episodes.

Very difficult to get much accomplished in 11 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really understand the "ARE YOU CRYING YET" critic to Anohana.

AnoHana is a drama. It's objective is naturally to **make you cry**. For me, it did. How can that be a con? The anime set an objective, which at least for me would be hard to accomplish, and fulfills it. 

By that logic you could say Nichijou is bad because it keeps asking "Are you laughing yet" or K-ON for "Are you feeling good yet?".
>> ARTICLE
The interactions and situations are forced and feel unnatural.

Honestly they had to keep it to 11 episodes, and get a lot accomplished in those episodes, which is why it does this.

The difference between Anohana and Nichijou/K-ON is that Anohana is on a whole nother level, in terms of forcing. Nichijou is just more natural.

---------------------------------

Lets say a goal of a drama is *"are you feeling something yet?"*.

while Anohana steps it up into **"ARE YOU FUCKING CRYING YET?"**.

---------------------------------

Anohana is just on another level. And it's hard to tell if it's good or bad at what it does. I think they did a great job, but someone else might see it as them forcing *really* hard to make you feel something. 
>> ARTICLE
This is pretty similar to my opinion on it. I felt like the purpose was primarily to make the viewer sad rather than to tell a compelling story with good characters and it ended up not being as good as it could have been. I thought it was pretty alright while watching it but the more I think about it the less I like it.

>Melodrama

>Masterpiece

[](#facepalm)
>> ARTICLE
Heh, it does sound weird but then again, I don't see what's so wrong about shows that goes for strong emotions. I guess we are kind of conditioned to think only subtle drama can be a 'masterpiece' while anything that goes for something more overt can't be praised. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying melodrama is "bad" per se, I just wouldn't consider it a masterpiece personally.  After all, it's a lot more difficult to write a story that subtly makes you feel or connect with a character, than if you just shove sad things in the viewers face.  A good work of any kind of fiction, anime or not anime, shouldn't make it so "obvious" that it's manipulating your emotions.  A masterpiece is defined as "a work of outstanding artistry, skill, or workmanship.".  I would argue that something that has no nuances, and just blatantly tries to make you feel sad is not considered a masterpiece.  Just my two cents.
>> ARTICLE
Well, that's why I think 'masterpiece of melodrama' could make sense. It's something that is still noteworthy as far as overt dramas go. But of course, it doesn't have that kind of subtlety as some other types of masterful dramas. But on the same token, I do think people are kind of overlooking some of the subtlety in Anohana as well. I'm not in disagreement with you that making something purely subtle definitely takes a lot of talent as well. Just that I'm not sure a story like Anohana is really going for that, other than the mystery of Menma's wish and how she passed. It really was more about the current day emotional pain of the friends who has remained.

Let's also consider that even in Shakespeare's heyday, he was criticized as a melodramatic story writer/producer. I get that sometimes drama can be a bit up front. But I don't think it's automatically a strike against it. And I think more subtle shows do a better job of 'manipulating' emotions as it's something that is supposed to be more sly. If something is up front, I am not sure how 'manipulative' it is as it's not very deceptive. Maybe they can get a tad heavy or convenient with dramatic turns though. Then again, I don't see how it's all that unique to fiction. Especially in a story featuring a ghost. Of course it's bound to have some elements of plot device featuring Menma in a really overt way at times. I can see why it may irk some viewers, make no mistake. But I'm not so sure it is fair people are slamming it as somehow objectively broken.
>> ARTICLE
> Well, that's why I think 'masterpiece of melodrama' could make sense. It's something that is still noteworthy as far as overt dramas go. But of course, it doesn't have that kind of subtlety as some other types of masterful dramas.

Ah, I think I might've misinterpreted the title then.  I thought OP meant that Anohana is a masterpiece among all anime, instead of just among melodramatic anime.  

>But on the same token, I do think people are kind of overlooking some of the subtlety in Anohana as well. 

It's been a while since I've watched Anohana, would you care to explain some of the subtleties in Anohana?

>If something is up front, I am not sure how 'manipulative' it is as it's not very deceptive.

Yes, and that's my main annoyance with melodramatic shows.  It takes away from my personal enjoyment, as I know that they're trying to make me connect with a character/feel pity for a character.  It's quite the contrary for me once I realize that.

>Maybe they can get a tad heavy or convenient with dramatic turns though. Then again, I don't see how it's all that unique to fiction. Especially in a story featuring a ghost. Of course it's bound to have some elements of plot device featuring Menma in a really overt way at times. 

That, along with my misinterpretation of OP's title is what led to my first comment.  I just don't think an anime with flaws as noticeable as that should be called a masterpiece.  

>But I'm not so sure it is fair people are slamming it as somehow objectively broken.

I kind of agree with this.  It's basically impossible to view an anime objectively, so I agree with you on that.  At the same time, I agree with other people when they say that there are inconsistencies with the writing in Anohana.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I didn't mean to go off on you there. I think there's a definitely a difference in praising melodrama in its own arena rather than comparing it to everything out there. As far as subtle drama goes, I absolutely agree that they do take more skill to craft overall. But at the same time, I don't think it needs to come to a point where 'melodrama' is uttered like some slur in drama. 

Speaking of subtle elements in Anohana, I think Poppo definitely is way up there. Yeah, he's a boisterous, big/fat sparkplug of the group. But the way he takes care of Jinta and slowly comes to a realization that Jinta wasn't bluffing was really heartbreaking to see. And that happens through at least 10 episodes of the show. As for Tsuruko, she usually doesn't vocalize her feelings but instead supports the rest of the Busters through quiet and even deceptive ways at times. Sure, the big reveal with Menma definitely is really big and over the top. But I feel the way the Busters dealt with their emotions was very well done all season.

Yeah, I can see why a show being too blunt can be a tad much. I mean, for one of my favorite anime dramas ever in ef and Kanon, they literally have car crash accidents out of the blue. It is about as blunt as dramas can get. Especially with freak accidents that seriously wound or kill a major character. At least with Anohana, all of it still was centered around the ghost premise that was built up for 10+ episodes. As crazy as that premise is, there was a proper build to it.

Speaking of masterpiece status, I can definitely see why the story faults and overtness may get in the way of that status for many. That's definitely legitimate and I can respect that. Though I think the show did many things right, such as audio direction, excellent animation fidelity, putting emotions on screen with cinematography, stuff like that. And while some of the drama does come out swinging, I still thought it was well done. I guess a recent example would be like Your Lie in April which is about as subtle as a boxing match, but the emotions still hits like a truck. And the cinematography, voice acting, the subtleness of the drama in the leadup to it all really helps that, I feel. Again, I understand and respect your opinion on it. Though I am more in the camp of acknowledging the show as a really good (if flawed) drama. And I can definitely stand behind it being considered a masterpiece at least in its own brand/style of drama. Not to mention, people are still too hung up over the Memna thing I feel. When the way the rest of the characters grew was just fantastically done and I could champion that all the way. 

But yeah. I wouldn't say everyone has to acknowledge it as a masterpiece. Whether one takes to the show really depends on individual taste. I can definitely agree the show can have divisive elements as to its storytelling and consistency of Menma as a poltergeist.


>> ARTICLE
I absolutely love Anohana. In fact, it's my favorite show in any medium. The characters are relatable and grow on you as the show goes on. It's a really sweet and nostalgic story that pulled on my heartstrings.

It does have some problems though. Some of the characters aren't fleshed out that much, but you can't blame them, it's hard to flesh out everyone in 11 episodes. Another problem was that it was a bit melodramatic at times, but it was all meant to enhance the characters. That being said, its really great and I recommend it 100%.

> Melodrama Masterpiece

There is no way this anime can be considered a melodrama masterpiece. The characters aren't interesting at all, and they act very unrealistically. The melodrama is forced and unnatural. Can it make you feel sad? Yes, but calling it a masterpiece is unwarranted.

edit: Downvoting me for saying this anime isn't a masterpiece only further proves you're an irrational fanboy. Not that I care.

You might not know what the world "unrealistically" means then, because the characters are the most realistic in any drama I've watched.

[personal anecdote that spoils](/s "A childhood friend I had passed away when I was 20.  We grew apart because his dad got re-stationed to Italy in high school.  We were both Navy brats but I went off to college, he joined the military.  I ended up doing the college thing running organizations and thinking I was going to help people in my own way.  A couple days before my birthday his brother two years younger than us died in a car accident and he returned from Iraq to bury his brother.  His mom would call me telling me to email him and gave me his address.  I was always rationalizing how busy I was to shoot him a damn one line email asking how we was doing.  6 months later an IED hits his convoy and he dies.  Now I didn't go cross dressing or anything, but it's been 10 years since he passed away and not emailing my friend is the one thing I regret in my life.")

I for one appreciate the characters and feel people deal with the situation in different ways.  I personally connected with what they were going through.

Disclaimer: I didn't downvote you. Your opinion is appreciated, regardless of whether or not it coincides with mine.

With that said, I have to respectfully disagree. I thought all of the characters were interesting in their own way, except for maybe the blonde character who had a crush on the MC. They all brought something different to the table, which made the show very enjoyable to watch (for me at least).

As for behaving unrealistically, I think that's incredibly subjective. Your unrealistic may be my reality. So, if their behavior was unrealistic for you, then I understand why you didn't like this anime as much. As for me, the characters' actions were well within the realm of possibility, so I very much enjoyed it.

I'm also super critical of myself and rewrote parts again and again, and after all of that, I could have become numb to the nuances that I was destroying.

It'll probably undergo changes every 15 minutes as I reread it and change it more. I know my last WT! wasn't done being modified until like 6 hours after I posted it.

I would have just fleshed it out a bit more. This one is a good example:

Go into some negatives of the show or maybe some themes the story explores.

You're going to bring up Gundam Unicorn, but not one of it's more beloved tracks? Angelo is a good piece, but I always liked this one better.

* [Mobile Suit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwktIkvRBI8) - Easily one of the more memorable pieces especially after that grunt fight in the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! :)
>> ARTICLE
Glad you mentioned Build Fighters, it really doesn't get enough credit. It sounds and looks absolutely amazing, probably the best animation I've seen for a TV series.

Though I'm a bit disappointed that you left out Gunbuster! Maybe it's just me, but the music is such a massive part of why Gunbuster is my favourite (along with all the other amazing stuff in it). I know Gunbuster is your favourite too so I was hoping you'd mention it.

[I went ahead and put it in anyway.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3r952l/help_me_create_the_ultimate_ost_list/cwm6o6e)

I actually haven't gotten the chance to go and listen to the Gunbuster  soundtrack yet (though I do have Gunbuster M-20 on my playlist which is the Gunbuster entrance). But yeah, the Gunbuster OST is absolutely fantastic as well.

Most of your songs are openings/endings, so include singing and have been noted for my collection of them. Your selection of OST's has been noted, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Ok - I'll fish some non OP/ED OST out of the playlist as well - you seem to imply those are missing -  I just took whatever I liked the most the first time around ;)

sorry if I replicate some of the first one's, I'll try to make sure I don't!

I'll clean it up a little better than the last one, too.

Order of tracks is in no particular order.

**Giant Robo The Animation:**

An absolutely amazing combination of both opera and orchestra pieces. All tracks are done with an orchestra, as far as I know. It's an absolute crime that this anime isn't more well known!

1. [L'esiler D'Amore - Una Furtiva Lagrima ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3uij4CF9H8)

2. [Cataclysm Over Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPlQiOJFpyg)

3. [Rush! Issei & Yohshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG_0fak-7y4)

3. [Arrival of Giant Robo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnr2-l4j2-k)

4. [Historys' Greatest Decisive Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juWAvmuefyE)

**Gunbuster:**

You can't really explain how amazing Gunbuster's OST is without actually watching the series. It's just too perfect. Some incredibly moving and somber tracks combined with HOT-BLOODED ACTION!!! If you haven't seen this, you should. It's only six episodes.

2. [Noriko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P_hYYoB3fw)

1. [Fly High!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEEPosF-tNU)

3. [Toki no Kawa wo Koete...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o33Rv2Z-4iI)

Also both soundtracks for Zetsuen no Tempest is great. All orchestral stuff, no vocals that I recall.

These threads were awesome! Thank you very much, /u/kaverik for all your patience and good luck in the immense world of Anime :)

I got an excuse to hype some of my favourite shows, so I enjoyed these threads :D

These threads were awesome /u/kaverik, thanks for all the hard work!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the kind words! Means a lot to me. Actually would be great to do something similar in the future, but with a different approach (discuss not the shows itself, but some tropes/anime production/other related-anime stuff). Ideas are always appreciated. 
>> ARTICLE
I appreciate it too, I've missed a lot of them due to time zones and they didn't reach front page, but I'll make a point of going back and adding any shows that didn't quite make it.

This thread should go into the sidebar for future reference.
>> ARTICLE
I liked these threads. Because the alphabetical criterion was pretty arbitrary, they allowed for a measure of serendipity, which is a rare and valuable thing now that we can search and find things instantly without bumping into other stuff on a physical shelf. (Which is, obviously, an overall improvement; I'm just saying chance discovery's valuable too.)
>> ARTICLE
While it wasn't the focus, it was an important aspect to get lesser known anime into the "spotlight" or at least some sort of discussion going about them, and well, ofcourse we talked about the same anime as always. I mean, look at the list right above us. There are only a few anime I have never heard about, only a handful.

Nothing new, nothing unheard of, nothing lesser known. I know it's in the nature of reddit itself that results like this happen, but I am still disappointed. Maybe it's because I like a few lesser known anime and desperately try to recommend them whenever I can and I didn't get much attention, probably.
>> ARTICLE
I also wished I would find more hidden gems when reading through these threads, but it is the nature of a hidden gem to shine bright despite being covered in obscurity.

At least Inferno Cop won I.
>> ARTICLE
Well, out of these 74 anime mentioned in my little chart I've seen 49 and have heard of 65. This series of topics was more for people who are less expereinced in the world of anime than we are. Sure, I also thought (and not once) that hyped/famous shows hit top comment spots, but there is really nothing could be done about it. I encouraged people to post anime they want to discuss/recommend, but many times threads were left only with my initial posts.

Currently thinking about next more "in-depth" series of discussions, but I'm also not sure will they hit front page if the topics would be *too in-depth*.
>> ARTICLE
why no one piece?

Because [One Piece](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21/One_Piece) is technically an ongoing show, and we decided not to include them in our threads.

as someone who can't really see it, but a huge fan of it, what new content was added? and what's the epilogue like for each character? don't care about spoilers
>> ARTICLE
The group all write letters to Menma.  During the process each character reveals a little bit more of their childhood interactions with Menma.  They kinda reiterated Menma's wish as being Jintan's mother's wish to make him cry/show emotion.The added bit at the end is a pit which they throw the letters in to burn.  They play hide n seek to remember Menma and then say that they should see each other every year, as Menma would have liked that.  They added a carved bit on the secret base wood.  Where it says, "super peace busters" - Menma wrote down a message they seemed to miss, which was..."super peace busters - will be friends forever"The credits roll and Menma comes back on screen to monologue, "I wonder what I'll be reincarnated as?"  She thinks of butterflies and potatoes among a few other things.I saw the Q&A in which I will be brief.  The producer was there to answer a few questions.  He was a bit blunt with some and humorous with others.  (Its also was taped!  So be ready for a video later)What was the significance of Jintan's shirt selection?A: We didn't have much in the way of merchandise so the variety of shirts became a focus.  They are really nice shirts.What scenes were cut from the movie? How long was development?A:  we argued back and forth for three years when making the film.  A lot of scenes were not able to be put in. (Anaru(on my phone, can't google) confessing her love to Jintan was cut).  However it seems like we just reused the same animation cells - we actually redrew everything.Will we see more?A: I will be thinking of all of your faces when we start the next project.Why a movie?A: After we finished the series we wanted to be able to continue Ano Hana for the fans.(I'm paraphrasing most everything that was heard from the translator)If you have any more specific questions I will do my best to answer)
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was really well done.  I was conflicted for a while, but I've decided that I'm happy with how they did the ending.  They didn't just drop the 'everyone is happy and perfect and in love with each other'.  

They stuck with the ending I liked from the series, but expanded on it.  Everything isn't perfect, but Menma's return managed to start bringing everybody back together.  Given time, everybody will heal (at least a bit), and they've all got hope and something to live for.

Also, I can't help but lose my head every time they start to read the Letters from Menma.  It's a very rare thing to find me crying like a little girl in public, but here we are.  And I'm going back for more tomorrow, to get the producer q&a (and this time I'll be showing up stupidly early to find myself a spot the front of the line).
>> ARTICLE
I loved the individual attention to each character and how they have developed after one year. Seeing scenes from the show was tear inducing. It really had a sense of realism to it. Not everyone was healed, but you could tell that each character had developed a way to come to terms with their emotions, and finally found a way to became the Super Peace Busters again.

In addition to the essential tear jerking moments of the movie, there were quite a few hilarious parts that the crowd laughed at, especially Anaru's tsundere antics and Poppo's overall sillyness.

Overall I was satisfied with this movie. I've never been to an anime movie screening so this was a neat first time experience. I went to the SF screening at 1:00 pm; kudos to the guy who kept saying "Anaru is best girl" through out the movie :P
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen it. All I have to say is...you lucky lucky bastards...
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was really well done! Good recap and good story frame for it. It gave a lot more closure on the series's ending and reminded me why I loved this anime so goddamned much.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone in that theatre left with tear lines in their faces. I did not see the series, but tok my potential-gf as a date since she loves anohana. Needless to say, I tried so hard to not completely break down, especially when jintan's letter from menma was on screen. It was a very good movie. :)

>> ARTICLE
I really enjoy hearing nishino kana's aitakute aitakute being sang by Anjou while she looks at Jintan and blush while singng the I love you part of the song (can't remember exact lyrics)
>> ARTICLE
Just watched it, the plot is perfect, combining the past and the present., but it can be better if the at ending the girls asked the boys out :) ! I give it 8.5 
>> ARTICLE
Damn it....I shoulda known I was gonna cry like a little girl.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't care about this enough as I did with Rebellion to go out and see it. I felt that for AnoHana, it was the type of show that you have a great time watching, but after its done you're just like "okay that's over, time to move on" and you just forget/stop caring about it. 

So what I want to know is, was there enough new content in this to warrant watching it?
>> ARTICLE
I would say so, but I think it's very open to discussion. If you're looking for more closure and a few holes filled in the anime, then go watch it. If you're looking for a new story and new developments, then don't.
>> ARTICLE
It looks like AnoHana VS FLCL is the match to watch this time. I love each of them. So hard to choose... There's 4 of each seed, so I rolled an electronic die to create the match ups. This was a brutal roll.
>> ARTICLE
Day 4:

* 1\. **Death Note** versus **Serial Experiments Lain** - One of the most popular gateway thriller shows versus a slow-paced thoughtful oldie. I suspect DN will win. I'm going to vote for Lain :3

* 2\. **Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni** versus **Pet Girl of Sakurasou** - I know we like harems. I do too. But there are *very* few proper horror anime shows, and Higurashi is the leading entry. Let justice be done.

* 3\. **Mushishi** versus **Soul Eater** - I know Soul Eater is popular, but Mushishi has to win. For justice.

* 4\. **Hyouka** versus **Toradora!** - This might be a rough one. Meaning no wrong answer.

* 5-6 - **AnoHana** versus **FLCL** and **Hellsing** versus **NagiAsu**? Talk about shows that are nothing alike. In the first half I'd be fine with either, and in the second I'd rather neither. Hee hee.

* 7\. **_Monogatari** versus **Mirai Nikki** - I see Monogatari winning, but Mirai Nikki was loads of fun.

* 8\. **Cowboy Bebop** versus **Planetes** - Cowboy Bebop will win, but Planetes is a really good series.

Now to revisit day 3:

* 3\. **Haruhi** beat **GTO** bloody. Guess being a show from the 90s takes its toll.

* 7\. **Neon Genesis Evangelion** almost lost to **Kill la Kill**. In the end, justice prevailed, but dayum.

* 8\. **Gurren Lagann** wiped the floor with **Hanasaku Iroha**. Expected. I'd have been fine with either winning.

Edit:

>Everyone's favorite romcom Toradora takes on the highest vote getter in the nomination topic Hyouka.

I call Toradora! "The Best RomCom that isn't." - Early on it appears to be a RomCom, but to me it's a Romantic Drama, and that makes all the difference.
>> ARTICLE
> Hellsing versus NagiAsu? I'd rather neither

Whaaaat? What didn't you like about NagiAsu?
>> ARTICLE
All the conflicts were the same conflict, time and time again. It was also too padded. It should've been around 6-8 episodes shorter.
>> ARTICLE
The problem Lain has is just that almost nobody has seen it compared to Death Note. Such a shame for this great a show to bow out in the first round.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill had a good 3 or 4 vote lead most of yesterday. With this and SAO going down, my bracket is trashed.
>> ARTICLE
They were mostly 3-4 votes ahead or behind of one another. Neck and neck. I thought NGE would wipe the floor with KLK :<
>> ARTICLE
I was so anxious about NGE vs KLK last time, and now I gotta be anxious for Death Note vs Lain *and* Bake vs Mirai Nikki.
>> ARTICLE
Out of curiosity, if you made a top 20 list of anime right now, which of the 64 shows would show up on it? 8 out of 20 are in the running for me:  

AnoHana  
Baccano!  
Cowboy Bebop  
FLCL  
From the New World  
Mushishi  
Ping Pong: The Animation  
Planetes  

What about the rest of you?
>> ARTICLE
1. Madoka Magica

2. Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) It's going up against Clannad, and if it wins, it's probably going against Madoka. I don't see it surviving ;_;

3. Evangelion. It's up against a show from the genre it's deconstructing. They are polar opposites. Shinji, now is not the time to be [EoE](/s "Fapping to Asuka.") Considering Eva almost lost to KLK, I don't think it has very good chances against TTGL. 

4. Bakemonogatari. 

5. Ping Pong. It lost, though. 

6. Steins;Gate. 

7. Fate/Zero

8. Psycho Pass

Ones I can't put in any particular order right now but would probably make top 20: 

Hyouka

TTGL

Champloo

Higurashi

Bebop

Baccano!

Shows that would be in my top 20 but aren't there: 

Oregairu

Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (The Tatami Galaxy)

Katanagatari

Kara no Kyoukai

Actually, these shows would be in my top 7 or something. I'm amazed Katanagatari is nowhere to be seen, but I can understand the others not being there. 
>> ARTICLE
There are three shows definitely belonging in my personal top 20, those being Fate/Zero, Code Geass and Baccano!

Shinsekai Yori, Ping Pong, Evangelion and Ouran are also in the discussion, and would probably all fall somewhere between 16 and 30.
>> ARTICLE
I only have a list of my top ~35 anime right now, not organized, in alphabetical order the ones in it:

* AnoHana

* Code Geass

* Durarara!!

* FLCL

* Great Teacher Onizuka

* Hanasaku Iroha

* Madoka Magica

* Mirai Nikki

* Mushishi

* Neon Genesis Evangelion

* Ping Pong the Animation

* Planetes

* Serial Experiments Lain

* Shinsekai Yori

* Spice and Wolf

* Steins;Gate

* Sword Art Online

* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

* Toradora!

* Welcome to the NHK

Ha! Just counted, it's exactly 20 series, but no, some of my favourites are missing, such as Dennou Coil, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Gatchaman Crowds, Genshiken, and others.

And shows I haven't watched yet which might get on it (sorted alphabetically):

* Baccano!

* Clannad

* Cowboy Bebop

* Hunter x Hunter

* Hyouka

* Space Battleship Yamato

Which of them would be in top 20 and which just outside? That's too hard for me to tell you right now.
>> ARTICLE
Instead I'll just post my general top 20 here... though many of the series in the tournament are on my list.

#1. Clannad

#2. Kuroko no Basuke

#3. Durarara!!

#4. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica

#5. No Game No Life

#6. Steins;Gate

>> ARTICLE
No matter what happens to you, Sakurasou, I will always love you.

^oh ^god ^you're ^going ^to ^be ^massacred

EDIT: Mm, I've been lurking throughout this whole tournament thing, but I think I'll actually participate in the speculation/discussion this time.

**1.** While I'm voting for Lain myself, I think we'd all be lying to ourselves if we didn't see Death Note surviving this.

**2.** These are two fantastic shows, and it pains me to see them put against each other. While I expect Higurashi to definitely win, I just couldn't bring myself to vote against Sakurasou.

**3.** Eh, never really got into Soul Eater. Not a shounen guy. I'm going with Mushishi on this, and I'm pretty confident it's going to take the win.

**4.** Two very big series going head to head in this one. I really wouldn't mind if either won, and I love both, but I decided to go Toradora!.

**5.** I'm thoroughly surprised to see that Nagi no Asakura has a firm bit of backing to it, I was expecting Hellsing to just pulverize it. I mean, I still voted for Hellsing, but still.
 
**6.** Again, two very acclaimed series here, but I think Anohana is going to have the edge, if due to nothing other than it being more current and fresher in everyone's minds. Voted for it myself.

**7.** I'm a bit of an undeniable Monogatari/ SHAFT fanboy, and I just had to stick to my roots here. While I understand all the acclaim of Mirai Nikki, and liked it a lot myself, it wasn't something amazing. Not to me, personally, at least.

**8.** Okay, to be perfectly honest here, I've never seen Planetes. But, removing my own personal convictions and preferences here, I think it's going to be hard for quite anything to beat Bebop. That's just how big the support for that show is. I'm already building a fallout shelter in my heart for that dreadful, dreadful Monogatari vs. Bebop fight that's going to end up coming up.
>> ARTICLE
First Higurashi will rip off a nail or two... then we'll get around to the massacre.
>> ARTICLE
Well, actually looking at how the results are coming along, Sakurasou is definitely not going down without a fight. Kind of reassuring, really. I mean, it's still probably going to lose, but it's going to be a proud defeat, not a massacre.
>> ARTICLE
Yay! Results went entirely in my favor as expected. Mainstream tastes for the win!

Holy shit, loaded contestants today. 

1. This is like a top 40 show vs. a top 10 show for me. Lain is brilliant, so I hope it wins, but DN will likely take it for being more widely appealing. That's fine, I wasn't expecting something like Lain to get far anyway.

2. They're both okay, but Higurashi please? It's probably less well known, at least speaking in recent terms, but it's the superior show. Whatever, I'm not 100% sure which way it'll go, but I'm rooting for Higurashi.

3. Both quite good. Mushishi an episodic SoL style show with folktale-esque stories, and Soul Eater the best possible incarnation of "Generic Shounen". I assume the latter will win, but you've surprised me in the past /r/anime, please do so again. Go Mushishi!

4. Haven't seen Hyouka yet, but want to, I hear great things. I love Toradora as a Romantic ComDram, but don't have any real knowledge of Hyouka to make a prediction off of. Knowing the community, it's probably a close call, but I'll go with Toradora for this one. 

5. I don't know anything about either of these! Hellsing is super violent and is about a vampire I think! Nagi no Asukara is about... water or something maybe. I'm still sharpening my useless anime knowledge, but I think that was accurate. My votes on Hellsing because violence. Indifference.

6. Haven't seen FLCL yet, I should get on that one. It seems fun though, but just on sheer commonness of discussion here, I assume Anohana has this. We'll see.

7. More stuff I'm yet to get around to. A highly acclaimed harem  by SHAFT vs. a super violent show with yandares, violence, deus ex machinas, and did I mention violence? Or so the memory encyclopedia recalls. Again, I only have fringe knowledge of both, my vote is on monogatari. 

8. Planetes! Another show I need to watch. Cowboy Bebop is a classic, it's not losing here, sorry other show about something or another I need to watch.

A lot of this could go either way, I'm excited to see how this goes down. 
>> ARTICLE
Planetes should be at the top of your list to watch. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about it. It's horribly under-appreciated. 

And I think you underestimate Mushishi's popularity. I thought it'd breeze by Soul Eater.
>> ARTICLE
Planetes is somewhere in the middle of my to watch list, under stuff like Tatami Galaxy, FMA:B, etc. I'm looking forward to it though, I hear great things.

You may be right about Mushishi though, I forgot how widely liked it was here, especially in comparison to soul eater (which may even be called under appreciated here)
>> ARTICLE
Didn't expect K-On! to beat Fairy Tail and thank god Fate/zero won.  
Today please everyone give your power for Monogatari to win!

As one of the few that can't stand NGE, I'm saddened by KLK's loss. It did much better than I was expecting though so that is good. The clarification of Higurashi is nice since it removes the cancer that is the Umineko anime adaptation from consideration.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong >>> Code Geass
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, kinda disappointed about this, but Geass has the mass appeal.

Ping Pong is the better series. Code Geass was an incredible experience when it aired, but Ping Pong does more with 13 episodes than Geass managed with 50+ episodes.
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of art style haters that either dropped or never picked up Ping Pong. If people could ignore the wonky art style like many did with Code Geass, Ping Pong probably would've smashed Geass. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope hellsing and death note pass this round. Very happy that NGE passed but i think gurren lagan will win that fight.
>> ARTICLE
The hardest vote for me this time was Cowboy Bebop versus Planetes.  In my mind they are fairly similar in many respects.

I ended up going with Bebop though, because I liked how it progressed the story episodically by going into one character's story at a time sort of thing.  Also I did not really like the ending of Planetes (don't want to get into the details of why, because spoilers).

It was a weird vote for me though, because Bebop is a show I dropped part way through (I don't usually drop things) whereas Planetes was the anime that got me back into watching anime after a long hiatus.  I even have Planetes with a higher rating than Bebop on my MAL.  Sometimes I don't make much sense.
>> ARTICLE
#1. Death Note vs Serial Experiments Lain - I'm not casting a vote here since I have yet too see Lain and from what I've heard it's supposedly very good and might be able to compete with Death Note.

#2. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni vs **Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo** - Two of my favourite series going up against each other.... Harsh but Sakurasou wins out in the end as a great drama/comedy series.

#3. **Mushishi** vs Soul Eater - One of the best entries in the adventure genre would be Mushishi and it's a very beautiful series as well. While Soul Eater in my opinion was only so-so.

#4. Toradora! vs **Hyouka** - Honestly I feel like Toradora! is undeserving of the credit it gets, It's not bad but it's nowhere near as good as it gets credit for. I feel that Hyouka lived up to it's reputation fairly well however and it sure was an interesting show even though it falls short of becoming anything special for me.

#5. Hellsing/Hellsing Ultimate vs Nagi no Asukara - I have not watched Asukara yet so I won't cast a vote here either but from what I've heard around the subreddit it's likely that I find it better than Hellsing.

#6. **Anohana** vs FLCL - Anohana is amazing and while FLCL has it's credibilities it can't put a dent on the name Anohana.

#7. **Bakemonogatari** vs Mirai Nikki - Now if this would only be counting the first season of Monogatari I would've went with Mirai Nikki as it's also a very good show even if it has quite large plot holes. But with the coming of "Monogatari Second Season" the Monogatari franchise has risen high up in my personal rankings and is now among the top. It's a very unique and great series that definitely deserves all it's hype.

#8. **Cowboy Bebop** vs Planetes - I would be surprised to see Bebop lose this as one of the most successful series of all time but Planetes is a good series... just not good enough.

#Yesterdays results - Not very surprising results here but it's gonna be real fun watching the community side with either NGE or TTGL.
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop is hardly the most successful series of all time, for the record.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't say the most, I said one of the most and there's no denying that is it?
>> ARTICLE
This is how many copies it sold up to 5 months ago (average, per DVD/BD), in DVD/BD in Japan:

[1998]  16768   Cowboy Bepop (Sunrise)

Considering every year we have several series that outsell it, then *eh*. That was #82, and it's going to keep dropping every year by about 7-10 spots.

It's one of the most highly appreciated, but that doesn't mean the same thing as most successful. Also, since it's pretty successful/renowned in the west, lacking sales data for it in the west to comparison makes things hard.
>> ARTICLE
You bring a very valid point, I guess appreciated is a more correct term than successful in this case =)
>> ARTICLE
Just looked at the Bracket... Steins;Gate vs. Spice and Wolf... NO!! Not that! Anything but that! And it's way too early on for that...
>> ARTICLE
Voting ends when I get back from dinner. Matches are close, so get your votes in.
>> ARTICLE
1. Death Note v Lain: Amazingly enough, a matchup where I haven't seen either of them. Death Note is itself well off my radar, and Lain is right behind Key The Metal Idol on my to-watch list.   
2. Haven't seen When They Cry, so it's an easy vote for the show where the loboto-moe wins.  
3. There is no competition in this. Mushishi will always be a better show than Soul Eater.   
4. Difficult, but the edge has to go to Hyouka. I know few other people will see it that way due to this sub's fascination with the Palm-Top Tsundere, but it is true.  
5. Generic shonen versus non-generic love polyhedron? Generics always lose. Nagi no Asukara wins.  
6. I barely remember anything from the drug-induced haze known as FLCL, but I barely misted up at AnoHana before the final episode. So compare "I don't remember" to "It wasn't as soul-crushing as everyone said it would be", and I have to vote FLCL.  
7. Neither have been seen. No vote. I know. It's a great crime to have not watched any of the -gataris. I'll get on that eventually.  
8. Well. That's easy! I'll just vote for... Oh. Ummm... Two shows I love more than K-On! itself. Right... Fuck it. Because it will lose so pathetically badly, I'll choose Planetes. It's not like it will be in third place behind "Haven't Seen Either", right guys? Guys? I'm right, right? (i'mnotright)
>> ARTICLE
I'm happy SAO lost, but I didn't think it would be that big of a difference o.o
>> ARTICLE
I'm an emotional person, but the ending of Anohana never hit me. As a fan of NagiAsu, I'm going to have to ironically say that Anohana's ending was hella melodramatic. 

I still loved the series because there's one thing that made me really happy; the group of friends were able to forgive themselves and each other. Menma the real MVP.
>> ARTICLE
After the firework it just feels so laboured and dragging, to the point i actually laugh during the final ep because I just don't care anymore by that point
>> ARTICLE
They should have built the fireworks episode as a finale.

I watched Anohana like 8 months ago and I still remember my reaction because of how pathetic it was. This is me trying to force myself to cry: "..... I can't fucking do this."
>> ARTICLE
Asking a guy to go through climax one after another is exhausting
>> ARTICLE
If I look back and critically analyze it, I can definitely see its flaws (which have been mentioned already). But I didn't care about any of that when I was watching it. If the story manages to grab your attention, you'll love it. If not, then it will seem like an over-dramatic moe festival.
>> ARTICLE
It had a bunch of melodrama, but The melodrama IMO felt more natural than most. It also had the usual anime cliche of having every character feel guilty over a specific event, and made the entire show revolve around that. Difference is, they all were guilty so it didn't feel forced like it does other times. 
>> ARTICLE
the characters all felt guilty about menma's death, but for different reasons.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree, IMO it was the guilt plot line done right for the most part. Usually it's like "she got into a car accident and I was in the back seat but it's somehow all my fault!" Wich is not only bad melodrama, but it makes no sense. The drama in Ano Hana made sense, but the show could get a little extreme and out there, or take stuff too far. 
>> ARTICLE
well... yeah your example doesn't make sense as written.  the way to make "she got into a car accident and I was in the back seat but it's somehow all my fault!" work is to make the character say "if i had been sitting in the front seat instead of her she would still be alive".  survivor's guilt is a real thing, it's powerful and it can be devastating.
>> ARTICLE
No, I've seen it done where nobody has died, therefore it makes no sense. Don't want to spoil but I was referring to a show written by the author of Toradora. Shit was stupid. 

Survivors guilt it one thing, like Shirou from Fate Stay. But when nobody died or is seriously hurt its just forced drama. 
>> ARTICLE
you mean golden time?  i didn't think banri had survivor's guilt... but i had some mixed feelings about golden time as a whole.
>> ARTICLE
It isn't survivors guilt since nobody died... 

But everyone in the car felt responsible for what happened even though nobody died and it was nobodies fault. But everyone feels guilty and wants to shoulder the whole responsibility for what happened. 

"I feel asleep, it's my FAULT!" "NO, it isn't your fault, it's mine because it was my car!" "NO, it's mine, I should have never let her drive (because they all could have seen this coming) I'm terrible!" 

Shit like that gets on my nerves. It's one thing when someone dies (even then they could get overdramatic, I don't know how common survivors guilt is but j doubt everyone in the group will feel it like they did) but many times it's done for events or accidents that have no real effect on life. 
>> ARTICLE
oh now i remember the scene you're talking about.  yeah, i agree with you it was way overstated.
>> ARTICLE
i think it would have been a much more interesting story if the question of ghost-menma's actual existence was left unanswered until the very end, when everyone got ghost-scrawled notes.

maybe not even then.  

if Anjou had been the only one who had "seen" her throughout the story, it would have been just ambiguous enough for us to question - was it a show about helping a ghost move on, or helping a friend come to terms with his grief (and a group of friends resolve the unresolved conflicts generated by her death)?
>> ARTICLE
Ding Ding Ding. You read my mind. If the characters are greiving over a character that has passed away, it almost robs that viewer of their own grief when she is still there, enjoying every second of it. I kinda took what my friend said in a different way and had the idea that the story could have tapped into an even more heartbreaking drama if Menma had simply not been there leaving the characters to wonder what her life could have been.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of over exaggeration. I still liked the show a lot, but there was too much crying for no reason
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly what I tell people when they ask me why ano hana wasn't a 10/10 for me. It was good for sure, but a lot of the drama and sad parts felt a bit forced. Like the anime tries too hard to make you feel like shit and shed some manly tears :D
>> ARTICLE
I agree.
>> ARTICLE
In the first episode it was shown that Anjou was able to feel Menma when she got hugged by her and it was also Menma who made those cake thingies. If Jinta had just thought about making Menma make contact with someone else from the group the series could have spent that time putting more focus on all of the characters (Especially Poppo) than wasting their time with "Ohmigosh I don't believe you", "Menma isn't there" and "Let go of the past" which just got more annoying with each additional time (Just like the crying). As for the ending, they could have somehow combined both the pseudo ending with the firework as well as the actual ending instead of creating one hell of a cringey melodramatic scene.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with all of this. Forgot about those scenes. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't have any real problems with it, i think its a great show. The entire thing about her coming back and potentionally being reborn is about believing.
>> ARTICLE
That it ended
>> ARTICLE
I really wanted to know if Poppo really traveled or if he was just a homeless pathological liar.

>> ARTICLE
I can't remember as well. Didn't he have pictures though?
>> ARTICLE
Again, how simplistic her wish was I wish it would involved more of the group to show she cared for the rest as much, But I guess it did shed some light on her character.
>> ARTICLE


Chill month this time around - the amount of threads have dropped by half (18 -> 9) in comparison with August. Though all of them were very good, I have to say, and because there is not a big amount of them now - take an opportunity and read them all! I hope these threads (just as shows) would be worthy of your time.

Wasn't sure how to include [the mini-compilation of OVAs](https://redd.it/3lncos) in the thread, so I went with "bonus" section. Check it out as well! 

This month I've composed [FLCL thread](https://redd.it/3m8y6t), and I plan to stick to the idea of releasing one [WT!] thread per month. Have some ideas about the anime I want to write about, so I hope this thread would be at least not worse than FLCL one!

Anyway, as usual, thank you very much for reading and supporting this series of threads, and any feedback is appreciated.
>> ARTICLE
I have two [WT!] in work, but I found no time to actually finish them, because I had to finish the airing season before all the new stuff goes on. 

Planned to write 1 thread a month and failed at the first try :D
>> ARTICLE
> the amount of threads have dropped by half

Most of the people working on **[WT!]** may be too busy working on school work or other responsibilities, which is totally fine.

And keep up the good work
>> ARTICLE
[](#akyuusqueel)

 Senpai noticed me. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to think my Sidonia WT went really well dispite all the comment either being others recommeding it or talking about the issues people have with season two.
>> ARTICLE
That's alright if people don't talk about what you wrote and how you wrote. I've made over 15 [WT!] threads, and lots of comments focused on the show itself, rather than recommendation and writing. It's not a bad thing, though - any discussion is good enough to begin with, especially about the anime you like!
>> ARTICLE
123 up votes is pretty great and it also had a good ratio too so I think it was pretty well received overall. Always nice to get more people exposed to mecha that isn't NGE/TTGL/CG.
>> ARTICLE
That was part of the reason why I wanted to write one too. As this was my first ever WT I just wish I could have gotten a bit more feedback of what people thought about it in the comments.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I didn't say anything about that in the comments because there wasn't much to say, it was a solid write-up. I think you did a pretty good job of highlighting the positive points, I especially like the clips that you included because the sound fx in Sidonia really complete the show. You were also pretty honest about the spotty animation in S1 and the harem romance being the flaws of the show. 

If you really want me to be captious I would say maybe adding a few more character descriptions would have improved it, I think Yuhata and Hoshijiro at least deserve a mention and maybe Kunato as well. I also might have included some stuff about the mysteries of the world (why is the captain wearing a mask? why was nagate raised underground?) because for me trying to figure out that stuff was what sucked me in to the first season. Those things are only really going to stick out to someone who's already seen the show though, I think your writing was fine and you did a really good job of representing what the show is like.
>> ARTICLE
In regards to /u/Anistisi's WT! for Hotarubi no Mori e: I actually watched it the same day I said I will probably watch it (it came as a surprise to me that I actually did) and I loved it. Probably will make some gifs too, there were some scenes that I thought would be good.
>> ARTICLE
Everybody has to check out Saraiya Goyou! It's criminal that more people haven't seen it!

thanks for compiling all of them into this thread!! 

very useful for anime lovers

I had no idea we had a spreadsheet that archived all WT threads.  This is cool stuff.  Just picked up Barakamon thanks to the spreadsheet!
>> ARTICLE
Ah damn my WT isn't here. :(
>> ARTICLE
It was still on front page when I was making the thread, but now it has fallen out, so I can include it now. Would you like me to include it now or save it till the next thread comes? 
>> ARTICLE
Oh that makes sense. It's fine just save it till the next threads comes. Thanks for doing this!

It was nominated. 
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, the [Nomination Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ro3ci/ranime_awards_2014_category_nominations/) was confusing as fuck to use/participate in. Granted i didn't watch many seasonal animes last year myself, some of the nominations that made it through were like "..Really??" 

For Future Nomination Threads, i think a Collective-Elimination vote would serve as a better format. Take Every Title from the year, break them all down in catagories, Make the public vote 10 out of each. Top 10 in each catagory goes on to the Finals (The Award Show). 
>> ARTICLE
I don't really see how the nomination thread was confusing. If anything, I thought it was really simple. You find the category you want and then you vote for your anime/character/whatever. It wasn't that hard. Even if you asked me a question I did my best to be clear and make sense while explaining what to do/how it worked. I was even willing to link to a thread if you couldn't find it. 

I think I might actually still do this. I'm going to finish posting these poll threads daily and then do one big thread with all of the categories limited to just 10 nominees or 5 for the less popular ones (like sports in this case.)
>> ARTICLE
> I don't really see how the nomination thread was confusing.

idk, maybe im just retareded (not even joking hahaha), Well now looking at it as it sits (complete), it's not so bad. The last i looked at it was as soon as it was posted-several hours after. Things were moving up and down, There were a couple troll nominations that went up "Boku no pico!"/etc. It was complete Chaos in a sense. But it even'd out pretty nice.

Great thread. Sadly, most of these I haven't seen, so it's pretty easy to make a choice when you have either SAO or PP2, for example.
>> ARTICLE
~~Sakura Trick for romance~~
>> ARTICLE
SAO II is up there as a romance. Unless Kirito x Asada is canon, it shouldn't be up there. 
>> ARTICLE
Here are my personal favourites from the particular genres (trying to make it so that the strength of the genre dictates my choice):

* Comedy: Mangaka-san to Assistant-san

The only show of the year where I can honestly say I was laughing from start to finish every single episode (and during each of the full length OVAs). The particular brand of comedy it supplies is far from for everyone but it worked so well for me.

* Slice of Life: Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou

Sakurasou is my favourite show of all time and I think Kawaisou is the closest any anime has come to replicating the humour and setting. The romance was brilliant even though [](/s "it didn't develop as far as we all would have liked"). The humour was wonderful and the characters were unique and colourful. It was a show with a lot of heart and I hope it gets a second season at some point.

* Harem: Nisekoi

The best way to compare harems is by their girls and every girl in Nisekoi is a serious best girl candidate. The reaction gifs and humour are marvelous and SHAFT did a ridiculously good job keeping their SHAFTiness *relatively* contained.

* Thriller: WIXOSS

Continuous plot twists, lots of suffering, an interesting premise and fantastic delivery.

* ~~Sports~~

Not a fan of the genre, didn't watch any of the options. Tried to watch Ping Pong but unfortunately I have huge trouble getting into shows with art styles that I don't like.

* Romance: Sakura Trick

Continuous kissing, which funnily enough is rather unique. Maybe it's not the best show ever but the romance had me from start to finish and has kept me rewatching particular scenes since the show ended.

* Science Fiction: Aldnoah.Zero

This was a hard section since I'm not sure Aldnoah would deserve it. Parasyte isn't Sci-Fi enough for me to vote for it and I haven't seen a lot of the rest. Aldnoah was very entertaining at least, even though the writing was at times disappointing.

* Action/Battle Shounen: Noragami

The premise, the characters and the action were all great. Not much else to say. Hiyori best girl.

edit: reasoning
>> ARTICLE
> Romance: Sakura Trick

It had some great potential, but I flipt a table when it turned into the most generic yuri anime ever 5 episodes in. Like it wasn't even funny how generic it became. Such a shame, because it could've been a lot better than it was if not for that.
>> ARTICLE
> the most generic yuri anime ever

If you know another yuri anime with kissing (let alone that much kissing) please, *please* enlighten me.

The plot was pretty typical of SoLs but the execution was not.

Out of curiosity, why is Mushishi in Slice of Life? While I recognize it's difficult to categorize and deals with some daily trivialities, doesn't putting it alongside Yuuki Yuuna and other, well, *slice of life-y* anime kind of ... diminish it? If anything I feel like it should be listed under Thriller, especially as dark as some episodes this series were.

I have a feeling I missed a poll thread along the line somewhere. >.>
But I guess it's so niche it probably wouldn't win any popularity contests anyway, so I'll just vote for it and move on.

Voted for Trinity Seven for Harem which is likely only me. >_> My reasoning is that it actually has romantic development, good girls, and can support itself as a Harem. [It's the only Harem series this year](/s " to develop an actual stable mutual Harem.")

I can understand Nisekoi love but I don't think it's a High Quality Harem series at all. It regularly uses from the big book of tropes, dense as fuck protagonist, and very little actual romantic progression. It's strong points though are the cute girls and the visuals... Which is about it in my opinion. I think it's a better comedy series than a romance series.

Comedy - Amagi brilliant park for being half funny and having characters named after rappers. 5/10 won't watch again but worth my time. 

Honorable mention goes to space dandy s2 which I didn't finish. 

Slice of life - Space Brothers for being a mature story about adults with actual dreams that I can be invested in and caring about its characters. Too slow at times though and pretty long. 7/10 won't watch again because too long but it was good. 

Silver spoon s2 because the show does a good job in portraying it's characters and making them go through struggles actual teenagers go through. Also it was very funny and charming. 8/10 will probably watch again some day. 

Harem - whatever monogatari stuff that aired this year because monogatari is best harem. Usually 6 or 7/10 because too much otaku pandering. 

Thriller - abstain because I haven't seen anything good. But it's probably between wixoss, rage of Bahamut and terror in resonance 

Romance - (edit) the wind rises is my choice because it was half decent. Forgot it's considered romance. 

Sports - PING PONG THE FUCKING ANIMATION MOTHERFUCKER 

SciFi - space Brothers for being the best series in the category. 

Action/ Battle Shonen - HxH - if this was 2013 and I had to pick between Jojos (2012) and hunter x hunter it would have been hard. But this year stardust crusaders was pretty weak compared to Jojos 2012 so HxH gets my vote. 

>> ARTICLE
> Comedy

Nothing 

Perhaps Gekkan Shoujo.  I didn't particularly find anything too funny this year, especially not the shows which were nominated.

>Slice of Life

Barakamon - I mean it's not really a unique idea but it was executed so well and so much charm it'd be foolish to vote otherwise

> Harem

Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai

> Thriller

Zankyou no Terror - I didn't particularly like ZnT but it had some good cliffhangers in the middle and did what a thriller should do.  I think the best thriller isn't even on this list lol.  Argevollen is nowhere to be found

> Romance

Soredemo Sekai no Utskushii - It was really well done, and the subtle changes in the OP reflect the level of endearment the crew had for their show.  It might have been a bit boring for some considering a lot of popular romances are drama's but I think this is the best we had.  

>Sports

Ping Pong the Animation - I think this show is way overrated and I was one of the people hyping this up.  But even then this show was one of the better ones of its season and probably the best sports anime, and put a little twist on the formulaic genre.

> Science Fiction

Sidonia no Kishi - This one just takes the cake.  You may have a bit to say with the CGI (which was handled pretty well) and stock footage reusage but goddamn this was one of the better scifi universes animated this year

If I had to rank them, NHK and Anohana had the most "realistic" hiki NEETs as far as behavior patterns and motivations are concerned. WataMote treated Tomoko in a way that is too exaggerated because it was too much a kind of comedy...the things that happened *could* have been very believable but the degree of Tomoko's reactions was unnatural, and NGNL is pure escapist fantasy. Mekaku has a NEET that is vaguely believable from a psychological view but is so wealthy and undisturbed it isn't representative.

The MC of BTOOOM is a decent example of a NEET, from what little I saw, regarding the negative personality aspects.
>> ARTICLE
Could you elaborate more on Mekaku?
>> ARTICLE
The synopsis says Shintaro is a NEET, but it doesn't really feel like he is one. The story barely focuses on that matter too, so I don't think he makes a good example of a NEET.

I think the reason why he's always in his room is more because his closest friends died (from his POV at least) and he didn't really make new friends since. This changes at the beginning of MCA when he meets the Mekakushi-Dan, he acts like he's pissed but actually enjoyed himself.
>> ARTICLE
From what I can see of Mekaku so far, Shintarou has no family bothering him about his hikikomori nature and never lives his apartment whatsoever until the events of the show, which seems really strange.

And despite all that he acclimates very quickly to being on the outside. I don't hold that much against the show, it has other things it wants to deal with. Shintarou's hikikomori nature seems to me to really just be some minor flavor to provide him with a set "personality" and reduce the amount of development they need to give him.
>> ARTICLE
This is explained much better in the novels and manga. Shintarou made some money making music, so he wasn't broke. He also lives with his mom and sister in a house, not an apartment. He is also complaining about how much time he spends outside almost nonstop in the novels, making it a bit more realistic considering he was in his room for 2 years straight. His seclusion is very important to the events of the story. I can go into it a bit more, but it would be venturing into spoiler territory. 
>> ARTICLE
Is Shintaro's mom sick? I remember something like that from episode 2 like that's why Momo became an idol but I don't think they were clear whether it was a chronic illness.
>> ARTICLE
I think that Welcome to the NHK was the anime that really nailed the whole 'social recluse' aspect. I think that's because it's the most realistic. It's the most relatable in the things they do and the things the people around them do, because these things actually do happen in real life.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. What do you think about Anohana? The ghost element adds 'unrealism' but how did you find the characters? Especially Jinta.
>> ARTICLE
Anohana is great. While the ghost aspect does make it more fictive, as you said, I don't think it really affected the characters. The characters all act very human, and it's easy to relate to them in their situation (ghost aside).

EDIT: My game of League started, so had to keep it short. (I won and it promoted me to silver, by the way) Anyway, about Jinta. I think he was a great character, but I didn't really feel the helplessness of being a social recluse like I did with NHK. This did mean that he was much more, though. I'm happy they didn't give the NEET part too much weight and focused more on the interactions with the other characters of the show. I do agree with /u/tensorpudding though, these two shows definitely had most realistic NEETs.

For OreGairu, sure he isn't very social, but he's not really cut off from society like most of the others are. He's just fine with being on his own, living in his big brain of his. So yeah he was a bit off socially, but on a very different level from the other few.
>> ARTICLE
Grats for silver(bronze III here; I can only feel happy for you)! I was new to anime the first time I watched anohana, so I may rewatch it again to see what I'm missing. I thought it was meh the first time, but better the second... Definitely didn't notice the NEET aspects as much.
>> ARTICLE
Out of those, I have watched Welcome to the NHK, Mekakucity Actors and No Game No Life.

First off, **Mekakucity Actors**. The plot at the beginning of the season makes you believe that the story will revolve around Shintaro, a NEET who has to go outside, and that the plot will basically be this. It couldn't be farther from the truth. Mekakucity Actors focuses on the characters from a gang called the Mekakushi-Dan, members of which have mysterious eye powers. The group tries to find the truth behind those powers, and a piece of the puzzle is uncovered with each of the members of the group and their past.

The beginning of the story is Shintaro spilling cola on his keyboard and having it replaced. From there, he is interacting with other members of the dan like a normal but really shy man. If you're looking to delve in the psychology of a social recluse, this is not the way to go.

In **No Game No Life**, the protagonists are NEETs, but not for long. In our world, they feel like they don't have a challenge, so they lock themselves away with videogames in which they are the best. One day, they are transported to another world where everything is based on games, and our protagonists feel much more at home there.

When does the "going to the new world" thing take place? The very first episode. After that they are no longer NEETs or recluses, they interact with pretty much anybody like a normal person in Disboard (the name of the fictional world). So that's not a good anime to understand the psyche of a social recluse either.

**Welcome to the NHK** (NHK ni Youkoso) is what you are looking for. The protagonist is a hikikomori who doesn't do anything with his life. Someone comes in to help him, but the journey is long and full of obstacles.

This anime focues on how the protagonist thinks as a hikikomori. There is a lot of introspection (hearing the thoughts of the MC) to help us feel exactly this. We get to know why he's a hikikomori, why he stays that way, what goes through his mind when he meets someone he knows, a stranger, how he feels in crowded places.
>> ARTICLE
[WataMote](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16742/Watashi_ga_Motenai_no_wa_Dou_Kangaetemo_Omaera_ga_Warui!) is an obvious one, less NEET, more social recluse.
>> ARTICLE
Ah right. I've been meaning to watch that one. Thanks!

I've been hearing that it's really 'cringey' and 'uncomfortable' or something.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely cringey and uncomfortable.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly couldn't finish it because I wanted to punch a little girl in the face and that doesn't seem healthy for my brain.
>> ARTICLE
I think Tomoko was the first character I've ever come across in any form of media where I wanted to grab her by the shoulders and shake her violently during every moment she was on screen - yet at the same time, I could relate to her enough that she currently ranks in my top 10 favourite characters over on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
I had to stop like three or four times because I couldn't handle it
>> ARTICLE
It hit way too close to home for me
>> ARTICLE
C'mon, no one can be that cringey. 
>> ARTICLE
I just watched Welcome to the NHK and it actually ruined my life because of how infuriating it was, and I think that's mostly because of how well it captures NEETs. The show comes out and pretty much tells you that hikikomori's are worthless dogs that might as well not exist, but it also shows them as people who can recover given the right circumstances. 

On another note, I need a recommendation for another anime that'll ruin my life like welcome to the NHK did, any suggestions?
>> ARTICLE
If any anime truly captured the essence of a NEET/social recluse, nobody would watch it. It would be the most boring/frustrating show where nothing ever happened. The reason those shows are good is because they take something close to a social recluse and then improve their lives in some form or another. You can get close but never get a true NEET MC. That means the question becomes which one is closest. I haven't seen a fair number of the ones listed, but I know that Oregairu isn't really close; Watamote is pretty close but Tomoko is designed in a cutely awkward way; and Anohana's Jintan was really close.

TL;DR: NEETness is asymptotic.
>> ARTICLE
NHK does it pretty well. I see it's not on your list, give it a watch !!

In terms of visuals and fun, [Baccano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msg8ypnLqaw) takes the cake.

>> ARTICLE
What langue is that?


>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion
>> ARTICLE
My favorites in order are:

* Baccano! 
* Steins;Gate
* Neon Genesis Evangelion

Edit: List
>> ARTICLE
Trigun and Samurai Champloo for the song.For the visual it's a tie, between the 6th opening and the 14th opening for One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
"Yosuga no Sora" has the best intro song for me. "Hiyoku no Hane", the song's name, is my favourite song of all time. (If someone wants to listen to it, you'll find nothing on YouTube. Google "" to find the videos with the best qualities. [I linked the best one here.](http://vlog.xuite.net/play/WHhuZFRuLTMxNDgyMjguZmx2/%E3%83%A8%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AC%E3%83%8E%E3%82%BD%E3%83%A9-OP%E3%80%8C%E6%AF%94%E7%BF%BC%E3%81%AE%E7%BE%BD%E6%A0%B9%E3%80%8D%EF%BC%8Feufonius))

My second place is a song that more people will know. "My Soul, Your Beats!", the intro song from "Angel Beats!".

But if we are ignoring the musical aspect of the intros, I'll give my voice to "Elfen Lied". I love the intro song "Lilium", but I want to speak about the visual part of the intro. I think that the visual part of the intro is THE best I've ever seen in my entire anime life.

My second place for the best visual part of an anime intro is "Gokukoku no Brynhildr". (Yes, I am a Lynn-Okamoto-fanboy)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for linking the song :)

No problem^^

If you want an mp3 file from the song, I could send it to you. It is very difficult to find the song in a good quality.

>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, [Steins;Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJEGb4MPV6I) has the best OP of any show. The song is great, and it fits perfectly with the visuals. [Anohana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANJTGxUq9gs) is another great OP, for the music alone. 
>> ARTICLE
Both of Mirai Nikki's. If you like hearing Japanese girls attempt to sing in English Dead End is the way to go imo. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna have to go with Watamote's OP it was truly magnificent. Especially the perfect transition to it in one of the episodes. (I can't remember which one I think 12). 
>> ARTICLE
Angel Beats piano opening and code geass
>> ARTICLE
I've got code geass on my watchlist and from what i've heard it's pretty good. Looking forward to watch it :D
>> ARTICLE
I mean its been pretty good so far but, the animation is what puts me off. :(
>> ARTICLE
I know people are going to hate me for this, but I really liked AOT's opening, even the entire OST. Samurai Champloo has an OST I can't forget, and I liked most of Full Metal Alchemist's openings. Another good opening is Death Note's.
>> ARTICLE
So when are you gonna write a WT for SZS?
>> ARTICLE
I'm planning to do it for several months already (basically since the announcement of [WT!] threads), but this recommendation should be... a special one. I have a concept and idea of such post, structure and what I'm going to talk about. Now I have to take screenshots and gifs and to make the whole things readable. I mean, this recommendation should be at least no worse than [this one](http://redd.it/2xhvo1). So I should not fail, for Kafuka's sake.

Oh my, that is quite the standard to live up to. Oh well, I wish you godspeed on your endeavour.

Seems the amount decreases each week. Good stuff as usual /u/kaverik 
>> ARTICLE
Nah, two weeks ago we had seven recommendations. I would say ten is pretty okay number at the moment. All hot stuff is almost gone, so people write recommendations for the remaining hot stuff (SYD this week), or try to bring some less acclaimed/known titles. Soon enough the idea may die, or... people are going for the next round of recommendations, because some of the anime, well, deserve better threads that they have received. Will see. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for compiling those! WT threads are really quality threads and they deserve not to be forgotten! And it's easier to find them if they are linked than to find them via reddit's search engine.

It's just the right amount! Every single of this threads deserves to be at least read, if there were more of them then they wouldn't get enough atttention.

I hope to be included in "good recommendations" section soon enough! 
>> ARTICLE
This week had some good recommendations written by /u/asianviolinman, check them up. Also don't miss new threads by /u/dargosian and /u/Remington_NA, these guys always deliver well-written posts. Other recommendations were great too, there are only 10 of them, so I believe it won't take long time to skim through them.

**Anime that I personally recommend to watch from this week:** [Lovely Complex](http://redd.it/31rbfp), [Isshuukan Friends.](http://redd.it/322605), [Gin no Saji](http://redd.it/3291l3).

I'm not sure if I'm going to write a new recommendation next week because I'm kind of pressed for time at the moment, and if I have some spare minutes I'll probably start  online compilation spreadsheet with all recommendations that we've given. Should be clear and easy to navigate, will see how much time it might take. Then I'll message the mods to make the whole thing sticky somewhere in the sidebar. 

Anyway, thanks for stopping in this thread, and don't forget to leave the feedback!
>> ARTICLE
Hey, thanks for the shoutout! Glad you enjoy my stuff :)
>> ARTICLE
Are you allowed to repost/remake a thread? What if I wanted to post a second version? With more reasons to watch and stuff? Is that allowed? 
>> ARTICLE
I would say so. I'm not against it, but I think it would be great if you include the link to the previous recommendation in your post just for mentioning sake.
>> ARTICLE
I would probably just edit the post you already submitted. It would avoid duplicates so when people search for it only one will show up. 
>> ARTICLE
Thinking about writing another one - I wrote the Nodame Cantabile WT last week. It was fun to do, I'll put more effort into the next one though. Not sure what show to do it for, though, there are a few options that I don't think have been done yet - probably Full Metal Panic, amaburi, illya, or ef. Thoughts?
>> ARTICLE
I have been intruiged by Ef, but have never tried it. Do you think it's something I would enjoy as someone who likes dramatic romance series?
>> ARTICLE
If you're a fan of dramatic romance, I'd say it's a must watch; but your enjoyment of it depends on how much you like shaft-y type stuff. I personally was a big fan of the art. It's also a bit melodramatic but that gets better in the second season imo.

Just a warning, it's one of those shows that start out confusing and makes more sense the further in you get. It's not bad though.
>> ARTICLE
I was also thinking about doing one for ef but didn't know whether to split them into Tale of Memories and Melodies or to mention them both in the same thread and how to organize it. 
>> ARTICLE
Melodies is just season 2, not standalone. There's no point splitting them up. I'd probably write it assuming they would watch both, and touch on any differences between the seasons where appropriate.

You might want to do it differently for a show with huge differences in quality or themes or otherwise between seasons, but I don't think ef is like that.

btw, took a look at your mal - we have very high compatibility so thats neat
>> ARTICLE
I agree, though it might take me awhile just to pick out the scenes I want to share. So many great moments in the anime. Fantastic direction.

You wouldn't mind if I wrote the Watch This thread?
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. Absolutely, go for it, like I said, it was just one option. You could probably do it better justice anyway since it's been a long time since I watched it. I think the one I really want to do is FMP anyway.

And if you want or need someone to proofread or give input before you post, feel free to send it over.

Not sure I'd really classify it as anime.  It was a weird cel-shaded (or something) comedy comprised of random skits - the closest comparison I can make is maybe something like Robot Chicken.  I didn't realize it was *that* popular, but I do remember a lot of my friends enjoying it.

Pre-2000 rankings

All those poor people getting shipped empty boxes...
>> ARTICLE
I was very confused about this list until I reread what this list actually is. These aren't the all-time best selling TV anime sales, these are the all-time best selling TV anime **average** sales.

So, although older anime series like Evangelion might have had the highest total number of sales, those sales *per month* (or whatever time period this chart averages) have tapered off over time, causing it to fall off the chart. So, this chart will tend to show higher rankings for newer series.
>> ARTICLE
No, that's wrong. Those sales number are total average tracked by [Oricon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon) from the day the BD/DVD is released up until now, it usually stays the chart for only 2 or 3 weeks since most of the sales come from the first week so there're no such thing as 'per month' sales. And Oricon is established in 1999 so this list is only limited to post-2000 anime (that's why there're no Evangelion)

There's a list for pre-2000 (Anko-chan posted it), but i'm not so sure about its accurateness.

>> ARTICLE
Seems a mistake in titel: To aru Kagaku no Index.

It's either 'To aru Kagaku no Railgun' or 'To aru Majutsu no Index'
>> ARTICLE
I noticed this as well. Pretty sure Index does not classify as "scientific". It make me chuckle. Usually I see the opposite and people write "To aru Majutsu no Railgun".
>> ARTICLE
Am I missing something? Shouldn't Evangelion be on top? Or at least on the list?
>> ARTICLE
It's a pretty niche anime, to be frank, and not everyone that watched it understood it or liked it. That's not to say it wasn't well done, though.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the movies would sell well, because of all the ads and publicity stunts we see in convenience stores and whatnot.  Maybe US anime fans have an unrealistic perspective when it comes to seeing Japanese promos for Evangelion movies.
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion, as I understand it, was a pretty big success. Not the biggest, but it had good reviews. But it just wasn't accessible to the mainstream. It is, after all, a mech series at it's core, and very into sci-fi beyond that. Throw in some daddy problems and a dash of odeipus (sp?), and you have a series that a select few will love, but most will not understand. They'll just see giant robots.
>> ARTICLE
>Not the biggest

Except that it has the highest BD/DVD sales out of any anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Then why isn't it on the list? It does say "all-time."
>> ARTICLE
It's been said in the thread multiple times already. The people collecting the data starting in 1999 so all of the anime are from 2000+. EVA is from 1995. EVA has sold 170K+ copies, more than Bakemonogatari, which is at the top of the list.
>> ARTICLE
> The people collecting the data starting in 1999

I didn't see that, sorry for the confusion.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to watch it again, since I enjoyed it but alot went over my head as I've found out recently.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it once with a friend, didn't like it. Watched it again, and still didn't like it, but I saw that it was more than I'd given it credit for. So good move.
>> ARTICLE
I've watched it, tried watching it again, realised that there really was that much stuff left unexplained and left disliking it even more.
>> ARTICLE
This list only has anime that came out in 2000 or later; the data for older series is less reliable, but Evangelion is the series with the highest per-volume average.

I'm guessing that this list is just a copy of the post-2000 data from [here](http://www.mania.com/aodvb/showthread.php?p=2010466#post2010466), although I don't know why Golden Eggs isn't listed there.
>> ARTICLE
Is this average per year, per season, or per month?
>> ARTICLE
I didn't realise how popular SAO was.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't one piece the most popular ever?
>> ARTICLE
It's the top-selling manga of all time, not sure about anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Ohhh that may be true, Totally forgot this was just anime, some of these im a little suprised they did so well but werent continued
>> ARTICLE
i had no idea bakemonogatari is that popular.

why is it so popular? 
>> ARTICLE
Have you been living under a rock????? Bake has always been known to be one of shaft's great successes and it shouldn't be a surprise judging from nise's sales number
>> ARTICLE
did not realize it was more popular than haruhi/k-on!

(almost as much as both of them combined!)
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the world of Shaft..... where fanservice blows everything else out of the way
>> ARTICLE
You can say that for Nise, but Bake didn't really have that much fan service.
>> ARTICLE
Just because Nise has way more fanservice than normal doesn't mean Bake didn't have its fair share.
>> ARTICLE
That's also not counting Nisemonogatari with it.

Goes ros show that Girls Und Pamzer is a force of nature.

The good: Steins;Gate

The bad: Chaos;Head

The ugly: Robotics;Notes.
>> ARTICLE
**The Good:** Oregairu, a new take to the romance show. Atleast for me, it felt different and the character development of Hachiman is maybe second to none.

**The Bad** Shaman King. This was so far off the (incredible) Manga that it hurts. They just went and destroyed it.

**the Ugly** Kemonozume. It might not be fair, considering I dropped it after 3 episodes. But it was the definition of ugly for me, I couldn't get into neither the story nor the art.
>> ARTICLE
Yes I've also seen Kemonozume and absolutely hated the art-style, I liked the story but the art was really bad for me.
>> ARTICLE
I started watching [Haganai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10719/Boku_wa_Tomodachi_ga_Sukunai) recently, and it's actually amazingly similar to OreGairu; the cast of characters is, I mean.. there's a MC who's ostracized from the rest of his class, a dark haired beauty with no friends who starts a club with the goal of helping its members, and ditzy popular girl who joins right after the first two characters. Add a trap character as a gag yaoi love interest and a little sister for good measure, and, on the surface, its mindblowingly similar. 
>> ARTICLE
don't you dare compare 8-man to that shitty common Harem MC

but it definitely was good i especially loved the double trap
>> ARTICLE
lol he really is common as fuck. his only thing (aside from being nice to girls) is that whenever someone says something about "judging a book by its cover" he suddenly gets all SJW on them because of his hair
>> ARTICLE
Never heard of it, but it sounds very interesting! I'll check it out, thanks :)

its not quite as good as SNAFU. it doesnt have very muc hcharacter development, SNAFU is kinda like a new & improved Haganai

She even looks like Yukino.

**The Good** Katanagatari, or more obscurely, Denpa teki na Kanojo. The first is heavily stylized, artistic, unique, and has an amazing story and plot. the second one reminds me of something Q. Tarintino would make if he directed anime

**The Bad:** Girls Bravo (my first anime/cultureshock) and Kono Naka ni Hitori (a true crapfest)

**The Ugly:** [Kaiji](http://i.imgur.com/s4lhKl.jpg) (need I say more?)
>> ARTICLE
But Kaiji is beautiful, the art is unique and different from other anime and that's what makes it stand out. 
>> ARTICLE
the show's great, its just that the cast is exclusively made up of ppl who are ugly as dick
>> ARTICLE
> I know I'm gonna get alot of hate for this but I straight up hate White Album 2 and I honestly dont exactly know why. 

[](#dekotableflip)

Were you expecting it to be a more musical anime than romdrama? Actually curious, because it is my favorite romance anime.
>> ARTICLE
No not really but I guess I just dont like fighting over a boyfriend/girlfriend. Yeah that sound kinda vague but I can't really give a good explanation to why i hated it.
>> ARTICLE
most people like it since it was emotionally charged, and for having a realistic take on relationships in general

Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien may be more up your alley. There isnt any fighting over bf/gf (then again, that didnt happen in WA2 either..) and has a very interesting premise
>> ARTICLE
I've been planning to watch Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien I just dont know when yet. Maybe I'll binge watch it in a slow moving week or something.

The Good - Steins;Gate

The Bad - Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara

The Ugly - Sword Art Online
>> ARTICLE
The good: The Tatami Galaxi for obvious reasons.

The Bad (like really really bad): Mirai Nikki. Just no. People involved shouldn't be allowed near anime studios by law.

The Ugly: One Piece. Can't watch a series where every single character that's introduced is even uglier than the previous.
>> ARTICLE
Why did you dislike Mirai Nikki?
>> ARTICLE
I can't find any single reason not to. It literally fails in every thing it tries to do. And it doesn't even try to do much for starters.
>> ARTICLE
**The Good:** The Tatami Galaxy. I don't think many things will be able to compare to this series, unique and amazing from start to finish.

**The Bad:** Sword Art Online. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't think it is *horrible*, because if it was I would have just dropped it (I drop anything that doesn't seem like it would even get a 6). But this one had a lot of potential and it let it all go to waste. Definitely the worst I've finished, but then again, I've only finished good series.

**The Ugly:** Ping Pong the Animation. It seriously doesn't get uglier than this. Even DEEN employees can draw straighter lines. That does not make this show bad though. Its ugly art style also made it endearing in a way and it definitely fit the show's characters and plot.
>> ARTICLE
**The Good:** Neon Genesis Evangelion, one of the only shows that does a perfect job of portraying the psychology and delicacy/fragility of humans.  
  
  **The Bad:** Sword Art Online, never thought I'd get cancer this way.  
  
  **The Ugly:** Log Horizon, just ew, the character designs are just so bad.
>> ARTICLE
The good: Neon Genesis Evangelion (lots of amazing moments and imagery.)

The bad: Aldnoah Zero (annoying characters and a pretty lacklustre plot. Plus the ending of S1 was ruined by S2)

The ugly: Sidonia no Kishi (not a bad show but the characters look bad because of the CG animation)
>> ARTICLE
How does an anime like The World of Golden Eggs even get that much sales? 

Furthermore, how does this go for more than $10 with what seems to be a low budget web series?
>> ARTICLE
Probably tells you just how insanely niche anime is in Japan.

What I wanna know Is wtf is it that it got released in 2005 yet is beating Eva in sales

With the gap between Monogatari S2 and Attack on Titans closing, what's the chance of Monogatari taking over as the best selling series of 2013?
>> ARTICLE
It probably won't take over, unless Titan crashes. If I understand analysts correctly, Monogatari will be extremely consistent, i.e. it will probably hover around pretty much the same number until the end.

However, and on that note, it's not guaranteed that Titan will be consistent. If everyone suddenly loses interest in it, the average may drop enough to allow Monogatari to take over, but that's very unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
It's the other way round, Monogatari will be extremely inconsistent sales wise. Kabukimonogatari will outsell Nekomonogatari: Shiro by a huge margin but Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari are set to sell not that well. So Monogatari will almost certainly outsell Titan temporarily when the Kabukimonogatari sale results are out, but in the end the numbers will probably be not that far from its current numbers.
>> ARTICLE
Your analysis got me curious, so I did a little digging and compiled the data and chart to comparing the two.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ajj_IfkmgvF0dEdXS1JXUG5qUlFVSG5XdVNWN3h6QWc&gid=10

Looks like your analysis is mostly on the mark.  The biggest issue hurting Monogatari's chance of a late come-back is the lack of a longtail (BD Multipler Monogatari 1.1 vs SnK 1.4).  There's a good chance that Monogatari S2 will end up winning the BD average, but its lack of DVD sales dooms any chance for the overall BD+DVD average.
>> ARTICLE
>but Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari are set to sell not that well

This is a case where the stalker is unreliable.  I know for at least one of the arcs, their volumes were at rank 2/3 during their first week instead of 1/2 because there was something else high profile that went up for pre-order around the same time they went up.  There's a huge difference between consistently 2nd and consistently first for a week points-wise, but it doesn't necessarily means the sales were that different if at all.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, thanks for the correction.

I should've remembered that the fact that it's split into arcs will cause some volumes to be more popular. I just went with the fact that v1 seemed to be extremely well predicted.
>> ARTICLE
Some surprises for me: I enjoyed Bakemonogatari but didn't expect it to be so high up on the list. When I think about it it sorta makes sense. It's one of the few harem shows that successfully convinces the viewer that the protagonist is justified in having an entourage of girls. Also, the dialogue sounds intelligent. Bascially it's wish fulfillment for a lot of otaku.

I didn't expect Madoka to be so high up either, but I guess it's due to Urobutcher's stellar writing. And, other than Nanoha, there's really no other show like it. It really filled a subgenre void.

Also, I thought Kyoani's powerhouse shows would be higher up on the list... which got me thinking, how would these shows fare if you included non-dvd sales like figurines?

Toshokan Sensou made it onto the list? I thought the show was charming but not compelling enough to rake in sales. Perhaps the work of the Fujoshi legion?

And finally, why is Umi ga Kikoeru on this list? Did it first air on TV despite being a Ghibli movie?

Anyway, glad to see Hataraku and SNAFU made it on from this season.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka would probably crush everybody (late-night) if we include figurines and other goodies. It even has its own monthly magazine/anthology where popular artists draws their fanfics/stories. Vol 11 just came out this year.

Latest figures for Madoka series was $400 million in 2012. Should easily top $600 million+ with the movie this year and goods that comes with it.

This week we had a lot of really great recommenations! No, seriously, I can't even pick top three threads. Each thread was amazing and I advise to at least skim through them. Would probably still lay special emphasis on [Zettai Shounen](http://redd.it/30poma) recommendation - it was superbly written and didn't receive enough attention.

However, I can choose anime. **Anime that I personally recommend to watch from this week**: [Nodame Cantabile](http://redd.it/31azak), [Mousou Dairinin](http://redd.it/30wu38), [Tekkon Kinkreet](http://redd.it/317r6x).

That said, I hope we will keep the high level of [WT!] threads later on! I really enjoyed this week and glad that I've read all these posts. And this all was after depressing last week when we had only six threads. I'm impressed. Keep it up, guys.

Anyway, thanks for stopping in this thread, and don't forget to leave the feedback!
>> ARTICLE
I second recommendation to read the post for Zettai Shounen. At the very least to read it for a very well throught out example of a watch this post. It's probably one of the best I have read on here. 
>> ARTICLE
I say this every week, but keep up the good work with these man!
>> ARTICLE
An interesting week! Put me down for posting something about Patlabor next week

Thanks again for putting these together. Would you mind putting me down for [Air](http://myanimelist.net/anime/101/Air) for this week?
>> ARTICLE
Can't tell if it's been done before (wish there was like a master list of ones done in the past. Maybe a google spreadsheet?)

I'll do one for [AnoHana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9989/Ano_Hi_Mita_Hana_no_Namae_wo_Bokutachi_wa_Mada_Shiranai.)

I can do that I think if I have enough spare time.

I'm almost done with the second season of **Chihayafuru** and I feel so compelled to write a WT! post for it. Unfortunately, I'm not the best critic/reviewer. I wrote a little blurb on my MAL profile page, but even with editing I don't think I would get it up to snuff. So I decided to just post it here as either an informal WT or to inspire someone else to write a reccommendation that the show deserves:

_________________________________
"The sound is great. It really helps to set the mood and enhance it. When particular tracks start to play, I can feel myself getting hyped.

The subject matter - karuta - is portrayed amazingly well. Such an obscure sport - it's a card game about centuries-old Japanese poems. And yet for something so foreign, the show explains all the intricacies of the sport so well that you really understand competitive karuta at a deeper level. The tournament matches create so much tension that sometimes I had to pause the episode to let myself calm down.

But the greatest thing about the show is the characters. I really can't do it justice. The backstories of the three MCs are well understood, so we can see how they affect the events of the present. Every character loves karuta in their own way - love poems resonate with them, the historical context takes them to another point in history, or they simply want to make their siblings proud. You also get to see how karuta changes them - not only do they start encorporating strategies used against them, and not only do they continue to refine their own playstyle, but everyone's personality is reflected in the way they play karuta. And as they grow as karuta players, they grow equally as characters and as humans.  

Also, the minor supporting characters (the kids from other schools, people from previous tournaments) are fleshed out very well. For every single character that I disliked from the start, I eventually grew to like them. The show puts you in the heads of all the characters, even those that are only in an episode or two. They no longer feel like an obstacle for the main characters overcome - they are given a backstory, a personality, hopes, dreams, and quirks. Everyone who appears on screen really comes alive. Every character is sympathetic and understandable - you can see a part of youself in everyone's head the show puts you into. And the minor characters will keep popping up sporadically, and you can really feel the sense of community that karuta creates. 

Also, no fanservice thankfully and the romance aspects are not intrusive, but fit well within the context of the story. [This last sentence is based on my own feelings about fanservice and about romance in shows that I don't watch for the romance.]"

Just look at some of the watch this posts for a template and go off that. I'm sure you can write a great post if you put a lot of time and effort into it.

>> ARTICLE
It aired prime-time and is a family friendly show. I don't think it's especially popular compared to other prime-time shows like Sazae-san or Doraemon, but It's much shorter so I can see it selling lots of dvd's as opposed to Sazae-san which has almost 7000 episodes.

I think it's supposed to be educational. It's to help learn English if I recall right. So that may be one reason.

huh. i guess the japanese didn't think it was a bad adaption...
>> ARTICLE
Woah this is so weird. I went to bed last night looking for these exact statistics, but couldn't find any. So, thanks!

Edit: Shouldn't Neko:Black be on this list? It's sold 60k+ last I checked.

Edit 2: Nevermind, it counts as a Special. Kinda crazy, though, if you count it, the combined -monogatari is almost 200,000. 
>> ARTICLE
It shouldn't count as a special, it aired on TV first
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I think it also aired on Nico at the same time? So I guess it's both. Maybe the difference is that it wasn't made for a specific time slot.
>> ARTICLE
>the combined -monogatari is almost 200,000. 
Remember that these are only average volume sales, not total sales. The sales per season  of monogatari have been decreasing over time.
>> ARTICLE
Why in the Seven Hells has Nanoha StrikerS sold more than A's?! Damnit Japan!
>> ARTICLE
because strikers TV version has [worse quality](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrHSLt71we4)
>> ARTICLE
Some interesting things I noticed:

For how much love Steins;Gate gets here, it's pretty low on that list - just beating out Chuu2, which at 15k is more than I was expecting. Also surprised to see Cowboy Bebop so low. Does that include US Sales?

I'm glad to see Love Live! and GuP up there. Someone already mentioned F/SN at 26k. I liked it. I'm glad it's up there.

Clannad > Clannad: After Story; lel. 

I know people like Bakemonogatari, but I'm surprised at a mammoth 78k. Is there a reason for that? Is it just that good? I've got it, I'm gonna watch it now.

*monogatari and Urobuchi slaughter. Holy cow.

It's cool to see how well the data fit a curve. http://i.imgur.com/LQdIW3s.jpg

10 of KyoAni's 18 TV series make that list.
>> ARTICLE
It is really good, but its high numbers have always confused me as well. To me, it doesn't really have the features some of these other shows on the list have, what you could think of as universal appeal. Maybe its uniqueness makes it stand out. Maybe the LN was insanely popular anyways, so it already had a solid fanbase. I'm curious to know.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone have a link to the last update?

Why has Yamato only just been added? It's had sales at pretty much that level since it went on sale last year.

Top of list seems dominated by recent releases and franchises, hm.

Also, had to look up The World of Golden Eggs, since this was my first time hearing of it.

Definitely interesting.
>> ARTICLE
>Top of list seems dominated by recent releases and franchises, hm.

That struck me as odd at first too, but then I realized that as DVDs became popular, cheaper to make, and cheaper to buy, home video sales went up a lot.

[] BoxOfficeMojo reported 5,557,907,165 for Eva 3.0 back in early February, but Bunka Tsushin reported 5,260,000,000 at close of theatrical release. As a Japanese source and a more recent source, I'm going to have to give Bunka Tsushin more credibility here. BoxOfficeMojo may be overly affected by changes in exchange rate as it's not clear how they calculate their totals.

Read the list in OP

> (2011) *52,133 Fate/Zero [ufotable]

> (2012) *45,804 Fate/Zero 2nd season [ufotable]


>> ARTICLE
The point I was trying to make was that I'm interested in seeing if the recently announced Unfotable Fate/Stay Night remake ends up selling more than Fate/Zero
>> ARTICLE
Huh, with all the hype that Haruhi got in 2006, I would've expected much higher sales. Did it all go into merchandizing?
>> ARTICLE
An average of 42K is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly didnt expect to see Bakemonogatari so high up. I knew it well recieved but whoa. Thats amazing.

I'm happy to see Hataraku Maou Sama doing well.
>> ARTICLE
When you consider that Nisemonogatari is also up there at 60k, and the Neko OVAs did really well too, the Monogatari series is actually a powerhouse selling series. I'm looking forward to hearing how the first volume of Season Season did, which released recently. 

And then you consider that Madoka is up there, and the movies did really well, it shows that Shaft and Shinbou might be considered the most successful anime team on the market currently. 

>> ARTICLE
I actually saw the sales for Nise before I'd ever seen Bake so I just assumed that Nise did better than Bake and never bothered to check just how well Bakemonogatari actually did.

How well did Neko do? Also Neko wasn't an OVA, it was a TV special. I think they aired all four episodes in one night and simulcasted them as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know it was a TV special. It tops the list at 56k. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Love Live outsold Jojo, an immensely popular franchise with a lot of content and history behind it. Though I guess it's not completely fair to compare the two since Jojo had 2 adaptations, with a third coming soon (with the third being the most popular). But I guess that just goes to show you the power of moe idols.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I can't wait to see the numbers after Part 3 comes out since it's what they live by over there.
>> ARTICLE
What the heck is "The World of Golden Eggs" lol, looks like a children's show which makes sense. 
On the list I'm surprised that SAO *only* sold 35k, thought it was more popular than that. 

SnK no surprise it's selling big. 

Madoka somewhat of a surprise I knew it was popular but not quite 71k popular.

I thought Haruhi would be near the top of the list but only 42k.

Wonder what it would take for a series to break 100k these days, would have to be immensely popular and/or have a lot of volumes.
>> ARTICLE
>What the heck is "The World of Golden Eggs" lol, looks like a children's show which makes sense. 

It's not. It's an adult short (one of the episodes revolved around 2 teens fucking in the bushes at school). Very much like Robot Chicken's story style but there are no cultural jokes. Just plain datsuryoku-kei comedy. Occasionally there is a live-action cooking segment reminiscent of the one from Tentai Senshi Sunred. 

It aired on MTV in Japan so think about American MTV cartoons and that should give you an easier picture.



>> ARTICLE
Why am i not surprised?
>> ARTICLE
Fate series sucks anyway. I don't get how someone from the West can stomach the horribly interpreted Western themes.

I'm sorry, I know it's dickish to hate on things, but I can only take so much inundation of this show's praises.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how much experience you have with the fate series, but having played the visual novels I can safely say I have no idea what "western themes" you are talking about. If you are just talking about pulling from western legends like King Aurthur and whatnot, then 1 those are not themes, and 2 you could not be more wrong. 

But yeah the anime sucks pretty hard. Did almost nothing right.
>> ARTICLE
You're nitpicking over a word that's not even really even wrong. The interpretations at least in the anime were really shallow, as well.
>> ARTICLE
Everything in the anime was really shallow. The anime was really shallow. The VN gives character profiles to each of the servants and explains how they are affected by being summoned. Forcing them into a class alters them from their historical/mythological selves in various ways. Additionally they are strongly affected by how people remember their legend, rather than actual fact. 

They give a lot more depth and characterization to each of them, and delve more into the legends they are from.
>> ARTICLE
I see, so the problem I mentioned is probably not there in the VN.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing I read was your tl;dr lol.
But I'm gonna be watching it as soon as I finish Valkyria Chronicles.  Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
> The only thing I read was your tl;dr lol

I don't blame you one bit :P But you're very welcome! I hope you enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
Really great series (I scored it 8/10).

But for some reason Hagumi really annoyed me as a character... I don't even know why since she is fairly similar to Shiina from [Sakurasou no pet na kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo) . They are essentially the same character (Little blonde girl who is an amazing artist but is frankly autistic and barely speaks) but one I absolutely loved and the other pissed me off :/ Is it just me?

Thank god for Morita, he was the reason I didn't drop the show and I'm glad I didn't.
>> ARTICLE
Ok you've successfully convinced me to watch this, I'm a sucker for SOL/dramas anyways so I hope I'll enjoy it.  
Thanks for the amazing write up, it's really great that anime can have such a lasting impact on us, only goes to remind why I keep coming back to the medium for more.
>> ARTICLE
> Ok you've successfully convinced me to watch this, I'm a sucker for SOL/dramas anyways so I hope I'll enjoy it

YAY! I'm honoured that I was a factor in that decision :P


>> ARTICLE
Fair warning: as another poster in the comments mentioned, it's very slow. This makes the show hit-or-miss with people. The best I can say is to just go with the flow and don't get anxious waiting for something to happen.. since, if you do get impatient with it, you might not be able to appreciate it in the same way OP has.

If you're able to get through that without feeling too bothered, it really is a great show. My takeaway from it is.. the melancholy of relationships. (It's been a long time since I've seen it though, maybe I'll give it a rewatch!)
>> ARTICLE
I have no slow problems with a slow pace, Hyouka is my favourite anime of all time :)  
However, I'll keep your advice in mind 
>> ARTICLE
I loved this series too, it really personally affected me. But in kind of a motivational way. MC on his "finding himself" bike trip really inspired me to do some self searching of my own. 
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Your Lie in April and Afterstory so I was looking for a pick-me-up, I'll give this a shot
>> ARTICLE
[The box scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvDgMKapfsE) is definitely my favorite moment in any anime ever.

(The scene doesn't contain any spoilers)
>> ARTICLE
hagu ruined the show for me.

that being said i still enjoyed it. takemoto's journey especially.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who also loved Honey and Clover and its characters, I thought your post was excellent (I did read the whole thing).  You really broke down the main themes of the anime and showed why they are so meaningful.  Nice work!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for actually reading! I was afraid no one would because of how ridiculously long it is haha
>> ARTICLE
Haha you're very welcome.  It was a great read!  
>> ARTICLE
guessing by your 10s to anohana and garden of words, it's probably easy to emotionally wreck you. 
>> ARTICLE
Um tl;dr just skimmed through. But really? I've got the DVD set of the entire first season, one if the first DVDs I got, but I've never been able to make it past like the fourth episode or so. It's just too slow, even for a slice of life. BTW, Sol is my favorite genre, so it's not like I'm not into that. I don't know, maybe i was expecting something like Kimi to Boku. Which is one of my favorite shows of all time, and made me experience all the same feels you're experiencing now.

I may give Honey Clover another chance. Who knows, maybe it'll end up becoming one of my favorites too. Happened with Hanasaku Iroha. I put that hold for more than a year, and then one day forced myself to sit thorough three episodes. Before i knew it, I'd binged one whole cour.
>> ARTICLE
tl;dr OP gave the show and its sequel 9/10 and seemed to really like them.

Personally, they're an easy 10/10 (IMO) putting them on even terms with Clannad After Story, 5cm per second, Infinite Ryvius (ffs someone watch this show) and Shirobako.
>> ARTICLE
5cm is the most boring anime ever made. Stunning but boring. Never heard about Infinite Ryvius. I'll keep it in mind.
>> ARTICLE
> Um tl;dr just skimmed through

Yeahhhhhh sorry about that. After I finished unloading my mind I was shocked by how long it was! That's why I put the TL;DR at the top :P

> I may give Honey Clover another chance

Please do! It took me a couple episodes to get into, especially since I couldn't take Hagu seriously at first owing to her character design and equally childish manner. But I feel like character development and the (relatively) realistic depictions of the complexities in relationships make up for the shaky start.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, i remember thinking the same about Hagu too. And you should definitely watch Kimi to Boku. It's got a similar character to Hagu as well. All the characters are pretty amazing actually.
>> ARTICLE
> you should definitely watch Kimi to Boku

I already have, and I liked it as well (although perhaps not as much as  Hachimitsu to Clover haha). Thanks for the recommendation!
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's great. Isn't Mary just adorable? Btw, looks like enough people are interested in the show, so why don't you host a Rewatch. It'll give people an excuse to jump on the show, and discourage them (me) from dropping it midway. 
>> ARTICLE
Now that's an idea! I'll take a look at how busy February is for rewatches
>> ARTICLE
I'll have to disagree with the others on this.. if you found 5cm/s boring and you couldn't continue Honey and Clover in your first try, I don't think it's the show for you. Unlike Hanasaku Iroha, which has a lot of big ups and downs, Honey and Clover's pacing is pretty consistently slow all throughout its two seasons. If you found yourself more annoyed with the show than you were enjoying it, I don't think there's much else that the show can offer you.

.. and there's nothing wrong with that, by the way. Honey and Clover is a particular show I've noticed people either really like or really hate, based on whether or not it clicked for them. It's a show you have to be patient with, since it isn't going to make an effort to try and keep your attention.
>> ARTICLE
how long until this show gets good? I remember watching several episodes and it wasn't really interesting.
>> ARTICLE
i was gonna watch this but looking into it finding 'love triangles' i cant be bothered  
i just hate them
>> ARTICLE
Honey and Clover is easily one of my favorite SOL shows (and favorite shows in general), and its always nice to hear other people praise it. I watched it like three years ago, and the ending still makes me cry like a baby.

Basically, this is the list of every show that has sold over 10,000 copies, which is considered the marking of a large success. 

Card Captor Sakura was highlighted because of the positioning at the bottom of the list. All the series that are moving up the list are from the last year (2012-13, anyway), except Card Captor. It was released in 1998, yet it's moved up! Very impressive!

I'm still a little confused and new to this, what does average mean exactly? Are these numbers the total sales since the shows came out?  Also how come One Piece and Naruto Arent up there, but Bleach.

, I did a little research, and as I understand it now, These # are average sales per year per volume since the respective vol. Came out, right?   (So, f.e. This means that each Evangelion DVD/BE has sold a total amount of ~20million? Holy Shit)
>> ARTICLE
111k x 20 is two million not twenty

Oh god, you are right, wrote that really late, sorry.
>> ARTICLE
That makes more sense, I would prefer a chart with the total amount of each anime sold.

I don't understand what is meant by "average". Is it an average over the number of years?

No idea how a few of these are so high, especially The world of Golden Eggs?!?!

I'll selfishly nominate a show that is on my to-watch list:

**[Tokyo Magnitude 8.0](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6211/Tokyo_Magnitude_8.0)**

> The premise of the project is the 70% possibility that a magnitude 7.0 earthquake will occur in Tokyo in the next 30 years. The anime depicts what would happen if an 8.0 earthquake took place.

Aired in 2009, an eerie prelude to the 2011 Thoku Earthquake (which was stronger than the one depicted in this anime). It's got a reputation as a tearjerker (not surprising for a disaster drama) and is told heavily through the eyes of young children.
>> ARTICLE
Gonna have to nominate something from my PTW as well.

[House of Five Leaves](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?id=7588)
>Masterless samurai Akitsu Masanosuke is a skilled and loyal swordsman, but his nave, diffident nature has time and again caused him to be let go by the lords who have employed him. Hungry and desperate, he becomes a bodyguard for Yaichi, the charismatic leader of a gang called Five Leaves. Although disturbed by the gangs sinister activities, Masa begins to suspect that Yaichis motivations are not what they seem. And despite his misgivings, the deeper hes drawn into the world of the Five Leaves, the more he finds himself fascinated by these devious, mysterious outlaws. 

To me the concept of a samurai based anime that takes a much more serious and realistic tone seems to be very interesting. Seems like something that would be able to give a slightly more intelligent feel than others.
>> ARTICLE
Nominating Mononoke.  

A wandering merchant exorcises with various spirits he encounters. Part mystery and a bit of suspense/horror, the merchant uses his knowledge of the supernatural to fend off the mononoke until he can learn the spirit's shape (Katachi), truth (Makoto) and reasoning (Kotowari). Only then can he unsheathe his sword and exorcise the demon.  

Among other things it has a very unique art and storytelling style. 
>> ARTICLE
I nominate [The Tatami Galaxy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei).

>When a college dropout stops for a late night bite at a mysterious ramen stand, he crosses paths with a self-proclaimed deity of matrimony. This bizarre meeting sends the young man hurtling through a horrifying flashback to his not-so-glorious college days when the influence of a cruel new friend turned him from a hopeless romantic into a mischievous black cupid.

It seems like a really intriguing show that could generate a lot of discussion.
>> ARTICLE
/r/anime, I want us to watch [Usagi Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10162/Usagi_Drop) together.
>When Daikichi's grandfather dies he leaves behind a young daughter named Rin. However, as most of the family is embarrassed at the idea of a 79-year-old man having a six-year-old child, they can't seem to figure out what to do with her. Disgusted by this behavior, Daikichi decides to take care of her himself, but he's a bachelor, has no idea how to raise a child, and isn't even all that comfortable with kids! Now, Daikichi must do the normal things a parent does such as enroll her in school, buy her clothing and teach her about the life and world around her. But more importantly, he must also help her deal with her father's death and decide whether or not she should try to find her mother. Together, the two begin their unlikely relationship as father and daughter, navigating each of life's bumps along the way.

There's a number of pretty good noitaminA series out there, so why this particular one? Admittedly, I could've picked a more obscure one, but forgive me my somewhat selfish choice of nominating the one I sincerely think is probably the best of the lot. Usagi Drop will charm you, possibly make your eyes leak a bit, make you reflect on potentially/currently being a parent and just plain leave you feeling satisfied when it's over. Let's expand our hearts together.
>> ARTICLE
I love Usagi drop, but I'm not sure what the point of having a rewatch thread dedicated to it would be.  There wouldn't really be much to talk about...
>> ARTICLE
I would not nominate something if I did not think it would lend itself to discussion, as that would be rather pointless. I can think of certain types of shows that would be a bad idea for the club, such as gag comedies. Usagi Drop, however, is not something I think is such a show. When you say there would not be much to discuss, I have to wonder where this comes from. Is it a lack of imagination on your part? Is the show itself not conducive to discussion? And ultimately, what is this club? When we nominate a show, what are we seeking? I have some ideas on the matter (and this gets a bit broader than your specific post, but is still largely focused on it).

1) Were not necessarily seeking a good show, but an interesting one. Since were putting it to popular vote this probably wont happen, but it would be completely in the spirit of the club to pick a show that most people here would not actually enjoy as a show. Theres plenty to be said about why something did not work, but thats not the full extent of the potential for such a show. The show may not be enjoyable, but can still serve as a font for larger discussion. If all that was relevant was finding an enjoyable show, this would be a simpler process and the club would just be an inefficient version of /r/animesuggest.

2) What, then, constitutes an interesting show? For the purposes of the club, I would have to assume it is something we can discuss. Theres not really much else we can do in this club, after all. What are we capable of discussing? So far, it seems weve been able to discuss [philosophy and social commentary](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1dvokb/anime_club_watch_3_serial_experiments_lain_13/), hardly a subject with doubts about its discussion potential. The club has taken a show infamous for seeming lewd, and used it as a springboard to discuss [intimacy in anime and the use of the anicamera](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1dow5n/anime_club_watch_2_nisemonogatari_811_tsukihi/). Weve also found discussion in a show largely about [romance and character relations](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1avfcx/anime_club_watch_1_spice_and_wolf_episodes_14/). I wonder, does Usagi Drop offer any less than that? It may not be as complex as Lain, granted, but is the tale of an unexpected single father reshaping his life to raise his adopted child and their mutual growth any less discussable than Spice and Wolf or Nisemonogatari?

3) You might note that, disappointingly, all the examples I pointed to are indeed extant, but they never quite gave way to long, winding dialogues or horizon-expanding discourse. However, what would? Thats not exactly a trait Reddit is known for. If theres a show you think would work better in that regard, please do nominate it.

4) But couldnt we find *something* to say about almost anything, even the aforementioned gag comedies? Just because some words can be said doesnt mean that a show is a good choice. Otherwise the club discussions might as well be the same as the new episode discussion threads, with people posting gifs and brief reactions.

4a) Should they not be? Our obvious conclusion is that we want shows we can discuss. Whats not as obvious is what we want these discussions to look like. Should they be largely top level comments that seek to critically analyze a work? Should they be simple and brief statements of I liked/didnt like aspect X because of reason Y? I think both have a place. Not everything needs to be an essay on the applicability of points raised in Kants Transcendental Aesthetic to the anime being discussed, for example. But such a post shouldnt be discouraged, either.

4b) So what we want is something conducive to both types of posts. Weve established that Usagi Drop is, arguably, no less conducive to both types of posts than Nisemonogatari or Spice and Wolf. Serial Experiments Lain would seem more suited to the more elaborative posts, but has seen discussion rates consistent with the *monogatari watch.

4c) Why has Lain not lead to either more or less discussion? Is it because Lain is a heavily watched series? Is this simply as active as the club is wont to get? Is it complex enough to open up these more elaborative discussions, but too complex for most people to actually attempt to discuss? I do not know. Most people dont spend the time to state why theyre not posting.

5) I cannot see how Usagi Drop is not in the spirit of the club. Presuming the spirit of the club is to discuss shows, Usagi Drop seems no less open to potential discussion than any show which was chosen before it. It is possible that all three previously chosen shows were bad picks and that much more discussable shows were failed by the democratic process, and that picking Usagi Drop would represent another failure of the clubs current voting system rather than people selecting which show they would most want to discuss. But thats firmly in the realm of hypotheticals. Still, its actually quite reasonable to suggest theres a trend for people to vote for the anime theyd like to watch rather than the ones that would be good for discussion (see Nichijou nearly beating out Bakemonogatari. I think Nichijou is a great show, but gag comedies provide very limited opportunity to open up substantive discussion). But then, the recent changes (themes, barring the 100 most popular) are meant to curb that somewhat. Although even thats not perfect. When the top 100 were barred, the club still picked the most popular title from amongst the nominated ones (Lain). Which is not to say that a bad choice was made, but its an interesting note, at least, even if it doesnt yet prove that people will still cluster around the most popular anime (although a popular vote selecting something popular isnt really a surprise).

But, ultimately, Im just one woman nominating what she thinks would be a good choice and the above is my rationale. You still might disagree that Usagi Drop is a good choice, of course. By all means, if Im the only one who thinks she would have something worthwhile to say about this, then I trust you and others will not vote for it. But I did not put it up just because I think it is an enjoyable show, nor would I expect the club to select it on those grounds.

[**Kuuchuu Buranko (Trapeze)**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6774/Kuuchuu_Buranko)

>Many patients with different problems visit the psychiatric ward of Irabu General Hospital: a trapeze artist suffering from insomnia after suddenly failing his jumps, a gangster afraid of knives and sharp objects and a business man who has an erection 24 hours a day. They undergo counseling by Dr. Ichiro Irabu, who is the child-like son of the hospital director. His assistant is the sullen faced sexy nurse Mayumi. With his mysterious injections, and advice that does not make sense, Dr. Irabu confuses his patients. But at the end of his unique treatments, the patients are led to digging further into their souls to find peace of mind.

This series is very different from most other anime. Between the psychological nature of its content, the way all of its single-episode arcs intersect, and its unique visual style, there should be a lot of interesting things to talk about.

Guilty Crown is widely considered terrible.

Natsuyuki Rendezvous was watched by nearly no one and pretty much no one who watched it thought it was very good.

Eden of the East and Robotics;Notes are two I personally consider to be very disappointing from having watched them.
>> ARTICLE
I'm working on Natsuyuki and I like it so far, as of four episodes, but it's too heavy for me to watch on a regular basis. The main character is REALLY dame-ningen.

I agree that Eden of the East was a bit disappointing considering the strength of its first several episodes. It had the potential to be really great but ended up only good. noitaminA has aired quite a few better shows, for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Eden of the East is only bad if you actually watch the godawful movies.
>> ARTICLE
Eden of the East was not half as clever or exciting as its premise made it sound. The show in general was the most pedestrian and badly-concluded conspiracy anime I think I've ever seen. It didn't explore any of the details it brought up in depth, and details that didn't get any resolution at all are all over the place. The ending was exasperatingly dumb. They prioritized the romance between Akira and Saki, which would have been a lot better if Saki were less of a self-insert.

I didn't watch the movies because I heard they were even worse; whether they provide any resolution I don't know.

It's probably because Idolmaster is more known for the games than the anime and the anime is just a by-product of its popularity. While Love Live is a manga which means it originally has no sounds and people prefers the one with music

Hellsing Ultimate is more like 30 episodes with its 1 hour runtime, same with Katanagatari and 24 eps.

Yes, Gintama, HxH, FMA:BH, Monster, DBZ, Bakuman, Code Geass, Durarara are among my favorites.

Did you read the rules I used for the list?

Half the point of the list was to remove second seasons of things from the top, because they require the time investment.  If the first season still does well then it's in the list because it's standalone, which second seasons are not.  
>> ARTICLE
But then, why would you include second seasons for some shows but not others? At the point, the 40 episode thing becomes a very arbitrary guideline.
>> ARTICLE
You're not even following your own rules m8
>> ARTICLE
> Rule 1: No anime longer than 40 episodes. Period.

Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show. 
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show.

I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point.  If people want to continue after that, that's their decision, but all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.  But that's ok.  I'm going to remake the list taking into account all this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point. If people want to continue after that, that's their decision,

truly, if this is your interpretation of your rules then your list doesn't make any sense. Everybody can continue or stop after ~40 episodes of anything (first season or not), they don't need your misguided list for that.

>  all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.

> Code Geass, Attack on Titan, Chihayafuru on the list

ok, so what you do is claiming it's enough to call something a 'first season' to make it stand alone. Because these three very clearly don't have any resolution in the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Well is certainly my fault for not explaining the purpose well.  The overarching goal was to remove incredibly long running shows, but more importantly to remove sequel bias within the context of show length.  So all these shows that are not only long, but also contain a huge score jump in the second season tend to dominate the list quite a bit. A guy a while ago made a combined season list which averaged scores, and that was awesome, but didn't necessarily remove what I feel is the heavy score bias from familiarity that plagues the top 100.   But anyway, is a moot point now. Intentions are meaningless.

>Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, absolutely. Except for Hyouka, all of my top 5 shows have more than 50 episodes. I also freaking love JJBA, One Piece and a lot more.

I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

Longer shows have a better chance to properly explore the setting and the characters and you can get easier attached to them as well. I also prefer slower pacing way more than to fast pacing, but that's just me.

Anyways, thanks for the work.
>> ARTICLE
> I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

I was having a discussion with a buddy of mine about this.  We've both read the Wheel of Time series, which is good, but a massive time investment.  There are a lot of good, long running shows and if I'd started them at the time it would be fine, but trying to jump in now...not sure it's worth the time.
>> ARTICLE
When i was new to anime, i was actually sad that there were so few long shows. I was in Post Anime Depression after FMA:B was my first proper anime(that i knew was anime and intentionally sought out), worse was it after doing HxH up to the airing episode (119 iirc.) in a week. Felt like i'd never find anything like them again, and i really haven't had a lot anime past that point be either. So long ones are good, as long as you don't get stuck in Naruto/Bleach fillers. Skip those if they don't please you, that's what i do. 

HxH probably has the best pacing imo. (Chimera arc exempt, that one was a bit slower IIRC.) To me, the first 20 episodes felt like 50, and in a positive way. For some reason, the 2 minute episode situation that a lot of good shows have didn't happen in HxH, though i'm not sure why. It's wasn't a bad thing, i enjoyed those long good paced episodes because they felt so filled. 

As a side note, to me, HxH was great from the beginning, so i understand that for those that didn't like it as much at the beginning, might have felt different about this.

Higurashi (when they cry) has a second season which pushes it to 50 episodes total. (+ several ovas, 6 of which counts as a third season)  
  
I guess you can see the first season only, but 90% of the plot of the first season is explained in the second season. It's a bit weird to only include the first season on the list, since the story doesn't make much sense without the second season to back it up. 

If I was to pick anime from a list like this, I would rather have all the shows included be 40 or less, including all relevant sequels. If I want a short anime, I don't want to discover later that there are actually two more seasons that weren't listed just to keep the episode count down. 

That's just my opinion though!

I thought you made a pun on the title so I was staring at it for a minute to see what you changed.

This is gonna be the most useless comment but you could also just say "Anohana"...

not useless... but at least this way people can look it up! :3

Why is this happening? The first season didn't do nearly that well.

Also, what's the show about?
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching the show this week, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I know:

Uta no Prince-Sama (Shortened to Utapri) is the best selling Otome franchise currently on the market with a total of 7 games (2-3 of them being rhythm games, the others are dating sims), Drama CDs, music CDs, manga, and other merch. 

It's about Haruka Nanami, a girl who's dream is to compose music for her favorite idol. In the games, you play as Nanami and eventually start a romance with one of the boys. There are six main male characters, all of which have their own unique styles and personalities, and a seventh is introduced officially in Season 2. Later games, you can also branch out to their rival group for more dating possibilities.

Being a female anime fan, it's refreshing to see an otome game get it's own series and with all of the harem animes around, (which sure, I still love those too) it's a nice change of pace. I think the series can be summed up as female fanservice. The characters are relatively well developed, but it's entirely a girl's fantasy anime. 

I could be mistaken, but I believe the sales are incredibly high because they included concert tickets? It's something I saw said in another thread, so I don't know first-hand. I do know the franchise is very popular in Japan, and has somewhat of a cult following of girls and women. It wouldn't surprise me if they wanted to complete their collections of CDs, manga, and games with the anime series.

All in all, it's fun to watch and some of the music is really good. Having no previous knowledge of the franchise; Season 2 is a lot better than Season 1. 


>> ARTICLE
it's selling so well because the first volume has a lottery ticket you need to try and get tickets to the live event at saitama super arena

expect the second volume to sell less than half this figure
>> ARTICLE
Thanks. That makes a lot of sense.

>UtaPri 54,000 initial average...highest A1 pictures show overtaking SAO

Whoa Persona 4 was that high? (Right next to AnoHana as well). Didn't know the anime could sell that well.

>> ARTICLE
never noticed this before but..

>(2006) *15,021Death Note [Madhouse]

surprisingly low. i thought it was a subculture phenomenon but i guess its popularity had to bleed out over more years..
>> ARTICLE
It was very successful once it was brought to the US, which theses sales numbers do not include.
>> ARTICLE
... Never even heard a thing about those gold eggs and it's no1??? What gives?

Does this mean One Piece sells far less DVDs than Bleach? Lame!

I'm sorry, in that case I really do apologize. I just have been getting tired of so many recommendation threads, but I realize it's not my place to be telling people to take them exclusively to animesuggest.
>> ARTICLE
But that place is too small.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that's too bad.
>> ARTICLE
If you want to watch romance/drama then there's Nagi no Asukara and Golden Time still airing now. 

If you want a good combination of action and comedy in a sci-fi/fantasy setting you should watch the Toaru Majutsu no Index series and its spin-off series Toaru Kagaku no Railgun.

If you want to watch romance/action with fantasy then there's Shakugan no Shana.

And if you want to watch Romance/Drama/Action then there's Guilty Crown.

Why talk about the PV now, since [gg] released the first episode yesterday?
>> ARTICLE
Anohana lasts half as much because it doesn't waste time in nonesense slice of life moments that have nothing to do with the plot. But they end in a pretty similarly supernatural and forced way.
>> ARTICLE
AnoHana is more serious, and it has great character development.

What is it about :) ?

A group of friends trying to move on from a tragic event
>> ARTICLE
On behalf of almost anyone who's watched anime, Clannad ~AfterStory~.
>> ARTICLE
The "obvious" answer is here as expected.
>> ARTICLE
* Clannad:Afterstory had me full on bawling, more then teary-eyed, I couldn't stop crying at some points.

* Angel beats got me pretty hard with the ending.

* Monogatari Series Second Season.... fuck me... THAT episode had me in tears. I tried my best to hold them back.. [Spoilers](/s "Episode 20, where Hachikuji had a tearful farewell with Araragi...")

* Little Busters: Refrain, I haven't caught up with it in recent weeks, but god damn I can't handle some parts.

* Steins;Gate: Fuck the suspense nearing the end of the series... holy shit it was done so well in my opinion. The tears hit me big at some points.
>> ARTICLE
I have a particular weakness for Shinkai films. I for some reason end up crying or at least tearing up while watching most of his works. [The Garden of Words](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16782/Kotonoha_no_Niwa) and [Someone's Gaze](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17121) got me pretty good. 

I still haven't watched 5cm Per Second because I know it's going to get me upset, and I haven't felt like feeling that way lately.

AMVs are a horrible way to get someone to watch a series, some of them are absolutely filled with the most blatant spoilers in the series. One look at that Toradora! AMV you posted would ruin some big events in the show. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't write of all AMVs like that, I've added quite a few shows to my plan to watch just from seeing a cool action sequence or something of the sort in AMVs. It really just depends on what the show is and how the AMV is edited. For example the "Into the Labyrinth" AMV of Bakemonogatari that the OP posted is a great way to show others the Shaft visuals and surrealism in the series. 
>> ARTICLE
I think these are better selections: 

* *Kyoukai no Kanata* - ["Unconditional"](https://youtu.be/1GvLbPDLJDs)   
* *Wolf's Rain* - ["I Will Not Bow"](http://youtu.be/DVSqLT7g230) (Major Spoilers, though) 

Also, you're missing:

*Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!*  - ["If I Had You | Leather and Skirt"](https://youtu.be/1ArWgZuoB7g)

Good way to spoil Zankyou no Terror.
