After watching the series, I am more inclined to just feed Banri to the zombies and run away.

Ghost Banri controls the weather. You might not be as screwed as you think.

In this boat. But at least he'll occasionally be fabulous.

Maybe we'll finally see that boat that goes into space o.o

now this is a question for OP - would Shinobu tag along in his shadow? or does that not count? :p

I just started Monogatari Second Series, and I'm still in the first arc where Hanekawa is the focus. Do I still get Araragi? Or do I get Hanekawa?

How are you even planing to get him out of his house?

Just stay inside and watch tv. Best zombie plan. His apartment is your Winchester and wait for it all to blow over.

And you can raid Yamazaki's for bodypillows to keep you company. Sounds better than real life.

Kill la Kill, so the (naked?) zombie apocalypse will be taken care of. Thanks, Ryuko!

I think he would be all like "the zombies are the only ones that can understand me. They feel the pain of solitude. Of not having someone to talk to. etc."

atleast I hope so! :D

Kaname Madoka.

I think the zombie apocalypse will be fine, I'm a little worried about what'll replace it though.

[You get to cheat a little ](/s " Homura could be considered as the actual the main character.")

>> ARTICLE
The great thing is the last anime i watched was the 3rd movie so there no argument who the main character was.

Oh goddammit. Neon Genesis Evangelion. I can feed Shinji to the zombies, right? 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely, and make sure to applaud afterwards.

>> ARTICLE
Congratul-BRAAAAAAAAINNSSSSS
>> ARTICLE
Seki-kun from *Tonari no Seki-kun*.

Well, that would certainly be an interesting couple of days.
>> ARTICLE
Knowing him, he'd develop some contraption to fly you to safety. 
>> ARTICLE
You'd die for sure when you're too distracted at your desk to notice the zombies.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, but I'd argue that Yokoi is the real MC so I think she'd end up being pretty helpful. She's pretty level headed after all.
>> ARTICLE
Level-headed...? Are we watching the same show? She goes full-on chaos mode when the kid next to her plays a board game.

Still would be fun though, provided she doesn't get distracted when running away.
>> ARTICLE
Well...
At least Akarin can live in peace unnoticed

I, on the other hand, would be dead
>> ARTICLE
Ichijo Raku... Well i guess he could protect me by seducing the zombies by offering every single one a key and promising to marry them
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass

So either really good or really bad, depending on how expendable I am in Lelouch's eyes. 

Would geass work on zombies?
>> ARTICLE
You could create an army of slave survivors.   
>> ARTICLE
**Toaru Kagaku No Railgun**

I think I'm pretty safe with Misaka and her level 5 Esper power.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, this is probably one of the best ones you could get. Her electricity powers work WONDERS for everything, like lighting, cooking with it, turning on all electronics including cars, etc. She can sense people coming towards you with her electromagnetic radar type thing, and just wreck all the zombies with her powers. Hell, the show doesn't do a good job at portraying this, but the level 5 espers have the power to literally destroy entire armies, so the zombies would be of no real problem, nor would normal people.

The best part too, alongside all of her useful powers, she's a VERY loyal friend, to the point of consistently putting her life in grave danger to save friends, and others, along with being a really nice friend to talk to and keep you company when there aren't many humans around. So unlike some other powerful options, you never have to worry about Misaka backstabbing you unless you give her a reason to by backstabbing her. I mean someone like Hellsing would keep you safe from the zombies, but I would NOT feel safe at all with that guy around me, and he wouldn't really be the best person to talk to.

So in my opinon, Misaka is probably one of the best options out there.
>> ARTICLE
uh huh.. just don't try being witty or romantic around her cause her tsundere side will shock you good.
>> ARTICLE
Now I want to watch that show.
>> ARTICLE
Hikari from Nagi No Asukara...

I have no idea if I'll survive. He'll probably end up saving me somehow
>> ARTICLE
You'll probably be eaten as he escapes into the sea.

That or he saves you through the power of LOVE!
>> ARTICLE
I rewatched Fate/Zero. This would be a fucking peace of cake, no matter which character you would consider the main (because it basicly has no real MC)
>> ARTICLE
You get Waver. Have fun :P
>> ARTICLE
man, the Waver in the last episode? Hell yes!!

intelligent man with as sense of duty, and knows how to do magic. :D
>> ARTICLE
Supported by Rider, Waver was one of my favorite characters by the end.
>> ARTICLE
i think that [fate](/s "arguably, kiritsugu is the main character") so you'd probably be in pretty good hands.

But if he gets bitten hes going to die by a stinger missile.

Kirito...Uh oh, don't think he'll be too useful...

Why not, he's the best swordsman right? 
>> ARTICLE
He's probably still in rehab mode
>> ARTICLE
Unless of course the zombie apocalypse is just virtual reality Left for Dead.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm finishing up Gurren Lagann so if that counts I'd say I have a slim chance of surviving unless giant mecha are available. It also depends on Kamina being around or not considering Simon needs inspiration to be of any use.

If that doesn't count, then it would be Engaged to the Unidentified. Pretty much screwed there.
>> ARTICLE
first half of the show simon, better hope kamina is there too.

second half of the show simon, [well...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkOek2loQlM) * **spoilers** *

edit: pardon the subs
>> ARTICLE
At least you'd die with a tier one waifu by your side? 
>> ARTICLE
Well, if Kamina is around you just have to put him into some old, run down car and let him do his thing.
>> ARTICLE
If Kamina is around you just have to stand back while he kills them with the shear pressure of his manliness

Inferno Cop. I think I'm pretty set.

**Ayumu Aikawa** 


well, this is awkward.
>> ARTICLE
That was my last watched anime too. I was close to watching Accel World before I got to this thread. Think that would be any better?
>> ARTICLE
brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
This put a big smile on my face
>> ARTICLE
I honestly don't know how helpful Ginko will be, maybe the zombies will turn out to be Mushi.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished the first [Kara no Kyoukai] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/2593/Kara_no_Kyoukai_1:_Fukan_Fuukei) movie, so I'd feel pretty safe with [Shiki] (http://myanimelist.net/character/3105/Shiki_Ryougi) covering my back. It would appear she has a power that shows her the most efficient way to kill things, and shes looks to be almost superhuman in combat. So I'd probably be okay in an apocalypse.
>> ARTICLE
Heheheh... You have no idea how fitting this is. Your trust is justified. 

>> ARTICLE
Ha, me too; we're both saved. Keep watching them and you'll realize just how saved you'd be from zombies if you had Shiki with you; killing zombies would be almost like her specialty.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished the second one. Colour me confused, I'm even more lost than I was after the first one.
>> ARTICLE
The first 4 movies jumps around in the timeline. The actual order of movies chronologically is 2 4 3 1 5 6 7. There is also a time skip between 2 and 4 of several years which is probably why things seems so confusing between the first two movies.
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry guys, I have [Superman Dumbledore](http://i.imgur.com/d4E5M6p.jpg) on my side.
>> ARTICLE
Me too. The plot armor only seems to work for him though...

I'd probably just try and get to another floating island. I mean, we got rifles with the power of railguns, so we should be just fine.
>> ARTICLE
Chuunibyou, I will be saved by the dark flame master :D
>> ARTICLE
RIP PoisonTurtles.

I don't exactly know which of the two I finished first, JoJo's Bizarre adventure or Welcome to the NHK, but it would have some mayor impact on my chance of survival.

Great get to chill with Shinji
>> ARTICLE
Holo/Horo from Spice & Wolf. I think I may be ok.
>> ARTICLE
But is she really the main character? The story is from Lawrence's point of view. That distinction could save or kill you.
>> ARTICLE
True, true. Well, if I had to go with Lawrence, then I might be fucked.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Lawrence would be fucking useless in a Zombie Apocalypse. 

"With all the Zombies beiing killed, prices for Ammo will probably explode, I should buy as much as I can, maybe short some furs and... OMG NO DONT EAT ME AHHHHHHH!"
>> ARTICLE
You kidding me? Not only would you be ok, but expect to make a tidy profit from the economic crash following the zombie apocalypse.
>> ARTICLE
Aioi Yukko....and the rest of the Nichijou gang... I'm so F'ed, but it should be entertaining at least ^.^
>> ARTICLE
I'm in the same boat, but assiming the zombie apocalypse takes place in the universe of the characters, I think we're ok.  Actually, we're in for a *lot* of fun.
>> ARTICLE
Hakase would surely find a cure but might need some shark chocolate for motivation.
>> ARTICLE
Just get the zombies between Mio and her art binder. She'll dragonspiral the world to get to it before anyone else.
>> ARTICLE
So I guess i'll be okay'ish'. I have the Black Lagoon company on my side! Or if you wanna get specific, Revy hopefully... Rock would just get me killed.

Rock would rock shit. He knows how to deal under pressure would be able to make a sweet ass plan.

Psycho Pass... Akane or Shinya...?
>> ARTICLE
Akane. 

Do dominators work on zombies?

>> ARTICLE
The Sybil System would probably judge zombies to be a threat of the highest order, [since](/s "it is a gigantic collection of disembodied brains, the zombie's preferred food source") and authorize full on deconstructor mode. On the other hand, zombies have no ill-will inherent in their actions and would likely remain undetected by the psycho-pass scanners until the outbreak was too large to successfully contain, dominators or not.
>> ARTICLE
Shit I would be stuck with Takeshi from Mahou Sensou. All I can say is, we won't know what happened or why it happened and we'll probably never know either, but I'll probably be dead in the end.
>> ARTICLE
Kemonozume, eh? I've got my choice of hot chick that turns into a razor-clawed beast, or dude who has trained his whole life to kill them. Welp, I think I'm safe. I'll see you poor sobs at the mall.

Yokoi Rumi... this is gonna be the *shortest* and most **ADORABLE** apocalypse ever.

Konata Izumi from LuckyStar, maybe her knowledge of video games/manga may aid in my survival and she's pretty athletic when she wants to be.

Great, Watase Aoba. If he comes with the Valiancer, I'll survive. If there's a zombie that looks vaguely like Hina, I'm fucked.

Geez a bit earlier and I'd have Nice from Hamatora but now I'm stuck with Kanda Sorata from Sakurasou.

Well could've been worse I guess.

Joseph Joestar. I think I've won this round.

...Trapped in a city with several large, unclimbable walls. Outside the walls, giant pretty-much-zombies waiting to eat you. Very dense living conditions and a limited food supply with little arable land inside. 

But I'm sure you'll do great!

GJ-bu was my last watched, so I think I'd be pretty safe having Kirara around, maybe.

Don't forget Ore man.

I have Aladdin, Alibaba or Morgiana from Magi so I think I'm pretty fortunate.

[Mononoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2246/Mononoke) as long as we can determine their Form, Truth and Regret we should be alright.

Raku Ichijou, so I guess we'll be fine considering his entire Yakuza family will back him up.

I'm going by the last 3 shows I finished.

Berserk: I'll probably be fine.  
Kill la Kill: I'll definitely be fine.  
Sakura Trick: I'm fucked.
>> ARTICLE
Correction. With Berserk you are absolutely golden. Won't get much conversation, but you will never have to worry about zombies.

Just so long as it's just zombies. If demons start getting involved you're fucked.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm good. Matoi to the rescue!
>> ARTICLE
Claus Valca from Last Exile. If it comes with a vanship, flying away from the zombie apocalypse will be easy. If it comes with the Silvana, we could carve out a safe zone quite easily. 
>> ARTICLE
Yadomi Jinta from Anohana. Maybe the both of us can survive this apocalypse with some feels
>> ARTICLE
The last anime I watched was Tonari no Seki-kun so I don't think my survival prospects are to high, I mean Seki-kun probably wouldn't pay any attention to the zombies and be playing around insted.
>> ARTICLE
Just watched Rebellion so Homura I guess? I'm pretty ok with this.

The last show I watched was Zeta Gundam, therefore Char Aznable. This seems almost unfair, his plot armour is impregnable.  

It seems I'm set for an intense apocalypse either way.
>> ARTICLE
Alibaba,morgiana and alladin. Seems like I would survive it :D
>> ARTICLE
Nono from Diebuster?
I think I'll be fine.
>> ARTICLE
Joseph Joestar. Fuck YES.
>> ARTICLE
ryuko. So I'm in good hands.

But if this was included manga... Well I just read Sankarea so this would be interesting since Chihiro would be in paradise and Rea... well she would be part of the problem.
>> ARTICLE
Tonari no seki-kun

atleast i will be able to play some games before the zombies fuckin' eat me alive ( ._.)
>> ARTICLE
So I am stuck with Hikigaya Hachiman.  This apocalypse would at least be entertaining, albeit very short. 
>> ARTICLE
well, im with Hana Kana, so i think the zombies might be star struck for a while so ill have a few seconds to escape...
>> ARTICLE
Why would you even think of escaping and leaving KanaHana behind?? The morally correct choice in that situation would obviously be to sacrifice yourself for her.
>> ARTICLE
Monkey D Luffy. Emperor's Will to knock out all zombies in the vicinity. Then I take a knife or rock and decapitate every zombie I see that hasn't already been decapitated. Food will be a bitch though, but with Luffy's rubber body a zombie can never kill him by biting.

Rumi Yokoi.

Yeah, I'm screwed.

[Peace Maker Kurogane](http://myanimelist.net/anime/161/Peace_Maker_Kurogane)  

Which means that Tetsunosuke Ichimaru is my ally... I think that while not being the worst option (That'd 100% be either Shinji [Evangelion] or Yuki [Mirai Niki]) I probably still won't survive.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Mirai Nikki, I am not sure who I want less, Yuno or Yukki. Can I be Yuno's center of attention?
>> ARTICLE
Yuuko Aioi....shit.
>> ARTICLE
Well, if I lived in Space Dandy world...

I guess I would die, but then be back alive by next week.

...best of both worlds?

Space Dandy, so probably best possible scenario, since I can then cash out on life insurance, then go racing in a week or so.

>> ARTICLE
Berserk

As long as none of the other stuff from that fucked up world transfers over, I am ridiculously lucky.  The only issue might be if Guts tries to take them all on at once.  I imagine there'd be far more than a few hundred.

Ginko... well i'm not sure how useful he is when it comes to zombie apocalypses, but he could probably mess with some mushi in some way to hopefully fuck the zombies over
>> ARTICLE
Makunouchi Ippo

Dempsey Roll is damn good against zombies
>> ARTICLE
Depends on what you mean by last watched.

If it's the last series I completed, it was **Kill La Kill**, in which case I think I'm pretty damn set for life.

If it's the last episode of anime I watched, it was an episode of **Love Lab**, in which case I can just pretend to be a life-like body pillow or something and I will be protected and loved with fury.

Well i think i got it going for me with Simon from Gurren Langann if im able to ride the lower half
>> ARTICLE
Akari from Aria. So Fucked. 
>> ARTICLE
Nichibros... WELP atleast I will have some fun :D
>> ARTICLE
The last anime episode I finished this evening was from Pupa. Depending on how the MC is defined for the show, I get either a handy battle-brother, or a volatile team member who would be no better than the horde of the unliving.
>> ARTICLE
Ginko from Mushishi, he'd probably chalk it up to Mushi infecting bodies and save the world.
>> ARTICLE
I've been rewatching Jojo Part 1 and 2, so lucky for me the main characters are actually specialized in zombie slaying.
>> ARTICLE
Aladdin from Magi.

>> ARTICLE
I've got Ginko from Mushishi, I'm pretty much fine.
>> ARTICLE
Full metal alchemist, so I should be fine. Alchemy does seem useful in a zombie apocalypse.

I got "Master-Strategist" Shiroe from Log Horizon...so I'm good.

**Shiroe** from Log Horizon. Strategically surviving the zombie apocalypse? Magic for back up? I think I'm set.

Shiroe from Log Horizon. Could be a good thing, but everything he does is in the game. Therefore, all we have is good plan making if it's not in Elder Tales.

I watched Watamote earlier today... I honestly don't know what Tomoko would do in a zombie apocalypse. Either she'd be completely unable to speak to this random American kid she's stuck with, or her rage against society would finally be released and she'd kill everything. Maybe a little of both.

Waiting for this to go to /r/all and the shitstorm that follows
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I came here from /r/all and I have a question for the people here. Don't you find it kind of creepy that most of your animes **hypersexualize underage girls**? Doesn't the fact that underage girls are considered fanservice indicate that perhaps most of the anime you guys watch are for **teenage boys**? I mean that's why it's called a **Shonen** right? So I guess my question is, assuming most of you are over 18 and I don't mean any offense: **aren't most of you too old for the animes you guys are watching?** 

Edit: Also, I'm not generalizing all anime or looking down on anime at all. I used to watch alot of anime in the past as well. Outlaw star and Honey and Clover series were my favorites. But I only ask this because when I look at the anime today, they seem alot more pornographic than I remember.

Edit2: to clarify, I don't think anime is weird. I just think that the people in their 20's and 30s watching shonen, anime targeted towards teenage boys, are weird. 
>> ARTICLE
I, myself am 20 years old. I just started watching anime last year, actually. Watch something like Corpse Party and tell me it's for kids.
>> ARTICLE
Well that depends, is Corpse Party a Shonen?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, didn't see the Shounen statement. Watch Hunter x Hunter. Since you probably don't care too much about watching the show start at the yorknew arc. I think it starts around episode 50.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're overestimating the average age of people in this sub.
>> ARTICLE
Well, you are asking an honest question, so I will give you an honest answer. Do keep in mind that I am answering solely for myself and do not claim this to be the answer for all of /r/anime/.

Yes, most anime are aimed at teenaged boys, and those are called shonenen, they compose a large amount of anime released now a days.

Second of all, although most fanservice in anime is underage, it is highschool. Those girls are all fully mature and developed, and other than names, they do not display any of the characteristics of teenage girls (typically speaking of course, there are exceptions), because, and you might have guessed it, they are't real boys and girls.

Now, allow me to point out that although some anime have never ending fanservice (highschool of the dead comes to mind), in most of them it is moderated and used for humorous effects. Although this may ruin the moment if thrown in at the wrong time, from time to time it is fun. Not gonna complain for the occasional fanservice.

As for too old for anime. Aren't most people on /r/gaming/ or any similar subreddits too old to play video games? Yet they still do (and me!). Why? Because they enjoy it. Because it is fun. Because it takes my mind off the long day of work I have. I enjoy doing it.

Lastly I will bring up the point that shounen, action, and fanservice are not in my favorite anime. Unlike what most non-anime viewers I have met think **Anime is not just mindless action and loli fanservice**. There is so much more to it. Believe it or not, you can do much more with animation they you can do with live actors. It is great seeing all the forms of art. I view anime kind of like I view books, as a way to see what I will never happen in real life. Weather it be magic, dragons, super-powers, or the occasional fan service.

My favorite anime of all time doesn't even include any action scenes, fanservice, or aimed at teenaged boys. That anime is called [Charcoal Feather Federation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei), and it is beautiful, philosophical, and just overall amazing. It is also a great entrance anime for people who aren't into the action fanserviece kind of stuff. (not that I'm advertising it or anything *cough cough*)

One last note is that when people here discuss fanserviece, incest, lolis, or the recent bath thread that got into /r/all/, they typically aren't taking it seriously and more doing it as a joke on everyone, including yourself and me.

Hope that clears up all your qualms, if you have any more questions or arguments feel free to respond to me.

Some of the people here might be a little bit offensive, but that's because nobody likes it when other people insult their favorite activity, so please don't feel insulted by it :)
>> ARTICLE
Well I never said all anime were for teenage boys, I enjoyed Honey and Cover when I was 18 and loved it. I can definitely appreciate it as an art form and I think that it can be for all ages just like videogames. But I think it's kind of creepy when people in their 20s or even 30s are watching **shonen's**, which is targeted towards teenage boys with their endless amount of fanservice of teenage girls. 
>> ARTICLE
First: not all of the anime featured in the OP are shonen. Many are notable seinen and ecchi titles with clear R+ ratings. Also, not all shonen has "endless amount of fanservice of teenage girls" and just because a show has a *target* demographic doesn't mean people outside that demographic are forbidden from enjoying it.  This behavior isn't even exclusive to anime; American cartoons like Adventure Time, Sponge Bob, and Steven Universe have a ton of adult fans.

Second: just as with books and movies, anime is a medium with many different genres.  Yes, shonen is one such genre, based on an age demographic.  You, apparently, prefer josei titles like Honey and Clover.  There's nothing wrong with either preference.  

To be honest, I'm not into fan service, but you won't see me giving people shit about enjoying all their love for ecchi and harem anime.  *It doesn't hurt me for them to like it, and it doesn't hurt you either*.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually with you on that. The amount of never-ending fanservice in anime is really annoying, especially when it spills over to shows I actually like.

However after a long hard day of work, I can sometimes appreciate some mindless action and teenage girls. That is all I have in defense of fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
K.

I like that, totally an /r/all reader with little ties to anime who knows what shonen means to bring it up on their own out of no where.

Wild Card test

This is specifically for the people that didn't see the nomination thread. Basically, I'll be doing this for the rest of my threads. Each thread, I will have a maximum number of wild cards (for this one, it's 5). The top 5 (or other amount for another thread) will get a second chance and be in the final vote which will be held sometime after the end of the other polls, which is Wednesday, February 4. I'll probably end up posting it the 7th or the 8th. 

TL;DR, if you want characters added, comment them here.

Edit: forgot to add, I will include up to 5 for *each category*. So 5 girls and 5 guys.

Edit 2: someone just posted a girl for abs, so 5 girls (man boobs will not be counted, sorry :p) and 5 uh... sets of abs?

Edit 3: Forgot to put 2014 anywhere in this thread, only characters from 2014 are valid.

Exciting and creative asspulls do not a good show make.  "Oh no, I'm losing this chess match.  Better seduce the opposing player's queen.  Because that's a thing I can do, apparently."

>> ARTICLE
They have no depth to them.  They're paper thin.  I don't see how it isn't obvious how poorly written they are.  They are literally *just* tropes given shape.
>> ARTICLE
A show being good is completely subjective. You may consider it bad writing and as such think its bad, but thats only because you are comparing it to other things you've experienced. Therefore it is only an opinion. You can only attempt critical evaluation and objectivity, but its completely impossible to actually achieve it. That is because whilst you may have some logical criteria that you use to rate a score, how highly you weight each criteria and score each component is 100% subjective. For example you might consider OP characters like Sora, Lelouch and Light as bad characters because they are tropes to you and it creates no intensity or tension in the plot. However some might consider it good writing because to come up with logical asspulls requires linear like thinking that has to make coherent sense throughout the show. For example Sora against Jibril, took an entire episode for his asspull to play out. Also some people might see depth in the tropes. I know I found depth in the trope characters of Date A Live as it made me think it was a satire, where some others disagree. Read an essay called ["The Author Is Dead"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkQsRVrWM6c) or just watch the youtube link. Its essentially stating that everything you come up with is an opinion based on your own experiences, the original authors intent is pointless and that there is no objectivity in your review of anything. Just because you think its bad, doesn't mean its bad to people like me and /u/Pozsich, and honestly if you think you can be objective when discussing things like this. You're more mentally challenged than myself.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the old "all opinions are equal so let people think what they want" argument.  There's no point in moving forward with that particular discussion if that's how your going to act.

Just got to point out though:

>I know I found depth in the trope characters of Date A Live as it made me think it was a satire, where some others disagree.

Projecting your own misunderstandings onto a show doesn't make that the author's intent for the show.  That's like saying "I considered Frankenstein a comedy" and telling everyone the author's intent for the book was comedy.  It's clearly not.  Speaking of which.

>Its essentially stating that everything you come up with is an opinion based on your own experiences, the **original authors intent is pointless** and that there is no objectivity in your review of anything.

That is straight up bullshit.  The authors intent is *everything* when it comes to a story.  One clear and *huge* hole in that theory is fucking Shakespeare.  What was his intent when he used the words he *created?*  Is it up to us to *interpret* these wholly original combinations and words?  No.  It's the author's duty to tell us his intent.  Saying that an author's work is borrowed from his experiences is only half the truth.  It's up to the author to organize those experiences into something *injected* with his intent.  To guide his reader/viewer along a preordained path *he* set up.  Different interpretations come from readers/viewers straying from that path and finding themselves at the end.  Sure, they made it to the end, but not the way the author intended them to.  If people had no intent towards their creations, we wouldn't create them.  The author's whole purpose when writing a story, or taking a picture, or painting a landscape, is to deliver a message.

In short, don't use a theory as some absolute truth when discussing subjectivity, objectivity, and opinions.  It looks incredibly silly of you.
>> ARTICLE
AH, the old "you are so incredibly misinformed that I pity you" argument. There's no point in moving forward with that particular discussion if that's how you're going to act.

>Projecting your own misunderstandings onto a show doesn't make that the author's intent for the show.

Authors never explicitly state the purpose of a show. With Date A Live it is under the impression of Poe's Law which states that unless the author purposely states that it is satire, it is both satire and not satire. It is up for the individual to decide. 

>One clear and huge hole in that theory is fucking Shakespeare. What was his intent when he used the words he created? Is it up to us to interpret these wholly original combinations and words? No. It's the author's duty to tell us his intent. 

Did you even study English, holy fuck man. Do you even understand why Hamlet is so famous? Its famous because there are so many different interpretations of what his words mean because it resonates a different aspect for different viewers. William Hazlett stated "it is we who are Hamlet", meaning that how we perceive Hamlet and his intentions is correct, because we see ourselves in his character. Source (http://shakespearean.org.uk/ham1-haz.htm):

>Hamlet is a name; his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of the poet's brain. What then, are they not real? They are as real as our own thoughts. Their reality is in the reader's mind. It is we who are Hamlet. This play has a prophetic truth, which is above that of history. Whoever has become thoughtful and melancholy through his own mishaps or those of others; whoever has borne about with him the clouded brow of reflection, and thought himself "too much i' th' sun;" whoever has seen the golden lamp of day dimmed by envious mists rising in his own breast, and could find in the world before him only a dull blank with nothing left remarkable in it; whoever has known "the pangs of despised love, the insolence of office, or the spurns which patient merit of the unworthy takes;" he who has felt his mind sink within him, and sadness cling to his heart like a malady, who has had his hopes blighted and his youth staggered by the apparitions of strange things; who cannot well be at ease, while he sees evil hovering near him like a spectre; whose powers of action have been eaten up by thought, he to whom the universe seems infinite, and himself nothing; whose bitterness [75] of soul makes him careless of consequences, and who goes to a play as his best resource is to shove off, to a second remove, the evils of life by a mock representation of them - this is the true Hamlet.

Your entire point there is complete and utter bullshit. Texts are famous for having so many different interpretations, none of them are correct and none of them are wrong and none of them are correct. As long as it is correct to the individual that is all that matters. Different viewpoints from different things it what makes a text controversial and famous, however none of these viewpoints are correct. If people could reach an objective truth, then there would be no disagreement on anything. This discussion forum wouldn't even exist as there would be no discussion, just people agreeing with each other.

>In short, don't use a theory as some absolute truth when discussing subjectivity, objectivity, and opinions. It looks incredibly silly of you.

You realize you're doing the exact same thing right? Whilst there is no official name for what you are doing, its the exact same as mine but with the opposite meaning. You have come up with a theory and belief that the authors intent is law, and have argued as such. I have come up with the theory of "The Author Is Dead" and argued that point.

Don't be condescendingly retarded, it looks incredibly silly of you.
>> ARTICLE
> Did you even study English, holy fuck man.

Heh, it's been about 4 or more years since I studied English.  We didn't cover Hamlet for very long either.  In fact, I believe we only watched the Mel Gibson movie.  We did read Julius Caesar, Romeo and Juliet, and Taming of the Shrew.

I actually just found you and Pazzu's discussion a couple days ago about *the exact same damn thing* as we're doing now.

After reading through that and giving your position some more thought, I can see it's merits.  I will say that, when given, an author's intent trumps personal revelation every time.  Take Bradbury for instance.  His intent in writing Fahrenheit 451 was to illustrate mass media's (specifically television's) affect on people and how it makes them less able to digest complex forms of media, like books.  You probably know the story of the college lecture.  One interesting thing is that this certain debacle was possible thanks to personal interpretations.

I *would* like to probe your mind some more on this theory and hear some more of it's counter arguments on some ideas I've come up with in regard to measuring objectivity.  For instance, you mention this:

>thats only because you are comparing it to other things you've experienced.

When comparing opinions does one defer to the other when they have more experience?  That would seem logical, as with any field, you defer to those who have more experience (as I'm doing right now).  And how does this work with art?  Some artists are considered better than others, but if left up to the opinions of the masses, wouldn't it not matter?  I might have more to think on this, but I'll wait for your response.

Now this is in regards character writing specifically.  Say you and I have different opinions on Sora as a character.  I say he's well written, and you say he's poorly written (I think we likely have the opposite of these opinions).  What would happen if we took a character we *both* agreed was well written, and compared him to Sora?  Wouldn't we be able to quantify the characteristics that are well and poorly written between the two?  For instance, backstory, motivations, etc.

Two last things.

>I have come up with the theory of "The Author Is Dead"

[](/pointandlaugh)

Come now, we both know your name isn't Roland Barthes.

>Don't be condescendingly retarded, it looks incredibly silly of you.

Shit, that *was* condescending of me.  Sorry.  That happens when I get into heated discussions. :(
>> ARTICLE
Besides that all this is true, he's not even trying to be unbiased anyways. He says the characters are written poorly because they're thin tropes, but what's the line? Most anime characters are tropes or slight variations on tropes, few have the time to go deeper into the characterization than what is necessary for story progression. I don't see how holding a flaw that is extremely prevalent in anime versus a single one makes it outstandingly bad. Is it a good trait? No, I would agree not. Is it a bad one? No, it's a normal one.                         
Also to your points; we can approach being objective. Some people can come quite close to it. However, you are correct in that it is ultimately impossible to be unbiased in opinions of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Well like the video said every character is based on the authors own experiences and other mediums hes seen. Everything that is ever written is borrowing different components of different shows because nothing is a completely original idea, and has been taken from elsewhere. I agree with you here.

>we can approach being objective. Some people can come quite close to it. However, you are correct in that it is ultimately impossible to be unbiased in opinions of shows.

That is where I disagree with you. Its not that you can approach it, but you can attempt it. You will never get near a point of being objective, but you can attempt some form of a logical criteria. However what you use to deduce that a show is "good" is different from another person. I could say the only shows that are good are the ones that are entertaining. Others could say what makes a show "good" is it has to be pretty. Someone else could say it has to combine those two elements. There is no set standard for "good", its completely subjective. You can only sort out your own subjectiveness and explain your personal criteria for it, but it doesn't mean its any more objective. It is still utterly 100% subjective.

I don't think so. I would hope not. Because even if I'm not attracted to large breasted women, and don't want to be large breasted. It would just be another kind of body shaming and body policing. 

Women can be large chested and still have wonderful, attractive, wonderful personalities. And being attractive isn't everything.

But I'm not attracted to breasts. And I'm tired of being expected to. 

I'm also tired of people treating large breasts like they're better.

As for people treating them like they're better - that's just their preference? Like subjectively they are *better* to certain people.

>> ARTICLE
Sorry if I was taking people too seriously.

And sadly, there are people who seem to act like larger breasts are *objectively* better. And try to make arguments from nature as to why. 

The whole flat chest thing is a bit like the fat acceptance movement. There's a pressure for women to be skinny, yet curvy. Not so much flat chested, or plus sized. So maybe some of us, including me, get a bit overzealous about that. Sorry.

A lot of us get loud and proud, because we don't want everyone thinking that "bigger is better". Maybe a bit too loud and proud.
>> ARTICLE
S'okay~

Lol, well, I wouldn't do that, it's silly. Nothing is objectively better, appearance wise anyway. 

I kinda get what you mean... um, I think? If you're skinny but flat chested people tell you to be curvier, and if you're fat but apple-shaped or whatever (aka not curvy), people tell you to be curvier, too. So really only hourglass shapes are being accepted on either end of the spectrum of weight.

I really think an opportunity was missed for Rin Matsuoka in the ab/muscle category.   I just think it's funny that this show is a show about *swimming* and the sample pictures are of his child self, his face, from the chest up, or his fully clothed body... I'm actually amazed there were so many pictures of him fully clothed out there.

Edit:

Here's some representative pictures so you can witness the [muscles](http://31.media.tumblr.com/2fc969c907aabb5464b847b1e78ee424/tumblr_n7yt66FUXu1r1wpwoo1_500.jpg) [in](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2013/219/4/c/gou_and_rin_matsuoka_by_somthinandnothin-d6h4kgt.png) [all](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/54/27/d8/5427d837c3e24ebcdfa9e13c58a7843a.jpg) [their](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/miz4tune/11648188/4978/4978_900.jpg) [glory](http://www.tapeciarnia.pl/tapety/normalne/224291_free_rin_matsuoka.jpg) [at many](http://www.crymore.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NSOnii-Free-03-1280x720-x264-AAC7A0D1A79.mkv_snapshot_23.03_2013.07.20_18.15.33-640x360.jpg) [angles](http://static.tumblr.com/16037981702b94dc4d54ab241f026446/z5alk1f/Cy1mqaytm/tumblr_static_rin.jpg).

There are various shows that do get the nipples drawn, but those are only on certain stations in Japan. Most of these shows are aired on television and I would assume most stations prefer not having nipples? I don't know.

Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online/stats
>> ARTICLE
I've been so blind! I wish that was on the page by default.
>> ARTICLE
And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.

Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.

That's what I was looking for

KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.

I think you'll find that's open to interpretation

In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.

5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.

> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.

If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well.

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order.

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol
>> ARTICLE
It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.

Lol, u prob wanted to stay off of /r/anime during the entire fall season then.

the guy probably wanted you to get the same enjoyment he experienced, I dont think he meant any harm. 

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.
>> ARTICLE
I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.
>> ARTICLE
recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.

Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.

True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.

> The face we make when we see it wins the **Best Comedy Scene of 2014**.

>> ARTICLE
I'm confused as to how Rin won best female character over Chiyo, but then lost best female main character to Chiyo. They're both main characters. Obviously I'd have liked Rin to win both because she's my one true love, but I'd also prefer Chiyo win both to what we got. This isn't really a complaint with the structure of the poll or the votes really... but it is odd, which you said to mention.
>> ARTICLE
They posted like 20 threads. People probably paid attention less in one of those threads.
>> ARTICLE
It depends on perspective, atleast for me.. example: I like Rin more as a character, she's more interesting and has a deeper story to her.

But being a main character has different criterias and I find Sakura to fill the main character role a lot better than Rin does.

That's my two cents on the matter atleast.
>> ARTICLE
I like One Week Friends as much as the next guy, but how did it end up over Ping Pong or NGNL (I didn't even like this, but I figured it was a shoe in)?

Edit:
>Best Scifi: Mahouka

Haha, god damn it
>> ARTICLE
Just a smaller sample in votes, NGNL won anime of the year in the bigger poll, so I don't think it would lose in its own season.
>> ARTICLE
> Haha, god damn it

I mean when you have Parasyte(not even sci-fi in my book but whatever) and SAO competing for sci-fi Mahouka(a great sci-fi LN series with good worldbuilding in my book) is amazing by comparison.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte is a much better show than Mahouka, and it is science fiction. That's enough reason for it to win right there. And like many said, Space Dandy as well. 

I'm surprised Kill la Kill didn't take the top spot in anything, and I don't even think silver spoon s2 was a nominee! A shame, as they are both in my top 5. 
>> ARTICLE
>Parasyte is sci-fi

It's more paranormal than sci-fi. There is no real "science" involved in the story so I don't think it really counts for sci-fi. I personally enjoyed Mahouka more than Parasyte(seeing how the former wore out its welcome around the half-way point) but that's just my own view on both shows.

>I'm surprised Kill la Kill didn't take the top spot in anything

I didn't expect it to take anything besides best girl/boobs. The animation is lacking in comparison to KyoAni and Ufotable and the story is overshadowed by much better shows this year. The comedy wasn't even that good compared to other shows like Barakamon and Gekkan Shojo. At least in my eyes.
>> ARTICLE
You think science fiction genre need involve some scientific content? Wonder what kind of science is involved in "drowned world" by J.G.Ballard or Delaney's "Dhalgren".... You don't get to define genres as you see fit, by ignoring works that already influenced and shaped its history.

It is utterly implausible with the contortions the parasyte body can pull, without even acknowledging this needing any explanation, but still it chooses to frame its story in rather tropish SF way of an alien invasion by superiorly capable biological organisms (even the manner of doing so is rather reminiscent of old SF classics like Heinlein's "puppet masters" - with slug-like creatures, arriving in flying saucers, attaching themselves to peoples backs, taking control of their victims nervous systems, and manipulating those people as puppets.  -  or ofc of "Body Snatchers"), as opposed to phantasmal incursion, demonic possession or any other explicit invocation of the unnatural.
>> ARTICLE
I bet next things we should add to the sci-fi genre are ghost, the ring, vampire, zombie and other unreal shit.


Because "You think science fiction genre need involve some scientific content?"
>> ARTICLE
You are utterly ridiculous if you believe sf can only mean hard sf or be anything at all and nothing in particular, despite the glaringly obvious fact that it has continued to be a well defined genre filled with as you put it "unreal shit" for as long as it has existed at all. Consider say Bradbury's works like the martian chronicles, pretty much any part of new wave of science fiction you care to name etc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, do tell me your criteria to qualify a work as "sci-fi".

And don't tell me that "those are fucking magic and shit. Only things that are recently brought up can be considered Sci-fi. Those shits have existed a long time already. Magic and science are not mixed well because Index said so."
>> ARTICLE
my criteria? why would I bother making up my criteria -- winners of Hugo and/or Nebula awards are "my" criteria. literature courses on science fiction are "my" criteria. For I've pretty much only named commonly accepted staples and staple writers of the genre. Like any genre its defined by institutions, reference body of literature, conventions, publishers, editors, magazines etc. 

Point is parasyte is simply far too derivative of certain acknowledged classics not to be in the same genre as them.

I can't even parse your second paragraph. 
>> ARTICLE
So, you just superficially compare them and say "yep, sci-fi"?

If you take away "alien invasion" setting? will it still be sci-fi?
Because this looks more like "Ushio and Tora" than a sci-fi work.
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte being the better show is merely your opinion and other people might think otherwise (but yeah I agree that parasyte anime is better than the Mahouka anime). 

In terms of science fiction genre though Mahouka has a far greater detail, world building and interesting stuff than Parasyte. Parasyte just has Parasytes whilst Mahouka has technomagic, super advanced weapons, a 'society of the future' etc... the poll was best science fiction anime so I consider the win legit.
>> ARTICLE
Well it was also competing against Space Dandy and Knights of Sidonia.
>> ARTICLE
Granted KoS was a pretty good sci-fi show as well(I don't know why people count Space Dandy as sci-fi, I count it more as comedy, but what have you) but loses to Mahouka greatly in terms of detail, worldbuilding, and characters.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest I doubt the voting leaned towards Mahouka because of anything you just said, I'd bet more on the fact that its very popular, and gets a huge boost from the /r/OneTrueTatsuya crowd, but I dropped it very quickly so I won't press it.
>> ARTICLE
True, the popularity of it had a big deal to due with, and only a small minority liked the worldbuilding, but I think one of the main attractions of it *was* the world(and by extension the magic system and the OPness of Tats)
>> ARTICLE
> I don't know why people count Space Dandy as sci-fi, I count it more as comedy, but what have you

It certainly is more of a comedy, but there are definitely sci-fi elements in it. Also shows can be more than one genre.
>> ARTICLE
I think the implication was that it's "main" genre was sci-fi, just like how SAO's "main" genre is sci-fi when its a more adventure-style story.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh SAO's main genre isn't sci-fi but more like action, adventure, harem and romance

I wouldn't it say its harem/romance(although it *is* a major element of it) but more so adventure and action.

As much as I liked Isshuukan Friends, I voted for Ping Pong in the best Spring Anime category...it being the only anime I've ever rated 10/10 while it was airing. 

Mahouka won best Sci-Fi? I guess the only real competition out of the final 5 was Parasyte, although I personally liked Sidonia better it didn't make the cut...I suppose the SciFi aspects of it were good enough. This, however:

>Best Male Character of 2014
>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 252 votes!

Someone please help me understand this. I don't get it at all. And with nearly 1/3 of the vote, no less.

Kind of surprised to see Zankyou no Terror win best Original Anime after it bombed (get it? bombed? hahahaha I'm so funny) in the last few episodes. Surprised it won thriller too, expected the Madoka movie to fare slightly better (not win, of course, but top 3). AND it won summer too, over Barakamon and Nozaki-kun? ...I may have underestimated how much /r/anime liked ZnT...oh well. 

Overall, was nice. And dont worry /u/UgotMAL, I am *perfectly fine* voting Ping Pong the best of 2014 three times. Even though its (probably) not going to win.
>> ARTICLE
/r/OneTrueTatsuya thats why
>> ARTICLE
There must have been a mistake... surely that was the vote for worst character?
>> ARTICLE
All this time I thought /r/OneTrueTatsuya was satire. I mean, I'm pretty sure it was originally. But to think that you... *people*... genuinely like Tatsuya just fills me with rage. People give Kirito shit all the time on this subreddit, but Tatsuya is way worse and yet he wins the best fucking male character of 2014? Are you fucking kidding me /r/anime? You people disgust me. 
>> ARTICLE
You should know that most of the anime audiences nowadays are very young. So it's hard for them to appreciate any "artistic" anime they watched or will see in the future.

It's just how the industry works. Almost everything now aims at young age and show like Ping Pong is hard to find a place among the kids.

You are being dwonvoted but i have to agree.

The Stu was just too strong with this one, /r/anime couldn't fight it.

Tatsuya is not worse than Kirito. He's a different MC. Kind of an anti-hero but not really. He doesn't fight for 'justice,' he doesn't do the right thing all the time. People think he's OP as fuck(which is true), but he trained to get that way. Plus he's not all bitchy/emotional.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, honestly, in any other anime I wouldn't necessarily dislike Tatsuya that much. What made me dislike him so much in Mahouka, and ended up making me drop the show despite really liking the action scenes, is the fact that half the goddamn show is just people fucking worshiping Tatsuya. And other various ridiculous shit, like Tatsuya telling the paramedics how to do their goddamn jobs. He's a shitty chuunibyou-pandering character who's only supposed flaws aren't even actually flaws.

u know, with his powers he could know immediately what damage did someone take for faster treatment, but probably u didnt know this since u dropped the series

I don't think Ping Pong deserves even a top three finish in Spring AotS but hey.. that's me.
>> ARTICLE
wow   i couldn't be less salty, pretty much everything i voted for came first or in the top 3, it feels strange being happy with a contest here
>> ARTICLE
I suppose the difference between best ed song and best ed is the first being only music and the other being animation included?

I still don't get how Zankyou no Terror won that one. Yes, it fit well in the soundtrack. But a lot of other stuff in the list was better animation wise and/or music wise. It's probably  something about most people having watched the show and only voting on it because they remember the great soundtrack and immediately think the ED should win because of that as well... 

Whatever, as long as I can think well enough for myself humanity can survive..

glad that esdeath won 'best boobs'

Is it just me or does this make no sense haha I don't mean this in a salty way just that one anime beats another in one catagory only to have it switched around in another similar one

One Week Friends beat out Knights of Sidonia and Ping Pong for best of Spring. Just wow. And Mahouka winning best science fiction over Sidonia? Both One Week Friends and Mahouka are the epitome of mediocrity. That they won anything is laughable. 


>> ARTICLE
I don't get it either.  I am not a fan of Sidonia, but Mahouka definately was mediocre.  Every other episode it seemed was bad.  And the main character was such a gary sue, it was terrible.  
>> ARTICLE
Personally I find Mahouka to be mediocre, but out of what we had to pick from I believe it pulled of the Sci-Fi aspects the best out of the crop, that being the reason I voted for it.
>> ARTICLE
Mahouka did a pretty good job with the sci-fi. I've heard that it's a lot more obvious in the LN's, but it seemed pretty clear to me during my watch that the anime had an actual world built around it with hints of explanations ('magic' as a form of energy, wave patterns, sequences and the use of technology, etc.), but I watch for that stuff much more closely than most on here, so you probably just missed it.

It's not just more obvious, there's entire pages dedicated to worldbuilding in the Mahouka LN.

Maybe in the original F/SN or F/0, but the new UBW anime, is very Rincentric, and she has been the best character in that show.

**Best anime of Winter 2014**

>Nagi no Asukara - 76 votes!

>Kill la Kill - 71 votes!

>Log Horizon - 64 votes!

I can live with this... not bad at all in fact.

**Best anime of Spring 2014**

>Isshuukan Friends. (One Week Friends) - 72 votes!

>No Game No Life - 70 votes!

>Ping Pong the Animation - 64 votes!

WOAH! That was unexpected, still I'd rather this than have Ping Pong win.

**Best anime of Summer 2014**

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 72 votes!

>Barakamon - 53 votes!

>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun - 51 votes!

Kind of expected considering most people who voted for the well written laid-back series Nozaki-kun and Barakamon split their votes between the two, Zankyou no Terror was still a worthy winner IMO though.

**Best anime of Fall 2014**

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) - 128 votes!

>Shirobako - 66 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 52 votes!

A near perfect result, I'm surprised that Shirobako made it that high though but glad it did.

**Best animation of 2014**

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 320 votes!

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 62 votes!

>ME!ME!ME! - 57 votes!

That overwhelming victory.. still my runner-up finished second so cheers for that.

**Best OP of 2014**

>Unravel (Tokyo Ghoul) - 117 votes!

>Hikaru Nara / If You Will Shine (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Osu / Your lie in April OP 1) - 79 votes!

>Trigger (Zankyou no Terror / Terror in Resonance) - 66 votes!

I find This Game to be the best OP when you include animation but if you wouldn't include it even though that is further down my favourites would be #1 #2 and #4 so I suppose /r/anime doesn't have quite that poor music taste after all.

**Best ED of 2014**

>Dareka Umiwo (Zankyou no Terror / Terror in Resonance) - 103 votes!

>aLIEz (Aldnoah.Zero) - 84 votes!

>Shirushi (Sword Art Online ED 3) - 63 votes!

Mind if I retract my last statement?

**Best Comedy of 2014**

>Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) - 148 votes!

>Barakamon - 109 votes!

>No Game No Life - 64 votes!

Well voted, the two most deserving got spot 1 and 2.

**Best Slice-of-Life of 2014**

>Barakamon - 140 votes!
 
>Isshuukan Friends. (One Week Friends) - 99 votes!

>Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken (I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying) - 84 votes!

So far all my picks has placed first for these... let's just hope they remain in the top 3.

**Best Harem of 2014**

>Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace) - 130 votes!

>Nisekoi - 111 votes!

>Monogatari Series - Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari - 90 votes!

Hooh? Inou-Battle was that popular huh? well Nisekoi still made 2nd.

**Best Thriller of 2014**

>Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - 152 votes!

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) - 131 votes!

>Psycho-Pass 2 - 76 votes!

While I do believe that Kiseijuu is the best of the animes we got to pick from Zankyou no Terror definitely pulled of the Thriller aspect the best and hence is the worthy winner here.

**Best Romance of 2014**

>Nagi no Asukara - 125 votes!

>Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) - 87 votes!

>Golden Time - 83 votes!

Clearly not enough people appreciate the purity of Golden Time and it's amazingness, you should be ashamed! well I suppose it's understandable since Nagi no Asukara is quite the anime as well. I do believe it's a stretch calling Your Lie in April a good romance anime thus far however, it's good drama but the romance in the series is very undeveloped thus far... has potential though.

**Best Sports of 2014**

>Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season (Kuroko's Basketball Season 2) - 141 votes!

>Free!: Eternal Summer - 120 votes!

>Haikyuu!! - 107 votes!

Kuroko won?... and Ping Pong finished last?... HAHHAHAHA SUCK ON THAT PING PONG FANBOYS!! WHERE'S YOUR GOD NOW?!! FUCK YEAH!! (no but for real though I find Kuroko amazing and I love it so, so much but I did not think for a second it'd win the category... this makes me kind of happy.)

**Best Science-Fiction of 2014**

>Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (The Irregular at Magic High School) - 203 votes!

>Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu / Parasyte -the maxim- - 150 votes!

>Sword Art Online II - 93 votes!

I did vote for Mahouka, it does the Sci-fi genre the best out of these series, albeit it's probably the worst anime out of the bunch IMO.

**Best Action/Shounen of 2014**

>Hunter x Hunter (2011) - 197 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works (TV) - 137 votes!

>Kill la Kill - 75 votes!

This is a surprise... I did vote for HxH but I thought it'd be a close standoff with Bahamut... clearly not enough people appreciated that series.

**Best Male character of 2014**

>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 252 votes!

>Killua Zoldyck (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 111 votes!

>Yato (Noragami) and Wenge Kong (Ping Pong the Animation) (tie) - 69 votes!

What? for fucking real? I mean I'm glad Inaho didn't win this crap but I can only give this one to the circlejerk on someone cheating the poll... how is Tatsuya the best Male character? he's not even close to the depth or development to the others, in fact the only one I find him better than is Tomoda and Inaho out of all the contestants... just how?

**Best Female character of 2014**

>Rin Tohsaka (Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works) - 118 votes!

>Chiyo Sakura (Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun / Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun) - 74 votes!

>Asuna Yuuki (Sword Art Online II) - 61 votes!

Meh, all the mainstream ones got the votes, though I suppose Sakura and Rin at the very least are worth the votes they recieved, you guys don't have enough love for Hatoko though.^TensaiBeatNibutani!^Woohoo!

**Best Character Development of 2014**

>Seishuu Handa (Barakamon) - 67 votes!

>Shinichi Izumi (Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu / Parasyte -the maxim-) - 54 votes!

Wasn't aware people thought Meruem had such good character development, I mean it was good but I think Handa Seishuu (my vote), Izumi Shinichi and Kong Wenge all had greater development.

**Best Male Protagonist of 2014**

>Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei / The Irregular at Magical High School) - 141 votes!

Come the fuck on guys... Araragi was barely even in Hanamonogatari and fucking Tatsuya again?... well atleast Handa finished 5th.

**Best last Episode of 2014**

>Tokyo Ghoul - 69 votes!

>Ping Pong the Animation - 66 votes!

I don't know... despite how much I feel like Ping Pong is overrated and doesn't deserve half of the praise it's getting around here it should have won this one because that last ep was amazing, Tokyo Ghoul could've also won this with no complaints but I'm not sure I can agree to Barakamon.

**Best Artstyle of 2014**

>No Game No Life - 126 votes!

>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - 81 votes!

>Space Dandy - 52 votes!

Yeah, I really enjoyed the art of NGNL albeit I enjoyed the excellent use of switches between artstyles in Nisekoi even more, on a sidenote I'm glad Glasslip made it as far as it did, I nominated it in the wild card because I find the art in Glasslip to be it's only redeeming quality and it seems people agree with me.

>Esdeath (Akame ga Kill!) - 108 votes!

>Slaine Troyard (Aldnoah.Zero) - 76 votes!

>Meruem (Hunter x Hunter 2011) - 75 votes!

I don't know, there was no character in Akame ga Kill I found to be very good, Slaine on the other hand was well written and is interesting to watch, Meruem was also a very well made antagonist.

**Best OP Music of 2014**

>Database (Log Horizon series) - 78 votes!

>Unravel (Tokyo Ghoul) - 56 votes!

>Hikaru Nara / If You Will Shine (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Osu / Your Lie in April) - 53 votes!

Database is overrated... but still pretty good so I can see why it won even though I'd rather have Unravel win. Though you people are severely underestimating the Haikyuu!! opening.

>Kill la Kill - 48 votes!

WOOOOOOOW!! Really? I personally believe Aldnoah.Zero to be vastly superior to any of the other entries in this category, I mean sure KLK had good OST and so did ZnT but they don't even come close to what Sawano Hiroyuki pulled off in A.Z.. and it only got 34 votes? I am pretty fucking surprised by this outcome.

Thank you! I appreciate it!

I liked tatsuya shiba for best male charachter. For awhile now anime studios doing shonen have been spewing out super flawed main charachters so that it's easy to give them charachter development. And then they just keep beating you over the head with their flaws and foibles. You just correct some of the hyper-unrealistic idiosyncrasies, and suddenly charachter growth. It feels very pandering, and is really annoying to watch. 

Tatsuya Shibas charachter is a big fuck you to all that.
>> ARTICLE
But at the same time he's so bland... he literally has 0 development and everyone in the show is a device to show how OP he is without him actually doing very much...
>> ARTICLE
> everyone in the show is a device to show how OP he is without him actually doing very much

Thats just a side effect of him being op as fuck whilst not being flashy/ keeping things secretive. Also the anime adaptation being pretty mediocre and not explaining anything.

I too was getting pretty fed up with main characters who was clearly inferior to the antagonist but just 'barely' winning by power of friendship/ justice/ willpower right, training for x time or, my personal hate, plot armour (fuck you Kirito). Tatsuya being op as fuck from the beginning, who just completely shat all over the antagonists (amusingly to the level thats a lot like how the main antagonists in shonens shit all over the good guys when they first see him) was a nice change. 

If it makes you feel any better I can only see the Divine Tatsuya worship dropping off in the future. No season 2 (atleast as far as we can tell) and season 1 has enough hate I think to dissuade people from watching it (atleast on this subreddit). There will always be a core crowd (people who read the books cos they are good imo) who will continue the worship but you get that with almost any anime. 
>> ARTICLE
True enough, I think it's not just a side effect though, if you look at Sakamaki Izayoi from Mondaiji, he's the same kind of OP that Tatsuya is but he has way more personality and the side characters are also of relevance and has personalities in comparison to the people in Mahouka.

Well being salty won't change the result.
>> ARTICLE
Both points are seen that way due to poor adaptation imo.

> True enough, I think it's not just a side effect though, if you look at Sakamaki Izayoi from Mondaiji, he's the same kind of OP that Tatsuya is but he has way more personality

This is in more detail in the books but basically Tatsuya is incapable of feeling strong emotions except being over protective of his sister due to magic lobotomy. Hence why he seems so bland in the anime. He shows a lot of his personality by thinking (since he generally doesn't speak much because its not worth the effort) but this isn't shown in the anime. Tatsuya has no problems with being bored. 

> the side characters are also of relevance and has personalities in comparison to the people in Mahouka.

Side characters also has a lot of relevance in the books but the anime didnt show it. There were prob too much to animate and not enough time. They cut out an entire volume which focused almost entirely on side characters only. Lots of the scenes involving side characters were just cut out (along with the pretty detailed technomagic babble at magic works). 

Personally drowning in too much salt from /u/jordy56's polls to care about this one.

Serious question: HxH ? Why?

Awesome cast of characters, A vast world to explore, great villains and the best character development imo.
The anime ended in a good place where if togashi writes more manga it could open endless possiblities for the show,
>> ARTICLE
Have you watched it and are questioning it? Or have you not watched it?
>> ARTICLE
I have not watch it and was looking for an opinion about it.
>> ARTICLE
Simply because HxH on 2014 had the best year-run of episodes anime has ever seen, with the ending of the anime and especially the ending of the Chimera Ant Arc, best arc in anime history hands down.
>> ARTICLE
If you are in anyway remotely interested or not put off by action/adventures with strategic battles and high episodes counts, I'd say give it a go. In fact I'd say give it a go anyway. 

Hunter x Hunter is a show that starts off good and only gets better with every episode. It's has amazing characters (in particular its villains) that carry an incredible story. There's an over arching plot line but really its "the little detours" our protagonists go on that makes HxH really special. 

I won't tell you what it's actually about because I think it's one of those shows best experienced embarking on the journey from episode one knowing nothing at all. Just a tip though, the second arc (Yorknew city arc) will make you mind up to whether the show is for you or not so if you dont like that arc, there's probably no point watching the next hundred episodes. 

Hope that helped and you decide to watch it. It's not highly acclaimed and AotY contender for nothing.


>> ARTICLE
Thank you. As I am right now picking a new series to watch the ones that have caught my eyes were Legend of the Galactic Heroes or HxH.

Both are lengthy so I didn't want to comit to a large series if it wasn't good at all.

Thanks for the opinion bhvgcf!
>> ARTICLE
would you meteor?
>> ARTICLE
You're welcome :) HxH is one of shows you just gotta share

edit: grammar yo
>> ARTICLE
I just finished watching the show a few days ago. I'd say, at the very least watch through the Greed Island arc.  That was probably my 2nd favorite arc.  The Hunter Exam arc was my favorite.  But Greed Island finally starts to give you a taste of Gon's power.  It also has the best ED: "Reason".

The Chimera Ant arc is very, very different from the rest of the show, in my opinion, and dragged on for way too long. It ended extremely well though.

Overall, the show is great, the soundtrack is very good, and there are many cool characters.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. This is pretty much the exact opposite opinion of most fans. The Chimera Ant and Yorkshin arcs are overwhelmingly the most popular, and Greed Island and the Hunter Exam are generally the least popular.

If you really liked the Hunter Exam that much you might be interested in checking out the 1999 version of the show. While everything else may be up for debate, I think most would agree that arc was definitely better in the original.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Greed Island was by far the worst arc for me
>> ARTICLE
That's really interesting to me.

I really don't get why Yorknew is so beloved. I'd rank the Arena arc above that one. The Phantom Troupe had some interesting characters, but they were underutilized.  It revolved around Kurapika mostly, and Kurapika was honestly a pretty boring character to me, despite being voiced by my favorite seiyuu.

The way the Chimera Ant arc wrapped up was fantastic and really surprising to me...but it really changed the tone of the show for me, and it just wasn't fun for me for the first 20 or so episodes of the arc.
>> ARTICLE
YES! Everyone I've met loves the Yorknew arc, and while I wouldnt put it above Heavens Arena, it wasn't very fun. The only interesting parts were the auctions and the [Ep. 50-ish](/s "Kurapika vs. Uvogin fight.") Everything else was mediocre, but maybe that was because I had read up till the very beginning of Greed Island in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Nope, 2011 Hisoka is the best thing to grace anime, without him what's the point?
>> ARTICLE
Greed Island was amazing. Currently on episode 114 (the narration-heavy episodes). So far the Chimera Ant Arc is my favorite. Initially I was put off by it's length and told myself that since it took up almost half the show, it better be pretty damn good. So far I haven't been disappointed. 
>> ARTICLE
Dude get off reddit. If you're on episode 114.. You must continue immediately.

Btw chimera ant arc is my favourite arc but I didnt really start to love it until the final 20 episodes, so if you love it already you're in for a wild ride mate.

The assault was one of the most intense load of episodes I've ever seen.

Everything I knew about good pacing prior to those episodes screamed "this shouldn't work" but the intensity and just all round amazingness that was taking place made me not care. Especially 116 onwards. Incredible.

I gave a quick scroll on the other comments, although I did not watch  Ping Pong yet, I feel confident enough to give my vote to Hunter X Hunter (2011), this revitalisation and also continuation really bought one of my favorite manga and anime series from my childhood back to life. Hisoka is still a creep perv though.
Honorable mention to Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season, one of the few "Sports" anime that is actually great, a step above Prince of Tennis in my opinion. Not sure if sports or battle anime though, the guys from KnB and PoT could easily be in a fighting genre anime with their powers.

1. Hunter x Hunter
2. Parasyte
>> ARTICLE
1) Parasyte 
2) Hunter X Hunter 
3) Ping Pong the Animation 
4) Space Brothers 
5) Kill la Kill 

Still haven't seen the second half of Wixoss, the first half of Fate, or the terror anime but I feel like those 5 are probably gonna stay in my top list. On my personal list I wouldn't put on Parasyte since it still airing this doesn't count and would add silver spoon instead, but since this subreddit has such terrible taste nobody added on silver spoon. 
>> ARTICLE
You can add Silver Spoon yourself. 
>> ARTICLE
This is such a hard choice, but I have to go with No Game No Life. It is probably in my top 5 anime (yes, I do have shit taste). My other picks would be F/SN UBW, KLK, and Akame ga Kill. Hunter x Hunter is also fantastic.

Wow, didn't even notice it wasn't in. It definitely should be here 

Edit: [](#mandom)
>> ARTICLE
Agreed! I would personally argue it's my favourite of the year, next to Nozaki-kun and WIXOSS.
>> ARTICLE
My top three are probably Barakamon, Ping Pong and Witch Craft Works. WIXOSS was unexpectedly good too, and Nozaki-kun was hilarious 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Ping Pong, but Witch Craft Works was a fun show as well. But I can't say it was among my favourites. It did have, by far, the best ED of 2014.
>> ARTICLE
You should try Ping Pong out. Especially if you've tried Yuasa's other works like The Tatami Galaxy and Mind Game. 
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong is overrated, it was good but not that good.. that is my humble opinion at the very least.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, it has extremely well written characters, but almost everything else about the show is rather unremarkable. Or distracting like the art style and animation. The characters carry it to an 8.5  *at best* imho. Aoty for me is Parasyte; HxH had some great parts, but it also had terrible parts(overall probably close to an 8.5 as well). I cant even think of something to complain about Parasyte off the top of my head.
>> ARTICLE
If I were to complain about Parasyte it'd be something along the lines of the side characters being very one-dimensional and undeveloped, but all in all I agree, AOTY 2014.
>> ARTICLE
It's all up to the person if they like it or not, I've heard it's high on Character Development, which is what I want in anime.
>> ARTICLE
It did have impressive character development and the story was good but not even close to as good as people want to make it seem but it's pretty lackluster in the remaining areas, honestly I believe it to be the most overhyped series of 2014... not to say it's bad because it's definitely not.

Keep in mind that many people haven't seen Ping Pong, so it would still be understandable even if No Game No Life beat out Ping Pong.

They should have something to compensate for the dependency on having seen it.  It would be interesting if we could see votes and rankings for anime *after* controlling for what anime people had seen in addition to it.  My guess is that more people would pick No Game No Life over Ping Pong, but that if you *controlled for people who had seen both* it would be a lot closer.  That's just one of the demerits of these polls.

2014 felt pretty lackluster for me at least, very few anime above an 8/10.  

That being said Ping Pong and Mushishi were easily the best, if I had to pick a third it would probably be WIXOSS, I just loved the shit out of that series even with all the things wrong with it (more so in the second season). Parasyte deserves a vote from me too but I have a thing against voting for/putting shows in a top list when they aren't complete.

I feel bad voting on this because there were so many shows that I didn't vote for simply because I haven't seen them yet.

There's a big difference between not voting for a show because I haven't seen it and not voting for one because it wasn't good enough, and this poll doesn't capture that.

That said, I fucking loved Kill La Kill and it looks like it might win, so yay.

Yes. I just figured it would be common sense, wouldn't it? This is a poll for 2014.

Well yeah i guess that does make sense, but few people on reddit(including myself) use their common sense lol. Anyways, I have a feeling most people would still vote for HxH based on their feelings of the anime *as a whole* instead of just the 2014 episodes even if you did edit the op for clarity.

At the time of this comment, No Game No Life is just about taking the lead.

How did that beat Ping Pong?!

Because these weren't official vote polls pretty much. Nobody cared since there was like 70 different polls, and this was just one of them. People jsut got tired of voting. 

Although that being said, I did think it was better than ping pong.

Doesn't make much sense that Meruem won best character development and not best villain. Well, I guess everyone has their own definition of villain (?)

Yeah, Tatsuya also wasn't the best or best main male character, imo, but I bet he won because /r/OneTrueTatsuya. He was amazing, but not the best.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't even say amazing... ^()^()^()^()^()^()^()^()^(have mercy)
>> ARTICLE
I found him amazing overall, but I recognize he's not the best character and he seems barely three-dimensional.^lol Also, the reason I find him amazing is more for his OPness and actions rather than him being an amazing character, per se. Peco, Smile, Dandy, Joseph Joestar, and Handa-sensei are examples of amazing characters; Tatsuya is not.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but It's Old Joseph. Not the young one.
>> ARTICLE
Isshuukan beat Ping Pong because many more people watched the former than the latter. You can't really expect people to vote for something they haven't seen no matter how loud the *"but it's really, really good!"* voices may be.

Sure, had these awards been done by committee I would fully expect Ping Pong to breeze to victory, but they weren't done that way, they were done by popular vote. Isshuukan winning a popularity contest is fine by me, and it is certainly a hell of a lot better than Mahouka winning the award.

I certainly know that these votes are by popularity, like any vote on /r/anime.  
Still sad though.

Ping Pong actually came in third, behind Isshuukan Friends and No Game No Life. I think people saw Isshuukan Friends and thought 'Well, NGNL/Ping Pong is my favorite here, but I also liked Isshuukan Friends and I don't think it's going to get many votes...'
>> ARTICLE
Actually, Ishhuukan Friends is my favourite here, slightly beating Ping Pong.

Unless the selection of Tatsuya was meant as a satirical jab at the homogenization of the male MC that particular award seems like a clear example of ballot stuffing.

Other than that the rest of results are, more in less, in line with what you might expect from /r/anime. 

Good job on handling these awards, OP, it may have taken longer  to complete than it takes Goku to go super saiyan but all in all I'd say this was pretty successful. Do you plan to do it again next year?  
>> ARTICLE
See, this is why i think only people who have seen both anime can vote for them as this is to compare those anime, no point if people just go with the one they have seen and ignore the other.
>> ARTICLE
As of right now, yes. I'm definitely looking for advice on how to make it shorter though, it dragged on way longer than it needed to in my opinion, but I don't know how I would have made it shorter other than cutting down the number of awards. Any ideas?
>> ARTICLE
Best Abs was a nice idea, but ended up being a joke in the end. It was meant to be a way for people to show their appreciation for male characters in the same way they were appreciating female characters in Best Boobs, but Mikasa Ackerman still made top 3. If male characters can't have an award like that all to themselves the way female characters get Best Boobs, I don't think either should be included. Maybe you could do Most Attractive Male and Most Attractive Female awards instead, but that entire concept is the easiest to jettison if you're looking to cut down.

I don't think there needed to be an award for best fight scene, funniest moment, or best first and last episodes. It's a lot harder to remember that kind of stuff than it is to remember what you felt about an entire series. I remember seeing the voting threads for those and going "well okay guess I can't participate tonight."

As has been mentioned, OP/ED and OP/ED Song don't need to be separate. People like me who don't watch OPs/EDs but listen to the song will just vote for the song in the OP/ED thread, and people who watch the OP/ED will vote for song + visuals. I honestly had no idea there was a separate thread exclusively for the songs.

As has also been mentioned, I don't think each genre needs its own award. I remember voting on some of them, but then not really caring about those results when the results were revealed.
>> ARTICLE
I'd disagree on the Best Fight Scene reasoning if no other reason than because the poll thread included video links.
>> ARTICLE
Fewer awards, for a start; no pointless stuff like 'best boobs', not much point in having separate awards for both OP/ED and *OP/ED song*, an award for every genre is unnecessary.

Voting periods were too long, most people are going to vote when they first see the thread and if you could somehow convince the mods to sticky 'X Award voting thread' onto the top of the sub for, say, 48 hours, that should be enough time for the majority of users to vote.

Finally, you didn't need a separate thread for every award. Should have just done it all in one, big, fancy, post. 
>> ARTICLE
>no pointless stuff like 'best boobs'

Pointless? HERESY! If /r/anime can't have one communal favorite pair of boobs to look back on and say "Yep, those were *the tits* of 2014", what can we have?
>> ARTICLE
> Fewer awards, for a start; no pointless stuff like 'best boobs', not much point in having separate awards for both OP/ED and OP/ED song, an award for every genre is unnecessary.

I agree on the difference between OP/ED and OP/ED songs. I didn't really think that through. As for best boobs, all of the categories were voted on by the community. Even if I just included the top 10, best boobs would have made it in. Not that I necessarily agree with the inclusion of it.

>You didn't need a separate thread for every award. Should have just done it all in one, big, fancy post.

With the detail I put into the threads, there would have to be multiple threads. I could definitely tone that down though, or just do that for the finals.
>> ARTICLE
About Best Boobs, if it were me I would have just ignored* the people calling for it. It's not like you *have* to listen to everyone's opinion, and I would wager that a decent portion of the people who voted to include Best Boobs were the same people who turned around and mocked the decision for cheap karma. 

Of course, it is a community event and so getting the /r/anime community involved is key, but as the man with the plan you shouldn't shy away from acting a little dictatorial when the going calls for it. 


edit- 'ignored' isn't right... more like, *politely explained* why Best Boobs would not be included in the /r/anime awards. 
>> ARTICLE
Another thing is that the best boobs thread was actually by far the most popular of the entire event. It had over 2000 upvotes, and the next poll thread had like 96. Idk.. we'll see for next year. I'm probably going to do the same thing to get people to submit their own categories then vote on those.

I would suggest that you choose 80 percent or so of the awards beforehand and then have a few community nominated awards.  That way you may be able to organize threads and scheduling in advance, take some burden off of yourself and allow the timeline for the awards to run quicker.

Just watched that and I disagree completely. For one that fight was like half an hour, most of it being talking and monologues, so from the get go it falls into a lot of shounen bullshit. Secondly the animation wasnt exactly the best either, it wasnt bad dont get me wrong but it wasnt the best animation ever (Which it should be considering how you're saying its the best fight in all of anime.), Again can I bring up the monologue issue? Like seriously, atleast 20 minutes of that fight was monologue and the fight was 30 minutes thats fucking insane. 

I mean the fight wasnt bad, but if anything I would put it slightly below Naruto vs Sasuke (Naruto Part 1) and the main drawbacks from both of those fights were the constant monologues, the thing is the Naruto vs Sasuke fight had very great animation especially for the time, whereas the animation in HxH isnt exactly anything to speak of. And I know i'm just going to get downvoted for saying this as I do if I say anything that claims that HxH isnt THE BEST thing since sliced bread, but you're really overselling it by calling most things in it "The best in all of anime". This poll proved nothing as it was one giant popularity contest, and we saw that at its finest during the spring poll.
>> ARTICLE
Obviously if you only see the fight, it won't be as impactful. That's what makes it so great, that it actually has depth to it and it's not just eye candy. Maybe lancer vs archer could have won best animated fight, but best fight? Pls that was so shallow it hurt.
>> ARTICLE
I can see what you mean, whenever I think of best fight I usually go straight to animation rather than reasons behind it or such.
>> ARTICLE
Some important factors in a fight: The emotional/significance impact, the build-up, the importance and the development of the characters fighting along with animation and quality of the fight. The Hunter x Hunter fight excels in the areas of build up, character development and significance along with having some nice animation and quality (not the best in quality and animation). But the build up and significance of this fight if what puts it above the others. The shear hype for this fight along with its importance is what puts it over the edge as a fight that will live through the ages. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, build up and hype I will give it that over some of the other fights in 2014. 
>> ARTICLE
Completely disagree but I'll upvote for it being your opinion and you shouldn't be rained in downvotes cause of it.

The animation isn't even bad, far from it, to say Naruto did it better is a huge insult, not that Naruto was bad but that fight is almost ten years old, there's no way that animation is better.

As for the constant talking and inner monologues, Hunter x Hunter always has the monologues, it explains their strategies and thought process and I personally love them but I understand someone not. But for the tlaking, the fights circumstances were that Meruem had to defeat Netero without killing him so he tried a lot to talk Netero into surrendering, it was absolutely necessary.

And finally, to clear things up, I didn't say it was the best, just one of them, I don't even know if I think that's the best fight in HxH. 
>> ARTICLE
> The animation isn't even bad, far from it, to say Naruto did it better is a huge insult, not that Naruto was bad but that fight is almost ten years old, there's no way that animation is better.

Age shouldnt be a factor in it, personally I think [this](http://youtu.be/1yF25q4OL_4?t=7m50s) has better animation than Mereum vs Netero. It might just be my preference to Studio Pierrot when they do fights like this, but it looks a lot more smoother and the choreography was also better IMO. Not to mention I think that the animation for that fight was ahead of its time, and was my favorite for quite awhile.

>As for the constant talking and inner monologues, Hunter x Hunter always has the monologues, it explains their strategies and thought process and I personally love them but I understand someone not.

I honestly wouldnt mind it too much if the monologue wasnt like 20 minutes throughout the entire fight. If it was a short fight I could forgive it very easily, I mean after all I like [Kiritsugu vs Kirei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSgXOZKSt20) from Fate/Zero quite a bit despite the monologue and strategies. I wouldnt place it in my top 10 fights because of animation and the monologue is indeed a bit of a problem, but it doesnt take up 20 minutes which is why its forgivable.

> But for the tlaking, the fights circumstances were that Meruem had to defeat Netero without killing him so he tried a lot to talk Netero into surrendering, it was absolutely necessary.

I think they could find some other ways around that, rather than having them talk for 20 minutes. And that still is no excuse for the battle itself having the monologue, it may make sense in context of the story but we're talking about the battle itself here.

>And finally, to clear things up, I didn't say it was the best, just one of them, I don't even know if I think that's the best fight in HxH.

Even then I disagree quite a bit, I wouldnt place it near one of the best as there are many many many fights that are leagues above that. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like I realize the difference between us now. When we see Fight Scene, you focus on the Fight part while I focus on the Scene part.

While I agree as just a fight, Meruem vs Netero isn't amazing but it's all the components to it that are involved in the actual storyline and character development.  Both are valid ways of seeing it but for me personally, I care more about what the fight does for the anime and what it means as a whole and not if it looks awesome in an AMV (Best way I can thing of describing it at the moment)
>> ARTICLE
Meh, I guess so. I never really thought of fight scenes that way, but not to be super pedantic but the award was suppose to be "Best Fight/Battle". And if we go by how your outlook i'd still say Fate/Stay Night wins, but instead of Archer vs Lancer I would say Archer vs Caster as the entire point of that fight was to outline the similarities of Archer and Shirou while at the same time show their main difference. It becomes more apparent why thats extremely important in S2, but nonetheless its a very big piece of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Whether or not the Caster vs Archer fight's character dynamics are important in the second season or the quality of the animation/choreography, or even how it was done in the LN, that episode is probably where the writing hit its lowest point. Just as anime watcher, I thought that episode sucked for the most part.
>> ARTICLE
Why do you think it sucked?
>> ARTICLE
I decided to rewatch the Archer + Shirou bits of the episode to see if I still felt the same way and although it didn't annoy as much as it did before 
(maybe I was in a worse mood last time), it had all the problems I remember.

The interactions between Archer and Shirou just come off as irrational and melodramatic, more so given the dire circumstances they are in the time (being between a wounded Caster and nearby Assassin). What they were saying was little more than a bunch of trumped up psuedo-philosophy and I really struggled to grasp what if anything Shirou would have as a basis for the levels of resentment he felt towards Archer (and vice-versa). Everything about it just seemed really childish, both the characters and writer.

Barakamon is a quiet slice of life show, I liked the last episode but idk, I don't think it was any better than the rest of the series (which was fantastic). I'm surprised TG or Aldnoah didn't win.

>Ok. I'm drawing the conclusion that /r/anime  hasn't seen SAOII and has only seen the OP of Tokyo ghoul.

For best soundtrack? Zankyou no Terror and Aldnoah.Zero were the only contenders.

I'm not sure what method you used to select the initial lists of contenders for each award, but it was very odd. There tended to be some very strange inclusions and a lot of major omissions.
>> ARTICLE
The method I used was having people from the community decide. If you look at [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ro3ci/ranime_awards_2014_category_nominations/), I just took all of the nominees from the people that commented there.

Other then that I am a bit salty about ping pong not winning spring and about the [insult of Tatsuya winning not one but two categories...](http://i.imgur.com/VMRwZSL.gif)

Furthermore I think Haikyuu deserved the best sports award (and I really like KnB btw.)
But Well some disappointments are to be expected, all right. ^sth. ^about ^shit ^taste
>> ARTICLE
100% agree on Haikyuu. I don't know about you, but I do think Kuroko uses to many stills and has dropped off in terms of the amount of fluid animations and impactful scenes. Kuroko won due to manga popularity imo.
>> ARTICLE
well best male character and best male main character are basically the same, because usually the Mc is the one with the most fans, and Tatsuya is literally a god


>> ARTICLE
the circlejerk around him doesnt negate that he is a bad character though. But I guess thats the problem with these votings. It remains a popularity/prominence thing.
>> ARTICLE
I think you need to realize that "Tatsuya is a bad character", although a reasonable and justifiable stance, is simply your own subjective opinion, and the opinion contrary to yours, is also a reasonable and justifiable subjective opinion, all based on personal values and biases on what constitutes a "good character"

Polls such as these should always be treated as a popularity contest, or simply, a contest in which the prominent values and opinions would win, and we should not be thinking that our opinion is "correct" or "superior"
>> ARTICLE
Not all opinions are equal, and they sure as hell aren't all valid, even in art. Pretty sure if you talk to anyone who has a good understanding of tropes in anime will tell you the same thing about the character, and all good things I've heard about him have been from people who don't understand those tropes or haven't seen them before until now. 

I will happily concede to being wrong if you could point me in the direction of a well written character analysis of tatsuya that ends with the conclusion of him being a great character. This isn't a joke or anything, and I'm not trying to come off as an ass, I'm very serious. I've seen many posts detailing why someone absolutely loved a show that I didn't, and giving me a new appreciation for the show, so if the same can be done for this show, all the better. But good luck honestly finding a well thought out post on why mahouka and specifically tatsuya is a good character. 

I realize you aren't defending the character, I just needed to say that. I feel like a lot of people have this idea that everything is subjective and there is no right and wrong or whatever and I just don't agree. That's basically saying there are people out there who think that a character that showed up in one episode of gintama have as much character as Shinji ikari and its all an opinion. No, it fucking isn't. 
>> ARTICLE
i think you misunderstood the position i am taking, but since i have little intention in going into the finer philosophical details and technicalities in regards to "opinions", and i do believe we both do not want to turn this into a discussion on academics, i will simply reiterate my stance and see if you agree or disagree:

"there is no "objective standard" in which one evaluates anime characters, and every judgement of whether or not a character is "good" or "bad" is based on our own subjective interpretations and personal values and biases. therefore, since we cannot be truly "correct", we should have the attitude of being fair and tolerant towards different opinions, and understand their position by respecting the conclusion they made, engage in a conversation by discussing ideas and arguments instead of who is right or wrong, and ultimately embrace our differences"

i just think you have misunderstood me greatly, as my stance was never, nor did i claim, that "all opinions are equal" or that "everything is subjective", nor are the two even relevant to the position i am taking. although, if it was my mistake of being unclear, i apologize

the strength of an opinion lies with its reasoning and logic, not its conclusion, and there can be right or wrong when it comes to "objective values". however, my reply was to simply illustrate, albeit maybe poorly, that "Tatsuya is a bad character" is not an objective truth, but a subjective interpretation, and should be treated and discussed as such, hence whether or not a person agrees, should be based on the arguments presented, instead of treating it as a factual truth and shoving it down other people's throat. this attitude of superiority that strives towards a false understanding of "objectivity", is very unhealthy

hopefully this long-winded rant clears up any misunderstanding we might have
>> ARTICLE
Of course I agree with you there. Discussing ...anything really will always be subjective and if it`s about fiction or rather discussing how good certain aspects of said fiction are this is even more true. Sorry If I didnt made this fact clear enough in my original statement or behaved somewhat snobbish/ elitist.

On the other hand we`re nevertheless still spending our time here discussing these things and saying "all this is subjective anyways so why bother arguing about it" would just be boring and would make most of the discussion on here pointless.

With that in mind I`ll keep gladly defending my opinion against arguments that may br brought up by the other side or maybe be convinced by them who knows.

Oh and if you want explanation for this specific case (as to why *I* consider Tatsuya a bad character) I wrote something about that above although now that I look over it again it kind of resembles a rant and not a objective argument too so theres that.
>> ARTICLE
no no, i should apologize if you think i sound somewhat condescending, i just have a certain bias when it comes to the objectivity and subjectivity of opinions. 

i personally think that we should embrace our personal values and biases when discussing and analyzing anime, throw the obsession with objectivity out the window and let our subjectivity clash; we should be fair and tolerant when discussion opinions, and i find the attitude of striving for the inconsistent standards of objectivity, rather unhealthy 

if i misunderstood you, i'm sorry 

and i do not have any intention of disagreeing with your opinion that "Tatsuya is a bad character", it is a completely reasonable opinion, i was just being oddly sensitive about some words
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure I voted for tatsuya for the lolz, as did many people I'm sure. 
>> ARTICLE
what didnt you like about him?
>> ARTICLE
Well the fact that he is indeed invincible might be appealing for some but i personally think that it just makes for a really boring experience without any suspense.

Furthermore correct me if I just missed something but he was just a really plain and undefined so to say "self-insert" character who had no particular traits beside being an OP yet modest cool and serious yet sometimes edgy person with a (again in my opinion) implied incest relationship to his sister whos actually the said to be the second amazing person on the planet besides him. He seemes to be crafted after the "Kirito recipe of success" if you know what I mean and I personally just dont think that makes for a good character.

I think to sum up my opinion and to reverse your question: There just isnt anything to like about his character is there?
>> ARTICLE
well at the start of the series you dont know that hes op, at the start hes just a smart high school student that is not particularly good at magic

what i liked about his character is that even if hes smart, handsome, strong he was not born with all this characteristics [spoiler dont know if its completely covert in the anime ](/s "hes smart because when he was 6 yo they did a experiment on him and replaced a part of his brain") and the fact that he doesnt fall in love with other girls because hes unable to have strong emotions, at least they tried to explain it instead of having a dense MC just for the sake of it

i too am not a fan of incest but this for me is the most easy too swallow with the onii-sama saved my life and had a miserable childhood part, but i didnt watch too many animes with incest(monogatari and chaika where it wasnt actually incest) so maybe for others the incest part looks bad

i didnt see SAO so i dont know if tatsuya resembles kirito, but i liked tatsuya because of the backstory and made me read the manga to find more about it(planning to read the LN too when i have the chance)
>> ARTICLE
>well at the start of the series you dont know that hes op, at the start hes just a smart high school student that is not particularly good at magic

Explain the prologue where he blows up shit with his power armor and magic.

Even your spoiler serves as proof that Tatsuya *must* be a special goddamn snowflake - [he can't](/s "innanely use magic properly, so let's turn him into a superweapon with no emotions using a lobotomy while we're at it.")

Also, the LN says he's average-looking, so logically all the girls in the show swoon over him.
>> ARTICLE
Well he is a special snowflake, hes from one of the 10 clans so the fact that magic is genetic and from hes clan was one of the most powerful mages. So because he was practically useles they experimented on him. 

I dont think i saw the prologue, i watched the series from crunchyroll so if the prologue is there then i saw it, i am  on mobile so i cant check

If there is one thing that these polls showed me is that more people really should watch Ping Pong the Animation.  I know people are probably sick of the people yelling and screaming about how Ping Pong is the best thing ever but I've run into more than a few people who refuse to watch it because 'its ugly' or 'I don't watch sports anime' and I feel sad because they are missing out on a legitimately a great series.

Also more people probably should watch Mushishi since it got no recognition here either but I'm equally guilty of that.

The animation is very key with the fluidity and quality along with the characters competing. The animation prob killed it though. I don't think kuroko should have one with the amount of abnoxious stills and how few good movement sequences there actually are, but I do think the animation is key.

Well I think many consider its strong point to be character development and not really the ping pong(/sport) itself as youre probably aware. Last place does still not make much sense though.

Yes, yes, we all know you all want Ping Pong in it.

But aside from that. Nagi no Asukara as best romance when other better options were there (Ao Haru Ride, Golden Time,...). It's discussable. I don't know either. Choosing for a True Romance over that whole thing in NagiAsu, maybe, maybe not.

Best ED Zankyou no Terror? That just won because people grouped it with the soundtrack, nothing else.

If I took a closer look at some other categories I could come up with more. But it looks like it became popular with a certain demography and only those paid attention to it. I didn't even realize this was going between all the other stuff there was.

IIRC, the [Nomination Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2ro3ci/ranime_awards_2014_category_nominations/) was confusing as fuck to use/participate in. Granted i didn't watch many seasonal animes last year myself, some of the nominations that made it through were like "..Really??" 

For Future Nomination Threads, i think a Collective-Elimination vote would serve as a better format. Take Every Title from the year, break them all down in catagories, Make the public vote 10 out of each. Top 10 in each catagory goes on to the Finals (The Award Show).

I don't really see how the nomination thread was confusing. If anything, I thought it was really simple. You find the category you want and then you vote for your anime/character/whatever. It wasn't that hard. Even if you asked me a question I did my best to be clear and make sense while explaining what to do/how it worked. I was even willing to link to a thread if you couldn't find it. 

I think I might actually still do this. I'm going to finish posting these poll threads daily and then do one big thread with all of the categories limited to just 10 nominees or 5 for the less popular ones (like sports in this case.)

idk, maybe im just retareded (not even joking hahaha), Well now looking at it as it sits (complete), it's not so bad. The last i looked at it was as soon as it was posted-several hours after.

Here are my personal favourites from the particular genres (trying to make it so that the strength of the genre dictates my choice):

* Comedy: Mangaka-san to Assistant-san

The only show of the year where I can honestly say I was laughing from start to finish every single episode (and during each of the full length OVAs). The particular brand of comedy it supplies is far from for everyone but it worked so well for me.

* Slice of Life: Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou

Sakurasou is my favourite show of all time and I think Kawaisou is the closest any anime has come to replicating the humour and setting. The romance was brilliant even though [](/s "it didn't develop as far as we all would have liked"). The humour was wonderful and the characters were unique and colourful. It was a show with a lot of heart and I hope it gets a second season at some point.

* Harem: Nisekoi

The best way to compare harems is by their girls and every girl in Nisekoi is a serious best girl candidate. The reaction gifs and humour are marvelous and SHAFT did a ridiculously good job keeping their SHAFTiness *relatively* contained.

* Thriller: WIXOSS

Continuous plot twists, lots of suffering, an interesting premise and fantastic delivery.

* ~~Sports~~

Not a fan of the genre, didn't watch any of the options. Tried to watch Ping Pong but unfortunately I have huge trouble getting into shows with art styles that I don't like.

* Romance: Sakura Trick

Continuous kissing, which funnily enough is rather unique. Maybe it's not the best show ever but the romance had me from start to finish and has kept me rewatching particular scenes since the show ended.

* Science Fiction: Aldnoah.Zero

This was a hard section since I'm not sure Aldnoah would deserve it. Parasyte isn't Sci-Fi enough for me to vote for it and I haven't seen a lot of the rest. Aldnoah was very entertaining at least, even though the writing was at times disappointing.

* Action/Battle Shounen: Noragami

The premise, the characters and the action were all great. Not much else to say. Hiyori best girl.

> Romance: Sakura Trick

It had some great potential, but I flipt a table when it turned into the most generic yuri anime ever 5 episodes in. Like it wasn't even funny how generic it became. Such a shame, because it could've been a lot better than it was if not for that.
>> ARTICLE
> the most generic yuri anime ever

If you know another yuri anime with kissing (let alone that much kissing) please, *please* enlighten me.

The plot was pretty typical of SoLs but the execution was not.

> If you go to the MAL page and see that a movie isn't from this year, I'm including it! I'm going by the blu-ray release dates for movies, because that is when we were more likely to be able to see them! 


>> ARTICLE
The movies started airing in theatres in 2013, but weren't available on DVD/Blu-ray until 2014. Thus, its considered here as 2014. 

It felt odd voting for it though, since I did actually watch it in 2013...guess I'll have to put up with it.

Out of curiosity, why is Mushishi in Slice of Life? While I recognize it's difficult to categorize and deals with some daily trivialities, doesn't putting it alongside Yuuki Yuuna and other, well, *slice of life-y* anime kind of ... diminish it? If anything I feel like it should be listed under Thriller, especially as dark as some episodes this series were.

I have a feeling I missed a poll thread along the line somewhere. >.>
But I guess it's so niche it probably wouldn't win any popularity contests anyway, so I'll just vote for it and move on.

Voted for Trinity Seven for Harem which is likely only me. >_> My reasoning is that it actually has romantic development, good girls, and can support itself as a Harem. [It's the only Harem series this year](/s " to develop an actual stable mutual Harem.")

I can understand Nisekoi love but I don't think it's a High Quality Harem series at all. It regularly uses from the big book of tropes, dense as fuck protagonist, and very little actual romantic progression. It's strong points though are the cute girls and the visuals... Which is about it in my opinion. I think it's a better comedy series than a romance series.

Comedy - Amagi brilliant park for being half funny and having characters named after rappers. 5/10 won't watch again but worth my time. 

Honorable mention goes to space dandy s2 which I didn't finish. 

Slice of life - Space Brothers for being a mature story about adults with actual dreams that I can be invested in and caring about its characters. Too slow at times though and pretty long. 7/10 won't watch again because too long but it was good. 

Silver spoon s2 because the show does a good job in portraying it's characters and making them go through struggles actual teenagers go through. Also it was very funny and charming. 8/10 will probably watch again some day. 

Harem - whatever monogatari stuff that aired this year because monogatari is best harem. Usually 6 or 7/10 because too much otaku pandering. 

Thriller - abstain because I haven't seen anything good. But it's probably between wixoss, rage of Bahamut and terror in resonance 

Romance - (edit) the wind rises is my choice because it was half decent. Forgot it's considered romance. 

Sports - PING PONG THE FUCKING ANIMATION MOTHERFUCKER 

SciFi - space Brothers for being the best series in the category. 

Action/ Battle Shonen - HxH - if this was 2013 and I had to pick between Jojos (2012) and hunter x hunter it would have been hard. But this year stardust crusaders was pretty weak compared to Jojos 2012 so HxH gets my vote. 

>> ARTICLE
> Comedy

Nothing 

Perhaps Gekkan Shoujo.  I didn't particularly find anything too funny this year, especially not the shows which were nominated.

>Slice of Life

Barakamon - I mean it's not really a unique idea but it was executed so well and so much charm it'd be foolish to vote otherwise

> Harem

Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai

> Thriller

Zankyou no Terror - I didn't particularly like ZnT but it had some good cliffhangers in the middle and did what a thriller should do.  I think the best thriller isn't even on this list lol.  Argevollen is nowhere to be found

> Romance

Soredemo Sekai no Utskushii - It was really well done, and the subtle changes in the OP reflect the level of endearment the crew had for their show.  It might have been a bit boring for some considering a lot of popular romances are drama's but I think this is the best we had.  

>Sports

Ping Pong the Animation - I think this show is way overrated and I was one of the people hyping this up.  But even then this show was one of the better ones of its season and probably the best sports anime, and put a little twist on the formulaic genre.

> Science Fiction

Sidonia no Kishi - This one just takes the cake.  You may have a bit to say with the CGI (which was handled pretty well) and stock footage reusage but goddamn this was one of the better scifi universes animated this year

Average year this sub started watching anime; **2009**. Let that sink in for a minute. If a show came out prior to Summer Wars, r/anime could very well be unaware it even exists.

Sorry to disappoint, I've just been watching for a long time :P As I grew up, early on I was watching things like Miyazaki movies, Sailor Moon, etc. Then anime started becoming more popular in the late 90's with shows like Pokmon, which started airing in '98 to put it in perspective. By the early 2000's Adult Swim was airing shows like Evangelion, Inuyasha, Case Closed, Lupin the Third, as well as the internet beginning to not suck as much, so anime became more mainstream and had increased access. So to me 2009 seems like a decade or so too late for most people to have gotten into anime xD

16 years old here and I don't even know what Summer Wars *is*.

I feel like I missed out by only beginning to watch anime recently. I'm very new, and it kind of sucks.
>> ARTICLE
I'd recommend watching it, as it was a pretty significant movie in the evolution of how anime looks, imo. Very visually pleasing and stylized in a way that not many anime were before, but several were after. The plot was interesting, if unoriginal, as it basically was a remake of the *Digimon Movie* just without actual digimon. But I guess that's ok, as it was the same director.

Im actually fucking surprised that Danmachi was more watched than Oregairu and UBW . 

The Oregairu and Fate/stay Night episode threads are always so active with many users (like 1000+ comments for UBW alone)  never expected Danmachi to be this popular . 


Also Prison School is so underrated not even in the top 10 for summer most popular and surprise hits .So far this is my AOTS of this summer.
>> ARTICLE
I found it easier to watch Danmachi week to week.
I felt like I was forgetting subtle things while waiting each week for the next episode of Oregairu. I'm picking it back up now that it's finished.
>> ARTICLE
really easy to watch danmachi because it's story is really not that special i go to /r/anime to see what i'm missing or discuss something great to that episode, but danmachi doesn't have much to discuss and danmachi has 10%+ dropped watchers so yeah that's why oregairu and ubw is much more pack in discussions.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of lurkers that's why, plus it a show that isn't a sequel unlike Oregairu and UBW. 
>> ARTICLE
true was just surprised even though I know it was one of the most popular along with UBW and Oregairu . 
>> ARTICLE
I also find it surprising that almost all of the top 10 are 50% watched. 
>> ARTICLE
I ran out of space, so I'll continue here:

I'd like to thank mostly /u/higi1024 but also /u/Jiecut for helping me out and giving me feedback, and /u/KousakaReina for translating this to Japanese.

One thing I want to address in a future survey is the *length of the survey*. This survey was/felt too long, it got only ~2500 responses, whereas previous seasonal surveys got ~3000 responses. The length could also be a reason for the little amount of responses from /r/japan_anime, so cutting down the amount of questions is something I definitely need to do.

Another thing is that I didn't include shorts. I'm definitely going to add shorts in the next survey. I didn't include them at first since there are a lot of them, of which many are *really* obscure. I thought they'd clutter up the answers. What I didn't think of is giving them their own sections/questions, so that's what I'm going to do.

I also only included anime that *started* and/or *ended* in the spring/summer season, since I didn't want to have the same anime in more than two surveys. If I include shows that have more than two cours, that'd mean also including a couple of the long running shows (One Piece, Naruto, Doraemon, etc.). I excluded these for the same reason I excluded shorts. I can add those shows, as long as I can make the survey look shorter/less intimidating.

The final thing is that all shows only had their *romanized Japanese* names, and not also their *English* names. Frankly, this survey was really something I decided to do last-minute, since no one else did it. Since I had to do both Japanese and English surveys, adding a third name for every show would've been more work than I wanted it to be, and I wanted to focus on setting up the survey. Since everything is now set up and since I don't have university stuff to do this summer, adding the English names won't be a problem.
>> ARTICLE
Having the questions spread out over many pages makes the survey feel longer. I don't know if this is possible with Google Forms, but maybe you could have a table of all the season's anime that combines many questions into one, e.g. a dropdown next to each with the choices "Completed/Dropped/Still Watching" and checkboxes for whether it had the best first episode, best last episode, best music, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it certainly felt long because of the multiple pages. Previous surveys usually only had one page. You also tried to fit in summer stuff also in the survey. While you got more data it also increased the length.

I haven't seen this implemented but what about a grid? That would make it look a lot shorter. I'm not exactly sure if you'll be able to output the data the same way in quick summary. I don't have experience with it. But a grid would make it a lot shorter.

Also no need to sweat getting only 2500 responses. Advenna had a summer survey with 2k responses and Hemoglobin had a big demographic one with only 2k also. 2500 is a respectable number for a survey.

Yeah you got good experience running a survey for future stuff.

How's your progress with the results?

I have some projects that I've been thinking of doing. The meta survey analysis. I also want to do some big query analysis for subreddit cliques (what other subreddits reddit /r/anime users use) and vice versa. I think I can also use the bigquery data for comment face popularity, that'd be cool.
>> ARTICLE
lol I thought this was from Free Talk Friday.
>> ARTICLE
Do you mean a grid like this?

 |Watching|Finished|Dropped|Picked up
-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
F/SN: UBW|x|||x
Danmachi||x
Denpa Kyoushi|||x|

That actually looks better than four lists of checkboxes, heh. higi1024 also came with the idea to split up the post-season (spring) and pre-season (summer) surveys, making it look like two shorter surveys, both of which are optional.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, please make a grid!

I never understood (and I'm sure I'm not the only one) what "Picked up" means.

* If you are "Watching" a show, you picked it up.
* If you have "Finished" a show, you picked it up.
* If you "Dropped" a show, you picked it up at least for one episode.

So what's the point behind "Picked up"?

My understanding of it is picking up a show after it's started airing, rather than from the first episode. It helps with certain metrics because then you're able to see how first impressions of viewers may have affected people's decisions to pick up a show they weren't considering before.

Hmmm... Let's see here... I'll go with "anime seldom mentioned except by myself", instead. Because if there's one thing I love to do, it's talk about the uncommon anime I love. I've even been accused of being an anime hipster for some reason...

* [Hourou Musuko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko) is the only one of my top-10 that doesn't get a lot of traffic on this subreddit. Some, yes. But that's mostly me and two or three other people that just can't stop talking about it. This is not an anime for everybody, but it should be.  
* [Bartender](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1589/Bartender) is a criminally underwatched title. Which is kinda understanding, given the relative age of this subreddit. But it's a great choice to put your feet up, crack a beverage open, and relax for a while.  
* [Kimikiss Pure Rouge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2927/Kimikiss_Pure_Rouge) is getting a bit more attention these days, but not enough for my taste. A seinen romance drama, this one has a Best Girl that can beat the crap out of most of the wannabe Best Girls out there.
* I think I'm the only person that puts [Yama no Susume](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume) forward. And I love my cute-girls-climbing-cute-mountains show. I find it just as relaxing as Aiura.  
* [Expelled From Paradise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13391/Rakuen_Tsuihou:_Expelled_from_Paradise) is a movie from Toei that doesn't get a lot of traffic these days, yet I enjoyed it almost as much as Summer Wars.  
* Everyone will mention Sakura Trick when talking about the Year of the Yuri celebration, but few people will dare broach the topic of [Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22123/Inugami-san_to_Nekoyama-san). I actually enjoyed this a lot more than Sakura Trick.
* [Yamato Nadeshiko Shichihenge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1562/Yamato_Nadeshiko_Shichihenge%E2%99%A5) is a shoujo faux-reverse harem by the same guy that brought us Excel Saga. That's right. Nabeshin did a shoujo. And it is awesomely weird.  
* [Kiniro no Corda: Primo Passo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1579/Kiniro_no_Corda:_Primo_Passo) is another shoujo reverse harem, and it is the capstone of my Music Appreciation Through Anime series.  
* [Blue Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2964/Blue_Drop:_Tenshi-tachi_no_Gikyoku) is one of more curious shoujo-ai titles around. It's like a lot more tame version of Utena crossed with Noir, and was rather unfairly panned on by most of the critics because of it.  
* [Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10079/Hoshizora_e_Kakaru_Hashi) is my favorite cheesy generic harem, and has one of the best confession scenes I've ever watched.
* Speaking of favorite cheesy generic harems, [Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13367/Kono_Naka_ni_Hitori_Imouto_ga_Iru!) very efficiently lampshades all of the little sister routes by making the MC specifically try to avoid the secret sister in the harem.  
* And finally, because I've been typing for half an hour and want to go get something to eat, [Mouse](http://myanimelist.net/anime/624/Mouse) is one of my guilty pleasure anime. It's awful, but it's the greatest *because* it is so awful.

You should do an ama, or we can do one now, like, weirdest anime ever you watched? Just curious.

Hmmm... I think an AMA should go in the Free Talk thread.

But weirdest anime? That's something a bit more nebulous. Weird as in my brain noping straight out of my skull and fleeing to Mexico in order to drown itself in tequila? Cosprayers. Weird as in not being able to easily comprehend what's happening? [Tenshi no Tamago.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/885/Tenshi_no_Tamago) Weird but still really liking it? Probably when I watched FLCL and Kyousogiga on the same day. Weird as in "Why the hell did they do this to a sequel"? Kite Liberator. 

I've seen a lot of weird anime, so I kinda need to keep it categorized.
>> ARTICLE
> I think an AMA should go in the Free Talk thread.

I guess, yeah. 

Categorizing them seems good. In-between seasons when I'm bored I watch some unpopular or terribly rated animes to rate it myself. Some were okay-ish, others are a taste thing I'd say, but most of the time I just facepalm and laugh. Last time it was Kenzen Robo Daimidaler. 

Anyway, I'll add them to my list, thanks for it.

Maybe even [Wonder Momo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22377/Wonder_Momo), if you want to see a bad anime that isn't very commonly watched.

Just please... Don't watch Cosprayers. For *years*, people have inserted the sentence "At least it wasn't as bad as Cosprayers!" into reviews of awful anime. It's truly that bad.

In other words, based on /r/anime_japan answers, **Hibike! Euphonium** was pretty popular in japan?

This gives more hope for season 2.

Of course euphonium was going to rank top for the best soundtrack! Its a music anime and the OST is very high-quality, even for anime standards.
>> ARTICLE
It's selling quite well.
>> ARTICLE
It's considered by some critics as the best anime ever produced by Kyoani.
The pretty realistic depiction of the human relations in the school club really hit home for a lot of viewers in japan I think.
>> ARTICLE
> It's considered by some critics as the best anime ever produced by Kyoani. 

Its not that i don't believe you, but have a source?

Just so i can use a link when someone says *"Hibike! Euphonium is just a moe show of cute girls doing cute things like K-on"*.
>> ARTICLE
If think it was on the second 'Hibike Euphonium' special episode of the [sokoani](http://sokoani.com/archives/9398.html) podcast that the hosts were the most praising.


There have been regular highlights in newtype/animage etc very positive about the anime, but as it's more commercial the tone is more flat and void. 

What has been intersting is that the soundtrack is currently #49 in the global amazon ranking, #5 in the soundtrack ranking, with the BD/DVD are also around #50 globally, #16 in the anime ranking.

Looking only at the numbers K-on was huge as well, but in the reviews you hear a lot of adults watching with their kids, musicians, and overall pretty mature people. Having these numbers on such a wide base is pretty unprecedented for Kyoani I think.

Well I think I know what the true sleeper hit is going to be this season (Seriously, Overlord and Gangsta are sleepers?)...or at least I hope...At least it's nice to see Akagami top that list, deserves the attention. But summer overall is pretty promising and can't wait to keep watching!
>> ARTICLE
I didn't select it at the time, but I probably would now. The more Sore ga Seiyuu I watch, the more I like it.
>> ARTICLE
Dunno about everyone else but I simply took a chance on Overlord knowing nothing about it except that it has what looked like a best girl on it's front cover. Long story short, I absolutely adore the series. Like, I've never felt this way about any series ever. And I've seen Steins;Gate, FMA:B, etc.

I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not a sleeper hit by any means...just look how many comments/upvotes the last thread got.

Knights of Sidonia guys, get on it. It's a great show and the second season was just as good as the first or even better. A really well done sci-fi 3D anime that could not have been done in any other way in my opinion after seeing the production values.

Using the 3D to display the 3D space and mechs along with the sound effects have never made it more satisfying for its intense space battles.

Glad Yuki-Chan wasn't in Most Disappointing. 

Didn't see too many surprises but /r/japan_anime has gr8 taste m8. I think the most eye opening thing was how much longer /r/japan_anime has been watching and how much more they watch. 

I guess we're all just filthy casuals.

We're not *all* filthy casuals... we just average out as such.

Well, everyone else may be but my taste is superb
>> ARTICLE
Okay onto the results.

Age distribution chart looks really cool. While /r/anime looks really young the average age is actually 20 and median age is around 19.5. Yeah that's still young but the majority aren't in high school, not that there's anything wrong with HS.

Interesting to note that not everyone lives in North America.

Dungeon in the lead with 75% is quite significant. That's a big lead and really significant chunk of people. I think the hype worked. For comparison 65% to 70% watched SAO II.

Slightly sad that Arslan isn't that popular but 33% is decent. Another interesting thing to note is that most of the top 10 are above 50% watched.

But while a lot of people watched Dungeon, only 33% of them rated it in their top 5.

I was going to say something about the vocal crowd of prison school but it's not actually on the list. % on summer shows are a bit lower but we'll see if people picked up more shows for week 3. Still the Top 5 plan to watch are solid. (we'll see if people are going to be disappointed by God Eater)

Combining age and year started watching anime would be interesting.

For shows watched per season, this can be quite a difficult question. It's interesting how you can see people like to guestimate at round numbers.

50-200 full length shows is cool. 

For some of these questions median might be a more suitable stat.

I say the background art is fantastic (not a big fan of their  character designs). Im a big jojo fan and there is no way its more visually impressive than UBW.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure you could mount an argument that JoJo's is far more visually interesting than UBW: the aggressively stylised designs, the unusual colour choices, the use of text, the 3DCG OPs, the inventive EDs. Ufotable's work on UBW, meanwhile, is often about sweeping artistic flair under the rug in the interests of consistency and a polished sheen.  The storyboarding in UBW is often kind of dull too -- unlike JoJo's, or indeed Kekkai Sensen and Euphonium. In that sense, UBW's sometimes closer to the more anodyne kind of US animation.

I don't know whether I'd say JoJo's was the third most visually impressive title of the season either, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm going crazy I swear it was on the top 3 last time I looked at it but now it's JoJo .

Oh fucking damnit, I accidentally switched it with Kekkai Sensen >.>

>> ARTICLE
I don't know how or why this trend of being obsessed with female characters started (okay, I guess I can have a small idea given the main demographic of this subreddit and the anime community in general), but to be honest I find the VAST majority of the best anime characters to be males, so it's a bit sad when they are overshadowed due to shallowness.
>> ARTICLE
Part of it might be because a good amount of male MCs are boring, generic self-inserts or the occasional whiny Shinji-type. Of course they're not all like that, but I'm sure this also contributes in some way.
>> ARTICLE
Most popular shows have many more female characters than male (SAO, Akame Ga Kill, Steins; Gate, and the entire 'harem' genre come to mind) so theres  significantly more competition in the female character bracket.

Edit: After I posted this I started thinking of all the immensely popular shows with predominantly male casts, so allow me to modify my statement: Most shows which are popular *on this sub* have more female characters than male.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is that it's usually the females that are the "gimmick" or more unique in those series. There are simply more fun female archetypes that they are willing to play around with compared to male archetypes.

Wild Card test

Gilgamesh? Isn't he from Fate/Zero or something?

He's also in Fate Stay Night but only very very briefly.

He's one of the main antagonist in 2 out of the three routes, including the one that's getting adapted now, (UBW), so he's a pretty major character.

I think he meant he's in the first part of UBW that aired in 2014.

Gilgamesh only had brief appearance in UBW and I don't even remember whether Kiritsugu actually made an appearance or not.

The strongest type of feels.
>> ARTICLE
Kakashi vs Obito was the best fight imo. The animation, action and the music all worked perfectly together. Also the flashback included that shows it as a parallel to when they were kids gives emotion (The OST fitted in with the flashback)
>> ARTICLE
Do you even UBW bro ?
>> ARTICLE
animation shenanigans aren't everything. 

UBW has the disadvantage that the context is much weaker. It's mostly a death game where the participants barely know each other. The soundtrack is sadly generic as fuck (I really expected more after Fate/Zeros amazing OST)

And the choreographies up until know were pretty generic, too in my opinion.

Not that they are bad. But these aspects make them weaker than the fight IIILewis97III mentioned

>> ARTICLE
And no over the top "I predicted your move! No I predicted your move! No I predicted, that you would predict my move! No I pre......."

Just a little bit of that in the end but it's not so typical "let's explain what we've predicted"

It focusses on the hand to hand combat and not on the "Who has the higher power level by comparing the energy waves/balls/beams whatever"

And it doesn't rely on a "I haven't revealed my secret power yet" bullshit twist.

There is so much BS in Naruto. But this fight was amazing
>> ARTICLE
Nobody said HxH 131? I know it wasn't close to being fair, but it was pretty epic

HxH 131 is definitely on there. I spoiler tagged the names.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I meant, I'm surprised nobody has commented on how good it was, considering most other threads that reference HxH 131 always have people fawning over it 
>> ARTICLE
Well i mean it was a total stomp, while it was satisfying, i didnt like the fight overall. Im getting into dangerous teritory criticizing HxH here so ill just say that [](/s "instant powerups shouldnt be a thing in HxH, a show that puts a lot of time into training.") That personally was annoying.
>> ARTICLE
It had direct, severe consequences though [](/s "which was immediately fixed by a rather Deus Ex Machina-type power")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah that bothers me *much* more than the actualy fight, but [](/s "the instant powerup because of his emotional state still left a bad taste in my mouth. I mean Gon is neither a specialist or a genius, and up until then he had to train for any kind of strength development, but he was able to channel all of his potential nen/strength/life force, including shit he hadnt even gotten close to developing yet which means he basically plucked his power out of the future, into a single power up for like zero reason besides being extremely upset. To me, that sounds like something that belongs in dbz not HxH. And if shit like that becomes common place,including other dues ex machina shit like nanikas power, i wont like the future of HxH.")
>> ARTICLE
Luckily(?) HxH has for future.  I would be shocked if a show as long as HxH didn't have some things that rubbed me the wrong way, but I still consider it a ten and that won't change anytime soon.
>> ARTICLE
But if you consider what Gon was paying for that power-up, that's insane. You could argue that there is a way to turn life energy into actual nen power or something similiar. I wonder if the manga is going to have an explanation somewhere though.

But in the end, it served a whole different purpose than the fight itself, so I didn't have any problems even without an explanation. It's a world where something like this could  potentially happen, and it served for the greater purpose of the arc which are, to me, the more important points, which make me overlook the smaller scale in which it might be harmful to a part of the audience.

If we have to take in consideration: the originality, the music, the animation and of course the tension, then it's all about HxH 125-126. Everything else is far from the fist place.

No KLK or am I missing something?

Nah I agree with you. Klk fights were so ducking awesome, especially that episode 3 fight

this would probably only include the battles from the second half of the show, and there were A LOT

 I mean A LOT

Man, if Illya doens't win I'm going to be so sad.

Also speaking of Illya [Spoilers](/s "when the fuck is she going to install Berserker. I was so sad when the card she installed against Bazett wasn't Berserker. I mean, come on, they're like fucking besties. He deserves to be installed by his master.")

I guess NGNL could win too, just for sheer entertainment/asspull factor, and for the effort the TLs had to go through to make that work in English. I mean holy hell that must've been a bitch.

WTF is that you, me? 

But yeah I'd agree, illya fights are fucking amazing.

Winter - Silver Spoon S2 (honorable mentions to Nagi no Asukara, D-frag and Seitokai Yakuindomo S2)

Mine stacked up like

Kill la Kill  
Isshuukan Friends  
Barakamon/Nozaki-kun/Terror (in that order)  
Parasyte (with an honorable mention for Danna ga Nani)
>> ARTICLE
The biggest tragedy of this event will be if Ping Pong loses Spring Anime of the Season to fucking No Game No Life.

It is a popularity contest, not gonna be very surprising that the more popular anime wins. And, personally, i like/liked ngnl more than Ping Pong. And seeing as Ngnl is currently winning, it is safe to say that many others agree.

***Wild Card***

If something was wrongfully shunned and *not* submitted, add it as a reply to the second level comments below, each saying a season! The comment I have responded to this with will be the judge. If your nominee for the wild card is in the top ***5*** replied below ***AND*** above my comment in points, then it's in. 

This one is a little different, make sure that your anime ***ended*** in the season you're submitting it in. For example, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders started in Spring but it's only valid for Summer, because that's when it ended. Similarly, anything that's still currently airing but aired last year as well belongs in the *Fall* category. An example of this above is Naruto: Shippuuden.

Winter - 1. Hajime No Ippo:Rising, 2.Magi The Kingdom of Magic 

Spring - 1. Ping Pong, 2.Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou

Summer - 1. Haikyuu, 2. Tokyo Ghoul (side note: I recommend not watching the new season "A:" and instead reading the manga)

Fall - ( Best three of the year IMO)1. Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade , 2. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, 3. Parasyte
>> ARTICLE
Just a note on your comment on Tokyo Ghoul, the root a anime is also written by the author of the manga, isn't it? I mean, I still heard the manga is much much better, but I also heard they're totally different stories. 
>> ARTICLE
They are indeed different stories, The anime is going to have an original ending. From what I have seen the show is lazily done with no desire for the same flow the first season had. Its choppy and lacks any real story that I can see, just my opinion however.

>Best Female Characters

Girl is synonym for female.

Best Girl Character

Best Girl

Same shit really.

>This is for the most developed/best written/best design/best overall girl character

Also that is completely subjective. Technically I would still be right. I love the word "best" because it easily allows for manipulation of the definition as there is no unbiased structure to determine what equals the "best". For example I could argue that the best written characters are the ones that make me want to sleep with them the most. The best you can do to counter that is state that you disagree, but either way we are both correct and both wrong as our criteria for "best" is different. 

Advantages of doing Extension English back in high school is that it teaches you to argue things like this as its one of the courses where there is no set right, just varying degrees of it. [No hard feelings.](http://i.imgur.com/fbmAXSd.jpg)

Finals - Personal opinions

**Best OP** - I'm pretty undecided on this one, actually. There are four main ones that I really like. Here they are:

>**Ambiguous** - *Gamidelia* from Kill la Kill - The song in this is great. I really like the flashing of the different costumes the characters all wear in the beginning too. Towards the end of the OP, it gives me a feeling that something epic is going to happen, which fits really well with Kill la Kill. Also, boobies.

>**Database** - *Man With a Mission* from Log Horizon - This one seems to be a fan favorite, not surprised that it's in the finals. The song is fun, the visuals in each of the openings with this song are great (especially the first one) and I feel like it sets a unique tone for the show. 

>**Hikaru Nara (If You Will Shine)** - *Goose House* from Shigatsu wa Kimi no Osu (Your lie in April) - I really like the song and the visuals in this are great as well. The only reason I'm wary on this is that I haven't watched any of the show yet, so I don't know if it fits the show well or not. Either way, it's great and I might vote for this regardless. 

>**Trigger** - *Yuuki Ozaki* from Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance) - While I didn't like the show as much as most because of Five, the OP is great. The song is great, the visuals are great and there's just not much more to say about it. The lyrics kind of make me feel like it was written for the show, since they seem like they're extremely relevant. 

>Honorable mention - **Tada Hitori** - *Bakudan Johnny* from Ping Pong the Animation - I can't believe this didn't make the finals. One of the best from this year for sure. OOOHHHHH YEAH!

**Best ED** - This might actually be one of the easiest decisions in the entire event for me.

>**Innocence** - *NoisyCell* from Barakamon - The song is just amazing, and the kind of hazy/foggy visuals mixed with the watercolor animation just looks amazing. I don't know how to describe my feelings about it. /u/DrJamesFox showed me a short write up he did about it, but I can't find it right now. I remember one of the words he used to describe it was 'nostalgic' and I can't say I disagree. Even just watching the ED makes me tear up sometimes. Such a good ED. 

>Honorable mention - **Walk Like An Egyptian** - *The Bangles* from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders - The bizarre song choice and extremely colorful style in the ED really work well together, making it a combo that rivals Roundabout, but falls short by just a little. Either way, this was unexpected, but surprisingly still great. 

**Best ____ anime of the year** - I'm going to just name my anime next to the genre below.

>Comedy - **Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** - The premise is interesting, and the execution is just perfect. Has some of the best comedy I've ever seen in an anime, and the scene where they play the visual novels is probably my *favorite comedy scene* in **any** anime I've seen.

>Slice of Life - **Barakamon** - The premise, again, is interesting. I really liked the whole show, how Handa grew up when he moved to the island, and how it made him see what was important. Every character is unique and each one has great characterization, really combining to make something special.

>Harem - **Nisekoi** - So many best girls, so little time. If absolutely nothing else, the best girl wars make this the best. So many arguments between Chitoge, Onodera, true best girl Tsugumi and the other girl who no one cares about because she came into the anime too late. 

>Thriller - **Tokyo Ghoul** - Awesome premise, and the execution is good enough that I enjoyed the story. Unique to see someone cope with what Kaneki had to cope with, and seeing him [](/s "getting used to eating human flesh") was awesome. Also had one of the best last episodes last year. 

>Romance - Abstaining - I've only seen two shows from here, so it would be next to no contest.

>Sports - Abstaining - Only seen Ping Pong.

>Sci-fi - **Psycho-Pass 2** - Even if it didn't bring much new stuff since Psycho-Pass pretty much established the system, the new things they brought in were super interesting and cool.

>Action/Battle Shounen - **Kill la Kill** - Well, who doesn't love a great anime with great battle sequences? Not me! This show was great and the action scenes are just fun, even if they are a tad repetitive.

**Best Male character** - **Jurai Andou** from Inou-Battle - Shout out to /r/gayforandou. But seriously, as much as I wasn't a huge fan of the show, Andou carried it on his back, which is saying a lot for an MC, let alone one of a harem anime. You can really tell that Andou really cared about all of his friends in the show. Also, he's a total chuuni which is cool too.

>> ARTICLE
> so I don't know if it fits the show well or not. Either way, it's great and I might vote for this regardless.

I can assure you the OP captures the show perfectly. You really need to watch this one soon...but I guess you have a pretty long list of shows you really need to watch soon eh? :P

>showed me a short write up he did about it, but I can't find it right now. I remember one of the words he used to describe it was 'nostalgic' and I can't say I disagree.

I could link to it but it's unnecessary. Basically the lyrics of the song are recalling a very important time in the singer's life. A time that made him both incredibly happy and changed him. For Handa, that time was living on the Island and realizing what is important in life through his interactions with Naru and the other Islanders. The ED reflects the emotions in the song and the anime with it's watercolor art-style. It feels nostalgic because the art-style gives the ED a feeling of it being a memory. You know how when you think about any memory and details are kind of blurred? Same with the ED. The watercolor artstyle blurs the details of these fond memories. 

Oh and sorry if I've given you the impression that I've been ignoring you. I haven't been doing that intentionally. Stuff has been real tough at work and I'm working long hours to make up for people who have been laid off. I've been drinking a lot and immersing myself in manga when I'm not working to escape from these difficult times. Because of that I haven't really been in the right frame of mind to help you with your threads. I'm not looking for any words of encouragement, just letting you know why I didn't respond to some of your messages. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, no dude don't worry about it. Let me know if you want/need to talk about anything. /u/ugotmal is always here for you, s-senpai.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for that, but I try to use the internet as an escape from IRL problems. My having gotten fairly close to you and a couple of other redditors on here has caused the lines to blur a little though. I just let you know those bits of information because I didn't want you to get the wrong impression from my lack of responses. 

Oh and I think you asked about House of Cards, right? Shit is next level television, but you've got to pay careful attention to it or it'll go over your head. I consider my knowledge of US politics and government to be well above average but there were still several plot points that were difficult for me to follow. Amazing show though. 

And I saw you mention Tokyo Ghoul in your previous post as one of your favorites from last year. You should definitely consider picking up the manga if you haven't already. The anime is headed towards an anime original ending which I can't imagine will top the manga's beautifully epic ending. I started from Ch. 70, which is where I read the anime began to branch off from the manga. 

The new sequel manga, Tokyo Ghoul:re, takes place 3 years after the ending of Tokyo Ghoul and is looking *very* interesting through 15 chapters. 

Also, you calling me senpai gave me a good chuckle...thanks for that. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay, well if you ever change your mind, I'm all ears. I know what it's like to have a stressful day. 

I did ask about House of Cards. I don't really know much about politics, should I just pass on the series then? 

I don't know if I'd consider Tokyo Ghoul to be one of my favorites from last year, but I enjoyed it. I'm gonna get into the manga eventually. I actually bought the guest volume and then when it came in the mail it was in Japanese... I was pretty upset. And btw, when you say that RE is very interesting, do you think it could be better than the first part of the manga? That would be great. 

And I'm just glad that senpai finally noticed me! Lol. 
>> ARTICLE
>I did ask about House of Cards. I don't really know much about politics, should I just pass on the series then?

I think you should probably watch a couple of episodes to see how it feels to you. The second season is much more politically complex than the first though. It felt too high level for me at times, and like I said, I feel like my understanding of politics/US Govt is better that average. 

>when you say that RE is very interesting, do you think it could be better than the first part of the manga?

I began reading the manga at Ch. 70, which is where I was told the anime began to diverge. So I can't answer that question. I'd say RE is interesting because of the timeskip and the effects it has had on the characters. If you like Tokyo Ghoul because of the characters, RE is *extremely* interesting. If you like Tokyo Ghoul because of the world building and action, then RE is just okay. 

>And I'm just glad that senpai finally noticed me! Lol.

I might check a few episodes of HoC out. But even if I like it, 2d 4 lyfe.

May I recommend you either vote or watch and vote for our lord and saviour [Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time) for the romance genre?

Agreed, I do believe Haikyuu!! to be better than Ping Pong though.

My OP and ED choices would've been slightly different if it wasn't including animation and art but now that it is.

**Best OP - This Game by Konomi Suzuki**

**Best ED - Tokohana by Yanagi Nagi**

**Best Comedy: Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** (I can imagine it's between this and Barakamon for the win).

**Best Slice of Life: Barakamon**

**Best Harem: Nisekoi** (Was considering Monogatari but honestly I found Nisekoi to be superior to Hanamonogatari and Tsukimonogatari and it'd be unfair judging on the past seasons).

**Best Thriller: Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** (Zankyou no Terror close second though).

**Best Romance: Golden Time** (Most realistic romance anime I've seen, can't help but loving it).

**Best Sports: Kuroko no Basket 2nd Season** (I find Ping Pong to be the most overrated series of 2014 on this subreddit honestly, Haikyuu!! is probably the most worthy winner though, I'm just a Kuroko fan.)

**Best Sci-fi: Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei** (I'd place this 4th amongst the series in terms of how much I liked them but it's undeniably the best out of the 5 when it comes to Sci-fi attributes IMO.)

**Best Action: Hunter x Hunter (2011)** (Honestly I don't see anything that can come close to touching Hunter x Hunter for rank 1 here, possibly Bahamut).

**Best Male Character: Izumi Shinichi** (Real hard decisiong between Izumi and Archer, I swear to shit though that if Inaho wins I'll flip a table or something.)

A question though, scrolling downwards it seems to me like people voted with their favourite of the shows in mind, am I the only one who voted for whichever series I found pulled off the category in question the best? (aside from the sports category).

Best OP: Unravel (Tokyo Ghoul)

Best ED: Shirushi (SAO II)

Comedy: Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun)

Harem: Nisekoi

Thriller: Haven't seem most of them so I can't really judge.

Romance: Shigatsu wa kimi no Uso

Sports: Kuroko no basket 2

Action/Battle: Fate/SN UBW

>> ARTICLE
I'm a little bit shocked that Barakamon's OP didn't make it to the finals, but ED did. OP is sooo wonderful, still listening to it a lot.

**Best OP:** - Hikaru Nara by Goose House then.

**Best ED:** - Innocence by NoisyCell

**Best Comedy:** Barakamon, I laughed like crazy while watching it.

**Best Slice of Life:** Barakamon, no comments, my love 2014 :)

**Best Harem:** Monogatari, Araragi has it right!

**Best Thriller:** Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu.

**Best Romance:** Golden Time - it's the best romance out of that choices.

**Best Sports:** I really hope Haikyuu!! wins, it was truly awesome. I told about it to my non-anime watcher friend, and he marathoned it and then even rewatched. It's just great.

**Best Sci-fi:** Aldnoah.Zero - the most sci-fi out of these ones.

**Best Action:** Akame ga Kill - really loved battle scenes here (and haven't watch HxH yed :D)

**Best Male Character:** Kanye FTW!

Romance: NAGI NO ASUKARA<3  
Sport: Kuroko no Basket Season 2

>> ARTICLE
Best OP - Shiver by Lucy Rose from Mushishi Zoku Shou - this fucking song man, so fucking great. Probably my all time favorite OP. 

Best ED - Walk Like and Egyptian - The Bangles - Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders - if you haven't guessed I like it when a show has some English songs as the OP or ED. 

Best Comedy Anime - Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun - It was between this and Amagi Brilliant Park, and both were funny, but nozaki Kun was much more clever and didn't give us an asspull ending, so it gets my vote. Also, dat catchy ass OP. 

Best SoL - Barakamon - I didn't see all of them, but all I hear is good things from Barakamon, so I'll pick that. 

Best Harem Anime - Monogatari Series - the answer is always Monogatari. It's the best harem, period. That isn't saying much and I don't particularly like the series, but il give it credit where it deserves it. 

Best Thriler Anime - Parasyte the Maxim - Parasyte is a damn good show, and the rest of these shows are meh to okay. 

Best Romance Anime - abstain - of the few romance anime I tried, I hated them all. And I didn't see the rest yet so I can't give judge. They all look like shit anyway. 

Best Sports anime - Ping Pong the Animation - again, the only right answer. Best sports anime ever, and much better than the rest of the shit we got this year. 

Best sci fi - Parasyte the Maxim - again, it's a great show, while the rest are either bad or average. 

Best action/battle shonen - Hunter x Hunter - I thought Kill la Kill would be my choice, but Hunter x Hunter just barely edged it out. Both are great series, and if I could pick both I would, but if there can only be one, that one needs to be HxH. Chimera ants FTW. 


>> ARTICLE
Best Op: It was hard choosing just one case their are so many good choices. But I had to pick Tokyo Ghoul because I listen to that song constantly when I first heard. 

Best ED: This was a toughy a pick from either Log Horizon or Barakamon. But I had to go with Barakamon. This ending made me tear up everytime I stayed after the show to listen to this beautiful song. Don't know what it was but for a song to do that is pretty great.

Best Comedy: Barakamon again cause I don't think I have laughed so hard in my life after watching that show.

Best SoL: Barakamon again lol

Best Harem: Nisekoi

Best Thiller: Tokyo Ghoul

Best Romance: Golden Time

Best Sport: haven't watched any of them so I picked Haikyuu!! since that looked the most appealing to me.

Best Sci-fi: The Irregular at Magic High School

Best Action: Kill la Kill 

Best Male Character: Jurai Andou

>> ARTICLE
Personally I love Unravel, best song of the year IMO, but due to the fact that I absolutely adore the art and animation in the NGNL OP and that I like the song a lot as well I had to pick that, I'll save Unravel for when it's judged purely on the music :3.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no I understand I Love NGNL op too but i like [this version better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRQbVNzmCK0)
>> ARTICLE
Best OP - Shiver (Mushishi Zoku Shou) I haven't even watched Mushishi but I love this song and I now am a fan of Lucy Rose.

Best ED - It's the right time (Kiseijuu) This song is always a good come down from all of the intensity of the show.

Best Comedy - Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, this was actually a huge surprise for me, I expected it to be nothing special and it was so much fun with a great cast and some of the funniest scenes I've seen.

Best Slice of Life - Barakmon, truthfully I never finished it but it was always a nice relaxing show to break up all of the action shows that season.

Best Harem - Monogatari Series, I love this series, not really much to say.

Best Thriller - Kiseijuu, the first half was really fantastic with some of the most tense moments from last year.

Best Romance - Nagi No Asukara, I just wish best girl won :(

Best Sports - Ping Pong, this is my pick for the best show of last year, everything about it is fantastic.

Best Sci-Fi - Kiseijuu

Best Action/Battle Shounen - Hunter x Hunter (2011), I haven't quite finished it yet but its been a real ride, I didn't expect to like it at all but it has some really great characters and moments.

Best Male Character - Kong Wenge (Ping Pong) since my first choice of the Ping Pong boys (Peco) didn't make it, I have to go with Kong.  His development from being an arrogant asshole looking down on others to a real team player/team captain was really quite something.

(Best OP nobody saw:[AMAZING BREAK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxgBRVt9dHU))
>> ARTICLE
Best OP: **Kimi ja Nakya Dame Mitai** (GSNK) There were a ton of good OPs this year but this one is just bursting with energy and creativity. It really portrays the mood and atmosphere of the show well.

Best ED: **Dareka Umiwo** (Zankyou no Terror) I think the quality of this song is a major part of why I was so disappointed with ZnT. It's haunting, the visual metaphors are really well done, and Aimer's vocals are god-tier.

Best Comedy: **Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun** As /r/anime is sick to death of hearing, this show was just fantastic. The fact that a completely irrelevant character from a single scene is on the best guy list speaks volumes for how memorable this show is. Even mention Tomoda and someone, somewhere, will respond with TOMODAAAAA!! guaranteed. He doesn't even have more than one drawing.

Best Slice of Life: **Barakamon** This show is just so touching and happy I flit back and forth between smiles and tears, sometimes both.

Best Harem: **Nisekoi** Shaft really did an amazing adaptation with this. Complain all you want about plot progression, this anime *satisfies* visually and comedically. The VAs are all amazing and fit their characters perfectly. Monogatari is definitely going to win, but whenever Nisekoi comes up, it always devolves into a best-girl argument. *That* is what a harem comedy is all about.

Best Thriller: **Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** This show took a little while to get going, but when it did, holy shit. You really feel the repercussions of the debatable actions Shinichi takes. The last episode, my jaw was dropped basically the whole time. It's suspenseful, violent, and tense.

I don't really have input on sports anime, but Ping Pong will definitely win.

Best Sci-Fi: *Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu** again.

Best Action: **Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis** This was just unlike anything I've seen. It just oozes cool. When the MC uses a shortsword and *revolver-crossbow* you know you're in for a treat. Every character was great, I especially liked how Kaisar was handled.

Best Male Character: **TOMODAAAAA**

Aaah yes.

The Road to El Dorado: The Animation: The Episode.

They knocked it out of the park with the cgi in that episode too. (Used up most of thier CG budget though, but it was awesome.)

First Episode - Unlimited Blade Works

Final Episode - Space Dandy and Ping Pong
>> ARTICLE
First Episode - Zankyou No Terror : I was pretty sure we could be looking at a classic in the making from the first episode and it still turned out pretty good but not quite as fantastic as it started.

Last Episode - Ping Pong the Animation: An incredibly solid ending to a truly fantastic series, maybe not quite as satisfying as The Tatami Galaxy but it was still pretty satisfying.

The first ZnT episode was awesome. If you have the time and haven't already, check out this [Digibro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GBUmCqd1Jk). He perfectly explains why I love the first few episodes of ZnT.

Edit: TL;DR no exposition through dialogue (show, don't tell), transitions, realism (detail), "camera position", all in all awesome directing.

Last episode - Hunter x Hunter (2011)

Seriously, that was some beautiful stuff. That episode, and a few that preceded it, definitely seemed to have used some leftover budget. It was the perfect ending to a series we all knew wouldn't really be "Completed". Though it felt more like an ending to the first season (albeit, a long one) of a series, it was still the perfect finale for one of anime's recent masterpieces.

Honestly, love it or hate it, i cant see any anime beating it for amazing and suprising endings. Yes season 2 happened but you cant lie that season 1fucking took everyone by suprise and anime communities blew up for weeks afterwords. It was a fucking memorable episode
>> ARTICLE
Memorable doesn't mean good though. It was over-the-top drama for the sake of over-the-top drama. It was just [Spoiler](/s "killing off characters for the sake of killing off characters. Any show could have done that. The show was bad before that episode, and it was bad after that episode. The fact that they couldn't follow through with killing off the characters in the second season just showed that the episode was bad. You can't just say "just because season 2 didn't follow up, that doesn't mean the episode was bad" because it does. The only reason that episode was interesting was because it made viewers think "where do we go from here?" Because the answer to that question was unsatisfactory, that makes the episode itself bad as well. The reason other shows don't have episodes like that is because they have integrity and don't simply pull stuff out of their asses to generate fake hype for future seasons.")
>> ARTICLE
I think it is highly probable. I don't think they will be like E.T. Or War of the Worlds.
>> ARTICLE
I gotta give it to Space Dandy. I think both its first and last episode are strong contenders but no other show has tied up that many loose ends in such a satisfying way in one single final episodes, and it did so without sacrificing what makes Space Dandy so damn Dandy in the first place.

First episode - UBW Prologue


Last episode - Ping Pong

Ping Pong's ending was just too good. Normally, with a show as great as Ping Pong, I would be wanting more after the ending, but with Ping Pong, the ending just made me so satisfied with everything that I didn't even want more afterwards.

Kiseijuu for first episode
>> ARTICLE
I loved the Prologue of F/SN UBW, It was great to see the lancer fight animated and it got me excited for the rest of the series (the first half of UBW got me so hyped about Fate I ended up playing most of the VN (Ive got to start HF sometime)

I also literally adored space dandy the whole time while watching and enjoyed the whole thing very much, But the first episode (of season 1) and the last episode (of season 2) stand out to me as my favorites, The opening sequence where the narrator explained the story while being interrupted by the cast and QT's breaking of the 4th wall are still one of my favorite comedy moments in all of anime. The space dandy ending was beautiful and so fitting for a series like that. Ive heard there is more space dandy in the works (which I am welcome to) but I just don't hope they screw up the ending. 
>> ARTICLE
Last Episode - Space Dandy

It was hands down the most beautiful, and most colorful episode I have ever seen, the music, the action just everything was perfect and spot on. Also they wrapped up the series perfectly and in a way that no one even expected. Definitely has my vote.
>> ARTICLE
First episode - Akame ga Kill

Last episode - Tokyo Ghoul 


>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Ghoul's first episode was very predictable in my opinion, but that didn't stop me from enjoying a hell lot out of it. Great art and an enjoyable episode overall.
>> ARTICLE
My god, watch his transformation in the first episode was just amazing. Probably my favorite first episode in any anime, ever.
>> ARTICLE
First episode - Aldnoah.Zero and Tokyo Ghoul(it has got to be those songs, man)

Last episode - Kill la Kill and Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis
>> ARTICLE
Aldnoah Zero's 1st episode was a lot of plot building, but the final few minutes with Sawano's soundtrack and the last frame with the shooting star "wish" really helped build up the hype for more episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
/r/SawanoDrop is a thing for a reason.
>> ARTICLE
I think zankyou no terror gets the best first episode

* best last episode goes to noragami. [Season finale spoilers](/s "there's the God of calamity yato" )   (regards to tokyo ghoul though)

Then again, I have only seen about half of the anime nominated :/
>> ARTICLE
I considered giving a vote to Tokyo Ghoul for the finale section but I sort of think that the first episode of the second season should have been the finale of the first.
>> ARTICLE
Thinking about it, that would've been pretty nice. I disliked how they ended the season right in the middle of the other scene because it takes away the tension. 
>> ARTICLE
Also had a huge disconnect from the action when watching the first episode of s2, since we were thrown straight back into it all.
>> ARTICLE
Oh! Akame ga kill had a crazy good first episode. Total 180, sold me on the show right away.

Same deal with Tokyo Ghoul, despite the damn censoring 
>> ARTICLE
AgK had a superb first episode.. sadly I would never vote for the last episode. Anyone who does it should be ashamed!
>> ARTICLE
Judging a show based only on the first and last episode? This the poll Tokyo Ghoul was *made* for.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, Tokyo Ghoul was one of my favorite last episodes of any anime I have ever watched. I know a lot of people may have not liked it because it left off on a cliffhanger, but I can't remember the last time I was so captivated and so satisfied. 
>> ARTICLE
First - **Nozaki-kun** - this was the first thing I saw from Nozaki-kun (which was the first show I had watched in recent years that was still airing) and it was all it took to hook me in.

Last - **selector infected WIXOSS** - Say what you will about the cliffhanger ending, and the subsequent events of Spread. I fell in love with WIXOSS and the final battle between Ruko and Iona was as epic as I could have hoped for.

>> ARTICLE
Ryuuichi "Dragon" Kazama from Ping Pong the animation.
    
Explanation:
    
[Spoiler](/s "While there are no clear villains or antagonist in Ping Pong, Dragon is still clearly presented as the guy to beat in the anime. His match against Kong demonstrates how much of a monster he is a this game and the music that goes with it just makes it better (Seriously go listen to Dragon theme on Youtube and try to say that it doesn't feel like a big boss fight). This becomes even more evident with the match against Peco where Dragon is the last obstacle that seperates Peco's from his goal of reaching the final.")
>> ARTICLE
Was Sousuke an antagonist? He started that way, but then was kind of absorbed into the Samezuka fun times. I'll still vote for him, boy deserved better than Free! spoilers [an injured shoulder and hazy future] (/spoiler)

Dr. Gel is the most unique take on a "villain" I've ever seen!
>> ARTICLE
I feel that Aki-lucky and DIO! Are the only ones there deserving of anything close to best villain. 2014 just didn't have a lot of mentionable villains. And let's leave the average quality of 2014 out of it. That was overall horrid
>> ARTICLE
Aki-Rucky/Aki-Roveri should win it for sure in my opinion. Unfortunately, not that many people have actually seen WIXOSS so she might not end up with enough votes, regardless of merit.
>> ARTICLE
But... Hunter x Hunter... Meruem...  He is the BEST villian ever imo. He isn't evil, heck he isn't even a villain really, just a confused bug trying to carry out his instictual mission. His death was so sad and touching I cried. Can't say that for ANY other villain to be honest!

Simple. She was made pure and only to be a villain. Her back story didn't entail much, and the only thing she had going for her were the spare moments she had with tatsumi and her team.

Sometimes purity is worth voting for.

> Akame ga Kill!

Excuse me while I go to the hospital since I laughed my lung out.
>> ARTICLE
Technically Akame ga Kill was such a good adaptation that the manga was the adaptation of the anime.
>> ARTICLE
I am at the latest AgK chapter and I have seen the tv-show. I have to say that it was a poor adaptation. The atmosphere was brilliant but other wise the lack of character depth and a few other things dragged it down.

But if you liked it, then by all means. For me personally I find the manga more compelling.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say that it was a poor adaptation. I too have read up to the latest chapter and I have to say that the anime was almost identical up to the manga up to the point where the anime diverged and went anime only. The only noticeable differences was just Kurome's backstory. 
>> ARTICLE
Well to be fair, AgK's anime removed [Spoiler](/s "Wild Hut's plot significance") and made it another [Spoiler](/s ""introduced to die same episode"") style, ditched Kurome and Wave's character development. 

Removed a lot of the feels in Akame and Kurome's backstories. To be fair the anime left a lot out like another series (TG)
[Spoiler](/s "Especially Wave's badass fight with Shura") which was one of my favorite parts of the manga....other than [Spoiler](/s "Shura torturing Lubbock, then my one balled fiend owns that cunt") 

So much respect for him after that.

>> ARTICLE
Again, I said that up until they diverged from the anime, it was an almost perfect adaptation. After the [AgK spoiler](/s "Mine and Seryuu fight"), the anime shit the bricks when it came to the story and the pacing, but it doesn't mean that the stuff that happened before wasn't a good adaptation. 

>> ARTICLE
God damn do I wish they adapted Wave better.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah they really did butcher wave in the anime. He was way more badass in the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
HxH.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. It was even better than the manga.

>> ARTICLE
I think haikyuu is great adaptation, i really feel the tension from manga, HYPE!!
>> ARTICLE
F/SN, Witch Craft Works, Nisekoi are my top picks, on top of being the most faithful to the source they also added extra charm to it.
>> ARTICLE
I thought I was alone in really liking WCW. It's actually one of my top 10 from the year. Maybe even top 5!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it definitely went under the radar for most, it was one of my favourites too. Enjoyed the anime more than the manga in this case with regards to the chapters it adapted.
>> ARTICLE
I've been meaning to check out the manga, how is it? 
>> ARTICLE
The manga is good, if you liked the anime you'll like the manga too as it's just more of the same stuff but delves deeper into the actual plot. Anime covered first 27 nicely you can jump in at 28.
>> ARTICLE
I tend not to start halfway through like that, plus it's been a while. Maybe I'll rewatch the anime and then start at 27
>> ARTICLE
I see, well as I said above, WCW was pretty much a perfect adaptation so nothing in those 27CHs it covered was skipped, so rewatching the anime or starting from CH1 both work fine.
>> ARTICLE
Alright. I'll probably rewatch. Thanks! 
>> ARTICLE
A lot of filler but it's funny as hell so it's okay and the anime is better because of the colors and what not. But still really good. I also love WCW so yes you guys aren't the only ones
>> ARTICLE
There's dozens of us! 

But thanks, I'll check it out then! 
>> ARTICLE
Parasyte, FSN:UBW and NGNL definitely.

All 3 of them kept are entertaining. I don't even have to justify Parasyte, adapt a manga that published 18-20 years ago, relatable in modern time.

Even if you didn't liked NGNL's asspulls, brother MC, you gotta admit MadHouse made it so beautiful.
>> ARTICLE
One of the crazy things about NGNL is that it's not a manga. Which means 99% of the show was original art. Even if they pulled most or all of it from the text the execution of the art was just so good 
>> ARTICLE
I think it should be Nisekoi that wins this one.

SHAFT did a ridiculously good job making the anime something really special. Especially when compared to shows in the same genre. SHAFT's SHAFTiness just works really well for Nisekoi.
>> ARTICLE
[Ah, Shaft huh] (http://i.imgur.com/Ifdrnp3.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Sure they did SHAFTy things and it's awesome, but we also have HxH as a contender. Everyone who read the manga knows that the art wasn't the best thing ever, but what Madhouse did with what little the source gave them is incredible.
>> ARTICLE
I think Parasyte is a good contender as well, the manga was very old and they've had to update it with current technology and culture.  In addition, they've made everything look way more detailed.
>> ARTICLE
> tokyo Ghoul


[Hahaha ahahaha](http://i.minus.com/idSxzVmZOHUak.gif)

But seriously, this is gonna be a hard one. I want  witchcraft works or parasyte to win, but they're gonna have to go against Hunter x Hunter, nisekoi, fate/stay night, and the monogatari series? I can't decide!

Before I get a bunch of questions, the reason I split up Tsukimonogatari and Hanamonogatari is because they were both adapted from different LNs. Hanamonogatari is from the LN *Monogatari Series: Second Season* and Tsukimonogatari is from *Monogatari Series: Final Season.* Even if they're the same series, I feel like it's different enough for them to be separated.

Edit: also wanted to mention that the adaptation award should go to an anime that didn't just adapt their manga or VN the best, but made the most out of the source material. For example, urban just commented that Nisekoi should win. It's definitely a good possibility or should be at least. The adaptation itself might not be perfect but the added reaction faces and 'Shaftness' of the show should definitely make it a contender in my opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
Nisekoi!!!!

Ping Pong: The Animation is a major improvement on Ping Pong by Taiyo. Not only in terms of colors and music, they gave Kazama and Kong a way longer back story, which really adds to the drama of the story. There are some nice adaptions here and there, but this is the best.

I know this is really not the place to be asking questions but to watch fate/stay night do I need to watch the first fate show that was out in 2006?
>> ARTICLE
Before I get into this, there's a [guide here](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate#wiki_where_should_i_start.3F) made by /r/anime, so assume that that is correct. I'm going to do a bit of background on the series here as well. 

To my knowledge (please correct me if I'm wrong) the Fate/series all started with the [Fate/stay night](https://vndb.org/v11). The series escalated from there, having a ton of spin off series including [Fate/Hollow Ataraxia](https://vndb.org/v50), [Fate/kaleid liner PrismaIllya](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14829), [Carnival Phantasm](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10012) and probably a few I'm either forgetting or never even heard of. 

So, the general series starts with Fate/stay night. The original anime adaptation was considered trash, but at the same time, ufotable (the studio behind the newer anime like Fate/Zero and the TV version of Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works) assumed that you've already seen it and dipped right into Fate/Zero. I personally started with Fate/Zero and I don't really recommend doing it that way, if for no other reason than [vague F/Z spoilers](/s "the ending is either really really confusing or doesn't make any sense"). I haven't finished *any* part of Fate/stay night though, so I might be wrong. 

Anyways, getting to the order. The Fate/stay night VN is split up into three routes. The first is called Fate, second is called Unlimited Blade Works, and the third is called Heaven's Feel. In order to play through the second part, you have to play through the first one. So in other words, you can't just start with Heaven's Feel unless you find a version of the game that has it unlocked, you have to play Fate and then UBW first. Since the LN (Light Novel) for Fate/Zero came out after F/SN, it's generally agreed that you should check F/SN first. 

Here's the most popular/best order. 

>Fate/stay night visual novel (full) > Fate/Zero anime > Any F/SN anime or spin offs you're interested in.

If you're not totally against VNs but prefer anime:

>Fate/stay night VN: Fate route > Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works anime > Fate/stay night Heaven's Feel Movie(s) > Fate/Zero anime > Spinoffs

If you don't want to do a VN at all, use the same one as above, but cut out the Fate route altogether. There is no good adaptation of it yet.

Here's how I did it:

>Fate/Zero anime > Fate/stay night VN Fate route > Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works Anime > Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel Anime movie(s) > spinoffs

The reason this way is frowned upon is that Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero actually spoil each other, so F/SN spoils Fate/Zero and vice versa. Fate/Zero spoils more of Fate/stay night than the other way around, if that makes sense.

You might be asking yourself, what's the difference between 'Best animation' and 'Best Art style?'

Well, the main difference is that the art style goes by how good a still image of a certain show can look, both stylistically and graphically. Animation goes by how good or bad that looks *in motion*. A show like Ping Pong, while a lot of people dislike the art style, could definitely be a contender because of how smooth the animation was... Just as an example. :)

Kaguyahime Monogatari - 2 votes

Now I know why most artistic awards are handled by a group of judges. 

I thought that /r/anime's public opinion was pretty below average with Tokyo Ghoul winning best opening. But letting this Ghibli movie go unnoticed in the animation department is a crime against humanity. The whole subreddit should be shut down.

So I think that a selection of users can pull out a better Awarded selection than the popular vote. Take 5 or 10 users from each age group and have them vote on the best shows of the year. 
>> ARTICLE
> In the next year, people should vote on candidate anime and also select 10 or so users for them to decide which shows get the awards.

Huh. Never thought of something like that. I might actually try this out, although I feel like there's going to be so many people that would be upset about it.

I have to say that **Me!Me!Me!** has an outstanding animation quality. For its own right it is and being a short it is god damn amazing compared to all these other contestants. **Sora no Method**, the first anime produced by the new producers **Studio 3Hz** is a splendid first work (animation wise...). **No Game No Life** animation wise is good, not outstanding as the other nominees but what NGNL does better is its use of color palette and cinematography.

Sakamichi no Apollon slowrolls its status as "the only 2012 anime with a prayer of appealing to anyone outside of anime fans". Hyouka does respectably, but its numbers, along with all recent KyoAni shows, pale in comparison to LoliButts Operation. SAO proves adolescent power fantasies are a dream that cross oceans, with equal success in Japan and abroad. Shinsekai Yori continues to be outsold by damp paper towels. The industry marches on.

It's considered hugely successful if over 10,000 copies are sold....
just saying.

I'm surprised that Kuroko no Basuke is only that high despite the insane popularity in doujinshi community and elsewhere.
>> ARTICLE
Do you know why these number are relatively low compared to other video sales? 10.000 copies can't be far more than 300.000$, which doesnt seem much for a whole animation company, or am I missing something major?
>> ARTICLE
A season of anime doesn't cost $30, it's closer to $300.
>> ARTICLE
Although I'm not so sure about how much they make, well, let me just say that anime industry is actually pretty hungry business, where people work endlessly in a pretty bad condition.
>> ARTICLE
Each volume (of which there are 6 per series) is $60 each, so $320 per series sold.  There's also DVDs and sales made later down the road.  Then there's merchandise like figurines sold for hundreds of dollars (not sure what royalties/margins the studios get), OSTs, posters/wallscrolls, plushies etc. I assume that since they pay to air their series (versus being paid in western TV companies) they might also get paid for their shows viewership by advertisers/the TV network for advertising.

They don't make crazy amounts of money per series, that's why the animation quality is so low in the first place. The animators in Japan are paid pretty poorly and a lot of the work is passed out to Koreans and others to keep the costs as low as possible. Animation quality also doesn't really seem to affect sales so there's not much point investing in something which doesn't seem them any returns.
>> ARTICLE
Seeing Shin sekai yori at the bottom, while seeing shows like Busou Shinki or Oniichan dakedo getting four-five times the number of sales, really makes me lose hope in the industry. I was hopping SSY would launch a trend for anime based on actual novels but no, apparently telling a story isn't as successful as pandering.

Not that there's anything wrong with LN or VN, but the keep adapting the strangest titles..
>> ARTICLE
SSY really is glorious. If anyone hasn't looked into it yet then go try it now. It just doesn't have the mass appeal or otaku pandering to be a success. It's a niche interest within a niche interest. Disappointing because the anime medium has so much potential for bringing good stories to life with the right art and music and SSY is a great example of it.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone tell me what these numbers are?
>> ARTICLE
These numbers are combined BD/DVD sales in Japan for each of the series in total.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, so some shows actually sell less than 400 copies?
>> ARTICLE
Ginga e Kickoff is a kids show. Who buys kids shows on DVD? NTR is something I'm quite surprised about. I haven't seen it, but it looked like the kind of show that would sell at least 2k.
>> ARTICLE
If a show is not well received, then yeah it can sell very little.  With the amount of money put into each show, studios can afford few failures.  I suspect (don't quote me on this, merely a thought) it's why studios create shows which pander to the Japanese otaku with shows featuring moe, fanservice, etc.  Those shows will be much more likely to succeed.

No, unless a third season comes, the anime will end with Murasakibara's match, since there's only one episode left. [In the manga](/s "they're currently facing Akashi, quite a fierce battle. After the match it might as well end, i don't think it could go on longer unless they lose to Akashi.")

I doubt they'll win.

In sports shounen, the main team always wins (unless we're talking about Major) after losing for the first time. They already lost to Aomine's team in s1, so they must win the Winter Cup.

**Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?**  

A: I am very curious about **["Kantai Collection"](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21511/Kantai_Collection:_KanColle)**, mostly because I know very little about it and its massive popularity. Also, from the few pieces of information I do have about the show, the premise seems extremely ludicrous, which is only piquing my curiousity. 
>> ARTICLE
**Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?**

A: As I'm quite the fan of the last two seasons I'm quite hyped for [Kuroko's Basketball](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24415/Kuroko_no_Basket_3rd_Season) airing it's 3rd season, after watching the 2nd season I couldn't wait anymore and read the manga so I know what happens but I'm still very interested in seeing it animated, Honorable mentions to Tsukimonogatari and Durararax2.

Durarara x2. This is probably the safest pick for me, I don't drop shows so I generally stick to sequels until 3-4 weeks in where I pick up some newer anime.
>> ARTICLE
>**Q: What series from the coming season are you most excited for?**

Kantai Collection. I mean, it's based on a game where girls are battleships. Let's see how they'll make an anime adaption out of that.  
Aldnoah.Zero season 2 is another one I'm looking forward to. I liked the first season and I'm curious about how they'll explain and continue with [spoilers for season TWO](/s "Saazbaum, Asseylum and Inaho still alive. Asseylum probably is in a wheelchair and Inaho probably has some major aftereffect(s) and character development of being shot by Slaine. I don't know about Saazbaum though.")

Between the [ecchi fest](http://youtu.be/oVYzfGDK_Uk) and the **10 goddamn sequels** we'll be getting.

I'm looking forward to [Yuri Bear Storm](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26165/) and [Junketsu no Maria](http://myanimelist.net/anime/26441/) carried by the director's names.

Yuri Bear Storm is by Ikuhara, the auteur mind behind Utena and Penguindrum, you owe yourself to follow the production of his work.

Junketsu, despite being an adult ecchi comedy fantasy(which is still better than an LN btw!), it by Goro Taniguchi, the director behind Planetes(and one of /r/anime's darlings as well).

So yeah, *look into those*, without much hype and anticipation.

Tsukimonogatari also get my attention, since I'm a Monogatari fan.

Do you mean like in the case of Gintama where only 28% of the users that have it on their list have completed while 51k (Also 28%) out of 178k people are planing to watch it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, seems like an interesting measure, Legend of the Galactic Heroes has more people who plan to watch it than who have actually completed it, for example.
>> ARTICLE
It should be possible but kinda hard to pull off since not only is the data on the website really off sometimes but you also can only sort by a single field. 

I've tried limiting the number of members that have the shows on their list as well as limit the complete and plan percentage so it kinda looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KW8wFUU.png) but then you've to deal with the wrong data like in Jinsei and M3's case.

Scraping the data from MAL directly might yield better results but I've no idea how to do that. You could try playing around with the settings [here](http://test.animeadvice.me/#state/plantocompleteratio) to give you a better list but it won't be really 100% accurate.

Yeah kinda crazy that we already have a trailer and general idea of when heavens feel is going to be released before we even get something other than a title card for evangelion 4.0

It's melodramatic, poorly written at times, and crawls at a snails pace. The flashbacks that repeated the same thing over and over triggered my GGO PTSD. It's a good show, and I'm certainly enjoying it, but calling it a masterpiece just devalues the shows truly deserving of that title, IMO.
>> ARTICLE
I meant compared to the other anime of this season.

>> ARTICLE
Masterpiece isn't a comparative word. A masterpiece is a masterpiece regardless of context. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably the only show that will make me fall in love with a middle schooler...
>> ARTICLE
I never get which school system the translation's based on: the Japanese one or the American. Either way, I won't understand shit if it's not called elementary, secondary and university.

It's absurd to compare two shows that have nothing in common.

I meant that a lot of people talk about it compared to Your Lie in April. Sorry, I should've made that clearer.

Katanagatari is not 50 hours long. It's 10.

Those are minutes and it's for the longest episodes.

I must've missed the title inbetween that and the category above.

I can't believe that Fairy Tail is more popular than Parasyte. You can't even compare those 2 shows, parasyte is so much better.

And theeere's the person finding any reason they can to bitch about Fairy Tail.

You can't really compare the two since one of them has been airing since 2009 while the other one has barely started this season.

Can someone explain what the numbers are in relation to current vol./total vol.?

So for SAO, would this be an accurate reading of the data: the 39,745 sales are the average sales over the only three volumes currently out (6 have yet to be released).

EDIT: Oh what is the time scale of these sales? Per week/month/total sales?
>> ARTICLE
The numbers are the average of the Volume sales. So yes 39,745 is the average for the 3 volumes of SAO out right now and not the combined number. When another volume of SAO comes out it will then be averaged into the numbers.

Expect any of the averages for incomplete series to go down when they are completed as First volume sales are almost always highest.

Edit: These are the sales totals. After volumes stop ranking on Oricon they are considered the total for that volume since the numbers drop to such an insignificant degree like >100units/week
>> ARTICLE
So it would be fair to say that SAO has sold about 120,000 units (~40,000 * 3). Which would mean it would have 120,000 * ~$50 = $6,000,000 roughly in sales of those first three volumes? That's pretty baller if so.

Last question. How do volumes rank on Oricon then?
>> ARTICLE
Oricon collects data from tens of thousands of retailers and releases the sales data for the top 50 Bluray and top 50 DVD in sales for each week. Recently they changed it to include the top 100 of each. 

Anything over 500 sales will usually show up on the list and even more will now that it is 100, so the sales data is fairly accurate
>> ARTICLE
SAO volumes are 66 USD on amazon.co.jp, so it'd be 7.9mil. That's also discounted from the RRP of 90 USD so it'd likely be more when factoring in smaller discounts from other retailers.
>> ARTICLE
On Chapter 169.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!

Just a little tip, you can see where the anime left off by checking [Mangaupdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=39087).

The manga is also getting a continuation so you picked the right time to get hooked.

Yuuki Yuuna is a 2014 show.
>> ARTICLE
my bad i remembered it wrong, i thought it aired on winter
>> ARTICLE
I chose to ignore shows that started in 2014 the other day when I was taking a look at how 2015 stacked up in my eyes, so here's the top ten of that:

- Etotama  
- Shokugeki no Souma  
- Shimoneta  
- Koufuku Graffiti  
- Jojo  
- The Rolling Girls  
- Joukamachi no Dandelion
- Baby Steps
- Yuri Kuma Arashi
- Working!!!

If I let the fall 2014 leftovers in then Shirobako would take the top spot, but otherwise the list would probably stay the same.
>> ARTICLE
I'm extremely happy to see someone mention Dandelion since while it wasn't in my top 10, it was a hidden gem not many talked about during its airing and is something I really enjoyed
>> ARTICLE
Some of my favorites have been Rokka no Yuusha, Overlord, Gakkou Gurashi, Utawarerumono(airing), Dungeon ni something or other, and Kekkai sensen.   
  Edit: Parasyte ended in 2015 so add that to the list.
>> ARTICLE
After much deliberation:

1. Parasyte
2. One Punch Man
3. Shokugeki No Souma
4. Prison School
5. Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in A Dungeon (Danmachi)

1. Shirobako

Haven't watched that much outside this season, (also considering I only started 4 months ago) but anyway here are my top 5:

4. Yuru Yuri SanHai!

5. One Punch Man

4. Shirobako
3. Gakkou Gurashi
2. Maria the Virgin Witch
1. Rokka no Yuusha

Only listing 5 since I've only seen maybe 15-20 shows from this year.

1. SNAFU Season 2  
2. Noragami Aragoto  
3. Death Parade  
4. Yona of the Dawn  
5. Rokka no Yuusha

The Perfect Insider has a small chance of taking the #5 spot.  As of now I wouldn't put it there (obviously), but if the last two episodes are good enough I could see them pushing the show just high enough to pass Rokka.
>> ARTICLE
Two clear favorites are Shirobako and Working!!! Other than that, in no particular order:

* Akagami no Shirayuki-hime

* Classroom Crisis

* Hibike! Euphonium

* Non Non Biyori: Repeat

* Etotama

* GochiUsa S2/KinMosa S2

3. Owarimonogatari
4. Yuru Yuri San Hai
5. Nisekoi:

Didn't include any left overs from 2014 as there were a couple of good ones I could have considered.
>> ARTICLE
[A nice overview](http://i.imgur.com/AEmks8J.png)
>> ARTICLE
This is my first year ever watching seasonal anime (I started the day that Death Parade first aired); so, there are no sequels on this list aside from spinoffs that have minimal connection with their original source material. 

1. Hibike Euphonium 

2. Iron Blooded Orphans (so far, if it stays this good. I'm way too invested in this show's writing, and I've never even watched anything Gundam related before.) 

3. One Punch Man

4. Death Parade

5. Kekkai Sensen 

6. Yuri Kuma Arashi

7.  Osomatsu-San (again, so far. I could watch this show even if it went on forever, like Gintama. Also, this doesn't affect my ranking at all, but it's the only show this year besides Death Parade that has made me cry. It's truly a testiment to how this show juggles heart and comedy with such ease. Jyushimatsu...)

8. Gakkou Gurashi

***OBJECTION!***

There *will* be.
>> ARTICLE
Can't say there's much hope for that man's legal career if he can't even read the evidence, smh
>> ARTICLE
As DeForrest Kelly would say: "Dammit Jim, I'm an Engineer, not a Defense Attorney!"

Although I *did* do Mock Trial back in high school. Fun times, but I was always frustrated by the lack of evidence to use. The NYS Bar was never as thorough as I wanted them to be with the cases. I mean, the current high-school level case isn't even an actual trial, it's a criminal hearing. And apparently the person from the Bar who co-ordinates the Mock Trial tournament wasn't even aware of that until I brought it to her attention.
>> ARTICLE
Ho man, thanks for reminding me of my high school trial

Shit was tight on my end. I feel like the limited evidence kinda made things a bit more realistic and made you have to focus more on inferences. 
>> ARTICLE
The focus on inferences thing can kind of backfire if the cases aren't constructed well, though. I remember one case we won the trial decision on where my summation basically did Phoenix's thing of using implication from the evidence to put the blame on one of the other side's witnesses. We won by points too on that trial, which was nice.

Still, my favorite moments were the ones where a witness makes a small error that invalidates their entire testimony. I still remember the trial where one of the prosecution witnesses, for a case where the crime was set in Queens, testified that she witnessed everything happen in Brooklyn. The next words out of my mouth after she finished her statement were "No further questions, Your Honor."

Guess what I brought up in summation for that trial?
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha, fucking witnesses. One of the witnesses for the other team was a very inattentive stoner (who probably came to trial high) and literally couldn't remember his own name. I hope we won that trial...

I remember in another mock trial I was the shop teacher witness and I straight up looked up how to work some of the machinery mentioned (even though it was barely relevant to the case) just in case. The prosecution tried to ask me how to work it just to throw me off and I threw it right back in their face. It was beautiful. 
>> ARTICLE
> One of the witnesses for the other team was a very inattentive stoner (who probably came to trial high) and literally couldn't remember his own name.

You think that's bad? My first year, our top attorney couldn't remember the names of *any* of the witnesses. And apparently he had been doing that for the whole time he'd been with the team. Still won rounds though since apart from that he was a damn good attorney. And seeing witnesses turn the tables back on cross examiners is always tons of fun.

since u answered on a comment where someone mentioned magi i have a question.

in short: why did u write prequel/season 3?

Because it's a prequel, but should not be watched before Labyrinth/Kingdom. Kinda like Kizu+Nekomonogatari:Kuro

I wonder what they will do with Sapphire?  
Her VA, Matsuki Miyu died recently.
>> ARTICLE
That's terrible!

How'd she die?
>> ARTICLE
That dreaded Japanese cold if I remember right. Anime don't mess around when they say "but you'll catch a cold!" Apparently the cold virus variant in Japan is much deadlier than it is elsewhere.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm wondering what they will do too. She was perfect for the role too
>> ARTICLE
She sure was.

Likewise, I wonder how they will deal with the fact that Matsuki voiced Lailah in Tales of Zestiria, which is getting a anime next year.

She died too young, with no one to replace her. :(
>> ARTICLE
I may have to stop playing it in English now, even if Lailah is Rom from Neptunia, Mami from Madoka, and Satsuki from Kill la Kill.

She's definitely missed :(
>> ARTICLE
Oh, she's Rom in the English dub.  
Neptunia is one of the few games I like to hear in English.  
IMO, Neptune's English VA kicks ass, and might be better than the JP VA. Compa too.  
Iris Heart though, JP all the way!

I wish Matsuki had a protog to take over her roles like Lupin the third's first VA, Yamada Yasuo had.  
He stated that he wanted Kurita Kanichi to take over the role if he died, and Kurita did.  
Kurita really sounds like Yamada did, so Lupins voice didn't really change much, which is good.

I feel like they will likely recast her. :/

I have big hopes for [Dimension W](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31163/Dimension_W) as I am quite fond of the manga

Why do you have Schwarzesmarken as a Total Eclipse spin-off?  
It's a spin-off from the original Muv-Luv VNs, just like TE is.

I'm saying this mostly because I want people to try it, since it's more like the OG VNs, and not like TE(or more like TEs first 2 episodes).

Rewrite is hopefully gonna be amazing.  
We have Tanaka Romeo onboard, so I have moderate hopes for it.
>> ARTICLE
> Why do you have Schwarzesmarken as a Total Eclipse spin-off?

MAL had it labelled that way. Fixed it

> Rewrite

They were making some pretty ballsy statements. I remember reading a TL that went something like "the anime will be the ultimate play-through of the game"
>> ARTICLE
Lol what?

So, either it will be amazing or it will fail so hard it will be the next Tsukihime.  
I hope they know what they are talking about.  
Some staff are quite good, but 8-bit itself worries me, Comet Lucifer wasn't good, though Grisaia no Rakuen was quite nice.

Yeah, MAL ain't a super reliable source, I don't know why many believe it is(not directing this at you).
>> ARTICLE
yeah I left a lot of their "information" out, that one just slipped thru because I know pretty much nothing about the Muv-Luv franchise. 
>> ARTICLE
It's fine.

If you like mecha or sci-fi and don't have a problem with lots and lots of reading, then I suggest you try the VNs when they come out.  
I honestly think they are one of the best stories in fiction.  
A wild ride indeed.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I'm planning on playing them when they come out. I started on Katawa Shoujo and Grisaia a couple months ago, and went ahead and bought a bunch of others like Saya no Uta and the new Clannad release. 

Now I just gotta play all of them...
>> ARTICLE
Saya no uta is really fast, about 10 hours and it's pretty good but super nsfw, praise urobutcher
>> ARTICLE
> praise urobutcher

back when he was actually 3edgy5me in the 2000s, hitting his peak with the total grimdark fest that was Fate/Zero. Dude started to mellow out around 2010 or so.
>> ARTICLE
Oh nice. I hope you like 'em.

To add to your list, you should try Ourai no Gahkthun, an amazing Steampunk VN.  
The writing and TL quality is amazing in that one.  
And if you liked Yumiko from from Grisiaia, then you might enjoy listening to Neon from Gahkthun, they share VA. 

Btw, do you use VNDB? It has a lot of info in VNs.  
Here's the page for [Gahkthun](https://vndb.org/v11033).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah VNDB has some pretty good info. Saved me a bit of grief regarding 18+ titles on Steam.

Yeah Yumiko's route was fun, its always nice to watch the ice queens melt. Amane and Sachi's routes were probably my favorites though. I've been taking it easy on VNs lately though.. bad endings are some of the most disturbing things I've ever experienced, I get shaken up just thinking about them
>> ARTICLE
Have you started Saya yet?  
That one requires being "okay" with really fucked up things.  
I totally recommend it though.

Amane's route was my favorite. Yumiko's was probably my least liked one, but Yumiko as a character was great.  
Grisaia was/is very good, I liked it enough to spend 500 USD on the kickstarter, so, yeah. I like it.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I know its Urobuchi so I know what I'm getting myself into at least.

>Schwarzesmarken[13] (Jan 11) - Spinoff of the Muv-Luv visual novel series, which includes characters from Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien. The series is currently being officially translated to English by Sekai Project

It's being translated by [Degica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degica#Upcoming_games) not Sekai, you may want to change that. Also you can add Dies Irae it's gonna air sometime in 2017 as a full series.

>ChoS;Child 

Visual novel is fucking amazing, much better than Chaos; Head or horrible anime adaptation of C;H. I really hope they don't screw up this one. In my opinion ;C even better then Stains; Gate.

[Tenkyou no Alderamin ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31764/Nejimaki_Seirei_Senki:_Tenkyou_no_Alderamin) is also adaptation that I'm looking forward to, because it's one of my favorite light novel, and it's cool as fuck.

No, with exception of some references here and there they are pretty stand alone.  And C;H anime is kinda bad, don't watch it.

**"Fairy Tail Zero" will be a next arc of Fairy Tail (2014), starting Jan. 9, at episode 91 (or 266).** So this will actually be an "arc" in the 2014 anime? Not its own standalone thing? Do i have to catch up to the 2014 version now or what?
>> ARTICLE
I think zero can stand on its own pretty well. Just if you haven't seen any fairy tail at all (at least some of the first anime) you won't know why some of the characters are important.
>> ARTICLE
Zero will be about the first master of fairy tail. Watch at least some of fairy tail to get what it feels like
>> ARTICLE
How many episodes will it be? 
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it, it's a prequel manga so if you've seen a good portion of the anime, youre probably fine. The current arc ends right before the start of Zero, and I saw someone post saying it's the perfect spot to put the adaption in as a flashback arc.

Should mean that the anime will have plenty of manga chapters to work with too, by the time Zero is done
>> ARTICLE
After the last episode for the preview for the next episode they had zero instead of the main story so definitely part of the normal anime and not seperate.

>Koe no Katachi 

Bullying is a ultra rare theme in anime i think, even rarer they try to spin a positive story with it as the theme.  Even rare KyoAni is behind it. I don't know how to feel about it honestly. could be bad or good 

>Teekyuu 7 

TIL there exists an anime that has survived to the 7th season. Is Teekyuu the gunsmoke of anime? (In duration of the series at least, you get it)
>> ARTICLE
Well Teekyuu is like the definition of chaos and insanity complete with references to everything, and who doesn't like a weekly 2 minutes of chaos and insanity (still including references)?

It also has ridiculously low production costs, if I am correct it is all drawn by one person.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't know KyoAni was behind Koe no Katachi. Was already interested but hearing KyoAni just skyrocketed it. Seeing how well KyoAni have done the last few years, it's safe to say they'll do pretty well with the material. 
>> ARTICLE
the animation itself might be pretty good but the material might flop. 

I don't know if KyoAni doesn't like it they will just butcher it to be more appealing as they do with most series. 

Honestly its either gonna be great or its gonna be shit. I dont think there will be a middle ground
>> ARTICLE
the source material is my favorite manga. i'm very interested in seeing how kyoani will compress 64 chapters into a movie. 

i get the feeling that the movie *will* turn out well, but people who enjoyed the source material will inevitably complain. They will have to cut out a significant amount of content simply because of time constraints.

I'm pretty sure the movie will do great, they can definitely cut some stuff from the manga if I recall correctly it was somewhat slow sometimes

>> ARTICLE
It's high-profile only because of all the backers who have lost faith in the project after all the shady shenanigans that went on with the production companies and the ~~hostile~~ takeover of Kinema Citrus over it while kicking Creative Intelligence Arts to the curb.

I still remember that huge-ass post on this sub by someone allegedly close to Creative Intelligence Arts bitching out Jiro Ishii and fingering him as the source of all the problems with Under the Dog.
>> ARTICLE
It's a significant show because it was crowdfunded. A show with basically no prior knowledge or fanbase was crowdfunded by people in the West. [The director ](http://myanimelist.net/people/6518/Ando_Masahiro) is also pretty significant and has worked on a bunch of other high profile stuff.

Sword Art Online Season 3 should be on here too, release date unconfirmed but likely 2016.
>> ARTICLE
That isn't necessarily true.  By this time of year before Season 2 they already had Extra Edition announced and ready and it aired at the end of December if I remember correctly.  SAO: Ex then had the S2 announcement on it which followed in July of the following year.  First Season was announced in October the year before the Summer airing date.

So if they follow the same trend and announce SAO S3 at the end of the upcoming movie, you might end up waiting another 6 months afterward at least to get Season 3.  So unless the movie comes out real soon, there is a very high probability that the show gets pushed to either the end of 2016 (Fall season) or ends up in the 2017 Winter Season.

I would guess Winter 2017 is when SAO Season 3 is going to land.

It's good.

* MC is not the typical *"will and friendship always wins over logic"* shounen MC, but a more logical one that doesn't underestimate his opponents. But, at the same time, he is not a flawless character.

* The author goes against tropes, makes characters interesting and unlike other shounen manga, he is not afraid to make the story progress.

* Things you would think would happen in the distant future (40+ chapters), end happening way sooner.

* Morally ambiguous characters and an interesting world add more flavor to the story.

Sorry about this roundabout way to tell you guys about this, the character count was too high to fit it in the OP. As usual, the names and anime names in the post are clickable to go to their MAL pages.

It might be obvious already, but this is the setup yet again for the polls:

>Character 'necessary-for-identification nickname' name (anime name)

 I decided that since we will be having a poll thread at the end now with the winners of each poll thread anyways, I'll hold off on the best overall MC poll until we get there, and just include the top 5 or 10 from each poll. 

Here's the links for the last threads: [OP/ED]( http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2sqbsd/ranime_awards_poll_thread_1_best_op_and_best_ed/) | [Anime of the year by genre]( http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2stqvy/ranime_awards_poll_thread_2_anime_of_the_year_by/) | [Best Male Character]( http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2sy35q/ranime_awards_2014_poll_thread_3_best_male/) | [Best Female Character]( http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2sy3i0/ranime_awards_2014_poll_thread_31_best_female/) | [Best Character Development](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2t1p5k/ranime_awards_2014_poll_thread_4_best_character/)

Uhhh yeah, check out the wild card thing. Or else. I probably won't respond to any 'my character isn't in it, wtf bruh?' type comments because I put the whole idea first and foremost in the post. 

Let me know if you're willing to help me collect ab/muscles or boob pictures for tomorrow's 'best chest' thread. (mainly need help with ab/muscles)

This is specifically for the people that didn't see the nomination thread. Basically, I'll be doing this for the rest of my threads.

What would you count as a "main female character" in a balanced harem series like Trinity 7. None of the females stand out too far above the rest, so I'm not sure who of the series you would classify as "main".

If you think like I do then I would say that several of them, at least, could be considered main based off of the anime due to their near constant prevalence in the series.

In particular, I'd like to nominate Levi from Trinity 7, because I think she's more than prevalent enough in the series to be considered a main character.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't personally finished Trinity Seven yet and I haven't watched in a while, so bear with me.

[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25157/Trinity_Seven/characters) has 8 characters listed as 'main.' I would go ahead and include any of those. I assume the MC Arata is in there and then the other 7 are the 7 girls. I don't go off of just the MAL thing, unless I haven't seen the series and don't know any better.

So, a safe bet would be MAL I guess. If I've seen a show, I'll use my own judgement. Levi is fine.
>> ARTICLE
Aight mate. Now I just have to pray for /r/anime to develop my God-tier taste and vote Levi to the top.

Nah, that's kind of the point of it. If it gets upvoted more than a character, the character obviously wasn't popular enough to win anyways.

I think next year we should find a team to make this whole thing better. Don't get me wrong, you're doing a wonderful job. But I can only imagine how much time you spend doing all of this and considering everyone's opinion.    

It may be a little confusing for new people that want to come and vote. I was thinking of an automated database year that adds all shows that aired in a respective year to the categories we decided on.(and maybe a strict number of categories, not so many)   
 
From there, everyone can access it and pick the show that they think it should be nominated. (it would look somewhat like [AniChart's interface](http://anichart.net/spring) )   

I guess this doesn't help that much now, sorry.
>> ARTICLE
That's okay. It's always good to get more input. I do spend a lot of time, and I kind of wish I had a group working instead of just me, but that's alright because I'm having fun with it and it's fun to add ideas specifically to each thread. 

The only thing is, if that type of thing happened next year, I probably wouldn't be involved or as involved. I'm not good with coding or making a website or anything else. Plus I enjoy making the crazy threads, even if it takes forever.

It's kinda unfair letting characters of a character drama compete against... well ordinary shows. I mean, it's just the inherent nature of a charater drama to put all it's work in characterizing its charaters. 

Well, anyway, congratulations to Smile and Peco for being the best characters of 2014. You deserve it.

I'm going to go ahead and call a win for Koyomi or Okabe and Kurisu, because of the /r/anime Steins;Gate and Monogatari fetish outweighing good taste, as seen by the best girl contest.

Yes, any best character contest on this sub is a joke.  Who will stand victorious amongst the circlejerk this time.
>> ARTICLE
Its never a best anything. It only popularity contest. It doesn't matter if everyone who watched Ping Pong thought that Makoto Tsukimoto was the best male MC. If 3 times the people watched Hunter x Hunter and half thought Killua is the best male MC of the year. Then Killua would win even though a higher percentage of people though Tsukimoto was the better MC

Glad to see Gin no Saji have a high "favorite show transference," it was absolutely amazing. Not surprised to see Chuu season 2 fall off; I, like many others, was very disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Chuu2 messed up, starting the Season at 3rd in Week 3 and ending up at 17th at the end, quite the drop.
>> ARTICLE
just a heads up I think you accidently skipped Hajime no Ippo for "favorite show transference"
>> ARTICLE
It had 30 viewers. The cutoff criteria was 50 viewers.

Transference in particular is extremely sensitive to small viewer-count. If 4 people watched a show and 3 of them voted for it for top show, it'd rule the chart.
>> ARTICLE
> It had 30 viewers.

I looked at it and quickly decided that it just wasn't in my interest range.
>> ARTICLE
oh I didnt notice that, ok nvm then.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't realize Samurai Flamenco was so unpopular. I finished watching it a few days ago and loved it.

Kill la Kill tops the charts, surprising no one (I really should continue watching it).

Is Space Dandy not any good? I thought it would be more popular just based on the director's pedigree (much like KLK).
>> ARTICLE
> Is Space Dandy not any good? I thought it would be more popular just based on the director's pedigree (much like KLK).

Good or not, it was *disappointing*, meaning expectations were not met. It was episodic, so people didn't feel compelled to keep watching.
>> ARTICLE
Which is odd. The first time I heard of it, I thought it would be a wacky space adventure with a dandy guy, and that was just what I got.
>> ARTICLE
I also thought it did exactly what it said it would do on the tin. It was a dandy show with a dandy guy... in space. It was a Watanabe Shinichiro show to the very core. 

Then again, folks around here don't exactly like episodic shows. So once word got out that it was episodic, it got a lot of flak from the redditaku. (Or should that be the hikikomoreddit...) Also too, the simu-dub caught a lot of crap as well, because dubs will always catch a lot of crap.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, it's consistently had bizarre shit going down on tons of creative alien worlds with gorgeous animation and funk music. what more could you ask for, baby?

and honestly, I like that it's episodic; the lack of connectivity means each episode is fresh and unique, and lets the show explore a lot of different scenarios.
>> ARTICLE
the ramen episode made me feel legitimately bad for meow :(
>> ARTICLE
> I didn't realize Samurai Flamenco was so unpopular.

It started out as a quirky but somewhat forgettable series. You had to wait until around ep 7 to really see it start balling out of control. It's not uncommon to have dropped the series at the 6th episode if it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.

> Is Space Dandy not any good? I thought it would be more popular just based on the director's pedigree

That's probably exactly why it tanked in the polls. Shinichiro Watanabe is not a name that can be ignored. It wouldn't surprise me if Space Dandy actually had more people watching it's first episode than that of any other  series starting that season.

It turned out that it wasn't the second coming of Cowboy Bebop, despite all the thematic similarities. It also seems to be that many people dislike the episodic format. It didn't take many episodes for interest to drop off.

All the hype aside, I think it was fine. Definitely in my top 5 for that season, including continuing from last season.
>> ARTICLE
Flamenco went the opposite way for me.  I was really into it until it started going out of control.
>> ARTICLE
Many people liked *one* mood or even *two* of Flamenco. Not many people liked them all, or even if they did, they may not have liked the transitions.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked SamFlam (all of it) but I marathoned the first half (started watching anime at the beginning of the year) so that may have played a difference. I didn't really feel it was that abrupt tbh more like WTF moments. For people who didn't like the transitions, was it because they really expected that it would go one way? Or are shows like SamFlam just unpopular?
>> ARTICLE
I thought the whole thing was so great because no matter how many times the setting changed it was still the same show that I loved from the beginning. I marathoned the first 23 episodes to be ready for the finale so I don't know what effect that might have had on my enjoyment
>> ARTICLE
oh whooo! I'm not a total weirdo then. Yeah, it really felt like the same show to me. The characters were consistent, and the show was honestly very self-aware. Admittedly Guillotine Gorilla was a big big shock, but it all made "sense" (or maybe I just have an unquestioning mind).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was weird and crazy but the only time I was really surprised was when Gorilla came because no one else had been killed throughout the show so that was big.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, I'm with you. I liked it *because* it was more grounded than other animes. Then it went off the wall and really turned me off.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that's an equally important point. Some of the people who actually liked what it was doing and kept watching that long were disappointed when it took a new direction.
>> ARTICLE
Well SamFlam may not have had the most followers but for those that did follow it, almost half of them thought it was a "Top Show" as the Transference shows, so it shows most people who watched it also loved it as well.



>> ARTICLE
yeah it's the latest hidden gem type anime since so many people dropped and it and it wasn't terribly popular to begin with but everyone who stuck with it loved it. It was one of my favorites this season and definitely should have been a contender for AOTS
>> ARTICLE
Man the lack of Ippo on this list is fucking depressing.
>> ARTICLE
I've heard very good things about it, it's just that I've never had interest in reading/watching it, mainly because I'm not a huge fan of boxing. I'm sure I'd like it if I started watching it, since I understand that boxing is just a medium, and the real draw to it lies in other elements. But that whole "starting" thing can be half the battle sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
i felt almost the same way about chihayafuru before tiring of it midway through s2.
>> ARTICLE
I had literally 0% interest in boxing (or sports anime in general) before watching it, I picked it up and it has become one of the few tens I've given out.

Not trying to over hype it, but you should definitely make that first step to see if you might like it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll give it a try at one point. I do love me a good underdog story.
>> ARTICLE
Only ~30 said they'd watched it in the survey, so it didn't make much of an impact, but more than half the people who did watch it also selected it as a top show.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it and thought it's damn good. 

Do people not watch it because it's a sequel, repetitive, or am I missing something?
>> ARTICLE
The more seasons you go, the less watchers you have.

Sports shows are in general very popular, but less so on this subreddit.
>> ARTICLE
Well it is a Season 3, so its limited to those that have seen the first 2 seasons is most likely one main reason. Another is that sports animes generally arn't that big on here. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, a few of the graphs link to the wrong things, I've let him know.

Anyway, here's another thing of interest:

The most over-represented "liked shows", that is to say, the shows with the highest jump in position from how many watch them to how many voted them for top 3/5, after removing all shows watched by under 50 people. 

Another way to say it would be **"Most underwatched shows"**:

| Title  | Difference  | Change from W9| Change W6 > W9|
|:-----|------|--|---:|
|Gin no Saji - Silver Spoon Season 2|	10|+0|+2|
|Buddy Complex|	8|+4|-4|
|Kuroko no Basket S2|	8|N/A|N/A|
|Magi: The Kingdom of Magicl|	7|N/A|N/A|
|Wake Up, Girls!|	5|+0|+1|

Note "Buddy Complex", the +4 means it is *farther off* from where it "should be", the difference between its position in how many watch it to how many think of it as "Favourite" grew from 4 places to 8, from week 9 to season finale.

Kuroko no Basket and Magi didn't appear during the seasonal surveys, so there's no past data.

---

And the most negatively represented shows (meaning "**most over-watched shows**", that many more people watch them than those who think they should be top 3/5 material):

| Title  | Difference  | Change from W9| Change W6 > W9|
|:-----|---|---|-----:|
|Hamatora|	-16|-14|+6|
|Pupa|	-10|-7|-6|
|Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai Season 2|	-13|-13|+6|
|Onee-chan ga Kita|	-10|-3|+4|
|Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil|	-8|-5|-2|

Note Pupa, as weeks went by, the amount of people watching it may have decreased, but people's appreciation for it fell in a much steeper curve than the rate of those who could take no more of it :P

Chuunibyou... very popular. People *really* did not like the ending. Hamatora wasn't as popular, but I guess people also didn't care for the ending. Note, since this data is only based on "Favourite", it can mean people liked a show fine, but they didn't *love* it.

Week 6 to week 9 change for both Hamatora and Chuunibyou put them closer to "0", "0" in this case meaning a show is watched proportionally to how much people like it.

---

Of course, since you have the percentages, it doesn't really matter, if all had been "equal", it wouldn't matter how many people watch each show, but those who find a show favourite would be equal across the board. In a perfect world each show would be watched by the same amount of people (the average), and if a show is the most watched show, then it should also rank at the highest of those who think it's "really good", or so the argument goes.

Sorry, a bit rambly, again.

This time because it wasn't me tracking the changes across the season, and because the data was already tabulated for me, it was pretty easy going. I've worked about 2 hours on some of the weeks' results. Hope you people found them interesting :)

You can start a thread and hope they'll see it.

Out of the 5 Mahou Sensou voters, we also have:3 Log Horizon votes, and 2 votes each for Tokyo Ravens, Strike the Blood, and Buddy Complex.

If anything, it's surprising how little of the top favourite shows they voted for: Only 1 Noragami, Kill la Kill, Golden Time, Nagi no Asukara, or Witch Craft Works.

I have to say that I'm surprised to see both Hamatora and Gundam Build Fighters score so low.
>> ARTICLE
Do I need to give golden time another chance? I got to episode 12 and couldn't handle the stagnant plot anymore so i dropped it.
>> ARTICLE
Right around episode 13 is actually where, as the sage of the squared circle would put it, bidness just done picked up. When Golden Time did the end-of-cour break, it gave us the cliffhanger that made the entire show really make sense. It moves forward for another few episodes after that, goes stagnant for a couple, and then starts whacking people's tear ducts with a rubber halibut for the rest of the show.

Then again, things go forward with a plot even when a show looks like it is stagnant. A lot of the things in episodes 9-12 were plotbuilding devices for the second cour. Without those being shown, the second cour would never have made much sense. That's why I rarely complain about a show that starts to drag... I actually force myself to pay closer attention, because that is where the writer starts telling you the stuff that is about to happen.

But that's just me.

No-Rin deserves better, it was one of the best!

Can someone explain to me why Log Horizon is good? I watched the first two episodes and it didn't really live up to the SAO name.
>> ARTICLE
> it didn't really live up to the SAO name.

Well. THERE's your problem. (Someone do me a favor and find me a damn gif for that? Preferably one with Adam Savage.)

It wasn't part of SAO. It wasn't even billed as SAO. There was one major similarity between the two: people trapped inside a computer game. Everything else was different. So if you were expecting SAO to come out of Log Horizon, you would naturally be disappointed. And that would be on you for having unreasonable expectations rather than the show for not meeting them.
>> ARTICLE
It's best not to compare it to SAO at all. Other than the stuck in a game premise they are completely different.
>> ARTICLE
Still. What's so appealing about Log Horizon?
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the better question is, what's so appealing about SAO? 
>> ARTICLE
To each with their own opinion I guess. That's why I'm asking, the first two episodes of Log Horizon were pretty *meh* and I'm not attracted to *meh*.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I thought it was pretty weak, it was boring throughout and at the end it even degraded into a lot harem shenanigans. I'd say the target age group for SAO is lower than LH's but even then Log Horizon just leaves much to be desired and would've fared so much better as a single-cour anime. There were good episodes, but the ones with the younger kids and other useless episodes eclipsed those that were actually productive and interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone mentioned that Log Horizon was actually a morning show while SAO was aired in the evening suggesting that the target audience was much lower for Log Horizon (the light novel was for older audience compared to the anime). I mean SAO is currently rated "M for mature" on some sites. Not too sure about Log Horizon, haven't seen any sites giving it a official rating yet (I think MAL may be "14" like some sites rate SAO).  
>> ARTICLE
LH airs at 5:30 pm. That's an evening to me
>> ARTICLE
Really wonder why someone said it was 10 am, I'll try and look for the post. 
>> ARTICLE
That (plus or minus a couple of hours) was when the streams went live on THIS side of the Lake. In Japan, it aired in late afternoon. Here, it hit mid-morning.

Time zone calculations are always what confuses these types of posts. 
>> ARTICLE
I stuck with Log Horizon until episode 16, but I just got bored. It could have really benefited from more action scenes. At least SAO did action scenes well. Not that SAO should be compared to Log Horizon, I'm just saying that a anime inside a MMO should be more action, and less "playing house"
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely slower than SAO, but it's more focused. There aren't a lot of random side-stories that string into nothing (from what I remember of SAO). If you're looking for constant action though, that's not Log Horizon.
>> ARTICLE
You shouldn't compare the two they are nothing alike except they are both trapped in a game.

Log Horizon focuses more on portraying MMO's and teamwork/learning, while SAO is more about the action, drama, and romance.

So you hate a show because its more popular? Im sorry but that is incredibly unfair, especially since they are both written by the same author.

I think they're trying to say that because SAO was so popular, Accel World is less likely to get a second season (because SAO would get it instead).

Yes exactly and I get down voted simply for my opinion and them not even listening to my explanation which was valid.   
>> ARTICLE
Im aware that's why I was mad because one had a much larger budget accel world would have been 1000x better with a budget and team that large working on it. Accel world felt rushed but the actual connections with the characters and the story in general were much better in my opinion.

HanaKana as a NekoMimi, fucking gold; all the overtly sexual petting, oh jeez. This show is the ultimate guilty pleasure.
>> ARTICLE
I think my favorite is Brioche so far. Kind of a toss up, since I'm kind of a sucker for lolis.
>> ARTICLE
Casual watcher here. Thanks, that was pretty useful. I'll be watching JoJo and Durarara, and see how they handle Death Parade (Death Billiards was good).

Is Aldnoah.Zero season 1 something worth watching? Internet "Word of mouth" makes it seem pretty bland and clich, is it a character driven anime or plot-driven? (I've been spoiled of a major event from the last episode) 

I'd like to ask the same thing about Tokyo Ghoul season 1 (didn't watch because of the horrendous censorship, heard the blu-rays removes it) is it worth watching? (don't answer with just a "yes" or "no" and avoid spoilers)
>> ARTICLE
Aldnoah Zero is one of the most entertaining shows out this year. The show itself suffers from weak characters, bad writing, bad pacing, and a formulaic "enemy of the episode" plotline. With all of that, its hard to say that I didn't enjoy Aldnoah. On a pure enjoyment level, I'm sure I'd put it around a 7/10 for the super well executed fights (most of them anyway). The music is for the most part very good.

Tokyo Ghoul

The censoring is at its worst in the first few episodes. It gets WAY better in the later half and one of the scenes even worked *better* with the censoring. The reason is mostly because Pierrot decided to edit out/change the really fuckn gory scenes in the manga which they should've done from the start. I'd definitely watch it; the op is quite possibly my GOAT of all time, pretty and vivid color scheme, and its nigh impossible to butcher the manga to mediocrity. The anime suffered from pacing issues and writing issues like Aldnoah, but enjoyment was pretty high as well. 
>> ARTICLE
No problem! 

Keep in mind as you read this post that I'm really easy to please when it comes to anime. 

> Is Aldnoah.Zero season 1 something worth watching? Internet "Word of mouth" makes it seem pretty bland and clich, is it a character driven anime or plot-driven? (I've been spoiled of a major event from the last episode)

I liked Aldnoah Zero. It was plot-driven. It wasn't the best, there were some times that I didn't really like something that happened. But the ending of season 1 was awesome and I'm excited to see where they take it.

>I'd like to ask the same thing about Tokyo Ghoul season 1 (didn't watch because of the horrendous censorship, heard the blu-rays removes it) is it worth watching? (don't answer with just a "yes" or "no" and avoid spoilers)

Tokyo Ghoul was pretty cool. A great concept that was done ok, but could have been done much better. Again, the last episode made it good enough for me to want to watch the next season.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I'll try watching an episode or two of both and decide whether to continue or not.
>> ARTICLE
No problem! Also, I just watched Death Billiards and it was awesome. I'm excited for Death Parade now.

These are the post that i love the most!

Arigatou for your effort!

Haha, no problem!

Thanks for the list!

I'm glad Crunchyroll has both Durarara!! x2 as well as Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata. But I hope they'll end up with Absolute Duo and a few others I want ted try out too. I'll be getting my Tokyo Ghoul and Death Parade elsewhere.

I could see Death Parade being popular enough to get both Funimation and CR. 

But yeah, I'm sure CR will get a lot of these as they always do.

[This piques my interest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tq2vyuUGOs), I've heard about it but know nothing, do I need to watch/read something beforehand?

Every time I see it I think it's supposed to be Gundam SEED.
>> ARTICLE
I believe the two series either have the same character designer or the same mech designer.
>> ARTICLE
Character designer, definitely.
>> ARTICLE
It's a sequel to Soukyuu no Fafner, it's a *very* story and plot driven anime, so I definitely will suggest watching season 1 and the movie first. You won't be disappointed, it may *look* like Gundam Seed, but the story, character development and plot are leagues better. Most people here probably haven't seen it because it's quite old, but at the time of release ten years ago it has quite a huge fanbase among mecha fans.
>> ARTICLE
I've only heard bad things about Gundam SEED but I think that only the character designer is the same, who also did Majestic Prince I believe.

I did check it and am considering catching up so I can watch this season since I have plenty of free time this next week.
>> ARTICLE
I actually have no idea, but there are a bunch of 'prequels' listed on MAL. 

I usually watch things in the order they came out unless there's something that's overwhelmingly better another way. For Fafner, the first thing in this series anime-wise appears to be [this](http://myanimelist.net/anime/75/Soukyuu_no_Fafner:_Dead_Aggressor)
>> ARTICLE
Any chance you could add genres from MAL to each anime in the list? While they aren't always that accurate, they can be useful when taking a quick look through the list.

Anyway, thanks for making this.
>> ARTICLE
I would, but it would put me over the character count I think. Maybe I can fit it in somewhere.

Added genres!

Thank you :)

It's the only day I don't have anything to watch. I'm normally really picky about what I watch (watched 3 anime series fall 2014 but put 1 of them to the on hold list) but I have about 10 anime I plan on watching this season.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I didn't notice that until right now, only one show. 
>> ARTICLE
>I'm actually not sure this is coming out in this season. 

It's February 1, as the current running one ends a week before. It makes sense you wouldn't exactly have the exact date though, unless you follow Precure at all. 

The only trailers for it usually, are the ones following episodes of the current run(From about the late 30's I think.)

It's weird because the website I got these from didn't have the date. I'll update when I get to a computer, thanks.

No worries, it happens. Great list by the way!

Thanks for the list again this season. It was superior to the one I posted last season and now you seem to have perfected it.

Well, I'm sure you saw my comment with all of the streaming sites for each show. I'll be updating that as soon as Crunchyroll makes an announcement. If no one else has it, it'll almost definitely be on there.

I'm not sure when they're starting their announcements :3

Ninja? edit: if you want to check for yourself, check the bottom of [this page](http://www.crunchyroll.com/lineup) every once in a while. It'll show you their simulcast lineup once they announce anything. Hopefully it's soon!

Alright, thanks.

Not sure if you saw, but they announced they will be streaming it, but it's not going to be in many regions. Check it out to see if you can get it in yours!

Not the US, though?

Yeah, they're not streaming it in the US :/ must be taken by someone else

After looking around, it looks like Funimation picked it up before Crunchyroll.

I should have paid more attention to Funi, it seems like they're getting awesome simulcasts this season.

I don't know what else I was expecting

Well I was expecting more than just 22k that's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Answers for this in a post i made below.
>> ARTICLE
Not really you just mention that the series as a whole has sold well, that's common knowledge and doesn't really address the fact that these really are rather disappointing sales overall for an Evangelion BD boxset.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just guessing but there could be a range of factors involved, BD's being too expensive or all of them sold out and have to wait to get new stocks. We'll have to see how it performs next week.
>> ARTICLE
They were pretty cheap as far as Boxsets usually go really, though I think they did go out of stock on amazon for a time.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if 38,000 yen is cheap.
>> ARTICLE
38,000 yen for the entire 26 episode TV series + EoE + Death and Rebirth in comparison to let's say the first BD box for Unlimited Blade Works which was somewhere around 39,000 yen for only 13 episodes...Yeah I'd say it's pretty cheap.
>> ARTICLE
in other news; its expensive... but by japanese standards, which are insane, prices for that bd are arguably okayish.
>> ARTICLE
Also note that Shimoneta V1 has been released which means it sold less than 2,211 BDs and 763 DvDs.
>> ARTICLE

Hopefully those numbers rise ^^like ^^Okuma's ^^banana

**Final Volume Anime BD Sales and Other Data**

Shirobako Vol 8, sells 13,016 BD's. Series average: 15,262. Should end at 15.4-15.5k.

Kancolle Vol 6, sells 10908 BD's. Series average: 17,493, should end around 17.9k.

Gundam: G no Reconguista  v9, sells 6,300 BDs,. Series average: 8,545, should end around 8.6-8.7k.

Dog Days Season 3 Vol 6, sells 3491, total 4,429. Series average: 5,215. Should end around 5.3k. Down from 8.2k Season 1 and 8.3k Season 2.

Shinmai Maou no Testament Vol 6, sells 3101, total 3,935. Series average: 5,061, Should end around 5.1-5.2k.

**Box Sets**



The Evangelion Box Set sells 22,775 BD's. Although this is lower than what people have been predicting, it's still a lot . Given MSRP on the BD's, it places #5 nyen. It has a shot of becming the third to hit 1 Billion sales after Haruhi and all of Gintama. Gundam Seed around there too with 997 Million. Evangelion has also sold around 60K in re-releases before this one.

Including recent sales, this puts the reported franchise total at 197,453, it might pass 200K in the end. Evangelion is a class on its own, the only other anime to pass 100k is Bakemonogatari and its still lagging behind at 112K, Third would be SEED Destiny at 93K, could pass 100K if given a re release. However all this is reported sales, if real data is available, both SEED seasons could, Madoka Magica, Haruhi and Code Geass could've also passed 100K.
>> ARTICLE
>Evangelion is a class on its own, the only other anime to pass 100k is Bakemonogatari and its still lagging behind at 112K

holy fuck
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure that's not strictly true. The World of Golden Eggs had breached 100k by a wide margin last I looked.
>> ARTICLE
Well this list is mostly talking about BD sales, it passed 100k in DVD sales though.
>> ARTICLE
Except the part of your post he's originally quoting has nothing to do with BD sales but just sales in general, Evangelion hasn't sold over 100k BDs after all.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, sorry wrong info. I don't know why it isn't included then.
>> ARTICLE
I've found it's not included on several sales charts that I've come across from time to time, I partly want to believe that's because nobody wants to admit such a thing is one of the most highest selling anime of,  well....ever

What's wrong with it ?

Oregiaru Vol 3 sold 8,908 copies, I guess that's a good number. Let's hope they will invest in a short OVA series or a Movie in the future.

Nice seeing Tesagure getting some love. 

Great numbers for Kinmoza and Show by Rock. 

I'm surprised that Kancolle has sold that much despite how harshly it was received in Japan, judging from some of the comments it got after S1's  finale. 
>> ARTICLE
**Well shit almost every new volume was overestimated.**

Charlotte: was 33-39% over estimated, the only summer show to go unscathed.

Overlord: This is a huge upset, 52-63% overestimated. People were projecting this to hit 10k.

To Love Ru Darkness: This was also overestimated 59-63%.

Gangsta: 28-37% overestimated .

Gakkou Gurashi: 47-50% overestimated,the manga had done really well.

This week is an absolute battlefield, its getting ridiculous now, usually this much is rare but this week is filled with them.
>> ARTICLE
It pisses me off that Charlotte of all things is the only one doing well. 
>> ARTICLE
Basically all 25/09 sales become "overesitmated".  
Charlotte, who was sold on 23/09, didn't get affected.

I love how the the top ten illustrates everything you need to know about anime. There's a semi-educational Engrish sketch show, a show about two rabbits in a Soviet prison, an epic space opera, a show about giant robots that fucks with your head, a show about magical school girls that fucks with your head, and a high school romcom featuring ghosts, gods, titties and wordplay. 

Anime gives you everything you need to laugh, to cry and to curl up in a little ball and wonder just what it is we're all doing here in the first place.

And to top it off you get thirty minutes of a guy getting his little sister off with a toothbrush.   
>> ARTICLE
Nah, the Best Anime Ever is way below the top 10.  The anime world needs to get over its emo streak.

EDITED to remove spoilers.  Point is, people, everything you need to know about life, you'll learn from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
>> ARTICLE
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one of my three favourite anime, but I wouldn't call it perfect. It has a few problems (mainly the Yoko episode), and it's definitely not for everyone. It is a very good and enjoyable anime otherwise though.

That show's definitely not for everyone. I personally found it extremely corny and too ridiculous. I probably would've loved it at 15-16, but as a 20 year old, I really didn't like it.

Puella Magi Madoka Magica

Which one is the "epic space opera"? I always took that to mean Legend of the Galactic Heroes, but that's not on this list? I watched Seed and Seed Destiny so long ago, I can't remember if it was an epic space opera comparable to LotGH.

> Which one is the "epic space opera"?

He was referring to GSD.

No, but then again, nothing is comparable to LotGH, it's been near the top on anidb since the beginning.

That's not a skit show, it's not even close.

It's got a long running story to it that's still continuing today.

I implore you to check it out yourself if you have the time, I'm a long time fan of Rooster Teeth so feel free to think of me as just another fan boy if you like.

I guess I phrased it poorly, I mean it was slow going.

And I was sorta pushed in to it by a friend of mine long a go.

It was'nt until recently after becoming a huge fan of Achievement Hunter and the like that I thought I'd give it another go, and I adored it.

Also listening to the Rooster Teeth podcast a lot I got to really know the different members sense of humour.

A taste of things to come so to speak. 

My apologies for any confusion, I doubt it's not something other people have'nt done and thought before though for other shows.

Out of curiosity did you ever experience anything like that?
For shows that you enjoyed I mean.

Sorry for my stupidity, but I'm not sure I fully understand this list. Could someone help me understand this? For example, is this list of lifetime sales of these titles, and do sales reflect what was sold internationally... or what was sold domestically in Japan? Also, what is the source of this information? Lastly, how do I read this list using the information at the top of the page? (Considering there are no ranking...Speaking of which, how do I tell those rankings? >.>)

Appreciate the help in advance. Again, sorry if I'm just being stupid, but I'm just interested in this information is all. I want to try to understand it the best I can.
>> ARTICLE
Average BD/DVD per volume sold domestically in Japan, which is where everything matters. Also it's based on Oricon data which isn't 100% accurate, and then it's based on the volume releases which means it doesn't account for boxset releases afterwards. But it's fair to say that every title on the list can be considered a massive success to some degree.
>> ARTICLE
List doesn't factor in merchandise, which imo is a metric we should def look at as well.

Like the gundam series. They prob make more money in merchandises than from the anime
>> ARTICLE
We look at disk sales because it's the only dataset readily available to the public.  What you want simply isn't available outside of the [odd press releases](http://wiki.fdiary.net/animesales/?%BB%D4%BE%EC%B5%AC%CC%CF%A1%A6%C1%ED%C7%E4%BE%E5) and unreliable estimates by [CharaBizData](https://www.charabiz.com/) (research group). 
>> ARTICLE
I know. I'm simply just stating there are far more factors into a series success outside of disk sales.

Precure probably doesn't sold that many disks relative to its time slot, but massively makes up for them through merchandise that not many other series could achieve.
>> ARTICLE
So... Evangelion should be in the first 3 places. If it exist there is an evagelion merchan edition of it. 
>> ARTICLE
Eva's merchandising dollars pale in comparison to the likes of Pokemon, One Piece, or even Pretty Cure ([source](http://wiki.fdiary.net/animesales/?%BB%D4%BE%EC%B5%AC%CC%CF%A1%A6%C1%ED%C7%E4%BE%E5)).

So how is Girls and Panzer? I've heard about it a few times but to be honest I didn't think it sounded very interesting. Anyone here that has seen it that can tell me his opinion on it?
>> ARTICLE
The first episode does a great job world building. The characters are tropish, but cute.

If not seeing much practice in K-On, an anime about music that doesn't involve playing much music, bothered you- be prepared to be irked that they take the easy way out, and never show them learning or getting better.

There is next to zero character development, which is unforunate. They could have really slowed down the pace of the show to make it more interesting from the main character's perspective. 

The show starts with a massive amount of annoying exposition. This could lead you to turn off the show.

The battle scenes are quite good both in design and execution. 

Definitely a short turn-your-brain-off and have fun anime. Maybe just put it on a backlist, for when you're bored?
>> ARTICLE
No, don't listen to this guy.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for having an opinion.
>> ARTICLE
It's an earnest underdog sports story of cute girls driving/commanding historical tanks in an inter-school tournament. It has an absurd setting but plays it totally straight, tankery really is a popular all-girls sport and you just have to accept that. The rest of the show is either friends hanging out together, planning for tank battles, or the genuinely exciting tank battles themselves. If you're into World of Tanks or historical tanks, it's an absolute must, but even if you're not (like me) it's still absolutely endearing.

Oh, and it doesn't have pandering fanservice, which is a pleasant change. Yes, the character designs are quite "mo", but you won't catch a single glimpse up any skirts nor any breast-size jokes. About the only scenes a westerner would consider questionable involve communal bathing, and there's like... two of such scenes in the entire show, which are both literally and metaphorically clean unless you find bare shoulders and backs *too lewd*.

Honestly, give the first two episodes a spin and see what you think.
>> ARTICLE
i do think you see miho's butt in one of the bathing scenes but taken in context it's definitely not pandering.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds alright, guess I'll give it a try soon.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, and it has some amazing "camera" work throughout.
>> ARTICLE
it's fucking great.  it takes the utterly ridiculous premise of "tankwando" as a feminine art and runs all the way to the finish line with it.  the main character is a "thinker" - she bucks tradition and comes up with her own way of doing things (like lelouch or light) in order to succeed.  on top of that, there are **32** characters in the main cast and every one of them is uinique.

it's 12 episodes and 2 recap episodes (5.5 you can skip, 10.5 you should watch), and every time the girls have a tank fight, there's a good reason to get invested.  there are some side stories but they aren't made the focus; rather they're used to bring the characters themselves into focus.  it's really a mastefully done, triumphant, jubilant and heartwarming series.  and it's short enough to marathon in a day if you really can't pace yourself (like me).  go watch it.
>> ARTICLE
>tankwando

Tank-fu, Tankery, and ***[PANZERFAHREN](http://commiesubs.com/your-face-when-we-won-da-panzer-vor/)*** are acceptable substitutes. Tankery is my go-to one for talking about the show, but when it comes to actually watching Madchen und Panzer, only glorious Commie subs are accepted.
>> ARTICLE
i got tankwando from the deadfish sub of OVA 2...  i watched the show with horriblesubs.  aren't horriblesubs/commie both just ripped crunchyroll?
>> ARTICLE
Horrible's crunchy. Commie does half crunchy half other stuff - and in the case of Girls und Panzer, they put their own fantastic spin on it. To not ruin the surprise for anyone else: [Commie GuP](/s "is unique because it uses gratuitous German to replace common phrases - 'Arigatou' (thank you) is subbed as 'Danke', 'Hai!' (yes) with 'Ja!' or 'Jawohl' etc. - it forces a strange trilingualism, the ability to hear Japanese, read German, and understand in English. Since it's pretty much only used for set phrases anyone who's been watching anime for a year or more could recognize, and the German translations should be similarly familiar to anyone with even a cursory knowledge, it's not inconvenient, and often humorous.")
>> ARTICLE
Oh that is xlnt. If my data cap were more forgiving, I would definitely re download for that. 
>> ARTICLE
>there are 32 characters in the main cast

That worries me a bit, doesn't a lot of characters mean that each individual character loses a lot of depth?

Apart from that the show definitely sounds interesting, I'll be sure to give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
Some of the tank crews get grouped to the point that you could class them as "one character". This includes the First Years and the Disciplinary Committee - if you watch closely you'll notice they each have their unique points, but in terms of narrative, they're basically 'herded' together and work together to have an individual's worth of impact. It's appropriate, given the collaborative nature of operating a tank.
>> ARTICLE
you'll actually be very surprised.  

actually, i don't think the words are good enough to describe the cast heirarchy.  there's one girl who is obviously the "main character", and there are the girls in her tank who all get backstoried, and then there are the rest of the girls on the tankery team who are all unique and well-characterized but don't get much time spent on their backstories.  they're all "main cast".  

then there's the MC's tank team's families, and the team's opponents, who i would say make up the supporting cast.
>> ARTICLE
Its more of a sports anime to be quite honest. There is your typical underdog team and other sports tropes. Except the sport in this anime is tank paintball. And the tanks are so very detailed and lots of historical Easter eggs thrown in.

Now go watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's a moe slice of life series pretending to be a sports anime, the whole Sensha-do is too ridiculous and the girls don't take it seriously enough for it to be considered a sport. It's cute but also pretty silly, and also hidden right wing propaganda that more people should be disgusted about.  
>> ARTICLE
the only right wing part about the show I find meh is in the OVAs and that's because of the use of the rising sun flag (which admittedly it's not just in anime Japan has a poor record of). 

So what on earth are you on about?  
>> ARTICLE
Also in the OVAs, they gloat about how Japan has the best tanks in the world.
>> ARTICLE
That too. 

Imma hazard a guess and maybe the person is talking about how there was that JSDF video narrated by Yukari. I honestly cannot think of anything else 
>> ARTICLE
Yea I think so, mentioned how the Type 89 has some revolutionary design feature. 
>> ARTICLE
>Hidden right wing propaganda....

Lol wut...

They at most reference the actions of Meiji/Taisho era Japan (the whole Yuki no Shingun part is the only thing I can think up) who's hands may not be completely clean, but are saints compared to what actually happened during the war. 

Not to mention prior to the 2nd World War, the IJA and IJN were rather civilized (given proper incentive of course, i.e. sucking up to the Western powers).

I would buy Girls under Panzer to add to my collection, but I'd have to get it through Sentai and they removed the Pravda song since they couldn't get the copyright. Honestly that's what initially got me to watch that show in the first place.

GuP is probably one of the only series I would considering importing other than an immaculate adaptation of the Muv Luv Trilogy.

That's something done on the Japanese side as evidenced by the difference in animation timing/editing. It's likely something done for the international masters, which is something we can't blame Sentai on (for once).

I know it's not Sentai's fault. They couldn't get the copyright so there is nothing they can do about it. It's a shame, though, since that insert song is pretty awesome.

Apparently the World of Golden Eggs is an american style cartoon, with 15-minute episodes. It's a children's anime and also is priced more normally (only $55 per season, instead of $300) - maybe that's why it has so many sales. 
[Amazon JP link](http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%87%E3%83%B3%E3%82%A8%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B9-World-GOLDEN-%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%83%B31-DVD%E3%83%9C%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9/dp/B0019JJ4NU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1390438781&sr=8-1&keywords=The+World+of+GOLDEN+EGGS)

Wild Card

This is specifically for the people that didn't see the nomination thread. Basically, I'll be doing this for the rest of my threads. Each thread, I will have a maximum number of wild cards. For this one it is 10. The top 10 upvoted anime will get a second chance and be in the final vote which will be held sometime after the end of the other polls, which is Wednesday, February 4. I'll probably end up posting it the 7th or the 8th.
TL;DR, if you want anime added, comment them here.

[Kekkai Sensen](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24439/Kekkai_Sensen)

Any anime that are upvoted less than this comment will NOT get into the competition with the wild card.
Just for extra clarity: if this gets the same amount of points as an anime, the anime is allowed in still. If the anime comment has more or the same amount of points but is still 'under' this comment, they're still allowed in.

How was it "bad"? It was pretty, had some nice characters, a kinda unique setting and some pretty welldone action scenes. It was a bit childish sure, but I don't think it was bad...
>> ARTICLE
The pacing was really bad, for starters. All the arcs were paced poorly. The earlier episodes were just rushed, and didn't allow you to form any sort of connection to the characters. The later arcs were drawn out and dragged on to unreasonable lengths.

The characters are some of the worst I've seen. Obviously this was to cater towards a young audience, but that's no excuse for having poorly written backstories, and shocking character exposition. Alibaba is probably the character I hate the most (save Kirito). He was written to be juvenile and immature, as were most of the characters, which honestly reflects quite poorly on the writers.

The plot was not well thought out, and was unsatisfying, especially compared to the superior Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Edit: Shouldn't Neko:Black be on this list? It's sold 60k+ last I checked.

Edit 2: Nevermind, it counts as a Special. Kinda crazy, though, if you count it, the combined -monogatari is almost 200,000. 
>> ARTICLE
It shouldn't count as a special, it aired on TV first
>> ARTICLE
I agree. I think it also aired on Nico at the same time? So I guess it's both. Maybe the difference is that it wasn't made for a specific time slot.
>> ARTICLE
>the combined -monogatari is almost 200,000. 
Remember that these are only average volume sales, not total sales. The sales per season  of monogatari have been decreasing over time.

Some interesting things I noticed:

For how much love Steins;Gate gets here, it's pretty low on that list - just beating out Chuu2, which at 15k is more than I was expecting. Also surprised to see Cowboy Bebop so low. Does that include US Sales?

I'm glad to see Love Live! and GuP up there. Someone already mentioned F/SN at 26k. I liked it. I'm glad it's up there.

Clannad > Clannad: After Story; lel. 

I know people like Bakemonogatari, but I'm surprised at a mammoth 78k. Is there a reason for that? Is it just that good? I've got it, I'm gonna watch it now.

*monogatari and Urobuchi slaughter. Holy cow.

It's cool to see how well the data fit a curve. http://i.imgur.com/LQdIW3s.jpg

10 of KyoAni's 18 TV series make that list.
>> ARTICLE
It is really good, but its high numbers have always confused me as well. To me, it doesn't really have the features some of these other shows on the list have, what you could think of as universal appeal. Maybe its uniqueness makes it stand out. Maybe the LN was insanely popular anyways, so it already had a solid fanbase. I'm curious to know.

Panzer rode that massive craze wagon in Japan. I'm shocked, i knew they liked it over there..... but i didn't think it was that big.

>> ARTICLE
I have to wonder if this ends up being weighted toward older anime.  Every year more people use streaming services and buy fewer DVDs.
>> ARTICLE
Don't have time to run the numbers but it looks to me like it is weighted to series that are more than a couple of years old but in the last decade. Almost with out exception all of the shows pre 2000 are considered classics and still have followings to this day, but after about the 2006 mark you start to see shows that while reasonable popular may be able to be characterized as second tier for their season.

For example Ookiku Furikabutte while I love the show, is not in almost anyway more important or popular than Sailor Moon. I think it just happened to air in a time where Dvds where sold as the original version of the show as opposed to a re-release of a title that collectors may have had on LD or VHS.

seeing figures like 30,000 units sold seems quite odd to me and an incredibly low amount of profit, are these supposed to be the mount its sold in its lifetime or what? 
>> ARTICLE
This is the average number sold of each volume, with volumes generally being 2-3 eps. 30000 average volumes is actually pretty good as BDs and DVDs are extremely expensive in Japan, so even average sales of ~5k can generally recoup costs.
>> ARTICLE
How does an anime like The World of Golden Eggs even get that much sales? 

Furthermore, how does this go for more than $10 with what seems to be a low budget web series?

Probably tells you just how insanely niche anime is in Japan.

With the gap between Monogatari S2 and Attack on Titans closing, what's the chance of Monogatari taking over as the best selling series of 2013?
>> ARTICLE
It probably won't take over, unless Titan crashes. If I understand analysts correctly, Monogatari will be extremely consistent, i.e. it will probably hover around pretty much the same number until the end.

However, and on that note, it's not guaranteed that Titan will be consistent. If everyone suddenly loses interest in it, the average may drop enough to allow Monogatari to take over, but that's very unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
It's the other way round, Monogatari will be extremely inconsistent sales wise. Kabukimonogatari will outsell Nekomonogatari: Shiro by a huge margin but Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari are set to sell not that well. So Monogatari will almost certainly outsell Titan temporarily when the Kabukimonogatari sale results are out, but in the end the numbers will probably be not that far from its current numbers.
>> ARTICLE
Your analysis got me curious, so I did a little digging and compiled the data and chart to comparing the two.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ajj_IfkmgvF0dEdXS1JXUG5qUlFVSG5XdVNWN3h6QWc&gid=10

Looks like your analysis is mostly on the mark.  The biggest issue hurting Monogatari's chance of a late come-back is the lack of a longtail (BD Multipler Monogatari 1.1 vs SnK 1.4).  There's a good chance that Monogatari S2 will end up winning the BD average, but its lack of DVD sales dooms any chance for the overall BD+DVD average.
>> ARTICLE
>but Onimonogatari and Koimonogatari are set to sell not that well

This is a case where the stalker is unreliable.  I know for at least one of the arcs, their volumes were at rank 2/3 during their first week instead of 1/2 because there was something else high profile that went up for pre-order around the same time they went up.  There's a huge difference between consistently 2nd and consistently first for a week points-wise, but it doesn't necessarily means the sales were that different if at all.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, thanks for the correction.

I should've remembered that the fact that it's split into arcs will cause some volumes to be more popular. I just went with the fact that v1 seemed to be extremely well predicted.
>> ARTICLE
Some surprises for me: I enjoyed Bakemonogatari but didn't expect it to be so high up on the list. When I think about it it sorta makes sense. It's one of the few harem shows that successfully convinces the viewer that the protagonist is justified in having an entourage of girls. Also, the dialogue sounds intelligent. Bascially it's wish fulfillment for a lot of otaku.

I didn't expect Madoka to be so high up either, but I guess it's due to Urobutcher's stellar writing. And, other than Nanoha, there's really no other show like it. It really filled a subgenre void.

Also, I thought Kyoani's powerhouse shows would be higher up on the list... which got me thinking, how would these shows fare if you included non-dvd sales like figurines?

Toshokan Sensou made it onto the list? I thought the show was charming but not compelling enough to rake in sales. Perhaps the work of the Fujoshi legion?

And finally, why is Umi ga Kikoeru on this list? Did it first air on TV despite being a Ghibli movie?

Anyway, glad to see Hataraku and SNAFU made it on from this season.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka would probably crush everybody (late-night) if we include figurines and other goodies. It even has its own monthly magazine/anthology where popular artists draws their fanfics/stories. Vol 11 just came out this year.

Latest figures for Madoka series was $400 million in 2012. Should easily top $600 million+ with the movie this year and goods that comes with it.

Sorry, that premiered in 2014 so it's not eligible.

The poster deleted it, but if the suggestion was Yona, then I think there might a problem here: the OP2 for Yona did not air until 2015, so it was never a candidate for the 2014 poll (or was it, after just a few weeks?).  I thought Yona's OP2 was fantastic and should be top ~4.  If it was available for the 2014 poll then w/e.  Otherwise I think the rules need to be tweaked.

I don't think it was Yona, because I have no idea when that aired and I would only say something like that if I was confident about it.

No, it was Parasyte. I remember for sure now. That only had the one OP from beginning to end, and since it started in 2014, it's not eligible even if airing episodes used it in 2015.

Well, all of them on /r/animethemes are shortened links I think, which I know are banned just for being shortened links in places. Idk.

This is my favorite of the season.  nano.RIPE is great

"OP" is music + video as part of the show, so:

1. Kekkai Sensen.  This OP is fantastic in every way, IMO.  One of the few OPs I've ever watched more than a handful of times.  The music matches the mood of the show perfectly, spins up hype, and the visuals are fantastic and set up the show so well.
2. FSN UBW2.  Great music, great visuals.  It really sets the bar for top tier.
3. There are many other good OPs I thought were just about as good as each other for different reasons.  I didn't see a clear winner out of any of them, so I'll throw them all in here: Death Parade (overall), Noragami Aragoto (overall), Gundam IBO (music), Gangsta (unique styles and composition), Monmusu (uncommonly unique integration with the show / VAs).  Oh, also OPM for its pure hype.
>> ARTICLE
> spins up hype

Looking at the OP I can confirm that this is literally true
>> ARTICLE
Bump of Chicken for the win
>> ARTICLE
PIN PON!!!
>> ARTICLE
JoJo quite literally has the best OP of all time for me. The ammount of details put into it are insane.  And the song itself is hype incarnate. 
>> ARTICLE
Kuchizuke Diamond for me, Yamada-kun's OP
>> ARTICLE
Although there were a lot of fantastic OPs this years have to give it to Gakkou Gurashi. That OP was not only catchy, but it exemplified the use of foreshadowing and changed along with the show.
>> ARTICLE
One of my vote has to go to Decent Black, I had this song on repeat and we only got to hear it in one episode. I still think it was epic and helped a lot in establishing Ougi as an important character.
>> ARTICLE
i think ougi was stablished as an important character since her introduction in shinobu time even if she did nothing on that arc.

its one of the most powerful character introductions i have seen and she only talked a little about something trivial
>> ARTICLE
Are there no Gintama OPs or am I missing something? :(
>> ARTICLE
besides the current one (which is 2016 so out of question), only DAYxDAY was good enough to be OP of the year material imo
>> ARTICLE
[Kuchizuke Diamond](https://d.maxfile.ro/ifsjfqqzon.webm) from [Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo]( http://myanimelist.net/anime/28677) is my choice but hell there were a **TON** of good OPs. 

It isn't as flashy as most of these OPs but I feel like Yamada-kun's OP does it's job of emulating the tone of the anime while being simple yet managing to tell the viewers the personality of every single character shown.
>> ARTICLE
Speed to Masatsu is probably the actual answer to best OP last year, but Subete ga F ni Naru or JoJo winning wouldn't be a travesty either.
>> ARTICLE
EVERYBODY, PUT YOUR HANDS UP
>> ARTICLE
You have a typo in the Punch Line link (extra characters at the end).
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, should be fixed now 
>> ARTICLE
While the actual anime was garbage, Asterisk War's OP was fantastic, even the animation. I'm surprised it's not on this list. 
>> ARTICLE
Guess no one nominated it. It's [not the only fantastic OP that no one nominated](http://b.1339.cf/jkzqxvo.webm)

Oh men, what a year. I'll vote for the dark horse and cross fingers.

All hail amazarashi, best song of 2015.

The max file links have all died, and the 1339 are blocked by my company's forward proxy due to malware.

Maybe maxfile is also blocked by your company's proxy because I just gathered all the links this morning and the first 3 I tried still worked.

They worked for me for awhile.  I watched everything before the Bump of Chicken one.  The ones before Bump of Chicken still work too.

Why is it not limited to one song?

Because there's a lot of choices and a lot of them are getting through, so I decided to open it up a bit. The finals will only have the option to select one

I know it's going to win but the One Piece OP is actually really good. Great song and well animated
>> ARTICLE
Kyoran hey kids, Flyers, Hero, Insight, and Day you laugh (I know Durarara isn't nominated but it should have been)
>> ARTICLE
Subete ga F ni naru wasn't the best show, but I'll be damned if it wasn't one of the best OPs I have ever seen. I actually went back to the beginning and watched it twice before every episode.

Damn too many good OPs to choose from, but I'm gonna have to pick Flyers cause of that great juxtaposition.

Top of list seems dominated by recent releases and franchises, hm.

Also, had to look up The World of Golden Eggs, since this was my first time hearing of it.

Definitely interesting.

>Top of list seems dominated by recent releases and franchises, hm.

That struck me as odd at first too, but then I realized that as DVDs became popular, cheaper to make, and cheaper to buy, home video sales went up a lot.

>(2006) *26,047 Fate/Stay Night [Deen]

If Deens shitty adaption did that well I'm definitely interested in seeing how Unfotables adaption goes and whether or not it beats Fate/Zeros sales.
>> ARTICLE
Read the list in OP

> (2011) *52,133 Fate/Zero [ufotable]

> (2012) *45,804 Fate/Zero 2nd season [ufotable]


>> ARTICLE
The point I was trying to make was that I'm interested in seeing if the recently announced Unfotable Fate/Stay Night remake ends up selling more than Fate/Zero
>> ARTICLE
Huh, with all the hype that Haruhi got in 2006, I would've expected much higher sales. Did it all go into merchandizing?
>> ARTICLE
An average of 42K is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly didnt expect to see Bakemonogatari so high up. I knew it well recieved but whoa. Thats amazing.

I'm happy to see Hataraku Maou Sama doing well.
>> ARTICLE
When you consider that Nisemonogatari is also up there at 60k, and the Neko OVAs did really well too, the Monogatari series is actually a powerhouse selling series. I'm looking forward to hearing how the first volume of Season Season did, which released recently. 

And then you consider that Madoka is up there, and the movies did really well, it shows that Shaft and Shinbou might be considered the most successful anime team on the market currently. 

>> ARTICLE
I actually saw the sales for Nise before I'd ever seen Bake so I just assumed that Nise did better than Bake and never bothered to check just how well Bakemonogatari actually did.

How well did Neko do? Also Neko wasn't an OVA, it was a TV special. I think they aired all four episodes in one night and simulcasted them as well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know it was a TV special. It tops the list at 56k. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Love Live outsold Jojo, an immensely popular franchise with a lot of content and history behind it. Though I guess it's not completely fair to compare the two since Jojo had 2 adaptations, with a third coming soon (with the third being the most popular). But I guess that just goes to show you the power of moe idols.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I can't wait to see the numbers after Part 3 comes out since it's what they live by over there.
>> ARTICLE
What the heck is "The World of Golden Eggs" lol, looks like a children's show which makes sense. 
On the list I'm surprised that SAO *only* sold 35k, thought it was more popular than that. 

SnK no surprise it's selling big. 

Madoka somewhat of a surprise I knew it was popular but not quite 71k popular.

I thought Haruhi would be near the top of the list but only 42k.

Wonder what it would take for a series to break 100k these days, would have to be immensely popular and/or have a lot of volumes.
>> ARTICLE
>What the heck is "The World of Golden Eggs" lol, looks like a children's show which makes sense. 

It's not. It's an adult short (one of the episodes revolved around 2 teens fucking in the bushes at school). Very much like Robot Chicken's story style but there are no cultural jokes. Just plain datsuryoku-kei comedy. Occasionally there is a live-action cooking segment reminiscent of the one from Tentai Senshi Sunred. 

It aired on MTV in Japan so think about American MTV cartoons and that should give you an easier picture.



>> ARTICLE
Why am i not surprised?
>> ARTICLE
Fate series sucks anyway. I don't get how someone from the West can stomach the horribly interpreted Western themes.

I'm sorry, I know it's dickish to hate on things, but I can only take so much inundation of this show's praises.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how much experience you have with the fate series, but having played the visual novels I can safely say I have no idea what "western themes" you are talking about. If you are just talking about pulling from western legends like King Aurthur and whatnot, then 1 those are not themes, and 2 you could not be more wrong. 

But yeah the anime sucks pretty hard. Did almost nothing right.
>> ARTICLE
You're nitpicking over a word that's not even really even wrong. The interpretations at least in the anime were really shallow, as well.
>> ARTICLE
Everything in the anime was really shallow. The anime was really shallow. The VN gives character profiles to each of the servants and explains how they are affected by being summoned. Forcing them into a class alters them from their historical/mythological selves in various ways. Additionally they are strongly affected by how people remember their legend, rather than actual fact. 

They give a lot more depth and characterization to each of them, and delve more into the legends they are from.
>> ARTICLE
I see, so the problem I mentioned is probably not there in the VN.

I am new to this kind of thing, how do I interpret this ?

And why did you emphasize Card Captor Sakura ?
>> ARTICLE
Basically, this is the list of every show that has sold over 10,000 copies, which is considered the marking of a large success. 

Card Captor Sakura was highlighted because of the positioning at the bottom of the list. All the series that are moving up the list are from the last year (2012-13, anyway), except Card Captor. It was released in 1998, yet it's moved up! Very impressive!
>> ARTICLE
>(1995) 111,559 Shin Seiki Evangelion [Gainax]

HOLY SHIT
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda new here and maybe I'm missing something, but isn't it not at all surprising that evangelion is topping the list?
>> ARTICLE
no, not really, but i never really saw the amount of BD's/DVD's that Evangelion sold.

Seed Destiny's rank confuses me
>> ARTICLE
If SEED destiny was so bad, why did the Japanese eat up the BD's? checkmate.....? 
>> ARTICLE
The BDs for Destiny aren't even out yet.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, you're right. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a little confused and new to this, what does average mean exactly? Are these numbers the total sales since the shows came out?  Also how come One Piece and Naruto Arent up there, but Bleach.

, I did a little research, and as I understand it now, These # are average sales per year per volume since the respective vol. Came out, right?   (So, f.e. This means that each Evangelion DVD/BE has sold a total amount of ~20million? Holy Shit)
>> ARTICLE
111k x 20 is two million not twenty
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, you are right, wrote that really late, sorry.
>> ARTICLE
That makes more sense, I would prefer a chart with the total amount of each anime sold.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand what is meant by "average". Is it an average over the number of years?

No idea how a few of these are so high, especially The world of Golden Eggs?!?!
>> ARTICLE
How come Sword Art Online is shown as selling almost 1,000 less than the last update, and 2,000 less than the update before that?

because over time if they dont keep selling as many units as before the average will drop
>> ARTICLE
I can pretty much write off any chances for Medaka Box S3 at this point
>> ARTICLE
Well, manga sales do matter too, but I don't know how much, if at all, they've been affected by the anime. With the case of Medaka I'm fairly certain this is a case of a split cour scenario (like TWGOK) though, but hey you never know. I gave you shit last time and it still got a second season.

I'm still crossing my finger for a third season, I'm really enjoying it so far. I need more Shiranui in my life.

Hey, my favorite shows are at the top this season.

That's cool.
>> ARTICLE
So reading all that and then looking at this chart, can I just assume that there's a ton of rage over Robotic;Notes' adaptation or was it never that popular to begin with?

And was there a definite correlation between censorship and increased BD sales like for To-Love-Ru Darkness?
>> ARTICLE
Read the text under **slight change**. Robotics;Notes has low points because it's a recent addition to the stalker chart. It still has a decent average rank, so expect it to move up in points at a decent rate
>> ARTICLE
I see what you mean; that's what I get for skimming.  So looking at both can give a fair idea of what to expect.
>> ARTICLE
> TLR: Darkness #1

Obviously they're not actually watching the show, but buying the BDs so that they can get it uncensored.

> LB! selling well

Not surprised, but it will not even match Kanon, much less AIR or Clannad, in sales. I hope that quality/sales don't drive off a cliff when we reach the dramatic parts.

> JoJo ahead of Chuunibyou

HELL YES. This is awesome.

> Hidamari's very strong showing

This makes me all kinds of happy.

> Busou Shinki edging out Psycho-Pass

This is what you get for "no moe": you get beaten by a terrible fanservice show about dolls doing cute things (of course there is actual moe in Psycho-Pass, but nevermind).

> SSY and Tempest getting really low ranks

They must be waiting to see if it'll pan out. Still a bit disappointing from Japan.
>> ARTICLE
Busou Shinki already has an established fanbase thanks to the toys/games, so that's probably why it's doing better so far. I know I've bought the OP/ED singles and preordered the character singles even though I don't have high expectations for the show now. After episode 3 I'm only watching it because I'm an established fan and other entries in the series have had decent plots.
>> ARTICLE
Surprised LB made it that high. I'm not watching it, but I haven't really heard much good about the adaptation.

Kind of interesting looking at sales in terms of the ratio of BD:DVD. Girls unf Panzer has 11:1, while Magi is at like 1:1.3.
>> ARTICLE
the anime is absolute garbage so far
>> ARTICLE
I figured that DVDs were bought only by "casuals" (josei-watching women, people watching shounens like the big 3, Magi, Gintama, etc.) because those shows always have a disproportionate number of DVD sales compared to "otaku pandering" shows, a category into which Girls und Panzer would definitely fall.
>> ARTICLE
Well I think the hype and popularity is the reason the sales are high. The adaption is decent so far. 
>> ARTICLE
Seitokai S2 hasn't even had a single episode out so far right?

Would explain the low ranking.
>> ARTICLE
Probably has more to do with the fact that it's a net anime
>> ARTICLE
Could you confirm that? I heard it was a real TV series, with a LQ "episode 0"/preview on the web?
>> ARTICLE
[Official website](http://seitokai-no-ichizon.com/onair/). It's being produced by the same company that did Ebiten so I expect it to air on TV next season.

(As for the site, normally they'd list the stations on which the show would air i.e. TBS)
>> ARTICLE
> I expect it to air on TV next season.

Thanks. I'll wait, then.

Any idea why they stream things in VHS quality in Japan? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not quite sure what the business model for net only streaming is
>> ARTICLE
It is NicoNico, they are stuck in the olden days of 480P streaming.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised Love Live outsold Idolmaster considering the Idolmaster franchise is huge. They've got games, tons of merch, spin-off anime series, etc. The popularity of idols and idol shows must be even bigger in the recent years than when Idolmaster was on sale.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably because Idolmaster is more known for the games than the anime and the anime is just a by-product of its popularity. While Love Live is a manga which means it originally has no sounds and people prefers the one with music

Just a guess of course
>> ARTICLE
Ah, I wasn't aware of the two series' history. It makes sense. I just figured it was a shift in culture and taste in Japan, but your explaination makes a lot of sense.
>> ARTICLE
Does counting VHS-era anime like Eva or dragonball even make sense?
>> ARTICLE
Well, seeing how Evangelion's Rebuild is still going on I would say yes. 
>> ARTICLE
It's the power of Nico-Nico-Niii!
>> ARTICLE
How does Queen's Blade even make it on to the list!?!?
>> ARTICLE
Durarara has like 60 some odd episodes with Shou, Ten, and Ketsu.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of shows do.  I crammed in as many episodes as I could to stay under 40, but still give the show an appropriate rating for the content.  Mushi-Shi's entry also doesn't have the full amount of stuff, but that's the point.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, it would be better if you filtered them out as well. Makes no sense for people who search for short shows to watch only half the series just because it is divided by more seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass has 50 eps, Bakuman has 75eps, Major has like 129 episodes, Monogatari has ~83, Clannad has 47, Ghost in the Shell SAC is 52+2hr movie, JoJo is 79 episodes and counting (will be 115 by time Part 4 ends).

Hellsing Ultimate is more like 30 episodes with its 1 hour runtime, same with Katanagatari and 24 eps.

> Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, Gintama, HxH, FMA:BH, Monster, DBZ, Bakuman, Code Geass, Durarara are among my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Did you read the rules I used for the list?

Half the point of the list was to remove second seasons of things from the top, because they require the time investment.  If the first season still does well then it's in the list because it's standalone, which second seasons are not.  
>> ARTICLE
But then, why would you include second seasons for some shows but not others? At the point, the 40 episode thing becomes a very arbitrary guideline.
>> ARTICLE
You're not even following your own rules m8
>> ARTICLE
> Rule 1: No anime longer than 40 episodes. Period.

Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show. 
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show.

I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point.  If people want to continue after that, that's their decision, but all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.  But that's ok.  I'm going to remake the list taking into account all this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point. If people want to continue after that, that's their decision,

truly, if this is your interpretation of your rules then your list doesn't make any sense. Everybody can continue or stop after ~40 episodes of anything (first season or not), they don't need your misguided list for that.

>  all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.

> Code Geass, Attack on Titan, Chihayafuru on the list

ok, so what you do is claiming it's enough to call something a 'first season' to make it stand alone. Because these three very clearly don't have any resolution in the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Well is certainly my fault for not explaining the purpose well.  The overarching goal was to remove incredibly long running shows, but more importantly to remove sequel bias within the context of show length.  So all these shows that are not only long, but also contain a huge score jump in the second season tend to dominate the list quite a bit. A guy a while ago made a combined season list which averaged scores, and that was awesome, but didn't necessarily remove what I feel is the heavy score bias from familiarity that plagues the top 100.   But anyway, is a moot point now. Intentions are meaningless. 
>> ARTICLE
Also Chihayafuru, Haikyuu, Mushishi, Kurono Basket, xxxHolic, Initial D, Yomamushi Pedal, Kingdom, Nodame Cantabile, Kaiji, Magi and Natsume Yuujinchouu.
>> ARTICLE
> If they rely on knowledge from previous shows, they're out. Gundam would be a good example - Gundam 00 might be fantastic (might be a bad example, I know nothing ab Gundam 00 *is* standalone. 

Gundam 00 is standalone and requires no knowledge of UC. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, figured something like that might happen.  Sorry Gundam.
>> ARTICLE
> Moribito Guardian of the Stuff

I'll admit I did chuckle a bit.
>> ARTICLE
>Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, absolutely. Except for Hyouka, all of my top 5 shows have more than 50 episodes. I also freaking love JJBA, One Piece and a lot more.

I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

Longer shows have a better chance to properly explore the setting and the characters and you can get easier attached to them as well. I also prefer slower pacing way more than to fast pacing, but that's just me.

Anyways, thanks for the work.

> I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

I was having a discussion with a buddy of mine about this.  We've both read the Wheel of Time series, which is good, but a massive time investment.  There are a lot of good, long running shows and if I'd started them at the time it would be fine, but trying to jump in now...not sure it's worth the time.

When i was new to anime, i was actually sad that there were so few long shows. I was in Post Anime Depression after FMA:B was my first proper anime(that i knew was anime and intentionally sought out), worse was it after doing HxH up to the airing episode (119 iirc.) in a week. Felt like i'd never find anything like them again, and i really haven't had a lot anime past that point be either. So long ones are good, as long as you don't get stuck in Naruto/Bleach fillers. Skip those if they don't please you, that's what i do. 

HxH probably has the best pacing imo. (Chimera arc exempt, that one was a bit slower IIRC.) To me, the first 20 episodes felt like 50, and in a positive way. For some reason, the 2 minute episode situation that a lot of good shows have didn't happen in HxH, though i'm not sure why. It's wasn't a bad thing, i enjoyed those long good paced episodes because they felt so filled. 

As a side note, to me, HxH was great from the beginning, so i understand that for those that didn't like it as much at the beginning, might have felt different about this.

Cool list! I'll have to get around to watching Rakugo sometime...

On a side note though, Gundam 00 is standalone. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the other series.

This is super helpful.  
Nice job! MAL should try and sort out their shitty list formats too.

Why not Bake + Nise + Neko?

Higurashi (when they cry) has a second season which pushes it to 50 episodes total. (+ several ovas, 6 of which counts as a third season)  
  
I guess you can see the first season only, but 90% of the plot of the first season is explained in the second season. It's a bit weird to only include the first season on the list, since the story doesn't make much sense without the second season to back it up. 

If I was to pick anime from a list like this, I would rather have all the shows included be 40 or less, including all relevant sequels. If I want a short anime, I don't want to discover later that there are actually two more seasons that weren't listed just to keep the episode count down. 

That's just my opinion though!

Ha, fear not!  I'm remaking the list so there are no shows at all that go over 26 episodes!

Awesome!

YLiA #2, OPM #3, Code Geass #4. 

I am not an anti-circlejerker against YLiA or OPM (I hate Code Geass), in fact I enjoyed both for the most part. But putting them into top 5? Hah, nope. It is actually sad to see how Ping Pong and TTGL lower than them. And by god, Berserk and Tatami Galaxy are low.

This list really saves me the trouble of watching the top stuff while having to sift through the long runners. Thanks!

I never realised how many long Anime there are in the top 100 before seeing that just removing the 40+ ones moves Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso from #14 to #2. That makes me happy.

EDIT: Also I never would have guessed to see Shokugeki no Souma that high, it's great and I don't disagree with it, I just never would have expected it to.

The fact that CG is higher on this list than CB causes my joints to hurt.

Why is this happening? The first season didn't do nearly that well.

Also, what's the show about?
>> ARTICLE
I just started watching the show this week, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I know:

Uta no Prince-Sama (Shortened to Utapri) is the best selling Otome franchise currently on the market with a total of 7 games (2-3 of them being rhythm games, the others are dating sims), Drama CDs, music CDs, manga, and other merch. 

It's about Haruka Nanami, a girl who's dream is to compose music for her favorite idol. In the games, you play as Nanami and eventually start a romance with one of the boys. There are six main male characters, all of which have their own unique styles and personalities, and a seventh is introduced officially in Season 2. Later games, you can also branch out to their rival group for more dating possibilities.

Being a female anime fan, it's refreshing to see an otome game get it's own series and with all of the harem animes around, (which sure, I still love those too) it's a nice change of pace. I think the series can be summed up as female fanservice. The characters are relatively well developed, but it's entirely a girl's fantasy anime. 

I could be mistaken, but I believe the sales are incredibly high because they included concert tickets? It's something I saw said in another thread, so I don't know first-hand. I do know the franchise is very popular in Japan, and has somewhat of a cult following of girls and women. It wouldn't surprise me if they wanted to complete their collections of CDs, manga, and games with the anime series.

All in all, it's fun to watch and some of the music is really good. Having no previous knowledge of the franchise; Season 2 is a lot better than Season 1.

it's selling so well because the first volume has a lottery ticket you need to try and get tickets to the live event at saitama super arena

expect the second volume to sell less than half this figure

Thanks. That makes a lot of sense.

Whoa Persona 4 was that high? (Right next to AnoHana as well). Didn't know the anime could sell that well.

never noticed this before but..

>(2006) *15,021Death Note [Madhouse]

surprisingly low. i thought it was a subculture phenomenon but i guess its popularity had to bleed out over more years..

It was very successful once it was brought to the US, which theses sales numbers do not include.

... Never even heard a thing about those gold eggs and it's no1??? What gives?

Does this mean One Piece sells far less DVDs than Bleach? Lame!
