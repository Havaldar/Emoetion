Well, they're forcing "overachievers" to take vacation time now so this is going to happen more often.

Japanese people need to learn to take some personal time, and Japanese companies/management needs to stop treating people like machines.

They'll stop treating people like machines when it stops being so damn effective!

Hahaha, I actually thought about this, too, at one point. They do allude, though, that he got off relatively peacefully. I'd like to ask some of my friends who're parents what they think of this.

I'll have you know that his daughter is the most mature, intelligent, well spoken, coordinated 4 year old I've ever seen.  Most 4 year olds can't string together complete sentences, are bundles of unbridled emotions, have the attention span of goldfish, the patience of flies, and the hand-eye coordination of a rock.  Dude gets it so easy in this show.
>> ARTICLE
Allegedly its becuase a of a senior citizen discipline and easy going life rubbed off on her, same reason there are always mention of rin liking old people food.
>> ARTICLE
She's 6. Not a huge difference now that I think about the average 6 year old, so I think a large part was just her personality and being raised by an old guy. Old people are very easy-going, in my experience.
>> ARTICLE
Good post. Usagi Drop is probably my favorite slice-of-life show. Also I want to note that this anime doesn't have any forced drama or particularly heavy topics; it's a 'feel good' anime which features, as OP said, mature themes - and this is what makes Usagi Drop - talking about serious themes with lighthearted feel.

What I also want to add, is that the story is viewed from a completely normal adult perspective - something, if you think about it, that you rarely see in anime. Sadly enough.

Wouldn't have been able to tell if you hadn't mentioned it! I love this show to death, thanks for posting this. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry. Your post is well written and you have a great taste in anime for recommending this anime.
>> ARTICLE
> Also a word of caution: Usagi Drop is rather short, so after you're done with it you might want more. While Usagi Drop is based on a manga, it only adapted the first half. The second half is different, and goes into a direction that many people don't like due to its moral ambiguity. Don't worry, there's no child abuse or murder or other horrible stuff you could expect to find in anime and manga, it's just that it's morally ambiguous.

I beg of you, don't even try to know what happens in the manga. It's for your own sake.

I liked the end, not even kidding, I think people are just being close minded 
>> ARTICLE
You're not alone
>> ARTICLE
I liked the ending too. I feel as if the manga would have been better without the timeskip, but I enjoyed the second half regardless.
>> ARTICLE
Heck, the couple of them. At least volume 10 goes back and fills in a couple chapters worth of it, but not enough to be satisfying.
>> ARTICLE
It ruined my outlook on the show. Don't get me wrong. I finished the anime and it was great, but it's hard rewatching [](/s "those father/daughter scenes knowing what happens later.")
>> ARTICLE
Family to me is not about blood. It's about your relationship to another person. [Usagi Drop](/s "Maybe your older sister was put up for adoption, and a near twenty years after your birth you meet her and hit it off? Well then that's good for you, just adopt in stead of reproducing. However, if you spend ten years caring for a small child as a provider and father-figure before thinking you want to marry it I'd call you fucked up.")

[I would have been okay with it too...](/s " if they hadn't already set up the perfect romantic conclusion for all the characters. Then they just scrapped it for the cringeworthy ending we got")
>> ARTICLE
[More spoilers](/s "The author had Daikichi PERFECTLY set up with Kouki's mother, but instead of giving us what potentially could have been even more heartwarming than what we have now, we got our current manga ending. Honestly, the Usagi Drop manga is probably the thing I'm most bitter about.")
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "I disliked it because I thought of Daikichi and Rin more as a father and daughter relationship kind of thing.")
>> ARTICLE
If not liking that trainwreck of an ending is considered close minded I'd proudly be the most closed minded fucker on the planet.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that ending is really out of character for Rin given the first half. I have no idea why the author went that route, but good lord was it not needed.
>> ARTICLE
[Usagi Drop spoilers](/s "The manga ending had Rin and Daikichi planning on getting married and having kids right? While this is pushing the phrase 'moral ambiguity' a bit far, I can see how it's possible. Daikichi was the only one who wanted Rin after Grandpa died. It's natural for an impressionable young kid to fall in love with someone who's done a lot for them, and it's not too much of a stretch to see those feelings carrying over into adolescence. So I think Rin's feelings were at the very least plausible, if not likely.") 
>> ARTICLE
I don't feel like it was morally ambiguous. [I mean](/s "She realises she loves him after their respective love interests fall apart. He disagrees with it because it would be like marrying your own daughter, but agrees to it if she waits until after she finishes college. Then finally she's see pregnant with his child. There isn't any moral ambiguity there. I feel like they rushed the 'growing up' phase of their lives. There was a timeskip and I feel like we didn't really get a 'day-to-day' living experience with them in the second half. I would say it was poorly done, but not morally ambiguous.")

Edited out because I'm wrong.

[Manga](/s "it was revealed that Rin was adopted by her original parents, hence not blood related to Daikichi")

Ah ok. I never read the manga, just looked up the ending because I heard it was different.

Seems to be the common thing among everyone who has a problem with the manga. "Oh i never actually READ it, but i'm going to rant and complain about it because i looked at the last 5 or 6 pages out of context". [Also](/s "at no point is she ever pregnant aside from saying she wants to have his kid "some day", they never even mention sex outside that one line")
>> ARTICLE
You're right. I should have done more research before posting that. But if you read my previous post on the subject you'd notice that I'm not ranting or complaining about anything. I didn't hate this ending. In fact I honestly felt like it was a very real, very possible outcome, all things considered.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, no, i get that. But this is just another one of those bits of misinformation that sets people off even worse. It's bad enough people freak out over it because they only heard about the end, read the last chapter to confirm what they heard, and then take every other thing the read about it completely at face value without any sort of context.

Umm, just a technicality [but](/s "at no point is rin ever shown pregnant. She says she wants to have a kid with him some day, but as of the end of volume 10 it hasn't happened.")

my bad, i'm getting my mangas mixed up. you're right - she says something along those lines but it's doesn't show.

[That would all be fine and dandy except for the fact that](/s "he's like 20 years older than her and her father figure.")
>> ARTICLE
That's fine and dandy except she flat out told him she never saw him as a father figure.
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of her feelings, he did see himself as her father. I'm not saying the whole thing is objectively wrong and frankly the ending didn't bother me that much but you can't just call it a normal relationship.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, no, not at all. I didn't even mean to imply it was normal, but i don't also think it's overtly wrong either.

Hell, even Rin knew it was. Her first reaction when she realized it was pretty much horrified embarrassment. But people like to portray it as Daikichi wanting to get all up on his "daughter", which was pretty much his exact opposite reaction. He spent 2 years (we can assume) trying to talk her out of it and in to a normal relationship but in the end she had genuine feelings for him, and he had to admit that. Really it was his last big sacrifice to her. Once again taking on a role he'd rather not, this time as a love interest instead of a guardian, in order to continue to make her happy.
>> ARTICLE
Since when has fiction had to be normal though? If fiction had to be normal we wouldn't have a bunch of the great stories and entertainment we have today.

This is true and I think a lot of people forget this important fact/idea.

Absolutely loved the anime. After I found out what happens in the manga I could never look at the series the same.
>> ARTICLE
Careful, this show will make you want to adopt a child. Really, right there. On the spot. Its dangerous!
>> ARTICLE
Just watched it last week, such an awesome show. It's unfortunate that it's as short as it is though. I would've liked it if there would have been some romantic development between Daikichi and the single mother though.
>> ARTICLE
I saw it last week as well, and thought the same thing. While I appreciate the emphasis on Rin's and Daikachi's relationship, I'm a sucker for romance and it would have fit well with the series.

I can understand why it didnt though, because of the, uh, manga.
>> ARTICLE
It stopped because a lot of people dislike the manga ending, but they could totally have continued the series with progression similar to what you mentioned instead of the original ending.
>> ARTICLE
I can agree that it's better to watch this show when you are mature. And if happen to have daughter you'll find so many similarities in life that are portrayed in the anime. Loved this, skipped the mangha and I'm looking for more shows like this.

>> ARTICLE
Other shows with a similar setting include [Barakamon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon), [Ikoku Meiro no Croise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9938/Ikoku_Meiro_no_Crois%C3%A9e) and [Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11179/Papa_no_Iukoto_wo_Kikinasai!). Note however that this last one, while the most similar in its setting (guy takes in young girls after their parents died), is also the only one on my list that has fanservice shots, of both the 10-year-old and the 14-year-old girl (luckily they stay clear of the 3-year-old) as well as of the main character's 20-year-old classmate with big breasts. If you're able to live with that you'll get a very touching story about a family of 4 adapting to the life in a one-room flat while the girls are still grieving for their parents, but if you absolutely can't stand it then better make a wide detour around that show.
>> ARTICLE
I'd also recommend [Seirei no Moribito](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1827/Seirei_no_Moribito). It's fantasy, and a bit more action, but thematically it's very similar. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for recommendations. I saw Barakamon but will check the other 2.
>> ARTICLE
"Listen to me girls, I am your father" has nothing mature in it at all. It's pure fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
It has some moments, mostly involving Hina, but its definitely far more T&A related than the other shows.
>> ARTICLE
This was /r/TrueAnime's anime of the week last week, and [as I posted there](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2v342f/anime_of_the_week_bunny_drop_usagi_drop/coe7bsu), I think this show's one weakness is that it's not realistic. Rin isn't representative of children, and this story would not have been anywhere near as heartwarming if Daikichi had taken in the average child.

The show does capture many of the joys of raising a child, and those are really nice to watch, but it ducks under having to depict any real difficulties by making Rin into literally an angel. That makes it lose a lot of points on the "mature, real-life anime" scale to me, but to be honest I'm not really sure I'd *want* to watch a realistic Usagi Drop. It does remain one of the best, most heartwarming SoL series I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
It seems Rin was written to be the "best kid ever". 

 That's even more apparent when you see the other children in the show (the son of the woman Daikichi likes was very realistic).

>> ARTICLE
Even Kouki, the son, was very exceptionally well-behaved for a 6-year-old boy. He mouthed off at Daikichi, but only because Daikichi mouthed back, and that was the rapport the adult established as acceptable. He's otherwise a very kind-hearted child, and even that is a rarity.

Real 6-year-olds are more like Reina, his cousin's daughter, was in episode 1 during the funeral. She turns pretty angelic as the show goes on though.
>> ARTICLE
right

i remember him doing some weird stuff though, the kind of weird stuff curious children do
>> ARTICLE
> Rin isn't representative of children

Well, she's a child which went through a lot and is apparently mature or something. She sounds a lot like my brother when he was little. Although the fact that she almost never cried in the show makes no sense.

But we have Reina, so we have that going for us which is nice.
>> ARTICLE
Rin isn't supposed to be representative of the average child though. Her upbringing wasn't typical, and it'd probably just end up unnecessarily messy if the single guy with zero experience handling children had to suddenly take care of a Reina-like child.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely. Rin never cries and screams, she's never selfish and never attacks anyone. Real children are more like Rin's half-grand-niece Reina, who shouts "Poop bomb!" at a funeral because she can't do cat's cradle.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is morally ambiguous for people with ambiguous morals. Morals like "you can't love someone unless society agrees with it".

[Spoiler](/s "Rin was discovered to not be related to Daichiki at all. Even then, he saw that such a relationship was problematic so initially he refused. Even though he was facing a lonely life (basically he had lost all hope at a marriage), he still encouraged Rin to leave him and go to college. He absolutely refused to hear of a relationship until Rin experiences more of what life had to offer. And Rin still wanted him.")
>> ARTICLE

Oops, sorry.
>> ARTICLE
They're two adults making a consensual decision.


>> ARTICLE
Absolutely correct. 
>> ARTICLE
[](/s "They're two adults making a 'consensual' decision when one has had power over the other one for nearly her entire life.")

[](/s "The reason parent-child incest isn't allowed isn't just because of the risk of birth defects, it's because an adult has so much power over a child in their care that getting into a relationship with your child is an abuse of the relationship. Same reason why teacher-student relationships aren't allowed, and why it's a huge breach of ethics for a psychiatrist to date their patients.")
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you can totally see how he was grooming her to be his future bride the entire series.
>> ARTICLE
It's not even anything that Daikitchi specifically does. Nearly any parent spends lots of time teaching their kids stuff like "you have to do what I say" and "trust me, I have your best interests at heart". And for most parents, this is totally fine and normal, because they really do have their kid's best interests at heart. 

But the things you taught your kid don't just go away when your kid grows up. Getting into a relationship with someone who has been taught their entire life that they should do what you say because you know what's best for them is suuuper creepy.
>> ARTICLE
That's fine and all, except the fact that he was completely opposed to the idea of it. It's not like he [thought](/s "  "Oh, hey, i know what's best so lets get hitched okay?" If him knowing best and her doing what she was told was her driving force then when he turned her down that would have been the end of it. People keep wanting to act like he had some kind of hand in this, 90% of the posts are "If you **want** to marry your kid then you're fucked up." And yeah, that would be true, except he wanted no part of it.  He spent 2 years trying to convince her to seek out a normal relationship, and in the end only capitulated because he DID have her best interests at heart. It it a weird relationship? Heck yeah it is, but it's nowhere hear as "super ultra the most fucked up thing ever" that people are making it out to be. And more and more it also seems the people having that reaction are the ones who heard about the ending, skimmed over the last chapter or two to confirm, and missed out on any of the context it's presented in. They either miss out on, or because it's inconvenient for their argument, completely ignore how horrified daikichi is when he find out, hell even Rin's first reaction is embarrassed and disgusted with herself at first. They BOTH realize that it's not a normal relationship, but in the end her feelings are real, and not some product of subtle brainwashing. And, as i've said many times before, Rin in no way sees Daikichi as her father, or a father figure at all. She flat out tells him that multiple times. ")
>> ARTICLE
But the point is that her feelings are the result of "subtle brainwashing" just like any kid's feelings for their parents are. You think any father is gonna teach his daughter that he's an asshole? Of course not. Rin has those feelings because Daikichi was her adoptive father for so long and his responsibility as an adult is to realize that and keep rejecting her. 
>> ARTICLE
His responsibility as an adult is to trust that SHE, as an adult, is capable of making her own decisions, good, bad or otherwise.
>> ARTICLE
1. She was not an adult. 

2. She can't just unilaterally decide to start a relationship with him. He has to agree to it first. 
>> ARTICLE
1. He made her wait 2 years and attempted to change her mind, so when she chose again, yes, she WAS an adult.

2. He DIDN'T agree to it until she had time to think it over, and come to the conclusion that it was what she wanted.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I said it's ambiguous. [Manga spoiler](/s "Daikichi tells her to wait until she's out of school or out of university (I can't remember), so in the end you have two adults who aren't blood-related making a consensual decision, so there's no problem there. But what people don't like is that they were in a sort of father-daughter relationship before. The reader has basically accepted them as father and daughter at that point and still has that image of Rin as a little girl in his head. It is understandable that people don't like the thought Daikichi being in a relationship with this little girl, and thanks to her 'I want Daikichi's baby' remark at the end the image of Daikichi having sex with Rin comes to mind, and that's not a picture I want in my head when I watch the show, because then there's always this thought of 'These two are gonna do it like animals in a few years' floating around.") I prefer to think of the manga as a completely separate and non-canon entity, like a doujin.
>> ARTICLE
If it makes you feel any better, NEITHER of them seem [like](/s "the type to "go at it like animals". Hell, Daikichi even says in volume 10 that "My wife acts like an old woman" to Kouki.")
>> ARTICLE
Wait, wait, wait... [](/s "At which point of the story did they have sex?") 
>> ARTICLE
Welp, after volume [9](/s "They're officially married so it's kinda implied. It's never outright stated they did or didn't aside from her saying she wants to eventually have his kid.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers continued](/s "That's my biggest issue with it. If they had been separate stories, and you showed me the second half of the manga and I had no previous idea what their relationship was like, and it was just two people in a relationship 20 years apart, I would have no issues with it. But because of the established parent-child relationship, it just makes it too damn uncomfortable.")
>> ARTICLE
My objection to the manga's ending isn't the moral ambiguity, but rather how they turned the characters around and made the story about something more than just a father and a daughter. 

Why? What was the need for that to happen? It doesn't add an edge to the plot, I mean [](/s "Incest/incest-like relations") happens in anime/manga all the time. So it's nothing new and it declaws the story's original hook about being a slice of a family's life.

I think it's just something that didn't need to be there. If the plot continued on the original premise then it would have been much better imho.
>> ARTICLE
I don't mind the manga ending myself. If Usagi Drop is a mature anime for mature people (I loved it and I'm 22 with no children), then those same people should be able to understand the manga ending and not feel the need to tell people not to read it. It's there, it's canon, they can  make their own decision based on it, and I agree with what you've said about it, about society, etc. I thought it was pretty heartwarming, personally.
>> ARTICLE
This anime (and half the manga) is pure bliss, and the greatest example of Slice of Life.

I don't think I have ever, or ever wanted to resonate with a character as much as I did with Daikichi.

It's been a while since I've actually watched Usagi Drop, but even when I'm being safe with my opinions, I'd say that it should definitely be around the same level of maturity as Usagi Drop.

Basically, this. I don't think I would be able to watch this show because I would have that ending in the back of my mind.
>> ARTICLE
i'm with you. I really enjoyed it and was super happy I found it. I thought, for once, an untarnished little gem of a story about being a parent. I got to the last episode then I googled the manga. 

Wtf, man. WTF!
>> ARTICLE
Try seeing them as two separate things if you don't like it. The show is too good to miss it just because of an ending that will never get animated.
>> ARTICLE
The second half of the manga basically subverts the entire message of the anime and its first half, going from a show that presents a growing father-daughter relationship in difficult circumstances, showing growth and personal learning from not only the adopted daughter but also the father himself to one where they decide "okay that's enough father-daughter growth let's get into a romantic one. With the same people." Ugh.

You can separate the two and have the second half be an "okay" manga but putting them together was such a mistake I don't even know what the creators were thinking.

>> ARTICLE
>I mean sure, that's probably what 11-year-old girls do, but did you really have to show that?

I haven't watched Kodomo no Jikan, so I only mean to defend it in the loosest sense of the word here, but no show ever "has" to do anything it does. Any time a show does something, it could have elected to do it in a different way instead. To me, if something is realistic and is an experience the author feels they want to tell a story about, I consider that a good enough reason to show it, taboo be damned. I don't like the idea of criticizing art simply for being taboo, forward, or even disgusting sometimes. [Saya's Song](https://vndb.org/v97) is my favorite story, after all.

Obviously, being taboo can be done wrong too, just like anything else though.

Also, venture out into doujin territory for a while and you'll come across a startlingly large amount of much more disturbing material than Kodomo no Jikan is, most of it written by men. Men are just as liable to write this kind of stuff as women are, and they publish it anywhere they safely can. The anonymity in doujin circles makes it a good place for them.
>> ARTICLE
Women are the only ones ALLOWED to write stuff like this.

If a woman writes it, people say she has "daddy issues", which is merely insulting.

If a man writes it, they say he's a dangerous perverted sexual predator, which accusation can end up destroying his life even if he's never so much as gotten a speeding ticket.

Art is art, but beware the audience; they're a dangerous bunch of fucks.

>> ARTICLE
I got the impression Rin's biological mother might be based on the author herself. . .

[spoiler](/s "finally someone gets it.  All of the people saying there is nothing wrong with the second half seem to think people are complaining about blood relationships or something (of which there are none of course).  It has to do with the fact that the entire first half of the series is about the relationship of a father and daughter that the entire second half throws out the window.")
>> ARTICLE
No it isn't. Rin flat out refused to regard Daichiki as her father from the get go. Because she knew she had a father, that was not Daichiki. Reason why she never called Daichiki anything but that. 

As a matter of fact, he considered her more a daughter way more than she considered him a father.

The reason I actually started considering watching Barakamon was because of Usagi Drop. I did find-out about the manga, and read enough of the end to verify the growing dread I was coming to realize from comments here and there. SO, forget that. When I'm in the mood again, I'm going to pick-up Barakamon. Gotta say, though, Usagi Drop was such an easy watch that if I ever got in to that mood again post-Barakamon, I'd have no problem just going back to Usagi!

As a side-note, I'm leaving this here as posterity so I can reference it in a week or two when I post a project I've been working, which includes my own review of Usagi Drop. I'm not ripping-off your idea, I swear!

Well yeah.

Read the first 4 chapters of the manga. It actually has better pacing than the anime and if you liked the anime for it's parent-child relations aspect, you'll like the manga even more.
Then the time shift occurs and sadly it turns into average teenage drama - not worth reading past the 4th chapter.
>> ARTICLE
Is there any other anime/manga that have as good a parent-child relations aspect. I really really liked the anime, and the manga ending had to come along and fuck it all up >:[
>> ARTICLE
Sadly, I don't think so. Usagi Drop is unique.
>> ARTICLE
The manga ended not long before the anime came out, and it was impossible not to know the ending if you were actively browsing forums at the time.  I tried to pretend that the anime is a different universe and that the theoretical future of it would be different but I just couldn't do it, and it definitely took something away from my enjoyment of the series.  

I just hope the mangaka originally hadn't planned the ending so the earlier volumes are actually genuinely innocent rather than intentional subtle foreshadowing or something.
>> ARTICLE
YEAH FUCK THAT...wait...I liked the ending of the manga. oh shit, what the fuck is wrong with me?!
>> ARTICLE
Apart from the overused swearing, people shouldn't downvote this for expressing an opinion. I agree with you, I liked it as it was definitely almost inevitably going to happen.
>> ARTICLE
Haha nah it's all good. All my friends make fun of me for liking the ending, I'm used to getting shit for it. But as for the language, my computer does this thing where it adds bad words to everything I post - FUCK!...sorry.

[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Well, not really [Usagi](/s "incest"). But it's still disgusting because he literally raised her. I don't understand how he would even agree to something like that.
>> ARTICLE
[Usagi Drop](/s "You can't reject Rin!")

The thing is that you can't lie to yourself, and that's exactly what Rin did. And [Spoiler](/s "Daikichi had no reason to reject him apart from the fact that there's still some lingering affection that is a relationship between a father and a daughter. In the end, they're not daughter and father anymore, Rin would like to broaden their relationship into something more intimate(arguably) and you can't blame her for her decision. Nor can you blame Daikichi, because think about it, what else could he have done? He had absolutely no reason to reject her!")

I won't judge your opinion, but it seems like half the people here are just looking at the end result and not realizing what the story is trying to convey to us. 

>> ARTICLE
I can't twist it in any way that makes it look like any less absurd. He practically raised her from when she was a toddler. I mean, come on. Sure, loving your parent is completely normal. Wanting to get in his pants is way out there, though.
>> ARTICLE
First of all, [spoiler](/s "You have a really messed up idea of marriage, you think it's all about 'getting in his pants'? No! Rin obviously wanted more from their relationship, even getting to the point of I want to stay with you forever. Rin never considered Daikichi as a father, maybe a father figure so it was inevitable that she'd develop feelings for her. As for Daikichi, he couldn't believe it either, he didn't just jump into the gun and said yes, he took time to digest it and in the end she just couldn't reject her. Honestly, I said already - he had no reason to reject Rin, APART FROM THE LINGERING AFFECTION OF A FATHER/DAUGHTER relationship.")

[spoiler](/s "I can't cite it from anywhere but I've heard somewhere that women look for their husbands to be like their father. Up to you whether you believe me or not but I can't force my opinion of the manga nor anything to you. If you think it's disgusting, by all means think like that. However, I suggest you see another light in the manga")
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Daikichi saw her as his daughter and says it explicitly. [Spoiler] (/s "Then he goes on to get in a romantic relationship with her? "there's no way to put it other than incest. Blood related or not and whether Rin denied in or not, they had a father-daughter relationship. Not to mention she 15 at the time of expressing her feelings which isn't the age of consent in America. I don't know about Japan.") I'm surprised there's people who actually liked the way it ended. =/
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mind the ending, that ended in a way that I was thinking it'd end(along with a few other endings...). What strikes me the most is the complete change in the atmosphere. It went from warm and fuzzy into dark themes of drama, relationship and shoujo. That fact ruined the show for me, I'm sorry but I just want to have an anime that gave me the same feeling as the first half of the manga(i.e. anime). 
>> ARTICLE
That's what happens when there is a time skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Now how the hell would that happen. I just don't get how Rin would ever do that. And why would Daikichi go along with it? 
>> ARTICLE
I was surprised, I thought it was going to be about animal abuse.
>> ARTICLE
Well... Rin takes after her mother in some ways.
>> ARTICLE
The [spoiler](/s "post time skip") manga isn't *that* bad.  It's certainly _not_ the direction I would have gone.  But, to me, it only seems bad in comparison with how wonderful the earlier parts of the manga were.
>> ARTICLE
after reading the manga I was unable to deal with anything Usagi Drop related.  It totally ruined the anime for me :(  The First half does an AMAZING job with the Parent Child relationship, and the second half doesn't do too badly with it either.  However the ending just sort of says fuck you I'm going to ruin your entire experience.
>> ARTICLE
Ohh well it seem like I'm gonna have to read the manga
>> ARTICLE
There ought to be a general consensus around these parts to ***never again mention the ending to Usagi Drop***.  That shit is just too traumatic.
>> ARTICLE
I really should get around to watching this. As long as it's not one of those animes that have really sad parts or endings. I just recovered from the shock at the very end of Gurren Lagann...for some reason I didn't expect it ;_; so yeah, nothing more depressing!
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit. I just read the wiki summaries for the manga ending.... I really wish I did not read that. WTF was the writer thinking? That's some School Days type of shit right there. :[
>> ARTICLE
I completely disagree, while I don't approve of the manga continuing on I think looking on the anime, there was a chance that it was going to happen and I don't find it as disturbing as you might think. I don't approve of the manga continuing base on the fact that it became a typical shoujo romance and drama that it obliterates the themes that were expressed on the first half of the manga. While the ending may seem like it went off on a weird note, I've always thought of it as a possibility, seriously. It could've ended in different ways sure but that's not even the point, the themes have completely change that's what you should be worried about!

TL;DR: I wanted more Child/Parent relationship, I didn't mind the ending, I mind the complete change in themes and genre, I hate them for doing that type of transition.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the ending.
>> ARTICLE
Parents. It's so much easier to believe adults just mysteriously disappear after they have kids than try to explain why in nearly every single anime the parents are just never around yet still apparently involved in the life of their child.
>> ARTICLE
Throughout the entirety of K-On! I think they mentioned Yui and Ui's parents less than a handful of times. I had gotten to the point where I thought they were orphans. I was shocked when they showed up in the movie.
>> ARTICLE
Working in neighboring cities or suburbs isn't too uncommon due to japan's super efficient and convenient tram system. So some parents do just give their child an allowance and spend a few nights away. But it isn't nearly as common as anime makes it out to be lol.
>> ARTICLE
I was so confused watching Flying Witch when both parents were still around.
>> ARTICLE
And then when there IS a parent it's usually just a mother, or at least in my experience
>> ARTICLE
I'm generally fine when parents are left out if thy aren't needed for the story. The ones that get me are when they explicitly mention parents in conversation without any intention of showing them. 

There are plenty of reasons why nobody might be home, they could be working late or out shopping or out with friends etc. any number of reasons why they might be gone for this one hour scene or even the one night.

Barakamon was refreshing in that regard.

All the characters are like 17 or 18 in my head because there's no way the flashbacks to their "childhood" are anything less then 5-10 years. The characters look like toddlers in the flashbacks and they want me to believe it was 2 years prior to the start of the series???? Also the ending makes much more sense if the cast is going off to university than high school at the end of the series.

I do that too. They look like fetuses in their flashbacks.

whats that

>> ARTICLE
The lack of highly trained professional mech pilots in just about every show with mechs.
>> ARTICLE
Schwarzesmarken explained this pretty well. All the adults were dead, and only kids were left. And even then they were so desperate that kids were thrown into combat with barely any training because they didn't have soldiers. 
>> ARTICLE
Mobile Suit Gundam justified this, at least.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, there are like 3 shows (Ok, one's a franchise) where this is a thing, and of those, they all provide halfway decent explanations.

And even Gundam moved away from it after Zeta. Now days Mecha just has a huge issue with child soldiers because no one things that "you know, making kids the pilots of what's basically a mix between a fighter jet, bomber, and tank probably would lead to serious psychological issues."
>> ARTICLE
The various Gundam series at least directly show that being a Gundam pilot leads to severe psychological issues. I'm pretty sure every pilot in Gundam Wing has at least one mental breakdown throughout the series. Heero [Gundam Wing](/s "tries to kill himself like 25 different times.")
>> ARTICLE
EDIT: Extensive spoilers to several different gundam shows are to follow. 

Oh, that's not even the worst breakdown on that show. You're forgetting Quatre's little meltdown after he gets Wing Zero built. 

Plus, with the exception of maybe Iron Blooded Orphans, most of the time the issues have nothing to do with their being what's basically a fighter pilot. Heero's like that because he was raised to be a weapon despite really hating war.  Quatre flips out because he gets the Bruce Wayne treatment from Oz. Setsuna was a child soldier who shot his parents after being brainwashed (and piloting a weapon of war and killing dozens of people makes him better and transcend humanity.) Kira cries a bit because some of his friends die and his ex girlfriend kind of was using him but hated him. Heero stops being suicidal and starts dating a princess.

The rest of the pilots are pretty much the same before and after. In some cases, like Kamille Bidan, it actually is a massive improvement. 
>> ARTICLE
It's been awhile since I've seen the show, but I would say that many of the psychological problems the characters in Wing had were at least exacerbated by being pilots. Part of Heero's damage is from [GW](/s "accidentally killing a little girl and her dog during a mech fight pre-series. He also takes down that aircraft full of civilian diplomats during a battle during the series, which causes his mental state to spiral down further. Wufei clearly has issues adjusting to civilian life after the war, as shown by his actions in Endless Waltz. Quatre's father dying plus Wing Zero was what directly caused him to go nuts, but I can't help but think all the shit that happened to him before that had something to do with it too. Of all the pilots, Quatre has the least suitable personality for a job that involves killing tons of people, which is something he clearly struggles with.")
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's a valid point. But Wing seems to be the outlier there, and its entire thing (besides being deliciously cheesey like a pizza) is that the characters all have a ton of baggage. Besides Duo and some of the supporting cast:

* Heero's a suicidal human robot. He also doesn't know how to properly express himself around girls he is into.

* Chang is a mysognistic asshole who can't make friends, accept loss, or move on from war.

* Quatre snaps after losing all his loved ones. 

* Trowa is a guy who's been a child soldier so long that he doesn't have a real name or qualms about stealing someone's identity. He has a weird relationship with his sister.

* Zechs hates himself almost as much as Heero. He has a weird relationship with his best friend. He has major family issues.

* Treize has a god complex and is a sociopath who, to accomplish what he sees as fit for humanity, will sacrifice literally hundreds of thousands of lives, including those of his friends. 

* Releena wants to date a robot. She has no sense of danger. She trusts strange men, literally walks into the middle of a battlefield, yet everyone wants her to be in charge of stuff. 

 
>> ARTICLE
NGE explained this...kind of? 
>> ARTICLE
My favorite is how professional soldiers who probably went through years of grueling training to fly mechs are taken down like flies and possible killed by schoolchildren. I'm looking at you kallen from code geass.
>> ARTICLE
In Kallen's defense, it is not like she was some random schoolgirl that jumped into a mech. She grew up participating in a militant resistance group from a rather young age, considering Area 11/Japan had been under rule since early childhood and her family's involvement. She was also piloting one in her first appearance (and who knows how many times previously) and may have appeared average because the resistance only had sub-par mechs before actually receiving financial backing.  
Now some of the Gundam series, though I enjoy them, have a bunch of instances of children being OP upon first operating any sort of weapon.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, she was piloting the Guren Mk. 2. Skill can only take you so far against that thing.
>> ARTICLE
CG kind of implies that she had spent a lot of time practicing but then Lelouch jumps in with like zero training whatsoever & holds his own....

Maybe the Knightmare Frames are also powered by Spiral Energy?
>> ARTICLE
Well Lelouch also had the Shinkiro. A Knightmare with controls "so complex that only a genius could operate it". Who would design such a thing I don't know, but it did play to Lelouch's strengths pretty well.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't the shinkiro stolen? Or is that the other Knightmare I'm thinking about?
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch stole the Gawain, which he lost battling against Orange Boy at the end of season 1. He pulled out the Shinkiro in season 2 during the battle for China. The Shinkiro was heavily based on technology from the Gawain though.
>> ARTICLE
The genius level controls could be justified by saying it was specifically designed for Lelouch then I guess.
>> ARTICLE
It *was* specially designed for him by Rakshata
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I suppose. It seems a little weird to make a Knightmare that only one person can pilot, but I can't argue with the results.
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch isn't a great pilot though. He just had OP mechs with crazy weapons.

Remember for most of season 1 he was in a regular Knightmare and was going through those things like paper napkins.

Forced romance in non-romance shows.

[](#kumikouninterested)

Especially if it adds nothing to the story/plot.
>> ARTICLE
I hated this one in Parasyte especially.
>> ARTICLE
I get what you mean, the anime was pretty good and I feel like if they omitted the romance at all it wouldn't have changed the anime much. I kinda enjoyed the primary romance between Shinichi and Murano. But they really forced putting the love triangle and adding Kana to the mix. It was kind of useless to add her into everything honestly.
>> ARTICLE
One of the few things I disliked about Log Horizon. It was only really one episode, but still really struck me as unnecessary and dumb.
>> ARTICLE
Forced romance in romance shows as well
>> ARTICLE
I *kinda* understand if it's done in romance shows, because it's technically the main point of the plot. It only means the romance, of a romance show, is badly written if it needs to be forced.

That said. Forced romance in general is bad regardless of genre.
>> ARTICLE
I would say that is way more prevalent in western television and movies especially. Best example is the fucking Hobbit movies, they added in a romance that significantly worsened the movie and it wasn't even in the source.

That's part of the reasons why I ended up disliking the show. It pissed me off.

Hmm? Now that you mention it, I can't recall any of Shuu's sexual harassment. I just remembered everything that makes him the best guy from the manga.

He tries to see into the bath and gets everyone to listen in, he looks into the girls room while theyre sleeping, and one or two other things.  REALLY tame for an anime and he's still a better charscter than Raku

>> ARTICLE
That tsundere characters sometimes normalize really toxic attitudes about romance.

* Physical/verbal abuse? Totally okay to slap the shit out of/belittle guys. Nothing wrong here. They'll be even when he fucks her later. Or maybe they'll just hold hands.

* If she hates you and says no all the time, it just means she secretly wants the dick and is just playing hard to get. Just keep pestering her. It'll work out. You totally won't be a clingy creep.

* Having wild emotional swings that can get abusive is normal and doesn't need to at least be talked about with a therapist.

Of course, not all tsunderes are like this. And some even subvert and address the above issues. It's also normal/okay for this sort of behavior to be moderately present in people (not the physical abuse though, it's never okay to hit people). It's just that when the trope is lazily invoked that these problems start to arise.
>> ARTICLE
Not wanting to be rude seeing that you wrote such a long text...but do you just dislike this, or are you actively pretending as if it doesn't happen? 

Since that was kind of what this thread is about...not things you simply dislike.

I dislike it, but I usually ignore it. I try not to let it bother me too much while watching/reading because it's such a widespread character type. I'd rather not let trope baggage spoil characters like Rin Tohsaka or Asuka Langley, who are otherwise very good.

I also think/hope that people are capable of distinguishing fictional romance from actual romance, so hopefully it's actually not such a big problem.

It's just something that occasionally crosses my mind and annoys me.

I love when people simply ignore parts of a character's personality though personally I can't see the point to it.

Christ it was so annoying on Rin. Ruined parts of the show for me.

I think the best example of a well done tsundere would be Chidori from FMP. The only time she's abusive to Sosuke is when the retard decides to nuke her shoe-box because he thought it was a bomb.

What are the things that abomination of an adaptation fucked up?

In the anime Arcueid's route is rushed in one cour, Arc's personality is too serious and generally everything feels really underwhelming. 
[The soundtrack was great, tho.](http://youtu.be/bZnyYBRHnvw)

the next route is gonna be somewhat similiar to the arc one, but brace yourself for the wild ride that are the far side routes

thats where tsukihime really starts to shine imo (though the action does get less if you liked those parts)

I've not seen it, but apparently it tries to do every route, much like the Deen F/SN did.

At least we have the manga adaptation.

This has become a meme, but actually both Tsukihime and and Chaos;Head get a lot of unjustified shit from people.

As an adaptation, yeah, they're both kinda bad compared to the source material. But if you go in any of them blindly, they're kinda *meh*, but not a disaster by a long shot.

I'd say they have a lot in common with Umineko (which also was a fail adaptation compared to the source material), but strangely only Chaos;Head and Tsukihime recieve o much flack for it.

I though Tsukihime was pretty mediocre. Chaos Head on the other hand I rather enjoyed, it's not a masterpiece but it's a perfectly watchable show.

Actually, i tend to avoid those show.

I wish they would move their demographic to college age. Its getting weirder and weirder looking at fanservice of characters who are up to 4 years younger than me, especially if they are not drawn or act like they are that age.

Also, CGI. Please guys, if you cant afford to have a shot of a bus driving drawn, just give an inside shot with blurred landscape, it will save frames too.

That's kind of hilarious. Each episode is five minutes long (I'm sure actually less due to OP/ED) and there's only twelve of them. And then there's a recap episode that is ten minutes long.

The second season of Eureka 7.
>> ARTICLE
When you say second season, do you mean the second part of the original or AO?

If you're talking about the original, which I assume were the episodes 13-25 ish, I feel like those were necessary to grow and mature Renton, and make Eureka a more  relatable character as she becomes less aloof.

If you're talking about AO, though... 
>> ARTICLE
AO
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the second season of eureka 7 was poorly paced, but dealt with some huge concepts which is what makes it one of my favorite series overall. Concepts like the methods to your means and how having someone's physical limitations change, doesn't change the person that they are and how they feel. Few series attempt to develop a relationship that is as strained at eureka's and renton's, but the fact that it is strained shows us its not always happy flowers and daisies. Theres misunderstandings, dynamics change, and it can be difficult to understand your own feelings towards a person. Eureka 7 deals with all these topics and puts them in a frame of reference that even a younger teenager can understand.

Would you mind explaining it?
>> ARTICLE
Minami-ke is an hilarious anime about 3 sisters with different personalities.

There are guys, but they actively added to the comedy.

Season 2 was pretty bad because the minami-sisters had a new neighbour, an anime-original male character that took unnecessary amounts of screen-time and stopped all the gags while he was on screen.

Fuyuki.

The episodes were Fuyuki was ignored were the funniest, while the ones where he had screentime were the most tedious and boring to watch.

If you go through old forums discussions of minami-ke you can see everyone raging everytime fuyuki had screentime and wanted the girls to ignore him so ridiculously funny situations and misunderstandings would continue.

ah ok, thanks!

It is the title, though.  ['Tora' is the Japanese word for tiger, and 'dora' is the first two syllables of the English word 'dragon' when spelled in katakana ( = doragon).](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
So that's why it sounds like they say "doragon" when they talk about Dragon in One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
Yep.  Japanese doesn't have letters so much as syllables, so every consonant is paired with a vowel after it.  (Except when it sometimes ends on an 'n'.)  This means when they use English words, a lot of extra vowels are added to match the syllabary they're used to.

**Episode 7:**

First, about the post-episode content, I know Kouki's pain. I hate going to do "shopping", and when I do I like being done quickly. Unlike my dear grandmother, who feels it's a wasted opportunity if it lasted under 4 hours. Also, "It tastes like Summer!" - What a great line.

This episode was so very un-anime. "I didn't want to become strong, I wish I could've stayed a little girl forever." - Sort of the opposite of what all the shounen anime is about, about growing up and gaining strength, eh? Just that on the other side you discover it's never enough, and there are always more hills to get over, and "strength" isn't enough to get over them. That's what it looks like on the other side of the hill of adulthood.

This episode was rough, and all dealt with one issue, but still felt like you could've stuffed it into two episodes, or even three. A hymn to single parents, and to mothers who raise their children in general, as Haruko said, "Girls always have a heavy load to bear."

The issues of real life and raising a kid, feeling alone even in a family, not being independent, having to "put up with things," and feeling so alone you no longer even try to get things better. Haruko versus Kouki's mother, and Daikichi, just adults trying to navigate life, on their own. Yes, you have families and friends, but in the end you're alone with your decisions. Quite an episode.

**Episode 8:**

Masako's "This time I will finish it." And the notion of how she has to make the most of her time before she's caught up to by the next generation? It's all about life and death. She feels the finality of her life, its temporal nature, so she feels she must do a lot before she'll be replaced. She also feels guilt about Rin, whom she abandoned while still half-baked, and there's no going back.

More than that, you can see her forcing herself to forget, in her own words, she has to work, her work is the reason she is alone. She abandoned Rin for her work, and now her work forces her to keep abandoning people, as penance. That's fucked up, right? She chose work over someone dear, so now she *has* to keep choosing work, as to make the past decision a worthwhile one, and so, the price for one abandonment, for one excursion into loneliness, is to remain alone forevermore.

It makes more sense, as justification, when you spell it out like that - "I abandoned someone, so I must remain alone." The nature of change and the temporality of life and fame is also reinforced when Rin and Daikichi visit Grandpa's home, and even the location is no longer as it was. Coming home, and finding it no longer is, quite a shocker. The same feeling some people report after their homes get robbed and tossed.

**Episode 9:**

"How much is "just enough"?" - What a marvelous question, especially in order to do something as "cool", heh. "How many centimeters? How many millimeters?" - Murdering art and literary analysis, asking for everything to be measured to the last iota.

Of course, kids see, kids do, they see the teacher using circles as a teaching aid and copy them as well. Unsurprising.

Ok, aside from the above two notes, what did we have? Daikichi with the guys at work is once again about how we can't escape remembering we're mortal, how the new generation is inexorably tied to the current or previous one going away - what's insurance, or taking insurance for your kids' future, if not worrying about you being gone, and you being insufficient to care for them?

But this isn't just a story about adults, and adulthood, and becoming or being parents, it's also a story about being kids, and having parents, and growing up. Kouki looking at Daikichi's broad back? That's him looking at a father figure. Kouki isn't looking *for* a father figure, he already has one, as far as he's concerned.

"This too has the feeling of safety about it." The guys at work kvetching about their families, but in a manner that makes it clear that they won't trade them away and hold them dear, and not like Haruka that feels locked in a situation that is the least problematic, but because they feel safe and warm. Kouki pouted when Rin and Daikichi were leaving him, when Daikichi didn't listen to him but listened to Rin, because he sees himself as part of the family, but he knows he's not *really*, so a reminder of it makes him sad.

Kouki is so precious, in an anime, but I wouldn't be willing to put up with him in person. I also sometimes sigh at his antics in the show, alongside Daikichi and even Rin. Rin who is like a mother to him. Rin who is growing up, and nurturing others. Daikichi as a parent-child, and Rin as a child-parent, sort of how the show tackles its messages.

Also, this was the last episode I originally watched, so anything from here on out is completely new to me.
>> ARTICLE
Odd expression. She says "Unko bakudan", which does translate correctly to "Poop Bomb".
>> ARTICLE
Would that be similar to making a "big stink" over something?
>> ARTICLE
Oddly, I really remember this scene and sure enough that's what she says.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's just a little kid being a little kid.
>> ARTICLE
That's it.  Dunno why but she actually says "unko" during that scene I don't know the japanese for bomb (so I'm assuming the translator got it right) but I do know the word for poop.
>> ARTICLE
I've heard it pronounced "unchi" too, is there a difference?
>> ARTICLE
I've never heard unchi before, but it's not impossible.  Could also be a more slang term.
>> ARTICLE
Might be like poopie instead of poop
>> ARTICLE
Unko bakudan
>> ARTICLE
The kid has a habit of saying poop... oh wait that was from denou coil..

Now I'm just confused, either way I don't remember that in my version so yours must be a release from another group.

I'm not sure who subs it, but it's on Crunchyroll.

>> ARTICLE
\>Not watching anything by CR  
\>liking Doki subs

How wrong can you be?
>> ARTICLE
Why because years ago doki used CR's (actually HS's after they redid them) scripts?

That was what? 3-4 years ago?

Doki does their own scripts now, so don't even try talking to me like I don't know what I'm saying.
>> ARTICLE
AHAHAHA, oh god, where do I even start.

CR never had scripts for Dennou Coil in the first fucking place! HS therefore never released any of Dennou Coil, and neither did Doki. You have no fucking idea what you are talking about.

Besides, everybody got Ureshii subs for Dennou Coil anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Whoa excuse me?

This whole time you where talking about dennou coil?

Guess I wasn't clear on this in my first comment, I mentioned that there was a character in dennou coil who said "poop" a lot, I did not say doki subbed dennou coil.

When I said "I don't remember that in my version so yours must be a release from another group" I was talking about usagi drop.

So in effect, It is you who have "no fucking idea" what you are talking about.

And on a side note yes I have Ureshii's for dennou coil.

Unless they've changed, CR does have their own internal subbers that TL/Time/Edit.  One person used to do all the work for their respected show, but I'm not so sure about it now.

I loved Usagi Drop (anime)!  Are there any other shows which evoke the same sort of warm fuzzis?  Mere "Cute Girls Doing Cute Things" usually doesn't work for me.
>> ARTICLE
For me, what comes closest to the feeling I got from Usagi Drop was the manga "Love So Life". It's not an anime, but it has a lot of the good qualities Usagi Drop has, though the romance aspect plays a greater role.

>> ARTICLE
10/10 recommendation. Love So Life is amazing and you'll love it if you loved Usagi Drop.  
>> ARTICLE
Yotsuba& is manga-only, but it's probably the most well-known story of the genre. It captures a lot of the magic of childhood and of everyday life with a precocious little girl. Usagi Drop feels a bit more real since it focuses more on Daikichi and his struggles with raising Rin, while Yotsuba& focuses more on Yotsuba's daily adventures and her dad wasn't even named until a recent arc.
>> ARTICLE
Usagi Drop is a stellar show.

Great Write up and review!

I really enjoyed how comfy this show was. It may have had conflict and the characters certainly were stressed or anxious but to me as a viewer it was a consistently pleasant experience watching this show
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! Yeah I really do appreciate that while there is drama, it's always balanced out with positivity and never goes to the point of making the viewer uncomfortable.
>> ARTICLE
Is part 2 still a love letter to parenthood? :p Cuz the manga continues on after the show stops and, well, it sure gets interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
I am aware of the manga's controversial ending, but I chose not to mention it as it's already discussed far more than it deserves. I prefer to view Usagi Drop the anime as it's own entity, independent of the manga.

I want to contribute here a bit. In Russia we have a very popular (probably the most popular) source/database of anime [world-art.ru](http://www.world-art.ru/animation/) which also has its top. And it looks like this:

2. Steins;Gate
3. Clannad: After Story
4. Code Geass R2
5. FMA: B

Beck is a wonderful show. Glad the Russians like it as much as I do. GTO, as well.

Russian anime fans confirmed to be only anime fans without shit taste.

Holy Shit Beck! I approve!!

Wow! Beck : MCS is there, that's my jam

Monster is on rank 50. 
>> ARTICLE
For some reason, I really like the idea of Russians liking GTO. Onizuka kind of has that "Fuck it, were Russian" sort of vibe. Never thought about it before, but yeah, it works.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting enough. Also this list has considerable amount of shoujo/josei anime (Usagi Drop, Nodame Cantabile, Nana, Skip Beat!) that you don't see in other lists.
>> ARTICLE
It makes me happy to know that Russians apparently really like shoujo/josei. I'm not sure why, probably just the disconnect between how the internet commonly depicts Russia and something like Usagi Drop.
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, mandatory 'people /= government' comment. By the way, Usagi Drop is my favorite slice of life anime.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't mean that in a bad way. I meant it in the silly "Look at this truck in Russia driving down a highway at 90 MPH / 144 KM/H on three wheels" kind of way.

>> ARTICLE
That's...that's a lot of R2 love.
>> ARTICLE
HummingBird is the only website where the original series has a higher rating than R2.
>> ARTICLE
That's actually a really weird statistic. Normally, the second season is higher rated simply because the people who dislike the series never get to it. They drop it in the first season and then never touch the second season, resulting in slight inflation. On Hummingbird, the general userbase agrees that R2 was a large enough drop in quality from R1 that they even get past this inflation. My own opinion on R2 vs R1 aside, this is a pretty interesting statistic.
>> ARTICLE
I always thought of it as R2 having such a beloved ending, that it left a strong, good taste in everyone's mouth after the loveable trainwreck the actual season was. 
>> ARTICLE
The only part I didn't get was why he kept sneaking back into the school once he was long gone... It would have been easier with an entire freaking army to capture the people he wanted to protect from the school and keep them in the military base, but being smarter than everyone else and overcomplicating things is what leluch (sp) did best.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think R1 is much better than R2 simply because R2 is such an insane trainwreck. The ending saved it from having a lower rating than what I currently think of it.
>> ARTICLE
I actually felt completely different. I felt R1 was the trainwreck and R1's ending/R2 saved the series for me.  I even rewatched the series and came to the same conclusion. Of course, R2 (and R1) had lots of flaws themselves, but I just cant imagine Code Geass as a whole being better without R2. Maybe a better way of putting is I think R2 had higher highs and lower lows than R1. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel as if R1 was better because it was more strategic. R2 basically devolved into whoever had the best mech would naturally win. Oh shit that mech is so powerful, oh man now my mech has new stuff on it so I'm better, OH SHIT I HAVE A MECH THAT CAN DESTROY EVERYTHING WHILE STANDING STILL AND SHOOTING LASERS. Though the ending was very very good for R2 which is why people rate it highly imo. 
>> ARTICLE
I get that, but I dont see why people treat them almost as two different shows because of it.

R1 still had lots of strong mechs that single handedly turned around the battlefield and made strategy redundant. Examples include the the always incredible Lancerlot, Gurren and Lelouch's fucking Gawain)

R2 still had a lots of strategy and wit underneath the fights, including the escape from the chinese, the destruction of the tower, strategic positioning of the armies in the huge final battle. All of this that people *seemingly* forget just because there is a Lancelot and Gurren flying around.

You see. People act as if there are two extremes, R1 was prefect strategy and R2 was a stupid mecha-power circlejerk. But if you look closely, you can see each season actually has a lot of both. This is why I think the distinction between R1 being 'so much better' than R2 is just foolish. Strong Mechs and Strategy *is* Code Geass. If you just want strong mechs, go watch Gundam, if you just want strategy, go watch Legend of the Galactic Heros. But you cant just like Code Geass and then ignore half of what it is. Accept all of it or none of it.
>> ARTICLE
I just wish someone could explain to me why R2 was a trainwreck. What am I missing?
>> ARTICLE
I think it mostly boils down to the fact that the plot goes a bit haywire and introduces a ton of meaningless characters. I personally consider Code Geass one of my favorite animes but I honestly can't recall anything that happens between s2e1 - s2e22. It's very unmemorable save for the ending.
>> ARTICLE
[CG R2](/s "Sure you can! For example, one of the best scenes in the entire show is when Rolo kills Shirley. The bunney suit Kallen is all over the place too. What about how freaking cool Suzaku as a knight is!?")

I'd spoiler tag that^ anyways. But yeah, that Shirley scene messed me up. Can't forget that

MAL should seriously combine all the Gintama series except for the movies .

By the time the new Gintama comes this year  im 100% sure half of the list of the top 10 would be Gintama for a long long time  and I love gintama but still !
>> ARTICLE
I agree that MAL should reconsider when they combine entries. However doing so presents some clear challenges.

Firstly there's the question of what you do on the database side when combining series. Delete everyone's old ratings or try to average them out? At some level you'll lose data because inactive users won't come back and change their ratings, and inevitably you lose the information of which half is higher rated (even though selection bias arguably makes that question meaningless).

Secondly you open the more difficult can of worms of what criteria should be used to determine when series should be combined? When the second season follows directly from the first in style? When they air within enough time of each-other? When the MAL user base votes that they should be combined? What about splitting up Death Note into two halves on the same basis or going all the way and rating individual episodes?

I think it's clear that MAL will need a better system for dealing with the fact that most anime now take up several MAL entries, in this age where increasingly a show will get an 11 episode first season, 9 or so 2 minute specials, an OVA episode, a split cour second season, recap movies and finally a sequel movie.

The solution that I do think will eventually be implemented will actually be some sort of franchise system, but even that presents the problem of how do you divide up something like all the Ghost in the Shell anime.
>> ARTICLE
Easy

Allow a rating for the entire franchise but also allow people to rate individual seasons/segments/episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Consider the following example with made up ratings that do not reflect my actual opinion:

GITS SAC 2 episode 11 is rated 8.48

GITS SAC 2 is rated 8.55

GITS SAC (S1 + S2 + Solid State Society + Solid State Society 3D + Laughing Man +  Individual Eleven + ...) is rated 8.62

GITS ( GITS + Innocence + 2.0 + ARISE + SAC + GITS 2015 + ...) is rated 8.34.

Personally I think that's a lot of data to process at once. Furthermore it would put a strain on the servers to store that much more data as well as all the calculations needed to pool all those numbers together. I don't think it's impossible or even a bad idea per se, but I do think it would be difficult to implement in such a way that it's nice to use (both in terms of performance and UI).

I always find it endearingly peculiar that the ANN top 25 has three Maria-sama ga Miteru seasons. By the way, it's a very pleasant series.

[All the seasons are on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4U0FQ15BX8D1-lCVHli3WNK7KhVOuBtH)
>> ARTICLE
Now that you've pointed that out I've been consumed by curiosity? Was it a belligerent effort by /u/ or some such organization in a bygone era? Do ANN's users happen to be similar to the other sites for the most part, but have an unusually high ratio of Class S fans? Is this an oddity of the algorithm ANN uses to get their averages?
>> ARTICLE
Cowboy Bebop and Baccano! both in the top 25 on hummingbird, with Bebop nearly in the top 5. Sounds like my kind of site 
>> ARTICLE
It's fairly out of date at this point, but if we're looking at lists, [there's also this AniMetaCritic List](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/) from The Cart Driver, which compiled the MAL ratings of a bunch of anime critics/bloggers. It's unsurprisingly slanted towards the kinds of shows beloved by people who like to write a lot of words about their media, but with a number of surprising picks as well.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow nothing in the top 11 surprises me, except maybe Aria. Didn't know it was that well acclaimed critically.
>> ARTICLE
It's likely just reflective of the general self-selection that goes into sequel ratings - if you're watching the third Aria series, you're probably a person who's inclined to like Aria.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Game and Nodame in the top 25, could AniDB actually have good taste?!

Summer Wars should be bolded, looks like.

Don't say such things around here, people will run you out of town for liking good anime.

I enjoyed Cross Game, would you recommend the other 2? 
>> ARTICLE
If you have any classical training or just enjoy classical music, you will love Nodame. If you liked anything like Honey & Clover, you'll still like it even without that.

Summer Wars is basically my favorite movie ever.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. Think I'll also check out Summer Wars because I looked it up a while back and the bunny looks pretty cool from what I can tell. 
>> ARTICLE
I loved Nodame. It's a music slice of life, so if you're not into that, don't watch it, but the characters were nice, the music was fantastic, and I enjoyed it thoroughly to watch all 3 seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the response. I'm meh with slice of life. Last one I saw was Nichijou which was hilarious but I'll give it a shot if I'm in a slice of life mood!
>> ARTICLE
The AniDB results look majorly affected by the fact so many of their entries have so few ratings. Nodame has 6490 AniDB ratings compared to MAL 51210 ratings and Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season has 437 AniDB ratings compared to 8695 MAL ratings. Furthermore they seem to inconsistently amalgamate anime with all 3 Madoka Movies occupying a single entry and Mushishi Zoku Shou having 2 entries.

That's not to say that it's not possible that AniDB has good taste per se, but rather that their top rated anime list is messed up.
>> ARTICLE
Ima get rekt by downvotes for this, but **seriously,** why is FMA: B so universally loved? I watched the whole series 3 times just trying to understand what I was evidentially missing; as far as I could see it was just averagely good?
>> ARTICLE
One of the few shows that goes on for that long and actually has a cohesive, structured beginning, middle and end. Just a well told story is all.
>> ARTICLE
It's the anime equivalent of a western fantasy novel. Great world building, unique story, diverse cast, great character development, some twists and turns, satisfying ending, mix of action, drama, and humour, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I think to get at the top of lists like this, it's less important for it to be loved, than for no one to hate it. It also benefits from fame and popularity - it gets voted 10/10 by a lot of a newcomer anime watchers who have nothing else to compare it to.

It also exemplifies really well its genre. People who won't like FMA:B don't watch it in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Because its a perfect 10. The way they blend the dramatic moments with the soundtracks (and sometimes ED), the action is top notch, the VA's are *phenomenal* and its funny. 

Whats not to like? 
>> ARTICLE
different people like different things
>> ARTICLE
Can different people think different things?
>> ARTICLE
you don't say
>> ARTICLE
That doesn't mean that those different people liking different things don't have their own personal reasons for liking those different things.  lilelf29 probably was asking for examples of those personal reasons specifically referring to why people like FMA:B.

Basically, why do different people like different things?
>> ARTICLE
A big reason is because it's an easy to reccomend show, free of some of the dumb tropes that plague anime like random upskirts, MC's falling on vags, etc. I did like it a lot, but I definitely find some big problems with it, my main one being the ending. The main villain was probably one of the most boring villains in anime, and that ending was so shonen it was unreal. I actually thought that the original FMA was better, the villain was more interesting, and the beginning was much better (they skipped a lot in brotherhood)
>> ARTICLE
The biggest thing is that it's just a very solid show across almost all aspects. It is a great first anime and can appeal to everyone with a story that can be embraced by all, yet still holds quirks that make it uniquely it's own and uniquely an anime. It doesn't seem to excel at one particular thing, be it animation or sound or drama or comedy, but it still does all of those elements very well, and the combined overall goodness is it's biggest appeal. It's a jack of all trades in a way, and it just an overall balanced show. It also helps that the plot is one of the most well wrapped up storylines I can recall, and that "OHMYFUCKINGGOD" moment when everything comes together is really memorable.
>> ARTICLE
It has the largest draw and I think is consistently good in all aspects and all around very enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's universal. Anybody of about 12 or older could watch it and enjoy it. It's got good animation, well fleshed out characters, a great and original story, and plenty of philosophy. It's got funny, happy, sad, exciting, tense, scary, and thought provoking moments all wrapped up in one 60 episode series. It can be shown to anybody as a sort of "entrance to anime," yet a veteran watcher can enjoy it just as much. It has very few flaws (nearly none, actually) and does everything it tries to do extremely well. It covers all of it's bases; It ends the story in a satisfying way, it fleshes out it's characters thoughts, feelings, and actions and the reasons for each, it doesn't use bad CG and has an appealing art style, the pacing is good and doesn't leave much to be desired, it has a good english dub, and a million other things.

The show is just perfection incarnate. It's good because it doesn't fuck up. Steins;gate fans will admit that the show up until the latter half was slow and uninteresting. Gurren Lagann fans will say that Yoko was a bit overly sexualized, and that some bits at the end could have been omitted for sake of time. Cowboy Bebop fans (like me) will admit that the episodic nature bores some people, and the show is really only a 7 or 8 out of 10 until you've seen [spoilers](/s "the last episode"). But FMA:B is just ***good***. It's not that something about it is so keenly sharpened that it stands out. It's like a clean, sharp kitchen knife. It's not your sharpest, but it's flawless. It shines, no scratches, cuts everything equally without fail.

Maybe I'm exaggerating when I say it's perfect, but it's damn near it. I would go as far as to say it has no glaring flaws at all. But yeah. That is, at least, my take on why it's considered the best. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for your detailed reply, you have convinced me to give FMA:B another try.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but as an FMA:B fan, I can easily admit the show leans too heavily on the action shonen tropes (The whole last few episodes in particular) and Ed and Al are very sidelined down the line. The first 13 episodes are also rushed through pretty hard, which makes some scenes lack a lot of emotional power. Not only that, the humour can easily come off as obnoxious due to its placement (IMO its better in the manga). FMA:B absolutely is great, and it does have a universal popularity factor that pushes it forward for the younger audience of anime, but to say it has no points of contempt is absolutely ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly your point about the rushed early story is why I recommend starting with FMA if you're at all interested in the fullest experience. I'd say as a whole the original FMA is much weaker, but after watching it first FMA:B's beginning was VERY short indeed. I didn't care too much because I wasn't really looking to re-watch all of that again, and I think that might have been something the creators considered.
>> ARTICLE
As I always say,  FMA: B assumes you've watched FMA, so it skims over the beginning
>> ARTICLE
> I watched the whole series 3 times to understand what I was evidentially missing...

There are shows that I adore that I haven't watched that many times.  Maybe you like FMA:B more than you think?


>> ARTICLE
I think Brotherhood is so widely enjoyed because it's the most western. Other factors help, of course. The source material was incredibly well-written, and the adaptation was extremely faithful. Few anime tell a single overarching story so well, connecting every dot and and plot point. I could talk about why I like Brotherhood for hours.

But if you ask why it's so universally loved, I think the lack of Japanese influence is a big factor. No difficult to pronounce names with difficult-to-translate symbolism, no unfamiliar references or settings, and very little reliance on puns or wordplay for humor. I struggle to think of anime with as little to do with Japan as FMA: Brotherhood.
>> ARTICLE
You could actually be on to something there as I would say AoT is similar in terms of being western and it didn't enjoy it.

The animation quality was flawelss in AoT, but just about everything else was pretty poor imo.
>> ARTICLE
How did it in Japan?
>> ARTICLE
Really average actually. I don't remember exact numbers but the Blurays sold under 10k, maybe closer to 5~7k, despite the manga's immense popularity. To put it into perspective FMA:B sold as well as Guilty Crown, slightly better than Dog Days S1 and less than Hyouka. 

FMA:B was quite a long series though so that may attribute to its low sales. 
>> ARTICLE
I've got another one:  Attack on Titan is also a strictly western setting.  Based on its popularity I'd say your diagnosis is correct.
>> ARTICLE
FMA:B is just the anime that appeals to the most people. There's lots of action which appeals to a younger audience, yet there's also science, strategy, and questions about humanity and religion which appeals to an older audience. There's some very sad moments and a lot of comedy. There's some romance but it doesn't spend too much time on it. While FMA:B is outclassed by other anime in pretty much every area, FMA:B is at worst considered averagely good and many people consider it the best anime because it has so many different aspects going for it.

Not enough for me, what are you trying to say?

I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time, as bold of a claim as that may sound. It's what happens when you mix in a perfect adaptation of the source material from an anime studio with absolutely phenomenal writing. And to have that consistency in both writing and animation for a full 150 episodes is what solidifies it as one of the best. 
>> ARTICLE
> I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time

And not everyone shares that opinion as evident by a couple of top 25's. I think that's fine, it would be rather boring if everyone likes the same things. As they say, variety is the spice of life.
>> ARTICLE
That's true, and I'm not necessarily saying that these rankings are literally wrong just because HxH is not on it, because there are a lot of anime deserving of a top 25 spot. Simply explaining to /u/Heizenberg what /u/bloodgods was trying to say. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry I got it, it is pretty amazing for a production studio to achieve such a consistency, in 150 episodes! Can't think of any other mediums that have that, in any kind of media.

Yeah for me personally, i probably agree most with ANN(with animeplanet close behind) top 25 than the others, but my personal top 25 anime still doesnt match up with it.

Anime isn't 'dying' but I don't know why these charts would make for a convincing argument that it isn't. Most anime fans are only into anime for a few years and, particularly nowadays with the greater access afforded by widespread streaming, they tend to watch current material. What the airing year table tells us is that anime fans have only a very limited sense of the anime past.

>> ARTICLE
Might get some hate for this, but since it's in 4 of the 5 lists now's as good a place as any to say it: 

Wolf Children isn't as good as everyone says it is, and I don't really think it deserves a spot so high on so many lists. 

Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with plenty of touching scenes and is, without a doubt, visually beautiful. But I don't think it's the masterpiece so many people seem to say it is. I'd hardly call ti equal to most Ghibli movies and, other than having a slightly unusual premise, wasn't anything too special. Since I should probably back up these opinions, I'm going to get into spoilers. So If you haven't seen it: turn back now.

My biggest problem with this movie is the ending(s). I feel almost totally robbed of an emotional climax. Ame becomes the real focus of the story for the last quarter and he's honestly kind of unlikable. For his big emotional scene all we get is a

"No, don't leave" 

"I have to leave" 

"Okay" 

kind of interaction. Which I suppose could be impactfull if they did a little more with it, but as is it feels very anti-climactic. Yuki doesn't even get that. All she gets is one confession of her identity (in an admittedly cool 'shot' where the curtains blow in front of her as she transforms and whatnot) to one kid. I found myself asking what this reveal is supposed to mean for Yuki. Does it mean she's accepted her wolf side even though she wants to be human? If so why does she continue into a life where her wolf side is so hidden? Again, it felt like some big realization or emotional peak was closely missed almost altogether. 

I'm also not a fan of the length/pacing. This movie is just under two hours, but not a whole lot really happens in that time. Some segments feel like they get a huge space of time to be developed even after we already get what's happening (I'm looking at you extended "it's hard to have young kids" montage) and others feel pretty rushed. (particularly the ending) 

It's a good movie, with an excellent premise that looks very nice and has a few interesting time lapse, POV, and other scenes. But beyond that Wolf Children really didn't blow me away like it did so many other people.
>> ARTICLE
All I did after Wolf Children was to go hug my mother, she's raised my brother and I by herself almost single-handedly right after migrating to Australia. The film resonates a lot with me personally so it's one of my top films.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a good film but I can't see any way that it's one of the best 25 anime titles. 

But then again if I wanted a really solid stab at that kind of list I'd assemble a committee of people I trusted and have them fight it out and then write up an opinion with collective responsibility, rather than aggregating the ratings of thousands of randoms.

It's interesting in a kind of anthropological way that thousands of randoms loved Wolf Children to bits.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I accept your opinion, but I disagree.

Let me start by saying that I think that Ghibli is generally overrated. It's sort of funny, because endings are generally where Ghibli falls apart. Miyazaki wants to tie things up too neatly, so the climaxes of his films tends to come out of nowhere, and break the themes and characters of the films just to wrap things up happily. Spirited Away is most egregious for this - no, the film is *not* about the main character's ability to supernaturally sense whether the pigs are her parents what are you even doing Miyazaki!!!

In contrast, I think Hosoda's films have endings that flow naturally out of the themes and characters. Even if this means that they are open ended, or often very unhappy.

The main character of Wolf Children is the mother, Hana. The theme of the story is this core question - can she hold to her resolution that she would allow the wolf children to make their own choices in life, and love them unconditionally for that? Even when the choice is one that she does not want them to make, that takes them away from her? The tension in the story is between that resolution and her desire as a mother to do all that she could possibly can for the children. The story ends when she finalizes this resolution, when the children develop their own choices, when the story moves on from her story to the untold story of these children and how they live the rest of their lives.

The point of the ending is that the viewer occupies the same mental space as Hana. Adulthood comes all too suddenly and against your will. An emotional catharsis is denied. There is no one big realization, only the culmination of small choices that take place without you knowing it. You become only a small part of someone else's story, a story that is denied to you. This is an incredibly brave and personal choice on Hosoda's part, and one big reason I find the film really special. I can understand it not working for everyone though.

(As an aside: Yuki revealing her identity is about the changing of a secret. Her wolf side was previously a secret shared by the three members of the family. Now it's a secret shared with one she loves. Thus, the secret of her wolf side is recontextualised, it's not something that holds her back any more from the human interactions she desires, and so something she resents and fears. But instead it's a moment shared, that binds her *to* those she loves.)
>> ARTICLE
Also something interesting to note is that Hosoda has been clear in interviews that the film is a tribute to his own mother. Yuki and Ame represents himself - the path he felt his mother wanted him to take, and the path that he did take.

>> ARTICLE
I thought the Gintama manga was fairly amusing, but I'm surprised that it rates so high on so many of these lists.
>> ARTICLE
While you don't hear masses of people talking about all the time it's a constant undercurrent. I can't speak about the other sites but on MAL, along with other long shows, it also benefits from the requirement that you need to have seen a fifth of a completed title for your rating to be valid, which means a lot of the people who try and drop it don't register.

I suppose I shall have to try it myself one day.
>> ARTICLE
Where's IMDB? :P.

TIL: Animeplanet has terrible ratings.

All of the website in the list are dedicated to anime while IMDB is just any form of television or movie so it wouldn't have really been a good comparison.

damn. I see gintama everywhere and probably it'll be longer that one piece, those are good news actually. 
>> ARTICLE
Ok, lets do this... Clannad explain it to me. White album 2 is one of my favorite shows, the relationships portrayed in that show feel very genuine and the struggles the characters have make for a incredible show. I know almost nothing about Clannad other than the character designs put me (way) off and from the few screen grabs I have seen it looks like the literal poster child for generic moe blob harem show.

Are the characters well written? Is the setting actually interesting? Is it more than just a love dodecahedron? I think I just need a push to get over my gripes with how the characters look, but as a outsider it seriously just looks like the most generic 90's Harem anime ever.
>> ARTICLE
Its not for everyone, but there is a reason why it is considered a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is rather generic yeah, but its still pretty well writen and the chars are likeable.

Now thw senbd season, Clannad:Afterstory(the one that appears on the tops), it's a whole different beast, while the first 8 ep are rather crappy, when the afterstory kicks in, it just leaves anyone speechless.

It's a family tale, a tale of reconciliation, and the feel trip is otherwordly.

PS: sorry for typos
>> ARTICLE
I literally stopped like 7 or 8 episodes in and haven't touched it yet. It just bored me to death, so I moved on to something else. Maybe I'll give it another try.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't give it another try, I watched the entire two series because people kept saying it got better. 

*It gets better after the Fuko Arc*

*It gets better at AS*

*It gets better in the second half of AS*

*The last few episodes make the series*

Complete waste of time.
>> ARTICLE
I came into afterstory expecting too much (reading all the hype for it) after watching clannad. I was always waiting for that special moment to happen and i was waiting to be impressed for the entire series yet nothing spectacular or minblowing ever happened. Sure there were sad moments but didn't make up for the boring first 15 episodes. So clannad and AS as a whole was a huge disappointment for me.

Do you think it is worth a rewatch in some time to maybe get a different opinion of it?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i have to agree with you, and i didnt even get that much hype, only from my one friend(who got me into seasonal anime) and he loves literally everything japanese. He would basically be a weaboo, except he actually has japanese blood. So obviously i didnt buy into that hype and my reaction was nowhere near as positive as his. I really dont feel like the good emotional shit of the last 2/3rds of AS can justify watching through the mediocrity(imo) of most of the first season and the first 8 episodes of the second. Im only like halfway done making my MAL, and i really have no idea how the fuck im going to score the series.
>> ARTICLE
well overhype can ruin a lot of stuff, so is normal.
It really depends, for me i know it's worth a rewatch since i liked AS a lot, but you need to be conected to the characters, or the feels wont hit home run xD.

I would recommend you to start a rewatch, and if you see yourself in some of the characters, continue watching, if you don't feel any special interaction, it's probably better to just jump to another anime.
>> ARTICLE
If you know little about Clannad, by all means go in and watch it. Hype can a real destroyer for some people, and I'm grateful I watched both seasons of Clannad with an open mind. The character designs did throw me off a bit, but it only took minutes to get over it. I'm by no means well-versed when it comes to these types of shows, but it really packed an emotional wallop with an intelligent story supported by a super strong cast of characters. Honestly, I can only think of a handful of shows that measure up in quality with Clannad. 

Speaking of White Album 2, I'm planning on watching that after I finish K-on! It's been hyped so much to me, but hopefully I can approach it without any major expectations. 
>> ARTICLE
The second half of the second season made people cry so the entire show is amazing, that's what Clannad is.
>> ARTICLE
Did someone say [90's Harlem animation?](http://reenied.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Super-Globetrotters.jpg)

I'm guessing you meant Harem? Clannad is a slice of life comedy, the MC's ok, the girls are ok. The *feels* are forever. It is no where near WA2 in character depth or scope, but if you liked any KyoAni's stuff (K-On, Air, Canaan, Haruhi) then it falls in a similar category.
>> ARTICLE
> Did someone say 90's Harlem animation?

Lol fixed
> The feels are forever

This is the part I have heard about, and the reason I want to watch the show, but can you really feel a emotional kick when all the characters are just "ok." Oh and if the characters in Clannad have half the amount of awesome interactions Kyon and haruhi do then I think Ill enjoy the show quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Kyon x Haruhi is much better imo. But you get a solid first season of interaction followed by a story going legit sad. It puts more effort than most shows. If you've seen AnoHana or Steins;Gate then you'll understand what I mean. 

KyoAni series: Haruhi > Hyouka > Clannad > K-On > the rest. To give you a rough idea of expectations.
>> ARTICLE
The first season is indeed kind of harem-y, with one male raking in chicks by helping them with their problems. It's enjoyable, pretty moe, and gives you intermediate feels. 

However, the second season is much more mature, and deals with the life of the male protagonist beyond high school, and focuses on his relationship with one girl for the most part. The second half of After Story is known as monstrous rollercoaster of emotions, and the feels level is through the roof, which is why it is considered so highly . I without a doubt recommend that you watch the series if you can put aside the art style and generic plot at first. 
>> ARTICLE
Wolf Children and Spirit Away? I feel like anime movies should be in it's own list like most lists when they say the best shows and best movies.

You can think Parasyte is a good anime and still undeserving of Top 25 status.
>> ARTICLE
True enough. Judging by the tone of his message, though, he's obviously not a fan.
>> ARTICLE
The ratings of anime that are still airing are infamously inaccurate. Raters haven't seen the whole show especially the ending (which invariably changes opinions), those people who don't rate shows they haven't completed haven't contributed their opinions and often the sites use different algorithms for determining average ratings while the show is still airing (in particular MAL only counts your rating if you have seen one fifth of the episodes that have been released). Even after long after an anime has finished airing their scores tend to gradually change over time for innumerable reasons.

I would offer the hypothesis that AnimePlanet's Crunchyroll integration is partially to blame for whey the score of Parasyte in particular is so inflated compared to other sites.

Of course that's not to say I think that it should be in a top 25 anime list (at least not so far). But what are you expecting an anime community not to have shit taste?

Hummingbird masterrace!

Hummingbird lost any respect I might of had for it when it listed Avatar as an anime unironically

Depends on how you define Anime.
>> ARTICLE
Anime is animation made in Japan

That's the definition- even this subreddit agrees on that as it's right in the [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_everything_posted_here_must_be_anime_related)
>> ARTICLE
I think it is up to someone's interpretation. But to call one side wrong is well, wrong.
>> ARTICLE
That is *a* definition. Not *the* definition. It may be this sub's chosen definition, but it is not the only (nor widely - meaning outside the anime community) accepted one.

Merriam-Webster (somewhat of an authority on language, at least English) states this as it's definition: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anime). You will notice that the emphasis is on style - one that originated in Japan - but makes no statement that it cannot be produced outside Japan.

Again, regardless of either of our opinions on the definition of anime, it's silly to say that that is the only definition.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't hear any of that, but even if they did at this point, I wouldn't mind it too much. I don't see that as an anime either, but I judge the website for it's overlays, accessibility, ease of access, w/e.

That's an arbitrary reason for losing respect. It's not anime but it's close enough, who cares? 
>> ARTICLE
If I had never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime I would not believe that for a second

They are pretty far from being anime, mind I still like some of those cartoons very much on their own merits.

And there are many other reasons I dislike Hummingbird, the fact that they include non-anime is just one of them.
>> ARTICLE
Ah the old anime argument again. I take it you are in the camp that says anime = cartoons from Japan? If so, I present yet again: Le Maison Petit Cubes... (aka Tsumiki no Ie, aka Pieces of Love) an anime which you would probably say was not anime had you "never seen or heard of any of those shows and had watched them being told they were anime"...

This whole argument is ridiculous tbh, but please do go on and tell me why you think Avatar is not anime while Tsukimi no Ie is.

Episode 6 displayed a clear drop in production value, and Lucifer really didn't play off Satan like all the other main cast members did so well. Episode 7 started entering into pandering and tropes with another character who didn't work well with Satan and Emi's conflict with him losing all it's meaning by turning her into a generic tsundere.

They defeated the big bad guy and all that. It's pretty much what you would expect what would happen. We'll have to see how it develops, though someone who has been reading the original LNs could probably tell us if it gets better or worse from here.

I thought it was going to be action with a slight hint of comedy. Ended up laughing every episode. I didn't mind in the slightest. Great series
>> ARTICLE
the world god only knows - i disregarded the series for a while when it was first airing because i thought the title was ridiculous

long story short, it's now one of my favorite series and is responsible for the only manga that i keep up to date with. a good example of "don't judge a book by it's cover" 
>> ARTICLE
Time to add more to my backlog... I didn't watch TWGOK because of the title, but after seeing some posts about the latest season, I feel obligated to watch it now...
>> ARTICLE
the season they aired last is the best part of the manga so far, just so you know.
>> ARTICLE
36 episodes without the OVAs? hmmmmmm I might be able to fit that into my weekend >_>
>> ARTICLE
You need to watch the ovas as well, if you want the most complete story leading into the latest season, otherwise things will make even less sense (there is a large skip over a lot of story from the manga for the latest season, and the ovas cover a little bit of it at least)
>> ARTICLE
I actually watched it because its title sounded awesome :P

Yeah, same here. Who would think on first blush that the show is all about growing your own harem like a boss?

Madoka Magica. I'm surprised no one has said this yet but I was deceived.

Am I the only one who suspected more from the very beginning? The whole sterile architecture and the way they played with symbolism from the start made me expect something else. Definitely not what I got, but it was clearly no run-of-the-mill mahou shoujo.

I couldn't be deceived at all thanks to reddit. Not to mention the visual are kind of dark too so either way I couldn't be tricked.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with this one. Thought it's your ordianry magical girl anime and decided to not watch it. Then around ep 6 when it was airing, it was getting increasingly popular. So I gave it a shot (story wasn't spoiled for me, so didn't know what I was getting into) and was worth it.

Edit: typo
>> ARTICLE
so, it get's better after episode six? i made it that far, and couldn't push myself any further.
>> ARTICLE
Not exactly. IMO it gets better with every episode after 3rd or so.  
  
Just wanted to emphasize, that I didn't want to watch it at first because I wasn't keen on all that magical girl nonsense. So when I started, half of it has already aired.
>> ARTICLE
You're like half way through why don't you just finish it? It's not even all that bad and it does get pretty good.

You're lucky you got to see it without foreshadowing.

Well the dark turn could be seen from three km away, to be honest.

Only if you watch the OP and ED, which I never do for precisely this reason.

You could definitely tell it was gonna get dark. You just didn't know it was gonna get 'black hole pits of despair' dark instead of 'oh jeez, we lost, mami's hurt and now the witch is loose' that's common in magical girl shows.

I actually expected it to be darker for a larger portion of the series, especially given how dead serious the introductory episodes were.  But a lot of the middle bits were some straight up light-hearted monster-of-the-week hijinks. It threw me for the loop.

Hagure Yuusha no Estetica I expected just another fun fanservice ecchi anime but it had a pretty decent plot and had a badass main character.

I thought it was decent. The MC was a bit too overpowered for my tastes, but it felt like the first season was mostly build-up.

Honestly I loved the show cause the mc acted like a boss and didn't give a damn about what others thought of him or anything he just did his thing and tried to help people, though in a kind of roundabout and perverted way

Suisei no gargantia. Given first episode I expected to see a lot action from the show, but it then turned into a primarily slice of life anime, which disappointed me.

Did you watch the whole series? The SoL part stops around episodes 5-6 ish if i remember correctly, and the rest is actually really really good.

I did watch the whole thing, but the amount of SoL was still more than I would have liked.

Kokoro Connect. Having only seen a screenshot of "I've also masturbated to you.", figured it would just be another dumb ecchi. Got a great show with some very endearing characters. And Inaba is love. 
>> ARTICLE
This show was my answer as well. started watching it due to interesting concept and cool characters from the first episode, never finished it due to crushing fear of how accurately it portrays my faults and personality traits in every character.
>> ARTICLE
Aaah c'mon...finish it. It's neat. But yeah read the description on crunchyroll when searching slice of life and geared up for a comedy. Ah well.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I made it decently far, up to the first episode where they act on their desires. I just couldn't handle it after that. leaving Inaba alone in that room, the next episode titled "Falling Apart" I don't think I am mentally stable enough to handle continuing the show. I am legit frightened by it. (I will someday, I figure since I can relate to nearly every single character flaw it would be good to see how it ends up)
>> ARTICLE
Flaws aren't what give people or characters their depth or charm. Buuuut, it can't be helped if the parallel induces anxiety. Seeing reflections prolly shouldn't be so scary even if they're figurative, not literal. Spoiler alert, the next set of twists is more neat than the urges.

Well I haven't been much into anime since quite a few years. I got sucked into Attack on Titan however after watching the first episode and when I was reading threads about "best animes" Neon Genesis Evangelion was mentioned a lot.

Now I have barely any interest in mechs fighting (Pacific Rim bored me to no end for example) and thus, knowing barely anything, didn't expect much from Evangelion.  
Then, the more I watched the more I realized it's primarily about characterization and there's just an insane amount of possible interpretation. Well, since I marathon watched all 26 episodes within 2 days, I was actually just wondering "the fuck is this even..." when I watched episode 25 and 26 at like 3a.m.  
However the more I read about Evangelion on e.g. eva geeks and the more I watched (End of Evangelion for example) the more I appreciated it. By now I absolutely love the ending of episode 26.
>> ARTICLE
I cannot understand how people like Eva. Literally the only good thing it does is action. Most characters are just tropes and the symbolism is so forced it's annoying. 
>> ARTICLE
It was the subversion of all of the standard tropes of the day.  Look at it as a sort of a "Great Expectations" of the anime mecha genre.

The main character has a tortured past, and it shows.  It spits in the face of the "forever courageous and all that" characters who never had a good excuse to be that way.  It was a more skeptical view of the traditional mecha genre.

Sure, robotec tried to do the same in some ways, but their protagonist was still the Mary Sue pilot of doom.  They tried to have a serious story but it devolved into... well, awesome, but a very different kind of awesome.

Sure, Nadesico tried it, but they just ended up telling you that you shouldn't live your life like it's a mecha anime.

Compared to a lot of modern anime it's a bit lacking but it really was a revolution when it was made.  And for a lot of people it was the first serious anime they'd ever seen, which gives it the nostalgia spot in their memory.
>> ARTICLE
Out of everything I've read about it that makes the most sense. It's just most of the characterization I've seen done before.
>> ARTICLE
You could just be feeling a "Seinfeld isn't funny" feeling.

It's the same thing people get when they hear that Citizen Kane is the best movie ever made or Half-Life 2 is the greatest game ever made. So many anime have borrowed or used themes and characters from Evangelion, so now people accustomed to all these elements don't see the hype over the original. 

If it helps, you could watch the remakes. 1.11, 2.22 and 3.33 are all out and take a really interesting route that strays from the initial series about halfway into 2.22. 
>> ARTICLE
I'd be willing to do that. Does it have the bullshit from the last two episodes? Because I couldn't even finish 26. Absolutely hated those parts. Anything they're trying to say could have been done in a better way.
>> ARTICLE
It hasn't finished yet, 4.44 is still on the horizon. It does still get weird, but it feels like the weird has a purpose instead of the stream of consciousness you get in the last two episodes of the series. 
>> ARTICLE
Also funding.
>> ARTICLE
Great exchange here! I'd also recommend End of Evangelion. Not really for the stream of consciousness parts that also occur, but the action and third impact scenes are images I'll never forget. Anyhow, the Rebuild movies are filled with some great high-tension mecha goodness.
>> ARTICLE
You should check out FLCL, short, intense, (some mecha) made by the same people
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the suggestion, I may give it a go at some point.
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion is the Watchmen of mecha. 

It's one thing to read Watchmen fresh from comic books about Superman's super-knitting and super-ventriloquism, it's another thing to read it decades later when it changed the industry forever.
>> ARTICLE
> comic books about Superman's super-knitting and super-ventriloquism, it's another thing to read it decades later when it changed the industry forever.

Yeah, I learned to read on my brothers comicbook collection, so when I read Watchmen I was like WTF?!?!?

* Arcana Famiglia - Thought it would be a cool, action-oriented series but instead, got a boring romantic triangle and episodes dedicated to flashbacks. Whatever action there was could only be found in the first and last episodes, and it was brief and unexciting.
* Hunter x Hunter - Thought it would be really childish and a very typical shounen series. What I got was an exciting story, likeable characters, some darker storylines further in, and some aversions to the usual tropes associated with shounen.
* Attack on Titan - Dammit, people really hyped this one up for me. I expected a unique, intelligent, and mind-blowing series. I got an entertaining, well-animated series that is slightly above average but falls prey to several typical shounen tropes (i.e. Eren getting through difficult situations through willpower rather than any particular skill or strategy).
* Bokurano - Thought it was going to be a story about mechs fighting each other, which it still technically is. However, I didn't expect it to be a character-driven story that will bring the viewer to tears every other episode.

You said it. It's quite sad because the first episode was representative of the kind of show it should have been: a dark, gritty tale of survival. The biggest annoyance was the overdramatization of simple events later on in the show.
>> ARTICLE
Just powered through Attack on Titan after having my friends jizz all over themselves about it the past few months. I don't get it. It's okay. Worth the watch. Better than Naruto. That's about it. What really threw me off is it obviously felt like it was rushing towards the action but then you get like a 10 second clip of someone dying then a minute or two of people looking super depressed and surprised. "I mean, I know I watched 50 OTHER people get eaten by these things and we're out in the open surrounded by them but HOW was I supposed to know I'd lose another comrade? Shocking!"
>> ARTICLE
I don't think knowing that your friend has a high chance of dying makes it much less painful when they do. Also I think a big point of the series is that none of the soldiers are shocked by death anymore. Yeah the hate that it happens, but the whole show has a sense of crushing hopelessness. And every time someone has a glint of hope, that's when some shit goes down and destroys that hope
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion, it's one of those shows that is really easy to get caught up in while watching it the first time, but it doesn't really hold up if you analyze anything or rewatch it. It is pure eye candy, and it's a lot of fun, but don't watch it expecting anything too deep or well-written. I like it for what it is.
>> ARTICLE
This. Hyped anime suffer from this all the time. I wouldn't watch Seinfeld like I would watch Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I wouldn't watch Attack on Titan like I would watch Eva. For what it is, pretty action, AoT reaches the hype. Best anime of all time? No. Of the season? No. Damn good action? Yes.

Chihayafuru, expected boring card games, instead got one of the best anime of 2011, hoping for more.

I watched the first episode, and I gotta tell you.... I practically fell asleep while watching it.

So you're saying it does get better?
>> ARTICLE
When dropping an anime, give it 3 episodes. The first episode can be better than the rest of the series(all of the budget went into the first ep) or worse than the rest(slow start,to much set up). But with 3 episodes, you can usually get a feel for how the anime will be overall. Although some anime are exceptions(the second half of stiens;gate was different and frankly better than the first half)

Genshiken. I thought it would be just another cookie-cutter slice-of-life otaku comedy, but I ended up being really impressed by the realism and the depth of the characters.

I expected Great Teacher Onizuka to be a dumb perverted comedy. It ended up being beautiful.  
  
I expected Spice & Wolf to be a juvenile romance story with no development where the 2 main characters just fought all the time and their relationship never progressed. It ended up being fantastic.  
  
I expected Angel Beats to be "lol randumb" and it ended up being extremely touching if a little bit cheesy.  
  
I expected Yu Yu Hakusho to be a cheap DBZ knockoff and it ended up being one of my favorite shounen ever.  
  
I expected Gunslinger Girl to be a dumb thing that I couldn't take seriously, a melodramatic poorly-written excuse to show off young girls with guns, and it ended up being really great and very easy to take seriously.  
  
I expected Welcome to the NHK to be silly and insane and nonstop dream-sequences and goofy hallucinations of the main character, and it ended up being one of the inspiring forces behind a lot of decisions I made and stuck to after seeing it.  
  
Those are all shows I had saw and skimmed over a million times when going through MAL to find the next show I would watch. When I finally just said 'Fuck it' and gave them a try, I ended up loving them a lot.

I watched Angel Beats! right after Clannad and After Story. I don't know if my feels were just dulled but it felt like they were trying WAY too hard to made you feel sad in it. The only episode I felt anything was the baseball episode.

The pacing was complete ass. It should've been over 20 episodes instead...
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, Clannad AS tries the hardest to manipulate the viewer's emotions out of any anime that I have seen. I agree with you though, Angel Beats is not very sad. It is incredibly forced. Maybe if it had been longer then it would've had more of an impact.

To me the difference is Clannad gives you a puppy and then comes back two weeks later and murders it in front of you. Angel Beats! gives you a puppy and then kills it right then and there.

For me it would have to be Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I had never watched the 2003 series either and knew nothing about it, except that the main character had a red coat and blonde hair. For some reason I had a picture in my head of him being tall and thought it was some kind of Mecha anime which I have never been a big fan of. My friend had given it to me, so I had it on my computer and it was a time where I had no internet for a while, so I had nothing to do. I had no way of looking into it it at all with no internet so I just went right into it. Boy was I surprised by how much I loved it.

* Haibane Renmei

* Aku no Hana.  Whatever I was expecting, it wasn't this.

* Bakemonogatari

* Cowboy Bebop.  Was expecting a great long emotional epic, got an episodic format.

* Gunslinger Girl.  The last "girls with guns" show I'd watched was Upotte!!.  While I knew it would be very different to that (given that it's always on those recommendation charts that have artsy "deep" stuff), I still wasn't expecting robotic personalities.

* Kotoura-san.  The first 15 minutes were very misleading as an indicator of the rest of the series.

* Little Witch Academia.  This was incredibly hyped, and after the kickstarter went through the roof, I decided to watch it.  Not really sure what makes it different from anything else, other than it's Trigger and was kickstarted successfully.

* Evangelion.  I'd seen nothing of this before going in, except for being able to recognise the three pilots.

* Ore Imo.  This actually ended up how I was initially worried it would, but that was only after season 1 made me think I was wrong.

* Origin: Spirits of the Past.  It looks quite a bit like Ghibli, and was for the first half.  The second half was like Dreamworks trying to do Ghibli - much more simple thematically.

* Suisei no Gargantia.  After seeing the first half of episode 1, I was worried it was going to pretty much be a mecha (not a fan of mecha).

* Red Data Girl.  First of all, I expected something to happen.  6 episodes later, still felt like nothing had happened or been explained properly -> dropped.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes - I remember watching the first episode and wanting to dump it so bad, compared to other anime's the animation was dated - yet I gave myself the 'watch 3 episodes and then rate'. After 3 episodes I couldn't stop, I watched till the end. I literally binged on LOGH and it was glorious. To this day no other anime comes close to this space saga of epic proportions. 

One thing I have learned is that the power of story, and good characters are the most important points of an anime. Hence, these days, I still check out older anime's and have come across some of the good old classics (VOTOMS and the early Gundam Titles).

still loved that movie though (even because of that scene as well) and i consider it top-KnK with Mujun Rasen 2nd best.
>> ARTICLE
SAO. Expected a lot of action and good fight scenes. Got a lot of talking. Oh so much talking

Also a very shitty "romance" with a side of incest and nerd wish-fulfillment.

Welcome to the NHK. 

Really changed my perspective on how I was trying to blame everyone else for my problems and think there was some sort of societal shit going down where everyone is against me.

I'm glad that it's not the case that I think that way and try to absolve myself for all the blame in my shit life, but eh, I'm doing better now than I was then.
>> ARTICLE
I remember I was in a similar rut. I'm glad to hear that an anime actually improved the way you view life as a whole. It's difficult to step and deal with shit rather than just toss the blame on other shit. Much respect homie. 
>> ARTICLE
Welcome to the NHK is really an interesting anime. I think different people take different things from the show. Personally it sort of made me realize that I used to be lazy and everything because people enabled me to be that way (sort of like how the protagonist was able to live alone and sleep all day due to money from his parents). Even the author of nhk is still facing problems since he's being able to live off of royalties from his novel and everything. 


Another thing I got out of the show was that lots of people are fucked up on the inside- even if they don't appear to be. All the characters we got to know in the show had internal struggles- it can be nice knowing that you're not the only one who has to struggle with your emotions. I feel like I'm not explaining my thoughts really well- this show is definitely due for a rewatch soon.

Clannad and After Story made me appreciate all the sacrifices parents go through for their children. 
>> ARTICLE
Been meaning to watch those but I really can't get past the character designs. That's good though cause parents are usually not even mentioned in most animes. 
>> ARTICLE
You'll get used to the character designs within 4 to 5 episodes. If not, then you don't have to continue watching it.

As a whole, Clannad will make you experience many emotions. Youll laugh, youll cry, and you might even be frustrated at times yet Clannad is an anime that is worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely next show I watch next time I'm feeling like investing into a show since its kinda long. 
>> ARTICLE
If you do plan on watching the first season, then you won't have to worry about investing or anything, since that part is more of a pick-up-and-put-down slice-of-life go-at-your-own-pace deal.
>> ARTICLE
Alright perfect, is Clannad AS more of a continuous story that I should watch in a row or is it similar to the first season?
>> ARTICLE
It is certainly more dramatic, so I think you would benefit from watching it the way you were talking about before. By the time you get there, however, I imagine you will be immersed enough in the story to ignore the "daunting" nature of Clannad as a saga.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. Next show for me then.
>> ARTICLE
It's a continuation to Season 1 but completely opposite in terms of the overall tone of Season 1.


>> ARTICLE
I'll definitely check em both out then. Thanks homie.
>> ARTICLE
Reccomend that u watch season 1 first for the important backstory and character development then watching season 2 to get the full impact of the feels
>> ARTICLE
I do love me some good feels.
>> ARTICLE
No problem, hope you enjoy it when you do.
>> ARTICLE
I hated the character designs at first too but you honestly get used to it by like the 2nd or 3rd episode. It's 110% worth watching! 
>> ARTICLE
I need to start watching this for my own sake. 
>> ARTICLE
> all the sacrifices parents go through for their children. 

It may not be my favorite anime series but I do appreciate what it was trying to do, especially with this message.
>> ARTICLE
I think my favorite quote is from the first season of Clannad when Aiko says "A child's dream IS their parent's dream." Really sums up the theme of the series quite well.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah. And I also feel Tomoya's relationship with his father is as equally important. He may not be the best parent but he's been through a lot.

Shit, I might want to rewatch this show sometime.
>> ARTICLE
The way they explore their relationship is so touching and heartbreaking. All of it is heartbreaking though so that's why I'm not rewatching it any time soon...
>> ARTICLE
[Clannad AS](/s 'The scene where Tomoya reconciles with his father')

Fucking tears everytime.
>> ARTICLE
That was the most relatable scene in the whole series for me. 
>> ARTICLE
Ugh that kills me just reading it ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Shinsekai Yori made me think a lot about what it means to be human. The natural selection was also part of the reflexion.

After watching the fourth episode I got all depressed because I was afraid something as tragic - based on the fear of others - would happen in our future. I had dropped the anime for about 1 month, then I watched all the episodes in two days. It's a touching story, I think I've never seen something so... true!

In the end I understood I shall not feel bad for the bad actions men perpetrated in our History, nor for the bad things some may do in the future, some powers - like desire -  cannot be controlled.
>> ARTICLE
Added it to my PTW when I was going through a phase of watching mega-depressing anime. But seeing that it's a believable kind of sadness I'll definitely check it out. 
>> ARTICLE
It's still a science fiction show, but it's specifically the background story that made me think the most.

As in what's happening in the background of the main plot?

As in the world where the main plot takes place.

*Shirobako* thought me to appreciate the anime I watch, because making it was probably damn brutal.

I had assumed office politics and creative differences would get in the way, and I was right; but I failed to account in tight deadlines, outsourcing troubles, retakes, and [Minor second half spoilers](/s "obnoxious manga editors.")

I was also under the impression the process went all digital with the advent of computers (using Flash and such), but I was surprised to learn they still use paper to draw the keyframes.

Here's the big one for me: it is hinted throughout the series that Ema, the newbie animator, is [Very minor character spoiler](/s "living in poverty, or at least not making much money.") Looking into how animators are paid (2-5$ per frame; [average income is 9,200$/month](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-15/study-animators-earned-usd28000-on-average-in-japan-in-2013/.87762)) kinda depressed me - one because I was feeling sympathetic for the character, and second because being an animator sounds brutally difficult and demanding. Really a dream job.
>> ARTICLE
I started that show and got to about episode 4 but semi dropped it cause it felt like not much was really happening, although I did really learn to appreciate how anime is made and be thankful for how much effort is pumped into making the shows I love. Would you recommend I finish it?
>> ARTICLE
Shirobako is a show about adults being adults. It's about short stories and small, personal triumphs. If you don't like the show because the conflicts and situations aren't big enough for you, that's perfectly fine. It's a niche show, but it's well written and has some hard-hitting drama, personally. You'll also learn a much about the anime production process.

I will admit, it starts slow, but it picks up. Also, I know there are many characters to stomach but they're all distinct enough that you'll get to know them quickly.
>> ARTICLE
I'll give it another shot if you say it picks up later. It is also a interesting to have a show about adults and not middle-high schoolers. 
>> ARTICLE
By "it picks up" I mean the pacing picks up. It's still very grounded in reality and you're not going to find anything life-threatening. Shirobako really stands on its characters and their personal struggles, though, and each has ups and downs as with anybody. 

So I say keep watching for a bit. If you like it, more power to you. If not, I'm glad to hear you appreciated the concept behind it and gave it a shot.
>> ARTICLE
I always do love to give anime a fair shot. I'll rarely call a show shitty, unless it really is complete crap. I didn't like your lie in april for example, but I can still appreciate that its a quality show.
>> ARTICLE
Silver Spoon. I don't take food granted, appreciate it more and prefer more natural products and non-processed meat.  

Sakamichi No Apollon. I appreciate my friends a lot more now and it made me a fan of Jazz music.  

>> ARTICLE
A big thing about this thread, and your comment really made me realize it is how little anime I've even heard of. I had never heard of Silver Spoon but after looking it up it seems cool. Sakamichi I've heard of and I definitely want to check it cause the art style seems great, and the overall atmosphere and music seem like something I'd love. And appreciation of friends is something I've definitely struggled with so I think I'll check it out for sure. 
>> ARTICLE
I wholeheartly recommend them both. Sakamichi no Apollon was on my mind for days after watching it. It's not your usual friendship themed anime, Sakamichi explores even the hard parts of it. Basically the whole spectrum and how a good friendship lasts through years. Not to mention there is a great romance story in it too. The art and animation quality is also top notch paired with soothing jazz.  

I watched Silver Spoon without any background info. As it happens the manga is from the author of FMA. It's a good feel anime that made me smile during every episode but it also has this deep theme of ethics and different points of view. It has a lot more depth than you would initially think.
>> ARTICLE
In terms of sakamichi, I understand the romance is there, but do the people actually start dating or not? Weird question but I'm tired of getting blue balled by anime in terms of romance and lately i've looking for anime where the people actually start dating rather than some lewd hand holding or something. 
>> ARTICLE
You've come to the right place then. The romance in Sakamichi has a great conclusion. The MC is also very straightforward with his love interest. I also suggest reading the 4 last chapters + bonus chapter of the manga. The anime is paced great overall but I always suggest reading the manga ending after the anime cause it'll extend it and make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful. Muchas Gracias. I've been in dire need considering I literally just go blue balled tonight by hori-san to Miyamura-kun.

No problem. Enjoy!

Cliche I guess but Neon Genesis Evangelion, it didn't exactly change my perspective but it changed my way of thinking a little. The part during the human instrumentality project where it says something along the lines of "If you think of rainy days as being bad then they're automatically going to be bad", it really stuck with me for some reason, whenever I'm feeling pessmistic about something I just remember that.
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting because I think like that a lot. A situation will only become a negative one if you really let it become that bad and it's amazing how big of an aspect the way you view a situation can make it seem. I have it downloaded but haven't gotten to watching it, cause i've never really been a big fan of mech anime, even though its a classic.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's definitely made more optimistic. 

I'm not a fan of mecha anime at all but I gave NGE 10/10, despite hating the genre I think it incorporated it really well.

I'll get to watching that eventually. It's good to hear that you enjoyed it despite not liking the genre.

Code Geass got me to ponder the phrase "means to an end" for a good few weeks. Like, people can have good intentions but exercise questionable, even evil acts to achieve their intent. Also, revolutions. At what point is a violent revolution hypocritical? Code Geass answered these for me, but left them open-ended at the same time. Oh, how I love that anime.
>> ARTICLE
A classic that a lot of people talk about very glowingly that I'll have to watch. Me and my friends talk about that subject a lot and so I'll definitely need to watch this to get a good perspective on it. How do you feel about 'means to an end' if the means may be unethical?

Paranoia Agent once again.

Accepting responsibility and facing your fears. Actions like these made me realise how society doesn't favour those who just sit-back and be passive. In other words, you can't take the "easy way" out when there's risk involved. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh i absolutely agree. Gonna definitely have to check it out now. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
That and the anime's purpose was to discuss a social issue in Japan. The writer believes that Japan's current culture of wanting cute, moe and silly characters aswell as idols and super heroes is a result of Japan experiencing culture shock after they went from a nationalist military power to a conquered nation. The Little Slugger character is a fiction/urban legend that grows as people blame things on him. In fact many of the characters in the anime act strange because they are unable to handle social issues and must look for either an excuse or alter identity.
>> ARTICLE
Oreimo, because of the whole accepting and embracing your passions and who you are. Before that show, I had a mentality like "oh I like watching anime, but I'm not like those people who dress up in cosplay and decorate their living space with anime goods". But I watched the first season just before I went to my second convention, and it convinced me to go all out and have fun and get some posters and figures and put them on display.

You are the only one who can save yourself. Praying for change, hoping for things to get better, or sinking into apathetic despair - nothing will help. Use everything you have, think, observe, recognise your situation, and change. Never give up.

Jeez, sounds like something Oshino from Monogatari would say. 
>> ARTICLE
And I'm a firm believer of everything that show seems to be preaching. I also love the way it seems that the character keeps getting himself way too deep into shit, which is something I always do to myself, so I feel like I'd relate on some level. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember a particular one, but after years watching anime i have known how to stay neutral to other's opinion (I want to say it more clearly but my english is bad, sorry).

Everyone have their own tastes, and if our view is different in the beginning, there's no way we can understand each other.

If it's me before, i would have rage up and give a 2 hours lecture about anything that didn't fit my thoughts

But now i don't even bother if my friend says "I don't like show with female protagonists, they're weak (for no reason)" anymore.

I understand and don't worry your English is bad at all. I'm the same as you in the way that I'll get angry and rant about anything that I don't agree with, but I've slowly been improving and not let the little things get to me.

Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

Maybe it doesn't fit but basically I used to be really downtrodden and upset constantly. Being angry and negative in my heart was just my default state, I just couldn't be happy or content with who I was or where I was in life. 

Then a couple years back I watched Gurren Lagann for the first time and that changed. There wasn't any big conscious change like thinking "I need to be cooler like Kamina or optimistic like Simon" or anything like that, just a little while after watching it I realised I was able to take life less seriously and just enjoy it. I guess the biggest thing is that Gurren Lagann was so obscenely cool it made me stop being a moody little kid and start actually developing some of my own moral standards and self-confidence.

I'm actually watching TTGL right now (I have episode 9 on pause). I already kinda knew I was in for a big ride, but I guess now it's an even bigger ride.

Kill la Kill also had a similar effect to me, in the sense that its over the top presentation and badassness kinda made me stop taking things so seriously and just enjoy stuff. I guess Trigger knows how to hit the mark with shows like that. 
>> ARTICLE
Surprised no one has said Psycho-Pass
>> ARTICLE
In what way did it change your perspective?
>> ARTICLE
Anime and stories (no matter which medium) generally portray good and evil very clearly. What struck me most was how clearly Psycho Pass managed to really make me consider the definitions of those two sides. The Sybil system is [Spoilers](/s "the overarching antagonist") but as unethical as it is by our standards today, it also brought about an era of security and peace for the general population. So should we then judge Sybil by its nature or its actions? It is an evil means to a good end. Other grey areas were also in parallelism throughout the series such as the Enforcers; they have the mind of a criminal but choose to protect instead of harm. In the end, Psycho Pass made me more conscious of how society judges people and how the world isn't conveniently separated into good and evil but rather varying degrees of both.
>> ARTICLE
I think this is illustrated well in the dilemma that Akane faces in the final episodes of the show where [Psycho-Pass)] (/s "she knows the true nature of Cybil is unethical and an unsustainable justice system but if she revealed its true nature to the public, there would be anarchy. So she continues working under the system in order to guarantee order" ) It's very much a "lesser of two evils" scenario.
>> ARTICLE
> It is an evil means to a good end. 

This is similar to another comment in this thread that mentioned Code Geass in the same manner, do evil means justify a good end. A very interesting concept that isn't tackled in a very shonen heavy anime world right now.
>> ARTICLE
Tatami Galaxy.
>> ARTICLE
In what way?
>> ARTICLE
Tatami Galaxy is about a guy called Watashi who's a third year college student and, in his own words, "an idiot beyond all redemption." Upon entering college he was a hopeless romantic with a head full of ideas about how he was going to make so many friends and meet beautiful girls, but he quickly discovered that it was easier said than done, missed the boat on forming social circles, and before he knew it two years had gone by and he had wasted his young adult life. This describes me more or less perfectly. 

Watashi meets a man who claims to be a god from a nearby shrine, and is given the chance to rewind time to the beginning of college and start again to do things the right way. He is confident that he knows exactly what went wrong in his life and that it will be easy to fix his mistakes... but it turns out that it's not that simple, and as his life falls apart again he is forced to repeat the same two years over and over. Again, this felt unnervingly similar to how I transferred out of my first school at the end of freshman year and expected to do much better in a new place, only to fall back into the exact same terrible habits.

I watched this show all in one day, at the end of a week where I did not go to a single class and barely even left my room except to eat. It was probably one of the lowest points, emotionally, I have ever found myself at. And this show turned it around. Tatami Galaxy is simultaneously one of the most bizarre and most believable stories I have ever seen. School clubs, cute girls, cults and secret societies, bicycle-stealing gorilla-men, sex dolls, cartoon cowboys, parallel universes, and more are all intricately tied together into a single overarching narrative that is slowly revealed, bit by bit, as Watashi relives it again and again. It's a [beautifully experimental work](http://theglorioblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/tatami_11.jpg) in terms of art and cinematography, a masterpiece of storytelling, hilariously clever, deeply emotional, and deceptively complex. I literally pumped my fist into the air with happiness and excitement when it ended. I can't recommend it enough.
>> ARTICLE
I've heard great things about this show but never in this much detail. I love really out-there shows in terms of presentation (monogatari being my favourite series of all time) and so I've always felt that this show was always right up my alley. I'm really loving the fact that you related to this show and took it almost as a sign to fix yourself, which takes big balls. I'm glad to hear you're in a better place. And I'll definitely watch this show.  
>> ARTICLE
It was pretty recent, so I still have some turning around to do! But Monogatari was my favorite show for years, and Tatami Galaxy swept it away in an instant. Then just this weekend, the most recent Monogatari episode included a prominent Tatami Galaxy reference. Pretty nice timing.
>> ARTICLE
Damn convenient timing. A complaint I've heard about tatami galaxy is that the character exposition is hella fucking fast. Did you feel like it was?
>> ARTICLE
You need to be a fast reader. The MC's internal monologue moves at top speed. It doesn't really affect the quality of the show at all though.

Edit: Unless you mean the characters are introduced really fast? In which case I think that's fair to say at first, but since the same people keep coming up every cycle that Watashi goes through, you'll become familiar with them very quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i meant that fast reader part. I haven't had any trouble with monogatari, and I can't imagine it'd be much faster than that.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like I'm going to have to watch tatami galaxy tonight, your recommendation was more than convincing
>> ARTICLE
This is so awesome to read. Sometimes you feel like an anime is *made* for you and it seems like Tatami Galaxy is exactly what you needed to watch at the right time. Makes me glad a story like this exists in the first place :)

It was one of those crazy moments when you finish a show and it makes you wonder if anything else you've ever seen was *really* a 10/10.

Yuasa is a genius and Tatami Galaxy is most likely his Magnum opus so far. I can't wait for his next project.
>> ARTICLE
Can you point me to anything else he's done?

Pretty much what /u/Ralon17 said. The point of Yuasa is that everything he touches feels very special yet solid at the same time, it's like pure inspiration. He uses different artstyles and storytelling techniques and still manages to write some of the most human chacacters and intelligent dialogue I've seen. 

(Only watched Ping Pong, Tatami and half of Kaiba)

He's done [**Kaiba**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3701/Kaiba?q=kaib), and [**Kemonozume**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1454/Kemonozume?q=kemono). He was also the director of the amazing [**Ping Pong the Animation**](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_The_Animation), which I'd highly recommend if you haven't seen in.

I think it was more that it made me take a good look on my life and say to myself "Am I that dude on the screen?". It was scary just how well 8man's monologues resonated with me.

Princess Mononoke: Ok sorry a film not a series, but if you have seen it you know seeing this film at a very young changed the way my brain worked and the way I perceive the world I think the best compliment you could give it is that its the lord of the rings of anime. Of corse everything Myazaki did was a fantastic accomplishment, but when i think of him i think of that movie.
>> ARTICLE
I was never a fan of Ghibli films when I was young but I'll definitely watch it now and see if it will change the way my brain works. How did it change the way yours work?
>> ARTICLE
Ill say Ghibli always brings something great when they come out with a film but Princess mononoke is probably the best starter if you want to get into those films a great story, and incredible visuals you really feel like your in the world i say more so than Avatar honestly. It changed the lines of impossible in my head gave me a good understanding of how to build a fantasy world.
>> ARTICLE
Avatar didn't do much for me in all honesty but I understand what you're saying when it comes to world building and visuals. Guess since I'm a little older I'll watch it. Thanks for the recommendation. 
>> ARTICLE
Your lie in April [ spoilers I guess 
] 
(/s " really changed 
my life by making me appreciate everything around me more as you will never know how long they will be there with you. It makes me understand how it feels like to lose someone dear to you and you will never expect it. You think you will be fine but you are never fine. It also shows that everyone appears in your life for a reason and you don't even realize it. I love this anime and will always reccomend it to anyone " 
)

>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately I really couldn't get into that show despite it being one of my best friend's favourites. But I can still appreciate that it had a good message and that it was a high quality work overall.
>> ARTICLE
May sound weird or edgy, but whenever I think about organ donation, i end up thinking about angel beats. 
>> ARTICLE
Guess I'll need to watch it to understand why that's relevant. Were you not a fan of organ donation before it or something?
>> ARTICLE
Nope. I just hadn't thought about organ donation much more I didn't really care.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad Afterstory, Usagi Drop, Nagi no Asukara. 

Gotta appreciate the struggles that parents go through, this became clear to me after watching Clannad Afterstory and Usagi Drop. The topic of "change" from NagiAsu made me realize how little time there is in life. I realized I've wasted so much time and now I feel like shit. 

Edit: I understand more of the responsibilities of adults in a working environment after watching Shirobako. 
>> ARTICLE
Adults are very often only used as a means to move the plot along so I am definitely a fan of Usagi Drop in the way it shows the struggles of parents, and how they look at it positively. Made me really appreciate my parents being there for me. 
>> ARTICLE
The Tatami Galaxy - I was always looking back to the past thinking about thingsthat I a could change to make my life better always regretting my decisions but not anymore I learned to appreciate the life I had, look past the hardships and remembering the good parts .
>> ARTICLE
And it takes some real mental fortitude to be able to look past the hardships and just appreciate what has happened and think positively about what will happen. This show seems to have had a profound effect on a lot of people. Will definitely have to watch it now.
>> ARTICLE
I guess it hasn't really changed my views on the world as a whole, but Bakuman changed the way I see the manga industry. I used to think that anyone could come at anytime and write whatever they want and basically be set for life with little to no work.  
  
And even though it's not *that* realistic, Bakuman showed me that a lot of work goes into those twenty pages that I take for granted and that those people that make the series we enjoy don't even get rest most of the time.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like many shows touch upon how much work goes into making manga, although its usually a side character who is always dreary eyed and complaining about a deadline. I really dig the art style for bakuman and I've been meaning to check it out. Is it similar to shirobako in the sense that there are a lot of mini stories and trials or is it one continuous arc per season?
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Shirobako yet so I can't say of they're similar or not. But it is one continous story. I especially like the characters of Bakuman, there are a lot of characters including mangakas, editors, assistants, voice actors and other students and such.
>> ARTICLE
Any type of romance sub-plot?
>> ARTICLE
Well, the main character only started writing manga because the girl he likes encouraged him to do so, so there's quite a bit of romance.
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful. I'll watch it tonight.
>> ARTICLE
The weirdest one for me was Gundam Wing turned me against drone warfare, with how the self piloted mechs where used and with trays line "Remember this for the future; a war with no civility only gives rise to massacre." still hitting home today 
>> ARTICLE
Crazy to think a show from 1995 would still have topics that are an important topic of conversation today. Very good indication of quality.
>> ARTICLE
Paranoia Agent made me think a lot more about how desires for escapism can become unhealthy. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm a fairly regular drug user so I can definitely relate to themes of escapism and how unhealthy it is.

Psycho pass.

A man can dream that hatsune miku becomes our supreme overlord.

I, for one, welcome our waifu overlords.

That's why we watch anime. To prepare for our waifu overlords. 
>> ARTICLE
Bakuman completely altered my views on the manga industry and really makes me respect (and in some ways pity) manga artists/writers. It has also reignited my interest in reading manga. 
>> ARTICLE
I recently got into drawing with a tablet and stuff, and seeing how long it takes me to just doodle out a piece of shit, I'm amazed by some of the talent these people have to pump out these works on a weekly basis. Definitely gonna watch it.
>> ARTICLE
Death Parade and Psycho-Pass made me rethink the way I judge people. It made me aware that society is always judging people when they're at their absolute worst. 

We always assume that criminals are either inhumane beasts raised without morals, or mentally unstable. But in reality, we can all become criminals. It's just a matter of your circumstances and how far you need to be pushed before you break. 
>> ARTICLE
The first episode of death parade really fucked with my head. It's true that society really only judges a person when the spotlight is on them, and it's very easy to get it on you for something stupid. It really does come down to circumstances and the amount of shit life throws at you.
>> ARTICLE
Oregairu. Screw society. A bunch of the monologues really hit the nail on the head.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely felt the same way about a lot 8mans monologues and that really made me realize I needed to change my view of life and so far things have been pretty good. 
>> ARTICLE
This might sound weird, butttt...[Golden Boy](http://myanimelist.net/anime/268/Golden_Boy)

The whole concept of my main man Kintarou always being open minded towards learning anything and everything he can. A lot can be said for going into an unknown situation with an open mind and the will to enjoy whatever may happen. 

I may have a college degree, but I'll be damned if I haven't been taught something important by every single 'fuck up' that I've met. You gotta treat everyone politely, learn what you can from anywhere/anyone, and never take yourself too seriously. That's what Golden Boy taught me!

This anime is for watching duing the summer holidays

I came in here fully expecting this to be the top answer. And yeah, sure, it's high up, but it needs to be *the top answer*, dammit!
>> ARTICLE
For what it is worth, about 10 hours ago it was at the top.

I haven't seen Barakamon, but I imagine it is a proper answer as well.

I've seen it, it's actually great and it does make you feel good. But not as great and feel-goody as NNB!

Acchi Kocchi, Yuru Yuri and K-On for me
>> ARTICLE
Both Acchi Kocchi and K-ON had me giggling like a schoolgirl that just got invited to prom by the guy of her dreams.

I'll give Yuri Yuri a watch.
>> ARTICLE
Mio is love. Mio is life.
>> ARTICLE
started learning the base because of her I was undecided between base and guitar and well mio is life.
>> ARTICLE
When referring to the guitar (or fish) it is spelled "bass". Hope you enjoy learning it,  it is truly an amazing instrument,  especially if listen to some of the solo artists (like some of Victor Wooten and Stu Hamm's work). 
>> ARTICLE
You're right, I knew that and I have failed. Thanks my cousin is going to teach me I find a lot of people don't appreciate the bass. For any refrence I played the tuba and various other instruments that were back up to the melodies.
>> ARTICLE
Mugi!!!
>> ARTICLE
Yui only, no items, music room.

>no items

Not even tea? 
>> ARTICLE
Ooh! Acchi Kocchi put a smile on my face every week when it aired. :D
>> ARTICLE
Gekkan-Shoujou Nozaki-kun is pretty chill
>> ARTICLE
Hands down it has to be [Barakamon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon).
>> ARTICLE
This is the correct answer. 
>> ARTICLE
Does anything come close? I've been depressed and watched Barakamon last week and I can't even think of anything that comes close.
>> ARTICLE
K-on i'd actually say is #1 feel good anime imo but you can watch pretty much any slice of life/comedy anime that is set in a school. I'll try name a few for you; D-Frag, Love lab, gj-bu, kiniro mosaic, Yuru yuri, Shinryaku! Ika Musume and Seitokai Yakuindomo.
>> ARTICLE
I've been down cause of a very sick family member and I think what stuck out to me with Barakamon was how the community was so supportive with each other like family and they celebrated the grandmother and involved people of all ages and backgrounds, so it really resonated with me that life is going to be ok.

I've been definitely meaning to check on K-on, but I'm not sure if cute school girls doing cute things well resonate with me as much or be feel good in quite the same way. 

Thanks for your suggestions. I actually haven't heard of anything on your list except for d-frag, so I might find something to watch :).
>> ARTICLE
You can watch K-on too, but definitely watch Usagi Drop. Closest thing to Barakamon I'd recommend.
>> ARTICLE
As somebody who was on the fence about K-On, give it a shot.  It is the absolute pinnacle of happiness, and the characters are fantastic!
>> ARTICLE
Hina is my spirit animal

[Aria](http://myanimelist.net/anime/477/Aria_the_Animation). For major mood surgery, Aria is exactly what is required. In fact, a few of the old Hal Film Maker titles fit the iyashikei mold, including [Tamayura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9055/Tamayura) and [Sketchbook: Full Color's.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2942/Sketchbook:_Full_Colors)

For smaller cracks in your attitude, two very good shorts are [Aiura](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17082/Aiura) and [Yama no Susume.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume) The first is a simple little cute-girls-doing-no-thing title capable of soothing the soul of anyone who still has one. The second is a very well done cute-girls-climbing-cute-mountains anime that is absolutely brilliant.

Other titles that heal me that may or may not have been mentioned yet are: 

* [Azumanga Diaoh](http://myanimelist.net/anime/66/Azumanga_Daioh)
* [Bartender](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1589/Bartender)
* [Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11843/Danshi_Koukousei_no_Nichijou)

* [Yuyushiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15911/Yuyushiki)

What... I've seen a lot of shit, and been through most of it. My existence takes a metric fuckton of healing just to keep on an even keel these days.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh, Bartender.  It's 4pm here.  Time to go home and whip up an Aviator or something.  Great show.
>> ARTICLE
I like someone mentioned Gj-bu, it doesn't get enough love. 
>> ARTICLE
There's Tamako Market, and then there's the Tamako Love Story.

I should treat Love Story as an OVA, is that OK?
>> ARTICLE
Love Story is more of a final episode-style movie than most OVAs. Everything that happened in Market got wrapped up in an adorable little bow during Love Story, and I'd say they are mutually dependent on each other. The only major OVA that comes to my mind that has roughly the same amount of interdependency would be Kokoro Connect: Michi Random. With both of these examples, neither would make full sense without their prequel series. And also, with both these examples, neither of the series would have such an emphatic full-stop finality to their stories. 

With most OVAs, all they do is tell a missing part from the middle of the original story or a frivolous addendum. Not Tamako Love Story. If you wanted to see how things ended up between Tamako and Ooji, Love Story is very much a part of a complete and balanced series.

Alright, I'm currently unsure of what anime to watch next.

Time for more Slice of Life. And romance.

Thanks!

Just finished this a few days ago. I keep going back to watch some of the episodes. Also I loved the ED songs, especially [Nanasaki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7DaMYoqxfo)'s and [Ayatsuji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MenF54fuwO0)'s.

Baka and Test always puts me in a good mood.

Watching Kiniro Mosaic right now, and the feels so far are pretty good

Dog Days aaaal the waaaay

K-On! Does it for me every time. But its the right mix of cute Moe and Music. 

Having played bass and guitar I love it when they reference my favorite artists in the show!

HxH has its moments. Though it has its lows as well. The ending makes it all good though.

No Game No Life is one of those quick I don't have to think hard to watch shows that never really gets too deep. I wish they'd wrap up the story with another season though.

Then Studio Ghibli flicks are always pretty relaxing to watch. Even if they have some sad moments in them.

Usagi Drop or Isshuukan Friends

Usagi drop for the Slice of life aspect.

Anohana cuz beautiful.

School rumble for being a relaxing romcom.

Anohana was really beautiful and one of my favorites. But I wouldn't really say it is a feel good anime. The ending left me in tears

Same here, but wouldnt really say it was tears of sadness.

Honestly, any cute girls doing cute things show will do. Idolm@ster, Koufuku, and Sakura Trick are all great.

Cute girls doing cute stuff, But with tanks!
>> ARTICLE
I mean TTGL and Super Robot Wars make me feel pretty good. Probably all the explosions (and the odd black hole in the case of the latter).

As has been said, Girls und Panzer is also decent as an "I want something to make me feel happy" anime, while still having some darker aspects to it.

Why Space Dandy of course. Always makes me feeling dandy baby

One of my all time favorite shows, I really enjoy sports anime and didnt think Karuta would be it but its awesome, cant wait for the live action movie with Perfume's theme song!!

Recently started Chihayafuru and I'm already loving it so much. I already know Chihaya is gonna become one of my favourite female characters by the end. There's an appalling lack of attractive but strong/tomboyish female characters in anime >:(
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I know it's really popular on this sub, but I haven't seen it myself. I'm not really a fan of ecchi even if it's for the sake of being over the top. Watched too many ecchi shows back when I was a teen and now I'm sick of the genre lol
>> ARTICLE
I see you added it to your list on the first of the month -- was it perhaps thanks to my [WT](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/48h5ef/wt_chihayafuru_more_than_just_a_sports_anime/)?

I love me them strong female characters and tomboys, yo.

Yeah it was exactly from your thread. Thanks a lot for it bro >:)

It's so good. I binged watched the first two seasons.

Have you looked into [Saiunkoku Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/957/Saiunkoku_Monogatari)? The anime is not tagged at all, but its [source material](http://myanimelist.net/manga/13495/Saiunkoku_Monogatari) is tagged as josei. I haven't really looked into it, but I really liked the anime.
>> ARTICLE
!! I was trying to remember that one for like 10 minutes but the name never came to me. thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking about [Erin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5420/Kemono_no_Souja_Erin) as well, but I'm really not sure. Its novels were adapted into a manga featured in a shounen magazine, and the anime carries the josei, shounen, and mina (for everyone) tags on [AniDB](https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=6187) (and none on MAL).

edit: Also your Saiunkoku link is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I was considering Erin and Moribito, but I couldn't find anything too telling about the target audiences so I opted to leave them out. same thing with The Eccentric Family, which was published in both a Seinen and a Josei magazine. some shows are pretty hard to pin down!!
>> ARTICLE
Interesting about Uchouten Kazoku, I never questioned its origin, but I could see the argument being made. [Benten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-PJLtp50Lo) is great too.

Yeah, I wish I could pin down Erin as a josei honestly lol. I originally watched it because of that tag, and Erin has become my favourite anime character. It's a wonderful coming of age. [Random fanart.](http://i.imgur.com/Ds46EUa.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Both [Erin](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=37139) and [Moribito](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=10683) were published in shounen magazines although the Moribito novel is listed as seinen on Manga Updates.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't looked into Moribito and didn't really try to make an argument there, but Erin did feel sort of josei to me.

Both the [anime](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5420/Kemono_no_Souja_Erin) and the [manga](http://myanimelist.net/manga/18371/Kemono_no_Souja) (which was still ongoing earlier this year) were adapted/based on [novels](http://myanimelist.net/manga/11028/Kemono_no_Souja), which, from the little I've heard, are darker than the anime. While the manga was indeed published under a shounen magazine, and both are written by the same author, the manga could still very well have been adapted to a shounen audience. But then almost nobody, myself included, has read either format so I can't really comment further than gut feeling.
>> ARTICLE
Well this is a fun initiative. There's certainly titles on that list which makes me raise an eyebrow, so it'll be fun reading your future posts detailing how you decided on the demographic for them.

Either way, like I've said in the past, josei has become my favorite demographic/genre tag in the past 8-10 years and it doesn't look to be changing anytime soon.
>> ARTICLE
Demographic is basically according to the magazine the manga is published in. If it's in a josei magazine then it's a josei.

Now, "josei anime" doesn't really make sense as it is a demographic genre used only for manga prepublished in magazines. Even more with "original anime".
>> ARTICLE
> There's certainly titles on that list which makes me raise an eyebrow

A lot of times it really does just come down to when/where/how it was published, and in the case of anime adaptations it may simply be a carry-over from the source material.

Sakamichi no Apollon/Kids on the Slope is a great example. The main character is male, the plot is mostly about two males bonding as friends, and there's a major music element to it as well as some romance. There really isn't any content-based reason it would be Josei rather than Seinen - it could just as easily be either one. 

But the manga was originally serialized in Flowers, a Josei magazine, so that's the label it gets. 
>> ARTICLE
> There's certainly titles on that list which makes me raise an eyebrow

I can address any titles on the list you might have questions about now if you want. :) I'll go into more detail on general stuff in the follow up, but I can pull up sources on individual titles if you want to know specifics. thanks for showing interest!
>> ARTICLE
Oh, and before I forget, Kasei Yakyoku is a show I've been trying to get my hands on for a number of years, but have ultimately given up on. I'm assuming the number of legal ways to watch it on the internet are zero?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sensitive about what a show is labeled as really, it's just that I personally struggle to distinguish some shoujo from josei sometimes. Like you mentioned in your post, I'm sure which demographic a show is labeled as can be as dependent on contextual clues as it is on the show itself, and I admit I'm absolutely clueless about those contextual clues.

Just to see what you have to offer though, I'll ask about the ones that immediately caught my eye: 

07-Ghost, is a show that I considered shoujo, although I can see the argument for josei based on the art.

Then there's the shows under anime originals that I considered to not have a single specific target demographic, ie Eden of the East, Michiko and Hatchin, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. 
>> ARTICLE
it can be tough to tell, because a lot of times it isn't obvious. an anime like Emma sounds Josei on paper, with its focus on romance fixated through a female gaze, but just because it was published on a seinen magazine it falls under a different category. likewise, LoGH is a series that seems tailor made for high-sci-fi military otakus, but it's repeated frequency on Shojo magazines rest on the sex appeal of the bishonen cast in ways that make things a bit murky.  
  
for 07-Ghost, it's because of the source, as it, along with Loveless, Saiyuki Reload, Dazzle, etc, come from the magazine Comic Zero Sum which caters to college aged women over younger groups.  
  
for the anime originals, that's a bit harder to gauge and would probably necessitate a post on its own, but I can do my best to give quick explanations. Eden of the East and Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 are both from pre-2010 noitaminA, a block established in order to reach the Josei demographic (known for airing Honey and Clover, Paradise Kiss, Kuragehime, etc). both aired between Nodame Cantabile and Genji Monogatari and feature grown women in the lead role, with Eden of the East going further by emphasizing a feminine lens when framing sexuality. while a weaker argument as a whole, it is important to note that both feature character designs by artists known for their contributions to Josei manga and the resulting arsthetic served as part of their advertising for the block. noitaminA has since become more of a general access block with many male oriented series airing on it since, such as Saekano, Punchline, and the currently airing Erased, but it was largely a Josei block for some time.  
  
likewise, Michiko to Hatchin was a part of Noise, a sub-block of Fuji TV that was partnered with Josei-era noitaminA. the two other works to air on that block, Ristorante Paradiso and Aoi Hana, were Josei titles from Monthly Erotics F, and director Sayo Yamamoto has described her intention with the series to be directed at an older female audience (which sort of justifies a placement for Fujiko Mine, but that series pulls a demographic subversion that makes it hard to place as well). I'll pull up an interview, gimme a sec as I'm on my phone. :)  
  
hope this helped!!

>an anime like Emma sounds Josei on paper, with its focus on romance fixated through a female gaze, but just because it was published on a seinen magazine it falls under a different category

Comic Beam isn't really a typical "seinen magazine", it only gets categorized as such because it has more males reading it. It's intended to be an alternative comics magazine for people who are actually interested in comics as an art (as is obvious from its [amazing covers](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=&oq=) and its tagline), hence the mix of josei and seinen artists. If Hourou Musuko, Emma and Fancy Gigolo Pelu are seinen then the demographics classification is kind of worthless.

TIL my taste in Anime is like a woman in her late 20s...


>> ARTICLE
Great, thanks a lot for that write up. Surprisingly, despite having watched anime for exactly 30 years this year, I have never paid attention to which time block a show aired during in Japan, in fact, I only started paying attention to animation studios in the past several years.  I don't know if it was just my group of friends or if that information wasn't so readily available 'back in the days', but that's just how it was for me. Thanks again, and take your time, I'm in no rush here!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, a lot of old time anime viewer usually don't keep in mind the show time of anime or the block it's on. That's usually for Japanese audiences to figure out. It all gets jumbled when it comes out to the west, especially with vague gender descriptors, as some shows even go as far as to have appeal through vastly different audiences. Some even bridge the shounen/shoujo audiences too. So it's not that strange for genre differences to be a bit gray at times.
>> ARTICLE
I been watching anime sense 1990. So I feel ya on the watching for ever part. 
>> ARTICLE
whoa, 30 years is hella impressive!!  
  
ahh I getcha completely; I've been at this for some time but the majority of my formative years with the medium were spent focusing on content over context. I think it was only once fansub culture kicked off that the dialogue became more academic, to the point where I was able to to write a few papers back in uni on its more technical aspects without talking out of my butt or looking like too much of a weeb. availability of information has definitely grown since the days of *Central Park Media Presents* and *Japanimation*, which is great for a film studies nut like me. :) always happy to help, good talk!
>> ARTICLE
Ha, it's really not something to be impressed about. It's like saying "I've read books for my entire life", haha. I was introduced to anime by my uncle who traveled to Japan a lot for business. One time he brought back a the entire video tape collection of Mobile Suit Gundam to show my cousins and I because he heard it was all the rage in Japan. We watched those tapes so many times, we just couldn't get enough. After that he'd bring back different mecha shows each time he came home from his travels and that was all the exposure I had to the medium until many years later in life. Even then, though, the pace at which I watched anime was never anywhere close to that of most people on these forums today.

>I think it was only once fansub culture kicked off that the dialogue became more academic, to the point where I was able to to write a few papers back in uni on its more technical aspects 

That's incredible. Despite watching anime for so long, it wasn't something I had ever looked at from a technical perspective, much less an academic perspective. I don't think I'd even know where to start! Whether it's Western or Eastern media, I am but a simple consumer and my academic interests were always towards the life sciences, which didn't leave much room for me to explore the arts and humanities. It really is amazing to see how this sub-culture has evolved over the years!
>> ARTICLE
Back then, you had versions of shows that were heavily edited for broadcast like Star Blazers (from Space Battleship Yamato), Battle of the Planets (Gatchaman), Voltron, and Robotech. I remember coming home from school and watching Robotech, then getting up early on Saturday to watch as well.
>> ARTICLE
> likewise, LoGH is a series that seems tailor made for high-sci-fi military otakus, but it's repeated frequency on Shojo magazines rest on the sex appeal of the bishonen cast in ways that make things a bit murky.

If you've noticed, all the characters in One Piece became ripped sometime during it's production. This was due to a decision by WSJ to put bishounen males in all their series in order to appeal to a periphery shoujo demographic (indeed, WSJ is one of the most popular magazines read by young girls in Japan). The demo tags are fluid and usually magazines are trying to appeal to multiple ones.

>> ARTICLE
for sure, great point!! heck, most sports manga up the ante on manservice and queerbaiting in ways that make some Shoujos look tame by comparison. with works like Orange going from a Shoujo mag to a Seinen one and Dazzle jumping from Shounen to Josei, nothing's really cut and dry nor is it all super obvious, mostly having to do with technicalities. drmographics are weird, which is something I'll definitely touch upon in the follow up. :)
>> ARTICLE
I'd be fascinated to see your rationale for including Simoun. It's one of my personal favorites, but it would never have occurred to me to call it josei.
>> ARTICLE
whoa someone on the sub who's seen Simoun! :o  
  
Simoun's a case of promotion playing a big part in the definition. while it wears its Ursula Le Guin feminist sci-fi influences on its face, the biggest clue comes from (yet again) the context: leading up to its release, it was able to launch a manga adaptation on Comic Yuri Hime, home to the current big Josei yuri manga Citrus. the magazine has since merged with its Seinen sister manga, but at the time it was purely aimed at female readerships. interestingly, even after the merger the predominantly shoujo-ai magazine has still retained a mostly Josei audience, with over 70% of readers being women!

I really, really, really would love a second season of Kuragehime.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a while since I watched it, but I remember that show having a pretty satisfactory ending. I don't remember feeling like there needed to be more.
>> ARTICLE
It was satisfactory [](/s "since they 'saved' the Amamizu household"), but it ended right as Kuranosuke and Tsukimi were beginning to dive into the world of fashion together.

I wanted to see that develop, plus it wouldn't hurt seeing the cast all together again for 12 more episodes of fun.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. The anime was far too short. Thankfully, the manga is on Crunchyroll.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, it is? I guess I should get reading soon, if the anime gods won't hear my prayer for a new season.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. They have 11 volumes up under the English title, Princess Jellyfish. That's not up to date with the Japanese edition, but they've been steadily adding new volumes.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! Seems like a pretty neglected genre in anime though. Is this because studios aren't inclined to adapt *josei* work, or because there isn't as much *josei* source material (mangas, LNs) in the first place?
>> ARTICLE
It's because the market for anime/anime-discs is still unproven while manga/LNs sell great on their own. So they just don't bother adapting it because they feel it already achieved financial success. Though more josei stuff faring well in anime disc sales in recent years probably means they will at least try to adapt popular josei content to anime.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome list Spira :3 Since I've been watching Honey and Clover with /r/xxanime and I *love* it, I'm gonna have to start watching more Josei! I think Kuragehime or Paradise Kiss will be next. ^ ^

Glad someone mentioned it, boy is it good.

> Consider this somewhat of a precursor to a greater project I have in store, which'll study the different aspects of anime categorization in essay form, with the first part coming up in about a week or so regarding this very same subject (what constitutes a demographic, what is josei and what it isn't). **That essay will also explain why the likes of Nana and Sazae-san are absent, among other things. :)**


>> ARTICLE
Wait Sazae-san is a josei?
>> ARTICLE
sorta yes, sorta no. the manga from '46 was clearly directed at an older female readership, stressing Sazae-san's perspective as both a mother and a woman to comment on contemporary issues. the anime, however, runs on daytime children's TV blocks almost exclusively, making a demographic shift upon adaptation. it's unusual, but it happens. 
>> ARTICLE
You do know that Sazae-san was originally a comic-strip in newspaper, right? It wasn't directed at an older female readership. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, OP says there is a reason that it isn't on the list but doesn't elaborate as to what it is. I have to say that having it off the list without giving the explanation kinda makes me doubt the list. lol
>> ARTICLE
since I hadn't planned on getting into it now, the general thing is that Nana was published on Cookie, a fashion magazine listed under Shueisha's shojo line (as listed by the publishers s-manga.net domain). it gets miscategorized as Josei by Wikipedia and other gaijin outlets because it "seems" Josei, but it's shojo. I hope this sates your curiosity, as well as /u/celestial_jet 's, regarding its lack of mention. :)
>> ARTICLE
Feels like a technicality, haha :)
>> ARTICLE
> Feels like a technicality

That's literally what genre delineations are.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's the literal definition of the word. Japanese often label things with demo tags in ways that are surprising to a western audience. Many things labelled as "shonen", nobody would ever think of as a "young boys" series in the US (the WttNHK manga, for instance, was published in a shonen magazine).
>> ARTICLE
NHK is always one of my go-to examples for "why demographics don't always mean what you think they mean." it marks off a lot of usual suspects, such as age of the protagonist, content rating, and thematic presentation, all working against conventions people usually associate with "Shounen". same thing goes with titles like Nozaki-kun, Hetalia, or Inuyasha, which most people would usually associate with shoujos, it's all just so nebulous, so when people complain about Nana being a josei and not a shoujo it just boils down to misunderstanding of what exactly demographics are.
>> ARTICLE
Hachimitsu to Clover or Honey and Clover is great and I would recommend to anyone who has any interest in comedy,romance, or slice of life shows.


Two things that make it stand out in mind is that it is a college setting. An art college specifically, but u won't be seeing any highschool hijinks here. Not only that,but as the series progresses the characters will eventually graduate and set out and find jobs. I know many of ranime like me are college students so many of the challenges the characters go through will be extremely relatable.


It also has   enjoyable and believable love triangles. IMO many romance anime are ruined by how they handle love triangles, but u can't help but root for every pairing in this show as every potential couple has their pros and cons.


That being said there are a lot of laughs to be had here,and if romance  or drama isn't your thing it is definitely gag heavy without ever feeling forced.


Along with a cast of lovable and believable characters there is so much this show does right. Don't let the term Josei dissuade you as when this show came out it was well-known for being  popular among teenage and adult men as well as women. 


Women's Day or not give Honey and Clover a shot. You won't regret it!

I'd love to know what makes Sekaiichi Hatsukoi a Josei anime, but Junjou Romantica not. I've always grouped these two series together since they feel very similar (which makes sense, considering they're in the same world)
>> ARTICLE
hahaha that ones kinda funny actually, as it has a bit of an in-world explanation. the Emerald magazine worked on by the characters of the show is actually the magazine that publishes the series in real life. like the show, it's a for-women-by-women magazine meant to publish stories too mature for Asuka Ciel, its shojo sister magazine. Junjou moved onto Emerald recently (I didn't actually know this), but that was way after the series had been made (save for the third season). hence, Junjou is basically the Shoujo edition of Sekaiichi Hatsukoi. 
>> ARTICLE
That's really interesting to know, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
What do you think about considering Utena as a josei? While it's an original anime whose parallel manga ran on a shoujo magazine and it's pretty consolidated as a "shoujo anime", I can't stop thinking that it was made for the girls who grew up with classical mahou shoujo and are now able to recognise hidden stuff on the media they consume. Plus some themes hit harder on the audience precisely because they're grown (like Utena wanting to be a prince, a small girl would think nothing about it but a grown person would see and appreciate the dissonance of the idea and what it's trying to convey).
>> ARTICLE
good point!! I absolutely think it has Josei appeal and has that demographic in mind to a point, just like the other two Ikuhara originals (the constant allusions to 70's shoujo motifs in Penguindrum and the strict focus on queer-feminism in Yuri Kuma make the case for an intended older female audience over their typical Seinen allocation). at the same time, though, it establishes itself as a shoujo in order to frame the dialogue in a purposeful way: Ikuhara was trying to package the point of the series in order to get young girls to watch it and be influenced by its message. women watching would understand the means with which he's developing his points, but the ones who would benefit the most from it are the girls from Utena's age group, which is why it adopts the form it does and was advertised in that way. similar comparison can be used to explain the Shonen magazine marketing techniques behind Evangelion, another series that's as dark as night and somehow aimed a bit young.  
  
Adolescence of Utena, though? yeah, I can totally make a case for a Josei tag on that one, but would have to work a bit to develop one.

I'm glad you liked it!! this isn't the post I was planning per say but sort of a lead in to the eventual discussions I wanted to strike up. part of my inspiration from this one was the date as well as a talk we had before on the sub!  
  
yeah it's a real shame we don't get them too often, I almost never get dissapointed by works catered to the demographic and would *love* to see some of my favs get adapted (a 7seeds or Helter Skelter adaptation is a frickin dream of mine). :( what're some you'd like to see be made?
>> ARTICLE
Some I'd like might be too short for series adaptations (since they are oneshots or not too long) but from longer works, Real Clothes, Oishii Kankei or Ashita no ousama would be great (though chances for those are 0). 

Some of Yoshihara's works I think would be fun as shorts since they are quite random and comedic and might even feel better than in manga form (though not sure that can happen considering the nature of those).

As much as I'd love to see some of those smutty romance ones like Hapi Mari or Private prince (or that other one with the vampire boss, can't recall the name)...I doubt that will ever happen either.

The ones that I have some hopes on from the ones I'm reading are the ones still not completed like [Sumika Sumire](http://myanimelist.net/manga/66781/Sumika_Sumire) that is really sweet so far and [Honey Sweet Kitchen](http://myanimelist.net/manga/42373/Honey_Sweet%E2%99%A5Kitchen) (totally didn't start this because of Yamamoto's characters that I mentioned yesterday ^^^^yes, ^^^^I ^^^^did... )

oh, how do you recommend it?

I had a really hard time finding a line selling this show: *it's a nostalgic romance/crazy comedy heavily inspired by ancient Japanese literature* just doesn't strike a bell.

I sometimes recommend it as a companion to Chihayafuru. "Do you want to know more about the poets behind the poems? Do you want to see their stories reinterpreted from a modern perspective with some zany new additions? Have I got a show for you..."

Uh... yeah, it is difficult to recommend. I usually bring it up to people who I know like josei or shoujo. I just say something like "hey, you might like this, it has a bunch of neat characters and interesting romantic stories in it!"

Not OP, but [Usagi Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10162/Usagi_Drop) is most likely the safest place to start; it's almost impossible to not like it.

Very true. I also quite like Princess Jellyfish.
>> ARTICLE
If you're in to classical music at all, Nodame Cantabile is fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
picking a favorite is a bit hard, as Hachimitsu to Clover, Sakamichi no Apollon, and Natsuyuki Rendezvous are in my top 10 of all time, with the currently airing Shouwa Rakugo making a good case to find itself on that list as well!!  
  
as a starter, I would probably opt for either Omoide Poroporo or Usagi Drop as they have the most universal appeal, but from there any of those aforementioned would make a great next step (though Natsuyuki Rendezvous is known to be quite divisive). 
>> ARTICLE
Natsuyuki Rendezvous was amazing.  I get the criticisms, and it's not perfect (it really needed to establish the characters and their relationships more before diving into the body-possession stuff) but it had an emotional core and dealt with relationships in ways that the vast majority of anime never even attempts.
>> ARTICLE
> though Natsuyuki Rendezvous is known to be quite divisive

One of my favorites as well, but those middle episodes tested my patience the first time through for sure. More than anything, it's because of the way the show tackles the theme of love and life after death that it holds such a place in my heart.
>> ARTICLE
Jyu Oh Sei is josei? Really?
>> ARTICLE
I had it listed because I figured the artistry and the placement in early days noitaminA were relevant enough indicators, but I had no idea it was based on a pre-existing source in a shojo magazine, so I ended up scratching it off the list. sorry for the confusion. ;(
>> ARTICLE
No its alright its an honest mistake hell I didn't even know Jyu Oh Sei was from a shojo
>> ARTICLE
Possibly because it aired on the [noitanimA block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noitamina), which was established particularly to expand the josei market. 

But then why not others from this block and era like Hataraki Man - was it just the studio, etc?
>> ARTICLE
Hataraki Man is one of those titles I *really* wanted to list but its origins on Weekly Morning makes it fall into a weird place. in a similar way, Moyashimon and Hourou Musuko also make compelling arguments for a Josei tag based on theme and presentation, but their sources convolute things. 
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering about that too.  I love the series, but I don't know what makes it josei (except that the title sounds similar).
>> ARTICLE
Damn, what a nice list. Thank you so much OP for creating this list. Josei as genre somehow for me always being overshadowed with shoujo. Even though mostly I watch shounen or slice of life, sometimes I crave for more josei. And this list really helps. Thank you! 
>> ARTICLE
I shall now make it my goal in life to watch every Josei anime. After all, there are barely any - I wonder why that is?
>> ARTICLE
looking at Shouwa Rakugo's underwhelming BD sales from the last two weeks (sub 2k overall) tells me that its pretty risky investment overall as the market is a bit niche. the golden age was mid-2000s noitaminA (when Nodame Cantabile made a case for its financial viability), but their last Josei was years ago and Fuji TV, alongside most broadcasters, has opted to adapt Josei as TV dramas in lieu of anime. the assumption is probably that most women prefer evening television (true) and would rather spend money on mech shows or sports anime when it came to spending money on anime at all (also true). really unfortunate, but I can see why. :/
>> ARTICLE
RIP noitaminA

You kept anime alive for me through the bitter 2000s
>> ARTICLE
Dang, I didn't realise that Shouwa Rakugo was performing that poorly. But then again, it makes sense since majority of anime's demographic wouldn't be able to get into josei that easily.
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru also had pretty low sales. But it boosted sales of the manga enough that it got a second season.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, as a woman, I'm surprised that I've only seen 3 on the list:

- Princess Jellyfish (Kuragehime)

- Eden of the East (Higashi no Eden)

- Jyu Oh Sei

It's interesting how a lot of the shows I've watched turn out to be Shounen when I never thought they would be.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on the same boat, tbh. I think a greater part of all the anime I've seen have been Shounen, even some titles I would've never thought to label that way: the idea that Nabari no Ou and Kuroshitsuji were directed towards guys at any capacity kinda blows my mind. :p
>> ARTICLE
>(Ones not listed on MyAnimeList as Josei will have a * next to them, including those mislabeled as "Shoujo" or any other demographic.) 
  
Wow, there are a lot of anime not properly listed as Josei...  
  
Thank you so much for this, Spira!! While watching Rakugo this season, I realized just how few josei I've read/watched... I think the only other one on this list is the Usagi Drop manga (which took quite a turn towards the end).   
  
I am super excited to add a bunch of these to my PTW and expand more of my anime reach!   
  
PS: Have you thought about including your list of feminist anime? It's a great list and I think it also could fit today's theme!

Thanks for posting it Fate! Really cool list, the ones I *have* seen on this list I've generally really liked :D 
>> ARTICLE
thanks Fate, I was gonna ask to see if you could pull it up for her since I was AFK!  
  
that's the list I was working on, /u/MissyPie. :) I could develop it more and give it some kind of form that's a bit more comprehensive and post it later, though when touching on feminism on this sub I may have to put more work into it than I have the time to deliver rn so's to stir things up in the least explosive way possible. I might post it on r/xxanime soon once I got it figured out and gauge whether or not people would want it here!!
>> ARTICLE
It's a great list ^ ^ The one show I haven't ever heard about on there is Red Garden, and it looks really interesting! I kind of want to watch it asap :o

>so's to stir things up in the least explosive way possible

Heh, yeah. Not just this sub but on any semi-large sub in general imo :p As long as you're concise and informative without using any "buzzwords" that most of Reddit doesn't like, I'm sure it'll go over well! /r/anime is more open to stuff like that than you'd think, in my experience. 

Please do post it on /r/xxanime <3!
>> ARTICLE
Just a thought, but maybe consider preserving these lists in a wiki entry or sticky on either this or /r/xxanime?  I'm just a dude, but imo these would make fantastic go-to references for helping the women and/or dakimakura in our lives with recommendations beyond the usual titles.

Also /u/Spiranix, this is a really great thread for today.
>> ARTICLE
Hm yes, I think I'll add it as a link to the Rec wiki. Nice idea. :D

I have plans for a user created recommendation wiki on /r/xxanime already, so when I finally get around to that, I'm sure we could include this there too!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks!

FYI to everyone else: it was added [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/recommendations#wiki_josei), which you normally reach by clicking [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/) > [Recommendation Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/recommendations)

Hmm, after seeing this list I only realize how rarely I watch Josei. I've only watched 2 Josei anime (Nodame, Usagi)
>> ARTICLE
I highly suggest Honey and Clover. In my opinion, it has some of the most relatable characters and moral dilemmas related to love I have ever seen in anime.

Great list, would be better if you didn't show all the ovas and sequels though.

Great list, thanks for doing this! There's a bunch here I hadn't heard of that I'm looking forward to watching!

Oh good I have watched one of them on the list to completion, Natsuyuki Rendezvous and I watched one episode of Usagi Drop.   
Edit: Eden of the East also, but I didn't think that counted

It is josei but it doesn't have an anime adaptation. The drama is good!

Isn't [Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon?q=sakami) considered Josei?

Hah!  I knew I wasn't crazy!  

Well... you know...

07-Ghost was Josei? I loved reading the manga but I never looked at the tags. Also, Usagi Drop is a solid 20/10.

I can sadly say I never seen any of these but I really want to watch usagi drop. Seems interesting to me.

It is a super cute show.  It has all the warm feels.

It has one of the cutest kids in anime. She's almost impossible not to like.

Just a note.  You have Jyu Oh Sei listed as original but it is based on a [manga](http://myanimelist.net/manga/382/Juu_Ou_Sei).

Usagi drop was a josei? Damn I should watch more josei.. It was so good!!

Thank you so much for this! I watched Usagi Drop not too long ago and loved it. Currently watching Shouwa genroku rakugo shinjuu and it is my favourite anime this season. Will definitely check out the rest of the shows on this list! 
>> ARTICLE
What about [Himitsu: Top Secret](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3859/Himitsu__The_Revelation)? On MAL it's listed as shoujo and the manga it's based on as well, however [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himitsu_%E2%80%93_Top_Secret) classified it as *josei*. Personally, I'd say it's way too mature to be considered shoujo, so I'd like to hear another opinion about this.

Nice list though!
>> ARTICLE
hmm, that ones a bit tricky. I'll look into it closer, since [mangaupdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/publishers.html?pubname=Melody) and Wikipedia both list Melody as a shojo magazine, yet both sources present conflicting information regarding soecific titles. this could prove Himitsu as a Josei, or discredit both it and Jyuu Oh Sei, I'll have to study it a bit. thanks, good find!
>> ARTICLE
I've had Nodame Cantabile for a long time on my PTW list. Seeing as today is IWD, I think I'm gonna start this tonight.

Great shit, OP!
>> ARTICLE
If you're including Saiyuki Gaiden then you should maybe include Saiyuki as well. Shouldn't be a big deal, GFantasy is one of the least-shounen shounen magazines I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
I'll make a note for the people looking at the title and wondering about a watch order. thanks. :)
>> ARTICLE
I would have never thought of Loveless as a Josei. I always categorized it as similar to Kuroshitsuji because of the shota elements (and it felt like it toed that line much more closely than Kuroshitsuji as well), but I can see why it's categorized as Josei. It does have much more overt sexual elements. I mean the a major part of their society is that the lose their ears when they have sex for the first time. I feel like rewatching it because I loved it as a teen, but I wonder how I'll feel about it watching it as an adult. 
>> ARTICLE
I've got more time than yesterday so thought I'd go through the list and my list to check some more :

Hatenkou Yuugi :  

I'll guess that Hatenkou Yuugi is in the list for the same reason 07 Ghost is, however Comic Zero Sum is targeted at women of all ages and not just josei as wikipedia states. I'm using old stats here but more than 80% of their readers used to be female with about 40% of those being teenagers. I don't really mind it being labelled either shoujo or josei (since the target seems 50-50) but the magazine publishes works for both demographics. That coupled with the age of the heroine and the general feel of the manga really makes me think it's shoujo (though it's been ages since I both read and watched this). Why MAL lists it as Shounen though...well except the general feel sometimes...I have no idea O_O

I won't argue the rest from the same magazine because those (the ones I've read at least) do have elements to make them more josei than shoujo.

Kuro to Kin no Hirakanai Kagi :  

They should make a separate demographic for that. The content doesn't justify the shoujo tag that it has but I'm having trouble categorising it as josei, too.

As for things that could be added but depends on why you added others or if you are strict with certain tags :

[Makai Ouji: Devils and Realist](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16890/Makai_Ouji__Devils_and_Realist) : This is another one from Comic Zero Sum. I would say the source is mostly josei due to the cast (which also applies to the anime) but it can really be called either shoujo or josei. 

[Bronze: Zetsuai Since 1989](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1042/Bronze__Zetsuai_Since_1989) : Honestly I'm not sure about this so I'm just throwing it out there but the source, although initially in a shoujo magazine it later changed to a josei one. Thing is I have no idea what this OVA adapts since I haven't watched it yet.

[Himitsu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3859/Himitsu__The_Revelation) : This one is a bit odd. Some sites list the source as shoujo while others as josei. Problem is that the publication is shoujo (even though Melody has published a few josei, but not many) but the content seems quite more mature which is probably why people call it josei. To be honest, the anime could as well be a seinen, since it's more fitting than either of the others (except the designs which tend to be on the classic shoujo side). I'd say this one is shoujo, but thought I'd mention it anyway.

[Tomoe ga Yuku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4927/) : Content is mature and it was published in Betsucomi which is purely shoujo but you will notice that neither manga or anime have any demographic tagged, probably because nobody could decide what this was :P

[Deimos no Hanayome](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5918/Deimos_no_Hanayome) : The content is definitely mature but I haven't read the source, only watched the OVA here. Going strictly by source though it ran on Princess which is purely shoujo.

These for now. I'm sure I have more in my list like the above but I'm not sure how to track them down easily. Let me know in advance next time!

^^^^<3

> Hatenkou Yuugi  
  
I've been meaning to look into the figures for Comic Zero Sum since I had a few questions about it, especially since the transition from shounen-to-josei seems a bit extreme for the likes of Dazzle and Saiyuki, so I was thinking about whether or not there's a specific trend to distinguish them. I'll look into it more and see if I can pull up anything that denotes whether or not it's ever explicitly referenced as "josei" by publishers, but for Dazzle in particular I was referring to [the mangaupdates page](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=5028)! I think it may've been listed as shounen just cause it originally ran on GFantasy!  
  
> Kuro to Kin  
  
I was also a bit split with this one, cause like, well you know. >_< unlike [Rouge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25623/Rouge__Ladys_Comic_Video) or [Belladonna](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3220/Kanashimi_no_Belladonna) (which I may have to add in as well) which package themselves as erotic fiction for women, Kuro to Kin is very much a type of shoujo smut that teeters on gray zones I have no idea how to pin down. I went with the justification that the original game was rated 18+, but in that case I suppose titles like [Togainu no Chi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8449/Togainu_no_Chi) or [Dramatical Murder](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23333/DRAMAtical_Murder) would count under those parameters as well, maybe? haven't seen either show so I can't tell if they take after the shoujo-oriented rereleases/adaptations of the source material or not to decide. :/ good point though, I wish this were easier!!  
  
> Makai Ouji  
  
adding it in, thanks! I actually had this one open on a seperate tab but I guess I forgot to actually put it in at the last second.  
  
> Bronze  
  
interesting, I've never actually heard of this one. :o apparently it's the second part of the Zetsuai series, but only the [third part](http://myanimelist.net/manga/33765/Bronze__The_Final_Chapter) of the manga ran on a josei publication, though, just like you, I haven't read it nor watched it so idk if that's the part that was adapted. this did lead to me do a lil bit of research into some other Yaoi/BL titles, and apparently [Sensitive Pornograph](http://myanimelist.net/anime/741/Sensitive_Pornograph) and [Ai no Kusabi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/719/Ai_no_Kusabi) (both releases) were based off titles from June (June Comics Piace Series and Shousetsu June, respectively) which are listed as Josei publications. should I make a separate tab for titles with a Rx content rating?  
  
> Himitsu  
  
that one is certainly tricky, but I can't find anything to support the notion that Melody nor its publishers recognize it or label it as a Josei publication, so I ended up going with it as being part of a gray zone (which is also why I scratched off Jyu Oh Sei from the list, until someone whose read the manga can tell me if the noitaminA adaptation makes a case for a higher demographic shift or not).  
  
> Tomoe ga Yuku  
  
omfg this art style, this is so old school. hmm I'll put a tab on it to check it out and see for myself, but as far as I'm reading it seems to be like Nana and Life in the sense of being a more mature but still shoujo kinda shoujo, which is also noted on mangaupdates. same with Deimos no Hanayome (which, btw, looks super interesting. how is it?)  
  
thanks a ton for helping out again, I really appreciate it! hopefully between us we can make the truest list of josei works out there. :)
>> ARTICLE
Personally I don't mind Hatenkou Yuugi as either as I mentioned but I do think it's shoujo with what I mentioned in mind. Then again, instead of taking the heroine into account we could take the guys into account, which then makes it a bit more believable as a josei.

Kuro to Kin I'd say scratch it off the list, personally. While not a hentai, I can't see it as shoujo or josei however designs are probably shoujo. 

I didn't list those BL ones because they are too many and I'd say since they have been toned down for the anime versions, they are mostly shoujo (except that freaky Dramatical Murder OVA maybe O_O). 

The yaoi ones you listed are also partly josei (as well as some others) but I don't think they'd fit in since...well I guess that should be an entirely different list on its own.

Himitsu is definitely shoujo, only reason it's mentioned as josei is due to the themes. If we change the demographic due to the themes then we could as well have it as seinen (which the anime adaptation is closer to). Jyu Oh Sei is also def shoujo, I didn't mention it since you had it scratched off.

If you are going purely on where it was published, Tomoe ga Yuku is shoujo (Betsucomi), same as Deimos no Hanayome (Princess). About Deimos no Hanayome, it's one of those OVA that they gave a great summary to but the episode isn't like that at all! They probably adapted some side story instead? Not sure since I haven't read the manga. I liked the old designs and sound though (tend to dig those, they are nostalgic).

The Life manga, since you mentioned it, is shoujo due to the publication but also due to the heroine and setting (even with the more mature theme). They could have tagged this as josei if they wanted but the target audience wasn't that. This is easier to spot with other Bessatsu Friend publications like Deep Love. The Deep Love series...well....Ayu, Host and Pao are shoujo...yet Reina is Josei. Every single one of them can probably destroy you with their mature themes, cold reality and tragic events. They share characters, settings, events, themes, everything...yet only Reina is josei just because it's focused on Reina after the main series when she was 19...even if the other ones would probably need to be targeted to a higher age. Main heroine is taken into account very often to determine the demographic in these magazines.

Honestly though these don't bother me, since we are talking about how to list them, I thought I'd mention these. Been a shoujo addict since growing up with Sailor Moon and reruns of [these](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3754/) [stuff](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3022/) that I still have on some VHS thrown away somewhere. The shoujo manga addiction came much later but it kinda took over me over the years (pretty sure I've read a few hundred shoujo titles over the years), especially on the days of my HanaKimi and Skip Beat madness that we'd group edit the scans and translations on yahoo groups, irc and a certain manga forum that died later that I used to help mod the shoujo corner. I think this is one addiction that hasn't left me over the years :P

I'm not sure how to look them up easily since I haven't tagged them myself (plus my MAL is a new account I made since I forgot my old one so some of the ones I had are probably not even there...I still add titles I've watched before sometimes)...but this should be a pretty complete list already.

As for the shoujo version of this, it was partly what I was meaning to do with what I told you on FTF (which is why I said it's more targeted towards a certain demographic) though of course not as full since those are quite a few hundred titles. If that's what you plan, let me know.

whoa that's awesome!!!!! I'm super excited to see what you'll do for a shoujo write-up with all that familiarity! the original plan is a sort of "let me give you a description of what a genre/demographic/term is, and sort of refute any misconceptions about it", but I'd of course want to bring in consultants to handle their own favorite genres and have this be a multi-prong project. if you want to take a part in it, I'd love to collaborate, but if you want to do it as your own thing I'll totally veer away from doing anything that might step on your toes there!
>> ARTICLE
> whoa that's awesome!!!!!

I've been trying to find some of those old shows btw for years with no luck (the originals hopefully). The popular ones that were on TV like Macross, Gatchaman, Voltron, Plawres Sanshirou, Candy Candy, Ulysses 31, Tekkaman, Gundam Wing are easy to find but others like [this with subs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2361/Sei_Juushi_Bismarck), [this with subs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2510/Sengoku_Majin_Goushougun) (only managed to find some raws and not fully), Step June and other stuff that kept going on reruns here but never made it to actual releases are impossible to find fully :( Now that I think about it I grew up with more mecha than shoujo shows...

> shoujo write-up

That's the thing, I'm not good with write ups as I told you before, that's why I mentioned if I do something it won't be WT like, or someone else has to take over that part, lol.

> sort of refute any misconceptions about it

Which is what made me think of this as well...seen so many people who think every shoujo show is a romance show. And other ones too  but that's another issue...

> if you want to take a part in it, I'd love to collaborate

I do! As I said, if I do something it will probably be a list/suggestions thing since I can't write imo (also probably for xx instead since I kinda doubt the reception here for shoujo would be the same as for josei). I planned both josei and shoujo as a list (with the second being less complete) but you've done more than great with this one, I love it!

> I'll totally veer away

Don't even mention that. I think you'd do much better in writing these, I like reading what you put together! Plus, you tend to write what I think anyway, lol.


>> ARTICLE
Never seen any Josei anime, because I'm not entirely sure that things aimed at older women would be appealing to me as a teenager-almost-adult male... but if you could recommend one of these to me, what one would it be?

....Are any of them mecha anime? That always helps work me into a genre/demographic lol I enjoyed Escaflowne which was Shoujo so I don't see why I can't enjoy this either!
>> ARTICLE
unfortunately I can't think of any Josei mecha titles. :( there are quite a few shoujo ones as far as I remember, namely [Magic Knight Rayearth](http://myanimelist.net/anime/435/Magic_Knight_Rayearth), [Aquarion Evol](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10447/Aquarion_Evol?q=Aquarion), and, to a point, [Star Driver](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8934/Star_Driver__Kagayaki_no_Takuto), most mecha shows either aim specifically for male audiences or cast a wide net so's to appeal to multiple genders and age groups all at once (the Gundam series is known for this, especially with Bishonen heavy entries like 00 or romance heavy entries such as 08th MS). the only Josei title I think sort of falls into the mecha category would be [Simoun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/879/Simoun), though its mechanical design is [pretty far from the norm](http://www.geocities.jp/emiri_0623/V-simoun_03-ep17.jpg) in terms of standard mecha fair.  
  
however, if romance or slice of life isn't your thing, but you're more into action shows, there's definitely some Josei titles I'd consider looking into. for example, [Michiko and Hatchin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4087/Michiko_to_Hatchin) often gets compared to Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon in terms of its raw grit, while something like [Saiyuki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/129/Gensoumaden_Saiyuuki) and its sequels are just generally well rounded fantasy adventure series (along with the other Zero Sum titles such as Amatsuki, Karneval, and 07-Ghost). perhaps the easiest Josei title to recommend for a young adult male would probably be [Eden of the East](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5630/Higashi_no_Eden), since it's generally just a really good sci-fi/political thriller.  
  
hope I helped. :,)

Not OP but here are my suggestions:

* Gokusen
* Hachimitsu to Clover
* Nodame Cantabile

There are a ton of great anime on this list but I think these 3 are pretty neutral with diverse casts.  I think the last two are just  relatable if you went to college in general (though super relatable for those who went to an art or music school).  Gokusen is just a lot of fun.

The ones that have * next to them in this thread aren't listed as josei on MAL so you'll have to check each title.

How are josei anime for men?
>> ARTICLE
I say use the demographic to think about the kind of perspective you should be tackling it with, but for the most part it should be fine. some Josei titles, such as Usagi Drop and Sakamichi no Apollon, should resonate with men in a different but still effective way, while other titles, like Natsuyuki Rendezvous and Paradise Kiss, might be harder to get into because they adopt a certain type of gaze that might not make too much sense for guys. lots of my favs are seinen titles and I'm a woman, so I don't think there should be too big of a barrier so long as you're picking wisely. :P
>> ARTICLE
You will probably like some, probably hate some as well. It is a broad genre and there is something to relate for most people but YMMV. For me I really enjoyed nodame cantabile

nice josei list without NANA, seems legit

I said there was a reason for its absence in the header post. :p if you want to know what that reason is, refer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/49i7ic/celebrating_womens_day_a_list_of_every_single/d0s3d6w). simply put, it's a shojo not a Josei. 
>> ARTICLE
that's such a strange technicality... I guess if you're making a list of anime which are technically josei then it makes sense, but I assumed you were trying to provide a more comprehensive collection for viewers who wanted to watch series containing themes/ideas generally targeting josei (which Nana most certainly does, if you've seen the anime)
>> ARTICLE
Genres are based on technicalities like this. There is no objective measure beyond time slots/magazines intended audiences. Basing it on MC's age won't help as often we have shows that look at adolescence from the perspective of an adult, for example, and perspective isn't something that can be judged objectively.

I guess the closest Sakura had to fanservice was the somewhat lewd costumes she sometimes gets in. It's pretty standard fare for 90s-early 2000s anime though.

That and all the shipbait, which newer fans might consider fanservice since it would have been played up like crazy in a modern show. It really isn't treated that way in the show though, and even the most needless Nadeshiko/Sonomi and Li/Yukito scenes are treated as cute instead of lewd.

Seed has fanservice? Does a story-relevant sex scene count as fanservice? I always thought fanservice was unnecessary sexual content, not sexual content that was part of the story.
>> ARTICLE
That's what fanservice is (doesn't have to be sexual content only however). And I wasn't referring to that scene.

[But...](http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g298/strike_zero/1373002087269_zps1299b842.png)

And whenever a missile hit the ArcAngel, you can see where all the budget went instead of actual fight scenes that don't reuse stock footage. Also the [OPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6PzlnjAPqQ) are chock full of really unnecessary stuff (lots and lots of boob bouncing) and Lacus' bust size is made inexplicably larger in the OP and mid episode transitions. Just some of the stuff I could think of off the top of my head. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess I had tuned out the Arcangel missile scenes (my god that was obnoxious). I also forgot that the remaster dialed up the fanservice (especially in the OPs). And Destiny did have quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Seed's OP nudity stuff felt like a throwback to oldschool shows though. Including the nude scenes in openings, which was fairly common in 80s and 90s anime, even for many non sexual shows.

Yeah, there's some shots that are fanservicey. But there's like 5 or 6 shots the entire series and that was about it. I kind of went in with the expectation that it was going to have fanservice but was kind of disappointed it had very little. I think some oldschool Gundams had a bit more on average. A lot of unexpected fanservice too, with the wacky scenes like in ZZ.
>> ARTICLE
Cagalli meets Athrun.  Some of Flay's stuff.  Every time a missile hit the Archangel.

Gundam SEED is still Gundam, so much less fanservicey than most anime.  Among the Gundam franchise, SEED / Destiny is perhaps the most fanservicey.  It's all a matter of degree, so.
>> ARTICLE
There's a difference between being a throwback and having constant tits bouncing on your screen in every OP. Besides, you can have nudity in your OP, but to throw it into every OP is simply unnecessary pandering. For example, see [00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH3m3c8SZCg) as an example of doing it right. 

>  I think some oldschool Gundams had a bit more on average. A lot of unexpected fanservice too, with the wacky scenes like in ZZ.

Zeta had like 1 Fa scene. ZZ has Chara, but that was limited to mostly near the end of the show.

Seed has a good amount with the repeated stock footage usage of missle arcangel bouncing action. Destiny ramped that up way, way more. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. The Seed animations are kind of dramatic but not that bad. Flay's bounce was actually kind of realistic even, considering the zero gravity depictions. Some of the cheeky shots in the show itself is more fanservicey than the stuff in OP as I see it. I never really looked at that scene like it was especially pandering. Just felt like they were animating the classical silhouette nude scene a bit more. I was told the series was fanservicey but got very little out of it. Destiny actually seems to have had less overall than Seed.
>> ARTICLE
>Flay's bounce was actually kind of realistic even, considering the zero gravity depictions. 

That's not the point. The point is that it is pointless and adds *absolutely* nothing. Further perpetuated by the fact that it is *resused* in pretty much OP. It's fine if you use it once if your intention was a throwback but it comes to a point where it is just there for cheap sexual pandering. 



> Destiny actually seems to have had less overall than Seed.

[Can you really say that?](https://i.imgur.com/mSM5SPW.jpg) 
>> ARTICLE
 To me, OP flair is OP flair. It just is something that is a separate entity from the actual show itself. Again, I felt Seed was referencing the silhouette/nudity effect of oldschool shows. Many oldschool shows had wild OP/ED imagery that never really makes it to the actual show, especially with nudes. Flay may be fairly bouncy but I just thought it was realistic to a space imagery.  Just felt like an eyecatch for an opening and not much else. We both know she is not a trifling character in the show itself.

And just having sexual appeal in itself doesn't automatically mean it's 'cheap' in my book. I felt Seed series just was more graphic in both the sexual and violence aspects overall. It didn't really feel out of place to me, Definitely not that much more or less than what we usually get out of a Gundam show. I can kind of see your point with boob bounce when ship gets attacked, but I thought it worked well visually and didn't stand out especially or anything.

And yes, Destiny definitely had less sexual appeal scenes than Seed overall, even with those remaster changes. Just from the actual number of scenes.
>> ARTICLE
> Flay may be fairly bouncy but I just thought it was realistic to a space imagery.

Could you really say this is [space imagery (nsfw)](https://youtu.be/jKU1VU2YTZk?t=23s)?

> didn't stand out especially or anything.

[We seriously get a angle camera shot of right in front of Murrue nearly everytime it happened.](http://i1222.photobucket.com/albums/dd496/ShawnMerrow/anime/1076329281762.gif). It had so often to the point that even B[uild Fighters](https://youtu.be/vaRynhjiIsM?t=12m57s) makes a goddamn mention of it.

While yes, Seed many not have as much fanservice as say, Cross Ange or something. The fanservice is still a lot more than what we get in comparison to other Gundam shows. It's about the *way* the scene is done and where the camera focuses itself on in Seed that makes it incredibly intrusive and comes off as nothing but a cheap way to entice the viewers.

nudity != fanservice

"fanservice" implies pointless panty shots or "Baka! Hentai!" moments where the entire story stops dead in its tracks so that the audience can ogle at animated tits for a moment.

That's not fanservice. Fanservice is (often, but not limited to) lewd depictions for the sole purpose of appealing to fans.  
Your scene is of importance to the story, as stated before the scene happens, and the effects of which we can see after the scene.

I'm not sure, Hyouka's first ED is somewhat suggestive fanservice. Not apparent but I don't want to watch that with my parent.
>> ARTICLE
To each his own i guess. I honestly didn't see anything in Hyouka that i wouldn't mind watching with my family. But obviously each family is different so what might cross the line on one end might not be the case for the other. But even if you consider the ED to be slightly suggestive fanservice I hold a similar stance as I do with the OVA which is its optional and can easily be skipped without missing anything important so if it is undesired you can avoid it without missing the core content. Also there is going to be suggestive content in pretty much everything so its hard to find something with no suggestive content whatsoever (not saying it doesn't exist, it is just the minority).

I'm not so sure about Durarara!, there is what I would classify as fanservice with two twins, but after thinking about it I guess it is pretty much only they who have anything fanservicey. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, title does say zero OR minimal fanservice. You might also consider it fanservice in very few scenes with Celty here and there, but it's no annoying "in your face" stuff, mostly fitting the situation and definitely not taking anything from the atmosphere or story. Don't know about the twins though, if I recall correctly, they only first appear in the second season. Haven't fully kept track with that one yet, to my regret.

The twins are introduced in the first season OVA but it is very true that it has minimal fanservice

Hardly, true. Still, it kinda did give off the vibe for me and it's hell a lot fun to watch either way. Know what you mean though, I feel her :'(

i mean i guess at its core its a funny story of a girl in love trying to win her crushs heart, so i guess it could be considered one. but its just so goddamn funny you kinda forget that even though a lot of jokes are based on her trying to win his heart. its easily in my top 5 anime ive seen so far. its the only anime where ive actually spent money on by buying the first manga volume. i never thought id actually spend money on anime when i started watching, but im planning on buying all the volumes as they come out now as well as the box set once it comes out lol.

i could go on about this show for days i love it so much. it was one of the first comedy anime i watched. i could kinda tell when and what jokes were coming, but for some reason the anticipation made it even funnier. since watching that i still havent found an anime that made me laugh as hard and often as this one. season 2 plsjpn

[You're telling me](http://imgur.com/1NBUyWH) [this isn't fan service?](http://imgur.com/NpA9HgX) 
>> ARTICLE
Well, that would really stretch my idea of "fanservice". But maybe I'm reducing it too much to almost-sex scenes and nude skin...  Again though, the title says "zero OR minimal". If you want to call it that, I think we can agree on "minimal" (so still legit) in this case. My view on that though: That first pic is mostly just using her stance as a device to show her outgoing character and in that case intention of attention. The second one is an illustration of their subtle but not very established friendship and Hikki's impression, so he gets to question his view of them. 
>> ARTICLE
But [Yui](http://animediet.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tayuntayun.gif)?  (Not to mention all her 'accidental boob-press scenes' with Hachiman.)
>> ARTICLE
Is that from the second season? I really don't recall that scene. Boob-pressing-scenes and stuff, I would hardly call that fanservice either and I doubt it's really dominant in the story. It probably serves the fans less than it serves to show that Hachiman is not as unfazed as he might come off. But seriously, I'd say there's more fanservice going on with Saika than with any of the girls... and I've seen that anime here in another person's post somewhere, so I can't be that far off...  
More importantly, I was simply trying to add something for people who aren't looking for animes along the lines of FMA or Attack on Titans. I personally enjoy romance, if it's taking a little seriously and not just about annoying scenes of people falling on each other while accidentially dropping some clothing in the act. So when I saw this thread I was like: Cool, maybe some nice recommendations, then was disappointed when there were almost exclusively Anime that rather obviously wouldn't feature fanservice, because they're not even brushing the matter. Anyway, even if you do take romance seriously, there will be some display of attractive features or physical contact and the according reactions. It kinda comes with the genre. There's nothing out of place there. For me fanservice includes display of these things outside of plot/characterization necessities.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, you can justify it all as 'in character' for Hachiman, but does it really extend the plot, drama, and relationship of the characters, or is it all just a thinly veiled excuse to put close-ups of character [T&A](https://ironkleid.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/74aad-ohys-raws_yahari_ore_no_seishun_lovecome_wa_machigatte_iru-_zoku_-_03_tbs_1282b32.jpg?w=640&h=358) on the screen for the viewer?  Granted, it's not as over-the-top as Rail Wars to completely distract and interrupt the plot, but as much as I love the series, Oregairu's still full of fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
You can call it 'justifying' all you want, but I'm just stating my true feeling about the show. That picture of Yui you posted, I can't recall seeing that, but, if it's from the anime, I'll give you that - it's fanservice. Still not a common sight on the show, if not the only happening to that extend. And man, Hikki is a teenage boy. Why shouldn't he be thinking about this kind of stuff? It's called realism, it makes the anime charming. He's not a complete robot, despite his image. That IS characterization. The show doesn't ignore the fact that he's attracted to certain physical aspects, that IS realistic. If you cut scenes like that completely, that's when it seems staged. Let's just agree to disagree. Unless the creator removes my post I don't believe I maltreated the spirit of the thread.  
*edit* : I marked it in my list, I hope that shows my consideration. I'm not brushing you off, I'm just not convinced it doesn't belong here.

Hmm in one of the early episodes Shinichi grabs Murano's breast and there is some nudity in it later on.
>> ARTICLE
Grabbing of Murano's breast is because of Migi, not really fanservice. As for the nudity later on [Parasyte](/s "In Kana's dream, her and Shinichi were naked, but you could argue they were because of her infatuation with him. Then Murano and Shinichi having sex isn't really fanservice and develops their realtionship.") I consider fanservice as pointless nudity, upskirts, doesn't contribute to the story etc. But in both examples, it's not really pointless and either makes sense in context of the narrative or develops something.
>> ARTICLE
This is a bit off-tangent, but I've been wanting to ask, at what point does something gets considered as fanservice? Because something like Love Live! for example, had a beach episode and they all had their 2-piece bathing suits, yet in that episode and throughout the whole series there has never been a single moment/shot/angle dedicated to emphasizing sexuality. (not counting the pre-anime PVs, Mogyutto had a bunch of those.) Not to mention that a number of their costumes are fairly revealing.
>> ARTICLE
Fanservice just means "giving the fans what they want."

Some entire series are an act of fanservice. Fate/Kaleid Liner and Carnival Phantasm are both examples of this. For a western example, see the movie Predators.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more like gratuitous fan pleasing that's not necessary to the plot.
>> ARTICLE
Fanservice is just unnecessary stuff that does not add to the plot or characters in any meaningful way. It does not have to be sexual (for example, UBW's Sunny days ending or GBFs and Shingeki highschool parody is fanservice for Gundam/SnK Fans) but that's what most people refer fanservice to be.

If they're at a beach then it's expected to have swim wear so it's fine and not really fanservice so long as the idea of going to the beach is in some way part of the plot or characterization. 
>> ARTICLE
If the scenes don't have to include the content or frame it in a sexual way to get the plot points across, but they *choose to*, it's fanservice. A beach episode can have the characters be there for a serious reason that is vital to the storyline, but if the show takes a moment to show off their new designs, that specific scene is fanservice.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the definition nowadays is just for unnecessary sexual shots. I guess it all boils down to how shows handle the show actually portrays stuff like beach scenes, as pretty much 2/3 of anime has some sort of swimming episode, but not all of them use them to sexualize the characters.

* Detroit Metal City

Tl;Dr there's plenty, so long a you stay away from Rom Coms. Or any show with a harem plot or subplot, as fan service is a trope

Don't mean to be that guy, but Fate/Zero has an entire episode devoted to fanservice [F/Z](/s "Loli Rin")  
>> ARTICLE
The Rin one ? I mean it might be a filler episode but not a fanservice one.
>> ARTICLE
Fanservice doesn't just apply to nudity. That episode was made to literally please the fans of Rin. If you only mean crotch/tit shots then you should've made that more clear.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama.

Unless you consider seeing the middled aged Gorilla and Madao getting naked every other episode as fan service. The times you do get some real 'fan service' its forgotten five minute later as the Gorilla or the Shogun have taken all the spotlight with their nakedness.

Swimming pool episode. Kyubei and Tae in bikinis.

One Episode. They were the focus for about a minute before the Shogun arrived and took the spotlight for the rest of the episode.

Okay: here's my anime recommendation list for ages 12 and up:


Absolutely NO fanservice, and Pat Robertson or Rick Santorum would be proud to watch it.


1) [Barakamon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon) - rural countryside setting


2) [Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun) - runs your typical slice-of-life and high school tropes straight, but your sides are likely to be gone after each episode.


3) [Nichijou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou) - if "moe" does not equate to fan service, you are pretty safe. Over-the-top humor (which may be an acquired taste).


For films, anything by [Makoto Shinkai](http://myanimelist.net/people/1117/Makoto_Shinkai) would qualify, but the storyl tends to be too realistic for those who delve into anime.


Other (slightly older) classics include Madoka Magica, Rurouni Kenshin and Haibane Renmei. Minimal fanservice, if any.
>> ARTICLE
> anything by Makoto Shinkai

I don't know man, The Garden of Words had a lot of feet. (   )
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps I need to be more specific about fanservice...

Garden of Words: Foot-fetish fanservice


Children who chase lost voices: Ghibli-esque fanservice


5 Centimetres Per Second: Emotional masochistic fetish fanservice <--- I probably belong here


The Place Promised in our Early Days: Sci-fi and minimalist aesthetic fanservice
>> ARTICLE
> Emotional masochistic fetish fanservice <--- I probably belong here

You and me both.

>> ARTICLE
* Wolf Children - does the furry scene count?

* Rurouni Kenshin not really much fanservice iirc

* Most Ghibli movies

* Ergo Proxy

* Kekkai Sensen - Zapp and his ladyfriends are fanservicey for a couple scenes but otherwise nothing

* Durarara - does Celty count?  Or Anri?

* Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun

* Princess Tutu - you could maybe count Kraehe, though

* Jojo except for a couple scenes

* Your Lie In April

* Terror in Resonance

* Antique Bakery - minor manservice

* Hourou Mousoko

will post more when I remember them

Psycho Pass (badass female detective unravels titanic conspiracy in an Orwellian Cyberpunk future city)

Eureka Seven (a boy mechanic falls in love with a young ace pilot from a group of freedom fighters, and as he grows up their love plays an integral role in solving the mystery of this futuristic setting and reuniting humanity and nature.)

Eureka Seven: AO (Sequel to E7, follows the child of the two main characters. The "inconsistencies" between the two shows' settings hides an enormous plot twist and amazing story. gets a weird amount of hate, despite being a 9/10 amazing show. )

Last Exile (two childhood friends/steampunk airship couriers become embroiled in a war against a guild of hyper-advanced humans intent on guarding the Ark ship which will unite humanity and return it to Earth.)

Ergo Proxy (dystopian future-noire existential thriller. Oozes with symbolism. Trying to understand and dissect the meaning of each part of the show is even more fun than watching it.)

Cowboy Bebop (One of the defining works in the space-western genre. Lack of fanservice is debatable, but the good far and away outshines the bad)

Arslan Senki (Fire Emblem: the Anime. A Persian prince seeks to reclaim his rightful throne and rescue his people from barbaric totally-not-the-Jews invaders. There's one scantly-dressed main character who never does anything remotely sexual.)

Knights of Sidonia (a stowaway boy becomes a soldier in a giant Arc flying through alien-controlled space. Beautiful art with weird/interesting animation. Netflix.)

Steins;Gate (I'm amazed no one has mentioned this yet. Delusional "mad scientist" invents a way to send information through time. As events spiral out of control, he realizes that what he's lost is worth fighting an unwinnable battle to recover.)

BONUS OBSCURE ANIME: Xam'd Lost Memories (A young man leaves his island home after it is attacked by the supernatural forces of an enemy nation. Having become a strange, supernatural creature himself in the process, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery and seeks the guidance of spiritualists, old friends, and new companions. Feels like a cross between Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Eureka Seven.

In all cases, the anime above are beautiful, high quality productions with no space wasted on stupid, pointless ecchi scenes which fail to advance the plot. When nudity does occur, it is incidental, artistic, or quickly brushed over in a tasteful way.

Can't believe noboy mentioned Berserk yet. You can spot some butt or breast ocasionally, but it's not fanservice, it's necessary for the plot.  
Also, I think there is a rewatch going on, so if you haven't watched it yet, go do it.
>> ARTICLE
Berserk certainly does have fanservice. Fanservice can move the plot forward/be integrated seamlessly into the plot. If the scenes don't *have* to include the content or frame it in a sexual way to get the plot points across, but they choose to, it's fanservice. Berserk is a great example, because there are also quite a few scenes with totally nonsexual nudity and sex acts that clearly aren't fanservice (the rape scenes are good about being horrific and uncomfortable.) 

A ton of Golden Age Casca/Elaine Casca scenes all count, along with a few of Griffith's and Guts' topless scenes. There are multiple ritual orgies too where the characters are meant to be attractive.
>> ARTICLE
I'm talking about anime here, manga has way more nudity and fanservice, [example being](/s "Farnese masturbating with a sword,")but that's manga only anyways.
Lemme bring up a few scenes from the anime.  


[Spoilers](/s "Naked Casca warming up Guts") - It gives Casca a real and tangible reason to hate Guts, without this she would be just a random tsundere bitch.

[Spoilers](/s "Scene where Griffith and Guts are splashing water at each other") - Griffith's butt naked, but the whole scene is portraying Griffith's childlike nature. I can see the scene working without Griffith being naked, but it would be illogical, he's washing himself, so why would be he clothed?

[Spoilers](/s "Casca naked after Guts drags her out of the river") - It helps advance the sub-plot of her being insecure about being a woman-warrior. I have to admit though, we do get to see a glorious sideboob later on, and that's pure fanservice.

And that's kinda it. Nobody would ever classify[](/s "tortured Griffith's bare torso"), or[](/s "Casca's Eclipse rape")as being fanservice.

I might have forgotten something, but even if so, the Berserk anime has extremely low erotic fanservice, and it qualifies as an anwser to this thread.

Ah, my bad. I haven't seen the anime in a long time. Remembered manga scenes in places.

I haven't seen it, but "yuri vibes" can mean romantic vibes, not sexual ones. It's Kyoto Animation. They rarely have fanservice in their shows.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say that's necessarily true. Kyoto Animation had its fling with fanservice in early 2000s and some of their recent shows had more displays of sexual imagery. Sometimes full on butt-shots and in the case of Euphonium, a lot of imagery was bordering on sexual tease (even though no actual upskirts or anything). Stuff like teasing the legs, thighs, nose, mouth happened in Euphonium.

Nichijou, K-ON!, Non Non Biyori. I think Kaiji is free from FS as well, but it might be a little more adult themed then you're looking for. Dragon Ball Super is another easy pick.

No, I understood that part.  What I don't understand is why he would say it.  Unless if by 'touching' he meant 'super creepy and gross because incest.'

Has the manga creator ever been interviewed about the direction the manga went and why on god's green earth it went there? The first part that the anime covers is amazing. Why would you ruin it all by turning something so great into cheap otaku fetish pandering? T_T
>> ARTICLE
Just a shot in the dark here.

**TL;DR** - Author achieved success and pressured to continue, made controversial changes to the latter half of the story with mainly meh/hated it results.

[Given the last panel on this page and the first panel on the next](http://www.mangareader.net/1618-50993-19/usagi-drop/chapter-17.html), I'd guess the author felt pressured by the magazine and her success to continue the story in a new direction and maintain or exceed her current success. Initial results probably weren't too good, so she went a bit more extreme, [](/s ""killing" off characters' relationships. Nitani basically disappears from the story after rejecting Daikichi for the second time and Rin's biological relationship with Masako is totally retconned for the sake of being slightly more socially acceptable. I don't remember what happened to Akari but she's practically eliminated from the story as well.")

I think the main reason people are disappointed with the second half of the story is how much of a far cry it is from the first half. To sum up each half --

First half: Life is tough, but we make it through each day with each other's support and have a deeper appreciation of life.

Second half: I don't feel like I deserve happiness OR I deserve to suffer, so I will continue to suffer.

Even the author must have felt the first half was better, proof being Bangaihen. Or perhaps the magazine pressured her into trying again with Rin's childhood. Either way, I don't think it made much of an impact and now Usagi Drop seems to be pretty much dead. Shame, maybe there's a doujinshi out there that does the second half justice.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, I don't consider that a retcon. Even just watching the anime, I thought it was very likely the grandpa wasn't really the father. Given what we knew of the grandfather, it seemed pretty likely he was just covering for the girl.
>> ARTICLE
Masako reminisces several times through the series about how she was pregnant, pregnant -again-, and how she raised Rin from birth. Masako's boyfriend notes several biological similarities between Rin and her mother. There are other examples but you get the point.

Personally, I believe that the mangaka was pressured into retconning the biological connection between Daikichi and Rin due to obvious social issues (incest and whatnot). Or maybe she was intending for this ending all along. Who knows. There might be an interview or statement confirming one way or the other, but I haven't seen anything of the sort.

[On an offnote, I found an interesting blogpost about this topic](http://listlessink.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/life-love-and-things-in-between-an-usagi-drop-approach/). New perspectives are fun to read and I didn't consider the ending in this way before. My opinion still holds though.

Also, dunno if I just have bad memory or not but I found it difficult to find Masako's husband's name. Was he even given a name in the story?
>> ARTICLE
That's pretty interesting. I guess it seems like the author was at a loss where to go with the 2nd half so she went for the shock/fan-service route at the expense of the story's and character's integrity.

I love the first half so much and bought the fancy DVD set to support it. As far as I'm concerned, it is a stand alone piece of work without any ties or relations to the follow-up continuation.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure what I posted was correct, hence the "Just a shot in the dark here" statement. It's just my opinion, posting this so you don't get the wrong impression about the author. I'd love for someone to post the author's feelings about this, but AFAIK it doesn't exist on the internet. 

I came across some [random blogpost](http://listlessink.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/life-love-and-things-in-between-an-usagi-drop-approach/) that's pretty opposite to how most feel about the ending, give it a read if you want.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I am of the opinion that Usagi Drop is one of the rare shows that out shines the source material. I did not like the direction the manga went 
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, due to licensing limitations, videos are unavailable in your region.

I checked those out because i've never even heard about half of them, and they all seem extremely intriguing. Thank you. 
>> ARTICLE
They're all fantastic shows that earned their distinction through strong writing; definitely worth watching. Feel free to ask if you have questions about any of them.
>> ARTICLE
Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has fairly realistic character interactions.
>> ARTICLE
Aside from what others recommended, Genshiken and Planetes spring to mind. Yes, Genshiken has all those silly otaku, and Planetes has a sci-fi setting, but in the end it's about adults who are entering adult life and trying to deal with it.

Shirobako is *almost* there, but is a bit more hopeful/fantasized, but should be close enough, probably.

I wonder if Aku no Hana counts. Hm.
>> ARTICLE
What impresses me so much about Genshiken is just how down to earth it is. When you make a show whose fundamental thesis is a celebration of otaku culture in Japan, it's really easy to go over the top with it and make something like Oreimo, which is a mad-cap comedy when it's being funny and a melodrama when it gets serious. Genshiken is extremely subdued for what it is. Most of the characters accurately hold that archetypical late gen-x/early gen-y listlessness and act like real people who just happened to be extremely invested in an unconventional hobby. It's one of the more easy to engage with SoL series I can think of for young adults in their early twenties, baptized in weebshit from the first time they turned on Fox Kids. 
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Genshiken is great on many levels. I was really sad Nidaime didn't do so hot, when I thought it was one of the better shows of 2013, a year filled with shows I liked.

It's what I call a "Real slice of life," not an idealized version of it.

I checked out one of the person's reviews that gave it a 1/10 on there, and once you see the picture of [Fullmetal Alchemist 2003 and Brotherhood spoilers](/s "Nina after she's been turned into a chimera") you can realize pretty quickly that they're a troll.  And honestly you can take literally any anime and sum it up in a way that sounds bad, so unless you know the person reviewing it has similar taste to you, probably take it with a grain of salt.
>> ARTICLE
>lol The reviews on MAL are pretty messed up.

WOW just noticed that. Yeah don't pay attention to overly critical MAL reviews because they're generally circle-jerking shit. Its ranked top 20 anime of all time and it deserves it. Such a fantastic film.

Barakamon has a similar adult-child dynamic. Really great anime. It and Usagi Drop constantly remind me of each other.

Just wait till you read the manga.

The closest show to what I think you're asking for that I've watched is Aoi Hana.

Shows that I constantly hear compared to Aoi Hana is Hourou Musuko.

All of these shows explore different facets of adolescent sexuality.

Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction.
>> ARTICLE
Read it anyway. I also really liked Usagi Drop and plan to read the manga soon despite everyone's warnings.
>> ARTICLE
As far as I know, you shouldn't read the manga if you want more of the same stuff, however, if you want the same characters to do different things, then by all means, read it.
P.S. by different things, I don't exactly mean happy things.
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm gonna read the manga it will be interesting to see the change do you know where I should start?
>> ARTICLE
If you really want to, start at chapter 25 since the anime covers up to chapter 24. Keep in mind there is a large time skip between those two chapters.

Thank will do.

dont do it. You will regret it. I knew about the manga first and as such i couldnt even watch the anime

40/100, not bad

A half-decent 24, plus another ~2 shows' worth of incomplete stuff. I should get around to more of these.
>> ARTICLE
10/100. I haven't been an anime fan for that long, plus I'm busy with college, so I think that's pretty good
>> ARTICLE
Ive completed 27, and if you include shows that I have read the manga instead, or watched but drop / didnt finish because I decided to read the manga, 34. 
>> ARTICLE
I've seen 67, and I've still yet to get to Bebop, Beck, and Death Note (although I read the manga once upon a time, so I have no real motivation to go watch Death Note at the moment).  Kyoukai No Kanata movie is on my radar as well, even though I wasn't too impressed by the series itself.  

Its nice to see my favorite (Kino's Journey) make the list though.

39, and working on 3 more.

What was the methodology here?  Highest rank sets the franchise rank?  Or votes  avg = score, sum of show scores is franchise score, sort by franchise score?  Or?
>> ARTICLE
Highest rank sets the franchise rank was this one. I'll probably do another one that is average score later on as well.

If you count partially watched, it's 31/100. If it's only completed ones, probably like 25.

26/100. That's just completed. If you include stuff I've started and put on hold/dropped/just haven't finished, it's more like 35 or 40.

Pls watch these. Especially Bebop, Death Note and Parasyte. 
>> ARTICLE
I need to get around to watching Death Note. I've just heard so much about the second half ...it's hard not wanting to get invested.

Also, I'm still surprised people like Shigatsu/Your Lie In April so much. I mean I enjoyed it, but wouldn't think of it as #10 (in this list).
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Death Note yesterday actually and I can see why people enjoy the first half more but the second half is still really thrilling! 

Yeah same! I guess people really like their feels anime

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
yes. not watching bebop is a crime
>> ARTICLE
It's a crime Bebop isn't in the top 10 :(
>> ARTICLE
Bebop is too overrated and too overhyped
>> ARTICLE
its just not your taste, but im sure like 80% of people here think differently as you.
>> ARTICLE
My statement may be incorrect. Let's say that i wouldn't recommend it as a first anime to someone.
>> ARTICLE
How come? I'm curious. Especially since you gave it a 9.
>> ARTICLE
I seriously don't remember anymore lol, that was a long time ago when i started watching anime. I guess i said that because there are animes that i would watch rather than Bebop. It's really great, but not that "holy shit" great. I have to watch it again some day, wish it wasn't episodic.
>> ARTICLE
I see lol I have anime that I would rather watch than Bebop but I still think it's one of the best out there. Different perspective I guess.

[](#whowouldathunkit)
>> ARTICLE
I disagree, while it's a great classic, a classic shouldn't be held to a higher value than newer anime simply because it's a classic. That's called being biased.
>> ARTICLE
But how did Bebop come to be considered a classic? It has an interesting, compelling story with a fantastic ending, unique characters, fantastic animation that still holds up to newer animation and it has one of the best soundtracks in all of anime. All of these contribute to why it's considered a class and are why it should be in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, it does have all of that, and that's exactly why I call it a great anime. However, putting it in the top 10 of all anime isn't as cut and dry as that. There are plenty of anime that are as you described, certainly more than 10. A top 10 list simply cannot be anything but subjective. So it's not a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10. The top 10 on MAL is simply a popularity figure, it's not objective at all. It's a rough approximation of an anime's true worth at its best.
>> ARTICLE
That's true and since it's all subjective and this is all based on my opinion, *I* think it's a crime that Bebop isn't in the top 10.
>> ARTICLE
Actually I strongly believe it doesn't deserve top 10.

 Bebop is great, but it's episodic, and many people prefer a coherent story over a series of short stories, even if the characters and settings are interesting

Downvotes for not believing a show is top 10? I even think it's good, just not top 10 anime of all time... wtf.
>> ARTICLE
So much this yes. I watched Bebop only 2 days ago after my 3 years of Anime watching only to see that it is damn overrated. Characters were great, sound was amazing, stories were entertaining and execution was top notch. One of the best shows I have watched but it seriously lacked a plot. You can easily make connections with characters but events were so unrelated you never feel the show as a whole to like it so much. Just look at  [Cowboy Bebop](/s "what happened to Julia after all that hype? She just died."). You are exactly right about the show being episodic. Thus there is no room for Bebop at top 10. 

When I see people claim Bebop is one of the best shows I think that people are trying to show off that they pick a classic old show as their favorite to feel somehow superior against the people who like new, popular stuff. It is the same as people hating on SAO for no apparent reason other than it being popular. I didn't watch the second season but first season was definitely a good entertaining normal show. Same hate on Kirito too. Kirito is not some outstanding character to be the favorite character for anyone but he is not that notable as a bad character to become anyone's most hated character either. Just because he is popular, no reason to hate on him to show off your *unique/s* and *mature/s* taste.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry but I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial. It's kind of like saying a SOL show is better than an action/adventure show just because it fits into the SOL genre and a certain group of people like SOL more.

People having a problem with the actual content of an episodic show is one thing but saying it's not great *because* its episodic is completely different.

>> ARTICLE
If you're issue is being invested in the fate of the characters, because at the end of the episode everything reverts back to ~ status quo, and there's no longer arc to get heavily invested in the characters.




>> ARTICLE
This isn't necessarily true.  Certain episodic shows have more development per episode than others.  Not all episodic shows are law and order.
>> ARTICLE
That's a different issue that has to deal with the actual content of the episodes including the characters.

Also, Bebop does have an overarching story that's highlighted in specific episodes that helps you feel connected to the characters. If Bebop was really a completely episodic show with no main plot then the ending wouldn't have hit as hard as it did.
>> ARTICLE
>I feel like claiming a show's method of story telling is an innate fault of that show is kind of superficial

If a work from of a medium tailored for storytelling falls short on storytelling, it's a pretty legitimate argument to make.
>> ARTICLE
I agree but that comes down to the actual story being told not simply the format of storytelling.
>> ARTICLE
Never understood the hype. Watched it a few years back because it's supposedly divine and untouchable, but it looked rather bland to me.
>> ARTICLE
It's episodic nature isn't for everyone. I could defend it all day long as my favorite anime but the most recent rewatch thread had really great write ups and does a much better job. If you read some (episode 5 and the last few are probably the better ones) you may find some appreciation for it.

Ooo boy, you're missing out.

Yeah, honestly I'm sure I'll like most of these, so I keep them as fallbacks.

> Newest members: Noragami and One Punch Man (Fall 2015)

If Noragami counts as a newest member for its second season airing in Fall 2015, then so does Haikyuu!! at spot #12 for its [second season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28891/Haikyuu!!_Second_Season). ^(long live Haikyuu!!)
>> ARTICLE
Noragami was not in the top 100 before the top 100, so it's the newest member because it's a completely new entry. Haikyuu!! season 1 was already in the top 100, and while it moved up due to season 2, it isn't really a new member.

88/100 I think. 

Edit: will make it my goal to have 100 by the end of this year!

All the work and effort OP put into the list, and that line was my favourite part of the post.

>> ARTICLE
Maybe newer shows are better
>> ARTICLE
Irionically I feel that after signing up to MAL back around August 2015, I've rated some of my favorite shows of the past with rose-colored glasses.  Like, I'm pretty sure if I rewatched R.O.D. OVA now, it would no longer be 10/10.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I go back maybe once a year and re-rate things to more match what Im feeling over the long term.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously look at the numbers for 2011-2014 3/4 years have 9 entries and 2013 must've been a pretty barren year to only get 5. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, Japan produces ~5x as many shows a year these days, so you might want to take that into account.
>> ARTICLE
Also the fact that (just like movies, books, music 
, etc.) people and generations change - thier interests and perceptions shift, tropes go in and out of fashion. It's fine not to like something classic because it was made by different folks for different folks. Things that transcend that are very rare. Worst case scenario - this shows that the average MAL user is around 20. Maybe even not because there are less older users but because in the past decade or so, popularity of manga/anime in the west has exploded.

More often than not, we just have something very dear to us and we can't accept that stuff we don't like surpass it in quality and popularity. Because we want to think that if something is good, we will like it and by extension - if we like something, it must be good. Thus - recency bias explains that away really well for us.
>> ARTICLE
Also animation quality is going up. I don't really care if you think the older style is more appealing; recent shows have been pushing limits with [backgrounds](http://i.imgur.com/aqnN7Zp.gifv), [foregrounds, and effects](http://i.imgur.com/i5pRxBN.gifv).

The only show that really feels like the old cell animation fits better than digital imo is Trigun. I love the graininess, but new animation is definitely higher quality.
>> ARTICLE
I think there is something missing for very specific types of show, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and especially the absolutely gorgeous Ghost in the Shell movie all benefited from either the grittiness and colouring/shading styles of older animation.

I feel its a similar way to how Noir films benefit from being black and white.

The original is not in the top 100.

That's a shame, the original gets so much flack even though it has better early character development, a better OST, and the better movie. I also like how [](/s "it takes more than 10 people to make a philosopher stone")

There was always certain things that bugged me about the original. I wasn't a fan of how the homunculi were handled, I liked the idea of the villain in the original but I thought Brotherhood's was more interesting, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I love father way more than Dante, but at least there was consequences in the original. Everything seems to convenient in brotherhoods end game. There is also the fact that everyone just kinda watched as greed died. Everyone holds brotherhood way higher than the original when in reality they are pretty balanced in their strengthens and faults, but if you have watched the 2003 previously brotherhood becomes a lot better. Where as the opposite is not true. 
>> ARTICLE
I imagine watching Brotherhood first is a bit like watching DBZ and then going to the older original Dragonball when it wasn't all about the fights.
>> ARTICLE
This is better. Evangelion not being in the top 200 was giving me serious buttpain. Also glad to see Disappearance closer to the #1 position it once upon a time righteously held.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually disgusted by the fact that everyone keeps mentioning evangelion like it's the greatest masterpiece ever and then I look at it's myanimelist rating and I think it is where it should be, similiar about the mentions of madoka magica.

And then there is Hajime no Ippo, a show that is so damn good, yet people won't try it cause there is some "pact" that people don't want to watch sports anime, and only mention of it is when someone asks other good sports anime in a haikyuu!! (great anime though) thread, and it gets mentioned afterwards fucking baby steps...

smh.
>> ARTICLE
Well, NGE is one of the (very, very) few anime i would consider a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Le 8.3 average rating, what a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Just wondering, why did you rate Death Note a 10 if you dropped it?
>> ARTICLE
Death note to me is Light vs L. That's where the anime ends.
>> ARTICLE
[But](/s "didn't L die in episode 25, not 18?")
>> ARTICLE
L vs Light, not L *with* Light
>> ARTICLE
NGE is either the most impactful anime on art in general or the third msot impactful ever. I mean, we're talking about *an anime* which influenced the *Western film industry* more than a lot of actual Western film masterpieces ffs. NGE is like 100x more important to science fiction than GITS is for any **real** sci-fi fan and sci-fi is a lot bigger than just anime! You seriously have to be like 15 if you don't understand how big of a fucking deal NGE is, when in just anime alone it popularized (didn't originate, necessarily) huge swathes of standard tropes and is at most the second most impactful show for the industry (after the original astroboy ofc).

EDIT: You're like someone who is insulting the position of Diablo 2 as possibly the most influential video game that will ever be produced after, like, the early 80's.
>> ARTICLE
That is of course one way of looking at it. Again, it is a good anime - masterpiece? I don't think so.

By that, I'll put Dragonball and Z as a masterpiece, even though it had it's flaws. I even rate DBZ higher than evangelion  as an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not a masterpiece. If you really can't recognize that it was a masterpiece and one of the most impactful works of anime or science fiction of the 90's, [you've got a serious disease for which there is no cure.](http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarCHcNNbZRIpsyY/giphy.gif)
>> ARTICLE
Are you serious? How can you say it is even a masterpiece by todays standards when it is rated low compared to other anime... the point stands that its only 8.3 and maybe higher/lower in other forums. I agree with that rating. That rating shouldn't be called a fucking masterpiece.

What does it matter that it was influential in anime. Do you think Survivor (still a great show) is also a masterpiece cause it greatly influenced reality tv shows? 
>> ARTICLE
Um, It's got a low rating because it's actual art and a lot of people can't handle the concept of anime as art, not because it deserves such a shitty low rating. Just take your shit opinions and go troll somewhere else, mate.
>> ARTICLE
Are you kidding me? How is my opinion troll? You are the one being ignorant here that you can't understand that people just don't think it's that amazing.what does actual art even mean? Are you some kind of snob who thinks their opinion is better than others?

Well, nothing else to say than I am sorry that you have grown up to have such a big ego.

It is not a masterpiece in my eyes, and according to ratings and comments, a lot of people have the same opinion, so fuck off.

http://i.imgur.com/ZAfVGax.gifv

Edit: No this is not about the people who think it isn't top 10. There's a lot of anime out there so odds are there are 10 other shows you enjoyed more.

I've just noticed a lot of people who are disgusted by OPM even being on the list. Even if you don't enjoy the action or comedy, it's confusing that people can think it's not objectively a well made anime, even with all the praise it has earned.
>> ARTICLE
We're not saying it's bad it's just not top 7. I think top 15-25.

OPM isn't even my favorite from this year.
>> ARTICLE
There's a difference between bad and not top 10 material.
>> ARTICLE
I think it deserves top 10, there's a reason why it's so well loved and famous.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. You're absolutely correct in that there's a reason it's well loved and famous. It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

/u/icedino said (implied, rather) that OPM isn't top ten material. To be fair, that's his own opinion and he's entitled to it, just as you're entitled to your own. More people than not found it to be top ten material, so by definition it's top ten material, assuming it holds its place in the coming months. It's just not necessarily in EVERYONE'S top ten.
>> ARTICLE
> It's because more people than not enjoyed the series.

Also hype. Let's not kid ourselves, there are so many anime series that can be considered better but simply don''t have the amount of mainstream hype OPM does. Hell even in the top 100. Do you think the average mainstream anime fan has heard of LogH or Cross Game? They're still in the top 100 for a good reason. The reason why CG or LoGH don't have a huge anti-movement is *because* it hardly ever gets talked about (respective to huge hypes like SAO/AOT/OPM that is).
>> ARTICLE
I think it's too soon to say whether or not OPM is top 10 *of all time* material. A few seasons from now we'll be able to tell whether it's high rating is because of it's recent hype or because everyone truly believes that it's the 7th best anime of all time.

It's lost like .05 points over the past two weeks.

Dropped from 10 to 11, giving the first season of gintana its spot back.

It's just my opinion that the show doesn't deserve as much praise as it is given and definitely not to be the seventh best anime of all time. Would still put it in my top 40 or something.  
But hey, your opinion is different - that's fine too. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it should be seventh either but I'm not surprised about it. People like it because it's funny and easy to get into and they're gonna give it 10s and 9s. Nothing to be surprised about.

He's basically saying "I don't like it, therefore it doesn't make sense why its in the top 10".

Recency bias coupled with the fact that it went mainstream is correlated with this, makes complete sense.
>> ARTICLE
I know you're most likely using the term "recency bias" to fuck with me again, but that doesn't apply here *at all.* 

People aren't choosing between two different anime, you're just scoring them separately. You don't have to choose between Cowboy Bebop or Hunter x Hunter for 10/10's, it's not a contest like that. And it's not as if people are saying "Oh wow, this anime just came out in 2015! That makes it automatically better than this 2001 anime." nor is it the case that because recent anime are going to tend to be more popular (OPM is at #91 in popularity anyways) that they'll automatically rank in the top 100 as Ashita no Joe, Ping Pong, and LoGH have proven.

I wonder if OPM didn't get that much hype that it could take a higher spot. I mean before the anime was announced the One Punch Man community was at least average in number but still a little unknown. /r/OnePunchMan didn't even have their own subreddit style and I'm happy just to see a reference out of nowherein reddit. It was one manga that if you read before the adaptation, you couldn't imagine to be animated just because of the art(of the manga).
>> ARTICLE
If they animated it in ONE's style it could have become another Ping Pong :)
>> ARTICLE
Very likely.  People would have regarded it as an underrated gem with the quality of its animation.  Personally, the show was extremely entertaining and interesting from start to finish and I think it deserves all the praise it gets.  It's definitely not a perfect show, but that's not really saying much when talking subjectively.  In another time and place, the detractors of the show could have been its defenders.

The Kyoukai no Kanata entry confused me at first because I knew the series was a lot lower, and it's seem like the few fans that liked the series are the ones who voted high on the film...But with the exception of that (can't find another in a similar case), it seems like a good job with the listing. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for others, but the film is probably higher because it provided a satisfying ending, which the original series was seriously lacking.
>> ARTICLE
When you say you combined series, do you mean you averaged the scores or did you just take the highest ranked entry in the series? It looks like you did the latter, but that can be pretty misleading since later entries in series almost always receive higher scores due to people who disliked the original not bothering to continue.
>> ARTICLE
The list is intended to be relatively useful, not an absolute ranking.  It helps to remove half the list because of duplicates / semi-duplicates.  I know whenever I looked at MAL for "top x" in order to check out stuff I may watch, I've always been super annoyed that I have to scroll down pages to avoid Gintama repeats, etc.
>> ARTICLE
True, but I think there can be problems with either approach: there are franchises where the first one or more installments are well-received and then things go downhill. Kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't...
>> ARTICLE
I did the latter. I'll probably make another one that averages as well in a week or two. There is a problem with both options though. Due to the rating that MAL ratings work, long running shows like Hunter x Hunter or One Piece only have the ratings of people who have seen most of the show are counted. I'll probably be making more of this with different methods to try and get a more general idea in the future.

So far I'm thinking of making top 100 lists that:

1. Average everything
2. Only includes the initial/first aired season
3. Only includes the most recent season

>> ARTICLE
Oh, I didn't know that long runners only counted ratings from people who've watched most of the show. No wonder so many of them end so on high on MAL. That'd complicate this kind of ranking even more.
>> ARTICLE
1/100

Do I have bad taste? No.. No. It's everyone else who's wrong.
>> ARTICLE
If I ~~have enough time~~ stop being lazy I could make one which takes the averages of each entry and its sequels/whatevers.

I would like so much a list of these but only counting TV Series with 12 episodes or more. (Not counting, specials, movies, etc)
>> ARTICLE
Wow, is FMA:B really that good? Why have I delayed watching it for so long???
>> ARTICLE
What I really enjoyed, is that it's a longer show that really pays off in the end (character development etc...). And its a pretty wild journey (I knew nothing going into the show).
>> ARTICLE
All anime is subjective just like movies and any other medium.  Honestly, I found it to be good, but not amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was a gateway anime for many, so that could be a factor. To me it just seemed like an above-average shounen battle show, but I don't generally enjoy that genre so I didn't care for it.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely wasn't a gateway series for me, but I'm a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I felt FMA:B to be equally good, or better. I wouldn't call it a battle shounen, but I would call it a family adventure show. Pretty much just Avatar.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if it's harder to accept mediocre shows being so highly rated or great shows barely making the list.
>> ARTICLE
from the top 100 any romance/harem  in there?
>> ARTICLE
Ouran High School Host Club is the only harem anime in there.

Romance has a lot. Clannad:After Story, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Ruroni Kenshin, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, the Monogatari Series, Bakuman, Howl's Moving Castle, Kara no Kyoukai, Hotarubi no Mori e, The Tatami Galxy, Major, Nana, Cross Game, Nodame Cantabile, Romeo no Aoi Sora, Sakamachi no Apollon, The Girl who Leapt through Time, Toradora, Spice and Wolf, Tsubasa, Ouran High School Host Club, Sakurasou, Rose of Versailles, Welcome to the NHK, and Honey and Clover.
>> ARTICLE
thanks for that, ,gonna check them 
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari is also a harem, even if mal doesnt say so (at least by defenition).
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari and Clannad (first season) are technically harem anime, they just aren't labelled as such by MAL for whatever reason.
>> ARTICLE
You missed Kyoukai no Kanata in your list - very strong romance subplot in that one, overwhelming the action/youmu stuff really.

>  Ruroni Kenshin

Is that really considered a "Romance"?  I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a *small* subplot IIRC.  Though I only watched through the Shishio arc so dunno if it gets more emphasis later on, but from what I recall the romance aspect wasn't much stronger than Naruto's.

Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance, but I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series since they are 1000% different in just about everything.
>> ARTICLE
> Is that really considered a "Romance"? I mean sure there's a romance subplot, but it's very much a small subplot IIRC.

Nope it is not, RK cannot be considered a romance anime. It might involve romance in it (which it doesn't really btw but that's another topic) but RK is not a "romance anime" as the focus is completely different.

> Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal had more romance
It had more but even then it is still minimal considering the story in general. The things it focuses on is much more different. 

> I hope those were not "consolidated" in with the series

OP made some huge mistakes in the list. Some shows still have more than one entry with different adaptations and movies like Fate/s Evangelion but made some omitting with others. I understand that he merged 3 seasons of the Gintama and Benizakura movie was a recap but why add Final Chapter as well. RK suffers from this the most because the movies and the original series are too far away from each other many people wouldn't believe they are the parts of the same series. '96 TV series of Rurouni Kenshin and Star Wars are more similar to each other than   original series and Trust&Betrayal OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
Mind you, Ouran is a reverse harem. A great one, and really funny, but the MC is still a girl, which will probably put some people off.
>> ARTICLE
Ouran is like one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen. it's very good to pass the time and be relaxed while laughing your ass off
>> ARTICLE
In case anyone is reading this, hasn't seen it, and thinks they might be put off by the reverse harem bit: try it anyway. Please. It's a good fucking show.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I greatly enjoyed both the manga and anime, like I said it's great, but some people will(sadly) be put off by the fact that it's a reverse harem, even though it's nothing like say Diabolik lovers or Dance with Devils. I can recommend it to everyone.
>> ARTICLE
Great effort, thanks! 

Have watched about half of the list.

i need to watch more high rated shows.
>> ARTICLE
What's interesting about a consolidated lost like this is that the upward push of Eva 2.22 (which was highly received by fans) carried all the Rebuilds 47 spots ahead of the original series.

Obviously the original show is > than the Rebuilds but it's interesting to see how a superior movie/episode in a set of OVAs can influence the whole.

Anyway--great job on the list, OP this helps me know more of a real top 100 I can pick and watch from!
>> ARTICLE
Well that's because the OP just congregates EVERY spinoff and sequels and prequels while compiling the list. He did NOT average scores. As someone else said, franchises with multiple seasons that people would have dropped cause they didn't like the first ones are bound NOT TO watch and berate the latter ones. That's how you get Aria who's only got one really high rated season (Origination) while the rest were 8/10 or lower. That makes this list a bit misleading.

I've seen like 10 of those, lmao. I've got only about other 15 on my PTW too. TIL I'm an anime hipster I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Well, there are so many more shows I like outside of top100 than within it. Polarizing shows are not neccessarily bad, but get mediocre scoring by definition. Long-running shows also have a higher scores because only fans stick to watching it. And just as newer shows start off with high ratings, that decay over time, really old shows are rated higher than they are worth because of nostalgia. I would most definitely rate DBZ higher than if I would watch it now for the first time. I think most people don't really take the top100 seriously.
>> ARTICLE
34/100. It's sad to look at this and realize some amazing anime aren't on the list while some really bad ones are. A good example would be that Haibane Renmei is not on the list while it's much inferior rip-off, Angel Beats is...

It also lacks Berserk, the original FMA, GiTS movie, Princess Tutu...

How is angel beats a rip off or Haibane renmei? They are completely diffirent and the only thing they have in common is a story being about dead people.

35 finished.
5 dropped.

I really liked shigatsu. in my mind it deserves its spot in the top 10 way more than one punch man, which I dropped after 5 episodes. however I can see how people like it and even though I dont think it deserves to be that high, I understand that it is there.
in the end it just comes down to taste :/

"6- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (1988)"

Any advice about this anime? is it worth? is it better than newer shows? or maybe its just more nostalgic points.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very talky space opera. It's by no means perfect: the animation is often quite limited and sometimes error prone (both problems are most common near the show's beginning), for example, and the animation and direction don't always convey the scale and details of the battles that well. And leaving aside actual problems, it's not something which everyone would enjoy watching. As I said, it's talkative, plus it's very sincere and not terribly interested in being hard science fiction.

That said... if you do have any appreciation at all for space operas, or dialogue-driven political/military stories, it's worth a shot because it is very satisfying to watch. It's unique in anime for the size of its cast and kind of unique for the ambition of its storythere are longer anime, but there aren't many which can do 110 episodes of continuous epic narrative with no filler. It's pleasingly capacious in its ideas: it doesn't necessarily get very incisive about any one ideology or behaviour but it includes so many ideas and arguments and incidents. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is certainly 'better than newer shows' in the sense that nothing since has done, or has even really been able to attempt to do, the kinds of things that it does.

So I'd say it's worth giving it a try if it interests you, though you shouldn't feel obliged to watch it and if you do try it and dislike it that's fine.

> nostalgic points

This is unlikely, because the show was only made widely available with an English translation in the mid to late 2000s. I'd bet that a substantial majority of the people on MAL who've seen it saw it within the last decade. From my memory it was almost unknown among English-speaking fans until 2007 or 2008, when it gradually took off.

fucking Katekyo Hitman Reborn? seriously? jesus people, i don't really like some of this show but i get why they're so popular, but reborn? that's just wrong, it had a good premise and the first couple arc were good, but after that it became just complete trash, its one of the most generic, repetitive, stereotyped, poorly written shonen i've ever seen

i just don't get it


>> ARTICLE
Well you obviously won't agree but what I loved about it was that it was just a fun show. The characters were fun, the action was fun, the plot was fun, etc. Characters like Gokudera, Lambo, Hibari, Squalo...they really did do a great job of making them feel like a family. I started to love the characters so much that I didn't even mind the "daily life" episodes and began to miss them a bit

Plus it was amazingly creative. Small touches like the ten-year bazooka added so much flavor to the show for me. Not to mention the abilities that each character had and some of the really spectacular fight scenes (Yamamoto vs Squalo, Gokudera vs Gamma, Hibari vs Genkishi, Tsuna vs Xanxus, etc)

I won't deny that the show has more than its fair share of problems (sexism, Tsuna constantly realizing his resolve comes from protecting his friends, filler arcs) but it is pretty special to me 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm ... KHR was pretty generic as a shounen but it went beyond generic a bit with the expansion of its scope through the middle of the series.  So, I felt it "ramped up" then stayed in good, high gear all the way until the very end where they rushed the last few episodes pretty hard.

At the end of the day it still remains a "shounen+" to me, so nothing super outstanding, but I rate is as definitely a step above average and "100"th place isn't really overrating it, IMO.

I can confirm this. Though, making an anime that surpasses the VN is impossible, in my opinion. It just doesn't work, I think.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder when they're going to make a Tsukihime anime?

Speaking of unspeakably bad, I just watched the first episode of Campione. They crammed the entirety of the third novel into a single episode. I don't know if I want to bother with episode 2.
>> ARTICLE
There is one already.

no there isnt.

Do I have to explain the joke?

it's not a joke...it's a defense mechanism.
>> ARTICLE
Most people say that Steins;Gate's adaptation is better than the original, can't think of any other VN examples, though.
>> ARTICLE
Shuffle is a great example. It's also a great example of a harem drama done right as it seems to be the pinnacle of what harem drama could be. 

As for the VN, it's just your normal date-sim harem pick-your-girl-then-fuck visual novel. There is nothing really special about it as you can find the same stuff in any of the other 50 translated date-sim novels. It's also hard to read the way the text overlays the text background. If I remember correctly, there wasn't a way to fix it. 
>> ARTICLE
Good point. I guess we could say the same about *MashiroIro Symphony*, then?
>> ARTICLE
I've heard the opposite and that the anime leaves out a lot of plot. I mean, the VN is regarded as one of the greatest ever.
>> ARTICLE
Well, unless the plot is short, most adaptions leave out a lot of plot, mainly due to time restrictions. 


>> ARTICLE
I understand that, but since we're comparing different media we can't ignore the inherent limitations that anime brings to the table.

Arguably, I would have to say Dragon Ball. Only because the fillers are so cheestastic that it's hard to not love them. 

I mean, come on. Goku and Piccolo can fly faster than the speed of sound, but they're both being forced to learn how to DRIVE? That's so delightfully wacky!
>> ARTICLE
DBZ might be the only series where the filler episodes are as entertaining as the main story arcs. I think it helps that the whole series tends to be on the goofy side.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai - worth watching in 1080p, *the* best animation I've ever seen. Condenses the novels, but from what I've heard the author thought the books were a bit too rambly himself.
>> ARTICLE
Ghost in the Shell movie. The manga is good in its own way, but the Major is almost a completely different character, where in the movie she's more aloof while in the manga she has a more playful, carefree attitude. 
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree. I think the manga tried to deal with the same deep or disturbing issues, sometimes even with the same methods. But the way the characters were drawn got in the way a little bit. When it was made into a movie it lost it's humour but grew up as a work.
>> ARTICLE
I'll go a step further and actually say that Stand Alone Complex is better than the movie(s).
>> ARTICLE
This I can not get behind. The movies and the Show are two different animals. The movie is much more philosophical and was made when the creator was in a different state of mind, for the show I think he followed a much more standard formula, more fight scenes and less dialogue. I personally like them equally. 
>> ARTICLE
The movie was about philosophy and the series was about politics. 

I tend to enjoy the latter more. 
>> ARTICLE
The thing with the movie is that it created an atmosphere unlike any other. With SAC, it was more on plot and how Section 9 works as compared to the movie where it immerses you in this rich world where the boundary between humans and cyborgs are blurred (basically a copy-paste of the synopsis I know). 

I liked SAC, but SAC didn't even come close to engaging you the viewer into the highly detailed atmosphere that made up New Port City. And that's why I favor it over the series that followed. 
>> ARTICLE
2nd Gig was more engaging for me than the movie. But that's like, my opinion.

Seto no Hanayome, the manga just doesn't work for me.

*Nichijou, Clannad, Hyouka*... ***NICHIJOU***...

Yeah, pretty much **everything** KyoAni works on.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed Hyouka is on your list. Have you read the manga, or visual novel? If so, where can I? I don't want my Hyouka experience to only end with the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Light novel, not visual novel.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for my noob-ness when it comes to this matter. I have been watching anime and reading manga for years but I don't have any experience with Light Novels.
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka's actually not a light novel but a normal novel. The main difference is writing style and lack of illustrations.
>> ARTICLE
No problem. I've been watching anime for years, but I haven't really read any light novels yet either. I can see how you might get light novels and visual novels confused, though they have similar names light novels are  a type of book and visual novels are a type of video game (you probably already knew that, but just in case). I just thought it'd be a good idea to correct you before you go searching around for a Hyouka visual novel.
>> ARTICLE
The Haruhi LN are pretty good...
>> ARTICLE
I actually prefer the VN of Clannad to the anime. Might be because I played it before I watched the anime, but the VN is still number one in my heart.
>> ARTICLE
C...Clannad? You really think the anime is better than the VN? After Story's anime version might have a better impact than the VN, but I think overall the game kicks the show's ass.
>> ARTICLE
hmm... Re-thinking it, I guess you could say they're about *equal*, but it's still a matter of taste. In terms of notoriety, anyway, I think the anime has totally surpassed the VN.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, absolutely. I can't think of a VN that is more popular than its anime counterpart.

Anyways, speaking of Clannad I can't fucking wait for Tomoyo After to finally be released.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Stay Nights VN is more popular than the anime for obvious reasons.
>> ARTICLE
I think you meant to say the [Tsukihime VN] (/s "in before there is no Tsukihime anime"). 
>> ARTICLE
**Gintama**. The first anime I'd ever seen that managed to be better and more entertaining than the manga. I think the kind of comedy in *Gintama* works better as an anime than a manga. It helps that the anime opens up a whole new level of fourth-wall-breaking jokes with the voice actors.

I also thought that the anime adaption of the **Seirei no Moribito** light novel was much better even though they changed a bit of the story and added more filler. I actually found the light novel to be sparse and disappointing when I read it. 
>> ARTICLE
Haruhi for me. I didn't like the English translation of the first volume so I went on ahead and read the original Japanese and it was the same bland writing. Kyoto really went above and beyond in their adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed the books, but I have to say - aside from the island they adapted the material 1:1. They literally changed anything. They did a good job adapting the novel, but the anime is just as good as the novel because it's a very faithful adaptation.

For the island story... KyoAni did only tone that story down (or censored it, if you want to call it that way) for the Japanese tv because alcohol and minors are a no-go.
>> ARTICLE
> For the island story... KyoAni did only tone that story down (or censored it, if you want to call it that way) for the Japanese tv because alcohol and minors are a no-go.

The version they ran came from the manga.  And yes, there was something toned down in there: the original novel references Kyon and Haruhi doing something "shameful" while under the influence of alcohol that they refuse to talk about later.  Read into that what you will.
>> ARTICLE
It's not overly surprising, coming from KyoAni.
>> ARTICLE
Just remember, there's a lot that hasn't been animated.
>> ARTICLE
Hard to imagine Haruhi being interesting without those memorable voices, the OP and ED, etc. If only they animated all the LNs...

>> ARTICLE
I thought the last episode was weak. Really weak. A bunch of AMV-style screens that was flashed around and supposed to mirror the novel and actually made no sense - what?!
>> ARTICLE
My favourite will be the second one, but I must explain to you :

5 Centimeters per Second are short stories about distances :

The first one is about physical distances, Akari and Tohno have been separated since she had to move away, and now Tohno is going to move even further away.

The second one is about emotional distances : Kanae is really close to Tohno and yet so far away from each other, they go home together every day after school, etc. , although she's in love with Tohno, he cannot think about anybody but Akari.

The third episode is about "time distances" : Akari and Tohno have been separated by physical distances, but due to that, they talked less and less often (Hence the ending, at a moment they are going for mail, they are happy at first and then they don't receive letters from each other anymore, leading them to lost touch), and by the time they were both adult Akari kinda forgot about Tohno and is even getting married to someone. 

The last episode really shows how both physical distance and time can destroy someone, just look at Tohno's unhealthy lifestyle, his appartment. Hopefully he could move on at the ending, where he seems to see someone that looks like Akari, and the train passes, the woman didn't wait for him, and he just smiled and moved on.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I understand the story. I read the "unofficial" comparisons between the novel and the movie (that I linked above), and I have to say the last third was terribly adapted.
My favorite was the first third.

http://5cm.lhyeung.net/03-5cmpersecond-comparison.php

Read the comparison between the last "chapter" of the novel and the last third of the movie. I was astounded as to what was fleshed out in detail in the novel that was completely glossed over in the last third. Nearly all of Tohno's girlfriends/other girls he associated with after Akari are not mentioned, nor is his history with them.
>> ARTICLE
The novel wasn't the source for the movie, the movie was the source for the novel...So this doesn't really count as the movie risinn above its source. 
>> ARTICLE
Novel felt better last episode. If it was an adaptation, it works much better.

http://5cm.lhyeung.net/novel.php
>> ARTICLE
Oh. TIL.
>> ARTICLE
It's a close call, but Higurashi's manga is better than the anime or visual novel versions before it.

When a certain young girl with a speech impediment commits suicide by knife, the amount of detail and horror is much better demonstrated in the manga than the other versions.  Truly a better experience than any other medium Higurashi chose to go in.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget the double-page (iirc) hospital scene. That image still haunts me.
>> ARTICLE
Nah man,  the 1500 seconds spread page is the best
>> ARTICLE
I may be flayed alive for this but...

One Piece. 

I love the stories, I love the characters, but I find that often the manga itself is too "busy" artistically for my tastes, and that the anime is easier to follow. (Usually the opposite is the case)
>> ARTICLE
I like the complexity of the manga and the layers Oda puts into his art. It rewards those readers who go back and read them, leading to new discoveries or now-blatantly obvious foreshadowing. One Piece, like a fine wine, matures beautifully with time. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm the exact opposite, I really can't stand the anime, didn't like Toei's animation. I'm already used to Oda's erratic scenes since I was a kid so the anime isn't really necessary for me.
>> ARTICLE
Usually, I will see be reading a manga and the manga will maybe have one issue a month. Suddenly, an anime adaption comes out and there aren't enough chapters for a full season. So seeing how the anime creates an ending makes me happy.
>> ARTICLE
Anime writers creating their own ending to an adaptation of an unfinished manga almost never do it right. Fullmetal Alchemist is a good example. The part after divergence from the manga was crappy enough they redid the entire series following the manga very closely.
>> ARTICLE
I wish they'd do this with Elfen lied, they still had 13 or so chapters of story they could have animated
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, I am still reading some mangas that have never really gotten to a point far enough for the story to really get good when compared to their animes left me happy at the end. While it is rare though, there is still a percentage of things that go right.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think the first FMA's original ending was bad, and I'm pretty sure the reason they redid the entire series was just that FMA's manga was insanely popular and a proper anime adaptation was going to make money regardless.
>> ARTICLE
Shuffle and maybe bakemonogatari
>> ARTICLE
I don't want to say it rose above its source material, but Fullmetal Alchemist (original anime) did an amazing job after splitting off from the manga. There are even things that I feel the anime did better than the manga (it has been so long since I watched it that I unfortunately cannot go into more detail at the moment). 
>> ARTICLE
I usually like the anime more in all cases but maybe that is because I can't  really get into the feelings and such in text and images, same with books :(
>> ARTICLE
Well, you're still a young  whippersnapper.
>> ARTICLE
School Rumble
>> ARTICLE
I agree that often the source is better than the anime. But if the adaptation is done right I find it hard to say which is better (unless it was meant to improve a failed original). I think an adaptation is done well if the anime makes you want to read the original and vice versa.
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou definitely is one. Actually, if I had only read the manga, I'd have been perplexed as to why KyoAni chose to adapt it in the first place; I would not have identified it as being worthy material.

Also, Excel Saga the anime became a very different specimen than Excel Saga the manga; I haven't read enough of the manga to make a definitive conclusion as to which is better, but I can guarantee that there's a lot of people who wouldn't like both.
>> ARTICLE
I Thought Aki Sora had a better anime/ova series than manga run. I seen the animated version first so I may be partially biased, but in the manga thing the relationships seemed far more superficial and unrealistic.
>> ARTICLE
The standout instance for me would be Gintama
>> ARTICLE
the VA's and music make it awesome
>> ARTICLE
Working!, IMO.
I tried reading the manga...found it boring.
The anime, though, was hilarious.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero
>> ARTICLE
Nurarihyon no Mago was awesome, as the music made the series for me. An Fukuyama kicked ass in his role.
>> ARTICLE
Depending on what your preferences are, some might say the first Full Metal Alchemist anime is more enjoyable than where the manga ends up. I personally agree with this sentiment for the most part, although it has been a long time since I've seen the first anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Oreimo, Toradora, and possibly SAO right now.
>> ARTICLE
The light novels for SAO are far more detailed and provides a much more engrossing experience than the anime.

The anime is very good, but the light novels are near perfection.
>> ARTICLE
I am almost to Volume 8 of the LN and can say that while the LN's are very good, especially Volume 1, take for example Episode 11 of SAO as opposed to the LN...there was NO WAY that the LN could recreate the feel of that scene of color of trees and the huge lake, not to mention their house. You could maybe try but the anime brought it to life is what I am trying to get at so while the LN's as a story and "overall feel" are better, they just can't get past the high SAO anime budget.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 2 was a dealbreaker for me. I really liked Aria (even though it's a retcon) and the sloppy adaptation that butchers the characterization makes it so that I can't like it more than the source material. The rest of the material has been mostly good so far, given how much they needed to cut out. I just wish they had given that two episodes and cut from something else instead... like the murder mystery.
>> ARTICLE
The anime had a endless 6-7 episodes of horrible-ness where although it was needed ...was just.. I don't know.
>> ARTICLE
>the high SAO anime budget.

What?
>> ARTICLE
The budget for the show is quite high compared to other shows. The animation more so to say.
>> ARTICLE
The animation is lackluster at best, you can clearly see it at the action scenes.
>> ARTICLE
Lackluster? Lackluster would be lower than baseline of which I would disagree on.
>> ARTICLE
For aniplex it is lower than baseline. The flop, that is guilty crown might have something to do with it.
>> ARTICLE
thats funny because the animation in the anime is subpar at best for such a budget.
>> ARTICLE
Really? I thought it had some of the best animation and budget THIS SEASON. Of course then we have very high budgeted and animated crap like Guilty Crown a few seasons ago.
>> ARTICLE
I greatly enjoyed Guilty Crown, though its probably because i went into it not expecting much. And saying this season is unfair because the vast majority of shows this seasons is slice-of-life stuff with little emphasis on the animation. Fate/Zero is a perfect example of cinematic-level of animation, though it did have a budget capable of buying Belgium.
>> ARTICLE
>near perfection

I think the novel had very noticeable problems. It's a very entertaining read but it could have been FAR better than it is. Vol 1 and Vol 2 author notes are full of apologies about those problems.

Heck, I read somewhere that the guy is working on a remake novel that fuses Vol1 all the side stories into a more streamlined and not so disjointed experience. 
>> ARTICLE
I heard the SAO anime adaption is just decent and the novels are much better and have a lot more detail. I can't even imagine how you can say this about Toradora, the light novels are so much better...
>> ARTICLE
I prefered the anime more?
>> ARTICLE
But those are the LN own natural advantages. It will obviously have far more world building, more scenes, more dialogue, and more information.

But the LN can't do audio, visuals and, in SAO's case, it definitively can't deliver the subtlety the anime displayed for some moments.

In my opinion, SAO anime is a better experience than SAO LN.
>> ARTICLE
Howl's Moving Castle, Welcome to the NHK (for me, at least), and Death Note (sort of. The manga is great, but I really think that the anime captured it perfectly. Also, the dub is better than the original Japanese, but that might just be me).
>> ARTICLE
I'd have to disagree on Howl's Moving Castle. As brilliant as the movie was,  it's pretty on-par with the novel in terms of being awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
Did you read the manga or LN for Welcome to the NHK? I felt the NHK manga was way better because it makes Misaki a better charecter. It shows more of her selfishness and other things.
>> ARTICLE
I read a little bit of the manga, but felt that it dragged on at the beginning, so I gave up after a few chapters. I'll probably get around to reading it full completely eventually; the anime didn't really pick up for several episodes, anyways (after the episode where he just sat there masturbating the whole time).
>> ARTICLE
It differs from the anime in more than one way. You should read it. Instead of taking multiple episodes for one problem it puts the speed of the anime into hyperdrive while adding original story lines.
>> ARTICLE
**Preamble:**

This is the third of the shows I started in Summer/Spring 2011 and for some reason stopped watching on the 9th episode. Denpa Onna was another, and the last show on the Anime Club, and rewatching it reminds me that it simply *tired* me. But Usagi Drop and the other show, Mawaru Penguindrum, which I rewatched last year, are shows I remember enjoying, but just put aside for some reason or another.

I remember liking it, as I like shows such as Barakamon, Gingitsune, etc. Some might say it's for the "healing" effect, but I think it might be a tad more for the bitter half of "bitter-sweet" that makes me swell up with feelings. I'm really eager to watch this again, this time all the way through.

The art, yes, the water-colour style. Though the faces always struck me as a bit weird, it's still one of the better looking shows out there, as far as I'm concerned.

The OP is a nice little number, evokes the feel of a children's show, both in visuals and in tune, which is appropriate.

The ED just doesn't do it for me, not much to say about it.

**Episode 1:**

There's something about this setup that reminds me fairy tales, with step-mothers. Is this a real issue or worry in Japanese culture? I remember feeling the same in Grave of the Fireflies, and perhaps another series or two, where relatives get children to take care of, and shirk the duty. In western television, it's usually a heartfelt story of making a new family, or more often a turn to the comic.

That moment with Rin and the flowers was great. Rin, I recall, is one of my favourite children in anime, not as a personality, but just as being there. Like Naru's actress from Barakamon, she's actually played by a child, who was 9 years old when the series began, and 10 when it ended.

Daikichi helping wind the clock shows what everyone said, how he is taking up the mantle of his grandfather's role, how he fills that role for everyone. Also, he acted without thinking things all the way through, and now, as with all decisions in life, we'll see how it plays out.

Kana Ueda was instantly noticeable as Haruko.

**Episode 2:**

The part with thanking for the food they're about to eat, it's not just to show the different in culture, or how one's "behaving properly" as opposed to the other, or *just* to show how Daikichi's life is being changed by the alien entity, but also that he was used to living alone, while Rin came from a household where she lived with another.

"Wait, so I I'm going to double my commute time *or* get there by 18:00?!" Ah yes, seeing your life turned upside down. Daikichi makes a promise, and we see him break it immediately. That's actually part and parcel not just of adult life, but of being a parent. You're going to break promises, life just doesn't let you get it any other way. The question is whether you make light of it, and ignore that, or not, I guess.

I'm reminded of when I had to pick my baby brother from the nursery school, which was 7 or so minutes to get to downhill, and about double that uphill, for 11 or so years old me. My 4 years old brother took considerably longer, and I would get terribly impatient. Hm, memories.

Also, the bed-wetting post-credits scene was precious. And in the next episode preview the little girl's Engrish was much better than most voice actors'.

**Episode 3:**

So, the first episode is the decision, the second episode is seeing its effects on one's life, in terms of "Woah, change, dude!" and the third is the *price*. We see that Daikichi is a new parent, and naturally that means he's part of a long chain of parents, so he seeks the advice of, and hears from the experiences of those who came before him. Rin's issues with death are also similar, being a human, she gets to reflect on the fact that people die. Death and little kids, all wrapped up in a tangle.

So yes, more please!

[SPACE BROTHERS](http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers)

It's basically the anime version of the movie "The Right Stuff" (no, not exactly, just same theme)

You'll have a goofy smile on your face after every single episode, each one better than the one before it. Its only problem is that it ran out of manga to adopt, so it's on hiatus for now, but it ended at a decent spot. The protagonist is voiced by the same guy as the protagonist of Tiger and Bunny, which I like for the sole reason that the protagonist is a middle aged father, instead of in high school. Space Brothers also has two adult protagonists, though it flashes back to when they were kids all the time. I sense a theme here....

How the fuck has no one said Nichijou? I know there are a couple hundred of you out there that binge watch Nichijou skits on youtube from time to time. It's seriously unescapable once you get into it. I've wasted away hours watching Nichijou as deadlines loom but I don't regret a single minute, that show makes me happy.

Hanasaku Iroha, Silver Spoon, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou

The main cast are lovable. You watch them go through life and all the character development that comes with it, yet they remains admirable throughout. Their lives are colored full of drama, so in their moment of triumph you will feel warm, and in their moment of recollection you will feel nostalgic.
>> ARTICLE
I'll try Silver Spoon, sounds like it could really warm up the heart.
>> ARTICLE
If you want the full experience, watch it on an empty stomach.
>> ARTICLE
I'll try xD
>> ARTICLE
Isn't the Pet Girl of Sakurasou fairly sad?
>> ARTICLE
It's a rollercoaster. There are sad parts, some incredibly so, but also a lot of uplifting parts, and overall the tone of that show is pretty positive (not in a "everything is going to be awesome" kind of way, but more of a "despite things being hard, we're still taking them on in awesome ways"). The series also ends on a high note.

I thought drama was okay because he listed Chuunibyou and Golden Time as examples, and Sakurasou is definitely in the same category.
>> ARTICLE
It gets very dramatic and sad at times, but it's funny and well done at the same time. Would recommend
>> ARTICLE
I.. I wouldn't really recommend Sakurarou no Pet no Kanojo to a guy looking for a feels-good anime. That speech man, I was not expecting the feels. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean, the speech was OKAY not like amazing or anything, there are much for scenes to where you can go for feeltrips.
>> ARTICLE
Such as ? 

Aside from the speech I don't think anything made go on a feelstrip.

Yeah watched it and got obsesed with it!

remove the "good" part and i will suggest anohana and clannad. but for the feel good part, ill go with ao haru ride
>> ARTICLE
Anohana didn't really tickle my fancy, but I'll check out Ao Haru Ride.

i thought so, i mentioned that if you remove the "good" part., anohana is a feel anime, but it had me shed some manly tears.

Well, along with all the other recommandation, there is Kimi ni Todoke that has a lot of very cute moment and one of the sweetest main duo. Recently, I've also been watching Skip beat! that is very good on the comedy and soon become very adorable on the main couple.

I've been reading the Kimi ni Todoke manga, how diffrent is it from the anime?

The genre you are looking for is Slice of Life, and quite a few people (myself included) have a similar view toward anime (who needs battles and drama when you can have episodes of pure happiness). My favorite animes are often Slice of Life and/or Comedy. 

Some personal recommendations:  

Comedies:

[Aria](http://myanimelist.net/anime/477/Aria_the_Animation)  
[Hanasaku Iroha](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9289/Hanasaku_Iroha)  

SoL with Feels/Romance (for when you feel up to it - better be ready for dem feels):  
[Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo)

[Nagi no Asukara](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16067/Nagi_no_Asukara)  
[Kokoro Connect](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11887/Kokoro_Connect)  

This is just a small list of the many SoL out there, mostly consisting of the ones I have personally seen and enjoyed. Should definitely keep you going for a while.  







>> ARTICLE
I totaly agree! Who said good anime had to have drama and death!?  

I'll have to try out D-Frag, Ano Hi Mita Hana, and Nagi no Asukara. Those are the ones I've not watched before and look interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Himegoto
>> ARTICLE
I think Barakamon, which you mentioned, is one of the best feel good anime I've seen. It's a story about a man struggling with his life, his goals, and his accomplishments. He goes to an area that actually calms and heals his soul, which I believe is conveyed onto the viewer, too. 
>> ARTICLE
The Tatami Galaxy? It gets a little redundant, but the ending was amazing imo
>> ARTICLE
FLCL.

The story gets better as you age because it hits a piece of nostalgia everyone can relate to. Those teen years and finding out what its like to grow up and become an adult. It gets better as you age because of your furthering distance from those teenage years, it knows how to bring you back. 

Or at least, fake it. 6 episodes long, each just about right. Sorry if this sounds cliche. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll check it out :D


>> ARTICLE
Not cliche. I totally agree with you. I remember the exact way I felt/time when I watched that anime and it brings back such good memories. The whole thing is such a ride of feel good excellence. Visual cocaine. Brb going to start 4th watch through. 
>> ARTICLE
I do not agree at all. I found the series to be like a fever dream.
>> ARTICLE
That's how I feel about Excel Saga. I watched when I was sick/depressed in college in a dark apartment room. I marathoned the whole thing in and out of sleep and meds. 
>> ARTICLE
Dunno about that, I found FLCL quite depressing.
>> ARTICLE
I feel a tinge of depression because of the nostalgia of where I was in life when I first saw it. It reminds me to pass along the message to the younger people in my life to enjoy being a kid while you can, and be ready to face the responsibilities of an adult when the time comes.

Also choose Ninamori.

Wow, that's not one I would have though would ever see the light of day in America.  Good to see NIS trying some more unique localizations.

And sadly, "dead" is probably a better way of describing Bandai's hands at this point. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh how I wish they would release some of their older Gundam titles on Bluray. Hell, Gurren Lagann is a no brainer even.
>> ARTICLE
Someone asked if they would consider licensing Nichijou during the NIS America panel at ACEN...all they ever say to these types of questions is "We can neither confirm nor deny."
>> ARTICLE
I doubt Nichijou would get localized. I loved that anime to death, but it didn't even do well in Japan according to Kyoani.
>> ARTICLE
From what I gather, it apparently has a larger online and western following than it does in its domestic Japanese market.
>> ARTICLE
It's going to be hard for the dub to top the voice acting in Usagi Drop.  The show got a lot of its charm from using very talented child voice actors and actresses for the children.  I wonder if NIS will do the same.
>> ARTICLE
I was impressed by Usagi Drop for that very reason: they got actual children to voice children.
>> ARTICLE
NIS dosen't do dubs.

I like NISA since they seem to pick up a lot of the shows I consider good. The only thing I don't like about them is their weird box shapes.

I too am excited I'm just unsure of their quality, yes I want to purchase this but with NIS's track record with their releases often times there is some screw up on their part that requires a replacement program. 

None the less happy to see this awesome, awesome show get a US release. Don't confuse this show with "Listen To Me Girls I'm Your Father" being released by Sentai Filmworks.

Watamote: I get why people might like that type of comedy. It just isn't for me.
>> ARTICLE
I watched it all and I think it's meh, but that one time when she [spoiler...?](/s "made up that she was dating that one guy she met at the library") I had to stop just before what happened next because I was cringing too hard.
>> ARTICLE
It is awesome if you just like comedy where the perpetrator gets what is coming to them. And that is usually Tomoko herself, making mountains out of molehills. All exacerbated by her loneliness and social anxiety.

It is bordering on being dark comedy so I  can understand if not everyone likes that. But it does have its moments of sweetness too though, in unexpected places. So it is not really cringe/dark humor all the time.
>> ARTICLE
It's a show that walks a fine line between making you want to hug Tomoko or slap her.
>> ARTICLE
But... but... [METAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PHbR3xf6Vs)!!

The OP and EDs were the best part of that show IMO.

Hell yeah! :-D
>> ARTICLE
I just couldn't watch more than one episode. Not because it's bad, but... I just can't watch it. 

I don't really want to call it too cringe-y, but I guess that's what it is?
>> ARTICLE
I feel you. I watched that to the bitter end out of sheer awe and it is best compared to clenching your ass as hard as you can after filling up your anal cavity with needles.
>> ARTICLE
I gave up on hope for Tomoko around episode 2. It was a relaxing comedy after that.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka. It didn't do much for me, but I see why people love it. It has some good twists and a very original story.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure that most people like it for its twists. Although I admit that they're shocking, it's also impressive when a show can have its twists spoiled (how many people watch Madoka these days without knowing at least one major twist?) and still be fantastic. For me it was its high quality (both art and music), pointed direction, and interesting characters, not the story, which is not actually that original.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing I knew about madoka going in was that it was dark and not all cutesy like it made out to be. [When](/s "people started dying, I was really surprised, I wasn't expecting it to be that dark.")
>> ARTICLE
I was the same, I went in knowing it got dark and was legitimately surprised by the twists
>> ARTICLE
The plot actually is kind of reminiscent of all those magical girl queen characters who have fallen to darkness and is in need of saving by magical girls in the beginning of magical girl anime. A lot of Precure shows already had the bad guys  creating an unwinnable situations where the girls needed to fight back.
>> ARTICLE
TTGL. I tried watching it and was just not finding it enjoyable were as my friend next to me was laughing and smiling non stop. Still as far as I know its one of the best Mecha animes out there and actually has a solid plot later into it, I might watch it one day just not soon.
>> ARTICLE
Same. I liked GL, but it wasn't really my thing compared to everyone else. I do acknowledge it as being a really cool thing with how crazy and over the top it is along with it's sense of evolution from the beginning to the end, I just don't at all see it as a top 10 favorite or anything. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually do think TTGL could be enjoyed as a light watch too. As bombastic as the show is, it does have certain nuances to its characters that makes it worth paying attention to.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari. It's like PowerPoint the anime
>> ARTICLE
The series really requires a multiple watch. I'm into my second watch and I realized I watched the first time on cruise control. I'm picking up on so much the second time around, and I'm really amazed I missed so much.

Hyouka

I don't think I understand why people like this but it would seems like this show got a lot of love among the community.

I'm still watching it, currently on ep 10 and I found my mind constantly wandering off, the plot just doesn't pulls me and everything just seems to be over-dramatic due to the music and the cinematography. After every episode I kept asking myself whether I want to sit through another, that's the kind of feeling I have.

Please don't kill me, I think this might get a lot of hate but I truly want to understand this show and why people like it. I guess I'll pull the quote in the show: "I'm curious!"
>> ARTICLE
I recently finished watching Hyouka and I liked it. I gave it a 7 though, it was good but I don't really see why anyone would give it a 10/10. The art was good, the colors were nice, the comedy was good, and the theme was great. 

The penultimate meaning of the show was a relatively simple that many high school boys go through, the question of "why even bother?" and the show serves to, and sucessfully answers that question. It's nowhere near as deep or complex as shows that explore the ultimate despair of What life can be like Clannad:AS. Or how you should make the absolute most of what you have to be the happiest you can, even when you have almost no time to do so the way Plastic memories did. It didn't ask any hard hitting questions like "How far will you go and what will you sacrifice for the ones you care about?" Like Ping Pong did. 


When actually compared to any of my 10/10(or even 9's) I just don't see how it holds up. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for the input. Indeed when I subjectively pitch this show vs some of my favorites (Ping pong, Sakurasou, Oregairu, Mawaru Penguindrum and more), this show doesn't even come close. I stopped at ep 13 last night and I guess I'm starting to see why people mentioned the characters interaction is wonderful, but I just saw a bit of brilliance, without the story pulling me ultimately it would wear off rather quickly. I guess I have to finish it to understand it, but so far it does not look good.
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka is good. It's just not as great as a lot of people say it is. My favorite part is the Festival arc and the final episode. The Festival arc is probably the longest and can be considered a good chunk of the "main" content. The final few episodes really put things together though, they reveal that the entire show itself serves to fit a theme which is done really well. 


>> ARTICLE
Hyouka has a lot of subtextual themes. I personally rate it as a masterpiece and it's literally my favourite series.

Outside of the fact that it's directed to absolute perfection, the production quality is insane and it sounds amazing (you can tell whether characters are talking in a room or not, the use of classical music, etc) the original material from the author has some great examples of various writing devices like Foil for example.

I guess what has me so invested in the series is that Oreki mirrors me as a person a fair amount. He appears lazy but really isn't, he, like me, is the kind of person who will give you an answer in 200 words rather than 1,000. At the start of the series he's quite clearly suffering some form of depression (oh boy I know what that's like) but as he develops as a character, we get to see different sides of him.

I guess it's just because of how it resonated with me personally but it's literally the one series I look to that I can take apart piece by piece and still love it unconditionally.

>> ARTICLE
Thank you for your explanation! I'm glad you found this show to be masterfully done. Indeed the art and music is gorgeous with good directing, a lot of perspective I watched is truly refreshing and engaging. But when I start to link these to the main body which is the story it just fell apart, to me the story is the weakest link and oh my the story just moves so slowly. I do get the point where viewers can relate to the characters thus bringing them closer to the show, I have some shows where certain circumstances faced by the characters closely resembles what has happened around me. 

All in all this show just doesn't click with me, yet. I will finish it today and maybe I can see why it is so highly regarded by so many people. 
>> ARTICLE
I think there's a certain way to do this kind of pacing and only Kyoto Animation have done it this well in my opinion.

It's like comparing pacing to walking I guess. Most walk at a brisk pace and get through what they do as you see things go by. This kind of pacing is like standing still every few minutes as you walk just to kind of drink in. I understand why these shows are difficult to get into but it doesn't make them any less special when done just right.

I think the actual plot arcs kind of come second to the actions of each of the characters to me. It's much more rewarding just to see how different each of them are by the end of the series.

That and you can literally grab random frames and use them as desktop backgrounds.

Evangelion. Basically, the reason so many people love it is the same reason why so many people hate it. Shinji is a very accurately written 14-year-old that almost everyone can relate to...but 14-year-olds are fucking insufferable, and if my 14-year-old self and I ever existed at the same point in time, I would murder him. 

Pretty much every character is the same, in that their character traits are incredibly divisive and the arguments for and against them are basically the same. Except Pen Pen, he's the man.
>> ARTICLE
Evangelion goes into extremes when it tries to do anything - plot twists, character development, world building, etc. 'We need a crazy person - okay let's make this person as psychotic as human limit can go' sort of extreme. It's one of the things that set this series apart from (and for some people, sets it above) others, because it doesn't know the words holding back.
>> ARTICLE
Biggest culprit for me is Hyouka. Great characters and great interaction between them. Interesting and peculiar mysteries and problems. Gorgeous visuals and production values (it's Kyoani after all). Shame the execution bored the hell out of me personally - the pace is just a tad too slow for me. I rather it be a 12 episode show rather than 24 but that's just me. I'll probably finish it one day. On a similar note, Sakurako-san is in the exact same situation (and without the Kyoani flair to boot). Though I'm finishing that because I'm already 9 episodes in.

I also tend to avoid whole genres like Shoujo or moe. I completely understand why people watch them but I only watch ones that I feel have a unique twist to them (ex. Gakkou Gurashi).
>> ARTICLE
Clannad. I get why they like it, and it's a good series, but I'm a bigger fan of kanon. 

Also, kyoani made welcome to the new?

Eh, of the kyoani trinity, i liked Air the most, followed by Clannad and then Kanon.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I also like Air the most! I've never seen anyone else with the same opinion.

I liked Air but it just confused me and i felt like nothing changed at the end
>> ARTICLE
Same for Clannad, but for different reasons. I personally just can't get into nor get over the drawing style. I've tried to watch it multiple times and just never got into it because I kept being thrown off by their faces.

I'm sure it's a lovely show with a lovely story, but nope, can't do it.

Welcome to the NHK was animated by Gonzo, OP wasn't trying to imply that though. The only KyoAni show in that particular parenthesis is Haruhi.

Thanks for clearing it up. I was very confused.

I absolutely adore Kanon as well.

I like Kanon a lot, I would place it above Clannad even, but it is no where near After Story levels in my opinion

Your reasons for people liking FLCL is only like 50% of what people like about FLCL, but I digress

Nisekoi. You wanna laugh, you wanna look at hot anime babes. Fair enough

Code Geass (and NGNL by extension). They know what they're doing, crazy plot-twists and great art. Fun characters, over the top situations. Good shows to shut your brain off to

> Nisekoi

IMO Nisekoi isn't funny by a long shot. (for me)
The humor is average. And the whole series is just teasing. But oh well we still get one of the best waifus (Chitoge) from there.

Humour is subjective. I personally found Nisekoi a lot funnier than a lot of other comedy anime I've seen.

> You wanna laugh, you wanna look at hot anime babes. Fair enough

I was still trying to figure out why I enjoyed it so much, I think you just summed up 100%.

Wat.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, for a show that came out 8 years ago, it holds up pretty damn well.

Hey, guilty crown had WAY better art design and look what that got us...

True true, I still don't understand the Art choice for Code Geass though

>> ARTICLE
cut the guy a slack maybe he's italian and it's nice to see his people represented
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass: At 14 I started to read about military tactics and I read a lot I think after some years a friend recommended to me the Anime, saying that Lelouch was a great strategist, thinker, who could guess what the enemies would do before they fight, treating him like a god of strategy, but when I saw the anime I saw him using one of the worst strategies for the scenario, with high losses for both team and didn't thinking two steps ahead of enemy.
>> ARTICLE
thats kinda a given did you see his chess move tho
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you. Lelouche was actually a shit strategist. His optical powers saved so many times when he would have lost if he was a normal human. I'm not denying his overall intelligence but a great strategist? Never, I'm with you on that.
>> ARTICLE
Lelouch was also a great strategist in context of the show, realistically he was terrible, but in the show everyone else was worse so he was great. 

but strategy was also fucked by the concept of super units and the shiny new mech concept ( aka shinkiro intro).  The gurren was captured, Shen Hu practically disable but the combined forces of the CF and britannia in Lloyds were going to be defeated because of the new mech? Then later when they were trying to reclaim japan the shinkiro all of a sudden goes from being able to deal w/ 3 super units and an army to having it's hands full w/ one. 

>> ARTICLE
I didn't really enjoy it but I can understand why people liked NGNL, and if I try really hard I can see the same for Death Note and Attack on Titan
>> ARTICLE
I've never been very fond of Gurren Lagann. I just found it to be waaaay too crazy and Kamina annoyed the shit out of me. I get that the show isn't taking itself seriously, but when a mech trillions of light years tall is using *galaxies* as weapons, I just can't help but roll my eyes. Plus the ending infuriates me. There were two characters in particular that didn't deserve what they got TT_TT

That being said, I totally understand why people love the series. It's crazy fun, it's hilarious, and it's got a lovable cast of characters that go through a lot of development. It's a great show, but it's really just not my cup of tea. 

Though I don't think I'll ever understand why everyone likes Kamina so much ...
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate: The time travel stuff is done really well, the John Titor stuff was interesting and all the pop culture references were great, but it never really grabbed me as much as it seemed to with other people. I just found the pacing way too slow and the harem aspect with all the dates across the timelines didn't gel with me.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly.many people seems to like this show.but pacing is slow and at somepoint it becomes so confusing.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. I watched it after finishing Madoka Magica so Okarin's struggle just didn't impact me as much.

Also Kurisutina. A friend of mine loves her but I fail to see what's so special about the character, any Christina fans that are willing to explain?
>> ARTICLE
Harem aspect?
>> ARTICLE
People always say there's a "harem" aspect to it, but I didn't really see it? I think it was mostly the [slight spoilers](/s "pointless Ruka date") that made people feel like it was a harem.
>> ARTICLE
also it's based on a vn where you could have him actually end up with any of the girls and they just went on animating one route as in f/sn for example. still wouldn't consider it a 'true' harem but i see where the idea might come from
>> ARTICLE
Well, it is a more "haremy" VN format (multiple parallel girl route, 1 "True End" route) compared to Type Moon's forced playing order
>> ARTICLE
hmm yeah i agree that f/sn wasn't an optimal comparison but maybe the one most people on here might be familiar with (=
>> ARTICLE
Most of the anime adaptations of VNs are way sub-par. In fact, I've never actually seen an anime adaptation of a VN that I liked even half as much as the original. Well except the masterpiece that is Tsukihime^best^anime^ever 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, Higurashi's was decent. It lost a lot of the small character moments that made Higurashi great, but it told the basic story pretty well. It helped that it was a kinetic novel, though.
>> ARTICLE
Check out Amagami SS if you haven't already done so.
>> ARTICLE
to be fair vn are even harder to adapt than a novel or similar due to the alternate storylines. i think a strong/faithful adaptation of one route is the best one can hope for.

also i've always been told there was no tsukihime anime /s .-P
>> ARTICLE
Oh of course, the "chose your own ~~harem~~ adventure" element of VNs is what makes them such a unique medium. It seems like the VN adaptations are fine for people who have not read the source material. For example: Majikoi, Kohime Musou, and even Tsukihime all received over average review regardless of the fact that most of the VN readers think they are trash, even going so far as to saying their anime equivalent don't exist. :-D

In the case of Tsukihime: it is absurd to think you can cover 30-50 hours of source material in a 1 season anime. What's ironic is that Fate Stay/Night and all of its iterations are highly regarded by both the VN and anime communities likely because they actually spent a fair amount of time and did some justice to the source material. Then again, I don't know I haven't seen either the VN or anime of FS/N.
>> ARTICLE
that's why i think that committing to one route is probably the safest bet for any adaptation, that also about evens the playing field for comparison with other adaptations, since there's always something getting cut out due to constraints in time and budget.

in the end a good adaptation is all about the care and effort put into it. the best ones are always those were you can see the creator's dedication and love for the source material.

i'd love to give you a recommendation about the fate franchise, but personally im more in love with the concept and lore of the franchise than any single installment (=
>> ARTICLE
Well, I acknowledge my love for Akiha from Tsukihime is fairly weird and non-traditional. I understand going with Arcueid as the main female protagonist since she is the obvious fan favorite. I guess the issue is that anyone who likes the non-traidional characters can feel a bit sleighed. For me that wasn't the issue, more so the hasty treatment of the story and just how jumbled it was.

Honestly though, the music from the anime was WONDERFUL and in my opinion far superior to most of the music in the VN. I fell in love with tracks like [The Selected Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VaWdrR9FyI&list=PLa10YQkKvZsNn9t_mzzoK1MuI2AAEqO95), [Vain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd3QdDmdzbo&index=18&list=PLa10YQkKvZsNn9t_mzzoK1MuI2AAEqO95) and [Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-lVm6UwwG8&index=21&list=PLa10YQkKvZsNn9t_mzzoK1MuI2AAEqO95). I don't know about the story writers, but the composer sure did an exquisite job!

Serial Experiments Lain: Yeah, I get that it's mature and deep, but it was so boring to me...

FLCL: Did not care for the puberty metaphor or whatever and I did not laugh too often, but I can appreciate Gainax's effort.

Mindgame: Pretty odd considering that I love Yuasa's other works (The Tatami Galaxy,  Kaiba and Ping Pong The Animation), but that movie was just too .... bizzare, I guess... hard to explain and the same thing applies to 

Paprika, since I like Kon's Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress. 

Also, Steins; Gate and it is not only the first half, but I can somewhat understand it's popularity.
>> ARTICLE
> Paprika, since I like Kon's Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress.


You're not alone. Visually, I think Paprika is amazing, and Kon's directing is really good. But I think Perfect Blue & Millennium Actress are much stronger as a whole. I think Perfect Blue has a stronger plot, and Millennium Actress has a simpler plot, but one that lets the focus be on the story-telling. So the combination of a convoluted plot and the hyper visuals made Paprika seem more confusing and just messier overall to me.

I really hated Full Metal Panic. I can only imagine people like it for the same reasons I don't. I find  Chidori and Sosuke annoying, some may find them entertaining. The fight scenes are well done and the animation is decent. 

But it just felt like it was having an identity crisis. One minute its a highschool slice of life comedy, and then it immediately turns into a action mech show, complete with PTSD, war crimes, and terrorism. I forced myself through the first season but I just can't do more than that.

The second season, Fumoffu, focuses completely on the high school slice of life, so no identity crisis in that one.  Chidori and Sousuke are dialed up to 11 though, so you'd probably find them even more annoying.

Shokugeki no Souma is a show that I did not enjoy very much mostly because I did not like any of the characters and didn't care about what was happening at all. However, I can definitely understand why other people like it as much as they do. The show is very good at building hype with it's over the top nature and soundtrack and if I liked any of the characters or was invested in what was going on at all I'm sure I would have liked it a lot more. With the way the shokugeki's are set up it's essentially a shounen sports anime with very short matches instead of 7 episode long ones. It also carries over a lot of tropes and elements from battle shounen but lacks any of the elements that turn people off of battle shounen series.

* Trigun

* Cowboy Bebop

* The Tatami Galaxy

Not a fan of these shows but I can kind of see why people like them.

Bebop and Trigun have some nice action scenes and they find the internal struggles of the characters to be interesting. 

For Tatami I guess they enjoyed the character interactions and found the MC to be relatable.

I could be wrong though.

I've had a friend recommending Tatami Galaxy for ages but it just doesn't seem like something I'd be into. Would you recommend it even after seeing it and not really enjoying it?

I am confident that everyone will enjoy Tatami if they payed enough attention to the subs and story. I guess being Japanese would make it easier to enjoy. Or at least knowing it.

I'd say it deserves a chance. Maybe watch an episode or two to get a feel for the show and see what you think of it.

FMA:B:  I didn't particularly enjoy it but I can easily understand why people do. It tells a good story, has great pacing and there is an interesting mix of characters.

Evangelion and Toradora. I mean, I can understand why people like them - Evangelion's story and characters appeal to some people, I guess, and it's not like Toradora is in any way bad. I'm just not a big fan of either of them; I feel like Shinji's mental problems kind of pull the rug out from under any impact (heh) his reactions and motivations had, but I can see how the story could definitely appeal to some. And with Toradora, It started out good but I've always felt that the ending could have been handled much better; it more or less feels like Ryuji was forced into his choice, and that always left a bad taste in my mouth. It's not exactly a bad story though, so I can see why people like it. I can't see why people think it's a good christmas show though. *Melancholy of Haruhi* is much better IMO.

Legend of the galactic heroes.

I don't like it because of it's rather slow pace and shallow plot points, but I know why everyone else loves it and I know why I would STILL recommend it to everyone.

It's The Elder Scrolls of animes, basically. The being said, I am an elder scrolls fan

The mech/suit type anime (specifically the Gundam series). I totally get it but the sci-fi genre just doesn't do it for me and I could never get into it.

Mech's focus ultimately is about hot blooded MCs and great justice (though there are some deviations), hence the split between /a/ and /m/ years back, the taste between mech fans and "normal" anime fans are too different. Take Garo, that's a fantasy/action anime set in a semi-medieval time, but it for all intents and purposes is a mech anime despite having no mech at all.

The closest anime i've ever watched to that genre was probably Guilty Crown. It basically confirmed my suspicions that i'd dislike that genre, but Guilty Crown was interesting enough to keep me to the end as the mechs weren't the focus.

Sakurako's been mildly disappointing so far. It had potential, sure, and that potential was what had me sticking with it, but...we're, what, nine episodes in now and the mysteries have all been pretty mediocre and the characters troublingly static. It feels like the same thing every episode, rather than fresh and varied, which episodic anime are absolutely capable of achieving (hell, that's one of the advantages of episodic anime--just look at Space Dandy). 

It's repetitiveness and flat characters (admittedly I do like the police officer, though on paper he's nothing special) are really dragging it down for me.

Attack on Titan.

I don't like it the same reason I don't like Game of Thrones. I primarily watch/read anime/shows/books for the characters and how they interact and grow, so when every character is basically expendable I end up not connecting with any of them because I think "why bother, they'll be dead soon?".

That being said, I completely understand their wild success. Brutal, fast paced action with an interesting concept and story make for a good time for most people.

**Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso / Your Lie in April**

I have ~~ranted~~ talked about this anime before on Reddit [many times now,](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3isj6q/wt_shigatsu_wa_kimi_no_uso_your_lie_in_april/) so this might seem familiar to some of you. 

I've several problems with the show as a whole--with the characters (especially Kaori), with the storytelling itself (flashbacks, deathflags...), and with the overall incredibly unsubtle emotional manipulation that was going on. 

However, I am very aware that a lot of people were very emotionally moved by the anime, rating it 10/10 with tags like "it made me cry," "so tragic and beautiful," and consider it one of their favorite shows. 

So while I don't have all that much respect for the anime itself, I do respect that many people *were* emotionally invested in Shigatsu and that it *did* have a lasting impact on them. I can understand why it's loved so much by its fans too (romance, pretty visuals...); I just can't regard it with the same dewy-eyes as they can.

* Note: I linked to the WT thread for Shigatsu above; where several people wrote some excellent commentary on the anime (you can also find some of my points in that thread as well).
>> ARTICLE
WOW! I thought I was the only one. I watched through around episode 10 and even though I though it was fairly moving I just couldn't watch it anymore. Of the anime I dropped in the middle, it sits alongside Girls Bravo. What's ironic is there are tons of shit tier anime I was able to watch until the end but this one I just couldn't do.
>> ARTICLE
You aren't the only one, it's just an unpopular opinion that gets downvoted often. The last time I talked about YliA I said my gripes and how it was predictable. By about 70% of the way through [I had figured out](/s "almost everything in that letter, which oddly enough, was the part that seemed to have gotten a lot of people becUse they weren't expecting it. ") like the guy above us said, the set a bunch of not so subtle 'hints' like [](/s " the 'aunt' LITERALLY saying "maybe someone else has to die for Arima to grow emotionally again". Or the cat being hit by the car and dying despite Arima's best efforts to save it.") 

There was also the [one inconsistency that I noticed where](/s "when Kaori was revealed to be in the local music circle, competing and such she first claimed to have no idea who Arima was. She didn't know his name or recognize his face. It seems normal until he walks into a dim lit room as an audience member and *literally everyone* recognizes him. There was no way that this girl who loved music all her life hadn't even heard once about this literal celebrity")
>> ARTICLE
Regarding that inconsistency[](/s "doesn't Kaori flat out say in her letter that Arima was the reason she wanted to play violin? At very least it was in a flashback we saw. It was part of her lie so that he wouldn't brush her off immediately.")

[Regarding the predictability](/s "I don't think it was supposed to be surprising that Kaori dies, or really the contents of the letter. I honestly didn't think they were going to go through the contents since it was so obvious. I think after the first episode I texted my friend who suggested it saying they better not be killing Kaori")

I think it was a very good show if you got invested in the story (hence why I rated it a 9), but if you didn't then there are quite a few issues, like its predictability and especially the pacing, which was awful. 
>> ARTICLE
One gripe I have about Your Lie in April and anime in general sometimes is how common and young geniuses are in their world.
>> ARTICLE
Throwing in AnoHana and 5cm/s as well for me. The reason is probably I outgrew the characters and ideals these shows try to convey. I still sympathize with the characters, but at the same time can't help but feel that I could've handled things more reasonably given the same conditions.

5cm/s got a huge emotional reaction out of me when I first watched it near the end of middle school, when I used to idolize that kind of romance. But when I had to watch the movie again for a class a few years later, I just couldn't feel the same way about it anymore. I'd been through quite a lot in real life during that time, and as a result constantly found myself nitpicking at the things the protagonists did(n't) do.

I binged through Shigatsu in two or three days - it was one of those anime I couldn't put down until the very end. It was also one of those anime that had a simple plot (it was pretty obvious since ep 1 what was going to happen), and therefore must rely on characterization and atmosphere to make it great. And honestly, if it weren't for the music, neither would've been executed very well.

Another complaint I have for these type of shows in general is that often times they sort of force the emotions onto you. Like 'here take this 1 minute sparkly staring contest' 'take this emotional piece of music with lots of atmospheric still frames' 'take this long moment of silence while characters look brooding'...okay yes I get what you are saying, I'm not apathetic. I am also totally okay with them, except when they are done four or five times per episode, which happens quite often.
>> ARTICLE
>had to watch the movie again for a class a few years later

Wait what

Which class?

It was a Japanese culture class. We had a section on Japanese media/pop culture.
>> ARTICLE
I find it very interesting that you feel that way about 5 cm/s, since basically the opposite happened to me. Back when I first watched it as a high schooler I couldn't help but find the main character's growing distance melodramatic and found a lot of protagonist's actions (or rather, inaction) dumb.

Then when I rewatched it as an adult, I could better appreciate the nuance of the story's romance as well as sympathize much better with the feelings of going through a slow but steady separation and the MC's quiet acceptance of it.

So I could say that I grew into the story rather than outgrowing it.
>> ARTICLE
I think culture also has something to do with it. I grew up in a very Asian household, so a lot of stuff in the movie I resonated with early  on. But at some point I probably got tired of all that and wanted to change.
>> ARTICLE
The Gundam Franchise in general outside of a few entries. I can see why people like it I guess, relatively expansive settings, war drama, action, mecha designs etc.

 Personally outside of maybe Char and Amuro I've never really found a single character in the entire franchise to be all that well developed or enjoyable and the pacing can be extremely shoddy at times. The Universal Century alone is a bit of a narrative mess with awful stuff like Unicorn existing for example. And honestly...The Gundam designs really just don't do anything for me.

Fate/Zero, Psycho Pass, FLCL. Fate/Zero was a great prequel to the Fate series, but something....felt lacking. I don't really know what, though I've only read the LN, and yet to watch the anime. Psycho Pass was also another great anime, and I can see why it's so  popular, but like Fate/Zero, it kinda felt like that it lacked something important. Sorry for being so vague here. And FLCL was just too absurd for me, I don't think I can ever watch it again, but it was really unique, and I don't think there'll be another anime like FLCL. 
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean about Fate/Zero and Psycho Pass. I'm one of the people who love both of them to death (especially Fate/Zero), but somehow I couldn't get attached to the characters. I didn't care at all when [Psycho Pass spoilers](/s "Kagari died"), for example. I was only interested to see what impact it would have on the plot and how that would morph the characters' ideologies.

This stands out especially in Fate/Zero because, having played the Fate/Stay Night VN beforehand, I noticed very early that I didn't care for any of the characters nearly as much as I cared for the ones in F/SN. I mean, they were all very memorable, and seeing them and their ideologies clash was fantastic, but none of their struggles and scenes come even close to hitting me the way some of the character moments in F/SN did.

I think endearing characters is an important aspect that's missing from a lot of Urobuchi's works, maybe.

Edit: Fixed some typos
>> ARTICLE
You nailed it perfectly right. Yeah, it was the characters. Having played the Fate/Stay Night VN, I kinda got used to Nasu's style and characters, and I guess the sudden change in writer threw me off. I mean, I liked Fate/Zero and its characters, but I prefer Fate/Stay Night's cast. I have the same opinion with Psycho Pass, I just couldn't get attached to them, I was just interested in the story, and what kind of actions the characters are going to take.

Welcome to the NHK is my most hated anime of all time. Literally the only good part about that show is the OP
>> ARTICLE
NHK was the hardest I've tried to watch an anime. Everyone is constantly saying "it's such a masterpiece" and meanwhile I had to force myself through the first 15 eps or so because IT WAS A FUCKING CRINGEFEST. I got the themes it was trying to set, but it was too annoying to properly enjoy them.

The final eps were amazing though, and it definitely paid off. Wouldn't ever watch it again anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the 1st episode and was like... "wtf is this" and stopped.

I did that exact same thing, came back to it a year later and gave it 9/10. The next few episodes were also not amazing, but eventually I got hooked into it and by then end I really really am glad I continued it

Noon.. It's my favourite anime lol :( 
People like it because it is such an accurate portrayal into the psyke of people with severe social anxiety and manic depression so it's relatable on a next level. There are small details in the show like satous and misakis quirks and trains of thought that are spot on. The story is kinda crap though ye
>> ARTICLE
I really wanted to like NHK. It had so much potential but was ultimately a let down. It was toted as a meditation on depression and a treatise on loneliness, but all I got was a stupid overview of Otaku culture, suicide pacts, and pyramid schemes. I especially disliked its treatment of suicide. In reality suicide is just the last link in a long chain of sad events, not the melodramatic bullshit presented in the anime
>> ARTICLE
Shame how you only get a stupid overview of otaku culture tbh. :/ the point are blatantly there with the manic episodes, train of thoughts leading to tremors, superiority complex, etc.

About suicide. You are right about suicide, it is more of a sad chain leading to spure of the moment thing rather than a planned melodramatic event. NHK didn't really touch on this deeply tbh with Satou, and i say this because, satou's character himself was never inherently suicidal, just manic exaggerated. the ending was basically revealing that hikkikomori lifestyle is intrinsically comfortable and propogates his social anxiety, depression and loneliness. When he is pushed to the edge of his finances, his will to survive takes over and begins his true "rehab" when he gets a job. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I completely get that. Watamote is another one that comes to mind as a strong example. This reminds me of Hanako from Katawa Shoujo (a VERY common VN). She is generally the fan favorite character because of her severe social anxiety and people saying they relate to her is often the reason. I wonder if it doesn't have to do with the fact that the internet in general is a much easier way for people suffering from social anxiety to communicate and interact and this just being here means there are more people who can relate from their own personal experience?

Gintama's amazing due to years of doing its own thing. The only downside is that the humor is *deeply* invested into Japanese-style overreactions most of the time, so if you're not into that kind of thing it's probably best to just ignore it. The most hilarious parts of Gintama are the completely meta jokes that are forcibly dragged into the series and the amount of self-deprecation.

Cromartie and GTO are basically the golden standard of anime humor, but that might be some nostalgia speaking+it probably aged a little. Cromartie's Gintama-esque when it comes to the humor, but not nearly as bad. Usually.

Then there's the usual subreddit favorites like Hataraku, Nichibros+Jou, and Nozaki. Imo, they don't quite reach the level of GTO or Gintama, but they're still great for being generally well-crafted comedies. There's probably a few more that's slipping my mind, but that's basically all that anime has in terms of well done comedies. Japanese humor as a whole is mostly like Gintama, but terrible.

But honestly, just watch all the Monty Python sketches/movies and read the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series then wonder why nothing in the world can satisfy your funny bone anymore outside of cheap laughs and jokes.

Jojo's - A friend of mine who's a big Jojo's fan told me once that the fact that its doing all the Shonen tropes IS the joke itself, and that its making fun of it all. For me, it was just being that stupid run of the mill Shonen show with just a bit "crazy"-er characters, but still just a Shonen. I feel One Punch Man nails the making fun of Shonen things way better, though even in that one there were a few dry moments (Carnage Kabuto ep was rather dull). Funnily, the friend I mentioned also loves OPM and she gladly rewatched all the episodes with me. I guess I just have a really high ceiling when it comes to Shonen after having been made to sit through all of bleach and most of naruto (fuck my cousin).

SAO - I get that for most people its popcorn brainless entertainment, or they just wanna get it on with the main dude/redhaired boobs/snipergirl. The show insulted my intellect when it asked me to buy the story that such a gaming system would be allowed to be sold on the market without extreme safety precautions.

Kill La Kill - Actually, I don't really get this one. I guess its in a way like TTGL except with more boobs. I came to this show from hearing that its made by trigger, and I was expecting little witch academia levels of awesome, instead I got a bogstandard Shonen with dragonball z like standoff talks, animation that cut corners EVERYWHERE and thought that writing peoples names in screen wide letters is ENERGY or something, and a premise and plot so dumb you'd think its a parody, except its taking itself too serious. Also all the creepy overtones. Gah the creepies. I guess people who like Shonen stuff or this kind of humor digged the energy of it all?
>> ARTICLE
Regarding SAO, yeah the idea is a bit out there, but consider just how incompetent law makers are when it comes to technology.
>> ARTICLE
My issue is that literally no authority reacts at all (at least we're not shown that, cause that would be 'boring'), instead its all from the protags perspective, who to my knowledge saves the situation and gets whoever was behind the games lockdown, and even gets hired by some game company later on? Its an outright power fantasy, and nothing wrong with it, but everything surrounding the plot of the protag winning just falls apart or gets shoved to the side. I can buy that someone slipped a fault past QA but not that the only person who can save us is protag. If anything even remotely similar would happen that would endanger an MMO player population would happen, I'd bet there would be a massive outcry and institutions working on figuring out how to disconnect players or finding the hacker/attacker.

That's the thing, a plot about finding the hacker in RL while some dude keeps him busy in the game, that would be a fun story to me. But the whole things about protag being awesome at the game and his fangril harem.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, the populist opinion around here that disregards all the times Kirito fails and the times he's saved after failing by someone else's actions. An outright power fantasy doesn't usually involve letting all of one's friends die, losing not once but twice in fair 1v1 climatic duels (until the aforementioned actions happen), or breaking down crying in the despair and later fear. A little bit, sure, but it gets way too much flak that disregards how imperfect the protag is.

But yes, you have to suspend disbelief and accept that this came from someone who knew absolutely nothing about the logistics behind how software and the internet works.
>> ARTICLE
Sorry mate but I didn't pick this opinion up from around here. Making him cry a bit here and there doesn't change the fact that its a power fantasy. This isn't what I have an issue with though. As you said in your second part, this writer disregards so many things, you do wonder if he ever had a console/pc  and went onto the internet. He probably did but just gave no fucks when writing. So why should I give a fuck. And since I am not interested in protags journey, it just ain't a show for me.
>> ARTICLE
I am not shonen fan by any means and fan service annoys me but I really like KLK. Honestly there is a deeper meaning in the plot of KLK (there are some good threads discussing the metaphors between the up front plot and reality.). Also I found the characters to be solid (Mako's my favorite) and the over-the-topness of everything to be quite funny. In a lot of ways it is a satire of a lot of other anime.  This is coming from someone with a philosophy degree so perhaps I attribute meaning to things too much sometimes but I definitely think you missed some of depth. I definitely prefer KLK to TTGL.  
>> ARTICLE
Please share some of that depth to me because to me a lot of episodes boiled down to either really shallow parody of something or huge standoffs which get solved in a matter of a minute near the end of the episode (when it doesn't cliffhanger us). I only watched up to the dude that blinds himself and his second fight with Mako, but I've bothered people to tell me what happens later just in case I missed some greatness but I've heard nothing world turning, and am actually glad I missed out on some rape scene supposedly.

And yes I've heard about the theories that KLK is supposedly about female empowerment or somesuch, and I don't buy it, the show is not and all that sounds like a lot of excuses to me just to watch the show guilt free.
>> ARTICLE
That's the problem with decent allegory, some people are bound to miss it entirely.
>> ARTICLE
So basically your understanding of why people like SAO is an insult to people who like SAO.  
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou. I'm on episode 15 and i see why people like it unlike myself  
well unless theres a good but coming up
>> ARTICLE
Love Live, I watched it twice because I watching it on my own and then a rewatch on Desudaily happened when I was almost done with season 1. I liked it, but I don't get how people love it or how it gave meaning to people lives, so I went to a Love Live panel and tried rewatching it again because of a r/awwime rewatch. I either don't get it or I'm in denial about loving it, but I think I just like AKB0048 and Idolmaster more. 
>> ARTICLE
i didn't like hellsing ultimate, maybe it's because i watched alot of horror/gore prior to watching hellsing ultimate but the characters just didn't really interest me. I only really liked alucard and police girl and that's about it :/
>> ARTICLE
I can understand how people can be in love with Mushishi, TTGL and Serial Experiments Lain.

I *don't* understand how anyone could like Angel's Egg.
>> ARTICLE
Gurren Lagann. I'm pretty sure I slept through most of it. And after reading many spoiler tags I've been meaning to attempt to rewatch it.

Humanity has declined. Currently half way through and I love the art style and Watashi. But literally everything is either really stupid to me or is really clever but going over my head.

Aldnoah Zero

Is Aldnoah Zero being loved much ?
>> ARTICLE
Akame ga Kill.

Ok, don't kill me. To be frank, it started nice with it's premise and all... It promised to be brutal, the character designs were nice, good music... But...
Then, gradually, I could just see the gore wither away (Before you ask, I'm not some gore lover), and everything just began to feel rushed. Earlier in the series, when a character died, you felt some sorrow, but when they began to kill one or two off every episode, the impact vanished completely. After a while, it just became some silly guessing game.
And what began as promising characters just fell into stereotype roles: The big sister, the pervert, the uninteresting protagonist, the homosexual muscular guy... Seen them before countless times.

But get off my K-ON.
>> ARTICLE
Death Note: i understand why people like it: smart story, smart characters doing complicated plans and trying to outsmart each other,with a very solid art style and direction

i'm firmly convinced it's one of the dumbest and most manipulative shows every written
>> ARTICLE
>i'm firmly convinced it's one of the dumbest and most manipulative shows every written

Could you please elaborate on that? Sounds a bit odd, since you also wrote
>smart story




>> ARTICLE
what i'm saying is that the story wants to be very smart and intricated, but it just cames out as needlessly complicated and extremly stupid: the author isn't as smart as the characters he's trying to write

all the plans and counterplans they use are way too elaborated and complex to the point of being ridicolous, it's the kind of "i've already calculated your next 10 moves" bullshit that sounds very smart and complicated but makes no sense if you break it down and analyze it

i don't remember enough to make specific examples but pretty much everything light does has the only effect of screwing him over and making it easier for the L to reach him and most of what L does is 30% logic and 70% asspulls or just straight up prescience

Near is just 100% asspulls
>> ARTICLE
just began watching it last night and it was kind of *eerie* how sharp L and just about everyone who's obviously going to play a key role in uncovering Kira's identity was when it came to the things that were happening. at first it was impressive, but it didn't take long for the awe to wear out and for the 'wtf how did he/she can even tell?!' to settle in.
>> ARTICLE
Naruto.  The characters and how the story is so engripping to people I can get and understand, even if it's not my cup of tea.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka - Was waay to hyped when I got into it and hated the character designs...

Toradora - Watched this a bit to late into my anime watching experience since everything was so predictable and boring

FMAB - I preferred the original 2003 adaptation more (though the ending was bad compared to Brotherhood) but I can see why people like Brotherhood a lot. 

Serial Experiments Lain - Didn't get the mind fuck I was expecting and was too boring/slow 

Cowboy Bebop - Too boring for me and I'm not too big of a fan of the Sci-fi genre

Ping Pong the Animation - Couldn't get into it but it had an amazing story

Katanagatari - Couldn't get into it 

Hellsing Ultimate - Couldn't get into it but god is the English Dub of Father Anderson and Alucard amazing
>> ARTICLE
> FMAB

I cant bring myself to finish FMA 2003. It feels so bland after it goes off on it's own. It doesn't feel like the same show anymore. Everything feels like magic.

Sad to see that you can't get into some of these shows. They are really good. Are you new to anime, that is my only guess?
>> ARTICLE
I liked the original more because of the darker tone and atmosphere; also with how most of the characters are handled.

Nah, I've been watching anime for a long time now. I just seem to have unpopular opinions which is why I rarely comment about my opinions on certain series anymore (it's also slightly because I'm always late). 

I can see why people like them so much since I do admit they are good shows but I just don't like them as much as other people do which is why I posted it in this thread. 

It normally boils down to me not being able to be 'get into' the world I guess is the best way to put it. Since if I can't get into it how am I meant to care about what happens to anything. 
>> ARTICLE
> Toradora - Watched this a bit to late into my anime watching experience since everything was so predictable and boring  

I didn't enjoy it at all, was painful to watch.  same goes for Clannad, Oreimo.  
>> ARTICLE
> Katanagatari

Ok, the other ones I guess I can get, but this one... literally one of the best anime I've ever seen. Curious why you couldn't get into it? I guess the art style is a bit unique and perhaps off putting but the story is SO epic. 
>> ARTICLE
For me it was slightly because of the art style but I grew to appreciate it eventually but it took a bit too long. 

But the main reason I couldn't fully get into it was because I just dislike some of the characters which ruined the experience for me. Especially when of the characters I disliked was one of the main characters, Togame. 
>> ARTICLE
Nisio is famous for his character banter.

Katanagatari had *obscene amounts* of it. You're forgetting that most of the fights in the series were primarily characters talking to each other than actually doing. This is a huge turn off for many people.

Then there's Togame and Shichika. The progression to begin even remotely liking the characters *is a very long and huge burn*. You don't particularly like them until 3-4 episodes in, and that's already 2.5+ hours.
>> ARTICLE
Could be amount of talking and I love Katanagatari personally.
>> ARTICLE
One punch man
>> ARTICLE
Durarara! and Baccano! 

I just... can't get into them. The art style is pretty okay and I do see the appeal based on quirky characters, but the way the stories are told presented feels too casual for me even in the plots' serious moments, and I find them to be kind of yawn-inducing. 
>> ARTICLE
The way Baccano!'s story it's told feels CASUAL in what way ?


>> ARTICLE
Gintama. I can see a really funny show in there, but Shinpachi kills it for me. Tsukkomi is the laugh track of anime, and it makes me grind my teeth.

OPM. It's okay but people are treating it like the second coming of jesus.

Shounen Anime in general. Everything about this genre got very old very fast. But if you are a little boy, or just a casual I can see why you still like Shounen Anime.
>> ARTICLE
1. Bakemonogatari : for the constantly shifting art and the perfect banter between all the characters. Also Ren'ai Circulation.
2. Kara no Kyoukai : for the mystery, music and fluid animation.
3. Nichijou : I've never laughed so hard at any other anime before.
4. Stein;s Gate : For making me love the characters and fantastic voice acting. Okabe espescially.
5. FMA: Brotherhood : 50 episodes of pure plot, how often do you see that?
6. Madoka : Because I didn't expect it.
7. Lucky Star! : I'm not sure why I love this one so much but i've watched it 3 times now. I regret nothing.
8. Angel Beats! : ROCKET CHAIRS
9. Gundam Seed : Despite a terribly low budget and reusing explosions, everytime I watch it I get pulled into Kira/Athrun's story.
10. Darker than Black : for the chinese electric batman and because I have no idea what's going on.

Gurren Lagann was amazing, don't get me wrong. And before I watched 5-8, Gurren Lagann was up there. But it's all about over-the-top-ness and overcoming odds. And, while I love that, I love Ryohgo Narita that much more. Plus there's not Izaya and Shizuo in Gurren Lagann.

I have the Stand Alone Complex box set, it's a good series but honestly it just didn't captivate me the way the others on my top 10 list did.

>> ARTICLE
Saw this a while back on reddit.. somewhat relevant... NSFW http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdY7NMWhLc&feature=related

It's because it's so simple, yet so complex. At first glance, all the characters seem to be pure archetypes; boring, one-dimensional, cliche. Once you get inside their heads, though, they become incredibly interesting. It's a character-driven action series, which is extremely rare in a world where 99% of action movies/shows are purely event-driven.
>> ARTICLE
Because it's epic as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
I can respect that
>> ARTICLE
Well, to be honest, I'm a fan of the manga more than the anime but that's mainly because the manga has much more content.
>> ARTICLE
I don't love Berserk that much. /sarcasm
>> ARTICLE
Brilliant story, pure and simple. Never seen anything like it.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's mainly because it's a well written story with characters that just bursts in colours in terms of personality.  Also there's not much westernized Fantasy that's as well realized as the Berserk backstory in Japanese anime/manga history (IMHO and AFAIK anyways), so fans of the genre really digs it.
>> ARTICLE
In addition it is one of the few animes that while not being better than it's manga counter part can certainly stand toe to toe on it's own.

The show failed to live up the its amazing concept, but it was entertaining nonetheless. I can't wait for Blood C, or whatever they're calling it.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was a decent show, I definitely enjoyed it at the time, I just didn't feel it really impacted me. Fun little adventure, and Saya was a worthy protagonist. 
>> ARTICLE
Blood + is certainly top 10 for me, I was a late adopter and that is the show that brought me, full force, in to watching anime regularly.
>> ARTICLE
BLOOD-C has been out and actually last episode just aired.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first ep and put it on hold. I hope its awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Well personally I thought it was not as terrible as Blood+. At least it was only 12 episodes of worthlessness vs 50.
>> ARTICLE
1. Outlaw Star
2. Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya
3. Chrono Crusade
4. Mobile Suit Gundam Wing
5. K-On
6 CGa-Rei Zero
7. Clannad
8. Evangelion
9. Tenchi Muyo!
10. Gunslinger Girl

Outlaw Star was the anime that hooked me. M.o.H.S is just brilliantly done. Chrono Crusade has always been one of my favorites because of the darkness/comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really care too much for anime till i watched Outlaw Star also. Though I'm not sure what a top 10 would be for me, I will have to think hard on this.

1. Full Metal Alchemist

9. Gankutsuou
10. Berserk

Brotherhood or vanilla?
>> ARTICLE
Both ^___^


Vanilla for the mood

Brotherhood for the plot (i found vanilla plot a bit confusing toward the end)


Both had great music, great characters, great fight scenes, and great animation. Whole thing's great

finally someone mentions berserk!

I listed whatever has rewatch value for me. For nostalgia I wanted to include Sailormoon, but I really didn't like the prolonged monster of the week approach.

Thanks for asking us to list out our Top 10. I've been feeling lost lately as to what to watch and after seeing everyone's lists I think Stein;s Gate should be enjoyable.

Usagi Drop would be a great anime to get your girlfriend interested. It's basically a slice of life about a guy who takes in his 6 year old aunt and learns to raise a child by himself. Its an awesome, non-ecchi, and captivating story.

10's not really enough, There are a couple of other genre's I could pull from, and list isn't really by order of like the most, I could probably just as easily expand this list to 20 or so that fit different moods.

edit: Juuni Kokuki not Kokkori, my own stupid misspelling of it =)
>> ARTICLE
> 1. Seikai no Senkai Series

Thank you.  Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one out there who loves that series.

>> ARTICLE
Have a upvote for katanagatari and Juuni Kokuki.

I don't know why or when, but for some reason the title got stuck in my head as kokkori, I always go back and correct it, or do it midway through, but it never seems to stick ._.

upvote for digimon

which season? or all of them?
>> ARTICLE
The first three were good, in my opinion. It went down hill when they started to become Digimon themselves. That's when I stopped.
>> ARTICLE
>when they started to become Digimon themselves.

Wait, what? As someone who grew up on season one, and watched a bit of season two, this...I don't even know what to think of this. I guess not watching further was for the best.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I grew up with 1 also. I watched to 3 because of new characters and a new plot/element. Then 4 started.  [If you're curious, here's episode 1.](http://www.youtube.com/user/dreedman16x2#p/c/6618191C3A75A55F/0/vpSIQXldheI) I did enjoy the main theme though. I'll give it that much.

8. Hellsing

And.....that's all I've seen. Sad right? I'd love some recommendations.
>> ARTICLE
Check out Full Metal Alchemist: **Brotherhood**, Hajime no Ippo, Hunter X Hunter, Trigun and Gungrave. 

If you're interested in something really awesome and epic One Piece might be up your alley, it's one of those anime that you either love or hate. If you like it you will have lots of entertainment ahead of you. :)

>> ARTICLE
I've heard many good things about One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
It's amazing.
>> ARTICLE

Full Metal Alchemist - (Watch FMA: Brotherhood)

Dragon Ball  & Dragon Ball Z - (Watch Soul Eater, Berserk, Fairy Tail, Claymore, S-cry-ed, Darker Than Black)

Negima! (I haven't watched this. Looks similar to Clannad, Clannad After Story, Ouran High School Host Club, Cromartie High School. First two are slice of life, second two are comedies)

Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple (See recs for DBZ. Also HunterxHunter, Law of Ueki)

Cowboy Bebop (Samurai Champloo, Baccano!)

Please Teacher (Haven't seen this. Birdy the Mighty: Decode, maybe?)

Hellsing (Trinity Blood, Blood+)

EDIT: General recs: Madoka, Kino's Journey, Serial Experiments Lain

Look everything up on Myanimelist.net
>> ARTICLE
the first season of Birdy is good, the second not so much

>> ARTICLE
I did not enjoy Trinity Blood, at all. In fact I almost slept through many episodes. I can vouch for Blood+ though!
>> ARTICLE
These threads are a great way to get into new anime. Look for someone who shares some of your top ten choices, and check out the other series on their list.

Also, if you liked Cowboy Bebop, you'll love Black Lagoon.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! I'll make a list :)
>> ARTICLE
Good thread to go through the entire thread, grab everyone top 1 or 3, put it in a list, watch 2-3 episodes of said series, and if you like it, keep going, if not, move to the next one on the list - someone in here will have taste similar to yours =p. Probably.

Not a bad idea, thanks.

This is just out of the top of my head, so I may regret not mentioning some Anime. I will try to name at least one from each genre/type, and in some cases, what other animus of the same type I liked. I don't think it would be fair to name 10 Anime series of different genres, because it would be very hard to compare them.

Seinen: Berserk

Sci-fi: Crest of the Stars (runner up: Ghost in the Shell, Darker than Black)

Comedy: Arakawa Under the Bridge (runners up: Ranma 1/2, Golden Boy, Green Green, GTO, Detroit Metal City)

Drama: Nana (runners up: Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien, Honey and Clover) - Nana wins because  [it had anal sex](/spoiler) ;) (I'm kidding of course, not about the [sex](/spoiler) though)

Fantasy: Twelve Kingdoms (runners up: Wolf's Rain, Katanagatari, Bakemonogatari, Last Exile and Bounen no Xamdo)

Romance: Rurouni Kenshin Tsuioku Hen (runners up: Ouran Host Club and Crest of the Stars [once again]) - although there is a lot of action on this one, it tells one of the most beautiful and bittersweet love stories I have ever seen on an animated series. It moved me more than any of the other ones mentioned, that's why it's my favorite.

Shounen: Hunter X Hunter (runners up: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Naruto [the first seasons up until the end of the main first arc], Bleach [first two seasons], Katekyou Hitman Reborn, Rurouni Kenshin Anime and last but certainly not least, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann)

Sports: Hajime no Ippo! (runners up: Cross Game, Initial D [not really a sport, I know, but I will enjoyed it greatly. Don't recommend it to everyone though])

Music: Beck (runner up: K-ON)
>> ARTICLE
wow, nicely done with the compilation and FINALLY Wolf's Rain shows up in someone else list! 
>> ARTICLE
1. One Piece
2. Black Lagoon
3. Baccano! (Best dub I have ever heard, by a wide margin)
4. Fullmetal Alchemist (original)
5. Neon Genesis Evangelion
6. Samurai Champloo
7. Spice and Wolf
8. Dragonball
9. DBZ (Probably wouldn't like it that much now, but my god, the memories)
10. Cowboy Bebop (Really need to watch this again. I bet it would be higher on my list if I did. I know I like Samurai Champloo more than it though, which puts me in a small minority.)

Honorable mention to 08th MS Team, which I really need to see in Japanese, because I tried to watch it again and realized that the English voices were godawful. Also, if the Adult Swim Shin Chan dub counts as an anime, then it's near the top.

So, skimming over, it seems like the subreddit is fairly action-oriented?
>> ARTICLE
I think if you take a random sample then in general shounen /action anime is always going to be the most popular - it has general themes most of us will enjoy or tolerate, and is set to appeal to the widest audiences. Same reasons Naruto/Bleach/One Piece last so long with such large audiences. =)

2. Lost Universe (guess what, it's a parallel universe to Slayers)
3. Saber Marionette J
4. Chrno/Chrono (whatever) Crusade
5. Ah! My Goddess
6. Eve no Jikan (6 eps long, you'll wish it were longer)
7. Noein (parallel universes and time travel, enjoy)
8. Haibane Renmei (what happens when you die?  let's find out!  By the creator of Lain!)
9. Serial Experiments Lain (prepare liberal amounts of mind lube)
10. DNA^2 (and if you can remember this series, you're definitely an anime kid of the 90s, bonus points if you downloaded and read the translated manga back then too)

And others that come to mind that I enjoyed: Record of Lodoss War (OVA),  Revolutionary Girl Utena, Martian Successor Nadesico, Neon Genesis Evangelion (to a point...ep 25&26 sucked ass), MS Gundam: 08th MS Team, Video Girl Ai (doh, DNA^2 and I don't even mention this one?).  I could go on - I haven't even mentioned some of the newer series I've been watching recently - Madoka is definitely one to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Hey! Another person who saw 08th MS Team!
>> ARTICLE
08th MS Team is my favorite of the entire franchise - it felt more realistic than the other Gundam series and it didn't take 52 or whatever episodes to tell the story.

Yup, same here. It was really the only Gundam that I liked a lot. It was also significantly more mature than the other Gundams.

I always feel out of place looking at lists like this. I get the feeling a list of shows I didn't like would get more approval than what I did like given I was not a fan of Evangelion, TTGL, Code Geass, Haruhi, Welcome to the NHK or Ergo Proxy. Well, here goes nothing:

I think my list does bias towards older work (or work I've seen longer ago) as its impact feels greater and more permanent. We'll see in a few years how sustained feelings are toward newer shows.

Edit: I'm sorry if I missed something, but why the downvotes? I thought r/anime was a polite subreddit where you can express opinions without (too much) hate. They asked for top 10, I gave top ten. Sorry if you don't agree with my choices.
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully y'all don't expect me to choose only 10. At best I was once able to get it down to 20 by only choosing stuff I would be excited to rewatch and then tossing items that were "too related." I couldn't come up with an order for them then and that's even worse now.

(To make matters worse, I added FMA:B bringing it up to 21 and The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is making me consider putting a 22nd on there.)

TTGL and CLannad are automatic well known best hits. Beck will alwayse have a special place in my  heart. i learned how to paly guitar during the english running of beck on Much Music. every week i'd watch and see both me and koyuki get progressively better and practicing till our fingers bled.  and it climaxed with the greatful sound concert...no other anime concert has given me that same feeling (Angel Beats! was close, the my song section was amazing, it didn't make the list because i felt it should have been longer, the small episode count didn't do the show justice)

Just gonna put it out there. I don't agree with this style of review at all. Mainly with finishing it with things like 

>Whats on your list?  I rate this anime an 8.8. This means that this show should come before most shows unless they are top 30 on myanimelist.net. 

and 

>tl;dr  This anime has a HIGH priority. Stop what youre watching and watch this first, with a personal; rating of 8.8.

It just seems unecessary and actually detracts from the review itself.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the feedback. Is there any recommendations that I could use to make it a more enjoyable read?
>> ARTICLE
Well I get what you are trying to do with these sorts of things, but maybe be a bit less overt with it if that makes sense? To me just saying it has a high priority is fine and works well enough within the context of your review, rather than saying that you should drop everything and watch it right now. Again that's just me though. Besides that everything else about the review was fine and it was a good read.
>> ARTICLE
Really appreciate it! I'll try my best in the next review
>> ARTICLE
>This was the first anime that Ive seen that had a plot of this kind: parenting.

If you haven't seen [Wolf Children](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12355/Ookami_Kodomo_no_Ame_to_Yuki), you should really fix that right away. [PapaKiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11179/Papa_no_Iukoto_wo_Kikinasai!) is another good one, though the emotional stuff kind of takes a back seat to the comedy/SoL aspects.

Anyway, good review. I like the idea of addressing the priority of watching it (however, you should probably finish what you're watching before you start Usagi Drop).
>> ARTICLE
> PapaKiki

Ehhhh, it was crazy disappointing.
>> ARTICLE
Putting these on my list. Thanks for those! 
Ha ha yeah, saying to drop whatever anime to start Usagi Drop does seem a bit drastic 
>> ARTICLE
I won't say DON'T read the manga, but don't expect heartwarming all the way through...
>> ARTICLE
Nice job on your review.  However, is it that necessary?  There's already a WT! on Usagi Drop after all.
>> ARTICLE
It's not necessary per se. I'm more going at it in a different way that I thought would be interesting. Instead of giving an anime recommendation sort of review, I go off the basis that you're already planning to watch it. Again it's not really necessary, it's something that I kinda did for fun. 
>> ARTICLE
> I'm more going at it in a different way that I thought would be interesting.

To be honest the way you frame your posts aren't much different, if at all from WTs and reviews.

> I go off the basis that you're already planning to watch it. 

If they're already planning to watch it, they probably already have a good idea of what anime they want to watch first.  Also, if they already want to watch an anime, wouldn't they usually already know the pros of the anime going into it?

> Again it's not really necessary, it's something that I kinda did for fun. 

Ah, I see.  
>> ARTICLE
Nothing wrong with having more than one review of a show. I think most people prefer to have multiple perspectives when deciding whether or not to watch something.
>> ARTICLE
You say multiple perspectives, but both focus on the same pros on Usagi Drop.
>> ARTICLE
I made a post similar a week or so ago so I'll just repost here:

Ok since everyone seems to more or less dislike the ending of the manga (at least more so than the anime), I'll pitch in as someone who actually liked the ending of the manga more.

Yes the anime/first half of the manga was a lot more slice of life-y with struggles of learning to become a parent. I totally agree that it is a different beast than what comes after the time skip/second half of the manga, however I kind of like the much more serious tone that the second half provided.

If your the type of person that liked usagi drop because it was carefree and "fluffy" (for lack of a better term), then your probably better off not reading the manga. However, if you liked usagi drop because it asked some really interesting moral questions about family, then yeah you probably want to read the manga.

I personally was really drawn to the premise because it was a big moral dilemma. It was interesting watching the interactions that came from it. During the second half of the manga, it raises even more critical questions about life and morals and family that I was personally drawn too. And henceforth really liked the ending.

However, I would definitely recommend you to be a mature person to read the ending. I'm not going to try and put an age recommendation on the series because I know age doesn't always correspond to maturity level, but you have to embrace the ending with an open mind if you want to enjoy it. Understand that it's asking questions that don't really have a right answer, and it's ok to disagree with the answer that it choose, just don't ridicule the series for choosing it.
>> ARTICLE
See I watched it when it aired, and I'm the type that loved it cause it was carefree and fluffy (which I think is the perfect term for it). Then I find out it has a manga, and I'm like, "Great! More fluffiness for me to enjoy" and you know how that turned out. For me the struggles were just the base for more heartwarming fluffy cuddly goodness, and I'm sure for a lot of people that's what it was too. That's why when you go into the manga expecting (and that's really the key word here, expectation) more fluffiness and you get the actual ending it puts a lot of people off. It shatters the image that people had of Usagi Drop, or in less eloquent words, "ruins" the series.

Can I appreciate the mangaka's intent and what the story became? Sure, it's a nice change of pace and gives people something to think about. But it's not what I expected, in fact it's pretty much the exact opposite of what I expected, and I'd have been much happier if I was in the dark still. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I mean I totally understand where the negative opinions are coming from (although thank you for qualifying it rather than just saying that it sucked), I just disagree with those opinions lol.

I mean I actually like deep serious thinking shows that make you ponder life questions, that's just something interesting to me (granted I like the fluffy stuff too) and when this series used the heartwarming goodness to launch itself into deep moral questioning, I thought that it was brilliant.

The only thing I'm shocked at is how many people disliked it vs liked it. I thought it would be like 50-50 instead of 95-5 lol.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah and that's the expectation thing coming into play again. From what you've said, it sounds like the life questions held your main interest from the beginning, but for the majority of people (like me) it was the fluffiness that was the spotlight. So then you go into the manga, and if the fluffiness was the spotlight you'd end up disappointed, whereas if the moral questions were the spotlight you'd just fall even more in love with it.

I think the reason the split is like 95-5 is because most people weren't really expecting anything more than a fluffy show.

By the way, I read this like 6-8 years ago but there is this manga called Bitter Virgin that you'd probably love. It's also a good example of clear intentions in that you don't really go into the manga expecting anything other than life questions. I'll be honest I don't really remember what the manga was about and I read it when I was still in middle school so it might've been a case of "2deep4me" but you should check it out.
>> ARTICLE
Good post. I didn't really have any context within the story as to why they would do that, but if it is done well and logically then I can accept it. I'll check it out.

I forgot to put this in the actual post, but if I were to read the manga would I want to read the first half even though I have watched the anime? Or have I not missed anything?
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I read the manga awhile ago and saw the anime even further back (watched it as it aired a couple years back). 

As far as I remember however, it's the same. The manga has more little scenes that don't attribute to anything really but since you seem to liked those small scenes, maybe read the first half. I don't remember how much they took out for the anime though, I think the anime literally encompassed like 80-90% of the first half.

But yeah to elaborate a bit on my last post (I didn't say all that I wanted to say the first time I posted because I didn't want to spoil anything), I definitely think the context is there. I mean some people thought that it was getting thrown out of left park but I personally don't think so.

[After the time jump] (/s "Rin becomes a high school girl and you really see her emotions reflect that.") When she was a kid, she acted as a kid, innocent and unknowning to many parts of the world and emotions. [After the jump however] (/s "she starts to become more interested in love and starts to question it (as we see with all series that center on a girl in high school). She questions her own emotions and feelings (doesn't help that Kouki loves Rin and is trying to urge her to get with him) and eventually arrives at the conclusion that she honestly wants to be with Daikichi. A lot of people get mad at the end when Rin says that she wants to have a kid with Daikichi, whereas I completely understood it. Rin fell in love with Daikichi essentially because of the warm and tenderness that he showed her as a kid, and she wanted to be on the giving end instead of the receiving end towards the later years in her life (and of course she wanted to do it with the man that she loved).")

So yeah, lot's of life/family/moral questions being raised. I personally liked it. It's honestly thought provoking, like what would have happened if you were in her position? What would you have done? But I like thinking about those kind of questions with subjective answers lol, so to each his/her own I say.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm. I've skipped the spoiler tags you put up, but you've really intrigued me. I'll give it a look.

If it scars me too much maybe I'll go back and read the first half as mental bleach :P

And your whole point about big life questions, and philosophical questions is what made me want to watch the anime in the first place. The big doofy grin I had on my face through 90% of it though is what I ended up with, with some really genius underlying writing/plotpoints. It always irked me how [Rin's mother really becomes a non-issue. Everytime she was brought up and especially when Daikichi meets her I kept wondernig "How the hell is he going to deal with her and resolve this?!?! How do you make this a happy ending??? Will she screw things up? Will it mess up Rin and Daikichi's relationship? Does Rin need a mother? She seems to when she interacts with Daikichi's cousin and Kouki's mom (or at least it helps)" And then it gets resolved with no problem. Same thing with Daikichi adopting Rin. It gets brought up then forgotten about. That confused me a bit. Plus how does he take her to the doctor's if he's not her legal guardian? Or maybe he is and just isn't her father] (/spoiler)

Yeah you might like the manga in that case. I mean honestly I think the main reason why the anime didn't touch on a lot of the subjects you spoiler'd was because the anime wanted itself to stay carefree.

Oh and I didn't spoil too much in the tags. They more or less elaborated on what other people said in the thread (and some people put stuff without even the spoiler tags...). But yeah they still are spoilers though lol.
>> ARTICLE
I think alot of people that hated it probably haven't read the whole manga, just heard what happened or they skipped to the last chapter or something. Things don't rush in that way, it takes some development until it gets there. In the theme of the manga I think it makes sense. [Some spoilers](/s "In episode 5 or chapter 12, Daikichi asks Rin if she wants to take his name and adopt her. She refuses and tell him that her father is grandpa and that he should remain Daikichi. I think this is a foreshadow implying that she never saw him as her father." )
>> ARTICLE
Since everyone else has answered your question regarding the manga (ie don't fucking read it) I'll mention the bonus episodes. 


They're only a few minutes each and have no consequence to the plot overall. That being said, they are as charming and adorable as the main show. If you liked the little snippets before and after each episode, I'd watch them. If not, skip them. That being said, the 4 bonus episodes are only 20 minutes in total, so what have you got to lose really?
>> ARTICLE
Oh alright cool. I didn't realize that there were after snippets until the fourth episode or so, so when I went back and saw the "It's sweat!" one I nearly died laughing.

Where would I go to download them? I don't think they were on whatever site I got the anime from

>> ARTICLE
Here's why people say it ruined the series:

[Rin develops a romantic interest in Daikichi and successfully pursues a relationship with him. The manga ends with the two planning to get married, and Rin craving the Daikichi D.](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
Ugg. I know how it ends but I still want to read the manga lol....
>> ARTICLE
It's not even that that I hate. (Though I certainly didn't enjoy that part of it.) Most of my rage comes from how Daikichi completely lost all the good qualities he built up in the first half. He was a guy who kicked everyone's selfish bullshitting to the curb. He was completely unsuited to raising a child, but he did it anyway because it had to be done. It was all about finding the best things for Rin even if it was inconvenient or unpopular. 

Second half of the manga he becomes completely useless. He mopes about and feels sorry for himself and pushes away the people who trust him. All of the frustrating things that happen are because Daikichi didn't do the responsible thing when given the opportunity. It's the polar opposite of how he acted previously. I really hated him by the end of the manga.

>> ARTICLE
DONT DO IT. just trust me. the end of the manga takes a sweet, heartwarming anime and turns it into something perverse and dirty that i just had to sit there and go "REALLY?  YOU REALLY DID THIS FOR RATINGS?"

[Manga Spoiler](/s "It turned out that they are not blood related. So in a way, her falling in love with the person who took care of her wasn't illogical and there were no moral boundaries crossed once that came to light.")
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "I think the 2 couples (Yukari & Daikichi and Rin & Kouki) wouldn't work. Think about it, what if Daikichi wanted to marry Yukari, Kouki would've hated himself more than he already did. Being stuck in there with the person he loved as his step-sister. Also RinxKouki was bound to fail. And to be honest, I didn't even liked Kouki's character after the timeskip. I don't know why, he was so forcefull and unpatient sometimes.")

So practically in the end, she wanted to stay with Daikichi forever. Some people believed that the anime ending was great and that is how it should be left. If you think about it, Daikichi is old and Rin is a college girl. It wouldn't work. ")

>> ARTICLE
Thank you! I'll definitely check this out.

It is a little unfortunate that it is so hard to find anime with adult cast and adult situations. I've grown up with anime since I was 3, and I always enjoyed it. But now im near my mid 20's and I kinda feel like *anime* left me far behind. :(
>> ARTICLE
If you want a lighter slice of life with some non over the top comedy featuring adult characters then You might want to check out servant x service.  

If you want a more serious show with deeper plot, then like others have mentioned Psycho Pass might be worth checking out.  

Also Steins Gate is another fantastic anime that I highly recommend you watch.  It starts out rather slow for the first few episodes but don't let that phase you, it really opens up after that and becomes amazing.

###K-On Essay Cont.

Before addressing the shifting dynamics, Id like to first touch on the common dynamic of the group as a whole. I think the best way to examine this set dynamic and the shifting dynamics is through the filter of what importance the girls place on being responsible vs. doing whats fun. Some of the girls are much more responsible(like Mio, Azunyan, and usually Mugi), while others are always looking to skirt responsibility to have more fun(like Yui, Ritsu, and sometimes Mugi). This often causes [adorable disagreements]( http://i.imgur.com/GNDHyiu.gif) when it comes to deciding to practice their music. Azunyan, being responsible, pushes the group to practice more while [Ritsu and Yui are resistant to the idea]( http://i.imgur.com/PNJzhAM.gif) because [more fun can be had doing other things.]( http://i.imgur.com/51kZMPS.gif) Mio usually backs up Azunyan and Mugi usually ends up the tiebreaker. Mugi is a [refined young lady](http://i.imgur.com/kgAso1q.gif) who knows she should be responsible...*buuuuuuut* she also [really loves to have fun.](http://i.imgur.com/LB4RhV2.gifv) And with Mugi[even the most mundane of things are fun and exciting.]( http://i.imgur.com/VzWUCMP.gif) This is one of the reasons why shes my favorite character and my all-time best girl. [Isnt she wonderful?!]( http://i.imgur.com/8BPCUXr.gif)

But that doesnt explain how the character dynamics can shift. **The dynamics shift subtly based on which girls are interacting with each other when theyre all together, but these shifts are much more noticeable when the girls are not all together.** This happens often in the anime. I think Ritsu, [who is always looking to have fun,]( http://i.imgur.com/OmNp1SF.gif) is the best example for this. When Ritsu is with Yui and the more responsible girls arent trying to rein them in, [they have nothing but fun.]( http://i.imgur.com/Vm8CUcM.gif) When the two are alone together and forced to do something not fun, [they do it lazily.](http://i.imgur.com/yb3g9N0.gif) When Ritsu is with Mio, she will [often irritate]( http://i.imgur.com/sXbD1zQ.gif) or [torment Mio]( http://i.imgur.com/HhpgElT.gif) because its fun. Keep in mind that this teasing/tormenting is done in a loving way. Also, [Mio will often put a stop to Ritsus shenanigans.]( http://i.imgur.com/jlcCYpz.gif) When Ritsu is with Azunyan, shell often irritate Azunyan by [joining in with Yui]( http://i.imgur.com/sKWAfT5.gif) in [teasing her,]( http://i.imgur.com/aAONX32.gif) because its fun(which is also why Yui does this). Of course Yui and Ritsu only do this because they love Azunyan so much. When the group has decided to do something responsible, like help Yui study, [Ritsu causes problems,]( http://i.imgur.com/QNkTvJG.gifv) because she wants to have fun. **But what would happen if Ritsu was with Mugi, who knows how to be responsible but also loves fun and because of this sometimes skirts that responsibility?** 

The anime actually asks that question directly in one episode where Ritsu sees Mugi outside of school. Ritsu is out to have fun today(shocker) and Mio chose to turn down Ritsus invite to join her because Mio is being responsible by fulfilling other obligations(double shocker). So Ritsu decides to see if Mugi wants to join her on her fun day. As Ritsu approaches Mugi to ask her, she tries to sneak up on Mugi, [which ends up backfiring,]( http://i.imgur.com/pQcEF7G.gif) and then **we immediately get an answer to our question of would Mugi choose responsibility or fun when being influenced by Ritsu?** Mugi has something planned to do that day [but immediately cancels it]( http://i.imgur.com/7TKcjgu.gif) [TO HAVE THE BEST TIME EVER]( http://i.imgur.com/sdxOWfu.gif) [OMG EVERYTHING IS SO FUN AND EXCITING!]( http://i.imgur.com/wwOL6KJ.gif) Before they have their big day, Mugi mentions to Ritsu this is the first time its been just the two of us, right?. As I mentioned earlier, this is evidence that K-On is self-aware of the shows focus on shifting character dynamics.

Also its no surprise Mugi was able to turn the tables by surprising Ritsu. [Shes a master at surprising people.]( http://i.imgur.com/2nGCjdJ.gif)

This is just one filter applied to one girl. We can apply multiple filters to multiple girls and see the slightly different ways they behave based on who theyre with/what theyre doing. **We experience these shifting dynamics continuously throughout the anime and it keeps K-On fresh and interesting.** 

---

###**Great Characterization Helps the Viewer Get Attached to The Characters**

Characterization is something that is usually done adequately, sometimes done poorly, but rarely done exceptionally. K-On falls into the last of these categories because the show is painstakingly detailed with its characterization. **You get a great feel for who these characters are because their personalities shine through in their every action.** [This gif](http://i.imgur.com/UI9RKEF.gif) from the second OP is a great example of this attention to characterization. 

Mio, who's idolized by the school as the perfect lady(but ironically has a fan-club started for the opposite reason), has no problem executing a flawless jump-turn. Azunyan, as one of those girls who idolizes Mio, attempts to mirror Mios technique but messes up slightly since she's not the elegant lady that Mio is, despite her strong desire to be one like Mio. Yui, who's eternally genki and goofy, is waving her arms excitedly before the jump-turn. Ritsu, the constant prankster who fails to take anything seriously(often earning the ire of Mio), doesn't take this seriously and half-asses it. Mugi is easily excited by the most mundane of things and anything the girls do together. Here she's holding her arms up tensely with excitement when they're all supposed to have their arms down upon completing the turn.  

Such attention to characterization is consistent throughout the anime but is often subtle. **It circles back to the reason the viewer gets attached to the characters; because you know who they are and they feel like actual people.**

---

###**Oh YeahThere is Music in K-On!**

I must talk a bit about the music, seeing as it [is quite good.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM-2z_XWzdM) Like the show, the music is light, energetic, fluffy, girly, and happy. Similarly, the music in the show is kind of an afterthought in this post because its *not* the focus of the show nearly as much as it *is what brings the girls together.* Something interesting about these songs is that although they do sound good, they are simple songs. This results in it being conceivable that these girls could create these songs and it gives a realistic feel to their performances. **So yet again, you feel like youre watching real people do real things.** In addition to all the music the girls play in the anime, The OPs and EDs for K-On are also all good. The openings are all sung by Yuis VA and are [similar to the energetic fluffy music the girls play in the anime,]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpA_B5khZc) but the songs in the OPs and EDs are more advanced than what they play in the show. The EDs are all sung by Mios VA and have a darker, serious tone to them. This includes the greatest ED of all time, [Dont Say Lazy.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX-yENHkeMo) 

Like I mentioned earlier, almost all the songs other than the EDs are light, energetic, fluffy, girly, and happy. **Its yet another layer in K-Ons formula for making the viewer feel happy.** 

One of the most impressive things Ive learned about K-On is that the VAs for the girls [actually learned how to play the instruments of their characters.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYkx0TAIXWQ) Thats some serious commitment to their roles. **That commitment is yet another element of the craftsmanship in making K-On that contributes to the characters feeling like actual people.**

---

[**Lets Wrap This Up**](http://i.imgur.com/7rWiBJ1.gif)

**K-On is painstakingly crafted so these characters feel like real people to the viewer.** Because of this, the viewer feels like theyre watching real people enjoy the best days of their lives. You feel happy because these characters feel happy, and all the aspects of the anime that K-On puts effort into is so it can accomplish the goal of making the viewer feel happy. Theres not really anything meaningful in this SOL like there is in ones such as Barakamon or Usagi Drop, but that doesnt mean its not good. **Its good because how it makes you feel, and it will make you feel wonderful.**

But...that's not No Thank You!
>> ARTICLE
In any other anime, No Thank You would be the best ED. It is an amazing ED!

There is one aspect of Don't Say Lazy that puts it a notch above of No Thank You; the outfits. 

They're all amazing! These are the girls at their most elegant, and this elegance is of particular contrast with Yui and especially Ritsu, who are the opposite of elegance throughout almost the entire anime. 

And of course we can't not mention Mio's Tiny Hat, [which alone has perhaps spawned more cosplay and fanart than every other outfit in K-On.](https://www.google.com/search?q=K-on+mio+mini+hat&rlz=1C1FGGD_enUS498US498&espv=2&biw=1600&bih=775&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=2UryVNiiCYOXyAT7soGwBA&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#tbm=isch&q=K-on+mio+dont+say+lazy)

Of course you're certainly not *wrong* for preferring No Thank You. It's a fantastic ED and is definitely one of my favorites. 
>> ARTICLE
The outfits are pretty awesome, I do agree. Although I like the simplicity of the outfits in No Thank You, personally. Mio's hoodie looks awesome, and I like the different take on the other girls' school uniforms. But I do like how the ones in Don't Say Lazy look, too. I like that you used the word elegance, I wouldn't have thought of that but it's a good word to use.

Ever since I first watched K-On, I've been on a mission to spread word of it throughout the anime-related subreddits. It's my hope that this essay will convince others to give the anime a try and that they are able to enjoy K-On as I did.

EDIT: I suppose I should also thank my little cousin, who's not a redditor, but is a huge anime fan and a much better writer than I am.

Feels like the right attitude. I just hope that people who actually haven't watched K-On! would read the whole text... 
>> ARTICLE
I open to opinions if you think I should spoiler-tag anything. 
>> ARTICLE
No, not really, I disagree with some of your points (about K-On! characters feeling like real people, specifically), but I'm still kinda blown up by the dedication to the anime.

Though there is one certain anime that is something like that for me... 
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. I freely admit I am biased and having watched the anime 4 times now it's certain that I feel very differently about the characters than most do. 

While the characters do have many facets to their personalities, it's difficult to define where characters advance from a "collection of many character traits" into the area of "feeling like actual people".

A lot of it has to do with our perspectives too. Much of how we determine if a character "feels like an actual person" depends on what types of people we've encountered in our lives. I've certainly never met a violent tsundere person like Louise for The Familiar of Zero, but I have met tomboys like Ritsu who don't care about how they dress and don't take things too seriously. Granted in the anime, this sloppy dressing is a means of characterizing that carefree trait of Ritsu's. 

I think one point we can agree on is that K-On sacrifices realism for moe. Many actions and reactions in the series are cute-fied to serve the primary directive of making the viewer feel happy. This certainly has the effect of making the girls feel less like actual people. I believe when one looks beneath the moe, we can see what feels like actual people. 
>> ARTICLE
I see, your thoughts very well put. What I try to say is that Bobduh made a great point about K-On! in his lengthy [Nisemonogatari post](http://redd.it/18p3lt) (approach with caution, spoilers for Nisemonogatari here). Here is the excerpt, but I encourage everyone to read it through to get the whole context.

> I think this intimacy issue is a large part of why something like K-On is so damn successful. This is a kind of fractured and difficult point to make, mainly because the characterization in K-On is very difficult to describe as honest, but I think from the point of view that these are valid characters, K-On attempts to create a continuous mood of emotional honesty and friendly, unabashed intimacy. It invites the viewer into a safe, loving environment free from any of the hidden motives and defenses that characterize the real world, and is always completely honest with the viewer. For those who watch Community, K-On is basically like the ultimate Abed experience  a world based on rules you understand entirely that loves you unconditionally, and is willing to share all of its emotional secrets with you. Intimacy porn. I mainly bring this up because there was a thread a few days ago where someone said they like K-On because the characters feel real. Now, to anyone who knows anything about character writing or, frankly, human beings, that's a ridiculous statement  but I think what was really meant there was that the characters feel honest, which, though they are very fabricated constructions, is certainly true within the context of that show.
>> ARTICLE
Very good post as usual. I think it's been my rewatches of K-On that has given me a more intimate feel for the characters. I feel that dialing back the moe and everything that comes with it while keeping the same character traits for the girls would reveal characters that do feel like actual people. Of course, this would interfere with K-On's prime directive of making the audience feel happy, so it should not be done. Because of this, the choice to sacrifice realism for moe is a choice that makes sense for the show K-On is trying to be.

But after reading that, I would rephrase several parts of the essay where I talk about characters feeling "real". It's plain to me now that there is definitely a major caveat to this sense of "realness".

At least I had a fun ride, hope that season 3 comes one day

I actually almost did this. Was watching a few episodes a day of season two and then I just forgot about it. Just watched it like a month ago when I finished the rest of the series in April last year.
>> ARTICLE
Just curious, why is that?
>> ARTICLE
Because it takes a hammer to your tear ducts.
>> ARTICLE
For some reason, I decided to watch the entire thing as my starter anime. 

I was not prepared for these feels. 

By the time it ended, I kept a straight face, but was crying internally. I still haven't watched the movie yet. 

Then I travelled to Japan and managed to grab an Azusa figurine from a claw game that I played for shits and giggles. In the first try. 
>> ARTICLE
The movie is even worse. [K-On Movie](/s "They replay Tenshi ni Fureta yo, but instead of being a shortened version with Azusa watching them, it's a longer version that shows the girls discussing the song as they're writing it, and it shows them on the rooftop as the sun is setting shortly before they play it for her, trying to figure out the hook. And that's when they decide on the title.") I got teary-eyed in the last episode, but the movie straight up made me cry.
>> ARTICLE
It will make you sad. 

[SPOILERS](/s "Since Yui, Mio, Mugi and Ritsu are all 1 year ahead of Azusa they graduate before her and have to leave her behind. Its very emotional")

Then you watch the movie and are happy again. And then it ends and you restart from Season 1 Episode 1

*someone help, i cant stop*
>> ARTICLE
The ending of the movie also made me sad. As sad as the end of season 2, maybe even more so because I knew at that point it was really the end.

Ah well back to the first season again I suppose.

So it never ends, duh!

Just because it was a good WT doesn't mean it was needed. It wasn't partiuclarly needed, but I like /u/DrJamesFox and I like K-on! and I think I should be allowed to congratulate someone I like for doing a good job with his writing, without having to include a negative opinion as well.

edit: And personally I am absolutely not a fan of voicing my dislike for certain thread types *within* those threads. That is, IMO, quite disrespectful.

Sorry if this sounds sappy, but slice of life shows including the likes of Aria and K-On probably saved my life. I was a depressed mess for much of late 2000s and a lot of things weren't going well in my life and had no friends, I was stressed out constantly and my dog's health was failing (he died in 2011). It was shows like these that helped me feel through my personal slump and made me feel like I had friends, even though it was fictional.  What they say about these shows being 'healing anime' is quite true. They helped heal a deep emotional scar in me. They helped me cope. And I will forever thank K-On and other fun and comfy slice of life anime for that.

/u/missypie has said the same. You two should both watch the movie at the same time and accept that the journey has ended, together.

Best compliment I could possibly receive! 

I realize not everyone likes K-On and it is not my intention to convince them that they should. It was my hope that I could convey to those who don't like K-On what the show does well and how these things cause us K-On fans to love it so much.

Hey now, I never said I disliked the show. It was an enjoyable and decently fun ride, just not something special that I really cared about.

While I generally knew why it's so well received, your post really did make it crystal clear and beyond.

r/anime voted on which anime I should watch next and it was a tie between Tatami Galaxy and K-on. I choose to watch K-on first, because I just finished watching Monster before, and I needed something to pick me up from all the craziness. I do say, it was probably the perfect anime for that, I finished watching season 1, now 4 episodes into season 2.

I really don't mind Moe at all, especially when its used to lighten the mood. However, I feel like its not all just "cute girls doing cute things" with this anime, huh? There is definitely more to it than that. 

Good job on the write up, DrJamesFox.

This was the first SoL i ever watched. Before that i thought SoL was just mindless drivel without any plot. K-on confirmed this but i loved it so I guess I enjoy mindless plotless drivel after all.

I am in awe of the amount of work and attention to detail that you put into your post. The teacher in me wants to critique your writing, but it just wouldn't be called for as we're all fans of anime here and you've taken the time to share your views on a show that you obviously feel highly about. You should be commended for your efforts and I hope your writing convinces a few fans to give SOL a try. 

K-On! is actually the next show on my list to watch after I finish off Knights of Sidonia. I'm a recent SOL convert and I'm really looking forward to finally watching it. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the compliment. 

>The teacher in me wants to critique your writing

It might surprise you to know I'm aware of many of the technical problems with my writing. My cousin, who is quite the writer and anime fan, harshly critiqued my rough draft. I made many of her suggested changes but didn't on others. One of the main goals of my essay was for it to reflect the fun, carefree attitude of K-On. As such, I made several stylistic choices that defied the rules of writing and grammar to accomplish this goal. There are sentences that ramble off topic and instances of caps lock on several occasions in the essay but these are intentional. My cousin also made me aware of an unintentional flaw that I have a tendency to be too wordy with my sentences. I can get my meaning across in fewer words, making it easier to read. I corrected many of these sentences but some still remain because it's an ingrained habit. See this comment as an example!

Now if you have any other writing tips I should keep in mind I am receptive of feedback. 

>K-On! is actually the next show on my list to watch after I finish off Knights of Sidonia. I'm a recent SOL convert and I'm really looking forward to finally watching it.

I hope you enjoy it! I loved Knights of Sidonia and can't wait for season 2!

It's all good - my only advice is that brevity is a blessing when it comes to writing! So many people immediately look for the tldr; and it's easy to lose their attention when they're confronted with a wall of text. But like I said, we're all here to share a mutual interest in something fun and enjoyable so don't feel too self-conscious about your writing. 

Re: Knights of Sidonia
I had few expectations before I started watching, and it's been a pleasant surprise so far. It's certainly got some fundamental flaws, but it manages to entertain despite them. Definitely looking forward to season 2!

Great job on this, man! Must've taken a lot of effort to write it.

Having come from a music club, back in the day, the last scene really spoke to me on a personal level as I once stood on both sides of the issue. When they played that final song, or during the aftermath of that last gig, it brought back the exact same feelings I felt in my time in that club.

We weren't very good. But I wanted more.

As a fan of the series, I must say that you've really hit the nail on the head with this WT! I shall forward it (or blatantly steal it hehe) to convince some of my friends who are still on the fence. Good job and keep preaching the word.

I wouldn't mind a new season of k-on. I mean its not like there needs to be plot. 
>> ARTICLE
This is actually an extremely well written piece and I think a lot of what you said has to do with why there is so much hate towards the newer shows of the same style (SoL and Cute girl/cute thing shows). K-On! was one of the first to really hit it big with the style and thats because how much effort went into making it.

As a side note this is also why I think Love Live has exploded in popularity, because I felt the same kind of things as watching K-On!. Grant it their story was slightly more of a big deal in the grand scheme it was still just about watching the dreams and desires of likable characters play out.

Welp.  Time to get the Blu-Rays out again, cuddle up with my Yui plushie, and watch K-On! again.

Why the Yui plushie?  Because I relate to her for some reason.  I'm not sure why.

A while back I was going through a bit a rough patch. Was feeling really down for about a whole month. Binge watching K-On was actually the only thing that snapped me out of it and got me back on my feet. It was like mind bleach for all the things that were getting me down.

You absolutelyif you'll excuse the clichhit the nail on the head with this post. Fantastic use of gifs; all were very appropriate and some were 10/10 perfect for what you were saying. Based on the ones I saw, I'm assuming you even made some new gifs especially for this post. I was saving all these gifs while reading, making sure not to have duplicates, and I realised just how much of my gif collection is from you posting. xP

Thanks for writing this; it was fun to read and I am always happy to see people sharing anything K-ON related!

Just added some pedantics in case you care about my opinion and/or want to make potential barely noticeable improvements!

"K-Ons Characters Feel Like Real People" section:  
"Seeing Yui grow plays a role **of in** getting the viewer attached"  
I noticed "of in" and thought I'd point it out as I saw you'd edited the post and thought things like this might be a reason why.

"Oh YeahThere is Music in K-On!" section:  
"And also like [in] the show, the music is kind of an afterthought in this post" solely for better flow as "like the show" could be interpreted as the show being an afterthought in the post (even though it obviously isn'tas I said, just for flow). :)  
Would also change the "as it's what brings" later in the same sentence to "as it is" so that "is" from "the music is kind of" is repeated (so much "is"!). This may just be my opinion so if you consider this you might want to ask others but I personally think it flows a little better like that. It really doesn't make a big difference though. ;P

Once again, thank you so much for writing this! It's great to see this post has done so well! :D

>Based on the ones I saw, I'm assuming you even made some new gifs especially for this post.

I have never made a single gif. I have the tools and knowledge necessary to make gifs but I get too caught up in watching K-On and have never taken the time to make any. I've amassed a collection of 700-800 K-On gifs over the course of the past year. I post them every chance I get all over /r/anime and the anime-related subreddits. [Spreading Peace, Love, and K-ON!](http://i.imgur.com/WT87wII.gifv)

>I noticed "of in" and thought I'd point it out as I saw you'd edited the post and thought things like this might be a reason why.

[You've hit the nail on the head!](http://i.imgur.com/vTyiFmE.gifv) When writing, I have a tendency to leave out and unnecessarily include short words like of, is, as, in, etc. I tend to speed read so I often have mistakes involving these words even after multiple proofreads. I took the "of" out of that sentence. 

>"And also like [in] the show, the music is kind of an afterthought in this post" solely for better flow as "like the show" could be interpreted as the show being an afterthought in the post (even though it obviously isn'tas I said, just for flow). :)

I think you mean clarity instead of flow here? The reason I made that mistake is because I was going for flow, but this sacrificed clarity. I started the first sentence with "like the show" and the the next sentence "also like the show" so they'd flow together well. Unfortunately, that second sentence does make it sound like the show is the afterthought, just like you said. This means I have to rewrite the beginning of the sentence because "Also like [in] the show" doesn't make since because I was referring to the show itself and not something "in it" in my previous sentence. 

>Would also change the "as it's what brings" later in the same sentence to "as it is" so that "is" from "the music is kind of" is repeated (so much "is"!). This may just be my opinion so if you consider this you might want to ask others but I personally think it flows a little better like that. It really doesn't make a big difference though. 

Funny how I agree with this edit but for different reasons. I feel like the "it is" is important because I structured the sentence to have "is" contrast with "it's not" earlier in the sentence. Since that "is" is important, I actually italicized "not" and then the rest of the sentence starting with "is" to give it further emphasis. SO MUCH "IS"!!!

Oh, wow! That's some serious gif collecting then. You've actually got 4 times what I've got. :D ^(most probably came from you anyway ;P)

>I think you mean clarity instead of flow here?

That's probably a better word but clarity often contributes to flow for me, probably because I generally don't read overly quickly. I can definitely understand your decision now though; it does make sense.

>SO MUCH "IS"!!!

So much true.

>Thanks for reading it closely enough to notice these little bits!

Glad to! As I said, I'm generally not a fast readerI'm actually a bit pedantic about having read every word, which comes with it's pros and cons. I especially do when I'm enjoying a text and want to fully take it in. :)

[Says he loved Azunyan in S2 but posts a gif from the movie.](http://i.imgur.com/mKMF8bU.gifv)

[Azunyan is way too damn adorable.](http://i.imgur.com/F3ufx3i.gifv) She grows on people in season 2 because she's the POV character almost as often as Yui is. She experiences a nice amount of character growth because of that. Whereas the focus of season 1 is Yui finding a place where she belongs and something worth focusing on, S2 is about Azunyan coming to accept the reason she loves this band isn't because of the music but because of the people in it. She realizes this early on(maybe in season 1 even) but it's continually reinforced throughout the second season as one of the focuses of that season. [She truly becomes a Light Music Club member.](http://gfycat.com/GrimyNaturalBug)

Have you read the K-On High School manga that follows Azunyan, Ui, and Jun trying to keep the Light Music club going? She gets even more growth in that manga and it's damn touching. You also get a great sense of just how important Yui is to her since Yui's off at college.

I am not really a moe fan but it seems to be really good should i watch it??
>> ARTICLE
You should totally give it a few episodes and see how you like it. There's a good deal of moe in the show, but I don't think it's something that really gets shoved in the viewer's face. Worst case scenario you spend an hour or so finding it not really to your liking, best case you find something you'll enjoy immensely.
>> ARTICLE
Even if you're not a moe fan, I still think you could come to enjoy it. There will be an adjustment period of several episodes because it is definitely moe. One thing I noticed while reading comments is that my essay fails to mention how moe this is. It is a bit misleading in this regard because I talk at length about aspects of K-On that make the characters feel real. 

After a few episodes you may start getting used to the moe, which really isn't too different from getting used to any other art style. 
>> ARTICLE
This is awesome, I'm rewatching K-On right now with a friend whose watching it for the first time and reading this was fun.

Alright, I'll check it out.

Can you elaborate a bit on how K-on is "more than" moe and CGDCT?  If you already had, then please blame my reading comprehension.  You wrote quite eloquently about how characterization and personal interaction in K-on! felt substantial and real.  It's these qualities that make fans of the show truly care for the K-ons.  Which, as I understand it, is what make it quintessential moe, but what more is there?  

You touched up on music, but that element seems almost incidental to the show.  I feel that you could substitute "music" with anything else, say, idol or yosakoi or volleyball, and the story line would largely play out the same way.   If not music, then what?  The answer to that question is missing from this discussion.

The defining difference is that K-On does these things so much *better* than the vast majority of SOL anime. It's in an elite tear with others like Non Non Biyori, Barakamon, Usagi Drop, Hanasaku Iroha, and a few other SOL that are masterful with characterization. 

Additionally it's an attention to shifting character dynamics that I have not seen matched in other SOL anime. There are many different ways how the characters behave based on who they're interacting with and what they're doing. I applied one filter to one character to examine the shifting dynamics, but many filters could be applied to many characters that would show differences in behavior. Like I mentioned, K-On focuses on this and their reference to it in anime is evidence that they are aware of this focus. It's why K-On stays interesting over the course of 42 episodes and a movie and fans *still* want more to be adapted.

>You touched up on music, but that element seems almost incidental. I feel that you could substitute "music" with anything else, say, idol or volleyball, and the story line would largely play out the same way. If not music, then what? The answer to that question is missing from this discussion.

It could potentially play out the same way, but the storyline isn't what K-On does best nearly as much as it's a little layer that suggests K-On is carefully constructed. It is SOL, so really the plot and story will always be secondary to the characters.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm almost legitimately offended at you putting K-On in a tier along with NNB and HanaIro. 
>> ARTICLE
But it deserves it.  In fact, K-On! did a better job of drawing me in than either NNB or HanaIro.  It actually was more relatable, in large part because of the common high school setting.  I got kinda whistful there at the end, remembering my own high school years.

And that's what K-On! did better: it made the girls significantly more relatable than any other SOL show that I've ever seen.

In the section on why slice-of-life shows are worth watching, you wrote:

Of course! However, I think this is true of every anime, plot or no plot. This is also true of any artistic creation. Furthermore, the extent to which you deviate from this overriding goal of affecting the viewer's mood correlates to how much you have failed your job as an artist.

Reading this essay made me want to pop in my K-On! dvd again. I've watched the show at least over 20 or 40 times since it first aired. It's just one of those anime you can watch, easily get attached to the characters, never get bored of it, and never want it to end. I really hope we get a college adaption I mean, if the Yuki Nagato manga is getting an anime in April, I'm sure the college years of K-On! could get an anime adaption eventually. Or maybe a movie.  

This is a great essay!!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the wonderful essay! You really put my feeling for the show into words!

As a chorus member back in high school, I really love how realistic the show portraits the girls' feelings and thought every time they perform. The excitement and worry during the first performance, the joy they experienced when the audience cheers for them, the kind of "I'm used to this" feeling for the their later concerts and the bittersweet feeling after the final performance really brings me back to my high school days. I don't think there are many shows that can portrait characters better than K-On!
>> ARTICLE
I'll be honest I didn't go through all text. But thanks to you I will try this next. I always loved SoL genre. Therefore most of my fav anime are from school, comedy, romance and SoL genre. 

But even though I was kinda stating away from music grenre anime. I used to thought what this genre can do apart from practice scenes. But after reading your tldr and intro, I'm gonna start this one as soon as I finish kill la kill.

So, i read all of this.  I read all of this because at the top, you wrote 
>"This recommendation is written to target anime fans who have seen very little or no Slice of Life(SOL) anime, which is anime that usually lack a compelling plot or conflict, instead focusing on the everyday lives of its characters."

I understand that they're good characters and that is what makes this a good show, since you wrote this entire essay about it.  The question that i always have when it comes to things like this, is why couldn't competent characters be placed in a story where something happens?  **Would K-On been significantly worse if there was an overarching conflict?**
>> ARTICLE
> Would K-On been significantly worse if there was an overarching conflict?

I can't say whether it would be "worse" or "better", but it would *not* have been K-ON. It would have been *very* different. 

K-On is singularly focused on making it's viewer happy. To achieve this goal, K-On's world is a safe, adorable, idealistic haven where there is no overarching conflict so the viewer can be confident that everything will turn out wonderfully. An overarching conflict would remove this confidence from the viewer and greatly reduce the consistent feeling of happiness they feel while watching it. 

There are *many* fantastic anime out there that have an overarching conflict, but we're not always in the mood to watch this. Sometimes we just want to feel good, laugh, and relax. K-On is there for us when we feel like this.

Alright, i'm satisfied with that answer.  Unfortunately for me, i just don't think i'll ever be into SOL, but i get that there should be different shows for different tastes.  Thank you for being a kind person about it :)

Maybe give it 3 episodes?

No prob! Thanks for being open minded!

My musical interests have always been all over the place, so if it's catchy to me, I dig it. From CCR to Bryan Adams to Metallica (classic & Black album era). I decided to watch Love Live! and found I liked the musical-type anime and SoL so I went looking for more. Guess what I found? :D I have now watched through it 3 times and it's just as charming every single time. I just feel happy when I watch it, like your OP said. I would probably pass out if I saw plans for a 3rd season, but even without it, I read the High School and College manga and was happy with the ending of the anime. Oh, that ending, it *will* make you cry, or at the very least tear up. What a show. 

Edit: Oh, I am planning a re-watch of this show, or would like to, in late March/early April. Or whenever a spot opens up. Season 1, 2, and then the movie. I have never done one, so I would appreciate any help some fellow K-On! fans can provide, be it advice or otherwise.

Edit #2: A Youtube video I added to my favorites is one I think everyone might enjoy. [Two hours of K-On! songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QoDKUg9DJ4)

That would be from Ga-Rei: Zero, a super-fun yuri filled anime with some great action in it. The dynamic between those 2 girls is compelling, *if you know what I mean.* ;)

Wow, an in-depth analysis on K-On. Good job! I loved how it was simple and to the point. Watching four high school girls coming together and playing music while having tea and cake really was fun and relaxing.

hm, for some reason, happy, fun, adorable and cute as such sound unappealing to me. Tragedies, depressive settings are something I can more easily relate to.

Though quality characterization sounds like something I might nevertheless enjoy, but seems to come in a package that I fear will likely just be highly irritating to me.

Probably will add it to PtW after its a bit less crowded then now...

3 episodes?
>> ARTICLE
Y'know, I usually agree with you.

My favorite shows are stuff like Psycho Pass, Madoka, Code Geass etc shows that are depressing as fuck but I dunno why, K-on just really struck a chord (no pun intended) with me. I just really enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
Understandable. We all have our preferences. Obviously, not everyone will like K-On. If you do try watching it, there will definitely be an adjustment period where you don't buy into it at all. I'd say it's similar to drinking a sweet drink when you don't like sweet. Those first few sips may taste awful because of how sweet they are, but if you keep drinking your taste buds could adjust and make it taste "alright". You'll probably never come to love the sweet drink, but you may learn not to hate it.

As of now there are no plans for any more seasons. Although the story is complete as far as the anime is concerned. The anime follows Yui, Ritsu, Mio, and Mugi from their first day of High School until the day they graduate. 

There is additional source material though, including a manga that follows Yui, Ritsu, Mio, and Mugi in college and a manga that follows Azunyan, Ui, and Jun as they try to keep the Light Music Club going during their Senior Year of High School.

This show seems to get a lot of love. I have my own experience in SOL, but K-On is something I just can't get into for some reason. The first episode feels like a chore to get through, and by the time I finish it, I don't want to start the next episode. Does it eventually get really enjoyable, cause u feel like I'm missing something with all the love it's getting.

>Does it eventually get really enjoyable

Yep, imo.
>> ARTICLE
I have 'almost' all of their songs downloaded, still searching for more. ^^
>> ARTICLE
I love the way the show is animated, but after just watching 2 episodes I was bored as hell. And judging by the first 2 episodes, no they do not act like real humans. But when the time comes, I might look back on myself and laugh.

Since I found Kiniro Mosaic pretty boring, will I find this one boring too? Based on watching Kiniro Mosaic.
>> ARTICLE
The characters in K-On does get more fleshed out in later episodes. They do in Kiniro too, but maybe you just need to get into a certain mindset in order to enjoy these shows. Slice of life isn't for everyone.
>> ARTICLE
> And judging by the first 2 episodes, no they do not act like real humans.

My emphasis on K-On's characters feeling like real people is one thing I'd change about my essay if I were to rewrite it. [This comment exchange](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2xhvo1/wt_kon_how_this_is_the_pinnacle_of_happiness_in/cp09ylx?context=2) brought to my attention that my description of K-On's characters as feeling real should have been made with a caveat. It's clear that I have looked past the moe and the cute-fied reactions to see who these characters actually are underneath. If K-On were to dial back the moe and everything that comes with it, these would seem like real people. But because there is moe, they might not seem that way to first time watchers who aren't used to moe.

Would you say the sub adds value over the dub? I've watched K-On! 3 times dubbed and am considering watching again because it is, as you say, Happiness: The Animation and can't decide whether to try subbed or not.
>> ARTICLE
You about gave me a heart attack but I've calmed down. 

While I tend to mostly watch subs, I'm neutral on the subs vs. dubs debate and examine which I prefer on an anime by anime basis. 

That said, THE SUB FOR K-ON IS INFINITELY MORE ADORABLE THAN THE DUB!! It's really not even close! There's also a lot of meaning lost in the dub because of localization of some of the dialogue. This is especially true with the movie, where the language barrier that fuels many jokes in the sub fall completely flat in the dub.

GO WATCH THE SUB RIGHT NOW!!

[Daijoubu.](http://i.imgur.com/UMVNZrd.gif) I'm not upset, I just can't imagine K-On being watched in any other way than subbed. I've  watched bits of the dub and just doesn't feel like the same show. 
>> ARTICLE
I watched the sub all the way through and then tried the dub out of curiosity. I just couldn't do it. The Japanese VAs just nailed each character too well. I'm not a dub hater, it just varies from anime to anime. DBZ and Cowboy Bebop I prefer dubbed, for example.


>> ARTICLE
Since you took God only knows how long to write this im going to watch k-on im looking for a show that has nothing to think about and just have fun watching 
>> ARTICLE
You have it all wrong, the impressive part of K-On is the fact that you *can* think deeply about it because of how well written it is. The characters are nuanced and developed, and it's all wrapped in a subtlety that rewards the viewer for paying attention to it. Of course, it's enjoyable either way, but if you just think of it as mindless entertainment you're missing what makes it so good. 
>> ARTICLE
i wanted to watch k-on, i've enjoyed other slice of life shows, but where can i stream it if possible?

I am not aware of a site where you can legally stream K-On. If anyone does know of where you can I'm sure they'll drop in here eventually. Until then you'll have to sail the high seas to watch K-On. 

If you're like me, a plebeian streamer who doesn't download, I can PM you my site of choice. Although I cannot post it here because it would break the rules.

I'll be damned. Just did a bit of Wikipedia work on Scandal, it was a cover. The two sound so much alike. Now I'm doubly impressed with the Japanese VAs, that song rocks.

>Covers

>"Don't say "lazy""  Performed on the Music Japan|Music Japan Shinseiki Anime SP in August 2009. It was also performed with Shoko Nakagawa on November 3, 2010 at the Animax Musix|Animax Musix Fall 2010 event. The song is a cover of Sakurakou K-On Bu's song of the same name, the first ending theme of the anime K-On!.

This really did not need a WT!
>> ARTICLE
And this comment is in half of WT! threads. 

I will not deny that K-On is popular. However, I am of the opinion that popular shows which have a barrier of entry for fans warrants there being a WT! thread for them.

In K-On's case, there are two barriers of entry; it being moe and SOL. There is a significant portion of the anime fanbase that avoid these two types of anime and my post's purpose was to convince them that they might be able to enjoy K-On despite their reservations.
>> ARTICLE
K-On is exactly what it says on the tin, though. You're getting moeblobs that don't really do anything, ever. If someone wants to try a slice-of-life music show but isn't usually into the genre, they'd be a lot better off with Tari Tari or Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso instead. Actual plot and character growth, more tolerable art styles, still fantastic music, just superior to K-On in every way...
>> ARTICLE
> Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso

This not a SOL anime. This is a drama. There are clear conflicts that drive the story. Additionally, this show is much more focused on music and uses it to drive character growth. Whereas music in K-On more a catalyst for bringing the girls together. Remember that SOL is a look into the normal, mundane lives of it's characters. What is happening in Shigatsu is not mundane and everyday, it is *significant*.

Shigatsu is probably my anime of the year and may be the first anime to air in the last 2 years that I rate a 10. Shigatsu's goal is very different than K-On's though, and both succeed at achieving their goals. K-On merely wants to make the viewer feel happy. Among other things, Shigatsu wants the viewer to feel how much of a struggle it is to bring oneself out of depression and push forward, even in the face of great obstacles. It also wants to show how much worth there is in struggling through this. So far Shigatsu has moved me in many episodes in it's pursuit of these goals, and I hope it will continue it's success in achieving it's goals. Because these two anime are trying to achieve very different things, comparing these two is apples to oranges. 

A much more fair comparison would be Non non Biyori vs. K-on and Nodame Cantabille vs. Shigatsu. These anime have much more similar goals than the ones you're comparing. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll grant that much. But I'd still lump Tari Tari in with K-On in terms of slice of life, goals or not. Considerably more than Shigatsu at least. 

I'm going to get shot down in flames for saying this, but, honestly, I like *Super Sonico* more than I like K-On. I have no problems with eventless, "this solely exists to make you feel good" series, which is exactly what Sonico is. Mindless, bouncy (very bouncy) fluff with a musical chaser. And unlike everyone else around here, I love it. The music is good, the characters are cute, and the art in general is like a big candy shop with a million colors splashed everywhere.

As a musician myself, I do love that K-On puts such a great emphasis on the musical aspects, I will grant it that much, certainly more than Sonico does. But I just cannot get behind any of the cast at all I'm afraid. And, like a lot of people, I  just can't reconcile that art. Not only for it being what it is, but for what it did to the industry as a whole.

K-On pretty much singlehandedly defined "moeblob" quite literally with its ill-defined line work, and then it bled into series where it just doesn't belong. Such a dramatic work like Kokoro Connect wasn't suitable for K-On art at all. Seeing the original Soranowoto key images and then seeing the K-On art style in a war show was just a punch in the gut. Etc.

I'm honestly nervous about Sound Eufonium even though it *looks* incredible because it's *almost* back to **THAT STYLE** again. 

Annnnd downvotes. Sorry for hating your moeblobs.
>> ARTICLE
> t's almost back to THAT STYLE again                                    .

Just because you hate it doesn't mean that we do

>> ARTICLE
At least he's trying to justify his dislike for K-On now. Earlier he was just shitting on it without providing any justification whatsoever, so this is an improvement. Still, he's blowing my mind when he says he prefers Super Sonico over K-On. There are some people I simply can't understand. 
>> ARTICLE
Do you really think that people who avoid K-On don't know what it is though? From what I can tell it's a pretty simple show without anything really hidden to an onlooker. Cute girls doing cute things and occasionally playing music. Any person who is into anime has probably heard that about K-On a bazillion and one times. And if they avoid it, then it's probably because that simply has no appeal to them. They probably prefer their psychological/action/mecha or what have you. I doubt it's really possible to misunderstand what K-On is about.
>> ARTICLE
I can only speak to my experience, the experience of others I've talked with, and the many comments regarding SOL and moe anime that I see in the anime-related subreddits. 

My experience is I thought I would not like *either* moe or SOL for quite a while. I had seen well over 100 anime before I watched my first SOL and had seen over 200 before I watched K-On. I've spoken with others who experienced similar. Every day I see comments dismissing SOL anime as plot-less and uninteresting. There are many people who are unwilling to even give these anime a chance, and I know if they did, many of them would like them. 

That is one of the groups I am targeting with this essay; those that don't think SOL is for them but haven't given it a try yet. 

So yes, I do think there are many people who *think* they know what K-On is, but I also think the vast majority of these people also don't understand why K-On is loved by it's fans. It's my hope that this essay will articulate why it's loved and might convince many of these anime fans to give it a try. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright so it's mostly an essay advocating SoL with K-On as a demonstrative example.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say that's mostly right. I'd say it's advocating SOL with K-On as the demonstrative example because I think it could serve as those people's introduction to SOL, which is what I said in my "Focus and Intent" section:

>I encourage you to give this a read because it may help you understand why us fans of K-On like it so much and why K-On could serve as your introduction to SOL.

I'd say Nodame Cantabile is better as anime than manga, unless you are a classical music buff and can hear the music in your head from the titles and descriptions alone.

I watched Sakura Card Captor before I even new about manga, and later was amazed at how many of my favorite parts weren't there. Mei Ling was a OC! And I think she was a great addition with a truly moving episode.

Comedy is 9/10 times better in anime form. Then you get to some here and there, but not as many.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I have to agree. I love K-On! and I enjoyed the manga but I know I wouldn't have been as interested if I hadn't watched the anime first. KyoAni added a ton of charm to it and the music was great. 
>> ARTICLE
That's a bit hard to say, some people enjoy reading manga more, some people enjoy the anime more.

Another thing that makes it hard to compare the two is: for example I read a manga and an anime is announced. You watch the anime but you basically know the story already so you'll experience the anime differently (works other way around as well). So imo comparing the two is very hard.

However, I will say that I usually enjoy the battle Shounen anime (Hunter X Hunter, One Piece, Fairy Tail, Soul Eater, ...) more then the manga (fights in manga are usually meh).

>> ARTICLE
is it bad that i prefer watching anime much more than manga?
>> ARTICLE
no, not at all, there are just a different kind of medium to tell the story, some storys work better in anime form, some work better in manga (and manga will have no filler obviously)
>> ARTICLE
No, but you'll miss out on some great experiences if you ignore manga completely.
>> ARTICLE
I completely love the fights and animation in hunter x hunter, but they cut up the "gore" aspect of the manga a bit too much (all I can say is, it is surprising how many people has Hisoka simply decapitated on the manga while on the show you just see cards stuck on their bodies)
>> ARTICLE
My main reason for liking the HxH anime better than the manga is that the art quality of the manga drops significantly over time- especially in the ant arc.  It's just nice being able to see it all clearly now.

> However, I will say that I usually enjoy the battle Shounen anime (Hunter X Hunter, One Piece, Fairy Tail, Soul Eater, ...) more then the manga (fights in manga are usually meh).

I have to agree with you on this one. It's hard to pick out particular series, but in general, watching a fast-paced battle in its animated form is generally more exciting than panels of still-action in manga (unless, of course, the animation studio ran out of budget, leading to mediocre animation sequences). In fact, I never enjoyed the action in the D.Gray-man manga because it was difficult to follow, but watching the anime pulls it all together and helps it all make sense.

Similarly, any series that deals a lot with music (i.e. Beck) tends to be more enjoyable when animated if only for the soundtrack. Scenes where a character sings a passionate song just doesn't have the same "oomph" when you can't hear what they're singing and you're just reading lyrics in a speech bubble.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. The action and music are why I enjoyed initial D so much more as an anime. Even with the pretty bad looking 3D rendered cars it was still much more fun seeing it in motion than as still images on a page with speed lines. Probably didn't help that the tokyopop translation was pretty annoying with random words bolded and I think a few other issues. Plus it has to have the super eurobeat. It just isn't right without that music. The fact that they got the engine sounds right was a nice touch too since I'm in to cars. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the adaptation of part 1 of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is better than the manga, mainly because the art for it is pretty iffy and strange and Koyasu as Dio makes me moist.
>> ARTICLE
for some reason the comment previously stating this got downvoted and deleted, but I think Attack on Titan is a pretty easy example for this question. The anime is adapted nearly shot for shot from the manga, so all the main story beats and characters are untarnished, and the show gets the advantages of having a well-composed soundtrack, exciting and fluid 3D Maneuver Gear scenes that would be impossible to do in print, and consistent art (lack of which is a pretty glaring problem early in the manga). The only downside I could think of is some censored gore shots, but the anime still presents those moments pretty well.

overall, there's not a ton of difference between the two, but I'd say it's pretty hard to argue that the anime isn't a straight upgrade to the manga.

The author of the manga did everything he wanted that he couldn't do or planned to do in the manga, in the anime. So he was directly working with the anime staff, making things better.

The Planetes manga is almost objectively worse than the anime. The manga arranges the stories almost randomly and actually has LESS content than the anime. The anime arranges all of the stories into a cohesive, direct narrative and fills in some of the gaps. I read the manga after finishing the anime expecting the manga to be amazing (like with most shows), but it turned out to be actually confusing and not as enjoyable. Plus, the anime is just very good visually and really captures a lot of the wonders of space.
>> ARTICLE
For me personally Full Metal Alchemist was better. 
The original anime story did not follow the manga, but I liked it better (everything except the ending). 

But that's just my opinion and I'm pretty sure majority of the people will disagree with me.

Not an anime but I enjoyed Death Note Life Action movie more then the manga. It just has a better story and way better ending. 
>> ARTICLE
As awesome as Fuhrer-King Bradley destroying a tank was, the original anime was better, and I liked its story better.  I felt there wasn't any superfluous characters or wasted plotlines, it all added up to a climax.  Then in the manga there are like four chimera dudes who really were never necessary to anything.

But there are only few of us who prefer FMA over FMA Brotherhood. 

I just don't get it why did they have to add Nazi's to the ending. If they made a better ending I'm sure original FMA anime would be top 5 animes of all time.

That movie was on the same tier of bad as the 2nd Kenshin OVA (Seisouhen)

>> ARTICLE
I liked it, but I felt it really came out of left field. And not a good out of left field.

I feel like that whole movie was a poor attempt at giving FMA more duality. Duality is huge in anime, but that just felt odd. I enjoyed watching it and thought it was interesting, but still felt off.

I like FMA, but I do like FMA:Brotherhood. Not sure which I prefer more, but I have a feeling I would lean towards Brotherhood.

I think it's manga called Jigoku Shoujo = The hell girl. The drawing in manga an anime is completely different. And in anime is so much better. It has a different atmosphere and the anime is more scary and serious. The manga is drawn like some stupid school comedy but in anime it's so cool! 
>> ARTICLE
K-On!, from what I've read, is a much better anime than it is a manga - not that the manga lacks quality, simply quantity. The anime adds a lot of jokes that weren't in the manga while keeping all of the original content intact. In addition to that, being a music-based manga, being able to actually hear the songs being played is obviously a huge plus!

Except that most of the time when the girls start playing, it cuts to another scene.

Yeah, they tend to cut off music unless it's a performance, and performances like the ones at school festivals are shortened, but then, that's why they have actual albums! It's still better than the manga, which just shows you that they're playing music, with no means for you to listen to it.

I've read a lot of Hajime no Ippo manga, not all of it, but from what I have read I think the anime is better. The animation in fights scenes is really cool and the addition of sound effects and music makes them feel amazing to watch.
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion the Kare Kano anime is far superior to the manga. Gainax took a rather standard shoujo and made it fun, until arguments with the mangaka made it boring again. Also Haibane Renmei is better as an anime but that isn't really fair as the manga wasn't fully fleshed out. Last one I want to mention is Whisper of the Heart, where Ghibli just did a fantastic job adapting the manga.

Hunter X Hunter(2011) by far can't recommend this series enough even to none shounen fans.
>> ARTICLE
I know that it didn't come from the manga, but I feel is worth mentioning since I feel a number of people may have tried the manga after seeing how slow it's pacing was may have tried going the manga route: Shin Sekai Yori. 


Oh God.


I finished the anime and loved it, wanted to read the novels but saw that there was a manga version as well. Up until that point I hadn't heard about the manga, only the novels, and thought to give it a try. I tried reading but couldn't. It's so bad, for art, plot, EVERYTHING. It turned a pretty good storyline into absolute crap and fan service. Ugh.
>> ARTICLE
Planetes is far, far better in Anime form than in the Manga form. I recommend the American voice cast as well, as I think they did a phenomenal job in taking what the Japanese cast saw as a "meh" script and acting the hell out of it.

I also have a soft spot for Maison Ikkoku in Anime form as well. I put it on par with the Manga. They tell what amounts to the same story, just with slightly different variations and timing. The Manga is funny, but is much more romantic than the TV series, which plays up the comedy and just how weird Godai's neighbors are.


>> ARTICLE
I think the anime of Another is so much better than the manga. The music really helps build some of the suspense and the dolls are much more creepy. 
>> ARTICLE
IIRC Another was originally a LN, both manga and anime are adaptations.
>> ARTICLE
I have my doubts that the anime was better than the light novel too, though I haven't read it. The pacing was, in my opinion, very poor for an anime but a story told slowly is more acceptable in prose.
>> ARTICLE
Shingeki no Kyojin. The manga isn't bad at all but the anime is by far better, it's revolutionary in terms of animation.
Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad. I would only say that it's anime is better because you can actually hear the songs the band writes.

>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't say the animation is revolutionary (if someone has examples I would love to be shown. Honestly). But what I feel it does better in animation is link what appears to be some old school techniques with new school techniques. This is NOT a knock on Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) because I think the anime is awesome. 

I would say the brightest spot is really the soundtrack. It really shies away from the pop that a lot of anime loves. The opening and closing credits are probably the worst songs in the anime and they aren't half bad.
>> ARTICLE
I say the animation is revolutionary because of the blend of the 3D environment with the 2D characters designs. It's all visually appealing and makes the fights even more intense and easier to follow. 
>> ARTICLE
Okay. So we are both in agreement. I could see it being called revolutionary. It marries old school with the new (2D with 3D). I will say the detail is killer. The only time I have seen the details a little muddled was when titans are seen walking within the buildings. The proportions sometimes seem off. 
>> ARTICLE
Aside from the ones that haven't been said here, probably Gintama.

If you read the manga, there's just too many words and it's a chore to read it all sometimes. It's just so much better to see it and hear the VAs speak all the words.

EDIT: I'm also going to add Arpeggio. The manga itself isn't that bad, I just think the anime was so much better.
>> ARTICLE
FLCL is better as an anime, because of the beautiful animation and kickass soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
If I'm not mistaken, FLCL was originally a test for Gainax's newest animation technology and was first produced as an anime by locking the animators in a room with some advanced animation programs and some LSD. The written publication came after.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like this isn't true but I want it to be.
>> ARTICLE
The important part of the comment is true: It was an anime before it was a manga.

It's probably not true that animators were locked in a room with LSD...or locked in a room at all. It's a pretty common rumor that it was mostly to test new animation technology, and that may or may not be true.

Seto no Hanayome/My Bride is a Mermaid is significantly better as an anime than the original manga was, in my opinion. The art is pretty bad and the manga author has a pathological addiction to introducing new characters who are promptly forgotten afterwards.

I liked the Trigun anime way more than the manga, which I feel is a similar opinion to most people in the west.
>> ARTICLE
No no no. The only problem with the manga is that it is occasionally hard to follow. The trigun manga is, imo, far superior to the anime.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is too overt with things, IMO, which breaks a lot of the suspense and mystery that was present in the anime.  Additionally, I prefer the way Chapel and Wolfwood are related in the anime, as well as a couple of other, more minor things.
>> ARTICLE
Well I admit it's been over 10 years since I watched the anime, but I remember thinking the manga was an improvement.

Though I think the manga has its flaws. Some parts are extremely confusing. The art is occasionally incomprehensible and Nightow's strong opposition to using arrows attached to his speech baloons makes thinks even more difficult to follow.
>> ARTICLE
Genshiken is overall a very faithful adaptation which I would say usually comes very close to matching the original manga. I wouldn't say it's usually better, but there's one episode of the anime which really resonated with me which was mostly original content for the show. The final episode of the second season of the original show (no, not the final episode of the very confusingly titled *"Genshiken: Second Season"*) called "What Lies Ahead..." shows Sasahara repeatedly applying and getting rejected from jobs, getting desperate to find any damn job but still failing on his fallback applications, and falling into a slump of depression before finally almost accidentally landing a job that was basically perfect. This essentially happened to me out of college, and their portrayal of it was brilliant. In the manga they make oblique references to Sasahara job hunting and show his successful job interview without really diving into how terrible job hunting can be. That episode far surpassed the manga's handling of Sasahara's job hunt, and was so pitch-perfect I think it might be the most powerful moment in all of the series history in either medium. (Though it's a damn shame that they never adapted Sasahara's confession to Ogiue to anime, because it follows pretty close behind Sasahara job hunting...)
>> ARTICLE
Why not just find anime with original stories that are not based on a manga?
>> ARTICLE
Because when people say "manga" in this context, they often mean "original medium." Novels, games, etc are included. Many people just assume manga is the only alternative, but novels are the same pretty much just not drawn.

I know just some anime films which they're original, but anime is based on manga or novel, right? I don't know any anime which is 100% original. Do you know any? I'd like to watch it.

I actually found that bokurano anime did some things better than the manga. Both were kind of mediocre however.

The Blue Drop anime was much better than the manga, but was not very good either (the manga was just really bad)
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, Blue Drop. I wanted to like that anime so much, but the yuri aspect was so un-fulfilling ([](/s "there was one kiss scene in like the second to last episode, and that was pretty much the entirety of the "romance"")) and the [](/s ""tragic end"") was *completely* undermined by the fact that [](/s "mere seconds before crashing the ship, THEY SHOWED THAT IT HAD ESCAPE PODS! Why the hell could she not just set it on auto-pilot and GTFO along with the other girl?! Don't tell me that thing had no auto-pilot, it's a fucking extra-dimensional space submarine!")

Goddamn, nothing irks me more than [](/s "sad endings that are 100% completely avoidable with just some damn common sense").
>> ARTICLE
You tell me, I almost got into my pen to write some serious fanfic. But in the end my procrastination got the better of me.

In the end I think the source material hampered blue drop more than it helped. The shitty future was already set in stone. Maybe something set after the manga would be better. But in any case, the manga was really shitty. If I had read that on beforehand I would have never watched the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Utena: the manga started first and isn't bad. The TV series is quite different. It adds a ton of obtuse references, symbolism, and an amazing soundtrack.

Excel Saga: again, the manga started first. It's humorous and interesting, but the TV series adds a lot more comedy and several new characters.

Going along with what Duckface08 said, music-based manga are tough to appreciate. Nodame Cantabile and La Corda d'Oro are two more examples.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the Deathnote a whole lot better than the manga. Although I did admittedly read it after I had seen the anime and I loved the hell out of the anime so that could be why.
>> ARTICLE
**Initial D** is easily the first title I think of when comparing anime to manga. There's just no sense of speed in the original manga, and it's so goddamn ugly. The amazing soundtrack also helps push the anime ahead of the original.  
  
**Skip Beat** is also, strangely, better than the manga. Watched the first 13 episodes of the anime (everything out at the time), marathoned 20 volumes or whatever of the manga, and left it feeling the anime had better pacing, showed the acting parts much better, etc.  
  
**Yowamushi Pedal** hooked me hard with the first three anime episodes, and being unable to wait another week, I marathoned 29 manga volumes in a couple of days. While I think the manga is fantastic, I got a better impression from the anime in the parts it covered. Much prettier, for one.
>> ARTICLE
Initial D is one of they few shows I absolutely could not stop watching. I like the manga of it a lot but the soundtrack and the sound of the car engine is why I think it's a better anime.
>> ARTICLE
Azumanga Daioh: it feels more cohesive than a series of 4Komas and makes the ending much more emotional. Plus, the dream sequences are better animated.

SnK: The character designs are uniform, action sequences are well done, and mini-arcs add character without feeling like tacked on filler (usually).

Initial D: Eurobeat music makes everything better.
>> ARTICLE
Mushishi.

The original manga is pretty great. The anime is even greater because of the music and the effect of the colors. There's so much quality in the anime it's amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Sword Art Online. The original medium was the light novels, which are superior to both the anime and the manga, I'd give them a 9/10. The anime was an enjoyable watch, 7/10. While the manga gets 2/10 in comparison.  
Also, Elfen Lied. Although you'll find many people who disagree.  
They would say; the anime deviates from the original ending which was brutal, and tones down quite a few of the existing scenes.  
While I'd say the ending they created was better if not as conclusive. And all the things they toned down needed to be toned down, because sometimes the manga just took things so far you find it ridiculous and it breaks immersion.  
Plus, the art in the manga really seemed to drop in quality towards the end. While the anime was well animated the whole way through, AND had fantastic music.
>> ARTICLE
I felt that the anime adaptation of Welcome to the NHK blended the best parts of both the manga and original novel really well and the soundtrack was absolutely perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Animes like Beelzebub work better on screen I think. 
>> ARTICLE
It could have, but it didn't. It had terrible animation and it often panned away during scenes so they had to animate some of the funniest stuff, like Oga and Tojo beating the shit out of each other while laughing. In the manga you can visibly see it, but in the anime they cut it away to a fucking river or something while you can only hear it. 

I love the manga, but the anime for Beelzebub just didn't even come close to doing it justice in many departments. The only thing I felt they did right was the voice cast; that was phenomenal.

Fate/Stay night from DEEN is listed higher than Fate/UBW from ufotable? ^^^jesus^christ
>> ARTICLE
Haven't watched any of Fate series, can anyone tell me why is Fate/Stay night so hated while everyone loves the other series?
>> ARTICLE
Um....its complicated. 

The F/Sn that is hated is the 2006 version. Its considered a very poor adaptation of the Fate route of the F/Sn visual nove,especially in regards to the protagonist. It has plot points and spoilers from the 2 other routes, and because of mixing up all those it suffers from pacing issues.Also the animation is very poor and hasn't stood the test of time.

The other 2 series are F/Sn Unlimited Blade Works- which adapts the 2nd route of the VN very faithfully and is a great anime overall. And Fate/Zero- which is the prequel of the F/Sn anime, and is considered one of the top tier animes to come out in the last 5 years.

There are other stuff related to the Fate franchise- Fate/Kaleid which is an alternate universe thingy but still loads of fun apparently, the Unlimited Blade Works movie which is made by the same studio of the 2006 version and also considered pretty bad adaptation unlike the newer series.

Hope that was helpful!
>> ARTICLE
so if i want to start watching fate what order would you recommend?
>> ARTICLE
So basically it is hated because DEEN fucked it up. I just started watching it(going to watch whole franchise), and i can understand why it gets all the flak. The animation quality is by far the worst in any anime i've seen(haven't seen that many, i'm more of a manga guy). 

The overall production is just piss-poor by not just the standarts of 2006 but even the entere 2000s.

Your comment was very helpful, thanks for taking time to answer me!

PS: A couple episodes in and i see why Saber's the best girl.

Yeah, DEEN certainly dropped the ball on this series. So it kind of deserves the criticism it receives.

Saber's romance was not only horrible but her character is just asinine. She's like the least likable character in that show, and I will never understand why she's popular. Fate Route was horribly average, and it should only be slated as average. UBW and HF are incredibly better, and so are their heroines. I'm probably going to get down voted for this but whatever, I just can't stand her nor her nonsense. 

In my opinion:

Heaven's Feel > UBWRoute > UBW Anime > A ton of shit(including FZ) > Fate Route >>> Fate Anime >>>> UBW Movie

There's literally no point in debating with someone with such obviously bad taste.  Just let him stew in his own edgy salt.

>> ARTICLE
At this point, it's just different taste, not bad. It doesn't mean that you like Saber that you have bad taste, just not the same taste as me. The contrary can also be applied. While I did say that I did not understand why someone would like a character like Saber,  I never judged anyone who actually did. 

We are talking about fictional characters at the end of the day. People will dislike some, and others will dislike others. I may disrespect a character and you can too, but there's literally no reason to disrespect each other because of our divergent tastes. 
>> ARTICLE
> Saber's romance was not only horrible but her character is just asinine. She's like the least likable character in that show, and I will never understand why she's popular. 

This entire statement is contrary to what you just said. By making this claim you are judging her popularity and by extension judging why people like her. If you were just talking about the character, then sure, your earlier statement you stated rings true but you went and said you'll never understand her popularity. That undermines your entire argument man. So even if you didn't mean to judge people for liking her you've unintentionally implied that and mostly come off as someone who's just annoyed with Saber fans for making her popular.

I was mostly joking for the most part anyway. Saber is indeed my favorite and I banter often that the other girls are shit but I'm joking at the end of the day for the fun of it. I like or at least appreciate basically every character in the Fate Franchise. Except for Shinji. Fuck that guy.

You must be new to anime, If you're the MC you can do whatever you want to your romance option and it does not matter

No I'm not new to anime. I don't think anyone who actually seen a 40+ hour visual novel is new to anime. He treats her like shit, and like the shallow veggie she is, act as if it bothers her but does nothing about it. Her apparent growth was extremely shallow and sexist all things considered. So much that I will not consider it growth but digression. I feel like Saber is an insult to actually strong female characters. She can fight, but she doesn't have the mentality that makes a character strong. 

Sakura also doesn't have it, but she got an interest enough character conflict that I can look past it. Her personality is also pretty well rounded. Rin is just extremely badass in terms of personality and is a character who's portrayed much better than most women in such fiction. She's ultimately perfect.  
>> ARTICLE
And the MC is just bad in general, doesn't make saber any worse. 

Rin is perfect you say, so saber is missing the tsundere ? 
>> ARTICLE
Rin Tohsaka. (I made an essay or something like that about Rin a long time ago, so here)

Rin is without a doubt the deuteragonist of FSN. For a character usually known as a tsundere she is one of the most complex characters in the Fate Series. She has many layers. First, in her day to day, we see the perfect student persona. This way, she keeps herself away from the normals so she doesn't have to hurt them if they find her secret. Then we see how she behaves once she relaxes a bit, with Ayako. And we see a person who is witty and likes have verbal fights while maintaining a facade of elegance and aloofness. Behind that, we discover the cold magus that she likes to think she is. That's it, until Shirou breaks through that layer like a sledgehammer (punny) and we finally see the tsundere. And that's not even her final layer. Once Shirou (and the watchers/readers) see whats behind her magus persona, we see a character with flaws, flaws that in my case endear her to me even more. She is stingy, has a short temper, is lazy and weak in the mornings, isn't honest with herself about her feelings, is a bit of a manipulator and likes to make fun of other people.  


But she also likes to have a challenge, has a very high sense of fair play at the beginning (whatever advantages she gets after the start is another matter), wants to keep the innocents around her safe, takes her responsibilities seriously, is very intelligent and, above all, incredibly funny. She is the character with whom I laugh the most in the novel/anime. And behind all of that, we find her true persona. A kind person. In my opinion, probably the kindest character in FSN, by far (probably Sakura is the only one who is somehow close, but not that close. Again, this is my opinion). She is compassionate, and despite her words, thinks of the others around her before herself (but in a much more balanced way than Shirou, she knows to keep the balance that is her own person safe so she can measure things, to somehow use her words). 


It helps to bring my opinion of her higher that, without having a really game breaking ability (besides being a genius magus, and in a war like the HGW that doesn't help that much when you face some of the monsters of the war) or being overpowered to the max, she can take names and kick asses, even when completely overwhelmed [Spoiler](/s "oh, hello there, Caster, let me introduce you to my FIST TO THE KISSER!"). Oh, and she is cute. I can't forget to mention that. 


Rin's case is a strange one for me. I'm usually a sword and childhood friend person, and I favor the underdogs over the stars, but Rin came, looked at Saber and Sakura (sword in the first case and underdog and childhood friend in the second) and kicked them out of the ladder. Hard. And with hard I mean harder than what  [Spoiler](/s "Herk ")could do. Although Sakura managed to get near it with time. [Spoiler](/s "I blame her shadow induced almost omnipotence cheating to let her recover, or something. And Hollow Ataraxia, can't forget about that.")

>> ARTICLE
Also Saber is shit because she's shit. Shirou was shit in Fate route too, but it was how she related to him in that route that brung her character down with him. Her relationship with him, her own basic character and her asinine growth are what made her a horrible character. HA improved their relationship but sadly, her character stayed as basic as before. 
>> ARTICLE
So.....

TL;DR You like Rin as your waifu because you pretty much skimmed over Sakura as quickly as you could despite her desire and motivations literally being the most complicated of the series

Cool
>> ARTICLE
So, she is complex cause she is the average tsundere that is prideful, tough, and kind underneath. Gotcha. Makes her perfect. Gotcha.

In that end, she was portrayed as this horrible women who dared to defy her men. Ultimately, she was portrayed as if she was in the wrong for killing him, and that she was a horrible person for doing so. 

Not to forget that I stated that:


and like the shallow veggie she is, act as if it bothers her but does nothing about it.


I really want to point the fact that I stated that she acted as if it bothered but did not do anything to dissolve her relationship with Shirou, instead, she decided to hop on the very person who treated her like an uncapable piece of shit. 
>> ARTICLE
That is the connotation you have given to that ending or even that conversation. Instead I see it as an act of an independent person that has the right to chose but it is in a position where she personally doesn't feel comfortable with the outcome because of all the time they spent together.
Furthermore, the way Shirou acted was because ofhis PTSD and survivor guilt than Saber understood because she saw his past.
He was the first to treat her as a person, unlike Britain or Kiritsugu. (Well Iri classifies but because she had the same condition as her)

That's a misconception that stems from Cowboy Bebop having a number of issues when it first aired in Japan. The series is very popular over there, it's considered a global sensation for a reason.
>> ARTICLE
It was even the Animage Anime Grand Prix runner-up and Editor's Choice winner when it came out, so it wasn't exactly under the radar even back then.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty much.

Honestly a lot of the "Cowboy Bebop was a flop in Japan" comes from the idea that only "moeshit" sells over there.
>> ARTICLE
Ping Pong not even mentioned wtf
>> ARTICLE
I've watched the last 2 episodes of that show about a dozen times.  Truly a great series.

>> ARTICLE
Sorry. Too many anime, and I want to keep the list short.

Maybe next year when I post an update.
>> ARTICLE
What I find as few surprises on this: 

* Ga-Rei: Zero is relatively high
* Revolutionary Girl Utena is still in the high 200s
* GATE I thought was a big hit, guess I was thinking wrong
* Legend of the Galactic Heroes is **not** in the top 100
* School Days is in the top 200
* Jojo, OPM, and NHK are in the 300s
>> ARTICLE
GATE had a good premise, but the harem aspect just got really grating after a while. It felt really forced and added nothing to the story. Also having a female character, that looked like a pre-teen, go into a weird orgasmic trance whenever there was a slaughter got really gross really fast... (=_=)
>> ARTICLE
I don't think those are the reasons it is not rated as good in Japan, nobody complains about harems or goth loli goddesses. It's much more likely it's about the Anime toning down the violence and not being true to the source thus fans of either the web or the light novel or the manga not rating the adaptation high.
>> ARTICLE
The violence was also toned down from the manga which had toned it down from the LN, so being a sub-par adaptation might have something to do with it.  It's also rather nationalistic, which could make the current target audience uncomfortable.
>> ARTICLE
Where could I read the Light Novels in English? I'd like to read what the author had in mind with the violence
>> ARTICLE
I'm not into LN's so I couldn't tell ya.  Even if I knew I'd probably have to pm you the site because I doubt it's legal.
>> ARTICLE
I will add that even the LN isn't strictly the original as there was a novel before that (but there shouldn't be much of a difference).

Someone seems to have picked it up. Check Bakatsuki (I'm not sure if fan-translations count as piracy on this sub so use some google-fu). Someone has translated the first book and are working on the 2nd one. 
>> ARTICLE
I think NHK hit too close to home for many viewers. It's hard to be objective about a show if it makes you gaze deep within yourself in a brutally effective way. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's not forget FMAB is ranked 30. 
>> ARTICLE
Because it doesn't take place in Japan.

Joke aside, it would be meaningless to compare both websites if they don't weight the scores the same way. On MAL you need to have at least watch 20% of the anime for your score to have weight. If on Anikore your score counts without even asking how many episodes you have watched (I don't know that) then it would be meaningless to do a comparison. 

There's also the fact that they might calculate the score differently. MAL only takes the overall score in consideration, while Anikore might not.
>> ARTICLE
> Ga-Rei: Zero

It is a fantastic thriller IMO.
>> ARTICLE
the pocky scene was thrilling for sure
>> ARTICLE
> Legend of the Galactic Heroes is not in the top 100

Probably because the rating system on MAL means only people that have watched 24+ episodes of LoGH have their scores taken into account.
>> ARTICLE
Even Japan wants more Haruhi Suzumiya. (The actual main series, not the spinoff). 
>> ARTICLE

Well, on MAL SSY is rated slightly higher (in top 100, if I recall correctly)

It's actually more of a popularity ranking (mix of popularity and rankings). So comparable to MALs rank of 252 for Yosuga no Sora.

Que?????

So let me get this straight. They think that the Studio DEEN adaptation is better than both seasons of UBW. They also think that the UBW MOVIE by DEEN (The one with [this gem of a battle](http://i.imgur.com/93g3sId.jpg)) is better than the second season of UBW.

Sasuga, Japan. I bet the Saberfags are the cause of this.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, the Fate route is the Saber romance route, and therefore the best route with best girl, and Japan loves Saber... so it's not that surprising.  If Ufotable was to redo the Fate route proper and throw in the True Ending in Avalon, I would bet my life savings that it would pass DEENs and UBW over in Japan.

This is what makes me scared to watch the Seven Deadly Sins anime adaptation.  Manga is super fun, but the anime looks half-assed.  I hope i'm wrong.

I watched it, and IMHO it's very well done. I heard some manga readers say they cut a bit off and changed some parts, but that's to be expected in an adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
I just finished Seven Deadly Sins never having read the manga, and I thought it was very well-done. The humor, pacing, and animation were consistent, and the scope of the world-building and battles was really impressive.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't read the manga but it seemed fine to me, didn't have horrible pacing or quality issues from what I can tell.
>> ARTICLE
Give it a try, its a pretty fantastic series IMO. Manga readers in the discussion threads also said it was a relatively faithful adaption, only shuffling around events and cutting some details (to fit ~100 chapters into a 24 episode run) when absolutely necessary to maintain a sound narrative.
>> ARTICLE
Well, from all the positive feedback just from this i'll probably give it a go this weekend!  Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Thats wrong... the anime is also ridiculously popular. One of the maybe 5 anime you can truly consider mainstream. Is in the top 5 for anime TV ratings every week.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it's popular (although less popular than the manga), the "not so much" was meant more for the quality aspect (I mean, the anime certanly has it's moments, but over time it really lost the hang of it).
>> ARTICLE
last time I watched it, the anime consisted of 10 mins of new content and the rest of recaps, filler content (like the voice intro and stuff), OP and ED. and the animation is...well...Toei (nothing more needs to be said here)

If it got any worse then may god have mercy on the anime viewer's sole. 

EDIT:
>sole 

I am not changing that lol
>> ARTICLE
The early parts were actually pretty good, yeah they had recaps but you could generally skip them and have a good time. The thing is that they started to make each episode the equivalent of 1 manga chapter, and it's absolutely impossible to do so, things just got so slow and the pacing went to shit, along wiht the animation quality, nowadays it's just...not good...(though I have to admit they shine in the important bits)
>> ARTICLE
As a Japanese, I guess that voters who use this site is almost all of the "anime" otaku and they don't treat One Piece as an anime. Beyond that, that is the most popular/selling manga in Japan, so the manga is more popular than the anime and the fans mostly have read only manga just like FMA:B,HxH,JOJO... imo. Sorry if it was hard to read.

>> ARTICLE
Out of curiosity, did you watch Castle in the Sky subbed or dubbed? Also, which would you recommend if you have seen both?
>> ARTICLE
Subbed, but dubs for Ghibli movies tend to be good. I watched the old one first and then the remake just to see what has changed. Almost everything in the old one is in the new version as well. If you do not care for comparing, then you will be fine with the new one. But personally, it is a fun thing to do and the old one is not that bad.

One of the problems though with that is both Gintama and Gintama' are both on it. 
>> ARTICLE
It's not just nostalgia. It was a very competent adaptation, especially for the time. In terms of animation quality both are stellar and the 1999 adaptation holds up pretty damn well.

I think what bumps the 1999 up a notch is the tone set by the use of color and sound. It used muted colors which suited the darker direction Hunter X Hunter eventually moved into (with body part traficking, gangsters, assassins, murder, and eventually drugs and cannibalism all being major parts of the story), while the 2011 adaptation continued to use the bright saturated palette that suited the series early on, but less so with every arc. Since both adaptations are highly competent, similar to FMA vs. FMA:Brotherhood situation, the Japanese audience probably rated the older one higher because the tone was more in-line with what is depicted in the story.

I actually really hate that comic because it ignores all context of the situation to make Shinji look like a bigger bitch than he is. 

By piloting that robot Shinji's mental state lowers because he's fighting shit you would see in nightmares all while feeling the pain himself (Not to mention that it sometimes goes Berserk harming him/his friends/ random people further fucking him up mentally), Misato is a slobby alcoholic who wouldn't sleep with him anyways because she views him as a child, Asuka genuinely hates him and she's a bitch anyways, and Rei [Evangelion](/s "is his sister/mother.")

Like if they left out the first panel I would have taken the comic's comedy at face value, but they include that so it just seems like a shitty argument saying Eva is shit.

You are telling me that one of the most influential series to be ever created, and what is till today the best selling anime release of all time, shouldn't be in the top 100?

I love Eva and I realize it's not everyone's cup of tea, but we are not talking about top 10 or top 3, but top 100. 

If you don't think Eva deserves a spot in the top 100, then I don't know what you think should. 

I would ask you to name 100 titles better than Eva, but that would be a waste of my time and yours.

#triggered

I can name 100 animes that has an actual ending which would beat Eva *tv* series. Also I've seen eva before I've seen the internet so I know what going vanilla into the series is like, and it feels like "It would've been better series if it had better ending and mc".
>> ARTICLE
I think most people who have watched 100 anime can name 100 anime with subjectively better endings than Evangelion, that doesn't make the characters, plot, animation, or aesthetic any worse
>> ARTICLE
but characters are badly written/generic, plot is conclusionless, animation goes to hell as show progresses and aesthetic is probably the strongest point.
>> ARTICLE
Actually The World of Golden Eggs is the best selling anime release of all time (don't ask me why, not a damn clue), Evangelion is 2nd ;P

Though, SAO will probably pass it in the near future (if it hasn't already) if we are including all season volumes.
>> ARTICLE
I'll do you one better: Evangelion should absolutely be cemented in the top 3 anime of all time and it's a crying shame that many people don't see it that way.

influential doesn't necessarily = best. I don't think the original eva tv series should be in the top 100 either, on it's own it really isn't that amazing.

The ones that really surprised me with their spots are True Tears, Nausicaa, Nagi no Asukara, and Chihayafuru.

I thought the general perception of True Tears was quite awful even though it's one of my personal favorites so it being placed in the top 100 was a shock. Nausicaa, for obvious reasons. As for Nagi no Asukara and Chihayafuru... I'm just glad they have a high ranking cause both of them are true hidden gems. Nagi no Asukara was perceived well and is very well liked on the sub so I'm not that surprised, but Chihayafuru in top 10 was unexpected.

I think its one of the best shonen. Not the best action anime seeing as **spoiler alert** everyone dies in one punch, which is extremely lackluster in the practical sense. However as a whole: comedy, production, sound, visual entertainment, action, and concept it is certainly an anime worthy of praise and prestige.

This happens all the time. People dislike it when people like things they don't, so they *must* voice their opinion as loudly as possible. Eventually, people that liked it get scared that their opinion is "wrong" because the vocal minority, well, becomes vocal, and eventually stop posting their opinion. You can see that with almost any popular series, whether it was SAO, AoT, FSN, etc. Hell, even less popular ones face this.

It does get fairly slow after the first half of the anime, but I wouldn't go so far as to say its "bad".

Yeah SAO was kind of the worst case though. First pretty much everybody loved it and then after a while everybody seemed to hate it. So slowly most people started disliking it.
I still like it though but all the negativity has kinda ruined it for me.

Highly agree. People say OPM has its moments but it slowly leaves you unsatisfied, but I very much disagree with that. I watched the whole series twice, once right after I watched the final episode.

>> ARTICLE
I thought the same thing with Shigatsu. Figured it would drop like NGNL. 

I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
>> ARTICLE
They aren't at all comparable.  Shigatsu started the season higher than OPM and stayed there.  OPM started out lower and rose higher based on hype, as as you can already see, it will likely drop back down to a more reasonable level eventually.

Shigatsu had a much better story than OPM as well from the sounds of it.
>> ARTICLE
Uhh... Shigatsu started at an 8 and rose to it's current score as it aired and after it finished. OPM started at an 8.5 and rose to it's current score as it aired. No different.

OPM has a +9.00 score. That's not easy to achieve on MAL. At this point I'd be surprised to see it drop below that.

> Shigatsu had a much better story than OPM as well from the sounds of it.

And that's totally subjective. I myself would very much disagree with that statement. Shigatsu has a clear and complete story, but not necessarily a better one.
>> ARTICLE
one punch man had amazing fights and music, but it didn't have a story holding it together like shigatsu which is important to an anime holding its rank.
>> ARTICLE
Gintama would disagree.
>> ARTICLE
> Welp, I'm all for letting people like what they want, but IMHO even fans of SAO will agree that is preposterous.

Fan of SAO here, it kind of depends how you're ranking it.  In terms of my favourite anime that I enjoy watching, it's easily in my top 20, probably in my top 5 even.  Considering these sites are more or less popularity contests, then of course SAO is going to be top 20 in Japan.

If we're talking about the quality of a show, then SAO being top 20 might be pushing it a tad, but I could see top 100 argued depending on one's perspective.  But I could also see an argument that FMA:B being #1 on MAL is equally as absurd.  Why is FMA:B above Shirobako?  I think that's ridiculous.  Of course, not everyone is going to agree with me, such is the realm of subjectivity ;P
>> ARTICLE
Yes, if people rank it based on enjoyment I've got no problem it being in the top 25, I wouldn't agree with it, but I would find it fair. Now, it's *""""supposed to be""""* based on quality, that's why I just can't find it in me to let it have such a high position, it's just that...I mean... even if you're a fan you've got to agree, there are at least 16 series/movies that are more well done, I know it's a subjective thing but throw me a bone here...

Now with FMA:B, yes, I also don't think it should be 1st, but it's got enough quality that I won't really find it unfair or extremely ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
> Now, it's """"supposed to be"""" based on quality

You and I both know that never has been the case nor will it ever be ;P

I already said I did!

I find it ridiculous.  Even in my limited anime watching experience I can already name a couple of shows better than FMA:B, I imagine someone who has seen far more than I could do better than 2.

Forewarning. This is just the my off the cuff ramblings. Bullshitting because I am bored and it somewhat makes sense to me.   

**TL;DR: Wider range of viewers = wider range of tastes.**

The reason there are shows that are in drastically different slots ranking-wise could be because of how readily available anime is in Japan. 

It's their regular animated television over there unlike it is in the Western world. 

Kids as young as 1 all the way to adults old as 80 are subjected to it over there. That's a muuuch wider age range for possible anime viewers. Meaning muuuch more possibility to have different shows be more popular. Then that factors into female viewership as well. If this and other boards are any indicator, there are far more male viewers than female in the West. Think of how that would change if every girl in Japan was subject to seeing anime everytime they turned their television on. Anime is their animation. What all this means is 14-20 something males (just generalizing this figure) would be the average viewership instead of the dominate viewership. Giving a wider range of likes and dislikes. 

Lets say SOA viewers in Japan range from 5-14 (makes sense as you could think of it like TMNT and GI Joe's was for me or you as we were kids). The boys would watch it for the battles. BUT WAIT! It has a bunch of cuteness to it. So the girls who are subjected to watching tv in Japan would be watching it for it's cuteness and the romantic story. While over here in the West, the ones subjected to it would mostly be the 14-20 somethings who actively seek out anime. Mostly boys. Mostly people who are well aware of quality. 

As for Studio Deen Fate/Stay Night, it could simply be attributed to the Novel. Which the main story is Sabers. In which people would want to watch her stories over Rins. Which could account for more votes. 

I also think there may be a discrepancy between what Westerners and what Easterners decide is quality and there definitely is a big discrepancy between what we all consider is normal.

SAO better than Death Note and No Game No Life? Really people? Really?
>> ARTICLE
Well, apparently SAO is better than every anime, but 15.
>> ARTICLE
Surprised ef made the list. It's one of the series I rarely hear about. Same with its VN.
>> ARTICLE
It's a great watch if you're a fan of SHAFT, and though a little overly dramatic has a good story.
>> ARTICLE
I can't speak for the VN, but the anime is one series I heard a lot about before thinking of watching it. Perhaps not here on this subreddit, which tends to talk more about airing anime and some very, very few older titles, but EF is definitely not as underground as you would think, it does have its fair share of exposure in other communities (MAL and 4chan and MAL at least). 


>> ARTICLE
Gundam seed, the only gundam show on the list. Guilty Crown in the top 100. And SAO in top 20. 

As a fan of these shows, this is gonna make me cry. Happy new year to us. Cheers!
>> ARTICLE
I can live with SAO in the top 20, if it means K-On, madoka, NGE, and Steins Gate can be some of the most highly rated shows.
>> ARTICLE
Gun Samurai, that's the one I am watching next.
>> ARTICLE
I did ctrl+f to search for Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso//Your Lie in April. When I got no result for "shiga" I assumed the english term was used, so I searched for "Your".. and my jaw dropped. Then I searched for "april" and figured it was a typo in the post.

Still only #119 surprised me.
>> ARTICLE
Zetsuen no Tempest at 154. I could be happy with that.
>> ARTICLE
I guess the love for Steins;Gate is universal.
>> ARTICLE
In some ways their ranking are way better than ours (Monogatari, Madoka, Hyouka, NGE get much deserved boosts), but some are also way worse (SAO, guilty crown, Angel Beats, etc. a ton of this crap is just absurdly higher than it should be).
>> ARTICLE
Good taste
>> ARTICLE
I was scrolling down this list so nervous, hoping I didn't see Code Geass anywhere less than top 10. #1 and #3 lets fucking go, what a series.
>> ARTICLE
Hanasaku Iroha #25. Frigging nice, Japan! 
>> ARTICLE
Didn't expect to find Hyouka with the same rank as Madoka Magika, I thought it wasn't that well received in Japan. It makes me really happy though!
>> ARTICLE
I'm quite surprised that some of the selections on this list are significantly different than our MAL.

Hard to decide which list I think is better.
>> ARTICLE
I really love Code Geass, it is one of my favorite anime for sure, but I am still surprised it is tied for first place.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, didn't expect Guilty Crown on the top 100, Japan loves some robots.
>> ARTICLE
guilty crown was good in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Sword Art Online... 16... 
>> ARTICLE
SAO 16, FMA: B 30
>> ARTICLE
This isn't really a popular site. There is no equivalent to MAL/AP/AniDB in terms of number of users. Very few Japanese anime bother to use these kind of services compared to foreigners.
>> ARTICLE
Shit, there are way too many shows that deserve to be way higher up.

Rokka, Death Parade, Kill la Kill, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Chaika. So low. Why? Good anime. I liked.
>> ARTICLE
It hurts me that FMA:B isn't even in the top 10, but it kills me that K-ON is at 11th place, it was good and among my favorites in SoL, but this is ridiculous they left much better SoL below. Also SAO in 16th?
>> ARTICLE
K-on is my number one. Fight me.
>> ARTICLE
Woah. Toradora and Anohana are quite high. The Japanese obviously know their stuff :3
>> ARTICLE
[First season of oregairu is way higher that its second.](http://i.imgur.com/FbQLf7m.png) 

While I really liked the first season, I believe the second season is a big improvement as the first, for the most part, just makes an introduction to the characters.

Nevertheless, as a big fan of the show, first season's placement is quit higher compared to MAL so [way to go japan!](http://i.imgur.com/Me37Hkd.gif)

[(From animemaru's New Year's Resolutions Article; post-it on the right)](http://www.animemaru.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/New-years-resolutions-640x360.png)

I agree; I loved the second season, but it seems like a lot of people - at least on reddit - either thought it was bad because they think it's forced melodrama, or simply preferred the more lighthearted season 1.
>> ARTICLE
Huh. There's a few anime I'm surprised aren't on here. Would have expected One Punch Man and Fullmetal Alchemist Brootherhood to be a bit closer to the top. I haven't even watched Gate yet either. Guess I should check it out.
>> ARTICLE
> Would have expected One Punch Man and Fullmetal Alchemist Brootherhood to be a bit closer to the top.

Those are Western hyped shows.  Japan has vastly different tastes ;P
>> ARTICLE
Tasteless casuals.
>> ARTICLE
<*Japanese anime viewers looking at the MAL*>

"Tasteless pretentious monkeys who thinks they know us and our culture."
>> ARTICLE
The rankings are really odd on this site.
Some shows are too high or low in a way that makes little sense, as in, don't reflect the sales or the overall popularity the series had in Japan

On the other side Yuki Yuna is on Fall 2014's top 10, which is cool.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam SEED is #2 what
>> ARTICLE
Ha HxH 2011 is so low.Kinda surprised.Also Gintama is so high. FMAB is also low. LOGH  just 2 places from top 100.
Also SAO eh not suprised.
>> ARTICLE
Wow my 2 favourite anime are tied at 22 (Natsume + Nagi no Asukara)
>> ARTICLE
Wow, no Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal, no Detroit Metal City....oh man, NO Great Teacher Onizuka!...what is up with this list :/...it seems like its only major popular titles :/
>> ARTICLE
This is based on popularity, and not how good the anime actually is according to the Japanese, right?
>> ARTICLE
It's both combined. I don't have how the math works, but these are the overall score.
>> ARTICLE
>69 Tari Tari

I'm... very okay with it.
>> ARTICLE
To those who said another sucked rank 72 
The Japanese know their shit
>> ARTICLE
So I've never watched School Days because of all the hate I see it get in this subreddit but it's ranked pretty high? I'm starting to think maybe I should give it a go.

I wouldn't waste my time but you do you.

Was surprised Yosuga no Sora was ranked.

>22 	Natsumes Book of Friends 1st season  
  
Noice.

TIL my taste in anime greatly differs from the average Japanese.  
>> ARTICLE
Clannad: After Story is 7th in both tops ( this one and on MAL )

Isn't it funny ?
>> ARTICLE
Bleach, rank 366, has 366 episodes....that's actually really cool.
>> ARTICLE
Wow thats pretty interesting, Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day
being rank 8 alongside Clannad: After story. I was expecting them to be lower ranking!
>> ARTICLE
Here is a reminder Most Japanese don't use rating sites like the west and this site is not reliable, it also use the reaction from twitter and other sites to determine popularity so this not "what is the best" ranking you can go to site and see how people rated the Story/Visual/VA/Music/Character but still no reliable.

Sales are better way to determine Japanese taste also TV Rating if they are available. 

Edit: thinking about this have the opposite problem of MAL that Sequal gets rated higher here it gets rated lower lol.
>> ARTICLE
Something tells me Japan likes first seasons more no matter what. 
>> ARTICLE
This is so weird. But, considering that Gintama takes up about 5 spots of our top 10, this ranking also seems fine.
>> ARTICLE
Glad to see Haruhi and GITS at the top.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a little surprised SEED is the highest rated Gundam according to this list
>> ARTICLE
The highest rated gintama is only 32? As far as I've watched it's basically meant to watch for Japanese people, cosidering the amount of Japanese culture references, and MAL has 5 or more of them in the top 10? Weird.
>> ARTICLE
OMG Kaleido Star is ranked 74! Good taste Japan.

This will be the very first anime that I will introduce to my boy.
>> ARTICLE
Still not convinced Lelouch used his Geass to raise the level of R2 and convince Japan to eat Pizza Hutt
>> ARTICLE
HxH 1999 is rated higher than 2011...wtf Japan.

So glad baka and test is ranked high, it's hilarious.

i'm kinda shocked on how high rated School Days is in Japan...

I'm surprised Tari Tari is in top 100. Didn't think it was that popular of an anime. 
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see that they love the raildex series by having 3 of the in the Top 100 but where is Railgun S ?
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what to say about this list but honestly, from either an objective perspective or a subjective one I can't agree almost at all with this order. And I'm pretty sure when it comes to te sale numbers they don't match this data either. It's just weird :/

SAC is third? Good taste.

OreImo Second season in top 100... 

*Shudders*
>> ARTICLE
These rankings.. Damn. SAO #16, Angel Beats! #17. And even though i love K-on... Having it above animes like ToraDora, Attack On Titan, And FMA: (Brotherhood), seems a bit absurd.
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts:
Happy that *Cowboy Bebop*, *Evangelion* and *Madoka Magica* are so high, but I'm actually surprised they're not higher.
As stated already, why is *Spirited Away* so low?!
And why the heck is *Sword Art Online* so high? Am I the only who hated that show?
>> ARTICLE
It says AKIRA was released in 1998. Shouldn't it say 1988?

Surprising to see Eureka Seven that high. Almost never mentioned here.

God damn SAO ranked at 16? wtf japan you taking crazy pills?

Chihayafuru at 9? IS THERE HOPE FOR SEASON 3?

This is the choice of Steins;Gate!
>> ARTICLE
Wtf japan. 

We have better taste... r-right guys?
>> ARTICLE
At least Evangelion is kinda high up on the list unlike MAL's list. Also sword art ahead of Gurren Lagann makes me kinda butt hurt
>> ARTICLE
There's no way in hell Hunter x Hunter (2011) could be reasonably considered #600, do people really ignore it because "hurr hurr old version is better"? or maybe Hiatus x Hiatus ? 

However, it's refreshing to see some Ghibli titles not this recognized in the west like Castle in the Sky or Nausicaa in the top.
>> ARTICLE
Based on the scores it seems they use a 10 point scale instead of ratting everything at least a 7.
>> ARTICLE
the rating system is 1.0 - 5.0 across 5 categories: story, visuals, voice acting, music, characters. and the full rating is the average of these 5 scores

but the scores listed here aren't user ratings. they are combined scores calculated from both ratings and popularity
>> ARTICLE
At least Gintama is in the top 50.


>> ARTICLE
Hunter x Hunter is 600 WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK. Why would they think the 1999 version is better in any way? 
>> ARTICLE
[Give this a quick read, maybe it'll change your opinion.](https://twolongfourtwitlonger.wordpress.com/2014/12/21/hxh-99-hxh-2011-btw/)

Well their top 100 is slightly better than MAL.  But they still overrate horseshit like Naruto really badly.

This must be a joke, these rankings are shit. Everybody complain about MAL rankings, but they are godlike compare to those one.

**Usagi Drop**, the most heartwarming series of the year!
>> ARTICLE
While the show was good in it's own right (pretty much critic bait) it didn't really offer anything extraordinary. It was cute and heart warming but it didn't do anything outside the normal pseudo-parent relationship. Also the music was mediocre at best (IMO).
>> ARTICLE
While I agree it was probably top 3 for this year, I can't help but feel it was too short. (Although I completely disagree with the manga's ending so maybe it was a blessing.)

**Working`!!**

Aired: Fall

Studio: A-1 Pictures
>> ARTICLE
I think the secret to this show's appeal is less in its actual substance (light, occasionally funny SoL comedy) than in its execution. It kind of reminds me of K-On!! in that way. The second season especially was animated gorgeously and I thought shifting the focus slightly from Inami and Takanashi to the Satou/Kyouko/Todoroki triangle worked very much in its favor.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think working is even close to being the best. Yeah it was a pretty good comedy/romance, but it was so shallow compared to some of these other choices. It's one of those good casual/light-hearted series to watch.
>> ARTICLE
**Puella Magi MadokaMagica**

Producer: SHAFT  
Aired: Winter
>> ARTICLE
It was merely good imo, especially the overly pompous end that looked like a poor attempt to make an unforgettable masterpiece from a show that was only good.

EDIT: Really? How the hell could this overtake S;G!?
>> ARTICLE
this show was one of the best anime I have ever watched and I usually prefer slice of life/comedy stuff, I recommend it to a bunch of people.
>> ARTICLE
Madoka really is very cool. Very fine animation, music and style. Plot and characters reasonably good, some points being exceptional. It's close, but for me it beats Steins;Gate by a hair.
>> ARTICLE
*pedant mode activated*

I'd just like to point out that the official romanised version of the title is **Puella Magi Madoka Magica**. According to [#madoka](http://mibbit.com/#madoka@irc.rizon.net) the only reason that Mahou Shoujo was used in the CM was because they couldn't get a Japanese person who could reliably pronounce the Latin title. If you are referring to it in English you SHOULD NOT be using the Romaji form.
>> ARTICLE
BAM, edit'd. Thanks for the info.
>> ARTICLE
I love this show.  Got me back into anime after years of drought.

Why it gets my vote for anime of the year:

* The plot fit together like a puzzle.  I love that.

* I loved rewatching it almost as much as watching it the first time. Maybe even more.  Just watching episode 1 again after episode 10 was amazing, and the foreshadowing throughout the show was pretty ace.

* IMHO, the end fit the show very well.  At first glance, it looks like [a happy end](/spoiler), but it's actually quite [bittersweet (only one important thing being improved and sizable personal sacrifices having been made for that improvement), and Madoka made an extremely clever wish directly as a result of knowledge gleaned from living through the plot.] (/spoiler)

* I loved the characterization. The characters served the plot rather than the other way around, so some of it was a bit scarce (Mami, Kyouko to some extent), but...I love it when nearly every character has well-defined assets and real flaws [that can (and do) get them and other people around them killed](/spoiler).  Homura and Sayaka were particularly well-done.  And I just loved the characters for being themselves, in general.

* As a geek, I very much appreciated the easter eggs (i.e., the runes, the architecture, faustian graffiti, etc.)

* The atmosphere.  The music.  The witch barriers.

* Episode 10.  Just...episode 10.

I'm very much looking forward to those movies.

Sony in general seems to hate viral advertising. Unless there's actual fans/people out there flagging those videos for copyright.

They could have added a more "epic" ending, the amount of suspense deserved it.

Good anime, but I can't say it's something I won't forget in few more months.
>> ARTICLE
Very much seconded. I think it was in Feyris's episode where I realized what was happening. I had a much difficult time taking it seriously because of it
>> ARTICLE
Here's the thing about that part of it. 

That's actually what a lot of people wanted in Angel Beats!, the same basic concept. Personally I thought it worked well, in that you had a series of character build-ups then a series of character tear-downs in a way (but in a positive sense). Maybe the problem is going through the characters twice. 

Anyway, the real end of the story is probably The Decision in Ep. 22, everything after that is a bit of a downbeat, although there was some really good stuff in the last two episodes, Dat Slap, and the last 5-10 minutes of the last episode, with the pins. 

It just happens that Ep. 22 was so good that everything else is muted. 
>> ARTICLE
To me the climax was in ep 23 when [Okabe got the video message from his future self telling him how to save Kurisu.](/spoiler) At that point we knew how the show was going to end and all the important parts were over. ep24 was just execution of things we already knew about.

Episode 23 was fucking epic. Espcially when [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEwxaGFLnTI) started playing in the background. That was my favourite scene in the whole anime.

Skipping the first 1/3 of the show that sucked hard, it was good, ending was unexpected but not quite exceptional, overall a mediocre show for my tastes.
>> ARTICLE
Smartest series by far of the year. You have to go back and watch each episode like 5 times before you can understand all that is hidden in each episode(still didn't get everything until I went on tvtropes). Also, the ending felt appropriate with the overall theme of the anime and was finalizing, not just some ending thrown together because the animation studio didn't have the money to continue the series as is the case with most.

Since we were asked to not downvote posts I'll just laugh downvotes in the face and say that I absolutely hated that show.

Mysteries were either impossible to solve for the viewer or incredibly easy, plot was bad and the characters were terrible, especially after you can no longer help but notice that it's not Victorica who is smart but rather other characters who are stupid. And figuring out who the culprit is because [Kujou daydreamed about a blonde](/spoiler)? Oh come on, there is a limit to how much stupidity you can fit in a single show.

The big beef against the series is that it was constructed as an ongoing series but it's not. Because of this there was no real ending as most 12/24 episode series has.

i see why :( what a waste of a good storyline.
>> ARTICLE
Lol. From what I was told by an anime loving friend of mine, the Usagi Drop manga does a 180' and turns into a romance heavy dealy-o.

While I think thats kind of cute in it's own right, I'd just see the manga/anime as two separate entities if I were you. The main story is endearing and sweet, but it ends up turning into a "thing". I skipped ahead to spoil myself some before, and while I think loli love is cool in manga- I didn't like that the main fella (Forget his name) basically becomes his grandfather in essence. At least, that was the implication of how it was going.


>> ARTICLE
I think thats what I gotta do. I just really fell for the characters in the anime. It will be hard not to get annoyed with things in the manga. But I do want to know what happens in the end!

Roll with it and like I said, just try to think of them as separate stories. I dropped it, didn't have time read all that just to be annoyed but let me know if it turns out okay.

The only one off the top of my head is [Papakiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11179/Papa_no_Iukoto_wo_Kikinasai!) which is where an uncle takes in three nieces after their parents go missing, some sweet moments, nothing to write home about.

As /u/leathalcrow suggested the movie [wolf children](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12355) is a much better and more memorable example of parenting in anime, worth looking up.
>> ARTICLE
Came here to recommend Papakiki myself, as I really enjoyed it.
>> ARTICLE
It was sweet but the spin-off manga's were better, still hope for more and a conclusion though.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't the manga considerably more ecchi though?

I think the series was all around pretty decent, it would have been a lot better if it gave the characters a little more room to reach out of their tropes though. That and there is only so much Twinkle Twinkle Little Star one man can take in one sitting.

Still was pretty good though.
>> ARTICLE
The main manga is pretty much on par with the series in terms of ecchi, otherwise it depends on the spin-off, the most popular(unsurprisingly) one based of the social research club is massively ecchi(to-loveru levels not darkness) but very fun to read, the two older sisters ones are less so if I remember. My favourite for the adorableness was the youngest sister's story within day-care.

I will say this does illustrate the recency bias people have. Statistically speaking, what are the odds that the last two seasons have produced 3 of the Top 10? Even when you consider that most people don't watch anime older than 10 years old, unless it's a classic (NGE, Bebop, Utena, GitS, original Gundam for example) this does seem pretty skewed. 

In my experience, it might be because people have a tendency to rate airing anime against each other, rather than against their whole list. I know I've had to adjust scores after considering my own tendency to do this. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call 00 "original Gundam".  While it's definitely no G Reco or Iron Blooded Orphans, it's not as old as Zeta or anything that age.  Most of the alternate era series have a similar feel to em, like 00, Seed, and current stuff, than the original Universal Century stuff does. 
>> ARTICLE
On the contrary, I'd argue that it's because the popularity of anime makes it so that recent shows get bigger budgets.  The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

There's also the matter that recent shows are likely to be more in line with the tastes of a modern viewer.

These, and various other reasons, are why recent shows tend to get better reviews than older ones.
>> ARTICLE
>The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

The voice acting and music are as good as they've always been, or at least since late 80s. As for the art, I think that in 2005-2008 the studios have mastered digital production and can produce steady high quality animation unless they rush things or cut the budget.

>> ARTICLE
Good points, though I'd argue that English dubs are still improving and have still got a long way to go compared to Japanese VAs.

OSTs have been getting better though - if only because the budgets are bigger.
>> ARTICLE
I think the recency bias has more to it than people just snubbing older series though

1) Older series are just harder to come by on the streaming services. Even if they are on there, you have to really dig through all the recent series to get there. Streaming services tend to push their Simulcasts to justify their licensing expenses

2) Anime crowd skews young. People watch anime of their age before earlier ones. I watched anime from 1995-1999. It wasn't until 2011 that I caught up to things from the 80s and 70s (though I did watch Mazinger-Z and Voltes V in the 90s). 

3) People who HAVE seen those might have moved on to something else in their life, and thus are never really around to mention it enough in today's anime communities, because while they were good, there just wasn't *enough* about them to talk about for 10-20 years. *Pivotal* series like NGE and Cowboy Bebop have been talked about and dissected for so long, particularly in the West, they're just ingrained in the community's collective memory. 

Other series just don't have the same staying power, unless they're a genre defining series. 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu? Meanwhile, how many people will still be talking about Madoka, K-On, Monogatari, and JoJo? Now think about how many Shirobakos, Syokugekis, and Shigatsus there have been in the 20 years since 1995, and have since been forgotten. That contributes *immensely* to recency bias. 
>> ARTICLE
> 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu?

Not sure about Syokugeki, but the other two yes absolutely. Shigatsu will at least have the staying power of Anohana (5 years) or Angel Beats! (6 years).

>> ARTICLE
But of course you, with your omnipotent, perfectly refined taste, would never do such a thing. /s 

Elitism much? 
>> ARTICLE
No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale. I've seen /u/JexInfinite 's opinion parroted many times in this subreddit, no idea where you're getting the "elitism" claim from.
>> ARTICLE
> No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale.

Its not just people. The entire rating industry had moved toward a 6/7-10 rating scale. 6 these days means terrible, 7 average, 8 good, 9 great, 10 fantastic.

Its just normal. You looking at almost all game or movie ratings, they conform to the warped rating scale. Its just how it is. I think it ultimately came from the academic grading system, where a 50% is a fail, so anything under 5/10 is meaningless.

There is really no point complaining about people using the most common system of rating. 
>> ARTICLE
I vote on a binary "Did I enjoy it or not?" scale.  either an anime gets a 10 or a 1.  
>> ARTICLE
Those people typically are the people less experienced in anime tend to gravitate heavily towards the popular or new shows and slap high numbers on everything because they haven't seen much else and it's all unique and new

This is probably seen in practice by me personally with Gundam 00 vs. Code Geass. Both very similar in quality and plot from the same age, from the same studio. I enjoyed Gundam a lot more but they're two shows in practice which I would see having almost the same score if they were equally popular

But most of the people who've seen 10 shows and given 10 to all of them have seen Code Geass due to popularity and being recommended everywhere. Most of these haven't watched or heard much of Gundam so it has a far fairer score
>> ARTICLE
I've heard of gundam all my life, but it was only after I came to /r/anime that I first heard of Code Geass - so if anything, I'd argue that the bias would go the other way.

Still, as you say, I honestly still don't see what's so good about Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
And this is why I don't rate my list at all :\

I think that's more a result of people not watching anime they know are going to be trash. If something doesn't warrant even a 5 from the people who've already watched it, it's hardly going to garner much viewership from everyone else.
>> ARTICLE
I rate everything I watch a 10, so I'm part of the problem.
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of snobby edgelords on this sub who think you're a scrub if you have an average score over 6. Pay them no mind. If you like something, score it whatever the hell you want. 

Just keep in mind how good you think it is compared to ALL the shows you've seen, not just the recent ones. 
>> ARTICLE
Average score means nothing if you don't know what shows they rate. Some people only watch good shows. You're suggesting that scores be on a bell curve, but I deny this. If a show is good, it is good. The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.
>> ARTICLE
I rate on a bell curve, but the curve is centred around 7.5. Most shows on my list is rated 7 or 8. I simply try to avoid shows if before watching I feel that there's no chance for me to rate the show 8. Life is too short to watch mediocre anime (or read mediocre books, or watch mediocre movies, or play mediocre games), so I don't even bother.
>> ARTICLE
My MAL graph just coincidentally happens to be somewhat resembling of a bell curve, but I would never intentionally adjust the score to fit with everything else. I look at each individual show/movie as its own thing when rating.
>> ARTICLE
> The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.

This is why I kept my "10" rating for Attack on Titan even after seeing much better shows. I just love it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it does, the point of 10 point systems is for it to be relative to other entries 
>> ARTICLE
> Some people only watch good shows.

Yeah, this is sort of the justification I give for rating 10 across the board. I pick what I watch very carefully so that I know I'll enjoy whatever I invest my time in.
>> ARTICLE
So, you've either seen up to 15 shows, or are really generous with scores.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I'm just easy to please. Then again, I've seen no more then 60 shows so I haven't consumed anywhere near as much as material as the average MAL user.
>> ARTICLE
yes, this. Plus from what I've seen from over 20 years of watching, anime *has* gotten better. It'd be dumb to normalize your score to the "average" anime when that average keeps going up every year. 

Instead, I normalize mine to the status quo of being bored. If an anime entertains me even a little bit, it gets a 6. If it makes me feel like I wasted my time, it gets 4 or below. I rarely finish shows that are 5 or below. 

PLUS, people by and large operate based off of recommendations. Essentially normalizing to the average *of what you've seen* is just grading how accurate people's recommendations were to you, which is counter to the spirit of ratings. 

Grading on a bell curve will make sense *only* if you select your anime to watch randomly.
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is a fantastic show because of how it did something completely new. It created several character archetypes which didn't previously exist. Just because those archetypes are now overused and everywhere, it doesn't diminish the value of how they originally affected the industry.

Akira is another example of something that was ahead of its time, but isn't necessary up to today's standard of quality. (I would argue that it absolutely is, but that's beside the point.)
>> ARTICLE
Technically, NGE didn't create archetypes, it just morphed them slightly and made tsundere/kuudere (Asuka vs Rei) more popular. 
>> ARTICLE
Less popular shows get less views, which means less ratings, which means less popularity. It's a loop.

Then there are people like me who just don't have time to watch terrible shows and just stick with what're regarded as "good" shows. What happens then is that my ratings get inflated because I don't watch enough bad shows.

If it's any help, I specifically waited for the season to end before binging it and still enjoyed it.

Up to you, though.
>> ARTICLE
I will  get to it after I finish my plan-to-watch list
>> ARTICLE
So, never?
>> ARTICLE
Soon (tm), this subreddit filled my quota for explosions for a life-time.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly there are a lot of better anime to watch out there, no need to prioritize it. I really only watched it because it was currently airing and kind of fun. Rakguo and maybe Erased are the only real must watches of the season.
>> ARTICLE
If you're anything like the typical /r/anime user, it should only take you a few years.

You got me. [Probably a decade even.](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/enc0re?status=6&tag=)

Oh hey... Tons better than [mine](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/VincentBlack96?status=6&tag=) (which I just added HHD to)

I don't usually comment on planned lists, but yours has a lot of high quality movies. Might consider watching a movie every once in a while.
>> ARTICLE
That's not that bad. I have 178 on mine, and I'm pretty sure I've seen someone with 300+ on theirs.

Well Konosuba is actually pretty funny imo it does a great job on being silly parody, I would recommend if you havn't seen it.

Wups. Figured I'd miss something. Thanks!

So what you're saying is... Humanity hasn't declined enough?

Not declined enough but beyond saving, Watashi deserves better. I, for one, welcome our new fairy overlords.

Haven't watched it but it is sitting on a 7.9 on MAL, so I'm not sure it's gonna climb anywhere near top 100 anytime soon

i rated it a 10 last week so it's one step closer to the top 100

Zetsuen no Tempest was fantastic, I would recommend if you've ever heard of it. Don't be fooled by the lame description it has.

What's wrong with Unlimited Blade Works? It has a score of 8.46 and 25 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I'm assuming it got lumped in with Fate/Stay Deen? The construction of this list is partially arbitrary.
>> ARTICLE
The prologue for it is an hour, which puts it at 27 episodes time wise (which has been done for other shows as well).  All of fate is kiiiiinda intertwined but not really. It's in a bit of a weird spot.

That seems like an odd distinction to make. But whatever, you're the OP I guess

OP plz

Rakugo in the Top 10. NICE. 
>> ARTICLE
Well deserved too
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it, but it's probably a lot more deserving than Erased and OPM.
>> ARTICLE
It's the only one out of those three that could be in a realistic anime top 100, so yes it's worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Much more than Erased for sure (I enjoyed it, but it's ranking is way inflated right now). Also get on that!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this is why MAL makes me sad. You have Gundam 00 but no 08th MS team nor war in the pocket nor unicorn!? 

And only about 6 or 7 shows before 2000 on the list. To be fair older shows do tend to be longer, however there are plenty of shows before 2000 below 26 episodes that arebetter than the likes of gate and no game no life (which is inexplicably at no. 22).

Also the fact that Gunbuster isn't on the list is really sad, that show has probably the best ending of all time (I cry every time the colour hits in!)

Well atleast ping pong, tatami galaxy, and rainbow are high up.
>> ARTICLE
I could think of a bunch of anime that if they came out in the last year would be much higher on this list. Outlaw star, The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, and GTO arn't even on here. Explain that. 08th ms team and pocket are two anime classics probably best in the entire Gundam universe. Im sure im leaving a bunch of quality anime from the 90s and 80s that are 10x better than some of the shows on this list.

>> ARTICLE
Jesus! Those three aren't on the list? I just assumed they were when I scanned it! See this is why I don't trust people...
>> ARTICLE
GTO is 43 episodes and currently ranked 28th on MAL.

>> ARTICLE
yeah I was mistaken on that, I edited it out and replaced it. Such a good anime thought it was much shorter than that.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't diebuster the sequel to gunbuster?
>> ARTICLE
Why is that relevant? 
>> ARTICLE
I misremembered the number of episodes in each series. I, for some reason, was under the impression that they were both longer, and adding them together would push it above 25
>> ARTICLE
Yes and no.  Same universe different characters. 
>> ARTICLE
> Wow, this is why MAL makes me sad. You have Gundam 00 but no 08th MS team nor war in the pocket nor unicorn!? 

Could be worse.

*stares at every Animebracket contest from /r/anime where Gundam keeps getting snubbed again and again*
>> ARTICLE
Unicorn is rated way higher than 00 and 08th MS Team is pretty close, they just aren't on this list due to OP's weird-ass criteria. They both fit easily into less than 2 cours, he probably just doesn't know exactly how entries of UC Gundam relate to each other and considers it a continuous story, so he only included AUs when making this.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam 00 needs to be removed from this list as it has 2 seasons of 2 cours each.

Though Build Fighters and Build Fighters Try might exploit the rule 2 loophole tho...
>> ARTICLE
I think Kill la Kill deserves better than 58^th.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill. Huh, I must have missed Gurren Lagann....

*re-reads three times*

He hasn't watched Gurren Lagann.  
>> ARTICLE
And I think Sakurasou should not be on that list at all. But what can you do with essentially a popularity list.
>> ARTICLE
how is kill la kill not better than zankyou no terror man... 

[](#torrentialdownpour)
>> ARTICLE
I still don't get how there's such a gap between Gurren Lagann and KLK on MAL....
>> ARTICLE
KLK only has boobs

Gurrenn Lagann has boobs AND giant robots.

Also I have to feel that an adolescent male protagonist is more relatable to the target audience of both series than a snarky female. 
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill has a *lot* of boobs, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's also part of the Gainax bias...though I agree Gurren Lagann was better crafted & planned out story-wise, Kill La Kill was more enjoyable and the ending=far less a base-breaker with the fans.
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of relative quality, you can't deny that Gurren Lagann is much more approachable to a wide audience than KLK. I feel like that has to be part of it. I also feel that Gurren Lagann was just plain better, for action, themes, and characters. (This isn't an insult to Kill La Kill. I *love* Kill La Kill)
>> ARTICLE
No Outlaw star, Gundam 08th MS team, Gundam war in the pocket,  The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, Gurren Lagann, and Gunbuster all missing from this list. It is funny how skewed toward recency MAL ratings are. 
>> ARTICLE
1) Recent anime are more easily available from streaming services

2) Anime crowd tends to skew young. A lot of people who watched anime, don't anymore

3) hardly anyone mentions those series anymore

There are not many people who would have seen those things you list, and if they have, they probably won't be on MAL now.

People aren't just thumbing their nose at older anime. It's more likely people just don't know about it
>> ARTICLE
Yea I know they arent thumbing there nose, but it is such a shame since there are so many good anime from not that long ago. Movies dont seem to have these issues though on IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes(for the reasons you listed I guess).
>> ARTICLE
well, it's a lot easier to obtain old movies legally than it is to obtain old anime too. Older anime are basically a niche within a niche at this point, and a lot of their distribution rights are held by IP trolls. A better comparison is non-American movies (or movies whose market was never intended to be the American public), and there is absolutely a parallel recency bias there.
>> ARTICLE
Madness, someone else who's watched Captain Tylor?!
>> ARTICLE
Seems there are so few of us these days. One of the funniest anime ever made. 
>> ARTICLE
TTGL didn't make it because it's 27 episodes. OP just couldn't bring themselves to make an exception I guess.

;_;
>> ARTICLE
Yea thats a mistake imo since it is only 27 if you count an episode that isnt really an episode(recap).
>> ARTICLE
The real crime is FLCL at 92
>> ARTICLE
Why is One Punch Man so popular? It wasn't that amazingly mind blowing...
>> ARTICLE
recency and hype bias. Just like Erased and Rakugo. Both great shows, but not top 10 material
>> ARTICLE
Did you like Konosuba?
>> ARTICLE
I loved konosuba lol The comedy in that show was some of the best I've seen, although I havn't seen that many comedy shows. I honestly found it way more enjoyable than One Punch in my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Both of them are parody shows with stupid yet funny comedy. But I think opm was better overall. Better story, better comedy and better characters. The only good character that came out of konosuba was Kazuma imo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its different for everyone. I just thought the gags/silliness was a lot funnier in konosuba 
>> ARTICLE
OPM has top notch fight scenes with amazing fight direction, an awesome soundtrack, interesting characters, some shounen subversion elements, and most of the comedy was on point. It has almost everything you could want from a light-hearted action series. That's all some people want in a show, so to them it's perfect.
>> ARTICLE
New "twist" on the regular superhero story, cool and likable side characters, competent pacing, interesting setting, great animation & art, good soundtrack, and many people found the comedy to be pretty funny.

It was also a show that I'd say got better as it went along. It started out kinda cool but got more interesting with the Hero Association, got more intense with the Sea King arc, and the Boros fight was the best part of the show and a great finale. I can see why a majority of people would enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty enjoyable myself. I just don't see why people give it a 10/10 when the show barely had any story. My friend gave OPM a 10/10 yet FMA Brotherhood an 8... I just don't understand how its a master piece with such a high rating  lol
>> ARTICLE
Seems you're focusing on a pointless rating system.
>> ARTICLE
Well its not really that, its just people calling it a masterpiece like its the greatest thing is what I don't understand. It was good but nothing that made me say damn that was so amazing greatest thing I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
That's precisely my point. You're focused on a show rated at a 10 being objectively better than an 8, which really couldn't be further from the truth. The entire rating system is a shitshow precisely because people reduce extremely subjective shows to an extremely objective method of comparing them, and completely ignore what makes them unique.

As far as this specific example, I can see why someone would enjoy OPM so much. Its short, sweet, and just a lot of fun. No fat on the story. good visuals. most importantly, its fun, light entertainment. Its not one of my favourite shows, but I can see why someone enjoys it so much.
>> ARTICLE
FMA is quite a bit different than OPM. It's quite a bit more serious (at most points) and can certainly take on a darker tone in some parts. It's also not trying to be subversive. It's a straight up shounen that takes itself more serious than most and with a much more focused narrative. For some people this makes FMA better, for others it's not as much what they're looking for.
>> ARTICLE
Ratings are subjective and a lot of people just enjoyed the show. I don't think there really needs to be much more than that. IMO not having a big in-depth story isn't an issue if it is still one of the most enjoyable shows I've watched. At the end of the day it just comes down to how people rate things and the easiest way to rate something is by how much you enjoyed watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Rating on enjoyment is so much more subjective than rating the actual show (eg characters, plot, themes, soundtrack, animation).
>> ARTICLE
Obviously, but every rating is going to be subjective anyways. In addition you could have the most well written characters and the best objective quality story in existence, but people may not enjoy it. Personally I find just as much value in a review based purely on how much someone enjoyed something as a review that is trying to be objective. At the end of the day I don't care how good something is if I don't enjoy it, and I don't care how bad something is if I do enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I find reviews based on enjoyment to be utterly useless. I can never experience that enjoyment the same way, if at all. What I *can* experience is the characters, plot, soundtrack, etc. Rating and reviewing based on things that are actually in the show rather than how a show made you feel is a lot more logical, and produces scores that have meaning.
>> ARTICLE
But like I said even those things are subjective. Where I see a good character another may see an insufferable twat. Everyone has differing tastes in music, so a soundtrack may be good but still may not be anything you would enjoy. I would think rating the plot would be the easiest to do "objectively", but even then it is usually going to be based on prior experience. When you've watched/read hundreds of shows/books it will be a lot harder to find an original plot that stands out, but for someone without much experience an average or mediocre plot may be amazing.

IMO no review by some random person online is very helpful regardless of the criteria used. A review only becomes truly helpful once you've begun to understand the context the reviewer is looking at the work through. If you have totally different opinions on what constitutes a good character, or anything else, then a reviewer saying that a character is great means nothing to you. Until I understand a reviewer I take their reviews with a huge grain of salt.
>> ARTICLE
Subjective, obviously, but other people are able to witness and experience them. *Nobody* else can experience how the show made you feel, so it's a useless point.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody can tell me for certain how I'm going to feel, but a ton of people can make accurate predictions based on how they felt. If a lot of people think something is sad/funny/enjoyable then I will most likely have the same experience. The whole basis of an averaged score on a site like MAL is that most people will fall in line with the average. If something is rated a 7, regardless of the reasons but as long as those people were as honest as possible, the majority of people will like it but not love it. Maybe you have some particular tastes, but then you can just find a reviewer with tastes more similar to your own. Like on Steam there are curators or, I imagine, the clubs on MAL.

To get back to the original topic of OPM being highly rated, I don't think most people care about an in-depth story. Most people can find plenty of enjoyment in a lacking product, and OPM is executed extremely well in all other aspects. In addition it isn't like it has a bad story - it simply has very little story which I see no problem with. I mean it works for Dark Souls right?
>> ARTICLE
Does your friend rate on personal enjoyment?
>> ARTICLE
Quite clearly, he would. If OPM is higher, it could only be because he enjoyed it more.
>> ARTICLE
When I asked him he just said FMA was "alright" lol
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like it wasn't for him.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm well I think you have to look at it differently. One Punch Man is trying to accomplish different things than FMA. How well does each accomplish what they set out to do? Personally I think OPM does a better job even if FMA has a more ambitious story. More story doesn't automatically make something superior. There are many other aspects to consider. 
>> ARTICLE
The amount of story it had was perfect for the atmosphere the show was trying to create. Not every show has to have super in-depth character backgrounds to be a masterpiece. Dragging out the story would've slowed down the show too much to keep it interesting imo.

At the end of the day it was a really fun show with great music, visuals, comedic timing, and amazing fight scenes. What more do you need?
>> ARTICLE
There was no goal from what I remember with the show? It was just this monster showed up, he goes to fight it. Again I still enjoyed the show I just feel like its way over hyped imo 
>> ARTICLE
IMO part of what makes the show interesting is that the villains are the ones trying to achieve some goal (and get all the power up sequences and other tropey things) instead of Saitama. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably because of the hype. I really like OPM, but I don't think it was a masterpiece as a lot of people claim, the anime was really good and had nice animation, but the best part of the story is still in the webcomics in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind
>> ARTICLE
It's almost like people can have their own opinions and whatnot.
>> ARTICLE
While I can't say I'd give OPM anything above 9 I can easily see why FMA:B would get 8. It's somewhat too long for the story it's telling and has its share of shonen tropes. They're not bad per se, but it's not the masterpiece of deep writing as well.
>> ARTICLE
For me random comedy scenes killed FMA and also Brotherhood . OPM was solid and honestly fun story not the best but worth watching .

Also I think that about  half of shows on this list are overhyped but my it's just my opinion . Maybe it's becouse I like SoL , Drama and Fantasy stories more
>> ARTICLE
eh, the random comedy scenes brought FMA down to earth for me. It's just that FMA had less of those than FMA:B because of the shorter run...
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind

A show doesn't need to have a story if it's not necessary. In OPM having a continuous narrative wasn't necessary since it was a gag comedy.
>> ARTICLE
that would all good if it was actually funny.  Unfortunately it was all too happy making the same joke over and over.
>> ARTICLE
OPM didn't literally have only one single joke. Yes it had the overlying "one punch" gag but it was used in many different ways, sometimes as a joke and sometimes for a serious moment. Overall the show also had a variety of comedy moments that didn't center around Saitama's gag.
>> ARTICLE
ok, list some examples of other kind of gags.  Maybe I'm missing something, but almost all the gags are just people/villains looking down on the MC, who beats the villain effortlessly.  
>> ARTICLE
[OPM spoilers](/s "In the episode where Saitama and Genos were infiltrating the evil doctors lair, he set traps on every floor in preparation for their arrival. Instead of following the standard "clear the dungeon to the boss" trope Genos just instantly blows up the entire building and they enter the basement from there. This was funny because the viewer wouldn't expect this and it subverts the trope.")

[OPM spoilers](/s "After the "robotic monkey" is defeated he is acting like a hardened badass minion and gives the whole "you'll never defeat X" speech. Once he learns that they were actually defeated he drops the robotic voice and takes on a whole different persona asking to be spared. He says that the robotic voice and attitude was him just trying to sound cool. This is funny because it was unexpected at the time and surprises the viewer.")

I could keep going and pull out every single one liner from every single episode that either got a chuckle or an outloud laugh from me but I think you see the point. Every episode didn't have 20 minutes of nothing happening until one single joke about a single punch was pulled at the end. The episodes were lined with small to larger jokes derived from the characters speeches, interactions among each other, and actions in the world they were in which all worked together and created the overall comedic tone/atmosphere of the show.
>> ARTICLE
that's just another variation of the same "Saitama is too powerful" gag, the other being an example of "villains acting all arrogant until they are put in their place by Saitama, who is too powerful" gag
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling you don't really want to be proven wrong. 

Look at his first example, how does that fall under the "single gag" at all? Second example, doesn't fall under the "single gag" either.

These examples are pretty far from the "saitama too strong" gag, so unless you are unfamiliar with the references, its likely pretty clear to most that this isn't a single gag show
>> ARTICLE
And as a variation they're different, they're unique with the characters interacting in different ways which isn't boring or uninteresting for the viewer. 
>> ARTICLE
[Saitama's impatience when it comes to monologuing](http://40.media.tumblr.com/7d6f2f56643914b392c1d249aa7f8ea5/tumblr_nwpsrfFOUb1u77epio1_500.jpg), and his [lackadaisical attitude](http://i.imgur.com/zdAJyD1.jpg) are two examples of gags in the show that isn't just the one punch gag. Genos constantly getting turned to modern art, the weird backstories for each villain, the strange character designs for each villain (I mean fucking look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/JJzfkFL.png) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/5qG4z0B.jpg)), [or even just the absurdity of certain situations in the show.](http://gfycat.com/PoshHelpfulIberianbarbel)

On the whole, the comedic situations he's placed in make [Saitama a](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/3wwk6k/anime_irl/?) [very](http://i.imgur.com/8GtTdCl.jpg) [relatable character](https://i.imgur.com/ixk3nTm.jpg) with the added bonus of just being hilarious in general. This is why I can't quite understand why people say the show only has the One Punch gag, it's a comedy with a varied arsenal of jokes to tell, yet for some reason people just say "LEL ONE GAG MAN".
>> ARTICLE
> monologuing

That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.  

>lackadaisical attitude

If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too.  What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.


> modern art

don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

> LEL ONE GAG MAN

personally, I would go with One Punchline Man
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why I tried to give examples, you're actively trying to not have fun with the anime, and that's why the comedy doesn't work with you.

>That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.

Not with most other characters in any fictional media. Most would listen to the long backstory without saying a word, so no, I wouldn't quite say it's a "natural reaction".

>If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too. What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.

Again, the point is that this is abnormal for a main character of a show. Does Superman act like that? No. To give a currently airing show as an example, does All-Mighty act like that? No. These are the characters Saitama is parodying because they're so common, and his character type as MC is so uncommon. See, this is what I mean by the fact that you're actively fighting against this anime tooth and nail in order to not have fun with it. Everyone else sees Saitama as unique and funny, yet you're sitting over here trying to jump through mental hoops to see him as this normal character that is totally obvious to write as the MC of a superhero show.

>don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

"Oh my god, they killed Kenny!" ~ Line from a TV show that made millions laugh all around the world.

You don't even bother acknowledging anything else I mentioned, so what was the point in responding?
>> ARTICLE
tbh, the fact that it was nothing but a gag comedy for the first 5 episodes made me question where the hype is coming from. I mean yeah, it was hilarious, but it was the anime equivalent of Chocolate Mint flavor ice cream: you don't get it too often, it's pretty good, but ultimately nothing to be excited about.

The last 7 episodes though, made me think "oh, this was what manga readers were hyping it up for"

Still though, I have to think a fair bit of that was casual anime-only people just parroting the manga hype. 
>> ARTICLE
Seconded. I personally think that OPM stands out from the current arc being covered by the manga 'til the end of that arc in the webcomic. [OPM end of latest finished webcomic arc spoilers](/s "Sweet Mask obsessing over Saitama's power after thrashing Garou gave me chills. That, and whenever he shows up with his High Rank Harem.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think most people claim it as a masterpiece, it was just a really fun show with a good "hype" factor.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe not in anime communities, but people who don't watch much anime tend to overhype it a lot (look at its IMDB rating).
>> ARTICLE
it's because it's the "not anime anime". People who saw DBZ and thought it was dumb come to this and say "OH MY GOD, IT'S SO AMAZING".

I'm not sure I would have NGE on this list since EoE is more or less required watching.

For me it was hard to convince myself to watch it, but when I did, I loved it.  It was a pretty weird experience, that's never happened to me before, but I would definitely recommend watching it.

But what about the culture aspect of the show? Because i dont know jack about the stage comedy storytelling aspect of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Mmm honestly it doesn't really matter. All the stories are self contained, so if there is additional backstory to it, it's not really necessary.  The important parts of the show are generally not the actual performances, and that's where the gold is. The stories are good, but the characters make it great.

this is nice because sometimes you dont want to invest yourself in a longer series. although something like bakemonogatari can be seen as a standalone series, it is better to plow through the whole series

Anohana was amazing ;_; made meh cri

And although S;G is one of my face series, can it be counted as 26 or less episodes of you count OVAs and films? If so then that will surely change with the new series that I believe is coming out? Or is that just a fan dream

I can't believe Haibane Renmei is ranked 83rd...

Serial Experiments Lain and Lupin III: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine are outstanding, I'm shocked that they both have just under an 8.0 rating.

Honestly i would prefer MyAnimeList like this, no hate to Gintama but it's pretty annoying when half of the top 10 spots are one series
>> ARTICLE
I like that my favourite series end up jumping up 5 slots suddenly :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm still a bit confused as to why people prefer to check MAL to see show ratings, I've always used anime news network and it seems so much better for that purpose. 
>> ARTICLE
Isn't hard to understand, people like me use it cause I'm not involved 100% in the anime world and don't wanna be involved that much either, just what I need.


 I don't wanna waste a week watching an anime that won't worth it, instead I watch the reviews from MAL, score and make my conclusions from that. And it worked pretty good for me, I've been watching some animes and the only one that I didn't like it from the ones I choose was Kokoro Connect, dropped after the second episode and has a good score on MAL.
>> ARTICLE
ANN lacks the social media personalizations that MAL has since it's a much older site. The rating system is absolutely better, and their sideways bar graph avoids the horrid "0 or 10" voting that tends to happen on MAL. All scores matter and contribute to the overall shape of the graph.

Example of graph: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13858

Slight bulge at 0, but still it is an overall good estimate of what people feel about the show rather than just 0s and 10s you'd see on something like MAL or IMDB. You also get to see the percentage who saw it dubbed/subbed, so you can tell that most of the 0 votes were by people who watched it as it aired (subbed) and got carried away by the disappointment train. Dubbed votes are, in general, much higher.
>> ARTICLE
That's why I dislike rotten tomatoes, they essentially force that. If I understand it correctly, they just divide reviews into two groups, above 5/50 and below 5/50 and give it a percentage score based on that. 

If every review was a 4.5, it would get a 0%-rotten, but if every review was a 5.5,it would get a 100%-fresh.
>> ARTICLE
Rotten tomatoes also gives an average rating.
>> ARTICLE
i don't understand what you mean, MAL has that "sideways bar graph" too.

And for those curious, here's a quick list of the series with something in MAL's original Top 100 that didn't make this one:

* Aria | 8.29
* Kara no Kyoukai | 8.24
* Psycho Pass | 8.23
* Evangelion Rebuilds | 8.19
* Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)

Bonus: It's like 85% the same as /u/icedino's, but how many of these 100 have you seen?

I got 65/100 of them.
>> ARTICLE
26/100

Not bad.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I only have 8/100 but the plus side is I have tons of good stuff to look forward too.
>> ARTICLE
got 39/100 I guess it's ok.
>> ARTICLE
I got 78/100

I'm missing a lot of the older ones...
>> ARTICLE
30/100. 34/105 if I can include those extra 5.

I think I've watched about half as many shows as you, by a very quick scan of your MAL, so I guess that's about right?
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't Attack on Titan OVAs (#52) be tied to the main series (#32) or am I missing something?

Also, 73/100 if I counted well, which would be 2 less than last time, but at least there's no Detective Conan in the way. :P
>> ARTICLE
I mentioned this in the OP, but they're labelled as a spin-off. Have you seen them? Are they not a spin-off? Because I'll remove it if that's the case.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I haven't seen the main series either, so I don't know. I understood about HxH and Fate, but I can't say anything about Attack on Titan, and I didn't know the TTGL movies were unrelated, I haven't watched those either. Can you really watch them without having seen their respective main series without missing anything? Either way, I would think the main series' popularity would carry a lot of weight on their score.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen the TTGL movies either but they were labeled as alternative versions so assumedly you could. 

These kind of things are usually better if you've seen the main series (and I'm sure the scores get a boost because of that) but if they're gonna be labelled as alternatives and spin-offs they *should* be watchable by themselves. Hopefully someone whose seen them can confirm or deny that.
>> ARTICLE
One of them is a alternative ending so it wouldn't make much sense if you didn't see the whole story first.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the first one start the story from the beginning, then lead into the 2nd one, which has the alternative ending?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think they're a spin-off. They're prequels to the show and I've heard a few manga readers say that they're required for the second season.
>> ARTICLE
Just one of them really, rest are world building/character background.
>> ARTICLE
Which one, out of curiosity?
>> ARTICLE
Ilse's notebook OVA. I think it was the first OVA.
>> ARTICLE
They're not a spin-off. The spin-off is the middle school chibi version. The OVAs are world building fillers.

Well if it's world building I wouldn't call it filler but I get what you mean.

How did you calculate Haruhi? I hope you didn't include Disappearance of Nagato       
Edit: Checked on MAL... I had no idea that 2nd season was below 8 O.o. Was it that bad (people didn't like it even without endless eight)
>> ARTICLE
> Was it that bad

I don't think so, but other people did. [A lot of people gave it somewhere from 1-6](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4382/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu_\(2009\)/stats) all because of Endless Eight.
>> ARTICLE
i saw people giving bad reviews and scores "not because of endless eight". But that in general it was wrong and not melancholic. Kinda like a filler. I can't remember even though I watched it twice
>> ARTICLE
I know some people didn't like Sigh (maybe because Haruhi takes things too far at one point?) as much as Melancholy, but if they gave it a "bad" score, they're probably lying and its really mostly because of EE. I don't think the 2nd season outside of EE is nearly different enough to warrant a huge drop from the 1st season.
>> ARTICLE
EE is part of the season and should affect the season's rating.
>> ARTICLE
Positively
>> ARTICLE
I probably counted wrong, but I have 52 myself.

Probably shouldn't count Erased, though, since it's literally 1 episode. What's #101?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually you're probably right. #101 is Whisper of the Heart but I'd have to add Tokyo Godfathers too, since they're tied.
>> ARTICLE
If tied, I'd say it's best to add the one with more votes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria deserves top 100 though :(
>> ARTICLE
True. I think Aria The Animation brings down the average. It's not quite as strong as the others. Aria The Natural introduces a lot of interesting things to the show and Aria The Origination has a few truly stellar episodes. I still rate Aria as 10/10, though. It's one of favourite anime. Now if only Nozomi would release it on Blu-Ray with the new OVAs.
>> ARTICLE
The Blu-rays look terrible, so even if they come to the States, don't get your hopes up.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't look terrible to me.
>> ARTICLE
yeah animation alone didnt reach 8, which is strange, i can understand origination being higher since it has the finale, but animation and natural are basically the same, i wonder what make the score differs that much.....
>> ARTICLE
People who finished the first season(s) will very rarely give sequels a low score, which raises the average a bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, a lot of people really miss a wonderful serie because I think the beginning (basically Animation) is just a little difficult to be interesting sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Aria the Animation had some slightly weaker episodes but it also had some of the best moments in the entire show.
>> ARTICLE
True. Aria the Animation includes the "Ara ara/not allowed" bit between Alicia and Akira which sets up the continuing gag between Aika and Akari about embarrassing marks not being allowed for the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
It also has a great beach episode!
>> ARTICLE
KnK not being in the top 100 makes me sad. I just sat down and watched them with a friend a week ago. Those are some fantastic movies. Especially numbers five and seven.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the series and wasn't too fond of it, are the movies any better?
>> ARTICLE
For Kyoukai no Kanata, movie 1 is just a recap, 2 is a meh sequel. Prob not worth the time imo.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I was looking for
>> ARTICLE
KnK stands for Kara no Kyoukai, not Kyoukai no Kanata.
>> ARTICLE
I think you'll find that's open to interpretation 
>> ARTICLE
In this case it wasn't.
>> ARTICLE
Kara no Kyoukai? As far as I know it's just a series of seven movies. There's a few extra things, but they aren't like a new series or anything. I'm not sure I know what you mean.
>> ARTICLE
Kyoukai no Kanata was what I was referring to, my bad with all these acronyms being the same -.-
>> ARTICLE
Hahaha! That's understandable. That I do not have an opinion on as the show is currently sitting in my to do list.
>> ARTICLE
5 and 7 are the two that *were* in the Top 100, then got dragged down by the rest :p

At least they're still in the Top 200, probably even 150.
>> ARTICLE
> Haruhi | 7.86 (Dat Endless Eight!)
> 

The god damned Endless Eight. Disappearance is such a fantastic movie too.

Fuck you Kyon-kun and your denwa. 
>> ARTICLE
I kinda liked the Endless Eight. The pay off was worth it to me. And even if you don't fuck with the same episode 5 times in a row you can just skip. 
>> ARTICLE
Recommending you skip any part of a show is definitely a sign that something is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I don't recommend it, but if you really hate it that much it's an option. I personally loved seeing all of the small differences that were shown throughout the episodes. [Endless Eight](/s "When Kyon considered stopping Haruhi when she left the shop at the end of every episode the show purposely frustrated you and each time made the scene more intense just to make you think it would happen. When it finally did it was amazing and I think the pay off was worth it. Especially for me considering I didn't really mind the endless eight to begin with.") I can certainly see why people didn't like the endless eight, it just didn't bother me at all.
>> ARTICLE
The payoff was excellent, and I'm completely in agreement that drumming up sympathy for Nagato's plight was essential to the movie. I'm a huge fan of the franchise, and am definitely disposed to be in favor of it in discussions. That said... 

When you have a show with a total of 28 episodes, 14 being reruns of your previous season, and a whopping **8** of the remaining 14 being largely the same episode, objectively or subjectively speaking, it is hard to justify. Narrative intent notwithstanding, and irrespective of the fact that from a technical standpoint, the visuals and dialogue are different enough between the 8 episodes that it can't have been much of a cost-saving measure, it is going to be hard for most people to look at a show that has a total of 7 original episodes and give it much of a rating. 
>> ARTICLE
3 of the endless eight are original so only 5 are the same. I can totally see where you're coming from, and I can totally see why people don't like the endless eight. I just didn't mind it, in fact I enjoyed the original episodes and for the most part still got an enjoyment out of the ones that weren't new.  And I mean, it did come with a catchy title so that's a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Endless Eight, at least enough to sit through 3-4 of them every time rewatch the series. 

That said, I maintain that they could have done their empathy-for-Nagato aims about as much justice with a "Forever Four" or even "Tiresome Three" arc instead; 8 was too much for too many, and arguably served to alienate more than it did excite. Meanwhile, while art, animation, voice work, etc. did change between the episodes, I can't really call any but the first and last "original". It all smacks a bit of laziness on their part, plus possibly a wanton maverick streak. 
>> ARTICLE
If someone doesn't like it then they can just skip episodes, they can easily google what episodes to skip and do so. The shorter arc types wouldn't create the pay-off that I treasured so much. Though I binged the arc in one day. I can definitely imagine the disappointment  while it was airing.
>> ARTICLE
Ah Endless Eight. I really watch (the anime) and read (the LN) through all of it.

A pity that the next arc after Haruhi's disappearance was not adapted.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I still need to read the light novels.

I'm happy Shirobako has been doing so well, it seems to have leveled off, but it's nearly in the Top 100, which is great.

Definitely well deserved, but it's also a year removed from having aired. I'm not sure a single two cours will keep it in that conversation without either being generationally good (possible, but highly unlikely) or reasonable hype around a second season.
>> ARTICLE
If anything it's disappointing it's not doing better. It's easily the best not sequel series that aired during last year.

Honestly? It deserves to be much higher. It's better than a big portion of top 50 anime.

Shirobako deserves it. It's absurd how quickly that show propelled itself into being one of my favourites.

Wow, calling it improved. I'm hurt. 

I'm kidding though, nice job. I like the representation movies get on this list a lot, but I feel that both have a value in their differences. Just so you know, I've been making a Hummingbird top 100 that I'll try to post tonight and will most likely be doing a top 3 by season as well. Making lists like these just make it easier to browse for everyone.  Really like the weighted average system man.

In case you're gonna watch rainbow, I wouldn't get too hyped. It has a really good first ~14 episodes, but it really trails off after that. It's worth it for the first half alone though, and *some* of the later half is quite good

It's really good probably the most mature and realistic anime I've seen and it's very feels and feel good heavy. This subreddit is very flavor of the month as opposed to something like /a/ which is why you probably don't hear about it much, it's very worth a watch though.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly surprised to see *Parasyte* so high up. Could have sworn it had a much lower score when it ended.

Glad this list gets *Millennium Actress* in the top 100 though, as it definitely deserves it.

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* in the top 40 after 1 episode. Seems about right.

Hajime no Ippo at 15. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Seriously anyone who hasn't watched this, go watch it. It's IMO the pinnacle of sports anime. I was going to do a whole Watch This but someone already did one, but just watch it people.
>> ARTICLE
The post is a good idea, especially with the idea of score weighting ... though I think using the arithmetic mean for it might not be the best way. To understand how an average can be 'wrong', consider the case of an object moving at speed 5 m/s for 10 seconds, then 10 m/s for 5 seconds. Equivalently, consider the case of an object moving at 5 m/s for 50 metres, then 10 m/s for the next 50 metres. This is two different descriptions of exactly the same thing, so is the average speed (5\*10+10\*5)/(10+5), or is it (5\*50+10\*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The problem is that the arithmetic mean assumes a kind of independence and linearity in the data it's given. I think weighting by length is correct, but the scores themselves are not 'nice' in the way we want. I would say that the difference between 9 and 8.5 is huge compared to the difference between 8.5 and 8, and that's big compared to the difference between 8 and 7.5, etc. So by averaging in the straightforward manner, we are undervaluing highly rated entries.

But we can still use the arithmetic mean indirectly, we just need to apply a reversible transformation to the data first, and reverse it after.

From here things are a little more opaque; there's no obvious choice for the transform. Perhaps there is a statistical way to approximate a choice that's ideal by some concrete measure, but it's not really my area. My first idea is that the more abstract 'linear value' of a score is inversely proportional to its distance from 10, giving the transform f(r) := 1/(10-r). My second idea is that a show with a score of r+1 is worth, say, twice as much as one with a score of r, giving the transform g(r) := 2^r.

Shows whose entries all have similar scores will not be majorly affected, so let's take Haruhi as an example. The average Haruhi episode has 20 mins of content after you strip the OP and ED, so I'm counting the 2 hours 42 of Disappearance as 8 episodes. Then the basic average gives you 7.96, but the first idea gives 8.16, and the second idea gives 8.09. If you use the second idea but go for *thrice* rather than *twice*, you get 8.16 again.

The difference in averaging systems should be big enough to reorder much of the list (and probably add/remove a few entries), since many show's scores are separated by only a few hundredths.
>> ARTICLE
> so is the average speed (5*10+10*5)/(10+5), or is it (5*50+10*50)/(50+50)? These are different values, so at most one can be correct.

The first is an average across time, the second is an average across distance. Both values are *correct*, they're just completely different things. 

If someone said f(x,y)= x + y, partially differentiate this. There are two answers, one for differentiating in respect to y and one in respect to x. 

Now this doesn't disprove your point in any respect, in fact it enforces it (we have to choose the average most relevant), but there's no *correct* average only a more *relevant* average.

Or at least that's how I've always interpreted it.
>> ARTICLE
Mm, I put my first use of wrong in single quotes to excuse the imprecise wordingI meant 'correct' with regard to what you intend to obtain (overall speed).

For context, it might have also been worth mentioning that using the harmonic mean will give you the desired ('per second') result, despite using the second ('per metre') data set.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I do not have the math knowledge for this. You could say I went with my simple arithmetic because that's the best I could figure out :p 

But let me see if I understand this. Specifically the first one (since it sounds better to me). So because MAL scores are distributed such that the 10 to 9.5 range has 0 entries, the 9.5 to 9.0 range has ~10 entries, the 9.0 to 8.5 range has ~90 entries, the 8.5 to 8.0 range has ~400 entries, etc., you're saying higher scores should therefore have a greater value. And to do that, you can use that formula of yours. You first calculate an *f(r)* for each entry by putting the entry's score into the formula as *r*, then average the f(r)'s together the same way I had already been doing, then put that result back into the formula and find *r* for the new average score. Is that right?

I got 8.16 doing that with Haruhi so hopefully that means I did it right.

Another example with a shorter gap like GiTS would be:

* f1 = 1/(10-8.47)
* f2 = 1/(10-8.57)
* f3 = 1/(10-8.23)

avgf = (f1\*(26/56.5))+(f2\*(26/56.5))+(f3\*(4.5/56.5))

avgf = 1/(10-r)

r = 8.502 as opposed to the original 8.497.

Yeah? I got this?

Yep, sounds like you understand!

No, no... that is [the movie.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11577/Steins;Gate:_Fuka_Ryouiki_no_D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)

I put it in because it's listed as a sequel (through the OVA). If it's a sequel, I think it should count. It doesn't *have* to be from the VN as long as it fits in with the anime. Given its good score and its sequel nature, I figured it would.

Compare that to HxH. The story very fluidly transitions from one arc into the next while following the manga very closely, and there's just no place for the movies to happen. From what I've read about them (and I'd say is proved by their scores :p), they just don't fit in.

I would really like to revisit this chart once Season 2 of Shokugeki no Soma is animated by JC Staff. Autumn Election final 8 is, IMO, the strongest arc of the manga.

Yay for Slam Dunk making in to the top 100. Very first sports anime that I watched and enjoyed. I suddenly felt awkward when I watched KnB until it grew on me when I finally accepted its super power ala Prince of Tennis take for basketball. But daym, Slam Dunk will be a classic. Here's hoping it gets a new adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
52/100... 

Definitely easy to see some score discrepancies like this though. 

Like Spice and Wolf II being higher than the first season when it was definitely worse after the studio change. Good example of sequel-bias. 

Or The Pet Girl of Sakurasou being quite a bit higher than Nagi no Asukara, and Angel Beats! being higher than both of them. I'm pretty sure most people who've seen all three would rank them in the opposite order. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, I dodnt even realize that lol

Nagi no Asukara > Pet Girl > Angel Beats is definitely the way it should be

Angels Beats is always rated high for some reason :/. I liked it, but there are many others that are definitely better.
>> ARTICLE
So happy to see spice and wolf on this list. I just recently found it and binged it this weekend and its now up with stiens;Gate as my personal best show of all time

Lol, I like how Nichijou took one place higher than NGNL

Satoshi Kon just barely makes it in at 96 and 100? Excuse me while I go sit in a corner and cry.

Also, got around 30/100, if I count series I've watched most of but didn't finish, 25/100 if I don't.

NGNL rated higher than Monogatari.

I approve this list.

Epic, Tokyo Godfather in 100, coincidence? think not

You still combined Kenshin TV with the OVAs.  They're really way too different IMO.  We're talking completely different genres here.  Fate Zero and UBW are far more alike than those.

Seriously? I don't want to say it's overrated especially after seeing the thread earlier about calling something overrated but come on. If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people. Maybe I just don't see it but can someone please tell me what is so good about this show cause I rated it a 7(and I think this may be overdoing it)and that is mainly due to the animation. The jokes can only be funny for so long and I didn't even find them that funny in the first place.
>One Punch Man | 9.02 | 12 Eps | 2015
>> ARTICLE
OPM is a really good show. But no way it should ever be above Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
It's at a 9.02 so obviously some people agree with you. It's just you make up a minority who don't think it's worth higher. And that's okay. Personally I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey. That's okay. 
>> ARTICLE
> I don't get why Haikyuu is higher than Kuroko no Basket but hey...

Probably because more MAL users thinks that Haikyuu is much better than KnB. Oh wait...

I watch both KnB and Haikyuu and read both its manga and I really like Haikyuu much better but I also enjoyed KnB because its Slam Dunk with Prince of Tennis super powers.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people don't agree with you on this as seen by the rank. It's not worth complaining over because you personally dislike it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not blankly complaining. I actually want to know what it is that makes people go nuts over the show and want to have pseudo discussion.
>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why people like game of thrones but i'm not just going to complain about its imdb rank am i?
>> ARTICLE
So this is clearly going over your head. I said I want to hear what other people are saying as to why it's so good. Do you not want to hear people's reasoning for their differing opinions?
>> ARTICLE
Your original comment just comes off as complaining about a series you didn't like but has earned universal praise. OP has pretty much answered why people like this show for you.
>> ARTICLE
I went in to OPM the same way I went into Gintama, wanting comedy. Both executed that excellently, and also include some over the top and insane battles. They also both have very good writing that makes the characters stand out and that adds to the comedy. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a real hype band-wagon effect.  When everyone starts talking about a show and confirming with each other how much they all like it they all wind up liking it more.

But, the reality is that high rating reflects the enjoyment that people got out of their hype train (people like being excited together with other people...in bed).  I think it is fair for a show that generates hype to reap the reward.  It got people excited about it and talking about it - not all shows can do that.

A rating is about more than just the animation, sound etc etc.  Community impact is a thing, and OPM obviously had that in spades.

Personally I haven't seen OPM yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
Sadly you are not wrong. Same thing happened with Code Geass.

Popularity definitely matter as much as quality in these things. As long as no one tries to claim it has good narrative, characterization, themes or conflict I'm fine with it. The hype factor and production values carried OPM double-handedly.

I'm just glad SAO isn't there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm with you and I think it is overrated because many people give it a very high rating for its humor although humor is a rather subjective matter. Rating it high for its animation quality, its soundtrack, its battle choreography, etc is totally justified, but overall I don't think it deserves a place in all-time top 10 or even top 25, certainly not above Spirited Away.

And looking at the humor, if you don't care about power level battle anime you probably don't find parodies of power level battle anime particularly funny, at least that's why it doesn't work for me. And I know that action and shounen are among the most popular genres.
>> ARTICLE
I gave OPM a 9 and I'm totally okay with its position. My simple explanation would be it's hilarious. And of course humour is incredibly subjective... I also think it's terrific as an action series with a wide array of cool, interesting characters. Hell, Saitama became one of my favorite male characters in anime despite only being around for 1-cour.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is like what happened with Attack on Titan, I can see the frustration that would come over people.

*I don't get this at all.* How are you frustrated about someone else's score for an anime just because you thought it wasn't *as* good (THERE'S LITERALLY ONLY A 2 POINT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR SCORE AND THE OVERALL SCORE FFS) as they think it is. Literally the only difference between Attack on Titan, OPM and the rest of the anime on that list is that they're mainstream. There's multiple anime on the list that scored higher than both of them yet you're complaining about those ones.
>> ARTICLE
Well that is since I haven't seen them. The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it. I think the show had like a 9.5 rating after the first fucking episode.
>> ARTICLE
> The thing is everybody joined the OPM hype for no reason, just because others have started it.

Are you reading your stuff before you type it? You're seriously saying people only like OPM because it's popular? Oh wow remember how SAO, Naruto, DBZ, and Bleach are all in the top 100 for MAL scores? Yeah, no, me neither.

The show is rated highly because a lot of people really enjoyed it, not because of some imaginary circlejerk.

I can't wait for you to watch more than a whopping 3 anime from the top 100 and then come back here to bitch about how they got *two* more points than you gave them yourself. Seriously, think about how ridiculous it is that you're here complaining that OPM got *two* more points than the one you gave it.
>> ARTICLE
A two point difference is a couple thousand place difference on MAL though, so it's pretty significant 
>> ARTICLE
Does that matter *at all*? There are a lot of anime, a one point difference will produce literally thousands of anime inbetween your score and the MAL average. Hell, you can give an 8 for an anime that has a 8.50 average and you'll still have hundreds of anime inbetween your score and the average. So no, that's not significant at all.

Not to mention the fact that MAL users infamously don't score anything as below a 7, so there will be *way* more anime above a 7 than below hence being between his score and the MAL average.

If you don't believe me that there is a literal thousands of anime between just a one point differece here's [Aero wo Nerae #3257](http://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae!_(1979\)) (On the highest possible end of 7.00 rated anime) and [City Hunter #528](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470/City_Hunter) (On the lowest possible end of 8.00 rated anime). And that's me being generous because in reality the scoring doesn't work like that, if I give something a 7 it's not going to have an average 9.00 or 8.00 like City Hunter it's going to be inbetween scores which puts even more anime inbetween them.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but my point is exactly that, that individual points do make a big difference.  There is a big difference between a 9 and a 7 given the context of mal's scorings.
>> ARTICLE
My point is that it makes no difference whatsoever because no matter what point you give a show there will usually be a large amount of shows inbetween. For example if a show has an 8.50 no matter what I give it there will at least be hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the MAL average which is why I don't get what point you're trying to make. Hell, if something has a 7.50 average than there will be close to a thousand shows inbetween the two closest scores I can possibly give it. Saying there are thousands of shows inbetween 7 and 9 doesn't say anything at all. Am I supposed to bitch about every show that got an 8.50 just because I gave it an 8 since there are hundreds of shows inbetween my score and the actual score now?

I really don't know where you're trying to go with this argument, it doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it. Besides now you've brought up the context of MAL scoring while completely ignoring the actual context of MAL scores. I gave you some of the context already, more shows will be above the 7 belt of shows because infamously MAL users rate on a 1-4 scale. There's also the fact that there are a lot of second seasons, specials, and other extras included in those list of shows.
>> ARTICLE
Also many of the people who helped to create the hype in the media are the ones that read the manga or the webcomic.
>> ARTICLE
I personally loved One Punch man, it's a fresh take on parody action anime. Clearly others like it too. Why do you care if it's loved or not? if others see the rating, watch it, and love it too, where was the harm? are you saying people shouldnt like it cuz you didnt like it? lol
>> ARTICLE
It bothers me cause I have a friend that during the entire Fall season only talked about OPM and it was starting to piss me off.
>> ARTICLE
Lol, u prob wanted to stay off of /r/anime during the entire fall season then.
>> ARTICLE
the guy probably wanted you to get the same enjoyment he experienced, I dont think he meant any harm. 

I think anyone would be pissed off if they experienced what you did with any show, not just OPM.
>> ARTICLE
I've known him for 6 years so I'm sure he didn't intend to be a bother but since he is the only kid I talk to about anime, it got annoying when I couldn't bring anything up without it going back to OPM and how amazing it is.
>> ARTICLE
recommend a show of yours he hasnt watched, if he likes something you like, youll solve that problem lol.
>> ARTICLE
It's a comedy at it's heart and the thing with comedy is, it's hit or miss.  Some people find things funny that others don't, it's the way the genre works.  In the case of One Punch man, *a lot* of people find it quite funny (myself included).
>> ARTICLE
tbh i think if you're going to make a "franchise score" list, you should add everything related to that franchise whether its tangentially related to the main series or not.
>> ARTICLE
The point is that it's not a "franchise score" list but a "series score" list. Not everything in a franchise is relevant to a series. I did exclude OVAs and whatnot that are technically relevant because they get lower scores for being "just another episode", but now I'm thinking of at least listing them, with the exception of not factoring in their scores.

I just don't think a series should be dinged for having all sorts of random extras attached to it.
>> ARTICLE
>The combined scores are weighted averages based on length. Movies, etc. that're longer than an episode were converted into an equivalent number of episodes for that purpose.

Wait, what?  Shouldn't they be weighted by number of voters, not length?
>> ARTICLE
Well, with length I was thinking about time investment. Naturally the portion you spend more time on should count for more, right? At first I was just gonna average the scores together normally, but it was immediately apparent that was gonna be a terrible idea so this is what I came up with to fix that. Initially I was also including all sorts of OVAs and extras that should have as little affect as possible on the score so it made even more sense.

But you say number of voters? Hmmm... the idea behind that is to counter sequel bias then? I dunno. I get that, but it also gives more weight to the the additional movies and OVAs that I'm not sure should receive that extra weight.

Plus, the numbers are way larger and way more annoying to deal with...

[](#barakamonnotcool)

But I guess I should consider this. Though I have to say I do like my length idea.
>> ARTICLE
Film Z and Strong World are One Piece canon films, rate won't change a lot but I think they might be weighted.
>> ARTICLE
Z and Strong World aren't canon, they just use characters that are canon to the OP-verse and Oda had a part in their creation. Neither of them, Z especially, really fit in anywhere in the timeline either so I wouldn't include them.
>> ARTICLE
I don't really think it's fair to average out scores among series like that. Just like you can't really judge the quality of series by trying to average out scores for it's individual episodes, you have to take a holistic view of the entire product.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like your problem is with MAL and not the OP.
>> ARTICLE
True but I think it's better than picking one season's score to represent the whole.

Whoa can someone tell me why everyone's getting down voted.
>> ARTICLE
Controversial opinions. I'm guessing those downvotes are with me on the pro-manga side.
>> ARTICLE
I hadn't read the manga, but the gist is this: There's a time-skip.

Adult Rin is not sweet.

And most people, though not all, express their desire to not have read the manga after having read it.

"Most people" meaning those who speak up about it. Quite possible plenty of people who read it and hadn't seen the anime like it. I'm just speaking based on what I've seen here.
>> ARTICLE
> Adult Rin is not sweet.

It's not even that. She's just a teenager and teens do crazy stuff. But all the good will and manliness that Daichi built up gets thrown into the garbage, dumped in a swamp, and contaminated with industrial chemicals that make the land uninhabitable for all living things.

I really hated Daichi because of what happened in the manga. But mostly I hated myself for reading even though I had been warned not to. **Whatever morbid curiosity you have is not worth the pain you will go through.** 

Oh, but the first few chapters are okay. Up to... I forget where it changes. Was it the fourth volume? It was at about the same point that the anime ended. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, come on. Don't talk about it like that. Some people are going to like it and be happy that they continued through to the end of the manga.

If you were not disturbed by Koi Kaze, you might like the manga. If you don't know what Koi Kaze is, dont' worry about it. 
>> ARTICLE
Female here as well. 
Eden of the East, Nodame Cantabile, NANA,  Honey and Clover, Kuragehime, Paradise Kiss... Really, and of the more female oriented titles of the Noitamina time slot would be good choices. 
>> ARTICLE
After doing both Nodame and NANA, and looking at where NANA stopped, I don't think I could ever ever recommend NANA to someone. Nodame beats it in nearly every category.
>> ARTICLE
Nodame was solid, but it didn't deconstruct the MCs' relationship anywhere near as well as NANA did. Also, yeah NANA's ending was kinda YMMV though that's largely the point of the whole story anyways IMHO. Part of the beauty of it is how everybody interprets it differently... anyways I'm digressing, but I could write an entire essay on the merits of NANA's ending if you like :P

Admittedly, it's a bit overwhelming/over-the-head for a starter anime.
>> ARTICLE
See, I felt that NANA purposely created something just to break it down beyond the point of creation....sorta like making a bowl of pudding, and then burning the house down that you made the pudding in. It felt like it had many consecutive unrealistic sequences of events at times because of this, atleast to me.

When the manga actually gets a final ending, I will finish reading it, and I hope reading the story from start to finish lets me enjoy it more. But my point is that I know that Nodame was not as harsh and would much rather recommend that as a starter anime any day.
>> ARTICLE
Out of curiosity, what was your opinion of spice and wolf if you've seen it?
>> ARTICLE
It made me fall asleep. 
>> ARTICLE
Excellent list.  I'd add Red Garden.  It's not perfect, but it's a good semi-westernized anime w/ a female target audience.
>> ARTICLE
Nodame Cantabile was fucking splendid. The Live Action is arguably even better than the anime. It's worth checking out.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, all great josei series you listed there. This should be higher. I can't really think of anything else to show first to someone in their mid 20s, but those shows. 
>> ARTICLE
These were my starter series when I was 22. Can't really go wrong with these ones.

Upvoted for Nodame Cantabile and Honey and clover, as a Male who enjoys Romance but is tired of the classic high school setup, these were just a breath of fresh air.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously. This isn't female anime, this is emotionally mature anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'd add Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 to the list.  
  Watching it so far, it's a pretty interesting show.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure there's a function pretty much equivalent to e^x where x is the episode that equals how many bitch tears I cried during that episode.
>> ARTICLE
It's the closest thing I've watched to remind me of the "out-of-control" life-devastating events which occurred in Grave of the fireflies.  
  I just reached the episode where [Yuukii collapses and Mirai keeps dreaming her brother's dead](/spoiler).
>> ARTICLE
When I first got into anime, I watched all the ghibli films, but when I got to Grave of the Fireflies I had to turn it off half-way through because it was just too depressing. Three years later and I still haven't worked up the courage to watch it again, lol.
>> ARTICLE
Makes me wonder what kind of childhood I had, since I saw GoTF and Akira when I was around 11 or 12 perhaps. GoTF is depressing, for sure.  
  But there's an element of "humanism" that we all must learn and take from that movie. This is contrasted perfectly by Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. It is the complete opposite scenario for the main characters - yet the environment, the tragedy, the struggles are all the same.  

Now I gotta go watch some more episodes :P
>> ARTICLE
Start with Ghibli. That's the best gateway you can really have.
>> ARTICLE
This has kind of worked for me, but the transition is the hardest part wich I haven't cracked down yet, no matter how good the plot it just doesn't seem to leave an interest, it depends on the girl and her interests, exploring her personality is a must I'd say.

I wouldn't recommend this show to someone who isn't well versed in anime.  Menma's character can come across as really really annoying to a lot of people.

If you want annoying, then sir I suggest you watch Planetes. Ai Tanabe gets my vote for most annoying anime character, ever.

Once you get to the second episode then things get easier to follow.

MIKURUU BEAMU~!

Oh, I know, definitely, but you have to admit that it starts out very confusing until you catch on.
>> ARTICLE
Another female fan here (in my 30s).  From what I remember from when I started, you've got the right idea - definitely stay away from shows that look like they're aimed at kids.  I love magical girl shows now, but if you'd shown them to me at the start I would've thought you were nuts.  They're an acquired taste.  (Madoka is the only one that might work, and the plot doesn't kick in for a few episodes.)

I'd also second staying away from anything with a lot of fanservice, any harem shows (unless they're reverse harem), and any shows involving cute girls doing cute things (K-On!, Hidamari Sketch), unless there's also a metric ton of humor involved (Azumanga should be fine).

Having said...shounen action shows might not be a bad bet, depending on what she likes.  A lot of girls I know are into them, and they're usually pretty fast-paced with a lot of male characters (which tends to be appealing to girls).  I recommend Fullmetal Alchemist and Hikaru no Go, myself.

My personal recommendations, from what you've said about her being bored with most media:

* Seconding from your list: Death Note (thriller/suspense, interesting premise, and L), Ouran High School Host Club (funny as heck, cool down-to-earth female lead, lots of bishounen), Azumanga Daioh (w/caveat that there are a lot of Japanese culture references; but I watched it as a near-newbie and loved it), Usagi Drop (really cute - might be boring to her, though.  I liked it a lot, though), Kino's Journey (I love it, and have had luck introducing it to non-anime fans).

Seconding from other people's suggestions: 

* Honey and Clover (mainly because of Morita - might strike her as boring later, though).

* Skip Beat!  This is if she can get past the Hannah-Montana-like obviously-aimed-at-teen-girls premise.  I'm watching this right now, and the main lead is *insane*.  Don't get me wrong, I love Kyoko; but she's insane, in an interesting, over-the-top, yet still endearing way.  If she can get about 2-3 episodes in to the point where Sho dumps her and Kyoko begins her "I will get revenge by making it to the top in the showbiz industry" shtick, I think she'll be hooked.  I am.

* Fruits Basket - I loved this.  It has this mix of comedy and drama and fantasy that's just great, most of the side characters are interesting, and Tohru is adorable.  It's been on my fav list for years.

New things I haven't seen rec'd:

* If she's into thriller and/or sci-fi: Perfect Blue, Eve no Jikan, Pale Cocoon, Memories.

* If you *really* want to try something really weird and interesting, try Revolutionary Girl Utena or Mawaru Penguindrum.

Also my personal thoughts on this - I'd stay away from the following:

* Anything by Key.  These shows sometimes appeal to girls but are mostly aimed toward guys.  IMHO, all the girls in shows like these tend to blur together.  I haven't gotten past an episode or two to any of them, even though some come highly recommended.  (Yes, I know.  Someday.  When I finish Skip Beat! maybe.)

* Ghibli movies - too slowly-paced/childish.  They're recommended a lot for newcomers, but... in my experience, kids sometimes really like them (but are equally as likely to get bored and wander away, especially older kids), and non-anime-liking adults are usually kind of bored by anything other than Mononoke Hime.

* 5 cm per second - just saw it.  It's boring, IMHO.

I personally couldn't get into Bebop or Ano Hana, but I'm kind of an outlier, I think.
>> ARTICLE
I suggest movies since they don't require commitment and you can cover a wide range of genres rather quickly. I would use these three to cover Sci-Fi:

* The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [Besides begin a good movie, its hard to dislike its youthful humor and romance]
* Eve no Jikan (Time of Eve) Movie [Slow-paced, highbrow, down-to-earth Sci-Fi that strikes all the right chords and simply melts your heart].
* Paprika [Even if you dislike the psychological elements, its an awesome showcase of excellent music, ambiance and animation + has no kids in it]

From your list I would scratch Azumanga, Nichijou, School Rumble and Ouran. If she is not familiar with common anime tropes, most of the humor will be lost on her.
>> ARTICLE
Summer wars!
>> ARTICLE
Bebop. It is universal.
>> ARTICLE
I love Cowboy Bebop so much. For my birthday my mother got me the complete box set of every Cowboy Bebop episode ever. She used to watch it when I was a baby because it was on late at night and I kept her up ^~^
>> ARTICLE
Female here!

Ghibli for sure. She might like Escaflowne - I remember really liking it when I saw it for the first time and if she doesn't know much/care for Japanese, the English dub isn't that bad. It's also short (just 26 episodes), does have fighting, but is mostly character-driven. There are no panty shots, and while there are some sexual themes, it's nothing like most anime situations (convoluted and maybe a bit kinky). There's typical teen-romance stuff which usually drives me nuts, but which I didn't mind in this show. 
>> ARTICLE
Escaflowne the series is amazing, and my first anime ever (granted I was fourteen, but I still love it just as much now that I'm in my 20s). It's very character-driven but with enough action to keep it from getting boring, and has a strong female lead.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I usually end up liking shows with a fair bit of action - it takes a really good story for me to like a romance show or anything that is 100% directed at females. Except Fushigi Yuugi. I watched it with a group of friends and even though it got painfully over-dramatic and half the cast was either gay and/or in love with the lead, I still somehow enjoyed it. It was an oddly silly show considering the number of times the subject of rape and angsty underaged sex came up... 
>> ARTICLE
I love Fushigi Yuugi, even though based on all of my other preferences I ought to hate it. There's just something about it that makes it so much fun to watch. I also really love the FY: Genbu Kaiden manga, though Yuu hasn't published a new one in several years. I think the Genbu Kaiden manga is a lot more mature than the original series, but I still adore that anime. It was the first set I ever bought on DVD.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I've not read the manga version. Maybe I'll give that a try. I think I loved the world and the way their powers manifested (as based on the legends surrounding the constellations). Also, all the food. There's this one scene where Miaka is at a festival and she eats a bowl of what looks like little white cubes in a clear broth - my sister became obsessed with finding out what that was so that I could make it for her. I _think_ (can't remember clearly) that it was basically an almond-flavoured silken tofu boiled in a light simple syrup. Anyway, that's one of my strongest memories of that show - the constant munchies from watching Miaka stuff her face and go on about how tasty traditional Chinese cooking is. :D
>> ARTICLE
Escaflowne movie is a full on bloodbath though.
>> ARTICLE
That is very true. I wasn't thinking of the movie at all when I wrote that. Hitomi's also kind of annoying in the movie... but there are enough things that they tweaked which I like that I still overall really, really liked the movie. 
>> ARTICLE
I like to pretend the movie doesn't exist.
>> ARTICLE
Female who got into anime near my 20's here. My introduction to anime was Fruits Basket. It's overly cutesy for most people and the english dubbing is annoying, but if she likes cute it might be worth a try.

I agree with everyone else that Ghibli is a good way to go. It's most likely the best chance at getting her into things. 

As far as shoujo titles I think you're best bets are Nana, Ouran, Kimi Ni Todoke and Skip Beat. They are all solid animes that are geared toward us of the finer sex. Nana in particular as it is meant for a bit more of a mature audience. Kimi Ni Todoke might move a bit slow for her though.

For non-shoujo there are many classics that don't rely too heavily on the audience having testosterone. Death Note is fast-paced, interesting and keeps you thinking. If she likes crime shows that should help as well. Usagi Drop should be suggested as well. But be warned that, as a female in my 20's, watching it REALLY made me want to have a kid. I don't see Natsume Yuujinchou mentioned very often here, but I think it is a great choice although it does talk a lot about Japanese folklore and might seem strange who doesn't already know a bit about it. Azumanga Daioh is light-hearted enough to appeal to most females but if you're concerned about her thinking anime is pervy remember that they do have the pervy teacher who comes off as a pedo.

You mentioned 5cm per second as one you thought of but I'd suggest not picking that one. It might just be me but I was left feeling completely unfulfilled and the plot felt like it was moving at 5cm per second as well. Probably not the most popular opinion around, but just throwing in my two cents here. 
>> ARTICLE
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or Deathnote.
>> ARTICLE
Fullemetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Deathnote, Wolf's Rain, Now and Then Here and There. Try picking something that does have one guy and 5 girls on the box lol.

Do not show someone Now and Then Here and There unless you've watched it and know what you're in for. That was one of the most depressing and brutal anime I've watched.

I am one of those ladies in their 20's you seek! 

Ghibli movies are your best bet. Nobody doesn't love Ghibli. Spirited Away, Mononoke and Howl's Moving Castle are solid bets. 

If she wants a show after that, I've shown Host Club to some friends (also ladies in their early 20's) and they like it, even without any knowledge of shoujo anime tropes. I saw baccano further down the list- it's a ~~good show~~ AWESOME show, but it definitely requires attention to watch. If she has trouble getting into stories that may not be the best choice. 

Some of my favorites that I would recommend to somebody interested in getting into anime are Samurai Champloo, Fullmetal Alchemist (haven't finished Brotherhood yet, but SO CLOSE), Death Note, and Durarara. 

I'm currently flipping out over Pandora Hearts. The manga is the most plot twist-tastic thing I've ever read. My roommate and I lost a lot of sleep over that one. The anime is decent. 

Going off the track of action-y anime.... try Skip Beat. It's a sort of romance/antiromance comedy. The author of the manga is Yoshiki Nakamura and I really like her style of humor and romance- it's not overly typical. [also, just a little rant because you guys are my people and won't mind, I'm still pissed they never made an anime of Tokyo Crazy Paradise. It was even better than Skip Beat imo. End rant.]

I'm afraid I can't give you an opinion on most of the stuff on your list. I haven't seen Usagi Drop, Potemayo, Ano Hana, Nichijou, School Rumble, Azumanga, Clannad, (and other stuff by Key - Kanon/ Air/ Angel Beats etc), but some of it is on my to-watch list. 

>> ARTICLE
Michiko & Hatchin. No knowledge of Japanese anything required, great story and art, no questionable bits. Surefire win.
>> ARTICLE
My wife says, "Black Rock Shooter TV, Death Note, or Code Geass" All appeal to females generally, are just about perfect 10s in terms of quality, and start off with intense first episodes. 

(edit: Death Note's first episode isn't as intense as the other two, but she has an interest in crime stories, so this may appeal to her more than the other two)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, all sounds good.. but for someone in her mid-20's?  
Must of us probably got into anime when we were in our teens when it was easy to influence our mind
>> ARTICLE
Yes, absolutely, for someone in her mid-20s.  I'm a girl in my 20s and I loved Geass when it came out, though I'm not sure it's a great starter anime what with the mecha.  Death Note is one of the biggest series I know of for hooking female friends of mine who never liked any anime or manga before. I have a friend who got into anime fandom at not quite thirty through Death Note and Pandora Hearts.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, gonna vote against Code Geass. For one, mecha get eyerolls from some (not me, but some), but secondly, the ending of the first season seems to either make people love the show or hate it with a burning cinder fury of crimson chaos fire.

Death Note might be good if she likes crime stuff though. The supernatural elements aren't overwhelming and it's mostly a good mystery/supergenius story a la sherlock holmes.
>> ARTICLE
also the mecha arent completely ridiculous until you get used to the fact that there are mecha. Code Geass is my absolute favorite series ever, and it does a good job of having cool mecha stuff that doesnt get ridiculous ala TTGL too fast, on top of having a fantastic plot and a cool supernatural element.

also as someone who usually despises Dubs, Code Geass is really fucking good, but ill still reccomend watching it with subs instead (might be hard for people like native english speakers who arent used to having subtitles).
>> ARTICLE
You said she likes CSI? I would definitely recommend Death Note. That's almost nonstop suspense and entertainment
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate :)  Although...  It starts off slow...  And the word pervert is mentioned about 50 times, but it isn't what it seems...  For others:

Not sure if you're being sarcastic... the Death Note anime is 37 episodes, which is pretty long by anime standards.
>> ARTICLE
I think 37 episodes can be short or long depending on the watcher.  If you are someone who's favorite animes are Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece, then it is short.  If you like Paranoia Agent and things along 10-20, then it is fairly long

>Okay I'm assuming most of the people posting recommendations are dudes. Are there any female opinions? or are there even any females here? orz

No female, but I do know a couple of great josei series (josei are targeted to older women). 

Definitively check out ***Nodame Cantabile*** and ***Honey and Clover***. Both series are light romantic comedies about university students trying to make their way into life. It's light, funny, emotional and a lot of people can associate themselves with the situations the character encounters. Plus, simply as animes, they're both pretty damn good.

Female here. I suggest Nana or Paradise Kiss. They're woman romance kind of things but the plots are both excellent.

True. However, OP is looking for stuff to introduce to a female in her mid-20's. Target audience I believe. And with all the moe stuff that I've seen some guys fall for, I don't see these two shows as being THAT difficult to watch.

Yay! Nobody here mentions Skip Beat!. Love that show. Have you read Tokyo Crazy Paradise? It's by the same lady.

Death Note, mind-blown is universal and certainly this anime doesn't start slow.

Fruits Basket.

What kind of shows, movies, books, etc. does she like?
>> ARTICLE
Might as well take that with a grain of salt.
All I know is, she loses interest quick if it starts to get boring.
Haven't really seen her get really 'hooked' on any form of media -always has that bored look on her face.
 Is it even possible to convert a person like this into a fan?
>> ARTICLE
Well, if it helps you, Death Note is something that could stir up the blood in her veins. 
>> ARTICLE
From what you're describing so far, probably not.

You can't think of any specific series or books that she's liked?
>> ARTICLE
I do vaguely remember seeing her watch shows like CSI and some reality TV shows. Not sure if that helps
>> ARTICLE
If she did enjoy CSI, you may be misjudging her. Shounens are usually fast paced and keep the excitement going. I wouldn't throw out FMA as it's not all that childish but it is action packed and is great at keeping people hooked. Princess Mononoke and other Ghibli works, Death Note, School Rumble, and Ouran High all seem like good choices as well.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe Monster?
>> ARTICLE
Can't say anything about reality TV, but you might have some luck with Death Note. There's also Cowboy Bebop, Darker than Black, or Ghost in the Shell SAC, but you would probably have to pick a specific episode to hook her in.

Monster might also be worth looking into, but it takes at least a few episodes to get going and might be too complex for what you're thinking of?
>> ARTICLE
I've actually noticed that a lot of my anime-watching-friends have ADD, myself included, and tend to get bored and distracted easily when watching normal western shows. 

Anime is this weird visual experience that is constantly throwing new shit at you, so people that get bored with normal forms of media may find anime to be a much more approachable medium. You're never really bored when watching a lot of animes, as they usually jump all over the place and there's not a single dull moment. 

I would think back to many of the shows that brought you into anime, and show those to her. Most of us got into anime with all the Toonami/Adult Swim shit, and I think all of that is a really good way to introduce people. 

So, start with things like Bebop, Champloo, maybe FLCL if your friend is a little bit eccentric, but if not, wait a while for that one, Trigun, etc. With westerners, it's very important to start with animes that have huge western influences, or else they'll just feel really disconnected and won't enjoy it at all. It'll be a culture-shock.

Just to be safe, I would tend to stay away from shit that you've watched in the last 5-10 years or so, as you can't really look at those animes with an outside eye. They may seem tame and western-ish to you, but you at that point already had developed a taste in anime and became ingrained into the culture. 

The animes I always have the most success with are Trigun and Cowboy Bebop, as most people fall in love with those shows within 4-5 episodes. The characters, writing, etc, are all fantastic, and they'll make people want to see what happens to those characters, and getting people to develop an emotional attachment is very important at the beginning stages of watching anime, as some people may go into it not taking anime seriously at all and dismissing it as children cartoons.

So, I would suggest starting with-

-Bebop, Trigun, Champloo-

Then moving onto-

-FLCL-Madoka-Death Note-

Then just sort of let her branch out on her own. Let her know about all the great animes, give her a list, tell her about them, let her pick what sounds interesting to her.

I know a lot of people tend to suggest showing Studio Ghibli movies, but I don't recommend it at all. A lot of westerners go into anime with this pre-conceived notion that it is for children, because that's how cartoons are for westerners. Showing them Ghibli movies really reinforces and supports this belief, and it may really turn people off from watching any more anime. I've never had any success with these films, and the only one I would recommend showing to a anime-newbie would be Princess Mononoke, as that is more on the mature-side.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with your starters but I don't think you should throw FLCL so soon. That is what I'd consider to be an acquired taste for someone that enjoys a bit of weird anime.

Thanks for the long post, but I've got a few concerns

* Shows that brought me into anime are not on your list, mine would be Ranma, Ah My Goddess, Eva
so I have a little trouble relating
* Please consider her age-range, it's not as easy getting a mid-20's person hooked rather than a teenager 
* I kind of agree with you the Ghibli movies, it feels like it's in a whole different category of animation from the common ones

>> ARTICLE
If she gets board easily I would start her on FLCL, short and punchy. When my friends ask about anime I always point them here as a starter.

Although it's not something I would normally suggest as a starter, another shorty that's more serious and has a mystery/ghost story feel is Le Portrait de Petit Cossette. Super short with only three episodes, visually stunning with classical music for atmosphere. Even the theme song strays from the J-pop norms. 

If she enjoys deep storylines but finds that she gets board visually Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo is a decent adaptation of the original story and visually it is... Amazing. Although the overt Yaoi over tones may be too much for a starter who's over the age of 15.

Good luck!
>> ARTICLE
I've always heard that if you watch FLCL and dont have a knowledge on anime, it makes little to no sense (Havn't watched it yet, its on my to-watch list)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's definitely not something I would recommend for a first time watcher. It's quite crazy. Very cool, of course, but for somebody used to the kind of stuff that's on American TV? It's probably too much. People aren't used to reading into deeper meanings in TV shows like they are for movies or books and you definitely have to be prepared for that in FLCL.
>> ARTICLE
FLCL is out-landish yes, but I had no problems following it or enjoying it, just like I had no problems understanding the end of Eva (a lot of people complained it also made no sense). Not to mention I don't watch anime to be knowledgeable about it, I'm not some Otaku twat looking for status, on that note I'm *not* saying you are an Otaku twat but you know the people I'm talking about. I watch anime becasue I enjoy the story lines and I find it visually pleasing. 
>> ARTICLE
Yea I understand that. Wasn't calling you out or anything, sorry if it sounded that way.
>> ARTICLE
It kind of did, but that's the internet! ^_^ Apology accepted.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I just assumed you were a westerner, my bad. :P 

You're definitely right about the difficulty of getting a mid-20's person into anime, but it's not impossible. I'd say that should be a major factor in determining which anime you pick, probably need to aim for some of the more mature ones. 

Really, you're the one who can determine it best. Pick one that you think will suit her personality, one with characters that she'll really like and get attached to, one with an interesting, mature story. 

Whatever you pick, I suggest making it clear to her before watching that if she doesn't like what she's watching, it doesn't represent all of anime. Anime is its own medium, not just a genre, and there are tons of different types of anime, and really as long as a person gives anime a fair chance, they're bound to find a few gems that they really love. If she doesn't like something, then you guys can try to find one that she does.

Maybe you should come up with a list of shows you think would be suitable for a first viewing, then tell her about them and let her pick which sounds the most interesting to her. 
>> ARTICLE
* Ghost in the shell: stand alone complex
* samurai champloo
* voices of a distant star (ova)
* angel beats
* Cowboy bebop
* trigun
>> ARTICLE
I second Trigun :D
>> ARTICLE
The key here seems to be that you need to hook her attention with the very first episode, or else she won't continue the series. Oh, and avoid anything that would make anime seem to be "for kids only". Stuff like Ghibli is great, but it just reinforces the common notion that anime can't be for adults.

Death Note, and to a lesser extent Code Geass, are surprisingly good at such. Starting off with a more mainstream series is probably a better way to try and get newcomers interested in anime. Samurai Champloo, and to a lesser extent Cowboy Bebop, should also work.

Note, I'm not a particularly huge fan of Code Geass and Death Note, but they are good introductory series. Anything too niche tends to not be good introductory shows. You'd be surprised at how many people don't like stuff we see in Clannad and such, at least as newcomers to anime. Remember that we hold biases towards these shows because we have been consuming anime for extended periods of time (sometimes years).
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't throw 5 centimeters per second in there. Just my personal opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
Kuragehime is a really good josei series that nerdy women can probably relate to. I've successfully shown it to other women around my age (21) who weren't into anime and they loved it.
>> ARTICLE
If she doesn't make it through the Makoto arc on "Kanon" without crying, you should (a) don't show her any more anime and (b) get a new girlfriend.
>> ARTICLE
I had a friend who loved Inuyasha, that was her gateway into anime. She really liked it cuz of the way Kagome and Inuyasha acted towards each other and because it had a good story to it. This anime will also introduce your friend to Japanese folklore and the culture in general including its history. 
>> ARTICLE
I suggest Haibane Renmei! But then again, I always suggest Haibane Renmei.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone loves code geass!
>> ARTICLE
I'm afraid that you shouldn't introduce a female (well, most females probably.  Females can love Code Geass as much as anybody, but I assume that if a show with gigantic mechas fighting is something she'll love, that female wouldn't have to be mentioned...) to a show largely based off of fighting mechas.
>> ARTICLE
Geass has an enormous female fanbase.  *Enormous.*  On the other hand I don't think it really makes a great first introduction to anime because of the giant robots, but it could work for some people -- the plot is certainly very fast-paced, compelling, and the early eps all have great cliffhangers.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass has an incredibly intellegent plot too and the mechas dont get shittastic insanely powerful until R2.
>> ARTICLE
Hotarubi no Mori e.  It's short (40 minutes) and really sweet.  If she likes it you could try introducing her to Natsume Yuujinchou afterwards, or maybe even Mushishi.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so I'm another female in my 20s, but I typically like more action/adventure type shows so I'm not sure my choices would be the best for her if she's into more traditionally "girly" stuff. Disclaimer out of the way, here's my suggestions and a little bit about each one:

* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (long, but with a complex story, great characters, and beautiful animation)

* Studio Ghibli (specifically Miyazaki-directed) films are always a safe bet.

* Escaflowne (strong female lead, mostly realistic romance, enough action to keep it fast-paced)

* Fate/stay night (fast-paced, variety of characters, but might be too "fantasy" in style if she's not already into that kind of thing)

* Kuragehime (adorable story about a bunch of geeky girls living together)

* Ouran High School Host Club (hilarious, not too ridiculous, endearing characters)

* Romeo x Juliet (LOOSELY based on the play, but has lots of good romance and action, again with a strong female lead)

* Trigun (awesome space western, great characters and plenty of action)
>> ARTICLE
I was also thinking about recommending Romeo x Juliet, but then I thought that it might not be the best introduction to anime in general, as it would appear more to be just an anime take on western "popular culture", so to speak. 

I do believe however that it is a somewhat fitting "introduction" to anime, as usual 'hardcore' anime has a very generalized story concept. Romeo x Juliet introduces this generalized concept onto a familiar "western" foundation. It's a good way to take.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a little surprised Kenshin hasn't been mentioned at all. While a lot of people just think of it as a shounen it's really one of the few animes that has a bit of everything. It's funny and yet has it's serious moments, it's not as over the top as most shounen and has solid characters.

It's my go to anime to get people interested (with the exception of when I know someone's really into action and such) and has yet to fail for me.
>> ARTICLE
I love Kenshin!  Truthfully though, the prequel thing to it is much better, but my GUESS, it that you are right to suggest Kenshin to a female.  It is much more lax rather than sort of depressing.  The one thing I can't stand, is how many filler episodes it has AND THE VOICES ARE TERRIBLE.  It is the one of the few animes I have seen where the subs are just as annoying to me as the dubs
>> ARTICLE
See for me Kenshin is one of the few animes where I actually LOVE the dub which is another reason I suggest it as a good starter anime because the dub isn't terrible and as such you don't have to try and get the person to read subtitles lol
>> ARTICLE
I second the vote for Kenshin. I introduced my wife (27) to anime via Kenshin, and I've since gone on to watch Fullmetal Alchemist and Code Geass (which she bought me) with her, so it seems to have worked.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
Ghibli movies And Mushishi.  Totally agree
>> ARTICLE
Female here, I started with my bf showing me Full Metal Alchemist and Death Note! Dang good starts, I think Death Note is a REALLY good starter series, because most people find it intelligent/interesting enough to "look past" it being anime, and furthermore, there isn't too much silliness/over-the-top anime character in it. 
>> ARTICLE
If you could only have her watch one I'd say go with NANA.  It's definitely a 20's female-targeted anime and it's far from boring.  
>> ARTICLE
angel beats is pretty cool
>> ARTICLE
Agree. I'd start with a drama/comedy like Angel Beats, CLANNAD, or Toradora
>> ARTICLE
It depends on the girl, those are a bit too specific to show in such a premature state, first you bait her with Ghibli movies, then you move with her interests, Toradora is awesome but would someone this strange and reluctant to aniem enjoy it as quickly as "we" would? Hardly, it's mandatory that you go deep with her interests before giving the next step.
>> ARTICLE
well the reason i suggested angel beats is because it encompasses lots of genres: romance, comedy, drama, tragedy, action. it's difficult not to like it tbh
>> ARTICLE
But shouldn't it be better to go with something simple first? Of course that it must still be interesting.

The question should be more like, would a women really be into anime? Unless they have the interest for this type of thing wouldn't it be **really** hard for them to get into it? For example I'm not a sports person so even if I try to watch something that's interesting in some way for me it won't be as interesting as say anime wich I get really hyped up about. Then could we conclude that anime is more of a guy thing? Or is it made thinking more about them?
>> ARTICLE
Clannad ~~ and after story. 
Kannon. 
Id say pretty much anything from KEY.

Death Note - Code geass Is always (ALWAYS) a safe anime to tell people to watch. 


>> ARTICLE
Clannad is a must wathc for her than
>> ARTICLE
 If she's  willing to sit through 25 episodes of character development tell her to watch Clannad and Clannad AS. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah,I personally loved Clannad, though I feel like much of it is male-oriented. Any females here that actually worship Clannad like some of the dudes I know?
>> ARTICLE
 I dont see the male orientation you do; besides few parts such as the fighting.
>> ARTICLE
My sister enjoyed Clannad. She didn't shed a single tear though (said she doesn't cry unless she takes it personally), but she said her throat closed at the sad parts.


>> ARTICLE
Some worthy (IMHO) older stuff:

[Yawara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yawara!_A_Fashionable_Judo_Girl) about a girl expert in judo. It was pretty funny and definitely clean and non-pervy.

[Maison Ikkoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Ikkoku) was a great sort of comedy soap opera about a student and the young landlady he falls for.

>> ARTICLE
I second Maison Ikkoku. It might be a bit lengthy for an introduction but it's hard to argue with the classics.
>> ARTICLE
Shakugan no Shana and Xam'd The Lost Memories are ones I recommend to friends who show an interest in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Even better throw her a list with diffrent sections for each genre. Then she cant fault you for the one she chose.
>> ARTICLE
big fan of Love Hina. Romantic comedy with only.. moderate ecci
>> ARTICLE
Tatami Galaxy, Aoi Bungaku, Twelve Kingdoms. None of them are very laden with typical anime tropes.
>> ARTICLE
Me being a 27 year old woman... I have long been into anime since junior high school Sailor Moon was my gateway anime. I created a list of some of my favorite and good anime series that should eventually let her get into anime. 
Depending on what she's interested in, Personally my list of series anime to start someone off goes -

Kaichou wa Maid-sama!,
No. 6,
Vampire Knight,
Vampire Knight Guilty,
RahXephon,
Paradise Kiss,
Kaleido Star,

then maybe introduce

Fruits Basket,
Usagi Drop,
Ouran High School,

Of course if all else fails... just send her to a website that has as many of the anime options available and explain the different genre to her. You never know she might be into all the reverse harem and Ecchi type anime out there.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm a dude, but here's something I recommended to my sister and she enjoyed it:  
[5 centimeters per second](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4568)  
[ef - a tale of memories](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5274)  
[ef - a tale of melodies](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=6014)  
and she also liked [Nana](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4143), but I didn't see that, so can't give my opinion. The other 3 are romance. Probably my favs of the genre.
>> ARTICLE
Chi's Sweet Home. Women love cats :)
>> ARTICLE
As a female, the first "real" anime I watched (besides DBZ/Sailor Moon/Card Captor Sakura as a kid) was Ouran. I LOVED it, and after that I grew to watch all sorts of anime.
>> ARTICLE
Tokyo Godfathers - directed by Satoshi Kon.

Simple story line, light-hearted comedy but also quite serious. There are very few Japanese pop cultural references and could quite easily be a live-action Hollywood film. It's the one I always recommend to anime newbies because it shows that anime is a medium, NOT a genre. The animation style is very detailed and shows the mature side of anime, but also retains the slight wackiness that you find in a lot of anime. As a feature-length film, it is easy to finish in one sitting rather than a TV series, so all the stages of the story are told within 2 hours.

I also recommend the Ghibli films most of the time, but only if I think the person has some leanings towards sci-fi or fantasy already. Most of Miyazaki's films tend to be set in a magical universe quite different from our own and require a pretty open mind and suspense of belief to really immerse yourself in the film. I could imagine someone losing interest quite quickly because Miyazaki tends to be quite subtle in revealing things about the universe of his films, so paying attention from the start makes a whole lot of difference when enjoying his films.

EDIT: I'd personally avoid TV series until you confirm she's comfortable with watching anime films first. Anime TV shows are paced so that they last for several episodes and can sometimes feel like they drag a bit, which would be a tough sell to someone with a short-attention span.

The main thing is to make her realise how varied anime is. I say this over and over again, anime is not a genre, it's a form of entertainment media. Anime has many many very different genres and much like live-action films/TV can range from artistic masterpieces to pure shit. I think a lot of people can't get in to anime because they have this notion stuck in their head that animation = children's entertainment only.
>> ARTICLE
Miyazaki's stuff for sure.
>> ARTICLE
Clannad, Outlaw Star, Bleach, (if she likes fighting) Deadman WonderLand, (a bit iffy but just an amazing anime series.
>> ARTICLE
Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro. It's a great film, requires no real background knowledge of the story. Anyone can jump in and I would assume it is mature enough for her tastes. 

I'm not sure if this is available in all countries, [but it's on Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/watch/219524/the-castle-of-cagliostro).
>> ARTICLE
Try Soul Eater: It's funny but sometimes serious.
>> ARTICLE
Hajime no Ippo is pretty normal, although it is a boxing anime. Might go over well if she's a sportier girl, because training with dedication is pretty similar no matter what the sport.

Plus, it's just a well done show. I mean, I don't give a shit about boxing, and I love that show. (Yes I'm female)


Also... Maybe Planetes (if she likes space and/or character driven things) or Last Exile (steampunk adventure story)? Both have little to no fanservice and are well done.
>> ARTICLE
Show her The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, then tell her that the medium is able to express not only the beautiful and deep story that she just watched, but also brutal and intricate looks at the human psyche like Gantz, the fantasy of the Ghibli films, and the surrealism of Paprika.

Macross Zero or Macross Frontier. 

edit, I am also a female in her 20s. I started out with a weird anime, and wasn't really sure about the whole thing. Macross was accessible to me because it was sci fi and I was already a fan of that kind. If she's into sci fi I think that Macross F is easy to get into.

Deathnote. I know a few girls that started with Deathnote (mostly because I introduced their boyfriends to it). They got hooked on it and kept watching with their boyfriends and then moved on to more anime.

I can think of Ashiteru ze Baby, Usagi Drop, Midori Days, and Azumanga Daioh that a girl may want to watch.

Princess Jellyfish or Ika Musume!

I'm a 20 year old girl, and I just finished watching Lovely Complex, it was hilarious and there was nothing sexual about it.
>> ARTICLE
Having gotten several people fitting your description into anime, I would add to your list:

Arakawa Under The Bridge, Baccano!, Bakuman, Black Lagoon, Blue Exorcist, Cross Game, Darker Than Black, Dennou Coil, Durarara!!, Ergo Proxy, Ghost Hound, Haibane Renmei, Hellsing Ultimate, Honey & Clover, Kaichou wa Maid-sama, Katanagatari, Kimi ni Todoke, Lovely Complex, Major, Monster, Moyashimon, Mushishi, Natsume Yuujinchou, Nodame Cantabile, Outlaw Star, Soul Eater, Tiger and Bunny, Usagi Drop

I would avoid most of KEY's stuff since they are based off of VN's, but that's up to you. They're not bad, they can just give the wrong impression.
>> ARTICLE
Generally the safe assumption is if it's been Dubbed than it's probably okay without you looking like a pervert, the key stuff is good. big question is how much actual content are you looking for, a 12er season? 24? ongoing 50+? cause the pacing differs so much between all three that it can be offsetting if it isn't fast enough or annoying that information is being delivered to fast as alot of times happens in the 12 epers. 
>> ARTICLE
Show her episode 9 of One Piece.
>> ARTICLE
Umm I recently started as well... I feel like Death Note (as many others have probably said L is awesome) or Trigun would be really good starts. I watched Yu Yu Hakusho when it was on toonami, watched it last summer and found it even better. It's long at around 112 episodes but definitely consider it. 

Samurai Seven is really cool.

>> ARTICLE
Nichijou. If in doubt, always go with Nichijou. Everybody loves Nichijou. The few who claim they don't are mentally ill and most likely dangerous.

If she's into music, then Nodame Cantabile.
>> ARTICLE
Nichijou is good but too "otaku-bait" for the non-initiated.
>> ARTICLE
TBH I have had this problem about 7 times. Anime I have shown are, Gantz x2, Kiss x sis (ova), Eden of the east, Host club, TTGL, and Clannad. If you are worried about her judging you on what you show. It really doesnt matter what it is. Girls like all the stuff you like violence, sex, action. Hell one of the cutest little lesbos you will ever see excused herself mid episode of kiss x sis to play dj. It comes down to what kind of girl she is think of her personality and match it to an anime.

>> ARTICLE
It's true. Chicks love Koe de Oshigoto.
>> ARTICLE
Let her try a Miyazaki film such as Kiki's Delivery Service or take her to go see The Secret World of Arrietty. You said she gets bored easily and won't become hooked on anything if she starts to lose interest, and those movies are pointed at younger children with short attention spans. (Not to say that adults can't enjoy them just as much if not more.) It's perfect.

It is also worth noting that these are merely *movies* and not an *entire series*. This is good so she wont feel forced or obligated to watch anything more than a couple hours worth of content.

If that doesn't entertain her and get her interested in more anime, I don't know what will.

You could also try any of the other Miyazaki films, but I'd stay away from ones themed similarly to Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke. They might be a bit too... out there... for someone who isn't already interested in the specific genera.

Kokoro Connect (at least the first arc). The voice acting really sells it.

One of the only series in recent memory that I noticed how damn good the voice acting was.

Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal, but just that part.

The Melancholy of Haruhi.  The light novel was very mediocre, but the anime improved it in essentially every way.

Eh, the thing that holds the anime back is that there's a lot that hasn't been animated.

Weird. I thought that the novels were fantastic but that the anime was actually a step down. But it's and opinion so it's whatever...
>> ARTICLE
what season 2?
>> ARTICLE
I just starting reading the novels. Melancholy takes a while to hit it's stride but that makes more sense when you consider that it was written as a prequel to the syndicated short stories that eventually got collected into Boredom. 

I think kyoani did a better job of conveying the story (even if they took a huge risk in doing so), but the books do give a few interesting insights.

EDIT: I just *started* reading the novels.
>> ARTICLE
-Fate/Zero: To the best of my knowledge, Fate/Zero the anime is a mostly faithful adaptation of the light novels.  They got all the key points in but just changed a few details here and there.  I thought that ufotable's director and Yuki Kajiura's music added a lot to the story though.  At one point I wanted to see just how much of a faithful adaptation it was so I could talk about the differences in case this topic came up, but I got bored since the LN was basically exactly the same as the anime but without the awesome art, awesome fight animations, and Yuki Kajiura.  I'm also going to mention the Kara no Kyoukai movie series because ufotable basically did the same thing to this franchise.

-Bakemonogatari: Akiyuki Shinbou's quirky directing style made this extremely entertaining to watch.  He managed to make such a heavy dialogue-focused show really interesting by adding to the main focus of the show with really entertaining visuals instead of just letting the dialogue do all the work.

-Ghost in the Shell: I hate manga adaptations.  They have problems with animation, cinematography, and of course, the notorious story problems via cliffhanger endings.  Fortunately, GitS suffers from none of these problems.  Solid animation, music, voice acting, and generally, everything that's great about anime is done right in this series.  To top it off, it's episodic, so they don't have to worry about cliffhanger endings - it never ends!

Speaking of fate/zero, the Kara no Kyoukai movies were way better than the books

Yeah, I included that with Fate/Zero since production-wise, they're so similar - faithful adaptations of the source material with ufotable's great director and yuki kajiura.

I haven't read the KnK LNs myself but my friend who has says that the anime is an extremely faithful adaptation and I love the music and art, so I'd say the movies are better than the books too.

Have you read Bake's source material? The LN is absolutely amazing especially with the way it is written in Japanese.

there aren't many (non-japanese) people that can enjoy untranslated original *monogatari LNs.

Howl's Moving Castle was better then the book, but the book is pretty rarely read so it'll probably be hard for most of you to judge.

Kara no Kyoukai is significantly better than the light novels.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I love the movie of Howl, but the novel is so much more intricate. It's a great movie, but an absolutely brilliant novel. So much of the amazing world is totally glossed over, and there's that whole nonsense about Howl turning into a bird, and man, the book was just amazing.
>> ARTICLE
>the book is pretty rarely read

I wouldn't be sure about that. I mean, it's no Harry Potter, but Diana Wynne Jones was a pretty well known author and won more than a couple awards for her work.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I've read a lot of her books, but her other ones are way more popular than Howl's Moving Castle/Castle in the Air. Chrestomanci especially.
>> ARTICLE
Lucky Star and Azumanga Daioh.
>> ARTICLE
I greatly prefer the original manga of AzuDai. The anime cut out content for the sake of random shots of Chiyo's dad flying around and awkwardly long pauses. (On the other hand, it did have an amazing soundtrack.)
>> ARTICLE
Funny. Azumanga Daioh is one of the few manga that I actually prefer to the anime.
>> ARTICLE
Azumanga the Animation works better in it's original format of shorts, rather than the full episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely, I feel like yonkoma manga often work much more successfully as an anime. 

You can add Joshiraku, Seitokai Yakuindomo, and K-on! to the list of adapted yonkoma manga that are better as an anime.
>> ARTICLE
man this really is a LOT harder than naming shows that are worse than their source material
>> ARTICLE
Actually I've thought pretty much every good anime that I've both seen the anime and read the manga of was better as an anime. I think it comes down to the limitations of manga as a story-telling medium. An anime is much better at showing action and basically any physical interactions between the characters. Manga also has limited space for dialogue, which when combined with the difficulty of portraying action hinders character development. On a more personal level, anime is in color which heightens the immersion and vastly increases enjoyment for me.

It's different for novels because they're such a different medium from movies/anime. There's so much more space for EVERYTHING in a novel, from description to lore to dialogue to showing the inner thoughts of the characters. And if the author writes well, you lose very little in terms of the depth of the mental imagery it allows you to create. Manga destroys this mental imagery while not gaining much story development or characterization. The drawing is usually rather sparse, so you actually lose scene detail compared to what is possible in prose.

As far as specific anime, I thought Bleach was much better as an anime than as a manga (not that I would recommend either to anyone). The drawings were way too confusing for me to be able to follow any of the fight scenes.
>> ARTICLE
As a counter... manga leaves more to the imagination, so it isn't as "spoonfed" as an anime. I feel you have to concentrate more and flip back pages and such when reading. I'd also say that the manga for bleach is a lot better than the show. Filler arcs. A manga also costs less to produce, so more ideas can be put into writing than, say spending hundreds of thousands on well animating an idea
>> ARTICLE
Mushi-shi was really great with color. Bit hard to say if it's that much better though, since the original manga was so well done.
>> ARTICLE
I think the big deal here was that it was a very faithful adaption, from plot to art style.

Call me a philistine, but if the level of art is the same then I'll take the motion picture version of a story any day.
>> ARTICLE
An oft-overlooked series in general, but I thought the anime for Sasameki Koto was, in some ways, a lot better than the manga. Although it was frustrating that they didn't get far enough in the adaptation to hit any major developments, the anime still had a lot better... atmosphere, I guess is the way to put it. That sort of laid back, calm school life vibe. I think the one of the biggest contributors to this efect was the music. I mean, just listen to [that OP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZEEdXzmixI). So relaxing.

The biggest thing though (and this goes for pretty much every manga/LN -> anime adaptation) is the pacing. Not the large scale kind of pacing between major events, I'm talking about the small scale pacing. What I mean is that the pace at which you physically read a manga or LN is a very variable thing. There's nothing there feeding you the sentences or panels at a set rate, you just read it at whatever pace you read it at. Maybe you subconsciously speed up a bit sometimes, maybe you slow down a bit. In the end, you don't really get a solid sense of *time* in the story. But when you go to an anime, there is a set flow of time. Maybe this doesn't matter as much for more action focused stories and such, but when you've got a story that tries to portray this laid back or calm kind of day-to-day school life, it can make a big difference. You feel that calming mood much more when the pace has been fixed to a slower rate like that.

Or at least that's my two cents. Maybe I'm making no sense.

I prefer the manga. They pretty much ruined [this](http://i.minus.com/ib16DslGVzsrDm.png) scene, imo.
>> ARTICLE
I can think of many anime that are slightly better than the original because of the great animations and music, but here is a few that improved the original work imo. 

Soul Eater. Sure, the anime only ending was terrible, but the manga got worst. 

Usagi Drop for the same reason you listed (fuck this ending). I really hope we wont get a 2nd season.

Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.  Shaft's magic was at its best for this one in my opinion. 

School Rumble. I wish I hadn't read the manga, it was such a clusterfuck toward the end. 




>> ARTICLE
I liked the Bones ending for Soul Eater. It had crazy city sized mechs, for crying out loud. What's to dislike? 
>> ARTICLE
There was many loose ends that made the anime feel incomplete,  but what bothered me the most was the flow that was different from the rest of the series.  It's been a while since I watched, but I remembered not liking these episodes before learning they were part of the normal story simply because they didn't have the same feel as the rest.
>> ARTICLE
Helsing. 

First of all, I thought there was less emphasis on the gore and tits from the manga. The overall campiness was toned down significantly.
Secondly, it had this great paramilitary aspect and scenes, that are very hard to come by in anime. 
Finally, as I found out after reading the manga, nearly all the cool quotes were anime original. 
I realize I'm in the minority here, otherwise I doubt there would have been a remake series to make the anime more faithful to the manga.

For the purposes of this discussion, I agree with the OP. Simply by omitting the second half of the manga, the theme of the anime is completely different and more enjoyable.


For those that have only read spoilers about the manga ending and not the manga itself: I don't think reading it will change your mind. However, it is handled in away that is not gross or pandering to the niche you think it is.


upvotes to this whole tree for discussion!
>> ARTICLE
After staying up to 3am last night I read and finished the manga from the beginning of the second half to the end.

I have to say that the theme and genre changes a lot in the second half going from just slice of life to slice of life & romance. 

It also loses a lot of that heart warming feel as Rin just isn't a child anymore and because there is a lot more romantic conflict. 

You could say that this is inevitable because they are now teenagers in high school however I personally would have been a lot happier with a couple pages worth of pictures album style of Daikichi and Rin growing up with friends, at events, and moments in their life rather than the second half of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
You know, I didn't particularly like the ending. It weirded me out, and the whole [bullshit](/s "oh Daikichi isn't actually related to Rin after all thing") was such a damn deus ex machina.

But it's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. It's not like [stuff](/s "he raped her or took advantage or anything like that, and because of bad writing, it's not even incest.")

I'd have to be hard-pressed to admit this but I kind of think that, due to the great voice actors, animation, production quality and music, Berserk may be just slightly better than the manga, although it was noticeably censored. Though, admittedly, if you look at my nickname you may see that I am a bit biased towards it.

(I'm imagining what kind of "wtf" expression a person might have on their heads if they go watch the first episode right now and think to themselves "Wait a second, this is *censored*?!?!?!?")

I'm not sure if the anime adaptation of Twelve Kingdoms is better than the books, but I really hope everyone here has seen it.

I [bookmarked a list](http://imgur.com/gallery/5sCUe) with "mature" anime in it, and while talking with a friend that hasn't seen much anime he frowned when i was giving him this list when he saw the artstyle of Kaiba, completely dismissing it for its childish looks. I realised then that him being a very casual watcher, he is the embodiment of what anime industry is catering towards, and since people like him are the majority, the industry has to adapt to produce that sort of content.  
Mind you, he's a great guy and i'm not dismissing his tastes, but mature anime is most of the time an acquired taste, and anime industry doesn't have the budget to produce this kind of anime as the expenses are really high.  
Just a rant so that the posts aren't all about shining dicks

Michiko & Hatchin is just fun above everything else.  
Same for Baccano!, the mafia and heavy elements aren't explored as much.

And as mentioned Haruhi, which is also just fun, there is proper character drama, I'm sure, but it's the movie that encapsulates the coming of age attitude.

Outside of semantics, an extremely solid list, add Legend of the Galactic Heroes and you'll be golden.

>> ARTICLE
Melancholy probably not mature, but surely most would consider Disappearance a very mature film no?


>> ARTICLE
I guess. However, I feel that the mature themes are not as overt as the other shows on that list.

Granted, it's been a while since I've watched Haruhi, but while watching it I never felt like it was something incredibly mature.
>> ARTICLE
Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending Melancholy as a mature show (or even a particularly good show.), but give the film another watch.  

You'd be surprised by how sombre in tone it is and how well it handles its plot.  It's an amazing character study on Kyon, who after bitching for months about how he wants a normal life without Haruchi, and when he finally gets just that, how he stops at nothing to get his old crazy life back.  

*The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya* is still in my top 10 anime films to this day, and is definitely a mature film.
>> ARTICLE
I think that we are getting off track here

I agree that Disappearance is great and it has great tone. My point is: the themes of maturity carried by the show is not on the same level of others which I consider *top shelf* in terms of maturity. It doesn't deal with war ethics, deep philosophy, psychoanalysis, parenthood, or other such things.

In summary, and I can't stress this enough **Disappearance was a good movie and was mature**. However, it was not on the level of something like say... Serial Experiments Lain
>> ARTICLE
I guess at this point it's argument on how you judge the maturity of themes. I would argue that while yes topics like war ethics and parenthood are more inherently mature,   Disappearances themes of being honest with oneself and finding yourself in tough situations can be just as impactful/mature provided they're handled well.

But I can definitely see where your coming from, it's harder to do something like war ethics correctly.  So when it's done right I can understand judging it to be more mature, it is a theme about humans at there worst after all.

On an unrelated note, holy fuck do I ever love *Serial Experiments Lain*'s OP. Thank you for reminding me of that song.

Frankly, I find the obsession over whether or not a series is considered mature to be immature by itself.  The actual mature thing to do is to watch whatever *you* want to watch, without worrying about how others might perceive your tastes.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you but I'd add some caveats: confidently watching whatever you want to watch doesn't automatically make you a mature person and knowing how to judge what you watch is also important.

Sometimes I'll watch things that I know have very little in terms of depth and far too much in terms of gratuitous spectacle, but I'm also aware of this fact. Not considering for yourself what a show has to offer besides spectacle is not immature per se but I think it detracts from a full viewing experience.
>> ARTICLE
All aboard the maturity train. Choo Choo!

But seriously, maybe some examine the "maturity" of a work because they're obsessed over what people think of them, but I think it's also entirely possible to ask these questions as an act of introspection, which is a pretty neat thing for people to do. Just because immature people do something, doesn't mean doing it is immature.
>> ARTICLE
I think your opinion on maturity is immature
>> ARTICLE
Kinda hard when panty shots are shoved in your face...
>> ARTICLE
In my opinion fan service doesn't automatically rule out a show as mature. It could still have lots of mature themes and plot lines that deal with real things. In fact the tits and ass wrapping could be hiding a very intriguing plot possibly.
>> ARTICLE
So much more probable in manga/doujinshi, than in anime made and consumed for escapism.

And of course, it depends on the presentation and execution of said fanservice as well.
>> ARTICLE
Then don't watch harems and fanservice shows?  Most of the shows where the fanservice is "shoved in your face" are very upfront from the beginning that that's what they're going to be.  Hell, most of them you can tell from the poster and synopsis.  And it's not like those type of show is the majority, either.  I'm watching 21 airing shows, and the only ones like that are Duo (obvious upfront harem show), Ange (blatant fanservice shots from the first minute) and Dog Days (first couple of seasons had tons of fanservice).  And Maria to a somewhat lesser extent, but that was very upfront even from the *title* about it's sexual themes.  That's still the vast majority of shows I'm watching with minimal if any fanservice.

Unless you're talking about occasional fanservice shots out of nowhere in a non-fanservice show, but if that bugs you that much, I'm not sure what to tell you.  For me it's just...there.  Whatever.  Ignore it and move on.
>> ARTICLE
I am very adamant when it comes to a show's tone, if I see sexual fanservice that does not serve a good point to the character and/or narrative presentation, of course it will bug the hell out of me, unless that's the point, though that requires more awareness and writing/directing skill 

Death Parade was pretty fucking serious up now, but it relegated to panty jokes, I watch Dog Days as a light kids show because everything suggest that it is and then BAM, here's butts and titties in case you missed them! 

The nudity in Yoru no Yatterman actually fit and it was awkward in an intentional manner, it wasn't loli service. Maria shows nudity in a respectful manner and deviance is treated as a serious aspect of every character that shows it. 

And lastly, freaking JoJo: a pig toilet, the baby stand, but its sexual fanservice moments are more like more like a male gaze than being overtly blatant.

And it's much less about which are mature and which aren't, it's about what the hell do others see in what you're watching... it's not that I care about other's opinions too much, but it's that I value them as a valid input(like yours, which I'm too well aware of anyway).
>> ARTICLE
>I am very adamant when it comes to a show's tone, if I see sexual fanservice that does not serve a good point to the character and/or narrative presentation, of course it will bug the hell out of me,

This is just IMO, but I think this kind of tonal variance is one of the last and hardest things to get over that is actually s cultural/fundamental storytelling difference, but we don't usually view it that way. It's weird when you're not used to it for the tone in a serious series to shift like that, often really quickly, but you see it time and time again because it's just an OK part of telling a story in anime. In that way I don't see how it's a bad thing. 
>> ARTICLE
I never said tonal variance is bad, it's a bad thing when it's jarring and has little to no transition. Don't tell me Baccano!/Durarara do it badly and Gundam G no Reconguista is amazing in comparison when it comes to that.

It also has to do with shows being consistent within their own framework. Death Parade was consistent in terms of its directing and aesthetic, but the focus was completely different and contrary to what was already established and shown before(*the darkness of the human soul!*). I'm not against it being entertaining this way, I'm against it sacrificing whatever little it had going, but at this point of not knowing what the hell to do, might as well make it fun for what it's worth, and that just leaves me disappointed.

I bet you don't like Shigatsu's instant comedic chibi skits in the face of the melodrama it revels in.

It's not just about differences and styles, it's about having a holistic vision of what your work represents and communicates to the viewer.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunately I haven't watched any of the examples you're using, and I don't want to make a definitive argument or anything because I consider this to be pretty much just opinion, but when I say I don't see how it's a bad thing, I'm talking about tonal variance that has an elegant transition (which obviously isn't a bad thing) AND "jarring" variance. 

>It also has to do with shows being consistent within their own framework. Death Parade was consistent in terms of its directing and aesthetic, but the focus was completely different and contrary to what was already established and shown before(the darkness of the human soul!).

Again, haven't seen it so I'm just going on what I'm imagining from your description. If DP set up a theme for the story and then never returned to it, yeah that's pretty bad and misleading to the viewer, but I don't think that's really a common thing. More likely is that there were lighthearted segments, possibly jarring and long ones, that didn't focus on the main themes of show/actual main plot. Again just opinion, but I don't necessarily consider that a bad thing. It's almost become a story structure in and of itself to introduce characters seriously with a real theme, forgo all of that during many parts of the meat of the show, and then bring the plot back towards the end after spending time in the other parts. I wouldn't call that "sacrificing" anything, I would call it having a story that sets up one part of itself, but also has a very distinct other, ultimately resulting in a different whole than certainly you expected/wanted, and is less "focused". Generally we use "unfocused" as a negative. But is it necessarily that? I say no. 

>It's not just about differences and styles, it's about having a holistic vision of what your work represents and communicates to the viewer.

How about a vision of a multi-faced story that only takes itself seriously *sometimes*?
>> ARTICLE
Well, I'm glad you understood my perspective, I may be pedantic about things, but really so long as a show presents itself properly and doesn't contradict said presentation it's OK in my book.

> How about a vision of a multi-faced story that only takes itself seriously *sometimes*?

That's what Baccano! and Durara take to the extreme that you can't pin down what it's really going for aside from: everything is damn cool!

Being pedantic is fine, especially if it causes interesting discussion :)

The Death Parade scene in question was definitely not 'fan service', it was a joke based on the character's personality. Only a few minutes later a male teen idol's clothes explode as a result of his sheer willpower... they both had little to do with pandering, the entire episode had a comedic undertone to it.

Getting upset simply because a joke involves a character's undergarments is actually quite childish.
>> ARTICLE
It's contrary to the presentation the show had set up for itself. Don't get me wrong it was fun due to the directing style, but it made it more clear that the writer has no freaking idea what to do with the series.

Hardly. Like I said, the entire episode had a comedic undertone, making it quite obvious they intended the episode to be a break from the fairly serious ones. The writers clearly understand what they are doing.

Your right the girls death was the thing that solidified the satirical manner of the episode, for fuck sake she died from slipping on a bar of soap.

[Rated M for Money](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForMoney) is in full effect here. A lot of younger people (and some older ones) want to believe they consume media above their age level, and it's easy for creators to give them what they think they want in the form of sex, violence, and cynicism. 

If a teenager praises shows like Wolf Children or Haibane Renmei, I'm going to be hella impressed and think of them as being rather mature for their age; if a teenager praises a show like Elfen Lied or Gantz for anything other than it's T&A and bloodbaths, I'm going to think they are at or below the maturity level for their age.

I understand that most people (at my age group at least) do not like or care for these kinds of shows, but I just wish I would have more people of my age to talk to about these kind of shows. Which is why I hang around here... My days of trying to get my mature, deep, philosophical anime loving friends to watch anything deeper than Elfen Lead have ended a while ago...

>> ARTICLE
First, I don't feel used or anything. You opened up about something that makes you feel bad, please don't apologize for that.

Second, I'm going to try really hard not to sound like every adult I ever asked for help from when I was a teenager; I wasn't young so long ago that I can't remember insensitive and dismissive things like, "I know it feels like the end of the world..." sound. So, I promise that I'm actually going to give you advice, and not just tell you you'll feel stupid or petty about this when your older. With that in mind, it is really, really normal for you to feel like that.

Having escaped high school largely unscathed (although I didn't feel that way at the time), and able to look at that institution from the outside, I can say this; high school is an almost perfectly designed tool for making young people feel marginalized. In my school, as I'm sure in yours, there were jocks, brains, and drama queens (artistic types would be a kinder phrase); those are actual labels that people applied, verbatim, to themselves and others. Amongst the jocks you had the big stupid wrestlers and football players (which isn't true in either case, although I believed it then) and the more *refined* gymnasts and soccer players; brains pursued either maths and sciences or history and literature; and drama queens were either theatre or music, which divided even further into band, orchestra, and choir. The lines drawn in the sand at your school might not be the same as the ones drawn at mine, but I'm sure they are just as divisive.

What I'm trying to say, is that **you should try and focus on what you have in common with your peers, instead of how your different; because if you focus on the differences, you'll go crazy.** It can be an uphill battle sometimes, but it's really worth it.

Akame ga Kill! was flawed in so many ways, this being one of them. It's sort of funny because you could see multiples themes present in the anime that had the potential to bud mature commentary, but it was never executed or touched upon any further than face value.

I wouldn't really call it mature since it doesn't really bother with its morality, not to mention it just feels damn edgy, but in a surprisingly good way thanks to its directing prowess.

The original writer did show respect to the topics at hand, even if only to properly execute the schemes in mind.

No closure. Also, the sex and gore can at certain times feel a bit forced. Monster doesn't have that problem. It is just fantastic storytelling.

I'd rather you address why:

- Being a casual viewer is "bad"
- "Mature" anime will always be better than almost everything else
- If the series you're watching is harem there's no way it can be mature
- Maturity of the content in animated fiction is the most important thing when rating

Because it's what I always see on these subreddits. You can even see on this thread some of the things I'm talking about.
>> ARTICLE
Teenagers getting all bent out of shape about Maturity.

I will watch my silly little comedies interspersed with a bloodbath and enjoy myself.  Maturity is knowing to turn off for the night so you can wake up and get to work without being a zombie.
>> ARTICLE
I watch what I want. Some shows are boring and mature. Some are exciting. All I know is that mostly 99% of the time if an Anime has nudity, ecchi kind of shit that means it is shit.
>> ARTICLE
Why do I feel like yours is the best answer I've seen so far?
>> ARTICLE
1. It isn't. It's just that elite viewers tend to value the opinion of other elites more. I tend to value an elite's opinion more because I myself am an elite. The main difference is the more you watch the higher your bar for quality goes.

2. They aren't. Mature anime are better when you want something mature. Immature anime are just fine, in fact I even gave a rec for one. The issue is when an immature tries to act as if it is mature, and in doing so cripples itself by attempting to be something it isn't.

3.  Harem's aren't always immature, it's just less common for a harem to be mature because of the secondary focus on a romcom. It's not a guarantee, just a strong correlation. There certainly are mature harem's, they're just more common in manga.

4. It isn't. Again, the issue arises when immature things try to act as if they are mature. Realistically there is no "most important thing", as the focus of each anime can vary greatly. A character based anime can have a shit plot, but if something is story-based a shit plot is crippling. Of course having everything great is preferable, but it depends on what the focus of the anime is as to what is most important. 
>> ARTICLE
1. But what if the bar for the anime I watch lowers the more I spend time watching? In the past I frowned at everything mainstream. Now I appreciate the mainstream more than before. Does that make me elite or casual? My gateways to anime were Tosho Daimos and Cat's Eye, now I'm watching things like DxD and To Love ru.

2. True enough.

3. But the issue of a harem is mature enough by itself. In connection to what you said about your suggestion, does that mean that series with mature premises are immature if they deal about it in a comedic way? If so, does this make it a detraction to the series as a whole?

4. I love you. You're one of the few "elites" who have different criteria for different anime. Lots of people on here just have one size fits all criteria.

Adding onto this, truly mature themes and subjects can be kind of hard for kids/young teenagers to differentiate.

So an easy metric to decide whether or not you can properly distinguish between an anime trying to be mature or an anime that is actually being mature is to watch Welcome to the NHK.

If that anime isn't one of the scariest things you've ever watched, or gives you nightmares, congratulations! You're capable of distinguishing between faux-mature and truly mature anime!

I'm going to throw a curve ball and say Eureka 7. [Themes with spoiler tag just in case](/s "It deals with the very real themes of growing up from a child to an adult, facing your problems head on instead of running away, death, love and loss.") The world building is well done and the show relies on the characters that inhabit it to drive the plot, the mecha fights are just a bonus. I think this is a good case of a mature shounen (out of all the shounen I have seen I would label this the most mature). My opinion might be just a little bit biased though because this is my favorite anime ;)
>> ARTICLE
I think both of your examples work well here.

AkG is as you describe: a show that tries to use its "mature" content to entice people to watch it and enjoy it. It's not so much for older audiences, despite the rampant blood and gore, because it doesn't tackle the ideas in presents in a dignified manner.

I like your Usagi Drop example as well. It's one I rate rather highly, because it not only nailed it pretty much across the board, but also resonates with me and my personality. As an anime *designed* for the older crowd, with its literal adult content and topics, it's mature without having to resort to more "R-rated" tactics (drugs, violence, sex, etc.)

Edit: As some "food for thought," Kill la Kill, while serious-yet-not-serious in its presentation, still contains "maturity" not only in what it shows (boobs and butts) but also in its accessibility. That is, many newcomers to the medium wouldn't normally choose Kill la Kill as their first show, instead viewing it after "maturing" in their anime watching. The show doesn't contain adult/meaningful themes, but the argument that it supports the idea that "mature content == mature anime" is rather valid.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, your referring to Seinen and Josei. These demographics are aimed at an 18+ audience. This does not necessarily mean they contain mature content, it just means that the story will be enjoyed more by older audiences. Generally, this means the main characters will be older, and the storyline will generally contain more sophisticated themes and intellectual plot. In action-oriented seinen, you will actually see less action-focused scenes in favor of plot-driven scenes, like in Fate/Zero. 

Chihayafuru is also an example of a Josei (the female equivalent of Seinen), which does not actually contain "mature content". Usagi Drop, which you've mentioned, is also Josei. 

Then you'll see other manga like Akame Ga Kill!, that seem to contain "mature content", but are very much so Shounen. 
>> ARTICLE
Can we not make this a demographic mix and match? Please?

Everything OP said can and should be applied to every genre, medium, and target demo. The best children's stories tend to be those that don't treat their audience like stupid, partially formed adults, and the best adult stories tend be those that don't treat adults like kid's who are now able to appreciate higher volumes of sex, violence, swearing, and angst.

Sweet, I needed my raunchy juvenile fix after the author took a break from the Prison School manga (recommended to anyone laughs at dirty jokes handled extremely childishly serious). Picked up Blade Play.

A show can have mature content and a immature storyline and its still mature. At least by guidelines of what people find "acceptable" for children to watch. I have an 10 year old cousin and I her parents most definitely wouldn't want her watching Akame ga Kill. 

I completely get what you're trying to say here but when talking about mature media the main focus when giving the rating is language, suggestive theme, sexual content, and violence. The subject matter plays a role but not that strong of one. Just look at how games, movies, and tv shows are rated. 
>> ARTICLE
>I completely get what you're trying to say here but when talking about mature media the main focus when giving the rating is language, suggestive theme, sexual content, and violence. 

I don't think you do get what I'm trying to say. I'm not talking about ratings at all, I'm talking about the idea of maturity. It's like when talking about the maturity of people when not referring to age. It's about what they do, how they think, and how they act, not how many years they've been alive.
>> ARTICLE
> guidelines of what people find "acceptable" for children 

^ Thats why I put that into my comment. I know you were saying what is really a mature show. What you're talking about just isn't acceptable with in what society finds mature. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's take OP's example of Usagi Drop. You could show this show to a child without problems, there's no nudity or violence in it. But would a child be entertained by it as much an adult would? A child wouldn't understand the struggles the main character goes through, how he's having to change his life because all of a sudden he's the guardian of a young girl. For an adult it hits much closer to home.

Meanwhile shows like AgK have simple themes and storylines that even a child could understand, and they're only considered mature because of the tits and gore. That's what OP is talking about.
>> ARTICLE
I understood what he was saying in the very beginning. My point was that train of thought doesn't resonate well with the mainstreams definition of what mature is. 
>> ARTICLE
You're still completely missing the point. You're thinking about "mature" as in what is acceptable for children and what isn't. What I'm saying holds 0 relevance on what is acceptable for children to watch and what isn't. I'm not even lightly touching on that point.

What I'm talking about is what makes an anime mature in so far as it has themes best understood by mature people. It's not about ratings at all, I don't care about that. It's about what people refer to as mature thematically. It's like when you say a child is mature. You're not saying their an adult, you're saying that they act like an adult. I'm not saying what anime is and isn't acceptable, I'm talking about what presents mature themes well. Acceptability isn't relevant.
>> ARTICLE
Mature storyline or themes. I understand that. You're talk about what makes it mature as far as subject matter? Right? I know you're NOT talking about ratings.

Anime tends to attract young viewers (teenagers), and they're going to through their try-hard phase of life. That means not giving a FUCK about anything. Wearing all black and fighting the MAN. 

Mix in some exotic cartoons like Cowboy Bebop, watching it late at night on ADULT Swim for that extra air of taboo, and you have a potent mix of fanboyism that'll scream about how MATUUURE and COOOL their show is. I never witness adults defending their shows like that. It's no wonder they'll latch onto the most superficial aspects of a show like the blood and violence and sex.

Is it a surprise [Hellsing Ultimate is ranked #44](http://myanimelist.net/anime/777/Hellsing_Ultimate)?

I was the all-black wearing teen weeaboo in the early-to-mid 00s. I ended up getting burnt out, and from 2007-2014 I didn't watch any anime.

Uh, no, it does pretend to be more than schlock. Did you not notice those pretentiously boring 10 minute speeches everyone gave? It also didn't help that Alucard was infinitely stronger than his enemies so the action was dull.

It's action scene after action scene with a paper thin plot.

I assume you have never seen the circlejerk over popular tv shows such as game of thrones and archer. 

Adults will defend their shows just as readily as teen but the thing is their shows usually don't need defending because for the most part everyone likes it. I remember describing my dislike for Game of Thrones and it was like I just admitted to killing a puppy. Online and irl reactions. People never grow up. They just get more responsibilities.

>First thing to note is I am only talking about the first portion of this manga. I'm not saying the second part is bad, but it isn't the focus of this discussion.

I stopped reading there. Can't take a guy seriously when he chooses such picky examples, specially when he's trying to be serious, you are simply riding on Karma points at this point.
>> ARTICLE
Would you like me to discuss the second portion? The only reason I neglected it is because of the focus shift and I didn't want to lengthen an already fairly long short essay. There's also the fact that that portion was never adapted into anime, and thus a large portion of it would be spoilers for those who haven't read it. However if you really want to I'm more than willing.

[Everything beyond this point could be considered spoilers for the unadapted portions of Usagi Drop. I'm tagging everything from this point on simply for ease of use on my part, and for aesthetics.](/s "The second half of Usagi Drop shifts the focus from the parental relationship Daikichi has with Rin to a focus on both her feelings as a 'daughter' in love with a parent and his feelings as a 'parent' who must address her. Regardless of the fact that this portion of the manga has received much criticism for abandoning it's previous tone of a slice of life revolving around the difficulties of parenting, it still tastefully address it's new themes. The crucial struggle in this section is the fact that Daikichi sees Rin as his daughter, yet Rin never saw him as a father and now sees him as an object of affection. The maturity in this comes from the fact that it presents both sides of the conflict realistically. Daikichi is a character that many parents could relate to as he cares deeply for Rin, yet he isn't always confident in what is the proper way to care for her and her needs. He has to seek help from others multiple times and devotes much of his life, even after she grows older, to raising her. He isn't an ideal parent as he still makes mistakes, but he's relatable in a way that parent's themselves would understand. Rin touches more on the emphatic hearts of young women who can comprehend her love for a man who does not love her the same way, and her own struggles with the taboo aspect of it.")

[Still spoilers](/s "In case the maturity of the second half hadn't been made clear in that brief paragraph, I will quickly summarize. The second half of Usagi Drop, while different, maintains the quality of presentation and maturity of the themes from the first. It is still designed for an older crowd and does so without using mature content. The only difference between the first and second parts is the shift of focus from a one-way relationship of Daikichi's parently feelings towards Rin, to a two-way relationship in which the focus is split between both of their feelings.")

If you'd like me to elaborate more just let me know. My response might be slow however, since it's getting late over here.
>> ARTICLE
The reason why I highly disliked the fact you didn't want to talk about the Usagi drop manga was because I couldn't shake off the feeling that you were just trying to Karma whore by talking down on an anime that everyone hates and praising an anime everyone loves (of course, without touching the part everyone hates) in your original post. The whole point of this post is informative and I'm totally cool with that, you just chose two poor examples.
>> ARTICLE
> trying to Karma whore by talking down on an anime that everyone hates and praising an anime everyone loves

Well, first of all, self-posts don't give karma to the poster (as if that mattered) 

Second of all, would you have liked him to choose a show that people liked/people hated respectively as his examples? That would just get him called an 'edgelord'...

>without touching the part everyone hates

but that's the thing. The anime itself is only an adaptation of the first half of the **manga** (not *anime*)

I haven't watched Akame ga Kill, but it just sounds as though you're bitching on it to me. I think mature audiences and mature themes are both too subjective and you've still just divided arbitrarily based on your views about what constitutes "mature". 

Esentially it sounds like you're saying, Akame ga Kill has bad writing and is therefore, not a mature anime, that's not really how it works. A comparison I'd make is with Star Trek: Next Generation, it's got exactly the same things as akame ga kill, as generally everyone is either good or evil and there are barely any inbetweens, but I wouldn't call it an "immature" show and I don't think many people would.

What I think you demonstrate well is that the label "mature" can't actually really be used as a description of shows at all in either themes or writing.

P.S I only just woke up (8am here) so this might not be the best written thing.

Comparing a modern day 2 cour anime to a 30 year old tv show that went on for years isn't a good comparison. TV has evolved a lot since then and what wasnt considered a standard trope back then may be now.

>> ARTICLE
Well I think that only furthers my point, an objective description wouldn't change over time, so it is a subjective division. If "mature" was something tangible the same things would be mature now as then.

On the other hand, I could also just pick a more modern example, Stargate SG-1 or Star Trek: Voyager for example.
>> ARTICLE
For a show such as TNG, which is often steeped in social commentary, its age and the time of its creation very much is a factor.  What was considered shockingly progressive 25 years ago may seem commonplace or even a bit backwards now.  That it attempts to, and more often than not succeeds to, properly articulate those questions and quandaries is what puts it in a position to be considered reasonably mature at least.

Akame ga Kill doesn't really share those same qualities.  To start, I'm not even wholly convinced it *wants* to have any serious conversations about morality or anything of the sort.  That all may just be something fans of the manga attributed to it after the fact.  Gods know nothing in the show substantiates a coherent moral, ethical, or philosophical view for pretty much any of the characters.  It could be that it was never intended to be more that what it is: pulpy, action and gore schlock.

If it *is* meant to be something more, though, it fails completely.  And it really doesn't resemble TNG even passingly in its attempts.  In TNG, most episodes aren't about being morally ambiguous, but rather presenting a pretty clear Aesop that usually correlates to a real world, relatable issue.

Take for example the episode "The Measure of a Man", in which a Starfleet scientist attempts to remove the android Data from his post on the Enterprise so he can be used for experimentation and study, on the grounds that Data is Starfleet property rather than an autonomous being with individual rights.  While it addresses the obvious philosophical questions of what makes a person a "person", it also provides legitimate counterarguments that, although eventually overcome, ultimately make the final arguments in favor of Data's personhood all the more impactful.  The episode has a very specific message it wants to impart, but the "bad guy" doesn't feel like a complete straw man built just to take a dive.  Granted, this is TNG at its very best.  It's a long series that had many people writing for it over its seven year run, so there are more than a few hamfisted broken Aesops included.  Even so, those are more the exception than the rule.  All in all, TNG averages out to be more poignant than most, but stays at a level that's easily relatable and enjoyable for those that aren't necessarily there for the commentary.

On the other hand, Akame ga Kill can't even figure out if it wants to be ambiguous or present a clear message.  In the second(?) episode, the protagonists clearly state that despite fighting to free the subjugated masses by assassinating people that abuse power to maim, kill, and generally cause suffering for those beneath them, they are ultimately murderers and what they do is an evil means to an end.  Sounds good, right?  Leaves plenty of room for, as OP said, gray and grey questions of morality where neither side is wholly right or entirely wrong.

Two things.  Firstly, the assassination targets are almost all so ridiculously evil that they aren't recognizable as human beings.  None of them are given even as much as a breath of explanation for why they rape, murder, and/or pillage.  They simply exist as sneering, cackling sacks of pure black evil for the good guys to eliminate.

Secondly, the protagonists that so dramatically declared the unenviable nature of their actions never again spare a thought toward the aforementioned evil deeds they commit.  It raises the point once, and promptly forgets about it in favor of the main character obsessing over protecting his friends for the rest of the series.

Combine it with Akame ga Kill's fascination with death and gore for its own sake and a lack of any cohesive themes (moral or otherwise), and you get a show that is both poorly written and fairly immature.  It comes across like a middle schooler spitballing a bunch of "Wouldn't it be cool if..." ideas and "adult" concepts, but lacks a decent understanding of how the real world or real people work to tie it all together into something relatable and meaningful.

TL;DR: Akame ga Kill and Star Trek: TNG are not even remotely comparable in any meaningful ways.

I love the absolute shit out of Next Generation, and I will stand up high and say it's not particularly mature. There is a **big** difference between not being mature, and being immature.
>> ARTICLE
This is a valid point, but I don't think OPs definition leaves enough wiggle room for this and I still think that the term "mature" is too subjective to be a good description on a critical level.
>> ARTICLE
Why? It's pretty hard to deny that creators are attempting to sell their works by virtue of being "mature" and equally hard to dismiss the fact that people are falling for it. Even if it's true that actual thematic "maturity" is kinda vague and hard to define, it's *absence* is plain as day. 

I don't think it's that hard to differentiate between immature, not mature, and mature though; I simply don't use those words in the context of things like blood, sex, drugs, and swearing, I use appropriate instead (as in age appropriate, but also as in thematically appropriate). 

I think it's really important to keep all this stuff in mind if your attempting critical analysis, and it's just as important that you communicate the conclusions you come to clearly. So instead of saying, "You should watch Wolf Children, it's really mature," I would tell someone, "Wolf Children is appropriate for almost all ages, but handles surprisingly mature subject matter, like how the relationship between parents and children change over time, which might not appeal to some people." I might also clarify that by mature subject matter, I mean that many of the viewpoint character's trials and tribulations would be less relatable to younger audiences.

Wow, that got kind of wordy, sorry. TL;DR: Maturity might be kind of hard to define, but it's absence is pretty easy to see; also, if you just choose your words carefully and explain yourself clearly, then "mature" is a valid talking point in critical analysis. People that use big words needlessly are annoying.
>> ARTICLE
> I haven't watched Akame ga Kill

Its actually not very arbitrary at all. Akame ga Kill IS a shounen, and as such IS targeted towards younger audiences. This is very clear through its writing and characters. The lack of sophistication in the writing is also intentional. This is not to say its objectively bad or anything, no, many shounen are incredible and better than seinen, but the fact is that its not a mature story.

Whoa there. The reset had no bearing on the tone of Clannad:AS, so that's a little bit of a stretch. Disagreeing with an ending, it and being mature are two separate things.

Accepting the consequences of life and persevering through it. Discarding that makes all its earlier points moot.

Not really, because it ties together with the prospect that helping and being kind to others will have positive reciprocation at some point in the future. There were many more natural ways to tie these concepts together to make them feel more cohesive within the narrative, but I'm not sure I agree that it affects the maturity of the anime as a whole.

Ouran is great, and is Karin the vampire one? I've been meaning to check that out one day, it just never happened.

Yes :3 it's adorable. I still prefer the story in the manga, but the anime was still really cute.
>> ARTICLE
Someone suggested K-On already, which is pretty much the sweetest you can get, it's just the best kind of cute feel-good. 

Another sweet anime, with a lot of comedy, is [Love Lab.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16353/Love_Lab) It's SO sweet and hilarious, it's about girls practicing different love scenarios, such as [how to hold hands,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LredCRT77ww) or [bumping into the boy while running past a corner with toast in your mouth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV0YNSYGb0g) I can't recommend it enough.
>> ARTICLE
I'm refusing to watch the last couple of episodes of K-On because that would mean it's over.

I've watched Love Lab. It was good, but nothing that really made an impression.
>> ARTICLE
You should finish it! Have you watched the movie?

Even if you watch it all, it's still not over. There's a manga that hasn't been adapted, so you should watch end - just don't read the manga instead. That way it's still not over :P

lol nothing like that. here is my review in one of the pirated anime streaming site(lol)

9/10
a heartwarming anime, with pure hearted character and enjoyable storyline. and some clamp character crossover.
the story start with full of mystery enveloping main character and throughout the story it will reveal itself bit by bit.

kobato is a wonderful character right from the start, her development till the end.

this truly an anime that can melt your heart with a touch of feeling. i recommend anyone to watch this awesome anime.

Wow, thanks for all the suggestions guys!

Recency bias? For the years selected. 
>> ARTICLE
Nature of the beast...

I'd personally like to see 2002 and 2003 replace 2012 and 2013, but I'm squarely in the minority.
>> ARTICLE
I agree on 2013, but I actualy really like 2012. Shinsekai yori and Psycho Pass are some of the greatest scifis in the past 10 years, and Kokoro Connect and Sakurasou are amazing SoL's/Drama/Romance. Not to mention the monogatari hype, even though Nise is probably the weakest instalment (I don't count Neko). There's also sao, which isn't great but it actually did a lot for anime, in my opinion, considering how many people started watching anime with sao. This got a bit long, but I really like 2012's lineup, something for everyone there. (Haven't seen F/Z so I can't comment, but I'm pretty sure the consensus is that it's amazing)

>> ARTICLE
may i ask why 2002 ? i just checked all the anime relased that year, seems rather weak except for "full metal panic" and "ghost in the shell"

personally i'd watch the 2013 roster over the 2002 any day
>> ARTICLE
I'm speaking my own biases here, but I think I also speak on behalf of fans of older shows too that the 2002 roster trounces the 2013 roster all day every day, and probably the main reason 2013's up there is recency bias. Let's examine some shows now.

[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex](http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex): One of several shows that trounce every show in 2013 by a long shot. This would have been the equivalent of the Attack of Titan back in then because it was far reaching to western audiences. 

[Princess Tutu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/721/Princess_Tutu): It's kind of sad how people consider Madoka a proper deconstruction when it really isn't. Truly proper deconstructions should ideally work with the assumption that the viewer has little to no familiarity of what the genre has to offer. Madoka jumps in with the assumption that we all know how the magical girl gig goes, but Princess Tutu handles it differently with how fairy tales are supposed to go. It approaches the story with a level of elegance few "deconstructions" ever show, and a deft hand with storytelling to deconstruct its genre while maintaining its intrigue. 

[Haibane Renmei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei): This is my favorite of 2002 and I'm pretty sure it's a bunch of other people's favorites of the year too. As I've heard another reviewer put it (I've forgotten who it was), Haibane Renmei is one of the most unique slice of life anime in that it can balance the line between the lighthearted nature of slice of life without losing its presence as a metaphorical narrative of exploring its more serious themes, especially that of self-discovery. It's really hard to put into words why this show has connected with me at such an emotional level, but I can say that nothing in 2013 comes remotely close to matching the quality of Haibane Renmei. 

[Azumanga Daioh](http://myanimelist.net/anime/66/Azumanga_Daioh) is one of the pioneering anime of contemporary slice of life, and not only does it hold this influence, it's actually pretty darn entertaining to watch. Compared to things you've seen in the past 3 years, Azumanga Daioh is tame in its portrayal of "cute girls doing cute things" and is mostly funny because the content is funny. Also Kiyohiko Azuma is a genius and it's got this [awesome opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBU5EUoW6q0).

The rest that I'll list are ones I've heard very good things about but have not had the time to watch them because they're very long and I don't have enough time in my life to watch that much (although I do have enough to type up this long, spontaneous comment since you were curious ;) )

[The Twelve Kingdoms](http://myanimelist.net/anime/153/Juuni_Kokuki) are what some people have called the epitome of high-fantasy drama. It builds up a detailed world and carries a scale impressive enough to match its 45 episodes. Shows like these are classics among anime, and hardly something that should just simply be ignored.

You mentioned Full Metal Panic yourself already, so let's also mention something with a lot of good rep: [Full Moon wo Sagashite](http://myanimelist.net/anime/122/Full_Moon_wo_Sagashite). Like some of the classics of this genre, it's not only popular, but from what I've heard, it's pretty damn good. 

Other notable titles include Makoto Shinkai's debut short [Voices of a Distant Star](http://myanimelist.net/anime/256/Hoshi_no_Koe), [RahXephon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/165/RahXephon), and probably some others I missed.

Oh ya, I forgot, an OVA for [Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/976/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kikou:_Quiet_Country_Cafe). If you don't know what it is, within the niche slice of life community, Yokohama's reputation rivals that of Aria as the pinnacle of slice of life. 

If you've read this far, bravo. My point in providing you with this response it to tell you that although it might seem at a glance that the more recent shows are "better", it's better to probably to do a bit of snooping around to see if 2002 really has nothing to offer and is thus a weak year. It doesn't really take more than 10 mins of your day to look at some of the big titles that year and see how they've been received in the community to get rid of the assumption of, taking a page out of Daniel Kahneman's book *Thinking: Fast and Slow*, WYSIATI (What you see is all that is).

Finally, please do keep in mind recency bias. Although these shows do seem relevant now, come back in 5 years. Looking at 2002, it has over half a dozen titles that are still remembered as classics among the anime community that takes the time to watch shows older than 5 years old. This in itself signifies an amazing year. Looking back at 2013, I can really only see Attack on Titan and Kill La Kill making notable impacts, with the second season of monogatari (since it's always difficult to remember 2nd season years) and SNAFU possibly being minor talking points brought up every once in a while 5 years from now.

Hope this helped!

>> ARTICLE
Me too, actually. 2013's squad is so weak compared to its seeding. 

But the people have spoken, haha. I'm excited for the tourney. :)
>> ARTICLE
I actually like a lot of the stuff from 2013... but yeah, the team is really weak in comparison to a lot of the other things. However much I like Attack on Titan it will probably never get my vote in terms of the other first shows and the same is true for most of the other levels as well.
>> ARTICLE
2013 seems a bit top-heavy. Attack on Titan and Kill la Kill are both incredibly strong competitors and Monogatari "Second" Season is big on this sub. Oregairu and Maou seem like a really weak 6 and 7 though.
>> ARTICLE
Monogatari SS is just big in general. It was the 2nd best seller in 2013, after AoT. I'd actually say this sub actually has a small bias against Monogatari.
>> ARTICLE
Where are you getting this sales figure? Is it for the American market or the Japanese one? It makes a difference, as English and Japanese speaking anime fandoms are very different. I'm a little out of touch with the greater pulse of the English-speaking anime fandom, so I may be underestimating it. At AX this year I saw a million KLK cosplayers, a sizable number of AOT cosplayers, and virtually no Monogatari cosplayers, so I was judging overall popularity on that.
>> ARTICLE
http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1vfiyo/2013_tv_anime_sales_rankings_update_nonbiyori/

I think this is global, but it's probably heavily heavily skewed toward Japan if it is, as the Japanese tend to be muchmore spendy on BD/DVDs.

I probably also think that the cosplaying community is probably different from the rest of the community. Monogatari really have character designs that tickle the cosplaying fancy either (IMO anyway).
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, Monogatari has a pretty distinctive and colorful school uniform, especially when compared to how bland a KLK Mako costume is, and Mako was pretty common at AX. Those numbers are also from before KLK had finished airing, so there might be a bias there too, and it's not clear (at least in the linked parent post) where those numbers come from and what audience(s) they represent. 

Monogatari is definitely a lucrative franchise for Shaft, but I've kind of got the impression that it's bigger in Japan and on here than it is in the larger English-speaking anime community. Not to say that it's small in the fandom as a whole, but that it's not necessarily a *huge* force like it would be in this community. As I've said though, I may not be the most informed person for this kind of judgement.
>> ARTICLE
Mako defies all logic. 

> huge force like it would be in this community

Somebody missed the note banning Kaiki from the best girl contest. But really, Monogatari just doesn't really have that HYPE train that everybody bandwagons on, so it's mostly just *there*, instead of being in your face all the time.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone who's watched it seems to love Maou, though, so it might be stronger than you'd expect.  I think it beats all its lower-seeded six spots.  Hell I haven't even seen it but I'd vote for it over Haruhi and Index.
>> ARTICLE
Maou-sama i spretty good, but over Haruhi and Index? Are you nuts?

Also it can't possibly win against big game like Mirai Nikki.

EDIT: Now that I realise it this contest is pointless... is there any doubt that 2011 will win on this sub?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not a K-On! fan, but I know that it does have a fairly strong following.

Haruhi will probably lose because people are still suffering sodium OD after endless eights.
>> ARTICLE
It's pretty mediocre tbh. It succeeds as a comedy at the start, but quickly just becomes a romance slice-of-life.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, actually out of everything in the 2013 lineup, the only thing I like more than Maou is LH. It was a lot of fun and I really hope they make more.
>> ARTICLE
Maou, so good. so good
>> ARTICLE
My teams for the years that didn't make it:

2001: Spirited Away, Millennium Actress, Princess Arete, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, Read or Die, Metropolis, Lupin III: Alcatraz Connection - I've seen almost no anime from this year...

2002: 12 Kingdoms, Princess Tutu, GitS: SAC, Haibane Renmei, Macross Zero, Azumanga Daioh, RahXephon - Great year! Deserved to make the tournament.

2003: Planetes, Kino's Journey, Last Exile, Gunslinger Girl, Tokyo Godfathers, Scrapped Princess, Full Metal Alchemist - My favorite year that didn't get included.

2004: Fantastic Children, GitS: SACII, Aishiteruze Baby, Samurai Champloo, Howl's Moving Castle, Paranoia Agent, Mind Game - None of top favorites come from this year. Kind of forgetable.

2005: Mushishi, Kamichu!, Aria the Animation, Noein, Pani Poni Dash, Honey and Clover, Mahou Sensei Negima!

This made me realize I need to watch more things from 2001. My list is literally all movies. Must have been a slow year for series.
>> ARTICLE
I really think 2003 deserved to be on there as well, though 2002 and 2004 were both great too. 

2001 doesn't impress me much and it doesn't seem to impress anyone else either; I think digital animation was still working itself out. 2005 had a few awesome things, but 2006 was rightly more impressive overall.
>> ARTICLE
2002 and 2003 are definitely top tier for me. Planetes and RahXephon are both some of my favorite shows. Azumanga Daioh is great too; a better version of all these cutesy high school girls doing cute things shows nowadays. I'm sure if more people on this sub watched Azumanga Daioh they would love it. It seems to fit the general tastes of this sub pretty damn well.  Most of those shows are fairly obscure however. At least to today's crowd.
>> ARTICLE
> Azumanga Daioh is great too; a better version of all these cutesy high school girls doing cute things shows nowadays. I'm sure if more people on this sub watched Azumanga Daioh they would love it.

I watched it (and read the entirety of the manga) and personally I'd say the manga is far superior. If I was choosing to recommend it, I'd recommend the manga. The pacing of the show is just a bit odd, and some episodes felt like the extended 3 panels of the manga to an entire episode. Maybe I'm not really the kind of person for the show, but I loved the source material so I'm not even sure about that. I enjoyed it, but I don't really get why people have so much love for it. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess my personal feeling is that it seems very similar to some of these generic school life comedies. And most of them do a really bad job in recent times at least from what I've seen.

I had an "anime to nominate" google doc ready for all the years. This isn't necessarily a team of 7 for each year, but here's what I had prepared for the years that didn't make it:

2001: [Spirited Away](http://myanimelist.net/anime/199/Sen_to_Chihiro_no_Kamikakushi), [Millennium Actress](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1033/Sennen_Joyuu), [Jungle wa Itsumo Hare Nochi Guu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/253/Jungle_wa_Itsumo_Hare_nochi_Guu),  [Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven's Door](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5/Cowboy_Bebop:_Tengoku_no_Tobira), 
[Hellsing](http://myanimelist.net/anime/270/Hellsing), and [R.O.D. Read or Die (OVA)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/208/R.O.D_OVA)


2002: [She and Her Cat](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1004/Kanojo_to_Kanojo_no_Neko), [Haibane Renmei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/387/Haibane_Renmei), [The Cat Returns](http://myanimelist.net/anime/597/Neko_no_Ongaeshi), [Voices of a Distant Star](http://myanimelist.net/anime/256/Hoshi_no_Koe), and [Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/306/Abenobashi_Mahou_Shoutengai)

2003: [Tokyo Godfathers](http://myanimelist.net/anime/759/Tokyo_Godfathers), [Cromartie High](http://myanimelist.net/anime/114/Sakigake!!_Cromartie_Koukou), [Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem](http://myanimelist.net/anime/731/Interstella5555:_The_5tory_of_The_5ecret_5tar_5ystem), [Gungrave](http://myanimelist.net/anime/267/Gungrave), [Diary of Tortov Roddle ](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1205/Aru_Tabibito_no_Nikki), and [The Animatrix](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1303/The_Animatrix)

2004: [Paranoia Agent](http://myanimelist.net/anime/323/Mousou_Dairinin), [Mind Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/875/Mind_Game), [The Place Promised in Our Early Days](http://myanimelist.net/anime/433/Kumo_no_Mukou_Yakusoku_no_Basho), [Genshiken](http://myanimelist.net/anime/240/Genshiken), [Samurai Champloo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/205/Samurai_Champloo), [Yakitate!! Japan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28/Yakitate!!_Japan), [School Rumble](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24/School_Rumble), [Elfen Lied](http://myanimelist.net/anime/226/Elfen_Lied), and [Howl's Moving Castle](http://myanimelist.net/anime/431/Howl_no_Ugoku_Shiro). I was also going to try and sneak in as one entry the music video trilogy that is [Portable Airport](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3821/Portable_Kuukou), [Space Station No. 9](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3820/Space_Station_No._9), and [Soratobu Toshi Keikaku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3818/Soratobu_Toshi_Keikaku) but I wasn't sure if you would accept that (not that it would have any chance of making it past nominations into voting). As you can see, this year had the most on my list, and with Paranoia Agent being my favorite TV anime and Mind Game being my favorite non-Miyazaki non-Kon anime movie (it gives Miyazaki and Kon a run for their money, but it'd be hard to bring myself to say I like it more than Porco Rosso or Paprika) this is absolutely a strong year in my book.

2005: [Honey and Clover](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16/Hachimitsu_to_Clover), [Paradise Kiss](http://myanimelist.net/anime/322/Paradise_Kiss), and [Dore Dore no Uta](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4158/Dore_Dore_no_Uta) (if music videos were to count)
>> ARTICLE
I probably would have killed the short music videos if by some miracle they made the top 15 nominations. It's funny how close our 2001 lists were. Some interesting choices for 2002. I enjoyed Abenobashi until the last episode, which then preceded to ruin the whole show for me. Cat Returns is probably my least favorite Ghibli show besides Ocean Waves. I'm guessing you're a big Daft Punk fan with that Interstella nomination, huh?
>> ARTICLE
Abenobashi was a show that I loved to death in High School but which I suspect I would dislike if I were to rewatch now even though I would probably get more of the jokes. The end was a major tonal shift that was internally inconsistent with the rules and message of the show, but I really liked it back then. I would probably be nominating it more for nostalgia than anything else.

The Cat Returns is my second favorite Ghibli movie that was not directed by Miyazaki after Pom Poko. It's sacrilege to say this, but Grave of the Fireflies is by far my least favorite Ghibli, and in my overall bottom 5 movies I've ever seen, not just anime. 

It's funny, I love Discovery and I've enjoyed all Daft Punk's big singles, but I've never really felt the urge to expand my Daft Punk listening beyond that. I wouldn't call myself a big Daft Punk fan overall, but it's fair to say that I am a big fan of that album.

edit: for the record, /u/PixelPenguins, I've noticed in the course of this thing so far that your favorites tend to be shows I've always suspected would be up my alley but which I've never gotten around to watching. Kinda funny.
>> ARTICLE
2001 had Hellsing? Didn't realize it was quite that old now. Still that year could probably be 4th or 5th for me just by virtue of Hellsing and Spirited away. 2004 is really stacked too. Genshiken, School Rumble, and Elfen Lied(not a favorite but it was my first show)? School Rumble stands to this day to be my favorite high school anime by miles. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep, original TV Hellsing was 2001. It's fallen out of favor with the Hellsing Ultimate OVA which is pretty much universally considered better, unlike original FMA which still has a lot of staunch supporters. I still thought it was worthy of a mention, as I thought it was pretty strong in its own right. 
>> ARTICLE
I much prefer the original Hellsing but I'm well aware that I'm the minority for that. I adore the original series dub and prefer the way they did a bunch of the characters. OG Seras Victoria had such a fantastic british accent T_T. Also really disliked most of the comedic elements of Ultimate. Ruined the bad ass vibe of the whole thing which is really what Hellsing was all about for me.  Not to mention the whole ending of ultimate makes little to no sense.

I love Monster as a manga. The show is incredibly faithful to the manga, but to me it still felt like something was lost in the transition. I felt like the pacing was thrown out of whack and the show end up a little too slow. Also, the visuals felt a little stiff and had less of an emotional impact. Overall it's still fairly good, but I gave it up partway in and decided to reread the manga instead.
>> ARTICLE
i guess it's because you read it before, but I'm going through it for my first time, and i am on the edge of my seat even for the most mundane moments. The pacing is slow, but i feel as if every moment is extremely significant no matter how boring it seems at the time. Its really up there with Hannibal, Breaking Bad, and Fargo in terms of story telling. I really hope they go through with making it a live action show.

I love Penguindrum. I was hoping against hope it would score the 7 spot. Oh well, I wasn't really expecting it to make it.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably going to be my favourite year in the contest anyway - those top three are some are of my few 10s on MAL - but damn, if Usagi Drop and Chihayafuru had gotten through it would've beaten every other year with ease for me.

I'm not surprised for the most part by what got through, but I at least thought that those two I mentioned would've been above Nichijou. I see them mentioned everywhere and pretty much universally praised, while Nichijou only seemed fairly niche for a KyoAni show and got a mixed reception. Is there just a big difference of opinions between /r/anime and other fans, or has the popularity of these shows suddenly changed at some point in the last few years?
>> ARTICLE
No Chihayafuru is a real shame. That first season was incredible.

This isn't even a contest. With the huge hype behind literally *every show* that aired in 2011 it's an easy pick for around 90% of everyone in this sub.

|Initial D|

that couldn't have all come out in the same year did it? 

that's amazing, what a list. I personally loved outlaw star.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I thought that this was a contest that had already been decided, 1998 is impossible to beat!
>> ARTICLE
This board is skewed heavily toward newer anime, so I didn't think there'd be any interest in the 90's. Even I would have trouble listing 7 good anime from each year of the 90's, and the list of anime I've watched is much longer than most users here.

Someone could hold a 90's version of this contest if they thought the interest was there.
>> ARTICLE
We messed up because we didn't vote for a year that we couldn't even vote for?

This contest is only for 2001-2013.
>> ARTICLE
And to OP:
Yeah, because the 90's would've rocked most of these anime; it wouldn't be a fair contest.
>> ARTICLE
I counter with Urobutcher.
>> ARTICLE
One series every once in awhile.. while Urobuchi is great, not enough to topple the 80's/90's.
>> ARTICLE
2011: Madoka
2011: F/Z
2012: Psycho Pass

That's fairly consistent. I know a lot of people didn't like Gargantua (I liked it), and A/Z is... eh.

From the 90s, going through wikipedia's list the only stand outs are:

Ghost in the Shell movie

Utena

NGE

Serial Experiments Lain

Cowboy Bebop 

That's from an entire decade. Like that barely trumps 2011's lineup in my book (except maybe AnoHana).

Plus anything from this decade has an unfair half point advantage (on a purely imaginary 10 point scale, every series I've listed basically is undefined/10) on digital animation quality for me. 
>> ARTICLE
> every once in awhile

I meant that because it was every year or two, although he apparently hasn't really stuck with projects often lately.  Meh, I'll give it to you, he has been consistent the past 3 years.

Clearly you weren't around during the 90's... there were a LOT more series than that that trump a lot of current anime... even 2011. And if you really judge a show based on the quality of animation/graphics, you have some minor judgment issues.  The characters and stories back then tend to be significantly better than the current ones.  While some are good, a lot are... not... even close.

Granted upon further research, my nostalgia stretches more around the mid-late 90's to the very early 2000's.
>> ARTICLE
>Clearly you weren't around during the 90's... there were a LOT more series than that that trump a lot of current anime

Like I need some names. We'll go with 1995, probably the strongest in my book, notable series:
Evangelion, Gundam Wing, Sailor Moon... and nothing.

Like those are some pretty good shows, but literally everything else from that year I wouldn't really watch.

> And if you really judge a show based on the quality of animation/graphics, you have some minor judgment issues.

It's a part of the show, and technical execution is still part of art. I can't help if I prefer the crisper aesthetic of digital animation. They also weren't as experimentive with art style back then either IMO, look at something like Madoka. Aesthetics are important to me, it's part why I watch animation as opposed to live action shows.

> The characters and stories back then tend to be significantly better than the current ones. While some are good, a lot are... not... even close.

You are aware the 90s had its fair share of shovel shows? We're comparing the best of the best. (Although I disagree with reddit's taste on some shows). Like a lot of current shows also have  strong writing.

Early 2000s had some pretty good stuff, are you lumping those in?
>> ARTICLE
I can understand how animation is important to anime, and creative animation is great, but putting a large emphasis on it seems silly.  For me, it's like saying a game is bad or good depending on how good the graphics are.

But to each their own there.  Plus, on review of your comment, actually your grading on the animation is reasonable.  I apologize for misunderstanding what you intended.

Yeah I am aware of the amount of shovel shows.  Which is why I put "my nostalgia" because I recognize that a lot of this is because of rose-tinted glasses.  Which is analogous to the extra-hype that follows more recent series.

I do agree that a lot of /current/ shows have strong writing.  However, considering shows like SAO which have HORRIBLE story-telling, etc, and are incredibly popular, it's hard to really go "yeah, the current shows are so much better or on par."

Even Madoka, while being interesting, kind of bore me the first few episodes.  I'd probably enjoy the mid->end parts but the beginning is boring.  The most interesting was when the yellow chick died.  The main character is really annoying though, and not even in a good way.  She has a wish... why not wish for her new friend to be alive again?  Jesus...

But this is all largely preference and probably largely based on age.  I think the current years are being a little over-hyped to be honest but that's how it usually works.

And yeah, I was lumping the years around 2000 around, I didn't realize that they were started closer to the millennium.  My memory is a little off it seems.  So again, my judgment is not as valid anyway (which I mentioned in my previous comment).  So let's end this debate with "it is what it is; people's preferences are just different?" 
>> ARTICLE
Also we've had shit shounen shows forever, SAO isn't exactly the first of its kind.

With regards to Madoka, Homura was always stopping her from making the wish in the current timeline. If she failed, then that wouldn't be the timeline of that the viewer would follow.
>> ARTICLE
Sure, there's a lot of preference. I do think increased number of shows in recent years might lead to more shows that I think are good. Like we get as many shows in a season as the 90s did in a year, so it's a little unfair to ye olde times.

Man why didn't kuroko no basket 2 make it for 2013?

sports anime never gets any love.  People assume they won't like sports anime, because they don't like sports, which is a real shame.

I don't fucking know, but it deserves that shit.

Are you going to use weights? I mean, like 1st seed being worth more points than 7th. For example...

1. 4 points  
1. 3 points  
1. 3 points  
1. 2 points  
1. 2 points  
1. 1 point   
1. 1 point
>> ARTICLE
The total number of points must make an odd sum otherwise there will be a need for tiebreakers. 
>> ARTICLE
It's an interesting idea. It might let one year rely more on a couple powerhouses instead of a well rounded team though. I probably won't, but I'll think about it.
>> ARTICLE
2006 hands down: two of the greatest psychological anime, one of the few guns anime that is actually good, and finally, GINTAMA. 
>> ARTICLE
2011 is going to be real tough to beat. I think we can definitely see some upsets with 2010.. it definitely deserves a higher seeding than 7th
>> ARTICLE
2006 and 2008 are probably the best here for me. That said I haven't seen a ton of the shows on this list. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this seems like quite the interesting contest.

2011 and 2012 were good years

Looks like fun, would be cool to see a 90's version of this, or maybe another one of these but in the next tournament can't use any of the years in this tournament.

2011 with Steins;Gate, Madoka and Fate/Zero ? Either this will be easy or I will be dissappointed xD.
I can't imagine another year that could beat that personally as this contains three of my top 10 anime, including my number one and two.

Gintama wins

2006 because Gintama.

fucking scrubs, what about 1995? best year of all time NGE and Ghost in the shell

Well they are some of the best animes of all time, but let's be honest recent years have given us a lot more quality stuff.

Still, it all started wayyy back when ;P

Ok, I can agree to that.

The general quality HAS increased.  Granted, the 2000's I didn't like really; only more recent anime seem to have picked up a good deal overall.

Still... Rurouni Kenshin <3

How would we do a "best of X" series if we took the years as a whole? 100 polls per topic? >_>

The original poll that led to the seeding was taking the years as a whole. If we just asked people to vote 2008 or 2011 / 2007 or 2010 / etc. it'd just end the same way the original poll ended. http://i.cubeupload.com/qRU45e.jpg
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's the "greatest year of anime" tournament. This is just like the most popular anime tournament. People who like steins;gate will vote for 2011 unknowing of all the other shows in the season. 
>> ARTICLE
There are 7 polls for each match. They can only vote for Steins;Gate in one of them...
>> ARTICLE
I guarantee you that many people will skew their ratings to that their favorite show's year will win. Regardless, what if I like other shows from, say, 2007? Do I not want that year to win despite thinking it is the best just because the specific selection for another year has shows that I like more than 2007's? 
>> ARTICLE
If it happens it happens. It's just a fun little contest. It's not serious business. 

I'll instruct people to vote on the specific shows in the polls. If they choose to ignore it... oh well. No one's going to lose sleep over which year wins this tournament.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking Lucky Star, an Evangelion rebuild, and 5 cm. per second are somehow in the 2007 roster when there were so many better choices that would have made this a no contest. This subreddit is hopeless
>> ARTICLE
Would you mind telling me about Baccano? I've never heard about this show and seeing it so high has peaked my interest. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen Pulp Fiction? It's basically the anime version of that.
>> ARTICLE
A huge cast of characters go on wacky hijinks. A train robbery and immortal gangs are involved. It is an utterly delightful romp!

This subreddit's taste in anime has always been shit. This isn't something new. That Lucky Star made the selection is especially disgusting in itself though.
>> ARTICLE
>two of the most highly-rated anime movies of all time are somehow in the 2007 roster
>> ARTICLE
1. Highly rated =/= good. Guilty Crown and SAO are highly rated too

2. Neither of them are among "the most highly rated anime movies of all time"

3. Even if they were, they don't hold a candle to Mononoke, Bakurano, etc.
>> ARTICLE
plus 2010 looks pretty stacked too....also reddit is always hopeless...
>> ARTICLE
I know right?  Tatami Galaxy, Disappearance, Katanagatari, and Durarara.  Even a few crowd-pleasers with TWGOK, K-On, and Angel Beats.  Still can't compare to the massive hypetrains behind the 2011 picks though, knowing this sub.

Honestly I thought it'd be worse and I'd only have two or three from each year but by the looks of I'll actually be able to participate at least a bit in each matchup.  If we vote we'll be able to vote for a many or as few of the match-ups as possible, right?  I'd feel bad voting against a show I hadn't seen.

Also I find it interesting the most recent year is the one I've watched the fewest shows from.

>> ARTICLE
Personally, I think it should be 8 of 32.  That way there are less OP's that you have to watch/listen to each day.  It would make it a hell of a lot easier than watching/listening to 64 OP's on the first 4 days.

>> ARTICLE
Glad someone mentioned Inuyasha, I loved most of those openings.
>> ARTICLE
Dragonar, MS team, dirty pair, star driver, level e, code:breaker, Galilei.  It took a while, but out of ALL of these openings, those are the ones I enjoyed.  The only one I wouldn't skip, however, is the Star Driver OP.  It should be noted that I have seen none of these shows, so there is no Nostalgia (Except Dragonball).  It's obvious that I have shit taste, but I think none of these were nominated because most of these are old and/or are mecha shows (this sub is mainly composed of younger guys like myself, and there is no love for robots).  Sound effects in the OP ruin it for me, and the style of music for most of them didn't suit me.  And it may be my headphones, but the sound quality for a lot of these was bad (could just be because they're older and are probably recorded VHS tapes turned into youtube videos).  I don't know, but I think most of these suggestions are pointless because they would be voted out in the first round.  BTW, yoru no yatterman wouldn't load for me :/
>> ARTICLE
> It's obvious that I have shit taste

The first step in getting good is acknowledging that you're bad.

> I think none of these were nominated because most of these are old and/or are mecha shows

That's not really a good excuse for dismissing rad stuff.

> the sound quality for a lot of these was bad

You take what you can get; lots of these OPs had better versions out on the interwebs at one time but were taken down because of DMCA complaints.

> I think most of these suggestions are pointless because they would be voted out in the first round.

By that logic, this whole exercise is pointless, because we know that the same handful of extremely popular shows (like FMA, Steins;Gate, etc.) and recent FotM shows are only going to make it to the final rounds anyways.  I just wanted a little love shown to some overlooked classics, and maybe total newbies like you could get exposed to something cool that you haven't seen for the first time that you might look into later.

> It should be noted that I have seen none of these shows, so there is no Nostalgia... this sub is mainly composed of younger guys like myself

Something I find absolutely abhorrent in the anime community is how younger fans like you just completely write off the classics with no desire to dig into the history of your hobby/favored medium.  Movie-buffs, music-aficionados, foodies, book-worms, all make it a point to go educate themselves in their hobby's past.  Surveying your MAL, the vast majority of stuff you watch is merely a decade old at the most.  You really ought to look into older stuff, if only so you can have a better appreciation of everything modern you're watching now.
>> ARTICLE
> The first step in getting good is acknowledging that you're bad.

That was sarcasm. No need to be a dick. 

> That's not really a good excuse for dismissing rad stuff.

except in this case, it is. because the general anime viewer doesn't like those. and this is a popularity contest. if people don't like it, it is perfectly reasonable to dismiss it.

>   By that logic, this whole exercise is pointless.... recent FotM shows are only going to make it to the final rounds anyways.

not true in any way, shape, or form. yes you can predict what will make ti to the finals based on popularity. but you cant tell what will happen in the rounds throughout. with these, you can clearly see they will be eliminated right off the bat, making them pointless.

but with other ones, even if they don't have a chance at winning, you don't know who they will win or lose against. they will at least have a chance to compete.

> Something I find absolutely abhorrent in the anime community is how younger fans like you just completely write off the classics

nobody wrote off any classics. for starters, this is about music, which doesn't pertain to the quality of the show at all. also, he never said it was bad. its just less likely that someone will watch something older than them rather than watching something that is coming out now.

in fact your entire last paragraph is some of the most condescending thing i have ever read. almost none of it actually pertains to the argument of preference in music. its just you shitting on someone else for having a different opinion then you. 
>> ARTICLE
> That was sarcasm. No need to be a dick.

Not being a dick, that was a joke, but way to be overly sensitive.

> ...except in this case, it is. because the general anime viewer doesn't like those. and this is a popularity contest. if people don't like it, it is perfectly reasonable to dismiss it.

1) If it was a pure popularity contest, shouldn't it be titled 'favorite opening' and not 'best'?  Best implies some objectivity here, in which you should be evaluating everything.

2) Isn't the point of a popularity *contest* to have a *contest* to determine whether something is popular or not?  It seems really stupid and illogical to determine the outcome of a vote before it's allowed to happen.  Because when you do that, then there's no point to having the 'contest' part of the popularity contest.

> nobody wrote off any classics. for starters, this is about music, which doesn't pertain to the quality of the show at all. 

Implying that these classic shows don't have classic openings that are universally praised for being good.

> its just you shitting on someone else for having a different opinion then you.

I wouldn't mind if you had a different opinion about stuff.  But that would imply you actually had an opinion.  You can't have an opinion you don't know the first thing about.  What you have instead is ignorance.  If your MAL was filled with older shows and you gave them all bad scores, that's one thing.  But you're a newbie who seems like they refuse to look into anything old, and to then have condescending and dismissive 'opinions' on stuff you know nothing about is laughable.  I'm sorry you found what I wrote condescending, but IMO it was no less condescending and dismissive than you or the guy I originally replied to.  If I wanted to really be condescending, I could have laid into you with a fierce salvo of personal attacks and coarse language, which increasingly seems like it's the norm around here for disagreements.  Instead, I'm pointing out how you're totally unqualified to have 'opinions' about something you don't know anything about, and how almost every argument you're making is illogical and nonsensical.

I nominated a few of these, I'm confused that they aren't on the full list.

yeah if we could have this bracket link to the videos for each entry that would be great.

Duplicates I've seen: Higurashi, Shigatsu (1st OP), Umineko

Bit sad that Inuyasha's first OP is missing, and there's no Hatchikuji or Hanekawa representation among the Monogatari OPs.

I'm thinking Unravel and Guren No Yumiya will get to the top eight.

Man, I've already seen 3 or 4 duplicates.

...Huh. Only one of the three anime series I've completely watched is actually missing.

wow what the hell where is fate/zero second op??

Well, *Gotta Catch em All!* is there so I guess we have our winner.

Are you implying at the greatest anime opening of all time has no place in the bracket to determine the greatest anime opening?

> RWBY was nominated...well I think we have our winner.

Nope, just responding to a previous comment.
>> ARTICLE
Normally I'd be a bit concerned about including RWBY on the bracket, but at the same time, This Will Be The Day is a *REALLY* good OP, so I'm willing to let it slide. If there's one good thing about RWBY, it's the soundtrack.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose so, I'm just glad "Cory in the House" and the German Naruto theme were taken out by OP... I would've lost respect for the bracket if that happened...
>> ARTICLE
>I would've lost respect for the bracket if that happened

Did you lose respect for the best guy bracket then?
>> ARTICLE
>If there's one good thing about RWBY, it's the soundtrack.

Yeah. RWBY's animation may not be the greatest thing ever (though it certainly tried with the budget it had, RIP Monty Oum) but the soundtrack is pretty much up there with the best of them.
>> ARTICLE
wow, after seeing whats been nominated, this is gonna be a interesting competition
>> ARTICLE
Azumanga Daioh and Baccano are the two shows whose themes I never skip.
>> ARTICLE
and norgami op is there twice
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn. 

Sometime since I graduated high school, so around 6 years, I flat out stopped liking shonen. 

But hearing and seeing Asterisk again... damn, that opening has style, and reminded me that sure, a part of me still likes the older Bleach episodes, and that it's okay. 

Thanks for that trip down Nostalgia lane. 
>> ARTICLE
I have to confess that the OP didn't click with me instantly when I first heard it back in 2005, but the guitar riff so goddamn good.
>> ARTICLE
Bleach was the one anime I watched in my childhood. I rewatched the early bleach episodes recently and decided to learn it on guitar. It was so nostalgic. WE MUST SAVE RUKIA!

[Busuo Renkin definitely one of my favs this round <3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IcYnLcWYYo)
>> ARTICLE
Yahari opening 1 nobody?

>> ARTICLE
Maka na Chikai is probably my favorite OP of all time <3

Never watched Buso Renkin sadly, but I've heard it's pretty mediocre. Kinda saddened by that fact since it was made by the same person who made my 2nd favorite series of all time, Rurouni Kenshin :/
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it's a shounen jump anime. It's hammy, it's fairly predictable at times, but damn it's a fun ride to just kinda turn off the critical part of your brain and enjoy. 
>> ARTICLE
We all know it's gonna be FMA:B and Steins;Gate at the top anyway -.-

It's gonna be the same with best pairing as well, Edward x ~~Winky/Winry/Wendy?~~whats-her-face and Okabe x Kurisu
>> ARTICLE
I think this one might be different. People can actually listen to the music OPs of the shows that they haven't seen.
>> ARTICLE
Steins;Gate only has 1 OP and it isn't allowed in this competition.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't the movie have a different OP
>> ARTICLE
Opening was great, but I liked the show as well, it was mediocre, but with enough uniquness to separate itself from the rabble.

Special mentions: 

* [Yasashisa no Ryuu](http://a.pomf.se/iohhvh.webm) - [Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka) - would vote if it was my taste, but it's not

* [Sign of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XlYCe78YMg) - [Saraiya Goyou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7588/Saraiya_Goyou) - very different, I like the art style and the song has some nice moments in the refrain, but also wasn't quite enough
* [Akatsuki no Yona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InpDmaUPux4) - [Akatsuki no Yona](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25013/Akatsuki_no_Yona) - instrumental, however I didn't like it as much as other people did and think this is quite boring, I prefer the second OP. Though the visuals of the OP are still good and you can argue that the first OP was supposed to represent the calmness, sadness and betrayal, while the second OP is stronger and stands for the character growth of the main character.
* [Love Letter from Nanika?](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xs0h69_chouyaku-hyakunin-isshu-uta-koi-op_shortfilms) - [Uta Koi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13349/Chouyaku_Hyakuninisshu:_Uta_Koi.) - definitely interesting, but not very catchy
* [Sen Ikusa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnwm5po0DN0) - [Sengoku Musou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28283/Sengoku_Musou) - very pretty, but the song is not quite enough

Thank you for voting for Fate, I nominated it because it's such a gorgeous and underrated OP.
>> ARTICLE
Monster's op is great because it gets better and better the further the show goes in and the further the pieces get into place.
>> ARTICLE
Vitalization OP from Symphogear G is there twice.

The Dantalian OP To Never Know Tomorrow is English for Cras numquam scire, they're the same and both there.
>> ARTICLE
Very happy to see the Utena and Mouretsu Pirates themes on here. I think that Mugen no Ai is particularly underrated but it's such a good jam that gets me pumped every time, I've never skipped it. 
>> ARTICLE
I nominated Rinbu Revolution! I love Utena and I'm hoping that more people will watch it after seeing the OP.
>> ARTICLE
I was looking through all of the entrants and I found a few problems.

* OP for Knights of Sidonia is on there twice. Once listed as Knights of Sidonia- Knights of Sidonia, and again listed as Sidonia-Sidonia no Kishi

* Noragami only has 1 OP, but the show is on the list 3 times. And one of them says the song is Hello Sleepwalkers, which is actually the name of the band.

* "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni" is listed twice.

* Kisetsu wa Tsugitsugi Shindeiku is the Tokyo Ghoul Root A ED.
>> ARTICLE
I should have suggested [Toradoras OP 2](https://youtu.be/crAPDlMB8gQ) :P
>> ARTICLE
Remember there are over 600 entries! Toradora's "Silky Heart" will be in a later bracket.
>> ARTICLE
The contest becomes unwieldy at this scale. To give proper consideration, a participate would ideally have watched all openings, which would take over 15 hours.

Perhaps it would have been better to do a 'best opening of 2015' next year. That way the entries are fresh in people's minds, the number of possible entries are limited, and the contest is more relevant.
>> ARTICLE
Oto no Naru Hou e from Silver Spoon 2 is not a opening its the ending.

>> ARTICLE
thanks! fixed!
>> ARTICLE
Just a couple hours ago I finished submitting like, nigh 100 entries. I'm sure most of them had been submitted already but still, sorry 'bout that...

So how many entries will there be at the end of eliminations?

Guren no Yumiya (AoT OP 1) is pretty great. I advise anyone who hasn't seen AoT to listen to it.

[Sengoku Musou : Sen Ikusa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnwm5po0DN0)

Holy fuck, this group is full of the shows I like with the least favorite opening it had

Ika Musume, Psycho Pass, Code Geass, Spice and Wolf, Anohana, Mawaru Penguindrum.

Their other OPs are far better IMO. But I know this is just the first group, so I'll look forward to the others.

> Tada Hitori - Ping Pong the Animation
  
Aight guys, lets do this shit.
>> ARTICLE
Literally nobody gives a fuck about Lupin III here, even though it's got one of the most iconic openings in anime.  SMH.

Also, why is the '80 theme being represented and not the more iconic ['78 theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdr92JhayE8), or the overall superior ['79 theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZDcuN14Yg)?  OP you're the worst.
>> ARTICLE
I just looked at the full list of nominations, the '78, '79, and '80 OPs are there.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I see that now.  But there's a lot more glaring omissions than that now that I dig into the full list.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, a few of the ones I nominated didn't even make that full list. I'm just glad that most of them did.
>> ARTICLE
Please give [Fate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqYvjaa2Uvo) a listen, it's absolutely gorgeous.
>> ARTICLE
hang on, what madness is this, wheres the dragon crisis op? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sovoeEVyIo
>> ARTICLE
I forgot Asterisk from Bleach was a thing.

Hate on Bleach all you want, that OP is fantastic
>> ARTICLE
Great...After spending an hour listening to all the openings I haven't heard before I now have like 25 more songs for Osu.
>> ARTICLE
Here's some more OP links:

[Jyu Oh Sei : Deep In Your Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICbhJ9jGe3w)

[Saraiya Goyou : Sign of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XlYCe78YMg)

[Saiunkoku Monogatari : Hajimari no Kaze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElO-6JOTgW0)

[Akatsuki no Yona : Akatsuki no Yona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InpDmaUPux4)

[Usagi Drop : Sweet Drops](https://vimeo.com/107013545)

[Uta Koi : Love Letter from Nanika?](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xs0h69_chouyaku-hyakunin-isshu-uta-koi-op_shortfilms)
>> ARTICLE
While there are better songs that stand on their own, the (first) Akatsuki no Yona OP is perhaps one of the best pairings of appropriate (and good) music to a particular anime.
>> ARTICLE
Complaint: can we just call this 'favorite' instead of best?  Because I know exactly how this is going to go.  This is nothing but a popularity poll and the usual suspects (like steins;gate and FMA:B) will end up winning out while 'obscure' classics like the above linked Lupin III OP will get shafted.
>> ARTICLE
This opening remains the only one I've ever not skipped once: [Bakuman - Blue Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2yZE919RmU). Please give it a listen!
>> ARTICLE
Since I don't see it anywhere, [here](https://vimeo.com/84170023) is the Hamatora OP, FLAT.

To those who may have never seen the show itself, definitely at least listen to the OP, it's fuckin fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
Is there a link to all the OPs that were submitted or do we have to wait and see each elimination round?

I missed submissions, so I'm really hoping people [submitted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is7A_htB54g) [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpqwY7tsZS4) [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygg9_LF33RA) [amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTYPjcrB9l8) [Gundam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoplnxPv-J0) [openings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGBw4uCZ4hA). I haven't even watched half the shows those are from but damn they're some of the best openings I've ever listened to. We all know [0079](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezx7M22xuBI) is the best Gundam OP though.

Gundam wouldn't violate the 4 OP rule would it? Since each show is mostly entirely different and compomised of a completely different cast of main characters?

>> ARTICLE
It's the same franchise so yes it would violate the 4 OP rule. Incidentally, right now there are 5 Gundam OPs among the entries so one has to be removed. Though I could see Build Fighters at least being considered separate from the rest of Gundam.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, fair enough, I thought it was 4 OP rule per series and not franchise. There's a load of different Gundam timelines and I think each are different enough to count them seperately but I don't think oversaturating the contest with Gundam OPs would be good either even if I think they're awesome.

>Incidentally, right now there are 5 Gundam OPs among the entries so one has to be removed.

Wait, how do you know? Is there a place to check which ones?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah here's the [link.](http://animebracket.com/characters/best-anime-opening-1/)

You can see all the entries there.
>> ARTICLE
Cool, that's actually probably one of the best turnouts I could hope for with the 4 OP rule. The original OP replacing 00's OP would make it absolutely perfect though.

Thanks for the link!
>> ARTICLE
Jormungand, Ping Pong and Seitokai Yakuindomo OPs are amazing
>> ARTICLE
I don't think running this simultaneously with the best couple bracket is the best idea, particularly considering the last OP contest wasn't even a year ago.
>> ARTICLE
Damn...after this bracket my Plan to Watch will probably be 500+...many of the OPs are actually really good (even the ones that come from crap shows).
>> ARTICLE
Pretty dissapointed at Marshmallow Justice not making it through nominations.  
As a small note, Hyouka's opening is called "Yasashisa no Riyuu", not "Yasashisa no Ryuu".  

>> ARTICLE
Did this already happen and S;G won? Or was that some best girl thing I can't remember.
>> ARTICLE
Kind of yes (same thing with FMA:B OP 1 "Again"), although it wasn't done with Anime bracket and there was very low participation. (according to what has been said before).
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, Steins;Gate and FMA:B have top tier OP's. I wouldn't be surprised if either won the whole thing. That said, I'm still pulling for the Bebop and NGE openings to make it far. I don't know if they were nominated, but Slam Dunk and Gunbuster had some great OP's with a very nostalgic feel.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I forgot to nominate [Fruits Basket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUDSedRJHf4) opening.  And nobody else did either :(  I don't see King of Brave [GaoGaiGar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFCIFS0nvec) either.

Vote for the [Honey and Clover opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7dNlDzIDNM)! (couldn't find a sub-free version. v_v)

Inb4 this turns into a repeat of the favorite show contest.

Over/under 5 upsets in the entire bracket?

Calling it now. Brave Shine is going to win.

Either that or Tank!
>> ARTICLE
Am I missing it or is Unravel from Tokyo Ghoul not included? Regardless of how mediocre the anime was, the opening is definitely something that should be in the run for best anime opening. It's also really popular, so I doubt I'm alone on this one.

Dang, I know sometimes the show was over hype'd but SAO had a pretty good OP and I didn't see it on the list. Also no Toradora OP as well. 

P.S. Just a big fan of Toradora.

I am pretty sure Preparade was on there, or at least one of the Toradora openings.  
>> ARTICLE
Your forgetting Amazing Break from Terraformars, I listen to it constantly, I bought it one iTunes and always wear headphones.

Honey & Clover's Dramatic better make it through the eliminations. It's easily one of my favorite openings, especially after having seen the show.

Colors is not on here. I'm really disappointed

Tokyo Ghoul - Unravel,
Psycho Pass - Abnormalize,
Psycho Pass 2 - Enigmatic Feeling,
AnoHana OP,

Stein's;Gate OP,

>> ARTICLE
Woah don't rule out my dearest that's the best song 
>> ARTICLE
Stein's;Gate OP and FMA:B OP 1 are both banned since they have won "Best OP Contests" already,
>> ARTICLE
They already won? Welp, I know how this contest is going to end. FMA is going to skyrocket due to being FMA... Not surprising really.
>> ARTICLE
Not really. There was really only one good OP and that one's out of competition.
>> ARTICLE
All of them were good, that was the only extremely exceptional one. I would personally put 2 or 3 of the other ones as far better than average though.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, really? Both of the openings aren't even that good. 
>> ARTICLE
You're probably in the minority on that one. I love both of them.

Yasashisa no Ryuu Vs. Mitsu no Yoake
... FUCK

This would be an interesting tournament if most of /r/anime had seen things made before 2010. 
>> ARTICLE
ugh, the suffering I have as an anime 90's kid
>> ARTICLE
Good god, I know right.
>> ARTICLE
I'll add a choice that says "I haven't seen one of the options" in the poll this time. It might help a little.
>> ARTICLE
you assume people wont ignore that and vote for what they've seen
>> ARTICLE
That's why I ignore most tournaments here. If viewers of both Show 1 and Show 2 unanimously agree that Show 1 is the better show, Show 2 will still win if significantly more people have seen it.

This isn't too bad when it comes to shows themselves, because a good show is generally more likely to be seen. But for something like best music, best character, etc., the winner is probably going to be from one of the dozen most-viewed shows on /r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'm somewhat new to /r/anime, is Shinsekai Yori (the winner of the best ED tournament) really that popular here (As in, top 20 most viewed)? Pretty much everything else in the top 20 ED songs was from popular or recent anime (Psycho Pass for example), but I don't know if I'd call that one popular.
>> ARTICLE
It had a great ED and it's not that it hasn't been watched by many here just you typically won't find it being brought up that much or at all.  I extremely liked it so I wish people referenced it more.
>> ARTICLE
I remember it being rather widely discussed when it was airing, but I guess there haven't been many posts about it since then.
>> ARTICLE
Force MAL or Hummingbird scans?
>> ARTICLE
There were anime before 2010?

Sailor Moon Sailor Moon Sailor Moon. Oh, and Pokemon, DBZ, Digimon, Monster Rancher... but those ones aren't important. \*clings to childhood memories\*

2006 would have been a better cutoff year, considering then it would encompass Death Note, Gurren Lagann, Code Geass, and others
>> ARTICLE
it also had the girl who leapt through time
>> ARTICLE
Those are all 2007 anime.
>> ARTICLE
They started (except Gurren Lagann) in 2006, and the rules state that when an anime is split in two years, that anime will be counted as part of the year where it started, so Death Note and Code Geass are from 2006.
>> ARTICLE
Also, Haruhi.
>> ARTICLE
Guren Lagann was 2006? I thought it was 2007.
>> ARTICLE
Everything he listed was from 2007
>> ARTICLE
Only Gurren Lagann is completely 2007. The others started in 2006 and ended in 2007.
>> ARTICLE
Death Note and Code Geass are listed as 2006 on MALGraph.
>> ARTICLE
Oh wait now I get it. Ok.
>> ARTICLE
Just a little tool that might come in handy for MAL users. You can use [MALgraph](http://mal.oko.im/Kruzy/fav,anime) and see what year you rated the highest (Click on the dot to see what anime came out that year).
>> ARTICLE
Well I see you're not a fan of 2005.
>> ARTICLE
Nah it's just that I watched a single anime from 2005 which was a bad adaptation of a video game to promote it. I do have some 2005 series though on my backlog that would most likely improve that score.
>> ARTICLE
Like Mushishi?

I don't really understand MALgraph, it lists lots of shows as "unrated" which really messes with results.
>> ARTICLE
You need to update it because the last time you did was 112.8 days ago.
>> ARTICLE
? 

I keep it up-to-date, it has all my shows in it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm talking about MALgraph, you can see [in the upper left corner](http://i.imgur.com/lI1gVfQ.png) when it was last updated. I requested an update so it would show everything that you added and rated on your list.

Odd little feature, thanks for pointing it out!

how does this work for 2 cour shows that start in fall and end in winter season of the following year?
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to go by the start date. It's what MALGraph uses to decide which year an anime is from, so it's the easiest option for me. So we'll take NagiAsu for example. It starts in Oct '13 and ends April '14, but would still count for 2013.

Alas that lineup really doesn't hold a candle to other years... It'll still win or get damn close most likely.

Yes, the entire year's line up will advance to face whatever other year's line up advances.

I feel this will cause even more salt than the best girl competition. Still, will be interesting, if probably lopsided to more recent years.

2006 is pretty stacked
>> ARTICLE
2007 wins. Period. End of story.

2013 with Railgun S, OreGairu, AoT, Kill la Kill, OreImo S2, Maou-sama has a very strong lineup, though. It'll be between 2007, 2011 and 2013, I think.
>> ARTICLE
No, it's literally no contest. 2013 doesn't hold a candle.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say that 2006 is stronger considering this.

>> ARTICLE
Have you considered organizing it by Genre instead of just top 7?
>> ARTICLE
The nomination process would be really rough with that format. I'd have to hold 7 different polls for each year after the initial nomination topic for the year. And many anime fit more than one genre. I mean I'd consider it if enough people wanted it to work that way.

1. Romance
2. Slice of Life
3. Sports
4. Mecha
5. Action
6. Sci-fi/Fantasy
7. Comedy

Still I think the nomination process for that would be a nightmare.
>> ARTICLE
Great concept!  Just out of curiosity why not extend it into the 90s so that shows like Bebop, Evangelion, Slayers, ect... could be included?
>> ARTICLE
I was considering it, but I didn't think enough people could pick out 7 good shows for each year prior to 2000. I mean my MAL has 500 shows on it, and I'd even have trouble picking out 7 shows for some years in the 90's.
>> ARTICLE
Between Clannad After Story, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzamiya S2, I'm going to have to go with 2009. However, it is neck-and-neck with 2003 and 2006. Damn, it seems like ever 2-3 years we get this massive boom of great anime.
>> ARTICLE
What about anime that had a second season that might of been considered the best anime for certain season or are we just considering a show for just its first season?

Like for example Spice & Wolf 2008 then Spice and Wolf II 2009.
>> ARTICLE
As of right now, I'll allow each season to be nominated in the year that it came out if MAL lists a separate page for it like it does with Spice and Wolf. Something like Detective Conan or One Piece cannot be nominated since MAL doesn't separate their seasons at all.

This could change depending on the feedback I receive.

TBH I think that 2006 and 2007 have some of the best series to come out. For me its a huge debate between those two years mainly because IMO: 

2006: Black lagoon, Code Geass, D gray Man, Deathnote. Fate Stay night, Haruhi, Higurashi When they Cry, Kanon 06, Ouran highschool host Club, School Rumble

2007:Clannad, Darker Than Black, Ef: tale for two, Gurren Lagann, 

2007 has two of my Top 5 series of all time (Clannad and Gurren Lagann) while 06 only has one of my top 5 (Kanon 06) . I had to choose 2006 because of the amount of variety that year gave for decent to really good series IMO
>> ARTICLE
This is easy

**2002**

- Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
- Azumanga Daioh
- Onegai Sensei
- Full Metal Panic!
- RahXephon
- Kanon

- Voices of a Distant Star


**2003**

- Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig
- Full Metal Alchemist
- The Big O
- Last Exile

- R.O.D. the TV
- Scrapped Princess
- Wolfs Rain
- Kaleido Star
- Kino's Journey
- Chrono Crusade
- Cromartie Highschool
- Full Metal Panic! Fumoffu

No 90s?  Do you even Evangelion?

We already know they two best years were 2007 and 2011.

Not a contest. It's just going to come down to a popularity contest and we know that 2011 will win since 90% of the people on this subreddit started watching chinese cartoons 2 years ago.

Honestly the other day I had to explain to someone why they should watch Cowboy Bebop, 'it looks old'. Was a sad day.
>> ARTICLE
Well this one will be hard not to be biased at for someone who hasn't watched much.
>> ARTICLE
The problem is that the amount of shows released in the most recent years outnumbers the past. I've watched more shows in 2013/2014 then ever before. If I'm not playing favorites, 2013/2014 would win by total value from sheer quantity.

There are plenty of resources to show what anime aired in which year. You have a MAL list already, and that's one of the best resources. You could just google "Anime of 2007" or something too.

 I don't want to effect the nominations later by putting forward my own lists of the best anime for each year.
>> ARTICLE
Give me something of similar length and I'll give you Gundam Build Fighters.
>> ARTICLE
I'll take anything for someone to watch Kara no Kyoukai
>> ARTICLE
>anything

Entirety of Naruto and naruto shippuden including fillers vs Kara no Kyoukai? :P

>> ARTICLE
I'll offer a free choice between:

* [Aoi Hana](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6164/Aoi_Hana) - yuri/romance/drama

* [Kamichu!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/489/Kamichu!) - comedy/SoL

* [Hourou Musuko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko) - drama/SoL

In return, I'll watch almost anything not longer than 13 episodes, which does not have any of following:

* Harem (atleast not if focused)

* Robots or Spaceships

Preferably want some kind of serious toned show, but I'm open to other suggestions.
>> ARTICLE
Was going to pick something else but I saw the "serious" part and I'm not sure how serious you want it to be. So many shows I loved and you haven't watched....so many possibilities...

How about [Ikoku Meiro no Croise](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9938/Ikoku_Meiro_no_Crois%C3%A9e) (went for the lesser known of all, hope you don't mind) for one of the three? You can pick which one I watch...and I can do contracts for all three if you are up for it :)
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't have to be serious, it's just that I'm not in the mood for pure unserious shows I guess, like your typical comedies :)

Never heard of **Ikoku Meiro no Croise**, which makes it perfect, and if I were to pick from the three I'd pick **Hourou Musuko**. Do we have a deal?

Also, I'm open to two more contracts if we're kind on time limit :) Hit me with more shows and we'll take it from there?
>> ARTICLE
Sure! I'll watch Hourou Musuko for Ikoku Meiro no Croise!

About other titles, I can think of [Tsuritama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12883/Tsuritama) which I watched recently and really liked but the others I thought of were more than 13 episodes (or only first season was 13 episodes) , so I'll try to think some more about that.  

Let me know if you want a time limit, I really don't mind any! Also, not sure if you want the contract to show up on the thread, I think we need to PM for that.
>> ARTICLE
Tsuritama for Aoi Hana then?

For the third, I'll be more lenient and say it doesn't have to be serious at all, SoL or moe is great for example, just no pure comedy like Nichijou or Nozaki :)

We could say like one week per contract, so finish all contracts *within* 3 weeks (if we agree on the third of course) or something? I might end up watching all in one week anyway, maybe we don't need a time limit. Unless you plan to spend 6 months or something.

Edit: Kamichu has 4 specials which are kinda cannon, so feel free to suggest a longer show.
>> ARTICLE
I'm up for a week per contract, though I'll probably watch them all quite soon (only watching airing mostly these days so was eager to find something complete to watch :D).

About the third, I'm thinking of [Free!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18507/Free!), since it seems you liked Hibike (which is the most similar title to it) and most KyoAni shows. Or maybe one of my (tons of) favourite shoujo [Natsume Yuujinchou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou)? Or would you prefer a moe title after all? I have a couple of those, I could throw at you, too, was just thinking of having you watch something you wouldn't usually pick (from what I could tell from your list, at least). Let me know!
>> ARTICLE
This seems like a good excuse to try Natsume Yuujinchou, I'll accept :)

I will probably watch them all next week anyways, but lets say within 3 weeks just to have a time frame?

So just to be sure, these 3 contracts:

* Hourou Musuko for Ikoku Meiro no Cruise

* Aoi Hana for Tsuritama

* Kamichu! for Natsume Yuujinchou

I don't really care whether the contracts are on the thread or not, but if you want we'll do it. I always make a comment in the [What have you watched--](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3tv6z0/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/) thread every Sunday, if it's okay I'll just page you there when I've finished contracts. If you'd like it done differently let me know (this is only my second time making a contract, so I'm not really familiar with how you'd normally do it).
>> ARTICLE
> I will probably watch them all next week anyways, but lets say within 3 weeks just to have a time frame?

Same here so sounds good!

Also, I usually post on "What have you watched" as well, so that sounds good, too! You can post wherever you feel like or PM or post here, up to you, really. Hope you enjoy them!

Great, a pleasure doing business with you :) 

Have fun and enjoy them :)

I'll offer Rosario+Vampire, Mirai Nikki or Fate/Zero in exchange for 1-2 animes with a combined total of around 26 episodes. A few more episodes is allowed.

I watch both seasons of Rosario if you watch Planetes.

I usually don't watch older anime because I just dislike the art style of older anime.
But for this contract thing, I will make an exception, lets do this :)

I'll offer [Kokoro Connect](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11887/Kokoro_Connect) (with the Michi Random OVA which adds up to a total of 17 episodes) for a 12~26 episode show that includes any of the following genres:

- Slice Of Life
- High School Rom Com
- Mystery [Preferably locked room mystery such as](/s "Rokka no Yuusha or Dangan Ronpa")
- Drama

I'll bite. I'm not sure how you haven't seen [Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka?q=hyouka) yet (22 ep), but it's that or [Gakkou Gurashi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24765/Gakkougurashi!?q=gakkou), (12 ep). 
>> ARTICLE
Huh, these both happened to be on my to watch list. I'm down to watch both!
>> ARTICLE
From your ratings, I think you'll enjoy them both. Albeit for somewhat different reasons. Both have mystery and SoL elements. Consider the contract signed.
>> ARTICLE
Finished Gakkou Gurashi.


[](/s "I don't think I've had trust issues like these since Oatmeal Raisin cookies. It went from 0 to 100 in a single episode.")
It was good tho.

>> ARTICLE
Glad you enjoyed it. From your MAL I guessed you liked anime that could hurt your feelings, and to be honest I also enjoy recommending Gakkou Gurashi to people without telling them what to expect.

I'm finishing another contract on Kuroko no Basket right now, but I should be onto Kokoro Connect by Thursday. Plan to finish by Saturday.
>> ARTICLE
Started Kokoro Connect today. I'll admit I went into it knowing two things.

1. Body Switching Drama

2. Inaba Best Girl

I'm liking it so far, but from the first two episodes I'm getting a distinct feeling that the pacing is fucked. It's a bit too random, puns aside. The character interactions are fun, but the art is a little... bland. Great voice work.

The obvious comparison is Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, which also had pacing issues (too hyper) but I found more immediately likeable. Thus far, Inaba's best girl status isn't really in question although Iori interests me more. We've got retarded blonde Romeo, bland wrestling fetishist dude, scared of men barbie, sideponytail cute little fang girl, and grumpy shorthaired tryhard girl.

It seems a bit unpredictable, and I'm guessing the body switching will just be one arc (as it sort of gets old once the ice is actually broken). We've got the lonely Iori drama, the scared of men drama, the unrequited love drama, and the whatever Inaba's attitude drama is.

The show is a little meta, and I'm not sure how self-aware it will be about it, but so far I'm enjoying myself.

Also, the random lesbian rapey scene put me off more than a little.
>> ARTICLE
Aight 10 episodes down. Inaba crushing the best girl race. Just realized she shares a voice actress with Kanbaru from Monogatari, which explains why I'm digging her voice so much.

Uhh I could do with less crying, truth be told. This arc was a lot of shouting, and while some of it was justified a lot of it felt very... similar. I keep thinking Heartseed is gonna off one of them for real, but after pussying out in episode 5 I'm not getting as much of a Bokurano vibe.

I'm enjoying the show so far, largely off of how well presented Inaba's character is. The plot is kind of whatever, and it's not really that *deep* but it's fun. I guess the thing that bothers me most is that all the characters seem to accept the messiah complex of the MC and think it's annoying but nice... which is really not consistent with my experiences with such people.

I just can't tell if the show is trying to break the 4th wall or if it's just knowingly generic that way. Either way, I'm positive I wouldn't be enjoying this nearly as much if Inaba wasn't such a cool character. I basically only like her and sideponytail chick of the main cast.
>> ARTICLE
Annnnd done. Kokoro Connect was nice. The supernatural adolescence metaphor was a touch ham-handed, and I was pretty done with the crying and shit toward the end, but Dereban was worth it.

I'm curious why you rated it much more highly than Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, which I found to be quite similar but more audio-visually appealing. My guess is that you valued the dramatic elements of KC, while I valued the quirky humor of Yamada-kun. Not that there's anything wrong with that, just interesting to me that there was a 2 point difference in scores.

My score: 8/10
>> ARTICLE
Kokoro Connect was one of my firsts, so it's partially the sentimental value that affected the rating. That and Dereban. I understand the connection you make between Yamada and KC in the body switching, and I thoroughly enjoyed both, but I feel like the fact that KC's body switching was uncontrollable made the dynamic between characters more interesting.

I still haven't started Hyouka yet though. I'll begin that after finals week!
>> ARTICLE
Hyouka will be a great decompression anime to relax with. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I'll offer [Katanagatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6594/Katanagatari) or [Death Parade](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade) for pretty much anything of similar length.  

[MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/sxypancake)

Sure dude. And i'll watch it all, cuz i'm a huge fan of the dub cast.

Glad to hear it, look forward to hearing what you think... It's one of my favorites.

Hmmm, I'm willing to trade Demon Lord Dante for something thats funny but a bit serious on the side. Can up to 50eps, but any higher and I can't watch.

[MAL](http://www.anime-planet.com/users/Darkwings01/anime)

I'll watch any anime if you watch something from the list. Show should be about in equal length but not necessarily.

* [The iDOLM@STER](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10278/The_iDOLM@STER)  
* [Symphogear](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11751/Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear:_Meteoroid-Falling_Burning_and_Disappear_Then...)  
* [Initial D](http://myanimelist.net/anime/185/Initial_D_First_Stage)
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch Symphogear if you watch [Samurai 7](http://myanimelist.net/anime/166/Samurai_7?q=Samu), and to make it more fair I'll even add in watching the sequel Symphogear G. That way it is an even number of episodes between us. 

Deal? 
>> ARTICLE
Sure thing! I don't think I'll manage to finish it in a week or 2 though since my vacation has ended so it will take some time.

That's fine. As it is also likely to take at least a week to finish Symphogear. Looking forward to seeing how you like it.

Historical Mecha Samurais ? Interesting....

I will watch any anime with 1-25 episodes and is dubbed. The anime I wish you to watch is Yuki Yuna is a Hero.

Do you have a link to which one? I know there are like a billion different ones haha

But sure, sounds like a deal,

This is the one: http://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero. It has a second season with 12 more episodes so that makes 25 in total. Hope you like it as much as I did!

Alright, so we just watch each others anime and then what? I'm not exactly sure what to do other than watching the anime haha

Hey everyone, I'm going to be continuing to do **two-way blind contracts** if anyone's interested. This is where we both jump in blind to a single show from either my [MAL PTW](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/State_Fan_007) or a show you suggest to me you think we would both enjoy. Send me a message or reply to this post if you're interested.

~~~

My previous contracts are listed at the bottom of my [MAL Profile](http://myanimelist.net/profile/State_Fan_007). If anyone is curious.

~~~

Side Note for those who already have contracts with me:

 I have been really busy with school and work lately, not to mention Fallout 4 sucking up all my free time. So, I've fallen behind on my current contracts. However, I will be doing everything in my power to complete any uncompleted contracts I have by next weeks thread. (My schedule has cleared up considerably, so I can almost guarantee it)
>> ARTICLE
Hey what's up! Still waiting on that NGNL contract :P

I just finished SAO if you'd be willing to double blind SAO II? Even though Alfheim wasn't as good as Aincrad, I'm the anal type of person that just has to keep going. Plus it wasn't THAT bad (apart from creepy ass Sugou).

Other options include Charlotte, Jitsu wa Watashi wa, or Spice and Wolf!
>> ARTICLE
Hey, I should be done with NGNL today or tomorrow, sorry it took so long. We can do SAO II next if you want. I agree Alfheim wasn't horrible, it was just disappointing because I enjoyed the first half so much.
>> ARTICLE
Haha enjoyment is all relative. I just try to think of them as individual ones on their own. I'll prolly start SAO II tomorrow! No rush on NGNL
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch a 13-26 episode series in exchange for watching Inferno Cop (3 min episodes) and Yamada-kun to 7-nin No Majo
>> ARTICLE
I'll watch those if you're up for watching [White Album 2.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2)
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good to me
>> ARTICLE
Ok awesome! I'm on vacation right now but I will be back tomorrow and will start then. I will probably be able to finish them by next weekend.
>> ARTICLE
I know I'm a bit late but if anyone wants to trade, pick Cowboy Bebop, Neon Genesis Evangelion (original series PLUS End of Evangelion movie), Kara no Kyoukai, Baccano!, Princess Mononoke, or Kill la Kill and give me one of your absolute favorites of equal or shorter length to what you've chosen (for KnK just assume it's ~ as long as a 24 ep series and rounding up from Baccano's 16 eps to 24 is acceptable). My MAL isn't entirely up to date, there are ~10 shows not on there yet and the watching/ptw are all old so there's a small chance you'll hit something I've already seen. 
>> ARTICLE
If you're up to do two seasons I'll take Bebop and pick Kill la Kill back up in addition to watching Mononoke, or Bebop and NGE for Clannad + Afterstory.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good to me. I'm a bit busy of late though so two seasons might take some time. Take on whichever combination you want.
>> ARTICLE
Alright I'll do Bebop+NGE, take as long as you like I'm going to be a little busy too.
>> ARTICLE
Cool. I'll PM to update once I finish the first season if you'd do the same once you complete one.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds good to me!
>> ARTICLE
I'm on mob so I can't hit up your MAL, but have you done Gundam Unicorn? Its an OVA series with six one hour episodes and one two hour episode at the end. That puts it in the same league as Kara no Kyoukai, I think? I don't know that I'd be up for binging it all in a week, but I'm certainly up for a watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone else already replied. If you'd still be interested I can pm you once I'm done with their contract.
>> ARTICLE
Dang, they got in before my reddit mobile app updated. Ah well! If you're up for doing an episode a week of Gundam Unicorn, I'll do Kara no Kyoukai at the same speed.
>> ARTICLE
I could make that work, sure. KnK is best if you let it sink in a bit regardless. It can be a bit hard to understand if you don't give it some thought and time to breathe really lets you appreciate some aspects more.That's why it went from about a 7 to a 10 for me on the rewatch. I just suddenly had the urge to watch it again and fell in love.
>> ARTICLE
Well how about this - we contract to each watch the first episode of the others' film series, and we'll sign again next week to do episode 2?

So, the contract is: By Saturday 5th December 2015, /u/Fenixius will watch Kara no Kyoukai Episode 1, and /u/7TeenWriters will watch Gundam Unicorn Episode 1.

So, will you sign?

[](#stare)
>> ARTICLE
Deal, I'm on board.
>> ARTICLE
I have messaged the one who manages the thread. It is done! See you next week!
>> ARTICLE
I think I've seen Princess Mononoke once when I was a really little kid but I've been meaning to watch it again for quite a while now but haven't got around to it, so would we trade for like a movie?
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, I already have two contracts going, which might end up being a bit difficult with how busy I am as is.
>> ARTICLE
I'm offering [Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/358/Iriya_no_Sora_UFO_no_Natsu), I'll take a movie or 13-or-less series in exchange.

>> ARTICLE
I'm going to get all meta up in here and make a contract for 1 cour of any anime if YOU will watch Madoka Magica. 

  

MAL should be in flair :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh man I was just trying to decide what to watch next and Madoka is on my PTW. So I'll take you up on that offer.

Although from your MAL it seems like you probably wouldn't like most of my recommendations. So I'll give you several options and you choose whichever you want (or none, it's ok if you dont like any).

Noragami, Angel Beats!, Hibike! Euphonium, Seitokai Yakuindomo, or Girls und Panzer.

I must warn you that I'll probably be done with it by like tomorrow though, but you're free to take as long as you want with yours.



>> ARTICLE
Be assertive! Anime contracts are all about ~~expanding your horizons~~ shoving dislikable shit onto your contractee until they get Stockholm'd.
>> ARTICLE
Contract accepted! I love dirty jokes and the only reason I've put off Seitokai Yakuindono is because... Wait, I don't have a good reason... _ 

It'll probably take me a coupla days, but enjoy MM and let me know what you think in the meantime!

Seitokai!

I'll take any 12 ep or less series, and I'll trade it for Gingitsune or Love Stage!!

[Here's my MAL](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/saintyoo)

I'm offering a **double blind contract**. If you're interested, post your MAL in a reply.

I'll also contract with multiple people.
>> ARTICLE
So [here](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Nickpressnall) is my MAL. I accept the contract, signed now in the blood of a thousand lolis. Just a heads up, the best way to contact me will probably be through my [steam account](http://steamcommunity.com/id/actuallydio/). Just add me if you want.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! From Your **Planned to Watch** I'd say you should watch **Death Parade**. An alternative would be **Nagi no Asukara**, although it has 26 episodes.

I'm up for anything and will match episode length (sorry I don't have a PTW). I'd say one week would be a good deadline for a ~12 episode show (two weeks for a ~24 episode show).
>> ARTICLE
Awesome, I will give Nagi no Asukara a watch. For you, I recommend either [GATE](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28907/Gate:_Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakaeri) or [Akagami no Shirayuki-hime](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30123/Akagami_no_Shirayuki-hime). Both are very good and both have second seasons coming up in January, so its the perfect time to watch them. Of the two, GATE is probably my favorite, but the way Shirayuki-hime throws off the traditional romance tropes to make a truly unique and captivating story makes it the superior anime by far. GATE is goofy and fun with its unusual plot and pacing, and the characters are very memorable. Plus its got Rory.
>> ARTICLE
My bad, I've already seen those shows. Unfortunately I missed about 50 shows on my list. My MAL should be updated now.

Again, Sorry!
>> ARTICLE
Ok, so that actually makes it easier because I can give you a 24 episode show. The show you will be watching is none other than [Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time), a romance set in a college environment which was, in my opinion, one of my favorite romances I have ever seen. It gets a bit weird at times, but overall it was a great watch. I will begin Nagi no Asukara tonight and let you know when I finish it!
>> ARTICLE
Alright! That sound good. I'll start today as well and will probably be done in a week.
>> ARTICLE
I think I can get my contract partner something he/she can appreciate, if you can convince me to watching something 13-26ish. Or maybe just a movie?

turn offs:
yaoi, WWII, overly sexy, incest, gore. 

....I'm sorry guys I'm quite picky. 

Also very available to discuss the shows, I hardly get to discuss them with anyone. 
>> ARTICLE
> WWII

That certainly is a unique turnoff.  
>> ARTICLE
Haha yeah, growing up I had to learn WWII stuff a silly of times. I actually don't remember the number of semesters because it was so high I stopped caring. It also always made me real sad..killing and torture and stuff, and made for a depressing experience over several years. So I usually avoid it now. 
>> ARTICLE
If you post your MAL it'll help prevent people from suggesting shows you've already watched.

If you're still waiting, I'll throw out [Angel Beats](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!), [ToraDora](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora!), and [Trigun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6/Trigun) for a bit of a spectrum.  My MAL's in my flair.
>> ARTICLE
Haibane Renmai, Hanasaku Iroha, or Eureka 7 sound good? I made it 1/6 the way through Trigun so far today. 
>> ARTICLE
I'll take Hansaku Iroha to match up w/Trigun then.  If you don't mind I'll add it to the contract list. :)
>> ARTICLE
great. 

4 episodes in trigun is nice. seeing a hero/protagonist who doesn't like to hurt people is something I'm fond of.
>> ARTICLE
Do I have to watch everything right away? Pretty busy with things rn but definitely up for it if you don't mind I might take a while 
>> ARTICLE
Nah no rush
>> ARTICLE
I have quite a bit on my plate with all the rewatches going on so let's do something short.

I'll offer [Gunbuster](http://myanimelist.net/anime/949/Top_wo_Nerae!_Gunbuster?q=gunbuster) for two different anime movies.

Sounds good. Looking forward to it. I'll try to finish it by this time next week.
>> ARTICLE
You know what, I'll try. Standard contract: I'll trade [Magic Kaito 1412](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25517/Magic_Kaito_1412) (24 episodes) or [Kyousougiga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_(TV) (10 episodes) for something 12-24 episodes as well. I prefer something not gritty but will take most anything.
>> ARTICLE
I'll trade [Gatchaman Crowds](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18229/Gatchaman_Crowds) for Kyousougiga. They seem decently similar in tone.
>> ARTICLE
I have a question. I remember trying an episode of Gatchaman Crowds but it seemed fairly over the top is that the case? Despite my love for Kyousougiga, its a rare case and I prefer my shows to be a bit more...grounded(?).
>> ARTICLE
Depends on what you mean by 'over the top'. In terms of characters, a bit, but that's because the characters are more personifications of values systems rather than characters. In terms of story, it's pretty down-to-earth--there aren't really any tokusatsu antics after the first 2 episodes. Looking by your Hummingbird, we have similar tastes(like, really similar tastes), and the show I felt it was most similar to was the pre-Guillotine Guerilla parts of Samumenco(which I also loved).
>> ARTICLE
Alright then I will take you up on the offer then. I will give it another try.
>> ARTICLE
Cool!
>> ARTICLE
It's really frustrating when I would take Kyousougiga, but about 5 shows that I would trade is on your dropped list (SSY, ZnT, Penguindrum, Katanagatari, Magi).

EDIT: I GOT ONE, I'll take Kyou for Shirobako, (how have you not watched this yet?)
>> ARTICLE
I am incredibly lazy with my list, I rarely will put things I only watched a couple episodes of. (actually despite Magic Kaito being one my favorites, I only realized a hour ago that I never put in the completed list) Anyways Shirobako is one of those, I watched a couple episodes when it was airing but eventually other things took its place. I think I will take you up on that, seemed interesting enough.
>> ARTICLE
I'm offering Mawaru Penguindrum. I'll accept anything 25 episodes or shorter, with the exception of ecchi.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Penguindrum and it seems interesting.

Would you be willing to watch season 1 of [Kuroko no Basket?](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11771/Kuroko_no_Basket)
>> ARTICLE
Deal. Prepare for a bizarre ride. And some penguins.
>> ARTICLE
Update: I'm 13 episodes in. Enjoying it so far, absurd plot armor and all. Keep getting Shokugeki no Souma flashbacks, and Ping Pong. Maybe I just like sports shounens who knows.
>> ARTICLE
Additional Update: 18/25. Man there just isn't any downtime in this show. Aomine finally broke the plot armor by literally being so overpowered he could 1v5. Sure, you see that from time to time in high school sports but not usually at the regional level. I'm curious where this goes since there are oodles of arcs left and we've already hit an opponent who would be scouted before he graduated high school. I'm guessing this season ends on something of an anticlimax, and next season the Aomine problem gets resolved somehow. 

Anywho, gonna take a break and catch up on currently airing shows. Should be able to finish this season by Wednesday.

Haha, man I'm glad you're enjoying the ride, I haven't gotten a chance to watch Penguindrum yet because I've been at my parents house for Thanksgiving with the horrible wifi, but I'll definitely start watching it tomorrow now that I'm back in my dorm.
>> ARTICLE
No rush. It's one of those shows that can be really hard to get into at first, but then suddenly you are like what the fuck is going on oh my god did I really just watch 8 episodes what happens next i need to know what the fuck.

So I'm saying take it at your own pace.
>> ARTICLE
I'm loving Penguindrum btw I'm 3 episodes in (I'm watching the dub, I don't know if that's "the correct way", but meh it's my preference).

First things first (I'm the realest): but no, Sho>Kanba, real talk, much more relatable and less edgy guy. However Yamashita is best guy.

This fuckin' show man, it's trolled me too many times "SURVIVAL TACTIC!!!!!" I swear, I was already getting emotional and that really came out of left field. Every day should be Himari Day. NO EVERY DAY SHOULD BE CURRY DAY!!! EVERY DAY!!!! The artstyle is very vibrant, I love the use of colors in this anime so much. So many flashbacks bruh. The scene when Shoma was walking around and it was followed by a bunch of white looking bathroom door men, was really well done. Then there's the bear that shoots a pink stairway from it's crotch. "We do what you want with pleasure Ms. Hat", TOP KEK!!!!! Then out of nowhere, RAINBOW SIX PENGUIN EDITION!!!! "We all know how much I love wieners" LMAO!!!! The dialogue is god tier, and did that penguin just go muff diving? Then there's that awkward statue with two guys glued together. Just what is going on with the aesthetics of this show? and this Ringo bitch is CRAZY, certified coocoo for cocoa puffs, Gary Busey crazy. [](/s "Dat Ringo NTR Tho. I cri everytiem").

These fucking Penguins tho.

THESE FUCKIN' PENGUINS THO!!!

So adorably squishy, I want one now. (The one with the bugspray specifically)

JUST WHAT IS THE PENGUINDRUM!!!??? I HAVE TOO MANY QUESTIONS BUT TOO LITTLE TIME!!!
>> ARTICLE
This is everything I could have hoped for from your reactions and more. :D

The show stays pretty confusing. The ending is one of my favorites, but expect to still have questions after your first watch. ;) 
>> ARTICLE
Also, just finished Kuroko no Basket S1. It was good, if a little predictable (called that anticlimax with setup for the Winter Cup). I think the Shounen nature of the show hyped it up through some of the slow points (3 minutes of exposition, 8 seconds of gametime, etc). I'd recommend it to sports lovers, but I don't have any particular desire to watch the sequels. Maybe someday.

Also, their coach is somehow the most attractive thing. I don't even know why, but I found her really sexy somehow. Waifu material. So thanks for that.

I'm interested in starting the **standard contract**! So I'll trade off the glorious [Hamatora The Animation] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/20689/Hamatora_The_Animation) 
or [Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/11843/Danshi_Koukousei_no_Nichijou) for anything 12-24~ episodes or less! Doesn't matter the genre, I'm up for just about anything!

My [MAL] (http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Ducknasty) for those interested in making the swappity swaps~

Hamatora for Steins;Gate it is then.

You know, I've heard so many good things about that show and just never gave it any attention.. So I'll gladly take that offer~

Enjoy Hamatora, that show's fantastic if I say so myself!

Thanks, I'll PM him rn

I'll start Hamatora soon, once I finish Madoka and catch up on OPM!

You got it friend~
>> ARTICLE
I added you, definitely give me your reactions to S;G. It doesn't get good until around 12, but damn it's worth it, still my favorite anime to this day.
>> ARTICLE
You got it! I'll be sure to keep you nice and updated while I watch the series~ 

I'm actually a little excited to start this one, just reading over the initial synopsis is making me already love the show!
>> ARTICLE
Here, I'll give you a little hint then. You're not ready. You think you're ready, but you're not. No matter how much you prepare yourself, you will never be ready.
>> ARTICLE
Oh geez.. I hope it's not like AnoHana or something, I can't handle that much of an emotional rollercoaster..

(Totally lying, I can handle it no problemo~...I think XD)
>> ARTICLE
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

You think AnoHana (which I haven't seen, but I know what it is and how it goes and how it's a sweet story and shit) was bad, huh? You, *sir*, are in for a shit storm.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it, as I don't like shows with time travel. Still worth it? Never done a contract before.
>> ARTICLE
As a fanboy, so much. It is so worth it. It's a very character based show, though, so if you don't like those type of shows, you may not like it. Of course, I'll still recommend it because it's fucking amazing.

*Also, it may or may not leave you depressed for a month. The PADS is real. Be warned.*
>> ARTICLE
I'll do nichibros for[ Baccano!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2251/Baccano!)

Oooo you're so on~

I've heard from a friend that Baccano's like set in the same universe as Durarararararara, right? If that's the case, I know this'll be a good one right here~
>> ARTICLE
I'm not too sure about being set the the DRRR universe, but it is definitely similar. Both involve gang wars.
>> ARTICLE
Hamatora is absolutely AMAZING. Just chiming in here with that, the art and OST is lucent.

I want to make someone else watch the hilariously-average [*Ambition of Oda Nobuna*](http://www.crunchyroll.com/the-ambition-of-oda-nobuna/episode-1-nobuna-and-the-monkey-601565). I watched it because someone else told *me* it was super average, and... well... meh. It's OK. Don't regret watching it. Pretty good last episode, but that's to be expected. I gave it a 6/10 because I chuckled every time something was generic and average.

In exchange, make me watch the most average show you know of! Oh, but not more than around 24 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I'll take it and give you Kakumeiki Valvrave.
>> ARTICLE
Mecha, eh?

Well, I'd usually avoid it, but here goes nothing!
>> ARTICLE
Oh, if you want try a good mecha series try the airing, Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans, or the about to end rewatch of Gundam 00. Both are pretty good.

>> ARTICLE
It's not that... I usually avoid all mecha regardless of quality, because I personally just find the whole idea of giant (fighting) robots to be unappealing.
>> ARTICLE
You must be my evil twin. I watch all mecha regardless of quality cause I can't get enough of the idea of giant robots fighting.
>> ARTICLE
Look forward to it! It's got a hilariously b-grade plot with high end Sunrise production values. It takes itself very seriously, but if you try and view it from a distance, it's really easy to enjoy. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm noticing some bland worldbuilding, and just about everything I've seen having to do with the actual mech seems really cheesy. Also, the whole [](/s "guy's girlfriend seems to die, but oh hey she's not really dead in the second episode") is kinda disappointing but not really *bad* because of what that should do to the show considering the MC's whole motivation (I'm not *too* much further than that)...

Pretty much what I was asking for!
>> ARTICLE
I'm interested in starting a contract. Looking for a 1-4 cour series, either from my PTW or something else good I may not have considered yet. Both sides of the contract should watch about the same length.

~~**Standard Contract**: I'm interested in doing *a single contract*, but will give five  options for a series (or group of series) that is 10-15 episodes.~~

[**~~Now Sign~~**](#stare)

I'll take you up on watching Symphogear should you in return watch [Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (My Little Monster)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14227/Tonari_no_Kaibutsu-kun)

It has 69 popularity ranking...I may have worded that wrong...I meant above as 500+.

Ah, sorry, how about [Mitsudomoe](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7627/Mitsudomoe) then? #916 popularity ranking, should be closer to what you're looking for in popularity.

I just got done with Joshiraku...not exactly in the mood for a cute girl type comedy (I am sorry for being kind of picky...)

Okay, last try. How about [Ping Pong The Animation](http://myanimelist.net/anime/22135/Ping_Pong_The_Animation)? 692 popularity, not cute girl. And don't worry about pickiness, we can all be like that.
>> ARTICLE
...just finished watching Kaiba (same director)...but also just finished downloading this on a whim...so I take this!

A side note for Symphogear, turn off your brain and don't take it that seriously, it's a ton of fun, but if you think about it too much, you will not have that much fun (Also /u/DragonsOnOurMountain recommended a certain sub group to watch for this, but I forget which one it was...)

/u/UniChai

Finished Amnesia! The only good thing about this show was the opening, artwork, and Shin. (I've fallen in love with those eyes.) Everything else was just bleh. And that cage scene... that god damn cage scene. Gave it a 4/10.

/u/Spartan448 & /u/porpoiseoflife

I haven't done my side of the contract yet, but I'll get to it soon. ;p

Take your time. I ended up thinking I'd have time to get my side of two contracts done over Thanksgiving Break.

So far that has not been the case. Damn relatives not giving me any time to shut myself in my room and watch anime.
>> ARTICLE
/u/snowywish 

Finished Joshiraku...didn't like it that much...but I honestly don't think it's my kind of thing (I'm not a cute girls doing cute things kind of fan)...Felt like  I actually knew a lot of the references (From 2001 A Space Odyssey, Dog of Flanders, Madoka, etc.), but didn't really find much funny behind them (kind of just felt like references...) and the comedy just didn't work for me (also according to [MALgraph](http://graph.anime.plus/pittman66/favorites,anime), J.C. Staff and I don't get along...). 4/10...sorry...but Cross Game and Mononoke are staying strong!
>> ARTICLE
Well I gave you two 10s and a 9... and the 9 is dead so hopefully the 10s keep up the good work!

We can write off Joshiraku against Nanoha and everything is daijobu.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the evil one on this...gave you 2 9s and 2 7s (although Utena likely would be a 8 or 9 on substance)...
>> ARTICLE
Nah man, don't feel bad. I'm making someone watch Nisekoi right now.
>> ARTICLE
/u/flatiron_bonfire I'm sure you're tired of my broken recording on this but finished Planetes; still abhorrent.

/u/keokl Kyousougiga is done. That was actually pretty fresh and exciting. Well, I suppose there's a limit to how much you can like a show if you hate the lead but honestly, I really liked it. 8/10

/u/plasticletters I feel like you never got my message so I'll tl;dr it here. Mousou Dairirin. Haven't had so much fun watching a show since when I first started anime with Madoka. 10/10
>> ARTICLE
Wait, which main didn't you like? Koto or Myoue?
>> ARTICLE
Koto. She annoyed me to bits.

Rest of the cast was really dynamic and likeable, though.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting.. I loved Koto. She's a bit of a brat, but her interactions with the rest of the characters truly added to my enjoyment. In example, [when](/s "she calmed down Yase. After that, Yase realized the kindness around her and slowly begins to mature. Her character changed after that. It may not have been an in your face change, but her aura was definitely different.") However, I can see why you would find her annoying. All in all, I'm glad you enjoyed the show (for the most part anyway)!
>> ARTICLE
Yo /u/berzha101, watched s1 of School Rumble, and I liked it so much, I started s2, currently 18 episodes in. Good shit.

/u/thabz21, I finished S1 of Gin no Saji. S2 next!
>> ARTICLE
/u/ziztark

Completed Seitokai Yakuindomo last night. It reminded me of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei in that you really get a whole lot more out of it if you can understand Japanese language/culture.

Some of the jokes made me snigger and some I had to rewatch several times to figure out the humour and some I didn't get at all no matter how hard I tried. Also a lot of the funniest bits were already spoiled by reddit... Thanks reddit!

Overall I think it's between a 6.5 and 7 for me after comparing it to other gag anime I've seen, e.g. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun has shown that you can have gag anime which are hilarious while also developing characters much more.

I think I'm still gonna watch the OVAs next though.

edit: Contract complete!

/u/milnivek

I just finished Madoka Magica today. I was actually about to finish it last night but it was like 3 AM and I ended up falling asleep (because I was tired, not bored). 

That was... interesting. Definitely not what I expected going into the show, even though I knew it was not just a "magical girls doing cute stuff" it got darker/deeper than I expected it to get.

I'm just gonna tag the rest of it as spoilers to make it easy for me.

[Madoka Magica ALL](/s "I liked it a lot, the story had really nice pacing, and great plot IMO. Although I did see the "twist" of Homura being from a different timeline coming, maybe not from the beggining but probably around episode 3 or so. What I did not expect was that she was doing it all for Madoka. I was really surprised at how they weren't afraid to kill off characters, and the fact that their death had some meaning and weren't just for shock or whatever. Mami's death had a lot of death flags before it so it wasn't very unexpected, but I really expected Sayaka to be saved by Madoka at some point. ")

[Madoka Magica ALL](/s "It was a really satisfying anime, especially the ending. I liked that it wasn't all fine after Madoka made her wish, after all there had to be some evil in the world. I do wonder though, since Madoka is everywhere anytime, would she talk to Homura every now and then? Like in the after credits scene of the last episode? That's just speculation anyways.")

All in all I'm giving it a 9/10. I wish I knew what it was missing to make it a 10. But to me it feels like there is... *something* missing to make it a 10/10 in my eyes. Also it took me a while to get used to the faces. I dont know why but they seemed weird to me at first. I do have to say, the voice acting was REALLY good, they managed to show a lot of emotion when the characters were crying or angry etc... 

Still, I'm very glad I took the contract and watched this now, because it certainly is an anime no one should miss.

How is Seitokai Yakuindomo for you? Have you started it?
>> ARTICLE
I'm really really glad you enjoyed Madoka! It also took me a while to pick up because damn it the faces, but once I started, it really did go away/grow on me. Still haven't picked up Clannad though... XD

[Madoka spoilers] (/s "That's pretty impressive! I never noticed any death flags except the one just before Mami goes to fight Charlotte, and I certainly did not have any suspicions about Homura's origins till maybe episode 5 or 6! The first time I watched it, around episode 6 or so I started to get the feeling that it was a 9 or a 10 and so I started keeping track of the plot points which I thought would not be resolved or explained well and as I recall they all were. I really love heroic, unappreciated sacrifices, so by the end of episode 12, I was just sat there shell shocked before going off on all the social medias to rave about it to my friends. It's absolutely my favourite series of all time and I love it as much as I hate its sequel.")

I'm on episode 7 or 8 of SYD right now, and hope to be done by today since I'm at home sick. I'll post a comment tagging you once I'm done!

/u/friendlypinetree 

I'm four episodes in now, *and I have no idea what the fuck is going on.*

I'm enjoying it, though. Intrigued as to what will happen.

The MC is actually pretty cute, and the OP is dope.
>> ARTICLE
Alright, I wrapped up two contracts this week:

**Crest of the Stars** for /u/durinthal

While I initially believed this series would be big on world building at the expense of character development, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Jinto and Lafiel's relationship was truly the star of the show. Crest of the Stars, which took an interesting idea in putting the focus on the empire rather than the rebellion, feels a bit dated but is still a solid sci-fi show. While I wasn't all that impressed by the battle sequences, I did enjoy the relationship between the two leads. Upon their first meeting, it's clear that Jinto feels useless next to the more knowledgeable Lafiel. However, when the show moves from Abh-controlled space into United Mankind territory, Jinto takes the lead, reinforcing the show's claim that everyone is differently talented. Throughout the series we see Jinto and Lafiel learning from each other- Jinto finds his courage, while Lafiel realizes that doing what's right can be more important than doing what makes sense. On the technical side, the animation hasn't aged the best, but I really enjoyed the soundtrack, and the opening theme was really nice. Overall, I liked this show, and I'll probably start watching Banner of the Stars soon.

Final Score: 7.5/10

**Kyoukai no Kanata** for /u/AmirZ

I didn't think a studio like KyoAni would be able to do a good action show, but Kyoukai no Kanata surprised me. The animation is gorgeous, the cast is funny and likable, and the fight sequences are great, although the plot falters by comparison, and the ending kind of felt like an asspull. The show introduces a lot of interesting ideas, but several of them aren't elaborated upon. For example: What is the Society's beef with the Nase family? Why does Fujima want to [](/s "end the world? Was the Society telling the truth about him being a rogue agent?") And how did [](/s "Mirai come back to life? I'm glad she didn't die, but there should be a good explanation for it.") The show was decent despite its plot issues. I'm planning on watching the movie later on.

Final score: 6/10








>> ARTICLE
> Crest of the Stars

Glad you liked it! The animation is definitely the weakest part of the series to me, though I never minded it all that much. I've also only recently realized how different the [opening theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJEBcXIqNp0) is compared to your average anime pop/rock theme, though I suppose at the time it aired this wouldn't have been that unusual.

Banner of the Stars carries on the relationship Jinto and Lafiel havemy favorite part of the seriesbut shifts focus to cover more of the broader conflict between empires. I was reminded of that aspect when watching Gunbuster last week, which surprised me by [how much I enjoyed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3tv6z0/what_have_you_watched_this_past_week_that_is_not/cx9hgax) (in case you missed my post about Gunbuster/Diebuster then).

Just finished Millennium Actress and it's definitely my favorite Kon work (so far)!

I think this is why I couldnt give it higher than 7 for me. The directing is amazing, the switches from timepreiods and perspective was really similar to his other works that I liked the most(Perfect Blue and Paprika) but I just couldnt connect to the story as much as the others.

Always nice knowing that the ones I picked gets good scores.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its interesting watching it back-to-back with Perfect Blue which I think is better but somehow I enjoyed watching Millennium Actress more. I'll be interested to see how Tokyo Godfathers is compared to these two. Kon is just too good so I can't see myself not enjoying it. 

They've all been great and enjoyable so far!

I went into Tokyo Godfathers knowing nothing. [I thought it was like a gangster movie because of the name](/s "its not"), and was genuinly suprised what the movie managed to accomplish. It was emotional while still being primarily a comedy. You're in for an odd chase.

Most anime that ended up being rushed adaptation would have probably been better retooled for the time they where given.

Or even more so, anime that end on a 'read the manga' ending would do better with atleast some kind of ending.

>> ARTICLE
Haganai would probably benefit from this if they tried to make a season 3. I don't even know how the author managed to ruin everything in the last few volumes.

Holy shit the ending was bad.

Threw away everything for the trap. Rushed as fuck.
>> ARTICLE
Yukimera wasn't a real trap though...

would have been nice to have gotten a Rika ending. She was my fav.
>> ARTICLE
Watching the series, this is what I was expecting.  Rika was the hilariously perverted comic relief from start to finish, _but_ she was also one of the first people to honestly and openly talk with Kodaka about both his feelings and her own, and Sena+Yozora were so tied up in their frenemy competitions that it was very frequently "Kodaka+Rika.... taking care of the kids and the trap."  Not to mention that he _externally_ monolgues about his attraction to her more than once and otherwise doesn't seem _that_ interested in the other cast unless they are deliberately flaunting their sexuality in front of him.  I mean, come on, if you're a heterosexual guy, you've _gotta_ be in love with someone to be willing to read boylove to them at their request.

Given the way the series aggressively mocks anime and gaming stereotypes, I fully expected Yozora and Sena to both lose because one of them was the "obvious" choice from the start and so the series would burn both of them.  I Just didn't anticipate Yukimura to come out of nowhere in the source material.

Hell, I'd've have even accepted Kate.  I like characters that are direct, honest, outspoken, and not petty.

>> ARTICLE
Haganai should have gone off-canon for the finale of season 2, or at least picked a better point to end on.  That goofy ass ball sequence plus a _total_ lack of resolution for _any_ of the characters' relationships _really_ pissed me off and greatly damaged my overall opinion of what I thought was an otherwise utterly fantastic parody series.

"You know all that anime cliche bullshit that we've made fun of for ~20 episodes?  Yeah, we're going to start playing all of that angst with a completely straight face now, and not have an ending at all!  Surprise, motherfuckers!"
>> ARTICLE
I feel that many LN and manga authors are generally really bad at writing satisfying endings.

>> ARTICLE
It's a problem with the quality control of these mediums. It's pretty obvious that anyone can write a LN and somehow get it published, and manga authors usually just need good art. 

I think another problem comes from no forethought in how you want the story to end. The writers just keep writing in things they think are cool, and when it comes time to wrap it all up, the quality starts to dip. Also (I'm not certain on this), I've heard that they are taught in Japan that conveying the point is more important than saying it well. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah there are so many great series, which are ruined by the author's inability to bring the story to an well-written end. 

I secretly think that HxH has also this kinda problem. The author is out of ideas and clueless how to progress the story anymore. That's just my theory why he is on hiatus.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with OP. The manga ending of Usagi Drop ruined the entire series for me. [I'm] (/s "fine with the idea of a time-skip, I actually loved seeing older Rin.

SAO. An anime-original ending for the first 14 episodes that wrapped up the whole story. And then nothing more.  
I do like SAO, but it really isn't that amazing.

The first arc of SAO is the anime-ation of the first light novel. The SAO series has like 20 light novels. How do you expect them to fit 2000% of that material into the same space...?

I'd rather see an anime original adaptation. Taking the SAO concept, keeping it in Sword Art, but executing it better. See more of the floors, more story, more character developments etc.

That does sound amazing! There are progressive LNs but SAO really would be improved if it deviated a little more. Personally, the first arc was the best, so stretching it out and having fewer time skips would have been great.

>40 upvotes on my WT! for a sub-5000 popularity show

It's not much compared to other stuff on the list... but considering the show is almost unknown everywhere, I'm pretty happy with myself. It was really fun writing about my second favourite anime, especially since it's very unknown.
>> ARTICLE
I have to say, I'm somewhat disappointed by the fact that the WT! threads with the highest scores were the ones that were popular on this sub anyway. The point of WT! threads is to discover new anime, not continue the circlejerk.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's not entirely a bad thing. Half a year ago I started to promote the spreadsheet as "ultimate recommendation" tool which would allow /r/anime users both to refer to it suggesting anime to newcomers _and_ search for the most acclaimed and beloved anime series. If Spice and Wolf, K-On! and FLCL are such series, why not? After all, maybe some people heard about this shows, but were reluctant to start them due to some reasons, and these threads were final push to make them watch it? 

Also, if someone new comes to /r/anime and is refered to the spreadsheet, it's good if he watches some popular stuff before and then dwells into something more obscure (if he wants to). If you're experienced enough and want to catch something unusual, why not check something in the middle or even bottom of the table? 

I agree, all these "upvotes" numbers are dull (same as sorting by upvotes), but there is no better measure to decide which post is better than the other. I don't feel bad if a popular show gets a great WT! (e.g. K-On!) - not like it outshines other anime anyway, and if you saw this anime, you just skip this entry and move along.

Finally, people usually upvote only those shows they have seen and liked themselves, and it's only natural. No matter how good your WT! about show X is going to be, if this show is below (or above?) 2000 popularity rank on MAL it won't get many upvotes. Would you like your hard work to not even hit front page? I doubt it. And as I've said before, it not that big of a problem if you search for the right stuff - [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JtLBsaUlkIYgokKV0CQo0naTL7TuVcTELturmAVRxo/edit#gid=0) is here just for you. 
>> ARTICLE
Still, I'd like to see people upvote on a "this thread was well-written and convinced me to watch a show I otherwise wouldn't have heard of" basis instead of a "I liked this show" basis. 
>> ARTICLE
> The point of WT! threads is to discover new anime, not continue the circlejerk.

It may [surprise you that,](http://i.imgur.com/3tG2pUo.gifv) at least in my case, even the WT! threads for popular anime *do* help people discover new anime, or convinces them to watch anime they wouldn't have otherwise considered. When I comment in this sub I regularly get replies [along the lines of this one from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3yo5bq/what_are_some_anime_which_can_be_considered_as/cyfirlf?context=2) telling me [my K-On WT! played a role in them deciding to watch K-On.](http://i.imgur.com/9tAtypU.gif) 

In the case of K-On, I was motivated to write the WT! based on my own experience with the anime. I avoided SOL and especially moe anime for quite awhile because I didn't think they were my [cup of tea.](http://i.imgur.com/SnJ5g7e.gifv) When I finally got around to watching K-On, needless to say I ended up [*kinda*](http://i.imgur.com/J69Ph7i.png) liking it and K-On [opened my eyes](http://i.imgur.com/efnvxUF.gifv) to many other anime I love which I wouldn't have considered before. 

I expected there were many anime fans who shared my former unwillingness to watch moe/SOL and wanted to create a WT! that might convince them to [give it a shot.](http://i.imgur.com/XlbaSL2.gifv) Based on the replies I mentioned earlier, it seems there were quite a few anime fans like this and that my WT! did convince some to actually *watch this*.

It was my hope to spread [peace, love, and K-On](http://i.imgur.com/WT87wII.gifv) to those who hadn't experience it yet and I feel like the K-On WT! allowed me to do so.  
>> ARTICLE
No, it's nice that we have WT! threads for popular anime that people otherwise would have skipped over. I'm just frustrated that those seem to be the only ones with a decent shot of making the front page.
>> ARTICLE
When I first came to the subreddit back in April, your WT! was what got me to watch K-On!

I had found the WT! archive and glanced through some of them, and K-On! up top was one of the ones I picked out. I'm very glad you made that thread.

These WT! threads, even for "popular" shows, are very useful for anyone first coming to /r/anime or just getting into anime in general.
>> ARTICLE
Cross Ange caught a LOT of hate when it was airing, and was called trashy/garbage/etc etc, especially by the ANN reviewers. I am glad that the WT thread is popular.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah..Spice and Wolf is the last show which needs a WT on this sub. I can't wait for someone to make a One Punch Man one.
>> ARTICLE
eh the spice and wolf WT got me interested enough to watch it.
>> ARTICLE
While writing my S&W WT!, I was actually contemplating posting it. Obviously Spice and Wolf is a popular show on this subreddit as well as in anime in general; I was kind of worried that something like this would happen. But, may I have you look at [this comic?](https://xkcd.com/1053/) 


I remembered that just because something is great, acclaimed, or otherwise well-known as good/popular, it doesn't mean that everyone and their mother has seen/experienced it. That's why I posted it instead of just saving it on my computer. I loved what I got/felt while watching the show, and I wanted to reach out to others who may have not seen it so they could experience something similar to what I did.


Yeah, I can imagine that most people only upvote the shows they have seen, like /u/kaverik mentioned, but sometimes I believe a reminder as to why we praise shows is necessary. I mean, /u/DrJamesFox did a WT! on K-On, another popular show. However, it was probably one of the if not **the** best WT/recommendation/review of a show I've seen on this subreddit.


Also lets face it, discussing a popular show such as K-On, or TTGL, or Gintama is bound to draw more participation/discussion from various users than a lesser known show such as [Denshinbashira Elemi no Koi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7718/Denshinbashira_Elemi_no_Koi), (which has an interesting [WT! by /u/__Mekakucity](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3x7xsh/wt_denshinbashira_elemi_no_koi_movie_a_truly/)) Whether or not this is a good thing is debatable, but it is a point nonetheless.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, yeah popular content is going to outshine niche/lesser known content, but that's how Reddit works on a fundamental level. I hope the mindset of "Not to continue the circlejerk/don't discuss popular shows" does not deter content makers from creating good content on shows that they may be passionate about, but are popular as well. I figure that as long as the content itself is solid and not 'hurr durr TTGL fight tha powah hype hype' it does not contribute to the degeneration of the subreddit.

So... the year is drawing near to its conclusion! But before we look back, count numbers and summarize some interesting information, let's see what this December offered us. We've got two "wolf" recommendations (I was surprised there was none for [Spice and Wolf](https://redd.it/3x6o47) before!), as well as /u/7TeenWriters start of Satoshi Kon's WT!/reviews ([Tokyo Godfathrs](https://redd.it/3xrpdg) and [Sennen Joyuu](https://redd.it/3yl6mp) so far), check them out as well. Another interesting WT! was made for [Hanasaku Iroha](https://redd.it/3ygscy) by /u/illtima - check it for the world first WT! in... video format! I really like this idea and appreciate amount of work he put in producing it. Finally, I would like to draw your attention to [Dantalian no Shoka WT!](https://redd.it/3wk5e7) written by /u/Taiboss, which, in my opinion, got too little attention. Me? Had a blast with [Gatchaman Crowds](https://redd.it/3y44io) - apparently making WT! for the show was as fun as watching it. 

Alright, 2015 ends tomorrow (or the day after tomorrow for some time zones), so it's high time to see what it brought to us... with WT! threads in mind, of course. So, here we have some interesting statistics and food for thought (not really):

* **326** - total amount of WT! threads written by people of /r/anime during 2015. With the introduction of WT! tag in mid-February we can safely say that there was published one WT! thread on average every day.

* **789** - maximum amount of upvotes that got WT! thread. No wonder it's K-On! thread written by /u/DrJamesFox.

* **33** - amount of shows that got at least two WT! threads, with Kara no Kyoukai, Hanasaku Iroha and Seirei no Moribito already having three threads. Relevant reminder: if you see that there is already a WT! thread written by another person, but you feel that you're able to sell the show even better, don't hesitate to try it!

* **29315** - total amount of upvotes that WT! threads accumulated this year. Not sure what this number shows, but I guess it's *big*.

* **90** - average amount of upvotes that WT! threads got this year. It's more than enough to show up on the front page!

Finally, some words from myself. It was a very interesting year for me - first time I saw appearance of WT! tag I started immediately thinking about various anime I could write about. Admittedly, my first attempts were quite poor - I tried to write at least one thread a day, and then two threads a week - something that really affected quality of outcome. However, slowly I realized the idea of "quality over quantity" and slowed down the pacing of these threads, while spending more time on structure and coherence. As a result, I made several threads that were quite successful, such as [Mawaru Penguindrum](https://redd.it/3u9fpz), [Space Dandy](https://redd.it/3pthso), [White Album 2](https://redd.it/3in0qm) and [FLCL](https://redd.it/3m8y6t), with the latter being my most acclaimed (or least hated) work so far. I still have a lot of room for improvement, and with this in mind I'm approaching new 2016 year.

Not only that, but I also would like to improve the whole format of [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JtLBsaUlkIYgokKV0CQo0naTL7TuVcTELturmAVRxo/edit#gid=0) and these compilation threads. New columns with date of the post? Year when anime was released? Format (TV/Movie/OVA etc.)? This is something I want to make in future, though at the same time I don't want to overburden it with unnecessary information and keep it easy to navigate. If you have any other ideas, don't hesitate to leave any sort of feedback here or via PM function.

Anyway, I hope that these posts and the spreadsheet helped you at least once to find something new to watch. Thank you once again for stopping by, as usual, leave any kind of thoughts in comment section, Happy New Year, hope it brings us even more awesome anime to watch and talk about, and see you all in 2016!

Does sorting by upvotes really add anything to these lists? The popular shows are at the top, and I kind of feel that the writers of the low voted WT! would feel discouraged from trying again.
>> ARTICLE
You have a point, but unsorted list isn't good too, especially in the spreadsheet where amount of threads on the main page is almost 300. It would be impossible for a newcomer to tell what's good and what's not when there are just _so many of them_. As I've said before, I'm also not a fan of sorting by upvotes, but it's necessary evil since there is no better measure so far that I can think of.

Just when I re-fueled my tears after *Ano Hana* ended ...

Anyways  as someone who hasn't read the manga  the episode/premise were fine hooks. Projecting with 10 weeks left is likely futile, but I hope this series won't turn to melodrama (or toward that manga ending which I've read about, albeit without the specifics).

I am also digging the visuals  not too hard for a title to look good, but Production IG's art style looks quite the treat.

I like the visual style, easy looking light pastel/watercolour palate. 

I hope it isn't just slice of life after this. There has to be some substance and drama to give it a bit more weight.

It's my favorite show of the season so far.  It did a lot with silence and body language.  I think Daikichi and Rin speak what, twenty words to each other?  But you can feel their bond very quickly.  Overall it reminds me of Mushishi or Haibane Renmei, only with copious hhhnnnnnggggg.

Didn't cry, at least not to the extent of say Cross Game's first episode, but I may have had a little something in my eye.

They mentioned that she has a delayed speech problem or she doesn't talk or something. When Rin spoke with Daikichi, she seemed fine to me. Does she have an official disorder or was she just shy?
