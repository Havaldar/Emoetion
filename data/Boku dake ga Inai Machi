Depends on how you interpret that, maybe the subs are off and/or it's meant to be ambiguous. Could mean it wasn't fulfilled that morning/when they went to school first thing in the morning. 

Ye I dunno but I'VE GOT HOPE!

EDIT: /u/GWHistoryBot's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/434b24/spoilers_boku_dake_ga_inai_machi_episode_4/czfdmin) further down has got my back! 


>I kinda feel like there was an important mistranslation on the crunchyroll subs for the last line for anyone who watched there, they translatated  to [Satoru's narration](/s "The last promise between me and Hinazuki was never fulfilled.") But he doesn't actually [](/s "qualify the non fulfillment as never happening"). 

>I think that the word choice here is important because we're relying on Satoru to deliver the story to us and he seems to be a trustworthy narrator (as opposed to an unreliable narrator) that's telling the story from the viewpoint of both someone who is currently living it, and someone who has an idea of the outcome. 

>In other words, the crunchyroll subs seem to indicate that (at least to me), from this episode onwards till the end of the show, [](/s "the promise won't be fulfilled and Hinazuki's questionable disappearance is a repetition of the original past"), though that remains unclear since it hasn't been investigated by Satoru yet. 
>> ARTICLE
This.

(Hinazuki)(with)(last)(exchanged)(promise)(topic marker)(wasn't fulfilled)

Reordered: 
The last promise (topic first) I (omitted subject it happens in Japanese) exchanged with Hinazuki wasn't fulfilled.

If it included never it would have been something along the lines:  


(nidoto)=never again 

Hatasarenakatta doesn't imply "never", the promise wasn't kept that's all he says. If the people subbing this read the manga (I didn't) might have just spoiled the next episode.

Satoru's mom is the best mother I've seen in anime. That was the most satisfying scene in this series so far! 

Also I was wondering when they were going to pull the rug out from under us considering there are eight more episodes left.

Question is will Satoru get flung back in time again or will we just try to figure out who did it?
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing. He tries to save the girl, but he hasn't tried to figure out who did it. He is just solving one symptom and not the disease.

>Satoru's mom is the best mother I've seen

I absolutly **loved** it that she was initally potrait as this bad kind of mother in ep1. Makes it somewhat special and very interesting that we see her real (?) side now.
>> ARTICLE
Through the first episode my reactions to her changed completely, it was soon very clear how clever,intelligent and logical she was. Then bam shiv a bitch.
>> ARTICLE
Shit, she's one of the best mom's I've seen in any form of fiction.  She's supportive, she listens to her son and can read between the lines, she trusts his judgement, and she will stand up for him even if she doesn't know the whole story yet.  Mom of the Year.
>> ARTICLE
They didn't seem very close in the beginning and she says something along the lines "sorry for not believing you" in the first episode so that might be the cause of their not so great relationship
>> ARTICLE
Am I crazy that in the first episode, I really thought she was a crappy mother? I started to love her right before she died but at first she seemed like a bad mom.
>> ARTICLE
I actually really liked her during the first episode. She seemed extremely strong willed and intelligent. 

She also didn't judge Satoru and was there to support him after the accident. 
>> ARTICLE
She didn't seem like a bad mother, but it didn't seem like the two of them had as amazing a relationship as we're shown from when Satoru was a kid.
>> ARTICLE
Well I'm pretty sure they hadn't had a great relationship at first. Hence the mom acting all surprised when he acts close to her in like episode 2.

Or that's how I understood it anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he necessarily had a bad relationship with his mom, just that interacting with your mom at 10 and 29 isn't quite the same thing
>> ARTICLE
And when you're a 29 year old stuck in your 10 year old body interacting with your mom who got stabbed to death last week but actually won't be stabbed to death yet for another 18 years, let's just say the relationship is *complicated*.
>> ARTICLE
I get so much anxiety from this show.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I spent the whole episode just waiting for it to happen, glancing over the time left wondering if they were going to make to the end of the episode;

And when it finally happened, and I started thinking about it I realized something about me. Usually I would never advocate the death penalty, and from a neutral point of view im against it because our legal system is so flawed. But thinking about the criminal at the end of this episode I couldnt stop building this anger inside me. Was it real life, and a loved one was affected and I knew who did it, Im afraid I dont know if I would be able to stop myself. This is scary. I can see how people get lost on this in real life...

>> ARTICLE
That is what I've been wondering about - is that the cause?  Or was there just nothing embarrassing to slip up about before?

I assume it's because he's trying, thanks to Hinazuki, not to filter his thoughts around her so much. And sometime he slips up when they're not alone.
>> ARTICLE
Im starting to think he's slowly turning back into a kid and all his cute little slip ups might just be his 10 year old brain overwriting his 29 year old self. But I might REALLY be overthinking it there and I dont really feel like reading the manga or anything.
>> ARTICLE
Doubt it, he's been making those slip-ups from the start. Seems like his 10 year old body just doesn't like/can't suppress those feelings all the time.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's it. He also slips up while talking to other people, like the teacher, and gets flustered a lot about things he usually wouldn't at age 29 (like the high-five with Hinazuki in episode 2 or talking with his mom on their way from Hinazuki's place).

I expected while he was running back home all happy that HE'D get kidnapped instead, and then Revival would take him back to the beginning once more.

I'm not sure which I hate more, probably only because we don't know YET what really happened to Hinazuki.

Did she really get murdered or is it just some problem with her mom, or did she just arrive late as she usually would?

I really like how they managed to do that in the anime. In the manga it was just two separate text entries, one in a bubble another boxed.

I love how realistically they respond to his slip ups. The two get a little embarrassed when he calls her pretty but she doesn't beat the fuck out of him and he doesn't start babbling like an idiot. They both know how much they care for each other and leave it at that. It's quite refreshing.

Exactly. Also a supportive (as opposed to non-existent) parent figure. Breaking anime fundamentals, almost.

The only other anime that I've seen have somewhat realistic parents are in Death Note(~for anime) and parasyte the maxim ([parasyte major spolier](/s "and they get killed of half way through the anime;RIP well developed parents in anime charcters gotta live on their own")

>> ARTICLE
Some romance anime does have characters who calmly take up the proposition. Also, the kids are at an age where they still are figuring out the importance of serious relationships. So that innocence really helps. Though Satoru's mind is that of an older man, this probably feels new to him too, as it seems he has stopped living a proper childhood after what happened to the kidnapping cases.

I was so terrified someone else was going to be the victim in her place, making Satoru deal with the ramifications of choosing one life over another's, but then when he was walking home alone I was ready for *him* to be the victim instead. ESPECIALLY going there at midnight, Jesus Christ man the murderer's still out there! You don't have the physical safety of a 29-y/o now!

I dunno if I'm happy or sad that I'm wrong. Unless the child services theory holds true, then someone else still might be the first victim. What's up with Yuuki and the truck by the riverside? And I thought those replacement gloves would've made Kayo's mother flip out. Oh God I need it to be next week.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the same thing at night! He's not invincible at all

>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure why they showed Yuuki and the truck (maybe to prove he really wasn't the murderer, that he had an alibi that night?) but the guy in the truck was just Yuuki's father. Yuuki works in his father's store IIRC, was mentioned in an earlier episode.

I still think Sensei is suspicious as fuck. Something about his demeanor is just really off-putting, and out of all the characters introduced, he seems to be the one who has the most information about the current overall situation. In terms of who has the info to pull of a kidnapping, I think he's pretty high up there.

Man I don't know what it is, but kid romance is always so damn sweet and I can't help but smile during all of it. I smiled for like almost the whole episode because it was just so cute. 

On another note, it's interesting that there are still things that line up with his normal past despite him changing a crap ton of things. Is it the concept of time travel where no matter what you do, certain things will stay the same and that you cannot actually change the past? 
>> ARTICLE
> Is it the concept of time travel where no matter what you do, certain things will stay the same and that you cannot actually change the past?

I think more that due to his lacks in memory, he is actually repeating many of the actions he did the first time, like he did with the iceskating. He probably also took Kayo to the museum instead of them meeting there as he claimed. Because I can see no way Kayo's mother let her go there alone. He is only changing important moments he can always remember, like with Kayo in the park.
>> ARTICLE
We're all assuming he's doing the things he is because he has the mind of an adult, but why are we always assuming he was stupid as a kid?

Once I started considering him more like Kenya, I started realizing that his mentality might still be quite similar to that of his childhood, so he ends up making similar decisions.
>> ARTICLE
I've mentioned this before but I think that when MC was a child in the previous reality (i.e. actually a child) he would've been very caught up in the advice his older, slightly weird friend gave him which was basically 'fake it until you make it' in terms of social situations, friends, etc.

That kind of faking takes a lot out of you, so he may not have noticed some strange things, may even have been doing badly in school and neglecting his mother (to a small degree - perhaps just not being thankful enough and such).

It's also a nice cinematographic trick, which this show in particular pays a lot of attention to. Not this trick, but cinematography.

Also, [this shot was far too cute for me](http://i.imgur.com/nAp6cJF.jpg). I might have gone "*Hnnnnnnng*!" but you'll never be able to prove anything.

Awww man I spent this entire episode feeling dread. I just knew he couldn't have done it :( I wonder if the "it was exactly 5000 yen 18 years ago" line was hinting at nothing having changed, or if it meant nothing like the manga line? Or maybe they both meant something... @w@ 

I'm interested to see if it's going to go the same way as the previous kidnappings, that is, if Kayo *has* been kidnapped. I reckon her finishing Satoru's present has something to do with her disappearing/not showing up.

The ED fits so well with the show.

According to wikipedia, she did the background music for the show as well, which explains why I thought some of the tracks in this episode sounded so much like Madoka Magica.

I've read the entire translated manga after watching the first episode and yet this anime still continues to surprise me. It is one thing to see drawings and try to fill in the blacks of their acting and to see so much detail and care the people who worked on this put into the anime.  

This animation, the VA, the little physical things they do, they feel so alive. It makes the events that much harder to swallow because I actually give a shit about these people. This is one of those anime that will be a thing people look back as a show done well. Provided the story doesn't derail in the manga (its going incredibly strong btw don't worry)

I'm not sure about AOTY or anything but damn I'll be so happy if another anime can usurp this quality, because that means we not only get one absolutely amazing series this year.

Sometimes predictable is what works best. Nothing crushes the MCs soul as much as utter failure after thinking he was succesful.

It was to give you a feeling of dread through the entirety of the show.

> parents

Just so you know, that guy is not her father; it's just the mom's boyfriend. It was already mentioned in the manga but the anime just seemed to skip that piece of info. Just wanted to clear that up since everyone seems to think it's her dad.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was a given. I haven't read the manga, it just seemed like the typical single-mother-with-a-scum-of-the-earth-boyfriend trope, especially the bit where he was shown smugly drinking a beer and watching TV while Hinazuki was being abused in the next room.
>> ARTICLE
Such a satisfying feeling when Satoru's mom stopped Kayo's mom from hitting Kayo.

Great to see more of her.
>> ARTICLE
So refreshingly different than the normally non-existant parents in anime.
>> ARTICLE
Seeing her stand up for Satoru and be so supportive towards his relationship with Kayo was awesome to see.

Instead of having non-existent parents, there are awful parents in this show and amazing ones.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda feel like there was an important mistranslation on the crunchyroll subs for the last line for anyone who watched there, they translatated  to [Satoru's narration](/s "The last promise between me and Hinazuki was never fulfilled.") But he doesn't actually [](/s "qualify the non fulfillment as never happening"). 

I think that the word choice here is important because we're relying on Satoru to deliver the story to us and he seems to be a trustworthy narrator (as opposed to an unreliable narrator) that's telling the story from the viewpoint of both someone who is currently living it, and someone who has an idea of the outcome. 

In other words, the crunchyroll subs seem to indicate that (at least to me), from this episode onwards till the end of the show, [](/s "the promise won't be fulfilled and Hinazuki's questionable disappearance is a repetition of the original past"), though that remains unclear since it hasn't been investigated by Satoru yet. 
>> ARTICLE
> seems to be a trustworthy narrator

He is a trustworthy narrator when it comes to whats going on, but I don't really trust him when he talks about the past. His memory has too many gaps.
>> ARTICLE
When everything is going well in an anime like this, it just leads me into more anxiety. 

Keep wishing nothing bad happens and then that ominous music and empty desk shot darkens the day. 
If optimism could be visualized this episode, it was all up until the last few minutes, then a Tower of Terror drop. 

But anyways, Satoru's mom for best girl. 

Edit: As I mentioned somewhere else, the people and events around him seem to be correcting themselves based on his new actions. Either that or they're setting up a false fear and everything will be rainbows...

Also, I love the ironic title, Accomplishment.

About halfway through I thought that he changed it so that money thief girl was killed instead of Hinazuki. I wish I had been right instead of it only pushing her disappearance back a day

The framing of characters and use of expression to convey feeling in this show is fucking fantastic.  There's so many shots in the fist 4 episodes where they use framing instead of exposition to explain how characters feel about one another.  

I love that the show is confident enough in it's direction to let you infer these things yourself instead of falling back on the inner monolgue exposition that many other anime's rely on to convey it.

Just because satoru stopped the murder that day doesnt mean the killer was going to give up. I think he shouldve focused on finding the killer from the beginning. Maybe he will now, but then he might end up being the victim instead OH GOD.

Great adaption as always. The directing is phenomenal and the cliffhanger was well done. I really like the art style for the anime even more than the manga. Kayo especially looks [better.](http://indoanime.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/indoanime.xyz_Kayo-Hinazuki.jpg)

I'm really liking the pacing too. Many manga adaptions that try to reach a certain point in the material (in this case, the end) seem to rush the adaption in order to fit into the 12 episode quota but I have absolutely no qualms with this adaption. This continues to be the best anime of the season.

That sudden orchestration that hits when they stop at the park gave me absolute chills, and the lighthearted tune during the birthday party as well as the eerie track as the episode ends were perfect.

Yuki Kajiura is a fucking genius.

So many simple, sweet promises being made between these two, yet they must fight against fate to keep them. Fucking hell.

This show has no filler at all, everytime watch an episode just before the end I move my mouse to confirm it's only 20 minutes long. It is ridiculous how high quality it is. reminds me of watching sherlock or a Chrisopher Nohlan film like (e.g prestige or momento). If it continues like this it may overtake Blast of Tempest and Death note as my favourite anime

Another amazing episode... I'll be honest here, stupid as that may be:

Of all the shows I've picked up in the past year, this is the best by far(yes, even Amagami...Sorry, /u/AmethystItalian).

It's already somewhere in my tops of all time, and if it keeps up the pace, it's basically guaranteed a top 5 spot.

Hopefully the ending can do the rest of the show justice.

It's amazing what this show's done already...for me.

I laugh when they laugh...I cringe when they cringe...I tear up when they do... I feel righteous anger towards a 2D character, for a 2D character.

So basically he played the good guy and tried to save her and it looks like that has failed, she's either been kidnapped or her mother has had a part in her death this time so does this mean she's going to die as long as she's in that town and the only option is to forcibly take her out of the town (assuming time does indeed get reset) long enough for the killer to either give up on her or get caught or for her mother to get caught by CPS.

If that does happen, I'm assuming we won't get the same "lovey-dovey" relationship between Kayo and Satoru the second time around which is going to be interesting to see, he's going to basically have to sacrifice his friendship with Kayo to save her life and she'll never know or something along those lines?

It would just be pointless if he doesn't save her somehow so I know she's getting saved it's just the how I don't quite understand yet. Either way, this anime is fucking godlike. I kind of find it weird how everyone is expecting a relationship somewhere along the lines between Satoru and someone else, after this, there's no chance of that happening surely? He's 29? or so in the present times and Airi is still in high school so that's a no-go. If he does have to play the bad guy to save Kayo, that isn't happening and I never expected it to anyway so I don't think this is an anime where Satoru is going to be in a relationship at all. Hell, I don't even think there's going to be a happy ending.

This is likely a red herring, I haven't read the manga but I think the teacher is sketchy but innocent. After all the night that hinazuki was to be murdered, they showed a scene of him at the school working. Maybe it's not that solid of an alibi, or who knows maybe I'm just over thinking it.

The fact that we see the mother walking into town in nice clothes suggests she had a meeting.

Which may mean child protective services got involved and Hinazuki has been removed from the household. It's possible that she was just moved away to live in foster care.

I wonder if there will be a time jump forward in the near future. (not a supernatural one, just time passing)

MC's slip-ups and confronting Kayo's mother is a bit uninspired. HE should have known better. Good thing his mom came to the rescue.

Hinazuki's subtle 180 was great to see, Mom-san came through in the clutch and even humbled Bitch Mom-chan. And that montage showing all the relevant characters and their whereabouts during X-night was so well done. Of course knowing the cliffhanger was coming didn't make it hurt any less.

Why is no one talking about the Deja Vu's? It's probably the most important reveal of this episode. To me, it tells us either of two things;

1. He's already been through this situation many times and failed only to restart.

2. He can't change the future because things keep happening as they should no matter how much he changes.
>> ARTICLE
I think it tells us the second rather than the first. The Deja Vu's revealed that despite the changes Satoru has made from the original timeline, Kayo is still on the same trajectory, so to speak - in the original timeline he met her there coincidentally while in this timeline they go there together, but the conversation they had was exactly the same. So Satoru gets scared that his attempts to change the future might be ultimately meaningless, and that Kayo may be destined to proceed along the chain of events leading to her death ... which is basically exactly what happens (assuming she is dead from the end of the episode).

I don't see it as evidence that he has tried and failed to save her by going back in time repeatedly, though I feel like that may happen in later episodes. Which would be awesome, because I love that trope in time travel stories. However, the "predetermined" interpretation of time travel kind of goes against everything we know about Satoru's Revival ability - we see him go back in time twice to prevent bad things from happening in the first episode, and he succeeds both times. Perhaps the farther you go back in time, the harder it is to change its course? That might explain why he can change events relatively easily when he goes back a few seconds, but not when he goes back 18 years.
>> ARTICLE
You're misunderstanding. He's only been through one(1988) "revival." He's just seen things in his revival that still match up with what he actually saw when he was a kid. It points to the fact that time is harder to change than he would have hoped. It doesn't point to multiple revivals.

To be entirely honest, I don't believe that Hinazuki is dead, at least not yet. I realize that we also cannot assume she was kidnapped yet either, but if we are assuming that, then there's still a decent chance she's alive. It's not like I know a whole lot about the minds of kidnappers, but I kind of doubt that he would just kill her right off the bat after taking her. Also, if you see the anime's [main picture](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/77957.jpg), it shows him, hinazuki, and what appears to be the other girl who was kidnapped in the incident who we have yet to see anything about, in what appears to be some sort of a shed/shack, either hiding out, or possibly being held by the kidnapper guy (maybe? Pure speculation), which could mean there's more to happen that's yet to occur. 

Of course, there's also the thing that others have been saying, that maybe she is dead, and he'll go back in time AGAIN, but I really hope that's not the case, because, as some of us probably know, [Steins;Gate spoilers](/s "going back in time to resuce a murdered friend doesn't always work out too well"). But that's just my 2 cent([o](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQtf42qT36chOPVkxphwEecGQGIZLerG4BLkMG95xKYiR86un_R))'s

I really like the fact that they showed what every charachter that was hinted as a suspect for Kayo's murder was doing at the moment she was supposedly being kidnaped. It's like the show telling us that it knows we're trying to predict it's plot and doesn't give a shit about it.

This show is so god damn stressful. I had a few ideas as to what was going to happen this episode and I'm so glad none of them happened. 

1. In the past, he actually saved Kayo like he intended but then some freak accident happened where she died and the trauma he went through caused him to forget the accident. 

2. He save Kayo but is then kidnapped after taking her home on the 1st. 

3. At some point, I had a strong feeling it was actually the teacher behind it all but that quickly went away.

This episode had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The fact that everything was warm and fuzzy only added to my feelings of impending dread.

Might just be an animation error, but during this episode, Kayo's mum had a red eye, much like the mystery dude from episode 1.

If you give enough attention, there's other people has the red eye too (eg. yuuki).  
Kayo's parents does have the red eyes since last ep so it's not an animation error.

From what I can see and have watched in the past 4 episodes, I believe that time is basically telling him, You can change certain events but the inevitable will still occur. No matter who you involve or how it is done time will take what it wants. By that I mean in episode 3 He remembers doing the exact same thing, by slowing down and letting the other guy win. Just like in Episode 4 except it was more evident to the viewer since Satoru is experiencing Deja Vu and remembering that he was infact alone, at the museum, and in the case of his birthday able to have left over sandwiches from spending, once again 5000 Yen. I feel like this show is going to give us hope over and over again only to simply shit all over you.

Just re-watched the 4 episodes with my 9-11 yo daughters with french subtitles on wakanim ( they are not good enough in english to read the subs on crunchyroll ) , they LOVED IT ! They were hooked at the start of EP1 and forced me to give some money to wakanim to remove ads / wait time so we could bing watch the other 3 eps. They also both agree that the MC is better looking than their boyfriends and that 2d > 3d , did I raise them well or i'm a failure as a dad?

After the show we looked at the voice actors while speculating about who is / are the killer , and noticed that Hinazuki is voiced by the same VA that play Madoka :o

Love this anime haha, gotta prepare for what might happen though. It's funny and so cool!

Right as I was thinking to myself, "This mystery thriller just turned into an elementary school romance and for some reason I'm okay with that." And then She didn't show up to school. I hope she's not dead.

That felt like a longer episode than normal, but it was still amazing. This show is going to destroy me, I just know it.

Looks like everyone forget that murderer-kun still lurking out there
>> ARTICLE
The OP is probably my favorite of the season. The ED is pretty good too. Hell, the entire soundtrack is phenomenal. This show is making great use of art style, backgrounds, characters, pacing, music, etc. Pretty much everything, really, to provide a fantastic story. My enthusiasm for some other shows has fallen a bit since they've begun (Grimgar isn't as engaging or "real" as it was hyped up to be, Active Raid is a bit bland, and Shoujo-tachi hasn't gained much traction plot-wise yet), but I have enjoyed fully every episode of ERASED so far.

This is the first show where I've myself mentally freaking out about how adorable the characters are. Kayo is the cutest little girl, Satoru is the cutest little boy, and they are the cutest little couple ever. Period. No discussion needed.
>> ARTICLE
Man this whole episode had me on the edge of my seat. The whole atmosphere of this show is both suspenseful, relaxing, heartwarming, and humerus, at any random order, and at times all at once. The characters interactions flow so smoothly sometimes, even the MC. The way he speaks with both adult/child voice at the same time is so unorthodox, but yet very fitting. 
>> ARTICLE
After another amazing episode, I think I found something interesting in the OP.

You see there is [that bullet](https://sc-cdn.scaleengine.net/i/8184e2b2ea655dc18a4d3b94cefa82b4.png), then [Satoru running](https://sc-cdn.scaleengine.net/i/fd32d715a0c7434f9758f42837d1a3431.png), presumably from the bullet, or something that this bullet signifies (murderer?) on a rooftop.

Then OP cuts to the [**parking lot**](https://sc-cdn.scaleengine.net/i/e46f09dba82047e8facb0ae37491059e1.png) next to the building.

Now then, remember [this scene from episode 1?](https://sc-cdn.scaleengine.net/i/9eb969a3ea24d54fb8d09b9ea239d195.png)
Also happening in a **parking lot**, and there is that unexplained Revival, so something must have happened. 

As the first 3 pictures suggest, I really think that this unexplained Revival is foreshadowing of **another Satoru dying there on the rooftop**, through some timey-wimey stuff. It even makes sense why he couldn't see what happened.

Or something totally different, it's just a theory. Also I'm an anime-only watcher, so I have no idea whether is this true or not, just it seemed like something interesting enough to post.
>> ARTICLE
That isn't an unexplained revival... the mom stopped a kidnapping by making eye contact with the kidnapper when Satoru asked her to look around. The kidnapper [just left the girl there...](http://puu.sh/mNcZt/42f4917449.jpg)  the mom [even takes a photo the the license](http://puu.sh/mNd5l/b85668378e.jpg). Mentions the police didn't figure out who was in the [blue car.](http://puu.sh/mNdn5/be12499589.jpg) The supermarket parking lot scene is a key sure, it leads to the death of the mom, but it is not an unexplained revival.
>> ARTICLE
Let's all be honest here. With 8 episodes left, they can't just end it like that xD. I mean it's heavily foreshadowed. But still, CHANGE THE FUTURE PLEASE! SAVE HER SATORU!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;___;

Alright this show is in my top 5 now, I haven't had a show warrant such an emotional reaction from me in a LONG time. Can't wait for what's next!

So is he going to solve the mystery of the murderer during this time? Or is there going to be a Steins;gate or All You Need Is Kill situation where he keeps going back in time over and over. If it's the latter, I don't know if my heart can take that level of sadness...

Am I the only one who feels like this show is what would happen if David Fincher directed an anime?  Everything from the pacing, the wintery landscapes, the use of color, the way that the spacing and positioning of characters in frame is reflective of power and relationships, to the general feeling of gloomy hopelessness seems like it could be right out of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

I realized just now this is the perfect format for time travel being a device. It circumvents the problems i.e. what happens to his body in the future when he reruns, multiple universes, etc. and keeps a nice neat timeline intact. Like in Charlotte there are multiple times people jumped back and their worlds were kinda fucked from there but this leaves no loose ends
>> ARTICLE
I definitely agree, the time travel concept in this show is really cool. In my opinion the mechanic of "rewinding time" to when you were younger also adds another interesting aspect to the mix: an adult having to live in the body of a child. Obvious physical implications aside, this is extremely intriguing to me from a mental standpoint - while Satoru has memories of his life as an adult, surely he would be affected by his child's brain? I hope that this will be explored in future episodes along with the time travel concept, it would be neat.

HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF. **FUCK!!**

My goodness, when Hinazuki's mother threw her hand up.  
My goodness, when mom stopped her hand.  
My goodness, my fear when the door closed after Hinazuki went inside.  
My goodness, when Satoru saw Hinazuki's mother at night.

There were a lot fun moments, though. That "Are you stupid?" when she saw Satoru outside sitting in the snow was hilarious. I'll always be smiling whenever Satoru's mind slips through his mouth. Goddamn the tweaks I feel when I see them holding hands and Hinazuki blushes and teary-eyed that she couldn't finish what she was knitting.

...But I'm freakin' paranoid now at every turn. This anime, man. I can't ever truly enjoy a certain moment. Just staaaahp. Hinazuki's joy is my fear. And that goddamn cliffhanger...

Also, completely unrelated: I can't help by see the ending as the silhouette jumping back rather than skipping. Anyone else?
>> ARTICLE
This show just continues to be amazing, it has drawn me in such a way that even the small moments like the surprise party got to me. 

The voice acting was once again on point especially from the va's for young and old Satoru (stroke of genius getting live action va's for the roles). 

And that ending, I thought the passing on the scarf might have had implications for Satoru (this show likes it's yellow = victim theme) but it doesn't seem to be the case. 

Anyone else notice Kayos moms eyes were only red in when they casually meet her in the street, wonder if that is an implication with what happened overnight. 

I went into this episode trying to look out for all the details I noticed this show uses, ended up getting so swept up in the moment I forgot it all so will have to rewatch over the weekend

A-1 thank you for the wonderful direction thus far, I really hope you can keep it up (and if so hopefully funimation push out a dub) because I want this to be a show I can recommend to anyone which it is on it's way to being.

>> ARTICLE

No.

It's hard to take endings like that when we had such a happy and cute episode. This isn't that type of show though :(

I really thought bratty girl who sat next to Satoru was going to die instead this time around!
>> ARTICLE
> I really thought bratty girl who sat next to Satoru was going to die instead this time around!

That would have been an interesting twist. Not saying she deserved it, but I wouldn't have been sad to see her go.
>> ARTICLE
This episode made me think quite a bit about the background and the story.

* Why is this town empty (void of extras)? My first guess is that since Satoru is our narrator that the story is through his eyes and thus, everyone outside of his "circle" is nonexistent. Is it simply the studio's choice to not add in extras?

* I love that we got more Satoru's "deja vu" moments. It's a common theme in "traveling back in time to change the past" stories but it's a great way to show character development . I look forward to the side plot of his internal dialogue of whether or not he can legitimately change the past.

* Despite the "awwww" moments between Kayo and Satoru, I'm interested in this "relationship." Satoru got close to Kayo for the purpose of keeping her alive but what will happen if he saves her? 

* This show has one thing leaving me unsettled. Suppose Satoru saves Kayo and happy ending, does that mean he has to continue the next 18 years of his life? Does he go back to his time? It's a plot hole that hasn't been filled YET.

* I'm really interested on who that long-haired girl in the ED is (the one who is flipping); older Kayo? Someone else? Just fancy art addition?


Looking forward to the next episode!

I love how polar opposite this show is from the other A-1 show this season. It's use of tension, release and everything else about it just works. I won't deny, it was fairly obvious that the episode was going to end that way but at least the lead up felt good.

A-1 need to buckle their shit up cause at least this show has personality. They can make a decent show when they try.
>> ARTICLE
the director of this was the same one for SAO, let that sink in for a moment.... at the end of the day when it comes to any studio, the director and the source are the only things that matter. the studio only matters from an animation standpoint


>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah but at least his source material and level of talent are clearly on another level for this one.


>> ARTICLE
no argument from me buddy XD. agreed
>> ARTICLE
I think SAO was more of an issue from source material. Compiling Light Novels into a flowing anime is probably harder than just a continuous manga. Then again, the Erased anime is adapting word-for-word the manga, and its dialogue and characters aren't retarded like SAO.
>> ARTICLE
i like SAO, and i'll be the first one to tell you it's 100% the source material. specifically everything in between aincrad and alicization. and even then those two arcs aren't flawless.

Dammit!! I just knew shed be gone the next day. Kayo was the best part of this whole episode her showing her courage and smile.

The date at the Observation is really starting to confirm that hes done this before, that or his time shares moment with this new time. either way I can't wait for another Thursday  
>> ARTICLE
I hope the show continues to deliver. I'm on the edge of my seat every week thanks to the events and the music(its amazing). There's still something about sensei that throws me off, I don't know what it is but I'm not very hopeful when it comes to thinking he's a good guy. Every time Satouru had glimpses of the past I got worried. I didn't think we were out of the woods yet. The birthday surprise gave me hope but as expected at the end we are left with a bigger concern for Kayo. Its interesting seeing Satouru's perspective of and past and what he's currently living but I want to see through Kayo's point of view next episode. I'd like to see the events that occur to her through her own eyes. I'm pretty optimistic when it comes to that happening. Can't wait for next week!

Well, next week will be a long wait

This show hurts my soul. It's hard to suspect the teacher and smart-kid of any malicious intentions after this episode but the mystery is still there surrounding those two. 

I kinda got a different vibe towards Hinazuki's mother this episode too, nothing redeeming but, I don't know she seems caught off guard that people are getting involved with Hinazuki. 
>> ARTICLE
If this show stays good it'll be a great entry show for fans of murder mysteries.
>> ARTICLE
Holy cow that ending.

Joke aside, now we can really make interesting theories Hinazuki. If she was abducted that night, we can definitely assume that her mother is linked to the abductions. If she was just "absent" that day and is coming back the next day, then the problem of the abductions is *still* technically solved. If it's the former, I really hope that he will be able to come back in time to attempt to save hinazuki again.

We don't have a ton of suspects but I really hope the killer/kidnapper's neither of those two. The cliffhanger's making me think it's at least someone who'd get her in the house... or on the way to school. I'm leaning toward the former.

The direction of the anime has been top notch. 
But I have to wonder... How in the heck are they going to fit the rest of the story in 8 episodes?
At the current rate they will need 16 episodes to cover all 8 volumes. 
(This episode finished exactly volume 2)

I know the anime is going to have the same ending as the manga, which will likely also end in March with chapter 44, end of volume 8.
But... how?  I have faith in the staff as they've been doing superb job with this, but I can't wrap my head around cutting enough to catch up 4 episodes worth of material!

>> ARTICLE
I think satoru is still mssing an important fact: How can he save someone from a not-yet criminal in a crime that hasn't happened yet without even knowing who did it, and if he succeeds on saving someone that doesn't mean that the perpetrators mind has changed. there will still be a victim.

Aaaaanyways, super cute episode until that final moment that had me screaming "fuck" repeatedly. Atleast now he's got a smaller time window of the crime, also AOTY.

Does he himself cause it somehow (born with it) or is it an unknown power that wants him to fix these certain things ?

If there was a string of student murders why is Satoru ignoring the fact that two other children ended up dead? I figure it is going to be like a magic trick.  While Satoru is staring at Kayo a new first child will get killed. 

I still think that pizza girl is a reincarnation of Kayo and will vanish from reality if Kayo survives.

He's lived through that timeline before so he's moving under the assumption that murders will occur in the exact same order. He hasnt made enough of a ripple in the timeline for the murderer to suddenly change targets, and if the murders were actually performed by different people, then it is less likely that Hiromi or the other girl will die before Kayo does. Why? its because history is repeating itself and the only difference is that Satoru is making sure Kayo would not be in the park on the day where she'd have been abducted and murdered.

In a repeated timeline, there would be a higher chance for someone else to die if the murder was planned from the beginning than if the murders were completely random acts because you know exactly when the "random" murders would occur while planned murders could take a turn for better or worse depending on how much you alter that event. 

"What if it was a planned murder and the murderer gives up on killing Kayo earlier than expected because Satoru is always around and targets someone else while Satoru is guarding Kayo?" The murderer has no idea that Satoru is aware of when Kayo was gonna die. If the murderer was stalking Kayo, he wouldve studied her daily routine and decide to kill her on a day where he knows she wouldve been alone. Planned abductions take time and preparation if he didnt want to get caught, so suddenly switching targets would not only waste the murderer's time, it would also put him at a risk of getting caught because he would be less familiar with a newer, less observed target. 

Keeping these in mind, he wouldve stuck with his plans to kill Kayo until he realizes that it is simply impossible to kill her without getting caught.

God damn. What an emotional rollercoaster. After that essay the other day, I was looking out more more red and yellow colours and when she gave away her yellow scarf and was left only in red, I couldn't shake the feeling that she would be gone. I was saying "don't jinx it" out loud when he was exclaiming that he made it. He is old enough hat he should *know* that you never, ever jinx it. He's practically responsible at this point. 

I guess we now know at least why Kenya was talking to sensei.

So, please, PLEASE, let him just jump back or let her be kidnapped but alive and ready to be saved by him. Pretty please?

OK guys, after this episode I decided (more like: "I had to") pick up the manga and I realised, that the first 12 chapters where adapted into the 4 episodes. Does anyone know, how much chapters are they gonna adapt, considering that there are only 35 chapters out.

There will be around 45 chapters of the manga when it ends. The anime and manga are supposed to have the same ending, so they're either going to speed some stuff up, cut some stuff, go an alternate/anime way of going there, or a combination of the three(which is what I think will happen). Only time will tell though.

This episode felt really nice as things progressed, sadly from my experience I knew something was gonna happen, just didn't know when. I found myself repeatedly thinking, Kayos fine... its fine... ITS GONNA BE FINE GUYS RIGHT!?

I kept thinking to myself the quote "its always darkest before the dawn," meaning its always the worst before it gets better and how the opposite of this meaning could come into play as well. MC didn't know that negative stuff could happen over X day, but still the moment he dropped his guard, shit may have hit the fan.

Who knows, maybe we just got trolled and Hinazuki is just at home sick with a non-lethal Japanese cold, at least I'd like to hope so.

Last episode I started reading the manga up till chapter 10, where the anime also ended on.

Today you can join me in reading chapters 11 and 12, which contain everything that happened in todays episode. With the small exception of Yuuki's room scene that was included in last weeks episode.

Why do you gotta do me like that anime. :'(
>> ARTICLE
Can't find link to episode 4 online can someone help.

I knew that something would happen, but I somehow forgot about that while watching the episode... until the ending came.
>> ARTICLE
OH god this emotional roller coaster is going to kill my heart! And I love it!
>> ARTICLE
How am I supposed to not read the manga with that cliffhanger? 
>> ARTICLE
Yuki Kajiura's score was used more in this episode. Really helped with the tension.
>> ARTICLE
I was on edge the whole episode... Fuck it felt great 
>> ARTICLE
It's been a long time since an anime has made me literally cry out 
because of a plot twist or something terrible.

Bravo to this anime! I am super excited to experience the rest of this
>> ARTICLE
I gave in and read the manga earlier this week. I'm now immune to the spoilers. 
>> ARTICLE
ima go do the same actually. this suspense is driving me fucking crazy
>> ARTICLE
Dude. You don't go making me feel all warm and happy just to TEAR ME TO PIECES.

(10/10 great episode, great set up to a great plot twist.)
>> ARTICLE
Everybody's talking about the cliffhanger but nobody points out how [MC just got called out](http://i.imgur.com/Fm77W9o.jpg).

**First Half**: Aww this is nice...shit, that must mean the next half must have an equal amount of despair

**Second Half to last 30 seconds**: Oh maybe this will be a good ending after all

**Ending**: Wellp

I was waiting that whole time for everything to go to shit. I don't remember ever being this frustrated having to wait every week for a new episode
>> ARTICLE
Yep I knew it this show is going full Steins;Gate. And fuck I love it.
>> ARTICLE
There are only 12 episodes so I guess there will be a cliffhanger at the end of every new episode and I don't know how I will survive 
>> ARTICLE
Salute to The Bros and to their undying dedication to our MC. 
>> ARTICLE
It's so damn teasing I want to read the manga right now. Well I can, but that would make the anime a bit worse.
>> ARTICLE
The cliffhangers are real... I'm so tempted to read the manga right now :(
>> ARTICLE
What I find hilarious is ep 3's ending was Kenya talking to the teacher about the birthdays... 
>> ARTICLE
Still suspicious with their red eyes.
>> ARTICLE
Frankly I don't know what the MC was expecting, that the murderer would just say "well screw this I'm gonna become a nice person" and leave?  
Yes she didn't die on that day, but this guy's still gonna attack kids.

>> ARTICLE
So is there any explanation for why he blurts out what he's thinking all the time?  Maybe something to do with an adult personality squeezed into a kid's brain?

Also, why did he think he *won*?  I mean sure, (he thought) *this* girl was safe, but he still had no clue about the murderer who could've simply switched targets.  He hasn't "won" no matter how many he saves as long as the murderer is still free.
>> ARTICLE
This show is taking a bat to my feels, and I love it.

I enjoyed all the lovely moments with Hinazuki, knowing too well that narratively, it was never going to be that easy, and all I could wait for is the hammer to fall, which it did.
>> ARTICLE
You know how hard it is to watch Satoru's mom's death scene in episode 1 past this point? 
>> ARTICLE
does anyone know where should I start with the manga? I can take the wait anymore
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 1.  The anime cut out tons of important scenes in the first episode.  Just skim through it for manga only content until your caught up.
>> ARTICLE
This is probably the tied with Gintama and Oregairu for the most I've been absorbed in a show trying to find subtle details. I was staring at the screen trying to see if anything was off. Then the end happened and it was just a "well that happened" moment then I got all shaken up. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Well, that was depressing turn of events.

I was on edge waiting for the bad part to happen. The bad part happened.

My hopes were brought up so much. Then they were crushed. Mercilessly. I love this show.

I actually thought Satoru was to be killed but then I realized he wouldn't be able to rewind to before that. 
Anyway, great episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Inb4 Hinazuki's mother does some hoe shit and says he never brought her home. Satoru goes from having his best friend framed, to being framed, to being framed *AGAIN*.

I like this show.
>> ARTICLE
he shouldve thought it through  
he remembered celebrating his birthday well, around after her death?  
it only hit me when she was going home for the last time 
>> ARTICLE
Yay, had to wait a little before I finally got to watch it, but it's good to progress into the story a little bit more.

Things I missed out on previously but after some consideration became important:

Satoru remembers Kayo more than he remembers the chick from his own group? This flew by me at first, but thinking about it, there may have been much more to Satoru and Kayo then we are led on to believe. Some of this suspicion was proven when Satoru remembered "additional" memories of Kayo while in the museum. But I highly doubt we have seen all of his "hidden memories."

New Things that happened this episode:

In the first minutes (where the recollection occurs), he goes to the hideout to find his gloves. However, it seems to be snowing an awful lot, which is weird as it was mentioned that they don't go to the hideout in the snow in fear that someone might find it.AND WAIT A SECOND. HE SAID THE TIME WAS A LITTLE BEFORE 6. THERE'S ALREADY SNOW THERE A LITTLE BEFORE 6? In the new timeline, they leave a little after 6, and the snow just starts coming down. UH OH. I see a memory mishap occurring.

We also see some minor characters doing their regular participation (literally few lines), as well as some fast shots of them doing seemingly normal things. Things to note are : Kenya playing with soccer ball by himself, Hinazuki's mother NOT AT HOUSE, and the mystery boyfriend of Hinazuki's mother drinking in a pub.

Also, let's keep in mind Satoru's mother works for the news dept.

So what do I think:

Well, this is actually leaning more towards "continuing cycle" theme, especially with the fact that MC definitely has some memory issues. His progress is hindered by himself, ultimately resulting in creating his own predicament by himself. HOWEVER, I believe that there has been enough evidence of "change" to still cling to the hope that everything will be DAIJOUBU.

The fact that things are going awry further complicates who the abductor would be, but That's going from square 2 to square 1 so I don't really mind.

Something that bugs me is that Hinazuki's mother seems to be away from the house. While this could be the influence of Satoru's constant interaction with Hinazuki, it might be that Social Services are coming around yet again, forcing her to leave the house. Further evidence of this is that Hinazuki was able to go to the museum even without help of Satoru, which means there hasn't been beating for a little while, even in the unchanged past.

Tentative weekly prediction:

Present time killer (of Satoru Mom): Kenya + the gang
Past time Abductor: Social Service worker for Child services (15%?)

God this show is so good. Easily gonna be in my top 10 of all time but god COULD I GET LIKE 1 EPISODE WHERE NOTHING GOES WRONG AND EVERYTHING IS CUTE AND HAPPY AND FUZZY?! FOR FUCKS SAKE PLEASE I DON'T NEED THESE HEART CONDITIONS.

I knew it was too early for her to be saved...

I absolutely love the bits where he thinks out loud. but aww fuck man I really hope hinazuki is fine.

NO, I WANT OFF THE EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER

I knew it was coming but i still wasn't ready. Doesn't help that the episode made me drop my guard with all the heartwarming moments.
>> ARTICLE
FUCK!!! I NEED MORE NOW!! IT CAN'T END LIKE THIS!!! 
>> ARTICLE
The second I hear the teacher say that Kayo was late: FUCK FUCK FUCK THIS FUCK KAYO'S MOM FUCK! FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!


>> ARTICLE
History is a bitch. It keeps trying to "correct" itself despite Satoru's efforts. The scenes in the museum should've been a hint. Goddamn is it inescapable. URGH!! This show is so good. Still, who the fuck is the culprit? It looks like Kayo's mom seems to have changed when she met Fujinuma's mom. I think the scenes with her walking makes it look like she's looking back at her actions and she wasn't as hostile when Satoru came and pick up Kayo.

Man, don't tell me that being late and not going to Kayo's house the day after their birthdays is part of the reason. Fuuuuuucck.
>> ARTICLE
Is it covered in the manga whether Satoru downplays his intelligence when he is in lessons? I imagine the tests etc are super easy for his 29 year old self to answer but does he give any thought to his sudden spike in grades? 
>> ARTICLE
I was fucking waiting for this episode, as I read the manga, as I knew it would make everyone happy, and then immediately put a pit in everyone's stomachs.
>> ARTICLE
I hope he ran to her house the next episode......
>> ARTICLE
I was so scared when Hiiromi went home by himself like FUCK I thought they'd switch up the murder order and he'd get axed first
>> ARTICLE
I suspect that Hinazuki's first death awakened Satoru's time leaping ability. I also think he might have lost his memory of what he did back then because he failed to save her dozens, if not hundreds or thousands of times before finding the solution that allowed his timeline to continue until he reached the age of 29. 

Now he's repeating all the same actions that he did as a child since he can't remember what he did. I'm really looking forward to the next episode(s) to see if Satoru's going full Steins;Gate again to fix the issue plus regain some more memories. 

Finally, that teacher creeps me out. He's also one of the few who are aware of Hinazuki's situation and knew about the birthday party too. That puts him high on my suspect list.
>> ARTICLE
I like how the show makes it clear to Satoru in the most cruel way possible that his mindset going into this has been flawed from the start. I see some character development from him coming our way in the future, otherwise the universe will chew him up and spit him out.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was great, as expected. 

Putting aside what happened to Kayo, Fujinuma addresses these dj vu.. Another user pointed out that he could be going to overwrite his own memories, and this side of the story is becoming intriguing. I mean, there's even the chance he has already lived this altered version of the story and can't remember it.. It might explain his dj vu

>> ARTICLE
Showerthought time:
Could the girl in the beginning be something like Kayos reincarnation? They act relatively similar and seem to evoke the same emotions in Satoru, and the ages line up perfectly if she "respawned" shortly after dying.
>> ARTICLE
NOOOOOOOOOOO THE FATED CLIFFHANGER ARRIVED! 
>> ARTICLE
My prediction is that in the end he'll change how things happened but he wont be able to change the end result; the "Revival" probably needs to happen BEFORE the death occurs; if he just forces it to happen AFTER, he probably cant change it. I really hope I'm wrong though, it's just an out of the blue prediction.
>> ARTICLE
Aw fuck, I can't believe you've done this. 
>> ARTICLE
Urgh this part in manga also made me anxious. Also I'm probably the only person who don't ship Satoru and Hinazuki but I still think that their relationship is amazing. Also fuck Hinazuki's mom seriously. To think that Satoru's mom is also somehow in same boat as Hinazuki's mom though. Both are single mothers, even their children shared same birthday date. But the outcome of their situation in parenting... made me cringe so bad. 
>> ARTICLE
I have no idea why I keep thinking of Satoru as a genderbended Homura.
>> ARTICLE
What a fucking episode. There were moments where I was on alert and expected something terrible to happen due to so much happiness. I was really excited when Hinazuki got home fine, but the next day... Man, I expected something bad to happen, but come on
>> ARTICLE
It's like the show is saying,"Hey you like happy shit? FUCK YOU! YOU DON'T GET TO KEEP THAT HAPPINESS. HERE'S A SENSE OF SADNESS FOR ANOTHER WEEK!"
>> ARTICLE
This show is such a rollercoaster, FUCK.

At first I felt fuzzy, then happy, then this slight uneasiness when Satoru was going back home, then the DREAD. 

So ep 3 closing scene was Kenya setting up sensei to give them after school duty?

Pretty idiotic mistake fro a 29 year old to think just because he made it past X day everything would be ok... Like the killer would care for one day or two...

Goddamn it. 99% of this episode is super warm and fuzzy. Then the very last 10s...goddamn....fuck

Bruh, this episode was great. The happy feels! <3 But I was on guard the whole entire time. It was way too good for them, expecting something bad would happen during the episode. Good thing nothing happened until the actual end of it which was still bad. Argh. >< Oh well, I can't wait for the next ep.

Who do you all think is the murderer?

I haven't read the manga, but I suspected the teacher from the very beginning. Who's with me?

On an unrelated note, I find it interesting that Japanese teachers mark incorrect answers with a check and circle correct answers. 

I may or may not be latching on a random scene from the episode just to avoid thinking about that cliffhanger.

I don't deserve this xD it's too good

I fucking love the stupid face he makes when he gets embarrassed
>> ARTICLE
I think I've been ruined by anime as we as fans rarely get a good ending or even a pay off of something good most of the time. I just kept thinking when watching "when is something to go happen to her?" or "Maybe he is kidnapped instead" 

I'm glad the suspicious ending from episode 3 was nothing and just something to keep you interested and nothing more right? ... RIGHT?

Can't wait for episode 5!!
>> ARTICLE
KAYO BABY NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
I mean I fucking knew something was going to happen at the very end but swiss fucking cheese does it still hurt.
  
Ahem, aside from that, why is Satoru so precious? Kayo too, why are they so adorable and sweet? Every time Kayo appears on screen I just want to hug her and probably adopt her too. Satoru's personality, expressions and voice are making him one of my favorite characters of all time.  
  
Why do I ship them so bad? I feel like a bad person haha.

ah, fuck. This is a good show.

I like how they established why his mother is so observant explaining some of her scenes in the first episode.

I'm just going to hibernate until the next episode airs. Good night guys! Damn every episode is 10/10.

Just watched it. I hope they focused more on the fact that he's a adult within a child more. I'd be cool to have scenes where would would find weird his behavior or intellect. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe I'm just naive, but I'm convinced now that the teacher's a good guy. However, I found it strange that the thief girl mentioned how the teacher just accepts the girls flirting with him. I wonder if that's relevant, maybe he has inappropriate relationships with some of his female students?  
>> ARTICLE
They live in some odd homes. Is that a kind of lower-income area or something? Never seen it before in anime.

So ERASED sets the bar high for 2016. How will the succeeding seasons answer this challenge? Are we in for more great shows or we already go downhill from here?
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I've felt the same way about any anime than I feel about this one. I find it so hard to drive myself to watch each episode, but once it's on the screen my heart races and all I can feel is the pounding of my chest as each minute goes by. I notice it while I'm watching and it's like I'm on the edge of my seat about to have a heart attack each time. With the cinematic way the show is presented - that air of nostalgia and the investment in both the characters and their actions, I can't help but actually feel something different about this one. Like, I'm almost scared to watch each episode but once I start I really can't look away.

**It's 100% my anime of this season.**

On a side note, does anyone get a distinct Anohana feel from the OP? Like, there's something about the portrayal of the past and that music that makes me ping some similarities (although I know the subjects are ultimately different).
>> ARTICLE
I really wanted to feel happy as everything was going great, but I couldnt help but feel an overwhelming tension as I was waiting for what I knew would inevitably unfold. All that being said, I'm sure now, that this is my favorite anime this season (very probably). 
>> ARTICLE
Seems I caved in and binge read the manga all the way to the latest chapter(no more cliffhangers for me sadly, but the theories I keep reading are certainly a lot of fun xD) .  Hope the anime follows the great quality of the manga that its currently going right now  :)
Definitely hoping for best anime of 2016.
>> ARTICLE
That Cliffhanger, but it would be funny if it turns out she just had a cold. I was actually close to the edge of my seat, the story is so good that my overly critical side is not so bad, for this anime anyway. Also it's a really cute romance, I really wasn't expecting that. I thought that killer was going to get someone else because Hinazuki was saved, but maybe the future refused to change.
>> ARTICLE
Alright boys, bets on whose the murderer?

Im putting 10 on the teacher, he seemed very weird in one of the last episodes, and considering he knows a lot about her personal life i.e abuse and that she was a loner in the previous time line that she would probably be an easy target. 
>> ARTICLE
this episode made me feel waay to giddy/happy that i knew something was up and i was able brace myself for the end haha. 

This anime is soooo good, its so cute and has top notch quality!

I hope it doesn't start killing off characters like game of thrones :(
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't help but feel that Satoru was being a bit too naive by thinking that if Hinazuki survived past her original kill date that it would change things. Only delays the inevitable. It might've just made things worse since the two were hanging out so much that they might suspect him (like his mother's death in the present time). Looks like he's due for a time leap back and I hope he makes better use of his time by trying to figure out who the killer is.
>> ARTICLE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PbLSSXEjCY

Just realized this, but I don't think Hinazuki is dead. If Hinazuki was dead, he would have been sent back to the first day, assuming saving her was necessary to save his mom. At the very least, she's abducted but alive. 

Also interested to see where things go with Satoru's deja-vu. 
>> ARTICLE
Even after reading the manga, I still enjoy this a lot and look forward to it every week. 


>> ARTICLE
It's pretty creepy how the killer is actively haunting Satoru both in past and present. 

Aside from that, I was rather nostalgic of the 2006 timeline so it's great to see Airi again
>> ARTICLE
> I was rather nostalgic of the 2006 timeline so it's great to see Airi again

Based on the OP, I was pretty hopeful that we were going to see Airi sooner rather than later. Didn't expect her to be such a badass though.

This series has a fantastic line-up of strong female leads 
>> ARTICLE
yeah but they are hitting 0-3 in the living category so far

Yo, no way Airi's dead. You think they'd end on that cliffhanger and then have her be dead next episode?

Yeah and then her death will send him back again to fix it.
>> ARTICLE
> It isn't that I "can," I want to believe in you.

God my heart, she is amazing. Fuck the ending of this episode.
>> ARTICLE
They did it again...

I felt bad for Satoru's mom after one episode of screentime, and now I felt twice as bad for Airi who had roughly the same screen time.

Every time she said "Baka nano?", my heart twisted inside.
>> ARTICLE
The first time she said it, spotlight on MC, I was sooo confused. This anime is so good, I really hope is MC goes back all the way again and saves everyone.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if the killer has the same ability as Satoru and is able to jump back and forward in time? What if Hinazuki is supposed to be killed for the greater good of some sort?? I'm so nervous
>> ARTICLE
I don't remember where I heard it, but there was this theory that the killer is an AU Satoru who's doing all this. 

I'm pretty sure that's not the right answer, but it was an entertaining concept 
>> ARTICLE
>killer is an AU Satoru

That thought occurred to me today when I was watching OP and there was this moment when [the image shifted from Satoru to the murderer](https://youtu.be/jNPCLOzK48Q?t=53s).
>> ARTICLE
Also later in the OP when he gets shot through the head and topples off the roof..

[the murderer](http://i.imgur.com/WcI4PZY.jpg)

I'm placing dibs on the ex-colleague of Mom. He has a suit as well and has drawn the least attention.
>> ARTICLE
Somehow I also stoped there for a moment today. 

I also dont belive that this theory will actually come true,.. but it might not be *too* far fetched.
>> ARTICLE
My theory is that those kids are all messed up and some other Satoru (or maybe other people with the same ability) decided that to fix all of the problems in the future it's best to just eliminate the root of it all (which is a pretty messed up idea itself) I mean all this time Satoru referred to his REVIVAL ability as some sort of a 'gift'. He even said that 'as if someone wants me to fix all this mayhem"
>> ARTICLE
>It's pretty creepy how the killer is actively haunting Satoru both in past and present. 


This makes for an interesting discussion about the nature of this criminal. Why does this person have a number on Satoru? It's killing me having to wait a week for this answer.
>> ARTICLE
Makes you wonder if this criminal has actual ties with  Satoru some way. Whether knowing about him in school or through police work.

It if is that Mr Nishizono that the pizza manager was talking to, that means the criminal is actually in the police/investigative force or he is pretending to be one. [A look at his investigator badge.](http://m.imgur.com/PbabOci)
>> ARTICLE
It seems like the manager personally knew that dude, plus that pin he had on has some importance 
>> ARTICLE
I think the pin is an indicator that this person has some political power. Perhaps Japanese National Diet? They seem to wear pins similar to the one we've seen in anime so far. http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/index.nsf/html/images/kangeikai130607-1.jpg/$File/kangeikai130607-1.jpg
>> ARTICLE
[Maybe this?](http://i.imgur.com/cN6884m.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I suspected it was probably cause he's afraid the mom already informed him who it could be. His whole MO is child abduction and such, so this is going out of the way
>> ARTICLE
But that wouldn't explain why he is going after Airi. Why would he go after her too? She doesn't even know anything about Satoru's past other than he was connected to that series of kidnappings. 
>> ARTICLE
Think carefully about this episode, it was mentioned that a serial abduction is nothing new. It was also said that each time a culprit was caught, he claimed to be innocent. The murderer is trying to frame Satoru so that the crime can be solved and nobody would be looking for the real killer. The same happened with Kayo, her mother beat her to death (as we saw in the episode) and "someone" helped her shift the blame by kidnapping a bunch of other girls. Remember how the police car stopped hanging outside Kayos mother house after second kidnapping? Don't think it's Kayos mother boyfriend either, as he would be under surveillance as well. We are looking for identity of a third party, perhaps even someone we already know.
>> ARTICLE
that suit guy who didnt show his face , a third party that is so good , cant be anybody else
>> ARTICLE
Judging by his voice I'm sure that was the teacher
>> ARTICLE
Right? It makes sense that he'd be able to kidnap elementary school girls considering how much the girls in Satoru's class liked him. But I wouldn't be surprised if it's just a red herring. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been guessing it was him since we saw half of his face when he killed the mom, and when he thought Satoru was getting to smart and figured out that abuse was going on 
>> ARTICLE
Skip between 4:57 and 14:49 it is definitely the teacher the voices have the exact same sound except a slight bit deeper definitely the same VA putting on a lower voice. Obviously the guy in the suit is the killer since they are hiding his face. It all makes sense, that's why only his mother recognized whoever it was in the parking lot outside the shopping center. She saw it was the teacher they locked eyes and he stopped trying to abduct the kid because she knew what he was doing. The MC would of forgotten his face because of how young he was but the mother remembered and was piecing it together before she died. 



Also the teacher in the present time was being super creepy when pizza girl came into their meeting, especially when he's staring at her outside just before he gets into his car it's as if he's considering following her to kill her because he can tell she's helping mc. He's most likely the area manager for the pizza franchise and has been keeping an eye on MC for this entire time that's why he's so close to the stores manager even though the guy seems like an unbearable schmuck who would be the last person an old guy would befriend. It explains how he was able to find MCs house to kill his mom he could of looked into the company database and found all his information. He would of known that the mother was staying with the MC because he's never seen him with her before than, probably pieced it together that she was visiting.



I'm getting worried for MC, especially if he goes back in time again like he hints at, at the end of the episode. Pizza girl probably ends up being killed in the fire and that triggers MC going back in time again to the 80s so he can stop her death as well since it is all connected together by the same killer. Like you mentioned, in his previous retries he was acting really weird around the teacher and the guy probably already suspects something is up with him given that suddenly he's interested in befriending a girl he's never been interested in who so happens to be one of the girls that he's probably been stalking for a while leading up to the murder. The other kids in the class don't see anything different about MC but kenya notices it straight away that he is behaving differently. If kenya is able to see it (and he seems to be the only kid in class who is actually smart) then the teacher obviously sees that MC seems to be a different person. If MC continues trying to help and stop the murders from happening there will have to eventually be some sort of confrontation with the teacher he might even be targeted as a victim. 



Back to the current episode I don't think that Hinazukis mother killed her, otherwise why would the show bother mentioning all the serial killings happening in other towns beforehand and that all the "suspects" pleaded innocent. Since the teacher is murderer it doesn't make sense for more serial killings to take place after an initial murder that the serial killer didn't commit. If he were in town and a little girl was murdered, why would he then kill more if he didn't commit the initial murder? There would be too much heat and he would lay low until it blew over because he had no connection to the crime. 



It's also clear that at some point in the night hanazuki was in the shed since the door was open. The parents must of beaten her badly because she was out with her friends all night without permission and left her in the shed for the entire night. Since the teacher knows that Hinazuki is beaten regularly on the weekend (I can't remember if mc told him that the mother leaves her in the shed), but if he knew that he could of easily snuck behind the house and abducted her. Even if he didn't know that he could of been watching over the house and seen her tossed in the shed. That would explain why the shoe prints don't seem to come from the house, they were the teachers shoes. 



Also explains why the parents are worried, it was snowing really badly that night (that's why we only see one set of foot prints the killers not the parents) must of been really cold, the parents were worried that they left her out to freeze and she disappeared in the morning. In their minds they think that hanazuki woke up in the shed after the beating they gave her and left to try to find a proper warm shelter only to die in the cold somewhere in the town. They fear that they will be blamed for her freezing to death. 
>> ARTICLE
>  her mother beat her to death (as we saw in the episode) and "someone" helped her shift the blame by kidnapping a bunch of other girls.

Did that really happen though? It might be a red herring. Think about it, would a true mistery story be solved that easily? and by giving the viewer and NOT the main character the answer of who the killer is? I think not. Obviously i'm not gonna base my oppinion on my preconceptions of what make a mistery story what it is. 

Having said that i'll state my thoughts: Kayo was probably murdered the night of the day before being abscent from school. The murderer was already waiting for her inside, ready to do his thing. In episode 4 we can infere that her parents weren't at home when satoru and kayo made the promise, because the lights of her house weren't turned on. 

Now, why did they show us that shot of kayo's mom and her ... husband/affair (not sure what he is) worrying about what to do? I believe that they found her on the morning when they finally arrived home and thought they would be framed for murder. They probably tried their best to hide the murder so that they couldn't be framed about it, and to not bother about explaining the situation to the police.

And now some evidence to backup my theory: The footprints that satoru found at kayo's home, why would they be there? they most likely weren't from kayo's "dad" (whatever he is) since he wasn't home on the night of the murder. The footprints were also pointing away from the backdoor, presumably because that's the route the true killer used to escape. If we assume that kayo was accidentally murdered by her mother, there wouldn't be any point to showing us the footprints. 

Sorry about the wall of text, i got a little bit too excited. Btw i think the murderer is the teacher, for some reasons that i could explain if someone wanted me to.

Would be pretty obvious if you just drop a body in a trash bag at the front of your house, but I can't deny that was my line of ideas too.

There were multiple bags, I was thinking along the lines of the mother was cutting up the body and disposing of it in small potions one by one.

That was my interpretation, especially with the mother's evil smile and Satoru's reaction.

Yeah there was definitely some intense scenes in Perfect Insider, it had some promise. I marathoned it at the end so I probably didn't have as bad of an experience as you.


>> ARTICLE
Seriously that paper's been following him around from the beginning. 

And remember when he read Kayo's poem in the book, then went to sleep and was all like 'Oh yeah I wonder what I wrote in that?' and then fell asleep and never checked. 

Also (probably unrelated but still on my mind), in episode 1 when he was in the hospital, Airi pointed out that he and the truck driver were the only casualties involved, and Satoru questioned the wording but they never went back to it. I mean I know casualty means injured too, but the way he thought about the word makes me wonder if there's more to it (Also I don't know if the Japanese equivalent means 100% the same as our casualty)

These are the 3 unexplained things I've noticed so far. 
>> ARTICLE
>I don't know if the Japanese equivalent means 100% the same as our casualty

If you don't want to read all this, just skip to the conclusion.

The word used in that scene was . I'm honestly not good enough with Japanese to be sure about the different nuances between them, but based on the [two](http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/jn/261052/meaning/m0u/%E6%AD%BB%E5%82%B7%E8%80%85/) dictionary [entries](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/casualty) I checked, they seem to both have the meaning of "a person injured or killed". 

There are various small differences between the two words, but I'd say the most relevant difference in this case is their usage and general impression. Due to it's usage in war-related topics, and war's tendency to kill rather than injure, "casualty" has a more common usage when related to death, and lesser so injury.  has a much less common use in war-related topics, and is used much more often in small accidents than "casualty" is. It includes the ideas of both death and injury much more equally than "casualty" does.

I believe many native English speakers might think "casualty" only refers to death, but I don't think many native Japanese speakers would think the same of .

I think the clearest example of what I'm talking about is that [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties) article uses the word "casualties", but [the Japanese version](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E6%AC%A1%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E5%A4%A7%E6%88%A6%E3%81%AE%E7%8A%A0%E7%89%B2%E8%80%85) **does not** use , instead using the word . The Japanese word  can't quite be used in the context of counting how many people died in WW2, but the English word "casualty" fits just right.

Conclusion: "casualty" has a noticeably stronger idea of death, and lesser so injury.  seems to refer to someone who died and someone who got injured equally.  didn't seem very out of place in that scene, and I'm not sure why the main character pondered over it. The only idea I can come up with is that he's shocked from the event, and his mind got hung up on that word. Not sure if that was of any help whatsoever really.
>> ARTICLE
Two things

1) Just noticed a lot of hints the OP has  been dropping

2) The "police officer" that met with the manager looked eerily similar to the man that walked out of Satoru's house after killing the mother back in episode 1. Similar glasses, similar jaw, and was obviously checking out pizza girl.

>> ARTICLE
It would make sense if the _killer_ was associated with the police as all of the abductions have been pinned on easy suspects who deny ever being involved.

From what we know of Yuuki, he was the easiest person to pin the abductions due to his behaviors. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really curious about what happend to Yuuki now. With the changed time frame for kayo's abduction, should that not remove him as a suspect? The first time she disappeared when alone in the park but this time it happened sometime between that she got home from the night before and before she got to school the next day. But really, the mom is totally behind it this time.
>> ARTICLE
I am watched OP like five times in a row after watching it. i can't help but wonder what Kenya's bigger part in the story is?

edit: I think he is in the ED too. HM.
>> ARTICLE
The fact they never show his face is just a cause for alarm from a literary standpoint
>> ARTICLE
well it could also be a red herring. Not showing the face just makes it really mysterious, and it makes you question all the suspects.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure it's him, to be honest. [This](http://imgur.com/9oYTzYP) is the presumed killer, as shown in the opening. And [this](http://imgur.com/6lLU2Q0) is suspicous-san. Hair looks very similar, at least to me, plus both have glasses.

>> ARTICLE
I don't understand why everyone hates the manager. You're telling me if an employee of yours looks to have certainly murdered his mother you wouldn't help the police catch him? Satoru was caught with her blood on his hand and he ran away, from the outside world's perspective there would be virtually no doubt that he did it.
>> ARTICLE
I don't blame the manager for calling the police and trying to aid there search. The only thing that irritated me was his attitude towards Airi and the fact that he lied to her.

She might have over-reacted but she definitely had reason to be upset because of his lying.

Different sides is all it is as far as the lying goes IMO. His attitude towards her is the only thing I don't like about him lol

I liked how they didn't make it into the big reveal this episode. Most anime would start amping the music and show us the dead body which is creepy but gets old fast if you've seen it before.

They just imply it, which makes the idea all the more surprising and scary. Kudos to the director for the way they're making these scenes!

I'm really liking how the director approaches this like a film/movie rather than your typical 1 cour show with a limited budget; the scene where Satoru sees the mittens and runs away had this [split second scene of some crows picking at the garbage bag](http://i.imgur.com/XYVd4B7.png) and while it was totally unnecessary, I really felt it added a lot to the ominous feel of everything. 
>> ARTICLE
i believe this scene is also drawn in manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Even if that's true (I'm not reading the manga so I cannot confirm), I'd say that it doesn't take credit away from the anime: when a scene is drawn in a manga, you watch and read it at the same speed as you watch and read all other ones, or sometimes go slower when a scene is particularly interesting. In an anime, the producers are in control of the pacing, and they made that scene last just barely enough for you to understand what is going on in it, and that greatly amplifies the feeling of fear and disgust.

In a world where anime adaptations are considered the necessarily inferior versions of the original stories because of the shortcomings of anime as a medium, sometimes we need an adaptation that makes use of anime's advantages like this one.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah as soon as I saw the painting I knew what was up. 

Well done by them, but also interesting since it is a very western thing and not really Japanese. I wonder why they didn't go for a Japanese equivalent.
>> ARTICLE
well considering the japanese had a past of christians 'invading' into japan and the emperor closing off his borders as a result in order to prevent the spread of christianity as he feared for uprisings from the peasants, yeah.. japan is no stranger to western religion.

Appearances and pride. Basically it made the small town spread rumors, and distrust on him. So all his friends and neighbors think he is a thief 

I can see how that can ruin him , especially in Japan where appearances matter so much, even if it was just a candy. In the western urban world, no one is going to distrust you that much for a little shoplifting. You'd have to go to be falsely accused of something much worse for probably the same impact

I like the similarity between Kaya and Airi, and frequently asking Satoru is stupid.  I wonder if Satoru asked Airi to stop because of the normal reason, or because it was something that reminded him of Kaya.

Could she be an incarnation of her? Like isn't the protagonist around 28 years old, while kayo died when she was 10-11 and airi is 17 now

Hopefully not. That would mean Airi wouldn't be the same in a timeline Kayo was saved, and that's not what we want, is it?

 I have a strange feeling about how Airi is usually asking Satoru if he's stupid.

I don't know man.

Hinazuki's mom just makes me sick.. Standing over her daughters body like that and throwing away her things with that evil grin. I hate her. 

Airi's punch was pretty awesome. It was pretty obvious that she would be the one to  believe he didn't do it after all she had dinner with the two. The manager is a dick and I bet the guy he was talking to is the killer. They didn't show his face but his hair reminded me of the guy Satoru passed in the staircase after the murder.

What I'm getting from him being back in the present is for him to get a better idea of who the murder is and how to stop him. With a better grasp of the killer, he can go back in time and have a better chance at saving Hinazuki.

Btw, there's a trailer for the live action floating around on the internet, and it's quite spoily, so be careful.

Was she not kiddnapped ? And simply killed by her parents. And just a coincidence that it happened during the serial kidnapping. 

Or did the killer just kill her there, and the parents had no idea what to do since they would be blamed 
>> ARTICLE
This is what I think happened they beat her and put her in that room outside and the killer got to her. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. That is what I  thought too.

This[ scene basically confirms it.](http://m.imgur.com/vG7eqwU)

It is possible that it was the man her mother is with, but that wouldn't  make sense as to how Kayo is found dead later.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, [the scene right after Satoru opens the shed shows Hinazuki's battered body](http://i.imgur.com/Z4cBpsJ.png) in the same room as her mom and boyfriend, so I think it's safe to assume that they accidentally beat her to death the night before. It could be that Hinazuki in the new timeline wasn't actually a victim of the serial killer but the police just assumed she was and her mum managed to get away with it.
>> ARTICLE
There appear to be two options here: 

     1.) The parents beat her to death, presumably by accident,    and now don't know what to do.

or

     2.) When Hinazuki was alone that night, the killer came into the house, beat her to death, and left her dead body there    (which wouldn't make sense if you're trying to kill someone   without leaving proof)

I'm leaning towards the former option.  
>> ARTICLE
I agree with the first option as well. Makes sense also that when she was throwing out Kayo's stuff, she had a devil-ish smile, like she got away with something.
>> ARTICLE
I really love the attention to detail in this show. In Airi's room, we see a shot of her bookshelf [filled with books on famous artists](http://imgur.com/xFmWPWZ). Airi is clearly a big art nerd, whether or not this is relevant we have yet to see, but I thought it was a sweet detail that subtly gives her character more depth.

I feel like they avoid showing his face to avoid showing his eyes. I also feel like the pin on his suit has to hold some sort of relevance but I can't place it yet.
>> ARTICLE
> The killer is involved with the police or something

I was thinking that exact same thing. If the current situation has anything to do with the kidnappings from back in 1988, then it would make sense to think there was some police corruption involved there too.
>> ARTICLE
Also the fact that the abductions seem to be pinned on extremely _easy_ targets that have no way of proving their own innocence hints at the fact that the _killer_ might have been involved with the police in some way.
>> ARTICLE
Tried to do some digging, did not have much success (not surprising, considering how good at it I am). Nevertheless, some observations:  
  
- Nishizono-san featured talking to the manager is wearing a peculiar... button? on his suit. I don't know much about flowers and stuff but it looks similar to [imperial seal of Japan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Imperial_Seal_of_Japan.svg/2000px-Imperial_Seal_of_Japan.svg.png). The seal, however, features 14 petals in a very orderly fashion, while  his button has 7 in a haphazard order.  
  
- He is also possibly a regular in the City Council and apparently has enough influence to make corrections into road/traffic plans for his own benefit.  
  
And about the killer in general:  
- In the first timeline, children's abductions and deaths charges were dropped on Yuuki (Jun Shiratori) - curiously, he's involved in food delivery service... So does Nishizono-san (or his friends at least).  
  
- The guy who tried to abduct a girl in the first episode had mustache, possibly from not shaving for some time. The guy who kills Satoru's mom clearly has none: either he uses Gillette or it is another man.  
  
- Satoru's mom knew the murderer, and remembers him well enough to find his description in one of the old newspapers.  
  
- Murderer knew mom too. And well enough to stop amid abduction, to find that she stays with her son (despite doing so for a couple of days), and to kill her the very same day. Either the murderer was a prominent official, an important figure in investigation, or a personal acquaintance.  
  
Also, I am not that good at English, so I have no idea what mom's phrase about "18 years since statute expired" means, so I am probably missing something. I feel like this was a bit too much investigation, considering the murderer is pretty obvious and will be revealed soon, but whatever. Was fun, at least.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the person the manager was talking to was the mayor?

18 years since statute expired is the 'statute of limitations'; as a society we have agreed that a person cannot be trialed for a crime, except for extreme circumstances, that happened X number of years ago - in this case 18 - because we feel the evidence and/or eyewitness testimony is too far gone to be trusted

From someone who read it prior, I recommend you stay strong and try anime only, read the manga after if you want. The adaptation is great and presents the story excellently so far

I will second this as someone who read every english chapter out after last episode(there are like 8 or so untranslated chapters with I think only 2 more to be released until the end). Not only because the anime is such a great adaptation, but because the wait for answers is worse. I think people are generally better off with the week wait than a month wait.

A chocolate bar that lost him his job and status in their small town. 
>> ARTICLE
Key word here is "small town". I'm originally from India and the people of small towns there put up a big "honorable" face. Even a single small blemish on that "honor" could lead to massive outrages from the ENTIRE town since many people know each other. So it's easy to understand that even though this was just a chocolate bar, the stigma of theft will never ever actually leave Airi's dad in the eyes of the townspeople. It's even worse for him since he's had such a prestigious job. 
>> ARTICLE
So, I neglected to mention this before, but if you watch the OP, it shows you the three women in Satoru's life (Hinazuki, his mom, pizza girl) all in blue, and then switches colors to red, and replaces Satoru's face with the killer.

It's also worth mentioning that this show had coded the color red to mean death, and that the other two women have already been killed by the killer.

Airi was also pretty young when it happened, so she might not have been fully aware of the state of the marriage before hand. Maybe.
>> ARTICLE
Less the candy bar and more the losing his job and ruined reputation.

As a divorced guy I can confirm that divorces can stem from some dumb shit.

Judging by how Airi repeats things Kayo says quite often she has to be connected to her somehow, right?
>> ARTICLE
She's probably just a foil for Kayo. It also gives the viewer the feeling of "Maybe this is how Kayo would have behaved if she became a teenager too." :(

Holy shit did Satoru's VA nail the scream of anguish after seeing the mittens.

In addition to his VA, I really feel like his facial expressions are on point in terms of conveying his emotions. They just hit so hard.

Yuki Kajiura is just amazing at what she does. Throughout the show, and in this episode when Satoru finds the gloves and Airi is attacked, the music just makes the moment so much better.

Yooo, this is messed up.  The OP should've hinted it but I didn't expect him to jump back to 2006.  Interesting seeing things develop on this side, although it means we have to face the fact that Sachiko is dead again...with possibly Airi to join her now.

I noticed in the pizza shop it looks like [Airi's been crying.](http://imgur.com/OLTGoRK)  It's a lot for her to take in, I'm actually surprised Satoru hasn't broken down yet but then he has the belief he can fix this protecting him.

It looks like Kato's mom's boyfriend went too far one night (or maybe she did).  Really pisses me off, why does no one else seem to know about him?

Aiding a suspect in a criminal case is NOT the smartest thing in the world. Also whoever was talking to the manager gave me the creeps. 

This series gets worse and worse situation wise which makes it get better and better entertainment wise! Can't wait until next week!

EDIT: [Possible Spoiler if it turns out to be true](/s "Also, Kayo's parents definitely killed her but everything afterwards makes no sense. The other girls going missing, why would they abduct and murder other girls just to take the heat off? It is a giant contradiction to the facts in my eyes")
>> ARTICLE
Man I Think it's the teacher who was talking to him, he'd be around that age right? Creepy dude to me even back then.
>> ARTICLE
I think that Kayo was an unfortunate case where the serial killer wasn't the one who killed her but her parents did. Her death was linked to every other death and no one ever found out about what Kayo's parents did. They gave credit to her death to the serial killer instead of the true culprits.
>> ARTICLE
Yup, "A forest(series of murders) is the best place to hide a tree(murder)".

Jesus Fucking Christ, give me a break, Erased!

First you murder Sachiko, the best mom 2016, then you *maybe* murder Kayo again, then you [remind me that you've murdered Sachiko](http://i.imgur.com/TQxolWa.jpg), the best mom 2016, and then you want to [murder Airi](http://i.imgur.com/tmjxt53.jpg)?!! STOP! 

For the love of god, what an episode... Once again, Erased shows just how good it is at characterizing its cast in a very short amount of time. Airi is immediately [awesome](http://i.imgur.com/WIkUKo0.jpg) and she just [doesn't give a fuck](http://i.imgur.com/oTjwGps.jpg)! 

But I have so many questions now. Like, Kayo was murdered, but this time the time of death has changed. But what about the murderer? [What if this time it was Kayo's mom](http://i.imgur.com/ZkMKju9.png), while in the past it was a serial killer? Or was it mom both times?! What about [that guy](http://i.imgur.com/oQm6G8S.jpg) who talked to the manager? I'm pretty sure that he's the same guy that murdered Sachiko, considering his profile and glasses. ARGH!

If erased's popularity is symbolic of anything its that anime fans definitely have a desire for a good seinen anime. An anime that reflects this in its plot line and story without resorting to massive tropes and fan service. I don't think this show would be as popular as it is without the proper tone and good characters absent of tropes and cliches that generally lean on fan service.

I've learned one thing from this episode: Don't say "Baka Nano?" to Satoru or else you will die.

Interesting to note, in the opening there's a short cut to this scene of I can only assume to be [Airi](http://imgur.com/Jia2nEY)

As you can see, she's wearing a bright jacket, a black tank top, and, the most interesting bit, there's a bandage wrapped around her left arm. This might imply she survives the fire, and I'm hoping that is the case, but I'm not too sure.

Finding it pretty hard not to cave and read the manga at this point. This anime is doing some weird things to me. I've never yearned for episodes this much with an airing anime before, or at least it feels like it's been a VERY long time since.

Oh god. Someone please tell me I'm not going insane. 

Has anyone else noticed these [strange threads](http://imgur.com/a/QEk45) attached to certain characters' heads? I thought maybe it was a production mistake, but I've noticed twice now, and there's a slight shine as the character moves. I discovered the first one in episode 2, [while Satoru's mother was making a phone call outside the market](http://i.imgur.com/JVTHFVv.png). I haven't had time to review ep3-4 yet, but I noticed another thread while [Airi was walking home from the pizza shop](http://i.imgur.com/sIOI5hZ.png).

I feel like when Satoru discovers that Airi is dead he's going to have another revival back to 1988.

First time the teacher showed up, I got those same creepy vibes from him, but the show keeps pointing elsewhere, mostly to Hinazuki's family who gives off a feeling that it would be no small step to commit murder.

Partially because of that I keep coming back to the teacher, her family is too obvious. 

Its so hard not to read the manga to find out!
>> ARTICLE
I really don't get why everyone is hating the manager; your not supposed to.  Satoru himself said that he was only 'trying to do the right thing', as far as the manager is concerned, Satoru did it.  That's why he's trying to turn him in; because he genuinely believes that Satoru is guilty.  What do you guys think the author intention is here, it's totally obvious!  He's supposed to represent all the well meaning but gullible citizens who the killer has fooled into thinking that the framed person is the real suspect.  Your supposed to hate the killer, not his victims.

The only thing I can see is that people are salty that he likes Airi, like some weird, ass-backwards NTR kind of thing.  It's clear that the killer is using that fact to manipulate him into wanting to protect her from the criminal.  Again, to show how brilliant the killer is (to be able to manipulate people so well) not to make indictments on the character of his victims.  The potential list of victims are just as long as the suspects, remember.  Everyone who is a suspect but is not the killer is a victim.  Reluctant as I am to say it, that includes Kayo's parents, unless they are somehow inexplicably the serial killers (not that anyone actually thinks that, right?).  Yes, they're abusive fucks, but until proven guilty, they aren't necessarily murder's

I say wait for more evidence before making the broad sweeping assumptions.  As of now, we don't know what Kayo's mom's smile means.  Maybe it means she killed Kayo, and is happy that there's coincidentally a serial killer around to help her cover her own tracks.  OR that wasn't actually a smile of joy, and more one of pain, as she throws out her dead daughter's clothes and is a prime suspect in her murder.  One of the biggest logical mistakes I've seen people on this sub making is that Kayo's mom doesn't love her, which, to be fair, if you didn't have abusive parents or know people who did, is easy to assume.  Unfortunately, this is just flat out false, as long as this series is following real world models of abuse (as it has been doing to a T so far, so no reason to assume otherwise).  Remember, people who abuse were abused themselves, and despite our flawed belief that humans are rational actors who are fully in charge of their own actions and decision making, we are actually creatures of habit.  It's just plain statistics that abused people will grow up to abuse their own kids; and if that's what the author is going for, there is no reason to arbitrarily believe that Kayo's
Mom didn't love her.  Contrary to popular belief, it is fully possible for a human being to beat the shit out of someone they love, as a consequence of their personal life experiences.  It's sick, and I wish it wasn't so, but if Kayo's mom is the textbook abusive mother she's been portrayed as being so far, she's likely devastated about her daughter's death.  AKA, until we see more, we have NO IDEA what that smile means, and it's useless to draw conclusions about it based on our emotional response to a character we aren't supposed to like.  Same goes for the manager; just because Airi punched him doesn't mean he's a bad guy, the author does not want you to hate his character, just his actions.  Unless they are the killer, all suspects should be regarded as victims.  Yuuki spent a creepy amount of time with elementary school kids and has a big porn collection, which may or may not include the book Lolita.  But unless he's the killer, he is a victim, and should not be on death row.  The manager was trying to rat out Satoru and has a crush on his teenage coworker, but unless he is the killer, he does not deserve to be as hated as he is, because he genuinely believes he's doing the right thing.  Kayo's mom may be an abusive fuck, but if she's been abused herself, and is not the killer, she...well she should probably still get jailtime and does not really deserve your pity, but we still know fuck all about that smile, so stop drawing meaningless conclusions about it.  Remember, at the end of the day, the true villain is the killer, that's who the author wants you to focus on.  Getting caught up in all the adults he uses to hide himself is playing right into his hands, something the cops did and why he remains free.  Yes, Yuuki is creepy, yes Kayo's mom is a bitch, and yes the manager is kind of a dick, but keep your eyes on the prize.  They're very likely to not be the killers, so don't fall into the trap of making them the villains and ignoring the pedophilic fuckface that abducts broken little girls, does God knows what to them, and then kills them and frames innocent people for it

I can't believe I have to wait another week. Fuck.

I think that the little pin on the guy who doesn't show his face is a lead to who he might be. While talking to the manager they focused him and his hand motions only to show the pin on the suit when hes done talking. 
>> ARTICLE
Really enjoyed being back in the present... 2006 this episode. Was looking forward to Airi's return and she definitely delivered.... she better be fucking fine.

Anyways, lots of people seem to be hating on the manager this episode, but can you really blame the man? Every action he did is what you should consider "responsible." The guy only knows the police are looking for this coworker as a person of interest for a crime. There is nothing wrong with his actions to try and turn in Satorou, as well as his actions with Airi. Shes still just 17 and from a regular bystander's point of view this is what it looks like. 17 year old is getting caught in business of a possible killer, why? We have no clue, but girls that age make mistakes so better look out for them. He didn't really deserve the broken cellphone/punch in the teeth.

Only thing the manager really did wrong was look like a weird pervert when mentioning Airi in front of the faceless man and look even more weird perverty when he stalked Airi back to her home, for the real reason of finding Satorou not actual pervert stalking. The dude would look like a hero if he was Kayo's mom's coworker and he turned that bitch in instead.

It's so sad how Hinazuki died. The previous night would've been such a mix. One of the highest highs of her life and then when she goes home, her death. And seeing her body on the ground was so heartbreaking.

>> ARTICLE
This is my theory. Ever notice the similarities between Airi and Hinazuki? They both call the main character stupid a lot. They both have the same hair color, and they both have fallen for Satoru. Satoru also has similar sexual feelings for both of them which he scolds himself for because Airi is in high school and Hinazuka he was actually a 29 year old man. My theory is that Airi is a reincarnated Hinazuka. LETS LOOK AT THE FACTS. March 3rd 1988 Hinazuka dies. Current year is 2006. Airi is 17 years old. Meaning there is an 18 year gap between the time Hinazuka was killed and Airi was introduced in the story. It all just fits too perfectly. If Hinazuka was killed and was immediately reincarnated she would have 9 months until she would be born which would put it at 17 years and 3 months..... COINCIDENCE???

I'm definitely a little late to this thread, but I thought it was interesting that the 1988 scenes are widescreen while back in 2006 it's full screen.

Has anyone else noticed [this](http://puu.sh/mZ47J/bdac93fa3d.jpg) in the opening?
>> ARTICLE
I think talking of this episodes in terms of "specific points", and starting with the more amusing ones would be fun, so let's go with that:

1) How to tell a show is by A-1 studios, known for their ass-focus, and by director Itou Tomohiko? That any scene involving Airi has [something](http://i.imgur.com/xYWVldi.jpg) [like](http://i.imgur.com/YFS3vkK.jpg) [this](http://i.imgur.com/3ooZGtn.jpg). It's much more subtle than other shows, and the show's shot-framing is good and often draws attention away, but it can also draw attention to it, cause it's definitely there. And yes, Airi's cute.

And she's also a crazy badass. I mean, if I were told she's a yandere at this point, I'd have believed it, with how the show built up her different surname, and telling manager not to send the police to her home, it did make it seem plausible she might be hiding something, beyond Satoru. And the show also keeps drawing parallels between her and Kayo, with her constantly asking Satoru if he's stupid, which he picked up on.

2) I have to say, I laughed a bit when we got to "[And then my father quit the co-op, divorced, and left town](http://i.imgur.com/r0G3cYu.jpg)," as a result of shoplifting. Don't shoplift, y'all! But it does make sense, because this scene was all about *trust*, so her father couldn't remain with people who didn't believe in him. Which is what Airi told Satoru, "Please become someone I can believe in," or "please prove my trust wasn't misplaced." A heavy burden, the burden of another person's trust. Which is also why Airi got so angry with the Manager, who betrayed her trust.

3) "[Let's eat](http://i.imgur.com/PZp0Dm5.jpg)!" and then we cut to [an image of The Last Supper](http://i.imgur.com/95eOW3t.jpg), where Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot. Not very subtle. But yes, a murder suspect who doesn't think the police went to his workplace a day later? Silly boy. But the lack of subtlety here still made me chuckle. Maybe it's more subtle in the non-Christian Japanese context?

 Of course, Judas betrayed Jesus for money, but we keep hearing Manager does what he does because he believes it's "The Right Thing," even as we see him meeting with a councilman, so which is it? Perhaps it *is* a subtle hint of him selling his allies for personal gain?

4) Which brings us to how the episode ended. Satoru's allies and friends are being removed. The noose around him tightens. But this is how it's always been, with Yuuki Jun, his friend who stutters, taking the blame for Kayo's disappearance. The feeling of mounting dread, of things coming closer and closer, of loneliness. Thrillers are half suspense-horrors, and this show is doing very well on that front, in terms of "mounting dread", cinematography, and musical score.

5) Kayo, the show hints very strongly her mother and mother's boyfriend did away with her, though it's possible they only found her body after the "Adult man" hid next to her house and killed her himself. Or if they killed her, he was then unsatisfied and thus the next murder came earlier? Or perhaps her mother killed her originally as well and now we see it? Who knows. Does it really matter? I'm not sure it does. What matters is that history will not let you defeat it so easily.

6) Speaking of which, "[there's only so much you can do](http://i.imgur.com/v4VIgyE.jpg), and [there's no use crying over spilled milk](http://i.imgur.com/YUKPgPU.jpg)" is good advice by mother to Satoru, except he is the one who could've made a difference, [and *failed*](http://i.imgur.com/fphEWwd.jpg), so her words burn him.

But her message is still worthwhile, "Don't think of the failure, but of how to do it better [*next time*](http://i.imgur.com/fphEWwd.jpg)!" is what he's thinking. But Satoru, haven't you watched any story about time-travel? You're going down a long and soul-crushing road.

But this is what this show is about, ultimately, about how his soul has been in stasis, how he's been a walking dead, figuratively, ever since this event, [how he's been stopped from moving onward](http://i.imgur.com/4pkmz9A.jpg). And maybe he needs this soul-crushing experience to live once more.

Ho...ly...fuck.

Wtf, not Airi too!? What the shit!? Like how the hell did the murderer know? I'm assuming it's the guy in the suit with the voice that sounds eerily similar to the teacher's, but:

1. How the hell did he deduce that she was with Satoru.
2. How the hell did he know Satoru was not in the house.

This bad dude is legit scary. I honestly think it's the teacher, and if he is...judging from all his actions so far, I think he's one of the scariest villains I've seen in a while. Either way, I can't wait for next week. There's so much content in every episode that I can't keep my eyes off the screen. I'm guessing that Satoru's going to see his mother's friend now? I can't think of anyone else he'd be able to contact, and he just got introduced this episode so he's probably going to play a pretty big part. Maybe he might even go see the teacher. Or his childhood friend, but I doubt he knows his contact information.

...oh, and Airi I guess now is objectively best girl. I mean, Hinazuki is nice, and the mom is good, too. But how can you say no to Airi? You can't. Impossible. Case closed. Kinda. Pizza guy's a creep. But so am I.

EDIT: It's the picture, isn't it. I'll take it out.

Damn,the killer has got it out for Satoru! 
I have 0 proof to back up this claim, but I think Satoru's teacher plays a larger role in these abductions. The scene with him and Kenya alone in the classroom seemed so out of the blue to not be a significant part in what is actually going on. If I was some twisted child abductor/killer being a teacher would be my dream job.

Is Satoru unable to use his ability freely? If he could he would go back as soon as possible but since he hasn't it makes me think that it activates on its own.

I had goosebumbs for like 30 minutes since the beggining. This show is really becoming something more and if it keeps up (and everything says so) then it can really become one of the top shows of all time.  
  
I need my AssClassroom to calm down...
>> ARTICLE
I personally have a suspicion that the killer is Satoru's teacher/guidance councillor from when he was little. He mentions how observant of a man he is.
>> ARTICLE
I like how both Kayo and Airi both ask if Satoru is a baka regularly.

Also, FUCK THIS SHOW'S CLIFF HANGERS!!! WHAT THE FUCK!!!! WHY DOES BAD SHIT ALWAYS HAVE TO HAPPEN TO CUTE GIRLS?

Also, I suspect the guy that was talking to the pizza manager is the killer.

I'm so sad that Kayo was still killed. I wonder when Satoru will go back in time again b/c I think he said before that he keeps going back until he can prevent whatever accident occurred.

Hopefully it's next episode so we get to see Kayo again!

I wonder if he'll ever tell someone about his special power, like Kayo or Airi?

Also, I know how someone said that this was supposed to be a movie but it was split up into 12 episodes. I can really see that being the case with the opening scene here. This actually makes me think about that post the other day that talked about why anime fans don't watch anime movies anymore. I wonder if the director/studio decided to split up b/c it would do better as a weekly show rather than a movie.
>> ARTICLE
My predictions (theory) (might be spoilery):
I refuse to believe it to be a tragedy. Satoru can save the situation only by catching the culprit in the past so his mother never gets killed, etc. In current timeline Airi will die (become charred-pizza-girl as some have mentioned here) this incident will trigger another revival (mind time travel). This time Satoru will realize that he has to catch culprit. And I think culprit is either that teacher or teacher and co. Also I think that in current time teacher is that politician who talked with Manager. So yeah - he is ringleader or just bigshot of pedo-co. In addition I think it was him who made that money to be planted in Hinazuki's backpack by using that boy with whom he talked at the end of that episode. The only question that remains is how Satoru is going to stop sensei. Oh, and I think Hinazuki's mother is innocent of her daughter's murder. She came home with her lover and found her dead. She couldn't call police cos they would deem her guilty. Hinazuki most likely was killed not abducted because due to Satoru she gained desire to live and thus fought with all she had.

Good God, Kayo lying dead on the floor beaten by her mother and that other guy. I don't wanna believe it.  
So far there are 3 victims, which are all girls and 3 suspects which are all guys (manager, the one the manager had a conversation, and the teacher)  
FFUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKK!!!!! I don't wanna wait for another week. Hinazuki And Fujinuma's mom, literally every female character in the story died, and now Airi. Pleaseeeeeeeeeeee.!!!! Noooooo.  
Is Kayo actually Airi? they have the same praises ("Baka na no?").
>> ARTICLE
If that were the case, Airi would be the same age as Satoru but she's 17, so it's safe to asume they are different persons.
>> ARTICLE
The original 3 victims, Kayo and 2 other girls. Satoru's friend got convicted and sentenced to death. Now his mother and Airi with Satoru being the main suspect.
I kinda doubt their homeroom teacher is the culprit. Right now he lacks a clear motive to help Kayo's mother shift the blame over onto somebody else.

What's going to happen next now?!?! and is she dead? damn..

So what happened? did they murder her, and then its just coincidence that kids are being taken and such?

Ok wait, why would the killer text her?

* It leaves a trail

* It serves no purpose considering that the house was already aflame at that point.

So is the ~~killer~~ texter actually trying to warn her perhaps?

 Is the killer not the one on the phone?

Very interesting

 Are there multiple killers?

 Are there more players to this game? 
>> ARTICLE
My guess is that the text was meant as a way to further frame Satoru as the culprit.

Satoru clearly didn't have his mum's phone because it wasn't at the crime scene. The police don't know where it would be, but they *already* suspect Satoru. If Airi somehow made it out, and/or the phone wasn't burned beyond recovery, that text could serve as an extra nail in the coffin regarding Satoru's responsibility. It's a smart move by the killer if that was the intent here.

Unless it *wasn't* the killer who has Sachiko's phone, I don't see a reason for the text.

Holy shit the culprit is pretty fucking clever. Took mom's phone to text the Pizza Girl, mom's phone since was not found with her body is with pre assumed murderer - Satoru. When they find Pizza Girl slightly charred and check her phone - boom. 2 bodies 1 Satoru

I just realized one thing. The day Hinazuki "disappeared" during the Revival was on the 3rd of March, then you can see some girls at some park singing a the Girls' Festival song.

Fastfowarding in the ep, Airi says that Hinazuki died during Girl's Festival day, the 3rd of March, meaning that she was already dead in that scene when she was covered in bruises

Man, I feel so emotionally drained each week after watching this show.

First we see the legs of poor Kayo which broke my heart. Then that creepy smile of her mother as she throws out the mittens, which made me want to bash her skull in. Then we are back in the future and Airi helps him for a desperately needed jolt of happy feelings, just to see her in that last scene...

This is just too much. And show me already what's on the friggin' paper slip!
>> ARTICLE
This could easily be *the* AOTY
>> ARTICLE
Dunno if anyone guessed it, but i guess the killer must have figured out Airi is hiding him because her number would be listed in Satoru's mom's phone, or maybe he simply followed her or something
>> ARTICLE
Anyone notice something that doesn't quite fit? Out of our three deaths, the murderer couldn't even be bothered to show up himself. When Satoru's mom was killed, the murderer killed her and left Satoru to find her body and get suspected. Hinazuki is an ambiguous case, we don't know if the murderer killed her and framed her parents, if her parents killed her, or if the dad is the murderer, but I'll assume it's the first, since the murderer in question doesn't seem like the type of guy to keep living in that same house and let himself get implicated. So, assuming that the murderer framed Hinazuki's parents, that means his MO was the same as with Satoru's mom. Kill in person and let those who find the body get blamed. We can't be sure, but I think he did a similar thing to frame Yuuki for the disappearance of the other kids, probably other friends of Yuuki. Kill them, have him stumble into the wrong place at the wrong time, and bam, he's been caught red-handed. But for Airi... He didn't do that. He just torched her house and dropped a random text to frame Satoru. His MO has changed a bit. Satoru wasn't anywhere near there. There wasn't anybody near Airi when she died. If not for the text, it could have easily been written off as an accident, unlike the other two cases which were clearly murders. So it's clear that the murderer was desperate to shut Airi up before she figured out too much. And he's targeting Satoru. But then, if the murderer knows Airi's protecting Satoru, then why kill her then? Why not earlier when Satoru was physically in her house?

It's the phone. Both Satoru's mom and Airi had their phone. And they'd just figured something out about the murderer. So, assuming he isn't psychic, that means... I theorize that the murderer is experiencing "Revival" himself. Both Satoru's mom and Airi figured out his identity, told someone, and compromised his situation. Thus, he gets sent back in time to just before then, kills them first, frame somebody, and protect himself. Like Satoru, he doesn't have conscious control over it, so he could only kill Airi right before she figured it out and not earlier when it would have been more convenient for him. And the Hinazuki case... I'm guessing the guy made a huge leap 18 years back just like Satoru did. He realized Satoru was trying to change history to expose him... So he went and changed it right back. That's why Satoru couldn't really change the past, because the murderer had already countered him. Time travel is always a little wonky, but I think the murderer went back into the past of the timeline Satoru started in, not the one Satoru went to. The one where Hinazuki died at 10, not 11. The murderer got there first. He got Hinazuki to show up at the science center on that day and run into Satoru by chance. He attended Satoru's birthday party and ate the sandwiches with him, since Satoru's mother clearly knew him. When the time came, he started killing kids, starting with Hinazuki and going on to the ones Yuuki would get blamed for (and retroactively Hinazuki probably). He'd go back to his own timeline, 18 years would pass in the Age 10 timeline, and Satoru would experience a major Revival, entering the Age 11 timeline. However, since Satoru's memories of the Age 10 timeline were set up by the murderer to reflect his actions in the Age 11 timeline, his influence on history is minimized and he fails to stop the murderer.
>> ARTICLE
1. HOLY FUCK that was a good episode, I'm loving Airi's character, and everything is so good.

2. Also am I the only one who think satoru should've surrendered himself to the police and tried to explain the situation and that he is not guilty? I think that would have been a way better course of action than trying to run away and looking more like a criminal. I'm not annoyed by it but it was on my mind the whole time I was watching this episode
>> ARTICLE
Me too, but I recall hearing that the Japanese legal system is all sorts of fucked. In fact, a lot of alleged "suicides" in IRL Japan are murders that they gave up on solving, so it's not too much of a stretch to imagine they'd find Satoru guilty anyways for the sake of saying "case closed".

As someone who has read the manga and is actively waiting for shit to hit the fan. All I can say is get ready for the ride of your life!

Can we take a moment to acknowledge that Airi's father had his life fucked over by a chocolate bar?

i have to [rep](http://www.redbubble.com/people/tehzuh/works/20732364-bokudake-hd).
>> ARTICLE
Here's my theory. The killer has an ability similar to Satoru, this ability (whether it is also time travel, or something else) allows him to frame other people for the murders he commits. In all of the related murders the "guilty suspect" pleads innocent.
In kayos death, Yuuki pleads innocent
In the death 3 years ago in the book Satoru was reading, the perpetrator pleaded innocent.
And now Satoru is being framed for his mothers murder.
This would also make sense why Kayo was targeted, because it would be easy to frame her Mom, if she was beaten and dropped off by the house. This would also explain the male footsteps outside her house.

Holy fuck this is so goooood! This is like a mix between Case Closed and Steins;Gate!

Edit: Just watched the first episode to check some stuff out. Wtf?!! When Satoru goes into his apartment to find his mother dead, he closes the door behind him. But when the neighbor comes by to give him leftovers (and discovers him with his mother's corpse,) the door is WIDE OPEN (She didn't open it because her hands are full carrying food!) And then the cops are suddenly there in literally two seconds! (no time for the witness to call the cops.) I get that they wanted to make everything dramatic, but sheesh!

What an awesome episode. Just at the moment I hoped the episode wouldn't end, it fucking ended.

the voice acting for this series is so awesome its music to my ears.

This is pretty good I'm loving the mystery feel. 

At first it seemed silly to run from the police. Tell his story and he'd be okay they had no real evidence, but his older friend as a kid spent years in jail while innocent. The police are either corrupt or incompetent. Likely corrupt.

The notion that the killer might have police connections seems possible.

Pizza girl got targeted fast.  So  it's someone that knew she was around?

Kayo's mother is sadistic, but I just don't see her smart enough to do any of this. Especially lighting pizza girl's house on fire.

The boyfriend is suspect too.

Going back to the present was nice again, but there had to be a reason in this case now he realizes he has to save pizza girl besides his mother and Kayo.

The teacher is the other male around. Honestly I thought he seemed like a decent guy trying to help. I don't suspect him yet though again he was knowledgeable. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I'd be fine with a show that's just the 2006 bits, but I care much more about the 1988 plot and characters. Damn it, I just want to watch more Kayo and Satoru.

My biggest worry is that Satoru goes back again and overwrites all Kayo's character development. I really identify with Kayo -- I was the shy and awkward girl who was being abused -- and it would be torture to see her personality reset.

Wow what an episode. I have a gut wrenching feeling in my stomach after finishing this episode. <3 Airi.

I am a little sad that younger Satoru didn't exert any more effort the very day Hinazuki didn't come to school.  Yeah, in retrospect it wouldn't have changed anything since we know she died on Girl's Festival, but I am surprised he didn't go into panic mode, call the police or immediately inform his teacher.

Almost like he gave up and assumed she would return.  He gave so much effort and was so careful in micro-managing the days and hours leading up to their birthday.
>> ARTICLE
I'm loving the show, but can't help but wonder what the end goal of seemingly having the ability to traverse time will be for Satoru.  Really sad to see that it takes so much to change the fate of Hanazuki and I might jump of a cliff if Airi is actually dead next chapter.  10/10, can't wait for the next episode.

It seems obvious to me now that Hinazuki murder has nothing to do with the others, she never fit in with the patten of age anyway. Plus was she the only one to be found?

>> ARTICLE
I honestly believe Kenya could be another "Reviver". The way Kenya carries himself is odd for a child his age. Here is how I see it:
1. Kenya is already shown to be suspicious (i.e. His quick shift to red eyes)
2. Kenya's intelligence far exceeds any of the children surrounding him (he noticed something is off with Hinazuki)
3. Kenya's observation skill are almost too good (look at his interest in Satoru and Hinazuki)
4. Kenya is also unfazed by Hinazuki's disappearance in this episode (not even giving Satoru words of encouragement like his other friends)

There is, in my opinion, no way Kenya is not somehow involved in this whole situation. I don't think he can be the murder (How would he kill the second girl from the other school while still having to attend school himself?) but he's definitely connected to the case.

> Why is everyone getting downvoted in this thread....

The downvote brigade happens quite often when a series picks up immense popularity. It happens all the time. It usually balances out after time.
>> ARTICLE
It also doesn't help when snarky manga readers keep on talking about the manga and "it's gonna be so awesome" or "the manga did this better."

I personally don't like any comments related to the manga because even the slightest indication can ruin the experience for a viewer but people don't have to get butthurt and downvote comments like that.
>> ARTICLE
Not all manga readers are snarky. I've read the manga, and the only time I say anything like "the manga did this better" or something similar is when somebody has questions over what happened and give them better context. The anime is slimmed down from the content of the manga, so knowing minor things like Satoru can have more than 1 revival for an incident can give people better understanding of the rules of this universe. Or that Airi was involved with 3 of Satoru's revivals before he was sent back to being and kid, and one of them she actually participated in can give a clearer understanding of why she would have faith in him. Things like this don't ruin the anime itself, nor does it spoil the story, but can give anime only fans better understanding of the motivations of the characters.

I thought I tried to make my comment non-generalizing (hence the smarky manga readers instead of just manga readers) but I guess I could of worded it better.

And while some addition details to add-on to what the episode covered isn't a bad thing (with what you said in particular); even the most minute of details about the future can warp someones expectations of a show. It's difficult for manga readers to hold in what's going to happen in a show ( I should know cause I almost spoiled a ton of stuff with Yamada-kun and the 7 Witches).
>> ARTICLE
Idk a lot of manga readers that post on these threads have been pretty nice about it. This isn't the fate franchise. I've seen a lot of manga readers just say this adaptation is fantastic and I even saw one saying to not read the manga, because if you catch up in the manga, the waits are almost berserk-level.

Same. It was such a good read. Wish it was all translated though!

[This episode's theme.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8TZbze72Bc)

I was so happy about this episode. Airi got like no screentime in the first episode, but now we can see her best moments. I like her more than Hinazuki, is that wrong? [](/s "But she still looks better in the manga.")

I also kinda how they had no foreshadowing of the jump back, something the [cover of volume 3](http://media.animexx.onlinewelten.com//artikel/manga/12364/logo_gross.jpg) (which this episode half adapts) blatanly spoils. How many of you were taken by total surprise?
>> ARTICLE
I knew the jump back would happen sometime thanks to the op but not when. Makes sense because he couldn't change anything else in the past. 
>> ARTICLE
Ehh, I'll admit, this episode didn't really do anything for me. Too many moments that were just too absurd for me to take seriously. 

Edit- People actually downvoting me for expressing my opinion in a discussion thread. Nice. 
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry. Everyone always just goes with the hivemind and instantly downvotes anything that doesn't conform to the majority opinion. For what its worth I upvoted you even though I enjoyed this episode.

All those problems for a stolen chocolate? For real? And because she believed her dad for not stealing sweets, she believes a coworker accused of murder? Kind of a stretch...

But ain't nobody got time to criticize... Because they keep on piling on the tension and the cliffhangers. Oh god why are you doing this to me?

Manager's face looks weird, but nothing a punch won't fix.
>> ARTICLE
IIRC in the manga, Airi mentions her mom regretting not trusting her husband and divorcing him. Airi doesn't want to become her.
>> ARTICLE
That's kind of worse.

"I did wrong by my husband by not trusting him, and so I will do things even worse by divorcing him."

I can see why Airi wouldn't want to turn out like that.
>> ARTICLE
I meant (her mom regretting (not trusting her husband and divorcing him)) not ((her mom regretting not trusting her husband) (and divorcing him)) as you seem to understand it.. :)
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I see. 

Being remorseful for divorcing is a bit better, but still... Divorcing over stolen chocolate is lame.
>> ARTICLE
>Kind of a stretch...

While I agree it's a stretch and the anime didn't really portray the divorce in a direct, believable way (I didn't read the manga so hell I don't know what they did differently), this was *technically* told from the POV of Airi (so a child's interpretation) and that marriages can collapse IRL from even the smallest events that can trigger a breakdown.



>> ARTICLE
>it's just told from the PoV of Airi as a child

That's a fair point

>smallest events trigger divorce

Kind of tells you what flimsy concept marriage has become.
>> ARTICLE
oh no... what is happening to my favorite show?! notlikethis.

what was with the whole creepy manager scene? why did satoru run away from gloves in a garbage bag? you're 29 years old, calm down. and why run from the cops? i mean it's a lot easier to investigate after you clear your name. and don't tell me that he's in shock. he's had months to digest his mother's death and hinazuki dying shouldn't be too much of a surprise. im also pretty sure opening your door wouldn't result in a fire explosion causing your windows to be shatter and knocking you out.. i mean unless you got a propane tank in your bedroom lol. and finally who gets divorced/kicked out of a council for stealing a chocolate bar. that's absurd. i mean i heard of things snowballing out of control, but chocolate bar?

"are you stupid?" yeah, im starting to think he is.
>> ARTICLE
> and why run from the cops? i mean it's a lot easier to investigate after you clear your name. and don't tell me that he's in shock.

Infact running in this situation is the best thing to do. He wouldn't be able to clear his name, the crime took place in **his** house, there only be **his** fingerprints at the scene, and he was caught with blood on his hand. Any character references will just make him look like the type to snap and turn to that sort of act, and he had just failed with another Manga manuscript so he would have motive to be frustrated. 

So in this situation what's more likely, a killer akin to a hitman, snuck into the house and stabbed her with a kitchen knife leaving no prints or trace of his existence, or a mother and son got into a fight while the son was frustrated with his career and he snapped, stabbing her with the knife. Any detective would look to the latter. 

Even if they were to eventually believe him, he would be locked up as the key suspect for weeks, maybe months and he wouldn't have the chance to search out the real killer himself, or be able to go back to the past to try and fix everything.

> and finally who gets divorced/kicked out of a council for stealing a chocolate bar. that's absurd.

It's not the chocolate bar, it was what it represented. First up there was his honour as a business man that he wouldn't steal something that he could easily afford, then there was the trust between him, his wife and the people of the town that had broken down upon viewing him as a thief. It show's the relationship wasn't already built on too solid of a foundation, but welcome to most modern relationships. 
>> ARTICLE
you get downvoted for phrasing it like that but i thought exactly the same. so many things didnt make any sense to me like airi just punching the manager in the face and getting a breakdown out of nowhere. this is really unfortunate considering the other episodes were very well rounded
>> ARTICLE
lol i cleaned it up. i was just expressing my thoughts right after finishing the episode. needless to say, i was incredibly disappointed. 

and you're right. though that scene was very rewarding (i think he deserved it).. in reality, it's kind of stupid. "what are you doing here?" "you sold us out?!" *ONE PAWWNCHHH in the face!* lol. that's assault, little lady.

i hope next week's episode will be better. i enjoyed the story so far because it was 'natural' in a 'supernatural' setting. everything felt realistic besides the whole time traveling thing. but this episode? everything was forced and dramatic. it lost its crispness/refinement.

It was another entertaining episode but I have to say that the quality of the writing seemed to take a nosedive. It was full of characters doing completely ridiculous things and not doing the obvious. Hope it's not a sign of things to come.
>> ARTICLE
Because getting to meet a friend who is running away from being suspected and framed for a murder is a normal occurrence.

As Satoru said, the manager is not in the wrong here.
If you were in his shoes and know that your female colleague is keeping a fugitive whose innocence is questionable in her house, I'd bet you'll try to call the cops on him too.

Also, Airi immediately aiding Satoru's escape is just because of her past trauma and it's not wrong to say that she's doing this for herself.

this chapter was great ...

Come onnn Airi, you don't just open the door when you know there is a fire right behind it
>> ARTICLE
Why doesn't he track down his mother's former co-worker?
>> ARTICLE
Good stuff! It's cool to be back in the present for a while - Airi is a fucking boss. I could tell from the second she said she'd bring him a change of clothes that she was about to bite it, and perhaps be the trigger that sends Satoru back again.

The guy talking to the manager is obviously suspicious - the way he watched Airi leave the pizza place. I wonder if he followed her home to find out where she lived so he could set the fire. Hell, the manager himself seems to be set up as [another creepy guy](http://i.imgur.com/tC7LzUL.jpg). He's also yet another character with chestnut-coloured eyes - wouldn't be surprised to see his glowing red at some point.

One thing of definite interest is that Satoru seemed to think he had a connection with another abduction case just 3 years before the present. He said he had a strange feeling about remembering that - what could that mean? He knew the suspect? The victim? Maybe his mum reported it? 

It was also cool to see that his actions in the past did have a tangible effect on the future. Probably an obvious point, but it cements that her death was delayed despite how little Satoru thought he did. He himself seemed surprised that her death date had changed, so I suppose it reinforces the idea that if he just makes enough of a difference, she won't be in that paper at all.

By the way, Kayo's bruised legs being the only new screentime she got this week is so haunting. The way she was lifeless, having clearly been found in the shed. Makes me sick that she's nothing but a ragdoll to her mum and boyfriend. Even though it feels like they're not the ones directly responsible for her death, I'm interested in how the mum got to the point of caring so little about her daughter. I guess just your typical neglection through drugs and likely prostitution. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Airi either lied about what happened with her parents or she doesn't know the full story herself. There is no explanation as to how the chocolate bar got there and divorce over a chocolate bar sounds ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks to my shitty internet, I realized exactly how much I love this show.

Every time it stopped to buffer, I wanted to beat someone up!

Fuck ;-; I can't even handle this crap man. Last episode I was thinking maybe, just maybe, there was a chance. Now all this is happening?! Nope. I hate this show. I need more of it though. I don't want to wait a week for the next episode.

Fuck me ;-;

Ok, so a few words first before I go cry forever. I *really* like how he goes back into the current timeline. I'm trying to figure out how he does it though. Maybe because he wasn't able to fulfil saving Hinazuki, so the power is all like "bruh, try again". Then the guy who was talking to the manager is very suspicious. I got a bad feeling about him. Also, fuck the manager, but I completely see from his side why he would do that. He has no way of actually knowing, so I don't blame him at all. But still fuck him! 

I know this is sort of all over the place, but my god that scream of Anguish after seeing the mittens in the trash.. fuck me... alright going to go cry now ;-;

Why did the killer text her to stay were she is if the fire was already lit? Even if she didn't look at the phone, she wouldn't have the time to escape the house.

I don't know if this was intentional or not, but the teacher had the same voice actor as the person who was talking with the manager. They even intentionally didn't show the persons face. Very suspicious. I honestly believe that the teacher is the culprit of all this. I swear I keep noticing the small things.
>> ARTICLE
RIP Airi, you were and always will be best girl. 

gone too soon ;-;
>> ARTICLE
> Airi best... oh fuckno

My reaction.

>> ARTICLE
What an episode.... I have a feeling that the killer is some sort of "sponsor" from Satoru's town. He has access to the investigations and all the information related to the cases. He finds broken people and enables them, and when they fuck up, he removes the spotlight from them by framing someone who has no chance of defending themselves.

Hinazuki was abused and the CPS visited them several times, yet her mom and boyfriend knew exactly when they'd come. Finally when they went too far, and then suddenly (even Satoru says that it seemed too quick) other children started to disappear, leading to the conviction of Yuuki. I'd say that one of his "clients" was the kidnapper from the town nearby and he offered him consequence-free action, because it was an easy and believable cover.

In the present Satoru's mom recognizes a kidnapping by the same guy from '88, who was a suspect early on. The person panics and similiarly calls in the killer, who this time makes it look like a serial murder, by Satoru. Involved in an accident where he would've been under suspicion if not for Airi's word, in a dead end job, could easily be seen as someone unstable finally breaking.

I guess that would still have the problem of two unrelated issues: stopping Hinazuki's mom from abusing her and stopping the mastermind behind these people.
>> ARTICLE
This shit is so good that it's bad for your heart
>> ARTICLE
The amount of spoilers/foreshadowing in the Op is just utterly-mutterly-butterly. 

Seems things are shaping to be in sort of Steins;Gate - jumping back to try to fix stuff and learn in "future" what more can be done. That said, and seeing OP again i REALLY hope it won't be [spoiler in case becomes true](/s "he won't sacrifice himself so that Airi / Mom / Kayo would live. I WANT A LITTLE HAPPINESS PLEASE, IS IT SO MUCH TO ASK ?!?!")  This will be a wild ride.
>> ARTICLE
This show really likes killing off the females in Satoru's life. Also, I like how every episode is gripping, but the cliffhangers are just ridiculous.
>> ARTICLE
I keep underestimating this anime. "Oh, they wouldn't kill off Hinazuki again... she's just skipping school to make his present, right?" nope. "Oh hey, pizza girl again, shes gonna help him!" nope.............

roller coaster of emotions here.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so everything that can go wrong will go wrong until Satoru can finally set everything right. I fucking hate it, not because it's bad, or terrible, or is wrong. But because it feels so right to hate how it's going. Everything is going down for our MC, he keeps losing all of his allies, and he just doesn't find the right answers yet. That the anime can provoke such strong emotions every single episode is an example of a show doing things right. We are feeling what the anime wants us to feel, and that's great.

Now if the story wasn't so heartbreaking...

Pardon me if this theory was brought up before. I believe I know why it's butterflies Satoru sees before he leaps. It occurred to me when Airi retold her father "stealing" the chocolate bar. Due to this seemingly insignificant event, his life is in shambles.

Well, after least week, I couldn't hold back from reading what i could of the manga any longer. But, I am excited to see how everything is animated in the show from the manga.

Also, I'm excited to read these threads, and get reactions from people over what happened, and what they think is gonna happen.

This is the first show I've ever broken down and read ahead in the manga before, and i can't be more excited to see how this ends.

Fuck that was amazing. Loved how the HS girl being attacked by the killer(s) was foreshadowed in the OP (the blue-red transition between Satoru and the killer), and its execution was brilliant. The one second shot of the Last Supper in the Satoru-Manager meeting established the mood brilliantly, and that was a nicely designed house if I might say so myself.
>> ARTICLE
Airi, my best girl! It feels nice to see her again :) I love how everything from the OP really gives hints here and there about the storyline. It's clear that somehow Satoru needs to save three female figures in his life. But unlike Hinazuki, at least Airi is not a child and hopefully she's able to protect herself more.

>> ARTICLE
Honestly, going back in the past was super climatic and that could've been pushed further. Instead, having it meddle down by bringing it back into the present wasn't as interesting. Still though, having the killer loom above past and present is the hook.
>> ARTICLE
Satoru's old elementary school teacher could have ended up somehow empathizing with Kayo's mom after her killing. Remember how he had an unusually strong hunch that Kayo was being abused? That could just be a result of his concern for her absense and latenesses, or a hint at the close relation to her mom. What is the teacher's status in the current (2006) timeline? He clearly has more relevance in the story, because if not, he wouldn't have be shown fleshed out as such, (or directly speaking with Satoru after school) so often. I think the situation called for them having contact with Satoru after class, but maybe that's good writing to make us believe that he's innocent. Despite my hunch on the teacher, I think it's almost definite that the mother and father killed Kayo (mostly the mom's crazy ass tho). There wouldn't have been a reason for her to smile in such a psychotic manner if not. Given her prior attitude towards her daughter, she would have probably been frustrated that she wasn't the one who killed Kayo if someone else committed the crime. Her mom's also a bit more one demensional than other characters, so what happened is probably laying right on the surface. I think the real mystery is how she covered it up, the connection to the teacher, and why the killings a preceding all the way into 2006. 

But why Satoru's mom? Why kill her? This clearly dates back to Satoru's childhood. Who would his mom have spoken to after the "disapearence"? Didn't Satoru's mom say that children shouldn't have to remember an event as such? And didn't Satoru's teacher agree (or maybe even propose the idea on his own) to not share the disappearance with the class? Satoru's mom knew of Kayo's abuse. She probably talked with the teacher and he found out that she knew. Who knows. 

Also, this portion may or may not be relevant, but I'll type it out anyways: 

Isn't it weird that in the midst of this mystery, Airi's parents aren't actually the ones who live with her? Airi also reminded Satoru of Kayo by asking (more than once, like Kayo) "Are you stupid?" Maybe that's just the writer creating a sense of nostalgia. 



This is off topic but I also do want to add that I feel as though Kayo's character is a bit too mature. Yeah, of course an child victim of both physical and emotional abuse will be forced to feel and think mature things, but not process them in the mature way that she did. ie.) Aiko from Oyasumi Punpun - she was abused but her letting out her feelings of sorrow and feelings of general hopelessness towards the world are more subconscious and instinctual, rather than so clearly filtered like Kayo's. This anime's amazing so far regardless though. 


TLDR; Mom killed Kayo, teacher has something to do with it, and maybe Airi saying "Are you stupid?" Isn't just a sense of nostalgia for Satoru, but a clue?

So when they started talking about that one trash bag, I started thinking about blue excorcist. I remember in the middle of one episode, there was a commercial break or something that was a part of the episode on like every fricking anime site.

Depending on how old the manager is, I think it's probably the manager.
Reasons: 1) he seems intent on having Satoru imprisoned.
2) his reaction when Airi says she's getting take out pizza for her friend

Mind=fucked
>> ARTICLE
I end every episode sitting in stunned silence. This show is just too good man.

I don't think it's Nishizono because the killer appeared to have some facial hair when he was abducting the kid before Sachiko caught onto him. And Nishizono doesn't. He could have shaved before talking to the manager, but I think Nishizono is a red herring. Just a feeling. So far he generally seems to fit every bit of criteria for the killer, except for one. In episode 4 every "suspect" was showed at the point when the original abduction occurred. Nishizono was grading papers, Kenya was playing in his back yard, Yuuki was sitting on a hill, Kayo's dad was drinking, and her mom was at home. Although, Nishizono would have known that Kayo was with Satoru that day. I don't think the killer is Satoru, he doesn't look like Satoru. Similar, but not the same. It's somebody with wavy hair, a bigger nose than Satoru, and possibly some facial hair. Could be the pizza manager. 

Whoever it is, knew that Satoru would be at Airi's house and that Airi was helping him, which Nishizono might because of his involvement with the manager. I still don't want to think it's him, though. I think the show is trying to frame him.

Holy shit, what an episode.

What the hell is this show doing to me? Its ability to make me feel absolutely fucking sick to my stomach. How she got beaten, her shame in being discovered, how her mother shoved her face into the iced water, that little shit trying to frame her.

But then on a completely opposite end of the spectrum, that scene they shared at that Christmas tree was just beautiful - both the happiness of the moment and the sincerity in the promise they make.

Fuck, again, what an episode...
>> ARTICLE
By far the best series released this winter.
>> ARTICLE
This show is a good case for good drama tending to be good complements for feel good moments and vice versa. You really feel sadder during dark/dramatic scenes  knowing the happy moments happens between characters. But you also feel happier when characters can escape certain doom and hardships.

 Nothing wrong with purely dark dramas and purely happy shows, but if there is a good mix of the two in a single series, it helps supplement the other aspect.

Probably Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. But to be honest, considering three episodes in, I'm enjoying this one even more than that

I loved Shigatsu... But I swear to god watching it I was thinking that if he forgets how to fucking hear notes one more god damn time I'm going to snap my keyboard in half.

i would say parasyte was the last anime to get me like this  emotional loving this anime so far!!
>> ARTICLE
Not just that, but Satoru's monologuing was good at invoking feels.

"I messed that up 18 years ago too" made me go "oh shit, no :("

and the part with the foxes "I came here alone 18 years ago and no one believed me", this time he's with someone else :D
>> ARTICLE
> that little shit trying to frame her.

It felt so good when Satoru lashed out at her. Kids like that girl are the worst.
>> ARTICLE
That scene reminded me

I remember back in first grade someone's cards (digimon or pokemon or something) got stolen and my first instinct was to blame the sketchy kid in class. Without much hassle we got to search his bag and the cards were in it, and he fessed up.

I still kind of felt bad, though in 4th grade he stole my heelys and came to school wearing them the next day... and they were mine for sure because I had one blue and one orange wheel, and had remembered a piece of the stitching coming loose on mine that was identical on 'his'.

Also he sucked at heely-ing soo...

Ah well.
>> ARTICLE
I remember in 1st grade the opposite sort of happened to me. My notebooks had sticky labels on them with funny pics and a few days later my notebook went missing. Few days later another kid in my class shows up with the same label on his notebook and I immediately accused him of stealing my notebook and label. Turns out his mom actually bought it for him and I found mine later on. 

I just felt horrible for blaming him and even got the teacher to yell at him initially. After it all we became good friends but I'll probably still never live stuff like that down. Taught me to never accuse or blame anyone without proof.
>> ARTICLE
Aww, yeah I don't even harbour that much ill will towards the guy who stole from me. He wasn't well off iirc and had a hard time in school.

In your case I mean, you were young and in the heat of the moment it just made sense. Not too much to feel bad about. Embarrassed maybe :P

50/50 chance of smart_kid conspiring with teacher or confronting teacher.  Given how obvious they're foreshadowing it, smart_kid is probably not a bad guy.

I hope you're right - the smart kid is great and would be an awesome ally to MC if he didn't turn out to be evil.

Oh wait, smart_kid may be reporting to the teacher that the MC is acting suspiciously around the girl.  Haha, now MC becomes the prime suspect in the potential kidnapping.

I dunno about that - he seems to think MC just has a crush on her.  On the other hand, he may be reporting that MC has completely changed his personality.

You can see the humanity breaking finally breaking through the surface.

Wonder if this marks a big change in her character or she returns to her moody self but being made much easier to be happy
>> ARTICLE
^^\*\* ^^I ^^haven't ^^read ^^the ^^manga. ^^\*\*

I think this is all going to backfire. When you're depressed and sad, nothing really disappoints you. Kinda like how she was all "oh... you lied..." when he told her he'd give it his best but then didn't?

She doesn't care because she's used to being treated like that. She's used to being let down by people who pretend to care for her.

But now... now she remembers happiness, and she's going to stick that emotion to the MC. It opens a weakness in the armor she's built for herself to protect her from the rest of the world. And when he fucks up (I'm sure he's going to fuck up -- or at least he'll be pushed towards fucking up) it's going to bring her down harder than anything else.
>> ARTICLE
It's all the more touching because Kayo clearly doesn't have a lot in her life to smile about :(
>> ARTICLE
The pacing in this anime is some of the best i've ever seen in awhile... there are no boring parts.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Everything feels meaningful and doesn't feel like they are jumping from scene to scene really. 
>> ARTICLE
Even as a kid Satoru and his character just interests me so much. Every episode just adds more to the mistakes he's made and the flaws he has, yet I can't help feeling similarities in these imperfections.
>> ARTICLE
He's such a great MC to watch, the hingsight he has about going through most of this once, just really adds another level to it. I love when both the older and younger Satoru speak the same line at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe Satoru just cruised through his childhood in a  carefree way, but now he just has these insights and inquisitive attitude of an adult.

He kind of reminds me of Conan in Detective Conan.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're right. When his grown-up friend told him to 'fake it until you make it' (essentially), he probably focused so hard on being relatable towards his classmates that work, family (and family time) and all that got pushed aside a bit. He maybe didn't notice much other than the prospects in his friends group.

After going back in time he's already got people skills and so on, so has more time (and of course motivation) to look around and notice everything else
>> ARTICLE
The way that he seems to discover more and more each episodes as he regains memories from his past is awesome. Let's hope he is able to save Hinazuki.
>> ARTICLE
Man, his realization he had when he repeated the same mistake. I thought he had made the right choice only to be like "fucking hell," and Hinazuki getting mad at him only made it worse.
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind im pretty sure he doesn't want to try to avoid changing unnecessary details like winning that race so he doesn't have a butterfly effect occur and suddenly when hes older hes Japan's top Olympic ice skater.
>> ARTICLE
Saving someone's life is pretty bad as far as the butterfly effect goes though, so he's probably not overly worried as far as that goes.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it would probably be better than delivering pizzas to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's more of, he's trying to keep extraneous stuff the same as much as possible to lower the chances of unexpected incidents.
>> ARTICLE
Three episodes in, I realize that Boku dake ga Inai Machi is not a TV anime.

It is an anime movie split up into twelve parts that is aired weekly.
>> ARTICLE
The manga flows from one chapter to the next pretty briskly, so that is probably why the show feels like it goes from one episode to the next so smoothly. Kind of like how Parasyte (manga and anime) felt like a continuous progression of story than being truly episodic.
>> ARTICLE
The show is just beautiful to watch. I hope they can keep this quality up throughout all 12 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
So far so good though
>> ARTICLE
The whole wide screen effect really drives that in, I agree.  
 
Plus, there's this crispness to it all, it feels well prepared. I mean, I wouldn't really know if it isn't, but it comes off that way. 

Edit: There's a lot of anime that really drive each plot point into your head and make you feel as though you're being looked down on, but this one is much more fluid and organic with how they deliver exposition. That's just a big plus for me
>> ARTICLE
The MC'S VA  adds a lot to that "crisp" feeling, since he's new.
>> ARTICLE
I think he's doing an awesome job. [Mitsushima, Shinnosuke](http://myanimelist.net/people/39726/Shinnosuke_Mitsushima) is new to VA but he's an Actor.
The natural delivery really adds to the suspense. He has a soothing voice, almost calming considering all that's been happening to poor Hinazuki. 


Young Satoru is voiced by another anime VA newbie [Tsuchiya, Tao](http://myanimelist.net/people/39725/Tao_Tsuchiya) who's also doing a splendid job. Very cute and mature sounding.

That voice seems incredibly perfect for the internal monologue that it's used for, aside from the contrast of "adult" to his child physicality.
>> ARTICLE
That outburst when he snapped at that little shit trying to frame her was just brilliant.
>> ARTICLE
He seems to be an amazing VA overall. He does the serious/calm moments well and his outburst was just so emotional and impressive.
>> ARTICLE
The wide screen effect is there for the shots through his childhood. It's  an artistic choice to present that, don't think it was for the movie feel. 

I think it's the solid animation it has, that gives it that "crispness and well prepared" feel you are having from it , and it does definitely give it a good "movie" vibe of quality animation. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, definitely the wide screen is for his childhood, but I think it works twofold to bring about a cinematic vibe 
>> ARTICLE
I guess it gives the feel that he's watching his own life being played again. Referenced in the OP as well.

Which makes you feel bad because it might be one of those stories where the protagonist tries his best to prevent something, only to indirectly be the catalyst to cause that something. I just want a happy ending.

Speaking of "parents"... the mom's boyfriend (I doubt he's her biological father) had red eyes. A *red* herring, perhaps?
>> ARTICLE
The mother had them in the shed scene as well, and the smart kid in a previous episode. I think it's just a stylistic choice about frame of mind.
>> ARTICLE
You and me both.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder why for a certain frames some people have red eyes. Kayo's [mother](http://i.imgur.com/tO8WJj2.png), [father](http://i.imgur.com/SgihX1T.png) and [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/wVCkuMy.png) had them. From my understanding the red eyes represents the bad guys, but interestingly, Yuuki [also had them](http://i.imgur.com/zKNGJuf.jpg) and we learned that he was in fact not the killer. Maybe he was partially involved in the crime?

Either it could be that, or the red eyes each represents a sin of some sort.^^not ^^the ^^seven ^^deadly ^^sins  
Obviously we know what Kayo's mother had done, and her father ignores whatever abuse the mother is doing to Kayo. The reason  Yuuki had those during that key frame was maybe because he felt like it was wrong to show him the porn mags, or maybe the tape written in moon language was something to do with the crime?

This could be totally wrong, and this has nothing to do with super powers or some sorts, just the director adding something extra I guess.

Anyways, I really enjoyed this episode so far and I had a pretty "holy shit"-moment when they showed how [fucked his life was in present time](https://i.imgur.com/eOjeOAD.png).
>> ARTICLE
I think the red just more or less is meant as a red herring. I think its being used as a means of drawing your attention to something that may or may not be relevant to the case. 

My only guess for that is because in the manga Satoru never walked by the guy after he killed Satoru's mother in 2006.
>> ARTICLE
The red color in this show seems to be associated with bad stuff. Or at least emphasized in a lot of scenes in previous episodes. Kayo's jacket is red. Is red the marker for death? Please no...
>> ARTICLE
I think its red to keep us guessing as to who the killer would be. Everyone with red eyes has been a suspect so far.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking five minute episodes

Is it next Wednesday yet
>> ARTICLE
comment will be buried but.. i just want to think this through like a murderer mystery where we're provided with the elements needed.

three victims were presented. We know that victim two was a known associate and that it might have happened after. They said that hinazuki was the first victim based on how old she was. february second is the first kidnapping.

No suspects were presented yet but we know this

1) Mother knew something was off and called someone prior to the guy killing her.

2) Guy recognized mother and son as they scared him off that kidnapping.

3) During the timeskip, he did not kidnap at all.

This absolutely rules out Yuuki as we have established he was not able to kidnap during the second point. I think the plot establishes this.

However, the recognizing the mother recognizing the killer and the killers ability to lure the kids away leads me to believe that 1) he is familiar with who they are (like all kidnappers) and 2) he has a established method of determining his victims.

The first victim, kaya, is a test. to see if the killer was able to pulll it off without suspects. 

The second victim, i propose, is a known associate of the killers. Since he's one of the kids, after the first murderer (about a year- they JUST turned 10), everyone would have been on guard of the kidnapper. Hence, it would be more difficult to kidnap someone,

We know that Satoru and the second victim as well as hinazuki walk the same direction home. This establishes a pattern and  should give us a radius of where the kidnapper works. Also, see how the kidnapper was in the same area when he tried to kidnap when satoru was 28. Home turf.

I think the ominous scene at the end was a false flag. They were most likely discussing something that will be shown next week. However, those two are currently the most likely suspects. 

However, the silver haired kid walks the opposite direction of Satoru and the teacher is currently shown as a good individual. Who knows if he really is.

Just rewatched the scene in the first season where the kidnapper is apparent. Mother knew him and he knew her. He recognized her first so they must have crossed paths before... with him recognizing her before she did him. Implying... he was suspicious of her from the start as she had a major role to play within the original trial. 

The page that she opened to had the third victim, near what looks like the drainage runoff where they played as kids. 


Victim #3 was also 11 years old... but i think the kidnapping happened at a later date. Two of the classmates were murdered. Hinazuki and the other boy. The third girl also happened but i think the timeline was concise as shiratori was convicted 6 months later.

This means: Kaya was murdered. Satoru turns 11. Boy turns 11. Girl turns 11. They were all in the same class within a 6 month period. However, suspicion of the teacher was relieved somehow. He should have been a prime suspect but was never acquitted because they were focused on Yuuki since he played in the park. I think this was because the third girl was found in the park- hence, the misdirection.

Teacher is still a viable suspect. 

My running theory is this. 10 days before her birthday she died. That day in the park is the last day that he saw her. We see her get beaten the next day and she is out until monday. Except, in the future, she never makes it in on monday. That weekend, she is kidnapped and killed, leaving the teacher, who knew she was being abused, as suspect. But why would the teacher kill the second kid in the class? That would draw massive attention to him. So the teacher is not the killer by obvious standards. 

Unfortunately we don't know the timeline of the questioning. It seems like it was after the third victim, giving the second victim time.

They also didn't find the body of kaya until after spring... meaning the second victim might have been kidnapped right after. Maybe, because he saw kaya get kidnapped as they walk in the same direction.

We know that they have a secret hideout that they don't go to in the winter, but what if boy 2 was there when they went, and was kidnapped from the hideout? Or, maybe the hideout was in a spot where he could witness the kidnapping.

Need more clues. EVerything points to the teacher but that's too obvious. Can't be the detective as that is who mother was calling.

Also, the killer was wearing a suit. Why? he was stalking her all day but wearing a suit? 

I am beginning to think that the teacher is a red herring. I honestly believe that the real killer is the child protective services guy that is not yet mentioned.

He would have been at the original questioning, as they were responsible for the case.

He would know who the neglected children were.

He could tip them off in order to establish a timeline where they tried and failed to meet the children.

I think #2 was a fluke- a necessity rather than a need.

The mother would only see him in passing, while he would take notice of the mother of the child whose testamony was key to conviction.

Girl 3 looks happy... but i believe also a necessity. Deposited near the river bank in order to frame yuuki who he might have known was suspect during the investigation.

need more clues tbh, but this is what i think so far. Teacher is red herring, CPS is suspect.

Same here. I'm really worried about what will happen with this other girl. Is she going to get neglected by the MC consistently until he realizes he may save Kayo but the other girl dies.

Oh manthat hurt my heart. That **really** hurt my heart. That was just painful. Ow.

Fuck, so she gets a beating every weekend. But it feels weird for a teacher to spill it to an elementary schooler. I guess he's that desperate...or maybe he's the bad guy? That would just be horrible.

At least the episode ended on a bit more heartwarming note. It *kinda* helped wash some internal hatred away. It's kinda funny watching this guy go full World Break on us, though, remembering things here and there. That's like the only thing I can do to keep myself from dying inside.

Ugh. Now to go to watch a chubby dude with marshmallows to get me happy again...

> Fuck, so she gets a beating every weekend. But it feels weird for a teacher to spill it to an elementary schooler.

He did say that he was debating telling the entire class, however he was afraid that it would turn the class against her

I nearly forgot that Ojisan and Marshmallow aired on Thursdays. Thanks for the reminder
>> ARTICLE
> He did say that he was debating telling the entire class

That's true. But I was just thinking why he would even contemplate telling the class at all. I mean, they're only in 5th grade.

The more I think about it, though, the more his choice seems reasonable, since no matter what he would have done, the class would have turned on her. And if this has been going on for some time, and Satoru is the only guy to show her sympathy...I can see it happening.

> Thanks for the reminder

Oh man. As much as I absolutely **loved** this episode, I was constantly telling myself, *"You got marshmallows after this. You got marshmallows after this. You got marshmallows after this..."*

At least we know now that the teacher did take notice of the bruises. Many people were speculating that the teacher was just oblivious.

I'm wondering if the teacher can sort of "sense" something being up with Satoru, hence deciding to confide in him.  I get the same impression from Yukki and Kenya noticing something is different about him.

> I get the same impression from Yukki and his blonde friend noticing something is different about him.

Maybe that is why the teacher is also talking to Kenya?

Or maybe he is suspicious of Satoru for other reasons that aren't clear yet as the teachers meeting with Kenya was a pretty mysterious way to end the episode.

That "christmas" tree scene was amazing. She smiled, I'm not sure exactly what needs to be done to change the future, but Satoru is definitely on the right path. Getting a child of abuse to smile is not an easy thing ti do.

The teacher having all that information about students is making me feel uneasy though. This show really makes the case that adults you would normally trust can be the biggest enemies.

Yeah, that is true, thinking about it the teacher could be a perfect killer, he knows all about these kids, he knows who the lonely ones without friends are, if they leave by themselves.

The scenes of the physical abuse contrasted so well with the scene of them standing by the tree in the end.  This episode was simultaneously heartwarming and horrifying.

Same here. Hopefully the manga readers here will chill out and not spoil anything cause otherwise I'll go nuts.
>> ARTICLE
OMG. Episodes are too short! And hence I'll be here every week singing praises to this show like everyone else.

Such a terrible phenomenon (child abuse) making for such a good story. I kind of feel guilty enjoying it. The show is THAT good.

Though I didn't exactly understand the skating contest. Did he let that guy win? (it was implied yes) but why? 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah he let Hamuda win, as for why well at first they play it off as him thinking he's winning through the knowledge he gained as an adult but infact it seems to be a show of his character and how he believes those who work the hardest deserve to win. 

I'm betting this personality trait will come into play later down the line. 

It was also used to lure us into believing he had changed the past when he hadn't, at least until that beautiful last scene. 
>> ARTICLE
He definitely is faster than Hamada, even without his adult knowledge. It showed from his memories that the result was exactly the same 18 years ago originally, with Hamada having the same reaction. That why he said he made a mistake

While I do like the anime version, nothing can beat the [Wham Shots](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot) like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/74bN3Aa.png) the manga has. 

Obligatoy manga naysay comment: This episode was about two chapters, that's one third of a volume, like last episode. Trying to predict what might likey cut to streamline the plot in the long run gives me Brynhildr flashbacks. 

I'm hoping for the best. I really love the anime so far and hope that I don't have to say "Just read the manga and ignore the anime." after it ended.

Geez, that look on her face is heartbreaking.
>> ARTICLE
I decided to read the series as it airs. It's interesting to see the different story structure with regards to flashbacks and exposition. I guess it remains to be seen if one is more successful than the other.  

EDIT: Actually, it's interesting that the anime gets to have 2 distinct voice actors - makes inner thoughts a whole lot easier to work with because there's a clear distinction between the two.

I started to do that too but I got carried away and spoiled myself for the first half of this episode.  I'll personally wait and read the manga at the very end when it finishes airing because I can't resist reading ahead.

So losing the ice-skating race affects Hinazuki because she wanted MC to win, which is the same mistake MC made before. Could this minor event have some sort of butterfly effect that leads up to the murder?
>> ARTICLE
It's not that she wanted him to win, it's that he lied to her. Since he let the other kid win, he was lying about going as fast as he could. That's where Kayo's "You said you would never lie to me," and "It doesn't matter, we're both fakes and liars," lines come from.
>> ARTICLE
Losing the ice skating race seemed to mean MC was doing the same actions as he did years ago. Implying nothing will change and Hinazuki would end up dead. That scene was to show that the MC made no progress towards his goal in the overall picture. This however was rectified by the ending scene of the tree, in which the MC mentions this time he saw it together with Hinazuki. Its signifying that MC has taken deviations from his past experience and will hopefully prevent Hinazuki from dying.

First off a deciduous tree cannot be a Christmas Tree it has to be coniferous.

Second I think the mystery might have already been solved but now we just have to figure out how to save her, which will be REALLY REALLY difficult. I'm glad all of the adults in this series aren't incompetent, and at least the teacher is trying, unfortunately that IS just how social services work.

Second, that last second shot right before the ED had me yelling that the episode wasn't allowed to end. I mean what the heck was that?!

ED is really good actually, not sure if I will keep on listening to it during the sessions but not bad

My only complaint with this series is I want to see it all NOW!
>> ARTICLE
Doing some theorizing, manga readers pls dont confirm or deny anything:

The teacher was on screen for a single cut and I am immediately suspicious. The way they frame him in the shadow cast by the window frame, while Satoru stand in the light. Also who divulges all those secrets to a child?

Something that also struck me is how *old* Yuuki looked as a 41 y/o deathrow inmate. The murderer in episode 1 clearly did not look that old. They made sure to note the ages of both Yuuki and the Teacher. Implying neither where the killer in the present.

Would suggest one of the children then is the culprit now. And that ominous scene at the end gives us our prime suspect.

I feel as though We're being lead to believe these things, and there are more twists on the way. But, regardless of the outcome, I am enjoying the journey. Nothing is solved yet and I want more!
>> ARTICLE
Adults and authority are pretty suspicious in this story because they are the ones holding all the actual information about the kids. So anyone who can time kidnappings would be someone who has information about addresses, habits and routines.
>> ARTICLE
>Would suggest one of the children then is the culprit now. And that ominous scene at the end gives us our prime suspect.

This is a possibility since 18 years have passed. But the problem would be the motive. Why would a kid want to kill 3 kids and then 18 years later kill Satoru's mother? 


>The way they frame him in the shadow cast by the window frame, while Satoru stand in the light.

You mean in the OP? Yeah I'm getting suspicions but at the same time it feels like this showing is baiting the teacher at us while giving us more hints. Another factor we gotta look into is that in the opening we see Kenya, Koya's mom, the teacher, and the pizza people with their eyes blacked over. Are they suspects? What importance do these guys play?


Anyway I want more too! Everything about the show is well-done; OP, ED, visuals, music, characters, and more. 



>> ARTICLE
Here's my theory:
Satoru isn't the only one who experiences revival. Kenya does, too. He seems smarter than all the other kids because he, like Satoru, is really an adult. Either Kenya is the killer, and he was brought back to fifth grade to stop Satoru from finding out who he is, or he's somehow involved with the killer/connected to Kayo's death and wants to keep her dead. Or maybe he's not connected to the killer at all. I don't know. He just seems smarter than everyone else to me in the same way that Satoru is (except adult Kenya is smarter than adult Satoru).
>> ARTICLE
[**Who is it?**]( 	#dontdometh)

Literally my mind is is shambles over who is the killer/murderer.

**Was it not a murder and Satoru will unintentionally cause these series of events to happen again?** 

Based off the skating contest, Satoru's attempt to change the past may have caused this entire series of events to happen? 

**Is the teacher the killer?** 

He is 29 in this case, and considering the kidnappings were all 10-11 year olds (probably the same grade then) it would make sense. It wouldn't be far fetched as he would be 49(?) in the present period of the story and Satoru's mother would recognize him (but not immediately).


**What is with the choice of music near the end with the teacher and Kenya? Is it implying that they know something now?**

Oh and I love the OP/ED. Stuff is the bomb this season. 

>> ARTICLE
I don't suspect the teacher nor her family nor Yuuki. Kenya might play an important role somehow since he gets pretty unique scenes in each episode.

I think the kidnapper has yet to appear in the series.
>> ARTICLE
Kenya might be related to the kidnapper perhaps. Something about his thought processes is unnerving. Maybe his way of thinking is shaped by adults who shaped him that way.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he might've some relative who's been in jail or some shady guy.

I'd rather not make any guesses because I just want to enjoy this anime we've been handed down after such a long long time.
>> ARTICLE
I actually do suspect the teacher at this point.
>> ARTICLE
I do too but it feels like the show is just baiting us away while foreshadowing the actual killer(?).


All I know is that the killer is probably in his 30s-50s, Satoru's mother knows him, and he may have some connection (or be) to the attempted kidnapper back in episode 1 (they showed him in the van when Satoru and co. were walking back to the house).
>> ARTICLE
[Here's an album of the major shots where the killer and kidnapper appear.](http://imgur.com/a/s33uw) I'm still not sure if they are the same person since they seem to be presented differently (e.g. kidnapper appears to have slight hair growth above the lip and bushier hair) but not so different that they couldn't be the same person with a little difference in grooming.

Another thing that caught my attention is that back in episode 1, Satoru's mother seems to come to a realization that she is familiar with the killer/kidnapper in some way. She refers to him as "that man" and then later, during the fateful encounter, notes that she was "right". Between these two events she muses on the state of the investigation and contacts someone, greeting them with "long time no see" as if she hasn't seen them for a while, possibly since the original events in question. Someone either she knew in passing from the time or directly through the investigation?

Maybe the teacher, but equally someone actually involved in the investigation perhaps? We see her in this episode talking to a couple of [suited](http://i.imgur.com/4LhhLXQ.png) [questioners,](http://i.imgur.com/E6KdNp2.png) who I assume are part of the police/authorities investigating.

The fact that the kidnapper is seen shortly after the attempted abduction would seem to indicate that he knew something was way off and... well... pick your poison. He knew something was off as he swiftly abandoned the attempt. Did he recognize Satoru's mother? Did he start following her immediately? Did he for some reason already know exactly who she and Satoru were and where to find his residence? If so, HOW? If the kidnapper and murderer are actually two people, was he tipped off that Satoru's mother was on to something? Perhaps because they heard it direct from her themselves (the phone call)?

Also, [teach](http://i.imgur.com/L0moAe7.png) is also being presented rather shadily. He had suspicions that Hinazuki was being abused, he says. OK, so he doesn't act on it in time and bad things happen, I can buy that. But why would that NOT come out in the investigation following her going missing and the eventual discovery of her body? You'd think that would be a big old fucking stinky herring. Why is he confiding in a 10yo? These things bug me.
>> ARTICLE
>It's the teacher

I fucking knew it, that was so obvious

I fucking knew it, it was a giant bait the whole time.


>> ARTICLE
Look man I just wanna acknowledge everything while taking it with a grain of salt at the same time.


But yeah those are my go-to responses.
>> ARTICLE
I can't help but feel that they are setting up Kenya to be the killer or at least setting him up as a red herring. He has a red tint to his eyes in some scenes just like the killer has red eyes and that final pull in at the end with him talking to the teacher was off putting to say the least.

Another thing to note is that the abusive mother had red eyes in certain cuts as well as the father when he was watching tv so the red eyes might just be a style choice to reflect when someone doing something horrendous.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, those scenes with Kayo and her mom were hard to watch
>> ARTICLE
Seeing Kayo beaten up in a shed laid a 1 tonne block of ice straight on top of my chest. Her mother drowning her in cold water added anither one. And then there was the classroom incident. Holy shit.

The ending melted it away though. If I ever decide to become a magical girl, my wish is a happy ending for these two kids.

I wonder why the mother/boyfriend weren't major suspects when Kayo went missing. The teacher clearly suspected them and they seem like questionable people to me.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they were, but it just wasn't publicly announced. At the time Satoru didn't care about Kayo that much. 
>> ARTICLE
I hope they were legitimate suspects. They seem way more suspicious than Yuuki at this point.
>> ARTICLE
True that. I feel like there's a lot of misdirection going around who is the killer. 
>> ARTICLE
>I do wonder how she managed to convince the Child Services otherwise. Those bruises are huge.

As I gathered, the Child Services never got to see Kayo. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Kayo and her mother were always out of the house, when they came around. I don't know if that's luck, or she knows someone on the inside, who is helping her, which would be disgusting.
>> ARTICLE
I think either the father is connected to the CHild services or the teacher...
>> ARTICLE
OK, lemme say something. Don't tell me whether I'm right or wrong.

Every time Child Services came around, Kayo and that bitch would be out of the house.

Now, assuming that Child Services drops in unnoticed to check, reason being that they do not want the parents/guardians to put on a fake front, knowing someone on the inside would be likely.

Now, why is Sensei telling a 10 year old kid this? Isn't this information confidential? How come he isn't surprised when MC tells him that he's seen the abuse going on?

And the Sensei could just ask a female teacher to check on Kayo for her bruises. Sure, she could dismiss it as a fall, but when they start to appear frequently, you'd suspect something, right? Then again, would that be reason enough for CS to take Kayo away while they investigate the bitch?

And "But don't share it with your classmates" just strikes me in the wrong way.

Sensei, Sensei, you're now on my suspicious persons list. You don't just tell your student that his classmate is being abused.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the huge breach in Kayo's confidentiality made me super uncomfortable. Realistically, from the teacher's point of view, he's telling a 10-year-old detailed information regarding a borderline-criminal investigation into a classmate's abuse. What exactly is he even expecting Satoru to do with this information? He's a *child*. It's super creepy in all regards. The fact that he was even willing to tell Satoru Kayo's birthday after he was caught snooping kinda weirded me out, although this is probably because I'm involved in the medical field and confidentiality is super important.

Still, it seems like way too many hints are being dropped pointing at the teacher, which makes me think he's a red herring. Kayo's mother's boyfriend seemed a bit suspicious, although the fact that he's complicit in her abuse might be what's setting me off. :/

Edit: I accidentally a word.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck the mom! Holy shit. I'm not really sure how Child Services can't seem to talk to her. So she's managed to be out 3 times. You're telling me they've only tried 3 times in a year? Show up in the middle of the night or something. Fuck her sleep schedule. 

I can't wait to see where this show goes next. Screw it, I just wanna know how it ends! Please come faster, end of season.
>> ARTICLE
That was a heavy episode.
>> ARTICLE
This is my favorite show of the season so far.

The only thing on my mind is will he end up saving the girl or will she still die and if she does die can he save that shut in that was given the death penalty at the very least.

Oh and my bet is on the teacher being the killer. The girls are all around the age he teaches and being a teacher he would be able to single out students and gather info on them without raising any flags. If this is the case I hope he tries grooming the MC to be a killer and that is how he gets caught. Since the MC is technically an adult he wouldn't be easy tricked by his teacher.

Either way I can't wait for the next episode.

Also I'm sot sure if it's the mother that's beating her it could be the father. I base that one when the mother is dunking her head telling her that the face needs to heal before Monday because she doesn't want people blaming her.

I like that the show never directly calls attention to it, but you still know that she's used that as an excuse/cover up in the past.

I can feel the rage flowing through me as that pathetic excuse of a parent drowned her daughter in fucking ice-cold water in fucking winter.

I am utterly disgusted and appalled by this act of cruelty.

I'm so glad that Sensei(and the staff) actually knew what was going on, it would be totally unrealistic for a teacher of modern times to not notice signs of abuse. For example, me. After I was whacked by my dad(resulted in burst blood vessel in the left eye and bruises all over my face and body, long story), I was closely monitored by my teachers throughout high school(i'm using 'Murican terms) for months after that. They were surprised that it happened, considering that I was generally well-mannered. Kept asking me questions from time to time regarding my home situation and how things are between my dad. It kinda got annoying after 4 months. My dad and I are cool now tho. We chill.

...anyway I sidetracked for a bit.

I wanted MC to throw some remarks at Kayo's female parent. Or throw a punch. But that would be unrealistic for a 10 year old, even for an anime.

Holy shit, she makes my blood boil.

Next week can't come soon enough, huh.
>> ARTICLE
This might well be the best-directed anime show that I've ever seen. Tomohiko Ito - the director - has some solid credits to his name like Silver Spoon, SAO (which had great editing and shot composition regardless of what you think of the shitty, shitty story), and Occult Academy. But the biggest thing he's bringing to the fore in ERASED is his experience working as Assistant Director on The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and Summmer Wars. He has clearly picked up some shit from Mamoru Hosoda (the film reel representation of satoru's power being the most obvious) but if you look at shots like those foxes, Hosoda's influence is super clear. The wonder of childhood is something that both directors knock the fuck out of the park.

At the same time, though, he has his own distinctive style - a certain cold bleak outlook that especially permeates the best-shot scenes of SAO - that also comes into play in the stark, weirdly beautiful way he presents things like kayo's abuse, or sachiko's murder. And when it comes to less gruesome subject matter, when Satoru breaks through that first barrier to kayo in the park (with the tree between them).

A lot of people are saying that this show will live or die on its ending, but to me (unless there's a serious dip in production value between now and then) its already proven itself to be an excellently-made show. Whether the mystery reaches a satisfying conclusion or not is the difference between a 9 and a 10.

Good God. This is probably the greated anime I've seen since Uchouten Kazoku... and at the rate it's going it might be my number one by season's end.

Satoru is just such a genuinely good person. It's almost unbelievable but the way it's told he seems like he could be a real person. 

The sheer indignation and helplessness of being able to recognize such an 'adult' problem as abuse, but being unable to actualyl /do/ anything about it is just heartbreaking.

This episode was another 10/10 for me. And that end scene with Satoru's friend talking to the teacher. From the OP, I'm not really sure whether or not this is gonna end good or bad. 
>> ARTICLE
I am totally completely in love with this show.

The childhood romance has got me so hooked, it's something my inner 10 year old has always wanted but never knew.

Even the little stories like where he's worried about winning the race get me so entranced...This show is honestly so nice and refreshing
>> ARTICLE
I'm honestly surprised at how much more /r/anime likes this anime than /r/manga liked the manga.  Definitely was an underrated manga, but at least the anime is getting the love.
>> ARTICLE
And despite having all this foreknowledge, we're quickly reminded how powerless he is as Kayo's mom casually knocks him down with one hand. 
>> ARTICLE
Kayo's mom reminds me of Teppei from Higurashi.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone have a wallpaper version of the tree?
>> ARTICLE
So...one of Satoru's friends was also murdered, and there was a specific scene in this episode where we see her (him? idk) on the stairs alone asking to walk home with Satoru. Like...I'm curious as to why he hasn't even mentioned this specific fact yet. Has he completely forgotten? I feel like this is going to involve him making a big mistake. Maybe he is misremembering the order in which they were murdered? 
>> ARTICLE
Gonna take a wild guess that kidnapper and killer are two different people. We don't have enough information to point out the killer, but the kidnapper seems to point towards the teacher. The mom recognized the kidnapper and he already knew about Kayo's situation. I'm not sure it's actually possible, but perhaps he wanted to take advantage of Kayo by removing her from her parents to get to her. The last scene between Kenya and the teacher seems to be the teacher trying to manipulate Kenya, I have no reason to believe Kenya to have any ill intention. I think Satoru's mother is a testament to the fact that potentially old people won't look as old as you think they would, which then would qualify the teacher as the kidnapper. Just a little speculation, I think the OP has a lot of subtle spoilery elements which won't become apparent til later.
>> ARTICLE
No one is going to mention the foxes? If I were them I would be scared as shot and run the dick away. Who knows what they'll do to you. This isn't a Disney film dammit! It really felt out of place. The angle of the camera when it did the tree shot with the "up -skirt" felt off.

Interesting to notice is that Satoru didn't beat the mother up since he understood that if he were a kid he wouldn't understand what happened to her and would question the mother as he did. Nicely done so far that he sees things in an adult perspective hasn't been forgotten about. 
>> ARTICLE
so I'm only halfway through the episode, but I just realized what movie/book this reminds me of...

Let Me In/Let The Right One In

It's got tons of the same elements, from the ice-skating, dunking underwater, supernatural stuff, and just the overall creepy/nostalgic vibe. I love it!
>> ARTICLE
Seriously? 12 episodes? The anime surreal right now, and while I don't know anything about the source material, we all know how rushed 1 cour anime can get. Hopefully the mystery is short yet satisfying enough to continue the (stupidly high) quality of this anime.
>> ARTICLE
These are the kind of shows that make me think "God I love anime" 
>> ARTICLE
I barely have words to describe how stunningly good this series is.
>> ARTICLE
This series is an astounding example of cinematography and sound. Everything so far has been exhilarating where 20 odd minutes of screen time per episode feels less than 10 minutes. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit man, that teacher just Is so goddamn suspicious to me....wouldn't be surprised if he was the killer
>> ARTICLE
This is easily AOTS, it is currently taking serious restraint on my behalf not to read the manga.

Question for manga readers- is the manga currently ongoing or finished, basically are these 12 episodes likely to adapt the whole thing?
>> ARTICLE
it is ongoing. GOOD NEWS THOUGH, the manga will finish alongside the anime, with the CANON ending.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the manga, so i'm just going off stuff i've heard. But according to others, the manga is still ongoing, but the mangaka has told the studio the ending, so the anime and manga will have the same one. I don't know if it'll adapt everything, or if it'll skip some stuff though.
>> ARTICLE
any one know how many episodes this anime is due for? its fucking amazing and its only the third episode
>> ARTICLE
When I saw her school bag on the floor my heart died... that scene was the embodiment of heart-wrenching. And the contrast, their nice walk to the 'christmas' tree, was so stark and nice that I couldn't help but tear up (though ye the ducts are being weird lately)
>> ARTICLE
If the MC fails his task and the girl dies I'm going to be very upset.
>> ARTICLE
Only when the show ends and my shoulder muscles relax I realise how anxious and cramped I feel watching that show. I don't remember ever having such a crushing sensation watching something.
>> ARTICLE
Yup that ending wasn't creepy at all /s
>> ARTICLE
This episode felt like it was at most 10 minutes long. I love the direction in the show. It also has great voice acting and animation. Looking forward to the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
I see a weird foreshadowing when the teacher was first introduced and when his friend was shown at the end of the episode. I feel like the teacher might have been the murderer and the friend knows something that Satoru doesn't and it's pivotal to the plot. Anyone has any theories?
>> ARTICLE
Nice to know the school system actually noticed Hinazuki's beatings. Kinda stupid that they tried interviewing her parents 3 times only to fail and be too late to save her. Makes me wonder if the teacher ended up living with regret that he let one of his students die for being to passive in the original timeline. Anyways, cool episode, sucks seeing child abuse, sucks seeing how hard it is to help someone suffering from child abuse, but the christmas tree in February scene was nice, and yet sort of random as well. Like why walk into the mountains in the middle of nowhere just to show an icy tree? It makes for a  pretty scene but still felt really random.
>> ARTICLE
If he doesn't save that adorable little girl's life, I'm going to be very sad. That last scene where she smiles actually made me smile too. The characters here are so well done. This is definitely my favorite show of the season.
>> ARTICLE
Its amazing how good this Anime is so far. 

In this single episode it managed to make me feel Sick to my stomach after the child abuse scene, hatred at that little brat in the classroom and then just overwhelming joy at the Christmas tree scene.

I think we have a true masterpiece in the making right here.
>> ARTICLE
3 episodes, and it has managed to be incredible for all the seconds it has in each episode. This show is incredible with the emotions it causes.I felt incredibly pissed, sick, at that scene. I never expected her to be in such a horrible state, and then that fucking bitch. Mother of the Year indeed. And the worst is... well how real it feels compared to the other 3 contenders.

But then it turned from sour to so sweet and beautiful. It was incredible.
>> ARTICLE
Child beating? Well, fuck...
>> ARTICLE
Is there any doubt the teacher's the culprit? It looks like he targets vulnerable kids, and he's someone MC's mother would recognize (as she does in ep1). 
>> ARTICLE
All in all, this may go up to be in my top 5 ever
>> ARTICLE
I want to see Hinazuki's mother *suffer*.
>> ARTICLE
Another great episode, such pain and joy.

I'm wondering if the red eyes is actually someone with a more powerful revival ability that allows them to jump not only back in time, but from person to person. Not sure what their aims are though.

I'm also wondering if all the parents knew about the abuse and it was covered up, Saturo's mother gave the impression there was some sort of secret shame they kept hidden from the children.
>> ARTICLE
This show is magical.
>> ARTICLE
Gets even darker with the abuse and stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Jesus christ... This is the kind of anime that shows anime is not DEFINITELY only for kids. That scene with her laying in the shed. God damn..
>> ARTICLE
It's scary how this show feels like absolute perfection in every matter to me. Please don't stop.
>> ARTICLE
I knew it since last march...
That's a year... a year ... year!!!
Unless the teacher is actually the murderer: WHAT THE FUCK have you ben doing for a YEAR knowing that a Girl in your class gets physically abused by her mother. Holly shit fire that guy 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe its the aspect ratio but it definitely feels like watching a movie. The quality of animation and the narrator's VA is just too good.

Would have made for an amazing binge watch but it's too late for me, i'm addicted and need my weekly fix.
>> ARTICLE
This show, guys. THIS. SHOW. DAY-UM.

It's great. The cleanliness of the execution, the impressive character animation, the story that draws you in and doesn't let you go, all of it. Even more impressive, it's done this for three straight episodes. I think I'm in love.


>> ARTICLE
Kenya is too suspicious to me. In the previous episodes, its understandable that he is probably very skilled in reading body language and facial expression, but every time he notices something about Satoru, it's precise. How long has Satoru had the ability to manipulate time? Has Kenya figured that out? 

Not only that, he's a bit too mature for how old he is. It makes sense for Satoru but not Kenya. I wonder how much Kenya knows and what he's hiding.
>> ARTICLE
A mark of a good piece of entertainment is that it is able to cause people to feel emotions that aren't "oh my god this is shit". These emotions could be happiness, sadness, amusement, fear, and occasionally *divine fury*.

It is the last of those five which I feel towards the *pieces of human garbage* who have the sheer nerve to call themselves Kayo's parents, despite treating her worse than an animal. Fuckin' pieces of shit.
>> ARTICLE
i bet he got his powers from kenya or something, that kid seems to be as intelligent and mature as the main character.


>> ARTICLE
This show just keeps getting better and better, the scene where they look at the Christmas tree with the response of Hinazuki that it's Februari was adorable. Hope Hinazuki situation will get better. For the rest, I can't wait to see the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
I live for scenes similar to when Fujinuma shouted at that bratty kid. Shitty people need to be put in their place, and it feels so good. 

Although, she is a kid so it's okay :)
>> ARTICLE
I got really hooked after the first two episodes (watched them consecutively) and started reading the manga. I've never read a manga, even after watching some 1500 hours worth of anime (60,2 days says MAL). This really called for me, so I just had to start reading the manga, because this has all the elements I usually love in an anime: good & interesting characters, cruel and sad themes, but also happiness and joy. ALSO time travel which I love. (Now try to guess my favourite anime.) Over a few days I've now read 13 chapters of the manga, and oh boy, what a ride it has been.

The scale of emotions the manga/anime puts me through is huge. The adaptation is awesome too, I really like the art style, the VAs, and even the music is good. The 3D animation at the scene this episode where her back bag was on the ground was a little ugly, but otherwise I've loved the audiovisuals. Amazing series, and I'm very happy to have stumbled upon this.

Is it too early to say AOTS? Maybe, given that I haven't started any other series as of yet, but if something is going to best this, I'm genuinely surprised. The other option would be for this to go down a huge downhill, that would be sad.
>> ARTICLE
The killer and the teacher have the same hair and hair color. But I think he would be too old in the present timeline to be him :s Also kinda odd how the teacher just spills all the beans.
>> ARTICLE
The contrast between Hinazuki being abused and the scene at Christmas tree is so well done that i ended clapped my hand slowly. It bring such a strong impact to my soul that i feel sorry for Hinazuki's life. She is just a girl, leave her alone pls she is suffering too much for a kid T.T
>> ARTICLE
I love it. This is my favourite show for the season I guess. 

The Christmas tree scene was amazing and felt *real*, not far-fetched and Kayo on the floor, beaten, and her mother's actions made me feel really sick. 

But I also appreciated the skating race scene! We can believe that if we could go back to the past, we'd be able to do everything right, but we'll be repeating some mistakes, because that's who we are. 
>> ARTICLE
i would like to apologize to /u/painn23 and several others for initially dismissing this show.

This show is good.

i was wrong.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god, I was going to just skip this series completely.  It didn't seem to be up my alley.  Wow, I am glad I didn't, this is one of the best shows I've seen years.
>> ARTICLE
Snot nose brat. Trying to frame Hinazuki for taking the money. The look on her face when Satoru started yelling...that was priceless. I was actually thinking that he would punch her. Ahhh it felt so good to see her cry xD
>> ARTICLE
Annnnd I've read all of the manga after this episode... guys we are in for a treat.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone notice that the teacher is always in the shadow?
>> ARTICLE
has anyone played life is strange game? The story is quiet similar and so far it seems like it might be the same plot..almost. 
>> ARTICLE
somehow, I can't help but suspect their sensei
>> ARTICLE
Who was that guy the teacher was talking to in the end ? Was it the student who seems he has it all together or was it an adult ?
>> ARTICLE
It was Kenya, the smart kid from the MCs group of friends.
>> ARTICLE
Smart kids/students are so threatening in this story, now I  realize it.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting that his eyes are hidden and that there is suspenseful music playing as they zoom in on him.

I wonder what Kenya's role will be in the upcoming episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I'm wondering if the teacher decided to tell Kenya about the abuse, they always mention how smart he is, the teacher would know that. Telling him might help a lot.
>> ARTICLE
It just seems strange as they are meeting way past school hours, the music was quite ominous, and the way they hid Kenya's eyes (there were angles last episode where they looked red).
>> ARTICLE
Just to note, Yuuki also had red eyes in a scene.
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention that there have been plenty of obvious shots of Kenya staring at the MC like he knows something is up.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit the author of the manga is insanely talented.  
If the quality keeps up like these 3 episodes, this may even become one of my favourite anime. No anime has made me feel so happy and shit at the same time. 
>> ARTICLE
Director Itou Tomohiko, why are you doing this to me again? The last time was when I caught up your Sword Art Online's first season, just after the Aincrad arc ended, and the wait each week for the next episode was physically painful. We're not there yet, probably because I haven't marathoned this show, but dammit, do we really have to wait an entire week for the next episode? Fie! Foul and fie!

Anyway, this episode was really good, once more. Yuki Kaijura's music is the most similar to Madoka than all of her other soundtracks, especially as Satoru walked away from Yuuki Jun's place, with the air of impending dread it has given. Direction, such as when Satoru came upon the beaten Kayo, and then as she left him in the distance, was very good, again. Yuuki Aoi's voice acting, fully dialed back, just complements some of the shots very well. I mean, [just look at this shot](http://i.imgur.com/vnnOFVN.jpg), look at it, and listen.

Of course, as a liar and a fake, Kayo wants someone to be real with her, with whom she could be real, but is Satoru that person, can he be? He called a second girl a brat in as many episodes, which should make sense, because as he himself kept reminding us, he's 29, but surrounded by a bunch of 10-11 year olds. But is he really 29, mentally, or is his maturity just a mantle he put on, as was expected on him? Yuuki Jun, his older friend called him mature for the way he put on his coat, not for anything deeper than that.

But let's look at the other meaningful scene in this episode, the most meaningful one, that is, after him coming upon the beaten Kayo, when he threw the race. Did he make a "mistake"? He was just true to his nature, a nature that has him erase himself from the scene, which has him pull back into the background. The same way he is as an adult. In other ways, he was frozen in time after Kayo's disappearance and Jun's arrest, and he never really grew up. He's an 11 year old kid trapped in a 29 year old's body, who's now trapped in the 11 year old kid's body again.

It's time to grow up, and time to look towards the future, which is the hope he gave Kayo, and the one he has for himself, and for her.

I was shaking with rage when he found Hinazuki in the shed. And then the reveal that her father(?) is also in the picture. The fact that I'm this affected by a character I've known for 2 episodes is a testament to the excellent storytelling so far. It just grips you with the awesome OP and doesn't let you go for the next 20 mins. And I'm no advocate of violence against women but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want Satoru to rock that little girl. This show is making me feel things.

The red herrings were also abundant in this episode, especially that final shot with teacher-kun and Kenya. I suspect him less now. At this point, I think it's one of her parents, maybe the dad.
>> ARTICLE
Its not her Dad its her Mums boyfriend (Stepdad at worst). 
>> ARTICLE
Love the OP but this episode was tough to stomach :( Poor Hinazuki it's so sad that not only is her mom the f*cking worst her classmates treat her poorly too so she has no escape. The Christmas tree scene was so gorgeous though and the episode flowed so well this show is like an extremely well paced film but it goes by so quickly...I'm so excited for next week!
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit this anime. Fuck Kayo's mum and her boyfriend(?) fuck that little girl for framing Kayo and goddamnit I just want to hug Kayo and take her as far away from her shitty family as is possible. From the scene where Kayo is found in the shed until the absolutely beautiful end of the episode I was crying on and off. 


I couldn't hold back my tears at the part where Satoru finds Kayo in the shed and when her fucking piece of shit mum dunked her in ice water so that people wouldn't notice that she beat her. When the little girl blamed Kayo I just wanted to punch her. GO!! Satoru for standing up for Kayo and then at the end when they go look at the tree and Satoru says that they'll see it together in summer again I couldn't hold back my tears just because it was so sweet and beautiful and just ahhhhhh. Kayo's smile is so sweet and it breaks my heart that she has to suffer through all that pain and loneliness.

MAN!! THE FEELS IN THIS EPISODE!

I'm also curious about what Kenya was doing with the teacher at the end of the episode, holy shit I need to have the next episode.

I'm loving this anime more and more each episode but the middle of this episode was so damn hard to watch...
>> ARTICLE
Aside from everyone else's comments about the incredible direction, beautiful shots, voice acting, etc... The music direction in this episode was SOOOO GOOD! Those scenes of despair with the mother were made that much more heart wrenching because of the twisted music playing. I'm so impressed with how all these components have come together. 

I'm not holding my tongue though, I've learned through other let downs not to make so many assumptions of a show as a whole this early^zankyounoterror^tokyoghoul^aldnoahzero...

Well it's just so enjoyable as the way it is now which is exactly how it should be! 
>> ARTICLE
I am so sure the teacher is the culprit. Although age remains a barrier, until now he's the most likely to be the one. Has the info, acts shady as hell, and now that shot at the end...
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit that shed scene, in retrospect it's not a huge surprise or anything but damn. While I want this to be great I've been keeping my expectations low, expecting quality to drop so I'm not disappointed but this show just keeps delivering.

At this point if the quality stays at this level I think it could easily be anime of the year in my book.
>> ARTICLE
This is the first time that I didn't pause an episode of anime because of boredom or a cringy moment, but because of how fucking amazing it was. That scene where Hinazuki gets blamed for stealing, fucking gold.
>> ARTICLE
I have a strong feeling we'll come to want to punch that teacher in the face, as well as the little kid who keeps acting maturely, soon enough.
>> ARTICLE
I'm calling it. I think the killer is definitely the teacher. He just feels suspicious to me. Plus, he is in the op but so far doesn't seem like he plays an important role unless he is the killer.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, this show cuts you down to the core.

I never would have guessed how much this show would affect me, it is absolutely fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
A-1 Pictures have the veterans on this, the animation is fantastic. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm calling it now, the teacher is the villain! It always is
>> ARTICLE
This is one of those shows where every moment has me hoping/praying/wishing for good things to happen because I know at any second things can go totally downhill. 

Satoru getting Kayo to smile was such an uplifting moment. But for some reason even if Satoru is successful and saves Kayo I feel like we won't get the "fairy tail" ending here. It just doesn't seem like that kind of show. The future will be changed: how does that changed Airi's role, for example?
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap, didn't even know this got an anime adaptation...if it brings 1/10th of the emotion and suspense the manga has, it will easily be the best anime of the season.
>> ARTICLE
I dont know if anyone else noticed this Himizuki and her parents have red eyes. The person that killed his mom also had red eyes. 

>> ARTICLE
This is no bullshit, I think this easily may become my new favorite anime of all time. Every single scene got me filled with emotions, may it be hatred, sadness or joy. It seems just too perfect.. Please A-1, don't screw this potential masterpiece up.
>> ARTICLE
I tried to post a video review saying this exact thing and it got downvoted to hell. Anyway. Full agreement! This show is just too good. 
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling this show is going to have me bawling my eyes out by the end...I'm not prepared for this!
>> ARTICLE
Judging by the scenes in the OP, I think there is a lot more to this than finding out the killer. I'm getting the feeling that this is another one of those "One must die in order to save the other" shows because the OP is setting a lot of attention on the [co-worker](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TPrf7T37ikc/hqdefault.jpg) from the first episode as well as kayo and his mother.
I could be wrong but just putting it out there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just gonna put this out there right now just because I got a weird feeling about him...the teacher is the real killer.
>> ARTICLE
The episode was really done well. It gave a really dark feeling during the dark scene such as Kayo getting beat up by her mother, but it was also able to give the vibe of happiness for the characters like the scene of the Christmas Tree. Seeing Kayo smile felt nice. Also, the animation was great, specially the tree scene with all the stars. 
I'm loving the mystery though. That scene at the end makes me want to see more. This show is good for predictions and such. (To those who hasn't read the manga anyway.) Could the teacher be the killer? Because the show makes obvious stills on the teacher yet making it obvious might be a trick, making us think he's the killer, but not. I dunno, just gotta' wait and watch.
>> ARTICLE
This episode broke my heart. Loved the ending though 
>> ARTICLE
Only certain shows can make me feel heavily uncomfortable, extremely angry and then almost make me tear. This episode did that
>> ARTICLE
This show so far has done an amazing job at leaving you *juuuuuuust* at the right moment at the end of every episode to make you want more. 

This series is just amazing and its great to see A-1 actually seemingly put more effort into the entire series animation then the end of asterisk in its bigger moments. (If its fair to compare them) 
>> ARTICLE
I've never called a show AOTS before as far as I know but holy shit this might just be the first one.

I've said this before but it's that adult Satoru being able to react/respond to his surroundings and situations as a kid that's a great kicker. I mean who wouldn't find it satisfying to just blurt out your older self's thoughts like that as a child? Incompetent gov't agency? Bitch in class? It seems so tiny but I find it satisfying.

And the events this episode... just fucked up, man. So there's a chance that it wouldn't be some outsider that would abduct and kill Kayo because her parents are monsters.

I'm still at a loss for words in trying to describe how freakin' great every episode has been so far. That "Christmas" tree scene warmed my heart even after all what was shown.
>> ARTICLE
Best episode so far, but it seems a little rushy. Maybe it's only me, but it probably feels like that because time's running out.


There was a lot covered this episode, but there are still a lot of things that are still not uncovered from the OP.



My guess is that the teacher is the person who killed MC's mom. Not sure why. Maybe it's a pattern that an obscure but somewhat important character is usually the killer.  

Random bullshitting aside, I hope next episode will be as good as this one :D

>> ARTICLE
I've literally been counting down days until a new episode. Can't get enough of this. I wish everyday was thursday, I really do.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so glad at least **someone** had noticed before.
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling that teacher is the murderer to be honest. The murderer is someone who knew mc's mother and this fits well. Also, he was talking to some kid at the end. However, this is a much too easy conclusion and seeing how the show's going I have a feeling that it is not him or mc's adult friend as they are much too obvious choices. 
>> ARTICLE
Each episode is a truly beautiful mini movie I'd say.

Without a break in the anime watching this you get to see an emotional roller coaster within every episode so far and I'm sure in the future.

Watching this give me shivers both of joy and sadness, when they shared they beautiful mountain scene and Hinazuki let's out smile i almost teared up from the pure happiness i got from it.

I'm seeing an anime with quality I've never seen in all my time watching anime, feelings I've never felt so strongly before, this is what makes a masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
This show is AMAZING so far, but the mystery as it is worries me a little bit. Not because of anything that has happened so far, but because of vague stuff I've heard that hasn't spoiled me but has made me cautious. Either way, if the show keeps its quality, it's going to be AOTS, even above Rakugo. Damn, it's good. I love it.

Anyway, *theorizing*. 

Since this is obviously a show that knows its shit, I'm gonna say that the teacher is a red herring. He's overly suspicious. The dark shadows covering his eyes, his sharp, slightly off-putting design (or at least framing), the ominous music in both scenes where he's featured prominently are all things that lend to that. I feel like he does have a role in the murder somehow, however. I strongly feel that child services didn't actually visit Kayo's home. Maybe it'll flip the trope and make it so he actually is the murderer. I'm still slightly suspicious of Yuuki too, just because he's literally the nicest person ever. 

Kenya is just a kid to me at this point in the show. It'd be a big ass pull to have him be a "time traveller" too, because this is mystery first and supernatural last (hopefully). If Kayo is being abused physically, I could see Kenya being abused emotionally, or at least being manipulated, by someone (the teacher, his family, etc). Satoru is probably being monitored in some way. After all, he has connection to two of the victims. This mystery seems to have multiple people involved, in any case. 
  
>> ARTICLE
Maybe yuuki is involved?
>> ARTICLE
imo this episode seemed to have less material than the past 2 episodes, probably because less happened (while in the first he had an intro and time travel, second started his school life) as he only did school stuff, visited, and discovered.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure if this has already been mentioned or not, but if you look closely at the time around 1:12 in the OP (https://youtu.be/Y9G20wV0KHE) you can see a clear reflection of the killer in the shards of glass. Unfortunately I'm not sure I can identify who it is, or if it even is the killer at all.
>> ARTICLE
Great episode...time to patiently wait for next episode.
>> ARTICLE
The visuals of this show have a live-action feel to them and I mean that in a good way. Its really tough to do camera moves and slow-motion believably with 2D animation but this show pulls it off seamlessly. Examples include the slow-mo when he let Hamada win the race, the low-angle rotating shot of the tree, and the dolly backwards shot that had Hinazuki frame left walking with her mom away from Satoru who was frame right, constantly getting smaller and further away.    
>> ARTICLE
mood after watching: askjhfakjwhfkjha.
I almost cried when she said she fell! 
Also, the scene at the end was beautiful. She smiled! 
This story is so compelling. They suck me in every time and I am so invested in these characters, it's insane! I just want to read the manga now because I want to know what happens but I don't want to ruin the suspense of the anime! 
Favorite part is here though https://twitter.com/ChachiXO/status/690326958467461120
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who thought the pace of this anime is exactly American TV Drama style?
>> ARTICLE
I may not be the cleverest person, but I think if I were him, I'd immediately be telling mom, calling the cops, anything.  Get the word out about those shitbag "parents".
>> ARTICLE
Good comments all round, I've gotta start this show
>> ARTICLE
Once again, a great episode. Lots of heart wrenching moments, and once again the directing, music and voice acting are all really strong. I also like that this is one of the few anime that display children as the little shits they are.

Listening to the excellent ending theme it reminded me of the ED of Rampo Kitan: Game of Laplace and it turns out that Sayuri sings both of them, I should probably listen to more of her stuff.

^^^^^^^^^Also ^^^^^^^^^holy ^^^^^^^^^fuck ^^^^^^^^^Hinazuki ^^^^^^^^^Kayo ^^^^^^^^^is ^^^^^^^^^even ^^^^^^^^^hotter ^^^^^^^^^this ^^^^^^^^^episode.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit i am loving this show, Really looking forward to seeing how different it is to the mangoo!
I can't remember the hockey race happening but maybe i missed a chapter...

>> ARTICLE
The teacher seems like the most suspicious to me, though I'm not sure what that ending scene with Kenya was about. On a side note, even though he's not the killer, it's weird as fuck how Yuuki just hangs around kids and even brings them to his house. Does his dad not question it at all?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I thought the same thing. Especially when he said he'd already spoken to Kayo in the park a number of times. I was like, "Dude, what?"
>> ARTICLE
I'm just gonna say: The Pizza Restaurant manager looks a log like Yuuki.I think they might have some relation since they have the same "face aspect"
>> ARTICLE
In the first episode the killer had red eyes that would mean it could be  kayo's parents.
>> ARTICLE
I regret starting this show b/c now I have to wait a week for the next episode... Why can't I just binge watch it???
>> ARTICLE
So I just started watching this show cause I've been hearing great things about it. Just got done with episode 3 and I'm *loving* it so far. It's right up my street - emotionally provocative drama, clean storytelling, great production. Excellent stuff.

While I have no experience of or relation to child abuse, that stuff hits me pretty hard. Seeing Kayo's mother kick Kayo repeatedly was horrible. And then when she met Satoru and lied to his face through a constant smirk...fuck, man. I wanted him to put his fist through her face. After having watched stuff like Clannad, Angel Beats! and Your Lie In April, I'm at least prepared for more tears.

Another thing I adore about this show is that young Satoru has fully retained his adult mind, and that it influences what he says. I like the idea of a kid being more perceptive than they should be. Speaking of which, some people are theorising that Kenya's apparent intelligence is a hint that he *also* experiences "revival". I had a similar theory. 

I mean, it's not even just the indication that he's more perceptive than he should be. Time travel shows like this often like to use the plot point that more than one person is familiar with the phenomenon. If it's not Kenya, it'll be *someone*. But it's likely him. I also agree that Yuuki and the teacher are probably red herrings - their shadiness is much too obvious. Plus, the glimpse we caught of the killer in 2006 as he passes Satoru wasn't really suggestive of either of them, especially the eye colour. 

It's also possible there's more than one person involved in the crimes. In fact, I'd say it's guaranteed. Didn't the dude who Satoru's mother saw in the parking lot have facial hair? I'm not sure the guy Satoru passed had facial hair. She also thought she recognised him from somewhere. 

By the way, what on earth kind of significance could there be to Satoru and Kayo sharing the same birth date?

>> ARTICLE
What a horrible mother.. She was essentially drowning her! That's messed up..Even though she's just an anime character it really makes you think about people who go through similar abuse in real life.

That final scene at the end with sensei and Kenya. There's something up there. I thought of Kenya as suspicious from the moment we saw him. Adding that fishy scene at the end..I don't know if sensei and Kenya are good guys or not.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely think "The Butterfly Effect" will come into play in this one. I'm almost positive he will save Kayo but someone else is going to pay the price for it and I hope to god it's not Airi. My only hope for this series is that he saves Kayo and his Mom and Kayo can be happy in the present times. I don't think there's gonna be a romance between Satoru and Kayo which I don't mind since it's not really an anime that needs a romance. Anyways, Kayo's mam is the biggest cunt in all of anime and I hope she gets what's coming to her. But yeah, I don't see Kayo not being saved but I have a feeling there's gonna be a big price to pay (please not Airi). 

In regards to the big mystery I think Kenya is a red herring, my main suspects are the creepy teacher or someone they know that hasn't been introduced yet. But holy shit, this anime is a fucking masterpiece and easily an AOTY contender. Kayo is the only character that has made me wish it was somehow possible to teleport into anime and give her a hug, poor girl. 

Edit: Also the Live action is out in a few months, might be worth watching that aswell seeing as the anime is so good. 
>> ARTICLE
If sensei turns out to be the killer. I don't know but that last scene just gives me the vibes
>> ARTICLE
Show has been excellent so far. AoTS for me so far. The transition into the slow pace from the first episode was really well done.
>> ARTICLE
I'm definitely suspicious of Kenya the most, especially with that ending part with him and the teacher. 
>> ARTICLE
The polish and professionalism in this show is almost unprecedented.  Great and interesting story, fresh voice acting, AMAZING editing and cinematography.  It's not as flashy and in-your-face as a SHAFT production (not saying that SHAFT is bad, just that it's good that this show has its own style) but it's also enough to give you a feeling of dread in seemingly normal moments.  That's just good directing.

Plus it's really pretty.  Great anime so far.  Loving it.
>> ARTICLE
so many shady characters :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm enjoying the characters and their interactions, but I'm not so sure about how it presented the child abuse. I thought it could have been handled with a more subtly.
But so far I'm enjoying it, even with the time resets.
I unfortunately don't think it will last.
This is A1 pictures we are taking about, and lets be frank, they don't have a great track record. I've heard that the manga goes downhill in the long run, so I'm not so hopeful about the series's future. But, as it is, It's not bad.    
>> ARTICLE
Amazing! Beautiful! The ending of the episode was just breath-taking, but the horrible abuse really brings this series down to a sobering reality of child abuse and neglect. (not to mention future murder) Everything fits so well. Just, Wow!
>> ARTICLE
Calling AOTS right now. Might be one of my top 10, assuming there's no "fuck you read the source" ending.
>> ARTICLE
It will end with the Manga in March.
>> ARTICLE
Good to know. So many awesome anime have been ruined like that.
>> ARTICLE
Why is this so cute, I wasn't expecting that in this time travel mystery. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode definitely solidified this show as being the best new show this season
>> ARTICLE
OH MY GOD WHEN SENSEI ENTERS THE FRAME IN THE SHADOW,
THEN SITS DOWN AND IS IN THE LIGHT. SUCH GOOD DIRECTING.
>> ARTICLE
C'mon, Satoru why don't you tell your mom that one of your classmates seems to be abused?  Or just call police yourself.  You are an 29 yrs old adult inside!  Though I know it will ruin the drama.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really hoping this turns out well for Kayo. Abusive parents always gets my blood boiling.

Wonder what that little moment at the end was about? What's Kenya up too?
>> ARTICLE
Remember the mother killer from episode 1? Why did she recognize him, and why did he have the same hair colour as Kenya?
>> ARTICLE
Why doesn't he just take her home with him and using his 29 yr old brain explain things like how her mom is abusive and protective services is useless and just have her live with them from then on?  It's not like her mom will miss her.
>> ARTICLE
Because that's also a definition of kidnapping. Unforunately children don't have the ability to make choices themselves in the eyes of society, and without exclusive word from bodies which have been granted extrajudicial powers by society, to do precisely what you're saying, most are powerless.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why, but that teacher makes me uneasy. I'm really getting this gut feeling he's the kidnapper/murderer.
>> ARTICLE
HEART WARMING TO GUT WRENCHING ALL DAY LONG ROLLER COASTER I HATE THIS AND LOVE THIS.
>> ARTICLE
It's been a really long time since I got so mad in one episode. Nothing fucks with me more that child abuse. I wanted to do terrible things to Hinzuki's bitch of a mother and cunt of a father.
>> ARTICLE
Hated the mom in the manga, hate her even more now.
>> ARTICLE
This fucking episode. Made me go through a rollercoaster of emotions. That cliff hanger ending.. 
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, this anime is touching on some *heavy* stuff. To say I'm already emotionally invested in the characters and story is an understatement. 
>> ARTICLE
Could someone who knows Japanese help? [What do these say?](http://i.imgur.com/EX6D6Ed.jpg) The middle one starts with the characters "female" and "child" so I was wondering are they just typical eroge or something a  bit more worrying.

He had red eyes too. I know MC doesn't think he did anything but I don't know if I buy that. Something about him just isn't right.

So nothing interesting. 

Thanks though!

I'm really really scared this show's gonna be a tragedy 
>> ARTICLE
Her mom needs to get fucking fucked the mother fucking fuck up. Dip that bitch feet first into a barrel of acid!
>> ARTICLE
What if... it wasn't a murder but an accident? What if these are all red-herrings. One of the children causes an accident, gets the three other children killed and, obviously scared to get in some major trouble, decides to frame the most friendly and kindest guy ever. Just look at the children when the money "went missing", children get angry for the pettiest reasons and pull the stupidest stuff to get revenge without realizing the effect that can have on a person. What if. But then there's also that murderer in the "present", so eh. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, what a show. So much mystery coming from such young subjects. I love the premise, and I can't wait for next week. I am SUPER tempted to read the manga though, but I feel like I shouldn't.
>> ARTICLE
Bullying and child abuse . . . fuck that parent. The satisfaction of seeing Satoru yell at that little shit. Meanwhile Kenya and Sensei are looking suspicious af. 
>> ARTICLE
has noone else noticed that everyone with bad intentions basically has red eyes... the teachers right at the top of the list.
>> ARTICLE
I'm calling it now, it is probably the teacher. 

Also, the way the blonde kid watches from afar in an "all-knowing" way is extremely creepy. Not sure if there's any relevance.
>> ARTICLE
Am i late to this party? Anyone wanna chat about this cause this anime is too amazing. i need people to talk to about it ahahha. pretty sure same emotions and crap like everyone else here.
>> ARTICLE
It really hurts when the episodes end. Best show I've seen in a while so far
>> ARTICLE
Almost as bad as Cascas "don't look". My feels.
>> ARTICLE
That's what it instantly reminded me of too. They were both absolutely heart-breaking and seeing the shame in both faces absolutely killed me. 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone know of any similar anime to this?
>> ARTICLE
It was never so hard not to read the source aka manga....
>> ARTICLE
Calling it, the teacher is the murderer

>> ARTICLE
The quality of the show so far has been top notch across the board, hopefully they stick with it.
>> ARTICLE
this is pretty good
>> ARTICLE
It's the teacher. I can tell.
>> ARTICLE
I so want him to use his knowledge of the future to verbally destroy someone. Imagine if he just turned to the abusive parents and told them all the stuff he knows about them, he probably knows a lot about them due to the investigation.
>> ARTICLE
10/10
>> ARTICLE
Best anime all year. It's meant to become ridiculous though. It would be cool if this was a short anime 12 ep but all 12 where fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
This is the first anime in a loooong time that makes me almost ill that I have to wait a whole week before finding out what happens. I hope everyone is right and this is AOTS, or maybe AOTY. So tired of good beginnings and mediocre middles and ends. Please continue this masterpiece quality. 
>> ARTICLE
Saw this rated highly on MAL (Which btw i don't judge by ratings) it caught my eye was wondering if it's worthwhile watching and what is it similar to. I averted my eyes from spoilers
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't personally find any anime you've watched which is similar to this that I know of.

It's a worthwhile watch, try the first 3 episodes yourself to see if you like it. 

It's a bit like a serious mystery story to put it short.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah my Anime choices have been deemed weird i have tried about 5 of the "Big anime " and not one of them really hooked me i ll give them a chance later on but for now i'd like to explore what i like. Terrible fantasy anime with cute girls
>> ARTICLE
Terrible fantasy anime with cute girls?!

This season is for you.

If you're interested in that category then check out these two animes that are currently airing -

[Hai to Gensou no Grimgar](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31859/Hai_to_Gensou_no_Grimgar)

[KonoSuba](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo)

Edit : You're already watching them but if anybody else has similar taste then they should keep their eyes on those two.
>> ARTICLE
Also watching Gate, these are my first 3 anime i'm watching that are Airing i love binging, yet i love all 3
>> ARTICLE
I'd highly recommend it, at least watch the first episode because that shit was far crazier than anything I was expecting
>> ARTICLE
That last scene though... I knew I was right to be suspicious... And they tried so hard to throw you off, especially with Yuuki.
>> ARTICLE
If Higurashi taught me anything, CCC isn't going to do shit.

who is that guy in the op? on the part that it shows katagiri, kayo and fujinuma mom and old satoru in the background (then changes to the guy I am talking about)
>> ARTICLE
http://screens.muratcansimsek.com/mpv_episode-3-birthmark-691797.png
>> ARTICLE
You guys notice that girl at the stairs saying ''Want to go home together Satoru?'' and he doesn't even notice her and says ''Gotta go''. I bet that he will save Hinazuki but now this girl will end up being killed instead.
>> ARTICLE
its not a girl, its his male friend from his own clique. he is also one of the three victims shown in the magazine in this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I suspect that Kenya was the one that framed Hinazuki when I saw the last scene, not sure where I'm going with this though...
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's actually a valid line of thought considering Kenya told Satoru that he should probably keep his mind on Kayo. Maybe he planted the money on her so that Satoru would have to defend her, making him more appealing to her. It's a fair idea. 
>> ARTICLE
I think that Satoru's missing gloves,  at least in the original time line,  made him the prime suspect and his mother creates a narrative to get the airplane guy nailed for the crime. 
>> ARTICLE
She smiled! There is joy in her life! There is joy in her words!

Man... this show knows how to make you hate certain characters...
>> ARTICLE
Amazing episode, but needed more Mom.

*Yokai*
>> ARTICLE
This is show lives up to the potential I believe anime has as a medium. I'm so happy to see a show tackle these issues, and do it in such an interesting, mature, yet entertaining way. As always, I cant wait for the next episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Too much feelings. Just.TOO.MUCH.
>> ARTICLE
wow, 2300 updoots and 900+ comments?  i guess i need to pick this show up.

I do not know if this show is for everyone, but it is technically the best show I have seen in a long time. Art, music, and feels.

When the foxes ran around them I thought of the Sea Bear Circle...

Many a justice boners were raised that day. This shit is so good. There hasn't been anything this satisfying for me in a long time.

[Seeing Kayo smile after all that shit was so great.](http://i.imgur.com/D61I6w5.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
tfw you realize Satoru actually helped putting the guy in jail by pointing out his accent and the fact that he had pornographic stuff in his shelf, and didn't think it was normal when he was an actual 10 year-old and therefore reported it to the police.

how to emotions 101
>> ARTICLE
Is this going to have any romance development at all?
>> ARTICLE
I dont think anyone has pointed this out yet but... I dont think Kayo's mother is the one actually hitting/doing most of the abuse. In the scene where she was drowning Kayo she says "or they will think I did it!" Before cutting to show the father and his drugs. It seems to me like the father is bashing her while the mother covers up the damage. Im scared for Kayo now because the teacher and MC both think the mother is solely responsible, and if Kayo ends up getting put in the care of only her father by the protective services :( i also think the dad is prime suspect material and im surprised people havent been discussing him at all.
>> ARTICLE
The yellow hair friend defiantly know sth is up with Satoru... i am pretty sure more than 1 of them over there jumps thru time as well.. 
>> ARTICLE
man that abuse scene was really fucked up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E183ifGsVI

>> ARTICLE
Just caught up and just WOW! Awesome series and I'm too excited for the next episode.  I wanted him to punch the mom so hard in the gut lol.  

I recently found a song that perfectly fits this episode and it's been on repeat so hard after I watched this episode.  It's called 7 years by Lukas Graham.

https://youtu.be/LHCob76kigA
>> ARTICLE
lol just change the ages he said. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh Fuck, Oh fuck, oh shit, they in on it, they fucking in on it. Oh my God, oh fuck, what the fuck is gonna happen.
>> ARTICLE
Damn, It's good to have this while GoT and Doctor Who are on break. It's gonna be a pain waiting each week for this...  

Anyway, my thoughts after reading most of the other comments here:  
1. People are suspecting Kenya as the killer. I don't think this is correct because of that scene when MC and Kayo are talking and the camera zooms out to show someone (clearly not a ~10yr old) watching them (ep 2). This person had an airplane, so I think it was likely Yuuki or someone that knows him. I have very little doubt that the this guy is the killer.  
2. Based on what I said in 1), I guess that leaves the Teacher and Yuuki as prime suspects, with Kayo's parents (her dad, really) and some character we have not been explicitly introduced to being secondary. Right now I feel like the end scene has a decent chance of being so sketchy to make the teacher a perfect red herring.  
3. Others have mentioned Kanye being involved with the murder, or having powers himself. I think the latter is more likely. In fact, when he said "you can tell me anything..." I seriously considered that he was hinting at "I have your power too, let's be a detective duo".  
4 (most curious one). Did the killer from ep 1 disappear after tipping his hat to Satoru? did he have a preemptive anti-revival to counter satoru? Is he Kenya?  
5. Still not clear on what function (if any) the girl from ep 1 will serve in the story. However, I do think he will be 29 again by the end of the show.

fuck, I dont know if people are just trying to guessing or they are just manga reader that spreading spoiler but make it sounds like prediction

"Baka nano?"

the peoples making this definitely know how to make a character so hate-able https://gyazo.com/f073193e7d0b40db0b3ffd8d5812cceb
>> ARTICLE
Teacher is suspect.

The kid who raced MC

The Asshole little girl

The Girl he didnt walk home with

and Kenya, all on my list of characters i see as key characters
>> ARTICLE
Teacher's probably a red herring with how obvious of an answer he is.

The race opponent doesn't seem too important to me.

Honestly can't say about the little girl. It seemed like it was there so Satoru and Mika could reconcile but my gut tells me she might be back.

Yeah, if you're talking about his friend from their group, that wasn't a girl iirc.

Kenya has been an enigma so far, not sure whether he's gonna be a good guy or bad guy but he'll definitely be important.

If I had to add anyone, I would say Yuuki will probably be significant since he was the one framed but we'll see.
>> ARTICLE
Ok i thought that was his friend in the group. 

I was pointing out characters who arent already in the main focus, which is why i didnt list Yuuki
>> ARTICLE
Maybe red eyes are a "this person is evil" sign but a "this person is important to plot" sign?
>> ARTICLE
What if Satoru actually did all of this before but his memory was so suppressed that he blocked Kayo out from everything he did.  
>> ARTICLE
That smile at the end was awesome to see, she better have a happy outcome damn it!!!!!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
Someone make a subreddit for this anime please. 
>> ARTICLE
I just watched the first three episodes last night. I'm completely hooked o: Can't wait for more, I'm loving it so far!

My only hope is that somehow or other we get more of his current timeline, with more of Katagiri Airi, the girl at his work. She fascinates me! I expected the show to do a bunch of stuff in that time and then late in the show pull him back to 1988 or something, but nope. Episode 1. lol
>> ARTICLE
I feel like we could be going to the future again later in order to see what, if any, butterfly effect occurs due to Satoru doing a bunch of stuff
>> ARTICLE
What chapter does this episode leave on?
>> ARTICLE
Dammit, why can't everything just be better already :( Kayo deserves better than this.
>> ARTICLE
The animation in this series... top notch!
>> ARTICLE
As someone who's read the manga, I'm shocked at both the astounding quality of the anime and the fantastic reception it's getting. Hell I didn't even know they were making an anime of this till I saw it on a site I frequent. I really enjoyed the manga, and by this episode, I'm almost completely convinced that they will make this an awesome series.

Especially the amount of red herrings that the author and anime are throwing in to throw off viewers on the killer's identity.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't enjoyed anime this much since Death Note. It is so long I had so much emotions going on at once while watching anime. The moment she smiled... I don't even know what this anime is doing to me, totally gonna read the manga after it ends.

Also something is totally off about that teacher! I don't like him at all.
>> ARTICLE
Its a shot in the dark but my bets are on the teacher. In the opening, after the 3 girls were shown (pizza girl, kayo, the mom), we see the man that stabbed the mom. He looks awfully similar to the teacher doesn't he?

>> ARTICLE
For t hose who have already read the manga --- would you recommend me to NOT read the manga and watch it unfold through the anime? Or is the manga just as enjoyable? The curiosity is killin me! :O
>> ARTICLE
plus the manga isnt finished yet so you'd only get more curious ;P
>> ARTICLE
They're both enjoyable, but I say just watch the anime for now for the full effect.
>> ARTICLE
I was so hesitant to give this show a try... But holy shit I just rediscovered why I love anime. No other medium could bring out such joy from me and such furry when the episode ends and I have to wait another week.
>> ARTICLE
So haven't read the manga, but kinda thinking pizza girl from episode 1 might end up playing an interesting role in the story. 

Guessing she's Hinazuki's sister born after her death. No real evidence, just noticed that she's roughly **10-12 years younger than MC** in 2006, seems to want to be out of the house when she can (Not nearly as much as hinazuki, but she did seem to want the pizza job to be *away*.

Not to mention similar light-brown hair and gray-ish eyes, but this series is going pretty realistic with colors so fair chance that's all coincidence. Also that moment when they both talked about saying something until it comes true that they directly compared.

Now if this is somehow true, I'd have to guess after he saves Hinazuki, he'll have an interesting situation where he sees just how much he's changed the future, resulting in one person he knew never being born in the first place?

Or perhaps Pizza girl is Hinazuki, going through a similar-but-separate Revive/Rerun thing? *Rebirth*, perhaps? Either way, whether they're blood-related or not I'm sure they're connected somehow...

Really loving this show, can't wait for the next one!
>> ARTICLE
So just posted a theory thing here a minute ago, but ugh, I hate when I start piecing stuff together. 

Calling it now, Miyazuki's mom's having an affair (Or at least *is seeing*) the teacher, isn't she? The teacher seemed to notice right off the bat when the MC noticed her, and, even if his excuse seemed alright, he had a story ready. 

Like it seems like they're making him out to be too suspicious for it to actually be him but it would be uniting the villains we've seen so far. I really hope it's not the case but we'll see soon enough. Like this isn't some huge theory, just a hunch, and honestly the only way I can see the story go if the teacher's actually the killer (not like we've been given a lot of suspects anyway though, I don't think they'll try to keep the villain secret until the end :P)
>> ARTICLE
All the evil people except (probably) the blonde guy in class have red eyes

Just finished episode 2, currently in the middle of episode 3. This is a great consecutive 2 episodes. What a master class in building suspense and alternating between slow paced moments and fast paced developments.

Damn, this is some good anime!

Sadly I can't see it since I live in Germany and its blocked because of

Try Daisuki, it's meant to be available globally to my understanding.

Nope, the link doesn't work either. I get an error message. I can go to Daisuki, but when I search for Erased or Boku dake ga Inai Machi there is no Entry. Seems like it's because of License restrictions again. But I watched it on animeonline now, was a really good episode. I appreciate your help though!
>> ARTICLE
Weird how the legal stuff is blocked but the illegal stuff is fine.
>> ARTICLE
I'm confused. When he raced the kid the first time, did he let him win then too? Because it showed a flash back and it showed the kid saying the exact same thing to him
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Satoru didn't remember the race and thought that he'd be more mature and let the other kid win because he tries a lot harder.  (Trying to change the past to a small extent.)  Then he realizes that he did the exact same thing in the past.
>> ARTICLE
So is Satoru naturally good at athletics or something? 
>> ARTICLE
He says he's a good sprinter but his endurance isn't great
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that was quite it. Past Satoru made the same choice, I think, but it had nothing to do with being mature and more to do with  (as his conversations with Kayo keep alluding to) "playing the part". He had trouble fitting in and so made a decision to take make sure the outcome is as should be expected. The talented guy who trains hard and everyone expects to win... wins.

Revival Satoru makes the same choice not to rock the boat, though not for the same reason as originally. He just doesn't want any unnecessary complication and conflict I guess, rather than wanting to fit in socially. Ironically, it's the same thing he did originally and the dude is pissed because he knows he let him win.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I agree.  I was just saying he did the same thing (intentionally losing the race) in both timelines.  When he remembered the other kid's response he knew he'd messed up since he was trying to change the past.  I'm sure his child mindset wasn't trying to look mature, but I think he's always felt that effort deserves a reward which influenced his decision in both timelines.
>> ARTICLE
also showing a character trait that has him believing that people who try harder should be better/get more.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, he did let him win the first time too.

That's why Satoru said, "I'm making the same mistakes again." (or something like that)
>> ARTICLE
This show is so great! I'm really liking how the relationship between Satoru and Hinazuki is playing out. But what was Kenya talking about with the teacher? Looking from afar and seeing their eyes shadowed is NEVER a good sign.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously, the visuals are stunning! Got chills everywhere with the walk up the mountain and the christmas tree. I love Satoru's and Kayo's relationship.

That child abuse gave me so much chills as well, horrible scene :/
>> ARTICLE
I'm looking forward to Kanya's role in this anime, especially after this episode. Also, I'm wondering what role will that Satoru's coworkers from the future has, she shows up I'm op along with Satoru's mom and Kayo, which is very interesting.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is going places.

I love the voice acting, especially of the kids. And the absence of music in some conversations makes it all the more serious.

Loving ever second of this masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fucking shit!

Every week it manages to somehow OUTDO the previous episode and amaze yet again.

So perfect, this is one of the most stunning anime i've seen in the past years. It has this movie vibe and such an amazing story! Im really looking forward for the next episode


>> ARTICLE
Exceptional episode again. This show is truly a masterpiece so far. I heard that the reveal of the killer is amazing when it we find out but I hope it aint Kenya. He is very clever though so I could see it being him and being able to get the blame planted on the other guy. 
>> ARTICLE
yeah, Kenya is quite suspect at the moment, but more due to there not being anyone extremely suspect(besides the parents, who would be really boring were it them)

I also find it hard to believe that Kenya is the killer for two reasons. 

One he is a ten year old, who isn't exhibiting many signs of being a killer. 

Two he is blond whereas the murderer in the first episode had dark hair. Obviously you could dye it but I find it very unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder, if he managed to solve Kayo's problems by X-day, would he be just living normal life remaining 18 years only to confirm if his mother successfully survived?

Boring and moreover stressful, would that be...

there is no way A1 pictures can fuck this up right.....RIGHT?

Really liking the voice actor of the MC. Apparently it's his first role too.
>> ARTICLE
He sounds more natural than anime which is great, too bad its on a monotone character.
>> ARTICLE
I am so behind this voice, it sounds nothing like any of the typical MC voices its so fresh. Its hilarious considering its such a downer voice he has to play here that sounds bored out of his mind all the time. Considering not much happens for half the anime, the good VA was really needed to sell this character. I am also glad he didn't go into scream/screetch mode suddenly later on.
>> ARTICLE
Reminds me of Urabe's voice actor from Mysterious Girlfriend X. Both of their first times doing voice-work (and only in the case of Urabe's), but it's really natural sounding.
>> ARTICLE
Natural sounding is probably the best way to put it. Minimal anime exaggeration of voice. It reminded me of a younger, and maybe slightly more energetic version of Hideaki Anno's Jiro in The Wind Rises.
>> ARTICLE
I agree, the MC personality and voice was perfect.
>> ARTICLE
Shinnosuke Mitsushima he's a fairly well known stage and TV actor [link](https://eigapedia.com/person/shinnosuke-mitsushima).
>> ARTICLE
Exactly this. It was very smooth and felt natural. It had a very nice matured tone that really just made me, as a viewer, want to keep listening to dialog! Very nicely done
>> ARTICLE
He reminds me of the voice actor for Ginko from [Mushishi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi)
>> ARTICLE
I really wish he'd decided to do more roles than he has. So awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Glad I'm not the only one noticing the good voice acting. It really makes his character and the revivals from his perspective ( like the child scene at the end ) realistic for me.
>> ARTICLE
He sounds realistic. Which is a really good thing for an anime like this one. He doesn't go over the top with the Revival thing, but he sounds surprised enough.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. His voice sounded really fresh.
Apparently, child Satoru also has a newcomer VA too.
>> ARTICLE
He really nails that "normal/down to earth" vibe well with his inner thoughts and that conversation with Katagiri in the hospital.

As much as I love my Hanakana, Sawashiro, Kamiya, etc., it really is nice hearing new voice actors.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah he did a really splendid job of playing his character I felt. 
>> ARTICLE
You always need new fresh talent incoming while having legends for them to aspire to be, Its a healthy system


>> ARTICLE
Holy shit that was an amazing first episode. I haven't read the manga so I don't know about the pacing but this episode really gripped me. Definitely going to be following this show.
>> ARTICLE
It did a great job at pulling me in. Love when a first episode can do that.
>> ARTICLE
Never read the manga either, but damn.... That was an intense first episode.
>> ARTICLE
I just checked and the manga is rated fairly high on MAL (8.44), so even if the anime turns out feeling rushed that first episode alone is enough for me to check out the manga after the show's over.
>> ARTICLE
Yea, it definitely seems like something I'm going to read.  If I really like the second/third episode I might not be able to wait for the episodes and just read them haha.
>> ARTICLE
I was really pumped too. With Katagiri (I think I spelled her name right) I was already in love with her character. Not sure how much we'll see of her since this anime I am assuming will be taking place in 1988, but they made me care about her as a character and her relationship to the MC with in only one episode. That takes skill in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
She's one of the reasons I believe that the show will jump between present and past. She took up a good half of the episode and she's really likable. They won't just make her disappear. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep definetly one of the contenders for AOTS . damn i cant wait
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure Ojisan and Marshmallow has that position under lock and key.

This makes for a close second though
>> ARTICLE
While I admittedly had the same thought, it's too soon to say that. It wouldn't be the first anime to start out really strong and drop off immensely after a couple of episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I hear the story stays decently strong. Just a matter of the anime not rushing the more important bits. They already rushed the story a little this episode, but not to a point of detriment.
>> ARTICLE
FUCK YOU CHARLOTTE, I THOUGHT YOU WERE ONE OF THE BETTER ONES!
>> ARTICLE
All I'll say is, as a manga reader, this is the show I'm most looking forward to this season.
>> ARTICLE
I need to know. Will the show follow his past, his present, or will it jump between both? 


>> ARTICLE
[Manga spoilers](/s "It jumps, but not very often. Only when significant changes have been made in the past.")
>> ARTICLE
I finished manga right away after watching first episode
>> ARTICLE
Awesome. I can't wait to see what happens in the next few chapters of the manga.
>> ARTICLE
No spoiler, but may I ask, has the manga ends or is it still ongoing?
>> ARTICLE
It's still ongoing.
>> ARTICLE
Dang. Oh well.
>> ARTICLE
Will we see more of best girl so far in show or nah?
>> ARTICLE
Yes! But there may be some competition...
>> ARTICLE
Pls no haremerino.

On the bright side, more Airi.
>> ARTICLE
Is the manga coming to a close or is it still in the begining cause from this first episode I really want to read it but I don't wanna... how do I say this... I dont wanna w8 for the chapters xD
>> ARTICLE
I've only been able to read the first 34 chapters (6 ish volumes), at which point things are starting to be revealed, but there is a 7th volume that was released recently and the series is still ongoing.

I'm sort of experimenting with this show because I usually never read a manga before watching the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
At first, it seemed like it was ending, but now it appears that the manga recently finished only part one. And it doesn't seem like it will finish soon. This is likely the point where the anime will end unless they decide to deviate from the source material.
>> ARTICLE
Me too! I personally really expect this anime to be one of the best for this Season. The Manga was so good in my opinion!
>> ARTICLE
Me too! Most hype. This episode resonated well with me. I have no clue how someone without reading the manga would feel about it though.
>> ARTICLE
Even as a non-manga reader this was in my top 3 anticipated new shows.  
>> ARTICLE
Obviously not everything has aired yet but this was by far my favorite. I had that nervous sinking feeling in my stomach for the whole second half of the episode which rarely happens anymore when I watch anime.
>> ARTICLE
The way his mother was talking right before she died I thought something might happen, but I figured, nah, its just the first episode, I don't think they'll kill her off right away.
>> ARTICLE
When they killed her off I got mad and threw my headset and said "It's the first fucking episode how could you do this!"
>> ARTICLE
Yeah same here, I thought that something was going to happen but not her death. I also thought that he was going to rewind to a few minutes before not 18 years in the past.
>> ARTICLE
Then again: time travel shenanigans, all bets are off. We're going to see her again next ep as her 1988 self, so as a character she's still alive and kicking. On to see whether Satoru can manage that 1% divergence level that will save his mother!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, holy shit they did a good job of making me care about a character that was on the screen for about 5-10 minutes in total. Usually in these cases there's no emotional weight, but her last words were so hard to hear. Amazing job by the VA, she sounded so forlorn and anguished. My chest properly tightened. I'm really looking forward to the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly my impressions. I was already attached and I can't remember the last time I watched 'anything' that made me make comments out loud. I caught myself talking to myself throughout the episode. I even said No! when she got stabbed. I'm a heartless motherfucker who watches Game of Thrones for leisure and this shit gripped me. I'm impressed.
>> ARTICLE
Same reaction I got while watching Parasyte: The Maxim :(
>> ARTICLE
So, this first episode squeezed in a LOT of material, though I don't think it should mess the pacing up at all.  

But wow, the visuals and direction are excellent, I am really satisfied with this as an opener. The director is doing a great job of creating an atmosphere for the show. And it looks like A-1 is bringing out their A game for this. Can't wait for the next one!
>> ARTICLE
Oh! You read the manga. Damn, now this is a half-guaranteed I'll like this series!

Tell me something, has the manga ends? If it's still ongoing, has it moved on from this first case? Because if this first arc has ended in the manga, I'd like to read the manga like now...

cheers as usual mate!
>> ARTICLE
The manga is indeed ongoing, and I would recommend checking it out! Be warned though we've been left on a pretty big cliffhanger as far as translated chapters go. The story has progressed quite a bit from this 'arc' as well
>> ARTICLE
I thought that was *really* good. It probably helps to know absolutely nothing about the source material, but I mean, aside from the obvious "why the fuck did he run away from the police?" it was very solid. I also thought it was pretty funny to see Detective Conan be on the murdered side for once.

So I guess when he "revives," he's taken to when the root of the problem begins, which is why he's taken all the way back to his childhood? This'll be interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Only thing I didn't like was how his mother ocassionally started talking about important past events with no real reason to do so. It just seemed like they were clueless as to how to convey that information. Other than that the episode was solid and a nice surprise considering the overall mediocrity of this season so far.
>> ARTICLE
I'm gonna use the opportunity to point out just how [fucked up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwao_Hakamada) Japan's criminal justice system is. It's guilty until proven innocent there and forced confession > all exonerating evidence

It's common for the police resort to forced conviction to close out case. That's why I wasn't surrpised when the Yuuki guy got convicted so easily and how imminent it seems for the MC.
>> ARTICLE
Source material is really good, so assuming the adaptation maintains its level of quality, you'll be in fro a treat. 
>> ARTICLE
Should i just read the Manga now? First episode and I'm so into it already damn
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen the anime quite yet (planning on doing so later on tonight when I have access to a TV), but it's your call as I've heard the anime is quite good. If you don't want to wait that long, feel free to binge the manga (and it's really good), but you'll be fine either way. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe he figured he was the prime suspect and needed to run? It seems dumb to us, but I've read that there's a culture in Japan that basically amounts to "guilty until proven guilty." You might think that of other places too, but Japan is known to be exceptional in this regard. 

Check this article out:

>> ARTICLE
Well that's fucking scary.  So much for the promised land, eh?
>> ARTICLE
I feel like we'll be talking about this subject more when the Phoenix Wright anime airs this april, but I remember learning about something similar.
>> ARTICLE
The article doesn't elaborate on this, but it's important to note that, in Japan, while you have a right to remain silent, utilizing it can be used against you and interpreted as evidence of guilt. This isn't the case in the US, where silence cannot be used as evidence against you (and is the reason why in 100% of cases it's always best practice not to talk to the police).
>> ARTICLE
In the US ask for your lawyer and shut the fuck up until he gets there is usually the best approach in the US

If you get arrested in Japan though, You're pretty fucked unless you're super rich or have the right connections 
>> ARTICLE
>"why the fuck did he run away from the police?

Obligatory "It made more sense in the manga."

[How it happened there.](/s "When he comes home, Satoru doesn't go past the culprit. Then when he realizes his mother is dead, he forcibly wants to trigger a rerun. (Apparently it's called a Revive now) He manages it and ends a bit outside the house. He immediately runs inside, but finds his mother already dead. He realizes the culprit must be near after taking the phone number, and sees his silhouette in his neighboring house's garden. He jumps out and runs after him, seeing that, the inhabit of that house calls the police. After a while, the culprit manages to shake him off. On the street, a policeman finds him. He runs away from him and hides in an alleyway. There he realises the culprit's plan. When the police finds him, he knows they will think of him as the culprit and wants to start a rerun, 'as far as possible'. Thus he ends up in 1988.")
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga and I think an obligatory "the anime actually fixes the manga" fits better.
>> ARTICLE
Well, without having seen the manga, it seems better to me to not have a protagonist that is able to trigger some power at will. I liked the unknown and somewhat unpredictable nature of it in the anime's representation.
>> ARTICLE
He forcibly wants to trigger? So you're saying he can do that? This seems like an important aspect of his super power. 

On another note: Why did his mom not call the police? Sure, the statute of limitations was up but that doesn't mean the police can't use her. 

Ok, a third note: If the mother suspected a child abduction, why didn't she go to the child? Why did the abductor leave the child? This is less serious of a question, I can think of reasons. 
>> ARTICLE
iirc didn't that happen after the first time he back? 
>> ARTICLE
I loved the first episode. In your opinion, should I binge-read the manga or would that ruin the anime? It's  a suspense/mystery show, which is why I ask.
>> ARTICLE
Good question, that I cannot answer. The manga isn't finished yet, so at the moment you might as well watch the anime, it seems to keep the important bits.

>> ARTICLE
He also fought with his mother before the event, yelling at her and breaking a mirror in the apartment, which made a lot of noise that everyone could hear.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, I think I prefer anime because he doesn't force revival, it seems healthier for the story. Hopefully original material didn't go that way.

Also, one of his first encounters with the police was when they falsely accused and sentenced his childhood friend. It makes sense that he has some doubts (maybe subliminal) about police.
>> ARTICLE
Now that I've read that I care more about why they would call it revive rather than rerun. 


>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing the author was using the roots of "revive" over the standard definition. Like "live" + "again" instead of "restore to life"
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. Curiously enough, both the anon scanlation and the German release by Toykopop call it rerun. Coincidence? Probably.
>> ARTICLE
The original text is "" (rerun) with ruby (the text above) "" (revival) so it's canon that Satoru pronounces it as revival. Subbing is different than scanlating in that you can't make too many differences with what the audience hears or expects but in scanlators can afford to choose the better translation so I chose "rerun," and I wouldn't be surprised if that's the thought process that the German translator went through too
>> ARTICLE
Ah, makes sense. Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh it made sense in the anime too, i mean the woman saw him with blood on his hands and it seemed from the expressions that she thought he was the killer. And it also seemed like the cops thought he was the killer and they where gonna throw him into jail no questions asked.

In that situation, no matter how many times people say running from the police is a bad idea, i would run from the police. I think the fear of getting thrown in jail for something you did not do would be enough to make me run as fast as i could
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but that moments bothers me a lot because of the coincidence that the neighbor walked in right at the exact moment which is really lame. It was the only part from the episode that I just didn't like.
>> ARTICLE
Well it didn't make sense to me because why would you touch a dead body? As a 29-year old man I'm sure that at one point or another he should've learnt that you do not tamper with anything that could be used as evidence. I understand it's his mother and all.... but it was pretty dumb imo. 

I also think running would be a stupid choice because there'd probably be a lot of proof and evidence left in the building.... So it's not certain he'd get convicted for the murder. But if he ran away then it's hard not to think he was the one to kill his mother... Plus do you really think it's easy to run away from the police from a balcony who could just taser you from behind? 
>> ARTICLE
Do you really think the average person would be able to analyze a situation and keep themselves level-headed when they believe they are being *framed for their mother's murder?*

It was definitely a stupid decision but it wasn't unnatural.
>> ARTICLE
But like I said, he shouldn't have touched her in the first place. But I get why he would since he didn't see the knife immediately. 

Honestly, I don't think the average person would run away though. They may not be level-headed but trying to escape from all those police officers wouldn't work. (I get he ran to start the revival)
>> ARTICLE
Keep in mind; he couldnt see the knife. There was no way for him to immediately know she was dead and how could he not check to see if she was still alive and just hurt. 

Also note that the killer left zero evidence. He was wearing gloves and the knife used was taken from their house (IIRC, the manga might have shown that part better). 

A case is pretty strong against our protagonist just on circumstance. He lives alone and shortly after his mother shows up, who he doesnt have the best relationship with, she turns up dead. Run or not; he was pretty screwed. He ran because he was trying for the "Revival". 

Off topic but sorta relevant; I cant say for Japanese police but Im pretty sure cops are not allowed to just tazer people willy-nilly, even if its to take down a suspect. Clear threat has to be present first.
>> ARTICLE
I guess that's true, as her son he would be hard pressed not to see if she was alive/dead. 

But then again, doesn't he have an alibi? He was at the pizza shop and I think that the murder happened before he left - unless they were just showing it first but it happened as he was walking home. 

The cops wouldn't be tazering him willy-nilly... they'd do it if he ran. Better to do that then to try to chase him down or shoot him. 


>> ARTICLE
> Off topic but sorta relevant; I cant say for Japanese police but Im pretty sure cops are not allowed to just tazer people willy-nilly, even if its to take down a suspect. Clear threat has to be present first.

I can't say for Japanese police either, but in the U.S. cops get away with filling suspects full of holes and then lying about a perceived threat.
>> ARTICLE
I'd have to argue that a few corrupt police officers existing implies that its normal for any officer to taze someone casually. Misuse of equipment has serious consequences. 

Look at any instance where a standoff occurs where someone is surrounded by twenty some cops. They could kill that person dozens of times over and likely accrue no blame for it, but so long as the culprit is non-hostile and not a threat to anyone, they will not shoot or provoke. 
>> ARTICLE
When people do stupid shit like that I always think something along the lines of "Well his mom just died and he's suspected of being the murderer, I guess doing something irrational like that isn't unheard of."

Also, the reason I'm commenting a month later is I've been procrastinating watching this anime season and just watched ep 1 today, I was supposed to study for my math test and do a lab report but that's going to have to wait.
>> ARTICLE
Wat, but being in holding while you prove your innocence like time of death and stuff, to suicidally run from cops and be shot is no sense 
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention that in Japan they have a very high incarceration rate and he would have been stuck in interrogation for the better part of a month being mentally tortured until he confessed anyway
>> ARTICLE
I get what you're saying, but I mean...there's so much evidence that proves he's innocent. There's the time of death, the time he's working (with witnesses), the lack of evidence to prove him as the killer. No existing gloves, and no fingerprints on the knife. He has a perfect alibi.

Idk, I would never run in that situation. My immediate reaction isn't to run, but to plead my case (that's just me, though). I know running only adds a bigger target to your back, and it's never good to turn your back on the police. If they have *any* sort of common sense, they would know that he wasn't the murderer.
>> ARTICLE
I think running from the police in a blind panic is MOST peoples' first reaction, especially in Japan where can't/won't just shoot you and ask questions later
>> ARTICLE
It may seem dumb and irrational, but I doubt you'd be able to think about things rationally at that point. You'd be driven be fear, fight or flight. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, possible. From a logical point of view, he'd be immediately discharged, but then again, go think logically when you just went back home to find you mum having bled to death on the floor with a knife in her back...
>> ARTICLE
Especially since his older friend got put in the same situation and it kind of scarred him as a kid.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I think a lot of people are overlooking this as well. He believes his friend was falsely prosecuted, so that should have an impact on his current outlook.
>> ARTICLE
This seemed pretty obvious tbh

theres always people that say the manga did it better, im just saying it wasnt poorly donne in the anime by any means

Manga/Novel elitism is pretty apparent on the Sub, Hell I often have to stop myself when something I view as important gets cut/changed/not explained for anime viewers 
>> ARTICLE
*That's* more understandable. Thanks for that.

I think they made a good decision to cut it if they wanted to fit all of what they did in that episode, but I think the way they did that "revive" could have been done a bit better. But that was my only gripe, though. The rest I thoroughly enjoyed.
>> ARTICLE
They could have taken out the ED and fit the above somehow within the 1min25ish period.

By the way, I'm digging the ED. It looks as if it's called, Re:Re by Asian Kung-Fu Generation.
>> ARTICLE
i was thinking the same thing but, then i remembered that the ED or OP was really damn good so i forgave them

Asian Kung fu generation... Now that's a name I haven't heard of in a while

Yeah, it's Re:Re, I was so happy because I play that song on Osu! a lot.

This is the first time I've heard this song.

It's quite pleasing.
>> ARTICLE
And its by ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION damn their music never disappointed me it's always amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Actually that's the opening I think. Ending will probably be seen next episode
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, I forgot that it's usually the OP at the end of the first episode.


>> ARTICLE
Either way, it's a damn good opening
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: It's a newer version of the song that was on their album Sol-fa in 2004.
>> ARTICLE
Really?! A re-recording of Re:Re:!? AKFG's Sol-fa is a great album, it still gets into rotation in my music playlists - one for the ages (at least mine)

mrw AKFG's 'Re:Re:' came on at the end of that premiere was like a double-whammy! Definitely looking forward to the rest of this series

Surprisingly fitting, considering the anime's story, that they would go back to an old song to redo it.

Oh cool. I thought it sounded a bit different, couldn't quite place it though.

Me at the start of the episode: wow, Sachiko is the splitting image of my mom! same haircut, same sense of humor, same age, same type of intrusive, hands on parenting but obv lots of care. I like her!  
  
me at end of episode: someone w/ Revive please save me, this show just killed my heart.  
  
in all seriousness, solid premiere. the character designs bothered me when they got revealed, but in motion they look great, and the animation itself was pretty decent as well. I like the minimalist soundtrack, and that OP they snuck into the final credits is a great song. the character writing was definitely my favorite bit about this episode, and the jump between perspectives to substantiate that led to some real eye openers. excited to see what happens next!
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit that went from 0-100 *fast*. Came in blind and it was awesome. I'm super looking forward to seeing this develop.

Also crazy-shot-in-the-dark-first-episode guess is that the killer is an alternate timeline Satoru.
>> ARTICLE
The revivals or reruns don't work like that where it would allow multiple duplicates of the same person. As you saw with the first example of the revival his consciousness went backwards in time. He does not create a duplicate.

Watching this episode and never reading the source material, I have feeling that rather than crazy time travel shenanigans instead this will be one of those "there's some sort of covered up conspiracy" since not only have the kidnappings been going on for a while but I think that killer seemed more like a hired assassin.

But that's just my theory.

As a manga reader, do you predict this show can have a conclusive ending, or will leave a cliffhanger waiting to be resolved by reading the manga... Does it have chapters where it could leave off where it would feel fine if it left there?

Given that it's only 12 episodes and the manga looks to be ongoing... I am worried.
>> ARTICLE
I feel that it could actually go either way really. There's definitely a set of chapters where the anime could end on that would offer a rather conclusive ending. But depending on how many of those they choose to adapt, it could also end on a cliffhanger.
>> ARTICLE
[The director has just announced it will use the original manga's intended ending.](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2016-01-08/erased-boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-anime-to-portray-ending-of-original-manga/.97329) (the manga will finish 20 days before the anime.)
>> ARTICLE
Dayumn! That was really frigging solid! 

They did an amazing job characterizing MC's mother in such short amount of time. She's funny, perky, really cares about her son and is not scared of taking action. All of that resulted in her death having a real impact. 

And the "revival" idea is really neat. Can't wait to see how it all turns out. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never cared so much about a character death in the very first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Damn bruh this easily AOTS. Gonna keep entertained until Jojo comes out.
>> ARTICLE
This hits the nail on the head for me. Personally I think characters are one of the most important aspects of fiction and to get me to care so much about a death episode one bodes really well for this show.
>> ARTICLE
Well technically, she's not dead anymore, since he's now in the past again. Granted I dunno if he's going to go back into the future, but so far with how the other revival's worked, if I'm understanding them correctly, he basically is getting a fresh start on life again.

**First Impressions:**

**Presentation:**

This show doesn't feel like an anime show. It feels like a movie. The latest anime movie series that *really* felt that way to me was Kara no Kyoukai, the latest anime *series* that felt like that for me was Rozen Maiden (2013). It's a deliberate sort of atmosphere, where things are allowed to stretch out, things are allowed to *breathe*. It's what Miyazaki spoke of when he spoke of just letting there be "empty moments". Nothing is rushed. It's ponderous, but it's good. It is slow, but it's deliberate and handled with care.

I liked the voice acting, which touched in on this as well, I liked the memory sequences being in faded black and white except for the one detail that mattered. Airi Katagiri's voice-acting was properly peppy. Yuki Kaijura's music was a very distinct mix of the Madoka and Kara no Kyoukai music, but I was glad the show had mostly done without, and left it to the background, and used it sparingly.

The show was slow, and careful, and done with thought. If you've seen [my top shows of 2015 list](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/01/06/top-nine-anime-series-of-2015/), it should come as no surprise that this is what I like, and appreciate. Dramas, at least in structure and construction.

**ED** - Nice, well done, stylized, not excited yet, but it's good.

**Themes / Story:**

Everything in this show is about one thing. It's about repeating and coming back, it's about being unable to move on. A mangaka who fails and enters a job with no future. A mother who moves back in with her adult son. And of course, going back in time to undo terrible events, to undo *mistakes*.

A fear of looking at one's history, and one's feelings, due to the open wound in one's soul. To learn your closest friend, someone whom you trusted, is a serial kidnapper-murderer? How will a young child grow to trust others again after that? And even if he doesn't lose faith in his friend, then his mother and the adult world exemplified through Police who didn't trust him.

Mother was cool. Moving in with the knowledge born of a life-time of acquaintance, and going straight for investigating things herself. The character of Airi, though not fully developed, was handled with deft strokes, and I grew to like her. She had poise, she had character, she had spunk. Many of her lines were "usual", but the delivery was good, and it sat well within the show.

And that's really what it all boils down to, not the hook, not the characters, not the pacing. But that it all just felt right, as if given a time to breathe, and with everything given enough time to show us why it's there, and who these people are. Nothing felt missing, and nothing felt extraneous. This is probably the strongest anime premiere since last year's winter season's [Death Parade's premiere](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/death-parade-episode-1-notes/), and [Ping Pong's premiere](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/ping-pong-the-animation-episode-1-notes/) the year before.

There's only one worry I have for the show, that I'll love it while watching it weekly, but would've loved it even more marathoning it. Mysteries are often like that for me.

([Check out my blog](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/) or the [episodics notes page](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/episodic-observations) if you enjoy reading my stuff.)

It just shows mystery anime are a lot more robust than people make it out. I just do not like it when people attribute mysteries to be only workable for movies or manga when anime does it well. Even this past year alone, there has been quite a few seinen/mystery shows that got the atmosphere right. Just a matter of keeping the plot interesting though.

Alright, this shit, right there. Anime of the Season material. No doubt about it. 

What a breath of fresh air. Everything. I did hear the manga was quite good, but I didn't think it could get me hooked so quickly. 

The MC is a fucking adult who doesn't seem too trope-y, girl sidekick seems alright but not just another head-over-heels for the MC HS girl. Mom is a mom and goddammit, they can't do this to her so quickly...

Overall, looks like some pretty solid mystery anime. I hope this first episode won't be the only one like that. I really liked the down-to-earth and more realistic elements of this anime outside of the "deja-vu/time-machine" like power of the MC. 

Also, male co-worker definitely seems like a bad guy. Could be wrong though...
>> ARTICLE
> Also, male co-worker definitely seems like a bad guy. Could be wrong though...

How could he be in two places at once?
>> ARTICLE
Well uh... 

But hey, grammar is on my side. I said *a* bad guy, not *the* bad guy!... But yeah, you still have a point. But he certainly knows something! About what? I don't know. But he knows something, about something. 
>> ARTICLE
I really loved that first episode.

I had no idea what to expect but I certainly didn't expect _SO MUCH_ to happen during the first episode. I don't remember a show evoking this much emotion during the first episode so I am expecting a lot from it going forward.

The characters were all interesting thus far and I wonder the MC means by _reviving_ as it isn't entirely clear. The visual effects and story were fantastic as well and I'm excited for the episode next week.

>> ARTICLE
In the manga they used *rerun* as the term, which works a lot better given the context of the ability.

RIGHT? I know it's premature, but I'm going to use my special executive emergency powers here and declare it anime of the season.

That was one of the strongest first episodes I've seen in a long time.

The production values are great, the protagonist is refreshing, and the story immediately drew me in. To me this is by far the most promising new anime of the season.

My reactions during ep:

Yuuki Aoi is Hinazukis VA omg!! 

What?? he can see the when something is wrong? damn. He saved that kid and got hit as well. 

WHAT? the truck driver died of a heart attack and that's why all that happened? damn...

Damn that kidnapper guy..Our MC was in big danger could that be why he developed his revival ability?

 Whos the guy on the van? Is the mom a detective or something? Omgg She got stabbed! WHATTTTT. damn it who is it?!!?WHO?? She said it wasn't Yuuki after all so who is it? He walked by him too..

That was a great episode. I now have high expectations for the series, can't wait for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
ITT: The manga did it better.

Think about it for two seconds before commenting on it again, if you don't hook your target audience by the first episode, odds are most people are going to drop your show, hence why its important to condensate the introductory volumen into a single episode, I'm sure it will get better from now on. I've only seen five shows so far this season (Musaigan, Prince of Stride, Hanachika, Active Raid and this), and I can easily say this is the one that hooked me the most.

OMG. Very nice touch. I just check the manga and there is no such thing. This means we will get at least that far in this season then.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, I didn't even realize that. Good find m8
>> ARTICLE
This is like two seasons ago, the shock of episode 1 of Gakkou Gurashi. This episode was like nothing I've ever seen. I had such a visceral reaction to this where I usually do not to anything - no overly familiar anime tropes, this was something else. I am speechless and how this has managed to engage me - please recommend this like you did School Live!

Also, personally I find male monologues to be generally poor in anime - the monologuing from this VA was spot on and fit the tone of the show perfectly. 
>> ARTICLE
WOAH.
I was already expecting quite a bit, but this episode really was amazing! Best pilot so far.
>> ARTICLE
Now this is an anime. Holy shit. This was my most anticipated series of Winter 2016 and it has far surpassed any expectations I had going into it. I'm struggling to talk about it because it felt near flawless with an impeccable hook. The final few minutes of this first episode were absolutely thrilling and I cannot wait to watch the entirety of this anime. Do yourself a favor and watch the first episode, you will absolutely not be disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
HOLY SHIT

I'm definitely sticking with this till the end.

I dislike the neighbour for freaking out and coming to the conclusion that he killed his own mom. HIS OWN GODDAMN MUM.

Come oonnnnn.

...I'll give the benefit of the doubt that the neighbour had no clue that his mom was staying over.
>> ARTICLE
The neighbour came over to give back the curry pot his mother lend her.
>> ARTICLE
Ah.
>> ARTICLE
Wow... Honestly, I was blown away by this episode, to me that was a 10/10 intro episode. They definitely sucked you in from the very beginning. I am pretty pumped to see how this one turns out.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, one entire volume in one episode, cutting out like one third of its content. Seems they really wanted to end the first episode with a bang. Not that that's necessarily bad, I am loooking forward to how this will play out in the long run.

Also, Airi looks so weird.

>> ARTICLE
As long as it's not a butcher job like 35th Test Platoon turned out to be.
>> ARTICLE
LN readers are hilariously delucional about their favorite chuuni stories. They honestly think that faithfulness is correlated to the quality of the anime. It's so cute.
>> ARTICLE
Taimadou went at a pace of 2 episodes per volume and 3 episodes for last one... After reading it, they really chopped out half of the explanation, most of world-building and almost all explanation for "behind the scenes" that confused the shit out of everyone watching it.

Also some great scenes that fleshed out the characters.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, and they also cut all the awesome fight scenes down to nothing.  So here's hoping Erased doesn't go that route.
>> ARTICLE
Oh yeah, the fights were worth an episode each at least. The fight with the Hero was at least 1/3 the original length, Usagi's fight was butchered as fuck with less than half shown... and last episode was just ugh. Glad the volumes are translated, at least the ones up til 11. It's kinda sad how fights that in anime were 5 minutes long last almost 40-50 pages in LN.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't read the manga, but I liked how Airi looked. I am assuming from your comment that we will be seeing more of her throughout the series?
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's more the art style, the looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0K50uN0.png) in the manga.

We will see more of her, to spoil the least. However, many of the stuff of volume one that this episode skipped were scenes with her, [including ](/s "an entire Rerun/Revival, where she helped him save some children.").
>> ARTICLE
Dang, I'll need to read the manga then! From most people I have seen on here, the manga is equally awesome! So I can't wait to read it!
>> ARTICLE
Read chapters 1-6 which were roughly covered in this episode. I say this because I think the later episodes will better handlle it since they don't need a cliffhanger by the end of the episode.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, if I see how a good chunk of people drop a show after the first episode because "it didn't catch them" or "it felt pretty average and nearly nothing happened", I can totally understand it.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably a gen y joke ; )
>> ARTICLE
Does Satoru have Reading Steiner?
>> ARTICLE
Finally, something to watch this season.

Looks nice. Like Butterfly effect, probably would end up being darker.

At times it's emotionally confusing whether to feel the overall dark theme or indulge in the happy vibe that genki highschool girl gives.

Definitely will stick with it. Hopefully it's not a manga commercial and we get somewhat of a conclusion. 
>> ARTICLE
So I binge read the manga as soon as I finished watching this ep.

What... a... rollercoaster!  I can totally see why it was an award-winning manga.

I'm so looking forward to seeing this animated now!  I wonder how far this will adapt?
>> ARTICLE
possibly too late to the party, but the cashier in the bookstore had Red Rum written on his apron. Read back to front it's Mur Der. It might be a reference to Stephen King.
>> ARTICLE
I'm 10 minutes in and can only think, "why is everybody being a dick to this guy?"
>> ARTICLE
It's just a Gen Y joke ;)
>> ARTICLE
That pilot has me more excited about this show than anything coming out this winter had me excited for originally 
>> ARTICLE
That was one of the best first episodes I can remember watching in the last two seasons.

It was laid out so well and every character was fleshed out, it felt like a real story and I was immersed the entire time. The MC feels like a real person thanks to his VA, and Airi acted in a way that didn't pull you out of the immersion with silly "anime" tropes. 

It's also the first show in a long while for me where I actually felt truly awful about a character death, and it was only the first episode. My heart sunk when she got stabbed, and I only felt worse when he walked in on the scene, only to get framed for it.

High hopes for this, that's for sure.
>> ARTICLE
This was pretty cool. I really liked the coworker, but I don't expect to see her again anytime soon.

I'm not so sure about the idea of going all the way back to his childhood. I'm actually interested in the murder of his mom! I could have watched a show based on that if it was done right.
>> ARTICLE
I like her too, but doubt that she'll contribute much to the plot. Its sad cause I really liked her design.
>> ARTICLE
This is really good. Like, damn.

Plus we get Yuki Kajiura and Asian Kung-Fu Generation music!
>> ARTICLE
What a great episode. 

I guess it was the best (for me) to not check the source material. Going blind into this might be really fun.
>> ARTICLE
I noticed that this show is 12 episodes. Manga readers is this enough to follow the source material to the end? 
>> ARTICLE
Manga isn't even done, but if they intend to adapt the translated material then it'll take them 3 chapters/episode to catch up.
>> ARTICLE
I really like the small subtle details and flashbacks that solidified the mother/son relationship Satoru had with his mom. Which in turn made the death scene so much more impactful
>> ARTICLE
Omg, of all the 1st epsiode i've seen of this season, only this made say "this is good"
>> ARTICLE
Oh man not again, blue butterflies. Still have some issues with Life is Strange.

Man, I translated the manga way back when and I thought it was pretty good

ASIAN KUNGFU GENERATIONNNNNNN!!!!!!!
>> ARTICLE
I don't want to overreact but this has a LEGITIMATE shot at being great! 
>> ARTICLE
I had a feeling and yes, this definitely looks interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if it's the MC's voice or the way he and other characters talk but I really think that the voice acting was exceptionally good. 

I literally felt like I watch it with him and he gives his comments on it.

Also it's the second show this season where a prefecture or city with the name "Saitama" is mentioned.
>> ARTICLE
Almost everything about this adaptation is spot on. The artstyle, the voice actors and animation fit extremely well. I'd  even say the anime does a better job of catching (and keeping) my attention compared to the source material due to cutting out a lot of parts, which I have no problem with if it helps garner more people's interest in the series.

Get ready for a wild and thrilling ride everyone! I'm looking forward to everyone try to piece together the mystery and reading all the crazy theories like in the Rokka no Yuusha discussion threads :)
>> ARTICLE
Overall, this was a great first episode and unless there's any surprises, it will probably be my favorite new show of the season. 

The only  part thatfelt kinda weird was how the mother randomly went, "Oh, let me investigate this case from years ago," but it wasn't too big a deal.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it was weird at all, considering how [spoilers](/s "her son, as a child, was the last person to see his classmate alive before she was kidnapped and murdered, and was apparently the *only* to vouch for the innocence of the man who was accused and executed for the crime. She also recognized the man who attempted to kidnap that little girl at the store. In light of this, the fact that the MC indirectly alerted her to the fact that something was wrong (as well as the briefly-mentioned fire incident from the past), and the past trauma inflicted on her son with the kidnapping ordeal from his childhood, it makes *perfect* sense that her suspicion would be piqued.")
>> ARTICLE
At the end of the episode I was so blown away that I didn't know how to react and was jumping in my chair in excitement.

I was not initially planing to see this, because I normally don't see Psychological stuff much, but I decided to see the 1st ep to see if it was worth.... And I'm so glad I did, this is going to be a fun ride hopefully 
>> ARTICLE
Oh damn that ending was both intense and a huge what the fuck.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty good start to the series. The concept is really interesting and with A-1 Pictures behind this, the quality of the visuals are going to be great. Maybe this'll be A-1's great show for the year.
>> ARTICLE
Whooooooweee baby, that was exciting.
>> ARTICLE
I'm liking this. The complaint I have is the fact that I wish the whole concept of the "revival" thing was less explicit. Also, I hope that the beginning stuff won't be completely thrown away because of his going back.  

I hope for the future, it switches perspectives between his childhood and the "present day(?)"
>> ARTICLE
Wow, seems really interesting, love the MC's VA, good with some new blood.  
Airi was cute.

I'm excited for more.
>> ARTICLE
This was wonderful

[](#gintamathispleasesme)
>> ARTICLE
Pretty good first episode
>> ARTICLE
One concern I have about this is adapting an ongoing manga. For anyone that's read it, without spoilers do you think the anime will have a good satisfying ending point based on manga material?

Edit: If anyone else is curious my question was answered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/40003y/erasedboku_dake_ga_inai_machi_anime_to_portray/). Sounds like it will share the same ending as the manga, which is pretty neat and I'm totally on board now (I'd probably have watched it anyway, but this was my one concern after so many unsatisfying LN adaptations).
>> ARTICLE
Wow I am seriously so impressed. I don't want to set my expectations too high... but I have really high expectations for this show now. Very solid first episode. Definitely getting an AOTS (if not AOTY) vibe.

I was on the edge of my seat the whole episode up until you-know-what happened. I'd have to rewatch it to remember for sure but I'd say the soundtrack, muted colors, and listless voice of Satoru were rather influential in setting up the apprehensive atmosphere. I also really liked the art style, simple but clean, and I liked the shapes of the eyes.

Looking forward to more of adorable mini-Satoru, though hopefully they use adult-Satoru's VA to voice his thoughts still.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that was a great first episode, if it keeps up this quality this will be my AotS. 
>> ARTICLE
Cue Digi disliking this because it's made by A-1 Pictures...
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, this show absolutely blew me away for a first episode. The whole time I was feeling chills down my neck. The whole premise behind the show is amazing. I cannot wait for more episodes.  I love the voice actor for the MC you can definitely tell he is tired of his life, but when it gets to being important he really nails it also. When his mom started to figure out who the kidnapper was I got this strange feeling in my head that someone would appear in the house and I knew it was coming but was still shocked when it happed. GOD I CANNOT BELIEVE HE GOT FRAMED FOR IT AND GOT REVIVED TO FUCKING 1988. I NEED MORE

An absolutely fantastic first episode, not sure I'll be able to hold off from reading the manga

They made me like the mom in one episode. Not by making her likable. By giving her personality. She's not the perfectly nice mother with the side ponytail. She's a bit of a pain. And she's dead.

That scene where MC's face goes gray when he was experiencing a revival near the grocery shop was really tense. Then everything just kept getting better afterwards. Loving it!
>> ARTICLE

I can't believe it's **Shinnosuke Mitsushima** first role, he's doing way better than most voice actors so far. (Chinatsu Akasaki isn't that bad either).

So far the adaption is well made and the character designs are improved from the manga.(well the latter shouldn't be that surprising)

>> ARTICLE
I found this by accident. I didn't really read the tag for it, so I thought it was going to be something like Bakuman.

So far, so good. I'm going to enjoy this adaptation hopefully.

Wow, best episode of the season so far for me.

Holy shit, that revival at the end. I had forgotten the premise but remembered wanting to watch this show, and I was completely mindblown when I realized what happened.

Curious to see how he'll redo everything now that he has a second chance, as well as how Katagiri plays a part. I really liked her character and surely she couldn't have been introduced like that only to disappear now.

This show had me on the edge of my seat towards the end. Definitively something I'll keep watching.

Off-topic: a lot of the anime this season have some really long Japanese names. It's going to take me a while to register which is which!

Did anyone notice the blue butterfly showing up? I spotted it twice.

It happened every time just before his power was used. When he passed the truck, when the balloons went into the air and the last time was just before he ran from the police.

Looks like that seems to be some kind of trigger for the revival.

That was incredible, really looking forward to see how the mystery will play out.
>> ARTICLE
I was very impressed. Think I'll try to avoid the discussion threads in future though. Asking for trouble with adaptations of this kind of story.
>> ARTICLE
Went in blind and have no experience with the source material but I could tell the pacing was a bit fast. Felt like I got 3 episodes worth in one, which isn't necessarily bad because that ending _ I was not fucking ready for those last 5 mins. I mean, her death flag was set and all but jeez. It's just episode 1 and all these feels. 

Definitely got me for the entire season, will be a hit if A-1 don't mess it up. I was liking his little high-school sidekick but guess she's no more since Revival and whatnot :(
>> ARTICLE
Justice for Yuuki! Some people are just nice!
>> ARTICLE
I am so happy they animated this manga the only disappointed part about it is that I already know the ending. Do not read the manga or at least only read up to the first volume if you haven't because this is one of those stories that its best to not know what will happen next ahead of time.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like Anime of Season to me so far. Pretty excited.

Asian Kung Fu Generation as the theme song. This anime can't be that bad
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga and was so hyped for the anime.  Was not disappointed, they did a fantastic job with the anime.
>> ARTICLE
This looked really good. The power isn't something that makes the MC automatically OP, but it has to be combined with the MC's own abilities if he wants the ideal outcome. Looking forward to next week!
>> ARTICLE
The mystery sounding music is absolutely chilling. And the sound effect when he has a revival is so immersive 
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed this. Did not expect the [](/s "murder") at all, that went a lot deeper than any other show I've been watching recently, so it kinda surprised me. I liked the show overall I'd say, I like the MC, the premise of the ability. 

One thing I wanted to point out was the first person scene near the end. I don't know why, but I feel like this one was a lot better than what I've seen in other anime. Maybe because it had more walking motion to it, but I just felt I had to point that out, I liked that.

First series this cour that I'm actually exited for after watching the first episode.

Wow I don't think a shows has impressed me more than this one.  Like holy shit.  I've never just been like "WHAAAAAT" watching a first episode before.  Every other anime this season can just go home.  Also, having an AKFG song, an OLD AKFG song as the ending, simply because it fits hit me with so much nostalgia since I first heard them in the old Naruto/old FMA days.  I'm in love guys.
>> ARTICLE
So far the most interesting show I've seen this season. Only 1 episode so far, but it grabbed my attention.
>> ARTICLE
AOTS calling right now
>> ARTICLE
I like it a ton (also nice to see an adult MC character, like his VA). Time-travel stuff is right up my alley.

I hope Yuuk is absolved of suspicion and things work out. I liked what little we saw of him--he was rather nice (which is why it worked so well when we learned he was arrested as the murderer--at the time we had no reason to assume that was a mistake, so it was that much more of a sucker punch). 

>> ARTICLE
This was amazing! I started watching with zero prior knowledge and was really blown away. It didn't seem too fast paced to me either. Looking forward to the next one!
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god this is kinda amazing. I didn't expect to find a show with 10/10 potential this season.
>> ARTICLE
wow this looks really good! I haven't really seen many mystery anime before so this looks very promising.
>> ARTICLE
That girl reminds me of Hiyori from Noragami
>> ARTICLE
This show reminded me why I watch anime.
>> ARTICLE
Well done for making me care about someone in such a short amount of time which is kind of weird my mom is so much like this. I can understand why people are saying this has the potential for AOTS but it could crash & burn in the remaining episodes


>> ARTICLE
It reminds me a bit of 20th Century Boys. This looks really promising! 
>> ARTICLE
That opening monologue really resonated with me...
>> ARTICLE
I don't usually watch this kinda of stuff but holy shit that was goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
>> ARTICLE
Wait so since from now on he'll be his little-kid state, that high school girl who worked at fast food place with MC will pretty much be completely irrelevant to the plot?
>> ARTICLE
[spoilers](/s "I suspect that he'll be jumping back and forth. Considering the nature of his power, he's going to run into many incidents where he has to save someone from the serial killer or foil him in some other way, causing his consciousness to jump back to the future, his fundamental goals being: save Yuuki, his weird adult friend who was framed as the serial killer; save his classmate; and save his mom. Kind of like how Okabe had to keep time leaping while undoing all the dmails the labmems sent.")
>> ARTICLE
Haven't seen it yet - Does it seem to be worth watching? 
>> ARTICLE
I knew that the Mom was gonna die the moment she said she was gonna call the MC about the kidnapper, but still, that was really sad watching her last thoughts be her time with her son. :'(

Also that AKFG at the credits. What is this, 2005? Glad to hear them again, and in a non-shounen show to boot.
>> ARTICLE
we got a good mom in anime and she died in episode 1 :(

damn that ending literally gave me shiver
>> ARTICLE
I shouldn't have seen this first episode now... but it's too late. I guess I am going to go through hell of waiting weekly for every new episode...
>> ARTICLE
That was even better than I was hoping it'd be. The mom ended up being way better than initial impressions led me to believe.
>> ARTICLE
also, yay seinen! this is fantastic so far.
>> ARTICLE
Okay guys, AOTS right here.
>> ARTICLE
The premise of the anime is very interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
I have no words, this left me speechless. The only thing I can comment at the moment is that Yuki Kajiura never disappoints and that this is already a very strong contender for anime of the season.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck me, I was not expecting that. I had a feeling the mother was going to get the stab, but wasn't sure. That was intense. 

Usually I don't like stuff with Blood in, but this somehow is different for me. I will definitely be watching this regularly. 
>> ARTICLE
What is a Gen Y joke?
>> ARTICLE
In the manga he specifies it as a joke made by someone born in the 90s
>> ARTICLE
The protagonist isn't really breaking new ground in terms of personality, but this episode was otherwise pretty solid. I'm eager to see where it goes from here. 
>> ARTICLE
I read the topic title wrong and instead of reading "Boku dake" it turned out as "Bukake" and didn't want to come here fearing a Hentai... 
>> ARTICLE
Well that was an exciting first episode! I was looking foward it since I first read about it in the new season chart, and it did not disapointed. The voice actors did a great job to convey the personalities of the characters and the whole atmosphere is so movie like, it's pretty refreshing. And when the ending song started playing all I though was "wait a minute, I know this song, why do I know this song?" It sounded so much like childhood XD and when I saw the title I understood why, that song is what, 10 years old? Hearing AKFG always reminds me of Full Metal Alchemist haha. This will definitely be on my must watch of the season, just hope the rest is as good as the first ep.
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't expecting to be so drawn in but my body is ready. Love the voice actor. Love how his ability is kinda annoying and not something he exactly wants to do. Really looking forward to this one.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't see that ending coming. I really liked the mom as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Just like I was expecting...This was really good.
I love the atmosphere and the main character is exactly the kind I tend to like, kinda chill and reserved but has a good heart.

It's amazing how they made you like the mother in such a short time because when she was stabbed I started getting teary eyed and was begging for her to live but fuck...

Loving the voice of Satoru, from the moment I heard his voice in the PV I've loved it. I really hope that his voice actor will do more anime after this. 

This anime also has my favourite opening thus far, AKFG really never disappoints.
>> ARTICLE
This one was already in my plans to give a try depending on the ratings, but I've been studying Japanese pretty much all the time lately. 


Thanks to the ratings of this topic I decided to check it out right away. Pretty awesome episode, incredibly thrilling for something that's just got started. I hope they keep it up because I'll definitely watch this one weekly!
>> ARTICLE
Nice first episode, really want me to know whats going to happen next.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that's the first time I've ever been scared in an amine before.
>> ARTICLE
*Applaud*. I'm hooked on the very first episode. Mature characters, great voice work, and mystery atmosphere. Reminds me of the Korean thriller Memories of Murder or Mystic River or even Nolan's Memento. This is gonna be great!
>> ARTICLE
was this a sleeper? or did people know about it

i heard/saw like zero buzz around this show until it aired today

and i have to say, i've never been so hooked on the first MINUTE of a show - the dialogue was so resounding and perfect in many many ways

of course, it went a different direction than i expected, towards a mystery more than a NHK-style grim reality, but that added on to the pleasant surprise i think

can't wait to see this one unfold, season seemed pretty weak based on some charts, but this just goes to show you cannot judge a book by its cover
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck that was good
>> ARTICLE
This anime looks hectic
>> ARTICLE
I am loving this anime so much it's definitely anime of the season for me. I really want to pick up the manga and continue it because the weekly releases are killing me .
>> ARTICLE
I feel the need to curl up in a ball while talking to someone else about my feelings after that episode. Holy hell that was amazing. I doubt this will be the last time I feel this way during the season either. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god... Already we got an AOTY contender in our hands! This was amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god... Already we got an AOTY contender in our hands! This was amazing!
>> ARTICLE
The AKFG EP sealed it for me, Now I have something to look forward too on Thursday night lol
>> ARTICLE
* They didn't make the girl cute (in that way at least), guess this means they wanted to make sure people didn't ship the guy with her?

* Hmm, if he keeps helping people out all the time, how has no one noticed some kind of a pattern?

* Wow, that mom doesn't look 52 at all.  The lips keep her from being attractive though.

* Japan has a statute of limitations on kidnapping+murder, and it's < 18 years?

* Shit, momma got stabbed.

* Time leap to put right what once went wrong!  

So, that was pretty damn good, will definitely be watching this one every week.  I wonder if the evil red-eyed dude will turn out to have a similar power.
>> ARTICLE
The high school girl? If you didn't think she was cute idk what you define cute as. 
>> ARTICLE
Well she was cute as in adorable, not cute as in "I wanna see her naked."  That's what I meant.
>> ARTICLE
Good thing this seems to be a mature anime where the point isn't to want to see the characters naked
>> ARTICLE
I actually agree, wish there were more like it.  It's pretty refreshing for MC to be friends with a high school girl (even if for just 1 or 2 episodes) and her not be sexualized at all.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap. This one's pretty good.

I was on the fence for most of it, but the last quarter really sealed it for me. This one's gonna be intense.
>> ARTICLE
Guys it said Saitama! Confirmed OPM best animu.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no, I forgot to look up what anime are coming this season! This sounds interesting though, I'll try watching it. :)
>> ARTICLE
do, i just googled it. 6 volumes. how long is this anime slated to be? can I expect an S2? should I be worried about an anime original ending?
>> ARTICLE
Came in dry and HOLY SHIT did I just enjoy that

My god, what a first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Question. Are all the episode 1 discussions on the homepage including this, new animes that just started?
>> ARTICLE
Yes
>> ARTICLE
Probably the best anime of the season. 
>> ARTICLE
Was that Asian Kung-Fu Generation?! 

I was planning to stay before, but now I'm staying for sure!
>> ARTICLE
Really impressive stuff here and I can say this is the series that has left the best impressions out of all the winter anime of 2016 by a **long** shot.

VA's are doing an excellent job with their respective characters and the sound design has been impactful and resourceful. The dialogue has been spot on and the interaction of characters were top notch. With an opening episode with so much going on it could have been easy to lose the audience but yet not once did I find myself wondering or confused about anything and I think that is an indicator of how good that exposition really was.

>> ARTICLE
I really liked this first episode seems really promising!
>> ARTICLE
wooo i love the manga so now i get a anime? wooo
>> ARTICLE
Coming to this anime knowing nothing about it. This had one of the better first episode than most other anime I have seen. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh an anime about a struggling manga artist, ok  
Oh he can travel a bit it time, probably going to make manga about the things that happen or something  
Oh he has a pretty cool mom  
Oh... This... Is gonna be awesome!

Must. Resist. Reading. The Manga... This show looks promising indeed.

Absolutely solid and incredible first episode. Haven't seen something that refreshing in a long time now, and will definitely be looking forward to all future episodes. I'm going to take a guess and say that this will be the best anime of the winter season, at least from what we've seen so far.
>> ARTICLE
Quality characterization - check.

Interesting MC that isn't immediately a trope - check.

Great premise and twist - check.

Dark slant without being gory and schlocky - check.

I'm in.




>> ARTICLE
This anime is off to a fantastic start! The combination of deep thought and an interesting concept of the "revives" is what has made this anime stand out so far in my opinion. I truly hope that this anime continues on with a pacing that will do it justice. 
>> ARTICLE
F U C K.

That was SO GOOD.

10/10.
>> ARTICLE
....holy fuck this show looks AWESOME.  Count me in, lets hope it continues the stride it's started with :)

For those who are worrying: the anime will have the manga conclusion, pretty much like FMA:Brotherhood

To relive life again with knowledge of everything that happened? I don't know if I could do that... Sure it might turn out a happier ending... But. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if this is a continuity error or something else, but it bothers me that Sachiko was stabbed in the back, but when Satoru finds her the knife is in her belly.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, she got stabbed in the back right? Look at when he finds her... What the???
>> ARTICLE
Voice acting felt visceral and real. Very impressive first episode. Hopefully he's able to save the girl. And that last bit where he tried to runaway was a big flaw in logic... which pissed me off.
>> ARTICLE
He's a depressed, aimless guy who just discovered that his mom was murdered, only to be found by his landlady and become the prime suspect for the murder. *Anybody* would panic and run in that situation.
>> ARTICLE
Out of every new show I've seen this week thus far, this one has me the most excited. Not having read the manga, I now I feel I should hold off on reading it due to spoilers. 

I also have problem nit-picking differences between the two so thats another reason for me to hold off on reading it.
>> ARTICLE
This was fantastic, best show this season so far.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure what I should think about the entire first volume being in the first Episode. On one Hand it's good to keep People interested, cause the manga doesn't Show it's true face until the end of the first volume. But on the other Hand I'm a bit worried.

Yes, the first Volume has a lot skippable scenes but as a big fan of the manga it hurts a bit to see them cutting out that much.

Let's hope they are slowing down the pace now that we got to the interesting stuff already. 

(Also this pretty much confirms that this is gonna be a 12-13 Episode Anime, cause there is no way they can split up the remaining 5 Volumes into 23 episodes.)

EDIT: MAL lists it as 12 episodes. So yeah, that would be 2-3 Volumes per Episode which is fine I guess.

EDIT2: 2-3Episodes per Volume of course. Welp.
>> ARTICLE
You mean episodes per volume right because if it was 2-3 volumes per episode we'd be done in 2 more episodes
>> ARTICLE
Oh sry, of course I mean 2-3 episodes per volume. My mistake. (Fixed it)
>> ARTICLE
I don't know what I was expecting with this, but it was certainly not a time-travelling detective story! One of my favorite shows from last season was Perfect Insider, so it's exciting to see the start of another show that looks like the entire season will be dedicated to one major mystery.
>> ARTICLE
Besides the neighbour assuming that MC killed his own mother and him running away from the police, it was a pretty good first episode.
>> ARTICLE
> Besides the neighbour assuming that MC killed his own mother 

Did she? Didn't she just scream when she saw him with his hands covered in blood?

> and him running away from the police

That's kinda an okay reaction when you realize you're the first person who's going to be implicated.
>> ARTICLE
>Did she? Didn't she just scream when she saw him with his hands covered in blood?

That's how it felt to me, I don't think she'd start screaming from just that.

>That's kinda an okay reaction when you realize you're the first person who's going to be implicated.

He seemed to me like someone who wouldn't freak out that much and would immediately try to explain himself.

I guess both scenes just felt too exaggerated to me, even for anime standards. Maybe I'm wrong.
>> ARTICLE
It's cool. We can just both agree it was a great pilot :)
>> ARTICLE
Well this was, really really good. 
>> ARTICLE
gave it a straight on 8 on MAL so far, I'm really enjoying this and its the strongest anime that wants me to watch the next episode
>> ARTICLE
OK, this one I like. I was feeling a little down after checking the graph for this season, but this one was a strong 1st episode, I hope it can maintain this quality going forward. I hope against hope that it doesn't turn into another Zankyou.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man have I been waiting for something like this. Superb first episode, I absolutely cannot wait to see more of this series. I love me some time travel/mystery stuff so I have a feeling I'll really enjoy this one. The animation was nice, and the character designs looked pretty, The ending song was good, not sure if its the OP or the ED but I quite like it. I'm not following too many non sequel shows this season but this is one I'm glad I picked up. Lets just hope it stays this good, not too fond of eating my words.
>> ARTICLE
honestly the most gripping first episode ive seen in ages.
>> ARTICLE
The guy actually sounds like a "real" male, and not something inbetween. I'm surprised.
>> ARTICLE
i'm feeling a steins;gate vibe on this one
>> ARTICLE
...bruh

BRUH.

#BRUH.

AOTS potential?

AOTS potential.


>> ARTICLE
Not a big fan of the presentation. The voice acting (could be the dialogue in general) and the visuals were pretty bland and unmemorable.

That said, I'm interested in the story and it had a really gripping atmosphere, almost like a Death Parade + Steins;Gate type feel. I'm in for more.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that was good, I was looking forward to it from the PVs, but it was even better than I thought.

I just hope the time travel doesn't get too convoluted, it can really hamper a good mystery show.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome first episode. Definitely was a good start. 8.53 on mal already!

And plus the MC isn't some high school student anymore!
>> ARTICLE
Is this some kind of psycho - detective Conan? 
>> ARTICLE
I've not seen much detective but I doubt it's like that.

It's more like "child goes back in time to prevent all the murders, kidnapping and injustice to friends and save his mom" mystery thriller show.
>> ARTICLE
My main ?? with this episode was the whole bit with the mom making him forget.  That seems a bit strange.  I get that she wanted to suppress his reaction / possible PTSD and such in a kid, but the fact that she did that *and then he really did apparently lose almost all his memory of the event until like 20 years later* is bit much to swallow.  But, he remembered it quickly enough apparently so I guess she didn't have magic brainwashing powers, so ok I guess.  They also set it up a bit since the MC's eyes and mind seemed to catch and stutter everytime the news mentioned kidnappings and stuff.  So I guess I can accept it.  I suppose it comes down to the word choice when his mom mentioned that -- which I no longer remember actually.  IIRC it seemed strong, which was off.  Ohwell

That aside, really interesting ep1.  The first half of the show was like "ok, neat, he can rewind a bit of time, this can go a lot of ways but it's kind of interesting seeing what he does with the power".  The latter half was like "ok, I guess this show is going to get a bit serious, now you have some crime drama aspect -- will this be a supernatural version of that bone show from last season?"

But that last scene.  Ouch.  This opens up an enormous amount of possibility while still holding true to the main crime / drama aspect.  This kid is now a 29yo in a [middle?] school kid's body.  Holy shit.  Crime drama: can he stop his mom's murder, and the original kidnapping?

Life drama:  Will he have to live his entire life over again?  All the people he saved over the last 20 years of his life -- will he have to save them all over again?  Can he remember which ones he saved?  Presumably he's inside his "rewind" right now -- that means he will not "rewind" when the truck driver hits the kid, for example.  He'll have to remember to stop the truck driver.

Serious mode aside, now he's going to be the most popular kid in class right?  He'll ace all the tests, and he has the maturity of a 29yo.


This show has a good focus, as well as enormous potential with an incredible launch in ep1.  Can't wait.
>> ARTICLE
This anime has a Steins;Gate vibe.
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering why this looked so familiar. I remember reading the manga a while back because it is from the same author as Cradle of Monsters. I didn't know this one was getting a anime adaption.
>> ARTICLE
I really liked it. It has the same desperate feel that Steins; Gate had.
>> ARTICLE
Read the Manga



Best anime of the season 10/10 instantly 



But seriously don't read the Manga like me. If u enjoy the suspense every week
>> ARTICLE
I don't read the synopsis of anime anymore. I don't look at the genre either. I'm glad I didn't for this one as well. I just look at the voice cast, saw Aoi Yuuki was casted and I started. I thought it was going to be a romance. 

I'm so glad I was wrong. I'm so glad. After taking a break from anime in the Fall 2015 season this is a great return. 
>> ARTICLE
Neither do I.

Just 1 PV and I'm hooked.
>> ARTICLE
This is the best first episode of any show I have ever seen
>> ARTICLE
This anime was *the* anime.

The series had me in the palm of it's hands from the second it started. The first episode was amazing. It did so well in setting the stage for what is to come.

The animation was really marvelous. Not too fancy and not too serious. It gives a good detective type feel to it. I loved the way they used effects and cinematography (is that what it's called) in certain scenes. 

I really like this MC. He is just like any other human being aside from his "Revival" power. And his voice acting is being done really well.

I've already recommended it to a bunch of friends who don't watch much anime and they too loved it. It's been so long since we've had such an amazing and thrilling mystery show come up.

This is indeed going for AOTS.
>> ARTICLE
Since I started The Perfect Insider near the point where it was done, I sort of want to wait, but this show's first was amazing well executed and I want the next episode....
>> ARTICLE
Kinda wish I didn't watch it today and instead waited a few months so I could binge
>> ARTICLE
Holy. That turned dark, REALLY fast. Especially that ending. I have a strange feeling this is probably going to be THE anime of 2016. Awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't heard Asian Kung Fu is so long
>> ARTICLE
1. I am so glad I have no clue about the manga, going in fresh into this is so fun.

2. The VA of the MC, mom and the girl are amazing.

3. I don't remember an anime gripping me in the first episode as of late, that truck scene though worked for me. And well the ending scene just topped it of.

4. Katagiri is best. I am just sad we are probably not going to see her anytime soon because of that twist at the end. That twist tho, hoooly moly.
>> ARTICLE
Damn son. This protagonist is the most depressed character in the darkest anime I've seen this season, but I can't help but root for him and look forward to see how he'll change in this coming season. I'm sort of hoping that he'll go through hell to try and save his mom, eventually fail, but still learn enough about his past and through endless struggles, become a different and better person. This anime is definitely at the top of my list these next few months! 
>> ARTICLE
Have not been hyped for a seasonal anime that I've never heard of before since Kekkai Sensen. I have the highest of hopes.

What did he mean by saying "Gen Y"?

[Millennials.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y). So, young people.

As someone who immediately wanted to watch it based solely on the premise I was not disappointed. Some great VA work and a great setup to a story that I hope will ultimately...well, probably bring me to tears.
>> ARTICLE
This was really good, can't wait. Reminds me of hannibal in a really weird way.
>> ARTICLE
For some reason, the graphics/animation style reminded me of Durarara. In a good way, of course.

So far better than I expected. I thought I'd dislike this kind of "drama/psychological" series but I'm looking forward to more.

Also, good job translators properly telling us what "Showa 63" meant. As opposed to that one anime past season...
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully this show wont pull some Zankyou no Terror shit and introduce some b.s several episodes in that ruin the natural feel of this show
>> ARTICLE
As someone that's been reading the manga for a long time, all of you are in for one hell of a ride!
>> ARTICLE
Wow... I'm kinda sad... for some reason was really liking Airi Katagiri but with this last part of going back in time, it means that she is not even a main character and I won't see her that much :( XD
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed the episode. But I REALLY enjoyed the ending song. I love that band.
>> ARTICLE
Am I the only one who felt this escalated really quickly especially during the second half of the episode?  Otherwise I thought this was a pretty solid episode.  I don't usually like A-1 stuff but I heard this is a noitamina show and I like the premise too.  Been a while since I've seen a mystery I've enjoyed.
>> ARTICLE
The mom's cv is the same person who did case closed's Conan. Almost made me think she was going to be the detective in the story.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that was intense! 
>> ARTICLE
huh well this was unexpectedly good
>> ARTICLE
At first I thought it was copying Life Is Strange, but then I realized it has a manga that came out in 2012, and now I think I know where the blue butterfly idea came from. ;)

I was already gripped by the first 3 minutes. I love when a good anime just grabs you and doesn't let go. Now to decide if i should read the manga or not.

AMAZING first ep! Totally hooked!

And fucking KAJIURA YUKI making the musics! This is gonna be even greater!

Fucking hell, I am surprised how good it is. I think it's a potential AotS

Wow, just came here to say: WOW!
Never heard about this anime, just cought it right in this thread a few days ago and thought about give it a shot: WORTH IT!

Talk about hook line and sinker you have my attention erased

Hmm seems like the manga is pretty good as everyone is saying hope it gets NA release ill get it day 1 if it does.

* Active Raid
* Ajin
* Assassination Classroom s2
* Boku Dake ga Inai Machi
* Dimension W
* Divine Gate
* Hai to Gensou no Grimgar

I picked quite a few to watch this season, and so far, this one is by far the greatest. Some have disappointed me, but this and Dimension W are simply amazing. I'll stick to all of the ones I decided to watch, but I simply can't look forward to anything more then these two.
>> ARTICLE
That was one of the best, if not the best, first episode of a series in a long while. Relatable and interesting characters! An intriguing backstory and premise! Showing and not just telling! I am hooked and I hope it continues being this good.
>> ARTICLE
Best of 2016, calling it now.
>> ARTICLE
So good omigod.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, after watching a lot of mediocre anime in the last few seasons(most of them being dropped) and being disappointed and fed up with the anime industry I finally got around to checking this show out. To my surprise and delight it actually did so many things right. The tone, the writing, the pacing, the score and it even did some impressive things visually as well. The characters were great, it felt for the most part grounded and strange in just the right amount of ways. I'm really impressed, from the preview I got a completely different idea of what it was going to be like and when I read it the MC was a mangaka I thought, oh great another cheap excuse to put something anime fans can relate to in. But no, they worked it in really subtly and beautifully. Bout fucking time we got a good fucking show.
>> ARTICLE
Well damn. Now I have to watch the rest of this show.
>> ARTICLE
Man that was a good first episode. I feel a good mystery/time travel series coming along here.
>> ARTICLE
This season is looking killer across the board. I watched this with no idea what to expect. Now I'm completely hooked. The show is stellar on all talking points in my opinion. You care about every person that is presented!

He says "Yokai" a lot, what does that mean?

The fish lips on the mom are really really bugging me.

And I watch Steven Universe too. 

But I think part of it is a younger generation that only knows new "simplified" clean digital anime/manga look is now trying to go back and add complexity details to the usual designs and ... kind of missing it a bit. It looks even more awkward than usual sometimes.
>> ARTICLE
Just watched this episode. Absolutely amazing! I'm so glad I finally got CrunchyRoll. The voice acting is amazing and unlike some shows the subtitle translation isn't awkward.
>> ARTICLE
RIP okaasan, I totally didn't see that coming. /s

I never watch this kind of stuff, but jeezum crimany that was obvious... And I'm usually oblivious to...
>> ARTICLE
Plss tell me if who is the killer,, i want to know before i commit suicide!!!!
The mother or the teacher???
>> ARTICLE
The episode was amazing but Asian Kung Fu Generation at the end was just perfect <3 Felt like they knew what I liked
>> ARTICLE
So, just a cool little tidbit I picked up on a second watch of this episode for those who read the manga.

[MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS](/s "I noticed when his mother was making her phone call to Sawada, I'm assuming, you can faintly see a "web" dangling over her head. Kinda like how the killer would see them over peoples' heads before he killed them in his flashback. Neat little bonus they threw in there for people who've read the manga.")
>> ARTICLE
Can someone elaborate on the "Shiitake" / "See you" phrase, never heard it before!
>> ARTICLE
AotS confirmed, I'd say. The anime I had the highest expectations for, and so far they delivered. Hope that A-1 doesn't fuck this up near the end though, given how we're only getting 12 episodes iirc and the manga is still on-going.
>> ARTICLE
I think A1 usually (if not most) of the time does a good job with their adaptations. AoTS confirmed (for me) though is hard to say, I think automatically it's a top contender since I felt underwhelmed by Myriad Colors Fantom World's EP 1 yesterday. Gate's second cour starts tomorrow and CR has a pretty solid line up from what I have been reading. This season looks like an awesome start to 2016!
>> ARTICLE
Nah, considering that I only really care about two anime this season in the first place, and the second one is a sequel where I already know what to expect from (Shirayuki S2), it's pretty much locked at the top already. I don't care at all about whatever else is airing, though I did pick up some random anime from this season. 
>> ARTICLE
10/10 for me 

The only downside was that the mom's lips looked weird...

But seriously, damn that was a good first episode. I just hope it keeps the suspense up throughout the series.

Not blown away so far but there is certainly a ton of potential in this show.

was worried that there would be no good anime this season, until I saw this one. 

>> ARTICLE
holy shit. this was amazing. finally one anime to be expecting to among the seas of the way too out of hand fanservice panty/boob world. the voice acting of the MC was very good too, the char design could have been done more detailed but still is a good one. the pacing is very strong. If this continue like this it can become a great show
>> ARTICLE
The studio nailed that stare down on Airi's legs in the hospital room, that's human nature and I love how they had animated that.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck a through and through fantastic episode with a GOOD cliffhanger? I will stop my marathon for now. This is perfect. I am sure things will become awful again but until then...this is my head-canon ending.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. Not gonna touch this for some time.
>> ARTICLE
"Am I in the way?"

"yes" ( I said that out loud)

*headpunch* "WHAT DID YOU SAY?"


I can live with this cliffhanger, not very happy that only Sachiko and Satoru, should have taken the CCC and/or police

The previous ones were just too cruel.

Loved the episode!
>> ARTICLE
Ok, I think i am going to make a bold prediction. Is it the teacher who is the guy who is doing all these murders and stuff. his red eyes and he seems the least suspicious but if u look deeper he might be it
>> ARTICLE
I believe the same thing. Based on a couple of things. When he went to Kayo's house, he just let himself in, which suggests to me he's happy to allow himself access to things, even if it's not appropriate. Also, a comment he made about "I think she's safe. In fact, I know she is." Also, earlier, when Satoru suggested he get the police involved, he was dour and dismissive. 
>> ARTICLE
ya that one where he said i think she is safe since i know she is obviously means only he is going to harm. he hasnt harmed her yet, so he will in the future..
>> ARTICLE
I think the comment " I think she's safe..."  alluded to the teacher's knowledge of the childeren's plan, hiding  Kayo. I'm not disagreeing with you about the teacher being the murderer, it must be him or the assistant, or some random charecter, however that was my interpertation of him saying. "I know shes safe". I think this is further supported when the mother calls the teacher and the teacher seems to allready have anticipated this sequence of events.
>> ARTICLE
Yea since the first few episodes I felt the teacher was the Big Bad, but with each passing episode there's just more and more reasons why it's definitely him. I'm really hoping it all leads up to him being a red-herring, and not the predictable Manipulative Bastard trope.
>> ARTICLE
Satoru's mother is the best mother character in all of history.
>> ARTICLE
She's absolutely awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
This series' ability to change from a lighthearted mood in some scenes where everyone is just a kid wanting to have fun, to a completely uneasy mood that has me on my toes waiting for something bad to happen after every cut astounds me. Also am I the only one who finds it a bit odd that Kenya is so intuitive? I mean, he is supposed to be the smart one and all, yet I have an uneasy feeling about him. More likely it is just the teacher, but my mind will be a mess for the next month until the last episode comes out.
>> ARTICLE
I feel about him as I do the teacher. I don't know if theyre actually guilty of anything or not but they definitely seem to have something at least semi-sinister going on with them.

Wait, did an episode just end without a character almost dying/ teasing a character death? What am I watching again?
>> ARTICLE
This show can be so heart-warming yet so heart-breaking at the same time. I love it.
>> ARTICLE
I know this is late but after watching this episode, I just, I just want to go home and hug my mom. Cause that breakfast scene really got to me reminding me of all the meals I took for granted.
>> ARTICLE
I BAWLED MY EYES OUT AT THE BREAKFAST SCENE
>> ARTICLE
My theory is the teacher is the real abductor and the real killer. I might be wrong, just throwing that out there
>> ARTICLE
Alright, so I'm really late to the party on this one, but I just binge-watched the first 8 episodes, and I have to say this show is *amazing* so far.

With that said, I'd like to propose my theory regarding the killer's identity. First, let's go over the evidence we have so far:

1. Yuuki is not the killer, based on Sachiko's revelation in the first episode. Plus, he was in prison in 2006, so he couldn't have murdered Sachiko.
2. The killer believes that Sachiko knows his face. Otherwise, what's the point in killing her?
3. The killer knows that Kayo is being abused at home. That's the only way he could know how to kill her while simultaneously framing Yuuki and her parents.
4. The killer knows that Hiromi is a boy, despite his feminine appearance. That's how he knew that killing Hiromi would help get the police off of his tail.
5. The killer knows of the hockey club's old bus and uses it as a hideout.
6. The killer's earliest victims were all students at Satoru's elementary school or at a school in a neighboring town.
7. The killer ultimately becomes a councilor in a major city. This suggests some history in public service, as I doubt one gets a position like that as their first government job.

Based on the above, it's obvious that the killer is somehow affiliated with the school. That would give him both access to class rosters and contact info for his victims' families. This alone would easily explain how he knows Hiromi is a boy and how he knows about the hockey club's old bus. Furthermore, because he knows Sachiko's face and knows of Kayo's family situation, it's likely that the killer is associated with Kayo's and Satoru's class. Therefore, *the most likely culprit is Satoru's teacher*. If he somehow turns out to be a red herring at this point, it will either be a masterstroke of storytelling or a complete ass-pull. I, for one, am betting on his being the killer.

Edit: After thinking for a bit, I'm more than a little suspicious of Sachiko's reporter friend. I think he may be an accomplice. That would explain how the police knew Airi had left the hospital and that she was meeting Satoru. I can't think of any other way that makes sense aside from freak coincidence. Will report back if I think of anything else. 
>> ARTICLE
i just started this anime (so gooood) i think the teacher is the killer (or possibly satoru's future self??):O some things i noticed: in the opening you can see there's a scratch on the killer's left cheek, he (pretty sure it's a dude) has dimples (like the ones caused by old age) and has a fairly earthy wardrobe (a metaphor for his "earthy" personality?) not to mention the recurring imagery of paper planes and flooding rivers... HMM. either way, great show and i can't believe i postponed watching it

I was not expecting to love this series so much

I just want to keep Kayo safe. I don't think i've ever felt so protective of a character before

Seeing the breakfast scene honestly made me misty eyed.
>> ARTICLE
Kayo is definitely the most adorable character I've seen.  I just *need* to protect her.
>> ARTICLE
I dont think ive ever felt so protective over a character before.

Kudos to the writer, I want to see her smile so bad


>> ARTICLE
She's quickly become once of my favorite characters just because of how bad I feel for her. Her parents make me want to scream. 
>> ARTICLE
The breakfast scene totally destroyed me. I am even crying while remembering it. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I hear ya I had a Similar reaction to bacon when I first saw it too
>> ARTICLE
Binged the entire show, and I'm now teetering on that dark line of wanting to read the manga to see what happens but not wanting to spoil the anime for myself.

Can I really hold out one whole month? Only time will tell.
>> ARTICLE
I gave in the temptation after episode 5 and i highly recommend that you just wait it out. Once the anime is over, go read the manga. The manga is amazing, almost as good as the anime, and has more details to it and such.
>> ARTICLE
I felt that the art was lackluster, almost near to how ONE drew OPM.

But it definitely has more details.
>> ARTICLE
It's a unique artstyle. I happen to like his art and his other works for that matter.
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't go that far, I think Sanbe Kei's art is just unique, while ONE's is just kinda...bad.
>> ARTICLE
If Kayo dies I am gonna go in there tengen toppa style.
>> ARTICLE
I would lose my shit too
>> ARTICLE
If she dies again, my hopes will die along with her. :(
>> ARTICLE
The part when someone comes into the house and you're all alone and scared as shit... I know that feeling. Glad Kayo was all fine in the end. 

Great episode! 
>> ARTICLE
I really hope nothing happens to her again.
>> ARTICLE
> The part when someone comes into the house and you're all alone and scared as shit... **I know that feeling.** 

wtf?

Well, I had a similar experience this September. Long story short though,all was OK in the end

very short

Best kaasan 2016.

I lost it when she was remembering all the past "breakfasts" she had. It destroys me thinking that there are kids that have to go through such a loveless childhood. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, that was a little trip in it of itself.  I was like, "Ramen, that's pretty bad."  "Okay, toast, pretty bad"  Then, "WTF JUST 200 YEN"
>> ARTICLE
I was going to make a Gintama joke about 300 yen, but I'm crying right now watching this scene.
>> ARTICLE
thank you , I just opened this page and you made laugh hysterically while tears are still in my eye from that moment

>  "Okay, toast, pretty bad"

Worst part is, the toast didn't even seem toasted, so it was just a piece of bread.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking the same thing.  Made me so thankful that I grew up in a good home and sad that others didn't have the same opportunity :(
>> ARTICLE
Yea, I wasn't expecting that dose of sadness. I was just munching away at a burrito and then BAM, tears in my eyes.

That was expertly executed.

First in a long time i actually cried to an anime.

i want to cry, but i cant.... GOD DAMN IT *cries* well i tried...
>> ARTICLE
I texted my parents right after to check in,  definitely made me think about how much they do for me. I think knowing that these things happen is just the most painful part. 
>> ARTICLE
How is there doubt in anybodies mind that it's the teacher. Look at his eyes, whenever there is even a hint of shadow his eyes tint red. Look. 

Now. Red eyes. When was the last time ominous glowing red eyes was a good thing? This guy is definitely guilty
>> ARTICLE
Got a bad feeling when it flashed to him talking at his desk. I'm with you on this one.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno, this episode made him seem like more of a benefactor to me, similar to Sachiko.
>> ARTICLE
I really want to trust the teacher, because he seems like a good guy
>> ARTICLE
I want to trust the teacher like I want to believe this will end happily. Key word: want.
>> ARTICLE
It can't be right? It's way too obvious right now. Has to be a red herring.
>> ARTICLE
We're in episode 8, it's hard to be a red herring anymore imo, unless they introduce more characters. Right now it might be a question of how and not of who.
>> ARTICLE
There are literally no other suspects.
>> ARTICLE
Not Yuuki? He was acting quite weird about Hinazuki this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Yuuki has the unenviable problem of being in prison in 2006, and therefore cannot be the 1988 murderer if the 2006 murderer is the 1988 murderer.  Thanks for eliminating a suspect, time travel!
>> ARTICLE
Sachiko realised it wasn't Yuuki and was later murdered by a guy who looked nothing like Yuuki while Yuuki was in prison. So yeah it can't be Yuuki. If it somehow was Yuuki, then it'd mean there were 2 killers, make Sachiko's realisation and murder utterly pointless, and make half the plot useless.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 4 gave Yuuki, Kayo's mother and her mom's boyfreind alibis.
>> ARTICLE
That's just the thing: Unless the MC I'd doing time travel shenanigans, I don't see how it can feasibly be anybody else. Just listen to how the teacher talks and how he reacts, he is far to picturesque for my comfort.
>> ARTICLE
I've been focusing on the teacher in this episode, looking for the tinted eyes... I didn't see them. Can you link some screenshots?
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for the late reply, I don't have any on hand. I'll see what I can get later today or hell, even tomorrow.
>> ARTICLE
In episode 6 the reporter's eyes flashed red.

I do think it's the teacher as well, because of the matching coats this episode, but the red eyes don't completely give it away.
>> ARTICLE
even our good OP got red eyes out of bloodlust
>> ARTICLE
I'll see if I can head hunt some screen shots. Just to draw attention away from the reporter, the murderer is younger then him. Again, no screen shots but I'll see what I can get

It's episode 8 and things are going too well.

I have a feeling bad things are gonna start happening soon.
>> ARTICLE
I mean...considering the fact that Hinazuki is still technically going to die, according to what we know and have experienced at this point, and he's going to end up going back to the present where he's in custody for the murder of his mother, I'd say things have already been happening and things actually aren't going too well at all.
>> ARTICLE
Could that "favor" the teacher was asking for from Satoru's mom be related to "paying back that favor" she mentioned in the first episode when she was trying to figure out the real killer?
>> ARTICLE
When did she say that?
>> ARTICLE
Satoru's mom is one helluva mom.  Really heartwarming to watch her be so nice to Kayo, the second half when Satoru brings her over had me smiling a lot, it was so warm and fuzzy right to the heart.  You better get vengeance Satoru, your mom is a saint!!!!!!!!!! 
>> ARTICLE
I LOVE Satorus mom, she's just so awesome. This whole Episode is awesome, the show ist awesome. I cried together with Kayo, its so good.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was so intense. I was in tears together with Kayo-chan and also so happy for her finally experience some warmth. T\^T;
Best mom just rose to new heights! 

The cliffhanger wasn't too bad either this time, but I have the feeling something terrible will happen in the next episode. I'm still suspecting the teacher, now even more because this episode made it seem like he really is a good and trustworthy guy. I think everyone is trusting him too much and it won't end well.
>> ARTICLE
I worry everytime any adult gets involved(except his mom).

They try to make every adult seem trustworthy. Satoru is sure it isn't/wasn't(?) yuuki, and the reporter guy seems genuine.
>> ARTICLE
This was a happy episode from beginning to end, I bet we're going really down from here on =(
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone notice that the teacher wears the exact SAME brown leather shoes, black pants and beige overcoat as the murderer guy who went into the bus and kicked the box?? hopefully this is just a red herring but who else could it be lol
>> ARTICLE
I didn't notice the shoes but I got very suspicious after the phone call with Satoru's Mom. I'm kinda confused didn't Satoru see the murderer in like episode 6? So he should have recognized him right?
>> ARTICLE
I got suspicious when he said that he knows Kayo is safe. How else could he know that other than if he was the one who came to the bus in the night?
>> ARTICLE
The guy who was in the bus never saw Kayo, she was behind some curtains that he didn't open.

I was under the impression that he knew Kayo was safe because Kenya was talking to him earlier in one of the episodes, and keeping him informed. If not that, then there is also the possibility that Satoru's mom read Satoru's mind and predicted his every move and kept the teacher informed - she does call him the second Kayo arrives at her house, which suggests that she had previously been in contact with the teacher and was just updating him on new developments.

The teacher also told Satoru indirectly that he wouldn't go to the police because he knew Satoru was sheltering Kayo and it would possibly get Satoru in a lot of trouble.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, good points. Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like it has to be a red herring because the of the amount of evidence leading us to believe that he is, but at the same time, the fact that Satoru hasn't even considered the teacher a suspect makes me think that might be what's being set up.
>> ARTICLE
This episode hasn't finished covering all of volume 4 yet. 
Halfway through the next episode, it will.
We still have volume 5-8 to cover. 
So... we'll be at exactly half-way point middle of episode 9. 
Which gives us only 3.5 episodes to cover the entire second HALF of the story. 

Yeeeaaaah... it's gonna be very interesting how they're going to manage it. 
>> ARTICLE
fuuuck... really? well i hope they can do it

without spoiler, do you think that they have enough time to finish it?
Do you think a second season would make sense? (though i dont really think that they would do one)
>> ARTICLE
I think it's completely impossible.  
They'll have to cut the entire last arc and go straight to the final story after reaching a certain point in episode 10. 
>> ARTICLE
This just makes me want to read the manga more because that way I wont miss anything, but at the same time, I'm watching this anime with friends, so I can't without being a total bitch about it. 

FFS the real dilemmas in life huh? 
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, stick with the anime until it ends and read the manga. 
I'm raising question because I think they're going to shred the rest of the series into pieces to fit in, but absolutely love the direction of the adaptation. I think it will be an enjoyable anime to the end regardless. 
>> ARTICLE
What about an original ending?
>> ARTICLE
Its confirmed the anime will have the real ending of the manga. So at least we will get the true ending no matter what, its just a matter of how they will get there in the 4 episodes. I have never read any manga's before but if I hear something is skipped in this show I might just have to go read it when the show finishes cause this show is to good.

>> ARTICLE
:/ ... Well thats kinda bad but lets just hope. Did they skip anything as of jet?... How good is the manga and is it available in Europe?
>> ARTICLE
Everything is available on the internet... google is your friend, in fact just put the name of the anime in japanese romanized, put "manga" at the end and a ton of online options to read online will appear and some more digging and you might even find a scanlation that you can download
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they'll do a second season to finish it
>> ARTICLE
am i the only one sensing that they're setting this up to make it seem that the teacher is the culprit?
Is it just me? My dad? No?
>> ARTICLE
I forget, but how did MC convince Kayo to run away from home? Wasn't she always too afraid to do so for fear of getting caught and abused even more? And how did MC convince her without leaking his knowledge that she's a murder target (and thus betraying the fact that he's from the future)? I'm kinda having trouble following all the motives for the actions going on in this show. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, clearly Kayo likes him and she knows that he's trying to help her (not save her from the murderer, but more like helping her with her mom), so after their birthday celebration he just asked Kayo to run away with him and she agreed.  :)
>> ARTICLE
Culprit leaving his footprint on cardboard box is such fucking dumb idea, I can't even. 
>> ARTICLE
I was watching that scene like, 'Uh, that's not how footprints work', I guess it wouldn't leave some mark if it was muddy enough, but a perfect footprint on a dented box seemed a bit silly.
>> ARTICLE
Never got a box in the mail with a bootprint on it from the courier?
>> ARTICLE
Uh...no?
>> ARTICLE
Well, I have. The sole pattern doesn't have to actually dent/imprint the box - just having dirt on it from a warehouse floor can leave a good print of the sole pattern on the box.
>> ARTICLE
Really, I've never seen that before, It just seemed a bit too perfect of a footprint to be believable for me.

Sorry for the low res, but [I found an example](http://i.imgur.com/Tm6cq2j.jpg).

Fair fair.

I was honestly starting to lose interest in the show, but this episode brought it back up.

The present day episodes like 5 and 6 slow it down a bit, the show really shines when they go back to the past like this and the last episode.

How exactly did you once almost lost interest in this show? O.o I'd like to know your train of thought.

I lose interest every week

HOW?! If this can't keep your interest, what show can?

I just love everything about this show. But the end music is just icing on the cake! So good.

Man as someone who works with children... This episode hit me pretty hard. Its so sad to see her cry of happiness from a homemade breakfast. 

Kids shouldn't have to live that kind of shitty life... =(
>> ARTICLE
Same.  I teach fifth grade and some of them have been in situations like this...this episode really affected me.
>> ARTICLE
That sucks... Kids should be able to have a decent breakfast and be able to take it for granted. They shouldn't have to be thankful for something so basic.... Like muffins would be a decent breakfast and you can buy mixes at the store for a dollar that make 6. All they need is like half a cup of milk. I wish no kids had to start off with shitty lives. They didn't ask for this...
>> ARTICLE
I have third graders who deal with the same kind of stuff.  It's terrible.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its tough to see that stuff irl. I worked with some at risk youth for a while and that was pretty hard for me cause you just can't help but wanna hug em or something and say "Its alright" or just something!
>> ARTICLE
Don't know if anyone's noticed, but Arai would be either conceived or be in her mother's womb around the time the murders happened. 
>> ARTICLE
In other words... Does this mean when/if he goes back to the future they're gonna be the same age and be a ship?  
But if everything works out then him and Kayo are gonna be a ship....  
What should I believe in ._.
>> ARTICLE
Him and Kayo will always be the one true ship, but if something bad happens, there is always the backup ship of Arai, but I really want that one to never set sail, even though I really like her character.
>> ARTICLE
This is one of those moments where I think "Why not have all the girls!" 
>> ARTICLE
Because this isn't a shitty harem.
>> ARTICLE
And that's why I love this anime r/calmdown 
>> ARTICLE
I'm totally calm, just stating a fact.
>> ARTICLE
I was waiting for someone to realize that.
>> ARTICLE
so why did the killer just leave?
>> ARTICLE
Because the killer didn't even know that Kayo was there. He just went to his hideout to troll on YouTube and be angry about his life.
>> ARTICLE
If I understood correctly, he was using that secret base to store his murdering shit. He didn't know Kayo was in there.
>> ARTICLE
Did he not see her boots?
>> ARTICLE
They were next her, she was hidden behind the curtain.
>> ARTICLE
Oh ok, I thought they were by the door, my b.
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of, didn't the kids set up those curtains? how did they not notice those curtains?! 
>> ARTICLE
I think it the first time the murderer went to into the bus, so maybe he just didn't bother to check. Honestly that part just felt weird for me, I mean why did he kick the box then just leave. Hopefully they'll explain in later episodes.
>> ARTICLE
He stored his shit and was frustraded he didnt get to kill Kayo so he showed that box who the boss is.
>> ARTICLE
He was practicing his kick-boxing.
>> ARTICLE
lol
>> ARTICLE
You're reading too much into someone venting their anger/frustration, maybe you don't do it, but there are a lot of people (including me) who when, frustrated about something/themselves tend to let it all out in different ways, hitting something, smashing your table, cussing out at the air, whatever suits them the best I guess
>> ARTICLE
It's also likely that a murderer would vent his anger in an aggressive way.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe he kicked the box in frustration that she was missing, and didn't actually know she was there?
>> ARTICLE
My guess:

He had all his shit there, and was gonna make a drop off, but he sees that there is obviously someone taking shelter there. If he were to get involved with whomever was there while having absolutely no knowledge beforehand of what is behind the curtains, he could have made a fatal mistake. Kinda like a huge bluff in a way? For all he knows, there could have been a grown homeless person and having a scuffle with him and failing could result in his capture. Not to mention, if he happens to kill whoever was behind the curtain, it would make it SUPER difficult to carry out his plan. High alert everything, extra unwanted snooping, etc. The blood would be immensely difficult to completely clean and not to mention, disposing of all his evidence would take hours (it took multiple trips to set up his shit).

It's obvious that the murderer is extremely meticulous and organized so something as uncertain as this wouldn't make sense to him. He took the blow to continue.
>> ARTICLE
The show continues to impress week in and out, undoubtedly one of my favourites for this season. 
>> ARTICLE
This is one of my favourites fullstop, It's been a very, very long time that I've watched something airing that I wasn't bored of 3 eps in a force-finished it or just half-assed watched it all.
>> ARTICLE
I've _never_ felt anxiety like I do when watching this show, for something to get this much of an emotional response from me is unheard of, it's possibly my favorite show in general behind maybe like.. Breaking Bad.. possibly, definitely my favorite anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel the exact same. I just told everyone I know to watch this anime.
>> ARTICLE
Ooh big shout, it's definitely on it's way for me to get into my top 10, possibly top 5 if it has a perfect ending, I wish it was 24 ep series, there's only so much you can do with a 12 ep unfortunately, so far its been pretty much flawless for me from start to finish every episode, no bs at all.
>> ARTICLE
I think I've teared up or straight up cried every episode since episode two.
>> ARTICLE
like someone took photo in OP. I wonder where is video for "what is in OP in this anime" :D because i would watch that. :D

ahh fuck, cried a little on that one. this is a stunning show.

I want to read the manga so fucking bad but I don't want to spoil it for myself since the animation is just so damn good and the anticipation. This is the worst dilemma.
>> ARTICLE
Wait for the show to end, only one month to go, then binge read it because it's so fucking awesome, and as someone who have read it, I'm pretty confident that they'll end this season at the point you'll want to read it the most, so bear with it for maximum pleasure !

Actually, the anime is supposed to have the same ending as the manga.

You're a lucky bastard believe me, I've read all of it.. now I don't feel any thrill or emotions after seeing any scene. Don't read ahead, enjoy the anime and what it's offering.
>> ARTICLE
I just watched the episode, it was an emotional roller coaster. 

I also felt super sketch about the teacher saying that he "knows" she's safe when he was outside Kayo's house. 

That man is super shady. 
>> ARTICLE
That call that he made after MCs mom...i hope im wrong, but i have a feeling hes going to try and set her up as a kidnapper.
>> ARTICLE
Oh fuck I reckon you're right with that, he seems to be in this far too much to be just a side-character that is trying to help find Kayo.
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely adore Kayo. Her subtle reactions (flinching when Sachiko reached out to pat her) and her not so subtle reactions (crying when she discovers a huge breakfast made with love and care) make me fall in love with the character. I really hope she gets adopted by miss Sachiko and gets to live a happy life with Satoru.

They can't be married if she's adopted by MC's mom !  *still ships them*

Why not? I don't think there's anything illegal about it in Japan or the US so long as they're not blood related. Hell, in Japan sometimes familes adopt a groom so he can take the bride's last name and carry on their family name.

Yeah, I've been hearing this too, e.g., just before the revival events near the end of ep1 and at the beginning of ep7. I've read that Kajiura's soundtracks sound similar, but this is the most strongly that one of her tracks has reminded me of an earlier one.
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful, moving episode. 10/10
So with all this 'who's the killer?' theorizing, could it be possible for the killer to be two separate people? As in, the person who killed Satoru's mom and the person who killed the kids in the past aren't the same person, but somehow related? 
Probably not the first one to ask about this, but I'm really wondering if it's plausible. 
>> ARTICLE
Well then who do you think about ? I'm already struggling thinking about who is the killer, so 2 ?! But that would be a mind blown for sure
>> ARTICLE
I'm not entirely sure yet, but I was thinking maybe the teacher (in the past) and one of the kids in the future (possibly Kenya)? Because from what little we've seen of the killer who killed Satoru's mom, it doesn't seem like he's very old- and if it's the same person than as in the past, assuming he was at least 20 years old, he has to be middle aged.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds about right wow
Plus they were talking weren't they ? Maybe Kenya has the same power as MC and knew all along there is something off
>> ARTICLE
That would be an awesome twist, and it would make sense, too. It doesn't seem like Satoru really knows why he has Revival, so it wouldn't be far-fetched to assume that it's just something that certain people can do. 
>> ARTICLE
In one of the episode endings, Kenya was shown in talking to a man in black, in a setting looking like the teacher's room. Suspicious indeed.
>> ARTICLE
So the bus was the murderer's storage of his stuff. The reason he postioned it there is in order for it to be closed to the second victim and can easily be use as a set up to frame an innocent individual.

We've seen the killer gets inside the bus and vent his anger, maybe he was not able to get Aya or he can't just move to the second victim without getting the first (kind of priority list) which is kayo. And he is pissed by this because there is no window of opportunity.

That breakfast scene.... Superb!!!
>> ARTICLE
I think the killer was stopping by the bus to drop off his kit and was pissed because he had just checked the storage shed (probably again) and she wasn't there. So the killer has been storing his stuff there all along and has some kind of tie to that school... I wonder what it is?

The show is smart, if it's just bleak all the time you become numb to the tragedy. You gotta reel them in with hope before you stab them in the gut.

I sort assumed at the beginning of the show that the mom wasn't the best mother since her and Satoru had sort of a weird relationship. I'm surprised he grew up to be such a layabout with such a supportive mom. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, when she didn't believe him about Yuuki it fractured their relationship from Satoru's end. So they fell into the relationship they had in the first episode. 

edit he to she 
>> ARTICLE
Hinazuki's opening and closing eyelids, as she remembered the paltry breakfasts her mother had served her in the past, in comparison to the grand display that Satoru's mom puts on, was one of the best cinematic moments in the show so far. It was so effective that I felt like I was going to well up with tears before Hinazuki started to react that way. That's a mark of truly good filmmaking. Don't make the audience cry because the character is crying, but make us cry because it's something worth crying about.

In a completely unrelated thread...

I think it's safe to say now that Sachiko is best girl. I've waited long enough. Y'all need to know the TRUTH.

Yeah that breakfast scene hit like a truck! It felt so real, excellent direction again...

Three things I take from this episode:

1) So the teacher actually plays a major role in helping Kayo. But he still seems suspicious to me, given the fact that he was AGAIN shown in some questionable shots and perspectives. Pretty sure he was the one entering the bus as well. I really like him as a character, and even more so if he turns out to be the killer.

2) Anime can still make me tear up.

3) Lord Christ allmighty, a positive cliffhanger for once!

He also mentioned something very important in this episode, he said he knew Kayo was safe. Maybe best mum  told him but it's also possible that wasn't the case...

I was wondering why the killer didn't just murder Hiazuki on the bus. Then I realized just how disciplined and skilled this guy truly is. He didn't kill her because he no longer had his scape goats. 

First off, he needs her to be killed on her mom's place, this gets suspicion on the mom initially due to her abusive behaviour. Then once the foot prints are matched with the guy who's name I can't recall, the police will suspect him, further pushing guilt away from the actual killer. 
He knows he can't kill her at the moment and it's burning him up inside. I think he went to the bus in order to kill her anyway, but controlled himself so he wouldn't get caught. He was so angry at this that he lashed out on the box and dumped his now useless gear. 

I'm a little confused about what was inside the box though, I missed the relevance it played to the story.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't it possible the murderer didn't know she was on the bus and is using that place as a stash for his gear? He could've been showing frustration when he visited Kayo's house and found she was not in the shed.
>> ARTICLE
Briquette aka Charcoal Lumps were in the box. It is the fuel that East Asians use to heat up a small stove and obviously, its carbon monoxide it expels is extremely dangerous to use in closed rooms.

A lot of people commit murders, suicides or just die by mistake because they left it on in a closed room. 

In a twisted show of mercy, maybe the killer wants to kill kids painlessly.
>> ARTICLE
It's the small things in life, right? It's the things we take for granted. The consistent supply of food on the table. The smiles from your close ones. The warmth from your loved ones. The reasons to smile, the reasons to laugh. You don't know what you got until you lose it. It might be an overused saying, but it's so so true. And you won't necessarily realize it until it's relevant.

Kayo finally breaking down really got to me, I got genuienly moved. We don't know much about her parent's reason for abusing her, we don't know much at all. But we do know Kayo has been suffering, and we've seen what it's done to her. Closed up and cold, afraid to go home. 

The abuse was her everyday reality. We've seen her gradually open up, small steps at a time. Watching her laugh while in the bath, smiling as she goes to bed, and then breaking down into tears when waking up to smiles, hot breakfast, care and love, in a safe environment. This episode was strong, powerful and really really moved me.

Another excellent episode once again. Satoru keeps voicing his thoughts by accident, which is always fun to witness. There's still a lot of unknowns and that makes me uneasy about what is to come.

She's the most attentive, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, detectively awesome, and supportive mother I've ever seen in an anime. Without her this show wouldn't be anything, she's basically put everything in motion and keeps everything held up while not drawing too much attention from the MC.

That breakfast scene hit me so hard.

Made me realize all those breakfasts my Mom made for me for granted. Somewhere in the world, some kid is probably having cup noodles for breakfast.

I'm 99 percent sure its fucking yashiro sensei. Fuck that guy is sneaky. I don't know what request he made but I know it's part of his bs. I haven't read manga, so I may be wrong, but I'm pretty fucking sure. Satoru needs to trust no one, not even his mom because she's being deceived by this fucker. He needs to fucking work on his own and the 9 year old that he is, it doesn't help.
>> ARTICLE
Part of what makes this premise so interesting is the fact that he needs to rely on others, partially because he's a kid and partially due to lack of omniscience, so it makes the tension... tenser, and the accomplishment feel more wholesome 

With that, he is in a bind where he has to trust some adults who seem good, because he'll fail otherwise 
>> ARTICLE
I swear it's mystery 101 to fucking throw red herrings to the audience but they are spending way more time on the teacher than usual and not giving enough time to anyone else.


I swore it wouldn't be the sensei and if I'm wrong I'll be bloody pissed off. At this point the only reason I'm saying it's not the sensei is because of the twist on the actual killer we get in mystery mediums.

No idea what the fuck the parents were doing. My friend gave me this apologetic look when he saw my reaction to the amount of beer cans that were lying around the floor.

He didn't really have a stove, it was more of those electric stove thingys, and there was this small kettle that was whistling on it.

Still insanely suspicious of the teacher at this point like many others have expressed. I mean there were a few shots of the teacher's body language and expression in a couple of scenes that went longer by half a second. [Like this one for example.](http://imgur.com/UFLUog2)

Obviously that mean something's up with his role of the murders in terms of his emotional attachment/involvement.

Also thank god the show didn't go to the cheap fanservice route with the bath scene to evoke emotion between the time spent between Satoru and Fujinuma.  
>> ARTICLE
Not gonna lie, I watched the majority of this episode through teary eyes, everything about it was so bitter sweet. 

I love some of the shots this show chooses to use, it adds to that cinematic feel by having the camera focus on the scene rather than always follow the characters like a dog wanting food. 

Also props to the animation of Sachiko on the landline, the animation of her closing the door and handling the phone was so fluid, it added a lot to what could of been a pretty standard scene. 

Finally Sachiko and Kayo nearly broke me, how much she goes out of her way to show this girl what a loving mother is and to just make her laugh and smile, god damn it's beautiful. 

12 episodes is starting to feel worringly short, but I have nothing but hope and optimism that they can pull it off.  ^^^please ^^^pull ^^^it ^^^off

Feel like the hamster wheel was representitive of how our MC is working in a loop against an impossible force. He was unable to stop the loop of murders.

Man... her 'flashbacks' at her usual breakfast, and her breakdown at seeing a real meal after being a home with proper warmth and love... Really powerful moments here.

And finally, an episode that ends with me having a lot of hope and optimism!
>> ARTICLE
I think this episode did some amazing stuff in showing exactly why this is such a good anime. That being, having characters you can really root for. Kayo is charming and cute, but not a damsel in distress in the normal sense, she has her wits about her. Satoru's mom is extremely likable for obvious reasons, and Satoru himself has such a noble quest that you cant help but root for him. The number one thing for me that a bad show does is give you a bunch of characters and no good reason why you should give a shit about them. I genuinely want kayo to be safe and Satoru to complete his mission
>> ARTICLE
\#1 mom award goes to Sachiko. Again. Aside from everything she's doing for Satoru, supporting him and what not, she even treats Kayo like her daughter. All of that stuff at Satoru's house, I think, is really important. Giving Kayo at least one normal night and morning. No shitty house, no shitty parent, no shitty food. Love, warmth, tenderness and affection. 

It's just so beautiful ;~;

Edit, I had to rewatch the breakfast scene, and something I don't see a lot of people mentioning is the how well the scene was done *artistically*. In-universe it was a really important, beautiful little scene. But, art and direction wise... At Satoru's house, the food is all [bright, vibrant and just... *warm* looking](http://puu.sh/nmiT4/e2a4afc5b5.jpg) whereas at Kayo's house you get [dull red, white and gold colored cup noodle packaging](http://puu.sh/nmiXI/d218908f6c.jpg), [grayish, bleh-looking bread](http://puu.sh/nmj03/6ca6c58d62.jpg), [200 yen](http://puu.sh/nmj3I/c5c8f3a6ed.jpg) and a [god damned washed out, ~~depressed~~ empty looking little girl](http://puu.sh/nmj78/14ebe74551.jpg) [eating her pitiful bread alone in a park.](http://puu.sh/nmj8Q/9d84ca7fe5.jpg) Aaand cut back to [vibrant, delicious looking breakfast](http://puu.sh/nmjg4/ee8a5052c3.jpg) in an [even warmer looking house](http://puu.sh/nmjja/7a9c1f9578.jpg) with people who have done nothing but [care for](http://puu.sh/nmjl5/3c942a1463.jpg) and [love her](http://puu.sh/nmjmF/0ac461104c.jpg) like her actual mother never could or would.

The mother is quite an intriguing character. I'm a bit surprised she didn't scold Satoru for not asking for her help considering how well she read him. 

I mean at the end of the day she's an adult and Satoru is a "kid" so one would think she would try to teach Satoru to rely on her a bit more as a loving parent. IDK maybe she just wants him to grow up by letting him come to her though. 


Meh anyway she's quite an awesome mom (a bit too perfect for me but I guess this is from child POV).

I think that the supplies spilling out of the bag and the angry kick to the box implies that the bus is actually where the murderer goes to do his murders, someone else called it his "staging ground". He probably went out looking for Kayo that night and was mad that she wasn't where he could find her. Very spooky. Freakin' serial killers and their pathological need to murder who they already decided to murder. Guh.
>> ARTICLE
So, you think that he didn't know that Kayo was there and that bus happened to be his hideout?.. OH! Now the contents of the box make sense. 
>> ARTICLE
I was too touched at that scene that I started crying. 
>> ARTICLE
That breakfast scene will haunt me. I was eating a brownie and suddenly I was choking on it and on my tears. Kayo having all these heartwarming, healthy-family-like scenes made me so happy, they were very well done.
>> ARTICLE
I like how they covered Kayo's age [in this scene](http://i.imgur.com/qrfwra5.jpg), because it was changeable.
>> ARTICLE
So I was thinking about Satoru randomly blurting things out, my theory it's that he's doing it because his younger body has a younger brain with less impulse control.

The way Kayo flinched before getting her head patted by Satoru was really good showing instead of telling. Kayo is one of the most realistic depictions of an abused child I've seen in anime.

I'm growing increasingly suspicious of Satoru's teacher, in addition to being the only adult males whose innocence is not certain in the show he has all the information of where Hinazuki is and when. I feel like if he's not the villain then the villain won't be a character we've met in Satoru's past.

Finally a harmless cliffhanger! I was expecting a bad episode ending.

Let's get to the topic: Why is Satoru's mom so based?

I really like the humor in the show.

And that cry killed me...

That breakfast scene...

[](#deko-cry "Kayo!!! Someone give her a hug!")

So, the guy who got into the bus, was he aware that Kayo was hiding there or not? I mean, he could've killed her there. If he was not, was him kicking the box his frustration from the changes that Satoru has been doing since he came back? And of course his plans getting ruined.

I was hoping that it wasn't just Satoru and his mother that confronted Kayo's mom. That the teacher and CPS peeps would also be there too.
>> ARTICLE
Laughing and smiling Kayo = Best Kayo.

Seeing her being happy just makes me smile. Seeing her cry during breakfast showed just how much shit she had to put up with back at her place and how many emotions she had to keep inside. Nobody really cared for her until Satoru and his mom showed up and welcomed her in.

You've got to be a right sad twat to send someone spoilers in a message.

Kayo's mom is such a bitch. What's worse is there are people out there like this. So sad. 

I didn't know a cartoon could make me feel these feels!
>> ARTICLE
The end of every episode has, until this one, absolutely slayed me. I cannot help but feel that this is the calm before the storm. I am not an emotional person, but I felt some tears trying to spill out when Kayo was greeted with a loving breakfast instead of disregard she had probably endured her whole life.

The teacher has too much knowledge of the childrens' whereabouts. That's why he's the most suspicious one to me.

I'm tied between wanting to keep watching and risk bad things happening or just drop the show now and pretend that it ends with Kayo joining their family, best mom "taking care" of worst mom and since no one has died yet, everyone lives happily ever after.
>> ARTICLE
I just have this feeling that the teacher is being made to seem like the killer. I think the character that was in the bus was the teacher. The kick showed he was angry and I think the real culprit is making the teacher do all this stuff to make him in the end look like the killer. The teacher just seems too obvious of a choise. Even from the very beginning Satoru's mother remembers some person that was the real culprit. It all points to the teacher. And I think it's all just a big setup.
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck kind of breakfast is cup ramen and a piece of bread? I'd cry too

Edit: My bad, those were different days. So one day was just a piece of bread :(
>> ARTICLE
The kind of breakfast you'd get from an abusive mother who doesn't really care.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, another great episode as per usual. I'm really glad that Kayo is safe, at least as of this episode.

That scene where Kayo starts having flashbacks to the shitty meals that her own mother prepared for her and started crying was so emotional. Truly a master piece.

Also, I'm glad to finally have been to a place featured in an anime! I visited Japan 3 years ago and managed to visit Mount Hakodate, and the view is captured really well in the anime.

[Here's a photo I took during the trip](http://i.imgur.com/uYTaznr.jpg). Sorry for shit quality
>> ARTICLE
It's looking like the killer is Yashiro-sensei. It's strange though, he's doing normal things that a teacher would do in that situation (save for not contacting the police) but it shady as fuck how much screen time the dude gets.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah he's the only person to really suspect right now but maybe it's a fake out?
>> ARTICLE
I swear by the fucking mystery gods that the sensei should be nothing more than a red herring for the audience.



If this was anyone's first step into a mystery medium they would say it's the teacher, but to anyone whose aware of the cliches of mystery, the teacher at this point seems like a red herring.


That said it's episode 8 already....why wouldn't they introduce the murderer already? Which means they probably did and the only damn guy that looks like the murderer is the damn teacher.

This show really knows how to display how child abuse truly robs a person of happiness. What amazing development. Teared up more times than I'd like to admit
>> ARTICLE
When Satoru said "Yeah" and his mom heard him, my husband and I both started cracking up. I'm so glad this episode didn't end badly, but I'm super worried about next week now. Like, if they didn't cliffhanger me this week, they must be saying "sorry" about what they're about to do. Right? 

And teacher was seeming less suspicious today, but who else could it possibly be? Yuuki was in jail when mom was killed, Kenya is, seriously, just a kid right now (and thus physically too immature to go around abducting people even if he's mentally capable), and the mom doesn't match the person kicking the box. It can't be manager, since he was talking to the killer, and I don't see why ex-coworker newsperson would help Satoru at all if it were him.
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else start tearing up when Kayo started crying? That scene when she she begins to compare her breakfasts with what Satoru is having, that was so powerful. Something so small, but the comparison was made and all those years of pent up anger, sadness, wondering why her mother didn't love her like Satoru's does, it all comes out there. It just destroyed me. Live Kayo! Save her Satoru!!
>> ARTICLE
From the earlier episodes, I've constantly been thinking that the teacher is the murderer.  He's just so incredibly fishy that I'm 50% sure he's the scumbag.

The reason I say 50% is because I'm also getting a red herring sense here; they're making it seem as though he's the murderer, when in reality, it's someone completely different.

Though, that additional phone call makes me wonder about who he was calling-- was it the murderer that he was calling, and he's just helping?  It would make sense since he's a trusted figure whom nobody would suspect, and is able to gather so much information. 

My other thought is that it's potentially Kenya who's the killer.  I feel like he could also be someone with 'revival' capabilities, too. He just seems way too astute for someone his age, and too aware of what Satoru is thinking and planning at all times.  Perhaps he is sent back from the future whenever Satoru revives in order to stop him from protecting Kayo (even though it seems like he's helping?) 

All I know for sure is that the scene wherein Kayo cries after having a taste of just a day without a psychotic, abusive mother really got me.  Each day, her mother would give her a slice of bread, or just some money to get her own food, sufficing to explain that Kayo's mom didn't care about her at all.  Then, with Sachiko providing a steaming, hearty meal right away was too much.

I'm expecting death next episode.  This trend of happiness is coming to an end. 
>> ARTICLE
This show has my favorite female characters, and I do hope other studios take notes on how to write strong female leads.

Edit: Oh gosh, Hinazuki finally breaking at the end of the episode when shown compassion from Satoru's mother broke me fundamentally

Damn my heart went from lewd, from checking out Satoru's mom in bath, to laughing at her cock blocking. Then finally shattered when Kayo started crying.

This show is not good for me. :(

This show fucks with my feelings omg. When she was flashing back about breakfast ;_; 

And what about Aya or whatever that girl's name is that he bumped into? He doesn't seem like he cares too much about her outcome

also that scene where the mother is laying between them omg. I needed some comedic relief. 

Still think the teachr is shady. 
>> ARTICLE
After watching this ending I just want to take this opportunity to absolutely praise the crap out of the ED. After listening to it today it seemed so much happier than, what I swear is, the normal soul piercing tune. In fact I had to load up a previous ep to compare. 

The ED perfectly depicts melancholy and joy when it needs to, which I find so very clever. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't handle it. This anime is the only one I can think of where I get physically tense watching each episode.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck dude, Kayo breaking down like that was hard to watch. Like real hard 
>> ARTICLE
the fact that he failed to notice the second abduction victim probably means there'll be another Revival sometime in the future? Although I'm curious how far he'll get this time. 

Episode tryna convince me sensei isn't evil but i ain't fooled

this was a beautiful episode.

it reflects so much on how horrible hinazuki's living conditions were. having a properly made breakfast instead of money left on the table to buy a loaf of bread.. so much feeels

also I giggle a little when a 29yo can cry and catch feelings. It's such a sticky/bordeline subject for love.

and satoru's mom is literally the best ever bar none.

This episode made me realize, *[I want to protect that smile](http://i.imgur.com/Wh8p0nZ.jpg)*.

Not just Kayo's, but child-Satoru's as well, and if there's anything [episodes 3 had shown us](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-3-notes/), which last week's episode had reiterated again, Satoru's still a child, and was never allowed to grow up. Well, seeing him in this happy situation, and Kayo as well, and I'd like them to be suspended in it forever, warm and fluffy and everything.

I guess this is a good way to make us care for the tension and thriller - you can make us care because it's just well-directed, but it always works better when we supply the dread on our own, and the show just feeds into it. We supply it on our own because we sympathize with these kids, and want them to have a happy life. A life without cliffhangers. On that note, I'm very happy this episode didn't actually end on a cliffhanger, and no, that final confrontation doesn't fill me with tension. I mean, does anyone here think Satoru's mother can't control the situation? I suspect that the teacher raised the option of Kayo staying with the Fujinumas, *indefinitely*, and perhaps this confrontation is to get Kayo's mother to agree, before the Child Care Agency will take her away.

On that note, the pajamas Satoru's mother bought. On the one hand, it could be seen as her indeed aiming for them to keep Kayo with them. On the other, it could've just been her being kind to a child she thought might need a warm pair of pajamas, or that might end at her household for a couple of days. Neither of which is important, not as important as the realization Satoru reached, [that he's easy to see through](http://i.imgur.com/HQWMfAE.jpg). Teacher saw through him being calm, and [through him exchanging glances with Kenya](http://i.imgur.com/jveAPP4.jpg). His mother had endless hints.

But here's where it gets serious - Satoru is easily seen through, which means the killer might see through him as well. Last week I discussed how scary it is that after he said he mustn't do it, Satoru went off of the charted past. What could he have done? Laid a trap for the murderer as he came for Kayo in her house or at the playground. And even this week, no observation of the bus and the murderer's tools. What do we have? A kid who's happy about his success, about his warm and comfy environment, and who shuts his eyes to the danger all around him.

Last episode it was a bit crazy, that he said he shouldn't do something and then went and did it even so. This episode though, this episode should've brought to mind that the murders should keep going on even if he saves Kayo. And what will you do with that, Satoru? Right now it doesn't seem as if you're planning to do anything - just be content that you succeeded - that you saved one person, out of three. And maybe saved your mother, but how would you know anyway?

Satoru speaks of being surrounded by the circle of murders, so rather than undo it, he merely moves away from it. The show will obviously force him to actually tackle things head on, but he's avoiding it as much as he can. [He's a kid who feels like an accomplished superhero](http://i.imgur.com/6YgMext.jpg), so he's letting [the warm atmosphere lull him](http://i.imgur.com/6wi30Tj.jpg) - he's on a camping trip, to an abandoned schoolbus, to an abandoned childhood.

Speaking of forward-momentum, [while the episode started with White Riding Hood](http://i.imgur.com/b0LBmY9.jpg) (:P), it led onto Cinderella, [where Satoru was given his second hint as to the killer's identity](http://i.imgur.com/gNFNXEg.jpg). The first, if you forgot, is that the killer actually knows Hiromi is a boy, and not a girl, though that's only a hypothesis.

But man, this episode didn't have much "proper tension", but it was cute and warm and fluffy, and thus the meta-tension, the *dread* mounted up. Because the more invested I am in those two kids, and the comfier things are, the more tense I am for what is to come, for what *must* come.

***

With that said, some smaller asides.

1) [Here's a collection of screenshots I grabbed this episode](http://imgur.com/a/pgNLy), most are pretty and show the nice shot-framing of the show. A couple however are relatively [off-model/low on details](http://i.imgur.com/P2g3kiF.jpg), especially for characters shown from a distance. Not indicative of the show thus far for the most part, and unfortunate.

2) [This moment](http://i.imgur.com/SkWaWp7.jpg) was [the show's](http://i.imgur.com/ZAJ4DSp.jpg) biggest [shock/surprise thus far](http://i.imgur.com/CelIjyh.jpg) ;-)

3) [I liked how Satoru's mother trusted him](http://i.imgur.com/bN5xMal.jpg). It went alongside how she told Kayo's mother her son is a good boy, and counter to how she didn't trust him later. Then again, it helps she figured out what was going on, that he's trying to protect a friend. So it's possible she didn't believe him later with Jun because she figured he's just trying to protect a friend again.

4) Here's something Satoru probably didn't realize - [his actions affect others](http://i.imgur.com/xijvVM4.jpg). His mother woke up early because he did. She gave up sleep for him. Others notice what you do, and change their actions based on that. Which ties into the main message, but I wanted to point it out again with relation to that.

5) [This shot was amusing](http://i.imgur.com/qJurWtx.jpg), but really, being taken away from the only family she's ever had, and from the friends she just made, it's understandable.

([Check out my blog](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/) or [the specific page for all my write-ups on BokuMachi/ERASED](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-notes/) if you enjoy reading my stuff.)

The teacher's hamster wheel is in the shows ed. Doesn't necessarily mean his the killer (the paper airplanes are their too) but it seems significant.

Wow, an episode where our happiness didn't get completely crushed at the end.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like if I were to watch this show from start to finish without the weekly breaks we're having now, I'd say I'd be crying way more than Anohana ever did. 

I'm not getting worked up because of it being sad in the normal sense of someone dying or terrible loss. It's sad because Kayo never got to have so many things that Satoru appreciates every single day. Warm food ready at the table, a caring mother who loves her child, a comfortable environment to be a kid and live... Seeing Kayo truly realize the shit she's been going through is what is really just sad. 

This is especially true because these characters are just kids, and even though Satoru is technically 29, he's dealing with these kids who would/are reacting to their situations just how kids would. I find this so moving because Satoru himself is realizing that, despite being the brain of a 29 year old, he really is still mother's son, he is still someone to be cared for, he is still a child in a sense. 

God damn I love this show.

So we didn't see who it was that came into the bus. I'll assume probably the killer then.

There's some spoopy stuff in the bag.

Please let this work out. Kayo deserves all the happiness. She even cried because she was so happy to get a decent meal.

The beginning of this episode stressed me out.

Damn, Kayo being moved by having a complete breakfast made me cry

That breakfast scene was one of the most powerful, self contained scenes I have seen in an anime. Seriously, it helped explain by itself what all this poor girl had to live with, been so young and not knowing what the true love of a mother is. Just by showing how she reacted to breakfast, and remembering how it used to be. That scene was perfect.

And that's without counting the rest of the episode. What an incredible show.
>> ARTICLE
A ending where I'm not fearing for the life of another character?!? THANK HEAVENS!!!
>> ARTICLE
This is probably the most heartbreaking episode so far, I actually teared up at the breakfast scene, it was just SO SAD. The last time I was this immersed while watching a weekly anime was probably Parasyte the maxim, it is just so perfect, it is very obvious that every scene is well thought of. I can't wait to see how everything is going to end (although I don't want to stop enjoying this masterpiece)

I have that bad feeling, that their leaving us with a more positive cliff hanger but, shits still gonna get wack next episode. We still have 4 more episodes, would not surprise me if there is one more twist in the plot.

Everyone saying how the ending to the episode was so great but I'm just sitting here thinking something real bad will happen.

Wow its been a while since I've seen an anime this good.

That scene when Kayo started crying at the end got me really choked up it was very well done. In fact, all of her emotions are so well done. She has a wall put up I guess as a mental self defense but we are seeing her gradually warm up. From laughing in the bathtub when being tickled to seeing her comfortable snoozing in the morning.

I love it.

And I get this feeling that their teacher is the psycho murderer. If that's the case then Satoru is in for quite a shock because it seems he fully trusts the teacher.
>> ARTICLE
This show stresses me out... And I love it 
>> ARTICLE
There's just something special about this show. I almost never *ever* cry because of a show like this, but now I do it pretty much every week. There's just something about child abuse, man. 

Also, I have to give this show major props for having a bath scene that wasn't remotely fanservice-y, was essential to the plot, and didn't feel out of place. Take notes, people: this is how you make a scene with naked characters that doesn't feel sexual. 
>> ARTICLE
Yashiro sensei is really suspicious, but the only reason why I don't think it's him is because Satoru saw the killer when he was getting arrested. Satoru gets all riled up when he sees stuff that has to do with the murders so why doesn't he get mad when he sees the teacher?

[Seeing this animated was hnnnnnnng](http://i.imgur.com/Bukgg6J.png)

Also, [trolololol](http://i.imgur.com/su6VeY5.png)

But anyways, as a manga reader, I'm very skeptical of how the anime is going to finish on time with the manga. When the first Episode came out, I was like "Wow, they covered 6 chapters but the pacing wasn't bad at all...guess this is a show that I'll watch even though I already read it." 

But this Episode was less than two chapters. The end of this Episode is pretty much the end of Chapter 23. How are they going to fit 20+ Chapters into the remaining 4 Episodes without making it feel rushed?

There is so much material to cover :/.

Now thats the _kind_ of cliffhangers I would like to see!

Having read the manga, I still can't help but feel like it's going to be rushed or maybe cut out, or even worse - both. A-1, pls don't fuck up.

That aside, it was a great episode yet again. I believe the cliffhanger shouldn't have that much of an effect as the prevous one. God, I can already see that March is going to be the longest month this year!

Wow, an episode ending without a life-or-death cliffhanger?  What's going on here?

No clue what the MC's mother intends to do here.  Make Kayo's mother promise to be good and leave Kayo with her?  Can't be.

Kayo so narrowly escaped death during that "visitation".  And MC is not gonna do anything with the fact that he found the killer's storage?

Teacher is doing his best to stop being the prime suspect, I'm even having doubts now.  But who did he call?
>> ARTICLE
Is it just me or does anyone else want to know what kayo looks like as an adult?
>> ARTICLE
This may seem crazy but I am just throwing this out there.

I think the killer may be Yuuki's father. I will be sorta mad if that is the case tho because they haven't really talked about him at all throughout this show and I feel like introducing him now would be a giant "HEY IM THE KILLER" flag. We shall see tho.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god I feel so sorry for Kayo ;-; 

I got really nervous when Satoru's mom called the teacher, I don't completely trust him... (although, I don't really trust anyone in this anime except for Satoru and Kayo.)

This anime is so fucking good, i got shivers down my spine TWO TIMES. I got goosebumps twice in a span of 30 mins, that has NEVER HAPPENED before.

>> ARTICLE
My bet is on the teacher being the killer.
He's had my suspicion for a while, but the "as a matter of fact, I know she's safe" line clinched it, especially since it was right after the scene in the bus. That cunt knows she's safe because he knows he hasn't killed her yet, and he knows where she is because of the bus scene.


The teacher is the only one with easy access to all the students, and the most trusted party by our main characters. This puts him in the perfect position to kill the kids without getting caught.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn that breakfast scene
>> ARTICLE
Why was the third murder victim introduced, and with such ominous accompanying music to boot? This means she will be relevant, but I hope not in the way she was before. I fear the killer is so well-prepared that, even if there's a happy ending, someone will have to go down.

Also, it seems about time for Satoru to freak out about one of his friends being the ~~second~~ third murder victim. If the show wasn't this close to ending, I would guess this iteration of the loop would fail, as he's keeping only Kayo safe. To beat the time loops, he normally should either keep everyone safe or expose the murderer.

Lastly, it is an unbelievable coincidence that the killer just so happens to hide his murder tools in the same bus they are hiding Kayo. Were this not to be a coincidence, this would mean someone in Satoru's circle of friendahem, Kenyais working with the killer. However, I fail to see how the killer would benefit from doing what he did, so perhaps it is a coincidence after all.

EDIT: read replies
>> ARTICLE
I think that was the second victim actually. Their friend, the guy who looks like a girl was the third if I'm not mistaken. Either way, I think it's a sign that the killer is being forced to kill her next. Because now he can't reasonably get to Hinazuki. Even if she was girl 3, the friend was only killed to be a decoy, so going to be safe until at least one person is murdered.

Omg I almost cried at the end when they ate breakfast it's so sad and heartwarming at the same time KAYO 2016!
>> ARTICLE
I feel like a dog who has been hit too many times. They're giving me something nice, so they must plan on using it to better break my heart :(
>> ARTICLE
I suspect the killer may have known Kayo was in the bus, or at least, noticed that some things about his hideout had changed. I think he was angry because 1. He failed to kidnap Kayo. 2. He thinks he got found out, or that somebody is using his hideout, now he has to go somewhere else. 3. Kayo is no longer isolated, somebody knows he plans to kidnap her, and if she goes missing people will notice. That's why, even though she is just sitting in his bus, he can't take her. It would get him caught. 

It's possible that he didn't notice anything was wrong with his hideout, but that's wishful thinking. The killer is very smart, but also very impulsive. He watched Satoru get arrested, he looked Satoru in the eyes after killing his mother, and he angrily kicked the box in his hideout.

I think we found our winner for mother of the year

I DIDNT KNOW I COULD FEEL THIS MANY FEELS! ;_;

The breakfast scene definitely pulled at my heartstrings, but what really got me was when Satoru's mom reached out and Kayo flinched. To think about how she's been primed to expect pain from the touch of another person is just heart-wrenching to me. Damn.
>> ARTICLE
can somebody tell me.. why Satouru was really pissed off when he saw the briquette?? i can't seem to understand...
>> ARTICLE
Man, it's been a long time since an anime made me that hyped. It's unreal. This week's episode was all chill and feels though, not that I'm complaining of course. I get a feeling this was the palate cleaner we need for an endless barrage of grief and hype on the home stretch!  
As for that other girl who was set to be kidnapped, I was a bit surprised that Satoru just shrugged off the thought. I guess he realised there really was not much he could do at the moment, coupled with the more pressing relocation issue and the fact he barely knew her and all.  
Also, I'm continuously impressed by this show's extremely effective way of conveying feelings through framing, sounds, music and subtle animation quirks. I mean, some sequences are just amazing like Kayo's breakfast flashbacks or the super tense pause between the box being open and Satoru's face tensing up while the duct tape rolls over and tumbles at his feet.  
Someone also mentioned the children animate superbly as well, and I agree. Plus they might be pretty much the only children I empathize with in anime, as they are all pretty believable and sweet, yet expectedly immature characters (save for Satoru, most of the time at least lol, and in some ways Kenya).
>> ARTICLE
Its funny how the Teacher, when asked about Kayo, refused to call the police at least twice in this episode...
>> ARTICLE
The breakfast scene made me bawl holy crap.
>> ARTICLE
Started BibleThump-ing at the breakfast scene. How can a simple episode be so sad?

And finally, not a heavy cliffhanger at the end. I feel justice will soon be served. FeelsGoodMan

Things would have been a lot less stressful if they went with Plan B to begin with!

Episode 8 was phenomenal. I loved it. It's been a really long time since I've rooted this much for a character. Kayo crying near the end was so bittersweet. I can't even imagine what it would be like living like she used to do with her mother.

This episode really made me think that Erased has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in an anime.

I really can't wait for this coming month to see how it all will end. I'm so happy that this anime will be released in Europe, a definite buy when it releases.
>> ARTICLE
Gaah! They're playing with my feelings so much. So much laugh and then I'm trying not to cry... Well, if this isnt 10/10 show, what can it be? 

And about the teacher. For some moment I was completly sure he's innocent, and a minut later I couldn't be sure anymore. This is so annoying.

BTW Satoru's mum is the best mum in the world.
>> ARTICLE
Fucking cliffhangers man. Gets my heart racing as our mystery guest walks on the bus, only to have them kick Solid Snake and walk right out. This show is giving me high blood pressure.

I'm still not sure about their teacher. Something about him seems rather manipulative, and I don't trust the dude. But I think it's a red herring designed to make us question his motives. I guess we'll see!
>> ARTICLE
God damn what a comfy episode.

Satoru and his mom going all out in the battle to protect Kayo's smile.
>> ARTICLE
I want to give Kayo a big hug.
>> ARTICLE
I might be a little late in deciding this but my suspicions that the teacher is the killer from last episode were cemented this episode. He's the one who knew Kayo's situation the longest. Two of his students were victims. He might be a frequent customer/friends with Yuki's family which makes it easy to steal something like boots to try and frame him or whatever. He's likely acquainted with the police because of the times he's reported Kayo's situation. He decided to kill her because he couldn't help but exploit her vulnerability and once he got a taste of blood he kept killing.

Hiromi wasn't the one he killed to throw the police off. It was that Aya girl. He didn't kill Hiromi so that the police would think that he did it to throw them off the pattern of killing little girls. He killed Aya to hide his intentions of killing his students. He's even less of a suspect to the police because he's embedded in their minds that he's a caring teacher who's distraught about how social services and him couldn't save Kayo before the murderer got to her first.
>> ARTICLE
Alrighty hot damn. So now Satoru is going full Conan mode, isnt he? Adult trapped in a kids body saving souls out here. Since he already has his two girls and squad, all he needs now is a mad scientist friend and arsenal of futuristic tech.

Oh hey there it looks like this episode didn't end on a cliffhanger that made me pull fucking patches of my hair out whaddayano hahahaha something bad's gonna happen isn't it.

Kayo's squad rolling up at the end literally made me fist pump and finally an episode that ended on a high!
>> ARTICLE
I have to also say that I've been so satisfied with this show so far, that if inexplicably, the last 4 episodes are recaps or onsen episodes or Gundam Seed Destiny re-runs, I'd STILL give it an 8/10. 
>> ARTICLE
We have noticed your enjoyment of the show and have decided to release 8 more episodes... That are exactly the same
>> ARTICLE
I can't feel happy during this show anymore, I'm so paranoid that everything will immediately go to shit during a happy scene :(
>> ARTICLE
I had to pause every two minutes to wonder why my heart hadn't broken yet. It was kind of surreal to have an episode with zero horrific gutpunches and without a massive cliffhanger. Though I will admit my heart dropped when it showed the outside of Kayo's house.

I just keep rewatching the breakfast scene just because of how beautifully heartbreaking it is.

Im like 99% sure it is Yashiro.

What was with the part where Satoru walked pass the girl outside the school with the tag. It showed the frame with the tag for a good 5 seconds trying to tell the viewers something. What was it

Aya (the name of the girl) is supposedly the next target of the serial killer

Hey, has anyone ever wondered who all those girls in the ending video are? It's strange because they don't look anyone on the show

That was the happiest, saddest episode I've ever seen. Holy shit!
>> ARTICLE
2 options; either the teacher is the killer or it's supposed to be so obvious its him that we start resenting him then it turns out someone else is the killer and the teacher happens to sacrifice himself saving the kids, that way we feel like shit for thinking it was him.
>> ARTICLE
If teach does turn out to be the killer I'll be legitimately impressed; they've made it so obvious from the very first episode that I don't seriously believe he could be the killer at all.

This ep bruised me in the feels and just kept kicking.

Don't worry, it doesn't really give much away...I don't think. Though it'll probably make more sense once the series ends (assuming they even leave that stuff in, since at the rate we're going...).
>> ARTICLE
This show is making me realize I should really appreciate the things I have in my life. The small things like food, a warm place to sleep, and and roof over my head.

It also helps me appreciate and love my mother even more (I already cared about her, but after watching this, I feel like I haven't done enough to thank her). Same goes for my close friends and my father. Seeing Kayo cry over the home cooked breakfast tore me up inside.


>> ARTICLE
Darn, the cuteness is gonna kill me! And the anxiety will give me ulcers!

Well it was great to see things going well for once, though I think going to visit her mother alone was pretty stupid. They needed to bring the cops or social services, what if the boyfriend's there and they decide to get violent. And I'm not sure that's enough to take the girl away.

I'm not sure what to think about the bath scene. I was showing this series to non-anime watchers and I guess I'll have to explain japanese conventions on bathing together now...it doesn't help that Satoru seems to have other things in mind either.

The murderer so close, I'm still thinking the teacher's too suspicious to be the real killer but this time I was suspecting almost everyone. Kenya keeps acting weird too between scenes but he's too young to be the killer here.

Can't Satoru's mom adopt the Hinazuki? That'd be so great!
>> ARTICLE
Seeing Kayo cry towards the end also made me cry, and i knew it was coming cause ive read the manga, but damn that shit was powerful.
>> ARTICLE
Really curious about the meeting with that guy. I think they should've scheduled it in the morning with Kayo.

Also Jesus, the emotions, I was about to cry when I saw the cup noodles and bread then transitioning to the nice warm meal.
>> ARTICLE
Every once in a while it is nice to have a happy episode without a really suspenseful ending.

Anyone else wondering how some of the stuff seen in the ending come into play? More specifically those fantasy looking characters. Great episode though.

As an orphan who was never bothered by not having any parents, Satoru's mom sure is making me think about what could have been

Ohh, finally, an episode I can get a smile of.

That scene when Kayo was crying was so touching. I cried a little ^^lot
>> ARTICLE
One, I hate this show for the emotions it tears out of my soul.

Two, I hate finding it so early, now I have to wait every week for a new episode instead of watching it all at once.

Three, I'm pretty sure the teacher might be the killer.

Oh man. That might be the cutest thing I've ever seen, and it ends on a *positive* cliffhanger too? This episode left me replaced the angst for bad shit with happy stuff, I dig it. 

Also, mom is a wizard confirmed

I'm really fond of the ongoing gag that Satoru's mom is a Yokai.

But man, this show is just not healthy at all for my stress levels. I always feel like something bad is going to happen at any time. 

Such a heartwarming episode just feels weird (in a good way!)
>> ARTICLE
That beginning was scary as fuck. Like I was watching a horror film of sorts. And the second half where Satoru and Kayo are just relaxing at home normally was so sweet! I Especially love the part where Kayo was crying over having an actual breakfast for once. Almost made me want to cry. :')

Next episode's hopefully gonna bring some well deserved justice over that bitch of a mother. But now I'm really eager to find out who the fuck is this murderous dude and what's his deal with Kayo?
>> ARTICLE
Did any one else hear a faint revival tune a little after that guy kicked the box? 

I'm guessing that officially means the past was changed.

God damnit I had to pause the show because I was tearing up in the Cafeteria.

Thank god she didn't get killed or something at the start.

Wow, they did so well with the scene with Kayo looking at breakfast, then pans over to what she usually had, and then back to everyone watching silently then comforting her. Man, the music was on point for that too.

Happy ending pls, I want Kayo to have  a happy life T_T

fantastic ep, but I was a little confused on what happened at the start. The killer walks into the bus and doesn't see kayo? Was she hidden in a locked segment or what? He did go inside and kicked a box.
>> ARTICLE
Has anyone confirmed if this show is getting the a second cour ("second season"), at this pace seems to be ending on a cliff hanger especially with some of the upcoming arcs. Doesn't seem to make much sense to have a show with high production quality with the manga just ended (not to mention the expensive staff they hired for this).

HOLY SHIT ITS MY BOSS

Ok so I have this mentality with this show and it is "this is too easy. Something bad has to happen." That didn't happen this week. My heart man, this episode was so heartwarming. That first minute was scary but otherwise I was smiling. 

This show does everything so well. They don't spell out Kayo was abused but they show it through visual cues. Satoru's mom comes in for a head pat, but Kayo believes it's a slap, so she flinches. That breakfast scene, too. Not only was that a beautiful scene but the way it showed the eggs then transitioned to the ramen and bread then to Kayo alone eating the bread in the park. This show shows Kayo's past life and how she dealt with it and compares it to how she's living now so well. 

Kayo crying over the eggs because she never had a loving family, asking to sleep over at Satoru's, that laughing "Baka Nano", when Kayo finally gave Satoru the gloves she promised to give him because she didn't die. This is all so good. Mind you, I'm sensing some bad shit is about to go down but sensing it doesn't make my heart ready for that shock. 

Also, I have an idea of who the killer might be. I won't ask anyone if I'm right or delve into theories because I want to see it unfold myself, but if I am correct, I'll be mad.

AOTS easy pick

Episode 2 continues to be a friggin amazing adaptation of the manga, thus far.

In particular, the "oops I said that out loud" scenes where both the adult and child voice actors speak over each other, are incredibly well done.

I think Satoru seeing his mother again hit me even harder in the anime version. Probably had something to do with the music in that scene. 

I also think Aoi Yuuki is doing a great job voicing Hinazuki who is literally leaping out of the pages of the manga and into the anime. She's exactly how I imagined her sounding.

If I had one complaint, I do feel the Crunchyroll translator could have left it as "Famicom" (the spoken dialogue) instead of "Nintendo", but I guess that comes down to how aggressive you want to be about naturalizing a script for the Western audience.
>> ARTICLE
Everything about this anime so far has been great, the music, the characters, the animation, the premise, etc...

Also when the subtitles said "Nintendo" I was like "what? when did they say that?"
>> ARTICLE
"Episode 2 continues to be a friggin amazing adaptation of the manga, thus far."

I really hope you're right and I just have the timline jumbled in my head because I've been mad about whats been left out both times, but I can't ask my friends if they remember it differently because nobody else I am watching it with has read it.
>> ARTICLE
You could always go back and reread the first few chapters of the manga.

But, most importantly, even if the anime hasn't adapted every plot point it has completely captured the feeling of the manga. Also, it's been beautiful  animation-wise, and the voice actors are great. I really couldn't be happier so far.
>> ARTICLE
I was surprised that manga is still ongoing, are there signs of it ending anytime soon? Becouse I feel like I will pick it up soon, but it would be painfull if I had to wait like 2 more years for the story to end.

Yes.

Damn I hope we can have some closure with this then, I'd hate if they left us hanging with a mistery like this.

You have no idea how happy I am about that.  
I'm really liking this so far and having it not finish would really be a bummer, especially for a mistery anime.  
>> ARTICLE
NES or Famicom, does it really matter? You can still hear Famicom in the spoken dialogue if it's important to you to know what was intended.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just on the side of avoiding unnecessary confusion when translating spoken English words in anime dialogue. To me, it takes me out of the show to clearly hear Famicon, yet read Nintendo because the translator thinks I'm not cultured enough to know what a Famicon is.
>> ARTICLE
>oops I said that out loud

I dont really get why that was bad... It didn't seem like an embarrassing line to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I think by "I decided not to lie to you" it's meant to imply "you're the only one I show my true self to" or something like that...maybe the translation is less obvious than in japanese. I dunno, I was confused for there too.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm... I'm just having a hard time understanding why a 29 y/o dude would be embarrassed to say anything to an elementary schooler. It's like, dude you're 29, where is the elder-minor relationship here. It's like he's accepted that he's 10 and they are equals again. Then again, I guess she was more embarrassed than he was. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, while I imagine that everyone knows what a Nintendo is, I don't think Famicom would've been *that* bad to leave in. If it's from the medium and part of the 'era' that why not leave it in?
>> ARTICLE
I mean, he changed "Heisei umare" (people born in the Heisei era, i.e. after 1989, anywhere between 1989 and today) to "Gen Y", which is not the same but easier to understand for westerners. With that in mind, of course he'd translate Famicom to Nintendo, since not a lot of people would get what Famicom is, just as with the Heisei period.

Though, don't you feel it's a bit rushed compared to the manga? I was imagining some scenes a lot slower. The first discussion between Kayo and Satoru goes way too fast, I imagine the scene would be slower for a more dramatic effect (of "what did she just say?"). Though I know they haven't got a lot of time on their hands with so few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, music, voicing and cinematography really adds a lot of emotion over a similar scene in manga. I would say the big edge manga has over anime is really for really violent or explicit scenes which would otherwise get censored a bit for anime.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I'm more on the side which does not like localization much. Generally speaking, I feel when you're consuming a foreign media, you're supposed to know some cultural background. But I do agree that the line is pretty subjective and even for me the line is not on the strictest end.

What I'm getting to is that I do agree with you here, but as somebody abouve me poined out, I'd have no idea what 'Heisei era' means.

That being said, there is a difference which I'd like to point out and that is if anything, media should be internationalized and not americanized. But I'm getting slightly off tangent from relevance to this episode. It's just something I wanted to share.
>> ARTICLE
What about Dragon Quest? I have some of the older games and they were called Dragon Warrior back then. Does the manga say accordingly?

It's not that important, just curious.

That's the only case of "localization" I understand. It would be a pretty old reference most people wouldn't understand. Hell, I wouldn't understand it if I hadn't known about (S)NES - the console I had was called Pegasus... basically same games - Mario, TMNT, Chip'n'Dale, Contra and so on. But it was some kind of Soviet/post-Soviet remake/rebranding.

Making use of anime as a medium.

I loved the cinematography with the film reels, it worked really well. The way both VAs say his lines at some points is pretty unique too, very well acted on both their parts.

So far this is a beautifully produced series, I hope it continues this way. I'm loving the story and intrigue, and how it's unfolding.

I've always dreamt of going back in time in this way, this is both wish-fulfillment *and* a big twist on that desire. In my mind it would always be to go back with the knowledge and hindsight to do better, but here he has a very urgent mission, as it were. Really enjoying this so far. Good show!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree, i'm sure all of us had that thought of going back in time and this anime has executed that simple concept brilliantly well so far.
>> ARTICLE
 Yeah, the cinematography  make it so compelling. The small touches in the direction of the show adds a lot to a lot of mundane elements. Small wayward glances, the first person perspective of the protagonist  (as in actually feeling like looking through his eyes, not just in a narrative sense), the slightly unnerving camera angles, it really adds a lot.

I think the smart one in his group is somehow onto him or knows that he is different. He was kinda surprised when MC suggested to go to their hideout despite of their agreement not to when it snows.
>> ARTICLE
> I think the smart one in his group is somehow onto the him or knows that he is different.

I'm kind of hoping he confronts the MC about it (if the MC slips up again)so I can see how the MC handles it.
>> ARTICLE
MC will slip up again...

You can't just act like a elementary school kid when you are indeed 18 years older and just went back with no preparation.

On the other hand the other side is a young kid too...he could just not think that anything about MC changed. 
>> ARTICLE
> You can't just act like a elementary school kid when you are indeed 18 years older

Logically, yes, but this is just a show so anything can happen, or the side characters may not point it out.

>young kid too...he could just not think that anything about MC changed

Yeah, but the MC describes him to be smart, and he acts very very mature for his age too. I'm kind of expecting him to notice something, or even help the MC achieve his goal without knowing the whole truth. Actually, I kind of hope the other kids in his group help him somehow throughout the course of the show, kind of how his friend set him up to meet with Kayo.
>> ARTICLE
He has [his own frame in the OP](http://i.imgur.com/sgQN4bd.jpg) and judging in what context this frame was put, we can't be to sure about what this shot actually means. What we can be sure of is that he will play a bigger role in this story.
>> ARTICLE
Just a guess, but I feel like the MC saving the girl is going to somehow result in Kenya dying. (since his eyes are scratched out in that shot). Kind of like equivalent exchange or the butterfly effect but maybe not exactly.
>> ARTICLE
Since they showed multiple people with their eyes crossed out including adults I'm guessing those photos are the list of prime suspects. Kenya definitely knows something is up with Satoru's lack of knowledge on what he should already know.

I read the manga so I'm excited for the show and how they'll present the storyline.
>> ARTICLE
One thing stood out to me about him immediately. Maybe it's nothing, but take a look at his [eye color.](http://i.imgur.com/KndiHVx.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Yet Kenya's eyes were red for only that angle, which makes me wonder if there's a factor we haven't considered, such as a power parallel to Revival.
>> ARTICLE
I agree Kenya did seem a little suspicious somehow, but I don't know what to suspect him of exactly. I don't know how he'd know anything about Satoru - I doubt he knows about his Revive ability. It seems to me that he knows a bit about Kayo's situation and what is happening with her - that could also explain his behavior. I'm not saying he's guilty of anything, he might just know more than he's revealed so far. All speculation of course. (Manga readers no spoilers, please!)
>> ARTICLE
Might be a little tinfoil-y but... I wouldn't be surprised if he turned out to be the murderer from episode 1. Look at these cuts and the eye color [1](http://i.imgur.com/C3rw7QB.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/aRJ0eod.png).
>> ARTICLE
Maybe Satoru's story is about his Revive ability

He tipped him off about her story in the compilation, so I have a feeling he already knows that shit's going down in Kayo's household. I don't think he's malicious or anything since he's going out of his way to push Satoru into helping her. That or he's somehow involved in her murder unwillingly and is trying to save her while staying out of the picture.
>> ARTICLE
He's probably just a nice guy but he knows he probably can do nothing about it so he doesn't.
>> ARTICLE
Also, maybe this is just me judging with my western standards, but how on earth did a teacher read her essay and not think "Hmm... maybe this girl has problems, and maybe I should do something to fix them."

Like seriously, that essay is actually extremely dark when you think about it. I know teenagers can get emo and stuff, but wouldn't most people be worried if a 13 year old girls biggest wish is to be alone from everyone?

That kind of thing goes unnoticed way more than people like to imagine.

While a scummy thing, it could be the teachers/school pretending it's not happening to keep appearances that everything is normal lest it ruins their reputation. I remember something similar happening in Koe no Katachi where a bullying problem was similarly given a blind eye.

Lol and that she explicitly mentions getting away from her mom. There are plenty of red flags that Kayo is practically waving around and miraculously none of the adults have noticed them yet or they just don't care.

This show will definitely be my favorite this season, most because of the MC. He just sounds so, *normal*, I always love hearing new VA's in shows, very refreshing to hear. 
>> ARTICLE
Hijacking top comment for a question:

Did they make a logical mistake or is the translation in this part wrong or did I make a mistake on this?

&nbsp;

Kenya asked if MC read the [student composition collection] (http://i.imgur.com/cYCL0GR.jpg). MC says he did [not read](http://i.imgur.com/2OBJuPJ.jpg) it. (Which we know is true because later on he reads it)
So his friend [tells him to read it](http://i.imgur.com/vICZU0A.jpg).

Later on MC while eating dinner with this Mom MC[ thinks that Kenya knows that he \(MC\) got no romantic](http://i.imgur.com/QT3ICFc.jpg) interest in her. Instead he may be concerned **after** [reading her essay](http://i.imgur.com/dOxcNNK.jpg) (which we know now is a cry for help).

&nbsp;

How can this be? I mean if MC has not read the essay as he said how can his friend think that he may worried about her after reading the essay? In my opinion this could only be true of Kenya thinks that MC lied to him about not reading the novel (which is not true).

Could this be some kind of translation error or is the manga different or am I reading to much into this?
>> ARTICLE
I think MC was trying to say "maybe Kenya asked me if I read the book because he thought that her story was why I was watching her". Kenya then tells him to read it after finding out he hasn't because Kenya thinks MC should know what he's getting into.
>> ARTICLE
Oh you mean Kenya was kind of looking out for MC so he does not get  into unknown trouble / danger with showing him how "dark" and "depressing" her life is right now?
>> ARTICLE
kenya is supposed to be the intelligent guy in the group, which satoru (MC) mentioned in a monologue this episode. also seems to be very perceptive, he is noticing small details the mc does (like going to the nurse office with his bag also he points out other stuff).

this is my speculation but there are many things pointing to this from this episode: it seems like kenya knows that kayo (the girl) is having trouble in her life. she has teary eyes (red around her eyes) and bruises which are both very obvious and seeing how kenya is observing satoru he has to notice kayos circumstances, too. kenya probably thinks that satoru is talking to kayo because he wants to help her. the novel/poem is not the only thing pointing out that she needs help.

by asking satoru if he read about the student composition collection, kenya wants "to help satoru to help kayo". after all he is depicted as a smart but passive guy. passive as in he doesn't initiate action but knows what others want to do and tries to help them (i guess by talking mostly or other subtle ways).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm loving it, definitely near the top, I also enjoyed [Shukufuku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo!) quite a bit.
>> ARTICLE
Let's hope he gets more roles! 

This is a stellar performance for his first role.
>> ARTICLE
But not too many roles....I can't hear Matsouka voices anymore after all these harem MCs he voiced in the last 3 seasons. ..
>> ARTICLE
This is my biggest gripe anime today. It's usually not too bad, but there's only so many Kana Hanazawa characters I can hear before they stop being characters and just become Kana Hanazawa instead.
>> ARTICLE
Satoru is one of the best MCs that I've seen in a while. While he doesn't know what exactly is going on, he is far from clueless and is observant and quick to develop to his surroundings.

Very impressed with the character and his VA thus far.
>> ARTICLE
This is a really great example of an MC that is actually good with an skill thanks to "years" of training for it, while not been annoying as fuck. It's clear the experience he has with it and it makes the show much much better than him suddenly realizing what he is capable of.
>> ARTICLE
Yes I share the same sentiment. I love how he's smart enough to be able to ruminate theories and deductions just from stuff he gleaned or saw throughout, even early on (not even a day passed post-Revival point). I've always remembered being frustrated at many MCs for being, most of the time, illogically clueless and making me yell out to the screen.
>> ARTICLE
The show instantly caught my attention when I heard Hinazuki speak.

Aoi Yuuki has such a special voice. I loved her VA in Overlord as Clementine and Flemie in Rokka no Yuusha
>> ARTICLE
She is quite talented for sure. So much so that she seems to sing in insert songs for every other anime she stars in. Also, she is largely known more for very girly and loli style characters, so it really shows how much range she has.
>> ARTICLE
> Flamie in Rokka no Yuusha

#FUCKING SOLD

So far she's had a pretty similar performance to Flamie here, as well. Not that that's a bad thing.

It's a role she fills well, she's very natural at it. I like her a lot from what I've heard.

Thus anime is really really intriguing. Reminds me of Zankyou no Terror a couple seasons back, hooked me from episode 1 to the last. 
>> ARTICLE
> "That's because I decided not to lie to you."

Really loved this and the other instances his voice synced up with his older self, made what he was saying come across a lot more candid.
>> ARTICLE
> new VA's in shows

It's not like he's new. IIRC, he's simply a film actor, and not a voice actor. The director chose him because all the other voices he heard were too "Shonen Jump" and artificial, and wanted something away from that, which I firmly believe is the right decision.

EDIT: For both the child *and* the adult version of our MC. Both are actors...just not *voice* actors.
>> ARTICLE
That is true, I saw that mentioned in the previous discussion, he is new to the VA scene which was what I was mainly meant. 
>> ARTICLE
I see, my bad.

Actors are a hit-or-miss. Sometimes it's an utter failure and it's cringeworthy, but this so far is certainly a great hire. He and she is doing an amazing job for a role they're not used to. Probably fit a lot better than most VAs for this character.
>> ARTICLE
I was actually pretty surprised to find out he was a live action actor, definitely doing a good job so far, hope he gets more roles in the future.

Seems no one mentioned that Kenya changed eye colors...

As someone who doesn't have any clue what's in the manga, I really believe that he is the killer, because the killer seemed to be very smart and this guy is smart as well + red eyes.

edit:  Don't forget that it is an anime, so 10 year old committing a murder is definitely more than possible.
>> ARTICLE
The mom did mention "The killer hadn't been caught" or something like that, last episode. Like she knew who it really was, instead of the guy that got convicted.

Crap I hadn't noticed the red eye thing though, I should pay more attention..
>> ARTICLE
The notion crossed my mind, but I'd like for the anime to maintain a realistic interpretation of how kids behave, unlike most anime. If the main antagonist ended up being a kid, I'd be disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
the moment i heard him talking i knew it. When he went back in time i was thinking that the killer must be a pre teen or kid at that time. Maybe the red eye thing wasnt a "mistake" you know...
>> ARTICLE
damn yall perceptive or something. i thought he just somehow knew about the time traveling shit or something
>> ARTICLE
You should be a detective

After such an amazing first episode, it was going to be hard for the second episode to be as good or better.

The OP was wonderful and the MC is one of the better ones I've seen in ages. While he doesn't have everything figured out, he is actively thinking and constantly adapting to his surroundings. The VA also does an outstanding job. The suspense and mystery that is built up around Satoru and Hinazuki in one single episode is immense and Kenya is another interesting character introduced this episode.

I also loved how Satoru treated his mother in this _revive_. A small detail but still really nice to see as I would have had a different attitude towards my parents if I had a chance to go back in time.

I haven't been this excited for an airing show in a long time.

It's really appealing, simple and straightforward.

The bruises won't be visible unless you get down to a kid's viewpoint. Adults are 2 or 3 times as high as most of these kids so they won't see things on a kid's thigh unless they're looking for them.
>> ARTICLE
Also, I imagine a lot of teachers aren't going to admit to catching a glimpse of a pre-teenage student's thigh above her skirt line. I imagine a lot of people have a pretty optimistic view of the world. Maybe a teacher saw the bruise and just didn't care enough to intervene. Out of sight, out of mind. "Not my problem." "Not worth the trouble."

Also, I think the essay would look like pretty run-of-the-mill 12-year-old angsty kid stuff without the context the viewer has of the situation.

It's easy to mistake the viewer's knowledge for knowledge that should be readily apparent. It's not that straightforward.
>> ARTICLE
That is pretty sad as well.

Even if a teacher pointed it out, he or she would be questioned as to how and why he was looking there. And if the child denies abuse, all you're left with is ruined reputation as some kind of pedophile who ogles pre-teens.

I wouldn't say that the bruises were extremely visible but the essay is a potential giveaway that Kenya was able to notice.

If a student noticed, I'd hope that a staff member would have noticed as well.
>> ARTICLE
If a student notices but no staff member does it makes you wonder if there's something else going on here, maybe the [RAMPANT SPECULATION] blatantly evil teacher has been working to keep Kayo away from any potentially prying eyes. 

That or the author was just really, really, *really* hoping that no one would question this plot point, because it sticks out like a sore thumb.

His jawline does seem pretty similar to the guy who stabbed Satoru's mom
>> ARTICLE
And when she saw the potential abduction happening in episode 1 she said he looked familiar.
>> ARTICLE
It's possible the point of the essay was something like 'write about being on an island' or 'write about something that happened in a good book you read'. Teachers are always looking to praise good content, so if something so 'REAL' and therefore good comes from a student they get a bit focused on the technical brilliance rather than the possible underlying message.

There's enough ways one can explain it I think.
>> ARTICLE
I mean the only blatantly obvious concerning thing was the essay and that alone might have been a one-off incident in the mind of the teacher.

The bruises could have gone undetected by the staff potentially.  
>> ARTICLE
When an elementary kid writes this kind of depressing essay something is clearly wrong if you would compare that story to the 20+ other stories in that class.

Keep in mind that if a child never admits that she is being abused then most of the time help doesn't come. A lot of agencies won't provide help unless you admit to needing it.
>> ARTICLE
This just occurred to me after watching episode 1

You know how the story in episode 1 is set in 2006 right? Wasn't that the period where Asian Kung Fu Generation was really popular with rewrite, haruka kanata etc.? What if they reached out to AKFG for the opening because they wanted  something that was popular and trending then. 

And they made a re-recording of their old song instead of making a new one so that resonates with the 2006 AKFG era. Personally I think that for a show where the premise is about going back in time, the use of the opening to take you on a nostalgia ride is brilliant. It sort of parallels what the MC feels, though to a much lesser degree but it does make us reminisce the past and the things we could have done differently or the what-ifs and events  we could have prevented if we had such power.  Just my take on it.
>> ARTICLE
That makes a lot of sense! I think that Rewrite has an awesome tone to it, I think it would've been a solid pick for the OP as well!
>> ARTICLE
Isn't this based on a manga? That would mean the mangaka knew who was going to do the OP song
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if he had any authority over how the studio decides to go with the story though. And I don't think he will get to choose what song or band he wanted. It would be cool but it would depend on the studio whether they go with the mangaka's wishes. Who knows, maybe we'll find out if they do an interview once the shows over. 
>> ARTICLE
My understanding is that in Japanese copyright law, the original creator actually [has a lot of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_Japan#Author.27s_rights). This was demonstrated in the last arc of Shirobako. I don't think this particular thing was necessarily because of the mangaka's wishes, but it seems possible.
>> ARTICLE
This show has SO much potential. The first episode was solid for setup, and this episode was really good as well. The OP is GREAT too. Let's hope this trend continues upwards, cause I really can't wait for next week.

The voice actress for Hinazuki is certainly borrowing from her performance of Fremy from Rokka no Yuusha.

I even thought Yuuki Aoi was being typecasted, and maybe she is in this particular case, but she also voices characters such as Hikki's sister from OreGairu.
>> ARTICLE
Seems like it. She had a similar role as Akira in Valvrave actually. Though normally when I think Aoi Yuuki I think of Madoka (from, well, Madoka). I think that was her breakthrough, because ever since she's been in more prominent roles and has been displaying a pretty decent range.

She's also Hibiki (Symphogear) & Tatsumaki (OPM)
>> ARTICLE
Now that you've said it, it really is Fremy's voice and performance in Rokka no Yusha, I didn't even realize it myself because I'm so immersed watching the show
>> ARTICLE
Ah thank you! I couldn't get the right character to that voice. Was thinking the complete episode that I know that voice from somewhere.

Her voice suits this distance type of character perfectly.

Or Noel from So Ra No Wo To and Victorique from Gosick. You want young and deadpan? You call Aoi Yuuki.

She can also do pretty good genki girls, hysterical girls tomboy voices too. She is like a next generation Kuwashima Houko.

This show is goooood.

The characterization for Satoru in his younger body is EXCELLENT. [The moment he stepped into the classroom](http://i.imgur.com/vYG0Rh2.jpg) and didn't know where to sit, [the moment he stepped into his old apartment](http://i.imgur.com/OvLMVX2.png) and had this very happy, nostalgic smile, [the moment he got to see his mom](http://i.imgur.com/Ig9m4NJ.jpg) [alive and well](http://i.imgur.com/GyZSBzQ.jpg), all excellently done moments. This is exactly how I would react to all those situations. And [the way he comments on the situation in his mind](http://i.imgur.com/YVRCwj2.png) is just really funny and appropriate. 

Really intrigued by Hinazuki. [She is obviously abused](http://i.imgur.com/dI4geW2.png) by her mother, but she has to hide it, thus, she is also fake, but in a different manner from Satoru. Can't wait where it goes from now.

* Yuuki Aoi for the role of Hinazuki was an excellent choice. She's a master of young deadpan voices.

Idk, I kind of felt that he was acting more like a 10 year old than a 29 year old would in many of the situations he was in. 
>> ARTICLE
So if he knows he's 29 years old, but he is in his younger selfs body, does it count as peadophilia
>> ARTICLE
His embarrassed reaction in the park may be just the ten year old that he physically is.                    
He may have the personality, memories, and intuition of a 29-year old, but his brain is still physically 11. That's gotta have an effect on his psychology.

peadophilia the attraction to green peas?

It's only pedophilia for him, it'd be normal for everyone else I guess.

I'm sure Satoru also asks this question.

This episode was really good, as well, and I really liked the ED (the OP's art and animation are also good, but while I liked the music, not as much as the ED's). Anyway, the show really makes a point of its shot composition, of how *movie*-like it is, from actually having a [movie](http://i.imgur.com/sVEKssy.jpg)-[reel](http://i.imgur.com/SO7dWbH.jpg) [effect](http://i.imgur.com/oO44Q8f.jpg) playing whenever Satoru is reviewing his memories, to the super-wide resolution, to all the really well-done shots, in terms of composition, or angle, or just capturing a lovely moment. There were so many of these moments that rather than capture any, I'll just tell you to watch the show (but [here is handful](http://imgur.com/a/LLraS) even so, though teacher's entrance from Satoru's perspective was more of a "moving scene" moment).

I also liked something that tangentially references the issue of "masks", which is the mask we hide our daily lives from. We move unseeing what we perceive as normal, and it takes an outsider to point out to us what we have. An outsider, such as time and the aid of a home-made video from our childhood, "Was this really us? Huh," and here is Satoru, viewing a live repeat performance of the life he left behind. And he's able to appreciate it, even as he couldn't show warmth to his mother when she invaded his life last episode. Her death surely played a part in it, but still.

So, this show looks great, but does it actually work beyond that? This episode was definitely slower than last one, but that's ok. Last week had given us the hook, and now Satoru has to get acclimated to life on mars. He's a stranger in his own old life, but even so he moves things forward, slowly, as the clock tick-tocks inexorably to Kayo's death, and his mother's.

The above is a theme the show already addressed, how he's a stranger in his own life, how he's putting on the mask of "young Satoru," but then again, he always have. But here's the thing. We all always perform a role, we always wear masks. Just notice how we act differently based on who we're engaging with. It's not as much a case of "wear the mask long enough and it'll become you," but it already *is* you. This is something I talk about often (and did during my OreGairu write-ups as well) - you're not being "fake", you're being "you", who is happening to think X while projecting Y. Mask-wearing you is you, but so is the mask you choose to display. They're all the same person.

We all wear masks, and we all slip things out now and then. And sometimes the mask is so ingrained, so "us", that what we "let out" is what the mask, for the occasion, demands.

Anyway, it was another good episode, expertly handled by the director, and while a bit slow, I liked it even so. [Poor Aoi Yuuki](http://i.imgur.com/rQklLKL.jpg), constantly [getting called a brat](http://i.imgur.com/3im4HXH.jpg) these days ;-)

It shouldn't be allowed that a show is *this* good, holy shit.

And Aoi Yuuki is the perfect cast for Hinazuki. No contest.
>> ARTICLE
The manga had some high expectations so I  am so glad the adaptation is so good for anime fans  The only slight nitpick is that they sped through a few slower scenes. But it's arguably a good thing.
>> ARTICLE
They are so cute together! When she got that invitation she looked so adorable! I'll just keep ignoring his actual age and everything will be fine :p
>> ARTICLE
> I'll just keep ignoring his actual age and everything will be fine :p

There is no way this is going to end with a 29 year old man getting into a relationship with a middle schooler. None at all. They might tease the fuck out of it, milk it for some comedy and a maybe a little drama too, but I suggest abandoning this ship because it ain't going nowhere. 
>> ARTICLE
> They might tease the fuck out of it, milk it for some comedy and a maybe a little drama too

Yeah pretty much what I'm looking for, real ship is still with Pizza Girl for now :p

Or he saves and they meet again when the same age :D
>> ARTICLE
>Or he saves and they meet again when the same age :D

thats what im banking on
>> ARTICLE
Pizza Girl is so adorable. Age difference is a bit iffy though, and I don't know how involved she is in the plot though.
>> ARTICLE
Well, they technically are the same age, so if he manages to save her then the 2006 versions of them could end up together.

It is a weird dynamic though. He's both 10 or 11 and 29 at the same time.
>> ARTICLE
The 2006 versions ending up together would be *weird*, but I'd totally be into that.  I'd be happy to see that.  I just hope that there's not any sort of romance between the 1988 versions.  That would be super uncomfortable. 
>> ARTICLE
The way I was thinking is that they become friends, he saves her dramatically from the mysterious murderer, and end up together as they grow up or something.
>> ARTICLE
That would be cool.  I wonder if Satoru would skip forward to 2006 again once he completes his "mission" or if he he would have to live out those 18 years again.  If he did skip forward, would those 18 years play out with his 11 year old mind or his 29 year old mind?

I also wonder if we'll get a few jumps between the past and the present throughout the story.

This might be one where I need to check out the manga once it's finished.  I believe the manga is still ongoing so we won't be getting a conclusion unless they go for an anime-original ending.
>> ARTICLE
Someone mentioned either in it's own thread or in last week's episode that the show will reach it's normal ending. So either the manga will end within the next couple months, or the show will get the ending sooner than the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I think there will be some time jumps. The kohai girl from his future?! work is in the OP and I doubt that they would just never use her again.
>> ARTICLE
> I'll just keep ignoring his actual age and everything will be fine :p

At least he realizes. "What are you doing? You're 29 years old..."
>> ARTICLE
Made it even cuter that he was embarrassed :p
>> ARTICLE
The production value for this anime is insane. This episode was just as good as the first one, i really like Satoru's and Kayo's relationship, they are cute <3 

Kenya is interesting, he has a very close eye on Satoru.

Nice OST.
>> ARTICLE
God, the ED was gorgeous.  And can someone that's read the manga tell me if Kenya gets significant screen time?  Because I'm already really interested in what he could bring to the story. 
>> ARTICLE
From Satoru's group of friends, he probably gets the most screen time.
>> ARTICLE
Dragon question III came out in 1988, Feb 10th. He went back to Feb 15, its actually accurate!
>> ARTICLE
I wonder how it affects your mind, how you have an adult personality in a child. I mean, this ain't Detective Conan. He's literally living a child as an adult. So if he's +18yo now, will he be +36yo by the time he's back in the present (which is...the...future?^(Fucking time warps...))?

I'm also wondering if there are many other people who have "revived" in this world. It'll be a pretty normal story device, I would believe. I don't know if I'd honestly want to see it, but it would be interesting.

***

Jesus, I'm blushing watching two children fall in love with each other. And one's a freakin' 29-year old child. I have no idea what this feeling is, but I know for sure that Hinazuki is **fucking adorable.** And to kidnap her...I get it. Anyone would want a Hinazuki in their home. I get it...

[**^^But ^^he ^^shall ^^not ^^be ^^forgiven.**](#manlyschoolgirls)
>> ARTICLE
He's actually 29 years old in the body of an 11 year old so if he does live out his life back to the future/his present/our past, he will have the mind/life experience of a 47 year old when he's 29 again.
>> ARTICLE
At least he hasn't [PMMM spoilers](/s "gone back over a hundred times, unlike Homura.")

Though the constant throwing back by 1-5 minutes may snowball up into a year or so...

At least he hasn't [Haruhi Suzumiya spoilers](/s "gone back thousands of times, like Nagato.")
>> ARTICLE
Please don't let Hinazuki-chan die, please!

Hmm, [this image](http://imgur.com/Ktx7WhL) was shown for just a few frames near the end of the episode, shortly after Sotaru mentioned something about her not having gloves. At first I thought it was blood, but it looks like they were actually charred.

In the first episode during the second revival, when Sotaru asked his mom if she "had a weird feeling," she said he had mentioned that a long time ago about a small fire. There's a pretty clear connection here, I'm curious to see how it plays out.

That's because the director of Shinsekai Yori (Masashi Ishihama) did most of the work on the ED.

I cant take loli abuse that scene mom hitting her was pretty brutal. Well im jumping to the manga bandwagon I just cant wait
>> ARTICLE
It's not often I get to talk about honest to god cinematography in a TV anime, but holy fuck, this show is so well shot and edited that it makes me think a little less of almost everything else.

That scene in the park where they're separated by the tree, but then he makes his first point of connection to her and crosses that barrier to be beside her - HOLY FUCK WHAT AN AMAZING SHOT. and I'm in love with the hosoda-esque presentation of the rewind power as a jumbled film strip.

Show of the season by a wiiiiide margin so far. Well, except for Showa Rakugo, which is equally great. INCREDIBLE OP and ED too. I have a feeling I'll be talking about it a lot on Mother's Basement in the near future.
>> ARTICLE
Can someone explain what Fujinuma meant at the end when he said outloud, "That's because I decided not to lie to you." ?
>> ARTICLE
I believe this is related to their conversation about being "fake". He admits that he plays a persona in order to fit in with his group of friends and she calls him out on that. When he said that he has decided to not lie to her, he means that he doesn't put on his act when talking to her and would be himself instead. Well, his act as his 11 year old avatar.
>> ARTICLE
Very good answer.. thank you smart person.
>> ARTICLE
Second episode was great, I really love the use of the film to show the "present" and the use of his adult self speaking along side his child self sometimes.

 After being disappointed in how Perfect Insider turned out I am a little wary of giving this too much hype, however I am hopeful!
>> ARTICLE
Manga-Reader right here.

You're allowed to get hyped. It's only getting better and better from now on.
>> ARTICLE
**Here are some of my thoughts about the episode as I am watching.**

I really like the OP, I love Asian Kung-Fu Generation and the song was catchy and pulled me into the anime a lot more. 

Yet again I am also loving the VA (as everyone else is saying) he is so normal sounding and just it seems to fit his character like a glove. 1988 Satoru's VA is also really good as well.

I liked the animation of Satoru's mom forming the hamburger patties, seemed really smooth to me. The art style is really pretty and fits the overall tone of the anime.

Kayo saying "Would you kill someone for me" was really chilling. Her character seems interesting and I like her VA thus far.

I should probably say that in general I like the VA work for this anime as a whole. Really grounded and realistic.

The part where it show's Kayo being abused behind a curtain was really saddening. She seems like she needs a friend, and when Satoru gave her his invitation it struck a chord with me. It was really heartfelt. 

The ED is also really good. The animation in the ED is also really pretty to look at. I have to hand it to A-1, they always are really solid with their OP and ED picks no matter what the anime is.

**Overall** I loved this second episode, almost as much as the first. It wasn't as exciting, but being thrown into the fray with Satoru in 1988 was awesome, the intro of Kayo was awesome, and chilling at the same time. His friends (especially Kenya) seem to be characters that I already and interested in. Definitely at the top spot for AoTS for me as of now!

Edit: To add, I think Rewrite would have been an excellent choice as well for an OP if they wanted to use a 2006 band, anyone else agree with this?
>> ARTICLE
Gonna throw in my little theory.

[ ](/s "When satory was monologueing about Hinazuki he said that it was found after the snow melted. When talking about this they were showing images from what looks like a dump. My guess is that the dump is Satoru and his friends hideout and Satoru was the one to find her body and he has repressed his memory of it. This would explain why he mentions in episode one that his mom tried so hard to make him forget about her. She wasn't trying to make him forget about the murder, but about seeing the body.")

Edit: As a side note I really like how all the characters act like children (because they are). Well except for Kenya, I hope there is a reason that he acts very mature for being just a child.
>> ARTICLE
Even during an episode where nothing much happens, I still can't help being fascinated by everything that this show does well. Like the kid voice and the adult voice meshing together for certain dialogue was pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
This is so far living up to my expectation. The first episode completely blew me away and episode two seems to keep the ball rolling. So far the strongest thing is the character interactions they all seem so genuine. It'll be interesting once we get to see some more suspense but overall I find this to be the most interesting thing this Winter, hopefully it will continue to live up to its start.

EDIT: OP and ED are both superb.  
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it's just me, but I found this scene to be strangely unsettling. 
http://imgur.com/mybrwCQ
Given that he likely won't be spending nearly as much time with Yuuki  I wonder what effect that will have on the timeline.
>> ARTICLE
It's not "a town where I'm not there," it's "a town where *only I* am not there." This is a really important distinction, especially when talking about the essay.
>> ARTICLE
From the looks of it and the pacing, it appears the anime may end around chapter 33? Maybe 34 at the end credit. That is unless they decide to skip a few chapters. Still pretty salty about ch.34 :/ 
>> ARTICLE
The anime is confirmed to be ending with the manga, they are working together with the mangaka so that they adapt the ending. 
>> ARTICLE
For those who read the manga, how is it going? The first two episodes are a good adaptation?
>> ARTICLE
Anime so far is better. Manga is good, but the anime is making it flow a lot better so the pacing is much improved. Manga had him rewind a few times to show how it worked and other things like that the anime cut out.
>> ARTICLE
The first episode skipped out a few stuff, but the pacing is still good and nothing of importance was taken out.
>> ARTICLE
I can't remember being this enthralled with a show in some time. After sifting through so many bland or unoriginal amines, this one is really impressing me. The MC isn't some archetypal high school student, there aren't any moe blob's disguised as characters, and the story is devoid of most anime tropes. On top of all that, everything else about the show is just on point. The animation, the audio, the voice acting, it's all exquisite. I'm legitimately invested in this story and its characters already and I am ecstatic to watch both of them develop as the season progresses. My only complaint at this point in time is that I have to wait a week between episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
man

i am watching this show while reading oyasumi punpun since last week (halfway through)

my kokoro...

im going to die young at this rate..
>> ARTICLE
It's that aspect ratio that solidified the entire series as a 10/10 for me at this given moment.

Like holy shit, it would be right at home in a movie theater.

By being in that aspect ratio(idk what ratio it is), it gives off that cinematic feel. The cool colours being used all around, gives off the moody vibe.

The best part yet is the use of music. Putting in music at 11:58 would have broken the emotional immersion I have with the previous scenes. Instead, it gives the conversation undivided attention and as a result, it feels heavy and important. The anime does this plenty of times. I can't say much about the placement of music, but when there's music playing, it just fits.

Whoever is in charge of the sound design and the directing of the scenes in this anime should win some kind of cinematography award.

2 episodes in, and already AOTS for me. No question about it.^^maybe ^^i'll ^^change ^^this ^^in ^^the ^^future, ^^well ^^see ^^about ^^that.

Binged the manga after the first episode last week. Now I don't know if I wanna wait till the anime is finished to watch it all in one sitting or keep up with it right now. Argggg it's just sooooo good

Overall I thought this episode was great and it made me become more hyped for the rest of the season. I can't wait to see what is going to happen now after this episode.

Just a reminder to fans that over at /r/BokuDakegaInaiMachi we have our own discussion thread located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuDakegaInaiMachi/comments/40zac4/spoilers_boku_dake_ga_inai_machi_episode_2/).

I'm ready for the craziness!
I'll edit this if something amazing happens.

Edit 1: Feels getting crushed by seeing mom lovingly cooking for him 

Edit 2: [More mystery surrounding Hinazuki](http://imgur.com/AXtluJY)

Edit 3: [I'm intrigued, what does she mean?](http://imgur.com/SajdT1r) She asked him if he would kill someojne for her. Could that be the person who's responsible for what happened to her and his mom?

Edit 4: Kenya thinks Satoru should keep his eye on Hinazuki. Also he looked at Satoru a little wierd and almost told Satoru that he's been acting wierd. I don't think he's off the hook he knows something.

Edit 5: "When I think about the town without me, I feel a sense of relief. I want to go far,far away." Like Satoru says, Hinazuki's essay is a call for help. What is he going to do to help? 


Edit 6: I'm interested in his essay. He said he didn't want to show it to his mom because of her "all seeing eyes".

Edit 7: Hinazuki think's all of Satoru's emotions are fake. Really enjoyed their conversation at the park and how they connected something the girl last episode said to what Hinazuki said. Something is important about March 20.

Edit 8: "Its easy to talk to you" If that's the last place you saw her then run after her!

Another deep episode, if his power truly brought him back 18 years, that's pretty amazing.  His power has to affect the flow of time if thats the case. If he goes into the past and is able to save Hinazuki and in the end his mom, how will it affect the present and future? It makes me think that  maybe he's at the police station and this is all playing through his mind as he tries to figure out where things went wrong and to determine  who the killer is.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really curious about Kenya. He could have just read her story and noticed that Satoru was keeping an eye on here so he thought Satoru was the right person to help her. But, they did make him seam a bit weird or sketchy when he was talking to Satoru. He also have the same eye color as the murderer, and the murderer did not look very old in 2006 but was presumed to be the same person behind the disappearing in 1988.

I don't think Kenya is behind it but he will probably be important in the case and might be related to the killer.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't think Kenya is behind it but he will probably be important in the case and might be related to the killer.

That's what I was thinking. Him acting sketchy could be because he knows "who" is hurting and targeting Hinazuki. Kenya seems to know Satoru better than his other friends as well, that could also be why he tells Satoru to keep an eye on her, perhaps hes the man for the job in Kenya's eyes.

I'm really liking this protagonist. He's actually somewhat smart about his situation. I feel like most characters in other "time travel"  plots like these spend the first half of the series overthinking everything and making it painfully obvious something is wrong with them, instead of trying to fit in and figure out what's going on without drawing attention to themselves.

And he managed to pick up on the fact Kayo's mother is abusing her really quickly. He didn't take a couple episodes trying to piece that obvious fact together while the audience rolls their eyes since they already know. 
>> ARTICLE
Shot in the dark prediction for this show (haven't read the manga), Kenya kills Hinazuki and kills Satoru's Mom
>> ARTICLE
Man I really liked this episode.

Satoru was simply more enjoyable when his overly analytical personality was combined with some impulsive childishness, he didn't seem as detached and the plot did a better job of justifying why he was thinking so intently about everything. Hinazuki is intriguing, albeit archetypal so far, but she's just young enough that she doesn't come across as edgy. Kobayashi's character might be interesting as well, but so far he seems to act too old for his age.

I really liked the directing in this episode, a lot of great camera angles and good use of atmospheric coloring, it was less in your face than some of Tomohiko's past works but none the less powerful. In particular the way Kayo's poem contrasted the realistic aesthetic of the episode is a strong example of why anime can be such an effective medium even for stories that don't profit from its ability to suspend disbelief.

The soundtrack was generally understated, but was really effective at helping building atmosphere when it needed to be (unsurprising of Kajiura) and I quite enjoyed the opening and the ending themes. The sound direction was very solid, in particular I liked the effects used for sounds from memories, the emphasis added to some of Kayo's lines, how internal dialog was mixed with external voices.

At the moment the plot (or rather the crime) seems quite straightforward, so I assume there will be some twists thrown in. Specifically Kayo's home situation seems a little simplistic, perhaps her mother isn't the one abusing her.

^^^^^^^^^^Also ^^^^^^^^^^holy ^^^^^^^^^^fuck ^^^^^^^^^^Hinazuki ^^^^^^^^^^is ^^^^^^^^^^hot.

Well, that was an interesting episode and the ed was nice. I think I'm already getting at least a little confused about the storyline though:

Do we know for sure that she was murdered in the original timeline or is it possible she committed suicide?
>> ARTICLE
I think given the first episode it sort of confirms that she was murdered in the original timeline. I think it happens to be circumstance that her life  has been nothing but miserable, and then she get's murdered to top it off. Because Satoru's mom got killed by the same guy because she caught him in the act in EP 1 right?
>> ARTICLE
she was the first of a series of kidnapping + killing
>> ARTICLE
You saw her hand under a pile of rubble. Maybe she was stuck and froze to death but I doubt it was suicide.

At this point we don't know anything about Kayo's death other than Sotaru remembers her being murdered.

Two episodes in and I'm thinking this is the best thing I've seen in a while. I think it has the potential to be better than anything I saw Summer or Fall seasons at least (I mean, I liked OPM but if you ignore hype..).

I like how they don't have him simply remember everything, that wouldn't be right. Still, I would expect him to act more strange. He's a 29 year old in an 11 year old's body, he shouldn't remotely understand how to act like an 11 year old. At least, I wouldn't understand.
>> ARTICLE
> Still, I would expect him to act more strange. He's a 29 year old in an 11 year old's body, he shouldn't remotely understand how to act like an 11 year old. At least, I wouldn't understand.

Yeah, I thought it wasn't quite right that he reacted to the other boys asking about the girl by getting all embarrassed like a normal kid.   
  
It'll be interesting to see if he spending a lot of time in that body and being surrounded by childhood actually starts to make him think more like a kid again.

>> ARTICLE
He might have the experience and mindset of an adult, but his body is currently pumping out all those crazy early-pubescent hormones.
>> ARTICLE
Don't forget he's also a highly introverted zero-relationship minimal-social-skills 29yo.

The VA for both older and young Satoru are absolutely superb. I'm absolutely fucking hyped for this show every week and can't wait for how it turns out.

I hope it doesn't turn out that Airi is Hinazuki's daughter cause that would be fucked up for obvious reasons. I'm also not sure if Kenya's gonna end up being the ultimate bro or maybe even the child of the predator. He just is coming off as a bit too important to just be the Watson character. 

Edit: Nevermind about the Airi thing. Didn't know they found Hinazuki's body after the snow melted.

Looks like we get to meet young Togashi this episode what with his love of dragon quest and all.

I suddenly want a battle royale type anime of like 16 people who each got transferred back in time like 50 years (significantly more time than this show), and they use their knowledge to attain significant power in some way. One of them ends up becoming an emperor or something and is perceived as a god by being able to predict the future. Another one is a genius scientist who reinvents all of the future's technology herself. Someone else becomes an influential political or economic leader in another country by being able to respond to economic collapses before they happen and earn a lot of money. Maybe another person wins the lottery a few times. 

The people have come from the future end up having to confront each other because that's what powerful people do, and it becomes an Anyone Can Die type of show.

Also, this was a good episode.

I'm enjoying this series, i wonder if can expect a happy ending here...

Wow, what a great episode 2. I feel like the realism of the art and the tasteful directing really adds to the overall experience. On top of that, the dialogue is fun to follow: it actively avoids many anime conversation cliches, and I am extremely grateful for that. To top it off, the VA and the unobstrusive accompanying soundtrack feels right at home within the atmosphere. It is simply a really good show with a lot of potential!

this kenya kid is giving me a weird vibe, notice how at 14:04 his eyes are red. now this is a stretch but the murderer we saw kill the mother did not look old at all,actually around the same age as our main. so what if it was kenya! maybe the girl was his first, and the mother recognized him because he was a friend of our main. so is my theory crazy, what do you guys think?

That OP is so fucking sick, and I really like the ED too.

Everything just hits home so much. Playing a facade so you can fit in, smiling, laughing, acting nice all in the hopes that eventually the fake becomes reality. And just holy fuck, her essay about a town without her was heartbreaking.

Dear god! The atmosphere of this show is outstanding. It's insane how uneasy it makes me feel watching it. If they keep it up during the entire run I'll give it a 10 for this alone.

The voice actor of MC is also incredible. I'd say right now the only thing I somewhat dislike is the character design, but that is just nitpicking.

ps: I'm wondering how pizza-chan fits into the story now that the story is 18 years in the past. She got a spot in the OP next to his mother and Hinazuki. Seems a bit much if the character would only be relevant in the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
After watching this episode I decided that I won't wait for another week. I'll just read the manga and spoil myself till I drop dead from satisfaction.
>> ARTICLE
I LOVE this anime, the MC is awesome, how he is, how he reacts, the incredible VA, everyone around feels so real, and when Kayo finally showed her adorable side I just melted (she must be suffering A LOT, I feel her pain...).

The blush reaction of Satoru was just soooo good, I loved how he even was like "wtf, I'm 29, why I'm blushing for that?"

10/10 for now, I love so much this type of stories, waiting a whole week for the next episode will be painful!


>> ARTICLE
Goddamn this show is good.
>> ARTICLE
It feels like its been awhile since we've gotten to watch such a complex anime. Hard to even think about what to say, you just kinda keep watching and keep wondering  what's gonna happen next with this show.

The inner monologues do bring me back to Kyon's monologues in Melancholy/Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, I think it really does help this anime a lot that the voice actor doing the monologues has a fitting voice who does their job so well.
>> ARTICLE
And the long wait begins, till next week. 
>> ARTICLE
God damn this show is amazing. If I was him, I would write down and record every single thing he remembers from the "future" now. No doubt memories will be lost while he's a young kid again.
>> ARTICLE
Favorite anime of the season hands down so far. It's goooooood
>> ARTICLE
I LOVE the VA voice, for both that is. I love the normal calm voice of 29 y/o Satoru and the cute innocent voice of grade schooler Satoru. This is really tending to be AOTS.
>> ARTICLE
This shit is dark and gets darker.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit, this is my new drug. Also I'm quite interested on how our beloved MC will deal with stuff like essays. I mean come on, it's not remotely hard for a 29 year old to take grade school tests. If any manga readers would inform me on this without giving many spoilers, that'd be great because I'm looking forward to reading it after the anime has finished.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this is really damn good.

I love the MC's VA(a Actor giving Voice Acting a go for the first time, so I'm told), and Aoi Yuuki as Hinazuki is such a nice fit.  
Adult-MC's "Eh?" which he kinda "*breaths out*" are too good.

The OP is nice, but the ED is amazing, thanks [Ishihama Masashi!](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2016-01-13/the-rise-of-masashi-ishihama-from-the-new-world-to-garakowa/.97522)
>> ARTICLE
This is seriously good stuff we got going here and I'm ecstatic about it. I'm constantly hungry for more, I haven't felt this strongly about an anime for months now.
>> ARTICLE
Do we know how much episodes this is getting? I'm really enjoying how they're taking their time telling the story. 
  
Also I think I'm digging the ED just as much as the OP :)
>> ARTICLE
Were there not TWO kids murdered from his class?
If the girl is one, who is the other?
Kenya? Did he know to much and got involved?
>> ARTICLE
This is definitely going to be top on my list this season. The plot so far with the time traveling is really interesting. It sparks my interest a lot and I can't relate to it because its something I always wanted to experience. Just trying to go back in time with my current knowledge. That would be so freaking cool and being able to see this in erased is very pleasing. And the ending when he was embarrassed because she touched his hands. Oh my god lol it made me question something. If you go back in time to ur younger body with ur current knowledge and fall in love with someone who is around ur new age, would thst be weird at all? Will it even be legal? Lol
>> ARTICLE
Live-ish recation, along with my thoughts.

(1:00) - HELL YES. The ED for last is the OP. Asain Kung-Fu Generation FTWWWW!!! Like the Visuals a bunch too, favorite OP of the season so far.

(3:30) - As little as it sounds, I like a lot of the directing choices. The repeated "Yes'", the scrolling over of the camera when the teacher walked in, just the way the camera flows. Adds to the mysterious tone pretty effectively IMO.

(7:07) - "And Im not gonna lose this time". Chills.

(14:25) - I feel like the dialogue is pretty good going right now. Not all of it is useless, but a lot of it is just to set what the setting is supposed to be like. 

(15:12) - Death, huh. This feels like depression

(20:00) - Though I like all 3 ways (that I've seen) of mysteries and suspense building, I have some thoughts on this.

* The first being "this" type, where we have inner monologue

* Second being an intermediary to explain through dialogue.
 
* Third being able to explain it through only complex dialogue

The third being my favorite, second being my least liked of the three, and this one (inner monolgue), would be the "2nd" most liked one.

I feel like they do a "sub-par" decent job to my liking. Even though I like the inner monologue (also the fact that the monologue is 29 is nice), I would much prefer if he didn't completely explain *everything*. Not that I don't like this, It just puts a limit on how high I rate it. Thats the difference between shows like this, and shows like Mushishi, Serial Experiments Lain, or Ping Pong. 

I see the benefits in having an inner monologue to explain something, or the intermediary to explain it, but if you can get the same point across rather than having this type of narrative (however, the monologue in this one is actually half decent), its a lot more entertaining. I feel like if it has to point out absolutely everything, its almost insulting. I could have figured out that if a distant person has bruises they're probably being abused. That sort of stuff.

(20:32) - The embarrassment thing was pretty cute

Overall Thoughts - Nice Episode. I was a bit worried that It'd lose the 'hook' effect that the first episode had, but it kept interest well, albeit the monologuing.  It will praise it for the directing, and the fact that it *at least* gets you interested before exposition/dialogue. 
>> ARTICLE
Pls let the quality stay like this for the rest of the show, it's really awesome so far
>> ARTICLE
I think I actually like the Cinematic Black Bars in this series it seems.. Appropriate for the setting. Other than that this is turning out to be my favorite of this season so far. Lets hope it stays this good!
>> ARTICLE
I think it's interesting how they keep teasing the shadowy plane figure. The first episode established that Fujinima thinks the guy who played with him as a child is innocent, so I'm curious to see if it's misdirection. Absolutely loving this series so far, there's so much to speculate on, and I'm enjoying the little human moments that make the setting feel real. (Kids talking about video games, messing around while they pee, the cooking scene.) Everyone's thought about what they'd change if they could do things over, and I the way the MC treats his mom really hits home for me.
>> ARTICLE
When I realized Hinazuki was voiced by Yuuki Aoi this got even better, she's so good. Being able to switch from an aggressive voice in Tatsumaki or Clementine from One Punch Man//Overlord or a cheerful voice in Diane from Nanatsu no Taizai and then this I guess sort of gloomy voice.
>> ARTICLE
I can't help but notice there's some sort of relation between Hinazuki and the Pizza Girl....

Both of them said almost the exact same thing about "keep repeating until its real" 

And in episode one, when Satoru remembers about Hinazuki when he's "dying", Satoru is hearing Hinazuki but Pizza Girl is the one that talks when he wakes up. 
I sense some foreshadowing here..
>> ARTICLE
Really digging the opening theme for this show
>> ARTICLE
I love that because the MC still has his 29 year old mind, he is able to think clearly and make good judgments. Very refreshing to see.
>> ARTICLE
check OP 01:40

is that you, murderer-kun?
>> ARTICLE
So any one got any theories about the mother?
>> ARTICLE
I dont know if anyone mentioned it before, but one of my favorite parts is that in the past, its a "wide screen" image, making it feel like it is actually "in the past" to me.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I can't even begin to fathom what it would be like to be sent back to myself as a small child.  There are so many things that I just wouldn't remember.
>> ARTICLE
Wow... Having the 29 yr old Satoru react with, narrate and comment on his younger self and the environment he was in is such a refreshing experience. Combined with a really heavy theme I nearly teared up to be honest. This is a really good follow up to episode one.
>> ARTICLE
First ep was pretty average if I'm being honest, don't know why so many people were calling this amazing, but this episode was good. That last scene in the park was "shot" so well. If it didn't look like that in the manga, I guess Itou does have some talent after all. Happy to say A-1 has me for another week!
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if people noticed, the ED is composed by Yuki Kajiura 

BUT 

It's not performed by kalafina


i was shocked at first to hear the ED and see kajiura as the composer, because it did not sound like one of her usual compositions at first. though after listening to it again, it sounded a bit like the madoka rebellion movie ED kimi no gin no niwa. I was hoping kajiura can break her usual styles, but oh well, still a nice ED
>> ARTICLE


Amazing production value, with all the focus and great lighting to create an mystifying atmosphere.
Love the director, it feels like a high budget movie, the 16:9 ratio also helps in the case.
Lack of BGM increases mystery and dialogues are minimum and to the point.
I couldn't believe 22 minutes passed, it felt like I just started.
10/10 till episode 2.

Hinazuki touching his arm, I was praying " PLEASE DON'T BEHAVE LIKE A MAINSTREAM MC-KUN!" , didn't happen, not disappointed, liked his natural reaction.

>> ARTICLE
Seeing an anime male who doesn't freak out during any kind of interaction with a girl feels so refreshing

GJ MC-kun
>> ARTICLE
This anime is so beautifully done . Can't wait for the next episode ! Full of talented VAs especially for the MC and Hinazuki(yuuki aoi)
>> ARTICLE
Three things for me so far (just watched Ep1 and 2 tonight).

A - I think I'm going to call my entire family tomorrow and tell them all that I love them.

B - I can't think of the last time I've been glued to something/wanting more of something immediately. As soon as Ep2 was over I immediately got bummed that I have to wait a week for another episode.

C - The butterfly being around for when Revival happens is pretty cool, only for that I love whatever genre you want to call it when things take advantage of the "butterfly effect" literally. Until Dawn (video game), Life Is Strange (video game), Butterfly Effect (movie), etc. 

They all non-figuratively had something that marked off when life was about to change, and it's a cool visual trigger to me.
>> ARTICLE
Just got to watch it, and as a manga reader, damn this adaptation is going so smoothly so far. A-1 Pictures bring their A-game into this!
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to just throw out my wild guess here...


At the end of the episode when it shows the scene of her death there are bloody gloves, but she isn't wearing any gloves in the park during this episode, i think that he is going to give those gloves to her which would foreshadow that this time his jump back in time will be different and that he isn't rewriting the past at all but just running in an infinite loop.



Okay it is a little far-fetched but that would be so trippy and awesome if it panned out that way.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if this been found yet but if you pause during to opening when MC gets shot you see [This](http://i.imgur.com/yi80mpG.jpg) man in the refection.
>> ARTICLE
I dont know if I'm the only one who noticed this but in the scne where Satoru is running away from the bullet in the OP,you can see this particular guy when his glasses break up http://i.imgur.com/9amxOeh.png
>> ARTICLE
God, I am *loving* that this is in widescreen. And the film stock bit wsa a really nice touch. Don't know that I've seen an anime with this aspect ratio before.
>> ARTICLE
Great show, one of my favorites this season! 

By the way, can someone tell me what the boys say for "goodbye"? something like that? Couldn't find it anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
> 

 apparently a phrase used in Hokkaido, so it's not in any dictionaries. From [this explanation in Japanese](http://pucchi.net/hokkaido/language/shitakke.php), it's like saying "well then" or "all right then" as a farewell in English.
>> ARTICLE
Only 2 episodes in and you can already feel the potential oozing from this show. I'm definitely interested in reading the manga now. I can't wait to see how the story unfolds.
>> ARTICLE
Mc's voice is making my body hot.
 
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if the kids are more believable because they're weird and talk about video games too much. That hand scene was cute and funny 
>> ARTICLE
I'm really excited with this show. Child abuse is something that pisses me off so so so bad.
>> ARTICLE
I love how not only are you hearing his child self thinking but also his 22 year old self over the top acting as a narrator, this show is definitely going to be one of my favorites this year.
>> ARTICLE
Is nobody mentioning the fact that there were 2 children who were kidnapped and murdered? Who's the other one?
>> ARTICLE
Well, I posted a speculation, and my post was removed as an "untagged spoiler."

I guess that means I've now been spoiled by the mod/whoever reported me.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if they could get Crispin Freeman to dub AdultSatoru if they ever go with an english dub.
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to root for the MC + Hinazuki relationship when you remember MC is actually 29 years old
>> ARTICLE
The episode wasn't quite as good as the first but I didn't expect it to be.  I definitely still enjoyed it though.  I'm hooked.

  I'm liking the butterfly symbolism for the butterfly effect.

  I really hope we don't get an uncomfortable reomance between Satoru and Hinozuki.

I wonder if Kenya is wise to the time-travel.  He was dropping hunts to Satoru, and he told Satoru that he could talk to him about anything.  Kenya did seem intrigued when Satoru was acting unusual.
>> ARTICLE
I wonder if the butterfly effect is going to play out by Satoru doing something that causes Airi to never be born.
>> ARTICLE
> The episode wasn't quite as good as the first but I didn't expect it to be

We can't have someone dying every episode...
>> ARTICLE
Which is why I said "but I didn't expect it to be".
>> ARTICLE
Not a big fan of the OP, but the show is amazing.

The 'would you live your life right if you had another chance' part with him realizing that he should appreciate his life with his mother more, was really moving.

Is she blushing because she's cold or because she's flustered? Who knows? It's part of the mystery that is Hinazuki.

Also, today I found out, that I don't remember where I sat in grade school. Or the class. At least I remember the school.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope they don't mess this show up. So far the show has been pretty great, the soundtrack especially. The attention to detail also does a lot for the show as well. If it keeps up with how good it has been so far, it will probably be my favourite this season. Just waiting for Ajin to contest that now.
>> ARTICLE
I really like how his thoughts speak from the adult Satoru but his voice speaks from the child Satoru.
>> ARTICLE
My only complaint about this show so far is the strange size of the show when things take place in 1988. Kinda good artisticly, but also gets annoying.
>> ARTICLE
My god the OP to this show sounds and looks amazing. I need to pick this show up now. 
>> ARTICLE
This episode actually hooked me more than the first. This show is spectacular so far. I hope it doesn't reach a peak anytime soon.
>> ARTICLE
I knew the background music sounded familiar to a track from Fate/Zero when MC was reading Kayo's essay. I looked up and it was Yuki Kajiura.
>> ARTICLE
Kenya seems pretty strange. I wonder if there's a reason he's so wise beyond his years. 

The only small complaint I have is that I can't hear younger Satoru's voice as male at all. That's always been a pet peeve of mine.
>> ARTICLE
This reminds me of 20th Century Boys a bit.

Today's episode was also great, I'm really interested.
>> ARTICLE
Sigh...this is going to be an emotional rollercoaster isn't it?
>> ARTICLE
Yes.
>> ARTICLE
I love how much common sense this guy like instantly realising that Hinazuki may have s similar circumstance but still not instantly jumping to conclusions and thinking about it again to see what she also could've ment.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome episode. Best anime this season? man I hope I could skip forward a few months until this is finished and watch it all in one go.

I must ask tho.. will we ever get to see that girl in the first episode? she is even in the opening but.. how this is playing out like why? will she ever be a part of the story somehow? I kinda liked her and she obv liked the MC.


>> ARTICLE
I'm giving it my all to restrain myself from reading the manga untill the anime is done airing so I don't know how it will end, but I'm getting a little vibe that it might not be a happy one. Seems like a show that will leave the viewers depressed or raise more questions after watching. I seriously hope I'm wrong though.
>> ARTICLE
I can't believe it. I learned about this show about 1 week before it aired. I have no watched both episodes and holy crap it is amazing. It is filling so many empties holes I have been trying to find in anime. I am practically speechless and cannot wait for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
The animation in the ED was on another level. I had no idea if its got anything to with the plot but the colors and movement was just outstanding
>> ARTICLE
Ajin hasn't even aired and people are calling this [anime of the season](http://i.imgur.com/5DEPYYf.jpg).

Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying it. But I did feel a bit let down with this episode compared to the first. I mean, it is kind of hard to follow up that much hype, but I'm afraid this is going to end up being one of those anime with a promising start that ends up losing itself by the end. Plus, it's a time travel story. And we all know those [never end well](http://i.imgur.com/IGXvnqX.png).
>> ARTICLE
Well, Ajin is already on uncharted seas if you know what I mean, at least first ~20 minutes
>> ARTICLE
Between what I read of Ajin a while back (Like 7 chapters, all that was done at the time) and the first two episodes of this, I think ERASED is better. Also what is that second image? Umineko? Hardly seems related if so.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, I haven't read much of either. But I've been more hyped for Ajin for reasons I can't entire explain.

Also, hardly related is still related. I've yet to read/play/watch something time travel related that hasn't ended with pretty much the same message. "Don't fuck with the past, unless you want to fuck things up even worse, even if it's only on a personal emotional level."
>> ARTICLE
Great... [More fake braves](http://imgur.com/lfhMWa3)
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling the gloves are very important. It's been established that the MC has forgotten a few things from his past, and I have a feeling he had more of a relationship with Hinazuka than he remembers. Or, their lack of gloves is due to separate interactions with another character.
>> ARTICLE
I liked the first eisode but this one put this anime in my 8/10+ exclusive ategory.

Shows what potential the medium has really, if it wasn't so full of moe and by-otaku-for-otaku kind of stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Not disappointed at all by the 2nd episode. Biggest AOTS potential atm. I can't wait for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
2016 already started with one of the best anime series I seen so far. This and Parasyte on my top list.
>> ARTICLE
Are there any more anime that have an artstyle like this and welcome to the nhk for example, please give me any examples. I want to know since these shows seem to have better storylines and stuff, as I loved NHK and I am loving this too. 
>> ARTICLE
Definitely one of the best shows of the season, been glued to the screen since it aired.
>> ARTICLE
That Kenya kid is way too insightful for a 6th grader... I almost want to believe that one of these characters is also an adult in a child's body, but whether the story goes there or not, this anime is by far the one I am most excited to see unfold this season :).
>> ARTICLE
The revival sound gets me every single time......
>> ARTICLE
I noticed this anime yesterday, and I was surprised it managed to get an adaptation.  It's great it did get one, though.  A fantastic manga, hoping the anime will be just as good.
>> ARTICLE
Good shit.  Pissed when it ended!
>> ARTICLE
Really liking the whole concept so far.  
  
On another note, no idea why but the opening keeps making me think of the chorus of [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wjFahULCK8)

I just hope the murderer is not the teacher... I recently saw Aku no kyten and the teachers have similar characteristics on the surface...    
btw i love the aspect ratio change when in the past!

I am really like this show so far! Definetly a must watch.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god, ERASED is so damn good.

Kenya having the same eyes as the guy who killed Satoru's mom is kind of creeping me out...
>> ARTICLE
This show is simply astounding.
>> ARTICLE
Kayo is voiced by Fremy (Yuuki Aoi). Damn this anime just keeps on getting better.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't really watched an airing show since Tokyo Ghoul Root A, and after a disappointing ending, I haven't really wanted to watch an airing show since. Is this show worth it? 
>> ARTICLE
Question: Is there some significance to the blue butterfly, with regards to time travel? Like, some reference to an older story? Life is Strange had a blue butterfly, fairly recently.
>> ARTICLE
AotS. At least top 3.
>> ARTICLE
There are so many subtle reveals in just episode 2. All the subtle foreshadowing and classy directing blew me away. This episode somehow topped the first for me. I feel like this is going to be kinda like another Death Parade, showing up early in the year, yet at the end, still one of the best animes to come out from it.
>> ARTICLE
It says something when the only thing I disliked about an episode is that there was a 45 second recap in the beginning.
>> ARTICLE
ONLY 12 EPISODES :(
>> ARTICLE
Man this show is so *good*.

For a second there I thought Hinazuki can do reversal too, but then I remembered she died, so no do.


>> ARTICLE
I love everything about this show, but the writing of the kids comes off as beyond their age. Obviously the MC gets a pass because he's 29, but the "smart kid" and the red girl are way more perceptive than a 10 year old should be.

Great premise, great art, great cinematography, great sound direction and music. Just that one thing is bugging me.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is really interesting. Also I love the OP/ED
>> ARTICLE
Not as enjoyable as the first episode but still has me hooked due to its' premise.  Is it just me, or do all the characters(as children) look like the kids from anohana?  Anyways, did pretty good with the emotions when Satoru saw his mom again.  Also, one of the few anime where I like their ed song more than the op, it just looks so much cooler, kinda makes me think of SHAFT.
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck the directing was superb, the voice acting was amazing too. Let's hope they keep this quality up.
>> ARTICLE
Have a weird feeling Digibro is gonna hate this and everyone is gonna start judging it really hard. 
>> ARTICLE
Since the manga hasn't ended yet, is the ending of the anime being collaborated with the author?
>> ARTICLE
The anime ends in March with the manga.

Started counting the days until the ep 2 dropped once I heard AKG at the end of an amazing ep 1. 

This has got AoTS written all over it. Loving all of it, the gfx, vocals/sounds, story, errthang.

Alright boys I'm gonna go read the manga now guys see you in the last episode

Well, that was amazing. Direction, animation and voice acting are so good, like wow.
>> ARTICLE
In Hinazuki's  poem she says , 'A city without me' and in the original timeline she dies, suggesting her wish came true in an unfortunate way.
The title of the anime is , instead of watashi, boku is used, implying MC this time around will be 'gone' from the city, so are we possibly looking at a neutral end? One life for another 
>> ARTICLE
This series is turning out to be really, really good so far. 
>> ARTICLE
I can tell this is gonna be my favourite anime this season. Terrific animation and story so far.
>> ARTICLE
Was I the only one who jumped out my seat and looked behind when Satoru's mom opened the door from behind while he was reading Kayo's essay?

edit: this is a really fine level of detail in the sound effect -- it really shows how much effort was put in to make this show amazing so far...
>> ARTICLE
I feel like Kenya may be the killer, his eyes turned red for a split moment when he was talking and he seems to be much smarter than the other kids.
>> ARTICLE
First episode was good, but this one just got me hooked. Definietly gonna be my personal favorite this season.
>> ARTICLE
This entire episode, i had a feeling of impeding doom. Like every moment when MC was alone or with the girl.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I think I am hooked. This is pretty interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I love how they have made it look widescreen by clipping the top and bottom. Really gives it that mystery and time-skip feel.

The animation is really good and the story is getting really interesting. It seems the girl will play an important role in things to come.

I like how Satoru still has his adult memory and habits. It makes him take on a certain level of control of the situation yet his reaction to his surrounding and events shows us just how messed up this has gotten.

I'm loving every bit of it.
>> ARTICLE
i wonder if you would like the way they clip parts of the screen in [Detroit Metal City](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3702/Detroit_Metal_City), if you have the time check out the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait for the next episode, these cliffhangers are so annoying. This is my first time watching an anime while it's airing from episode 1, shits frustrating.
>> ARTICLE
This is so fucking good, holy shit!
>> ARTICLE
The ED had some pretty great soundstaging. I'd definitely recommend  listening with a pair of good headphones.  

FYI, the singer is Sayuri who performed [Ranpo Kitan's ED](https://d.maxfile.ro/mqjrytmgpa.webm) from last year. The full version of Erased's ED, Sore wa Chiisana Hikari no Youna (), is still a month away (2/24).
>> ARTICLE
This show is a breeding ground for character development.

I can't wait to do a comparison of the MC before and after the show!


I realize now that the name of this phenomenon, "Revival" is as much as a revival for the MC's past life, and an opportunity to see value in things he did not see in before, as much as it is for him to right a wrong in the world
>> ARTICLE
Wow this show is good. I honestly think that this is the first show I have watched where I have been hooked this fast. God, next week feels like an eternity away 
>> ARTICLE
The teacher its the fucking teacher im fucking calling it now. That look on him was to perfect for it not to be him.

Edit: Also ill point out that the mother recognized the killer in episode one at the supermarket, remembering he was kinda familiar and where had she seen him. I am all in right now for it being the teacher.
>> ARTICLE
i agree. 100% the teacher.
>> ARTICLE
The directing of this show so far has been phenomenal.

The camera work, the colors, the art style, the choice of VAs.  
This show sets the bar high.
>> ARTICLE
The weird thing is, i feel like the characters in this anime are most human like characters in any anime personality wise. Elementary kids looking and acting like kids, a mum acting like a caring mum.


Also that ED song start was giving me Macross Frontier vibes
>> ARTICLE
First time since Steins;Gate that I'm really hyped up and can't wait to watch the next episode. This is so good.
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking Airi might be the daughter of Kayo. Kayo may be raped at an early age and bore a child. The hint for this is when Kayo said something similar to Airi. It is Subete ga F ni naru once again....
>> ARTICLE
2nd ep and already my fav of this season 
>> ARTICLE
Good to see this episode was just as good as the first. I have *really* high hopes for the rest of the show now.  
The animation is actually really good for a TV anime. The movements are smooth and fluid, and the shot composition is astounding as well. So, how is Satoru going to fix things? What actually happened to Kayo in the past? How much does Kenya actually know? The mystery is pretty goddamn intriguing so far, and not many shows make me want to know what happens this badly.
>> ARTICLE
Has a shinsekai yori vibe to it. My favorite show of the season thus far.
>> ARTICLE
Re:Re YES
>> ARTICLE
The Ed and overall tone of the show really gives off a shinsekai Yuri steins gate vibe
>> ARTICLE
For some reason i feel like playing dragon quest.
>> ARTICLE
I remember some parts in this episode in the manga is the parts where I guessed right about who the killer was. It's not really an analysis though. Just merely gut after reading and watching too many procedural shows. 

Brilliant OP as well. i really love the direction in this anime, and they use cinema widescreen, right? Lovely. Also I'm really in love with the VA of adult Satoru. Such a contrast with how lively child Satoru sounds. 
>> ARTICLE
Decided to wait until episode 2 before I commented, but,  I'm in love with this anime. Everything about it so far just has my attention and kept it the whole entire time! I'm so happy to discover this. It's already set up on my queue.

AOTS has been certified.

its been a while since an adaptation has made me hungry for the original source.

I think the girl is also someone that traveled back in time and now the MC has traveled back in time to his youth to prevent the murder of his Mom which he committed himself by traveling to the future to save his (then) girlfriend that is the young girl from a different dimension.
Steins;Gate + Mirai Nikki.

Yes, I went there.

don't want to call it too early, but so far this is looking like it'll be one of the greats

It hasn't dropped the ball in any aspect yet.

I know this is an old thread now, but I noticed that in Satoru's elementary school, the children all wrote the word "hope" () on the walls. Thought that might be a symbol or foreshadow to something.

So hard not to read the source material.

Funniest thing with the show was I wanted to start reading the manga like 3 days before I checked up on the winterseason, and well I don't need to do that now (yet)

Late to the party, but can anyone tell me what the kids were saying to each other when they were leaving school? It sounded like "shitake" (mushroom??) and they followed it up with mata ashita (see you tomorrow)

I'm just adding to the rabble, but I love everything about this show. A great concept, well written, good characters, good animation, good voice acting.

Just started sampling this season's shows and I'm glad this was one of the first I watched...though bad in what all the other shows have to live up to.
>> ARTICLE
Homeroom teacher did it. Calling it now. Looks similar, would be familiar with the parents and the investigation, didn't even try to do something about the abuse despite all the warning signs, memorized the position of Kayo's seat, etc. Plus his position as both an authority figure and a trustworthy adult means that the kid would go with him willingly. I'm pretty sure that a kid like Kayo would think twice about going with unfamiliar adults after seeing all the terrible things adults can do.

On another note -- I'm not sure why everyone is suspicious of Kenya. He's ten years old, so I doubt he's really capable of thinking as analytically about this situation as Satoru.

Oh man, the anticipation...

This show is definitely tied with Grimgar and Dimension W for what has me most excited this season.

Give Grimgar some time and it can definitely get up there story wise, although it's more direct with its dark theme. 

For Dimension W, I don't know but I've hear great things 

I have a feeling we have our 3 top contenders for the season there :)!

God damn it, those rare times where you have an actually uniquely cool ADULT MC, it just has to drop it during the first episode. The whole anime will be based on the kids perspective won't it, lol.

Still pretty cool as a whole but bummed a little.

>> ARTICLE
Best anime of the season imo
>> ARTICLE
I was kind of giving up on this season until I saw this and Grimgar. After that amazing first episode I started recommending it, and I'm glad I did, this series is truly building into something phenomenal. 

Everyone else is pointing out all of the juicy points about the episode so I'm gonna talk about the OP and ED. To be honest, the only reason I started watching this show (I forgot it came out) is because I was looking for more songs by Sayuri [aka Mikazuki from Ranpo Kitan] (by the way there aren't any as far as my search has seen fml) and I came upon a page that listed she was doing the ED for this anime, AND AFKG WAS DOING THE OP!!! Not only are both songs great, but the visual accompaniment is spectacular. I'm really looking forward to the rest of this show.
>> ARTICLE
this anime is amazing so far. it has peaked my interests like crazy. 
>> ARTICLE
Having seen two episodes now, I have seen very few flaws with how the producers have planned out each episode, and executed it. Having seen several of A-1's works, they either go one of three ways as the series progresses:

1. Completely throw logic to the wind and make laughable characters *cough* *cough* SAO , Aldnoah.Zero *cough* *cough*
2. Start VERY strong, and drop the ball somewhere in between, usually in the form of a cop-out ending, but still make an enjoyable watch (e.g. Anohana)
3. Make a beautiful production that is the complete antithesis of the former two.

That being said, however, I love the premise of this show so far. The voice actors, the music, the [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqldayv8Cgw) the [ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5F5DunePxI), all of it seem to fit with the theme being presented. I mean holy shit! This is SO GOOD. That or I am just basking in that glorious after-episode glow that most of us love so much.

Either way, I'm gonna ride this to the end no matter what.

>> ARTICLE
wow the op is excellent. also, [SPOILERS](/s "i thought the foreshadowing in the op was p cool too")

Man this show is so good. 

It's up there with Hai to Gensou no Grimgar for me this season(only because I've read the light novel) and Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!(because of how refreshingly different the MC is and how he died xD)
>> ARTICLE
That solidifies it this is almost definately anime of the season. To be frank its not even fair at this point (not to say that there aren't other good animes too). The atmosphere in this series is almost suffocating and every aspect of the storytelling and execution is done so artfully. Unless they run out of budget some how or pull the mpother of all asspulls with the story this is shaping up to be a 9/10 or possibly even a 10/10 series for me.

But that's exactly what it says in the [manga](http://i.imgur.com/00JsXr6.png?1).
>> ARTICLE
Yes..."Famicom" which is the exact thing the kid said in the episode too, yet Crunchyroll decide to go with the brand name instead of the actual name of the product....That the kid literally just said.
>> ARTICLE
That's what the Famicom is called in America, so translating "Famicom" as "Nintendo" is appropriate.
>> ARTICLE
we called them "nintendo" where I grew up around that time. it's localized, so that people know what he's talking about. not everyone might know what a famicom was.
>> ARTICLE
You seem to be realy confused. In the US and I believe Europe it was released as the NES aka Nintendo Entertainment System and it was standard, at least in the US, for kids to shorten that to NES or Nintendo based at least partially upon the SNES / Super Nintendo shortening I'm guessing (but I'm not old enough to know the origin of  the name shortening). Like, a kid calling it the "Famicon" in English would actually indicate poor localization lol
>> ARTICLE
Probably because the subs are mainly for those outside of Japan and I think it was called a nes in those places. I would have had no idea what a Famicom is
>> ARTICLE
I imagine a lot of people are not aware of the consoles original Japanese name, whereas just about everyone in the world knows what a Nintendo is. Changing the word doesn't change the meaning of what the kid says, but it does make the meaning more accessible to all viewers. Frankly I don't really see the point of your complaint. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, also "Famicom" is the Japanese name for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

I know, but 'Nintendo' is the colloquial name for every Nintendo system since the Famicom.

why would a bruise immediately be a red flag? Kids play, run around and aren't really that attentive to their environments. Even if somebody seems to be a loner and rather calm like the girl you can get a bruise like that by simply slipping on ice.

The way he thinks is slightly different now that his adult mind is in his child body; it's hard to explain as the manga explains it somewhat later. 
>> ARTICLE
Kids can be smart, it's just rare. He reads allot of mature books and is probably trying to imprint on his dad who's a lawyer. Also Satoru is Kenyas best friend, you don't have to be abnormally perceptive to notice sudden changes in someone you've known so well.
>> ARTICLE
Well, he's called smart by his friends. Maybe he just reads a lot and aces all the tests. I had a kid like that back in my elementary school. He didn't do anything that could be perceived to be too smart for his age.

He's so many steps ahead of him! I hate villains like that! 

I'm really hoping the way they catch him involves tricking or trapping him rather than just revealing his identity. 
>> ARTICLE
> He's so many steps ahead of him!

The problem for Satoru just recently discovered that the abductions/killings weren't Yuuki and someone else who has been framing others for years.

This makes me think that while the killers identity will be revealed soon, Satoru will still have a hard time stopping him.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure Satoru knew all along that Yuuki wasn't the killer, he just couldn't think of any more suspects. 
At least next time he will know who he is up against with. That guy is smart but he already thinks he won, he wouldn't risk showing up to Satoru's arrest if he didn't think that, and that's gonna be his downfall ^I ^hope ^;__;

Honestly I love it. It adds so much to the story than just murder mystery. It keeps the audience at the edge of the seat waiting to see what he's plotting next.

The scenes are so artfully crafted too. I took a film class in HS and it is impossible for me not to see the scene cuts on beats in the music, or the characters moving to the music and how well the shots set up the scene.

Are we sure he's the murderer though? For all we know he may as well just be an accomplice or such. I'm not saying he's not the killer but the show could surprise us with something else.

He's definitely the most likely suspect for me at this point. Even if he isn't the murderer, I am sure that he must be associated with the abductions/killings.

Well if the OP is to be believed, yeah that guy is the murderer.

I noticed a slight glimmer while watching the op, I investigated and found this as a single frame: http://m.imgur.com/QgNzXT1

Remember - that guy's name wasn't on the suspect list, and we never saw him 18 years ago. As Satoru said, the pieces don't add up just yet, and at this point I'm pretty sure the twist will be [pure speculation](/s "that there are two or more killers.")

By the time I saw the butterfly I collapsed on my chair.
>> ARTICLE
The [pathetic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy) game was on point for the last few minutes of the episode. Sunny but kind of cloudy as he helps the kids in the park, gets more and more cloudy as he waits for the girl, a small bit of light through the clouds as he's about to give up and she arrives, overcast with a strong hint of rain during their conversation and an outpour of rain as he's arrested.

And that's just the weather of the scene.

Edit: There's something similar with the paper plane too but when it floated down the river I'd assumed it meant one of the kids had been kidnapped. It might still have happened since the murderer was at the scene.
>> ARTICLE
The paper plane floated down the river just as he finished talking about how helping people leads to them getting hurt. He helped those boys fly the plane better, and as a result, the plane flew into the canal, perfectly illustrating his point.

THAT'S how you make a cliffhanger. This show is a nonstop rollercoaster.

I like the intensity of the show in general. I'm always on edge when I watch it. The framing of [this](http://puu.sh/n4bQR/abb56564ef.jpg) scene had me terrified. I thought Airi was going to collapse or get jumped or something.

I'm thinking they set it up that way intentionally. I was really expecting her to get shot from behind or some shit.

>> ARTICLE
>WHAT ARE YOU?????

To be fair they are housewives and given the social culture of Japan or even the world in general, stay-at-home dads aren't very popular and seeing a dude with kids in general brings a heavy negative connotation in society.


If you had kids, would you be scared if you saw your child talking to some random woman? What about a man now? It's what society thinks so it isn't surprising the mother's act like that. Hell if that was Satoru's first appearance most of us would be thinking "the hell is a guy in his 20s-30s doing in the middle of the day at the park?"
>> ARTICLE
Scared? No, not when i'm that close by. Wary of potentially suspcious behaviour? Yes.

Point proven then; the women are *wary* of Satoru hanging with their kids.

My thoughts exactly! But, then I realized they were the mothers of those two airplane kids.

I know they are the mothers but, it's one of those "Men around children??? Must be a pedophile." kinda things.

It was so damn endearing to see Satoru help those kids out just like Yuuki did for him. That scene definitely shows that he's not only influenced the past, but the past has influenced and improved him as well. Plus, it was nice that note from his mom was finally used. 

But anyways

GOTTA GET BACK 

PACK TO THE PAST

... SATORU......Jack?
>> ARTICLE
I think Satoru was always a good kid. Just that his past trauma resulted in arrested development to a point where it felt like he was just in a daze in everyday life. But it definitely is cool to see him come out of his shell knowing that he can make a difference in the world and people around him.

Right right, I think that is a better point to make. His regret of being unable to "save"  Kayo or defend Yuuki probably shut him down

If you have some passing familiarity with Tokusatsu TV shows you'll see that he kind of did. That one is like THE costumed-superhero-aimed-towards-children line, and he was ripping it word for word.

It's super in-line with his character both in terms of his generation and his general awkwardness that he's basically quoting Power Rangers at Airi to cheer her up.
>> ARTICLE
>Anyone else think he was going to come up with a totally uncool line at the end? :p

Probably would have fit his character better given his awkwardness. But hey, Satoru looking cool in front of Airi is a plus for me at least. I personally ship them.

From what we have seen of his ability, we can safely assume that it has no palatable limitations in time or space. 

Moreover, they seem to occur strongly in times of great distress. So, the car accident in episode 1 sent him back a minute or so. His mother's murder 19 years...

It's a safe assumption that the more distressing the event, the more accurate his ability becomes.

My only concern is if Satoru needs to save himself. He doesn't have a problem saving others, but what about himself? He might run into a brick wall then.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds reasonable. However, my.opinion is that the "thing" that allows him to Revival

>Its like someone sends me back and tells me to fix it (ep1 iirc)

puts him back as far as he needs to go in order to fix something. In other words its not about the level of stress, **but the complexity of the problem** that he is facing, which makes Revival much more interesting than just being a stress reaction. At least for me.

The butterfly is probably alluding to the [Butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) which is a common trope of time travel stories and a major theme of this show. It says that small changes can lead to drastically different outcomes, or from my physics background, the future is extremely sensitive to initial conditions.  

It's one of my favourite concepts and I love seeing used in popular media. [Here is TVTropes' take on the subject. Obligatory TVTropes Warning](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail?from=Main.ButterflyEffect)

Hope Satoru can the ending he wants.
>> ARTICLE
Considering butterflies symbolize death, which is why they are also often seen in the anime Sakurako's Investigation (where they also explicitly explain the link between butterflies and dead bodies), I think they symbolize Satoru's power to prevent death (and his relationship with death via his power). Considering they also compared himself with a Shinigami trying to repair errors, I think it strengthens the death symbolism rather than the chaos theory symbolism.

>> ARTICLE
What about the reporter, he also had the red eyes during the first call, could it be something related to satorus ability, or hes alligment?
>> ARTICLE
No one is talking about that. I have two theories for the murderer. He either has the ability to see through time and plan his actions accordingly, or he can somehow make people murder others, and that's why they get the red eyes.

I think it's just a technique to identify who is a "suspect" and who you should be wary of.

I'd dislike it very much if the show goes this direction. I don't want the bad guy having super powers as well. Then it's a match of who can "out-power" the other and that would turn into a different kind of show.

>> ARTICLE
My theory on red-eyes is just someone who has some malicious intent. Because the teacher, Hinazuki's mom, TV reporter man, mysterious bad guy, they all had red eyes.

I just haven't figured out the malicious intent for a few of them...

EDIT: Or everyone is part Ishvalen, and it just shows in their eyes every now and then.
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I'm pretty sure it isn't malicious intent, but what Satoru suspects to be malicious intent. He's on the run from the law, and he doesn't want to trust a random person he doesn't know, and it could be a trap - so the eyes are red. But when he meets him, and saw that he came alone and that its the reporter, the eyes arent red anymore.

[This scene was so cool!](https://puu.sh/n4pEh.webm)
>> ARTICLE
Damn I didn't even notice the camera zooming out of his eye the first time around.  It just feels so right.

I had to make sense of what happened in that scene and broke everything down for myself.

*Sequence of events:*

1. Satoru walking with normal music but then it stops as time slows down.  Satoru slowly pushes his head up becoming more wide-eyed because he notices the guy staring at him.  The audio during the slow down sequence is a slowed down version of the rain falling while emphasizing the water reflecting off Satoru's head tilt up.

2. A panning close-up shot to the left of the red eyed suspect for a frame of reference.  The audio emphasizes the water dropping from his hat.

3. Cuts to Satoru's memory from 1st episode:

 A wide shot of the suspect and him crossing paths

 A close-up shot of his red eye to basically jog the audience's memory.

 A cut to more of a close-up shot into his red eye.

4. We go back into present and we're still in the close-up shot of the red eyed suspect.

5. We zoom back out of Satoru's eye revealing that it was a reflection from Satoru's eye emphasizing that he really saw the guy, making sure to the audience that Satoru never missed him.  Audio is like a distorted version of drums?  It's basically the audio done in dramas when something big happens.  Really cool.

6.  We zoom out even more for an establishing long shot, we see the two police officers by the two sides of the suspect with him in the middle for the foreground.  The background shows Satoru in cuffs by the police investigators.

7. Background shots with time stopping to give people a small break on what just occurred.  With the audio of a drum beating twice, kind of like a slowed down heart beat.

8. A close-up shot of Satoru's neck to the top of his head.  Looks like a well-needed reaction shot from his realization.

9. A cut to the suspect, with his god damn smug face.  The umbrella taking out most of the top of his head bringing in more mystery while having his glasses tinted from reflection covering his eyes.  I'm thinking his glasses were reflected like that as a metaphor for a big 'gotchu' to Satoru emphasizing his relish in victory.

10. There's then a drum beat heard as it cuts to an overhead shot panning to show how close they were to each other.  Holy crap.

11. A blue butterfly flies across the screen to the top right cliffhanging the audience and setting up the next episode.

Aww the manager came to save Airi and help Satoru, he's redeeming himself...

[Just kidding.](http://i.imgur.com/SDBRfBZ.jpg)  Fuck that guy.
>> ARTICLE
1) He's making a joke.

2) Dude is crushing on Airi pretty hard. I assume the age gap between them is less than with our MC. He's a genuinely good guy, and it seems he's learned to trust. I hope he gets together with her at the end; MC deserves a shot at Hinazuki when she's an adult.
>> ARTICLE
MC has an age gap of 11 years. And the manager is at least 3 years older than him.
>> ARTICLE
Though technically MC had a bigger age gap when he was hitting it off with Kayo.
>> ARTICLE
If they said Satoru saved her it would've caused her problems. This way at least it  looked like maybe "Satoru tried to kill her, she's innocent"
>> ARTICLE
Here's the thing, that line "I'm getting the credit for this" isn't what you think. I think it's his way of saying, "I know you didn't do this, I'm sorry for what I did, don't involve her anymore". The moment that he sees her trying to rescue her, he knows he fucked up. After seeing Airi's reaction to the previous events, and the current scene, he knows Satoru didn't do it. But he also knows that carrying Airi out will just get him arrested, so as a way to redeem himself, he's letting him leave out the back. Him 'taking credit' is to try and distance Satoru from these events if possible, which I think backfired and only made it worse. 
>> ARTICLE
This is correct. That's how the scene plays out in the manga. He still says, "I'm taking the credit," but Satoru internally says, "That must be his way of telling me he isn't going to rat on me," and then thanks him (although the manager does the dick thing of saying "Don't I deserve a thank you?" first). They left all that out in the anime for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
I mean he still ran into a burning building to grab Airi even though she just punched him in the face.

He also let Satoru get away so I like him considerably more than I did after last episode.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, as Satoru said, he is the kind of guy that usually does the right thing. Helping the police was the right thing for him last episode, but know that he knows that Airi believes he's innocent and saw him run into a burning building to save her, he helped Satoru.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. My take was also that he was actually being nice this time. That line sounded a lot less patronizing and more honest to Satoru than saying he wouldn't tell the police. 
>> ARTICLE
Watching this in my TV was definetly the best choice. I cannot believe it... All this suspense. 

**Here's what we know might help target the target:**

* Red Eyes
* Wears Glasses (This point might be a ed herring but still)  
* Dark Hair
* Has some kind of connection with the police, I think he would probably not be aloud to be that close to Satoru if he wasn't.
* Had access to pizzeria's shift sheet
* Knew Hiromi close enough to know he was a boy

Anything I'm missing? I personally think that the asshole manager probably gave the info on Satoru's shift hours and is purposefully helping frame Satoru so he can have ~~pizza girl~~ Anri to himself. The red eyes are everywhere in this show so trusting anyone other than Satoru will be a problem. What do you guys think?

**TL;DR:**

Glad Pizza Girl is not kill. Trust no one.
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure the red eyes is shown when something tense is happening etc. I think that the murderer has normal colored eyes.. And pretty sure that the murderer just took a glimpse of the schedule while he's in the staff room. Really doubt that the manager has anything to do with all these. It's really really far fetched that he would be an accomplice for a murder just because he wants the girl for himself?!?!?!?!?!

Gotta get in a hurry if you want the comment karma you know?


The first couple of comments here weren't even about this episode. It's kind of annoying with popular shows because the comments no longer seem to be engaged with the show itself and more about the race to see who comments the first meme/response/AOTY kind of stuff.
>> ARTICLE
This week's episode was very much a continuation of last week's episode, in terms of themes. [You can read some thematic discussion I did on last week's episode here](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-5-notes/). But if we boil it all down, it's all about *trust*.

Ever since the first episode, I pointed out how part of what stopped Satoru from being able to grow up, to advance with his life, was the wound opened in him when his friend Jun was found guilty for the series of murders, but it's not the murders themselves, or even how the adults tried to wrap up the children under the cover of childhood and ignorance that kept him so imprisoned, but that authority figures would not believe him, both the institution as symbolized by the police, and the personal hurt, where his own mother did not believe him.

The case of Airi's parents breaking up over stolen chocolate was a tad ridiculous, there's no real doubt about it, but what it was all about was how lonely and betrayed her father felt when his own wife wouldn't believe him. The stakes might have been tiny, but the pain over someone not believing you is real. And so he ran away, or was driven out, by his friends, and by his family, because if they don't trust you, are they really your friends, are they really your family?

So here we are with Airi, who's totally in love with Satoru, because even though she's angry over people not trusting others, or betraying their trust (and this is what she punched the manager over), she'll accept Satoru not giving her his full trust. This is what everything in this episode revolves around, how Satoru's mother's old co-worker trusts in him, not rationally, because "She wouldn't have raised a killer for a son" is but a rationalization, how Airi's mother would believe her daughter's judgment, believe it enough to go against doctors' orders and the police's express demands. This is about paying for one's past mistakes, the journalists who didn't believe Satoru as well. This is about paying for past mistrust with trust, against all evidence, at this point.

And then we get to how the episode ended, [where the Manager is proven right](http://i.imgur.com/p2zxb0U.jpg). Where the other thematic thread of the last two episodes, a common refrain in time-travel stories, rears its ugly head. What is Satoru trying to do? He's trying to fix things. He's trying to make Airi feel better. He [doesn't think himself to be a hero](http://i.imgur.com/Qt8rn4Z.jpg), but is [trying to imitate one](http://i.imgur.com/dAIdmHA.jpg). And then he delivers to Airi the worst twist of all, "I'm glad I trusted in you," which just smacks in her face again that it's this trust that led to him being in chains now. His forgiveness [doesn't make her feel relieved](http://i.imgur.com/ZcLaczI.jpg), but it's [damning her even more](http://i.imgur.com/QsLvgST.jpg) in her own eyes.

Satoru has good intentions. He means to leave things better behind him than they were before, but instead he ends up making it worse and worse, such as with the kids whose joy he tried to increase, only for their airplane to end up [washed away in the stream](http://i.imgur.com/MT1lnB7.jpg). And here is the question of where to go next. The episode repeated again the cruel irony where he's told to let bygones be bygones, except for him they can still be changed, but if each time he changes it it gets worse, isn't it better to fix things by taking responsibility for all the extra hurt he's caused, in his case if not in the original past, but by trying to fix it and now getting Airi involved, and who knows who else? Because he can make amends, by taking the blame for his mother's murder.

But Airi has given him the counter-point, to keep trying, and that until it's done, no one knows how it'd turn out, so why not keep trying? This is the trust he was really talking about, because he said that whether through capture *or revival*, this might be the last time he talks to Airi, because she renewed his determination, no matter how much worse things would get, he'll keep trying to fix it all. And this is the gambit of the time-traveler, not just his own suffering, but actually making it worse each time he leaps - so he has more incentive to keep leaping, to fix it all, as the situation keeps getting worse, but also an incentive to stop leaping before it gets even *worse*, and especially so long he can take all the blame himself.

And then, they ended the episode, right when it was clear there'd be a leap, and it still hurt and made me want the next episode right now. A leap, before he could go and see clearly who the killer is. A leap, and another opportunity for him to try and fix things, or give up. Will he be worthy of Airi's trust? Will he try to make a lie of his own past words, and be a *hero*? We'll find out, and damn the patience they ask of me, to see whether Satoru ends up a god of death, or an angel of mercy.

([Check out my blog](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/) or [the specific page for all my write-ups on BokuMachi/ERASED](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-notes/) if you enjoy reading my stuff.)
>> ARTICLE
Dude your ability to read into that was amazing! Definitely checking out your blog, I wish to learn to be able to extract as much as you from stuff like this. Thanks for the post!
>> ARTICLE
Thanks! And the trick is, well, to *do*. Finish an episode, or an arc, or a series, and ask yourself, "What was this show's themes? And what were its messages?" It's ok to be wrong, because half the time "finding messages" that are interesting isn't about what the author *intended*, but what they said besides, and managing to make a convincing case for it. So focus less on being right, and more on finding something you can support.

As for this show in particular, the last two episodes were very clear about "trust" being the message, so the skill you see here is less my ability to identify themes, and more my ability to describe them nicely, and using more words than is strictly necessary, but that's half the fun. And well, how to tie more and more stuff into it.

Speculation, since the serial killer is someone that's close to Satoru I'd say it's down to the old tv reporter - who's friends with satoru's mom - or the teacher. It'd be stupid if it was a random guy, they both have a lot of information about Kayo (the teacher through satoru and the the reporter through satoru's mom).

The thing is, if it was the tv reporter it'd be too obvious to satoru's mom, if she had just told him about the girl and suddenly she disappears so he'd have no alibi and it would be too obvious for the mom to catch him so if it was him he would be caught.

The teacher had everything going for him. He was recognized in the "current era", he's easily trusted so he knows what's going on in the families etc so it's easy for him to frame someone, it explains why the first time satoru went back he didn't change much since satoru talked to him and explained what he was doing (sorta) so the teacher could just manipulate everything according to that... I just don't know how that would explain the neighbor town killings and how that involves Kenya since he was talking to him as well about Kayo. Any thoughts? Sorry about the formatting, I'm horrible at writing long posts
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I feel like it's 100% the teacher.  I love the show, but they haven't really done a good job setting up a lot of good candidates for the culprit.

It's literally impossible for the reporter to be the killer because Satoru's mom knew who the killer was and wanted to meet the reporter to tell him.

Yuki Kajiura composes the music.  
Yuuki Aoi voices Kayo.  
Yuuki is the name of the guy kid Satoru hung out with.  
Yuki (snow) is a motif in this show.  

Or maybe there are just a lot of Yukis out there.

The song is called Re:Re: by Asian Kung-Fu Generation. Apparently it came out over a decade ago. I don't really know much about them, just googled it when I started the episode cuz I was curious as well.

This anime is fearless.

Even though it sucked for Satoru, I'm glad they had the guts to arrest him. It's something I didn't expect to happen. This show really keeps me on my toes.

ERASED is not conformed with the #7 place in myanimelist, every episode keeps getting better and better, this is is so awesome.

Its not as infinitely hyped as OPM was. ERASED will remain high on the MAL placings for quite a long time to come i think. ERASED personally rivals that of the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya for quality and probable replay-ability for me at least.
>> ARTICLE
From what I see here almost all of you guys hate that red-eyed bastard. I on the other hand like that guy. It is so rare to see a cunning and crafty bad character like this one. He's just so realistic unlike most anime villains. I sincerely hope he'll devastate more lives in a way that will make me cry every week...

That was a line worthy of a hero indeed.

Can we assume next episode will be set during his childhood because of the butterfly at the end?

Prediction:  Nishizono is the man with the hat's wife's name and he took it when he married her for political influence.

Okay. My only gripe with the show...and maybe it's a cultural thing or something...but what the fuck is Satoru doing walking around in public? Isn't his face plastered on the news? Aren't people looking out for him? Why is he so willing to meet at a cafe, or walk through the park? 

Otherwise, another amazing episode. Fantastic ending.
>> ARTICLE
Another fantastic episode. Wonder where he will end up next maybe before the meet with Airi
>> ARTICLE
Airi continues to be awesome. The female cast is just exceptional. Being Satoru is suffering, but he is such a great MC--his thoughts leaking out is enjoyable.

The analogy between the Grim Reaper and him was pretty cool and I would still read that manga if he wrote it.

I just really fucking love this show.
>> ARTICLE
This is in the running to be my favorite anime ever
>> ARTICLE
Unpopular opinion probably, but I haven't really been feeling this show for the last two episodes. First 4 episodes were all about showing you information (contrary to telling you about that information) and were overall a masterclass in rhythm, but I feel like the pacing is considerably worse in 5 and 6 and they're doing a lot more badly handled exposition scenes where they just tell you what's going on, which is getting a bit boring.

Also the characters always seem to know what's going on (Like two of the main cast showing up at Airi's house just on time to save her, what's going on with that?) and I dislike that.

I hope it picks up towards the end.

I don't know is that because I read the manga, but [manga spoiler] (/s "isn't there too much of his face shown? It's kind of easy to recognize him")

About time we got to the number his mom wrote on a piece of paper!  It felt pretty good to see another good guy trying to help out Satoru.  I feel like I am feeling the same sense of relief he is probably going through.  
>> ARTICLE
Still don't have a clue who the killer is but I can't wait to go back and pick up all the clues once we find out. 

The ending to this episode was brilliant, set's up the revival for next episode while still ending on the chilling scene of the killer staring him down, the easy way would have been either not set up the revival or end with him having gone back ala episode 1 but they went for the best of both worlds making great use of an established idea (the butterfly). 

The show continues to pull me in, the descriptions of the version of events for this timeline though were brutal, poor Hanazuki. 

Finally confirmation that the guy in Kayos house is the moms boyfriend, don't know why I cared so much about that fact but I did.

Wait, the reporter had red eyes just like the killer... That can't be good.

Just saw a story (maybe Vice or AJ+) on Japan's criminal justice system; they have something like a 99% conviction rate bc of all the false confessions. (A fun-fact if you weren't depressed enough after this ep).

TL;DR: *FUUUUUUUUCK*

Just a theory; but what if the killer also had the revival power... would explain how he keeps getting away with it

I just binged all current episodes and it is 3am, It's almost impossible not to. I'll be joining in the waiting game for now on.

Also, the color palette (red and blue) and the concept of revivals really reminds me of [Ghost Trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Trick:_Phantom_Detective)

Question: WHY ISNT ANYBODY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THE CHILDHOODS DETECTIVES EYES WERE RED WHEN HE FIRST TURNED AROUND?

Lol, finding out the killer is pretty much easy now... [ [CLICK IF YOU WANT!](http://imgur.com/2bUoBPD)](/spoiler)

The police are always conveniently stupid or incompetent in these shows...
>> ARTICLE
I have some questions because its quite hard to understand for me.

Satoru said "So he killed him (Hiromi) to keep himself off the list of suspects". Is he talking about the murderer of his mother or Jun Shiratori? I simply dont understand from where he dragged the attention off by killing a boy who could be mistaken with a girl

2nd thing when Satoru said "Its all camouflage to draw attention away from himself". Does it mean the murderer of Satorus mom put child porn related stuff to drag all of the attention to Jun Shiratori?

Im so confused  ._. I need something like a summary of the whole episode
>> ARTICLE
>Is he talking about the murderer of his mother or Jun Shiratori?

He's talking about the murderers responsible for Hiromi's death - which can be tied back to Kayo. The police concluded that Hiromi was killed because he was mistaken to be a girl. So they compiled a list of people who did not know Hiromi's gender. 
>I simply dont understand from where he dragged the attention off by killing a boy who could be mistaken with a girl

Satoru realizes why the murderer killed Hiromi. He knows who she is. When the investigation concluded that the list must be made of suspects who don't know Hiromi, his name wouldn't be there. He successfully throws the blame on other people.

>Does it mean the murderer of Satorus mom put child porn related stuff to drag all of the attention to Jun Shiratori?

I think he's talking about the murderer planting suspicious items - like a hammer, picture of children - on Jun to make him seem to be the murderer. Perhaps the pornography that he was hiding made it worse, but the murderer definitely planted stuff in Jun's room. 

>> ARTICLE
Did he see who that guy was ? And see who he is ? Or didn't he just notice it was the same guy, but no clue who he is ?

If he is arrested, how will he be able to go back in time. Or can he still go back and have a second try at making things right 
>> ARTICLE
To me it seemed like he only recognized the murder but not who he really was. We saw it from Satorou's perspective and we only say the lower half of his face unable to identify who it is.
>> ARTICLE
> Did he see who that guy was ? And see who he is ? Or didn't he just notice it was the same guy, but no clue who he is ?

I love how now we know exactly who did all of this, but at the same time we have no idea who he is so we have no idea who did all of this still

> I'm probably way too excited to see where we jump to next week with the next shift in time

Yeah it has me super curious too. Will he be back to the start again? It would feel weird for them to show some of the stuff he's accomplished already again but hey more Hinazuki so I wouldn't mind :p
>> ARTICLE
So true! More Hinazuki is always good. If he goes back to elementary he better take Hinazuki and run away instead of just trying to do the same stuff over. 
>> ARTICLE
The past/present mechanic kind of reminds me of that Ni no Kuni videogame. Or Zelda Link to the Past.
>> ARTICLE
Heck yeah! I love Ni No Kuni. I'm totally looking forward to the sequel.
>> ARTICLE
Really enjoying the adaptation so far, but I can't help but worry a bit about how they'll manage to fit what's left of the manga into the last 6 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I think they've done a phenomenal job so far.  They intend to end the manga and anime at the same time so it gives me hope that they'll adapt the rest well.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really understand the part about Hiromi and why it was significant, so I thought a bit and decided to make a concise explanation for anyone else confused. 

All of the murderer's victims were girls. Suddenly, a boy is killed, but the boy could've been mistaken for a girl. Going off the premise that the murderer only kills girls, the police think he/she can't be someone who would've known Hiromi was a boy. That fact removes all suspects from the school who interact with the students and would know respective genders, shifting the suspicion to someone who doesn't know the kids as well (e.g. Yuuki). 

However, Satoru deduces that the murderer killed Hiromi on purpose to have exactly the above happen as it would "remove him from the suspect list." This deduction means the murderer is actually someone from inside the school [(which is consistent with ](/s "whom most of us suspect already")). 

Edit: spoiler tag
>> ARTICLE
So that was revival being triggered in the end right?


Anyway this episode was pretty interesting to say the least. I found the exchange between Satoru and Airi about the exchange about the Grim Reaper and the parallels in their story to be quite engaging.  Speaking of them, their chemistry (Satoru and Airi) is interesting to say the least; it doesn't feel like a romance more-so it feels like they both rely on each other for their own needs. Airi seems to be the only string attaching Satoru to this timeline with his mom gone and Satoru is one of the few people Airi genuinely worries about and cares for.



I just wonder some things though:

Satoru pretty much solely trusted Airi given the events that happened with the pizza manager; what prompted him to call the number his mother wrote and immediately trust the guy?   


And I'm curious why Satoru was more worried about the death of Kayo than the death of a core member of his gang (Hiromi). I understand to the most part that Satoru thinks he could have saved Kayo and that saving her would prevent the rest of the murders but I'm surprised he didn't show more emotion when he saw Hiromi alive again considering they were friends and all.


Well considering the revival was triggered (assuming it was), I wonder how far back Satoru will be taken. Will he be sent back to the same original time like many time-travel stories do or will he be sent to the time when Kayo was abducted? Guess I gotta wait a while to find out.

That butterfly at the end was ... something. It gave me the feeling that shit's gonna be real, just like when I first saw the butterfly in Steins;Gate. The slow-mo, time freeze also helped too.

This episode was very well done. This show is a fucking amazing adaptation from A-1. With all the controversial stuffs going on around A-1 and Asterisk War, I hope people realize A-1 still makes great shows  and I wouldn't mind them making generic anime just to keep their business going.

Seriously, this is one of the only shows that managed to keep me at the edge of my seat throughout the entire series. It's like something is going to happen at anytime, anywhere. Also: airi is best girl hands down

God dammit, I wish I'd watch this when it's finished, the urge to binge is too great.

Plus it's not like I have much business being here in the discussion threads with me being like "OMG BEST ANIMU EVER, I LOVE IT" most of the times, because that's what most people are saying, so there's not much to gain. 

Too late now.

This anime is absolutely GLORIOUS, a masterpiece in the making if you will. Story structure and presentation is out of the park and after 6 episodes I still can't get enough of Satoru's VA. As little bits of the mystery are being pieced together I find myself more and more intrigued and I believe its a kin to the methods they are utilising in a sort of "filling in the blanks" style with use of flashbacks to boot.

EDIT: Show probably has my favourite ED of the season just to top it off.

Guys I... I caved and read the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Do you guys think the fact that Airi has repeatedly said "Baka nano" (Are you stupid?) multiple times now mean anything, seeing as it's kind of Kayo's catchphrase.

>> ARTICLE
From this episode I thought that there was a very memorable theme of the negative effects of changing time for the better. The scene where he helps the boys with their airplane is symbolic of the help he received of Yuuki. But like Yuuki, he also was going down the same path of being mistaken for the murderer. 

His manga story reflects his current situation as well because it tells a protagonist trying to help a single person but ends up hurting more than he intended. The scene where he and Airi were talking showed the plane in the water symbolizing that even though he helped, in the end the kids were better off with a crappy plane that wouldn't go in the river. 

There is just so much in this anime packed in each episode that I spend my time watching it as a viewer and analyzing it as a student. This is one of the few times that a work of literature/media has gotten me so intrigued to the point where I want to understand everything.

EDIT: I also want to note that one butterfly at the end that would signify another revival like the first two times.
>> ARTICLE
That's why he sucks as a mangaka. He doesn't have enough faith in himself. But Airi has worked her magic, and Satoru will start to change for real from here on.
>> ARTICLE
With how well the show started off I didn't think they'd be able to maintain the quality consistently, but I'm now convinced that it will be a solid 10 through Episode 12.
>> ARTICLE
Whats with the red eyes? It's assumed they mean that person is bad, but the journalist guy was shown with them then he helped out satoru.  Same thing with Kenya in episode 2. 
>> ARTICLE
It's the anime screwing with viewers, basically.
>> ARTICLE
I really hope Satoru gets to talk to Yuuki. Since he won't talk to any one about the case. 
>> ARTICLE
The episode felt like 5 minutes long :(
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader i am kinda scared if this will get a rushed ending... which is almost guarenteed. Episode 6 included, the story is up till chapter 18 of the manga, which will end with about 48 chapters. That means 1/2 of the anime is about 1/3 of the manga currently and even in these 6 episodes we already have things cut short. 24 Episodes or a second season would have been better to fully tell this awesome story imho. 

That being said, this is still one of the best anime i watched that came out in the past year.
>> ARTICLE
I'm the type of person doesn't care too much about reading spoilers  while watching anime.

This is the one time I'm actually mad at myself that I spoiled this anime a bit by reading a wiki page(not a big enough spoiler to reveal the murderer thankfully). I'm pretty sure ERASED is going on my favorites list next to Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
His manga idea is a really good one. Someone needs to get on that

Guys can you please tell me which manga chapters have been covered by the anime until now and if I can read them safely without spoilers ?? 
>> ARTICLE
As of now, you'll be spoiler-free up to and including Chapter 18. Be careful not to read the title of the chapters, though, as the titles are time-stamps of what period of time he will be in, so that's a miniature spoiler.

So, I might just be going a bit too far into this, but since I haven't seen a comment about it might as well. We saw one of the suspects being [Shinji Sakashita](http://i.imgur.com/LL7MUfs.jpg) and then literally minutes later the kids have the name [Shinji](http://i.imgur.com/I5zJJtg.jpg) written on their paper plane? I mean, I realise it's a first name and it'd be pretty weird for these random kids to be related to one of the suspects, I just thought it was odd to have these same names appear right after each other. 
>> ARTICLE
the Temptation to read the manga is too damn strong. 24 minutes a week of BokuMachi is not enough to sate this thirst. Video games, school, work, riveting Internet arguments, none of that is helping me get this show out of my head. It's like waiting every Sunday last season for OPM; I just can't get enough. 

Stay strong, comrades. At least it's an anime series we are addicted to, not crack cocaine.
>> ARTICLE
As the scene slowed at the end, I had the same realization as Satouru. Just thought, "it's you, you gigantic fuck." A part of me wanted Satouru to jump his ass there, but hopefully this will be enough to go off of for Satorou to use when he jumps back to the past.
>> ARTICLE
See, If I'm Satoru at the end, I'm screaming at that guy and accusing him of killing his mom. Not because the police would arrest him, or it would fluster the killer at all, but it would most likely result in him making a move (whether it be moving the umbrella up, or turning to walk away) that would reveal more of his face enough that Satoru could hopefully recognize him, and would know who the murderer is when he goes back to the past.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I just really love the OP. It really fits this show.

Its hard restraining myself from not reading the Manga.

Fuck me. I went to the wiki to figure out exactly what the title translates to (The Town Where Only I am Missing) and for some reason scrolled down to the middle of the page and read like two lines.

Not that it spoils the show for me, but that was a stupid move by me.


>> ARTICLE
its always two or one lines, i read like one line in the grimgar wiki. There goes the suspense for that show.  
>> ARTICLE
Glad I'm not the only one who gets tempted to do stuff like this. I don't even get why. I obviously don't want things ruined for me but I guess for some reason I think my curiosity will be satisfied with just a peak
>> ARTICLE
So basically what im thinking is, the manager is less of a dick now but still a dick lol.
Also the murderer is the one that followed airi out of the hospital already and informed the police too, cuz when she left the hospital the guys guarding her room were still there but there was still someone waiting for her to leave outside to follow her

God that awkward moment where he said something out loud again was so funny and embarrased Airi was kawaii af. 

He got arrested i was like meh wtf y u do dis, then they also showed the killer was there watching him and im pretty sure it triggered his ability. The butterfly shows its triggering which resembles the butterfly effect. Im rlly hoping to see some more baka nano :3.

Also for people shipping Satoru and Airi, satoru is 29 and Airi is only 17 lol.

People suspecting the reporter to be the killer, thats impossible. His mom knew who the killer is and called the reporter to share her information. Not only that but he also helped Satoru. He ran to the hospital to visit Airi, the killer obviously followed Airi there so at the same time the reporter should still be inside the hospital talking to Airi's mother. That would be more than enough evidence to say the reporter is not the killer

29 and 17 is totally fine, specially in Japan.

Literally the most exciting thing every week and we just hit the halfway point!  I really want some english publisher to pick up the comic already.
>> ARTICLE
So, As we all know, imagery means a lot in this show, and I've been pulling screen grabs from various things and there's 2 things I think I've picked up on. 
1. [Shapes of Faces](http://imgur.com/GefIYdW) and face detail, [Matter A Lot](http://imgur.com/cywBqG4). [Teacher](http://imgur.com/uud4vOB) and [Killer](http://imgur.com/Z4AGani). [Pizza Shop Owner and Politician](http://imgur.com/8cqylGa) 

 Now the killer's picture has 2 circles on it. The blue circle, is a rain drop that is in the foreground. If you play the scene it moves down as he moves past him. Now the RED circle, doesn't move, at all. It stays right there, like it's [PINNED](http://imgur.com/IVXTW0i) in place. In the previous scenes the detectives have rain on their uniforms, but he's sitting under the umbrella. I feel like this adds more evidence that the man in the Pizza shop is actually the killer or..knows him.

2. They rarely, if at all, show something that does not have a meaning. And one of the things that stood out was specifically [This Picture](http://imgur.com/GefIYdW). This is a picture is shown not once, but [Twice](http://imgur.com/AtNhwlH). I have no idea what the significance of the 2nd picture is, with it being shaded, but the first picture is clearly a picture of Sachiko and Sawada (Reporter).
 
*Below is a theory that disproves itself in the scene* - I left it in, in case someone can pull some sort of info from it. 

Now, here's one thing that REALLY caught my eye about that picture. As I said before, they usually don't just put up information for no reason. Everything has it's place. I honestly think, that the girl on the left of the [First Picture](http://imgur.com/GefIYdW), is [Airi's Mother](http://imgur.com/3uCCEgI)...Which doesn't work...as Sawada is the one talking to her in the bed. 

>> ARTICLE
My god... the load of things what he should've done differently in this situation:

I'd probably do a dead drop a letter with lighter next to it telling Airi to burn the letter after reading it which would avoid this situation entirely by telling Airi where to put the letter in the next dead drop and so forth until encryption between parties can be established.

I'm surprised that he still walk around without any make up or anyway to cover up his face... trying the same exact thing he did in today society can get you found pretty quick within the hour of being accused of a crime.

As for hunting the bastard, obviously, Airi is a target, so she is automatically a bait, whether she want it or not. So I'd stalk her with a form of weapon with me (Crowbar, lead pipe, or whatnot) and wait for the bastard to try something. Even though having a weapon while stalking would probably doom any chance of clearing your name, you would at least save Airi and others from this murderer.

Essentially all in all, he should've try to educate himself on how to go **black op** on the bastard and stop being so damn predictable. But that just me.
>> ARTICLE
We're pretty much at the middle of the series, and we've just recieved a LOT more data about the case.

So, as an Umineko fan, I'd like to ask any manga reader:  
Can we, the anime watchers, deduce who the killer is with the information provided to us up to this episode?

Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I've been wondering this since the first episode. Can someone explain this to me? Please, stuff like this has been confusing me about anime for years now.

It's pretty obvious that they're going for some sort of romantic interest with Airi and Satoru, or at least they're going to keep hinting at it forever. In the first episode Satoru's mother seemed 100% for him having a relationship with this girl after meeting her once, knowing that she's in high school. Satoru is 29, she's 17 apparently; and yeah they're just anime characters and you can't really pin an iron clad age on them, but still... Not sure what the age of consent is in Japan, but it's almost unfathomable for me to think that people would be okay with this or encourage this anywhere in the first world. 12 years is a sizable age difference at any point in life, and it's astronomical when one party is in high school.

There's all sorts of weird stuff like this that I see in anime. Like nobody thinking twice about first cousins dating and getting married? Is shit like this normal in Japan? If not, why is so much of it in anime?

I genuinely want to know, I cannot comprehend this trope (is that what it is?) and it has bothered me for years.

I just watched all the episodes up to the newest one, going to re-watch them tomorrow with my brother and girlfriend.  This is looking like it might be my favorite anime ever, let alone AOTS.  It's absolutely outstanding on every level, from story to animation to music.  I've become so invested in the characters that the roller coaster of CUTE, OH FUCK, CUTE, OH FUCK, CUTE, OH FUCK is giving me emotional whiplash.

The first thing I did after finishing episode 4 was pour myself a big glass of whiskey.  Oh what's this, there's still some left in the bottle?  Not for long.
>> ARTICLE
Plain speculation at this time, but going by the title "Erased" and " The Town Without Me" I'm inclined to believe that satoru is going to die in the end. Sacrifice himself to ensure a future for all 3 lead women.

I hope we'll see more of Airi, or that Satoru and Airi get together in the end. And fuck that red eyed fucker.
>> ARTICLE
I *just noticed* that when Satoru's childhood is depicted in the anime (whether through flashback or revival) the screen is widescreen like a movie, while when we're shown present-day happenings it's like a regular screen. This fits with the film reels shown sometimes when Satoru's trying to figure stuff out. Not sure what it means cinematically but heck if it isn't cool.

Also, THESE FUCKING CLIFFHANGERS. I can't deal. They're great though. I still think that the teacher is involved somehow.

Tiny note: the kid's airplane said Shinji on it, presumably the kid's name. And the verb "shinjiru" in Japanese means "to believe in". With everything going on in the show, lucky coincidence (I mean, Shinji is a fairly common name), or intentional? Who knows.
>> ARTICLE
So uh, what's with peoples eyes going red? I've noticed throughout the whole series that seemingly random characters will suddenly have red eyes like the murderer for a scene then never again. It happened in this episode with the reporter dude as well.

Pure speculation right, but we already have precedence for supernatural abilities with Satoru right? So maybe the killer has a possession ability or something? Somehow that would feel like a cop out though, unless it's done really well.

Fuck this show is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
So I'm coming to the game late, I'd admit but I have one solid rule for this show and that's "never trust a man with red eyes." There have been enough cases where the person with the red eyes have done some messed up shit that when reporter dude was introduced, i immediately thought he sold out Satoru's mother.
>> ARTICLE
Never trust the Ishvalans.

I think we're finally getting somewhere. Red eye guy is the killer 10/10

damn it why didn't she just tell him over the phone instead of meeting up

Hey now that is too logical! We want our Airi x Satoru moments!

Speaking of which, Airi's phone GPS was on so that might explain why the police showed up (other than tailing her of course).
>> ARTICLE
In the manga they both admit they should talk over the phone instead of meeting. But they think they want to see each other regardless. It was really sweet how they were both thinking the same thing. Too bad the anime cut out that part.
>> ARTICLE
ERASED has got this emotional pendulum that has me swinging from despairing in one week to really warm and hopeful to the next.

This week has it being a crushing low that is yet offset by a sense of hope at the end.

I cant get off this perplexing ride.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, got arrested. Better reload the route.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I wasn't really feeling this episode to be honest. The execution is just lacking that special something, the episodes dealing with kid Satoru handled it much better in my opinion. 

For example the relationship between Satoru and Airi feels very superficial, particularly her devotion. Outside of the visuals, the final scene just lacked the necessary impact that it was going for. I don't actually feel for Airi in failing to help Satoru.

On the other hand, Satoru's motivation to help Kayo felt genuine because there's a lot more to it than just saving one girl. It's to save his mother, to prove his friend is an innocent man and to get the murderer. Him actually growing closer to Kayo, as well as her breaking out of her shell in the process was engaging. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the relationship between Satoru and Airi feels real enough. Airi isn't helping Satoru just because. She saw him saving a kid, and there's what happened to her father too. 

Maybe you just like what's going on in the past better. I get it. But that doesn't mean what happens in the present is necessarily worse or lacking on depth. It's just your taste.
>> ARTICLE
I think most agree though that Airi's story about her father was a bit over the top, and for how they presented it only in the previous episode, it's already being used by both Airi(and her mother) as a driving factor in their decisions. 

I just think that Kayo at this point is a much better written character, and that's not me saying that I want them to get back to the past, that's me saying that I want Airi's character to be better fleshed out.
>> ARTICLE
So the next episode will open with a revival, right?? 

Also, it's so cute how adult Satoru is letting things slip just like young Satoru was. "Crap, I said that out loud." should become a thing 
>> ARTICLE
Are we not going to talk about how the kids' airplane was floating down the stream while Satoru was talking with Airi? Does that not seem ominous to anyone else?
>> ARTICLE
Saw a couple comments further up that reasoned it signified the "try to help, but only make things worse" train of thought. He attempted to help the kids out, but in the end they lost their toy because of it.
>> ARTICLE
GODFUCKINDAMMIT! This is a movie tier show right here! What point will Satoru go back to now? A butterfly appeared right? Signifying he'll do a revival.

That cunning predator. I wouldn't be surprised if he did something to those boys playing airplanes by the river. He was always creeping on Satoru and the plane floating down the river is a baaaaaad sign. Then again he only targeted girls before, but he'd be able to frame Satoru if he did. Next Friday can't come any sooner! 1-2 punch cliffhanger right there.

the manga about the grim reaper sounds dope not gonna lie
>> ARTICLE
I love how the title fits in so well with what goes on in the series.
>> ARTICLE
My reaction to this episode : I yelled a huge "Oh le fils de pute !" and my neighbor knocked on the wall because I was making too much noise. Fuck my life.

("Fils de pute" is French for "Son of a bitch")
>> ARTICLE
If someone here is well-versed in Japan's criminal justice system, am I correct to assume that the guy is basically screwed if police is absolutely certain he is guilty and accuses him of murdering his mother? Or do we assume that he was framed so perfectly that no attorney would be able to help him? I remember reading about a Japanese man who spent decades in jail after police made him plead guilty though he was completely innocent.
>> ARTICLE
Actually the legal system I believe is pretty similar. In certain cases, even in the U.S., there are circumstances where an innocent man is simply perfectly placed into the position of the culprit. Pleading innocent is obviously the honest way, but if someone pleads innocent and is found guilty, his sentence is usually harsher. If he pleads guilty, he'll have guarenteed jail time, but he might have a lighter sentence. It all depends on evidence and circumstance, and that's why the law system is so confusing.
>> ARTICLE
I want to keep mentioning the red eyes because I feel like it has a meaning in the story. From my assumption this time I feel like the red/crimson eyes mean that the character will be relevant to the story. Kinda like how you are able to differentiate anime characters to background ones.

This must be the weakest episode of the anime so far but still it's so good, damn that revival cliffhanger. I can't wait for next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Right there on the last scene when Satoru gets arrested and sees the murderer, does he have the right to stop and say that that man is the murderer and report him to the police right then and there?
>> ARTICLE
I'd do it. It might scare the murderer into making a mistake or make him reveal more of his face.

Satoru really needs to get his shit together and learn to control his Revival.

That bastard murderer with his smug-ass face... I really want to see him outsmarted.

My summary of this episode: 

PIZZA GIRL MADE IT

Oh look he finally looked at that slip of paper

The gossiping mothers pretty much foreshadow that Satoru isn't going to have it rough for a while

Looks like he still has the habit of saying what he's thinking

Welp they followed her

Pizza Girl is sad when he says he's glad that he trusted her(which indirectly led him to getting caught). This kind of ties in to how he tries to making things better but he gets other people hurt like the grim reaper.

Huh, who's that guy with the umbrella...FUCK
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else notice that, when first called by Satoru, the [freelance reporter](http://imgur.com/WTsQihA) had **deep red eyes**, just like the [man in black](http://imgur.com/ytBm5oN) at the end of the episode? Either they are the same person or we've got some Saeka-esque (Durarara!!) shit going on here - or somebody fucked up the colouring.

His manga idea about the Shinigami is actually really good. I'd read that for sure.

Also, the murderer reminds me more and more of the butterfly guy from Sakurako. 

The hat, the red eyes, the butterfly. (Then again the butterfly is more part of Satoru)

The direction of that last scene was supreme. What cliff-hanger. Can't wait for the next episode!

YESSS THE BUTTERFLY IS BACK (assuming revival??? is the butterfly what triggers it? Or is it just some extra detail to represent time or some shit).

CANNOT WAIT FOR EPISODE 7

AND HOLY SHIT AIRI IS ALIVE DID NOT SEE THIS COMING. 

IS THAT COUNCILMAN INVOLVED OR NOT??? 

edit: did they really make a meta reference to their own manga? The explanation with the grim reaper?

Also ok guys we finally figured out how hinazuki died :( you all were right :(((( (assuming what the tv guy said was the truth). 
>> ARTICLE
If hes going to prison, is it possible for him to meet with Yuuki?
>> ARTICLE
I know most people want to binge read the manga but for me this show is so good that i want to savour it instead. 

I think that people who would end up watching all the episodes in one go after it finishes airing would lose some of that amazing tension that builds up when you watch it on a weekly basis.
>> ARTICLE
the OST really sounds like SAO's
>> ARTICLE
SAO was made by A1-Pictures and so is this.
>> ARTICLE
Crazy theory: Airi is Hinazuki's relative, perhaps a younger cousin or maybe even sister, and she picked up the "baka nano?" from her
>> ARTICLE
Why did pizza girl try to escape through the front door of a hospital, where there are detectives crawling all over the place? And those same detectives think she is an accomplice! Like she really thought she wouldn't be caught? This whole meeting between Satoru and her seemed incredibly risky just to ask her who she thinks the killer might be, especially considering they just talked on the phone to arrange said meaning. Like, you couldn't ask her over the phone?

And honestly, it seemed stupid of Satoru to continue seeing pizza girl after she already almost got killed after becoming involved in this whole mess, and the manager said earlier in the episode to Satoru not to keep getting her involved. I mean I guess the killer was already after her, but it still seems like an unnecessary risk to meet up, especially for Satoru.

Other than those minor problems I had with this episode, it was still pretty good. I'm definitely excited to see more.
>> ARTICLE
In the manga both Satoru and Airi admit is stupid to meet each other. They could just talk about the killer over the phone. Yet, they still couldn't help wanting to see each other. It's actually really cute. Too bad the anime cut it out.
>> ARTICLE
That would have been nice to see. I'll probably just pick up the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else think that the killer has some sort of power as well? 
>> ARTICLE
I liked that the first part of the show was pure exposition to clear some things up, while the second part was more tense and mysterious.

I also just noticed that in the ED, young Satoru (at least, I assume it's him) skips at the same beat as the music.

>> ARTICLE
Ok, we now have the killer's name, but it's not enough to identify him. It's pretty obvious but still, is there any definite proof that actually points out at someone specific?
>> ARTICLE
I seriously think that the murderer might be Satoru's mother's friend. We don't know what was he doing during the episode and he knew satoru's family since the begining. Also dem red eyes.

I hate having to wait another week to see what happens next. But at the same time I love the suspense they've created. Not many shows can do that.

Ok Airi is fine and satoru is the hero he want to be, that's good. 

But fuck you coat-creepy-man

Is it just me or did you guys hear that sound effect at the beginning of the episode? It sounded like something straight out of halo 5 lol. Just something I noticed.

Is this anime going to conclude at 12 episodes or is it just going to cliffhanger. I would hate it to not finish properly.

Is it weird that I hate the manager guy more than the actual villain?

Well I don't regret reading the manga, because I've only one cliff-hanger left to endure. Waiting every week was killing me.

What's the release schedule?

If next episode gets delayed by a week, people going to become crazy..
>> ARTICLE
I give up! Anyone know what chapter in the manga is where the anime is currently at? I want to start reading it. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Start reading from chapter 18. And you should also read the first volume (chapter 1 ~ 6) because the anime skipped over a lot from those chapters.
>> ARTICLE
So I should read the first 6 chapters, then skip all the way to 18? Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
Yes. 18 is the second part of this episode, but with better pacing and a litter more content.
>> ARTICLE
So. Good!
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else annoyed that the killer is pretty obvious considering that he has the same voice actor as another character earlier in the show?

THE AIRPLANE IN THE RIVER! DID THAT FAG KILL ANOTHER CHILD TO FRAME SATORU AGAIN?!?! FUUUUUU
>> ARTICLE
I feel like when you binge watch series like this you don't get as much feeling from it as you would watching the new episode every week because the wait is definitely worth and it builds up more emotion 
>> ARTICLE
One good thing I can say about this killer is that he's doing a great job. He can always pin the murder in someone else and get away. If it wasn't for Satoru's Revival, he would never be caught
>> ARTICLE
The discussion of this Anime is always on my front page weekly, is it truly excellent or why is it so popular?
>> ARTICLE
He's still sayings things he's thinking without meaning to - guess it's not because of adult mind being in child's brain after all.

And oh yeah, that ending scene - the hunt begins next episode! If the killer doesn't have a similar ability to MC's, he is so fucked!
>> ARTICLE
I'm still sticking by my theory that it's his homeroom teacher who's behind all of this.

[This entire episode.](http://i.imgur.com/bgAnv9f.png)
>> ARTICLE
wait why is satoru's mom on the previous suspect list? I'm so confused
>> ARTICLE
It's nice to see that Satoru has some allies in the present.

Airi's mom is second best mom, after Satoru's of course.

A man who just happens along, notices two kids struggling to make their toy plane fly and people are suspicious after he helps them. Are people really that paranoid of everyone? Such a shame.

Oooooh shit there he was! Right there watching as Satoru got arrested. I didn't expect to see him there.

Looks like it's revival time again. I assume he'll still be an adult this time around.
>> ARTICLE
Any ideas as to why [the reporter](http://imgur.com/TnAHzJ0) was shown to have red eyes, but brown later on? 
>> ARTICLE
They've been doing that with several characters (the teacher, the blond kid, Hinazuki's mom, at least). I think it's supposed to represent people who are suspicious, but it's not clear.
>> ARTICLE
First off, Airi's mom is amazing as well. Only shitty mom is Kayo's, so we need a third good one to get a triforce thing going on here. Second, the butterfly at the end is a sign of revival, seen in the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's safe to bet that this show will eventually get 24 episodes right? I've not been reading the manga but as far as I know there's no way the anime can cover everything in 12 episodes at this pace.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit. When he looked at the killer and it zoomed in on his eye it sent chills down my entire body. The fact he could be anywhere he wants is insanely creepy.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone have a gif of the grim reaper / kid falling scene? That animation was gorgeous
>> ARTICLE
How is this only 11 hours ago... NOOOOO!
>> ARTICLE
So what if the killer is the kid Satoru raced earlier in the show. He was pretty pissed that he lost the race on purpose so he would have a motive. Just imagine them panning down from the guy's head to his feet and you just see some ice skates on his feet. That would be a pretty sick ending tbh.

It felt really good at the end when I saw the butterfly. Caught myself saying "YES! Time to go back and save kayo!".

oshi- some serious shit is going down next episode

Thank God a butterfly was shown at the end! It was about time he goes back to the pastagain  to change something. But another whole week to wait! :(

How can you guys watch this show week to week? I had a feeling this is a binge-watch type of series, and then put it on hold after eps. 1. I just finished eps. 2 just now and the OP of eps. 3 is currently playing. 

How can you guys watch this series one episode at a time? DAMN.
>> ARTICLE
Do you think that that Airi's mother could have been in on Satoru's arrest? It isn't convenient for me to get screenshots right now, but right before Airi is confronted by that hand while she was reading the newspaper (which we can assume was her mother considering the scene after was with them talking), there was an officer standing outside the door looking at her and speaking into a radio. I believe this was a cue for Airi's mother to enter the room and speak to Airi. It felt almost too convenient how Airi was able to get past the security guards when leaving her room and how a car was posted right outside (well this is actually not surprising). However, the car did not stop her, it followed her. This leads me to assume that this was all a ploy by the police. They call in Airi's mother. She speaks to Airi and convinces her to run away. The police think Airi knows where Satoru is, so set up a team to follow her after she leaves. I'd hate to think that Airi's mother hasn't learned after her ex-husband but damn I'm convinced she hasn't.

red threads of  fate

I don't think Hinazuki's fate can be changed. The way the reporter puts it makes it seem like it had more to do with her parents than external forces.  
Only time will tell. I'm hoping I'm wrong.
>> ARTICLE
We got some interesting plot points today. The most interesting was that one of the kids that was killed was a male that could be mistaken for a female. The reporter believed that the killer did this to purposely throw off the police. The rest of the victims were female meaning that this is a serial killer. It occurred to me that there were several suspicious people in the case and if someone really wanted to throw someone off they could use knowledge as a way of doing it. The teacher for example knew that the male victim was in fact male and not female. If the police were profiling the serial killer as the type of guy that would kill only females and a male victim showed up that appeared female then they would suspect that the killer was mistaken when he kidnapped the male victim. The teacher would obviously know that the victim was male and would thus not fit the profile of the killer and would be eliminated from the list of possible suspects. Red herring or not that guy is suspicious. 
>> ARTICLE
GmuthafuckinG holy shit jesus cannon...This is what GOOD writing is, OMFG i'm going to murder my self because that's how good this shit is. 10/10 for suspense, plot and character personality.

the only gripe i have is that all of the "adults" have a single minded view when it came to satorus' fugitive status, Is that how shit happens in real life? You're automatically guilty and no one bats an eye? Then again that's what's driving the plot forward.
>> ARTICLE
This episode represents which Chapter in the manga?? I really want to  read it by now!
>> ARTICLE
Chapter 18
>> ARTICLE
I really really liked how him and the killer recognized each other at the end. The killer looked so damn smug and Satoru looked pretty, I'm not sure how to put it he looked like everything I felt.

Airi's mother is pretty cool also.

The only thing that disappointed me was Satoru's line to Airi. Since it showed a power ranger like hero I expected him to say something completely cheesy and instead we got what should have been said.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome. Lot of exposition this episode though, which is why I think some people feel like it hasn't been as exciting as previous episodes. I don't disagree - it's obviously more interesting to see Satoru actively trying to fix things and reacting to the results. But exposition has to happen *somewhere*. It'd be silly if Satoru *didn't* seek out someone like the reporter, or anyone with information that could help. I thought the realisation and implication concerning Hiromi's murder was definitely interesting, however. 

That ending, too. What a stunning sequence to portray Satoru locking eyes with the guy he's been chasing all this time. All the while being framed by that very person, no less. Hoping we go back to the past again next episode for more history-changing shenanigans. And Kayo.  

The one thing I don't get is why the cops didn't seem to bat an eye when Airi was screaming about Satoru being innocent. If he was guilty of, you know, setting fire to her house with her inside, why would they be hanging out and why would she defend him?

Is it because they think she might be an accomplice in his mother's murder? If she was an accomplice, why would Satoru attempt to kill her in a fire in the first place? Maybe to clear every trace of his involvement, I guess? I dunno. Why do they even think she's an accomplice?
>> ARTICLE
They still want him in custody just in case.
>> ARTICLE
One thing's bothering me!

He's able to keep his memories during the time travel.
Now, earlier, the Revival was only for a few minutes, so he had to live it again, and remembers what happened before and what happened in the new timeline.

But, in this case, he went back much farther, changed things, and then came back. Now, I am pretty sure no matter how similar the world went in the new timeline, some differences will be there in his new life. 

And these new events/changes he does not remember, because he came back to the present without actually living all those years. So, his new life experiences are something that he didn't had. But, others would rememeber their shared experiences as hey lived through all that.

So basically, WHO WAS PHONE? No, seriously, who lived his new life? 
>> ARTICLE
On 2nd watch, I'm now fairly certain this episode reveals who the killer is.  [](/s "5min mark")

I do feel like the show threw too much info at me this episode and it was hard for me to follow because I wasn't remembering everyone's names and faces, like how I don't remember when the reporter showed up in the past. Reading the comments here helped a little, but there are too many right now. Airi is pretty cool and I really liked the shot at the end, maybe we'll start in 1988 next episode. This wasn't my favorite episode, but I don't think I should call it bad because it confused me, the story was still engaging and I liked the "what would a hero say" line.

I'm really enjoying this series, but it's pretty ridiculous that Satoru is on the run, and that Airi is suspected as an accomplice. The police would have checked the knife for prints etc. Does forensic evidence not exist in this anime? The police wouldn't suspect the son just because he was in the area when they got there, I mean he lives there for crying out loud. So this anime pretty much hinges on an extremely unlikely scenario, which kinda kills it tbh. Ignoring all that though, it's still pretty good.

He actually just rolled his mom over and got blood on his hand. "rewatch it dawg"

Fuuuuuuuuuuuck!! I shouldn't have started this anime before all episodes have come out >.< I hate waiting for the next episodes of animes but this one really grabbed my attention this season. 

Fuck those red eyes, fuck Hinazuki's parents, fuck that fucking killing fuck.......fuck. I got chills during [this scene](https://puu.sh/n4pEh.webm). That was really unexpected.

I'm also on the same train thinking that the teacher is probably gonna be the murderer after all. I recall a scene where that little brat who called out Hinazuki for stealing money was pissed that the little girls were flirting with the teacher. Doesn't have to mean much but still. But then again the possible motives just don't add up. Also [this fucking scene](http://i.imgur.com/ndFAX2Y.png), still don't know what was going on there. Seems like there's more to [this guy](https://embed.gyazo.com/58776457ef313ba0c557eb83c951ebf7.png)

it won't be that rushed. We're on chapter 19/44 right now

Which is too bad, but I have read all of the translated manga and right now I can see stuff that they are very likely to cut or be condensed for time and isn't really necessary for the story. I think chapters 35 through 37 will likely amount to maybe 5 to 10 minutes screen time at most, and those chapters will probably be in episode 9 the way the episodes are going.

Aaaaand we're halfway done now.

Well I was hoping we'd see more of him in the present, but looks like he's going back again. I wonder how often he'll timehop... like will this be another 3 episode burst of the past, or will we flip-flop some more?

I mean this is probably it for the past, since he won't gain much from being in the present now... kinda wanted to see him search the school for clues (if he ever suspects the teacher) or... really search anywhere for any clues, right now the most info he got was a file in that one guy's computer. 

Oh well, this show hasn't disappointed me yet, whatever the past brings I'm sure I'll love it (And hopefully he's brought before X-Day again)

>  or will we flip-flop some more?

You shouldve listened more to Satorous Monologue at the End.
>> ARTICLE
Why does the anime make it so obvious that everyone knows who the murderer is? it's like in the [intro](http://imgur.com/5FiyfSL), and there's only 1 adult male.
>> ARTICLE
Airi's mother helping her escape hospital was hilarious. Why are all the mothers in this show (with the exception of Kayo's ofc) so badass and awesome?
>> ARTICLE
i just realized this, but there are no major characters with non existent parents that "live overseas" or "are at work during all plot events"
>> ARTICLE
I was really glad that her mom listened to her, believed in her, and wanted to help her.  That wasn't the impression I got when we first saw her so I was pleasantly surprised.
>> ARTICLE
The ominous blue butterfly at the end might be a hint at the whole "Butterfly Effect" thing and things are now getting into full swing.

I'm enjoying the show and the thriller/drama aspects of it. The question now is what did the reporter know and/or do after realising that Airi's mother swapped places with her in the hospital room. 

The cliffhangers are at points annoying, and at points exciting. I know for a fact that my interest in the show would probably have waned a little if it weren't for the cliffhangers acting as hooks for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Satoru's already shaping up to be one of my favorite main characters. He doesn't know everything, has his insecurities, fears, and failures, but he comes across competent. He was determined to save Kayo and find out who's behind this, but he isn't able to accomplish everything by himself. There's just a very realistic and down to earth aspect to his character I can't really describe that makes itself apparent especially in his candid interactions with Kayo and now Airi.

And that last scene... just how incredible Airi has been to him since his mother's murder, taking him in, trying to protect him from the cops, and ultimately risking her life. Seeing her break down in tears thinking she had failed Satoru, yet he somehow found the composure in himself to express his gratitude. Just amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I guarantee this mysterious guy in black is the [SAO 2 Minor Spoilers](/s "Red Eye Zaza. He's just killing people like he always does. He's clever, he's always watching you, and so forth.") 

I hate the manager guy. Screw you for getting credit for saving best girl. I hope Satoru gets to kick his ass at some point.
>> ARTICLE
Fuck man just leave hinazuki alone
>> ARTICLE
After the last revival where it seemed like Kayo was killed by her mom/mom's boyfriend, I wasn't expecting the killer to be so focusing in on Kayo.

Seriously don't understand what makes Kayo so appealing to the murdered.
>> ARTICLE
Easy target, I guess once the killer sets their sights on a victim, they must go through with it.
>> ARTICLE
or....maybe its a sick sort of "salvation". As in they see how she gets treated and ostricized by most people and abused by her parents . So they want to "free" her from her bad life. Especially since her class essay basically said she wouldn't be missed if she disappeared.

Eh this is my guess on a possible motive.
>> ARTICLE
The killer is so perfect, they are just always there, always watching. 
>> ARTICLE
Why is this murderer so hung up on her, ugh. 
>> ARTICLE
If the show doesn't explain why the murderer is so damn focused on Hinazuki and won't bloody kill anyone else until she dies first than I'll be severely disappointed given how pretty good the writing is right now.
>> ARTICLE
It really doesn't *have* to be anything. Serial murderers are extremely peculiar with their craft. It could just be that he saw Hinazuki and became obsessed with having her be his next that he just *couldn't* move on until he killed her.

It also could just not even be the killer himself who is particularly obsessed with killing Kayo but just that the hands of time and fate always catch up. She could just be destined to die at this guy's hands.
>> ARTICLE
She's an isolated child, makes sense sadly. If anything they isolated her even more in this case.


>> ARTICLE
It's hard imagine how Satoru is going to react next episode as he'll most likely blame himself.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like it's too soon still, just one episode back in the past? Satoru's mom noticed something was going on and it's about time she starts playing a role as well as Yuuki making an appearance this episode.
>> ARTICLE
yeah i agree, it's def the mom going in there ^^^^hopefully
>> ARTICLE
Or maybe it could be the teacher in a non-murdering way?
>> ARTICLE
I think the teacher is the killer
>> ARTICLE
They had an odd focus on his eyes this episode and that transition with the glowing streetlamps...I'm definitely beginning to suspect him too.
>> ARTICLE
On the bright side Yuuki should be in the clear. Or at least I want to think that before the show punches me in the gut again.
>> ARTICLE
He would only be in the clear for that day though surly, and they stopped her from dying on that day so really it did nothing.

Or am i missing something?
>> ARTICLE
She didn't die on that day but as far as they know she went missing. If she went missing on the day Yuuki had an alibi then he couldn't have caused it. ^^^^I ^^^^Hope 
>> ARTICLE
Ah that makes sense ^^ 
>> ARTICLE
I kind of worry the killer might be getting more hung up about going after her when the killer realizes Satoru is actively working to stop it. Kind of an ironic situation where Satoru himself might be making the case harder to crack.
>> ARTICLE
Well she would die if he didn't help, so he can't help that issue even if true.
>> ARTICLE
This closely resembles his manga story about the grim reaper making things worse every time...

Holy fuck those red eyes from Satoru, that desperation to do ANYTHING possible to prevent Hinazaki's death is scary.

>> ARTICLE
I think the _red eyes_ most likely symbolize blood-lust or rage. I don't blame Satoru for having those feeling towards Kayo's mom.
>> ARTICLE
Was it just me or did it look like the teacher had red eyes at one point too when he was on the phone near the end?
>> ARTICLE
I saw it too. Im calling it now, no changies-backsies, its the teacher who is the killer. Why? I dunno. Is there any basis besides his red eyes at the end of the episode? Not that I know of. Does this rule out my thesis? Fuck no.
>> ARTICLE
They've used red eyes symbolically before, so I think it's the same case here.

I don't believe the killer actually has red eyes.
>> ARTICLE
At this point it's fair to say that the _red eyes_ are just a visual indication of emotion. They've shown the killer, Kenya, and Satoru having _red eyes_ at points.
>> ARTICLE
They showed the reporter with red eyes when he answered Satoru's call. ^^if ^^I ^^recall ^^correctly
>> ARTICLE
I think if nothing else, that was one of the main outcomes from this episode. It dispels one of the few leads that we have. 
>> ARTICLE
I know the eyes are definitely symbolic of some emotion, but I remember Kenya had them early on, however he didn't really have a reason 
>> ARTICLE
I think Kenya has a crush on Hinazaki and when he saw Satoru hit on her all the sudden he got angry enough for the red eyes. 
>> ARTICLE
I think Kenya's explanation of envy or whatever he had on Satoru for having the conviction to act on behalf of Hinazuki's well being caused the red eyes for him. I interpreted his confession/revelation to Satoru in the hallway as a direct result of resolving his red-eyes situation.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing I can think of when seeing those red eyes is when someone is going-

[**Out of Control**](#bearwithme)

and becoming desperate (like Satoru with letting air out out of the tires and almost shoving Kayo's mother down those steps)
>> ARTICLE
Satoru's face was [full of rage](https://49.media.tumblr.com/8bacb5507b602c826eb34de0adb7b093/tumblr_o2r76u4Sop1qimk8ao2_r1_540.gif) and it was definitely a different side of him (hard to blame him).

It is hard to read Kenya in general. On one hand, he does seem genuinely helpful. At others, he seems to be a bit of a schemer. 

Makes me wonder if the red eyes is an indicator to an actual tendency in the characters, it's  just visual flair or even both.

[Psycho-Pass ep.11 spoiler](https://youtu.be/8nw_inmrX7M?t=24s)

Edit : typo
>> ARTICLE
Psycho Pass was so fucking good. I need to rewatch it soon.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the interactions between satoru and kenya, such a great friendship.
>> ARTICLE
I still can't get myself to trust Kenya. He seems to be way too smart and attentive for his age. Add in the fact that he wasn't phased by Satoru's actions this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Don't remember if they said it yet or not, but

[Very light spoiler about Kenya's background](/s "His family is incredibly wealthy, and his family is part of a long line of famous lawyers iirc. He wants to become one when he gets older and he's been taught a lot of stuff as a result. It's part of the reason he is so much more attentive and intelligent than normal.")

>> ARTICLE
The fact that he kinda helped satoru earlier on in an episode makes me trust him though. How he hinted at satoru to read the one poem book thing all the kids wrote. 
>> ARTICLE
After Kenya's suspicious meeting with the teacher earlier on, I've had a hard time trusting him.

I still can't believe that a kid his age would aid in "kidnapping" and be on the same level as Satoru intelligence wise.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah.. I admit, I have no idea what the teacher meetings are about. Hoping to find out soon. Not knowing is killin me 
>> ARTICLE
that suspicious meeting with the teacher was to seperate satoru and kayo from the rest of the friends group, so that they could prepare the surprise party. in episode 4 at 16:45 their teacher is asking satoru and kayo to help him carry boxes. and at 18:05 kenya admits that he asked the teacher exactly for that.

not saying that kenya isnt suspicious at all but just telling you the reason for kenya meeting the teacher. as you would be waiting for it and it would probably not resolve how you would like it to (as you seemed to have missed what i pointed out above). it was hard to catch and very subtle but i guess its intentional to make kenya seem more suspicious, like how they keep making yuuki seem very suspicious (the cutter box knife).
>> ARTICLE
Well my question is --- Is Kenya also a revival person?
>> ARTICLE
My crazy theory is that Kenya is the shinigami like in Satoru's manga idea that accidentally set this all in motion, and is using Satoru as his tool to fix his mistake.
>> ARTICLE
This has been my suspicion too since day 1 almost. He's just too cool and collected and smart for a grade schooler. If he is though, it opens up a whole new mess of questions that we have no answers to.
>> ARTICLE
been thinking the same, but kid with higher iq (and i think kenya is AB) often seen more mature than kids their age. i think this is what described kenya behavior. but still i think kenya possibly not having any relation to the killer, even if he is a revival person.

This guy is probably innocent, [but can he look any more sketchy as fuck](http://i.imgur.com/iDOYyyZ.png)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, what was up with his panicked look? I didn't understand why he reacted that way.
>> ARTICLE
Probably because he noticed the abuse she had and asking about it made him uncomfortable. Hopefully he's not involved.
>> ARTICLE
He has to be aware of how it looks as a grown man knowing about or being seen with a little girl. We all saw the moms' reactions in last week's episode with Satoru and the boys in the park. 
>> ARTICLE
Yep I think he was worried because he knew how it looked but was glad in the end. 
>> ARTICLE
In episode one Satoru's mom discovered the identity of the real killer and basically stated that Satoru was right and Yuuki was innocent. Although that doesn't rule out the possibility of him being an accomplice I find it extremely unlikely. There is also the matter of him just having a nervous personality which is one reason why his best friend is an elementary schooler.
>> ARTICLE
and thats why he was the perfect scapegoat.
>> ARTICLE
He did seem more suspicious this time around. Hard to cross out anyone as a suspect at this point although I'd be really surprised if Yuuki was involved. 
>> ARTICLE
Hard to kill people while you are in prison
>> ARTICLE
I think that he *knows* what kind of abuse she's going through, and I suspect he might have been an abuse victim himself as a child. He does have some of the characteristics. He's shy, very submissive, and enjoys spending time and playing with the neighborhood kids.

I'm willing to bet he got nervous because he's seen Kayo's marks and knows she's getting roughed up at home, but is too scared to say anything about it, and thinking about it when talking to Satoru made him upset.
>> ARTICLE
There's also mention that he suspects his father of the murders.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoy the characters this story has. The subtle smiles on the kids faces, especially Hinazuki just shows so many emotions. It just makes you remember that they're kids even with their intelligence, but at the same time... Please don't kill her again. I can't handle that.
>> ARTICLE
For sure. That moment after Satoru came back where they're just sitting together eating noodles. I never knew something so simple could get me so emotional. What is this show doing to me?
>> ARTICLE
Here's a brief video that I think may explain why noodles in the middle of night is so touching:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-SrtkVmaj8
>> ARTICLE
So basically I was moved because I know how hard it is to go through whole night without warm noodles.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. I like how the kid characters are fully realized. I make jabs at this show like it is a more serious Detective Conan, but this show also shows the surprising humanity and depth of child characters as observed by adults in child bodies very well too. I like how they use the cutesy, peculiar character movements of child characters very well in this show. The way kids are more active in movement to having a really low to the ground eye view (like how the adults look giant in their eyes), a lot of small details really sells it.

Why would she have a backpack on her then? For me, I think more it's the paper plane guy. Body looks similar and he acted suspicious when Satoru asked him about her.

Woah. What if that IS Kayo and that's what she'll look like in the future. What if the poster is showing after she survives and she's back on the bus a decade later, maybe reminiscing in the memory of Satoru after some grim accident happens to him while he saves her.

This one hurts though. Really hoping it's Sachiko, or even *maybe* Yuuki, but anyone else, nahhh

Actually it could even be her parents this time, but Satoru would have to come up with a whole new plan if her parents found her again. She probably wouldn't get killed that same night if it was her parents, at least.

When I read the manga way over a year ago I was like "This would be the perfect page to end an episode if they made an anime." And they did it. I cannot applaude the staff enough for this and all the other cliffhangers.
>> ARTICLE
They really are perfect for ending at the moment were you absolutely need to know more, but damn it's such a good show, just ending every week is painful enough.
>> ARTICLE
Thing is, the manga has these cliffhangers all over, just from this episode, Kenya asking Satoru who he was (which was more elaborate in the manga, showing what a genius Kenya actually is) was another one. As were Kayo asking Satoru to kill someone, him realizing he was back in 2006 and Airi escaping from the hospital in previous episodes.
>> ARTICLE
It's satoru's mom right? RIGHT!

That actually seems plausible. She's pretty perceptive so may have worked out roughly what was going on, then just followed the footprints and very clear sled tracks to see if Hinazuki was alright

THANK YOU. Everyone seems to be ignoring this, but Kenya and girlyboy are going along with the plan so easily without any justification from Satoru.

Kenya is not dumb, he wouldn't just go with a plan without understanding why.

Kenya is quite aware that Kayo is being beaten. He is simply concerned that one of these beatings could be eventually become fatal (or is at least pretending to be concerned).

It is wild how much Hinazuki's personality has changed just by being in good company. Not sure if Hinazuki ends up with Satoru or not in the future if she survives but I  really wish this pairing could be a thing.
>> ARTICLE
With how hard Satoru's work is getting countered, I'm beginning to think that if Hinazuki *doesn't* die, she'll become the next Hitler or some shit when she grows up.
>> ARTICLE
[Last week's episode revolved around trust](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/02/11/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-6-trust-revolution/), and this episode, well, it revolves around being a superhero, or in other words, being a child.

But before we get to that, a few words on how the episode looked and sounded. Episodes 5-6 were outsourced, so it's not as surprising that they didn't look as good as the other episodes, and in general, the present segments feel a bit more flat, with less "cinematic framing" that has so many shots just so beautifully looking. Thankfully, [we once more had a multitude of such shots this episode](http://imgur.com/a/Cc63Y).

On the sound front, I really liked the use of *silence* this episode, immediately after Satoru went back in time. I was very curious to see when and where he'd end-up, and the show kept the tension by *not* using any sound, until he saw Kayo next to him, and the sound returned, as time resumed its flow, and Satoru was able to breathe again.

Finally, before we return to the thematic discussion, [look at this moment from episode 3](http://i.imgur.com/WLyPSVA.jpg), and [here is how it re-appeared this episode](http://i.imgur.com/TWk1gmx.jpg). Satoru is much more determined and hopeful, so the music this time was uplifting rather than tense. Also, when we saw [this wonderfully cute moment](http://i.imgur.com/hHVllQK.jpg), I knew things won't end well this episode. Because episode 4, and because this show doesn't believe in ending an episode on a cheerful and comfortable note (it could be Yuuki/Jun who entered the bus, but is it?).

Now, to get back to the thematic discussion, [this moment where we're told Kenya asked Satoru whether he thought of Kayo's "solution"](http://i.imgur.com/5aWLlaM.jpg) is emblematic of Satoru's problem. Satoru is supposedly an adult, but what he wants to be is a hero. He finally admits it. He doesn't care how foolish he looks, but he'll go for justice. He'll save people. No matter the cost, even to himself. He was about to potentially kill Kayo's mother over it as well, right?

And Kenya was needed to talk sense into him. I actually mentioned this in [my episode 3 mini-write-up](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-3-notes/), but Satoru isn't a 29 year old man in an 11 year old boy's body, but an 11 year old boy, who was trapped in a 29 year old man's body, who's now back in his original body. Kenya is far more of an adult than Satoru is. Kenya doesn't act not because he's a coward, but because he recognizes that there are repercussions, and limitations to his abilities. Satoru doesn't think things through, when he sees something he needs to do, or wants to do, he just does it, like a superhero, like a *child*. Kayo was supposed to die on March 1st, but then died on March 3rd, after his intervention. And even if Kayo somehow survives, how will that end up saving his mother? He's only postponing things, rather than resolving them. He's buying time, but after he's done so, he's no longer actually looking to solve the case.

Furthermore, Satoru had a realization on how hard it is to handle this whole mess during the gym excursion - he needs to change enough things for Kayo to not die, but not so much that he couldn't predict the future enough so he could save her. But now, he can't predict the future at all. And he's not going after fixing things, he's content with the idyllic homestead he made with his friends, he's content with having saved them, with seeing himself as a hero, [and with being seen as one by others](http://i.imgur.com/bhEm6Oo.jpg).

If he were an adult, truly, he should've realized Kayo's "solution" made no sense at all, it'd *still* be their fault if it were her idea, and it'd certainly be *her* fault, abuse or not, over disappearing like that. But Satoru *is* a hero, a golden era hero who's busy with saving people, and not actually thinking things through. Guess this is what happens when the mid-90s roll over and you're already burnt out on comics, which began tackling the issue of repercussions around that time.

"I don't care if it's messy and ugly, but I'll give it my all, so I won't have regrets!" But such self-platitudes don't work, which is why people turn to heroes. And it's just make-believe, a *child*'s make-believe. On that front, I also liked the very subtle callback to last episode - Kenya said Satoru kept a mask because he didn't care for the people around him, which he's told Kayo before, it's easier to deal with them that way. So last episode when he thought of the thing Airi wants to hear the most, this form of "kindness", was it him putting on a mask? In a way. Just like he put on a mask this time, and the only problem is, he's bought into it. And the hero's mask may not be all that different from the one he wore as "The Grim Reaper".

***

Some tiny things I want to address but got no room in the main piece:

1) Satoru still doesn't fully trust everyone else. He's not telling Kenya the full truth. He told Kayo he won't lie to her, and he indeed doesn't, but the information he's withholding back from her is quite the doozy. Likewise with his other friend, purportedly brought over to keep Kayo company, but actually because he's another potential murder victim.

2) Kenya said how Satoru saw himself in Kayo, in how they both presented a mask to everyone around them. But Kenya also sees himself in Kayo, in how they both have "unhappy homes", which he subtly hinted at. He did also say earlier in the episode that he expected Satoru to hate Kayo for being similar to him, which makes you wonder if he also hated Kayo, somewhat. And that may be part of why he was angry with himself over not helping her, because he thought it came from his "hate", which he knows is not rational.

3) Just a funny aside, [but I too feel the same whenever I'm about to eat cafeteria food](http://i.imgur.com/P9aKmj3.jpg).

4) "No need to thank me, we're friends," which is exactly why you *should* thank your friends, exactly because there's no *need*. You thank them for that willingness to help. Just so. Even Kenya, who understands Satoru's a hero for his motivations, still has what to learn. He's still a kid too, even with his amazing perception.

Kayo is flattened and Satoru is revived all the way back to 1800's England at in the Slums, eventually he meets a young man with power and conviction surely he can help this man in order to stop DIO. When asked for his name Satoru blanks and quickly chooses the name of a rock and roll group Speedwagon.
>> ARTICLE
that ended way too fast

Instead of staying in an abandoned rundown school bus, it might have been safer to explain to Satoru's mom that Kayo needed to stay there at Satoru's home with them
>> ARTICLE
/u/refugee_savior nailed it. Sure, it seems the most sensible immediately but it implicates so many more people. Not to mention his mother would be treated way more harshly in the eyes of the law than Satoru and Co. would if they got caught.
>> ARTICLE
That could lead to complications though. If Kayo's mom called the police about her missing (as was Satoru's plan) and they found out she was at Satoru's then his mom could be brought up on kidnapping charges. Then Satoru has no mom and Kayo still gets murdered.

I want to be hopeful. I want Satoru to succeed, but it's clear that he's [getting desperate](http://i.imgur.com/uRSJYOi.jpg) and is willing to do some [seriously bad stuff](http://i.imgur.com/63KwZdo.jpg) to help Kayo. It's also clear that the murderer won't be so easily stopped. That man haunted Satoru and was able to avoid police for decades. It's not gonna end just like that.

* [Satoru's reaction](http://i.imgur.com/gIDJXki.jpg) to seeing his mom [alive](http://i.imgur.com/vVM63nL.jpg) again is great. It doesn't matter how many times this will happen, he will always be glad, because that is his mother. Alive and well.

I honestly feel Satoru should know the killer by now. 

There have been tons of clues that he should've been able to piece together that we couldn't. 

I'm actually hoping they don't save it for the finale. I don't want Hinazuki dying anymore.... ;-;

My last possible guess is the fucking teacher. I don't what who the fuck else it could be. I would be insistent on the guy that makes planes after this episode if I didn't already know he was innocent.

It could also be Satoru's mom. It would be funny: Everyone in this thread is praying it's her entering the bus. It would be a perfect switch moment. "Oh thanks god, it's her!....... Oh god, it's her?!"

...Of course it's the teacher.

Holy shit, did anyone catch that line about whether you needed to change trains to Ueno? Satoru said "No" in the first episode but mentioned that it can be done in this episode when he sees his mom again to try and prevent her death in the future.

>> ARTICLE
I couldn't wait. I bought all 7 volumes of the manga that were out. **BUT** I promised myself that I wouldn't read ahead, so now I've got 4 volumes still wrapped in plastic just sitting there on my table. So tempting...But I'll say that it's definitely worth the read so far, though. I feel like the story is a lot more fluid and rationally more understandable.

The thing I love about time-travel anime, especially things that are part of murder mysteries, is that we get to see murdered characters back alive again. When a series can get you to care about its characters as much as the characters do themselves, it makes you so happy that you see them moving again.

Anyway, how old is Kenya, man. Satoru is 29 years old, and Kenya sounds like he's just as old as him. It's making me nervous. In fact, everything about this anime makes me nervous. I can't trust anyone, goddamn it! Everyone seems sketchy as fuck.

And that creep better get his hands off of Kayo. I don't think I can live through even more deaths...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I  don't  know what is up with Kenya, but I  can not trust him fully knowing just how devious and smart he can be. Kind of makes me think he'll go all Light Yagami if he had Satoru's powers.
>> ARTICLE
So wait, if she gets murdered tonight, then that means the effort he went through to give Yuuki an alibi is gone, because he won't be with the cops that night too. FUCK.
>> ARTICLE
It's tough to say, though.  Because he wrote "I'm gonna kill you" on the rock, the police might have assigned an officer to that house/neighbourhood to keep an eye on things for a while.  That's what I'm hoping, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
We can only hope.  Hope and wait 7 more days.
>> ARTICLE
There's still one interaction between Kenya and the teacher left unexplained.  At this stage, I am really really suspicious of Kenya. 

Here are the factors, 

-Kenya knows that yuuki has an alibi on March 2nd

-kenya knows that they're living in the bus(of course) 

-he is really capable/smart enough to work his way up to become a councilman/policeman related etc which is the murderer's current occupation. 

-he knows everything of hinazuki family situation, so it's very easy to manipulate the situation. 

-he knows that the friend who looks like a girl is a guy, which is a key factor mentioned in previous episode. 

-satoru's mom knows The murderer. SO that means there's at least a form of interaction between them or she must have seen him before. Thus Kenya applies for both. 

-the murderer is around the same age as satoru. 

I don't know if anyone will read this, but this is my theory. Kenya may have the intention of 'saving' the kids from their situation by killing them. Who knows. 

But after all a theory is a theory, and I may be absolutely wrong about this. But if it's not him, then it's probably the teacher or someone that the show hasn't really properly introduce yet.(etc he's acting in the shadow) 


>> ARTICLE
Except the last point. Murderer is not the same age as satarou. The reason is according to today's episode in time line when kayo was murdered, she ~~was carried~~ disappeared from the shed. So the killer at 1988 had to be an adult who can carry a beaten kid.
>> ARTICLE
What makes you think the killer is the same age as Satoru? I'm more inclined to think Kenya might be *working with* the killer. 

Wasn't the killer confirmed to be the one guy who was old enough to warrant a cane and a political position. I'm pretty sure 29 doesn't cut it. 
>> ARTICLE
Leave Hinazuki alone you bastards.

Does anyone who knows Japanese know that word the kids always use to say "bye" to each other? Sounds like "shittakei" to my ears. Just curious.
>> ARTICLE
It's "shitakke" (), which is a casual "bye" in [Hokkaido dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido_dialects). It's a spin on "soushitara" (), which means "then". I found a page in Japanese about it [here](http://pucchi.net/hokkaido/language/shitakke.php).

Edit: After looking at the Wikipedia article, I'm going to start looking out for "waya" instead of "dame". I'm pretty certain I've heard them using "dame" so far.

Twice now, this show has made me forget that it's a murder mystery/thriller/whatever-I'm-bad-with-genres and made me happy to see all of the interactions, and then they just break my heart at the end.

Seems a bit convenient that the killer happened to know that she was in that bus, not to mention that she happened to be alone.

I'll repeat what I said in the show specific sub:

This show is going to trigger a heart attack!

Very rarely do I lose myself in a show like I do with this one.

Every week is such a cliffhanger I love and hate it, this week was great. We got to see the lengths Satoru is willing to go to in order to protect her.

I am not sure how I feel about Kenya, I think he knows more than we are hearing about but I am not sure...I just don't think I trust him. It's one of those gut feelings...I just hope I'm wrong.
I have not read the manga yet...I am holding off on purpose because I know I will marathon through it and I am really enjoying (sometimes) the week to week thrills!

What was the significance of the two cards Kayo threw down? An ace of spades and an ace of hearts. Everything in this show is so damn symbolic, what could they symbolize?  
>> ARTICLE
I don't know if the cards themselves were meant to mean anything on the level of suit, but this comment got me thinking anyway.

The thing is, Satoru (and now Kenya) have been going to some pretty great lengths to save her, without much input from her at all.  But while they were there in the hideout just playing a game, she surprised them by throwing down (what tend to be) the winning cards while taking some personal agency over her current situation as well. 

To me, it felt like a reminder from Kayo to the boys, and the writers to us, that she is a thinking and acting person as well, and we shouldn't underestimate her.
>> ARTICLE
Judging by how Kayo won with a pair of aces, they were probably playing old maid. And in the rules of japanese old maid, whoever ends the game with the joker in their hand loses. 

As Kayo goes to take a card from Satoru, it's shown that he has the joker, but Kayo ends up taking his ace of diamonds instead, thus making Satoru the loser and her having the winning pair. 

Perhaps it could be foreshadowing for the outcome of the "game" he's playing with the murderer & his attempts in trying to save Kayo? Just a hypothesis, I haven't read the manga.

Me: Fuck you too Erased
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else think his consistent meddling in the case is going to incriminate him eventually as a prime suspect? What if he becomes the scapegoat instead of Yuuki?
>> ARTICLE
Why did Yuuki react like this ? 
>> ARTICLE
Yuuki noticed Hinazuki hadn't been around for some time, he's shown in the past he's perceptive enough to have known about her abuse. I think there are a few reasons he might react the way he did.

He might be worried that if Satoru noticed him hanging around Hinazuki, others must have noticed as well. This makes him look suspicious and he knows it. He probably knows about Hinazuki's abuse and wants to help in whatever way he can, but he's clearly too nervous to involve himself directly. He might be freaking out because he's afraid he's gotten too involved.

Another scenario is that he noticed Hinazuki hadn't been around and he feared the worst. Being confronted by Satoru about the subject out of nowhere didn't give him much time to react. He might be struggling to find a way to talk to Satoru about Hinazuki, or at the very least be uncomfortable talking to a child about another child being abused. Especially since Yuuki shows signs of past abuse himself.

One more scenario (the most likely one in my opinion) is that Yuuki has already been contacted by the murderer. Satoru himself says the murderer likely saw Yuuki with Hinazuki and has begun using him as a patsy. Maybe he's come to Yuuki with plans of saving Hinazuki and wanted his help, maybe he just started intimidating Yuuki after Yuuki noticed the murderer stalking the children. At any rate, Yuuki's response is meant to make him look guilty. The blade he's holding glints, he's initially standing over Satoru with the blade, the lighting makes him look menacing, etc. Ignoring all of that, if you watch the scene again it almost looks like Yuuki is afraid he's being watched. If he's aware of the murderer, his movements, and his interests, he might be concerned for Satoru's safety. He would be conflicted about warning Satoru, maybe because he doubts himself as being too suspicious, or maybe because he's being intimidated.

I could see any of these reasons playing into Yuuki's reaction, but its likely a combination of them.
>> ARTICLE
There are some nice possible explanations in this thread, but I've got a different and simpler one. Yuuki has anxiety disorder, he appears strange to others which makes it worse and it was the reason he was easy target to blame for murders. Million stupid thoughts go through his mind when he hears about Hinazuki, for whatever reason, it's not logical, that's why it's called a disorder.
>> ARTICLE
I think he knew that Hinazuki was left out all the time so he was happy she's in the group now. The build up was possibly him preparing for bad news.

Any theories about the significance of the book Kenya claims to have lent Satoru? He called it "Poe's 'The Switched Man'". As far as I can tell that book doesn't exist, as he later says, but I wonder if it's a reference to something.
>> ARTICLE
Best guess it was referring to Poe's ["William Wilson"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilson_(short_story) which is a story about a doppelgnger. Whether Kenya just meant that in reference to Satoru, since in the next scene he asks "who are you? It's like you've become another person," or whether it has some deeper meaning (possibly referring to himself as well?), I don't know.  
>> ARTICLE
Okay so I could be way off here but to me this is the biggest hint so far that Kenya could be reviving much like Satoru. People have been thinking this for a while since he seems way too mature and intelligent for his age, sometimes even more so than Satoru but I don't think this alone is enough to go by.

I am thinking that Kenya is reviving, and he suspects that Satoru is doing the same so he makes up the book. The reason he does this is that either one of two things happens from his perspective:

1. Satoru isn't reviving, in which case he would know that Kenya didn't lend him a book and he would call him out on it. 

1. Satoru is reviving, meaning that he would have definitely forgotten something so trivial in the years he lived in the original timeline.


When the first scenario plays out, Kenya realises that Satoru knows what happens and takes a much more active role in trying to help him (knowing that he has a chance of changing things).

The only thing that I think makes this scenario kind of weird is that the jumps back happen at significant times for Satoru, would they just feel random to Kenya? Might be a weird one to explain.

On an unrelated note I get the impression that Satoru repeating that comment about the trains to his mother that she told him back in episode 1 will be relevant somehow. Can't really make much of it yet though.

More cliffhangers NotLikeThis

Still, I can't help but wonder how this kidnapper continues to find Kayo despite Satoru changing the events that led up to her original kidnapping. I feel as though that would confirm that the kidnapper is someone who's watching Satoru and Kayo from afar. There's no way the kidnapper just magically knows things every time.

Finally decided to watched this today and couldn't stop! I'm so surprise how good this show is. The synopsis I had read did not do it justice.

My immediate hunch was that the killer was the teacher. Especially when I saw the scene with the councilman in the pizza shop and there were talking about it becoming a party on the school food program. They look too similar. But then with the scene with Kenya speaking with the teach at night, I though he was in on it too. Which would be a rather weird collaboration with no links beyond a student/teach relationship that I've seen yet.

Now I'm starting to think that it's just Kenya with the theory that he can also revive (of course better that Satoru). The red-eyed guy doesn't really look like the teacher and I could see him being a grownup Kenya. Haven't fully decided the reasoning, though probably jealousy related.
>> ARTICLE
It would be so cool if there would be cross over with Detective Conan. detective conan would instantly solve this case. Conan put a tracker on hinazuki's mom and use his deductive reasoning to solve who is murderer. 
>> ARTICLE
OH COME THE FUCK ON WHY.

WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO GET HURT.

FUCK THIS SHOW IS TOO GOOD AT CLIFFHANGERS
>> ARTICLE
No more... I can't take anymore sad endings...

They should give us the happiest ending possible at the end.

How did the dude find her anyways. Seemed like the MC did a pretty good job covering his tracks. 
>> ARTICLE
Satoru's older friend Jun I think his name was, his facial expression this episode really made it seem like something more was going on when Satoru told him that Hinazuki was apart of their group now.
>> ARTICLE
For some reason i think the homeroom teacher of them is the killer. Just my assumption.

Please just let Kayo be happy :( 
>> ARTICLE
OK I decided to marathon the series to see what everyone was talking about and I agree its good so far. Also it may just be my but the first few episodes kind of reminded me of a series called 20th Century Boys [since] (/s "both stories involve the MC trying to solve a murder mystery while having at least two distinctive time periods") but now I'm getting Stiens;Gate flashbacks [with that] (/s "groundhogs day like scenario involving Okabe and Mayuri around the half way point")
>> ARTICLE
I'm doubling down on my ep~3 prediction that the teacher is the serial killer. Satoru rules him out way too early.

>> ARTICLE
So the killer has red eyes and when satoru was about to push hinazuki mom down he also had red eyes in that instant. What is the deal with those freaky red eyes?
>> ARTICLE

As a manga reader, the more I watched the episode the more I KNEW the episode would end there.

Every damn time with these cliffhangers man...
>> ARTICLE
watching this show without the last 5 seconds of each episode would save me so much fucking stress
>> ARTICLE
These cliffhangers,why you do dis? :O
>> ARTICLE
So where did Hinazuki go if they had to leave the bus and she didn't go to school? And why did she not go to school?
>> ARTICLE
She stays in the bus until safe. School is also not safe because the police can be called.
>> ARTICLE
But the whole thing doesn't make sense to me anyways... Why is she being abducted? Yes sure, WE know that she'll die. But Kenya and his friends have no clue. Why are they going along with it?

I don't recall Satoru revealing his secret to Kenya, and only in that case would it make sense to me.
>> ARTICLE
saving her from a abusive household is what kenya thinks. its really easy to see him rationalize that they are protecting her from her mother. if she gets found she will be returned to her house and punished for running away. 

also with little to no evidence (only hearsay) to corroborate abuse the police would have little recourse to legally protect her.
>> ARTICLE
Because the plan is for Kayo's mom to report her missing and getting the police involved. Her showing up at school just makes her a runaway, and would make it so that she is easily returned to her parents. She needed to completely disappear.
>> ARTICLE
Every time there is a cliffhanger I die a little inside...

Ok maybe not a little, A LOT ;-;
>> ARTICLE
Why does it seem like Kenya and the teacher, despite being generally friendly, are super suspicious? 
>> ARTICLE
Because excellent direction.
>> ARTICLE
If I hadn't read the manga, all these cliffhangers would have already killed me. 
>> ARTICLE
*Final minute*

Nonononononnononononono

*ED starts*

OH GO FUCK YOURSELF.

And now I have to wait a week. I really want to read the manga, but I'll just stick to tormenting myself.

>> ARTICLE
Seriously good episode! I really want to see the next episode please! It just is cliff hanger after cliff hanger and it's so well done!
>> ARTICLE
I am 95% sure that it is the teacher who is the murderer now with Kenya being his confidant. The teacher looks way too similar to the man underneath the umbrella, and if i remember correctly him and Kenya were pretty close.
>> ARTICLE
I also have this feeling that Kenya chooses the targets and the teacher kills them. Maybe he gets kids who he feels he is "saving" but we don't know too much about their backgrounds other then Kayo at this stage. 
>> ARTICLE
> Maybe he gets kids who he feels he is "saving"

Omg Yes. This would make perfect sense as thts his version of being a superhero.~~Also now i gotta look up the book he mentioned to Satoru. Mayb that will have some hints~~ Book is fake apparently

>> ARTICLE
Anybody else think Kenya might know that Satoru is a time traveler? I feel like he asked about that book due to him having suspected Satoru doing a revival.  
>> ARTICLE
[This is the ~~smile~~ handholding I want to protect.](http://i.imgur.com/bHgYi8D.jpg) 

Nevermind, [this smile is also worth protecting for.](http://i.imgur.com/QNAz0gB.jpg) 

It feels so good to be back in 1988.

>> ARTICLE
[Theory incoming](/s "I feel like this could end with Satoru being unable to save Kayo and having to let her die in order to catch the villain. I just hope that's not the case.")
>> ARTICLE
He's not about catching the bad guy he's about saving Kayo and mom.
>> ARTICLE
(Do we have to spoiler tag theories? o_o;)

I'm pretty sure you're right. But MC-kun won't be happy about it.

I spoiler tag theories because people like to read the source material then spoil the show through their "theory" so I spoiler tag mine just so people who don't want to read it don't have to.

> This is my last revival.

Eh? Is this meant to be a statement of fact, or intent? Either way it's a pretty convenient way to ratchet up the tension.

\> that ending

\> erased is basically steins;gate 2.0

I'm sure I'll get crucified for saying this, but I thought that was a pretty poor episode. Erased is still 'good', largely thanks to all it's leftover momentum from the opening act, but nothing important (or especially interesting) has happened since then.  
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like intent to me, since the power doesn't seem to be something well controlled.  

Satoru is filled with DETERMINATION.
>> ARTICLE
Easily the best episode so far.
>> ARTICLE
This guy can't catch a break; hopefully that's Satoru's mom getting on the bus this time.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe that bus is the killers base/hideout.
>> ARTICLE
It's entirely baseless and just a feeling, but I think Kenya is up to some shit.

WHY DID IT END THERE

As the last scene was unfolding, I was litterary screaming at my monitor. DONT YOU FUCKINGS DARE. FUCK OFF; DONT, DONT.. OH YOU FUCKING DID IT

>> ARTICLE
Nononononono that ending damnnnnnn. I won't sleep till the next episode. Please oh god let it be satorus mother!
>> ARTICLE
How does his powers work anyway? It really deflated the cliffhanger from last episode by how easily it was resolved just using "Revival". I thought that he'd do something reckless in order to trigger it, but I guess he can do it out of pure willpower? Also it's the last one he can do for some reason? 

Overall it was a good episode, the plot is really not allowing for much breathing room though. Feels like each episode just tries to get to an appropriate point to end it on a cliffhanger. 

At the very least I'm interested to see what'll happen next, not quite sure what to think of Kenya. He's a bit too "mature" and aware of everything for me to completely buy his motivations.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone's always talking about best girl being Airi or Kayo but it's time for best bro Kenya!

Cliffhanger yet again but what else can you expect from this show? Even when everything seems to be working, you know the show is just going to come in a kick your happiness to the ground and point and laugh at you.
>> ARTICLE
This show just can't let us have a nice moment can it? Every time something works out I'm waiting for it to end horribly. 

The red eyes are interesting, they appear to mean the person had evil intentions. Freaked me out when Satoru had them! 
>> ARTICLE
The sound of those rubber boots will haunt me for a week now!

I jumped out my seat saying there was no way that was 20 minutes. Holy shit this show is killing me on a weekly basis.

Another great episode! I can't wait until next week. Also, I hope Hinazuki, and Satoru don't end up being like Mayuri, and Kyouma. Steins;Gate fans will know what I mean. 
>> ARTICLE
I can't tell you how hard my heart is beating every episode of this I watch.
>> ARTICLE
Kenya is so full of suprises! I initially thought he may be that annoying  know-it-all type of person be he's really not. It's like Satoru is the heart of the operation but Kenya is the brain.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still very suspicious about Kenya, but comparing the [intruder's jacket](http://i.imgur.com/jiJaJ3A.png) and [Kenya's](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/bokudakegainaimachi/images/7/70/Concept_Art_Kenya.png/revision/latest?cb=20160115030019), they are NOT a match.

These happy episodes give me so much anxiety because you just know something bad is gonna happen, just not when. At the same time there is always that slime hope that things will be just fine this time. Makes is even more crushing when it's not :( Fuck, I can't wait another week.
>> ARTICLE
Why doesn't Kenya question the fact that Satorou knows Kayos gonna die
>> ARTICLE
I don't normally get too excited when I watch shows, but I could not physically stop myself from yelling "fuck you" at the end of this episode.
>> ARTICLE
Did i miss an episode or something? How can Kenya stay calm and not suspect Satoru after hearing "Hinazuki will get murdered"? Its almost as if Kenya is fully aware of Satoru's inner thought and revival abilities. 
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone else think the ending was cut poorly? It feels like it got cut sooner than it was supposed to.
>> ARTICLE
Another fucking insane ending like WTFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!! I got so paranoid and creeped out at the end. Also notice how Satoru's eyes were red when trying to push her off the stairs, Thanks to Kenya for the stop.
>> ARTICLE
why it is the last revival? cause he is already arrested? 
even in jail i think he can still call for the revival tho
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he's saying he won't be able to revive again, especially given its somewhat uncontrollable nature.  It strikes me more that he's resolving to do things completely correctly this time, preventing the need for any more returns to the past. 
>> ARTICLE
I've just given up. Every time a happy moment happens in the show or if the plans are going accordingly, I think to myself "Nope, it can't be this easy." I know it can't be this easy, I except something bad to happen but my heart still feels like it's getting stabbed. 
>> ARTICLE
I want to believe nothing is going to happen to Hinazuki considering we *have* had at least one deceptive cliffhanger (Airi in her house fire)
>> ARTICLE
I'm really dumb when it comes to digging into what the characters are saying, why was Kenya on the verge of crying over saying that Satoru actually helped? 
>> ARTICLE
almost had a heart attack, blood and bloody ashes !

With each passing episode, I am severely urged to just fuck waiting weekly and just binge read the manga already.

I'd appreciate it if this show stopped TOYING WITH MY EMOTIONS

Not really.. since Okabe never went [S;G](/s "as far as Homura to save the person/-s they cared for. Homura became "evil" itself only to become with Madoka forever while Okabe never went the evil route. Why I am saying that Satoru becomes like her is how he would've gone that path if he had killed Hinazuki's mother. With how we saw the ending of ep. 7 we can guess that Satoru might go under and beyond, to do the extreme, only to save her. Time will tell...")

Fastest 23minutes I experienced recently.

It all just flew by somehow :/
>> ARTICLE
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
>> ARTICLE
I think Satoru's mom will be there and see the murder but just a bit too late.
>> ARTICLE
So wait, was it explained to Hinazuki that she was gonna die?
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone answer this for me? 
In the present time, is Kenya still alive? Or was he somehow killed? 
Would be freaking interesting to see their interactions in the present day when Satoru gets locked up. 
>> ARTICLE
Kenya was not on the victim list satoru mentioned earlier. the victims were all girls except the really feminine boy that was playing cards with them this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I understand Satoru is really desperate about this whole thing, but why would he think that letting Hinazuki stay in that bus was a good idea? It's more like helping the murderer than hindering him.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else notice Satoru's eyes turn red? Also, I still don't know what the point of the book was.
>> ARTICLE
Kenya knew Satoru was acting different so he pretended he lent Satoru a book a few weeks back. Satoru, assuming this happened and he just forgot, goes along with it saying he'll read it when he gets home.

This immediately triggers alarm bells for Kenya because he never gave Satoru a book in the first place, so why would he accept the fact that he was lent one so easily?
>> ARTICLE
A not so surprising development, a little too mainstream for an anime that distinguished itself from others through its unique change of pace. Quite sad. I hope the next episode will raise the bar again and not leave it so low. A 8/10 episode.
>> ARTICLE
God fucking damnit im left guessing what will fucking happen next. But im somewhat hoping its not the killer that found her. Which would be great plottwist,like some neighbour or someone. But hardly
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god this was amazing, they officially topped the manga.
>> ARTICLE
In terms of story progression everything has felt pretty expected and predictable, but the one thing I can't figure out is who the killer is. 

Something inside of me really wants to say Kenya might possibly be the killer or aiding the killer, I mean the killer looked to be about the same age as Satoru at the beginning of the episode. I don't really know, but I feel like it has to be someone we've already met this far in. Maybe it could also be that one friend with the glasses that I literally cannot even think of his name. Either way, I feel like there's two people involved in the disappearances, but I could be completely wrong; the ending of this episode certainly makes you think it's an adult both in the 80's and during the present, fuck it could even just be his mom.
>> ARTICLE
How crazy would this be if [Stain's Gate spoilers](/s "they went same route as with Mayuri and he would just not be able to save here and we would spend the rest of the show watching him trying different things and slowly going crazy.") :)
>> ARTICLE
So is the bus the location from the key visual?
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling the person entering isn't the killer but Satoru's mom. She saw him get up in the middle of the night, but that detail was never elaborated upon. She's likely been following the kids to see what they're up to.
>> ARTICLE
I find all these comments that are religiously praying that the person at the end is Satoru's mom somewhat suspicious. You guys better not know more than you're letting on and are just setting yourselves up for a "I was right all along" next episode. _

Is this anime that good? i've not seen any random episode discussion thread get this many upvotes, and the MAL entry has an incredible rating..?

It's better than the synopsis suggests but i feel like there are too few suspects to be an amazing mystery anime. It probably got that many votes because this episode is a massive cliffhanger.

I get excited, and then it trolls. Just leave her alone.

After finishing RWBY this week, I can't stop seeing death flags everywhere. Every scene with Hinazuki, I'm just scanning everything as a flag. Fuck me, I need to get off this wild ride

the killer could of been stalking kayo the entire time so it makes sense if he knows where she was hiding

FUCK

FUCK

SATORU U DIDN'T FIX SHIT U JUST DELAYED IT (I...think???)

FUCK. DIDN'T HE KNOW WHO IT WAS???? WHY DIDN'T HE ALERT THE POLICE. 

also I legit almost cried when he went back and said "i'm so glad :')" QQ

Also kenya knows way too much especially with that whole book scene wtf. Also how'd the killer know she was in the bus unless she was stalked or someone snitched (is that why the teacher was on the phone?)
>> ARTICLE
I think I should start watching this anime. Maybe it's better than Grimgar? 
>> ARTICLE
Fucking fuck!
>> ARTICLE
Let's assume that whoever was going into the bus was Satoru's mom an important question remains is she going to help them or is she going to bring Kayo back to her mother (which could practically undo everything Satoru's done up to this point). I don't want to belive that she'd bring her back but she might feel compelled too. I'm also hoping that the teacher was calling Child Protective services again.
>> ARTICLE
Is no one going to mention that hinazuki was perfectly fine with kenya and satoru leaving her on the bus for several hours at night? Even I would freak the fuck out.
>> ARTICLE
If I were in her shoes, I'd be fine with it too honestly. I mean everything is better then to stay with her mom and that boyfriend of hers who abuse her every single day.
>> ARTICLE
God Damnit, story was too happy for it to end like that ahhaha.


Kenya seems ridiculously intuitive, its hard for me to believe that he doesn't have some 2nd nature ability too.  

This is a farfetched crazy idea of mine but i feel like Satoru..... is the killer? Those red eyes he had before pushing the mom made me think what if at the end of the story he realized that saving hinazuki destroys more than it saves and he somehow goes back in adult form... maybe after mastering time travel ahahahha. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it would interesting if one week we just agreed to delete any comment that complains about the cliffhanger. We get it. It ends on a cliffhanger every week. You're watering down the discussion by flooding the thread with the same comment over and over again.


>> ARTICLE
I kind of expect them to give us an explanation behind Satoru's power revival. Somehow there is probably going to be a twist to the power or somebody else who has the power i'm not sure...

Eitherway would be nice to have some explanation for it.
>> ARTICLE
Why did Saturo say it's his final revival? is it? i think he is gonna need another one going by how this episode ended.
>> ARTICLE
It's probably more out of desire than actuality.

Does anyone know what book they were talking about?

The book doesn't exist. Kenya said as if he gave a book to see whether Satoru is hiding something from him.

camping in bus is looks fun, but in Winter of Hokkaido(same latitudes as Chicago)? hell no.

Also did anyone realize they are also dropping subtle hints about Hiromi which very possibly could be the reason he's the next target. Nobody home until 8pm? Easiest target second to Hinazuki standing alone at the park.

This show is giving me anxiety. The entire episode, every time the shot changed I was looking for a killer. Every time Satoru left Kayo's side I was afraid she might have been taken. Shit's real man.

I'm rewatching the series once more and some questions are arising that have not been clear:

What is pizza girl's dream?

Where is the Hideout the kids are reffering too, where Satoru left his gloves?

What did Satoru write in that story book?

Pizza girl and Hinazuki both say the same thing, "say same words over and over and it'll eventually be real." Are they sisters or related?

I've thought Kenya was the killer for a long time now, but I'm certain now, and I'm pretty sure he can also use time travel powers like the hero. There's something up about him.
>> ARTICLE
Why does Satoru arbitrarily announce that he won't get another chance if he fails, and that this is his final Revival?  Did the anime fail to adapt a scene from the manga where his fairy godmother appears and tells him that her magic wand is out of power?
>> ARTICLE
It's a vow of determination that he's not going to fail this time.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't seem like it from the wording used in the subs.  "I won't get another chance if I fail" is accepting the possibility of failure and stating that he won't be able to try again should that failure occur.

If he had *only* said "This is my final Revival!" that could've been a vow of determination, yes.
>> ARTICLE
Yet another incredible episode. But damn don't these episodes just feel so short!? 

I dunno, maybe it's the suspense or just the hype but boy oh boy (cause it's a normal length episode), for some reason....An episode of Erased literally has me on the edge of my seat and time just flies by so quickly that it feels like 10 minutes XD 
>> ARTICLE
Are Satoru's words enough to save his mother? He told her that she does in fact have a direct bus line to the place she was supposed to go in episode 1, so she won't stay with him, won't get murdered and all that?
>> ARTICLE
It's cool to note that in one scene when the teacher begins realizing Kayo is missing and he's looking down at some papers it fades to the overhead spotlights overwatching the bus that Satoru and Kayo are hiding out at.

Very subtle to notice but it's pretty great how the creators sneak in little things like that for the viewers.

Facts:

* This story begins on May 14, 2006 (26 days before the start of the World Cup).

* The third episode of *The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya* aired four weeks earlier, on April 16, 2006.

Wild speculation: Kenya, like Satoru, is a time traveller, and his question about the book is a subconcious reference to an anime he saw (from his perspective) a few weeks earlier.  Or he has a reason to think that future-Satoru would have watched Haruhi and is making a deliberate reference to see if he reacts.

[Wilder speculation](/s "Kenya is an alien.")

Side note: what is "The Switched Man"?  AFAICT Poe never wrote a story with that title.

Why are they making Yuuki look more and more guilty every time they show a scene with him and Satoru? I feel like Satoru is ignoring these signs over the assumption that he has nothing to do with the murder.

Ahhh seeing his mother alive again is nice. She's so awesome.

I knew Kenya was too perceptive. He may not be someone who can do revival as well but it seems like he's not a normal kid.

Kenya is 200% the killer. Calling this shit right now. The killer clearly knows Satoru in the future, and I think it's reasonable to assume he knows Satoru in the past too. I said a few weeks ago that I think Kenya has Revival too, but now I think it's definitely because he's gone back in time to prevent Satoru from preventing him from murdering Kayo. There's straight up no other explanation that makes sense to me.That's why he was acting different this time around and actually called Satoru out on being different. He was revived back to the same moment that Satoru was, and that's why he asked Satoru about the book. He changed something so that Satoru would talk to him. How else could he change something so major like that with absolutely no prompting from Satoru?
>> ARTICLE
I think Kenya is the killer in the future while the teacher is the killer in the past and they have some sort of partnership. They both know the same things about Kayo and both have this "I know something you don't" feeling to them.

Satoru felt much more distant from Hinazuki this episode. Reminds me a lot about how [Steins;Gate](/s "absorbed Okarin got in steins;gate and grew away from Mayuri ")


Not sure if the same thing will happen but it's just something I felt watching this episode.

It's definitely giving me the S;G feelings, though I doubt it'll turn out the same.

We saw that Kenya and the teacher were talking at the end of one of the earlier episodes, Kenya is the few people that knows that she's staying on the bus I just feel like it all kinda connects. 
>> ARTICLE
Couple of questions not related to this episode but anyway

Why was hiromi was murdered as a decoy? I didnt get that

Is ERASED really the english translation of Boku dake ga inai machi?
>> ARTICLE
Hiromi was murdered to make it seem like the killer didn't know that Hiromi wasn't a girl. Up until him, the only people the murderer had been targeting were girls. By doing this, the murderer would be removing anyone who knows Hiromi from the suspect list.
>> ARTICLE
Ah thank you so much that was the only thing that was bothering me

>> ARTICLE
"The Town Where Only I am Missing" is the approximate translation, ERASED is just the English name given to it.
>> ARTICLE
Kenya's setting off some alarms for me. I'm pretty sure he's part of the problem, not the solution.

Life is Strange really ruined me for Boku dake ga Inai Machi. The perpetrators are most likely analogues in these both works.
>> ARTICLE
I really don't understand why he hasn't tried getting his mother involved. Is Japanese culture really weird about child abuse or something? Why is the teacher waiting until Spring to tell anyone? That shouldn't make sense to a 29 year old. I really like the premise, but how much longer do I need to suspend my disbelief?
>> ARTICLE
I figured that he wasn't telling her certain things because of how it might affect the future. If he tells his mom about Kayo being abused and she tries to do something about it, Kayo's mom could end up talking to someone else about it - and that someone else might be the killer. Plus I'm starting to suspect that the killer is capable of revival, that he knows Satoru can do it too, and because of that he's stalking Satoru to watch his moves and be able to pin the murders on him both in the past and the future.  
  
Time paradoxes. EEeeessh!

Yashiro waited for 15 years.

Kayo didn't.

I honestly love how Kayo did not wait and I know Satou would not have wanted her to. She is her own person and is totally justified to make her own choices, Satou made sure of that. Also, yes I know you post was a joke, but just saying because I am a narcissistic piece of shit that needs his opinion known.
>> ARTICLE
Couldn't agree more. Honestly floored by the amount of negativity here surrounding Kayo getting married and having a kid. She got to live a rich, happy life. That is *exactly* what Satoru would have wanted.

I shipped Kayo x Satoru too, but when Satoru ended up in a coma, it was like, she'd *better* not have spent 15 years waiting.

>> ARTICLE
Could you elaborate?
>> ARTICLE
[Erased Manga](/n "Well in the manga Aniri falcon punched the journalists who took pictures of Satoru and Kumi, then she told Satoru her dream of been a camera man. ")


>> ARTICLE
Without getting into too many spoilers, the manga is 44 chapters, with ~12 of them taking place after Satoru wakes up from his coma. During this time, Airi's character appears and is a plot point/driving force in Satoru's recovery. Since the anime only had 2 episodes to cover everything after his coma, some plot points were cut while keeping the soul of the story intact. Unfortunately, this means the Airi scenes were cut, and the ending doesn't feel nearly as complete in comparison.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like the whole ending with Airi being framed by his hands after the blue butterfly showed up and sort of guides his hands over to her meant it was just fate that they were meant to end up meeting regardless of what happened in the other timeline. Though I feel like they could have shoehorned her in somewhere in the last two episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Furthermore, Yashiro didn't ask one of Satoru's friends to fill his hole. Satoru was the only one that would suffice.
>> ARTICLE
Now THAT'S commitment.

And she's not underage either ; )

I just came back from trip to Japan this week, and visited Hakodate, Hokkaido while there. 
The top photo is the scene from Mt Hakodate in episode 8 in Satoru's (future) memory.
The bottom photo is the one I took earlier this month. 

It's pretty identical, so I figure the anime probably took the photo near this time last year.  
And yes it was cold as hell lol.

The latter part of the show was decidedly weaker, but it was nonetheless an enjoyable ride!

>> ARTICLE
The fact that they re:re:corded (wink wink) the song has been my nerd pleasure since they first announced it. I love how the song talks about having regrets and not being able to go back in time to change things, and how this ties in so perfectly with the show, where the main character literally goes back in time to change things. And to top all of that, they went back and re-recorded the song, i.e. they went back in time and changed things! *nerdy internal scream*
>> ARTICLE
The ending was satisfying as fuck.  No cock-teasing at all and some lame attempt at being edgy like so many anime these days.  Just a complete ending with the loose ends all tied up and everyone content.

[**Airi**](#akyuusqueel)
>> ARTICLE
Completely agree. I know that people have various problems with the show but I found that everything that it does right outweighs the flaws to the point that I don't care about them.
The cinematography, the music, the theming and symbolism. All of these shone throughout the series in ways that anime in general could do with a lot more of.
Plus Airi end is best end.
>> ARTICLE
Despite it feeling a tad rushed towards the end (only a little). I still gave it a 10/10. It's one of my favourite animes.
>> ARTICLE
It is a good Anime, but it suffered under the 12 episode restriction.

Maybe it needed the rare 13 episode season

Say what you will, but I feel that it was nicely paced. It was no Charlotte

24 episodes would have dragged the story way too much though. They made the right choice.

yes but u/rainyland pretty much said what i was thinking

I think 15 or 16 episodes would have been perfect. Would have been able to go into more detail on a lot of things that the manga covered without getting too dragged out. Overall, I think this was still an above average anime that will promote more readers of a truly great manga.

Damn people liked the saving Kayo story more than the overall story itself. Oh well, I liked it, Airi fans got the ending they wanted, and they wrapped it up nicely. And since the Anime split off from the manga in terms of endings, it gives me incentive to read the manga. Overall I give it an 8/10

I'm one of them as well, Saving Kayo could become the entire anime and I would love it more than what it was but nonetheless it is still awesome.

I don't really care for who ends up with who, I only wanted Satoru to have a happy ending with him saving his friends and realizing his dreams of becoming a hero and a successful manga artist. This is the best ending I could have hoped for Satoru. This show was great from start to finish.

A good show AND full of memes? 

Truly I have been blessed this season. 
>> ARTICLE
I liked it. Apparently, the manga is very different from the anime, but I honestly don't think we should compare them at this point. If you think of it as a "different route" then I think it makes it a lot easier to enjoy. *I* for one haven't even read the manga yet, so I fairly enjoyed the conclusion.

But honestly, if Airi was going to play that little a role, I'd rather have Satoru stick together with Misato or something, because I saw more connection between those two, than a random occurrence underneath a bridge. I *was* all "yay!" at that scene, though. I guess, though, if it worked for Steins;Gate, it can work for BokuMachi.

Overall, I liked it. Nothing that really blew you away, but it certainly kept me interested and entertained throughout. Also made me buy the manga, so there's that, too. Rushed, but not diced up. If it was 2 cours, I feel like it would have dragged, so maybe 1.5 would have been nice, but we all know that's next to impossible. I think they did well with what they had.
>> ARTICLE
Most manga readers might disagree. But I feel thematically the ending was VERY similar in theme. Obviously the setting and how it developed was different and airi was more or less thrown in in the anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I think the conclusion of manga and anime are _extremely_ similar. They just got to the conclusion in different ways that were both done pretty well.
>> ARTICLE
yea pretty much I honestly thought the set up in the manga was a little long. We already hit the big climax I didn't need to wait that long for the finale. But I'm a guy who likes concise clear stories, which is why i liked this anime and anime's like death parade.
>> ARTICLE
While the locations and series of events that took place in the manga are different, I'm very happy with the way the anime shortened things up to make the pacing work.

Keeping everything confined to the hospital, while keeping the same general character beats (Kumi's life threatened, Kenya and Satoru planning to thwart Yashiro ahead of time, Yashiro and Satoru's final showdown) worked very well. The manga just feels like the same thing in a little bit of a different setting with a more drawn out conclusion that slows down the pacing of the last few chapters to a crawl. It's still good, but I think the anime version is tighter, more well-written, and better paced.

And of course, the Airi scene at the end is almost exactly the same because it was perfect to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
This exactly. The manga setting does nothing that the hospital did not accomplish. It made sense to stay there.
>> ARTICLE
> But honestly, if Airi was going to play that little a role

Airi really feels like a wasted character in this adaptation. 
>> ARTICLE
Airi was pretty great for the amount of screentime she got. It's unfortunate that there wasn't more of Airi to develop her as a character.
>> ARTICLE
I like how people shit on the Kayo shippers but suddenly Airi appears out of nowhere and makes the ending 10/10 for them lol.
>> ARTICLE
I suppose it's because in the Manga she played a large role in Satoru retrieving his memories. She was the one who got rid of the paparazzi , and her only having been in Satoru's future (which he forgot about) meant that he started piecing together why he was such a skilled drawer, why he wasn't shocked at the fact that he was old etc.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is much more clear about an Airi ship, and the problem with the anime is that they cut her of the conclusion and the important role she played because of what she meant to him.
>> ARTICLE
Most Airi shippers are from the Manga. The manga ships them better since the Anime cut some scenes. It also gives Kenya a bigger role a few other characters different roles.

Honestly from the Manga u feel like Satoru really had a stronger connection with Airi than Kayo. You can see how they tried to do that by always making him flash back to airi who always seemed to impart some wisdom onto the older satoru and only during his revive does he understand waht she means
>> ARTICLE
The anime ended perfectly considering they had to narrow it down into 12 episodes, but I suggest that people should go and read the manga now that it is over, especially the Yashiro flashback arc/chapter. Topping to the ice you know ;)

[Fun fact for those who are interested about the manga](/n "He actually falls into a coma and sleeps for another year. ")  
Not a huge spoiler, and it mostly didn't change anything about the story.

Also props to the director for directing this really well.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah after watching the finale and then reading the manga I think the anime did a nice job for being able to fit it into the 12 episode block

>> ARTICLE
Since there was a butterfly at the end, does that mean he's going to into the past?
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure it was symbolic of the last character, as if to say he's getting a chance to live the past he could've had with her.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah since the last time we saw the butterfly was right there as well, I'm pretty sure it's the timelines connecting to finish making the "correct" timeline.
>> ARTICLE
I started having crying fits after watching the episode. Judge me all you want, but this show seriously hit me hard. I never really felt like I had totally wasted much of my years of existence up till now. I grew up quite a bit like Satoru: lived in a quiet place, put on my facade every day, didn't have lots of friends, etc, so seeing how he was able to do the little things that changed so much...idk it just hit me.

Serious message: make sure you are your own superhero, be genuine and don't turn away from mistakes or challenges. None of us have 'Revival', we can't change the past so we have to make the present count for the future. If I'm every lucky enough to have kids, I'm making sure they know this. This show made me believe in superheroes again.

I'm sure there are flaws in this show, but I personally can't see any. The OST was catchy as hell and the ED was beautiful. I absolutely love this story and the only thing keeping it at #2 all-time for me is the childhood nostalgia/view of the world I got from my #1 as a kid. That show told me how the world was really a bad place with bits of good. BokuMachi just increased the amount of good I see in the world.

I'm sorry, this is a random dump of emotions. It's 1 pm where I am and I'm gonna go take a nap now.

**EDIT:** Wow, I got so many neat replies from this! It's awesome to see that I'm not the only one who could relate to Satoru and react emotionally to this show. I'll be spending on ERASED merch at Fanime, that's for sure haha.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for your comment, it really resonates with me because I feel exactly the same way about myself. Satoru is actually one of the very few protagonists I actually identified myself with.
>> ARTICLE
What he said about "good buddies" versus "casual friends" hit me hard too. I always had a group of friends I'd always hang out with, very casual, very fun. But, it was never anything where it felt deep (at least for me in the group). I don't think it was my friends, but rather me. I closed myself off, hid who I was, wore a heavy heavy mask. After splitting and going to our separate colleges, we hang out occasionally on breaks, but it's easy to tell that the ties between me and them is getting thinner and thinner. I'd say it's just about to snap.

This series is really teaching me how to cherish the time I have with my friends, never taking anything for granted, and removing the thick mask I put on.
>> ARTICLE
I guess the wild ride is finally over.

So in some parts I actually like this _better_ than the last chapter. Especially showing us the other kids as adults. And while they had to change and cut good stuff, I am glad how they saved the best bits into a good ending.

Kudos, this was a good finale, and I am glad I can _finallly_ talk about this with my friends. It got so bad they actually forbade me to talk about my impressions of an episode because they feared everything I said was a spoiler. Geez, I am not bad. (Except for that one time I spoiled Jojo to someone since I assumed they would know the ZA WORLD meme.)

I would have to rewatch the episode, but it seems that, while they caught Yashiro in a weird situation, I don't see how they caught him in attempted murder. In fact, it looked like he was trying to save Satoru from committing suicide, had a strange conversation with him, couldn't hold on to Satoru anymore, and then was going to look at the body/commit suicide?

I guess he could be convicted by the testimonies, and maybe they recorded the call and what Yashiro said while holding Satoru? The latter isn't incriminating, and the former is too ambiguous.

except the entire conversation while hes being held over the edge is witness testimony

Well Airi end it seems.

Overall the series was very good for the first half but it seemed like the author had no idea how to end it.

However from what i have been seeing i have a strange feeling that this series will be more remembered for the NTR that happened rather that the actual story especially given the shit fest on /a/ last week

So I'm new-ish to anime and forgive me if I'm wrong but is the point of anime the relationships?

I thought the story was pretty solid. The ending wasn't 10/10 but it was better than Higurashi's deus ex machina. 

I try to find people discussing it and 90% of posts are people talking about how either two little kids should've got together (wat) or how it's bad that Satoru and Airi got together (also wat.)

So as far as Kayo goes, they were kids.... Do you really want to see kids hook up? Outside of that, it was 15 years. Look at your life now. Would you date someone you haven't talked to in 15 years? Do you wish you "waited" for someone from 15 years ago? It hurts my head to imagine those lines of thought. 

As far as Airi goes, what? She went to talk to him and he was happy to see her. The end. I dunno why everyone assumes they got together. There's both more to a show and to a character than their relationships. Maybe they wound up together but they probably didn't. Even in the previous timeline, she was just on his side and believed in him as a friend. 

Maybe, and I know this might be a shocker, Satoru is still single and just living a normal life and may find love or might not but who cares?

So based off the ending Airi totally won the best girl contest amiright? ^^^/s



Alright I know this is a potshot and some of the comments here are already relatively moderate and not polarized but I hope this subreddit won't start up a circlejerk/anti-circlejerk over this show. 


I'm not the biggest fan of this show considering what I've posted on the past discussion threads but I do think this is a decent show with significant hiccups at the end of the day.


Oh and I thought the last episode was a bit iffy but overall pretty conclusive and got the job done. They did kind of shove the message to "take the first step" and "rely on others" but honestly it isn't a huge deal to me at all.



I think the show is a 6 or 7 out of 10 though; it certainty isn't a bad but I think the show could have improved in a lot of areas but I would still recommend it to others.
>> ARTICLE
According to the law of Best Girls:

Best Girl never wins.

So that can be up to debate depending if Airi ends up winning

Mom won. What are you saying? The best girl certainly won. 
>> ARTICLE
It's up between Sensei and Mom. Both waited 15 years and took care of Satoru.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly Airi is a better(?) character than Kayo. She's fun hopeful and kind. Not saying Kayo is bad, I love her because we were able to go through her struggle with her and really understand her. I prefer the relationship that satoru and kayo forged but I wonder how much of that was just satoru desperately viewing her as a victim he's trying to save. I also realize that there are lots of flash backs to Airi in like every other episode showing how his short interactions with her was really opening up his shell and how she was 'saving' him like he saved kayo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I honestly never thought of Kayo and Satoru romantically, just as Satoru going hard on the whole 'saving her' part. 
>> ARTICLE
Shhhhh don't say that 6 or a 7 means shit on some people's rating scales.
>> ARTICLE
Well I think it's understandable if a 6 means bad to some people. Because in school a 60%(or a 6 out of ten) is a failing grade and l'm pretty sure that's what alot of people base their scaling system off of.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, alot of people (myself included) probably would find it hard to say "Well, that show was average. 5/10." Because 50% is a failure, which is why averages for people tend to skew towards 7-8.


However, that leaves 1/2 of the rating scale completely unused unless you forcefully sit through trash or watch something objectively bad jokingly, or out of curiosity.
>> ARTICLE
I think people should look less at the numbers and more at the words that MAL has given each grade. A five is "average", six is "fine", seven is "good", eight is "very good", nine is "great" and ten is a "masterpiece". I often recommend series that I give a seven. Below that not so much, but it doesn't mean that I regret watching it. Once we go below five, I usually start to think that I might have wasted my time on watching something.
>> ARTICLE
The classic 10 is good, 9 is average and 8 is watchable scale.
>> ARTICLE
Does anybody actually just... do what the ratings on MAL say?

10 Masterpiece

09 Great 

08 Very Good

07 Good

06 Fine

05 Average

04 Bad

03 Very Bad

02 Horrible

01 Appalling

Cuz that's what I do... Most things are a 5/6 and then the numbers get rarer as you go either direction from there. Rating everything between 7 and 10 seems like a waste of six perfectly good numbers.

10 is fine, 9 is trash

>> ARTICLE
This show hasn't always been even. The episodes in the present time in particular were somewhat lacking, in tension when the tension was paramount, and in small and comfortable moments when the show veered more in that direction (in the second half), which made sense, since Kayo was stuck in the past. Thankfully, [last episode was pretty small and comfortable and good](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-11-circling-forward/), and this episode? This episode was *great*. It didn't give me the same amount of smiles and tears as episode 8 did ([Kayo's highlight episode](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-8-seeing-through-the-tears/), and being brought into the Fujinoma household), but it was at least that level of great. Can't think of a better episode of the show, and it's always nice to end on a very positive note, isn't it?

[My write-ups for BokuMachi](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-notes/) have always focused on the themes of the show, and this episode, as befits a finale, not made use of them all, but also tied them all neatly together, so let's look at some of them.

First and foremost, it's all about trust. [Now that Satoru is no longer a child](http://i.imgur.com/2CCynKo.jpg), his mother manages to move forward, and head off the mistake she's made in the past and was making now all over again - protecting her child so he could not grow up, could not move forward. What she's done is actually trust in him, and his ability to handle the world. And what did Kenya tell us, and the helpful memory of Airi too? That [you need people to believe in you](http://i.imgur.com/SO7h2JU.jpg) for [you to believe in them](http://i.imgur.com/i7bwF70.jpg), and [that people *need* to believe in others](http://i.imgur.com/Ps3AMOq.jpg), and [to be believed](http://i.imgur.com/CvK7sRe.jpg).

To live without believing in others is to live without having hope for them. It is to live always apart from others, because you fear they will hurt you. But everyone's the same. Everyone's afraid to be hurt, so people are wary of trusting others, before others trust them, while those others are waiting for them to make the first step. And so was Satoru, who in his first earnest discussion with Kayo admitted that he's keeping a mask on, and keeping others at arm's length. Which is why he had no real friends, no relationship he managed to maintain into his adult life in the original timeline.

And so, the 15 years he "wasted" weren't wasted twice over. First, as Yashiro had promised, they [had bought the life of everyone else](http://i.imgur.com/TtirBWf.jpg), every one of his friends. Second, he didn't really live in his original life anyway, did he? So it was easy to make that trade, especially when his mind did keep the memories of the life he hadn't lived any longer, for a life where he's willing to make the first step, to reach out, and affect others, and be affected in turn.

This is the way to note how Satoru's life transformed everyone around him, as a true hero. Kenya became a lawyer to pursue the criminal, Hiromi went on to become a doctor to be able to help people like his ailing friend, and even Satormi went on to help those around her (and a nice and small way of rehabilitating her character in the final act, kudos). And of course, Yashiro hadn't killed anyone for 15 years.

Yashiro is the perfect way to segue from "trust", because the point here isn't trust in and of itself, but the ability to feel as if others understand you, and believe you, and are there for you. It's about the relationships you weave with your surroundings. It's about filling the gaping hole in all of us called loneliness. Satoru's words about how he's the only one who knows what Yashiro is really like make one wonder if aside from filling the ennui, he wanted to be caught, just because it'd mean there's someone else out there on his same wavelength. Of course, we saw the spider's thread on his head at the end, because he too wished to find someone who'll help him out of hell. He just wasn't willing to trust. Well, and he was a serial killer, so there's that.

Yashiro enjoyed living on the edge, enjoyed living with the torture of *not* killing Satoru, of waiting for the one person who knows the why of him, and the how, and knew a bunch even before being confided with to come back. I really liked how they interwove this scene with Satoru's interactions with others, and also how *not loud* this scene was, full of [soft lighting](http://i.imgur.com/ZM1eExH.jpg) and [people coming face to face with themselves](http://i.imgur.com/egvG6Je.jpg). This was "post-reveal Yashiro" finally getting the Kayo treatment, of a person, rather than the "cliche villain" treatment, and the show and the scene both benefited tremendously from it.

And the way to finish the write-up, and the episode, is the same way the episode did, but a moment aside first. After Satoru said to his friends, "[Believing is really a term for hoping to believe](http://i.imgur.com/jYETSc8.jpg)," we've had the Yuki Kaijura violins, long-missing, finally make their return. This was the final thematic block by the show, put in place. Satoru wasn't believed by adults, so he didn't believe them, which meant he had no hope for the external world, for society, and for adults. So [when he sees Airi](http://i.imgur.com/DJ3f9SP.jpg) (21 year old now), and the episode closes with "[I never stopped believing](http://i.imgur.com/uoK6nh4.jpg)," what he's really saying is, "I never stopped hoping."

***

Now, a few small asides, and on the show as a whole.

1. The show as a whole wasn't always even. It had some down moments. Thankfully, they weren't more than 1-2 episodes long, and as the show traded away its tension, it gained in thematic clarity and depth. Both in the first return back to the present, and then later on with Kayo being saved, and what happened later. It does feel as if the show peaked a bit too early, as the show put *all* its drive in the Kayo arc, and sort of meandered, plot-wise, after. But the thematic keys were there, and this episode, which was a highlight, did tie it all together, especially the last arc's worth of content. I do wonder how it'd have felt to marathon the show, with the high tension of the first 6 episodes (and especially the first 4), to carry us through all the way in one go.

 I'd still give the show 8.2/10, because its highs were really high, showcasing a mastery of the format from a physical perspective, and the show at times had been at the height of tension, while at others it excelled at delivering small and precious moments. It wasn't perfect, but the good always outnumbered the bad, and it delivered on multiple angles.

2. "Boys' Flight" in the background alongside with "[You're *blowing* me away!](http://i.imgur.com/mZSlMM1.jpg)" and "[I love it when you take the bull by the horns, *Sensei*!](http://i.imgur.com/6CBgO6C.jpg)" - How lewd :P

3. "['Believing in someone', that's a weird phrase, isn't it?](http://i.imgur.com/VUzzH0A.jpg)" - For those who don't know, I'm a Philosophy grad student focusing on Philosophy of Language. I'm going to nerd out a bit about this, so forgive me. "I believe you" isn't a performative utterance, you believe in someone even without saying so, and you can say so without it being true, unlike "I forgive you," where the utterance is the act of forgiveness itself, or if you wish to believe forgiveness is an internal thing, then "I pronounce you husband and wife," is the prime example - the speech act is the act that does something. So it is not the same as the case I'm about to make, but I'll start with it anyway.

 Back when I was a teenager taking tennis classes, I once accidentally hit the instructor with a ball, it happens. After a few moments, he asked me why I didn't say I'm sorry, and my reply to him was "You know I should say I'm sorry, I know I should say I'm sorry, and you know I know, just as I know you know. So we can just act as if I said I'm sorry even without me saying so!" But we still hold it has value, beyond politeness and social convention, right? It's because the other side might not actually *know* we're sorry if we don't say so.

 "I believe in you" isn't the same as in "I believe in air." First, because saying you believe in something isn't about you not really believing in it, but about the *possibility* of you not believing in it, which is certainly true for other people. Second, because it has a social purpose, and here is where it's similar to asking for forgiveness, but say in a specific situation, where two people argue, and both say things they wish they hadn't. Saying you're sorry here is taking the first step, it's reaching out, so the other could reach back.

 Airi believed in Satoru, but look how shocked he was when she said that to him. Not because he felt it was evident and thus didn't need to be said, and not because he didn't think she really trusted him, but only *wanted* to trust him (though that was *also* true), but exactly because that utterance changed his perception of the situation, because he's not privy to her thoughts. Saying "I believe in you" has value exactly because it is not apparent, and not mandatory, because it's an act of taking the first step.

This is not the end folks! Anime-viewers, read the manga. There are parts cut out or changed by the anime and build more on the story. Even the anime had to take an anime only route in Episode 11. No, I am not saying the anime is horrible. It is amazing anime. I wish it had more episodes to cover more material and the rest of the manga

The manga has parts that you wished was in the anime. Read from Chapter 1.

If you dont want to read all then read from chapter 32 starting with Yashiro's backstory but more expanded on his start of his killing spree.


For manga-readers who read all the chapters, there is a Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi gaiden spin-off manga soon!
>> ARTICLE
This was the perfect show for me. Clear 10/10. I had hour long discussions with a friend about it after every episode, and we couldn't wait for the next. Every step of the way we were second guessing every little hint given. They gave so many hints about the teacher that by the end I was convinced that he was just a red herring. So when that reveal came I was still surprised even though there were all those big neon signs pointing towards him.

The after coma scenes felt a bit rushed, but not to the point that I would subtract a point. And in all this was some of the best entertainment I've ever watched.

ps: I can't be the only one annoyed by those "READ THE MANGA THE MANGA WAS BETTER GARRWARGHHGLLL" people. Sometimes I wonder if we are in /r/anime or in r/manga

Well, I thought it was a good ending to a good anime.

So is Airi over 18 in this end? I randomly came across someone saying she's 21? Does that mean Satoru is 30? 

Also, I was so thinking they were hinting at Misato liking him, and they were going to end the series with those two together, for a second there at least. Then, boom, Airi. Misato or Airi, Satoru's a lucky dude (but I guess a successful and handsome manga artist could probably get hot girls). 
>> ARTICLE
It was 2010 at the end of the series, so since Airi had been 17 in 2006 she should be 21 at that point. Satoru's age must've been 33.
>> ARTICLE
I like the ending. Series is a bit overrated but that is my opinion. It is still a good 7. 
This episode was probably one of the best ones, I didn't see the soft landing coming but I was fine if it went either direction really.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it was bad, but it was a little anticlimactic in my opinion. Seems like half the episode was trying to justify a reason for Yashiro keeping Satoru alive. I feel like it would have been a lot better with an extra episode to explain his motives better. 
>> ARTICLE
True. But I think they did exceptionally well tell this story in 12 episodes and not have a finale riddled with loose ends

TIL people on /r/anime have drastically different rating scales in comparison to myself. Lots of people are saying the show is a 7 or an 8, when I give lots of shit shows 7 or 8 depending on my enjoyment of them. 

I was also on the "show got worse after Kayo arc" train. The show was a 10 at first, but lowered to maybe an 8 or 7. But after rewatching the show with friends I felt differently and the show returned to a 10 for me. The things that felt flawed about the show, to me at least, felt more like my own fault for having pre-misconceptions about the show. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, the majority of people don't seem to utilize any of the ratings below 7, so I guess you can consider that pretty critical by /r/anime standards.
>> ARTICLE
Okay now that was a great ending. Not too much climax but tying up so many loose ends and pretty much giving us a time skip epilogue is great! I was so upset there was no Airi but wow that last seen totally saved my only big problem with the episode!

And so the wild ride ends. It dipped down in the past few eps but that's only because it started so strong. Many people will hate on this show because of how popular it got but it did a lot of things well. That intense feeling and unique concept made things a thrill to tune in each week and the little SoLish moments made the episodes sweet for a nice balance. Plus best of all a nice happy ending!

You did well Erased and I'm happy you ended strong :)

I think the ending would have fit more if they didn't change the other parts that involved Airi.

Want to say this, as a manga reader I freaking loved the anime ending.  I'm always going to critique episode 11 for rushing through things and skipping character development - however, the final episode's events flowed MUCH better than the manga, and I personally thought the dialogue with Yashiro-sensei surpassed the manga version.

Bravo A1, that was an excellent finale that stayed faithful in spirit to the source.

I think its pretty heartwarming that Misato ended up being good friends with Kayo in the future. I love reformed bully characters.

Well I did love this show but felt the direction kinda changed a bit from "save Kayo" to "better save the others too I guess" to "massive timeskip but it's cool because friendships last forever and the (sexy) killer waited patiently for me to flirt with him on the roof and give him a seductive wink before sending him to jail" (rip otp) to "are we missing someone? Oh yeah hi pizzagirl who I will creep out because you have just said a few words but I look like I'm going to cry because we have history that didn't actually happen" so yeah good show I guess.

I have several questions. What was with the doctor's secret phone conversation where he refuses some sort of order the "Director" gives him regarding Satoru?  And why does Sachiko tell Kenya and Hiromi not to talk to him about his past?

Tbh there are way too many people hating on this anime. It definitely has some faults but I think the overall directing, animation, and work they've done is just so goddamn good that the plot errors don't matter SO MUCH. So many people on MAL are being negative over every little fault. It was a pretty good anime, nothing is perfect.
>> ARTICLE
I felt like changing that much and having Airi as the main ship for the ending was a bit forced.  She didn't have as big of an impact as the other girls in the anime, so it doesn't fit well.  That aside, I think they did ok with wrapping up the story.  

Is it just me or was anyone bothered by the airplane landing near the end.  It was flying sideways.....

I was more bothered by the whole rooftop scene. Like one of those Disney movies where the power of friendship beats the villian.

Just finished the finale, I thought the anime wrapped up very nicely.

[That fucking plane](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18479907/ShareX/2016/03/2016-03-24_19-25-10.webm) flying sideways, though. :D

I couldn't focus on the last few minutes on the show at all because of it
>> ARTICLE
its landing, go google some landing videos and you will see some crazy stuff, but believe or not, that's what a landing plane looks like, from that angle. As for the crazy stuff, modern jets are amazing pieces of engineering even the they pretty much look unchanged from the 60s, so they can land in heavy crosswind, there are videos of current model 747s landing sideways. Boeing does the tests down in deserts in South America because they are testing extreme conditions and don't a perfectly reasonable failure publicized

It wasn't flying sideways it was landing, just not amazing well animated, and the lack of plane landing noise makes it fucking weird.

To be fair in heavy cross winds that is how planes land.

Landing is just crashing softly. Pilots are experts at crashing things.

This ending was more satisfying than the manga's ending, IMO. It was nice to see everyone for a moment during the credits. 

I really liked that bit with Yashiro shaving Satoru. It's messed up, but there is a father-son thing there. Overall, the show handled Gaku better, too. 

Kumi didn't need to be in the show. She provided nothing. 


>> ARTICLE
> I really liked that bit with Yashiro shaving Satoru.

I found that to be incredibly hilarious. Satoru was so totally chill, not worried at all, while Yashiro is crying. What a contrast.

> Kumi didn't need to be in the show. She provided nothing.

I actually really appreciated the scene where Satoru got to be Yuuki for Kumi and how her face lit up during his rehab. I guess overall she was pretty minor plot-wise, but she was so cute!

He was shaving him!? I thought he was contemplating on killing him there. :|

8/10 for me, started off hot but cooled down last few episodes, I'm glad Airi came back even if it was just for a bit.

YES I KNEW THEY COULDN'T LEAVE OUT TRUE BEST GIRL AIRI AT THE END
>> ARTICLE
I feel so strangely conflicted about this show. It's beautifully written and the narrative makes perfect sense but I'm just so annoyed that they would put such a huge emphasis on the relationship Satoru and Kayo nurtured together only to just ditch it completely in the final 3 episodes.

It felt so weird not having Kayo and Satoru engage in a meaningful interaction. Sure they had their exchange at the hospital but it was extremely brief and felt like the reveal was done to just to have conflict arise in the viewer's feelings. When the other manga writers mentioned snow I thought Satoru was going to go to the Christmas Trees and see Kayo there but nope. Fucking Airi. The 17 year old pizza girl/photographer extraordinaire. Ugh.

I don't think I've ever liked somebody's mom more than I like Satoru's Mom. What a woman!

Never stop loving pizza!

The [](/s "I beat you speech") was prob the highlight of the episode and to top it off the little underlining of the web string which really popped the whole scene off. Also, would like to say that the anime was really good overall and kept me entertain through out the series even if it had a different ending than the manga. Still a good 8.5/9 out of 10.
>> ARTICLE
And now the anti-circlejerk begins.....

I for one loved the ending and think it ended perfectly fine. 

I can understand how manga readers might differ, because the story actually differs in the manga. Generally i think /r/anime just gets salty when any good anime ends and expects cliffhangers on everything just to keep the story alive in their heads so they don't have to deal with something ending... 

P.S Yes, these comments triggered me...
>> ARTICLE
To do list

1. Read all of the ERASED manga

2. Read the spin-off

3. Watch The Mother's Basement vids related to Erased

4. Defend the show in various YouTube reviews ~~looking at you Digi~~

The fucking onion ninja followed me to work. Good thing its third shift so no guests can see my tears. I tried to find reasons not to give this show a 10 on MAL but I couldn't think of any. It was pure enjoyment throughout. Judge me if you want but I absolutely loved it, and now I have nothing to look forward to every Thursday. 
Sidenote: does anyone have a link to the ED of this episode? I need it in my life. 
>> ARTICLE
I fucking loved this ending. 

I mean this is practically a textbook example of a well deserved happy ending. Satoru manages to save the lives of everyone he loves, puts Yashiro to justice, finds success in his original job as a mangaka, and most importantly: has matured and become a better person through all his trials and tribulations.

The fact that Kayo is alive and happily living her own life in this timeline shows that Satoru's efforts were not in vain, and that his entire struggle throughout the series was worth it. We should be happy for them that everything turned out right, and not whining like kids just because they don't get together. For all it's worth, this is the most happy, but realistic ending they could have gone for. 
>> ARTICLE
Trying to read the manga but good lord the art is ugly. Is the mangaka really young or something? 
>> ARTICLE
It was decent. Not gonna lie, that ending song nearly made me bump it back into a 10 (cant blame me, that song is fucking amazing). But i will stick with a 8/10. Airi end is decent i guess. Satoru's amazing Mom is what makes me give this a 8/10 instead of a 7 or 6.

also cant lie but if KayoxSatoru did happen, i might have been more emotionally "happy crying" at the end. But its far from a tragic end, so ill give it a pass
>> ARTICLE
Animation and music makes this an 8/10 for me, story is about a 7 just for how it ends kinda weakly.
>> ARTICLE
I kept waiting for some huge buildup at the end but really the last few episodes just felt like one long epilogue.
>> ARTICLE
ITT people who are so salty.
>> ARTICLE
That was a rather satisfying finale. It was great seeing Satoru finding some solace in the fact that his 15 year old coma inspired and moved his friends to do great things. I'm also kinda fascinated by Yashiro's relationship with Satoru. ~~If I'm not mistaken, in this timeline Yashiro didn't murder anyone, right? So, in some sense, in this timeline Satoru was able to prevent Yashiro from committing the sin of murder and in an indirect way redeem him.~~ Yeah, okay, scratch that.

And yeah, seeing everyone grown up and happy put a smile on my face. 

Oh yeah, it's kinda funny how two of my favorite non-sequel shows of the season (other being Active Raid) ended with the bad guy [Active Raid spoilers](/s "willingly giving up.")
>> ARTICLE
> in this timeline Yashiro didn't murder anyone, right?

He had killed multiple kids before Satoru started cutting in with his revival ability, but statute of limitations on all those murders he committed ran out. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought that all that pseudo-talk no jutsu was quite jarring and cheesy. 
>> ARTICLE
What?
>> ARTICLE
Although I wasn't as emotionally invested in the show after Hinazuki was saved, I'm pretty satisfied with the last few episodes and the ending. I can see where people are coming from when they say it dropped in quality but the first half of the series was incredible and solving the mystery of the killer was satisfying to watch if nothing else.
>> ARTICLE
Ending wasn't "amazing" compared to the rest of the episodes but I'm glad it was solid enough that I will be able to remember the series for how awesome the ride was. The Airi addition at the end made me genuinely happy, too.

How did they from which part of the roof Satoru would fall from? How did they even know he would fall down from the roof?

Here we go with the final mental game against Yashiro! 

[Smiles like this ](http://m.imgur.com/d5UkzQc)   makes me think Yashiro doesn't have any major ideological reasons for his crimes. But just the thrill and the game of it.

And predictably, [he tries to use another child](http://m.imgur.com/neOTkkf)  to leverage Satoru to kill himself  in order to save her. 

Good thing Satoru and his friends are fully on board to fight Yashiro and expose his crimes. [Kenya has grown into a fine young man. ](http://m.imgur.com/FnihPYU) I  wonder if he is a detective. He has the keen instincts to be one.

Yashiro and his final bid to entrap Satoru.[ He really has fun doing all this.](http://m.imgur.com/IZNECqs) It is incredible how well the teacher disguised himself with[ just a hat and glasses.](http://m.imgur.com/Y5LCepJ) Not so sure why Yashiro sees Satoru so fondly here, though I  suppose he sees Satoru as a worthy rival.

Right as Satoru looks to be at death's door, [Yashiro regrets his decision to force Satoru's hand](http://m.imgur.com/dCDLI0k) Nice moment of clarity as Satoru makes it known to Yashiro that [ the teacher/killer has met his match.](http://m.imgur.com/JG2PPdv) Nice catch by[ Satoru's friends!](
http://m.imgur.com/52azcux) Kenya[ looking sharp.](http://m.imgur.com/0dTFMpj)  He really has been a great friend through all this. 

Nice final image[ Satoru's childhood friends.](http://m.imgur.com/kksHFgK) Satoru did right. So many things could have gone awry but Satoru finally did it.

As a nice cap to all the drama, it looks like [Satoru is fated to meet a healthy and safe Airi.](http://m.imgur.com/BAA63Vl)

Really sweet ending to a pretty nice final confrontation to the killer. We still don't  know precisely why Yashiro committed all those crimes, but it seems like he was in it for the thrill and fun of it and finally met a worthy adversary in Satoru. Even to a point of not killing him and even caring for him during Satoru's coma. It is a bit crazy how the teacher seems to have stopped all activities against Satoru upon him being hospitalized, but Yashiro did so in order to finish his mental games with Satoru.

Pretty satisfying conclusion to Satoru's final victory, and I  am glad Yashiro will get his due punishment instead of him jumping. It has been a great ride, with all of Satoru's friend finally showing to him that he is not fighting alone. And that Satoru's good deeds will reflect back on him at the end.

Looks like this wild ride is finally over, and I'm really going to miss it! It's too bad they apparently had to rush the ending, but I thought it still worked out pretty well. I was able to follow the progression of events well enough, and that entire scene on the roof was great. 

Also glad to see Airi finally show back up at the end. I kept waiting for her, and was starting to think they'd cut her entirely after all that previous build-up, but their reuniting scene was just about perfect.

All in all a pretty solid wrap-up to a fantastic start of the show, and it definitely has me wanting to read the manga to see everything they had to leave out!
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see that the exact same Jacket is still being sold after 15 years. 

Satoru you fashion beast.

Jokes aside, I really like this conclusion although the lack of Airi saddens me quite a bit :(

Well from this now on to Re:Zero which will air next season. Another great mystery/Psychological story.

I see a lot of people complaining about the Airi ending. They keep saying "Oh, she's like 13, how could they end up together." 

Stop for just a minute, look at the date of the ice hockey champions on the front of the school. 2010, which is 7 years after Satoru wakes up from his coma. Which would make Airi 20. Where's the issue?
>> ARTICLE
How are people saying that he ended up with Airi? She was 17 and he was 26.

He would literally be on his way to prison again.

The final scene takes place in 2010, so she's 21.

Idk what I'll, or others, will say in a few months when the hype dies down, but this was one of the best anime I've watched in a long time. I'm expecting my love for it to wane as I let it steep, but probably not too much. It slowed down towards the end, but I was never disappointed with an episode, which is pretty rare. This was an awesome show, and the ending was extremely satisfying imo. 
>> ARTICLE
Every time a conflict ended (i.e. Kayo was saved) I felt like an episode would be reaching or dragging, and that never happened. I loved the plot and, although it may have started as a "Whodunnit?" I wasn't disappointed that it was more about the details and intricacies of Satoru's revivals.

[I can't now, I can't.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr7mz52KkI1r021v0.gif)

I spent so much time and feels on this, it can't just end like this ;_;.
>> ARTICLE
From reading the comments, I feel I had a different experience with Erased than most of you. I held off on watching the show until last week, when my curiosity of why this show was generating so much discussion overcame me.  The only episode I had to wait for, was this one.  

First up, Satoru's mom.  
[](#toradorasalute)  
Possibly best anime mom. Few outside of Sanae from Clannad have made such an impression on me, all the more impressive because it was done is such a more realistic tone.  

Secondly, Airi. Watching the show in the way that I did, I didn't have weeks of time interrupting the story. A single line of dialogue from her became a strength that Satoru recalled many times during the show. As the last episode progressed, I felt like a hole slowly opened up as we learned about everyone but her, and see them all thriving in this new future. Seeing the pizza delivery driver, who turned out to be not her, evoked both a sense of nostalgia for his old life and a sense of regret that in this timeline he never had those interactions that he came to rely on throughout the story.  

Satoru encountering Airi at the end was a fitting finish to me. The show fostered a desire in me to have Satoru encounter her. The thing I enjoyed most about this scene, was [Satoru's smile](http://i.imgur.com/l0QYskA.gifv). Adult Satoru had only given us side smiles. I think even Hachiman would consider that "Genuine." 

At first, I thought the blue butterflies represented someones soul (Thanks, Bleach), signifying to Satoru that a life or death moment was happening. By the end I started to see them more as a sign of rebirth, or maybe wish fulfillment. He admits that he had always carried the burden of the past, and maybe the '2 minute' revivals were just his training course to prepare him for the big one. In retrospect, maybe they represented the wish he had, to have more courage as a child.  

The first memory that he recalls as adult-voiced Satoru, was that of Airi's belief speech. We even get to see it go from a blurred, burned out image into one that has clear focus. It is the one that makes him see that he can trust his friends, and from Kenya's speech, it has affected who they all are, 15 years later. Just as his hearts wish early on was that he had changed that event from the past, does the last butterfly represent his current hearts hidden wish to encounter Airi again? 

It's something I look forwards to exploring on a rewatch down the line.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I also experienced this show in the same way you did. I watched almost all the series on Sunday and whatever was left I finished yesterday so I also didn't wait long. I was also very excited about Airi's part at the end. I found my self very anxious right when we were seeing them hang out and drinking at the end. I was askiasking my self Airi,  where is she, will he ever see her again. Then the last part at the bridge I nearly screamed at my TV asking what about Airi. Seeing her at the very last part nearly made me jump up and down. Great show.

>> ARTICLE
Most of this episode actually felt kind of mediocre to me. I don't know how it ended in the manga but it wasn't until I recgonized the bridge architecture that I got excited. I remembered, there was one character left they hadn't resolved the outcome for! I was so excited for those final moments.

*Come on... come on... Appear already... OH SHIT, BUTTERFLY!*

*AIRI!!*
>> ARTICLE
One thing i did not understand about the revival happening, is why/how
did Satoru get back to his only slightly different future after he failed to save hinazuki. 

The other times revival happened, even in the beginning, he was never transported "back" to the future after he had done his correcting. He always lived through it again.

Falling into coma was a special case but it didnt seem very consistent. He could have been transported to after he woken up with his memories intact.
>> ARTICLE
This was a fun ride. I'm glad it ended with a happy ending.
Here's a gif of the wink this episode. How could I resist making a gif of such an adorable wink. I figured that just a screenshot couldn't do it justice.

Not thrilled by the way this ended.  After all that buildup and chemistry between Kayo and Satoru all of the sudden "Satoru was in a coma for 15 years and Kayo ended up with another guy", and we get a strong implication that he ends up with Airi instead despite that relationship being not nearly as well developed  (perhaps that relationship is stronger in the manga but we didn't really see any of that in the anime).  Also the resolution of the conflict with the killer was somewhat of a letdown, it seems like he had the protagonist cornered then suddenly we get a timeskip and he mostly just self-destructs.

Despite those flaws I have to say I really enjoyed this anime.  It was cool getting to see everyone as adults and the ending merely dipped in quality from "great" to "good".
>> ARTICLE
Coming into this, it was a surprise for me as a manga reader since they changed so much last episode. I'm kind of sad that they didn't have that whole plot of [manga spoilers](/n "Airi kind of jump starting his memories (and I wasn't even a fan of that ship). It was just kind of cool seeing him gaining his memories back. It also made the teacher creepier in his little disguise. ") I understand that the anime was rushed, but it kind of lost impact toward the end. I mean it really made me appreciate Yashiro. He was creepy as fuck, but he seemed more than just a serial killer with those scenes and background.

Also, [more manga spoilers](/n "I really wanted that part about Kenya lining up that Yashiro was saying he wasn't connected to that one murder with the missing picture. I found the beginning parts of BokuMachi fun because we were dealing with an intelligent killer and it was like a mystery drama. Speaking in Death Note terms, Kenya kind of filled the role of L, since Satoru wasn't always the brightest in his choices. I also really liked the part of the manga where Kenya was filling in Satoru about his past.")

Just little things... but those things were what made the manga for me. I mean the anime was great. But I almost feel like if I didn't read the manga starting halfway through, I honestly wouldn't have finished the anime.

>> ARTICLE
Pretty great ending to a decent series.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap, I don't know if it was present in previous versions of the opening but I saw something for a split second this time. It happens when Satoru's glasses get shattered in the rooftop scene. I paused it at that moment and found [this!](http://imgur.com/pcHtkQm)

This has been noted before in previous discussion threads, along with someone noticing the little strands on characters' heads.

With that being said, it's kinda cool to watch the OP now and pick out all the little clues in it.
>> ARTICLE
Yep its funny, they actually spoiled who the killer is since opening was first aired.
>> ARTICLE
Man, Satoru got cucked by Hiyomi. Like srsly? You can't make this shit up.

I never had my heart so torn apart when I saw Kayo walk in that room with fcking "Future" in her hands. My first thought was that she somehow got the D from Satoru when he was still comatose. Thats how much denial I was in. Like shit, fcking hook my girl up with Kenya at least. But nah, it gotta be the girly looking nigga! >:[

Literally killed the anime for me. Still good but it won't be the same anymore.

But at least my boy got Airi in the end. I can ship that. 
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck was that, Yashiro just gave up. He lived fine and somehow became attached to Satoru. That whole roof scene played out like a Disney movie, seriously anti climatic. THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP.

7.5/10 for me. 
>> ARTICLE
he didn't actually do anything wrong, other than trying to drown Satoru. He never killed anyone; he just wanted to.  
  You could say he tried to kill Satoru on the roof, but all the witnesses saw him try to *save* Satoru, before losing his grip. He'll be walking the streets again in no time.
>> ARTICLE
Well, he didn't kill the people that Satoru protected. In the past he's killed, and before he was Satoru's teacher he has killed. I think it was mentioned once or twice in the anime that there has been similar kidnappings/murders in neighboring cities as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Although they have no evidence, check the manga. It was revealed that he murdered people before this whole incident at Satoru's hometown, although indeed, they would have trouble proving that.

Not to mention, Satoru was on the phone with someone, so unless I'm not recalling the episode correctly, he got the audio from the beginning of that conversation.
>> ARTICLE
He killed other people in other towns prior to the start of the anime; the charcoal lighter and other tools he left the bus were indicative of that. They do mention the statute of limitations there, but they can also pin attempted murder of Kumi on him too.
>> ARTICLE
but seriously, I am probably dumb, but someone needs to explain to me what his initial motive for becoming a serial killer is, and why he decided he can't live without satoru, and why he thinks committing double suicide with satoru is the way to go, I am seriously lost here
>> ARTICLE
Becoming a serial killer is background in the manga starting chapter 32 that the anime didn't include. ( Slightly condensed in the hamster analogy)

He spent 15 years waiting for Satoru to wake up because he was dying to know how a child was besting him in his attempted murders. Yashiro killed no one for all of those 15 years, constantly visited the hospital, personally shaved Satoru etc... 
>> ARTICLE
You mean the power of the insane psychopath finally getting what he's always wanted?
>> ARTICLE
Honestly this episode totally worked for me until Satoru landed on the inflatable cushion to escape Yashiro.  What if he had landed elsewhere?  I was kind of expecting the others to already be up there or already following them to the rooftop.

The episode is really hit and miss afterwards.  I like the idea of the postscript, although I feel the montage was done moreso because they ran out of time/budget.  The Airi scene at the end was predictable, but I was fine with it.

That being said, I still really enjoyed this series.  The show is very similar to Death Note in that both start out incredibly strong and kind of fizzle out near the end.  Ultimately, the endings to both shows do not take away from the impressive initial effort.  This will still get a 9 from me
>> ARTICLE
I still believe. Satoru x Kayo ;-;
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Erased knew what it wanted to be. The manga itself was haphazard, I was hoping anime will improve upon that but no, it decided to be unfocused in another way by wasting precious time on the plights of Kayo with her mom and her doomed pairing with Satarou making the series seem unsure of its goal when she was out of the picture because guess what? she was just a part of manga not the whole point which anime falsely tried to portray at the start

If Sensei is such an important only person who can understand Satarou and vice versa then how about focus on this guys mentality a little more rather than cut his backstory to show filler scenes of Kayo bathing? You would show us Kayos moms backstory of all people but not the main villains?...wut?

How about give a little more time to Airi considering she was the one who ended up winning the guy not Kayo?

How about a little more focus on Hiromi and other friends at the start if you are going to tell us in the end how hur dur his friends are with him so he survived? Not to mention how MC seemed like a jerk in earlier episodes by ignoring Hiromi's looming plight over Kayos as if his life is less imp.

How about you make Kenya actually useful in the end like he was in the manga if you had decided to focus upon him at the start as one of the other imp child?

The 1st and the 2nd half were 2 different things and did not mesh well. This director is good for individual scenes, which were very cinematic but on the whole what did he wanted to show?

tldr: 1st half Kayo Kayo poor kawaii Kayo, 2nd half: Oh im a mystery thriller with other characters too, shit!

Although the show was still pretty good, I never thought it a masterpiece like the majority so it managed not to let me down as much as others in the end. Overall, it retained the initial score I gave it in episode 1 which was 8/10.

Now about the episode. Absolutely loved Satoru's gamble on the rooftop. He read Yashiro like a book. Though, them saving him was a bit ~~cheesy~~ underwhelming after all of that. Like...that's it? Also still pretty bummed that his power wasn't explained, so now it just looks like a convenient plot device. And that Airi end was clearly fanservice for the viewers, but I'm not mad at it.

I hope we all learned our lesson to not prematurely crown shows after 3 episodes. Though the 180 the sub made has been amusing to watch. On second thought, keep at it r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
>I hope we all learned our lesson to not prematurely crown shows after 3 episodes.

Not with next season with Boku Hero and "Swagamoto".

Hopefully we can calm our tits and just watch the series and then come to a conclusion towards the end instead of starting up circlejerks about how good a show is and that any dissenting opinion gets downvoted.
>> ARTICLE
I think Swagamoto will be dank meme-worthy so the anti-circlejerk might view the praise ironically.

HeroAca on the other hand, might become another Dagashi Kashi with all the heightened expectations. I'm a huge fan of the manga but it's still a shounen (damn good one at that) and people are expecting different. I expect criticism pretty early actually.
>> ARTICLE
I would say overall that the show started out strong, but after the first time jump forward to the present my interest just started waning. And once we got to the final third, all I can think of is "why, why are you doing this?" The ending still leaves so many unanswered questions and logic wise just unsatisfactory. 
>> ARTICLE
I just cried through the entire episode. 

I don't want it to be over. :'( 
>> ARTICLE
ENTIRELY different ending from the manga, but I liked this version too. 

My only gripe is the fact they cut out Airi's scenes so much from the previous episodes, that the emotional connection to the end isn't quite as heavy. 
(the anime cut out all the times Satoru has longed for Airi, and also changed her role as the catalyst and gave that role to Mirai)

They shafted Airi, but pizza girl is still best girl.

Yeah she's definitely gonna be getting the shaft all right.

Yay For Airi showing up at the end. Great end to a truly wonderful series!

I really did enjoy the show, one of my favorites that I've watched recently, but the show needed more episodes, I felt that it was too rushed in the end and that they just had to cram in everything.

I feel as though it didnt end as strong as it started but it was still an amazing anime. Every week i felt tempted to just binge the manga to find out what happens next but i somehow managed not to give in. In the end it was still great and based Airi showing up at the end was nice. Hopefully we get another anime that can make me scream at my screen over all those damn cliffhangers soon.
>> ARTICLE
AAAAAAA I love Airi and I was so close to thinking she wouldn't show up again, and as soon as I saw someone taking pictures I fucking knew it was her and screamed a little
>> ARTICLE
Really good show, reminds me a lot of steins;gate.

It'd be cool to get an OVA, just to see who Satoru marries or something. 

Just a nice episode of the whole gang catching up instead of just the few minutes we had there at the end.
>> ARTICLE
DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS:

can someone explain to me the ending? Doesn't the butterfly at the end symbolize that a revival is coming and he needs to do something to help Airi? I'm so confused by this ending

After reading the manga after watching episode 11 and then watching this episode. I think things flowed much better in the anime ending. Nothing was all that different and the ending of manga felt very convoluted. I'm pretty glad it ended in this simplified version.

I can't be the only one who thought the conversation felt like gay lovers having a confession session.

I can confirm you are not the only one. I found it to be quite hilarious. I definitely had not considered shipping Satoru with Yashiro before that point.

I did not think it would end on a happy note, but it did!!! When Airi showed up, I almost cried! Omg! So adorable!

This series kept me at the end of my seat for the whole ride! I give it a 10/10!

I'm going to start reading the manga soon. I want more airi buildup. Otherwise I won't be satisfied. As I like the most of you was a Kayoshipper.

That was a very solid ending. I liked the "connection" between Satoru and the Sensei and how it was played out. Seeing all the characters happily together at the end and the ambigious meeting with Airi was really satisfying. Overall it was a very beautiful and conclusive ending to a great show.

I would say I prefer manga version as it shows Satoru and Yashiro trying to outsmart each other back and forth [manga spoiler](/n "with Satoru using his knowledge from Airi's assault."). But it would require one more EP for that to work. At least they keep the original epilogue, which I like, but not sure how does it work with anime only viewer.

Was anyone else expecting something horrible to happen in the last 2-3 minutes like in every other episode? When he put the finger frame over someone and saw flashes I was 500% sure he had just been shot and the anime would justify my paranoia of good endings in it's episodes.

I can't believe I nearly skipped this series. I'm so glad I decided to watch the first episode; that ending really hooked me. I would have otherwise missed out on what I think is a great series. All of the characters felt like real human beings, every episode was visually beautiful, mentally engaging, and always left me wanting for more (dem cliffhangers).  I'm going to miss the thrill of waiting for the next episode :(

Rate 9.5/10

This was a phenomenal anime series from start to finish; narratively, thematically, the production quality, the direction, the characters - everything - was fantastically well done, despite the minor complaints that this series may have gotten during its run, such as the 'predictability' of the killer's identity during later episodes or the killer's backstory being glossed over, these 'flaws' paled in comparison to how well executed and complete this series was, I can't praise it enough and I can't put into words how much I loved watching this from week to week but I will simply say that it well deserved the hype.

This anime is easily the anime of the season and it's going to take a damn good show to stop it from taking its rightful place as anime of the year; it's easily now one of my all-time favorite anime series. I hate the fact that it's over and now all I want to do is rewatch it all in a single day.

Thank you, A1 Pictures, for this masterpiece of anime production; anyone who still now beats the dead horse of 'A1 Pictures only makes mediocre anime that have no consistency or passion' are just plain wrong.

OH GOD, is this episode worth watching? ;_;
>> ARTICLE
So I really enjoyed the show, but I think I didnt fully comprehend why Yashiro needed Satoru to live or whatever was going on there. Anyone have any ideas?

>> ARTICLE
Basically, Yashiro had an addictive/obsessive personality. He felt alive because someone who knew his plans and knew his crimes was still living. In the way that a kleptomaniac feels alive by stealing, Yashiro felt alive by believing that he would need to kill/control Satoru in the future. Ultimately, he was unable to kill Satoru because killing him would be throwing away the one thing that made his life matter.

Furthermore, to compare Satoru to the gerbil that he let live and ultimately die is a poor comparison. Yashiro let the gerbil live because he was fascinated by it, and enjoyed its will to live. He also enjoyed killing the hope it had. Satoru was the opposite. Instead of floating above a flood and using his friends' corpses as rafts to survive, he sacrificed himself to keep his friends alive. When Yashiro claimed that ending Satoru would end the whole thing, he was wrong because every person with a spider web attached to them remained living.

TL;DR: Yashiro became obsessed with Satoru because of his ability to help his friends and because he knew Yashiro's true self. Unable to kill the only thing that gave value to his life, Yashiro is defeated by Satoru after tricking himself (Yashiro) into thinking that he (Yashiro) was in control.

I didn't read the Manga, so when that blue butterfly showed up I was like "SHIT SHIT SHIT,  HE MESSED SOMETHING UP, HE'S GOING BACK, FUCK WHERE'S AIRI? IS SHE OK? IS SHE DEAD?! NO!"


And then she showed up and I calmed the fuck down

*gasp*

Now that his memories are back Satoru is in the OP again where he belongs.

Satoru's friends are the ultimate bros. 15 years and they still want to help him out.

Sachiko is still a Yokai. She knew all along. Sachiko is best mom.

Graffiti of the OP song is a nice touch.

Despite some flaws this show had I think that's pretty much the perfect ending this show could have.
>> ARTICLE
Okay so! I loved this ending, great anime, totally gonna buy it when it gets dubbed and sold over here.

But: Why does everyone say Airi is now 21? Originally she was at most 18 when Satoru was 29, then he woke up when he was 26, and while I know time passed, I didn't know it was like, a whole six years! She's still had that pizza job the whole time?

Also, I was really shipping Satoru with Misato (the girl who framed Kayo in the paat?) when they met with everyone else. He was blushing quite a bit, and the fact that she tried so hard to help him way back when gives me the vibe that she may have had a crush on him, and when he went missing his friends still brought her into the group, and I dunno, but for some reason I could see them possibly getting together. Admittedly I think I just have an issue with Satoru x Airi because of my own limited age range with relationships, which is why I keeo seeing them as just being great friends. (I mean, he wasn't blushing when he met her under the bridge, I think he's just really grateful for her help and for who she is as a person) though apparently the manga ships Airi and Satoru more?

Final statement! Anyone notice the girl from the other school who he helped save, and who got along well with the bigger kid with brown hair, was sitting next to the glasses kid when they were at the bar, and in the photo, had a hand on his back/shoulder? Did she end up with him instead after all of this time? Maybe she's not with any of them, or still with the other guy but he was just in the center of things a lot so she was just hanging back, and she's close enough with everyone that the hand on the shoulder thing is just a casual getting closer for a photo thing, but my desire to ship everyone wants to know!
>> ARTICLE
As someone who hasn't read the manga I loved the way Airi and Satoru met up at the end. The fact that they were separated and united under the same bridge is a wonderful piece of art(sorry it's 3am i can't think of a better way to phrase it.) 

I also rather liked the fact that they were essentially meeting for the first time when Satoru was at his best(fufilled and happy) as opposed to in the original timeline where they are both working dreamless jobs

>> ARTICLE
While I don't disagree with people who find the ending weaker than the overall show, it was a fun ride overall.

It's not that the ending is bad, IMO, it's just not as good as the Kayo subplot was.  It's an odd case with Erased where the subplot of saving Kayo was just more engaging than the overall "stopping the serial killer" story was.  That subplot eclipsed the main plot and took up enough of the show that I think a lot of people (myself included) forgot that it *was* a subplot at time.  So once it resolved, it left the show in a weird place dramatically.

Not only did the ending episodes feel weaker, but the "interlude" in the present before Satoru goes back a second time also felt weaker.  Again, I don't think that's because these episodes were *bad* per se, just less good.
>> ARTICLE
Wish they explained more about the revival thing and also how Satoru got out alive from the car. Great first 9 episode last 3 weren't as good. Overall nice series.

I watched the whole series all in one sitting today and overall definitely loved it. 

But I do agree with all the people saying they liked the save-Kayo story more than the overarching murder mystery. I'm not sure what it is exactly I just really loved the interaction between Kayo and Satoru, especially seeing her grow from emotionally null and empty to being a bright and happy 5th grade girl.

Also I'm super salty the writers weren't team Kayo and she married friendo. All that build up and I'm just crushed.

What was I doing at 1:30 in the morning when I have to get up early? Watching the awesome finale of my favorite anime series! The ending was so good and amazing I almost cried and no anime/video game has made me cry.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really like the idea that Yashiro couldn't live without Satoru, it didn't really make sense to me. Yashiro was a psychopath, he shouldn't have any emotional attachments? Or did he want to be saved from himself? It was all a little hard to understand. Also I liked Airi turning up but I wish they built her character up a bit more. I feel like I barely knew her throughout the whole series so the reveal of her appearance didn't really have an emotional effect for me. 
>> ARTICLE
>  Yashiro was a psychopath, he shouldn't have any emotional attachments?

There's an old humm ... meme or concept I guess: if you obsess over something then you can't help but love that something.

He's a psychopath but also obsessive over making his world-view and perception work.  When little kid Satoru does the unimaginable and then says "I KNOW UR FUTURE", Yashiro can't let go -- what Satoru did and what he says erodes Yashiro's worldview and his perception of everything.  He's obsessed about figuring out *why* and completing his story.  Problem: kid ends up in a coma.  So, he spends 15 years looking at this kid and obsessing over him.  After living 15 years of his life centered around this kid's existence, how can he live without him?

Imagine that you were watching an anime series.  That you really really liked.  That was really awesome.  Then: cliffhanger.  **FUCK**.  But, the show will continue next season.  So you follow it and wait to resolve the cliffhanger.  But the S2 gets delayed.  Again.  And again.  15 years later you've been following the S2 rapidly every season (because you're an obsessive psychopath and this cliffhanger is really fucking important to you).  After S2 comes out, the waiting and wanting and obsession itself becomes an empty hole in your life, since they're now gone.

Edit:  There was that notion of "post anime depression syndrome".  Imagine having that x100.  Your life is empty and you won't recover after 24 hours.  That's the future Yashiro was looking at.
>> ARTICLE
Surprisingly enough I haven't seen anyone mentioning it, but is it implied Satoru's time travel powers were given to him by God/Buddha as some 'final opportunity for salvation' for Yashiro, as a parallel to the spiders string in the fable? 
Just realising that made the episode for me.
>> ARTICLE
Beautiful anime, beautiful ending. Unlike in the first timeline, Satoru has tons of friends, everyone is safe, justice was served to the killer, and Satoru got to live his dream of being a manga artist. It couldn't have ended better.
>> ARTICLE
The air cushion Satoru's friends used to save him resembles a lotus from above, so it has symbolic meaning.
>> ARTICLE
Airi YES!
>> ARTICLE
Wow. Wow. Wow. This was an *amazing* ending. The show had its ups and downs, but man the ups were really something. The show really drove home this motif of believing in others. Even though Satoru lost 15 years, he wasn't really living in the life he had before, so his current loss isn't that bad in comparison. But he finally had close friends, a good relationship with his mom, a successful career-- everything he could have ever wanted. All because he never stopped believing-- I love the last line of the show. The Kayo ship sunk sail but now I firmly believe Airi best girl :)

There's this interesting connection between hope and "digging deep." If you live life without ever believing in others, you're not going to believe in yourself either. And if you don't believe in your self, you just try to survive one day at a time, not really engaged with anything. It shows in your job, your friends... well, everything really. But when Satoru decided to believe and start to trust others, things changed. Every day was new and exciting, every moment he had with friends was special.

Sometimes I feel like I'm living my life like Satoru, not really trusting people enough to have anything beyond surface-level interactions, and subsequently not having many friends. I feel like I too live life day-by-day, never truly engaged with other people. And for me, this ending was really inspirational.
>> ARTICLE
Probably my favorite of the season.  Also like Rakugo and GATE, buuut, I always wanted to watch the next episode right when it came out for this one.  Personally I think the show was best during the saving Kayo arc, but didn't dislike the ending.  Airi seemed a little like an afterthought, seeing as she was barely part of the story, but she's 'ight :P

Did anybody else have a moment of panic when Satoru was framing Airi with his hands and the flash went off?  Thought it was a muzzle flash at first and was bout to be hella confused because the MC just got shot dead killing the happy ending lmao.  Maybe just me.
>> ARTICLE
I had to hold back the tears at the end of this show. I'm not an emotional person but wow was this series so good. It played with my emotions each week but had so much deeper meaning and foreshadowing. This was probably one of the best animes I've ever watched. My brother and I have been watching this separately so I'm excited for his reaction too. He started late and watched 6 episodes in one night... He was so addicted like I was!! But one of the best parts of this series was the people in this sub. I've enjoyed reading the many discussions and it was a joy each week to come here. <3

So what if their wasn't much mystery to this show?  I absolutely loved it!  Sure, it was pretty easy to pinpoint it to the teacher but everything else was top notch.  I loved watching the MC's journey, the experiences he gained with the people he saved and friends he gained, I loved the look of the show and it had me glued every Saturday after work.  Sadly it couldn't quite reach perfect status for me but I'm still giving it an easy 9 out of 10.   Plus, it's the only show this season I watched the OP in full every new episode :).  Small question though:  did he go through another revival to go back to his kid years and get more friends, etc?  Quite confusing jump for me from his post coma justice to all of a sudden being a kid and meeting all of his friends in the classroom like the whole murder mystery timeline didn't happen....  Of course there's the good possibility that I'm a tad bit stupid :/ lol.

EDIT:  Looking through the MAL reviews and damn, guess this show has it's haters.  Eh, everyone's different.  A little surprising though?

I really enjoyed this series near the beginning but I ended up fairly disappointed. Even early on I was a little nervous that the show wasn't really spending much time building up its characters and that ended up really hampering it once the mystery element was exposed. I know it comes down to personal preference, but I honestly didn't find any of the characters memorable or noteworthy in the slightest and the story ended up feeling a bit hollow by the end as a result. On the other hand, the animation was very pretty :)
>> ARTICLE
Im pissed that Satoru didnt end with Kayo and that I dont get to find out how Satoru survives, pls

I rarely comment anywhere. I'm more of a reading, upvoting kind of guy. But I haven't seen anyone bring this up so I guess that guy is dead now! \_()_/


At first it seems that everyone have benefitted from Satoru's Coma Timeline (SCT).
He gets the bad guy! Along with his friends! Who are all successful and happy! Hell, even Yashiro couldn't bring himself to murder anymore! (Or have I misread that bit?)
But Satoru's mother, Sachiko, has had her life completely ruined. She quit her news job to manage her time around the care of her vegetative son, who might never wake up.
That woman sacrificed everything she had, everything she was, out of the love she has for her son. It's a shame (in my opinion, anyway) that the show (and Satoru) hadn't addressed that.


I really loved Sachiko. You rarely see a character like her anywhere, let alone anime. She's an older woman, a mother, but she's not some cardboard cutout for that type of character. You usually see that person in the background, meek and unobtrusive. Yet Sachiko is decidedly at the foreground. She helps her son, trusts his judgement and calls his bullshit whenever it arrives. She's very resilient, wickedly smart and wholeheartedly companionate. She's the real protagonist of this story.
Rock on, Sachiko!

This the end of such a treasure of an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like we got a different ending from the comments section, which kind of gives me hope when I start the manga for this show now.

My thoughts though, this anime was really, really good for a seasonal show. She had everything from an interesting premise, story, characters, deep monologues, sort of interesting villain, music, looks, and was one of the real notable shows from this season standing beside Haikyuu and Konosuba in their respective categories.

Satorou is a really good MC, and I think he could fit the plain guy archetype, but hes made into a really interesting guy with a story to follow. I feel like the show did a lot with what it had, but I think a lot more of it could've been conveyed better if it was not limited to 12 episodes. It got its point across, but stuff like the importance of some side characters as well as a more in depth understanding of the Yashiro as a villain would've been appreciated. I also think I read that the whole mystery of whodunit was better in the manga because all the hints didn't exist to point straight at Yashiro..

Anyways, main point is Mom is wonderful, story was really cool, and MC succeeded in his endeavor.

But I'll talk about this conclusion, because an ending will always be super important to me for these types of shows. Like figuring out the proper way to end your story is something that separates a great show from a masterpiece in my mind. And I think this show dropped the ball a bit. 

I expected a much more climactic ending with Yashiro and Soutarou having their back and forth on the hospital rooftop. Both players seemed to have prepped for that moment, but Yashiro was given the upper hand. That is until Satorou convinces Yashiro that he was the reason for Yashiro to live similar to the hamster story from one of the previous episodes. I never fully got to understand Yashiro's psyche from the anime's portrayal for any number of reasons that I won't go in-depth about, it might be my fault or the shows, can't say for sure. But the whole resolution to Yashiro's downfall this episode didn't make much sense to me and I didn't really understand how Yashiro found his happiness through their whole back and forth. It still finally closed the case, and then we got the epilogue.

All the characters come back in their older forms and Satarou is a mangaka. Seemed out of left field, but the scenes afterwards gave a sense of justification, because you see all the lives Satourou saved and how they're all happy including himself. But, I'm left thinking to myself, when will Airi show up again for her turn? Or the mom for that matter I think... Main point is near the end, Satourou is under the bridge from earlier episode and sees a blue butterfly which to my understanding represented his power (which he lost), and then leads to Airi poppin out of nowhere and greeting a tearful Satorou. I was looking forward to Airi's reappearance, but honestly not like that. It really felt like they just shoved her into the end, and it made me realize how little the show seemed to have built the relationship between her and Satourou for me to believe in his emotional response to her showing up.

I thought it was actually kind of weird, especially because Airi shouldn't know anything about Satourou in this new world right? I was kinda taken aback by that, but at least Satourou is happy? I guess?

Main point is really good anime, like REALLY REALLY good anime. God damn I love the opening and ending songs for this show, I play'em a crap ton on youtube. 

Point is throughout this show, being left dying of cliffhangers each week, I would've happily given this show a 10/10. But after this finale, I started to become aware of the elements this show couldn't properly pull off such as side characters, focus on story, and shoehorning Airi in at the end. It didn't feel like a FMA Brotherhood, but more like an FMA Conqueuer of Shambala. The conclusion wasn't amazing, but what is really important to understand is the show attempted to conclude itself, and not going for some open-ended or complete bullshit of an ending *cough* Akame Ga Kill *Cough*

This was an alright ending and even though I was left with a decent amount of complaints, I still can't change my thoughts that this anime was really really great. Based on MAL, I'm giving it a 9/10. but if I could it'd be a 9.5/10. I hope next season's show will have something that can match Erased in terms of show value, because this was definitely a show worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
yeah that part did feel that way but at the same time how would she be involved in this new timeline? he never met her and while he has memories of the time they spent together it doesnt involve her in the main plot. 

honestly that scene was just there to show that shes still important to satoru and he now can move forward by meeting her again without having "revival" to help fix mistakes.

>> ARTICLE
>  I never fully got to understand Yashiro's psyche from the anime's portrayal for any number of reasons that I won't go in-depth about,

My take is that Yashiro had a twisted obsession.  Satoru was a bizarre anomaly beyond what he could understand.  Then, he spends 15 years looking at that anomaly.  If you spend the greater part of your life looking at something, he no longer knows how to live without Satoru.
>> ARTICLE
You should definitely read the manga. Yashiro's full backstory is even more disturbing, which is why I love the character so much. In other shows, the killer has some sort of arbitrary reason haphazardly slapped on by the creators to get viewers to like it. In the manga, you can tell that this guy is just operating on a different wavelength, and that's all there is to it.

A word of warning though, the manga is a lot more meaty than the anime. If you thought the pace of the anime was slow, the manga is even slower, so it takes quite a bit of patience to let the good stuff come.

Well that ending was cheesy, but cute. At least it had a conclusive ending unlike a lot of anime now. Solid show overall, 6.5/10.

I think I'm going to rewatch the show from start to finish before giving it a score, as some of my memory of earlier episodes is a mix between overhyped and dissenting comments and the bits that I remember working really well, but without a true picture of the flow of the show.

Overall I actually quite liked the ending, I thought they were almost going to the Naruto route and have Yashiro realise what a fool he's been a end with him breaking down in tears, so the double suicide was a good route to take.

There were some parts rushed through the final 3rd, losing Yashiros complete backstory does leave a lot of his motivations lost to the aether but the key points are there. I'm also glad the show didn't pull any bullshit, no use of powers to win, no suddenly getting up and kicking the shit out of him; instead we got a mental battle in which the two parties clashed in the only way they logically could have. 

Is it anime of the season? no, that spot is exclusively reserved for Haikyuu! Season 2, by a pretty wide margin. But for a show that is based on such a supernatural deus ex machina power, the plot never entered that realm, I no matter my overall opinion on the show, that is worth some praise.

Final word, I absolutely loved the shot of the butterflys (probably moths but well ignore that) in the death in the light cover, that was a great way to show the revival power won't be used in this last exchange. 
>> ARTICLE
I find it fascinating that everyone seems to be loving a show but when the final episode airs all this negativity shows up.

Show told a good story in an interesting way with a satisfying conclusion. I have to say the whole coma angle was very original to the narrative structure, and I think it played with that in an original way. I say good ending.

They never told us how Satoru survived.

If pedoserialkiller-kuns reason for stopping killing was Satoru, what was his reason the first time around?

~~Did Airi disappear from this new reality?~~ nvm, at least that was nice. 

That whole ending was a mess. Sad end for a show that began with so much promise. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking sensei saved him after Satoru yelled out "I know your future" and came up with a good lie about how he found him and what not since no one else knew where or what he was doing. I haven't read the manga so this is all just conjecture.

As for why he stopped killing in other timelines? I don't think he did. He was a master of cover up, that's why mom died in original timeline. This new timeline though he was just so focused on having a rival and figuring out why this rival knew him so well, that he felt complete and didn't feel the need to kill for so long.

Also, a lot of people are upset that Airi didn't have a bigger part but I think the way they handled her was pretty good. He remembered the past timelines and remembered that Airi was part of them and she helped him immensely. If she showed up while he was in the hospital or whatever people say she originally did, I don't think it would have flowed or fit into this anime very well. Popping her in at the end was nice. It means Satoru has a chance with her because the past has a way of catching up to the future, and so their relationship is still very possible.

I'm really into character dramas. And this is what the anime was so it's a 10/10 for me. Not messy at all!

I don't know if ANYONE had similar feelings, but I did want to comment that I like how he didn't end up with Kayo.  So many stories can end up feeling like "Protagonist saves the girl so protagonist 'deserves' the girl".  The person being rescued ends up feeling like a prize for the main character for their hard work, not, you know, a person.

He saved Kayo not so she could pay him back by becoming his waifu, but because he rewriting the injustices of the past to save himself and his own childhood and ultimately because it was the right thing to do.  His reward for the actions he took was knowing that he gave Kayo a life.

The main point is that *it was never about it*.

Yes, the guy has a supernatural phenomenon happen to him, but no old sage taught it to him. He wasn't apparently born with it. He didn't gain it in a life-threatening accident.

The story was about what he *did with it*

That was...such a great ride.

Last few episodes notwithstanding, it still gets a 10 from me.

The number of times this show squeezed my heart, drew my tears and moved me to rage were too many to count.

Some might say I'm overrating it. I don't care. This one deserves overrating.
>> ARTICLE
I personally disagree with the 10 but it's your choice so I'll respect that.


Although I'm not a fan of using the argument that something "deserves overrating". I think your 3rd line *should* be enough to explain why you gave it a high rating.

Oh, you really shouldn't mind my rating system. My middle range is 7 :D

This anime ended in disaster.

And it wasn't for the reason everybody initially thought.  Everybody initially thought that it was going to be a disaster because of the sheer number of chapters that the story had to cover.  They thought it would be rushed.

However, as the manga became more translated, it became apparent that the ending *just kind of sucked*, in and of itself.  The emotional grist of the story was saving the kids in the past, and then it turned into this.

The final plotline and confrontation reeks of being farfetched.  
The roof scene was absolutely terrible and I burst out laughing at how far-fetched everything was.  

[This scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofQ6i9I1IYY) from Dumb & Dumber pretty succinctly describes the problems with this whole plan.  What was their plan if he just started knifing him or just tossed him off the building elsewhere?  It was seriously a shitshow and it was genuinely funny.  

The also did the Airi ending, but it didn't have any impact because they left out the build-up that was shown in the manga.

>> ARTICLE
The reason they didn't need to plan for any other eventual death scenario was because Satoru had determined that Yashiro could have killed him at any point in the past 15 years, and didn't. Yashiro doesn't want to kill Satoru until he understands him. Satoru had all the power in that situation on the roof, and he knew that. He played Yashiro for a fool until the very last moment.
>> ARTICLE
And the chances of him trying to knife him there are extremely low anyway, considering it would undermine his efforts to set him up for the girl's murder.

It's really amazing how [Sachiko always seems to know](http://i.imgur.com/HKbeZjK.png) what Satoru is thinking.

While the mystery elements of Erased were somewhat hit and miss, the characters, visuals, and music was really fantastic. At the end, Satoru was able to save everyone and his reaction to finally meeting Airi again was really something.

It had a really strong start but didn't finish quite as well but it was still really really enjoyable in my opinion and that was way more than I can wish for from shows nowadays considering how so many of them just become complete dogshit at some point. Here's to hoping that A1 pictures delivers more shows like ERASED in the future and less VN harem adaptations.
>> ARTICLE
One of the best anime of this season. I just loved it. I truly did. Amazing. Speechless..
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people are saying that the show was eh, but I really enjoyed how they wrapped it up. If you look at it from a perspective of having only 12 episodes, they fit it all in pretty dang nicely. The arcs were each given enough time, and each episode left you wanting to watch the next right away. 

However, I will say that if the series was given 24 episodes, it would've been even more outstanding. Apparently a lot was left out of the manga that could've been placed into 12 more episodes. As for the final episode itself, I seriously enjoyed the ending. Satoru, even if he didn't end up getting shipped with Kayo, ended up having a great future. Contrasting from the first episode where he was pretty miserable (failing manga artist, no friends, etc.), he really did find happiness. I also had a definite feeling that Airi was going to show up somewhere, and they placed it in at a nice time for the readers to interpret what happens in the future (Also loved how they introduced her with the butterfly. Great touch.)

There's a lot more I could critique or comment on, but overall I'd give the series an 8.5/10. There were tons of heartwarming, tearjerking, and generally emotional moments that defined Erased's anime adaption to be really enjoyable, and you can't really argue against that. 

Now onto the manga!

[Random Plane Flying Sideways](https://gfycat.com/ColorfulPleasingCockatoo) What kind of future did they end up in with planes flying like this!?!?!?! xD
>> ARTICLE
What a show!

Loved every episode. The art, voice work and direction is fantastic. The story though odd at times was strong and well told but for me the best part was the charterers their motivations and interactions.

The first five or so episode are the strongest but that makes sense since its the time we new the least. The emotions the show managed to pull out of me was insane by the end of a few episodes i was in tears. 

The one part that sticks with me is the feel of the show, the calm gentleness mixed with moments of terror and pain. The were things it didn't shy away from showing, the abuse dealt out was hard to watch. 

The only thing that confuses me is why did they change the English name to Erased?
>> ARTICLE
Everything about that roof scene was retarded. 

Playing the ED during the finale does not make a good or satisfying ending. It's so cliche by now that it's annoying. They somehow managed to make me hate this great ending song.

Also I lowkey wished he would have told at least his mother or Kenya: "um ye m8s im from the future and im actually a 30 year old man n shieet" 

Come on, those reveals are so cool and yet, he only told his evil gay teacher about it.

WAIT WAIT WAIT HOL UP! HOLD UP! Nevermind guys Airi redeemed this show in its last moments. It's fine now.

Everyone will ignore/hate you, but I just want you know that I think you're 100% correct. This anime had a lot of potential but the execution was godawful. It didn't know what genre it wanted to be. Romance? Sci-fi? Mystery? Just a clusterfuck. 
>> ARTICLE
The show started out great, kind of went to shit in the later half once Kayo moved away, but the ending was alright.

I was really excited to see Airi back. That was, for me, the show's saving grace at the end. I felt like it was good enough to sort of satisfy the romantic tension that they had been piling on Satoru throughout the entire show, which, to be honest, was much more interesting than the muder mystery aspect.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh I never really saw it as a murder mystery; it always seemed much more focused on the drama of the characters. Like how Kayo's mom always sees her abusive ex's eyes when she looks at  Kayo. But I was really excited to see Airi come back too.

iirc there was an interview with the director posted about a week back where the director said that it was really more of a drama disguised as a mystery.
>> ARTICLE
That's what it seemed like. I thought they did a good job going in that direction.
>> ARTICLE
so NOW they wrap this trainwreck up by saying that the teacher all of a sudden NEEDED satouru? first he was an annoyance, now something neccessary for him to live? satoru x teacher ship?since when and why does he need him? and he decied to wait 15  years when the mc couldnt do anything cause.. why ? half assed writing aint good.

and NOW they bring up the theme of believing in friends even though that had fairly poor theme exploration such as " i believe in you cause my parents divorced over a choclate bar" or some other half ass backstories. and lets not even go into the time travel powers, given to him by God to save his friends and noone else apprently and they disapear when the plot no longer needs it making the ENTIRE POWER a plot convience.lets not forget in the first timeline it is kinda explained he became jaded when he saw a near classmate of his die, so why is there this theme of beliving in friends? did he lose belief them? did they just stop being his freind over time? this story had a confusing and rushed as hell ending and tey have yet to explain the plot holes and badly written characters.

of course im going to get hated as per usual , but my prediction is that in a few weeks noone will give a damn about this show , and better yet , like zangu no terror , or danmachi, people will say it isnt good at all , only to be sucked in by the next overhyped anime of the season( im thinking my hero acedemy). so here it is again , badly written charcters with flip -flop motivations and goals. victimizing , forced drama and inconsistent time travel all make the meat of this , and the horribly written mystery and rushed as hell ending are the icing on the turd cake.whatever at least next season there will be jojo.

Actually jojo is going to receive more hype than boku no hero. Especially considering part 4 is hyped up to be one of the best.

I'm on lunch break at work and see next to the episode on crunchy roll -> (5 minutes remaining).. My god, the timing is incredible. Gonna be a long week after this one, I can already tell.

Now that the series is over I can watch the full thing without my heart failing from the cliffhangers I've heard about.

The most satisfying part of this show for me was him being reunited with Airi. There were a lot of cliffhangers throughout but wow did I hold my breath right till the end hoping they meet again.


It gave me such a wonderful sense of relief and fullfillment. Overall, I really loved this show as a whole. I guess out of curiosity I will check out the manga as well to see the differences.

So, what was the subjects of the manga parts they removed on the last 2 episodes if there's any?

I was a little disappointed by this episode as a manga reader, but that epilogue was much better than the manga. I always wanted to see what happened to everyone else and I'm glad to have gotten that. 

I would have like to give this show a 10, but the past two episodes were a little lackluster. I guess I can't see it in a different light knowing how it actually ends, but it was still a great show.

Well that was a pleasant ending. What a great anime. I guess some people are upset at the different(?) ending than what was in the manga, but I really liked it.

Man I put this up with ping pong in the satisfying endings that really cap off what happens to everyone. I was really wondering when Airi was going to come back during this whole episode and when it finally happened it was great. With the whole write his own manga thing it also really reminded me of samurai flamenco.
>> ARTICLE
This past week I read the manga for this. I'm glad I did just to see the little details that they skipped and where the story changes. I would recommend to everyone to read it, the manga has so many details that the anime had to skip over. The ending is different, yet similar. I honestly don't know which one I prefer.  
Something that the anime didn't specify is what Airi's dream is. Her dream is to travel Japan and take photo's, mostly of the sky. Also AIRI END. I'm really happy with that. Satoru and Airi are great. ^^^^Can'tTellWhoIShip

Edit: added a sentence
>> ARTICLE
Was super anxious to see if we were going to see Airi at all after the changes to the manga the show made, but I should've never doubted best girl. Still wish we got more screen time with her and I feel that cutting out her part in the final arc was a bit silly, even if it wasn't that big of a part to begin with. Final confrontation was a bit hammy, but it needed to happen in that way since it's the time we were given to deal with it.

Show started out excellently, and ended just a bit shy of great. Satoru, and honestly most of the main cast, being great characters is what I'll take away from Erased.
>> ARTICLE
A pretty feel good ending, I do feel like it could have been better somewhat. Then again i might just be bias because i wanted the kayo ship. I am so glad i gave this show another shot (i dropped it on episode one then binge watched it yesterday haha)
>> ARTICLE
So I enjoyed the show a good deal. The beginning was stronger than the ending, but I'd say it was still a good show. A lot of issues I see here seem to stem from it not following the manga enough, but watching the anime by itself I wouldn't have known I was missing out on anything without readings complaining the whole time. [The final scene was pretty sweet too](http://i.imgur.com/CAG8QTu.gifv).
>> ARTICLE
I loved it. I enjoyed the anime ending as much as I enjoyed the manga one. First part was obviously better but nonetheless it was an enjoyable 12 weeks.
>> ARTICLE
To be honest, I feel like the anime played to the strengths of its story more than the manga. IMO the manga sort of lost focus after the Yashiro reveal, almost like the author didn't really know how he wanted to end it. I feel like this ending had the same theme but did it in a way more focused way. On the other hand I think seeing Yashiro's backstory in the anime would have been nice.
>> ARTICLE
I got  hyped in the first episodes and then it went to a only good(almost mediocre) ending. I expected something much better
>> ARTICLE
Actually think the anime did a better job at the ending than the manga, though there were some parts about it that I wish were closer to the manga (Satoru's badass tackle and such). It showed Satoru relying on everyone instead of just Kenya, which I think fit better with the show's theme. My biggest disappointment is that Yashiro came across as a bit incompetent compared to his manga self, but oh well.

I'm a sucker for endings where the protagonist meets with everyone together again.

I think it was a great show, but maybe you need to have read the manga to fill in some gaps caused by the short length of the anime.

The only things I'm glad about is that Airi won and that Satoru is manga creator. Nothing more.
>> ARTICLE
It's a shame the show couldn't cover all the depth/events the manga did, but it was still a fantastic adaption. They got to the same ending mostly, just took a different way to get there. I prefer the manga I think but this serves as a condensed adaptation.

Pretty good show, though.
>> ARTICLE
That was so good! Holy crap, this show was fantastic. The writing, the cinematography, the character development... even a couple QUALITY moments (like that damn plane lol) didn't bring it down. I'm so happy this show didn't crash and burn on its final episode. 

In my book, it's up there with stuff like Madoka Magika as being a great short self-contained little show that pretty much anyone can enjoy. 
>> ARTICLE
I really do wish they explained why Satoru had the ability to use Revival. Literally any explanation probably would have been better than none. But other than that I thought it was great. 10/10 from me.
>> ARTICLE
I think it has to do with his regret over Hiromi's murder and Yuuki's incarceration. He wanted so *badly* to be able to save them that he somehow developed the ability. Even if that's not the case, *why*  he has Revival isn't important.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, I absolutely loved this show. I enjoyed every second of it. Been a while since a show has gripped me this much.

Easy 10/10 for me.

Edit: Also best girl end, can't go wrong with that.

Beautiful ending, loved how it went full circle. Definitely a pleasant surprise.

I liked it.
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga ending and this was done very similar. The events weren't the same but the theme was very much the same.. Overall I did enjoy the show, though the beginning was much stronger than the end. Still very solid and I think it did end on a good note. I do wish they showed Airi more though.

On that note, off the roller coaster and onto the [SS Aira](http://i.imgur.com/9j65f2g.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, the ending was definitely a mix for me. I usually read the comments after each Boku Machi episode and generally, since like episode 6, they started going downhill. However for me, I still thought it remained just as good of an anime until the end, despite people saying that it was just meh. The ending though.. the episode in general was a really cool one. It really had me hyped up when Yashiro looked down and Satoru winked at him, I was like DAAAAMN. I'm not sure why but after that, I was just kind of disappointed. I was definitely happy for Satoru becoming an accomplished manga artist but, I DON'T KNOW.. I feel like they could have used Airi more in the anime than just showing her in the beginning and the end. I didn't read the manga, but I heard it was a masterpiece. This anime is still very good in my opinion, but the ending just didn't sit right with me. Oh well, Airi x Satoru??

I think it's pretty obvious isn't it? She was the first person who believed in him even when all was against him. She did so much for him and she was the last person who was special to him to come back in to his life. All the pieces came together for Saturo.

[**tfw no bridge scene**](#crumblingdespair)

Enjoyed it though. It was a fun ride, nothing much else to say because I think the director did a really good job getting the major(and minor) points into the anime.

I like this version more than the manga. Although I want them to release a 2 or 3 episode OVA that has an alternate ending where Satoru ends up with Kayo. But at least I think people are less salty about the ship since we saw how everyone is happy after being saved.
>> ARTICLE
Really loved this show. The first 3/4 of the show and its build up made it very hard for the conclusion to live up to any expectations. I'll say this: I wasn't disappointed. 

Is it a masterpiece? I'll wait and let it sink in to answer that one. It's definitely in my own personal Top 5. Happy ending overall, job well done A1. Can't wait to watch the live action film.
>> ARTICLE
It wasn't incredible or anything, but I really liked the ending all the same, especially the whole bit where the pull the name back into it (incidentally making "Erased" an even dumber, meaningless translation than it already was, but that's not relevant). 
>> ARTICLE
I was actually expecting to be disappointed by it, but other than the fact that that they rushed Yashiro's deafet, I thought it was actually a really good ending. It tied up just about every thing pretty well and it was emotionally satisfying. I also liked that Satoru got something out of all the work he put in to save people. His life ends up being like 10 times better than at the beginning.

A good conclusion to a great show.
While the second half was a bit weaker than the first, I think the show was overall extremely well put together. 

I honestly think this is the best anime to have come out since 2013.

I liked the ending. I'll have to rewatch it to determine how I feel about Yashiro not being able to live without Satoru, but the rest all flowed well. I like how we got to see everyone grown up and ending with Airi was great.
>> ARTICLE
The ending was okay, I guess. I've read the manga beforehand, so I was wondering how the anime ending would be different (since they changed the confrontation part). They skipped a few memorable scenes like [manga spoilers](/n "the first time Satoru wakes up from his coma and meets Airi"), but overall, I still liked it. Not the best, but still something to watch before the spring season starts a.k.a. hype season. 
>> ARTICLE
You know, I like Airi, and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't she like 13 to his 25?  Shipping that one is a little awkward, don't you think?

Not to mention that in this timeline he doesn't work for the pizza place so she has no reason to hang out with him and get to know him.

I was going to produce so much salt, but they were right: NEVER STOP BELIEVING.

And Airi appears in the final scene.

Can manga reader list out the difference between anime and manga ( also live action if you watched it)?
>> ARTICLE
To be honest I really liked the anime's end.

In the manga the ending was pretty much anti-climatic and kinda "average". In the anime you see a deeper connection and simpler explanation of Satoru's and Yashiro's relationship. In the manga it really felt like an unnecessary and forced final face off.

I can understand why a lot of people got disappointed by the lack of "mystery" in this show, but I was really interested in the psychological aspect of it which I found refreshing, where it was more about winning a duel rather than learning each other's identity. 

>> ARTICLE
Solid 9/10 from me, although the ending was different from the manga, and nothing was necessarily lacking, it was just an all - around really good show.

**^^^...pizza ^^^girl ^^^best ^^^girl**
>> ARTICLE
At the end, did anyone else cry whenever they saw Airi? ; _ ;

Also, I was wondering if Airi's dream career/job was [Erased](/s "photography, because we saw her taking pictures before heading to Satoru.") Ever since she declined to tell him in episode 1, I've been wanting to know what her dream was. Another question I have [Erased](/s "is why the butterfly flew near him again. Was that just a pretense for Airi showing up?")
>> ARTICLE
I personally haven't read the manga and loved the ending. I am actually really happy I haven't read the manga, otherwise I would probably be complaining a lot right now.
Yeah, my fingerling feels hit me by the end, I cried a bit. One of my fav series this season ended
>> ARTICLE
Awsome! I actually liked this ending better than manga ending.

Though Yashiro could say that he was instead saving Satoru from falling but couldn't hold on to the wheelchair for long. That's what happened, sort of.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think the ending with Airi showing up is too strange, considering the place under the bridge was Airi's "special place".


>> ARTICLE
Well I for one close-to-loved the ending. I understand now that this was a drama disguised as a mystery, which can be polarizing to some people who wanted more mystery. I believe this combination was executed rather well, and am very much in the camp that Yashiro being the killer was perfect more for a psychological drama than a psychological mystery. You didn't want it to be him, for a while you were sure he couldn't be, then you realize of course he was.  
  
I'm giving it a 9, simply because the overall execution of this story--one that isn't all that new--was golden. The ending was softer than the rest of the show, but I think that's just a testament to what we all usually expect from shows like this. We wanted a "Errrbody daaayed" ending, or at least something like that.   
  
And I agree, Airi was underutilized in the second half, but where would she have fit in after the future changed and the coma, I just don't know. I see her as an emotional catalyst of sorts more than a love interest. What we do have works well, so I feel comfortable with a 9. On to the next tearjerker!
>> ARTICLE
This series was awesome, I'm going to remember this anime! One thing I didn't understand was the thing with Airi's mother, who was in the hospital visited by the reporter, I think? They made her look important but in the end, she wasn't involved at all? Am I missing something here? Captains?

EDIT: Never mind, rewatched it and finally understood it, she pretended to be Airi so that the real Airi could sneak out.

Couldn't Satoru pull more belt, drag it through the buckle and free his legs?

This is how a seatbelt locking mechanism works.
http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/seatbelt-rocker.gif
(left is front of car).
Now once the car is in the water, the front is lower than the back
so the seatbelt feed is locked.

>> ARTICLE
Imo considering how much effort Yashiro put into dragging Satoru into his trap (perfect timed laxatives and food order) I just assumed the seatbelt was sabotaged enough so you can't pull more.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I don't blame him, in a situation like that you probably can't think straight. The adrenaline rush and fear sets good conditions for something like shown in this scenario.
>> ARTICLE
It's likely that it was sabotaged. You know those crappy seat belts that lock too quickly? Well it's likely that he made it so it locked into the roller, and he couldn't pull more.
>> ARTICLE
He [leans forward](http://i.imgur.com/fTfHbRW.png) to get the candy. Clearly the roller hasn't been tampered with and there's more than enough slack there for even an adult to slip out. The only argument is panic which I simply didn't buy into.
>> ARTICLE
That could still be true. We can go with a reasonable seatbelt idea. I know when I was a kid, whenever I leaned forward too fast in a seatbelt, the seatbelt would retract into a locked position with no pull at all. The only way I was able to undo it would be to unbuckle, but Satarou couldn't because Yashiro was a butthole
>> ARTICLE
He leant forward to open the car's drawer, so I don't think so.
>> ARTICLE
That's all I was thinking the whole time. Honestly it distracted me pretty thoroughly from the drama.
>> ARTICLE
Right? I mean, he knew it was not going to unbuckle... He pretty much acted like a kid, not like a 29yo...

Sensei why?!
>> ARTICLE
Guys. The man had Hella candy in his car. Of course he doing weird shit with kids. 
>> ARTICLE
But they played him off as a red herring so well.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was never about *who* the killer was, but how he did it or how it would be revealed. Satoru dancing around all the clues of the one clear suspect was really entertaining, particularly in the last couple of episodes.

And honestly, I think the way it was delivered to be perfect, masterful. They didn't try to make a big deal out of the obvious reveal for us like most stories, but a slow and hesitant realisation by Satoru while the teacher is being as clear as day for us. They avoided the "lame, I had this figured out long ago..." and created an amazing scene, and the tension on Satoru was palpable.
>> ARTICLE
They played us like a damn fiddle!
>> ARTICLE
I know! But he played it off so well, especially by eating some right at the moment he found Satoru by the bathroom. I was almost convinced right there.
>> ARTICLE
EXACTLY. 

Beginning of the episode, when I saw the teacher looking at Misato walking alone in the hallway. I suspected him. Especially when he looked back and saw Satoru and his friends.

But then they went to the stadium and the teacher was all "you guys can have dinner! :D" and the Misato was wayyyy on the other side.

The final thing for me not to suspect him was the fact he walked into screen with the candy and I was like "Aight pretty natural, since shit was explained last episode too. He's totally not the culprit" Plus it was Satoru who asked sensei for help.

Then we get into the car and Satoru got helped into the seatbelt, and I was like "nooooo"(felt a little suspicious but brushed it off), then the compartment with no candy "Nooooo", then "it's not my car" "NOO!", then the explanation of the plan "The laxative for the girl to go the bathroom, the Truck from me ordering the dinner, telling your friend about the game, so you would know" "OH MY FUCK THIS GUY."

then silence as watched the rest not wanting to miss anything else......
>> ARTICLE
Hell, I was completely convinced there was no way he could be the killer...
>> ARTICLE
And that's where they get ya.  The elusive double-troll!
>> ARTICLE
The film reel that symbolized Satoru's memories got cut, and the lights shut down.

Concentrating so much on Sachiko and his friends saying goodbye watching him go... saying "We'll see him tomorrow...", that was a huge death flag wasn't it?

>Concentrating so much on Sachiko and his friends saying goodbye watching him go... saying "We'll see him tomorrow...", that was a huge death flag wasn't it?

Retrospectively yeah it is but you could make out anything to be a death flag if you look at it retrospectively.
>> ARTICLE
It seemed like a death flag to me when I was watching the scene first time, but I didn't think he would actually die. I expected more like a "back to the future" climax with him losing the girl to the killer.

When I saw the basketball I was expecting a 

"1v1 me Satoru, for your life!"
>> ARTICLE
Yeah seemed a bit random of a tool to use. 
>> ARTICLE
And he bloody shoved that basketball on the gas HARD, that would jolt the car above anything else...
>> ARTICLE
well in order to perserve the whole 'accident' angle he needed to use a object that wouldnt reveal this was staged.  a basketball is a object that would be in a car with a kid and if it was found floating around afterword no one would connect it to the accident. 
>> ARTICLE
I mean having a kid drown in an "unknown" car would kinda hurt the accident angle a lot but yeah I guess a basketball would help a little.
>> ARTICLE
well....its not like satoru has id. the car registration is not the teachers and since its a lake they would assume that the driver either ran away or died and floated to another part of the lake. since the teacher drove out of town police wouldnt recognize satoru and inform his mother. 


They would only send out a call about the accident and ask for information on a unknown kid. none of satorus friends or mother would connect his initial disappearance to the accident initially since there is no reason for him to get into a strangers car (at least until his friends inform his mother about their investigation.) 
>> ARTICLE
I thought Misato corpse was in the bag.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah when he said she wasn't in that other car I thought he was going to follow up with "she's in the trunk"
>> ARTICLE
Instead she was just in the bathroom with a severe case of the runs.

Saved I guess...?
>> ARTICLE
which is odd, because we clearly saw her going in there, Satoru did so aswell, why was he instantly convinced by yashiro?
That's what I don't get.

Nice touch, that he actually had a lollipop there as an "excuse" to come there, since in hindsight that whole substitute was a decoy nevertheless

From the scenes with Yashiro in the future, Satoru never gets a great look at Yashiro's whole face. He sees the grin and the eyes but the rest of the face appears to be hidden by the hat/arm.
>> ARTICLE
[deleted]
>> ARTICLE
If you take him at his word he's leaving town out of respect for Satoru's performance in their game. In the original timeline this didn't happen so he had no reason to leave.
>> ARTICLE
> Also, he said he was going to leave after he finished off our hero, but why didn't he leave town in the timeline where he committed his serial murders?

In the original timeline, there was almost no proof against him. In this one, he left much more trails. Alone by leaving the stadium, he would be much higher on the suspect list. After all, he suddenly dissappeared while he was planning on watching the students game. Also, someone must have seen Satoru there. Both disappearing shortly after each other would be suspect. Not to mention that the girl got given laxatives.
>> ARTICLE
Well I don't think Satoru ever really got a good look at the killer's face. He has glasses on in the "present" and constantly wears a hat or his face is turned in another direction.

Also just try thinking back 18 years ago. How clearly can you remember the face of someone that you knew back then if you haven't seen them for 18 years?
>> ARTICLE
Considering that most users from this sub are aged 19-20, it might be a bit hard for them to remember faces from 18 years ago.

The Yashiro reveal was extremely tense, creepy, and totally blindsided Satoru. While the clues pointing to Yashiro were present, Satoru had too much trust in Yashiro to notice them.
>> ARTICLE
In the ED [too] (http://imgur.com/lKMYxl5) there is foreshadowing.
>> ARTICLE
The ED is a masterful work of art.  Same peeps who did the Shinsekai Yori ED as well.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that it was *Satoru* getting killed also explains the significance of the Japanese title. It always puzzled me because the 'boku' in "Boku dake ga inai machi" means "I", but it is a pronoun used almost exclusively by boys or young-ish men. So the title is "The town in which only I (who is a male) am not"

All the would-be victims were girls, however, so how could that make sense? I wrote it off, though, because in poetry and song girls often use it as well
>> ARTICLE
> Satoru had too much trust in Yashiro to notice them.

I like the way that parallels the audience's "too much obvious" to believe that Yashiro would be the killer.
>> ARTICLE
Which was perfectly done. A friend and I were both of the mindset that if it does end up being the teacher, it would be stupid as fuck for being too obvious. But then Satoru goes and says it was obvious, but he didn't *want* to believe it. That's when I realized "oh shit, I didn't want it to be him either" which made the reveal actually really damn good.
>> ARTICLE
This is exactly how a friend and I saw it too. We didn't think it would be Yashiro because it's too obvious given what we know about the kidnappings and the clues everywhere. It wasn't until a couple weeks ago that we got really suspicious. All this week we were thinking "If it's him, we'll be surprised. If it's not him, we'll be surprised." 
>> ARTICLE
That OP is freaking chokeful of foreshadowing... I legit can't wait for a breakdown/analysis!
>> ARTICLE
The only thing left in the OP I think that hasn't been seen in the show is the shot of  flying past Satoru's head as he runs away on the roof of a building. The final confrontation maybe? 
>> ARTICLE
I think that it will be represented in the next episode episode. I'm thinking of it as Satoru dodging a bullet, not literally, but representing something like escaping death (not drowning in the car).

Edited: changed "tomorrow's episode" to "the next episode"

It's a red flag in hindsight but there are other ways to read the scene that are just as valid. I took it to mean that time-jumping, getting a second chance with his mom, and forging these personal connections made him really cherish his friendships. It could also be foreshadowing that Satoru was going to time-leap forward and not actually see his friends tomorrow (from his perspective).
>> ARTICLE
IT WAS ME, YASHIRO 

Congratulations Satoru, you've been played. But holy cow, what a tense moment in that car ride. 

That smile sensei puts on with the huge reveal is just so creepy, and well, fitting. The dude pinpointed who kept screwing up his plans. 

This is most definitely the pits for Satoru, to have come so far and then be so utterly trapped. Really tragic

By protecting his friends, he became the target himself.
>> ARTICLE
Not just them but probably his mom too. Could argue it was worth the trade off.

Of course it's not going to happen and the best case scenario would end with Yashiro not being able to go on to hurt anyone else. 
>> ARTICLE
Yashiro only said Satoru won peace for *this* town, so I'm sure he will go somewhere else and start killing people too. If I recall correctly, they even mentioned once or twice that kidnappings in other towns happened too, but then they caught someone so there was no long any suspect.

Nice work actually.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I didn't see it coming. There was a time where we'd suspected almost everyone, yukis dad, Kenya lol, kayos mums boyfriend seemed like it from the start, it was odd to have him there. The teacher became a suspect for a while but no more than anyone else. I wondered at his red eyes, his excuses at not helping kayo enough but the further time went the more his actions contradicted him being the killer, he helped satoru, helped save kayo. He won my trust, he was too obvious to be the killer and he was too contradictory in his actions. It had to be yukis dad, if his son didn't trust him he obviously wasn't a very nice person. They lured you into a false sense of security with the teacher and that's also exactly what the teacher did to satoru. It's brilliant. 
>> ARTICLE
Yuuji couldn't have been the killer, because Sachiko recognized the killer in front of the supermarket when Yuuki was still in prison.
>> ARTICLE
I feel that the anime made it way more obvious than the manga. They put all the visual cues here and there, that made it easier to spot than in the manga. I didn't suspect him while reading the manga.
>> ARTICLE
He was still in the short list of suspects just due to his general proximity. I always thought it had to have been a cop, politician or a teacher. A long shot being a parent or a friend to one of the kids' families. It would have been nuts if it was a kid doing that all though. Kenya still gives me the chills.

HE'S DEAD? 

WAIT

NO

WHAT?

He can't jump anymore if he's dead, right? So best mom's gotta save him or something. I need the rest of the episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I doubt Satoru would die for real. However, not only we didn't get the usual butterfly that heralds the revivals, but we also got the brilliant broken film reels atoms/star systems that dim to darkness.

At best the latter would mean that he only gets one more revival. However, no butterfly *suggest* he already ran out of revivals though.

It would be awesome to have the mother, and possibly Kenya, piece the puzzle together, but I seriously doubt we'll lose our MC. So I think either the teacher or someone else saves him (highly unlikely, though Sensei stopped at Satoru's saying he knows his future), or he gets one last revival.

If I operate under the assumption that we will get a happy ending, the last revival must be to his childhood. However, a sad or very bittersweet ending, which I deem highly unlikely, would involve Satouru exposing Sensei in the future, saving his mother and future victims, but failing to save Kayo, Hiyomi, Aya, and so on.

P.s. I just thought that the broken film might also represent how the two timelines are now separated. These all makes me wonder if we won't get any more Airi.
>> ARTICLE
My prediction is that Yashiro will actually save him.

The last thing Satoru yelled was that he knew Yashiro's future. I honestly think the temptation of that will be too much for the guy's ego and he'll pull Satoru out to know more.
>> ARTICLE
If he does that's really going to hurt my suspension of disbelief for this show... So far the teacher has been conniving and logical to a fault. If he does something so ridiculous as to save the one person that can ruin him just because a child yelled in his last moment he could give him a fortune like an old gypsy woman, I'm gonna call bullshit.  

He has no reason to believe that the kid *actually* can travel through time or see the future.  Unless other people can jump and they haven't told us that. 
>> ARTICLE
He's also *extremely* cautious for a serial killer. If that planted further seeds of doubt in his mind (Yashiro already has picked up on a few hints that Satoru is no normal kid), he might pull Satoru out to find out what he knows, thinking he can always still kill him later.

I was half-expecting him to do so before the end of the episode, as well. 
>> ARTICLE
I dunno though. He's very logical, and cunning, but he also is *very* emotional. His entire reason for killing is to "fill a hole". That's a "romantic", very emotional reason. They're executed logically but are crimes of passion. He's already shown anger by kicking the box in the bus, and he seemed genuinely interested in how Satoru knew what he would do.

I wouldn't put it past him to be crazy enough to really consider the possibility.
>> ARTICLE
Or he could pull on the seatbelt and wiggle his way out....seriously bro I didn't see Satoru enable childlock on the seatbelt.


At the very least I did that when I was in long car rides.

I'm pretty sure Yashiro sabotaged it so he couldn't pull it apart.  
Do you really think the fact that he had problems connecting it was a coincidence?

Actually, it's a reference to it, but it's *not* Kayo's title. This is something lost in translation.

The title of her story is "**Atashi** dake ga Inai Machi". (Atashi = female pronoun "I").  
The series is called "**Boku** dake ga Inai Machi" (Boku = male pronoun "I").

So the title is clearly referring to Satoru.

Alright, I can live with the sensei being the killer. I'd rather have something simple that makes sense, even if it was the easy way out for the writer. I'm curious to see what his motivations are. I hope they don't just say "he's evil so he kidnaps kids," but that's what I'm expecting.

That ending, though. I have no idea how Satoru is gonna get out of this one, unless he ends up going back to the future or something?
>> ARTICLE
No, the manga goes even deeper exploring his backstory. Basically it happened right after this event, so wait until the next episode. 

Be sure the check the manga though, if the anime decided to scrapped his story to fit in the rest of the story in the next 2 eps.
>> ARTICLE
oh no he specifically told us in this episode that he does things to fill his own soul. I guess he has issues with people who are perpetually alone (like him? idk) and feels like he needs to do something about it. If legal methods and moves don't work (he did seem to actually call child services in kayos case) he seems to go straight to kidnapping and murder. 

He only targets people who are mostly alone. kayos mom was abusive and she was a outcast in school. aya seems to have not many friends and is pressured by her family to excel in her studies (she reads king lear). Hiromi stated this episode that his parents are never home until much later and only hangs out with his group (though his death was to distract the police from the real criminal).


hell even in EP1 he targeted a kid who was apparently left alone in the store by her parents. The only reason he didnt actually take her is since sachiko saw him.
>> ARTICLE
He also mentioned good and evil ways do not matter, if the result is the same. 

It's likely he is very lonely and affected by an relationship ending, and went total batshit insane. He tries to use "good" ways to save people from loneliness when he can, and when it does not work, he "frees" the lonely people by killing them.

It came as a bigger shock to me in the manga, but it might've been because this is my second time experiencing it.

The moment he made that facial expression in the manga I was screaming full Office-style refusing to believe I just got tricked. While in retrospect it was obvious he was the killer, the important thing is I was surprised.
>> ARTICLE
Well, [they really had someone say "Keikaku dori" in this episode](http://i.imgur.com/N1d6S0m.jpg), didn't they? (TL Note: "Keikaku Dori means "Just as planned".)

This episode shocked and surprised me. No, not about the reveal, but about how it's handled. This show's music is done by Yuki Kaijura, and up to now when the show wanted us to feel the tension, or the mounting dread, it knew how to bring her signature style of music to bear for those moments. But this episode? When we've had the camera focus [on Yashiro's gloves](http://i.imgur.com/IrBZnvD.jpg), and then [on his tapping finger](http://i.imgur.com/4JyZsNL.jpg), and most of all after the "[After all, this is not *my car*" moment](http://i.imgur.com/6rvlePF.jpg), I expected the music to start wailing, but alas, it was quiet. Yes, we got a very muted drum beating after the last one, but it wasn't what I expected.

Yes, we had the dread mounting with the visual cues I mentioned above, and with the way the discussion went around the topics that the killer would have interest in, but that's what the manga has to bear. A lot of what made BokuMachi such a great production up to now has been exactly its attention to detail, with careful and beautiful shot-framing everywhere (speaking of which, [here is the weekly collection of important/beautiful shots](http://imgur.com/a/2KONw)), but this is all what the manga already had to offer - plot and visuals. Anime, aside from movement, has sound to play with, and this episode didn't do that, which I found unfortunate.

It's interesting to try and guess what's going on from a meta-production perspective, by which I mean, this episode really didn't *feel* like a climax. It wasn't as cathartic as Kayo's homecoming to Satoru's house sort of thing, and this show, well, it really *does* know how to pull cliffhangers, even mid-episode, right? So here we are, just seeing everyone else looking around, *together*, in the warmth. It feels almost normal. The only thought I'm having then is that this episode isn't actually meant to be a climax, but the climax is to come.

This sort of fits what I've said all along, that the show is a *thriller*, not a mystery. We've all "sort of knew" who the killer was up to now, because the show has been really unsubtle about it all along. So the reveal of the murderer's identity was never really what this was all about. What it's about at this point is two things: The first, the mounting dread as we see Satoru get into the car, and spend time with the killer. We can all see the noose, but he can't. That's a source of tension. The other is, what will Satoru actually *do* once he finds the killer? Now he found him (well, *sort of*!), so what will he do? And what about the present?

This episode felt sort of weak, and not just about Yashiro's villain face, but because it really did feel like the show could've made much more of it. So, this was a non-climax. Makes me really curious what the climax *will* look like, but still think that even if it's intentionally a non-climax, it could've done with a more dramatic delivery.

***

Theme-wise, this episode really started by hitting things right at the point I've been discussing all along, [of the twin themes of superheroes and naivete](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/02/18/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-7-innocent-and-childish-superheroes/) (or childishness), with [Aya telling them that](http://i.imgur.com/hQShFY6.jpg) they [are *playing* at being superheroes](http://i.imgur.com/PZMZrw5.jpg). And this episode was exactly proof of what happens when you play at it - there are repercussions. The theme of "The superhero's sacrifice" also came here, through Yashiro's mouth, as he's telling Satoru he won, but is also presenting him with the bill of saving everyone else - his own life.

And this is a common theme, to save everyone, you must give up your own life. [I mentioned it in last week's write-up](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-9-the-death-gods-wish/), how impossible it is to actually save everyone, to make sure absolutely no one is ever alone. Even trying will quite literally cost you your whole life, every single moment of it. And we can all think of stories, time-travel or otherwise, anime or otherwise, where the cost for saving one person is one's life, or at least one's happiness. Plenty of superhero stories are like this as well, with them ending up clutching the corpse of their loved ones, as they went to save the world. So, Satoru's getting a crash course.

Yashiro also pulled a very Joker / Samurai Flamenco moment, but again something that is quite common in superhero stories, especially in Batman's, the mirroring between superheroes and villains, though I think it could be applied to most people and most actions - actions that interact with others, actions that change our lot in the world, are all about trying to fill in the holes we're unhappy with in our own lives. And just as Yashiro went on to say, "The most enjoyable moment in our lives keeps shifting," there's always something else to chase - there's always someone else to save. Being happy, according to these two, is impossible, without paying the cost of one's own life. Or, the inability to be content is exactly the source of motivation. Which is almost a tautology. It's all about how you channel said motivation, and motivation is what Satoru lacked up to this point in his life. And here he regained it, by becoming discontent, and ended up paying with his life. If the show were to end here, the message would be, "Be content with your lot," but it's not over just yet, is it? Cause that'd be a terrible message, one to leave us rotting in our cubicles.

***

Two small asides:

1. I did like how Satoru spoke of turning Misato into bait, while Yashiro was the one who turned her into bait for Satoru.

2. [When Satoru said](http://i.imgur.com/IoYsAq4.jpg) his [very lengthy goodbye to his friends](http://i.imgur.com/Edk2qHx.jpg), with "See you tomorrow!", I did find it a bit silly, but their words later on made me realize what's going on ([and he later did](http://i.imgur.com/CGw37Iv.jpg) the [same with his mother](http://i.imgur.com/879hLHS.jpg)) - for him, each time he sees his friends, and his mother, [could very well be the last](http://i.imgur.com/VTg51iw.jpg). He doesn't know whether he'll get pulled back to the present, and thus not meet them again, perhaps forever in case of his mother. So he makes these goodbyes count.

I loved how Yashiro said something like [_Boku dake ga Inai Machi_ Ep10](/s "You have brought peace to this town to Satoru; the implication of the translation of the title is 'The town where only I am missing'; the 'I' of this title was once applied to Kayo's story, but now seems to apply to Yashiro as well: Satoru's actions has resulted in a town where Yashiro cannot be present. I wholly believed that the title referred to Kayo's story, but now I'm really enjoying the possible additional implications of the title.")

[That motherfucker](http://i.imgur.com/4QtpHFS.png)! While I did suspect Yashiro, the way the show played with him was quite good.

I've been calling out that shit tier Sensei for weeks now. I knew it was him, I FUCKING KNEW IT GOD DAMN IT.

SATORU WHY COULDN'T YOU SEE IT? YOU'RE TOO TRUSTING, GOD DAMNIT.

I mean real talk, it'd be really ballsy for Satoru to actually die, so I'm ok there, but I'll tell you what...

I was getting real in the moment of the reveal and then the show ends with that icy plummet. I lost my shit. Like, I'm glad nobody else was home right now, because I straight up screamed at my television for like a minute. I felt so much vindication knowing I was right about the fuckign teacher, but then watching the shock and horror fill Satoru's eyes as he came to the realization himself was too much for me. The moment the teacher buckled in Satoru's seatbelt had me too, because I had a feeling something was up right from that moment. 

I'll just wait another week to see what happens next I guess, I don't want to turn into one of those commenters who like to taunt people about manga spoilers.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry, but I refuse to believe that a small child like Satoru can't get out of a seatbelt by just slipping out of it while a tower of a guy like me (6"2', somewhat chubby at the side too) can easily get out of it.

that depends on the seat belt.

Actually, that's probably not true. This is probably what happened during the first jump timeline. Kayo was beaten and put into the shed after she came home from the birthday party, and this showing Yashiro finding her in the shed. 

It's heavily implied in the original timeline that Kayo is kidnapped from the park.

And the FUCKING RED HERRING IS NOT A RED HERRING?
If this sub can predict the killer by episode 4 (myself included) then you aren't a mystery anymore; you're just a fancy drama.


I'm pissed off...I can never identify the killer in *a mystery* show. I mean I thought the teacher was a red herring but the show doesn't give a fuck about giving any other suspect so of course the killer has to be him...AND I STILL said he was a red herring.


I hate this.


edit: Upon talking with another user, it's been clarified that this show may not be primarily a mystery and instead more of a psychological thriller which makes my 2nd sentence absurd criticism. That said I'm still pissed off about the mystery aspect of it since I expected it to play more of a central role rather than a backseat driver.

edit 2: Added in italicized adjective to clarify

I'm glad that the killer wasn't someone that came out of no where. Over the past couple episodes, Yashiro was the only real suspect remaining.

Yashiro was not on the previous suspect list shown in ep6 at 17:48. Did the show just cheat?

This is the reason why he killed Hiromi. By having all of his victims be girls, the police figured he only went after girls and thought Hiromi was a girl and killed him. Since everyone close to Hiromi would have known that he was actually a boy, they figured it was enough evidence to remove the teacher from the list along with a few others.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not talking about the final suspect list shown in ep6 at 12:12 but the previous suspect list shown at 17:48. Apparently we aren't shown the entire previous suspect list in order to hide the fact that Yashiro's name is on it.

While the teacher reveal isn't surprising, I was surprised that they revealed it before the final two episodes.

Also despite ending on a pretty big cliffhanger, I can't really feel tension due to previous events(the arrest) and the lack of rules regarding Satoru's power. At least in how the anime represents it. Not sure if his power is going to save him (or even more miraculously someone else), but I'd be very surprised if they decided to kill off the MC at this point.
>> ARTICLE
I have a pretty mixed up feeling about this episode. I was convinced 95% that Yashiro is the killer and before the episode is out, I though to myself, "man, it'll be pretty weak when Yashiro is pointed out as the killer, because it's predictable", but then BAM, the episode out and oh boy, how wrong am I, it's definitely not weak at all, it's pretty thrilling and good.

But still a little part of me is kind of wishing that all the previous episodes is not just to build up the tension and in the end the writer actually drown us with some twist (like, oh I don't know, make Sachiko's partner actually the killer or whatever) and some surprise.

But all in all, still a pretty good episode, my heart still racing from this episode.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not disappointed by the culprit being the teacher. In fact, I think the way it was handled seriously added to the dramatic irony that fueled the tension in the big reveal scene.  
  
The teacher was the most obvious suspect, but many dismissed him for various reasons, including being too obvious. Regardless, it was easy for us as the audience to see that trap coming as soon as it started. But Satoru sure as hell didn't.  
  
The tension in that scene came not from us wondering if Yashiro is about to spring a trap, but instead from us begging Satoru to figure things the fuck out before its too late. So when he falls for it, hook, line, and sinker, the viewer feels all the more helpless. We, as well as Satoru, were given all that we needed to reasonably guess the culprit from the start, and things still went wrong. I think it's pretty good writing, actually.
>> ARTICLE
We all knew that it was Yashiro but holy shit that ending was insane!
>> ARTICLE
Like everyone else here I didn't think it was Yashiro because it was way too obvious.

But as it went on I realized it couldn't really have been anybody else without it seem like they pulled it out of nowhere. I still think Kenya plays a bigger role in the end, hopefully it'll be to help out Satoru somehow.

Suspecting someone and then them actually being the killer is kind of bold for them to do. In fact, I didn't think they had the guts to flat out reveal this information so early. Yet it was done so perfectly and the scene with the film reels at the end was pretty cool.

I can't wait for the ending, but then I realize that it's going to be over soon... 
>> ARTICLE
I actually liked that it wasn't a "twist" for the audience but I loved how shocked Satoru was because he had never even considered it.
>> ARTICLE
Some people criticized the killer as "obvious". (He's been my prime suspect since the moment he appeared) But I dont think that makes it a bad mystery. The clues were all laid out, and as we follow Satoru, the killer lures him in closer to earn his trust. Every interaction this episode (and all the previous ones in retrospect) are tense and exciting. Which is more important than having a GOTCHA!-moment. 

It's a great reveal because it rewards the audience for figuring it out and our Main Character is blindsided by the betrayal.
>> ARTICLE
At this point I'll give the nod to it being a not-bad and possibly good decision to go with the teacher as the killer.  I feel like it's a reasonably good execution of a double fakeout -- the audience feels like he's "too obvious", but just like Satoru it turns out that what was obvious was real.  On one side it's "disappointing" from a mystery-theory perspective.  On the other side, it's fulfilling from a moral lesson and basic lesson -- don't ignore the obvious.  I think that Satoru's dialogue being a parallel of the audience in "reveal" scene helps the execution pull this off.
>> ARTICLE
The thing about mystery's is that you would typically have more than one suspect. It's a bad mystery because there's no suspense or worry about who is the killer; at this point it's more of a psychological thriller where the audience knows who the killer is and we are waiting to see how the MC will find out.

I knew this was coming if the hints were any indication but I just kept hoping my crazier theories about the killer being some future-Satoru or Glasses-friend might come through. Instead, now I'm just curious how this whole story moves on. Well played.

I mean the show didn't bother introducing anyone remotely close to being the suspect so at least they didn't pull some random twist.


I'm disappointed in the "mystery" aspect of the show surrounding the "who is the killer".
>> ARTICLE
I've always seen this more as a psychological thriller. There is not enough cast or unique VA in order to have the killer be someone else. Its the suspense and actions to that point that I've felt were amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it was quite obvious but at the same time I didn't see it coming. That was a nice reveal. I guess... ?
>> ARTICLE
Well, I think we all saw that coming. After all the red flags, it would have been an enormous ass-pull for anyone else to be the killer.

That said, I am convinced that he has at least one accomplice, and I'm nearly certain that it's Sachiko's reporter friend (I can't remember his name, and it's not on MAL). Here's my thinking:

1. Episode 1: When Sachiko returns to Satoru's apartment on the night of her murder, she places the note with her friend's phone number on a table by the door. When Satoru arrives, the note is on the floor by Sachiko's shoes, a place where it's certain to draw Satoru's attention. Maybe it just fell, but I think that Yashiro planted the note there so that Satoru would call the number for help if he's lucky enough to escape the police.
2. Episode 6: After Satoru meets with him, the reporter goes to visit Airi in the hospital only to find that she isn't there anymore. Later, shortly after Airi and Satoru meet, the police show up to arrest Satoru, having tailed Airi to find him. However, there's no way they could have known that Airi escaped the hospital without being tipped off. The hospital staff and the men stationed there didn't seem to notice that she was gone, so it must have been the reporter.

Of course, if this is true, it means that the reporter's claim of following the murders is just a cover, but a really clever one. Nobody would ever second guess it.
>> ARTICLE
nah  in both cases it showed him following them at both points. 

in EP 1 it showed him watching sachiko and satoru walking home with airi and in EP 6 it showed him watching airi when she escaped from the hospital (though in both cases it didn't show his face).
>> ARTICLE
God damn it. I was suspecting the teacher from episode 2. Now the dude is actually the killer??? What the FUCK it was so obvious.


I saw it coming 100%. It wasn't even a surprise. I'm actually disappointed for now. Hopefully the next few episodes have some sort of a twist or else I'm going to be a sad panda.

Edit: If it sounds like I'm madbro, I'm not. It's still a good anime, I was just hoping that there would be a twist to this mystery. However, starting at when the candy fell out of the dudes ashtray (or where ever it was) in his car, I started to think of who else could be a suspect. After thinking and looking back I figured it's most likely him, although the weird thing is. The killer (in the future) is suppose to be ~18 years older but appears to still be young. The killer also wears glasses, which the teacher does not. So I definitely want to see how the bastard gets caught and what happens after this. There's at least 20 other questions I have as well but 2 episodes cannot be enough time, right?
>> ARTICLE
We all **suspected** it might be him.Just so happens we were right.

Nothing to go ape-shit about if u ask me
>> ARTICLE
Yea, killer reveal wasn't very surprising [spoiler](/s "there's exactly one adult male in past time line, and he been suspicious for whole series") but gonna admit, whole episode was filled with tension and was very well done.  

It's bit sad though what there where was no "decoy" characters though, because once you start suspecting one particular person it became more of "how killer will change his actions in this time line?" then "who is killer?".

For those that are disappointed about the "big" reveal with Yashiro being the killer, think about the mentality you people are having before watching this episode. It would've been a lose-lose situation either way if the murderer wasn't the teacher. If it was something like Kenya, Future Satoru or some-other ass-pulled twist then I'm sure you guys would react to the episode even worse than it actually did. Why exactly? Because it wouldn't been logically believable and the episodes throughout the series had been set-up that way through the attention to detail that goes behind each clues from the character, environment and events. Through a rational standpoint, all logic eventually pointed to the teacher being the prime suspect. Sure the "mystery" aspect of the show could've been better, but that's the fate of Erased must face when the series is only 12 episodes long. So it was fundamentally doomed from the very start.

When I arrived at this episode, I didn't care whether or not the show would've been disappointing due to the actual reveal, but I focused more on HOW they handled the fact that Yashiro was the one behind this. And I thought they did this very well. The whole car scene was full of tension due to the claustrophobic nature of Satoru's position that he was in because he was helpless and at mercy to Yashiro. The only thing left for him was him facing a dangerous situation by being one-on-one with Yashiro and shockingly hear about his true personality and motivations. 

In summary, I still applied the logic that you know you're watching a good mystery show even when you know the mystery is coming. After all, the execution of the plot-lines, characters and the emotional scenes has always been the show's greatest strength.

I think she's still very new. 

>> ARTICLE
calling it right now , 40 min episode for the next two episode
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I think this series, despite giving us the obvious killer, is still really amazing. The fact that they piled up so much suspicion for the teacher made many of us viewers, myself included, doubt the fact that it could ever be the teacher. So in that sense, they did actually hit us with a curve ball this episode. This episode didn't feel like they rushed anything, it felt like they kept the pacing the same as any other episode, so as long as the rest of the episodes don't feel rushed, this remains a 10/10 in my book.
>> ARTICLE
Fuuuuuuuuucking hell that's a cliffhanger and half.

I should known it would be the teacher the minute I saw him in that paedo coat.

Though can Satoru time leap within a time leap? 
They showed him as a little boy, could he jump back to that or maybe by dying as a boy he undoes the events that lead to his death in complicated paradox.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like the anime skipped some chapters from the manga so that they could try to finish by the end of the season, sad that they left it out because this seemed somewhat critical to the plot

[tl;dr what happened between ep 9 and ep 10 in the manga](/s "Hinazuki returns to school after an agreement with that board of education that she only has a year left, so now she commutes to school via bus. Later Satoru's mom throws a party for Hinazuki's return. The following day, it actually Hinazaki that went to the teacher's office and had an awkward encounter with Aya. Later Hinazuki and Satoru go to a peak of a hill and Hinazuki thanks Satoru for all that he has done for her. Later that night, Satoru returns home and finds that Sawada (Satoru's mom's old co-worker) is there and discusses with the family about a serial killer that is in their town at the moment. Then the story picks back up at the ice hockey scene.")

>> ARTICLE
This actually surprised me. I'd written him off as a red herring, and thought it was gonna be someone else Satoru knew but we hadn't seen. Then it turns out to be this fucker all along.

Next week's episode is gonna be good. 
>> ARTICLE
Great episode. But it bothers me that they did not explain how MC couldn't loosen the seat belt by pulling on the upper part of the seat belt to get out...A kid should be able to get out of that easily...
>> ARTICLE
"Yashiro, are you leaping through time?"
>> ARTICLE
I doubt it will happen, but this is my hope/guess. Satorou dies, like this whole car incident actually killed him. However, Kayo, instead of Satorou, goes through a revival and now it's her job to save him.

If this happens I would absolutely love it, especially since we really don't know why at all this revival thing seems to happen yet.
>> ARTICLE
Man I couldn't breathe at the car ride scene.
But then again neither could Satoru...
>> ARTICLE
Ah. Called it. The facts *did* add up.
>> ARTICLE
seems saturo just got nominated for the ice bucket challenge... ok im sorry
>> ARTICLE
I am Kira
>> ARTICLE
Saturo survives, he had enough room so he could just a barely crawl under that garbage bin. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, I just knew it was him when the candy stash was found in his car. You could totally tell the teacher was nervous!
>> ARTICLE
BAD END
>> ARTICLE
Guys I think the killer is Kenya, you cant trust a guy who shares name with a country.
>> ARTICLE
This really reminded me of Persona 4's reveal...
>> ARTICLE
Typing this from Hokkaido, where the 1988 part of this show takes place.  Cold as sin here.  Visiting the night scenery of Hakodate mt Satoru was talking about in that one episode in less than an hour.
Food here is orgasmic!
>> ARTICLE
Started thinking that it was the sensei > Show somehow convinced me it wasn't him > Fuck it was him.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously?? I'm honestly disappointed that Yashiro turned out to actually be the killer. I knew it was him basically from the start and so did everyone else. I guess they wanted it to seem so obvious or couldn't be true. Still quality anime tho
>> ARTICLE
This show has what I call the Phoenix Wright problem with surprise culprits. Phoenix Wright wants to make each case a mystery, but only has so many characters. You end up being able to guess the culprit by process of elimination.

Here: The culprit is an adult man. There is only one adult male character. 
>> ARTICLE
Was anyone else bothered that Satoru followed Misato to the bathroom, got in the car with Yashiro and didn't realize she was still in the bathroom even though he was watching it the entire time. He never saw her leave the entire time so it should of been obvious to him.

Come on Satoru I know there's a 29 year old mind in that kid's body :P

For real though, I really enjoyed the episode. The reveal was amazing and that's coming from someone who basically knew of the killer so that says a lot. I was expecting a very dull reveal knowing the result and it still blew my mind which is super awesome :)
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else notice how Yashiro looked back once Satoru said he knows his future? I can see Yashiro calling authorities for help just so he can have a Death Note style fight over who can kill who first
>> ARTICLE
I KNEW IT WAS THAT DAMN BASTARD SENSEI

....although I think so did everyone else
>> ARTICLE
SATORU'S LIFE ENDS AND SO DOES MINE FeelsBadMan ' '\\
>> ARTICLE
Sensei no! I didn't want to believe it last episode with the candy, but now it makes sense. Satoru is so gullible too!  He saw her go into the bathroom, yet still believed Sensei when he said she went outside.
>> ARTICLE
Even though Yashiro's candy and him being all suspicious as fuck I wanted to trust him anyway :(

Anyways, Satoru could have at least tried to slide out of his seat belt.
>> ARTICLE
The main plot twist of the show was absolutely obvious for so long that honestly I'm disappointed. If that's where the show was going at least it should have been framed differently instead of constantly pointing out who the killer is with every narrative device at hand. I hope there is a bigger revelation to come though.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I felt it was great. Throughout the episode, I was thinking "oh, another obviously suspicious hint to set up the the twist that Yashiro isn't the killer later on" all the way up to the point he admitted to it.
>> ARTICLE
Oh come on! That was seriously disappointing!
>> ARTICLE
Thats it. I dont think theres any way this anime isnt going to be my top1 for a good amount of time.

Sorry Steins;Gate.
>> ARTICLE
For the sake of discussion, why does this trump Steins;Gate in your eyes? They're quite similar in certain respects, but to me Erased has always been the one that falls short in those departments. With the exception of the opening episodes maybe.
>> ARTICLE
I loved steins gate. But they didn't pace it nearly as well. When I rewatch it I honestly skip a few episodes. The ending of Steins Gate is still much better (i guess i dunno since i haven't finished this one yet) But people will like erased better right now since it's still ongoing unlike the finished steins gate.
>> ARTICLE
Speaking of Steins;Gate - and I know this is completely off-topic, I hope you managed to watch that first episode of *Steins;Gate 0* they previewed a couple of months ago!
>> ARTICLE
Episodes 1-3 of Erased I'd agree about the pacing, but since then Erased's faster pace has been just as detrimental as it has been helpful. Most notably in Episode 5-7, when Satoru returns to his original timeline. 

The series tried to end on big cliffhangers, but once the next episode came along, that cliffhanger was resolved within the first few minutes or less. Airi pasing out while her house was burning down, and Satoru being arrested. In both situations, it was resolved so quickly and effortlessly that it completely drained all the tension.
>> ARTICLE
They fucking nailed [the face.](http://i.imgur.com/UlFy0CE.png) Fucking. [Nailed](http://i.imgur.com/jC15T9j.jpg). It. Then again, they cut out [Erased Manga](/n "Kayo returning, her and Satoru's heartfelt reunion and her trying to befried Misato, like he once befriended her. That was such a cute part, I find it really sad it's gone.")

Oh, when we're at it, let's see how this whole mystery uses the Knox's Commandments (Umineko version).


>Knox's 1st: It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the story.

Assuming Sensei is the killer, fulfilled. 

>Knox's 2nd: It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective technique.

This one is tricky. Satoru's time-travel is obviously supernatural, leaving the question whether he actually uses it as a method of deduction. I'd say half-fullfilled. He doesn't use it actively to gather info, however, as he retains knowledge and is able to see differences and therefor prepare, he does make use of his power.

>Knox's 3rd: It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist, except if the house is expected to have them.

Fullfilled, none are used.

>Knox's 4th: It is forbidden for unknown drugs or hard to understand scientific devices to be used.

Fullfilled, none are used.

>Knox's 5th: No Chinaman must figure into the story.

Deprecated and obsolete. Disregarded.

>Knox's 6th: It is forbidden for accident or intuition to be employed as a detective technique.

Hmm, I think that's fullfilled. 

>Knox's 7th: It is forbidden for the detective to be the culprit.

Satoru: No! I must find the culprit!"

Sensei: No, Satoru. You are the culprit."

And then Satoru was the culprit.

>Knox's 8th: It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not presented.

As various comments from last time said very well, Sensei was already pretty suspicious. The clues were there, quite a few.

>Knox's 9th: It is permitted for observers to let their own conclusions and interpretations be heard.

Throughly used.

>Knox's 10th: It is forbidden for a character to disguise themselves as another without any clues

Fullfilled, none are used.


As we can see, pretty solvaable. Then again, Satoru's not really a detective, and being in a child's body really doesn't help him. So it's not really the kind of detective mysteries the Decalouge was written for.


Oh, and with Satoru saying "Uso da", I could almost hear [the cicadas.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry).
>> ARTICLE
5th isn't deprecated, its just stated in a way that was easier to say at the time. Probably involving a "chinaman" meant anyone from east asia, which at the time was the exotic and mysterious "Orient", oo look how different and mysterious they are! You could probably state 5 as "Does not involve a mysterious or exotic "other"" It could also refer to the Fu Man Chu archetype, which is essentially a super villain (albeit a maybe racist depiction). If Yashiro was American, then the 5th commandment wouldn't be fulfilled.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, holy shit. They managed to do a Monogatari with almost an entire episode taking place in a car and still being more suspenseful than shows manage in their entirety.

I don't see Satoru getting out of this one, and the cutting of the film is probably very clear as to his fate. Nice to see why Satoru had been hit by that water in the corrider in the OP now. I can only hope that he's going to trigger another rewind, right? RIGHT?

I suppose in a tragic sort of way, Satoru has won. The killings never happened, Kayo is happy, he saved the other two and got his mate a bird at the same time. 

Hope we learn more about Yuki next episode, we haven't seen him in ages and I have a terrible feeling he's going to get plastered as Satoru's murderer.
>> ARTICLE
> I suppose in a tragic sort of way, Satoru has won. The killings never happened

But he can just move on to another town and kill other kids

>> ARTICLE
He saved 3 lives thats nuff accomplishment
>> ARTICLE
No, he DELAYED 3 murders. 

He didn't actually catch the killer so he didn't save those lives in the end.
>> ARTICLE
Guy will move on to new town.Yashiro said atleast you brought peace to this town.

3 lives are SAVED.Period.
>> ARTICLE
You are assuming that 'lives' are non-interchangeable. 

He'll just go to the next town and kill 3 different people, so the 3 lives that were saved in this town are not saved in the next.
>> ARTICLE
[**OF COURSE HE'S THE KILLER. I KNOW IT.**](http://i.imgur.com/PZKGLtU.png)

Sometimes I thought if Satoru is helping everyone, who's gonna help him? They answered me rather harshly

Fuck the episode title, btw.
>> ARTICLE
I can understand why they did it but I'm still disappointed that A-1 had to skip these [two](http://imgur.com/a/shbRB) [scenes](http://imgur.com/a/fO2HM).  At the very least it should be interesting how much of the remaining thirteen chapters they'll be able to cover in the final two episodes (especially since the final chapter just came out in the past month).
>> ARTICLE
man the manga character design sure is ugly
>> ARTICLE
I swear to anime God that [if Satoru dies](https://gfycat.com/JointGoodBarnowl), I will rage so hard.    


>> ARTICLE
Yes we should totally expect a show with 13 episodes to totally kill off the main character 10 episode into it and jump into a 3 episode SOL epilogue on how everyone's future has changed because of it.
>> ARTICLE
Uh, I am a 6'2 man and I can slide under seat belts, wtf is this kid doing? 
>> ARTICLE
Panicking that the car was filling with water and unable to think rationally? 
>> ARTICLE
What? Slide the fuck down? There is no reason to panic enough to not be able to 

SLIDE.
 
THE.
 
FUCK.
 
DOWN.

I really think where did this panic feature came into humans.
>> ARTICLE
I KNEW IT WAS HIM!!!!!

but god damn we are back with these cliffhangers
>> ARTICLE
Using a drink + laxative, why don't they use sugar free haribos?
>> ARTICLE
I was hoping Satoru would grab the wheel and flip that bitch taking them both out.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I believe this Anime will follow the manga. I think there will only a few tweaks but will end similarly like the manga. Personally the chapters near the end weren't as great as the first half. Honestly after Kayo is saved and they find out who the killer is it seems like it's not that amazing.
>> ARTICLE
great build-up for the scene

when yashiro told satoru about the seatbelt, i thought it was kinda weird to but this detail in there, but the moment the seatbelt didnt go in well, i knew what was gonna happen

the moment it was clear he was the killer, all i thought all the time was that satoru wont be able to open his seatbelt


but what i also was thinking: cant an elementary schooler climb out of a seatbelt like that fairly easily?
>> ARTICLE
Well, finally the mystery is done. At the start, it was still uncertain who was the killer but a few episodes it was basicly certain that it's the teacher, not because there was a lot of proof for it, but due to lack of alternatives.
>> ARTICLE
Last week i was like "meh, these cliffhangers are getting kinda shit", but now im like "wtf wtf wtf, can we go back to the good old days".
>> ARTICLE
Alright, there's so many god damn ways to free yourself from a seat belt, it was designed for you to be able to get out of it in case the mechanism jams.

Also, one thing that only clicked for me now that I realized there's foreshadowing in the ending (that second or two of Satoru drowning). In the last episode there was a weird exposition on a hamster wheel for several seconds and I noticed it appears in the ending for a moment as well, right after someone cuts a noose with scissors. Also the scene ends with model planes drifting off into the sky and we know Yuuki had some interest in those things and played with them.

If Yuuki doesn't save the day, no one will.
>> ARTICLE
You know that feeling you get when you know you fucked up and all you can do is watch as the events unfold? That's how I felt the moment he adjusted the seat belt.


>> ARTICLE
Kinda fucked up how we all knew it was him inside but did the same thing as Satoru, I feel tricked ;_; also how much of that whole cigarette thing was true...because he totally walked out of the bathroom with a fucking lollypop hanging out of his mouth.
>> ARTICLE
I swear a child could squirm it's way out of a seatbelt, i could do that as a realy fucking fat kid.
>> ARTICLE
I FUCKING KNEW IT WAS HIM. THAT FUCK.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that did not feel like 23 minutes. This ep went by so fast.
>> ARTICLE
The scenes that leads up to these plot twists legitimately tense me up, and shock me... EVERY TIME D:
>> ARTICLE
Man I always knew it was the damn sensei but it just felt too obvious to me. Well played. I love it and now I am tempted more than ever to read the manga. I may have to block the sites hosting it so I don't spoil myself.
>> ARTICLE
Hiromi is way too cute for a guy.

 [](#akyuusqueel).
>> ARTICLE
Lol I got spoiled about this episode without even believing it :D never trust them spoilers, you won't feel as bad afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone who wants to see manga chapters that they covered (actually, cutted shit out of it... no Kayo return). Start from chapter 28, page 1 and it ends at chapter 31, last page. Still 12 chapter to cover in 2 episodes, quality stuff!! Kappa.... :(
>> ARTICLE
It kind of feels to easy but I'm happy it isn't a last minute asspull (like many other mystery shows do).
>> ARTICLE
Yashiro is a fucking piece of shit, at least give the kid a fighting chance.
>> ARTICLE
Deconstruction of a plot twist.  
>> ARTICLE
YOU CANT END AN EPISODE LIKE THAT?  Can you? That's not fair! This is like a cliffhanger like no other... And all along, we thought it was too obvious for sensei to be the killer. We've been double crossed. Damn it!!! Next thursday needs to come soon! Also someone needs to save Satoru, he can't just die!
>> ARTICLE
I only just caught up to this show yesterday. How the hell can you people handle a week wait? 
>> ARTICLE
I KNEW IT! Now I won't have to eat a shoe!
>> ARTICLE
I'm at a loss for words. The ultimate cliffhanger, and no butterfly too. Fucking Yashiro, the moment I saw his candy I knew it was fucking him.

Congratulations ERASED, I feel more for this show than I've ever felt. This is actually the greatest anime ever. Every little thing comes together for a show that makes me cry, laugh, and hope. I'm at a loss of fucking words.
>> ARTICLE
One little thing I noticed, I seem to remember manga Yashiro gives him a spiked drink or something, right? He drugs him somehow before they get in the car? They seemed to skip over that and just had him all lurching over and having a hard time moving in the car, but I guess you could explain it as the shock from the reveal getting to him.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god he's gonna die, what if that's why he's "Erased" like he dies 
>> ARTICLE
Satoru Q_Q

I was literally sitting here like why the fuck is this episode called joy there's no joy here (except the teacher's)

Someone better save satoru or I swear to god I will cry. Also ireally liked that ending, how all the film broke and the light went out. I also like how you could literally feel the fear satoru was feeling as he was listening to the teacher talk.

And I did think the teacher's plan to lure satoru in was very clever.

I still think kenya is up to some shit.
>> ARTICLE
DAMNIT! I've been hoping that it wasn't the teacher, even though it was pretty obvious, he was such a cool guy..
>> ARTICLE
> he was such a cool guy..

[The greatest cool.](http://i.imgur.com/qcnwMc1.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
It would have been fun if the teacher actually was the good guy and fought the killer.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. Called it on ep 3. He was just too active in the series to just be a teacher.
>> ARTICLE
There was no other option, which is why I guess I was so surprised. I thought for sure they were making him look like the killer to swerve us. I guess I was looking to deep into it. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been suspicious of Yashiro for a long time, the moment the candy episode happen it solidified everything for me. During that scene he had a lot of candy, and you could see that he was jittery. His finger tapping on the wheel, the way he freaked out when the candy was revealed, it was just enough information to make it apparent. 

The reveal in this episode was EXACTLY what I wanted it to be. I haven't read the manga or LN so I have no idea for how the show will progress, but I wanted the killer to go for Satoru. He has been running around pulling targets away for the past few episodes. That brings a lot of suspicion on him AND he has been doing most of this alone. So he was just as good of a target as some of the other options. Really glad this is how the episode progressed, although there are a lot of feels.

Overall, great episode. I was shouting as the episode progressed. Next Thursday can't come fast enough.

Oh I was very suspicious of Yashiro for a long time, but as you said with the candy episode. The moment I saw Yashiro's hand movements while driving and the huge piles of candy. I knew it was him. He covered it up really well, but man. He was jittery and you could tell.

Edit: Grammar fixes!
>> ARTICLE
My worst fears for this series are realized... It's gonna be one hell of a bumpy ride through these next two episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Alriiiight we're finally here. Can't wait for next ep.
Will we ride the feels train? 


But... This isn't my train...
>> ARTICLE
A lot of people are talking about a scene shown in the opening that has yet to occur in the show, but I'd also like to point to the ending. There are still a few characters shown there that I don't recognize. Considering how much attention to detail there is in this show, I doubt that's it's a coincidence.
>> ARTICLE
I thought this reveal was fantastic. In every other mystery, the killer is caught because all the clues are in place and the MC catches them before they strike again. But in here, Yashiro dupes Satoru and just lays flat every plan, every move, and his true form. The greatness of the scene is less of "who it is" and more of "who HE is." Also, the matter of fact voice he delivers it in, unlike the usual gruff Batman-wannabe, makes it even more creepy.
>> ARTICLE
i kind of think it would of been cool if satou was even more desperate to get out of that car. 

like as soon as he realizes that the teacher is the killer.  he should start freaking the fuck out.  he waits until he is at the lake to try to unbuckle his seat belt?

wuh



instead he king of jiggles on his seat belt a bit and throws the teacher some lines about he will never give up.  
>> ARTICLE
Honestly didn't expect the teacher because I thought it was too obvious. I guess that's what made it not obvious..
>> ARTICLE
I've been wondering for awhile but when the kids say goodbye "shiitake" is this a dialect or just some phrase the kids use?
>> ARTICLE
I have to agree with those that say this was the best way they could have handled it considering how the show built up. Yes it was obvious, maybe not a good "mystery" in a a sense, but its much better than the killer turning out to be some random dude. Even Satoru talks about how obvious it was. Satoru and most of us were just too trusting of him and kept saying he was a red herring. 

The entire scene was still very intense and  that cliffhanger, just like the other cliff-hangers in this show, make it really hard to wait for next week.
>> ARTICLE
[ANN Review shitting all over this episode](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/erased/episode-10/.99639). While I am a little disappointed it was the teacher and do agree that Yashiro's evil face was too over the top, giving this a D- grade seems pretty excessive IMO. That would not only make it the worst episode of ERASED, but probably the worst episode of any reviewed show this season.

FUCK

I thought it was too obvious, guess not

So... Is Misato in the trunk or just shitting her brains out?

I'm not understanding the hate over this episode. I thought it was great. Sure, we all suspected Yashiro pretty early on, but the show has done a great job of making the viewer doubt and reject the idea.. just as Satoru did. 
>> ARTICLE
**I PUT MY TRUST...IN YOU**
>> ARTICLE
God, the whole car scene was masterful. It made me sicker to my stomach than pigtails was. Just. Christ.
>> ARTICLE
I think it hurt even worst knowing that Satoru actually looked up to the creep. Yashiro genuinely seemed like a father-figure that could fill a void in Satoru's family (don't get me wrong, best mom is still the best).

Also, [my reaction to this episode](http://imgur.com/LitYGCi)

Damn, it was the teacher all along. Fair enough, he and the mother are the only adult main characters in that time period.
>> ARTICLE
So much foreshadowing in this whole anime. from this episode's "it's like we won't see him tomorrow" to all the way in the beginning when Satoru says something along the lines of sometimes fixing things turns out negative for me. Truly incredible
>> ARTICLE
Think was when he finally revealed himself in the car misako was still washing her hands
>> ARTICLE
The mood was all over the place this episode with a new ship appearing and then the killer's reveal. As expected of Erased.
>> ARTICLE
Don't know if anyone has brought this up, but if you guys pause at the right moment in the OP when his glasses are shattered by a bullet, you can actually see the killer in the reflection of the shards.
>> ARTICLE
From the moment they showed sensei's black gloves I was like *More red herring?* but as he talked I knew. Scratch that, from the moment he was with the 3 girls I was expecting/hoping it was just red herring.

Fuck. Now I gotta wait a whole week, but based on the title I can guess where this might be going, and I hope i'm wrong.

Also, there were ways to escape from the seatbelt, maybe even jump out of the car while in/near the city, which bugs me because up until now Satoru has been thinking like an adult.
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn they did an amazing job with the reveal. This show is just fantastic. It all makes perfect sense. 
>> ARTICLE
They made it so obvious that it was Yashiro that I actually thought there was no way it would be him. I still thought there'd be some way to explain creepy behavior until he pretty much said "your death". Fuck the red herring man
>> ARTICLE
I knew I made the right call to watch this inbetween KonoSuba and AssClass.

Holy shit that was one stressful carpool. Car. In a pool. Huh.

Where's the rest of this episode? That cliffhanger is too shocking.
>> ARTICLE
Who here needs life support?

The gloves for fuck sake, he always wore the gloves outside the school no matter what he did.
>> ARTICLE
Copypasta from the Boku dake ga inai machi subreddit 10 episode discussion: 

Maybe the anime is going to present a great moral at the end. Even though it's a mystery anime and you are supposed to be surprised at the end, perhaps its not the focus of the story but the moral of it.

And the moral is-don't trust someone even though you believe with all your heart that he has done nothing wrong.

Through all the anime you see people believe blindly in other people simply because they need someone to belive in (like the Airi-Satoru scene where she says she wants to belive him for the sake of it, or Satoru's blind belief in Yuuki even though he had no evidence he didn't do anything or that someone else has done the crimes. The only evidence he has is Yuuki's charachter) so you can say it's a theme in the story.

So he believed in the teacher because of the nice and trustworthy charachter he presented to him but at the end he just pretended to be nice-the evidence Satoru needs for believing someone.

>> ARTICLE
1) The killer is the one everybody suspected it was all along. Anti-climactic revelation is anti-climactic.

2) Do you know why it was so obvious? Because the show never attempted to make it seem like it could be anyone else. He was the only suspect.

3) People were still surprised with the obvious revelation because they were refusing to believe it would be so obvious. So they call it amazing writing because it made it seem it was too easy to be him. What kind of self trolling is this? 

4) The protagonist did nothing to deduct who is the killer. What kind of a detective story is this where there is no detective work in it?

5) The protagonist was just wasting his time being with the children the killer was supposed to abduct next, which makes no sense since if he changed the timeline there is no reason for the killer to go after the same people. But no, the show treats time like you change one thing and everything else remains exactly the same. 

6) The killer was not revealed because of a mistake he did. He exposed himself and even went as far as monloguing his evil intentions, like a Saturday morning cartoon villain. Great writing trololol. 

7) Do you know how he excuses why he likes killing little children? Because he is evil. Great writing trololol.

8) Furthermore, the killer is now a complete retard when so far he was presented as a mastermind that would magically appear every time someone would expose him, set a trap to kill him, and then throw the blame on someone else. He always had an alibi. But in this case, not only he was seen leaving with the protagonist, not only he drugged him, which will show if they ever make a blood test, but he also had nobody to take the blame. He just runs away from town which is the same thing as infringing himself. Where did your intellect go? 

9) The protagonist couldnt slip out of a jammed seat belt, which is something even an adult can do.

10) The episode ends with a cliffhanger that makes everybody wonder OMG what will happen next? What do you think will happen? Its not the last episode so the protagonist is definitely not going to die. There is either going to be a bullshit time reset once again, or he is going to be plot armored and survive with some improbable way.

Wait, didn't Satoru see Misato enter the washroom and he was waiting for her to come out? How is Sensei's "oh she went out" and "omg its the suspicious truck" thing work? 
>> ARTICLE
This show is killing me inside. God damn. 
>> ARTICLE
Can someone here explain a few things to me?


1. So as said before, Satoru definitely COULD and WOULD get under the seatbelt and could get out, most people's explanation of why he didn't is because of panic, which I kind of get but I think Satoru is pretty reasonable and smart and could get out of it anyway, oh well.



2. The basketball on the gas pedal. Would it really work? I don't know if a round object like a basketball was the best thing to put on a gas pedal as it's questionable as to how it would stay on the pedal(depending of the type of car and the pedal's position). And also I'm guessing the car was a manual and put in neutral when it was stationary. We didn't see Yashiro shift it to 1st gear, so how did it start moving? Or was it an automatic?



3. Yashiro called in the food delivery and knew Satoru would go after the Misato to the bathroom. How did he know exactly when Satoru would check on her, since Satoru was waiting for her for a while and how did he know that exactly at about that time when Satoru checked on her and went out with Yashiro, that the food delivery car would exactly at that time drive past the area just in time for Satoru to spot it? It could have driven off at any other time, sooner or later. 



>> ARTICLE
Honestly, I don't get the fuss about the basketball.

He jammed it ball in against the above compartment. The ball is effectively stuck, holding the pedal down in place.

No he didn't use woodoo magic and the ball definitely doesn't weight enough by itself to hold the pedal down without any outside friction.

so are we done with the ship between sensei and best mom

Teacher was my prime suspect since episode 1, shame it turned out to actually be him.

Way too obvious.

Before the shit-storm controversy about Yashiro being the killer comes in, I'd just like to say that they did the reveal really well. The manga had a perfect mood leading up to the reveal and the anime pulled it off really nicely.

Now to wonder how they will manage to adapt these last 14 chapters in two episodes. They will have to skip a ton of material but there are a lot of scenes that really shouldn't be rushed or skipped.
>> ARTICLE
Well, that was disappointing.

>> ARTICLE
I can totally understand people not being off-put by the obvious culprit reveal, but I don't appreciate them telling me that I "should get the point and focus on the 'why/how' instead of the 'who'". Am I wrong for feeling disappointed?

Of course the why/how are important, but in my opinion, that doesn't just excuse Erased from being such an easy mystery. A good one should excel at all aspects (who, why, how, red herrings, clues, multiple possible suspects) without heavily compromising on any of them and still deliver an engaging overall story experience. Erased doesn't get a pardon from me just because it's deemed a masterpiece by the general populace, especially since it's labeled a mystery. It's not much of a "mystery" but more of just suspense.

tl;dr, I'm not going to just ignore the fact that the mystery is so blatant and say "Oh, that doesn't affect the story's quality at all, who cares."


>> ARTICLE
The thing is that the manga wasn't advertised as *mystery* but as a *fantasy thriller seinen*. The mystery isn't the focus of this story and there just happens to be a part of it that involves a mystery.
>> ARTICLE
While it's true that Erased isn't so big on the "mystery" despite being tagged and labeled as such, it still *presents* itself at least *somewhat* as a mystery, because there's actually an *unknown* killer on the loose and *part* of the end-objective is finding out who he/she is and delivering justice, with clues and red herrings (like the fact that the culprit knows Hiromi is male, as well as Sachiko's reaction to seeing the culprit after getting stabbed in episode 1) and some investigation-like moments strewn about the story. This isn't Death Note, where it's *explicitly shown* to us right from the beginning that Light is the "culprit". But then as the plot went on, the mystery became increasingly obvious and so that's why people are saying it's not the focus. And I can actually agree with that, but the problem is that Erased was *too* obvious and blatant. I'm not asking for mindblowing twists, but I feel Erased could've put in some more effort into actually making this an interesting mystery (for starters, include some more reasonable suspects; Yashiro was really the only possible one).

So basically, Erased may not be strictly a full-fledged mystery, but it has *some* mystery elements in its presentation, and that is why I will not excuse or ignore the obvious, in-your-face treatment of them, regardless of its tags and labels. It's understandable that some people would feel at least *a little* disappointment with the obvious culprit reveal, and I don't think it's right to blame them for supposedly having "wrong expectations".
>> ARTICLE
As a manga reader, I wonder if they will be able to cover the remaining material within two episodes...

So how many chapters do they have left to adapt?

FFUUCKK! NOOOO!!

We all knew it was comming. We all knew what was going to happen but not like THIS! 

But I mean come on! He can't just slip right past the seat belt? He's a kid! I'm sure he could of either pushed himself up or sank down below it. I've done it a couple of times before and in a situation like that I'm sure he could of done it! 

And why on earth would he listen to the teacher?! "*She went outside.*" HA! How the fuck can she go outside if you obviously saw her going into the bathroom with only one way out!?! Unless the bathroom had windows there would be no way she could of gone outside without Satoru knowing.

God damn it....
>> ARTICLE
depends on the seat belt. that works for most of them  but the teacher could have rigged it so there is no slack in the belt. once thats done (there is no reason to test that out too) make sure you can't disconnect it and volia a seat belt that traps whoever is wearing it.
>> ARTICLE
Shit man, you're right...Well fuck, then the only way I can see this playing out is if the teacher saves him.

When Satoru said he knew his future the teacher stopped for a moment. I think the teacher might save him and try to get Satoru to tell him of his future or something. 
>> ARTICLE
Seriously people, who did you expect to be the murderer? I was watching the different comment sections and people were like "nah, 'tcant be the teacher, he cares too much"... yeah right people, as if noone was able to pretend to be someone they're not. Like, whom else did everyone suspect? Kenya? Fuckin Jun? ._.
>> ARTICLE
Well, there it is, the least surprising reveal, I think almost everyone figured out it was the teacher quite a while ago. Terrifying still to think that the murderer was the one who everyone trusted, the closest to the children. 
  
Drowning has to be the worst possible way to die, struggling futily for air that isn't coming. I can only hope someone finds him before it's too late.

Hell until he got in the car with him I didn't think it was really the teacher. I thought it was a red herring for sure...
>> ARTICLE
The thing is though that no one else was even remotely close to being a prime suspect; I'll admit I was on the red herring train til the end since I was banking on mystery tropes and the show would introduce another suspicious character.

I feel like we're going to find out more about the rewind ability next episode. There's a lot of sci-fi imagery in the ed that hasn't been referenced in the show yet. It's also the only way for Satorou to make it out of this since Mom is too far away and his friends wouldn't have been able to follow him. I suppose there's a chance Yashiro could try to save him to learn his future, but I doubt it.

As others have pointed out, the teacher being the killer is good because it's better than having some random dude show up for the reveal. I feel like most people would have called that an unsatisfying ass-pull. There's also the point that the show is really more of a thriller than a mystery. Yashiro was the prime suspect from the start and no other character was really given enough attention to be considered an option. 

In the end, it's more about how *Satoru* navigates the puzzle than the viewer.
>> ARTICLE
thriller? there are literally no STAKES to feel tension. he could have let kayo die in first place to learn the face of the murderer and then revival the whole thing. and the revival not being controlled is bullshit since he did control it 2 times already and they never show times when he might need one and it doesn't come

Well said. Now on that note, can we all stop saying we guessed it was the teacher? Of course you did.
>> ARTICLE
Every time Satoru, as a 29 year old adult, acts in a retarded manner or overlooks something obvious (which is very often throughout the series) I keep repeatedly reminding myself this is a guy whose profession is a pizza delivery boy at 29, and everything he does becomes more realistic. 
>> ARTICLE
In retrospect is there anyone else that it could have actually been and had a big impact on the story?
>> ARTICLE
I know that many people are disappointed that the teacher was the killer (because it was pretty obvious), but I am glad he was due to the fact that like no one else could reasonably be the killer, and I would rather have the teacher as the killer than some new character or a bullshit excuse for another character.
>> ARTICLE
It was the teacher, so unexpected, much wow. I hated how he explained everything for the audience, like goddamn, that isn't mystery, you don't just info-dump all your thought process... 
>> ARTICLE
I have to say I was disappointed by this episode, it's dropped my rating for Erased from an 8 to a 7.

I'm mostly fine with the choice of Yashiro as the villain, he was really the only viable choice unless the story wanted to pull some type of twist. However his writing post villain revelation was pretty cringe worthy. "This is my true form" and "it's like you've seen the future" were particularly painfully bad lines, and despite how creepy his speech was it really didn't explain any motivation for his actions other then that he's evil, which is really disappointing. It's easy to imagine more interesting motivations for example if all his killings had actually been assisted suicides because he experienced urges to kill, but didn't want to hurt anyone.

Since Erased has been a moreso a thriller than a mystery it can certainly survive the weaknesses of this episode. Yahsiro still has room for a more interesting motivation, or even simply a more melodrama motivation, such as his killings being driven by perverse sexual lust, and with a dramatic and ideally thematically resonant ending, Erased can regain it's former glory.

I have no idea how to feel about any of this ;-; 
>> ARTICLE
And we still don't know what Kenya told Yashiro in the beginning haha
>> ARTICLE
Well that was obvious from the very beginning. I'm hoping they have an actually unexpected twist still ahead.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, maybe it's because my mind doesn't function as well as other people's, but I didn't find the true identity of the killer to be that obvious. 

The only reason why I thought that the teacher might possibly be the killer was because he was the most suspicious, there were a lot of hints that maybe I missed, but at no point I thought that it was DEFINITELY going to be him. Heck, I even suspected Kenya or Hiromi at this point. The one thing that should have gotten me was the fact that at no point did the teacher have the malicious 'red eyes', so that was the biggest clue, but at the same time I thought that since he didn't have those eyes he wasn't even a suspect, IN FACT, the red eyes thing was completely unnecessary overall. I mean, they were there to drive attention AWAY from the actual killer, and if they hadn't been there I'm pretty sure that we were going to have a lot more trouble figuring this shit out.  

And it's probably because of that that it might have seem a little too obvious. But despite it all, it fooled me, and they handled it pretty well. Especially during last episode and this episode, I mean, it became obvious when we saw that the bastard had freaking candy in his trunk, but at no point before this I thought it was obvious.

Either way it's just me. I don't expect everyone to agree with me of course!
>> ARTICLE
this episode explained so much and honestly pulled it back from a 9/10 to 10/10. I hope the teacher will turn around and save satoru after and so they can have more conversations. I really enjoyed that car conversation.

Anyways what I said in episode 2 turned out to be right. Based on the OP: the teacher, while clearly being a suspect, didn't have a scene with his eyes blacked out like the other suspects. I hope the story keeps him as antagonist.
>> ARTICLE
This episode...

I am vexed-

[VEXED I TELL YOU](http://blogs.getty.edu/inspired/files/gm_30504901_300.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Not really surprised he's the killer (who would be?). I'm actually glad it was an established character and not some completely random dude no one knew, though.

Personally, what's kept me coming back every week to watch this wasn't *who* the killer was, but *how* Satoru would be able to save Kayo, the other victims, and ultimately his mother. So I'm not too disappointed that the killer was so obvious, since his identity isn't the most important thing in the show, imo.
>> ARTICLE
Good episode,  but as a reader of the manga, it feels a bit rushed.
>> ARTICLE
[Well I called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/46fvpu/spoilers_boku_dake_ga_inai_machi_episode_7/d0514r0)

Everyone seemed to be concerned with a red herring but aside from the teacher there were quite literally no other adult males that seemed suspicious. As his teacher, Yashiro knew Hiromi was a boy and Satoru mentioned that the killer purposely killed Hiromi to make people think that the killer thought Hiromi was a girl. Yuuki was pretty much ruled out from the beginning so only one suspect is left...

Now onto the non-serious stuff. [I think some people might have a different definition of alone time, Hiromi...](http://imgur.com/lxQSA1B)

>> ARTICLE
Damnit! I was assuming that the show was only hinting at Yashiro like crazy because it would then show the genre savvy as fools when they showed the actual culprit.

Nope! It was just Yashiro. Not to say that the reveal wasn't good, I just saw it coming from way too far ahead.
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty disappointed. All of this time I was hoping they would pull a complete 180 on us and reveal Yuki was the killer. Satoru was so sure that he was innocent that I think it would have been an interesting way to go. Sometimes there are people who you want to believe in but ultimately they just let you down. Obviously it doesn't make much sense with regard to the future, but I suppose they could have used Yuki's father as the antagonist in the future. 

But instead they used the super-suspicious teacher. Oh well.
>> ARTICLE
How could Yuuki have been the killer when the kidnappings and killings continued while he was in prison, as seen in the first episode?
>> ARTICLE
They made it so obvious who the murderer is, surely there will be a bigger mindfuck in the next couple episodes. hopefully. 
>> ARTICLE
FUCKING... *FUCK*

I WANTED IT TO BE SOMEONE ELSE 
>> ARTICLE
What the hell...

I wanted to see that butterfly at the end at least that precedes the rewind things.

Also my suspicions of the teacher were right but he's just going to go to another town now and start killing there? I assume the game over part was his plan in this one town.

Also he didn't kill that girl right? He just used her as bait to get Satoru alone.
>> ARTICLE
I hate myself because we all saw it coming, but I didn't want to believe it. I would normally be more upset over this lackluster twist, but because there are so many other things to love about erased, I can't get too pissed. The episode did a good job at making me horrified for the entire second half; the director and voice actor did a really good job. Even if it was obvious, I'm glad that it makes sense; I've seen too may mystery shows where they try so hard to surprise the audience, that the plot doesn't add up. I don't know how the fuck they'll wrap up this show in 2 episodes. Whatever happens, I will die 2 weeks from now.

I'm not sure how I feel about that the teacher is confirmed to be the killer, he looked so sketchy in so many scenes, but it just seemed a little too obvious. But then again, since it seemed so obvious I was thinking that it had to be someone else, but there just weren't any characters left, really.

Can he have a revival while he's in a revival? I see him getting out of this situation in two ways, either he has a revival, or the teacher saves him because he wants to know what Satoru means by Satoru knowing the teachers future.

Ahhhhh, the fated reveal, going through the series up to this point in the anime, it was much more obvious to the fact that he was the killer, reading through the manga however, I think it was much much more subtle and less obvious, I didn't expect it to be him when I read it.

I guess it's safe to mention this now. 
There's a novel serialization going on in Japan with a different perspective on the story: From Yashiro's POV.

I thought Yashiro was way too obvious a suspect and that it would turn out to be a whole other person we never thought of before, maybe even someone that hadn't been introduced in the show. But surprise surprise, it turned out to be the most obvious suspect after all. It was way too easy for him to manipulate his students and get them to a location where they can easily be taken.

The one thing that bugs me is that Satoru didn't realize Yashiro was the killer even when he started explaining his motives. How can he be so naive as a 29 year old in a child's body?

The teacher had the same haircut in the future and past sustaining the same height also, in the past he had sweets in the glove compartment, plus the seat belt stuck, coincidence?

In original Japanese, he said "/my memories have been back", so I think he regained them a while ago.

i dont know, the show made it pretty clear that yashioros nervous tapping was what made satoru remember
>> ARTICLE
I think the show rather made it pretty clear that talking to Kayo was the trigger at least in anime, as the scene where he touches Kayo's baby's hand for some reason went weird. He asked himself what he did for her to make her thank him, and closed his eyes. I think that was supposed to be the start of his regaining memories, and then that made him ask his doctor about increasing rehab twice as much. But it's also possible that there may be untold scenes of how he regained memories next week. 

*edit* My theory is that Satoru's child voice appearing = amnesia status
>> ARTICLE
That would explain why he wanted to regain his strengths so fast. He knew that Yashiro will show up and wanted to be ready for this.
>> ARTICLE
Yashiros more than likely in the process of trying to frame Satoru for a suicide. I realized this when he had Satoru press the elevator button himself. Although Id like to believe Satoru recovered his memories earlier than the show lead us to believe and that he currently has some sort of plan in motion to get revenge on the man.
>> ARTICLE
I also noticed that Yashiro had gloves on when he placed some kind of phone or something on Kumi's desk, but then didn't have them when he met Satoro, however they were back on when he was pushing the wheelchair, which would also hide his fingerprints.

I'm definitely thinking based off of a couple unexplained moments and his spontaneous extreme determination to get physically fit, he has some kind of bait planned, and is banking on Yashiro expecting him to be defenseless. Though he presumably will still be relatively weak, so it's all gonna come down to the surprise factor o:

I thought that Yashiro killed the girl, and was gonna frame Satoru for it.

I couldn't help but be reminded that in the OP one of the last scenes is the camera seemingly falling from a roof top...

Discussion:

What was that fucking phone that sensei left on the desk next to Kumi? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm almost certain it's going to be a fake suicide note on the phone to convince others that Satoru jumped off the roof. That combined with sensei's wearing the gloves and making Satoru push the button to the roof (so Satoru's fingerprints will be on the button) makes me suspect that's his motive.

Wow, I knew the translation this whole time and I thought it was talking about Hinazuki's poem, but I guess in the end it's really about Satoru huh?
>> ARTICLE
Hinazuki's poem uses a female pronoun for the "I", but the actual title uses an male one.
>> ARTICLE
'Watashi' is actually gender-neutral or more polite but 'Boku' is more boyish, even if it's not exclusively male.
>> ARTICLE
More stylized is "The Town Where Only I am Missing". Which makes a lot of sense.

>> ARTICLE
The manga even takes it a step further. [Manga Spoiler](/s "Satou actually wakes up with all the skills, abilities, and memories of the very original timeline, where he was not involved with the murders. This is hinted at by him still having a "Silver tongue" when he should only have a grade school vocabulary and manga-artist level drawing skills, leading to several occasions will he will bring something up, like a summer camp trip, that he wasn't actually there for in the new timeline but still occurred similarly to the original. He literally grew up in the same town and circumstances but he only exists in the town in his own memories.")

Satoru had hidden the 7 dragon balls in his back pocket for this moment, he stood up and called upon his innocence, the Crown Clown to invoke the Shadow Clone Jutsu. This was it, the moment he had been training for. *BAN-KAI* he shouted as in a blast of steam he became a titan, and slowly raised his hands as the two swords Elucidator and Zangetsu materialized in his hands. With a thunderous cry, Satoru's Kamehameha pierced Yashiro's heart with the ferocity of the Heart of the Cards. **Unlimited Shounen works!**

And when the dust settles, Airi walks out from behind a corner and says:

I didn't believe it at first so I had to check for myself.

Then went and checked EP 5 @ 16:02

http://i.imgur.com/XTn7iXJ.png
>> ARTICLE
So the *reporters* were trying to make a story of how Satoru is a kid in a man's body who is still interested in little girls. The Yachiro-sensei makes those people scram.

Then we meet the little girl, Kumi, in a touching scene with Satoru. It is also implied that she and Satoru have interacted more times, and maybe even grown closer.

Next, sensei has been aware of her for a while, and also seems to have visited her a few times. He even visited her while she was sleeping.

All I can think about is how those *reporters* foreshadowed sensei's plan of killing the girl and framing Satoru for it.

And Satoru's group of friends got extremely close by the end of the last episode. While I wasn't surprised that Kayo ended up with someone from the friend group, I expected it to be Kenya.

No Kenya's a G. He wouldn't steal best girl away from Satoru. To be honest, I'm disapointed in Hiromi b/c Satoru just kinda casually saved him from being brutally murdered by a serial killer. But whatever, I guess that's the kind of person Hiromi is.
>> ARTICLE
But Hiromi didn't even know. Tbh I'm happy that Hiromi and Kayo, two of the kids that Satoru saved, ended up together. That moment when the baby stopped crying after touching Satoru's hand was touching, as if he knew that he was there because of Satoru.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, after my knee jerk reaction, I'm happy that Hiromi and Kayo are together and that Kayo has a loving family and Hiromi's waifu is an angel.

I also loved Satoru's reaction of being overjoyed when Kayo appeared with her baby too.

The thing is Hiromi didn't know what Satoru did for him. None of them realize that he saved so many lives by putting his own life on the line.

>> ARTICLE
Satoru just blurting out he got his memories back at the end of the episode seemed completely stupid at first, as he is alone on the roof with the teacher, but I think that :

- first, Satoru can walk and defend himself. He didn't train so hard to be still stuck in a wheelchair.

- second, he probably talked to the reporter off camera. We saw the reporter talking to Kenya about what happenned 15 years ago, and since Kenya knew Satoru's suspicion of a child's abducter/murderer, he should have connected it to Satoru's own "accident" (how the hell did he not die anyway??). So I think Kenya and the reporter will show up at a critical moment to help Satoru and incriminate the teacher.

Besides, for people who feel disappointed that Kayo ended with Hiromi and not Satoru - how could an 11 years old girl decide to devote herself entirely to another kid, for the rest of her life, when said kid is in a coma and honestly presumed to never wake up? Come on guys, apart from Super Mom, no one could have believed he would wake up after so long. She deserved to be happy, after all Satoru did for her, and I'm glad she ended like that instead of wasting her life waiting for a kid in a coma.

[It's only one chapter if you want to read it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/3rnak7/discboku_dake_ga_inai_machi_chapter_32/)

[From the manga, chapter 32](/n "For all of his childhood, he was beated up by his older brother. But this stopped in elementary school when he fulfilled a specific task for his brother: he started abducting other lone elementary school girls for his big brother to *touch and such*.
One day, the brother killed one and he helped hide the body. But then he set up a trap for his brother to *accidentaly* hang himself and for the body of the girl to be discovered. Insert here the first time he had this creepy smile and eyes as he realizes he killed someone without getting cought for it.
He then proceeds to become and elementary school teacher; 11 years later he killed his first elementary school girl and proceeded to kill his fiance when she got suspicious.")

[Basically](/s "Gaku was born to mild parents with a brother that was two years older than him. They placed all their expectations onto Gaku, neglecting his older brother and causing Gaku to be bullied by him. He went to Mikoto Elementary school along with his brother. During his fifth year, his brother convinced him into becoming his accomplice. He would lure girls from his school into his family's storehouse. After his brother assaulted the girl it would be Gaku's job to comfort them so they would keep quiet about it.")

If you want to know more: http://bokudakegainaimachi.wikia.com/wiki/Gaku_Yashiro

It's pretty easy to guess with the hamster story Yashiro told at the beginning of the episode. Hamster was drowning, Yashiro pulls it out and raises it to watch it grow, just like Yashiro watching Satoru grow while in a coma. Yashiro even says he's talking about Satoru using the story.

Honestly, that's what I was expecting Yashiro to do anyway. That, or just to talk, but ehh..
>> ARTICLE
I think he regained his memories right after kayos baby touches his hand. He completely changes after that. And goes back to his adult self. Being able to draw again. Wanting to tell his mom something then saying it's nothing. And focuses so much on rehab. Even the baby's name meaning future and him touching his hand sparks his memories. Right after he gets very quiet and hangs his head down. You also don't hear his inner child voice after that. 

>> ARTICLE

They're rushing it already. This episode is completely different from the manga.

The end of the episode is anime original. So at this point, we have a rough idea of how this will end, since they skipped a ton of stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Seeing Kayo with her baby made me really angry at first, but then I realized that it made sense. You can't really expect an 11 year old girl to wait 15 years for someone. The pairing with Hiromi kinda confused me. If Kayo was gonna be with anyone besides Satoru, I would've expected Kenya, but I guess it kinda makes sense since both Kayo and Hiromi know what it's like to be alone. Someone posted a thread a couple weeks ago about noticing the threads attached to the heads, but I just kinda laughed it off thinking, "lol how to people notice these things" but now it's a relevant important small detail. Yashiro grabbing Satoru's wheelchair made me really nervous, but Satoru has his memories back (or so he claims) and now I can't wait for the final episode!
>> ARTICLE
That's exactly it.

People applaud this anime for being quite realistic and then get shocked when the show doesn't pull off some romance show bullshit just to make a ship sail!?
>> ARTICLE
Actually the reason why hiromi is paired with kayo is a bit poetic. If satarou had not been there both would have died at age of 10. Now because he saved both of them and sacrificed his 15 years of his life, he was not only able to give them a life but also made way to an entirely new life(the baby). Essentially that baby would not have existed if he had *not* saved both of them. 

edit: missed *not*
>> ARTICLE
hence the name Mirai (future) being so fitting to the child.

Satoru didnt simply saved people's life, he (indirectly) created life too
>> ARTICLE
I know the backstory for Yashiro cut out some details from the manga but it was 50x creepier and they kept the important things.

The final whispered line of "I'm talking about you, Satoru" is the creepiest thing I've heard in an anime, I think.
>> ARTICLE
The OP where only I don't belong...
>> ARTICLE
I've read many people mention the fact that Satoru wasn't in the OP. The device that most impressed me this episode wasn't the new OPI've seen that a few timesbut how his little self is the one voicing his thoughts. It was the other way around when Satoru was a man trapped in a boy's body, but now he's more of a child trapped in a man's body, and the voice in his thoughts reflects that.

If they extend this device next episode to have his grown-man voice voice his thoughts, the show will come full circle.

I don't get why people are annoyed at Kayo having a child with Hiromi. From a writing point of view it makes a good amount of sense since Hiromi (and Kayo) died on the first timeline while on this one, the MC was for all intents and purposes dead. In a way, Hiromi is basically living Satoru's life.

REKT. A-1 Pictures, you've done it (by this, I mean that the director decided not to cut this part out of the story lol).

For those saying it's not NTR, you're right, it's not. It's more that the audience got NTR'd instead of Satoru. 

But given how much the anime has been hinting and teasing at shipping/romance between him and Kayo (the anime is even more blatant than the manga about this), combined with all their relationship-building scenes, I think people have every right to feel upset. You can argue from a realism perspective (not realistic for Kayo to wait that long, and Satoru never claimed to have feelings for her anyway, and vice versa, and that Satoru's objective was to save lives, not get romance) that this is all acceptable, and I wouldn't disagree (especially since the characters themselves are happy), but from a storytelling perspective, it's probably not the most satisfying development for many people, also because we get almost nothing between Kayo and Hiromi in terms of relationship-building. And a side character like Hiromi of all people, lol.

So yeah, salt is justified. Keep it coming. 

(Personally, I have no strong feelings about this either way. It's good that Kayo has achieved some real happiness for herself, and I'm not really upset about the outcome, but I'm just stating the reasons why this may not be the case for others haha).

But even without the pseudo-NTR, this episode has other problems. They cut out most of Yashiro's backstory (the most important part, since that explains his motivations) as well as the Airi scenes. Now she's an even more irrelevant character.

As a manga reader, I cant wait for the reactions of this sub.

I swear if people start to dislike this show just because their favourite ship has sunk....

Edit: Ok, I didnt expect this.
>> ARTICLE
Non manga reader here and yeah I adored little Hina and Satoru together, but I'm really surprised coming into this comments thread that the majority of the comments seem to be either about the sunken ship or (deservedly tbh) how awesome his mum is. 

Like come one he just went 15 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE!. While still being in that weird revival thing like it completely changes whatever rules we thought about before. Hina getting knocked up by Hiroumi is honestly way down my list of surprises compared to how perfect this episode was in terms of story telling. All the small details and foreshadowing packed in were incredible.
>> ARTICLE
So at the start at the episode it was kinda implyed that Teacher is so involved in Satorou's life because he survived but then why was he also involved in the "original" timeline Satorou?
>> ARTICLE
He wasn't, Hiromi was his scapegoat to get out of being a suspect, and Hinazuki because she was always alone. His only fascination with Satoru was that he was the easiest person to create a suspect when he needed to off best mom, but when he evaded capture he decided to frame him to stop Airi when she saw a bit too much as he was also still the easiest to frame in the time and place. 

>> ARTICLE
I love how they changed up the OP animations, like how the censorship bars and Satoru getting shot disappeared. It's more foreshadowing, but tasteful in execution and subtle to the eye.

And Yashiro should go suck a big one. Not a lollipop, but a big fat donkey phallus.  
>> ARTICLE
Pointing something out: At the end of the opening the camera angle (POV) goes falling off the roof.
>> ARTICLE
Wow I thought the peeps on 4chan were screwing with me about the NTR lol. It makes sense anyway since it has been 15 years but I just can't understand why it's hiromi, should have been kenya.

Satorus mom is probably the best anime mom in existence at this point dude. I'm curious in how satoru actually survived though? did someone pull him out?  they'll probbaly go over it next episode.

Looks like kenya and the reporter dude are probably working together to take down yashiro, they only need satoru to remember.

Rip MAL score, not that it means much anyway

holy shit, people on mal are salty as fuck about kayo, seriously did they really think they would end up together?
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually kinda disappointed they reworked this a bit. I mean don't get me wrong, it was actually still a pretty good way to both abridge the story and keep the intimidation of Yashiro as consistent. But in the original manga, [Erased Manga Light Spoiler](/n "Satoru actually has his memories resurface after Airi sticks up for him when he's hounded by the paparazzi. It was a fantastic way of reintroducing Airi and furthering the plot. But hell, if the director changed this much of the end-game, then maybe she'll have a bigger scene later. I just miss her ),:")
>> ARTICLE
I can't possibly be the only one who expected Kayo to have married someone else. It's been 15 years for gods sake. I'd have been salty if she had just moped around waiting for Satoru to come back after all the guy did to save them and finally give them a chance at happiness.

So I just did the maths, 4 hours * 356 days * 15 years = 21900 hours.....

Fuck she's not only best Mum ever she's BEST FUCKING CHARACTER EVER.

Hamtaro just got dark. Joking aside I'm disappointed at the amount of people that missed the point of the anime. :/
>> ARTICLE
While I was watching that scene with Kayo, I couldn't help but tear up like Satoru. It is just a very bittersweet scene.

On one hand, he sees that he has given Kayo that future she deserves (no reference to her son hahahaha) and that his hardwork and sacrifice have not been in vain.

However, the full realization hits him that he lost a lot of things that could've been. He has missed all of his friends growing up and leading their lives. His mother has sacrificed 15 years to taking care of him and Kayo has gone to make a family.

The title (Boku dake ga Inai Machi = The Town Where Only I am Missing) is a very subtle foreshadow. It was even foreshadowed in the first episode when Satoru saved that kid but ended up in the hospital for a few days. Satoru saves so many people but he himself has to keep sacrificing himself to do so.

Even when he hadn't gotten his memories back, his realization when seeing Kayo grown up must have unconsciously made him 
tear up. So it was very heart-breaking to watch. (Though this is all just speculation on my part).
>> ARTICLE
Are people seriously complaining that Kayo ended up with Satorus friend?

Have you all forgotten that he was a 28 year old man in a body of a 10 year old? It would be extremely weird for him to actually end up in a relationship with Kayo. Plus he never intended on harboring any romantic interest in her, after all one of his goals was to get her the fuck AWAY from her mother, which would obviously involve her growing up somewhere else.

Did you guys just want her to fucking wait around? The fact that Kayo has a child is great, it shows that she has had a fulfilling and happy life even after the trauma she encountered in her childhood.

You guys take shipping WAYY too seriously, it's honestly asinine.
>> ARTICLE
So if Yashiro gets his next episode, there is only one unresolved plot line and that is Airi's in this timeline...

Airi clearly isn't the cancer patient Kumi that I can see--but I have a theory how she might be connected to Airi.

Remember when Kumi said she was getting bone marrow FROM HER SISTER.

Yashiro has balls of steel visiting the guy he tried to murder...

Did anyone notice how initially Kayo was the one who wrote "The Town Without Me" but it ended up being a town without Satoru for the past 15 years. 

I never enjoy seeing an MC getting cucked after literally putting his life on the line to save everyone. Though I don't put any blame on the characters since he was in a coma, but I still don't like the writing of it.

Satoru's mom is a beast. 

>> ARTICLE
Anyone else notice when they were in the elevator going up to the roof that Satoru pressed the roof button with his bare finger?
>> ARTICLE
Holy fuck Satoru's story is fucking tragic. Cursed with literally being forced to save people's lives even if he's not connected with them, has his mum killed because of one of these triggers, has a massive rewind to a time where he has to deal with hormones again (the bane of every mans life) and pretend to be 10 while being mentally a 28 year old. Then he has to piece together a murder plot without any clues to go on other than the victims, has to go through FUCKING UP after coming so close, goes forwards in time and has Pizza Girl give everything to try and keep him safe only to fail at the last hurdle, go back in time AGAIN to save all of the kids, then gets fucking dumped in a river and sent into a coma for 15 years, wakes up without any of his memories as a 28 year old, but knows how to read and draw incredibly well. Now he's being hunted by the press and his only hospital friend is obviously Yashiro's next target. Oh and now he is wheel chair bound with Yashiro - his mortal enemy - on top of a building, in the rain.

Satoru's life is like some sort of sick joke really.

Why is everyone so mad about Kayo x Hiromi? It was 15 years ago, they were in like 5th grade. It makes sense that they moved on a little bit. I'm just happy that (seemingly) everything worked out for Kayo the past years. Like pumping my fists in the air happy. Aghhh this show is really good.

They haven't happened yet. It was 2006 in the first episode, while this new timeline has Satoru wake up in 2003.

This anime can't be good for my health. I mean first I was sad because I thought his mom had to live without him, then we find out she's been taking care of him for 15 years, finally Kayo comes, which made me very happy, but she's with a baby. At that point I was so ecstatic for her, while another part of me was yelling "WHO DID IT!?" only to find out it was ~~Mr. StealYoGirl~~ Hiromi. I guess he's not the worse person to go with. I don't get why Satoru decided to tell teach he has his memories while they were alone. I mean I get that he can walk now, but I'm pretty sure he can't run or even walk for too long by himself.

Alternate ending confirmed. This is the first episode that almost completely deviates from the manga completely.

Both Anime-only watchers and manga readers are on uncharted territory.

What really made an impact on me was that he friends visits him after 15 YEARS. Like holy shit, those are some good friends
>> ARTICLE
Fuck, this episode was a rollercoaster.  
First of all, Sachiko is goddamn *dedicated* as a mother. She's pretty much on par with Sanae from Clannad and Hana from Wolf Children at this point.

Second, I was so torn at Kayo's introduction. I was like, "YES! She's alive and well!" but then "NO! She found someone else!" At least it was someone trustworthy like Hiromi though. If she just went off and fucked some guy we don't know I don't know if I could take it.

Also Yashiro is back. GOD. FUCKING. DAMMIT. Why you gotta ruin this man? Satoru was recovering and everything, he was getting his life back! Don't bring all your murdering bullshit here!

My SO finds it poetic that life was born between two people that would have died and didn't exist in the original timeline.

Yeah, that seems like a point the show was trying to make. The child was even named "Future."

Do the 4 types of the flowers in the hospital represent something?

I have a theory for the ending. Manga readers, do not confirm nor deny.

[Erased ending theory](/s "okay, so the doctor was on the phone and mentioned that "my patient isn't a mouse". I theorize that the "Revival" technology was something that was tested on Satoru and that explains the power and why he can't remember it in the original timeline")
>> ARTICLE
It's actually impossible for even manga readers to confirm your statement. They diverged a lot from the original manga. I know how the manga ends, but I have no idea what direction they will take the anime from this point.

Everything from the scene where he met Yashiro is completely anime-only.
>> ARTICLE
I'm very disappointed the author decided to go this direction. I'm not talking about the NTR, I was already spoiled on that.

What I'm disappointed about is the coma and amnesia. Two very deadly sins in writing. Plot devices that neither facilitate character development nor plot progression.

In this episode, the author uses them to essentially *reset* the scenario once the killer's reveal was finished since there was nowhere else to go from there. Satoru doesn't really develop without his memories and once he does get them back, he's the same person he was 15 years ago.

The coma is basically the author giving themselves room to come up with a new situation without restrictions presented by a main character. 

Noone wants to ask Satoru who dumped him in a freezing lake after he wakes up? I'm supposed to believe that the killer was able to move up that far in life and conveniently becomes the director of the hospital Satoru is staying at?

What really made this show hyped was the sheer amount of tension every episode had and it kept that ball rolling up until Hinazuki was safe. Saving her was suppose to tie in with his character arc of trying to validating his own life. Well now that she's out of the picture, the resolution that should have accompanied that moment has fallen flat.

Edit: Also we get no explanation for how Satoru even survived. 
>> ARTICLE
Well they did try to ask what happened to him, the doctor asked: "What's the last thing you remember?" At that point they know he has awful amnesia and can't tell them anything, even if they wanted him to. By the time he regains those memories he's with Yashiro.

Yeah it's realistic that she would get married to another person in the span of 15 years. I find it unrealistic that that person would be Hiromi. Of all the motherfuckers in Japan, *fucking Hiromi*. **WHY HIROMI**

Am I the only one who thought this was the biggest cliffhanger ending of the series? Sure, they may have ended off other episodes at much more dangerous/mysterious moments, but this was a truly hype part they ended at. It was like the entire series was building up to this one moment, and then it drops right there.


On another note I really like what they did with the opening. That was pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
Why the hell are people upset with Kayo being with Hiromi. Satoru never loved her even when they were children because he only wanted to prevent the deaths of the 3 children. Goddamn.

Unexpected direction to take and I love it! 

Was pretty great to see the cast grown up and I'm not even a little upset about the Hinazuki x Hiromi thing that happened.

This episode still kept the thrills up even after the whole reveal which was something I was worried about, glad it's continuing to knock them out of the park :)
>> ARTICLE
This episode once again proved how amazing of a mother Sachiko is. [Standing by Satoru's side for all those years](http://i.imgur.com/y7JcWJw.gifv) and not losing up hope is beyond commendable.

While many will most likely be disappointed that Satoru didn't end up with Kayo, the scene with Kayo showed that Satoru's efforts weren't in vain as Kayo was able to grow up and live a happy life. Although it's tragic, Satoru was able to somewhat break the cycle of killings in his town by sacrificing 15 years of his life.
>> ARTICLE
Everyone talking about Hiromi stealing Hinazuki and I'm just sitting here like "Hiromi was a boy???"

Well Satoru better at least end up with Airi 
>> ARTICLE
The hamster intro, Satoru missing from the OP, then the reveal of the (undisputed) Best Mom of the medium were stupidly amazing, the rest of the episode was OK with usual highs and lows, but that's what happens when you rush, and apparently the ending is anime original.  

As an anime-only person, anybody else got the vibe that Kenya became a lawyer just to help out with Satoru's case? That's why he came with that reporter friend. Truly a best bro.  

Raging over Kayo's situation is in all honesty the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. Seriously. Is that why the MAL rating is so inflated? Because people were shipping her with Satoru? That's the experience you wanted out of Erased? What the fuck is with this obsession over shipping anyway?





>> ARTICLE
Surely Yashiro wouldn't try anything when so many hospital staff members were able to see him wheeling Satoru around, right?

Surely he didn't do something about disabling security cameras so that he could go around unnoticed and make Satoru have "an unfortunate accident," *right*?

**Right?**
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of hints (having Satoru press the button for the elevator so Satoru's prints are there, wearing leather gloves to mask Yashiro's own prints...) that this has been planned I think.

It might be quite likely that it was Yashiro who called the doctor taking care of Satoru.

What an episode. I loved so many things about it: 

- Seeing Kayo chan happy is justice.

- Mom chan is best mom ever in anime.

- The reverse of having him be a young guy in an old mans body is beautiful. 

- Can't wait for next week after the return of his memories. Hopefully it will be wrapped up nicely!

- The rehab, the leukemia girl.. This anime is so real.

- The small parts and subtle hints with the tapping on the wheelchair, him sitting by the bed of leukemia-chan (next victim), ...

Bad parts: 

- The tears when Kayo came in where animated poorly, should have been less tears, it made the very powerful scene a bit ridiculous. 

- Have to wait a week :'(


Also can someone explain the string stuff? Like does he cut the strings of unhappy people or something?

This series consistently proves to have some of the best directing in anime. The removal of Satoru in the OP, his inner thoughts being a child instead of the usual adult because of the memory loss, the spider string at the end, and the exact right editing to make the "oh, fuck" moment perfect every time. 

Chills down my spine almost throughout the whole thing.

So who saved Satoru? Yashiro, right? That's what I got from the beginning anyway. 

Seeing Kayo happy was great.

Also, guess that's it for Airi too? The time we're in now is 3 years before the original "present" (2006 to 2003). Hoping Satoru can forge a better life for himself in these 3 years than working at a pizza place.

One of my favourite things in anime is where they use the melody line from the OP or ED in one of the shows soundtracks, but change the tempo and instruments to give the scene the correct tone. Yuki Kajiura NAILED this at the 19:05 mark, using the ED's melody line to build suspense.

(The other example I've memorised is at 3:45 in episode 10 of Railgun (Silent Majority) and at least one other occasion in that show, the OP's melody line is used to [Railgun ep 10 spoilers](/s "give us Uiharu's sense of despair from not being able to help Saten").)

Satoru's comment about courage was spot on at least for me. My courage only comes out when someone I care about or respect is in trouble.

Those tears of joy when Satoru saw Kayo grown up and happy almost made me cry too. I am not sure why a lot of people are mad about it. If something terrible had happened to me and left me in a coma for 15 years, I would want my boyfriend to move on and find happiness. It would really hurt me if I found out I was holding him back.

I liked how they had his younger self narrating during his memory loss.

I thought it was cute how Hiromi and Kayo ended up together. Satoru saved them both and they ended up spending their lives happily together!

I did not notice the absence of Satoru in the opening scene until I read the comments mostly because I only half pay attention to opening scenes toward the end of the series. I went back and rewatched it and HOLY FUDGE it was sad! :'(

Now we know why they called the series erased! :P

Had a chance to sleep on the episode now, and I've decided that it's maybe my second favorite episode, despite the fact that a lot of people are tearing into it.

Look, I get it. We all shipped Satoru x Kayo, well at least most of us did. I know I did. But frankly it would have been insulting to the memory of what Satoru did for Kayo for her to pine after him for 15 years. That would have been ridiculous. Instead, she was able to find happiness, which is beautiful.

Honestly, Hiromi x Kayo, I think it's beautiful. Sure he's "the trap", but seriously guys, just look past that. Hell people were willing to ship Hiromi x Satoru, but can't accept that he could be with Kayo? Come on. He's a good guy. And the fact that they're two people who were literally dead at the beginning of the story, and now they have a happy life and a child? Honestly it's great.

But, the other good points- all the feels when Satoru sees Kayo again for the first time. He may not have all his memories back (or maybe this is the moment when they start coming back) but he knows what she went through, and just knowing *she made it*. Wow.

I see that as sort of a culmination of what happened in episode 8, which off the top of my head might be my favorite episode, when Kayo breaks down after realizing just how much of her childhood has been stolen from her after spending one day with Satoru and Best Mom. Now Satoru breaks down when he realizes how much he was able to give back to her (even if he doesn't realize that he literally gave her back her entire life - unclear how much he remembers when)

I think what this episode shows best is the growth that Satoru has gone through as a person. At the beginning of the series, he is kind of a self-absorbed loner. He's not a bad person per se, but it seems like he basically has no friends and just keeps to himself. But now? Surrounded by people he cares about, and completely filled with determination. Working as hard as he can to recover, not just for his own sake, but as an inspiration to Kumi. Despite losing his memory and 15 years, just totally a more brilliant life.

Honestly? Having not read the manga, I really don't mind the direction this has taken. The most common complaints I see is that this is apparently NTR (it's not), and that [ERASED Manga Spoilers](/n "They cut out Airi from this episode, which is apparently supposed to be an integral part of the ending, as well as some sort of romantic attachment"). Once again, I haven't read the manga, but I've picked up that much from untagged spoilers. [ERASED Manga Spoilers](/n "I certainly would have liked more Airi"), but the way the story is going on right now is pretty self-consistent in its own right.

The other thing I've seen is that the "pacing" is off, or too rushed. And, once again, comparing it against only itself, not as a manga adaptation... I really don't see it? To me, things have been progressing fairly steadily, not introducing too much or skipping things I might have seen obvious. The Spider's Thread allegory fit pretty well [ERASED Manga Spoilers](/n "even though apparently the manga had more of Yashiro's background; I felt we got enough of his "motives" and the reason behind them without going more in depth"). So yes, at the end of the day, the adaptation of the ending is differing from the manga, but in its own right, I've really got no problems with it?

Idk, maybe I'm just blind.

I'm not even mad that Kayo ended up with Hiromi in the end. All I care about is that shes alive and happy after all the shit shes been put through.

But then of course, the Satoru x Kayo shippers will take it too far and change their opinion on the anime because of it. I don't understand why shippers take it so far anyway, the romance element in this anime isn't even the main focus.

I said on the last topic that the coma is where everything just starts to go downhill in terms of writing quality as the mangaka rushes to wrap up everything as quickly as possible for reasons known only to them, their assistants and the publisher supervising them.

Before i go into the show/manga and my problems with it in full though, i'm gonna just take a paragraph to talk about narrative, trope usage and pacing.

Ok, so traditionally, there's three sections to a story. The beginning, the middle and the end. Or to expand on that, the introduction to the scenario, characters and central conflict -> The escalation of the central conflict -> The climax and aftermath. The path to the final confrontation or whatever needs to be given a certain amount of time to present it's key points to the audience and allow them to process it. It can't take too long - getting lost on irrelevant tangents or scenes that drag on more than necessary - because your audience loses interest. You can't go too quickly because your audience will be confused or unable to form appropriate attachments that allow dramatic tension to occur. All the information you present in this build up needs to be relevant to the conclusion. Otherwise the previous acts become meaningless as a result and the conclusion loses the foundation it's supposed to provide a payoff to. (See [various vidya gam spoilers](/n "Mass Effect 3, Life is Strange, Deus Ex: Human Revolution..etc")

Erased basically threw out a lot of the build up it was working on when it put Satoru into a coma and gave him amnesia with a pre-climax climax. His personal growth was almost entirely deleted. His friends went through years of significant development off-screen without him. The development of Hinazuki's relationship with him is thrown under a bus. [Manga](/n "Airi comes back as a last minute love interest despite having almost no bearing on the plot, little to no romantic tension and no real reason to even be back at this point other than to provide an alternative to Hinazuki now that she got married off to a supporting cast member with even less screen presence than Airi off-screen. It even introduces another character who doesn't need to be around and puts Satoru into yet another coma.")

And my biggest problem with it is that it all could have worked, even questionable as the direction it goes in is in places. But the whole thing is just condensed so much at the end with no regard for how it got there that it just falls apart when you prod at it. If [Safe for this episode but spoilered just in case](/s "Airi and Satoru had more development and romantic development specifically their relationship at this point in spite of the amnesia would make more sense."). If there were chapters in between the main plot that developed the supporting cast in the absence of Satoru's presence both before and during his coma then their actions would make more sense after he recovers and lend more depth to the story/characters. And finally [Manga](/n "Satoru's powers are never really explored, or explained. Ever. It's just a framing device for the plot. No word on how it works, why he has it or when he started experiencing it.")


So, yeah. It's, to me, a waste of a good build up. Mini-Rant over, let the salt caked downvotes flow.

well its been an emotional ride... guess im gonna go sail somewhere else now..
>> ARTICLE
I hate the [amnesia danger trope](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiaDanger). It is beyond infuriating. That episode felt like a total waste of time except for the backstory on Yashiro. I'm going to drown a bottle of hamsters to blow off steam now.
>> ARTICLE
That whole bit about the spider thread was pretty cool.
>> ARTICLE
What in the fuck was this episode

ok someone explain the spider thread thing more clearly to me: does yashiro just love the thrill of cutting those threads, like he did with the hamster? Like thr thrill of giving false hope? But then why keep the hamster alive?

Also WHO SAVED YASHIRO??? Did the mom do it??? 

Also fuck you kayo for sinking my ship ;-;. 

Also I actually really loved that politician twist. Now THAT none of us saw coming. 

And is it just me or did the animation quality feel worse this episode? And I really liked that OP without satoru, very interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
Actually the politician twist made complete sense. Remember when he got arrested? He saw the killer and noted that he was a politician because he was working with the police to "apprehend" the murderer of Satoru's mother. So this just explains how he did it a bit more in depth.


>> ARTICLE
i havent read the manga but at least it seems like the teacher is facinated with people who exceed all his expectations. In the case with his previous plans i would see him as viewing it as a sort of sick comptetition. if he wins they die if he loses he gets caught. 
but what keeps him doing it is for the situations that cause his plan to fail seemingly beyond his control. in the hamster case its the survival of one of them in a situation that should have killed all of them. basically he likes toying with lives and is facinated when something defys his expectations.


then throw the monkey wrench that is satoru in there whos seemingly able to predict his every move and hes interested in that competition. taking down someone whos able to predict your every move is probably the rush he wanted and from a person he didnt even consider a threat. so he needs to know how exactly satoru operates and how satoru mind works.


at least thats how i see that  very short look into the killers mind im sure its explained in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
[As a manga reader](/n "I'm actually quite happy they changed the story that way. The last few manga chapters are quite boring compared to the rest. Now we are not getting the whole camp arc but who cares (I really don't) though the ending is probably going to be the same.")
>> ARTICLE
It was a really interesting choice to keep Satoru's child voice as his inner monologue even as an adult, where up until now it had only been the adult voice as the monologue for both his past and future selves.

Something we see firmly in this episode is the force of Satoru's will ( with the walking scene), and it solidifies him as such a strong and interesting character to watch.

However, I think the best part of his character, one which he got from his mother, is his kindness as seen when talking with that girl from the hospital.
>> ARTICLE
My god I was right and wrong at the same time. I thought he would wake up and there would be some epic confrontation/battle of the minds type thing but the way that episode went I didn't expect it to end like that. God I'm so excited for the finale
>> ARTICLE
at the moment I can't imagine an ending that will satisfy me. 
>> ARTICLE
I just realized that the anime can do anything they want in relation to what is in the manga. The anime could actually be a completely different timeline while still remaining true to the core of the story.  Or maybe I'm just justifying things.
>> ARTICLE
So this is what tvtropes was talking about. Given how much the anime has been hinting and teasing at shipping/romance between Satoru and Kayo (I haven't read the manga so I don't know whether  or not the anime is even more blatant about this) I can understand why people are turning into pillars of salt. 

Well at least best mom survived.
>> ARTICLE
I am rather annoyed at the fact they cut out many things and are going for an anime original ending, it was going so well and the anime made me read the mango, we'll see how this goes I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Hm what a shame, they butchered so much stuff, can't be helped being limited to 12 episodes, the touch on the opening was really nice though.
>> ARTICLE
They changed a good bit from the manga, and cut out all the stuff about Yashiro's brother. They could probably have made a full episode about Yashiro's past if they didn't cut anything. They are really pushing for a 12 episode series
>> ARTICLE
I've heard people mention that Airi was supposed to be somewhere in here in the manga. Can someone tell me what her role is up to the end of the episode? Seeing as she has no idea who Satoru is, I don't know why she'd be at the hospital.
>> ARTICLE
Heh, Satoru got ERASED from the OP... As did the black scribbles over characters' eyes.

A 15-year coma? Dayum.
>> ARTICLE
Better get a chance to live his life again lol. Coma for 15 years is his reward for everything he's done? I refuse to accept that.
>> ARTICLE
A small tip: If you want to read the manga, now is the best time. Manga goes in a LOT more depth, and many things that seem sudden in the anime are foreshadowed pretty well in manga. Chapter 24, page 28 is the best place to start for anime watchers. They cut out Yashiro's back story (which is pretty...unsettling).

To be honest, this anime should have been 18 episodes long instead of 12 if they want to cover everything in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Ok I remember someone in a previous thread noticing about the strange strings above their heads, but I don't think anyone came to a conclusion.. Now that we know that they really are spider strings, holy shit. It's all coming together. 
>> ARTICLE
So, on the one hand, I am extremely saddened by the fact that Hinazuki doesn't end up with Satoru. On the other hand, I can see why it makes sense that she doesn't. I mean, after 15 years... But still. 

Dammit. 
>> ARTICLE
I was unsure of how I would like the whole coma thing, but the show still blew me away. It keeps getting better and better. I don't know how I'll be able to handle it if Satoru doesn't end up with someone, it'll be too heart breaking.

As much as I love Konosuba, I think this is AOTS. Might be one of the best shows I've ever seen. I hope the conclusion is just as amazing as the rest of the series.
>> ARTICLE
Its bittersweet to see Kayo, especially how Satoru tells her that she is beautiful and all back in 1988. They had a thing going and it was adorable, scarily pedophilic, but adorable none the less.
>> ARTICLE
What the fuck is going on with the motivation of Yashiro. 

I am so conflicted over this. The NTR, the 15 years coma. I can't even figure out how I'm feeling about it. Though some crushing agony and some confusion is a given. 

And I was so afraid watching this after last episode's conondrum. 

Well, now that you're alive, go BACK IN TIME and fix my broken heart. 
>> ARTICLE
The anime kinda sorta botched Yashiro's backstory pretty badly. I'd recommend reading at least chapter 32 of the manga because it's the backstory chapter.

Here's a quick summary (manga spoilers incoming):

[Erased manga chapter 32](/n "When Yashiro was a child, his brother had a violent temper, which he would often take out on young Gaku. Eventually, young Gaku assists his brother by bringing girls to him, whom he...well...you can probably guess. Because of all of this, young Gaku learns the skills he uses to find the isolated children i.e. Hinazuki, Sugita, and Nakanishi. Also, he reads the Spider's Thread story mentioned in the anime and says 'what would Buddha do?' One day, the hamster incident the anime mentioned occurs, and then young Gaku's brother accidentally kills a girl whom he was with when he tried to keep her quiet while their mother was away. Young Gaku gets blamed for the whole thing by his brother, who punishes him by stealing the hamster's food. At this moment, young Gaku sees the Spider's Thread on top of his brother's head and decides to be Buddha and cut it by killing him; but in typical Yashiro Gaku fashion, it's believed to be a suicide. Gaku grows up, goes to college, and eventually gets engaged to a woman for mostly selfish reasons, but when she questions him about a recent murder of a child...he kills her (this is one of the worst things to come from the cuts; if you remember the scene where Satoru asks Yashiro why he isn't married, this provides an explanation that otherwise makes it feel like a throwaway, but maybe that's just me).")

[Later Erased Manga](/n "Also, a later chapter states that he murders because it makes him feel alive. Make of that what you will, but also realize that a lot of really interesting psychological stuff between Yashiro/Satoru is getting cut...")

[tl;dr Erased Manga](/n "Yashiro first kills his brother because he feels like the Buddha passing judgement on his sinfulness, then kills his fiancee to protect himself from her, then kills a bunch of kids because it makes him feel alive...in other words, he's a bit of a maniac.")

Sorry for that wall of text, but like I said earlier,  they left out A LOT. Heck, even the first time I read it, I wasn't completely sure exactly *why* Yashiro became who he was; I'm hoping the light novel will explain him even further.
>> ARTICLE
Kayo got a baby and is married at age 16? Damn. 
>> ARTICLE
The strings are finally explained!!
>> ARTICLE
So if Satoru had been in a coma for 15 years does that kid from the first episode get hit by that truck because no one was there to save him. How many people died because of this?
>> ARTICLE
That hasn't happened yet. Show started in 2006, 18 years after Kayo was murdered. He was only in a coma for 15 years.

 [Thoughts on the episode, Gundam Zeta spoilers](http://i.imgur.com/hNpOOEa.png)
>> ARTICLE
Wow, they adapted 11 entire chapters (1/4th of the manga) in 1 episode. And... it didn't seem weird as an adaptation... a little bit rushed at the end.

But so much as been lost, I really liked chapter 32 of the manga. It's the chapter that I was the most unconfortable with, but the chapter gave a lot of depth to Yashiro's character. A lot of character development from Kenya and Airi was also cut from these 11 chapters.

I'm not entirely unhappy about all these change of events from the manga to the anime, the show is still good.

--------------------------------------------------

I recommend to all anime-only watchers is that when the anime ends, from chapter 27 till 44 (ok, may be starting from 32) it's an entirely different experience. The first volume was also rushed into episode 1.

Nevertheless, this doesn't mean I hate the anime. It did a really good job adapting the manga from episode 2 till 9. 

The other episodes were good too, they weren't as faithful to the manga, but overall, the anime did quite well, it's a shame it ends next week.

My heart was in my throat for that entire conversation between Satoru and Yashiro.

He should've kept his mouth shut, god damn it. He could've played it off. He can't fight him off! :c

Just to be clear, did the teacher 'save' him when he was drowning? Sounds like it from the last bit of the hamster backstory
>> ARTICLE
I also like how they took Satoru out of the opening theme
You could say he was... ERASED
>> ARTICLE
Well I think its normal that some people are  going to be dissapointed that kayo build a family with hiromi instead of waiting 15 year for satoru since we "know more" than the characters.

He basically sacrificed his "youth" for his friends  (Who ironically get together and get a child),has pretty much nothing except his mom and get treated like a lolicon (from those paparazis).

 That just provokes the feeling of "betrayel" or beeing left behind,even though it is more logical this way than the "happy ending."

Overall i am sad,that it feels like satoru is just left behind , and happy that they dont go with the "happy - romance " cliche.

/E: I think this anime shows a good amount of Problems in our society  (f.e beeing left behind, child abuse,cliche etc)


>> ARTICLE
Seeing Kayo again made me happy. My only gripe is that Yashiro's backstory could have been more fleshed out. I haven't read the manga but I hear they cut a lot regarding this. The explanation we got just makes him sound crazy - I assume there's more to it than just "lol I kill hamsters and now girls, because reasons".

Otherwise, I've liked everything else about the show so far.
>> ARTICLE
Damn! Satoru vs Yashiro Round 2 begins!

So much hype!

I really loved how they edited the OP. Giving the real meaning of the title "Erased" or "The Town Without Me"

>> ARTICLE
It's interesting how he expresses his thoughts with the child voice now. Before, he was a man inside the body of a child. And then he was in a coma for 15 years, so he woke up essentially as a child...inside the body of a man.
>> ARTICLE
So... I've kept relatively away from posting on ERASED, as I was interested to see what everyone thought of it, as well as wanting to see how the anime decided to approach the ending, as we got near it.  As a manga reader, I will say this - ep 11 is nearly completely different from the source material in terms of progression, and ep 12 will likely be the same.  The only thing I know is that the ending will be the same, if not, similar to the manga based on what I recall reading.  With that out of the way, lets dive into this world without Satoru (for the past 15 years).  

____________

We start off with a monologue from Yashiro-sensei.  I truly disliked this shortened version of how he was portrayed.  It pretty much made him out to be a crazy killer who can't control his urge to kill.  Sure, the manga made him out to be somewhat crazy as well, BUT he was also normal in many ways.  He was shown able to function as a member of society almost scarily well, especially given his ability to move up from being a teacher to a council member.  Here, its just a two-faced guy who, we are suppose to believe, is able to contain his murderous intents when he sees a spider thread above a person.  If you wish to learn about his backstory, read Ch 32 in the manga.  

Now that the semi-filler 2 min of backstory for Yashiro is taken care of, we got the OP to analyze.  The intro with the black and white theatre room symbolizes Satoru's "revival", with the adult Satoru looking bored and the child Satoru very eager and excited.  This can be seen as how his "revival" is his memories being given to his past self, therefore the adult Satoru has no control over the situation, and passes on his will/beliefs to the child Satoru to act on.  Given that both versions of Satoru are missing, it means this is a new future and [slight spoiler](/n "revivals are no longer possible.")  We then get some scenes with child Satoru missing, indicating how he was ERASED.  The mirror reflection of adult Satoru and the flood, as people previously mentioned, hinted at the end of ep 10, but I personally think there is a bigger message.  That is the guilt and pain which catches up to adult Satoru.  Given that Satoru tried his hardest during his "revival", its safe to say that he has no regrets, and therefore would not be drowning in guilt.  

Following this scene are the film rolls of people's faces.  Previously, their eyes were scribbled over, but now they're gone.  Followed by the fact that Satoru's dark silhouette which showed his suffering is now gone, this means Satoru's actions have prevented the regrets or troubles of people involved in this incident.  

I quite like the next scene, as we see Satoru's mother, Airi, and Kayo with a bright background of a tree, which gives this warm feeling.  In a way, they are what keeps Satoru moving ahead, giving his all to achieve what he sets out to do.  Compare this to the previous version, where we see adult Satoru looking downwards, as if to say he is remorseful for being unable to prevent misfortune from falling on those who trust him.  The background then shifts to adult Yashiro, and theres a minor but neat change, where you see all three of them having a spider web hanging above their head.

We then proceed to see the scenes pre-"revival".  With Satoru missing however, they take on a new meaning.  Previously, they further emphasized Satoru's regret and desperation at being unable to save them.  Now, the clocks tell the story of time rewinding where this did not happen.  

The last scene I want to talk about is the roof top with the bullet.  The old OP showed Satoru getting shot, and if you look carefully, you can see Yashiro being the one shooting (of course we wouldn't find out this was Yashiro until this episode).  Looking at this literally, you can say Yashiro tries to kill Satoru, and yes, that is true.  But I think the more subtle message is that Yashiro has changed.  Instead of how he ended up in Satoru's pre-revival, Yashiro came to an understanding to some extent.  

Just analyzing the OP was longer than I expected, so I will post the rest of my thoughts on this episode in a reply.  

>> ARTICLE
Really liking this, only regret is that they didn't allot this show 24 episodes instead.
>> ARTICLE
Wow typical story about how the killer killed animals first. I wish we didn't always see something like this.

Satoru isn't in the opening anymore. Is like he's been......erased. That's freaky. A nice touch by the people behind this.

Has he been in a coma all this time from the 80s to 2003? When the anime first started it was 2006 wasn't it? So being dumped in the stream left him in a coma? I hope we get filled in.

Damn she really is best mom to make sure his joints and muscles were okay for when he woke up.

Notice it's the other way around now. Over the course of this series his thoughts were voiced by his 29 year old self. Now it's being done by his 8 year old self. Ah it seems the incident removed his adult memories.

It's adult Kayo! Yes! He did it! Kayo's lived to become an adult!

There he is. The damn bastard. Come to ruin Satoru's life more I see!

He's doing it again. Leading Satoru away from people. Bad politician sensei!

He's gonna push him off the roof! Just like in the opening! Oh my goooood!

His memories are back! That means he probably remembers Revival as well!

I NEED MORE AIRI C'MON

finally another really good episode.

Anime Original. Where my Airi !

Come on. I came here for theories about why the sensei had gloves when he was on the little girl's room, and people just noticed when he was on the elevator.

Did Yashiro kill the girl?
>> ARTICLE
Im not mad that kayo and hiromi ended up together but Im also not happy. Im just ehhh. The relationship and connection kayo and Satoru had felt so real. I really thought Satoru and kayo were going to meet up in the future and live happily ever after. 

But he did accomplish what he set out to do. He saved his mom and  saved his two friends. I also think its beautiful in a way that the two people that he saved ended up being together and created new life. 

but still, i still cant get over this disappointing feeling. I feel so empty inside. I hope they can fill my emptiness and end the series on a high note. 
I hope it isnt another true tears where ill stay heart broken for days after the ending. 
>> ARTICLE
Kayo.... just, no. We held hands together...WE HELD HANDS TOGETHER!!!
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else notice the absence of his two other friends?

The fat guy, Aya Nakanishi and the nerd
>> ARTICLE
Can we all agree the anime is better than the manga? 
>> ARTICLE
 Think it's possible he's been remembering things sooner than has been shown. When he first woke up, he didn't remember several people. This included Kayo. But when he first met with Kayo again, he remembered her straight away. He remembered both Hiromi and Kenya pretty much straight away also. So he's been getting his memories back a lot quicker than the show lets on. So the question simply is, WHEN did Satoru remember about Yashiro? It's pretty obvious that it was before the final scene. I do wonder if it was when Kenya brought The reporter to see Satoru and that's when they devised this plan to expose Yashiro. So little was made of that scene yet the reason the reason was to bring Yashiro down. 

Kenya becoming a lawyer makes perfect sense because he knew Satoru telling him about a serial killer originally was probably correct. So I imagine he's been waiting for this day for a long, long time now.

Great episode for me, pulled on the feels quite a bit.  Until we saw him in a coma it was really heart-breaking thinking he possibly died and his mother has been without a son all those years, it was relieving to see he was till alive *phew*.  I'm damn excited to see how this all wraps up, can I just fast-forward life to next week pppleeeeeeeassse?????

So that's how they're going to fit the end of the manga into the last 2 episodes...they're going to change the ending entirely? Wtf?

I really don't want spoilers for the ending, but is it okay if I ask you what happened differently after I watch the final episode next week?
>> ARTICLE
The manga isn't super long. I read most of it in a night.
>> ARTICLE
I dun wanna spoil anything til the episode, but I'll certainly be checking out the manga later if this anime ends well enough. Honestly this show has had me hooked since episode one, and whether or not this hype leads to a must buy or disappointment all depends on if it can close well. The ending of this last episode felt a little off, I felt it needed a bit more of a dramatic *hey he just remembered* moment besides a zoom up of the tapping and him just plainly stating he remembers, but we'll see what happens. Honestly I'm still half expecting another revival to the past, but that also feels like not at all what the series would actually go for.

Also, as much as I'm pleased by the surprise otp, I'm still a little bummed about my previous ship. She was even acting like the fact that things went the way they did bugs her, but as long as everyone ends up happy I'll be fine.

Please... Please let them all end up happy... The coma was bad enough... I really need this...
>> ARTICLE
Sure. I think a bunch of people will comment on it next week.

Also, to be completely honest, an anime original ending COULD be an improvement on the manga's ending.
>> ARTICLE
Exactly. The manga ending was void of excitement and tension.
>> ARTICLE
I was really curious where they'd go with the show after last episode. [As I wrote about that episode](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/03/10/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-10-no-climax/), it didn't really feel like a climax, because of the delivery, and I wondered what they'd do now that they've done away with the protagonist and us still having two episodes left. Then after Yashiro's monologue at the beginning, I actually thought that after Satoru's proclamation, he saved him from drowning, like the hamster, and kept him in a cage, to ply him from his knowledge. Well, the reveal about 6 minutes in worked. They dragged it on and on, and it was effective, so good job there.

Speaking of effective versus non-effective, or rather "Effective versus overbearing," [look at Sachiko's tears](http://i.imgur.com/ITKE4iC.jpg). A heart-felt moment, I teared up myself. When it comes to tears, less really is more. Unlike what we got when Satoru was crying, which had me chuckling a bit, because, [I mean, just look at it](http://i.imgur.com/f9Ol0Eq.jpg) :P Also in that scene, I can't really tell if adult Hinazuki is voiced by Yuuki Aoi or not. Half the time she sounds like her, and half the time not. I like this voice. I wish anime voice acting were more naturalistic in general, y'know? Just as I like Hayami Saori a lot more when it's natural.

Ok, moving from production to themes, an interim spot that continues directly from voice acting is the voice. Up until now we've had adult Satoru's voice for adult Satoru, and his thoughts, whether as a child or as an adult. But now we've got the reverse, an adult body with the child's inner voice. The show is telling us that it really is child Satoru inside that body now. Not child Satoru that grew up and was trapped in his adult body all along (because him never having grown up is quite a theme in this show), but truly the child. Helpless and weak. The use of the coma is also interesting, because it's as if he's traveled 15 years into the future, eh?

And like any story about time-travel, or any generational story, it's all about everything repeating itself. [We've had Yashiro's monologue at the start](http://i.imgur.com/hXt2Icj.jpg) (also, note what it says about his world-view, surviving at the expense of another), [and then him *taking Satoru on a ride*](http://i.imgur.com/oebDifC.jpg), and making sure to put his gloves on before pressing a button, and then having Satoru press the button to the roof, so *his* fingerprints would go there. Yashiro's monologue last episode made it clear that to him it's all about the *cycle*, that he has to repeat these actions each time because it's the best moment of his life, anew. And we've known it, since Satoru's mother identified him in 2005. So, that's one cycle repeating, and one of the least interesting ones.

The more interesting cycle is where Satoru is still himself. On the simplest of levels, he sees a lonely girl (whom Yashiro notices as well), and he befriends her. Simple as that. But look at his interactions with his mother, "[mother was trying to avoid the topic of my past](http://i.imgur.com/NazhISA.jpg)," came first, and then we've had the capitulation to this request, "[If that's what mom wants, then maybe I don't have to remember](http://i.imgur.com/o6LmQ57.jpg)." And this is the show's original sin all over again. This all started with Satoru having a hole within himself because he was told to forget about the murders that went on when he was a child. Because he was told to remain ignorant and a child, so he couldn't move on.

So here we are, with Satoru being told to just take it easy and forget once more. But there is a different, the "revival" was a time-leap fueled by Satoru remembering, and then becoming unwilling to forget and let bygones be bygones. We see that change carry over to the present, [with him being determined to walk forward on his own](http://i.imgur.com/dntNv6z.jpg), [even if it hurts](http://i.imgur.com/QoNlmde.jpg). It's time to join the land of the living, not hide as a delivery-guy in a pizza joint.

And of course, a combination of all of the above, Satoru still sees himself as a hero of sorts, and is definitely a child inside. I mean, how else would you explain that really dumb move he's pulled as the show ended, where he's alone with a serial kidnapper-killer on the roof, and he tells him he remembers his true nature? I mean, *really*, Satoru? Though I guess this could be explained in one of two ways. The cynical way would be to say, "This is the penultimate episode's cliffhanger, so they wanted to end on a crazy note," so he's acting stupid because this is what moves the plot forward, raises the stakes the most. The second way takes his decision to move forward using his own power, on his own, and having him face the killer as he always intended to. And yes, he's a naive child, but the show hammered that long enough for it to be believeable. Believeably unbelieveably stupid of Satoru.

Having read time and time again that this episode would be a trainwreck before seeing it myself, I can't help but wonder what everyone was getting bent out of shape over. I can understand being upset that Satoru x Kayo didn't end up happening, but Kayo and Hiromi having a family makes more sense than Kayo waiting 15 years for someone she knew in elementary school. I don't think it's really bad writing, let alone something that would ruin the entire show. Then again, it's not as though I needed another reason not to let what the hivemind thinks affect my opinion of a show.

Of course, there's still another episode to go before it's over, so I could wind up being wrong. I don't know how the source material ended, but it seems that some people think it will be different here in the show. I'll have to wait until next week before I formulate my own opinion on which is better.

Kayo didn't wait for MC kun. Worst girl 
>> ARTICLE
Alright, Satoru being **Erased** from the OP was pretty freaking awesome. I always love when a show changes their OP/ED, like JoJo does when they add SFX.

I guess I'll be giving somewhat live reactions, because there's things that I doubt I'll remember to say at the end. I love how we've always had an adult inner voice inside of a kid, but now we have a kid's inner voice inside an adult. 

No! Why would you tell him that your memories are back?! Not while you're alone on a rooftop!

Kayo with her baby was probably the most impactful part of the episode for me. I don't particularly care for sustaining whatever chemistry there was between Satoru and Kayo (when they were 11..) because this, in my opinion, is so much better. I couldn't help but think "Damn, it's like he saved an extra life". One of the things I love the most about Satoru as an MC is that he's truly happy just to see everyone turn out okay, even if it means he has to make sacrifices or he doesn't receive any reward. If he were to 'get the girl' I think it would take away from that. The point is, he's the reason another human being was able to life a fulfilling life and bring another person into the world. That's flipping magical. The entire scene was brilliantly bittersweet, I don't think it could have been done any better. 
>> ARTICLE
Everybody upset about the SatoruxKayo thing when what they don't realize is that it's hard for a ship to sink when it was never sailing in the first place. Kappa
>> ARTICLE
My ship just sunk.Maybe worse then Titanic lol.
>> ARTICLE
It has been a privilege shipping with you. Now lets go board the SS Airi 
>> ARTICLE
The intro was something else, the prelude was fascinating.

To be honest though, the time skip worried me. Up until he met with Kumi, I really didn't know if this was going to work. There's certainly some odd plot holes, but overall, this episode was way better than I was expecting it to be.
>> ARTICLE
When one vehicle goes down, two ships are sunk~ (He never met Airi)

Interesting that Yashiro chooses not to kill him for 15 years, he must be interested in knowing the whole revived phenomena.

>> ARTICLE
At first I liked how the manga was edited (Yashiro's backstory is extremely uninspired after all), but the ending scene wasn't written very well. I wonder whether it'll be an original ending now.
>> ARTICLE
I thought this was paced really, really fast.  I expected the episode to end either on Satoru waking up, or when Kayo walked in.

I suppose its expected when you only have two episodes to work with.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone have a count on how many chapters they adapted this episode and how many are remaining?
>> ARTICLE
Damn that Alternate OP was both cool and sad at the same time!

edit: Also Satoru you a fucking idiot.  You dont tell the 15 year old killer that you remember hes the killer when you are alone, on a roof, in a wheel chair.  Your just asking yourself to be killed at that point.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, no problem at all. Just a normal mostly disabled guy  being brought up to the roof. No problem. Just gonna tell a murderer that I remember how I almost died **straight to his face.**
>> ARTICLE
Tfw they said it will be same ending manga-anime and it obviously isnt... FeelsBadman also i feel like so much things got rushed in the 2-3 last episodes and there was some good stuff like more of yashiro backstory :/
>> ARTICLE
Everything went SO different compared to what I expected this episode to go after the one last week.


>> ARTICLE
Hana step aside, we have a new best mum of all time.
>> ARTICLE
One more episode, and this is where we stand? Really don't know how they're going to pull it off, as it already diverted from the manga, or so I've heard. Pretty interesting episode though, the way he boldly accepted going to the roof with Yashiro alone and exclaiming he regained his memories was kind of a shock to me.
>> ARTICLE
Where can I see this episode?
>> ARTICLE
Still best mom. As always a good execution-

But damn this was fast. A bit salt for all :D
Kind of a coincidence that Kayo married Hiromi(?)
And Yashiros backstory was also cut a bit I guess. So what was his motivation after all? Airi was also cutted. I think the quality dropped a bit since the second half of the serie, but nonetheless it's good. 

Curious how they will finish this. After all this was an anime original ending after 17min right?

>> ARTICLE
I'm just sitting here wondering wouldn't it have been easier for yashiro to kill satoru while he was in a coma?
>> ARTICLE
Well, that would be kinda obvious though. Someone in a coma dying out of nowhere. Now that he has awakened and is able to walk, he could give it a suicide spin.
>> ARTICLE
Despite having this spoiled for me by accident, im still salty.   Hiromi like a submarine sinking my ship from below.  Oh well, it does make sense in a way.
>> ARTICLE
There were so many emotions swirling around in this episode. As someone who has had to take care of someone when they couldn't take care of themselves my hat is off to Sachiko, she truly is the best anime mom I've ever seen.

I don't think I've yelled this much at episode of anime in a long time because as soon as I saw Yashiro show up I immediately jumped out of my chair. Just fuck him to hell and back, he couldn't be trusted then certainly can't be trusted now. I'd say Satoru has some guts to allow himself to be secluded on the roof top with him and telling him he has his memories back, especially since even though he's gotten better at walking he still has a hard time with it. What I'd like an explanation for is how he survived Yashiro's attempt at killing him in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
This show offers an interesting dilemma. We are sad that he was in a coma for so long, but at the same time he already got to live those years once before. So my feelings on it are confused. 

Now the crazy theory is that if he defeats the teacher will he snap back to his old life. (who knows maybe with the time altering and no coma having he will end up with Hinazuki)
>> ARTICLE
Satoru seems like a really sensible person, telling a murdered that he knows about his actions (and no one else does) when he is alone with that person...
>> ARTICLE
[Best. Mom.](http://i.imgur.com/0iHCjva.jpg)

I got choked up when I saw her all alone in the beginning. Also seeing all his friends that he saved/helped in saving was so heartwarming. Then Kayo showed up. I was definitely salty when Kayo got married but then when I saw Satoru smile and be happy for her, it all went away. This was a FANTASTIC episode.
>> ARTICLE
I did not expect that, although I was practically screaming with joy at seeing Kayo again. Hell, I was ecstatic that everyone survived that.

The thing is, I felt that this episode felt... a bit rushed. Not surprising considering that it's episode 11 already. Maybe an OVA would explain more?

I have no fucking idea how the anime can cover whatever just happened in this episode, in the next episode. 
>> ARTICLE
the thing about this episode feeling rushed is that according to the people who read the manga they had to cover 6-7 chapters in one episode. and apparently there are 7 more chapters to go (though people are mentioning that they are skipping an arc of sorts)

of course they probably cut out 1-2 chapters already but they also had to change some events to keep focus on the finale.
>> ARTICLE
Best anime mom

Waited all season just to watch this episode. Worth it
>> ARTICLE
I CANT HANDLE THIS SHOW ANYMORE!
>> ARTICLE
This episode flew by rather quickly. Wonder whats going to happen next episode, how it'll unfold and end. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright so at the start of guess Yashiro was giving some insight into his motives. I don't completely understand what he was going on about. Anyone fill me in?
>> ARTICLE
perfect stage for a final boss battle
>> ARTICLE
Since the purpose of an anime is usually promoting the source material, I think they have succeeded. They are adapting the manga to the end, but I still feel I'm missing many things. So I'm convinced to read the manga after I finish the show.

For the episode, I think I have mixed feelings about it.
>> ARTICLE
Hey guys, look! Kayo and Satoru have kids after the time leap! =D
>> ARTICLE
So is the Airi ship still going strong? She doesn't seem to have appeared and with one episode left I fear she won't play into it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm loving the attention to detail with all the subtle changes in the opening and small hints in the actual episode. Easily my favorite ep so far and totally cleared out any suspicions I had after the last ep of this going to a worse direction. I might end up loving this series if the rest is like this episode was.
>> ARTICLE
I guess we are going towards an anime original ending, that was to be expected with only 12 episodes I guess
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga

I knew this coming.

But I'm still kinda angry at this. Like fuck I know Satoru isn't mad so I shouldn't be. But Fuck. WHY?


>> ARTICLE
The shock with him not in the op, omg.

nice episode.. but I cant believe its going to end next episode right?? it feels like there needs  to be like 3-4... one if they want to end it.. one for some more story.. there is just so much loose like what happened with pizza girl? 
>> ARTICLE
Nice, tell the killer I got my memories back, chat with him, what the fuck is wrong with him, and what was that whole thread thing all about? the spider analogy or is some kind of trap?
>> ARTICLE
So guys, remember when everyone was freaking out about Yashiro being shown in the OP as a reflection in the broken glass?

Yeah, think about what that part of the opening means, considering they showed Satoru being flooded just before that.

[Speculation on the anime-original ending](/s "I reckon Yashiro is just gonna shoot Satoru and be done with it.")  


http://imgur.com/9oYTzYP for reference.
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else notice in the OP that there's a scene in first person that jumps off the roof of a building? Could that be the same foreshadowing as the water in the school when Satoru originally drowned? I hope he doesn't get thrown off..
>> ARTICLE
I really liked the spider thread thing, and how it was foreshadowed so early in the show. 
>> ARTICLE
Only if they showed the part of Yashiro's backstory about [Manga Spoiler](/n "his pedo brother") and [Manga Spoiler](/n "that Satoru has unintentionally foiled his plans before the whole Kayo situation"). 

Ah well maybe they will...or not.
>> ARTICLE
Buckle in folks it's live reaction time! Spoilers ahead obviously.

1. Oh damn, is that a real myth? Japanese mythology is hardcore. That bit about Yashiro seeing people connected by spiders thread was pretty spooky and serial killery.

2. The OP Where Only I am Missing. In all seriousness, that was oddly chilling.

3. Goddamn Satoru's mom is the best. I was scared that sequence of her going through her everyday life without Satoru and playing his Masked hero theme song was going to end with her visiting his grave. I am so glad that it didn't go that way. Ms. Fujinuma a best.

4. KAYO IS FINE! I'm so happy that she's alive and well. Sure the Satoru x Kayo ship is sunk but as long as she's happy that's fine by me. Good to see that Yashiro has kept his psychotic, yet fashionably-gloved hands off of her.

5. Satoru is such a trooper, asking for double rehab. I'm also really glad that Kenya and Hiromi came to see him while he's in the hospital.

6. Oh great a little girl with cancer, because ERASED needed more ways to toy with my emotions.

7. Speak of the devil, it's Yashiro! At least he gave those reporters that were stalking Satoru what for, but I'm pretty sure that was just to minimize photo evidence.

8. Oh shit they're going to the roof alone! Satoru this would be a great time to get your memories back!

9. Someone call the rescue helicopters because I am hanging from a cliff here.
>> ARTICLE
I recall a thread a few weeks ago that pointed out and questioned what looked like "lines" attached to some characters heads. That was an extremely good catch.
>> ARTICLE
a cool part of this episode is the alternating of satoru's VAs, normally it had been him using his older voice when thinking in his head, and his younger voice when speaking out loud (whenever he went back in time), this episode had him speaking in his younger voice in his head and older voice out loud, very in tune with how he lost his memories and he is basically a kid in an adult's body
>> ARTICLE
Did I miss something? How did Satoru escape the car? At the beginning, I thought we were seeing his mom carry on for a couple days b/c Satoru said he was going to be late and then I thought she was going to completely break down when she went to the door frame and instead we see a sickly Satoru that's been in a coma until 2003?

I mean did the anime just skip over this? I'm so lost. If it was explained in the manga and not the anime, just tell me that, but don't spoil the manga b/c I'm going to read it after this show is over.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
ok thanx
>> ARTICLE
I can't find my heart. Maybe I swallowed it after so much fear trough the whole chapter.
>> ARTICLE
I guess I  would have had to read the Manga but leaving out how he was rescued from the water leaves me feeling a bit cheated.  I'm curious to see how this ends.  
>> ARTICLE
I personally am disappointed at the relationship between Satorou and Kayo simply because when they were kids it looked so promising and now it just died. I also hoped Satorou would go back in time and save the last girl and himself so that he can return to KAyo but nooooo...FU fans. jk^^

>> ARTICLE
Nobodies talking about the doctor on the phone outside of satorus room, I wanna know what the significance of that was.. Who's the person on the other end and what were they suggesting that made satoru seem like a mouse??
>> ARTICLE
i couldn't hold back and started reading ahead in the manga, the anime skipped a scene i really wanted to see... seems like they really are changing it a bit for whatever ending we will have next week... 
>> ARTICLE
They literally changed the plot and cut out 10+ chapters.
>> ARTICLE
no real other way to cram that many into a few episodes... oh well
>> ARTICLE
THAT WAS NOT 20 MINUTES! WHERE IS THE REST!? Gaaa! great show!
>> ARTICLE
Yipee and anime only ending.....
>> ARTICLE
I get it now Satoru really is in Hell. This can't be real.
>> ARTICLE
Only thing I keep thinking of is that Satoru technically is still "in the past". Any minute now he will wake up into some kind of strange version of the future where he once belonged.
>> ARTICLE
Anybody else think that the phone placed in Kumi's room might be used somehow by Satoru while he is on the roof?
>> ARTICLE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5loKwPgWYI

>> ARTICLE
From the interactions between Satoru and Yashiro, I think I was internally screaming this entire episode. 
>> ARTICLE
[The whole ride for me.](http://i.imgur.com/YVMMK3W.gif)
>> ARTICLE
The moment he said roof, I assumed he was going to get pushed off.

Even in the opening, the final scene the camera supposedly falling off the roof. Which looks exactly like the roof of the hospital. If he gets pushed off I swear.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Satoru's mom [haven't aged through the years](http://imgur.com/gallery/OcRKK).
>> ARTICLE
Also, as an anime-watcher only, Satoru ending up being in a coma felt like [Life Is Strange spoiler](/n "that timeline in the game Life Is Strange where Max changed Chloe's dad's fate and Chloe ends up being severely disabled...")

My feels ;_;
>> ARTICLE
I see the black gloves, I see him pushing UP on the elevator...  and asks him to push "ROOF"

*DAMN THIS MF IS GONNA PUSH HIM OFF THE ROOF AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HE COMMITTED SUICIDE*

"I HAVE MY MEMORIES BACK" 


EPISODE ENDS -- GODDAMIITTTTT!
>> ARTICLE
I like how instead of him using revival to go to the future he just takes a 15 year nap. This is one of the few shows that never disappoints episode to episode, every episode always has something to add.
>> ARTICLE
I have a theory about the ending. 

I think Satoru got his memory back when he touched Kayo's baby, and eventually talked with Kenya about it, hence the rather random reporter (mom's old co-worker) appearance. 

The reporter must've started investigating Yashiro back then, and probably Yashiro will be arrested before he pushes Satoru from the roof.
>> ARTICLE
Satoru! Cause you slept 15 years Hiromi saw a chance and stole your girl! You fkd up and a big time didnt ya!

Jk jk, i just really hoped all the time that Satoru's and Kayo's relationship would evolve to something more but oh well.
>> ARTICLE
This episode was a joke, right?
Firstly, Satoru was an adult in child's body. Now he is a child in adult's body?

>> ARTICLE
THE FRONT PAGE LITERALLY HAS KAYO AND SATORU LEANED IN TOGETHER WHAT THE FUCK. I cry every time ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Well that's an ironic reversal.

Going a 29 yo to 10 yo isn't as bad as the reverse. At least you're still aware of what's to come in the future. During this episode, he pretty much had to act as an adult while he still had the mentality of a child.

That being said, I can't help but feel that a lot of content was heavily rushed. Satoru only had his amnesia for a max of 15 mins of screen time(he probably remembered everything way before he went up the rooftop and told Yashiro). Seems like there is very little chance for complete closure of his relationship with the other characters(Yuki, Kayo, his group of friends, mom). We don't even know what happened to Kazu and Aya afterwards either. I was also expecting more of a build up before the final confrontation between Yashiro vs. Satoru.

I hope we don't get trolled and Satoru goes "Yeah I remember that you had a sweet tooth. Kappa"
>> ARTICLE
That cocky son of a bitch. Just casually reintroducing himself. 
>> ARTICLE
Did Airi ever mention having a sister, I wonder if it could be Kumi?
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of sad that they're rushing to fit all of the manga into 12 episodes... I feel like they missed a lot of important parts.
>> ARTICLE
wow took me a moment to realise the change to the OP, nice touch.

Also, Hinazuki, you're dead to me, your meant to wait forever /s

1 episode to go, hope we get to go back (er forwards?) in time to the proper future with the teacher caught and everything be all good and everything, but its not looking like that, will be interested to be able to finish reading the manga after next week
>> ARTICLE
heh. my heart sank when i saw hinazuki. part of me was happy but i was generally just saying... 'who's baby is that'... no way. omg. 
>> ARTICLE
and he's back, ladies and gentlemen! He made a recovery! He can kind of walk now, and he has his memories back! Will we see his signature time leap again? We will know shortly in this most epic of showdowns. Please stay tuned for round 11 of the match of the century!
>> ARTICLE
Wait, guys. If he still thinks in his younger voice, do you think the revival isn't over?
>> ARTICLE
Did this episode feel really rushed to anybody else?
>> ARTICLE
Wtf how was that 20 minutes?! Felt like 2 minutes max...
>> ARTICLE
God but was that intro unsettling.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that he and Kayo didn't end up together is really ruining this story for me. it went down hill once her arc was resolved but still this episode was a slap in the face.
>> ARTICLE
WHY WOULD YOU TELL HIM THAT???
>> ARTICLE
Never has an episode gone by so quickly as this one.  
I AM READY FOR THE EPIC CONCLUSION!
>> ARTICLE
Me and my friends who've been watching this show since the begging came up with a theory after last episode. Satarou actually died and Kayo would take his revival power and would go back and save him making her the new main character. We were hoping the show would change dramatically. And then they give us this instead of something way more creative. It's just disappointing seeing an opportunity to create something great go to waste. Still best show of the season but definitely could've been better.

Sorry I'm my English is poor. 
>> ARTICLE
Can someone tell me how much the 10 EPs stayed original to the manga? I want to start reading after its finished and seems like I should start at 34 if it doesn't skip muxh
>> ARTICLE
Bruh, I swear, I should have just waited this one out! Omfg, now I gotta' wait another week for the new episode. The wait is just killing me at this point. ><
>> ARTICLE
you know, I deeply wished that Shiratori Jun would save Satoru from the drowning car.
>> ARTICLE
I knew at some point that the anime would take a pretty noticeable divergence from the manga due to them working from an outline. Plus the fact that, counting this episode, there were only 2 left. This episode is nothing like the manga, it barely even touches on Yoshiro's story, and the hospital scene were almost entirely different. The episode wasn't bad, but it definitely has the feeling of a story aware of how little time it has left to create and ending.
>> ARTICLE
i.....dont know how to feel... about anything
>> ARTICLE
Anyone else notice how the opening for this episode didn't have Satoru in it at all? They removed him!

And I guess Kayo isn't best girl... unless Satoru wants to cuck the other friend he put so much effort into saving.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't somebody point out in a previous episode that ther was a wierd web thing above Kayos head? I'm pretty sure I remember thinking "what an idiot thinking every light effect is plot relate". It seems I was the idiot one.
>> ARTICLE
IIRC, that person read the manga (unless a different person pointed it out), which is why they knew the web thing was significant
>> ARTICLE
Well, there's an explanation for the strings found in the OP.
>> ARTICLE
When the killer monologued that he decided to call Satoru "Spice" or whatever and raise him, and then they showed Satoru's mom in the sad montage, I was 100% certain that the killer had kidnapped Satoru and was "raising him" chained up in a basement somewhere.  That he had been in a comma came as a surprise.
>> ARTICLE
Yea I was expecting something like this too, and all the mom scenes were her dealing with the anxiety of her son being missing all this time.  I was getting ready for a really painful scene when she had the hero music on and walked into her son's dark room.  

Instead there's Satoru in bed with an IV.  She tears up and all of a sudden, I'm crying like a baby.  It was a really amazing scene, I'm tearing up remembering it now :(
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, that episode felt so short! And to end it like it did? Man next Thursday can't come soon enough!!
>> ARTICLE
I cried so hard when Kayo walked in to see Satoru.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if I'm alone in this, but I'm glad they went anime original for this part. I do wish they kind of went the kokoro connect route of essentially adding four episodes to the series, but this is probably the best way of doing it with the episode restriction. In some ways, I didn't like it as much like how the teacher's backstory isn't delved into as much here as it is in the manga(and it's one of the most interesting parts of the manga.) I do kind of like the switch on the reporter scene. I always found that scene way too convenient in the manga, so I'm glad it makes a lot more sense here. 
>> ARTICLE
so the op doesn't have him in it, but what do the eyes of the various characters not being blacked out mean?

>> ARTICLE
Started watching this series on a whim a few days ago thanks to a podcast I listen to... well, a crossover of two podcasts (thanks, /u/jeffinitelyjeff and /u/airdramon) briefly mentioning it among other things they were talking about. Before I knew it, I was all caught up in one night of binging and it just had to be at the end of episode 10. What a cliffhangers of cliffhangers.

After this most recent episode of both touching and sad moments, I guess I'll jump on over to the manga next and see where it all started and how much the next couple of episodes will differ.
>> ARTICLE
The manga is over right? So even though we know it's usually a 12 episode anime, how many more episodes do you think can sufficiently finish the story, manga readers?
>> ARTICLE
I just want to know what people believed happened to Satoru! He went on a joy ride with a basketball and flew a little too close to the sun? Sensei couldn't quite save hi in time but he tried to? Is there a Manga explanation for this?
>> ARTICLE
I literally yelled "Are you fucking kidding me?!" when the episode ended. That seriously felt like 10 minutes *tops*. GAAAH.
>> ARTICLE
I ship Satoru and his ideals of becoming a superhero. He just needs to get rid of Yashiro and claim his happy ending.
>> ARTICLE
Aw shit. Does anyone else notice the spider's thread above the three in the OP when the screen turns from blue to red, with [](/s "Yashiro") behind it?
>> ARTICLE
Now I understand when you guys say it was just a "5 minute episode". Thats what this episode legitimately felt like. 
>> ARTICLE
He told him to press the roof button. Is it to get Satoru's fingerprint on the button and make it look like a suicide? 
>> ARTICLE
Man I have never been so smug as now having shipped Satoru x Airi all this time. Feels good man.

She's Kayo 2 now.
>> ARTICLE
THEY'RE MAKING THIS TEACHER SO FUCKING WEIRD AND SUSPICIOUS BUT AT THE SAME TIME MAKING HIM SO PERFECTLY HUMAN AND INNOCENT WHAT THE HELL

EDIT: I'M SO CONFUSED WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ENDING
>> ARTICLE
I want to tell you that this story is not so much a mystery about who the killer is but about the chase between satoru and the killer.  
>> ARTICLE
its almost like he is a character with more than one side to his persona.


just like everyone else in the show.
>> ARTICLE
But my point is is that he goes from being super creepy one second to giving a legitimate reason as to why he'd have a pinata's worth of candy in his dashboard.

It almost seems too perfect. I'm starting to believe the red herring theory about him.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly if he's the killer I'll be extremely disappointed, I'm really hoping for the red herring theory. 
>> ARTICLE
Anyone who is aware of their own actions being something they don't want other to find out, often mentally prepare lies beforehand to tell people in situations where they might be found out. I wouldn't be surprised if the killer was good at lying enough to make it seem that innocent.

That being said, the show is pointing towards him too much. It would be too simple if he were the murderer.

edit: and think about it: would **you** freak out that much if someone was about to find your candy stash?
>> ARTICLE
I definitely would. I do not like sharing my stash.
>> ARTICLE
He's giving you a sense of relief and then HE COMES AND MURDERS EVERYONE WITH THE LOLLIPOPS

That last secene with Bully Girl totally surprised me. Out of nowhere, totally forgot she even existed
>> ARTICLE
And that is what makes it so great! A lot of people forgot her. Heck, Satoru and his friends were in the room and completely ignored/forgot she was there. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm *guessing* the ending's hinting that that girl, walking home alone, last in the class, **also has a red backpack** might end up as a victim in this timeline now. Just my idea for that.

But yeah, only because we still don't have another suspect ~~KAYOS GRANDMA~~ I think it still has to be him... that scene with him and satoru makes me think Yashiro was just, from his own words, *making him lower his guard*
>> ARTICLE
A red backpack is a standard type of, and sometimes required, type of school rucksack in Japanese elementary schools, so it's not so surprising they'd both have one.
>> ARTICLE
Well yeah, but like Kenya and Satoru and most of the main characters we've seen have different colored bags. 

Just kinda interesting that Kayo, this girl, and even that Aya girl from the next school over all had red bags. Could be wrong, but I'm seeing some possible foreshadowing there.
>> ARTICLE
In general, girls have red, boys have black/blue of those expensive rucksacks called "[randoseru](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=%E5%B0%8F%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E3%80%80%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89%E3%82%BB%E3%83%AB&hl=ja&biw=1299&bih=656&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwid7o_Ho6XLAhVGJJQKHfhYBo8Q_AUIBigB)". Then sometimes some kids have totally different types, quite often because they broke it and couldn't afford another or didn't want to bother buying the same type when they only have a year or two of elementary years left. (No kids carry this after they graduate elementary.)
>> ARTICLE
At this point I'll just be sad if it's him. 

I just want to believe in him for my own sake, you know? 
>> ARTICLE
He's really nice, and quite funny too

He just seems so obvious that it can't be him. It *has* to be him but it *can't* be him at the same time

I'm willing to assert that this girl has become an isolated loner ever since her 'Kayo stole the money' thing backfired.

>I'M SO CONFUSED WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ENDING

IT WAS BULLY-GIRL ALL ALONG!!!!
>> ARTICLE
I think with Kayo gone she's now a target for the killer. I imagine after being ousted like that she became a loner and a perfect target.

What if it's a final destination type? You save one girl but another girl takes that ones place. There will always be three murders.

Oh damn that is an excellent point! Seeing as how the class kinda hates her she would be the perfect target.

I really wonder how she is going to play into all this. I think the ending scene was kind of interesting with her leaving alone. Satoru is trying to save that one girl who he says is always alone but the Bully girl seems to have lost her friends and is now a perfect victim for the killer.

>I think the ending scene was kind of interesting with her leaving alone. Satoru is trying to save that one girl who he says is always alone but the **Bully girl seems to have lost her friends and is now a perfect victim for the killer.**

This is exactly what I think the ending scene was meant to portray. It's like no matter what Satoru does, there will always be *someone* for the killer to have as the 'perfect victim'. 


>> ARTICLE
That is until he turns on the killer himself. I'm wondering why he didn't do this in the fist place. Stalk out the school bus and have a look who's coming to stash his murder tools.
>> ARTICLE
Good point. I suppose he's probably thinking about the fact that he's an 11 year old child physically as well now, so he can't exactly do much to protect himself if it comes to it, just like the other children. 
>> ARTICLE
If Yashiro is the killer then this is a case of some of laser-guided amnesia. I mean, Satoru saw the killer twice in the "future". He should've recognized him by the second time if that was Yashiro. (I'm personally like 95% sure that's him, but I have a history of guessing wrong)


>> ARTICLE
Eh the first time he only caught a glimpse of him, but he definitely saw him full on the second time
>> ARTICLE
Especially if you keep in mind that Sachiko recognised him 18 years later from a glimpse.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, Satoru could only win battles he can never win the war. 
>> ARTICLE
He is doing damage control tho. What if the killer then targets someone outside of his city, yes could probably solve "his" problems but I get that the end game is about stoping the murderer.
>> ARTICLE
tbh I wouldn't be surprised if Satoru becomes the next target.

I think that would be the next logical step for the killer, but I guess it would be pretty difficult too.

>> ARTICLE
I like [this frame](https://i.imgur.com/svi7zz3.png) because it shows why Kayo's mother was hitting her daughter: Kayo has the same eyes as her father, so Kayo's mother was constantly reminded of her husband by those eyes.

Edit: Had to check if the father's eyes were similar to the killer's. [They're not.](http://i.imgur.com/jsEBPi4.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Fucking great... another reason to feel bad for her.

I hate myself. 
>> ARTICLE
I missed that one, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
There's a lot of very subtle things being done to portray themes, and it's amazing. For example: when Kayo is in the car being driven away, the houses in the shot of the car are rather nice and new. When the camera switches to show Satoru, it shows the cheaper and smaller houses like the one Kayo's mom lives in. It's portraying how she's leaving that world and entering into a much happier, newer one. This is also further supported when he talks about her moving on to the future and being safe.

It's these subtle little things that blow my mind and make the show *that* much better. It's a work of art, really.
>> ARTICLE
It's not just that the houses ahead are new. They are all sizes and shapes, whereas the houses looking back are all the same. It's as if she's leaving her old cyclical, monotonous routine for a new and different timeline. Kind of like a caged bird being set free.
>> ARTICLE
We don't know the killers eye color, cause everyone's  eye color with murderous intentions changes to red. At least that's what I noticed when Satoru got angry his eyes turned red for a bit..
>> ARTICLE
> cause everyone's eye color with murderous intentions changes to red.

Yeah, I noticed that as well. The teacher had red eyes once as well, just after speaking with Sachiko over the phone, I think.

I was comparing the shape of the eyes. You'll notice that the corners of the father's eyes are higher than the killer's, and that the bottom of the eye is rounded as opposed to straight.
>> ARTICLE
Oh damn... I didn't even notice that shit... 

On the other hand... How could you hit such a cute round face. I'd hug her night and day. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. But I guess I would go crazy too if there was a constant reminder of someone who abused me every day.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very real problem, and a cause for many cases of violence. Such a sad thing.
>> ARTICLE
That is a really cool _minor_ detail. The pent up anger that Kayo's mom felt would probably be triggered by looking at Kayo. 

Glad that Kayo is finally out of that abusive cycle.
>> ARTICLE
> Glad that Kayo is finally out of that abusive cycle.

My fear is actually that the killer would just switch targets.

The last scene today looked to me like they're making bully-chan to be the next target.

She's a female, she's a kid, and she was walking home alone.

I like how Kayo didnt end up being the whole anime. I was always wondering if he would ever give the other 2 victims attention. But Im gonna miss Kayo.

Sensei can't be more obvious with [the luring kids into your car with candy tactic](http://i.imgur.com/sjLx740.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he's the actuall "Lolicon".
>> ARTICLE
Yeah forreal, forget the candy, there's a freaking chloroform rag sitting on top of it. They showcased a nervous tapping tick but didn't address it, and the culprit clearly didn't know about his hideout being compromised but suddenly it's cleared out. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought that the nervous tapping had to do with Satoru's mom in the backseat. They were just talking about how he's not married, and he did glance at the rear-view mirror for a second. He was blushing after all.

Not to say I don't think that the teacher is the killer, but its another explanation that would add to his red herring qualities.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't they imply that the nervous tapping was a result of him quitting smoking cigarettes? I know the candy was his substitute for them but didn't he also say that he gets nervous in social situations without cigarettes, and since he couldn't have the candy immediatley the tapping was his way of showing that he was uncomfortable?
>> ARTICLE
I felt like its more of him hitting on Satorus mom. Face it, she is hot, strong, single, and they had a lot of relations while kids were "stealing" Hinazuki. Yea, he would be sooooo nervous in this situation and with those questions, and with dumb sweets addiction.

Also, him being there was just too random for a coincidence.
>> ARTICLE
Assuming he's not the killer, I feel he retreated to becoming an elementary school teacher because he cannot handle the social pressure of interacting with adults.

I kinda like that about him, so now I hope even more that he isn't the murderer.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's supposed to be the bag that holds the candy.

It is actually just a bag/wrapper for the candy; if you slowly watch [that scene, you'll see this](http://puu.sh/nu1n3/df812ed14c.jpg) which another user screen-capped. Plus, you can actually see the envelope shape and candy flowing out of it when the bag is just lying among the candy.

All the kids the killer has targeted seem kind of too old for the loli-pop trick, but that was a bit weird how sensei reacted when Satoru started pulling on the rapper that was sticking out. The fact that sensei was acting jittery and the reason he gave for the candy actually does make sense. 
>> ARTICLE
seeing as how he's the only adult that's been suspect in any way, I'd say he's still top contender for the killer

also; [Chekhov's gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun)
>> ARTICLE
Good point about chekhov's gun still I just can't help but feel that sensei is too obvious of a suspect like the writers really want you to suspect him in order to totally surprise you when they reveal who the real killer is. 
>> ARTICLE
Or that's what they *want* you to think, and it is, in fact, the teacher.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't help that the bus was cleaned out shortly after Satoru told Sensei about them hiding Kayo there.
>> ARTICLE
He didn't react to that at all though. Everything else suspicious has always been a reaction of some sort.
>> ARTICLE
His reaction seemed a bit suspicious to me. He said something along the lines of "Only a kidnapper like you would think of using that place." which seemed like a really odd response.
>> ARTICLE
Also he was right behind Satoru when he was following that soon to be murdered girl. Almost like he was following the girl and Satoru happened to be there.
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking that he may be the cram school teacher as well. That gives him a reason to be in the area. That also gives him a connection to the other girl that is murdered. Suspicious. 
>> ARTICLE
When Kayo's mom started crying I didn't feel anything, much like everyone else that was there. Just like Satoru thought, I thought it was purely vain and out of self-pity.

What was also interesting is that when Kayo's granny said "*I know very well how hard it is for a woman to raise a child on her own*" It immediately cuts to Satoru's mom. Goes to show how much stronger Ms. Fujinuma is as a person and a mother compared to Ms. Hinadzuki.
>> ARTICLE
I was screaming mad when Kayo's mom broke down in tears. All I could think of was "WHO DID KAYO HAVE TO CRY TO WHEN YOU WOULD BEAT HER SENSELESS YOU SELF CENTERED BITCH!? "
>> ARTICLE
Not to mention [that punch](http://imgur.com/N5bwNrS) during the flashback. Any compassion I could have felt died with that.
>> ARTICLE
I was kind of cringing at it, it was more annoying than anything. I was really glad to see that Satoru and Kayo were pretty much the same. I hope Satoru's mom was just playing the part when she seemed to buy into it
>> ARTICLE
Yeah but the important part to note is that Satoru's mum didn't just see Kay's mum as JUST a villain but also a victim which is why she had some sympathy.
>> ARTICLE
Okay teach, I'll admit that was a good cover-up. Now tell me, what is the candy *really* for?
>> ARTICLE
He ain't fooling me with that lame ass excuse. He's still the #1 suspect for me. There is just too much evidence pointing towards him especially in this episode, with the perfectly timed clearing of his murder stash, the candy, and conveniently being in the same place that MC was following one of the victims.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing that is keeping me from thinking he is the culprit is that he's just *too obvious*. 

EDIT: Even his *phrasing* when he was talking to Satoru about girls, when he's saying you have to "get their guard down" and "use your skills as weapons".

Hell, they even kind of gave him a motive with his "bad previous experience" causing him to be more cautious with girls now. Maybe his bad previous experience was a long time ago and girl children remind him of that which sparks a memory of it.

Maybe I'm reading into it too much

Definitely. I still remember for a while the top One Punch Man review was giving a 3/10 but the reviewer said it was 7/10 in reality.

I think it was. It made me think the killer is targeting the other girl next and not the one Satoru was stalking.

Props to Satoru's mom in the beginning for laying it straight to Kayo's mom. What a great feeling it was when sensei brought those people and they caught Kayo's mom in the act. I didn't feel sorry when her mom showed up. Ok..maybe a little for Kayo's grandmother. [There's no way I can forgive Kayo's mom though.](https://i.gyazo.com/dfc2e008951470d5128567da88affa1f.gif)

I hope that Kayo's actually safe for good now.

Sensei and all that candy.. It's suspicous and how he found Satoru and his mom then too..He could of been stocking the girl or Satoru. I think sensei cleared out the bus after Satoru told him they hid Kayo at a bus. It was very dumb of Satoru to tell anyone where he was hiding Kayo. They made sensei look extremely suspicious this episode enough that it would make you think twice about him actually being the guy. I think its him. We haven't been shown anyone else who could be the guy other than the reporter guy the mom knew but I doubt it's him.


>> ARTICLE
The punch in that gif looked so much more brutal than the rest of them, I'm surprised little kids can actually survive those.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm surprised little kids can actually survive those.

Well, kids can take all sorts of punishment. It's like they're tanks. But all it takes is a critical hit to kill/disable one of them. Tough buggers.

And judging from the speed at which she flew back from the punch in the gif, the bitch's fist should have been wrecked, and Kayo should have been dead by now. Or, her face sunken in and deformed, thus causing all kinds of problems.

By showing Kayo's mom viciously punch Kayo, that removed any ounce of sympathy I felt for her.

Even though she was a victim of abuse herself, that doesn't make her actions any more acceptable.
>> ARTICLE
I don't feel sorry for Kayo's mom, but that flashback and her mom made her feel a bit more human and a bit less like a one-dimensional plot device. Even if what she was doing wasn't right, now there's at least something we know that caused it.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. Prior to the flashback, Kayo's mom just seem to be plain evil. Now she has a reason for her actions. Not that I think her actions are  justified but it makes it possible for people to somewhat connect to her. Bad things happen to you so you push bad things onto others.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, as a manga reader I can seriously say there is no way this series will only contain 12 episodes. At the pace they are going continues it looks more like 16 episodes then 12.

This episode was a great episode. The confrontation with Kayo's mother was well done and very emotional. I am glad they finally showed his determination to save Aya and Hiromi, which the anime to this point has made it look like Satoru had forgotten, but in the manga he hadn't. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah i expected it too end on bitch girl but at a later point in the narrativr. There is way too much to cover in the next 3 episodes. 

I really thought they might skip Hinazukis gran arriving and her moms backstory as for me personally it's not necessary to the overall narrative.

I hear the final chapter acts as a sort of epilogue (refuse to read until the rest are translated) so maybe that will be an OVA, but even with that it's still so much content so little time. 

Really well done content though, the anime is still doing an amazing job.

> So shipping sensei and the mom...

For whatever reason, early on in the episode, I got the feeling that sensei was Satoru's father, and then sensei got really nervous with Satoru's mother in the car, making me think they were divorced or something.

I really doubt this is the case, it's just a feeling I had.

With the way things are going, it seems there's a pretty strong push for the idea of "You can save one person, but that will only lead to someone else being killed", or some such idea. Like yes, now we've got Kayo safe, but that scene at the end was enough to show that there's someone else who's alone and easy prey.

In a similar way, Satoru's actions toward "protecting" the elementary school student will probably have unintended consequences. If his own mother saw him tailing her, you can bet that the kidnapper/killer did as well, *especially* if it is in fact Sensei (remember that he picked them up shortly thereafter; right place at the right time?).

Regardless, this show is doing a great job with misdirection. I have no clue what's genuine insight and what's red herring, with Yuuki, Sensei, Kenya, and a host of other characters. I know a lot of manga readers have been saying that we're running out of space to wrap things up well; I just hope they're wrong somehow, or that we get extra episodes by some miracle.

I simply cannot relax while watching this show. Doesn't matter how well everything goes, I am always tense, waiting for something bad to happen.

They did an amazing job by contrasting Sachiko and Kayo's mom. They both are single mothers, but while Sachiko put [everything she had into raising her son](http://i.imgur.com/7NVAj4j.jpg), Kayo's mom gave up and started venting her frustrations on Kayo, possibly even blaming her for her own misfortunes. However, Kayo's mom situation was probably much worse, as she [was abused by her husband](http://i.imgur.com/RMBh8Vi.jpg) and neglected by her own mother. She's still a shit mom, but that really put her character into perspective. And goddamn is [Sachiko a frigging badass](http://i.imgur.com/toTOGEf.jpg).

* [I can certainly see a family resemblance](http://i.imgur.com/dWglhgF.jpg)

* [I'm so conflicted about this](http://i.imgur.com/YQ3TflW.png). Like, yeah, it's suspicious as hell for a teacher to have a bunch of candies in his car. But at the same time, it is an incredibly realistic reason for him to do that, since a lot of smokers have some sort of oral fixation. And besides, kids don't really fall for strangers with candies, right? Right?!

Ehhh, dunno exactly about that, I have found there have been moments that could be considered "weak" since the very first episode, but in general the great moments are... well great. This episode had Kayos conclusion and it was pretty phenomenal in my opinion. And it's been like that for each episode, each one has great scenes and they all serve a purpose. 

So in general I will disagree, I think it has managed to have a great story so far, and has mantained it through the show by having strong scenes in each episode.

While this wasn't the best episode, I loved episode 8 and have really enjoyed all of the episodes during this "time period".

I think the slightly weaker episodes were the ones in the present timeline because I only cared about Satoru and Airi.

I think the 8th episode is the overall best episode so far. I've never teared up to anything media related like the breakfast scene in 8.

 You know how a continuous story that makes sense works? It has something happen, then it has something else happen that directly follows the first event, and so on and so forth. It's the same with themes, where today's thematic discussion has to correspond with and grow out of yesterday's, for the story to make sense as a whole.

So, where are we in terms of themes with the show? Episodes 5 and [especially episode 6 were all about trust](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/02/11/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-6-trust-revolution/). Episode 6 also introduced the "What would a superhero do?" style of thinking, that led to [episode 7 revolving around being a superhero](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/02/18/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-7-innocent-and-childish-superheroes/), about being naive. And while episode 8 last week seemed like it wasn't all too thematically relevant, and served mostly as a break within the story, [it actually drove home that Satoru is complacent](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-episode-8-seeing-through-the-tears/), that he cares a bit more about being recognized as a superhero than being one, truly.

So how did this episode work to gather all these threads together in a meaningful way, how did it make use of past events? Well, let's run down the list. First of all, it made use of Airi speaking of trust, actively bringing it up with relation to Kenya, to tell us an important message - people not only want to be trusted, but they want to trust others. When people aren't trusted, they lose the ability to trust others, so they end up alone, as adult Satoru did. Child Satoru misplaced his trust, either in Yuuki, or in his mother and the police, so how could he keep trusting afterwards? And as he couldn't, he withdrew from everyone.

But more than that, this episode kept revolving around superheroes, as Kenya and Sensei brought it up themselves. [This is the true reward Satoru wanted all along](http://i.imgur.com/517K2Ro.jpg), and also the reward he sought all the times he acted and saved people up to now - it was to see himself as a superhero. Of course, he also wanted to be seen as such by other people, which was a bit harder if they didn't know he saved them, but that's his first real interaction with Airi, and what got the series started - him saving people and being recognized and praised for it.

I mean, look at Satoru, [he's listening to his childhood's favourite superhero's theme song](http://i.imgur.com/fUjqdw9.jpg) as [he tries to think of how to save people next](http://i.imgur.com/beGfjbg.jpg). And his conclusion? "[I won't let anyone alone again!](http://i.imgur.com/okFGXI6.jpg)" And if he truly means it, that he won't let *anyone* be alone, then it's impossible. There aren't enough days in a millennium of years for him to keep up this promise. It's a child's wish.

And the episode ends where all stories must end, with a culmination of all plot-lines, with wrapping up all the themes together. There must be a balance that life demands in time-traveling stories such as this, right? More than that, there's a balance in social interactions. Satoru had everyone trust Kayo, he had everyone not leave her alone. But in doing so he had everyone turn against another girl, mistrust her, [and thus leave her alone](http://i.imgur.com/gJRYgZQ.jpg).

Satoru said so himself, it's dangerous to go beyond the map he had of past events, because he can't tell how events will keep happening, but here he is, in a changed past, and he acts as if nothing will change further, while things changing are his goals. Naive. Naive dreams of being a superhero. But what can he do? I mean, for every action he does, for every person he saves, he just might be damning someone else, like the god of death from the story with Airi. [He almost lost his mother](http://i.imgur.com/3Aqm2gw.jpg) then and there, [in the past](http://i.imgur.com/jClp43f.jpg). What would he have done then?

***

Beyond the write-up above, I'll outline a few shorter thoughts I've had during the episode to follow, but first, [here is a screenshot album of more important moments and/or better-looking frames](http://imgur.com/a/FLvfV).

1) Satoru doesn't understand Kayo as perfectly as he thinks he does. "Kayo isn't moved by her mother's self-pity," he told us, but he forgot what his own mother told [Kayo's mother but moments earlier](http://i.imgur.com/Dx9DvLx.jpg) - [that Kayo doesn't want to see her mother like this either](http://i.imgur.com/EOmU0jy.jpg). Kayo may not understand and forgive, but just like last week with her deadpan face as she said she'll be happy about leaving her house, it's understandable that she's of two minds about it - it's still her mother and the only life she's ever had.

2) About Kayo's mother's backstory. Didn't make me care for her. I doubt it moved many people. It strove to make her understandable, and to show we're all fallible people, I guess? But to me the main take-away was actually about Satoru's mother - raising a child alone isn't hard, and yet this mother succeeded, to a degree, as her child still ended emotionally stunted and shut away from society and human warmth. But still, that whole segment, it came far too late and did too little with a character who earned our distaste. I could've lived without it.

3) Yes, they want us to think of the teacher as suspicious, but man, [I really smiled in this moment in the car](http://i.imgur.com/uyLKOVI.jpg). Supposing that he *is* indeed the murderer, as they keep trying to make us think, then they've made him *human*, and relatable, and believeable as a person. It's everything they haven't really done with Kayo's mother. Because this form of characterization is based on a series of small moments, of touches and interactions, not by way of one big sob-story for a character we didn't care for up to now and won't meet from now on. I like the teacher. And indeed, asking advice from another single person, Satoru? Fat lot of good that will do you.

4) There was one thing that really stood out to me this episode. They went and hid Kayo in the bus, where the killer hid his stuff. The teacher pointed it out, [that they hid her where only killers and kidnappers would go](http://i.imgur.com/yKoiY4e.jpg). And then we had Satoru tailing Aya, [charting down her daily routine](http://i.imgur.com/fs18MqO.jpg) - just as the killer must have done. The latter is obvious for one who wishes to stop the killer, but combined with the first? It almost makes me wonder if true to time-travel stories, there's *another* time-traveler here, a broken-future Satoru, or Kenya that [got to be a superhero](http://i.imgur.com/l92Hilw.jpg) "just like Satoru", because he too *[wanted to make the leap](http://i.imgur.com/HPnxXUl.jpg)* (time-leap?), who's making the same choices as they, because he shares the basic personality of one of them. Edit: Though this doesn't really fit the way time-travel works in the show, as bodies don't go back, but maybe, somehow, something?

5) Satoru asking for advice is sort of precious. He's a 29 year old man asking his mother, and his teacher, both of whom are adults, on how to approach an 11 year old girl. How would they know? It's the blind leading the deaf.

6) Some shots in this week's episode weren't as good-looking as in past episodes. Not all *too* noticeable, but even if the show *didn't* try to paint Kayo's mother as the bad guy here, [it certainly painted her mouth badly](http://i.imgur.com/QiXU9IT.jpg) ;-)

([Check out my blog](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/) or [the specific page for all my write-ups on BokuMachi/ERASED](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-erased-notes/) if you enjoy reading my stuff.)

Thanks for your write ups. I# looking forward to reading them after every episode.

I think that part of the story wasn't only there to flesh out the characters but to give some form of conclusion as to what happens to Kayo. She will be with her grandmother and not rot away in some orphanage.

It was great to see Kayo finally able to stand up for herself after being so helpless around her mother in the previous episodes.

that level change, posture, deep penetration, and good head positioning to defend against the chokes. decent takedown. you could tell she really commited to the shot. she could definitely get lower on the hips and turn the corner for the finish though
>> ARTICLE
Kayo better make a reappearance. This show won't be the same without her :(
>> ARTICLE
I love how Kayo's mom immediately went into little-kid sobbing mode when her mother showed up. Really shows how she never really grew up. Sometimes having a child young can make you grow up quickly, but in her case, she may have even regressed in maturity: Focusing on her own abuse, taking it out on her daughter, rebelling against her mother, and blaming everyone but herself for her problems.

Serves as some interesting juxtaposition as well. Here we have Kayo's mom who acts like a child in an adult body. Looking on calmly is Satoru, an adult in a child's body. Add in Kayo's inability to look at her own mother's immaturity and it creates a powerful image. Love how this show is exploring the themes of maturity and growing up.
>> ARTICLE
As expected, the episode omitted quite a large chunk of material - mostly Satoru's feeling towards Airi. 
As the director said in his interview, it does seem to be the case that he's removing majority of her role since he set his focus primarily on Kayo's story.

The first half of this episode marked the half-way point of the story. 
With only three and a half episodes left, the story is going to rush through and omit a HUGE chunk of the story. 
It's inevitable I suppose, but still sad to see my favorite girl get shafted.  In the anime's defense though, it does make the story leaner and more focused - albeit simpler. 

I've no doubt the anime will still be a great run in the end, but I would advise everyone to pick up the source material once the anime is concluded.  Simply put, you're only getting half the meal otherwise. 
>> ARTICLE
I like that they are humanizing the teacher and making him quirky and more relatable, it abates what was originally immediate suspicion. So far this has been a compelling and suspensefull story, and one of the most beautiful and creatively animated ones I have seen in some time, what I am worried about, like with every show/story, is the ending. I can see this final arc becoming very jumbled, I hope that the show keeps the focus it's had and ties the story together.

Also as far as suspects go the only ones left are the teacher, the television studio assistant, and a random character, and I hope it is not a random character because to me that's synonymous with a deus ex machina ending, of which I am not a fan.

>> ARTICLE
I think that Kayos mother is still the leading contender for the worst mother of the year award but [her own abusive marriage](http://i.imgur.com/o2erlbM.jpg) and [experience of neglect from her own mother](http://i.imgur.com/awk6eD2.jpg) did quite a bit humanize her. 

*Boku dake ga Inai Machi* sure knows how to spend them feels. 
>> ARTICLE
Its interesting to note the contrast between Kayo's mother and Satoru's mother. One was not strong enough to deal with the stress of raising a kid alone, where as the other one was able to go above and beyond. Satoru's mother's words about how a child is the most important to their mother further emphasizes this point. Both mothers started with the same core values, yet time and isolation can cause drastic changes in one's character.
>> ARTICLE
Kayo's mother also had a violent husband, so it's not purely the stress that beat her down.
>> ARTICLE
While abusing her kid is inexcusable, I am glad that we received some background on how she became the way she is.

Still the worst mom of the year though.
>> ARTICLE
It makes her character be complete, she was a struggling single-mom, and she couldn't handle it, doesn't save her from been who she is but it helps her character to not just be a one-dimensional psycho.

Episode 9 Entry:

*It gets harder every week to avoid reading the manga to know what happens. This time, it seems that the cliffhanger ending implies that bully girl will be the killer's next target, and that Satoru's friends are going to fuck up his plan somehow.*

*P.S. Can't tell if Sensei is getting creepier and creepier every week or if he's getting more and more quirky, likeable, and relateable.*

Edit:

*P.P.S. Why the fuck does Yuuki hang out with so many little kids?*

I've posted in these discussion threads that I'm not really into anime, but this has got me hooked badly.

Love this anime adaptation. Read the manga, very excited for the finale of it when it's released this month. However, I have one concern after watching episode 9. This anime ends in 12 episodes but I think there's still a substantial amount of manga content left to cover in the span of 3 episodes especially with this pacing. Or am I just overthinking it? Either way, I hope they don't rush it or leave out a lot of material. 
>> ARTICLE
I gave in and read all the manga. No regrets. Thought the anime was going downhill after kayo left. Oh boy was i wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I like how this show, and anime in general, takes the time to flesh out the characters and explain why they are the way they are (Kayo's mom). They aren't just bad guys for the sake of being bad and I like that.
>> ARTICLE
Guys, first time commenting (anything actually, first comment on Reddit, lol), so I'm not sure if it's all good with the comment, but what do you guys think the lack of father figures in the anime mean? If you think about it, Kayo, Satoru and - for that matter, even if only absent - Airi don't have a father per se. Grandma Hinazuki, Kayo's mom and Satoru's mom have no husband. You know, the weird point is that some of them are fine without a "man in their lives", while some seem to suffer from it. I guess we could exaggerate  and discuss loneliness in the series as a concept, given the teacher, the reporter, yuuki and so on, but I'm struggling to understand why the narrative would go to such lengths as to show no one has a "father figure". Do you think this might be leading to something, is it a Japanese cultural concept I am not familiar with or perhaps only a strange coincidence in the narrative? Thanks!

Well just being technical, that hasn't happened (yet?), and it'd be two girls and a trap.

Though that could be something to consider, he's the teacher, he'd know Hiromi is a guy if he was planning on killing him. (Unless that was in his plan).
>> ARTICLE
Fuuck, so the mother was abused by her former husband, that doesn't make it any better that she took out her anger on her only daughter, she needed to seek help.  
  
Talking about charming a girl to let her guard down, a car filled with candy, yeah Sensei, you may be a nice guy on the outside, but I totally still think you are the killer.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah Sensei is still my top suspect. 
>> ARTICLE
But Sensei has lolipops.

He must be a nice guy!

God damn it I hope it's not the teacher. They are building him up to be such a nice/funny bro and if he ends up being the killer it's gonna break my soul! 

On a side note, what if the teacher and his mom end up dating/getting married? That would seriously change the future in so many different ways.

I think Bully-girl might be a new target or something with all the change.

So I been thinking but what if we are still missing characters in this story. And the reason I say that is because I was going frame by frame of the ending and there seems to be at least 2 maybe 3 characters I can't seem to figure out.

[I am almost 100% sure this is airi.](http://i.imgur.com/EVW4csI.png)

[But who is this?](http://i.imgur.com/i4F2wVu.png)

That's all I can think of
>> ARTICLE
Okay, as a manga reader I can seriously say there is no way this series will only contain 12 episodes. At the pace they are going continues it looks more like 16 episodes then 12.

This episode was a great episode. The confrontation with Kayo's mother was well done and very emotional. I am glad they finally showed his determination to save Aya and Hiromi, which the anime to this point has made it look like Satoru had forgotten, but in the manga he hadn't. 
>> ARTICLE
So, also as a manga reader, I somewhat disagree that they can't end it with 3 more episodes. We're through 27 chapters now, and yes, there are 44 chapters in the manga. Which seems like a lot of ground to cover...

I think episode 10 will realistically cover chapters 28-31, even though that is packing a lot into one episode. The cliffhanger makes sense though.

Episode 11 would then start with ch. 33. I think ch. 32 will be pretty much completely cut from the anime, because it doesn't work within the pacing of the show. So then, continuing on from 33 I think you can make it all the way through somewhere in the late 30's. Maybe even as far as chapter 39 with some cuts. These are very slowly paced chapters. I'd like to have 2 episodes devoted to them, maybe, but I don't think they actually have to be fully adapted for the story to work.

So then that would leave the final episode to adapt the final 4-5 chapters, which I haven't completely read yet, so I don't know how possible that might be. 

It's definitely going to be tough on the director. They could potentially do a double-length final episode if they feel they need the time. The adaptation has been so great to this point, that I think they'll figure out a way to make satisfying cuts to the source material, that don't severely damage the experience.
>> ARTICLE
Kinda agree as a manga reader but they did say there would be 12 episodes, argh. We need more
>> ARTICLE
Worst case scenario, i will just read the manga if the consensus is tht the ending was rushed
>> ARTICLE
Another solid episode, the mystery is moving along at a nice pace and I'm glad that they're finally giving more attention to the other victims as opposed to primarily focusing on Kayo.

Teacher is obviously still the main suspect(the candy made me think of Johan Liebert), even if there's a likely chance that it's all a red herring. If it is a red herring, there's not many other (known to the viewer) adult characters to pick as a suspect anyway.

Anyway, this and the previous episode were significantly better than episodes 4-7 in my opinion. Hope it keeps this up.
>> ARTICLE
That ever so subtle "Sooo, by the way, where did you hide her?" "Oh, in this abandoned bus." Suddenly all the stuff in the buss disappears.
>> ARTICLE
I was expecting more of a reaction out of the teacher from that. I really wanted to see him make and oh shit face.
>> ARTICLE
Nice to see Kayo's mom finally get what's coming to her, only for them to humanize her a little bit? I don't want that, I wanna hate her! Like, I get she wants to hit something to get her anger out, but go buy a punching bag or something. 

The candy the sensei had was really suspicious to me. I know that he said he has it to get over smoking, and that seems like a plausible explanation to me, but why would he have stuck 3 or 4 in his mouth in panic? And what was that rag he had in there with them?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'm still suspicious of sensei but for now I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, it's not like this killer is the type to lure kids away with candy. 
>> ARTICLE
I did think about that as well. You know, maybe it was meant as a surprise to the class, and he didn't want Satoru to ruin it?
>> ARTICLE
I absolutely hate when there is no explanation behind someone's violent behavior/abuse, when someone is made evil just for the sake of being evil. So I'm glad Erased handled it really well. You can have villains who are humans instead of caricatures.
>> ARTICLE
By the way, right now teacher is so obviously framed as the killer that I'm starting to doubt he really is the killer. It'd be too obvious for this show.
>> ARTICLE
hmmm candies in the car 
>> ARTICLE
I was waiting for Satoru to find teachers footprints in the snow, that are same as killers, as he was leaving in the car with Kayo and then go nuts.  Glad that didnt happend, teacher seems like a good guy. 
>> ARTICLE
Also I think there is no way in heck that the anime finishes the entire story in the last 3 episodes. I know sources said the anime would cover the entire story in one season, but the way this pace is going it seems like they are poised to stop at a pivotal halfway moment in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
She said the show's title in the episode!
>> ARTICLE
Actually she doesn't. She says . It means the exact same thing as in the show's title, but uses non-gendered language rather than masculine language.  (boku, me, males only) versus  (watashi, me, non-gendered when spoken like this).

I really like details such as these.

I'm just so confused at this point..... We have so many hints towards the fact that sensei is the killer but idk.. Another thing that's bugging me is the blonde man with the red eyes in kayo's home, I just can'r believe he doesn't have anything to do with the whole thing. Another thing is about Kayo's mother. In one episode and in the opening she has a blond hair opposing her regular brown hair. She looked so suspicious I was sure she was having an affair...

Damn it! Why does the teacher have to be so suspicious and be such a good guy! I really hope he is just a red herring.

There is no way the killer is not the teacher at this point. We've only been introduced to 5 adult males. The teacher, yuuji? , kayo's mom's bf with blonde hair, the reporter and the guy at the children's services. Among them, the teacher resembles the present killer the most. 

And the handkerchief. And the lollipops. And his experience with girls. And him being weird.

Yeah, the teacher's becoming more and more of a presence, too. Although, we *have* seen more males than that. There's the manager of the pizza place (though his involvement is highly unlikely at this point), and the council(?) guy who spoke to the manager.

I'm going to will a long shot and say the killer us Satoru dad he said in this episode he hardly has memory of him.Also his mom was the only one to realize who the killer was,and the killer has glasses and Satoru has glasses.
>> ARTICLE
Okay here are my thoughts on why I think it's not the Teacher, I think, **I bring up some good points that may be lost in translation**.

Things to take into consideration before I rant:

>Satoru has no father figure

>Satoru clearly respects Teacher

>The Japanese Social hierarchy of a Sensei

The Teacher character is more complicated than we think he is instinctively as people from the US. In Japan's small to medium sized communities, like the one in this show, a teacher's position is a very revered position... in which Teachers are expected to be models for the community, blah, blah, blah, sometimes ranking even higher than a child's parents on the social pyramid. In this case we have a kid, Satoru, who has no father figure, and is showing clear admiration for his male Sensei, who probably has a crush on his mom (but that's besides the point). Because of the way things are socially in Japan, the Teacher most likely feels that he needs to set a good example for Satoru. Teacher is human, and because of the admiration Satoru has shown him thus far, he is probably, considering his personality, somewhat nervous specifically with Satoru, because he does not want to let Satoru down knowing he is already being held in high esteem. This feeling is most likely amplified due to the fact that Satoru has no father, and Sensei is single and probably is crushing on Satoru's mom. The fact that Sensei want's to set a great example or Satoru, and because of the nature of his Job/how he is expected to present himself to the community, it logically follows that he would freak out when Satoru finds a massive stash of candy in his car. Especially, when we take into account that Satoru and the Teacher were having a somewhat serious conversation, that put the Teacher in a slightly uncomfortable place, discovering the stash would throw him off guard. While this is not nearly paralleled, a slight comparison that might help paint this picture is, if Sensei happened to have a tattoo, and Satoru found out he would be risking his job by knowing the information that he has a tattoo is public. In Japan, schools specifically take health matters very seriously, I don't think this candy stash would be risking him his job, but it's a matter of integrity and the example set by a teacher having a clearly hypocritical stash of candy in his car is not ideal whatsoever. Also take note how when Satoru's mom asks for a sucker, the teacher massively calms down. I don't think this is because he was worried this is because he was worried the mom would think he's a pedo, but because he was worried she would think he's a bad example for her son, tell the school, and possibly stop talking to him and seeing him as a respectful man. 

Anyways, yeah... A drawer of candy is suspicious. But think about it... Is he really going around town baiting kids into his van with candy. Everyone know's who's car it is. Everyone in town knows his face. Everyone knows he's a teacher. His students would probably get in his car regardless of candy if they needed a ride, because he's a teacher and they trust him. The author is clearly using the stereotype for a pedophile to make us think he's a pedophile, and it's working well. But I doubt in Japan, they are having the same conversation we are having here. I think there's a lot lost in translation, and just because we don't have a great grasp of Japanese daily life, we're missing the nuances. 


Edit: TL;DR: There's some cultural stuff we're missing and Sensei is really just a nervous young Teacher who is trying to be a good role model.

Satoru: We hid in the bus Izumi Elementary's hockey club used to use.

Teacher: ***A place that only kidnappers*** like you guys ***would think they go***, then.

I swear he's the killer. He knows about this shenanigans because he is one! ^Or ^that's ^what ^I ^would ^like ^to ^think.

----

Correct me if I'm wrong but I think that the content of Kayo's prose "The Town Without Me" seems to have changed a bit. Her original prose contained something along the lines of "I want to be far away from mom" but this time she didn't explicitly say that. The details...

I really hope its not the teacher there's too much evidence that makes it so obvious that it is him. I need my M. Knight Shalahalabimbam twist at the end!

I have a feelings it gonna the MC himself, with some crazy time travel shit mixed in.

It honestly makes sense.

With Kayo gone, the killer would have to be looking for a new target. That could be that last girl who left the class late, or probably even Satoru himself.

Oh, I love this anime with its endless possibilities.

I want to know if is their teacher... but at the same time I don't wanna spoil myself.

Fuck!

Misato aka the bully girl, foreshadowing that last scene will probably be involve more in the show or get more screen time. Seriously, this anime can't get any better. The teacher's probably the serial kidnapper/killer or the one who will help Satoru in the end. 3 more episodes (confirmed?) and the anime can still go far.

Rant here:

I gotta say, this is already the worst episode of the series, by a great margin. Hinazuki's death isn't just the first level of a three part game to save kids from a killer, Hinazuki is the whole show! Her death seems to have scarred the main character, it seems to have really hurt him and turned him into the confused and isolated adult that he's become. Hinazuki's lonely quiet childhood matches Satoru's lonely quiet adulthood, everything fits. And she's the main romance figure, and frankly she's the best character on the show. I'm happy she's alright, but the resolution came out of nowhere, and seemed to have nothing to do with the overarching mystery. So was she altogether a red herring?

Saving Satoru's mom and Airi are good stakes too, but Hinazuki was the real goal, it's been the whole story. Now we have a mystery really without stakes. Yes, the girlish friend is cute, but Satoru let his death pass over in an earlier episode without comment. And I don't even know the other girl's name. There just isn't the impact that there should be, we're already wasting time for what should be the final confrontation by now. We're just going to waste time protecting two undeveloped characters now? Also, as long as Satoru is in the past they're not in any danger, so whatever.

I got so bored in the second half I wrote out this rant.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting thoughts. I am interested to see how the story ramps up the stakes and intensity, or if it will fail to do so. I agree that Hinazuki was definitely the real goal, and now the only thing i can really see becoming the conflict is stopping the killer completely, not just saving potential victim after victim. There are not enough episodes left, so I bet these next 3 episodes will include a trip back to the present, another revival, and then the stopping of the killer. I wonder if Mom will live.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I agree. Kayo's character was so important, and now she's just gone? I don't know how the writers could expect viewers to stay fully engaged in the overarching plot if her story is over. With her out of the picture I care very little about what happens to the other victims, the impact won't be strong whatsoever. I guess what I'm mainly curious about now is what happens once (if?) Satoru returns to the present, especially if it happens before this whole situation is sorted out.

Not like the killers 3 kills in row gonna end.. I suspect that highly something will happen

I am now like 99% certain that the Teacher is the killer, since the bus is now empty after Satoru told him about the hideout they used. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't think about that... but the other explanation could be the killer saw the footprints of the kids and/or noticed his box had been messed with and moved. I just really don't want it to be the teacher. Besides, didn't they say something about the killer moving from town to town? I guess we don't know much about what happened to the teacher afterwards anyway.

Dear ERASED episode Diary,

Today at school, I was bored so I visited that shithole 9gag (when I haven't done in a long time), and was surprised to see anime on there, so I clicked on Erased post on there and got spoiled, not about the mystery, but worse, about the shipping. Why am I so stupid?  

Regarding the episode : 

* Oh come on, don't make me feel bad about Kayo's mom...
* Maybe this will shut up that one guy who's like "EHM, PLS, the villains in this show are sooo one dimensional"
* Sensei quit smoking so now has to lure children with lolipops? you quit some vice in favor of another I guess
* When Kayo's not around, MC gained a new admirer, this time a boy. Harem confirmed.
* What's with that girl at the end who is she going to murder?

i hope we do not get an anime original ending

episode 8 was literally the halfway point of the manga. I was expecting it to be a little farther by now, to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad that the previous episode didn't end with that shovel scene. It would've been another painfull cliffhanger. Leaving us wondering what happened to satorou's mom because of that blood spatter in the snow.
>> ARTICLE
I'm confused. The teacher seems like the obvious culprit, with the candy and the fact that the bus was cleared out right after Satoru told the teacher he had been there. But it's waaayyy too obvious to actually be him.

Also, fuck Kayo's mom. The anime tried to make me feel bad for her because she was abused. Well, I don't. Fucking bitch takes her baggage out on her child. She should rot in jail.
>> ARTICLE
The anime didn't try to make you feel bad for her. Hence the huge focus on Satoru and Kayo's lack of a response. The even said it was self-pity. All the anime did was give her more depth which was sorely lacking.
>> ARTICLE
HIROMI IS A BOY?!?!?!?!?!?
>> ARTICLE
Do you need further proof?
>> ARTICLE
maybe
>> ARTICLE
[Isn't she the girl that blamed kayo for theft?](https://i.imgur.com/gJRYgZQ.jpg)Now she is the one who is alone and I think she will be the next target. I am quite certain that murders will happen but this time the targets will change. This girl will swap the position of kayo. 

Talking about kayo, I will miss her :( . 

So, assuming this girl will die next I am trying to figure out who the killer based on given hints and clues.
1. We know the killer is recognized by satoru's mom. 
2. Satoru told her mom to watch if anything unusual happens once and then she said that I remember you saying this to me in the past as well.(That was the moment when his mom recognized the killer which ultimately lead to her own death.) 

Now, I want to think about every single character in the anime that has had interaction with satoru's mom. The teacher is the only one that comes to my mind but I don't think he is the killer simply because he looks perfectly human. He actually helped satoru save kayo and he also motivated satoru. He is just too nice and human to be a killer. 

So who else in the current timeline has had conversations with satoru's mom.

**Satoru's Mom's partner**. He told satoru that her mom called him and he regrets not asking her about the killer. He could be the killer but then satoru's mom calling him won't make much sense. 

 I can't think of anyone else at all. 

Now, I am pretty sure, point 2 will happen sooner or later. They foreshadowed an incident in which satoru will tell her mom to look around for something unusual but when and how will this happen is beyond me.

Right now, I really don't suspect anyone as the murderer but if I have to pick one , I will go for Satoru's Mom's partner simply because there isn't any other choice for me. 

Maybe the murderer has not been introduced in the anime yet, who knows.


>> ARTICLE
sensei being the killer would be way too obvious. Then again the double whammy could be even better, throwing us for a loop. But they could want us to think that. Fuck, now I'm just playing myself. 
>> ARTICLE
So from the end of the episode I can only guess (especially with the wide camera on the classroom) is that with Satoru's current efforts he seems to alienated bully-girl and she will be the target instead of Hiromi and Aya. Theory crafting this show has to be the best part about it.
>> ARTICLE
So is this story gonna have the same moral as steins gate?
>> ARTICLE
Ok because we still don't have any other adults to suspect I think it kinda has to be the teacher, unless they go all-out in making it Sachiko's coworker at the news station. Both he and Yashiro seem to be bros and working on the investigation and all, but kinda has to be one of them. Actually since Sachiko was trying to tell her coworker who it was before she died, she probably wasn't about to call him out on it over the phone... so yeah, probably has to be the teacher. Maybe Yuuki's dad but we still haven't seen his face so that'd be lame. 

Yashiro seems so cool though, seems like he'd be a great character to have as an ally, and so far he's been nice and helpful, but can't help but feel he's going to go after the other lonely grumpy red-backpacked girl in his class now that Kayo's safe and away. 
>> ARTICLE
Time to drop life and go watch. 
>> ARTICLE
I really think the teacher is up to something but I don't want him to be, so when I saw the candy fall out I was like "I KNEW IT WAS HIM" then after his reaction and reply, I couldn't help think he's just a fucking weirdo 
>> ARTICLE
I've always thought it's the teacher, but now it just seems too obvious. The guy has a glove compartment full of candy and just happens to be on the same path MC uses to trail a future victim.

And they say "hurt people hurt people," but I still say fuck you to Kayo's mom. (Glad Kayo feels the same).

Yashiro-sensei is a false flag. Wake up, sheeple.

I believe the term you're looking for is red herring.

Fuuck that episode was some deep stuff to handle. Really enjoyed getting some back story on WHY Kayo's mom is abusive and how she started on Kayo. The bit with the teacher in the car was a bit fishy but I can't guess.

why does this show just love to throw things at you to make you feel unsure about yourself ;;

Its gotta be the teacher!  Like fucking come on man!!!

The car part with the teacher was getting so intense until that PLOT TWIST!
>> ARTICLE
I'm calling it now: Yuuki is Sensei.
>> ARTICLE
The teacher is a clear red herring. There's no fucking way the killer's identity would be made that obvious.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic pacing, fantastic plot development, the teacher no longer seems like the obvious culprit (well he does, but less so?  Agh!  It's so confusing!!!) and Hinazaki left!?!  :'( come back pls
>> ARTICLE
I really want to believe the teacher is a red herring but is there really any other adult character in Satoru's childhood that could be associated with the killings? It can't be Yuuki because he's already in prison at the time of Satoru's mum's death, assuming the killer is the same person who killed the 2 girls + the trap.

I feel like the trap and the other girl from the other school are going to be saved but possibly bully girl and maybe Satoru's 2 stalker friends are going to be killed.

On the other hand, the trap being killed in the original timeline raises some questions. Satoru's assumption is that the killer killed the trap because they thought he was a girl but the teacher surely has information that he's a boy...

Following my theory about bully girl possibly being killed, it would fit in with the theme of Satoru not being able to save everyone in the end because if the teacher is found to be the culprit then Yuuki will be saved but Satoru will still end up losing a different inspirational figure in his life, his teacher. Satoru finding teacher to be fatherly at Kayo's house sort of supports this.
>> ARTICLE
That was the reason why satoru thinks he was killed in the first place. To exclude himself from the list of suspects by convincing the police that he only targets girls and killed hiromi because he looks like a girl.
>> ARTICLE
Yep and the killer is pretty witty from what we've seen so that is very possible.

Well, they did get pretty blatant this time around. I didn't really mind.. but they could've added few more minutes to tell more about the relationship between Kayo and her mother.

Okay I Have a question, so like remember when satoru first went back in time and he failed to say kayo. Then it cuts to him in the future and kayo still was dead. Did satoru relive his whole life again just to ask to go back again while under the bridge when he was getting arrested. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, this episode went from 0 to 100 reaaal fast. 
>> ARTICLE
Manga readers: It is likely that the show will reveal the killer, or will they postpone it to a potential S2?
>> ARTICLE
Oh it will absolutely reveal it. Actually at the pace it's going, I think next episode will be the big reveal. Strap in, it'll be a doozy.
>> ARTICLE
There won't be a season 2. The mangaka himself said that this will adapt the whole manga, so the killer will be revealed. Probably next week  since that seems like the most logical thing to do at this point.
>> ARTICLE
You know those scenes where someone runs after a vehicle to wave at someone they're parting ways with? I wonder if the driver ever stops to see if they forgot something and just ruins the moment.
>> ARTICLE
Hrmm, I feel like everyone is ignoring the fact that Sensei was not only right behind Satoru and Sachiko, but was constantly tapping his fingers when he was talking. Even Satoru noticed it. 
>> ARTICLE
It was him being fidgety because of his cigarette addiction.
>> ARTICLE
His cigarette addiction *could* be a story to explain the candy. Although, he *did* shove 3 into his mouth, which seems over the top for selling the lie, so maybe he was being truthful. 
>> ARTICLE
That's the thing, that's just HIS excuse as to why it may be, its not been proven yet. 

I feel like Sensei was actually following the third girl and just stumbled upon them and to 'go with the flow' he gave them a ride. 

The fidgety could be based on his nervousness of having Sachiko in the car. If we can believe him, then he'd have nervousness with a female in his car. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought the moment where Satoru thought about his lack of a father when looking at the teacher was a really nice character moment. It will make it so sad if he is the culprit. 
>> ARTICLE
Alright, Sensei still #1 suspect but that's too easy. 

That ending.. Was she just there to make the point that no matter what Satoru does, as long as he ignores the killer there'll be someone lonely enough to be targeted?

One thing thats caught my eye (ear) is the fact that most all the murdered children at some point spoke about 'courage', so I assume they've met enough of Yuuki to throw around that word. How does he tie in to all this? Does the killer go after lonely children who spend time with Yuuki just so he has someone to take the blame for the murders?

I don't even know. I'm tearing my hair out over here.
Sidenote: Sachiko still best mom and I really liked the contrast between her and Kayo's mom.
>> ARTICLE
> Was she just there to make the point that no matter what Satoru does, as long as he ignores the killer there'll be someone lonely enough to be targeted?

Yeah, I thought about that. He's changed the events of the past drastically at this point. A completely new victim isn't necessarily off the table, right?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it definitely isn't. I thought about that as well, and it'd make sense that the more Satoru meddles in the established timeline, the more things change.
>> ARTICLE
So it's *definitely* pointing towards the teacher. He's getting more and more screen time, and Satoru is starting to picture him as a guy he'd like to have as a father. Plus, the bus was empty after Satoru told him they used it for Kayo. There's also the candy, which he explained away as a withdrawal coping method - truth or lie? 

In spite of all that, it just seems too obvious. The way the show is going, it's not much of a mystery anymore. Could he be one big red herring? Then again, there are very few other adult males who are being hinted at right now. Misdirection isn't that effective when there's only one *reasonable* suspect. 

Oh yeah, and Sachiko took that shovel swing like a champ. She barely flinched, even though that *could* have killed her. I'm surprised none of the other adults there acknowledged that. Shouldn't that be considered assault, in addition to what she's done to Kayo?

By the way, I wonder what role the stuck-up girl plays going forward. Maybe she follows them, but I don't know what her overall purpose would be. 
>> ARTICLE
I always suspected him" to be the murderer, but I never expected they would make it this obvious
>> ARTICLE
That [moment](http://imgur.com/wDe4tfN) when Hiromi grabs Satoru's hand.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was the teacher at first but now its just too obvious for it to him.
>> ARTICLE
I'm telling you. It's gotta be the teacher, this is so weird. The way he was sweating when Satoru saw the candy, he was just trying to cover his tracks.
>> ARTICLE
It's gotta be the teacher.

Like, why was he in the place Satoru and his mom were at, *in his car*? Don't forget the whole reason why Satoru was there in the first place: to keep track of that little girl, Aya Nakanishi. Seems to me that the teacher was watching her and he just stumbled upon Satoru and his mom. 

Second thing is, that car scene. Not just the candy part, but also his answer to Satoru's question (how to befriend strangers). He was saying things about making them put their guard down, which sounds like the type of advice the killer would give to the other guy, Yuki. (Notice how Yuki is friends with this Aya Nakanishi girl) 

I also rewatched the episode where present Satoru and Airi's manager was talking to the killer. If you listen the guy's voice closely, it sounds close to the teacher's voice when he's talking seriously (watch the scenes where he's talking to Satoru). Their voices are eerily similar (they also both wear suits all the time too!) 

Lastly, thank god! Hinazuki lives! The other two are the problem now. I'm just worried about kid Satoru because he's walking alone late at night by himself. No matter how old your mind is, if you don't possess the strength to protect yourself, then you need to worry about yourself first. 
>> ARTICLE
There's definitely something up with the teacher. I refuse to believe that he's the killer though, just because I'm stubborn and I don't want to think they'd make it that easy. What popped into my mind was that he's a pedophile.
>> ARTICLE
Wouldn't it be weird if Airi was somehow related to the bully girl? Anyway, at this stage in the story there's no way the killer hasn't been introduced, and it's seemingly more and more believable that it really is Sensei. I mean who else could it be at this point? 9 episodes deep and he's literally the only one that it could be. It doesn't help that Satoru's mother knew the killer and knew him well...what other men have we seen her in contact with?

Either way, Satoru is still going about this the wrong way, he's just delaying the inevitable instead of figuring out who the killer is and stopping them.

Something is bothering me about this episode regarding the teacher. When the killer came to the bus when Kayo was there, he was wearing regular boots because he kicked that box and left that print. Now after Satoru telling Sensei about where they hid Kayo, not only is the stuff gone but they also saw that the boots were now covered in plastic to not leave foot prints. On top of the candy thing, I'm highly suspicious of Sensei.
>> ARTICLE
Teacher cant be the killer anymore and girl's ending disapointed me so much xo
>> ARTICLE
I highly doubt it's the teacher. Do you honestly think a well written anime like this one is honestly going to give you all the evidence then actually reveal the killer to be the teacher. It's obvious it's red herrings and that they are tricking you, it's a shame that most of you actually go along with it. My bet it is Kenya. 
>> ARTICLE
I am 99% sure it's teacher for these important reasons. 1) The killer didn't know that the girl was a boy. So in that reasoning the only others that could have known was from at school. Leading towards the teacher in throwing off everyone. 2) The teacher had fucking truckload of pedo lolipops in his car. I am guessing this is a way to lure little girls in to talking to him or has he explained his charm. Once he knows about details in their lives he can then extrapolate and find weaknesses. 3) He is very sharp and has high intuition and is very good at hiding his true personality. We don't know yet why he is killing little girls but we shall soon find out. Also another clue is if he is new to that school since there was a killer 3 years ago he could have just gotten into that district. I also get a weird vibe from watching his character like he's def concealing something. Satouru is in danger that's for sure. Those two are way too friendly. Oh and someone else pointed out on here that when satouru and his mother saw the killer try to abduct a child he was eating ice cream with her and that accounts for his seductive charm, using sweets.
>> ARTICLE
It's the first they reference Satoru's father as far as I remember. It would be kind of a dick move if the culprit is the father, though.

I just realized that the teacher could very well be Satoru's father.

KAYO IS SAVED!!! [](#bestiathumbsup "Nice job, Satoru!")

Sad that we probably won't see her anymore though...

BUT! 3 episodes left and Satoru plans to save Hiromi and Aya, the serial killer is still on the loose, and the teacher is fucking hard to figure out! He does seem to genuinely care about the Kayo case and what Satoru has done. But goddamn that reaction just before Satoru found the candies. His explanation though... IT ALSO FEELS REAL AND THAT HE'S NOT LYING! The twin tailed girl beside Satoru, she gon' die won't she? She's the alternative to Kayo or something.

I don't know though, that honest "I've been hurt in the past..." when Satoru asked him why he isn't married yet could be misread as "I've been hurt in the past and now I'm taking it out on little girls." ... too far fetched though. At most if it was such a traumatic experience that messed up his mind he'd mostly take it out on women and not children. And we're still in the past, what's gonna happen in the future now that Satoru changed a major event? Surely that has some significant effect on future events as per most other time travelling shows and anime.

He's changing so much of the past that I'm sure the attempted victims of the murderer will change too from the girl who bullied to himself.

CANDYYYYYY! I still think its him candy or not *continues eating candy*
>> ARTICLE
THE CANDY IS A LIE
>> ARTICLE
GUYS. I'VE FIGURED IT OUT. I KNOW WHO THE KILLER IS! AND I HAVE PROOF!!!

Okay, so the other ones may seem a little far fetched, but I assure you, the last one is definitely true.

One, the Sensei and the hideout. The Sensei asked Satoru where they hid Kayo and he told him it was on the bus. Suddenly, they go back, and all evidence of the killer is suddenly gone, as if the killer knew that there was someone there. Suspicious, no?

Two, the candy. It seems innocent, using candy I'm place of smoking, right? I say it was just an excuse to cover it up. I say, he used that candy to lure the kids he kidnapped. He gives them the candy, they think he's nice, they go with him, and they get killed.

The others you can argue with, I'll give you that. But I have one final piece of irrefutable evidence. HIS CAR. That's right ladies and gentlemen. The car he drives to pick up Satoru and his mom is a blue four wheel drive, THE EXACT same car drivend by the killer in episode one. I checked myself. You are welcome to do so as well. While it's hard to see in the last episode because of the darkness, you can see in between the flashes of lights from the roadside lights that the color and shape and size of the Sensei's car is completely idenical to the one driven by the killer.

Thoughts? Comments? 
>> ARTICLE
I doubt he would have the same car for almost 20 years and it still work. Plus, the car used in the first episode was a rental, as said by Satoru's mother.

How much of the manga is left to adapt considering the manga just ended?

Episode 8 hit almost exactly the half-way mark in the manga.  Off the top of my head I think like, 19 chapters left to adapt after this episode?

So 4 episodes to adapt about 18 chapters worth of stuff?

that's my understanding.  It's doable, considering how little happens in some of the end-game chapters, but we'll see how it turns out.  

>> ARTICLE
So nobody thinks its the teacher? Satoru had to grab that white paper like thing for the candy to spill out. It could have been a rag he soaks in chloroform did nobody think of that? Also, the stuff in the bus is only gone after Satoru tells the teacher that's where they hid kayo. The teacher also admits earlier that he was trying to help kayo, but only got so far so he may have been planning on killing her this whole time. That last one might be a leap but im not sure why we gave up so quickly on it being him
>> ARTICLE
> It could have been a rag he soaks in chloroform did nobody think of that?

That was my first reaction, but sensei is still the biggest red herring in existence.  If it is him, then I think a lot of viewers will be disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
You change the past, you change the future. Because you saved Kayo doesn't mean that the other murders will go according to plan...

This is what I think, the Murderer targets kids that are alone. In order for you to recieve something you need to give something in return. 

Well Kayo is not alone anymore... but the bully girl is now alone instead as a side effect of saving Kayo.

I think it can be possible that the target also shifts from Kayo to her... but let's wait and see how this masterpiece plays out.
>> ARTICLE
Yashiro (the teacher) has goddamn candy in his car. If that doesn't say that he's pedophile kidnapper, I don't know what does.

So are those candy wrappers on the ground inside the bus or just scrap paper at around the 19:39 mark on CR?

So... Why wont Satoru just tell Hiromi to have a haircut? That way he wont be mistaken as a girl. Problem solved right?
>> ARTICLE
"Good acting is supposed to be invisible" is a common way to measure good acting in western media. The problem is that due to the language barrier, acting in anime is invisible to me unless it's absolutely horrible.

But today I was dumbfounded, I found the acting so fucking good that I simply could not stop thinking about it, I believe it's the first time I've actually been transmitted subtle emotions through voice acting, ever. If I could rate it 11/10 I would, hell, if I could I would give it a 20, it's just beyond anything I've seen and will probably be beyond anything else for many seasons.
>> ARTICLE
I thought it was the sensei, but then I realized, he wouldn't have kidnapped Sugita Hiromi because he would have known he was a guy, right? After all, Sugita is one of his students. The MO of the kidnapper was (presumably) all females, so it doesn't make sense....
>> ARTICLE
Jumping away from the sketchy ass teacher, seriously man can you be any more suspicious?

One thing I found interesting is that all three girls have been confirmed to be connected to Yuuki, I believe Hiromi was confirmed or is at least assumed to be connected. Personally I feel like Yuuki's father may be the culprit and Yuuki himself being an unknowing participant. Yuuki works with his father, no doubt they end up talking while they're on the job, Yuuki probably goes on about his planes and the kids he's hung out with. Chances are he mentions Hinazuki always being alone, target one acquired. Then he brings up Aya and maybe talks about her schedule that seems like it's a routine that never changes, target two acquired. Then there's Hiromi, what are the chances Yuuki never bothers mentioning, or even knows himself, that Hiromi is a boy, target three confirmed. Yuuki could only know all this information if he spent time with the kids, scapegoat confirmed.
>> ARTICLE
Very interesting. We haven't seen any of the father's character yet, right? We saw him call Yuuki to his truck on the night Satoru stopped X day, and we heard him yell to Yuuki that dinner was ready, but that's been it, yes? I wonder if they'll introduce him properly soon. Meanwhile, the teacher becomes more and more suspicious, but are we meant to really buy into it or is he just another red herring...
>> ARTICLE
I'm inclined to join the Teacher Is The Murderer train if it wasn't for this episode actually. They introduced Kayo's grandmother to the mix, someone unseen and unmentioned previous to this episode. Yuuki's dad has been mentioned... not ruling him out until it's absolutely confirmed.

My current theory... X Day was actually delayed, the first time, not entirely because Satoru kept Kayo around for their birthday party. It was because he threw the rock at the window when he was trying to give Yuuki an alibi for the night.
>> ARTICLE
I love how we're shown such a vast cast of characters. Anyone of them could be the killer. Who could it beeeeeeeee. /s
>> ARTICLE
Guys... I just remembered... Satoru's Grim Reaper story he told Airi... he's interfering a lot... just like the reaper...

I'm scared.

Am I the only one who's thinking, now that the killer moved out from the bus, he probably has made the children's hideout as his new hideout...???
>> ARTICLE
Why would sensei panic when satoru discovered the candy..
>> ARTICLE
Satoru's mom continues to prove her omniscience in this episode by saying what Satoru is thinking and also by carrying too many groceries, expecting Satoru to be there ready to help her. lol But that opening scene was really fucking nice, where Kayo is willing to protect Satoru's mom from her own mother. Although it was definitely bitter sweet to see Kayo being taken away by child services to live with her grandmother. Also, it is really interesting how the first time around when Kayo ended up getting murdered and didn't show up to school, the teacher said that Kayo went to go live with her grandmother, and that is exactly what happened this time.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still not sure about the teacher. The fact that he's the most obvious suspect kind of makes me think that he's not the killer, but the fact that Satoru hasn't seemed to suspect him at all, makes me think he might be the killer.
>> ARTICLE
GUYS I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S THE TEACHER. The reason why is because the killer killed Hiromi thinking he was a girl, only to find out that she was a guy. I'm assuming the teacher would already know that Hiromi is a guy, therefore, it can't be the teacher... right???
>> ARTICLE
Satoru pointed out that to throw the police off, Hiromi was killed as he looked like a girl but was a boy. Therefore, Satoru believes that the killer must know that Hiromi is actually a boy and not a girl. The teacher would make the most sense that applies to this logic. 
>> ARTICLE
So ... Satoru is Sicilian?
>> ARTICLE
I actually laughed about that lolipop scene xD
Exactly like me
>> ARTICLE
I'm late but I think this all adds up now. Do you guys remember early on in the series when Satoru first saw the kidnapper in the parking lot of the grocery store? And Satoru's mom said she recognized him but couldn't confirm 100%? So my theory is that the teacher is the killer because during elementary school Satoru's mom surely has to have talked to the teacher. And now with all these scenes in the latest episode including Mom and the Teacher, I just can't stop feeling like it's the teacher. Maybe she turned him down and he killed her. I DONT KNOW MAN ITS SKETCHING ME OUT BUT THATS MY THEORY, I REALLY HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE BUT LIKE FUUUUUUUCK THIS SHOW.
>> ARTICLE
It's beyond obvious it's the teacher at this point. Not to mention, with only 3 episodes left it would be stupid to introduce a random character as the killer. They dropped so many hints this episode.
>> ARTICLE
So the teacher could be a red herring....or he just had a really traumatic experience with girls satoru's age and kills them.
>> ARTICLE
[He's got three lollipops shoved into his mouth, how can you people even doubt this huge, adorable dork?](http://i.imgur.com/EwFGJOS.jpg) Specially with the amount of clues that just scream "red-herring" and his raging crush for awesome action!mom Sachiko. But then, who doesn't have a crush on Sachiko?  
It makes me happy to know Kayo will be safe but that scene with the car driving away broke me a little. Poor Satoru.  
I like that even though he can't tell them about his power Satoru is relaying a bit on Kenya and Hiromi and opening up to them, because he's sort of got allies now.  Yukki kun sure talks to a lot of lonely children, though. That's very nice and cool of him but holy fudge, no wonder he got used ^^^still ^^^very ^^^nice ^^^of ^^^him, ^^^though, ^^^best ^^^boy ^^^Yukki.

Yeah, I giggled a little in that Hiromi scene.  
Overall a really nice breather episode but that just gives me the feeling that the next three episodes are going to be a roller-coaster.

[This episode in a nutshell.](http://i.imgur.com/yGmY6MH.jpg)

But what I found interesting was how meticulously and professionally Satoru kept tabs on the two victims, just like a stalker... I had a theory that there's a "He's actually the killer" trope going on, and this just furthers along that scenario. Or red herring again.
>> ARTICLE
I think there will be a subplot where the cops have 11yo Satoru as the suspect (or in league with the suspect) because of all his stalking.  Maybe smart-kun will also point the finger at him because it's only logical.

Played too much Life is Strange to guess [LiS](/n "it's probably the teacher and the girl dies in the end </3") 
>> ARTICLE
For a second I thought he was going to confess to Satoru, I was like OOOOHHHHHH SHOOOOOOOOTTTTT
>> ARTICLE
I think the reason they showed the bully girl at the end leaving alone is because she's gonna be the next victim of the murderer. Because of what Satoru said to defend Kayo in this timeline, she was isolated as a liar and a thief by her classmates, being forced onto a similar type of detachment that Kayo felt at the beginning of the series. 

She's gonna be alone walking home and the killer is gonna take advantage of that. 

I also think it's interesting how hard they tried to make Sensei seem like the killer in this episode. In my opinion, it's a trick by the writers to make us understand how easily it is to be fooled by appearances. It kind of mirrors the killer's tendency to frame his victims, like how Yuuki was apparently framed because a lot of the evidence of the earlier kidnappings pointed towards him. 

It's a pretty unique type of writing, and one of the best mystery shows I've seen. The writers do such a great job at making you suspicious of every character, by throwing you little hints and clues that could be marked off as innocent but under the surface seem a little suspicious.
>> ARTICLE
Why isn't Kayo's mum in prison
>> ARTICLE
I do believe it is the teacher also and it could be linked into why he is a single man at the moment. He did state he had some kind of bad experience which could lead him to do what he does. I also read somewhere they are doing a bit on the killer after this manga is over like his past experiences that have led him to become what he is now.
>> ARTICLE
They are for sure painting bully girl as a target. Notice the red she's now wearing and the backpack.
>> ARTICLE
I would of thought that preventing Kayo from getting killed would change the timeline enough to prevent his mothers murder but I'm gonna guess that only thing that changes is **who** gets killed in Kayo's place.
>> ARTICLE
So have any theories about the motive of the killer been brought up? 
This anime strives to make believable, relatable characters and following that thought then the killer should have a good motive for killing those three kids (even if said motive is that he is a pedo or just plain enjoy murdering specifically young girls). 

For what we have seen so far I think we can rule out any pedo related motives as there as been no mention at all of that. However that leaves us with no clear motive to work with, these are not kidnap and randsom cases but kidnap and murder cases leaving us with motives such as the "pleasure" of killing. From there I would think about why the killer targets young girls and not any other demografic, if lets say the teacher is the killer, his interaction with satoru in the car were he told him he had past "bad experience" with girls could be seen as a girl (the same age as the killer's targets) hurt Yashiro so bad he developed a sense of pleasure from taking "revenge" by killing girls of the same age. I have been wondering about trap boy too, in the anime it is presented that he was killed because he looks like a girl while our superhero believe he got killed to cover up who the real killer is. (It is indeed suspicious that 2 out of 3 killed children are from the same class). 

My theory would be formed around this line of thinking:
Teach is the killer and is doing it for revenge/pleasure....
I really hope the creator have a better motive we don't know about...
>> ARTICLE
That scene when Kayo's mom grabbed a shovel and attacked sachiko. Pretty much clear that she  is a very voilent woman, good thing that kayo is finally taken away from her.  


The teacher was portrayed as a good guy and is doing the best he can to help his students. I might believe that he is really on the good side if not for the hints during the car scene. He talked to satoru regarding on how to get close to someone you don't know. The advise he gave is kinda creepy, he was using weapon, weakness, guard, comfortable, bribe and other words to explain. Which in hind sight is a killer's perspective. Also, the candies can be used to lure kids to make them comfortable and drop their guard.  


based on the ep, I can say that 80% chance that the killer is the teacher.

Last night I wanted to watch 1 episode of Erased to get a taste of this anime because I heard good things about it. End up staying up til 3 am and watched all 9 eps. Even though i like discussions, this is one of those anime that I prefer to watch after all episodes are out. The constant cliffhangers are slowly killing me. I think im gonna end up reading the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Don't read the manga yet. I have read in the comments here on reddit that it is at an even worse cliffhanger than all those anime episodes have been so far and the wait for the next chapter is longer than only a week. D:

This information is the only thing that's keeping me from reading it at the moment. The manga supposedly finishes together with the anime series in about a month, I think it might be better to fully enjoy the anime now and pick up the manga when the anime finished.

Fortunately the last two episodes had no cliffhangers. It gives us a bit of time to relax (and feel safe) but I have the feeling it will get back to us soon, killing us off with the cliffhanger of doom. lol
>> ARTICLE
Okay, so regardless of whether sensei is the killer or not, why doesn't Satoru seem to find him suspicious? I thought he was about to for a second there in the car, but then he seemed to accept that explanation without any hesitation.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly, Yashiro is my number one suspect. Not for the candy, as that seems like a red herring. My whole issue goes back to his involvment with child services.

Somehow, Kayo's mom always knew to stay away when they visited. My theory is that Yashiro was indeed calling child services, but then immediately calling Kayo's mother afterwards to warn, priming Kayo yo become his eventual victim while also casting doubt on the mother and protecting himself.

His involvement with the final incident that gets Kayo away may be self preservative. Satoru's involvment and determination would make Kayo a dangerous and unattractive victim with so much attention on her, so Yashiro would have given up on killing her.

At the same time, it also seems to simple that Yashiro is the killer. Super excited to see where the mystery goes. I love whodunnits.
>> ARTICLE
I sort of wonder how the car scene with the candy would have gone in the manga. It leaves a bit to imagination in watching/interpreting how he reacts and handles the situation in the show. In manga though, everything is of relevance and I feel like it would have made it blatantly obvious who the killer is.

Disclaimer: I haven't read the manga but I'm of the bandwagon that the teacher has to be the guy
>> ARTICLE
The scene was exactly the same in the manga.
>> ARTICLE
I get that it was the same conceptually, but as a manga reader, were you able to ascertain the same feeling of him getting caught, then playing it off beautifully? 

For example, at that point in the manga, who did you think was the killer? If you thought the teacher going into that scene, did it leave any doubt in your kind after reading it?
>> ARTICLE
The scene was the same verbatim. It could not be more the same.
>> ARTICLE
It's impossible for it to be the same. One of them is on paper, the other animated. I can't stress that enough.
>> ARTICLE
Read the manga then, Chapter 25 pages 21 and 22. The only difference is Satoru's mom isn't there, as they combined the two instances where Satoru is in the car.
>> ARTICLE
It has to be the teacher. I was on the fence with the candy, because it made him so human, even though having that much candy is dodgy as hell. It was the bus that's confirmed it for me. 


The bus was previously where the killer stashed equipment. Obviously believing it to be abandoned (Which a teacher would know). Now! The scene with Satoru and the teacher talking about the hideout, the teacher now knows that they used that bus, AND SO THE KILLER COMES BACK AND REMOVES THE EQUIPMENT (in a hurry judging by the boxes and general disarray) I'm sorry, why would the killer move his stuff? He has no need. Unless he knows that it is in danger of being found.



Now here is what finishes it for me. The covered shoes. Why? Maybe because you found out a few minutes ago your lair was compromised. And you can't change your shoe because there is no time what with you having to do it as early as possible before the meddling kids arrive there after school. Maybe the killer did it earlier then the talk with Satoru? Then why the covered shoe? Surely the suspect could have used different shoes, he/she clearly has at least another pair of boots. So the only way covered shoes make sense is if you know somebody is on to you. And the only person other then the gang that know about the bus is teach.


Lastly, he is trying way to hard. When Satoru compliments him, look at that smile, that ain't normal. listen to his under tones of wanting to make Kayo smile. See his reaction with the mother. He has all these little slips that make me wary of him. Also, how he describes getting a girl, using sport or cooking as a weapon, not tool, not trick, weapon. And letting her guard down. Look at that choice of wording. His reaction was also super out of proportion for that candy. And look at the reaction when he hears the mother. Go back and look at it. That reaction and his actions after tell me he was paranoid way above what is ordinary. Look at that relief. Satoru is confused, teach is goddamn relieved.

>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking that Sensei is not the killer because he would know that Hiromi is a boy, and it was stated that the killer probably only kidnapped him because they thought he was a girl. I think the anime is setting him up as a red herring. I was convinced he was the killer until I made this realization. That said, Sensei may just be a bisexual pedophile and not a heterosexual one.

The teacher is being made WAY too suspicious. I don't think it's him anymore. If it is I'm going to be disappointed :( 

Anyone else think Satorou's constant activity in the kidnapping activity will make him a target for the kidnapper? Maybe he's too much in the spotlight to be viable. Or maybe the kidnapper will start seeing some consistency between his choice of targets and see him as a threat that needs to be eliminated.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's him as well. He's way too friendly and Satoru trusts him too much which makes him extremely suspicious in my eyes.

Or it was Yuuki after all.. or his dad or someone and they're trying to get our focus away from these persons.

> Anyone else think Satorou's constant activity in the kidnapping activity will make him a target for the kidnapper? 
I've been thinking that for quite some time as well. I'm still wary about the title of the show and am sure it will have some significance later on. Meaning that Satoru needs to vanish for everything to work out in the end.

Could just be me wanting there to at least be one person Satorou can really depend on but I agree maybe the story isn't going that far deep into plot twist land.

The episode title was accurate. Though now that Hinazuki's ark is over I kinda hope that there's more focus on the mystery aspect. Part because the mystery is super interesting and part because its going to be super hard to try and one-up Hinazuki. Honestly if they would have spent the rest of the episode after Hinazuki left finding leads on who the killer is, then have episodes 10 and 11 close off the show I don't think I'd mind. Whatever they do though, this will probably be one of my all time favorite anime' in the end.

no they are not doing that it just gives us some understanding how this vicious cycle of abuse started, i mean most people who are abusers were abused at some point so they are trying to make her character feel real although she still is a shit mom.

What the hell was up with that ominous ending? That girl must be the new target or something.



And the theory that the killer wanted Hinazuki first before killing the other girls is busted which begs the question once again; why did Satoru focus on solely protecting Kayo instead of trying to watch everyone including a core friend?

The idea that he did it to stop the catalyst of killings is incorrect as in this episode Satoru is now trying to protect Hiromi and the other girl with Kayo now gone, which indicates to me that they are suddenly targets all of a sudden with the main target now gone.


That said though they are really trying to sell the teacher as the bad guy aren't they? If this show's main selling point is mystery they'd better not make the teacher the killer (which to me at this point it's a red herring).
>> ARTICLE
Manga readers have confirmed that he does actually pay close attention to the other two, this is skipped in the anime though.
>> ARTICLE
I think he focused on Kayo because she was also being abused by her mother.  The others are fine aside from being murder targets.

> And the theory that the killer wanted Hinazuki first before killing the other girls is busted

No it isn't. We haven't seen Kayo since she moved. She could be dead right now. God I hope she isn't, but to say that theory is busted is incorrect. It's not busted until we see Kayo again.

And even if it does end up getting busted, you have to consider what Satoru is acting on. The two times this has happened prior, Kayo was the first victim. Even when he altered the future by a day, Kayo was still next. You can't really blame him for assuming Kayo was the only one he had to protect initially.
>> ARTICLE
Each episode keeps getting better. 
>> ARTICLE
This show gets me all worked up and anxious even when things go well. I can't stop worrying that Kayo isn't really home free yet. I wanted him to go back to the future/present and see her still alive in the worst way.

I also can't tell if the author is trying to make it look like it's the teacher but I've been convinced for a while now that the teacher is the killer. That talk about getting them to let their guard down, only little kids being targeted and all of that candy and the way he panicked when Satoru found it. If he really just uses it instead of smoking I don't think he would be that nervous about it.

Now that I've watched this episode I'm forced to wait a week to find out what happens next. It's like torture.

Who are the possible suspects at this point of the anime, besides the teacher? Satoru talked about his father on this episode, perhaps it could be pointing to a character we haven't seen?

Kenya is such a bro! I like how he actually wants to help Satoru solve this case even if its hard to belive (1% true) (99% fake), he still believes him. 
>> ARTICLE
Another absolutely solid episode.

I'm glad they made Kayo's mother a bit more fleshed out. It doesn't justify any of the atrocities that she committed, but it's better than just hating a flat evil character.

I really, really want to like the teacher, he seems like such a good guy, and he is pretty interesting to boot. The candy scene was kinda funny, even if it turns out to be more than a red herring.

Satoru drew an interesting parallel with the killer this episode, tracking the people he wanted to save and learning their schedule in an effort to save them. It's so easy to fall into a certain trap in the pursuit of justice.

Sudden intense girl from Satoru's class leaves some questions 
>> ARTICLE
YOOO who swings a shovel like that! Kayo's mom is such a bitch.

[(This is how you shovel someone).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y95xwCzJQ0E)
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully we'll see more Kayo. I'm glad she's ok now but I have a feeling she's going to be in danger again.
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking the next time we see Kayo is in bed when we go back to adult Satoru. Of course, that would be a little stereotypical, and this anime is anything but stereotypical.
>> ARTICLE
You're a piece of shit
>> ARTICLE
Ye what my man said. You some shit 
>> ARTICLE
So the killer is definitely the teacher but I'm not really upset about it. For two reasons I guess: initially, the show hooked me with the mystery plot about finding the killer, but it really won me over with Satoru's relationships with Kayo and Sachiko. My viewpoint on what I cared about most shifted from who the killer is to hoping that Satoru is able to save Kayo and Sachiko.

The other reason is that after seeing worstmom2016's backstory (which was shockingly well done and believable), I am convinced they can give Yashiro an interesting and compelling backstory that will make him a satisfying character despite his turn being a bit obvious.

This is still one of the better anime I've ever seen even just due to the depth of the characters and the relationships they have. The writers have somehow figured out a way to make me care more about Sachiko and Kayo every week and it's an impressive thing to witness.

I'M NOT READY. MY HEART IS HURTING FROM RECAP COMING UP. STOP IT.

Read the manga and I wonder if the studio have enough time to end the story, and they are still making 6.5.
>> ARTICLE
Is the manga long enough to fit in one cour, or would it be 2+?
>> ARTICLE
Definitely enough material to have fit a 2 course, but they have already skated past some material and even despite that they will still have to skim past even more material in order to fit everything into 4 episodes
>> ARTICLE
Depends. I think it could have been 2, but as it is it should have been one. With the direction it's heading, you reach a second.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe they'll have a longer episode or two.
>> ARTICLE
Is it worth watching at all?
>> ARTICLE
#YES
>> ARTICLE
If you mean this specific episode then dunno, might be worth it if you're not binging. But if you mean the series as a whole then yes yes and yes.

I'm watching it, just wondering if its a recap with new content or if its just recap stuff 
>> ARTICLE
WOAH! RECAP
>> ARTICLE
Fuck. Recap episodes usually happen right before everything goes down.

Im not ready


>> ARTICLE
According to Wikipedia there are going to be 12 episodes, so we only have four left

I'm not ready either

[](#scaredmio)
>> ARTICLE
actually you should be ready because afaik this show is pulling an FMA:B. Meaning the manga will end in march and this show will should cover the ending of the manga. For such a plot driven show it can't get any better.
>> ARTICLE
>  going to be 12 episodes

I don't believe they have covered half of the story.
>> ARTICLE
This episode covered half of chapter 23 from 40 so far. this episode covered ~2 chapters, others covered 3. they sometimes skip a few things (like before his latest jump back in time there was a big backflash segment that wasnt adapted) but in general they are on their way to end it.

also: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2016-01-08/erased-boku-dake-ga-inai-machi-anime-to-portray-ending-of-original-manga/.97329

they may skip some parts like many shows do, but it should feature the ending.
>> ARTICLE
> (like before his latest jump back in time there was a big backflash segment that wasnt adapted

I think i accidentally skipped that in the manga. oops.
>> ARTICLE
And this is exactly what I am afraid of.
As a manga reader I just don't know how they are going to stuff 20 chapters in just 4 episodes if they have announced that the anime is going to cover the manga ending.
So far, they've covered 23ish chapters (out of 43). I really don't want the ending to feel rushed, especially given how good they have been doing at covering the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh a lot of the recent chapter could probably be condensed into an episode or two as its a lot of monologue and reflection. 
>> ARTICLE
The whole recent arc (34 to 40 so far) can be a single episode. It's just the arc in the latest episode should have concluded already this episode instead of giving us a cliffhanger, for things to fit properly in 12 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
May be it would be like Shigatsu, in that the manga and the naime ended the same way at the same time. Maybe the mangaka(?) let the animators know of the plot beforehand.
>> ARTICLE
Why is there a recap episode? I thought recap episodes replaced regular episodes but we got one **and** a regular episode?

[](#niatilt)
>> ARTICLE
Maybe the time travel is about to complicated, and this is here for reference.

>> ARTICLE
Maybe they know everyone hates the recap episode, but the recap episode is useful for people who were late to the party. Maybe instead of making the people who've been there since the beginning suffer through a recap week or sticking it to the people who were late to the party and they've done the thing that makes everyone happy. It would be crazy fucking smart/ awesome if that were the case.
>> ARTICLE
Is that who it's for? I would imagine it being more useful for people who've been watching week to week and may have forgotten something from a few months ago. 
>> ARTICLE
Recap episodes are made when you don't think the weekly episode can be finished in time to air and it's a common occurrence for shows with high quality animation. They probably didn't think they'd finish and threw together a recap episode but made it in the end.

I'd put them on par with each other, although I still don't feel quite as much attachment to Sachiko yet. Of course, episode 8 went a long way toward improving that.
>> ARTICLE
I'd say Hana edges her out because Sachiko is an amazing mother in relatively normal conditions (as she's aware of anyway) whereas Hana's life and struggles as she raises two transforming human-wolf children on her own is anything but normal. Perhaps Sachiko is more relatable to many, but relatively speaking she has it quite easy.

I was talking with some friends last night about the most recent ep of Inai Machi and I told them "Satoru's mom is really awesome, but Hana from Wolf Children is easily the best anime mom."

Absolutely. But this particular baka nano is significantly different to all the others where it was cold or somewhat serious. She's actually playing here.

Oh god I hope this ends well. I can legitimately see this anime ending horribly for the immense impact it could have on the "hero's aren't real" point it's been making. That would be amazing. It would put it up there with Grave of the Fireflies in terms of phenomenal emotional anime you MUST watch but NEVER want to watch again..... But I really just want a happy ending for her and will be quite angry if I don't get that.

But I'm worried both ways. It has the chance for historicly timeless anime greatness if it chooses that road... But then it also can't possibly fill hearts with the sheer level of happiness that it could be building up to.

Both are opportunities thrown away. Either way I don't think they can actually make people unhappy with either ending option at this point. Both will have an impact because they've made us miserable for so long so far.

> Oh god I hope this ends well.

I have to give this show credit for being one of few mysteries where I can honestly say I don't know what is going to happen in the end and I'm desperately trying to avoid spoilers.  Rokka no Yuusha sucked for me because I figured out the end like 1/3 into the show, but ERASED... I've got nothing.  My gut is to blame the teacher, but I'm really not sure if that is an obvious red herring they are throwing at us or if the fucker is legit a dickbag.

I am praying this show ends happy.  I'm not even religious, but I'm praying with all my might.  I hate seeing kids suffer, it really gets to me.  Seeing Kayo cry over breakfast destroyed me.  Please god give her happiness, *plleeeassee*.  Augh the suspense is real!  Week after week >.<

My problem is that every time I buy a LN, I immediately  find the translation  online and don't  need to translate it anymore. Like, I look for it beforehand, say oh well, i'll  get it and translate it myself, and then suddenly am able to find it.

Until you start finding series that are either not fully translated, had DMCA against them or the group just lost interest.

Personally, I buy the untranslated LN even if it has been translated, as long as I think it'll be interesting. The original Japanese is always so much more enjoyable to read. As for the price problem of having to actually buy them if they're not translated, [it's not too bad](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/offer-listing/B00B485NLI/ref=tmm_pap_used_olp_sr?ie=UTF8&condition=used&qid=1456719884&sr=8-4) if you buy [used and in bulk](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/offer-listing/B005OOT2L0/ref=tmm_other_meta_binding_used_olp_sr?ie=UTF8&condition=used&qid=1456719847&sr=8-1).

Ah, I can understand that. It really sucks trying to get past the barricade of "It takes me 5 minutes to read a sentence". You have to cope with some painfully slow and monotonous reading experiences, and you need a lot of that experience to get any faster.

I wish you luck in getting faster:)

It's sickening how cheap manga and LNs are in Japan. They're already pretty cheap in my country (anything from 40% to 60% of the US price) and I'd still pay less for shipping when buying those giant bulk packs.

There's no way to say this without sounding judgmental, and I apologize in advance, but most people I've known to take Japanese classes that *also* love anime are the most stereotypically weeaby people I've ever met.  Like, they can't carry a conversation about *anything else* interesting.  Might be one of those "the odds are good, but the goods are odd" things.  So I'm not sure about that advice ;P

I literally laughed out loud in the office because of your comment.

What you said is not funny, but how much I can relate to it is :D.

>> ARTICLE
:D, well I took a Japanese class back in University, just because I watch so many anime, and thought that understanding it directly without the need of subs would be great. Just before the first session,  I thought I saw an opportunity. There was some good looking girls in the class, and since they were already talking about anime and such, we could possible be friends(!).

Long story short, I have sadly saw that "they can't carry a conversation about anything else" (note that I omitted the "interesting" part of the sentence).

The phrase "the odds are good, but the goods are odd" fits to the situation so well, it made me laugh out loud. In fact I'm still grinning like a fool :)...
>> ARTICLE
Heh, yeah.  It's a shame too.  I knew some cool people that were that way, but it just got hard to talk to them when I'd be discussing work or travel or whatever and somehow they'd always constantly relate it back to anime.

Glad to have made ya smile though ;)

They generally are a little asocial, yet they also are very sweet in fact. The problem is, as soon as they find a contact point in the relationship they just clutch at it so hard, they left no room for anything else.

Yet we should agree that if you want to find someone who has similar interests with you and watches anime, attending a Japanese class increases your chances. You have a room full of people which fits one of your criteria, that is a hard thing to find anywhere else (not counting anime-manga conventions).

I don't think he had any intention of anything dirty, but when you're in a bed with a girl you're down with, that would seem the natural response of a 29 year old man with his mom in the way.

It's just a weird situation because of his actual age, so his normal adult brain/experiences responded out loud before he had a real chance to think about it.  He's made it fairly clear he isn't interested in her in any sexual way, or at least he tries not to.
>> ARTICLE
He probably just wanted to talk without his mom being right there. Nothing weird or anything imo, when I was 10ish I definitely didn't want to talk to friends in front of a parent

Just saying \_()_/ 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not the guy you originally responded to, and I generally look at number of comments more than upvotes when I think about how popular a show is. Though KLK has a lot fewer than I remember, considering the hype for that show. the sub has grown a good amount since it aired though. UBW on the other hand has pretty similar numbers of comments despite being a year ago and having fewer upvotes. 
>> ARTICLE
uhhh, hate to burst your bubble, but I'm looking through the top comments on the final episode for KLK and UBW comparing to episode 4 of Erased

UBW episode 25: approx 1400 - 1500 (8 months ago)
[although the most it got was on episode 15 with 1600-1700 comments]

KLK episode 24: approximately 1100-1200 (1 year ago)

Erased episode 4: 1500 - 1600 (1 month ago)

this show is extremely popular, enough so that a quarter through it's already being discussed as much as both of those shows on their final episode, this is comment wise

HECK THE MOST RECENT EPISODE HAS OVER 2000 COMMENTS
>> ARTICLE
There is also just more people here than the previous years aswell.
>> ARTICLE
Now to be fair there are 2 major differences in play. One being size fo the sub since those aired (moreso speaking about klk here) and two being the amount of "extra" that comes with the episodes airing.

When klk was airing a good 30% of this subs frontpage could be eaten by klk fanart/discussions at any given time. Even UBW ate up quite a bit of the front page while airing. Erased has an insanely popular episode thread but it doesn't eat up the frontpage like those did.

I can definitely see where he's coming from. Some shows like chaika ate up a lot of "sub space" while airing whereas more popular/well received like one punch man didn't even eat up that much. If you don't check the sub during airing days it's very much possible not to see erased brought up, whereas there was NO way you could casually browse this sub without seeing klk fanart/topics when it was airing.

The hype for OPM was fuckin' *real* on this sub.  Shame ERASED hasn't received nearly the hype.  Personally I think it is more deserving, at least, as long as it ends as strong as it has been going so far.
>> ARTICLE
Erased has recieved A LOT of hype tbh.
>> ARTICLE
It's received a lot of praise, certainly, but not really all that much hype, not compared to OPM.  OPM's hype was off the fuckin' charts.  Every thread, even if it had nothing to do with OPM, turned into a OPM thread.  You couldn't speak ill of it without being downvoted into oblivion either.  Even *before* OPM was released the chatter over it was god damn insane.

ERASED has some of that, but not nearly to the same degree of annoyance.  At least, not that I've seen.  Dagashi Kashi tho, that was hyped to hell.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think you should be comparing it too much in hype. OPM is a HYPE show. The comic (the poorly drawn one) brings hype, the manga brings hype and so does the anime. It was long awaited and had a huge fanbase. 

If we just don't compare it to OPM, Erased has been getting an incredible amount of attention and praise. It's the 2nd most upvoted episode discussion thread, it breeds tons of great gifs every episode, there are fanart submissions everywhere, there are discussion threads about it all the time, every time someone asks what they should watch people tell them "Watch Erased"
>> ARTICLE
I can totally see ERASED getting 6k upvotes in the final thread unless it really disappoints. 
>> ARTICLE
Mmm, maybe.  We'll see I guess.  After all the shit people on this sub and some youtube personalities give A-1 Pictures, it would be nice to see them put out something that is critically acclaimed for its quality so we don't have to hear about it anymore.

It would mean a guaranteed proper dub of it too, which would be fantastic.  I'm still begging Sentai for a Shirobako one.

aaaaand show is dropped. Fucking stupid bullshit crap story. fuck that author.
>> ARTICLE
As funny as this was am I the only one who thinks this is super fuckin weird? He's 29 right? and she's 11? And the part when they were showering and he was staring at the door with a red face and a gulp? Is this how you really are Satoru? Is this why you're ignoring Hiromi, a victim you actually knew, and focusing on the mostly-random loli? 

EDIT: I definitely agree that you could see it as Satoru still feeling what a kid that age would feel (which also explains why he acts and speaks like a kid perfectly almost immediately), but I wish they could have at least brought it up a little bit and made it clear instead of forcing us to reason out why he isn't a pedohpile.
>> ARTICLE
since we're past this point in the manga, i'll let you know that in the manga, satoru was not agonizing over not walking kayo home in the beginning, but for not reaching out to hiromi after kayo gets abducted (they stopped hanging out with him because his mom doesn't let him go out as much). the manga also didn't have the bath scene last episode, which i could've done without.
>> ARTICLE
Good to know
>> ARTICLE
Well at that point he is actually a child, he may have an adult mind but he is actually a child physically and in age.

Yeah it seems a little weird but he is a kid, I also wouldn't be surprised if part of it is that his mind is actually being effected by how he was as a kid.
>> ARTICLE
Hiromi was killed primarily to throw police off the trail of the real killer.  By preventing the other murders Hiromi is bring saved.  Also probably explains why Satoru included him in his plans over his other friends.
>> ARTICLE
Sure but that isn't something Satoru learned until well after he made his decision to save Hinazuki. You'd think the logical place to start is with the kid you were actually friends with but Satoru more or less began investigating Hinazuki from the get-go, someone he only remembered seeing in the park occassionally (he didn't even remember the time they ran into eachother at the aquarium). 
>> ARTICLE
Satoru felt responsible for Kayo's death because he always saw her standing alone in the park but never did anything about it, and thought thay if he just talked to her nothing would've happened to her. He also decided to get close to Kayo and attempt to save her first because her murder happens first, and if Satoru expects to save Kayo he has to get close to her first. He's already friends with Hiromi so he doesn't need to do anything with him prior to saving him
>> ARTICLE
She's the first girl killed, so you have to start from the top. 
>> ARTICLE
Well there is a somewhat plausible explanation for it. I think it's that he only has the memories of his 29 year old self, but right now his mind and body are at the physical maturity level of an 11 year old, so he's attracted to Kayo. 
>> ARTICLE
Firstly, while his mind is mature, his body is that of a grade schooler. At that age (which is like 11 or 12), he's already hit puberty and would become more aware of girls, so his body is reacting as such. 

Secondly, he's not "ignoring" Hiromi. The information he knows from the future is that out of all 3 victims, Hinazuki is killed first, then Aya Nakanishi and finally Hiromi. 

So of course his priority is the "random loli", she's literally the first person he needs to prevent from getting killed if he wants to solve the mystery and fix the past. 
>> ARTICLE
[Madoka Magica](/s "his feelings for her could be an outgrowth of his desire to save her. pretty much this same dynamic went down between Homura and Madoka in PMMM, down to the repeated time travel.")

Nah, plenty of people think it's weird, but at this point there's just not much point in calling it out. What are we gonna do, call up the Prime Minister and tell him to make the country quit with the weird anime bullshit? Probably not.

Better to just go along with the ride at this point. At least in this case there's a fairly obvious explanation for him experiencing these emotions. He's got his memories, but it's still basically the same body/brain as his 11 year old self. Same reason he keeps letting words slip out. Kids just haven't developed the same filter adults have.

I feel ya though, they could have done without the staring at the door bit IMO.
>> ARTICLE
> What are we gonna do, call up the Prime Minister and tell him to make the country quit with the weird anime bullshit? Probably not.

Yeah, he's still working with an 11 year old brain and 11 year old hormones, despite having a 29 year old mind. It's no surprise that stuff like this happens and it doesn't mean he's actually into an 11 year old girl.

I have some complaints as a manga reader but the anime hasn't yet gotten to them so i'll hold off. 

It's difficult to make arguments against a series like this until it starts to reach the end and you start to get a bigger picture of the events that played out and just how many of them were actually relevant or could have been written better because for all you know, your complaint of the series right now may actually be brought up later on and may be given a reasonable explanation for why something did/didn't happen. 

I can think of a few times reading the manga where I thought "This is such unrealistic bs, why didn't they..." only for the point to be explained in a way that's more realistic than I anticipated.

Rating anime (or calling it AOTS/AOTY) before it even finished airing is jumping the gun, especially when it's only 4 episodes in. There is still of plenty of time for something bad to happen/quality to drop.

As for complaints about the show, I don't have much in particular but similar to Parasyte it didn't hook me like it has reddit or MAL. For me it's a cool concept (time travel done well is always fun) with pretty good execution but nothing jumps out to me as this being anything above maybe an 8. So I guess "not as entertaining as I deem a 9 to be" would be my criticism.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who finds this show to be just okay, here are some of my negatives:

- Time travel rules are too vague and not well defined. They work in the way the writter wants them to work, and not by some logic reasons.

- Pedophilic undertones. I know it can be explained why the MC feels attracted to a 10-year-old girl, but I find it creepy and unnecessary for the plot.

- Villain mother that doesn't have any character depth so far, and that makes her come off as cartoony and one dimentional. Just give her a plausible reason for her to beat her child, that's all I ask.

- Some of the kids talk like full grown adults, and that takes me out of some of the scenes.

I have a couple more, but these are the big ones for me.
>> ARTICLE
> Pedophilic undertones. I know it can be explained why the MC feels attracted to a 10-year-old girl, but I find it creepy and unnecessary for the plot.

I'd explain it being that since he's currently in a 10 year old body he currently has 10 year old hormones but yeah I agree it's really unnecessary.

You don't need to do this. If **you** think the show is outstanding, that's perfectly fine.

Despite the moaning, it's actually a pretty solid series. It's not Watanabe's best, but when your resume includes Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and Kids on the Slope, that's hardly an insult.

People disliking the 'Engrish-character' because of how she supposedly adds nothing to the show. 

Personally, I don't like her either. But I'm not hating the show for it.
>> ARTICLE
I am slightly worried about the pace at which it is tearing through the source material in order to end at the same point. So far it's done a great job at condensing the story and discarding extraneous scenes, but my worry is that when it comes down to tying all of the threads together it's a lot more difficult to find material you can cut without losing something vital, and ten chapters an episode for twelve straight episodes doesn't leave a lot of room for mistakes.
>> ARTICLE
I hate how Kayo's mother is portrayed. She seems so cartoonishly evil and does what she does for the sake of the plot only. I don't if we're going to get explanation for it, but so far it's probably the only thing to bother me in the show.
>> ARTICLE
At the same time though, Satoru's mother notices how Kayo was well dressed and had proper clothing in and recognizes that her mother at least cares for her appearance. There's some form of ~~love~~ care for her deep down there, however little it may be. I suspect there will be a reason for her behavior. 

Edit: Love is a strong word.
>> ARTICLE
You sure it's out of love? I thought it was about keeping up appearances as to not let people know of her situation.
>> ARTICLE
Love isn't the right word but it seemed like Satoru's mother was trying to say that there was a part of Kayo's mother that still cared, even though it was just a little. She wasn't completely hopeless.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. That's just cheap victimizing to me. That's not subtle at all and I want subtlety in seinen shows.

I'm kind of curious how you expect child abuse to be shown, or how you expect child abusers to look. Not saying your criticism is wrong, but I'm not sure I'd label "portraying somebody doing something which is morally repugnant as morally repugnant" as something wrong with the writing.
>> ARTICLE
It's not that they portray her as morally repugnant. That's fine. It's that they draw and shadow her like fucking Skeletor. You don't need to use lazy visual shorthand like that to show me she's evil. That's treating your viewers like idiots. We're adults. You can show us her actions, and we'll infer that she's a bad person. It detracts from the otherwise relatively subtle character focus that the show is cultivating.

If the story was told from Kayo's perspective, then I could maybe buy her seeing her own mother this way as a scared child, but the PoV character is 29. He should be above seeing people like that.
>> ARTICLE
If Kayo's mother was bland and 'cartoonishly evil', she wouldn't have the realistic insight to [Spoiler](/s "purposely keep up her daughter's appearance by hiding the bruises and avoiding Child Services")

I think people are overreacting and can't see that people CAN REALLY act like this irl. We see it from the computer/television screen, so we can't see their reasons and motives. Life is really unfair--people go off the deep end because they feel as if they don't deserve their current circumstances and find a way to put the blame onto something or someone else for momentary peace.

Just because you have or know a loving parent doesn't mean unwaveringly 'bad' or abusive parents are a concept that appear only in poorly made media.
>> ARTICLE
Ok, just because she's cartoonishly evil/bland doesn't mean she's dumb. I don't see why you would come to that conclusion.

> so we can't see their reasons and motives

Actually, we can. If we're told them. During the show. IRL, people like this do bad and shitty things like child abuse after a lifetime of fucking up. We don't know how Kayo's mom is like this, so she's just a cheap plot device. Even if they never show her backstory and why she became like this, that just poor writing. Characters like this are boring. 
>> ARTICLE
> We don't know how Kayo's mom is like this, so she's just a cheap plot device.

It's far too early to say that. Not everything is gonna be spilled in one long scene where Kayo's mom yells at her child. There's still 8 episodes left. We don't know if she was abused as a child, or if it's just due to stress, or if she just wants to be in control of somebody's life.
>> ARTICLE
I said this in my original comment. I'm waiting for the explanation, but until then it's probably the only thing I hate about the show.
>> ARTICLE
I believe they sort of explained it when they said she uses Kayo as a tool to blow off steam that has built up over the work week. The way I see it, Kayo's mom feels like life won't let her win so she abuses her daughter to show that she has power over *something* in her life. It may seem cartoonish but there are real people like that in the world and in truth, they are ridiculous human beings.
>> ARTICLE
Just because humans that are this ridiculous exist doesn't make it OK to just plop one in the story and call it a day. Those people have had their lives end up like this, they weren't born abusing everyone around them. Everything we know about Kayo's mom doesn't lead us to believe that a person like her would end up abusing her child. So until they explain how she got to the point where the only way she can let off steam is by hitting her child, she's just a cheap plot device and nothing more.
>> ARTICLE
Can't believe you are getting downvoted this much....

Fuck, people dislike the one-dimensional evil terraists in LoGH and the villains in Akame ga Kill, but it does not matter in Erased? Why?!

Lol, none of my comments except the top level one is above 0. Can't believe how much fanboyism there is in this thread. I didn't even say I hate the show, just that one character.

The story doesn't have to explain anything [Spoilers](/s "they kind of already have, like when they put the focus onto the dad not giving a shit or the mom out late with makeup as if for prostitution--the family is in shambles and the mother/father are blaming the kid ")

I think you're running around throwing 'cheap plot device' too frivolously--there are plenty of anime/manga that allude to abuse and few of them feel cheap. Abuse is spontaneous and the only reason it feels cheap is because the characters in the story figured it out a bit too fast (I'm thinking there's something fishy with either sensei or the [Spoilers](/s "red eyes that seem to control people periodically.")

Edit: Included spoiler tag for last part
>> ARTICLE
> The story doesn't have to explain anything

What? Why? So I'm supposed to just suck it up that she's just a child abuser with no explanation? What you said in the spoilers is speculation and doesn't serve as reason to why she's abusing her child. 

>the only reason it feels cheap is because the characters in the story figured it out a bit too fast

No, it feels cheap because there is no reason for her mother to abuse Kayo other than "the plot calls for it".
>> ARTICLE
I mean to say 'the story doesn't have to explain anything MORE than it already has'

If you had read between the lines, you would have deduced the family's situation
Also, if you understand where child abuse comes from (lack of confidence in yourself or your life/poor living conditions/alcoholics/mental illnesses like depression, etc.), then you'd have a much easier time convincing yourself of what the problem is

You're also looking through one 'lens'--you see Kayo being a qt3.14 and therefore villify the mother (which is the whole point of the story direction); just see to it that you can grasp what the plot is trying to fulfill, instead of isolating characters' traits and disregarding subliminal context.
>> ARTICLE
You're taking this way more deep than I ever intended with my comments.

My point is, at this point in the story, Kayo's mom doesn't have any reasons revealed to why she's abusing her child. Your reasoning is based purely on speculation. You don't know anything for certain. Sure, you could make a strong case for what you said, but after all it's just speculation that I'm sure will either be confirmed and unconfirmed by the end of the story.

I can understand what the plot is trying to fulfill. To make me hate the mother, and it's working. I hate Kayo's mom. But the way they go about it is terrible.
>> ARTICLE
My point is we can end it with 'speculation' because knowing anymore  motives to the mother would take away from the focus we have on Satoru and Kayo. The story director and even manga author probably realize that the point of the story is with Satoru and his detective shenanigans, and understanding why the mother is abusing Kayo doesn't help him find the serial kidnapper.
>> ARTICLE
This is a pointless discussion. Of course knowing why Kayo is being abused doesn't help him find out the killer. It helps flesh out the characters for the audience watching. If you don't value this then that's your problem.
>> ARTICLE
This might just not be your kind of show imo

Ah, you gotta love those visual story telling techniques in this visual medium that people end up not picking up on despite it being the point of the medium.

Visual storytelling is probably the number one reason why I'm enjoying this series; rarely do directors even consider utilizing it.

Seriously, I love subtle leaks of information and not poor exposition.
>> ARTICLE
Only watched 3 episodes. 

My problems:

Why didn't the mother lock the door? Seemd very contrived.

How did the police get there so fast? Why didn't he escape? Just to run away afterwards? 

Victimizing. Holy shit, sorry, but I hate it if one-dimensional evil adults torture little children for no appearent reason. 

Please, no pedophilia.

The time travel thing will probably never be excused. Why him? Who gave him this ability? 

I don't hate it or anything, but I have honestly some serious issues with it. 


Downvote me if you want.

>Victimizing. Holy shit, sorry, but I hate it if one-dimensional evil adults torture little children for no appearent reason. 

Except, that happens in real life literally all the time. Do you even watch the news? 
>> ARTICLE
People dislike the one-dimensional evil terraists in LoGH and the villains in Akame ga Kill, but it does not matter in Erased? Why?! 


>> ARTICLE
I meant parents abusing their kids for no reason happens in real life. 
>> ARTICLE
But there are also religious fanatics and evil criminals in real life and people still dislike these people in LoGH and AgK respectively. Why is the one-dimensional evil character in Erased an exception? Sounds like double-standards to me. 
>> ARTICLE
I acknowledge the problems you have with it and I agree with most of them (although the severity may be different for me). You say that you don't hate it and a lot of the issues you have are underlying problems or lack of explanations for some behavior. Does this stop you from enjoying it on a scene-by-scene basis? When you say that you've only watched 3 episodes, where you just stating your progress or were you implying that you've dropped it at episode 3 until further notice? As a whole (positive and negative), how do you feel about the show as it stands now?
>> ARTICLE
I can't watch the most recent episode now. It's complicated, but I did not drop it. 

Honestly, as of now, it's pretty average to me. I am not an elitist who dislikes new and popular shows just to be controversial, but I honestly think that this show is not that good.

Will it change? Hopefully, let's see.
>> ARTICLE
>Please, no pedophilia.

When you say this, I'm guessing the subtle implements of feelings Sotaru might have for Kayo? Sure, it's shown that he has a mentality of his real age, which is 29, but you can see his younger self slip in all the time. So technically, he's still a kid, I don't see it as pedophilia. Plus, he could just care for her after all this time he's gotten to spend time for her, it doesn't have to be love or anything.

>Victimizing. Holy shit, sorry, but I hate it if one-dimensional evil adults torture little children for no appearent reason. 

This is what I probably disagree with the most. Does there have to be a reason? There are literally real life parents that abuse their child for ABSOLUTELY no reason whatsoever. This mother is probably like that. I mean if you saw a similar thing in real life on the news, would you call her one-dimensional? No, you'd call her crazy, which what Kayos mother is.

>The time travel thing will probably never be excused. Why him? Who have him this ability? 

It has to be excused, I haven't read the source, but if it isn't, then that'll be really stupid. And with the kinda writing that's been shown, I doubt it'll make that mistake.
>> ARTICLE
>torcher

I too hate when adult arsonists set fire to kids.
>> ARTICLE
Corrected it.... It's getting late here. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't want to call these defenses, but these are my reasons for it and the reason why I don't see them as faults:

1. I want to think it's either a. because she had just walked in and didn't have time to do so or b. she suspected Satoru would be home soon so she just didn't bother so he could walk in.

2. This was changed from the manga which was very different here and made more sense but I will agree that this was somewhat of a mess up in the anime.

3. Satoru's mom noticed how Kayo's mother at least cared for Kayo's appearance and there was still a somewhat rational human being under the evil abusive tendencies. I suspect this will play a role later. They wouldn't just point this out for nothing.

4. I really don't think you have to think of it as a sexual attraction. You can care for someone and love someone without feeling attracted to them. Satoru blushing and getting slightly embarrassed isn't exactly enough for me to be convinced he's falling in love with her.

5. I agree that it probably won't but I don't want it to be. People continue to compare this to Steins;Gate  which isn't a bad comparison  but it's not using time travel in the plot the same way. Steins;Gate explored time travel more seriously. It tried to explain the idea, the science behind it, and made it as realistic as possible. This show is keeping the time travel phenomenon unexplained but for good reason: it is not the focus of the story. This is a mystery show, not a show about time travel and the rationalization behind it and I'd be perfectly fine and would probably like it more if it was left ambiguous.

Again, I don't want to call them defenses so much as rationalizations for why I think these flaws either are not present or could be overlooked. I can understand if this isn't sufficient for you to change your mind but I'm just putting it out there to show a different perspective.
>> ARTICLE
I totally agree on the "why he has time travel powers." 
If they spend any time on this it would feel weird and out of place with the feel of the show. He can time travel, let's please just leave it at that. 
>> ARTICLE
> Why didn't the mother lock the door? Seemd very contrived.

Wait do you lock your door the second you walk into your house? All in all it cones down to culteral differences as crime is incredibly low in Japan, AbroadinJapan said he went shopping and saw 4 cars left running outside while people were doing their weekly shop, it's just not ingrained into their train of thought. 

But even I don't lock my door when I walk in, I lock it as I leave and I lock it when I go to bed, continually locking and unlocking it seems ott to me. 

> Victimizing. Holy shit, sorry, but I hate it if one-dimensional evil adults torture little children for no appearent reason. 

There is a reason, the woman is demented, do you think there is any other reason in any of the cases of child abuse that goes on around the world. My mom was a foster carer so I've seen victims of abuse come and go in my household, and their parents didn't have some grand scheme in play or a logical reasoning to their actions, they were just fucking arseholes. 

There is probably a history to her character that explains where she went off the rails, but is it integral to the plot? No, because all that matters is what she is, unless her backstory has a connection to the murder. 

The abuse at least isn't there just because, it is used as a major part of Hinazukis narrative, with who she is and the original theory if why she died. 





>> ARTICLE
Sorry, but the protagonist was even wondering why the door was not locked....
>> ARTICLE
No he was wondering why it was wide open. Door randomly being open is weird, door being unlocked is normal. 

EDIT: Infact I think that may be a translation error, the statement "at least lock the door" doesn't make sense because lock is the most she can physically do, at least close the door would mean she could also lock it on top of that. 

I'm also sure he says  (Shimeru) which is 'to close', and he definitely doesn't say Rokku which would be 'lock' so unless he says another variation of lock then that is down to poor translation by Crunchyroll.

*Someone who speaks Japanese please confirm*
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, real adults one dimensionally torture children with no appeal to reason.

But I agree that I don't want it in my anime, unless that's something the show's trying to make commentary on, which it doesn't seem to be the case here.
>> ARTICLE
But that's still pretty unsubtle.

I honestly don't like the "there are evil people in the real world, thus writing one-dimensional assholes is ok"-argument.

One-dimensional characters that are just there so that the viewers can hate them is bad writing imo.

Unsubtle and cheap. 
>> ARTICLE
First, I'd like to say that something being subtle doesn't necessarily make it good, and something being unsubtle doesn't necessarily make it bad.

Second, I'm not sure if Kayo's mom having a reason to be abusive is relevant to the story being told. Yes, it would flesh out the character, but it might also detract from the story as a whole, by losing focus on the two primary characters, Kayo and Satoru.
>> ARTICLE
>First, I'd like to say that something being subtle doesn't necessarily make it good, and something being unsubtle doesn't necessarily make it bad.

I kindly disagree. 

To me, subtelty and thus not treating the audience as idiots, is a big factor when it comes to good and mature writing.

It's even worse in this case, since Erase is supposed to be a seinen.



>> ARTICLE
They're not there for the viewers to hate them. It's a central part of the story. I'm not seeing how you guys don't get that. She was standing in the park because she didn't want to go home. She didn't want to go home because her parents are abusive. How is that cheap? 
>> ARTICLE
Off topic, but congrats on finally gathering the courage to not say "hello" at the start of every comment!

>How did the police get there so fast? Why didn't he escape? Just to run away afterwards?

I assumed that the killer himself called the police in advance to frame Satoru. 
>> ARTICLE
Really? That's pure speculation, to be honest. I see know evidences within the story as of now. 

How did the culprit know that the protagonist would come to the right time? And please don't say that he knows what he was doing and did research and all. 




>> ARTICLE
[manga spoiler](/s "It will be revealed later (probably ep 5-6) that the culprit visited his workplace and looked at the shift schedule. So, yeah he did research.")
>> ARTICLE
I mean if you're not gonna accept the standard answer then it's just dramatic timing. The police got there immediately to get the plot moving along. It's not a real plot hole or a writing flaw, it's just something slightly unrealistic that stories do.
>> ARTICLE
>And please don't say that he knows what he was doing and did research and all.

Why not? It's clear that the killer targeted Satoru specifically. Get to know his schedule, calculate the time when he arrives home, and after that, it's all just a matter of proper timing. 
>> ARTICLE
Why shouldn't the killer know what time Satoru returns from work? He obviously has some connection to him and his mother. Also, I believe Satoru ran from the police in an effort to trigger a time leap.
>> ARTICLE
Or at the least running away until one happened. Who knows what causes them. 
>> ARTICLE
I just read that it was an adaptation error and that it was explained in the manga.

So yeah, sorry, but if that's true, then all theories mean nothing. 


>> ARTICLE
I'm told this was explained in the manga.

Later on? Or was it an adaptation error?
>> ARTICLE
Adaptation error. But again, I only heard about it. From the episode 1 discussion thread, actually. I'm sure it's still there.
>> ARTICLE
Ah ok, thanks. 

Assuming that it was fully excused in the manga, but not in the anime, then it is without a doubt a flaw. All theories are meaningless then. 
>> ARTICLE
He might have also ran from the police because he wasn't exactly a sane, logical-thinking human being at that point.

I just read that it was an adaptation error and that it was explained in the manga.

I rate the anime highly regardless

The only negative thing so far is that it's competing with Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu (and IBO) for the AOTY spot. Tho is that really a bad thing? This year seems to be starting off real strong.

More good shows is definitely not a bad thing.

The next episode isn't out yet..
>> ARTICLE
Is a bit soon to ask that, some things that don't make sense now may make sense later and vice versa, same whit the characters, this protagonist seem very easy to ruin
>> ARTICLE
The thing that I don't think will be answered is about his powers. Why does he have them, what makes him special, what's the trigger to his powers, does he have to relive his whole life (almost all), what happens if he messes up?

But the series is still young and I don't want spoilers.

I discouraged myself to not go to any discussion threads for this show until I finish it because some people are "speculating*" it.

I still like ERASED but I'm not as fan as others people on this subreddit, my pick for this season goes to Dimension W.

You did a good job of recreating the [poster](http://i.imgur.com/oNk2ksM.jpg), well done. If you'd like some criticism I think their legs look a bit *too* thin, they're definitely thinner than the original I'd say. 

Also, have you considered using thinner lines? I think that might look nice :)

Completely off-topic, but is that Airi in the bottom right?
>> ARTICLE
I think it is, yup. Not 100% sure. According to manga readers, the next episode might explain the poster a little.

It's not really possible for Airi to be there though, the child events happen 18 years in the past, whereas Airi is 17 in the modern day.

 for the legs now that you say they look thin, i noticed that they are actually thinner than the original, nice observation . and yes thinner lines would look much better but i only had that one black marker

I only picked up KonoSuba two days ago and it has quickly become my favorite this season. [This scene still makes me giggle uncontrollably.](http://i.imgur.com/F7dgSAJ.gifv) It's great having an MC that's willing to commit to harassment rather than freak out.

While it's far from perfect, [Hai to Gensou no Grimgar](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31859/Hai_to_Gensou_no_Grimgar) is an overall good and engaging series, at least to me.

Other anime I believe are great from this season:

* Ajin
* Shouwa Genroko Rakugo Shinjuu

I prefer Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu over Boku Dake. Boku Dake is good but Rakugo is much *better*. I like the characters better and the directing is really good. It's the only show that I'll be giving a 10/10 if it continues being great. A close second is Ajin. The CGI is used well and the action scenes are amazing.

I've said this in the discussion post but you know how the story in episode 1 is set in 2006 right? Wasn't that the period where Asian Kung Fu Generation was really popular with rewrite, haruka kanata etc.? What if they reached out to AKFG for the opening because they wanted something that was popular and trending then.

They could have made a new song instead of having a re-recording of their old song, so that adds to that 2006 theme. I think it's brilliant, the opening is used to take you on a nostalgia ride back to all those years ago and it sort of parallels what the MC feels, though not to a big degree.  Just my take on it.

Mikazuki was her *debut* song, aside from some videos of [her playing songs on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKUG98erR3k) there really isn't anything else. Just gotta keep an eye out on her for the future, I really like her, it's a shame there isn't much to go on yet.

[For those interested here's a raw live version of Mikazuki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKUG98erR3k)

any OP with AKG is immediately godtier
>> ARTICLE
Damn, what an awesome OP
>> ARTICLE
A lot of really good ops this season but shit this one takes the trophy

All the voice acting on this show so far has been superb and the op isn't excluded in that
>> ARTICLE
>shit this one takes the trophy

Agreed. This OP is simple (track-wise) compared to other shows this season yet gives a better punch then those OPs that try too hard to be flashy and complicated every moment they can.
>> ARTICLE
IMO, this is a top tier example of how to make a memorable OP.

* Amazing music that fits the visuals and the premise of the story.  

* Visuals that maintain that cinematic motif which goes in hand with the plot with going back in time and in a way "correcting" the past.

* It doesn't give away half the plot of the story. Most of the OP involves stuff we know about and the unknown stuff is what appears to be background spoilers instead of plot spoilers.


I'm hyped for the show. I hope it doesn't go downhill or get stale because the 2 mysteries from last season kind of plateaued for me within 6 episodes and I just dropped them out of boredom.


>> ARTICLE
>It doesn't give away half the plot of the story.

Someone mentioned in the main thread that you can actually see the supposed killer reflected in one of the shards of broken glass after the gunshot, but that could just be a filler image/scene and never come up in the show.
>> ARTICLE

Look at your own risk http://i.imgur.com/HdwfYQQ.png
>> ARTICLE
Good eye, but there can be other context, that he isn't the main killer and that doesn't give too much away let alone we always knew he was male to begin with.
>> ARTICLE
> the unknown stuff is what appears to be background spoilers instead of plot spoilers.

[Spoilers] (/s "Are you referring to the wave crashing in at 0:36?")
>> ARTICLE
I'm a manga reader but remind me if I'm forgetting something - was the thing you mentioned important?
>> ARTICLE
[Huge Spoilers] (/s "I think the wave represents chapter 31 where he's thrown in the lake inside the car")
>> ARTICLE
Ah, that makes sense. Didn't think of that. 
>> ARTICLE
Yo I haven't read the manga so I'm not going to touch that...
>> ARTICLE
Oh I thought you did, sorry then :p
>> ARTICLE
Man and then the moment when he meets up with younger self at the very beginning in a complete white scene, and then they disappear at the last scene. I just fanboyed so hard.
>> ARTICLE
As someone who hasnt seen the show, it looks like a cross between Steins;Gate and AnoHana. 

Is it good? 
>> ARTICLE
as someone who read the manga, you will like this a [lot ](/s this have the AnoHana Fells + S;G mind fuck)

*fixed
>> ARTICLE
I think you missed your quotes
>> ARTICLE
Narration definitely feels like S;G.
>> ARTICLE
I guess if you took some very minor plot points from each of those shows you could say that, but so far I'm really enjoying this show. I expect it to turn out pretty great later on
>> ARTICLE
Ill watch it then. Thanks
>> ARTICLE
Best 2 first episodes of the season thus far. You wont regret it.
>> ARTICLE
After seeing alot of ["What's in an OP?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQwx6kR-T8&list=PLiA-wx1wjaKpFbymrAHhdgzqmWADswVyC), I can tell there is a lot that this show has to offer, judging from the OP. I could go and write out an essay of theories based from this OP alone, but manga readers would probably ruin the fun :P

Best OP of the year so far. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, depends on what you mean by ruin. I read the manga, and the opening hints at a lot of stuff. So you'd not be wrong to theorize based off of it. Like, once some stuff starts happening, you'll like at the OP and it'll all click together.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't mean ruin in the wrong way. Since there is an answer to the theories I'm crafting (manga), it isn't much theorizing if I were to post it here. Kinda hard to explain, I kinda notice through reddit I suck at conversing my thoughts. On second thought I'd rather keep theorizing alone and see if it all turns out how I thought it would.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough. I haven't watched the anime. I tend to like books/manga more than their adaptations. So, if it makes you theorize and excited, then good. I suggest checking out the Manga eventually. I have feeling I know where the season is gonna end for the anime, which means it is gonna catch up to the manga pretty quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Hearing AKG again makes me rather nostalgic for all the amazing OPs they did in the mid 2000s. 
>> ARTICLE
would have liked them to maybe use a new song though.
>> ARTICLE
Like /u/petrichorE6 said though, I think them using an old song was kind of the point.
>> ARTICLE
Yea i saw that afterwards. If thats the reason, then thats awesome on their part
>> ARTICLE
yeah its a pretty nice touch!
>> ARTICLE
Awesome details in the opening, if you look frame by frame at the shards of the MC glasses when the bullet hits [Spoilers](/s "You can see the killer.")
>> ARTICLE
1.) Put the song on repeat

2.) There is no step two

>> ARTICLE
I knew Re:re: would make it into an opening one day :')
>> ARTICLE
fav op this season.

but ive been listening to AFKG for years so i'm biased lol
>> ARTICLE
As someone who would listen to this song years ago, hearing it now as an OP makes me feel like I'm going back in time myself. 
>> ARTICLE
I really loved all of the subtle stuff in this OP.  Especially the blacking out of the eyes of the supporting characters since the only thing we really know about the killer is that they have red eyes.  And the bit on the roof where the MC gets shot at and you see the reflection of the killer briefly in the shards of his broken glasses.  I'm just really pumped for this show and this just made me even more excited for whats to come from it.
>> ARTICLE
pizza-chan is my new waifu

>> ARTICLE
I had no idea this had already started. I'll let it get a few more episodes in before I start.
>> ARTICLE
When the episode started I was like "oh shit Nigga"

Been listening to this song a bit on my Weeb Pandora station 
>> ARTICLE
haha I'm so glad I'm not the only person who ever listened to AKFG on pandora.
>> ARTICLE
That's also how I discovered them, and pretty much most jpop groups.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I learned about them through Pandora at first but I learned about toher Jpop groups through soundcloud.
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit I love this opening. I can't stop listening to it. AKFG is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
not sure if anybody is interested but here is the link to the full version :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqldayv8Cgw
>> ARTICLE
Really good, but nothing beats [Dimension W](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31163/Dimension_W)'s [op](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMUi6x2d4Y) & [ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmAZIlL9ElQ).

[Damn that first episode **was good.**](#gintamathispleasesme)



>> ARTICLE
Then you realize western watchers and r/anime is very biased towards songs with english lyrics and dubstep. Look at LoH, Noragami, Kill La Kill, Death Parade, Guilty Crown, etc. Unsurprisingly, Dimension W's op has both english lyrics and dubstep making it the favorite OP of the season for r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
Lyrics and the music choice had nothing to do with my choice, don't know about the rest of /r/anime. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think lyrics really have anything to do with it... Just cause an english word gets thrown in here and there doesn't really affect it. I would say its more about the instrumental part of the track and the singers voice more than anything else. Half of us can't understand the lyrics anyway so lyrics don't really matter imo. The reason Dimension W's op is loved so much is because of those sweet ass dance moves.
>> ARTICLE
I'm just saying that it's a trend that I've noticed. Openings with english lyrics, metal/rock, or dubstep is generally regarded as "best of the season" openings by r/anime and westerners. I remember some polls that show the popularity of openings from r/anime and japan communities and noticed that they are vastly different. The main difference was that japan polls didn't even have these highly regarded r/anime openings anywhere near as high. While r/anime still had highly rated openings in Japan still relevant on their polls.

The only conclusion I can come up with is that r/anime is biased when it comes with the genres of openings they enjoy. Examples would be LoH, Noragami, Kill La Kill, Death Parade, Guilty Crown, Dimension W, Deadman wonderland, Mirrai Nikki, Watamote, Overlord, Parasyte, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I understand where your coming from, and there seems to be some truth to it. I personally don't ever look into the whole "best of the season" stuff though.
>> ARTICLE
I still prefer this one.
>> ARTICLE
naruto?
>> ARTICLE
The singing starts at 1:40 lol
>> ARTICLE
Jesus, it takes forever for it to get going.
>> ARTICLE
Nice attention span u got there m80
>> ARTICLE
But it's such a sexy guitar part.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly the best thing about the song is the intro
>> ARTICLE
Actually after hearing a few times, it really is. I kinda prefer the old 2004 version.
>> ARTICLE
> the old 2004 version.

?
>> ARTICLE
A bit late but here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11NEu8aD5Fg

The old version.
>> ARTICLE
Ah! I didn't know that this song was old. Both versions sound great.
>> ARTICLE
Personally it's head cannon that they chose an old song from back when AKFG were at their peak popularity since the show starts in 2006. So it's like a nostalgia trip, just like how satoru has his revivals, we get to jump back to that era when we listen to the opening. Good shit
>> ARTICLE
Tbf, most old songs have very long intros
>> ARTICLE
If you watch them perform it live its pretty awesome! The build up gets the crowd hyped up and starts chanting! pretty awesome to see [Watch it live!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRMlJYDBOAM)
>> ARTICLE
Damn I want to see them live 
>> ARTICLE
the singer almost looks like the old satoru too
>> ARTICLE
This is a studio recording of their live rendition of the song (albeit at a slightly slower tempo), which has the long intro as a sort of hype builder I guess
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it sounds really close to the version from one of the live albums.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvSmFhN8auE
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I personally prefer the live tempo but I still think it's cool that they rerecorded it for the show

edit: though this particular live version sounds faster than the one I usually listen to. As a drummer I can just imagine the guitarist hating their drummer for rushing it haha
>> ARTICLE
Is this the 2016 version that was supposed to release soon? Or just the 2004 version?

It's because Youtube red in the US. It blocks like 80% of anything anime and japan. RIP I can't listen to the akira album anymore I miss hearing testuo 
>> ARTICLE
Before I watched Erased I listened to Asian Kung-Fu Generation on Pandora and this was one of my favorite songs by them. It's  awesome that they remastered this song for Erased and that its getting the recognition it deserves. I would recommend checking out the rest of their music if you haven't already!
>> ARTICLE
I know this version was supposed to be enhanced or whatever, but I love the 2004 version a lot more than this... still pretty good tho!

>> ARTICLE
I think I like this one better but I'd have to listen to both again
>> ARTICLE
Yea in the old one his voice sounds younger, it just makes me happier. The new one sounds more serious which I guess fits the anime more. 
>> ARTICLE
> in the old one his voice sounds younger

I'm pretty sure people sounded younger around 10 years ago
>> ARTICLE
looool GOT EM

But in all seriousness I like his current voice more than his younger voice. It has this smoothness to it. And definitely like the new background music more.

Yeah the old version is much better, except for the singing. The singing is pretty awful compared to the newer version.

Yeah that's what I think too.

I've heard it. I actually really like the deeper voice of the TV ver. though. Oh, to have the best of both worlds.

I have pretty high hopes, judging off of what's happened so far I can infer that [Episode 5 spoilers](/s "Satoru will discover Airi dead and have another revival back to 1988. It seems like his major revivals are triggered by extreme emotional distress.")

He didn't feel anything emotional when tying to save the driver. Again, I think there's some higher order that sets these things up.

This is pretty quality OP. Did you use a mechanical pencil, and maybe copics?

Thanks, just a normal number 2 pencil.

It seems like you copy and pasted from the source but that's how you get better. Overall very well done.

BTW it's total potato quality, I don't care what anyone else here says, but the potato quality came out perfectly so it's somehow really good. The potatoness of it caused an array of colors that made it superb, really shows the gradual emotion of the picture from the original scene. Unless that was done with color pencil, in which case you should be a pro.
>> ARTICLE
>It seems like you copy and pasted from the source but that's how you get better. Overall very well done.

It's what I did, I certainly can't draw something like this just by myself, but I like to think that I'm getting better at that too.
For now I think that my best drawings are the ones that I copy because I'm founding difficult to develop a style of my own.
Lastly, the sky was covered when I took the picture (had to go autside for good lighting) so the light was pretty uniform, maybe that's the reason. Combined with that Nokia cameras were pretty good in their times.

Edit: Multiple typos and added quote.
>> ARTICLE
Once again, it's pinkish in the middle and blue and green on the outside of it, making a really emotional driving piece(outside of just the smile), lighting and your nokia worked in your favor this time.

Yeah, it's pretty bad generally :P

If that's potato quality, I am eating the wrong potatoes.  
  
This looks amazing, OP!!
>> ARTICLE
Where's a good place to start when drawing faces? The hair? Eyes? I always feel so lost.
>> ARTICLE
I struggle with this too. I find that starting from the eyes or mouth gives me enough references to draw the rest. Defining the shape of the head first as u/Dekoe said is a good start too, but I find it difficult to do sometimes and just start from somewhere else. I started from the mouth in this case.
>> ARTICLE
shape of the head first > laying out general guidelines for the face(setting angle and where eyes are placed) > drawing the eyes plus face and then hair last

looks just like the anime gj man

100% Accurate
>> ARTICLE
It's true, Hiromi being a girl makes zero sense in context. The fact that he's in their group, plays Final Fantasy, and asked Satoru to walk home together are giveaways. A girl and boy walking home together would be scandalous, as we've already seen. 
>> ARTICLE
Wah? I did all that when I was younger because I was 'one of the boys', but then again this is a anime. They seem to think having a girl would be too lewd.
>> ARTICLE
I thought he played dragon quest?

or was that shinpachi.

Wtf this is a bit of a mindfuck. I was sure they were a girl.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I assumed at first but then I thought they might have known each other for a long time.

oh shit, didn't even realize it was him for that "walk home" scene.

I was super confused thinking "who is this girl asking to walk home together?"
>> ARTICLE
lol, anime must be so confusing for you. I think this is one of the few shows for me where each character looks and sounds a distinct way.
>> ARTICLE
It might be because he's had such a tiny role (read as barely not a background character).

> plays Final Fantasy

Don't think this one belongs in the list.

Walking together is way too lewd for that age, the anime would surely be banned.

I noticed that too, it's weird how Satoru doesn't address this
>> ARTICLE
The manga goes into it but I'm guessing they don't in the anime because of episode constraints. There have been some notable differences
>> ARTICLE
Is the manga better?
>> ARTICLE
The manga is at 42 monthly chapters right now, meaning they are trying to do 3.5 chapters per episode, which is a bit crazy. The first episode alone covered the first 6 chapters. They're at least cutting out 1/3 of the stuff out, it's almost Tokyo ghoul level of cutting content. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not against cutting content so long as the story remains coherent (which this show is so far). It just gives you that much more reason to pick up the source material.
>> ARTICLE
i read the first 8 chapters and i must say i prefer the anime version. I think the story flows much better and the directing Vas and sound makes for a much better experience than the manga. Even tho the manga has more details in specific things
>> ARTICLE
Both have been great. The anime has great art quality and the voice actors are good. I also like some of the artistic choices/direction that the studio are doing. For example, Hinazuki's jacket was highlighted/especially colorful in a scene and the anime added the little butterfly to better show the effect. The manga most likely goes deeper into the story line and might have more characters/development.

They probably haven't gotten to that point yet.

I think the bigger point of interesting trivia for me is that the mangaka of this show happens to be one of my favorite hentai doujinshi artists. His works usually being based on playful and sexy exhibitionism. NSFW obviously, but you can Google Hitomi's Great Adventure for a great example. That story being a terrific mix of adventure, eroticism and the naughty fun of exhibitionism with a lot of interesting angles and situations. 

I love how he is such a master of dramatic storytelling as well as the most sexually expressive and fun hentai.

I actually do own several of his hentai doujinshi. It's  so cool to me that he is both a prolific manga and erotica creator. He has almost 100 hentai doujinshi works already.
>> ARTICLE
Oh shit he made Great Adventure? That was one of my first favorites before I settled into my niche. Sadly doesn't do much for me anymore. 
>> ARTICLE
I like his content because not only is it sexy, but plain old fun and cute too. He just does a lot of different stuff even in his hentai. I guess his style fits an omnivore viewer/reader like me.
>> ARTICLE
Just like the Ajin artist
>> ARTICLE
...*Bullshit.*

EDIT: [Holy shit it's true.](http://myanimelist.net/people/21989/Gamon_Sakurai)

I don't know what's true anymore. :    : 
>> ARTICLE
Then, it's almost the same case like Ajin's mangaka, right? I really love knowing this information. 
>> ARTICLE
ROFL. That one came out of left field. I'm actually proud that this is so naturally brought up. 


>> ARTICLE
whats his hentai penname? I need to check it out. I dig the way he draws the adult females...
well, adult female.
>> ARTICLE
He has like 4 different pen names. Kawara Keisuke and No-No's (a duo of creators in which he is one) are a few of the pennames. Too bad a huge chunk of his works aren't scanned/translated though. Many are still available in Japanese stores only.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of mangakas start out with doujins though, it's a great way to learn how to draw bodies.
>> ARTICLE
I actually adore erotica artists so it is a plus in my book. Yes you can tell his art jumps in quality with his doujins. He is still fairly active with drawing erotica, just not as much as the early 2000s. But he really keeps experimenting with both erotica and mainstream manga. I am so proud of his works becoming a major anime hit. It truly is a cinderella story.

Side note: highly recommend reading the manga. There's 35 chapters out. It's fantastic. It only made me more excited to see it fully animated, I'm very glad I read it.

My only sadness right now is over whether this is going to be a 12-episode animation. It should get two seasons.

It's going to end with the same ending as the manga apparently. The story is just going to end up being a bit more condensed as you can tell by focusing solely on hinadzuki

What does the title actually translate to?
>> ARTICLE
"The Town Without Me" or "The Town Where Only I am Missing". It was the title of Kayo's story in episode 2, though she used 'watashi' instead of 'boku.'
>> ARTICLE
Why are there different versions of "I/me" in Japanese?
>> ARTICLE
Different levels of formality, different male and female forms. There's also 'ore.' I believe 'boku' is primarily used by men.
>> ARTICLE
watashi = primarily used by females, but can be used by anyone. default "I" pronoun.

atashi = less formal form of watashi, pretty much only used by females since it apparently sounds "cute".

boku = male counterpart of watashi but pretty much never used by females.

ore = less formal/polite way to reference oneself, pretty much only used by males.

those are the main ones but there's some more "obscure" pronouns like ware/uchi.

[this](http://nihonshock.com/2009/11/the-many-ways-to-say-i/) site explains it better than i do.
>> ARTICLE
It's slightly more nuanced than the way you or the site put it, I think. In formal situations, everyone is to use  (watashi), and it has no particular gendered nuance either way. 

In casual situations (i.e. with friends), using watashi has a definite feminine nuance, which is why a lot of foreigners - who have been trained to only use watashi - sound a little feminine.  (atashi) is very feminine to the extent that it's only used by some girls (but does come across as very cute).

For males,  (boku) is considered a softer, more urbane, even boyish pronoun for informal and only-slightly-formal situations (I've heard it used when people are addressing their senpai, for example). It's important to note that although women in songs and anime will refer to themself as boku, it would be considered very strange and inelegant in real life (this is one of the traps people fall into when they learn from anime).  (ore) is much rougher and is pretty much used exclusively by males with friends. 

This is all from my experience in Japan, but it could be slightly coloured by the fact that I live in Kansai as opposed to Tokyo (there are some differences in pronoun usage).
>> ARTICLE
Well, I assumed it was a girl not only because of the looking and sounding like a girl part, but also cuz of the whole being one of the abducted and murdered (presumably from that newspaper clipping) kids and those kind of spree killings tend to have a pattern with victims, ya know? 

Maybe the killer fell for the trap as well lol.

>> ARTICLE
Wait, so he's not one of the 3 that got kidnapped? And if not, why isn't Satoru trying to help them aswell, instead of just Kayo?
>> ARTICLE
He is one of the 3. Satoru is trying to prevent first kidnapping because he knows approximately when it happened. He doesn't know many details about other two kidnappings. 
>> ARTICLE
He is probably trying to prevent it altogether, and henie using the fact that he knows how and when Kayo is going to be kidnapped to "map" it in a waybhe can interfere. He is also trying to save his friend from prison and his mother in the future, so, in my book, he is totally doing fine being selfish and all.

Makes sense.

I thought it was obvious he was a guy... odd I guess. You can 100% tell it was a group of male friends, especially with how they treated that girl they thought he was into.

No, it is actually a guy, but it's also a joke.

It's probably taken me so long to understand because I just can't believe that they'd draw and voice a boy as feminine as they have. 
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, they are 11. Most boys don't really sound too manly at that age.
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually a bit worried about the show not talking about him. 

He's pretty important to the plot. Wonder how they're going to handle it now.
>> ARTICLE
He wasn't talked about at that point in manga either.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoiler](/s "Not even once mentioning that he's actually a guy is a mistake, considering that his androgeny will be fairly important when the connection between the murders is going to be made. Also, in the manga, Satoru has his guilt complex mainly because he couldn't save Hotaru, not Hinadzuki. Shown around chapter 4, page 29-30.  ")

The font used in the first Kanji "Boku"() is called [MS Mincho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_(typefaces) and the last Kanji "Machi"() is called [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_gothic_typeface). And the rest of Hiragana in between look like they are transitioning from MS Mincho to Gothic little by little.

They are two of the most common font used in Japan but I think MS Mincho is used more in printed works. On the other hand, Gothic is more for digital display or for browsing.

So maybe the title is trying to show the passing of time from 1988 to 2006, from the time when almost everything was printed to the time when almost everything is digitized. Or it is just trying to give out some vibe of strangeness. I don't know...

By the way translation for the first kanji  (boku) is "I" (commonly used by male) and the last letter  (machi) is "town." The direct translation would be "The town where I'm the only one missing." So if you understand what it's saying, the font change makes a lot more sense.
>> ARTICLE
I may be wrong here, cause I don't know anything about japanese Kanji, but maybe they are playing some sort of innuendo to the difference between 1988s form of writing & the 2006 / present one. 

May be totally wrong about this tho and there isn't any difference in the prefered style based on the timeperiod.
>> ARTICLE
sounds plausible.. but then the change shouldn't be in the middle of the word (). It's like you'd change the font of "ot" in "not".
>> ARTICLE
This sounds plausible.
>> ARTICLE
The varied line form is somewhat more old fashion and the uniform is more modern. It's a similar effect to serifs in the Latin alphabet font system. 

Ie. The varied font is likened to say 'Times New Roman' and the uniform is more akin to 'Arial' or 'Helvectia' (The Apple packaging and marketing font). However it's an abrupt place to change, if you refer to my other reply in the thread. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm not buying the theory, since it's just an awkward place to change.

I was already annoyed for it being translated as "Erased", and now this. This is gonna bug me way more than it should...
>> ARTICLE
well I guess they choosed "Erased" because for a western market it's easier to remember than a japanese sentence.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but they should've translated it to "The town where only I am missing/do not exist", a simple but slightly mysterious English sentence that's easy to remember. "Erased" is just lazy and loses the direct reference to the event in the show.
>> ARTICLE
yea the literal translation would have been better. But whole sentences are just not usual in the west. So I guess they wanted just a better "marketing name"
>> ARTICLE
Even so, they could have put 5 minutes of thought into it. I would go with something like "The Empty Town" or "My Lonely Town" to make it 'western'.
>> ARTICLE
When I read your..

>easier to remember than a japanese sentence

..comment it reminded me of sentence long titles that get contractions, like Oregairu, Watamote, and Soremachi (the latter in particular because "machi"). Those got sentence long English titles too. I bet Boku dake ga Inai Machi could have gone that route too.
>> ARTICLE
that's true. But that's what I meant. That they didn't want to do that and favour the "easier way"...

Well I guess we'll never know. The most important thing is that the series will deliver.
>> ARTICLE
What the actual title translates to is so much more interesting, "The Town Where Only I am Missing". The title of Kayo's essay.
>> ARTICLE
Your translation isn't really correct actually. The real translation is more like "The Town Where Only I Am Present". The grammar is a bit confusing but the () part means "everyone but that person is not there" so it becomes "just that person is there". When I read the title the first time I had to think for some time too.
>> ARTICLE
No, you're not right on that one unfortunately. I'll try to explain it.  

Boku dake ga inai machi

Let's focus on "ga" first, since it defines the subject for the sentence. In this case that is "Boku", since "dake" is a particle that basically means "only". You could lump the two together and say that the subject is "Only I", which means that the sentence refers to "Only I". 

Inai is the negative form of iru - to be/to exist. The verb acts on the subject, which in this case is "Boku". "Boku ga inai" - I am not there, or in this case "Boku *dake* ga inai", "Only I am not there".  

This sentence is whole, but in this case it is used to modify the second subject of the sentence, "machi". This is a common thing to do when describing something in japanese, for example "" - a smart person. In this case the description is pretty long, but you can think of it like this:

(Boku dake ga inai)(Machi)   
(Only I am not there)(Town)   

You can choose several ways to translate this in a way that makes sense in English.  
"A town where only I am missing", "A town without (only) me", "A town where only I don't exist", etc. But it definitely does not mean "The town where only I am present". 

Similarly the sentence you chose as an example ""  means "only that person is not (there/here)". Here's another example:
 "The only one not here is Takeshi, right?" 

"A city where only I am present" would be "****
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you are right. I looked it up again and got confused because I treated "dake" like "shika". I learned both of these expressions at the same time which probably wasn't sich a good idea. Thanks though for your time explaining.
>> ARTICLE
Yep, "dake" and "shika" can be pretty easy to confuse! Luckily I learned "dake" first, so I haven't really been messing them up.  
There is some vocabulary and grammar that is best learned *not* in pairs. I still struggle with  and ..
>> ARTICLE
It's a parallel to the MC, since he's in a revival. His old self is the only one missing in that town.
>> ARTICLE
Yup. I don't understand why they decided to butcher the perfect title so horribly...
>> ARTICLE
http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-12-18/.96648
>> ARTICLE
Far as I know, "Erased" is something the licensors/translators in the west came up with, rather than something the original author did. So it's just a bad attempt at localizing or something, rather than going with an already established name for it.
>> ARTICLE
Because Japan.
>> ARTICLE
What's really interesting is the different words for "I" that was used in the titles.  
"Boku dake ga inai machi" for the show, and "Watashi dake ga inai machi" for Kayo's essay.  
In other words the "I" referred to in the title is most likely the MC (Boku tends to be male), and not Kayo. It might seem obvious, but it's a nice little difference between the two that the sub really fails to mention. Maybe it will be important later? Even if not I find it kind of neat as someone learning the language. 

Edit: MC says "ore" though, so I don't really know who "boku" is in this case then. 
>> ARTICLE
I didn't really pay attention, but hasn't Satoru been referring to himself with 'ore'?
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I went back to the latest episode and you're right, both young and old Satoru is referring to himself as "ore".  
I wonder why the title isn't "Watashi dake ga inai machi" then, after Kayo's essay, or "Ore dake ga inai machi"? 
>> ARTICLE
I would guess that either

a) The title actually refers to the perspective of a third character, other than Satoru or Kayo

b) The title's been genericized to refer to nobody in particular

c) There's some nuance of the Japanese language and/or business insight that makes 'boku' work better than 'ore'.
>> ARTICLE
> c) There's some nuance of the Japanese language and/or business insight that makes 'boku' work better than 'ore'.

This is the correct answer. "Boku" has a younger, less prideful connotation. Kids and teenagers usually use "Boku", and adults and young adults usually use "Ore". The title is referring to Satoru, but young Satoru specifically.

EDIT: upon thinking about it a little more, by traveling back in time with his 29 year old mind, he *is* essentially erasing his childhood from history forever, turning the city into one that never knew the Satoru who referred to himself as "boku"
>> ARTICLE
maybe he will die lol
>> ARTICLE
a) I was thinking about that, too. I'll be looking out for characters that refer to themselves as "boku"...  So far all the kids around Satoru have called themselves "ore". "Boku" can also be used by an adult to refer to a child, but then it seems to be written in hiragana, and in the title it is written in kanji.  

b) But in that case, "watashi" is still more generalised than "boku", which is used mostly by boys or tomboyish girls. It could be they wanted to change it slightly just to indicate that the title isn't supposed to only refer to Kayo's essay? Since first impressions matter, having "boku" in there might also tell the potential reader/watcher that the main character is a young male, even though that's not how he refers to himself. 


c) "Boku" is a bit more formal/polite than "ore", so that could be it. It might also just be that "boku dake ga inai machi" flows better than "ore dake ga inai machi". There are probably also a hundred different associations Japanese people have with that word that I don't know about. 

tl;dr: \\\_()_/ idk

Cannot unsee! It looks like Satoru is annoyed by it too :P

It's the same as the manga, it's probably intentional.

I reckon too, it wouldn't go unnoticed. But I just wonder why. Maybe the original author did it, and for marketing they just kept it as such.
>> ARTICLE
What a strange and harmless comment to downvote. 
>> ARTICLE
Obviously not an accident. Wouldn't you say that the bottom half looks more childish?
>> ARTICLE
That would be a fantastic explanation. But the font change from variation in line to uniform script is half way through the word 'inai' which begins at the start of the bottom row, but the font change happens a syllable in. To demonstrate this, the varied font will be in italics and the uniform in bold. 

*Boku dake ga*

*i* **nai Machi**
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps they are attempting to emphasize the negative conjugation?
>> ARTICLE
This is a good point. Almost like, when he is young, he disappears from that city? 
>> ARTICLE
It's definitely on purpose.  OP missed it, but on the top row, the last character 'ga' has the font transition halfway too, with half the character being rounded and childlike.  

For non-japanese readers trying to follow along, if we pretend each word was a set of two letters representing the left and right halves of each character, with 'A' being the first 'adult' font, and 'B' being the second 'child' font, the title would look like this:

AA-AA-AA-**B**A -> last word 'ga' in both fonts

**B**A-**BB**-**BB**-**BB** -> first word 'inai' in both fonts

Since there's no way to normally change fonts halfway within a character when typing,  and they could've easily left it as "adult-font top, child-font bottom", I think it was going for a Yin-Yang effect, with a tiny bit of child-font in the adult-style upper row, and a single tapered adult stroke in the bottom child-like lower row.  (In the Yin-Yang Symbol, the black dot in the white half and the white dot in the black half symbolize how even two opposites contain aspects of the other.)

Thematically, it ties in with the story: [](/s "Adult MC has a bit of childhood trauma inside him, and when he turns to a child, he's carrying his adulthood guilt and regrets.")
>> ARTICLE
I'm tempted to believe this actually. The 'ga' main body looks like a vectorised version of the typically Google hiragana font on mobile, but the extra stroke and ten ten look like the cursive script font. Also, the first stroke in the 'i' looks like the uniform, and the second one the varied... Good pick up. 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe there's some hidden meaning to this that relates to the plot

Edit: and wtf now that i take a closer look at the picture i never saw the other girl on the bottom right corner

Could be intentional

Here's a [my.mixtape.moe mirror](https://my.mixtape.moe/omufxn.webm) in case the puu.sh link dies. In case it was not obvious, new OP on top, old OP at the bottom. I stacked it in ffmpeg for personal use but decided that maybe it's something other people would like to see. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why, but upsets me. I mean, I love it a lot.. but this OP just makes me tear up. It's so simple, such a dumb thing to tear up over. But I can't help but feel so god damn upset when I see that. 

This show has been fucking fantastic in ways I can't describe too well. 

Also, now I'm paranoid and won't be skipping OPs for a while.... again...
>> ARTICLE
Listing out all the difference here:

- Obvious lack of Satoru in all the scenes, both child and adult version

- Striked out black bars over characters' eyes removed 

- Strings attached to Airi, Kayo and Sachiko's head.

- For some reason, footsteps are still there where child Satoru would have walked on.

It is a perfect OP for the last 2 episodes of "The Town Without Me". It is really a town without Satoru.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting enough, though they removed Satoru from the opening almost completely, one aspect of him still remains. As we remember from his talks with Airi, he imagined himself as a grim reaper, trying to save a life that was mistakenly taken. The grim reaper imagery remains in the opening. This could mean that despite the [](/s "memory loss") Satoru still knew that he had to correct something that was wrong, that he still had lives to save. 

Alternatively we can also interpret that the grim reaper is actually representative of his powers and that he still has his ability, perhaps he is almost literally a grim reaper. He could also have the power as a result of an actual grim reaper using Satoru as an avatar to affect the real world.

Our final thing that we can conclude is that I'm probably looking way too much into a short (around .25-.5 second) clip in the OP.

When I was watching the episode I thought the screen freezed because its stuck with the start of the op and I was like oh Satoru is not in the OP that's clever.

Then so I think in the next episode Satoru will run away from the teacher because he had a gun as showed in the op Satoru is in the rooftop running away from something and fell. well I think well i guess it was obvious

At 1:06 Satoru's footprint that shows up in the original OP is not visible in the Episode 11 OP, but at 1:09 when it cuts to the blizzard scene again the footprints were there again in the Episode 11 OP. That's an error, right?

I'd like to think of that as the moment he disappeared, or more specifically how his actions changed the future to become to unknown.  Note the footprints can be taken as Satoru retracing his steps in the past, and the snow as uncharted territory.

Wow, this is beautiful! Do you have a 1440x2560 version? Would love to use this as my phone wallpaper.

Also, send me a store link if you ever put this up on Redbubble or whatever, I'd probably buy a print.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! Unfortunately I don't feel comfortable putting such a high res version of the poster online since it makes it almost **too** easy for others to steal and sell lol. In fact someone has already done this with the version i posted and put it on their own Redbubble :/. Hope you understand! I did put up a [1920x1080](http://i.imgur.com/w8oaGJp.png) version and a [smaller phone wallpaper](http://i.imgur.com/mDq2WlN.png) though, if that helps at all. And I will for sure remember to send you a link. Thanks again!

Looks great. Thanks! I love the whole film motif in the show. You have the theater in the OP, the Revival being represented by a sphere made out of film stock and the fact that when he's in the past, the aspect ratio changes.

(I'm sorry, I binged the 5 episodes last night and I'm excited)
>> ARTICLE
I know! I am excited too, so don't worry. This anime is amazing so far and it just keeps getting better each episode. I hope they can keep this quality up.

The film theme is well thought out and original. I love everything about it :)

Edit: and the letterboxing effect gives it a really cool cinematic feel!
>> ARTICLE
Yes, letterboxing that was the term I was looking for. Yeah I really hope the quality stays up as well. It's been a while since I've finished an anime 
>> ARTICLE
This looks great man! Nice work

Thanks :)

No surprise for Erased, those cliffhangers leave you wanting more each week.  
  
[Nice to see KonoSuba](http://i.imgur.com/pPA6rRX.png) at #5, it a really fun show, with a great cast of characters.

I'm just glad that KyoAni's pile of steaming mediocrity is not in the overall top 5 (Except the "men's choice" sadly). While Konosuba is high up as it easily deserves to be!
>> ARTICLE
KyoAni fanboys on a downvote spree. Here, have an upvote.
>> ARTICLE
Meh I don't mind. If they feel like calling out KyoAni on their mediocrity is not adding to the conversation, they can downvote me as much as they want.

I couldn't wait for erased so I just jumped the gun and read the manga, now I have to wait a month instead Q_Q

Same boat lol, worth though

Sweet, I love that show

Here's hoping for that too. 10 episodes of Megumin isn't enough!

>> ARTICLE
Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu didn't make it into top 5/top 10.

Well at least top 20 I guess :(
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't have moe so the otakus won't watch it, shame...
>> ARTICLE
It's a niche show, shouldn't be surprising at all
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't really have a wide, mainstream appeal.  I know for me personally, I was sort of enjoying it, but after the 3d fuckin' episode filled with 15 minutes straight of a Rakugo act, I bounced.  It's going to be too dull for a lot of viewers.  Episode 3 gave me hope, then 4 just destroyed that hope of being interesting to me.

Had they stuck more to the characters stories and not just their acts, I imagine it would have done better.
>> ARTICLE
I was a bit surprised by that too. I would have thought more Japanese people would like it since the jokes would be easier to understand for them.
>> ARTICLE
The lack of moe or explosions doesn't help it.
>> ARTICLE
Rakugo is archaic even for the average Japanese though. People have general respect for it, but its sense of humor is very oldschool, other than a few Rakugo masters trying to modernize it (some even doing so in English)

>> ARTICLE
It's great seeing Konosuba in top 5.

Also, surprised to see Active Raid on #15, over Grimgar and Haruchika, and Sekkou boys! Guess mechs playing poker is just that cool.
>> ARTICLE
Did you just say mechs playing poker? Please, go on...
>> ARTICLE
[Just a dude in mech suit and a bowtie playing poker...](https://36.media.tumblr.com/2ad01fb4fea2b5d5e2ebcbfc1a8aa3d6/tumblr_o227dtABq71qfxg40o7_1280.jpg) He literally had no reason to put on a mech suit, but he just did. Just because Active Raid is that fun. 
>> ARTICLE
Active Raid is just too fun. Reminds me so much of early 2000s special task force anime. They are always fun to relax with. The CGI is a tad wonky and all, but the characters are so fun.
>> ARTICLE
That's all it is. Active Raid is just really fucking fun. It knows what it is and it knows how to entertain and introduce new stuff with each episode. It's the kind of show that manages to not take itself seriously, while at the same it doesn't go "meta", "self-aware" and doesn't break a 4th wall. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad about Konosuba as well. I was worried it would meet the same fate as Baccano or Rokka no Yuusha, but now I'm pretty optimistic about season 2.
>> ARTICLE
Ajin at 6 is great, enjoying it a lot 
>> ARTICLE
Sekko Boys is in the top 20? 0_0

Does that mean we have a chance of a second season?
>> ARTICLE
japan likes durarara!!! proof of good taste
>> ARTICLE
Durarara is definitely more popular with the female audience and along with not having to read subs seems pretty accurate that it's popular. Durarara has just had so many seasons along with being heavy dialogue based show it makes sense that a lot of people on this sub have a harder time following along with the story and slowly get detached. 
>> ARTICLE
I see. Quite sad to hear tbh
>> ARTICLE
Japan is rating KyoAni's mediocre show mediocrely and not giving it too much of a "KyoAni free pass". Proof of good taste.
>> ARTICLE
I feel sad about HaruChika. I quite like this show.
>> ARTICLE
I think it probably could have looked a bit prettier. Because while it looks fine in motion, it doesn't  have that eyecandy factor many hit PA Works anime have
>> ARTICLE
The colors... is just weird. Having following PA Works for quite a time, it felt somewhat similar but not exactly like the usual PA Works colors. There's just too much violets for some reason and very crayon-ish.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's pretty enough but yeah it could have been better.  
>> ARTICLE
Same. I think people simply didn't know what to expect from the show, and I can see why. It's kinda mystery, kinda SoL, kinda music, maybe romance... but I still like it very much and Chika is one of the best protagonists of this season. 
>> ARTICLE
I guess people wanted it to be another Hyouka or Hibike. [Chika is definitely the highlight of this show for me since I find her incredibly fun to watch](https://my.mixtape.moe/wgjopd.webm) 


>> ARTICLE
I always thought it was going to be a blend of the two. I didn't realize there was supposed to be mystery until it actually aired. Chika just reminds me of Chitanda.

That said the show didn't bore me like it did some others. There's just a great deal more I'm watching this season that takes away from watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Chika doesn't remind me of Chitanda at all 
>> ARTICLE
To me her design looks like Chitanda.
>> ARTICLE
Well, matter of different perspective I guess. She doesn't look like Chitanda to me either.
>> ARTICLE
It's possible that we could see a pick-up in sales. The last 2 episodes (4 and 5) have been pretty great.
>> ARTICLE
I pretty much again agree with the male side:

- KonoSuba 

- ERASED

- Dagashi Kashi

- GATE

- Myriad Colors Phantom World

are also my top 5, not in that order though. I'd place Erased at the top followed by Gate, KonoSuba, Myriad and Dagashi.  At sixth place it would be Dimension W though which is way at the bottom in this poll. 
>> ARTICLE
Wait, I can see Phantom World as that's a taste thing for me, but Dagashi in your top 5?  Am I missing something here?  It's like one giant candy advert with no real jokes O.o

What do you like so much about it?
>> ARTICLE
Traditional candy best candy.. I wish my country has an anime about old candies that are dying slowly right now. 
>> ARTICLE
I wrote my reasoning for that some time ago, but I can't be bothered to look it up myself so a short version:

I read the manga and I liked it already there, also I watch countless videos on YouTube of people trying candy from different countries. It some sort of weird fascination and believe that you can learn a lot about a culture if you look at their snack habits. Also I think it's fun watching reactions to weird snacks...

  
>> ARTICLE
Hmm, fair enough, I guess it makes sense that you would like it then.  I might have to start calling you Hotaru ;P
>> ARTICLE
I was slightly afraid Erased wouldn't get the recognition it deserved since it lacks the usual fan service and other common traits used to attract the fan base but it looks like even Japan is able to recognize the shows that stand out once in a while.

Glad to see it is well-received, as it should be.
>> ARTICLE
What? It was one of the most anticipated Anime of this season. Especially on the male side:

http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2015-12-03/japanese-viewers-pick-assassination-classroom-as-most-anticipated-winter-2016-anime/.96059
>> ARTICLE
Ah, well I didn't see that post so I didn't know. Regardless, I'm glad but you can't blame me for fearing it might not be as popular as it is here in the west.
>> ARTICLE
Anime actually don't rake in the numbers just because of the fanservice. It usually needs stuff like good production values, entertainment factor, characters, story, good buzz from the source material and more. Fanservice  is just one factor. Also, Boku Dake manga sold extremely well, nearly breaching top 10 lists. Any manga that breaks through top 20 are guaranteed anime due to their popularity with fans.
>> ARTICLE
I see, thanks for the info!
>> ARTICLE
BokuDake: thriller of the season  
Durarara: coolest shit of the season  
Dagashi Kashi: waifu of the season  
AssClass: best shounen of the season  
KonoSuba: best chuunibyou of the season (don't judge me)
>> ARTICLE
I thought Dagashi Kashi wasn't doing good in Japan. Surprised it made #3 on that list.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad to see many people are walking the path of explosions.
>> ARTICLE
Dagashi Kashi so high. Good to see the best two anime in the top 5 (KonoSuba and Erased). 
>> ARTICLE
Poor taste as alw-  O.O

....hey! They actually have excellent taste this time around, rather than all flocking toward shows with a wish-fulfillment MC, surrounded by females who have big bouncy breasts that *magically* pop out of their clothes.
>> ARTICLE
Whilst a survey and sales numbers are two different things, those sorts of ecchi harem wish-fulfillment LN adaptations that are quite common actually are only rarely hits in terms of disc sales numbers. Only a few become sales hits in their own right (like Infinite Stratos). Most end up with fairly mediocre numbers, and are probably just made to support LN sales.
>> ARTICLE
I guess Dagashi is doing well in Japan, it hasn't managed to grab my focus though:( 

Boku dake no surprise it's great
>> ARTICLE
Oh. I gotta get in on these, then. Starting with Erased, since it looks like it deserves that number 1 spot.
>> ARTICLE
Like how KonoSuba was not even mentioned in the pre-season surveys but now its #1 in the men's division. And when combined with women votes where it didn't even make the top 10, it still made it to the top 5.
>> ARTICLE
Females don't care about PW or Konosuba and males don't care about Nijiro days or Prince of Stride. Whodathunkit?
>> ARTICLE
Like always, female voters show they have better taste than the male voters.

I can appreciate that fact that this popular show is psychological which means we will probably get more psychological shows in the future, which is awesome.
>> ARTICLE
Grimgar is so far out their list. They prolly read the LN already and see it as slow paced, atleast that's how I see it. Since iirc there are only 3 volumes(levels) translated at the moment
>> ARTICLE
Erased definitely deserves it, I'm enjoying it so much. 

Also, it's nice to see Grimgar in the top 20. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually sad that Grimgar is not in top 10 :(

Hope it will have good sales so we get s2.
>> ARTICLE
It's understandable. They changed a lot of things that made the LN more enjoyable. 
>> ARTICLE
No Nurse Witch Komugi-chan R? :(
>> ARTICLE
i'm suprised that grimgar is at 16th place i would have assumed at least top 15 since it has an story line and human characters not cardboard cutouts
>> ARTICLE
On the one hand, really sad to see Haruchika so low.

On the other hand, really happy to see Grimgar so low.
>> ARTICLE
What makes you dislike Grimgar that much?
>> ARTICLE
I have commented on each episode's discussion threads, but a lot of my initial dislike for the show is rooted in the sexism throughout the 1st episode, which I commented on [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/40bxiv/spoilers_hai_to_gensou_no_grimgar_episode_1/cyt8vmr)

Then, on to episode 2, where the insert song sequence got praised like an art piece, when really it was a money-saving/time-wasting measure in my opinion. See comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/41e6zo/spoilers_hai_to_gensou_no_grimgar_episode_2/cz1w2o6) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/41j4nf/one_of_the_best_dialogueless_songonly_story/cz305wp)

Episode 3, more problems with rapey sexist bullshit, from the main character who is supposed to be the person we most identify with. Comments [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/42ghg8/spoilers_hai_to_gensou_no_grimgar_episode_3/czaolco)

And finally episode 4, issues with a manipulative plot contrivance that I saw coming [since episode 2,](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/41e6zo/spoilers_hai_to_gensou_no_grimgar_episode_2/cz1u3ei) and the future clear development of the show into a harem. Comments [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/43jogk/spoilers_hai_to_gensou_no_grimgar_episode_4/czivziq) Not to mention, yet another long insert song with minimal animation in favor of water color stills (at least more appropriate here than in episode 2).

So, yeah, even if you don't agree with me (and I'll be the first to admit I dislike this show more than most people who comment in the discussion threads), at least you probably understand my issues with it.
>> ARTICLE
> the sexism throughout the 1st episode

While it didn't bother me (and I didn't even notice it) I fully respect why you wouldn't like a show based on that.

> it was a money-saving/time-wasting measure 

That might be but I think it was executed very well. That point seems to be quite polarizing when you look back at the discussion post for that episode.

> rapey sexist bullshit

Sexist? Maybe. But how was that "rapey" at all? Didn't give off that vibe to be in the slightest.

> a manipulative plot contrivance that I saw since episode 2

While [Spoiler](/s "his death") was very likely I don't see how it weakens the story at all. It was simply meant to show how the characters would react and that it doesn't always go as planned.

> the future clear development of the show into a harem

I haven't read the LNs but from its tags and comments from people that have read them I don't think it's a harem at all.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah, rapey might be a strong word. But, Haruhiro makes it clear that he feels the girls aren't wearing enough clothing, so they're vulnerable to Ranta, for one. Vulnerable to what exactly? Well, the only thing you can conclude is Ranta, or one of the other guys, forcing themselves on the girls because they're not dressed conservatively enough. So, is it a stretch? Maybe.

I felt that event in episode 4 was weak because we had so little character development to that point. Some people responded in the discussion thread by saying that was basically "the point," that the event just serves to move the story along...but then, why did it happen in episode 4, and not episode 2, or 1? It's not like they spent any time expanding on the world or the characters in those middle episodes.

As far as developing into a harem, I haven't read ahead either, but I've been spoiled by enough comments in the episode 4 discussion thread to assume the harem is where things are headed. I also expected it earlier than that, rather cynically, since it's a light novel adaptation.
>> ARTICLE
Grimgar went up actually, it was never even in top 20 before this season begins, because Grimgar was actually very unpopular in Japan(the LN never sold over 10k average before anime start airing, since it's not under Kadokawa or SoftBank(GA Bunko)'s brand.)

Hope that won't make you mad btw.
>> ARTICLE
The sad thing is, erased is better not because how good it is, but because this season was very weak overall , so slightly above average shows like erased gets hyped up to be a master piece when in reality it is not utter garbage, so its better than most anime by comparison
>> ARTICLE
True as that may be, when was the last time there was really a "good season"?
>> ARTICLE
Not since modern anime .
>> ARTICLE
You are so right! But that happens a lot unfortunately, it's the industry of today...
>> ARTICLE
This is probably the best season we've had for at least a year if you ask me.
>> ARTICLE
The most popular, maybe, but not the best.  Most shows last year were either generic harems, or edgelord garbage, but that's what the anime community eats up so that's what we will get.
>> ARTICLE
Which recent season was better in your opinion? I'm watching 25 shows this season and 14 of those are 8/10s so far for me.

> edgelord garbage

I have no idea what that's supposed to mean, got any examples?
>> ARTICLE
Aot , ajin , Tokyo ghoul divine gate and much more
>> ARTICLE
Mind explaining how those are "edgelord garbage" (god, I hate the term edgy)?
>> ARTICLE
When a series dries to be dark by throwing in as much FORCED DRAMA as the possibly can; "sad back stories", some random guy dying every ep and as much victimizing as possible is what makes people think  these kinds of shows are deep and mature when there really pretentious. Blood and gore isn't mature, character depth and creative writing is.
>> ARTICLE
I am curious to know why you believe erased is just "above average".
>> ARTICLE
Erased has a good premise, like most anime, but is then ruined by time resets, FORCED DRAMA, bland characters and overall bad writing. The show is only decent, nothing more.
>> ARTICLE
This is the strongest season in over a year imo. IDK what you're smoking. 
>> ARTICLE
Really? Give me 5 titles this season and I  will watch and review  them
>> ARTICLE
Ignoring sequels/continuations, there's: Prince of Stride, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju, Dimension W, Grimgar, and Active Raid. Which isn't even half of what I'm watching. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'd say it's about as good as 2014 summer and 2014 fall seasons. But only because Erased is so freaking good.
>> ARTICLE
Erased ain't the only great show this season. Rakugo is my favorite, tbh. But the fact is, I didn't watch this many currently airing shows during any season of 2015. And, yeah, I'd say this is probably the best season since Summer 2014. 
>> ARTICLE
Opposite for me, I gave up on every show I tried this season so far besides Erased (havent tried all of them yet) while summer / fall 2014 I had atleast 4 shows that I watched.
>> ARTICLE
Let's see we have Erased, Konosuba, Dimension W (which I hear is good), Phantom World which I personally enjoy as the main full length shows.

Then we have some fucking amazing shorts. Every short is amazing this season.

So yeah solid year.
>> ARTICLE
Right? Even some of the shitty shows are at least entertaining whereas I only liked spring 2015
>> ARTICLE
Hmm? Really? I heard that Dagashi Kashi is completely flop.
>> ARTICLE
Do a report. Google Erased and scroll to the bottom and do 'send feedback'. I just did, if enough people do then they will change it.
>> ARTICLE
Not OP, but I did the same google search and got the same spoiler picture.  Reported it as well.
>> ARTICLE
Damn that is actually messed up. The first image is the ultimate spoiler. Can't make this stuff up.
>> ARTICLE
He actually [crops up in the OP as the villain](http://imgur.com/yw4MDud), being the one who "shoots" at Satoru in it, albeit pretty much unrecognizable when compared to his teacher self in the past. Makes you wonder why the gun and bullet crop up in the OP if they're not really relevant again.
>> ARTICLE
*Gun symbolizes the unavoidable confrontation of their destiny*

*Bullet is the fate*

*or something*
>> ARTICLE
April fools! -google
>> ARTICLE
Reason number 1 why you never Google something like Erased before finishing.

But yeah I feel ya. :')
>> ARTICLE
If you're watching a mystery or thriller anime you should **never** search for it blindly on google. Even if don't type in anything besides the title--the first result will usually be something like "<anime> dies" or something. C'mon...

It was pretty obvious in the manga that it was him; I kind of wish it didn't go that direction. I didn't finish the anime adaptation but I'd assume you'd pick up on it pretty quick
>> ARTICLE
there was a point in the earlier episodes that kind of hint to who it is, but whether it's intentional or not I have no idea.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the first episode and thought it was him right off the bat because of the dark lighting over the teacher. When I watched the manga, it was written in such a way that you start to doubt that it could be the teacher.
>> ARTICLE
I started to doubt the fact it was him because they made it too obvious.
>> ARTICLE
Who else could it be? It would be even worse for it to be some random person that we never saw in the show. I think a lot of people are watching this show as a "mystery" which I don't think it the proper way to watch it. The anime has some mystery elements to it but it is more of a thriller anime and ultimately a human drama at its heart. But don't take my word for it, here's what the director has to say! 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg9sY0UadS8

I'm not sure but I'm not saying it was bad, just that I thought there were too many clues pointing to the person and it made it too easy. I think you're right though, I'm going to finish the anime with that in mind

>> ARTICLE
Yeah by the halfway point EVERYONE thought it was him, so much that it turned into believing he was just a red herring because "it was just too obvious". I also thought that, however, looking back at it, this is not a Mystery show, so idk why we all expected it to be some crazy revelation.
>> ARTICLE
Haven't read the manga but thought it was him for quite a while, I just didn't know if such a close relationship was normal.

The girls mentioning that he drove them and the sticking seatbelt where the kickers.

Just finished the series, I absolutely loved it.

Edit: a simular thing happened in Doctor Who with Missy being an important character, everyone thought it was a joke because it was too obvious.
>> ARTICLE
Reason I didnt think It was the teacher is because it said the killer didnt know Hiromi was a boy. But after rewatching that was the point -_-
>> ARTICLE
Can you explain how ERASED does not constitute as a Mystery? Pretty sure that's the first genre tag on MAL and Wikipedia. If it isn't a mystery then why is the central conflict finding out who-dun-it?
>> ARTICLE
Because Satoru's main goal wasn't finding out the culprit. He spent more time trying to save those who had died rather than try and confront the killer. If you look at an anime like detective conan, Conan focuses on finding out who the murderer is, he tries to solve the unknown with things he can find. That's quite different from what Satoru did.
>> ARTICLE
What I meant is that it's not your typical "who dun it" kind of mystery; the mystery isnt "who has done the crime", its "how will he save the victims". Thats why it was VERY obvious the whole time who the killer was; even Satoru said it himself , I dont remember th eexact words but something along the lines of "it was so obvious... I knew it all along but I didnt want to accept it" 
>> ARTICLE
Genre classification seems to be kind of messy. In this case, it is obviously not a pure Mystery genre, but it does contain elements of the genre.

The TvTropes page classifies it as a psychological thriller and human drama. Unsurprisingly, there is heavy overlap between the psychological thriller and the mystery genre.
>> ARTICLE
I was just annoyed that Satoru didn't pick up on it. He's a pretty smart guy, how did he seriously not know...
>> ARTICLE
That's fairly obvious, his perception was distorted due to his admiration for his teacher.  Doesn't matter how bright you are, he's human. He's a fucking managaka, not a seasoned detective.
>> ARTICLE
And him helping Hinazuki didn't really seem out of sorts because he'd already said he'd been looking out for her. I didn't think twice about Misato.

I got that but I had a hard time buying it. He's the only viable suspect, satoru has no information let alone evidence on anyone else after rightfully dismissing paper plane guy. Plus he instantly recognised him just by walking near him while he was getting arrested in the original future, but not even a hint of a clue back in the past. For me, it killed my enjoyment of the show, but Idk maybe I'm too picky :P

Untagged or improperly tagged spoilers are not allowed.

Repeated violations of this rule will result in a ban.

Self and link posts should have [Spoilers] in the title as well as the name(s) of the show(s). Self posts may opt to tag spoilers in the self post instead.

Comments should use `[spoiler source](/s "spoiler-chan died")` to protect spoilers. Spoiler source should, at a minimum, contain the relevant source of the spoiler (e.g. One Piece episode 200, or if it's from a different medium, LN/Manga/VN).

That's what I was thinking when I was reading it. Yeah, the mystery bit is something someone else also mentioned. I'm definitely going to finish watching the anime with that in mind. That said, from what I've seen I think the anime adaptation is quite good. I don't like some of the changes and cuts from the manga (though I understand it's necessity) but I think the art is great, the addition of that butterfly is a nice touch, and I think the VA is incredible
>> ARTICLE
Even though it seemed "too obvious", he was getting a lot of screentime, too much for the show to end just with his character being an unimportant, inconsequential role.
>> ARTICLE
Man I thought he was going to hook up with Satoru's mom and he'd be like his new dad or something. 

Did not expect that, though. Suspected it for a little bit, then dismissed it and promptly got sucker-punched by it during the reveal. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this is why I suspected him from the very start. He's like the only adult male in the entire show, I dropped my suspicion after the candy scene in the car because of the "too obvious" thing but after finishing the show I'm not sure if the creator was smart for intentionally misleading or just really dumb, being that obvious about it.
>> ARTICLE
I was exactly the same, if anything adding that made the truth a bit less obvious.
>> ARTICLE
It's supposed to be obvious for the reader in my opinion.

What the author was going for was to recreate the feeling Satoru had of "not wanting to believe it was him," especially after he helped him save Hinazuki.

I think he achieved that pretty brilliantly.

Google is terrible for this. I've heard it's a very bad idea to search up Gurren Lagann on google if you've never seen it. Spoilers everywhere.

Can confirm. Got one of the main events from the show spoiled on me by google auto completing "Gurren Lagann" into Gurren Lagann "Insert Spoiler here".

So yeah, if you're looking to watch the show, go to the website you're watching it on first and search there.

It's almost as though how much people search for or discuss a specific aspect of a topic affects the metrics they use when generating search results. The kinds of things people expect to be spoiler free is getting ridiculous. The world does not revolve around people's attachment to TV shows.

I feel like you overrated how important my reddit post was supposed to be. OP was talking about spoilers from google searches. I replied with a related story of my own experiences because you are supposed to have conversations and discussions on reddit.

I not trying to claim that it should be changed or I have some solution, I was just joining in on the conversation and possibly warning people not to search things about Steins;Gate before they finish it.

Yep, that doomed me on the first watch, too. Was just trying to find the seiyuus name. I didn't recognize Hanakana's voice as instantaneously as I do now. Oh well, I learned: Don't google shit until you're done. Stick to MAL or some other site that is mostly spoiler free.

I saw this few days ago too. But to be honest, anime art is way different from the manga, you wouldn't know who that is unless you look it up. Text is small, but it's just better not to look at the manga related picture when you're only watching the anime.

It is messed up, but at the same time most people guessed this "twist" since episode 4 so it's not as big a spoiler if you know what I mean.

This is only going to get worse.     

You know the people who in years past would flood internet forums with racial slurs and various forms of sexual harassment? The people who, for whatever reason, cannot feel happiness unless they're actively hindering the happiness of others?      

Well, these people have come to a breakthrough of late; that same joyous feeling of upsetting a stranger on the internet may be achieved - in an even more potent form - by spoiling them about a type of media they're interested in. Heck, we've all learned to roll with verbal assaults on our ethnicity or sexual preference by now, but we can never un-know a spoiler that's been imposed on us. It's the perfect bit of low-effort online malice.     

And it's at least partially our fault. The concept of hyper-sensitively sequestering oneself from spoilers is a relatively new thing in our culture. We've created this monster.      

Sure, ideally the balance of the arms race against spoiler-trolls will be tipped by better filtering and such. But failing that, and in the meantime, a far better defense is a far simpler one; conditioning oneself to be okay with spoilers. Regarding the unspoiled state as a nice perk, but completely unnecessary to enjoy a story. Because being spoiled is *okay.* You can still enjoy something you've been spoiled about.
>> ARTICLE
> You can still enjoy something you've been spoiled about.

Truer words have never been spoken. This insane aversion to spoilers is really annoying and it often kills very interesting discussions in many places on the internet, and especially here on /r/anime.

I mean, the other extreme (/a/) is perhaps not the best solution either, but still.
>> ARTICLE
I guess people always have disliked getting stories spoiled, but it does feel like there is a wave of "spoiler hypersensitivity" spreading throughout the internet.
>> ARTICLE
> Because being spoiled is okay. You can still enjoy something you've been spoiled about.

I can agree with this but I do feel that it can hinder my enjoyment somewhat if I know something is coming. I know basically nothing of Jojo Part 4 other than the protagonists. I wouldn't want any of that spoiled.
>> ARTICLE
>these people have come to a breakthrough of late

people intentionally spoiling things is hardly a new thing, remember the Harry Potter release?
>> ARTICLE
Perhaps "breakthrough" is the wrong word. But they have become much more numerous and more aggressive of late. The lengths they went to with the Star Wars Ep 7 spoilers was almost impressive.      

And, as I said at the start, I fear that it's going to get much worse.

That went downhill fast.  The rooftop "twist"?  Oof.
>> ARTICLE
If I knew nothing about this show, then googled it and saw that... it would mean literally nothing to me. I wouldn't remember anything about it. The only way that might spoil something is if someone actually clicked on it and started reading it, which if you do that, you're asking for spoilers anyways.

Also, it doesn't even look like the same person in the anime, so... no big.

Think thats bad? Try going to any Clannad video.

thank god i never searched erased on google when still watching the show XD

It's not like the ultimate spoiler isn't in the op as well lel.

The pic doesn't really spoil anything unless you click on it or go to images. All it shows is a guy in a car who looks a evil. Compared to the show, the characters look nothing alike. Idk, I saw the picture before the show and didn't really feel like I was spoiled.
>> ARTICLE
Tbh, the anime wasn't meant to be watched as a mystery. So it doesn't really matter if that was spoiled or not. It was obvious and was obvious for a reason.
>> ARTICLE
It was almost too obvious though, making it a mystery as many (me included) really doubted that he would be the criminal and wanted to see the reveal!


>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure it wasn't a huge spoiler. You can tell by the way the series was going that it was him the entire time. 
>> ARTICLE
But it was obvious it was him and you'd probably have to zoom in to read it anyway.
>> ARTICLE
Even though it was obvious, it's still not cool to have the picture of the main villain's reveal pop up when you Google the show. It's true that you'll have to zoom to read the text but I don't think anyone even needs to read the text to figure out the meaning of that image.

Google is a search engine that calibrates based on your search history.

Wrong, just tried it on multiple PCs and browsers without even being logged in on any Google accounts, and the search results are identical to OP's picture.

Are they computers you regularly use? Google loads things with tracking cookies and even when it's not tied to an account it still heavily calibrates based on browsing habits. The accuracy with which google can guess who you are based on pure metadata is fuckin scary.
>> ARTICLE
>Are they computers you regularly use?

I even checked on my parents' laptop which they only use to check mail and browse the news, and got the same result, so nope.

So unless Google tracks searches by IP address (which I doubt), you get the same results everywhere.

Why would you doubt that? It seems like the FIRST piece of metadata they would use to ID people to me.

It may also be that my parents are secretly into anime, guess we'll never know...
>> ARTICLE
Nothing I said was wrong, it just doesn't explain this specific instance.
>> ARTICLE
The algorithm is more complex than he mentions. Yes, your previous search history has some impact, but Google's algorithms use over 200 signals to help determine what you are looking for. 

Using multiple PCs and browsers isn't going to change the results drastically since the algorithm does take region into account. Add in there that *Erased* the anime is currently airing so content is fresh (as opposed to the 2012 movie *Erased*). Then there's [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) which will be the reason why crunchyroll, wikipedia, and MAL are some of the first results.

I'm not sure what the original comment was, but the response of "He even searched the word 'Erased'..." seems strange to me since most English sites will have that alias which Google is going to pick up on.

I feel like I'm in the minority here: I've read the manga through to the end, and despite the divergence between it and the show I'm still very excited to see how this plays out.

The show is still rated highly, you aren't the minority.  The minority is the vocal babies crying about an adaptation not carbon copying the manga.

I feel like I'm in an even smaller minority here. I think the manga turned into a trainwreck after it abused the coma to essentially zombify the story. I was really pissed to see the anime adapt the coma, but I still have slight hopes because it took a different direction after the coma.

Right after finishing episode 11 I went and read the whole manga. I'm really excited to see how the anime ends because of the large differences between the two now.

>> ARTICLE
Lots of spoilers and basic manga summary ahead....don't read if you don't want to give away **MAJOR** plot points.

**I REPEAT DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT MANGA SPOILERS**

[Getting memories back spoilers](/n "Satoru goes through a longer process to get his memories back. He receives notebooks from Kenya that basically summarize all of the past events. This helps Satoru start to remember his memories. Starting out he can't tell if his mixed memories are real due to his coma. It isn't until he is in the park and Airi, not Yashiro, break the paparazzi's camera that Satoru gets back his lost memories. The shock is to much for him and he faints - and the story flips forward another year where he wakes up from another coma. After waking up he struggles with remembering Airi - since they never met in the current timeline. Once he does find her, he realizes he can't involve her because she's done so much for him already.")

[Yashiro Arc spoilers](/n "The rest of the series is all about entrapping Yashiro and putting a stop to his murdering ways. You learn that Yashiro was kind of always screwed up - most of it stemming from his brother. His older brother forces Yashiro to help lure young girls to be raped/hurt by the brother. One day the older brother kills one of the girls by accident and Yashiro plots framing his brother as a murder suicide type of thing. This starts the whole framing other people for his murders gig. Oh and he can see threads of fate hanging over people - that is his sign that those people must die. Oddly enough, he sees one over his own head when looking in a mirror.")

[Final Arc spoilers](/n "The final arc is trying to trick Yashiro while he's trying to kidnap the little girl with the beanie. Kenya is there to help, as well as the detective, but they screw up and the girl gets kidnapped. It's up to Satoru to dig through his memories and find where the girl would be at since all of the clues follow past murders. It all ends when Yashiro and Satoru are up on a bridge and Yashiro uses gasoline to blow up the bridge to kill both of them. They all survive though and Yashiro is put on death row. Post adventure we find Satoru is a successful manga artist and he's living life with his mom and the beanie girl who becomes a type of little sister character. Last bit we see is him and Airi meeting by chance and fade to white.")
>> ARTICLE
[Basically:](/n "Instead of attempting to kill the girl with the beanie that Satoru befriends in order to frame him, it seems Yashiro is using her to make it look like Satoru committed suicide (he'll attempt to push Satoru off the building). Some other changes like the location of the final showdown and the fact that Airi broke the paparazzi's camera instead of Yashiro may-have/have-had a major impact on the ending as well").

Will there be closure? with the past episodes they always end on a cliffhanger so I always expected something to happen in the last 5min of an episode. it would be nice to have a conclusive and satisfying episode this time
>> ARTICLE
My friend who has read the manga told me that there will indeed be closure, but since the anime and the manga kind of diverged last episode, there's always the possibility that it is not conclusive, even if it seems kind of unlikely.
>> ARTICLE
I guess either way I'll be reading it once it's done airing. I just hope it would end on a satisfying note for all the anime only watchers. The worst that could happen is ending again on a hook for a season 2
>> ARTICLE
Depending on how you see it, there might be closure or there might not be. I personally didn't like it and felt that there was too much of a void.

I think there is A LOT of closure, it's missing a thing or two that it hints towards but it's still pretty conclusive honestly.

Wait, will there be a second season? Because I don't follow the manga.

Nope, no second season. According to my friend who has read the manga, the story is almost over so there's not enough content for a season 2. They will have to wrap everything up in this episode

Hes talking about a spin off series of Boku dake, which talks about Kenya's life while Satoru was in a coma.  Its basicly Kenya trying to find out who the murderer was.

Rather than an OVA, if this is to be covered, it'll be a full season.

The story ended already. The ending was cool.

So I'm guessing that he rolls himself off the roof in order to force his revival and he somehow fixes everything for a happily ever after ending. It looks like they reused a lot of frames from previous epsiodes as well. I feel like I'm going to be very disappointed with this finale.

Since you decided to write out a serious post with your thoughts I'll give you a serious response to some of your points.

>This ability, tough lazily infodumped through an internal monologue

The ability is first show cased through Satoru noticing the abilities activation, looking for some sort of out of place occurrence, and then stopping the event from happening. Afterwords we are shown a hospital scene with Airi and the ability is told to us in Satoru's taxi ride back home. During the monologue we are told just what happened, Satoru's past experiences with Revival, and Satoru's feelings about it. 

In what way was it lazy? How was this bad for the story?

>Questions like who/what gave him this?, why exactly him? or how do you define something bad? wont be answered throughout the course of this show.

The origin of the time travel is left ambiguous and is no ways detrimental to the story. Satoru also doesn't know the origins of the power but instead tries to make the best use he can from it. An explanation for why Satoru has this power is not needed. Instead the viewer is meant to accept that Satoru has this ability , be it that he was born with it or God gave it to him, just like Satoru himself accepts it.

>The few important time jumps that happen in the story feels so implausible, convenient and coincidental, if there is no proper exploration.

Why do the time jumps feel implausible, convenient and coincidental?

>Not only that, the show also breaks a previously established rule by sending the protagonist several years back instead of the usual few minutes. Even though one could claim that it doesnt break anything, since there wasnt any clear rules in the first place (as we are only taking Satorus experience into account), this is a very weak argument as it doesnt change the fact that the ability in question shows neither consistency nor internal logic it follows.

As you said the "established rules" are only Satoru's previous experiences with the revival. The notable difference between the power this time and all the rest of the times was that [ERASED SPOILERS](/s "something bad happened while he was away and unable to prevent it and the death, his mother, was something that directly affects him.") It's with this context that the viewer can accept that revival acted in a very different way than the previous iterations. Satoru was ALSO confused at the power sending him back so many years, it wasn't something he had planned.

>The time travel also reduces immensely the sense of urgency, excitement and stakes, since you know that the writer just can send him back in time and let him try again until he succeeds.

There was nothing to indicate to the viewer that Satoru has unlimited attempts at each situation. There was no flashback of Satoru failing to save someone and trying multiple times till success nor was there any actions made by Satoru that showed he thought he had an unlimited amount of tries.

>Like I said, the plot jumps back and forth in time and this harms the narratives flow a bit.

Why does jumping back in forth in time harm the narratives flow? How would the story even take place with the time jumps?

>So, this show completely fails as a time travel story

I'm still not convinced.

>Secondly, this show also fails at letting the viewer guessing who the culprit is up until the actual reveal and thus does a terrible job at keeping the audience engaged regarding the thrill of the mystery. It doesnt properly build-up other potential suspects, while simultaneously making the culprit way too obvious. I am neither Oreki Hotarou (Hyouka) nor Shinichi Kudo (Detective Conan), but figuring out who the murderer is, is quite easy past the first couple of episodes for most people, too. Hence, it loses a lot of suspense and only leads to an anti-climatic reveal.

The audience is engaged with the drama between Hinazuki and Satoru and his plans to resolve Hinazuki's situation. As you said previously ERASED isn't a conventional mystery show. Satoru isn't searching for clues nor is he actively looking for the killer. Instead the shows focus is on Satoru preventing the deaths that took place.

I'm not going to try to speak for everyone but I don't think the mystery was laughably obvious nor built up in lousy fashion. There were a few scenes sprinkled in with ambiguous parts for some of the suspect characters. I didn't even really have an idea who the killer could be until around episode 7 or 8 and I was skeptical up to the reveal. I feel like this is subjective though. Anyways at it's core Erased was more a thriller/drama than a "whodunit" type of show and it is not crafted in a way that the viewer is watching for that aspect.

>Themes like parenthood, domestic violence, child abuse and even pedophilia (to some degree) exist, but most of them are presented in such an unsubtle, rushed, immature and over-the-top way to the point it cant be taken seriously by some. This is mostly due to the characters (,but more of that later on) and too swift pacing. Therefore, ERASED fails to comment on social issues in a believable and simply well-executed way.

I think ERASED had a pretty accurate portrayal of domestic violence and child abuse and did an adequate job in portraying Hinazuki's situation and thought process to the viewer. All you've really said was "it's bad because it's bad". Why do you think it was rushed or immature? Why is this "due to the characters"? What did the "swift pacing" leave out?

>Our, often monologuing and infodumping, protagonist, Satoru Fujinuma

The story is told in first person so there are going to be monologues.

Satoru's jaded lifestyle can possibly be attributed to the deaths in his past. The scene with Hinazuki standing in the park is shown multiple times through the show and was the last place she was witnessed. It is why Satoru, as he stated, felt responsible for her death, like he could have done something to save her. Satoru also explains in episode one how Yuuki, an important friend to him, was placed in jail as a murder. Over the course of the show the viewer gets to know why Satoru does what he does and how the "superhero complex" ties into everything.

>Most events in the past time frame are either completely new or dont have much impact on his adulthood, making this also an evidence for the poor execution of the time travel premise. 

This sentence doesn't make sense to me. Are you trying to reference the butterfly effect? 

>Kayo Hinazuki, the girl hes supposed to save in order to alter the future, changes considerably through the course of this show, but is initially only defined by victimizing. Hence, people who prefer to bond with a character through dialogue or setting-and character interactions rather than victimizing said person briefly after its introduction, should be prepared for disappointment.

She goes through abuse and changes over the course of the show with her interactions with Satoru, what is wrong with this? You're implying that her entire character is based off her abuse. The majority of the scenes she was in were with Satoru away from her home. Her character is "introduced" by Satoru's mother explaining the murders in the first episode but our introduction to Hinazuki is with Satoru in the classroom and later after school with Satoru trying to get close to her. That is the scene we learn about who Hinazuki is and what she thinks of Satoru. One of the major points of the show is Satoru saving Hinazuki from her situation.

>Rest of supporting cast...

A supporting cast doesn't need backstories or complex motivations. The supporting cast did the role they were supposed to do, support the main characters. Satoru's friends were everyday childhood friends, and the adult characters all played the role they were meant to do. 

>Presentation

I agree with your points here, overall it was very well done.

>Comparison with the manga:

Haven't read the manga so I skipped this part.

>Conclusion

I didn't come to the same conclusion that you did, which I guess is easy to see from my statements above. I'm sorry you had the experience with the show that you did but I can't say I really agree with any of it. I think there may be more to certain parts than you are giving it credit for.
>> ARTICLE
>>Questions like who/what gave him this?, why exactly him? or how do you define something bad? wont be answered throughout the course of this show.

The origin of the time travel is left ambiguous and is no ways detrimental to the story. Satoru also doesn't know the origins of the power but instead tries to make the best use he can from it. An explanation for why Satoru has this power is not needed. Instead the viewer is meant to accept that Satoru has this ability , be it that he was born with it or God gave it to him, just like Satoru himself accepts it.

Time travel is the core plot device used to shape the storyline. Why don't we get an explanation to how it works? The first episodes were riding on the time travel gimmick and tugging at people's heartstrings by means of nostalgia. I managed to suspend my disbelief for the first half of the show, however, it became glaringly obvious that the show didn't know where to go with its time travel. This show tries so hard to be serious and "realistic" but then slaps you in the face with a supernatural gimmick.


>>The few important time jumps that happen in the story feels so implausible, convenient and coincidental, if there is no proper exploration.

>Why do the time jumps feel implausible, convenient and coincidental?

Like OP said, why can Satoru suddenly jump 18 years instead of the usual minute? Can he control the ability? How? We only know it triggers when Satoru senses danger. Why does he rewind 18 years instead of 1-2 minutes to save his mom? Why did it send him at the exact dates he needed to be not once but twice? And on a side note: why did Satoru freak out and run like a criminal after we are shown that he's a level headed and calculating person?


>>So, this show completely fails as a time travel story

>I'm still not convinced.

Could you elaborate further?

Satoru isn't searching for clues nor is he actively looking for the killer. Instead the shows focus is on Satoru preventing the deaths that took place.

What about all the times Satoru was following people, investigating the shed, investigating Yuuki, talking to the journalist, reading the suspect list (if you were paying attention to the names on the list the answer is so glaringly obvious). You can't deny that this show wanted to be taken as a serious detective/film noire.

In my opinion this is where the show stretched itself too thin. It tried to involve time travel, detective and romance plots but it doesn't have enough runtime to fully flesh them out.

This is a place we can agree. However, I do believe the domestic abuse arc had a terrible conclusion. I don't know anything about the child protection service in Japan, but standard procedure in a lot of countries dictates that children who are victims of child abuse are to be taken to special child protection centers until a suitable solution is found. This may take weeks, months or even years. I don't think the author was aware of this when writing this part of the story.

>>Our, often monologuing and infodumping, protagonist, Satoru Fujinuma

>The story is told in first person so there are going to be monologues.

This is anime. Show, don't tell. I don't want to say monologues are bad, only that animation has better tools to adapt source material.

>>Most events in the past time frame are either completely new or dont have much impact on his adulthood, making this also an evidence for the poor execution of the time travel premise.

>This sentence doesn't make sense to me. Are you trying to reference the butterfly effect?

I agree with you here, but this is a problem with most time travel stories.

Also 100% agree with you here.

This is the exact opposite of what support characters should be. A general rule of thumb in writing characters is to take them out of context and see if they stand as a fully formed person individually. Characters should have their complex backstories and motivations. That way they are not puppets dancing to the writer's strings. In this show the flaws of the support characters could be rectified if it had a longer runtime. But as it stands most of them are one trick ponies that help out MC at key points in the story. I concede that not all support characters can or need to be developed, but in ERASED there are too many "power of friendship" explanations for why they do what they do.

Overall I think this shows suffers from being too short. During the episode discussion threads a lot of people pointed out there is no way the anime can wrap everything up in 12 episodes. Too bad the publishers probably didn't want to risk a 2nd cour.

This show tries so hard to be serious and "realistic" but then slaps you in the face with a supernatural gimmick.

We aren't given an explanation of how it works because the main character himself doesn't know how it works. Revival is supposed to be a power that neither the main character nor the audience fully understands but accepts for what it is. The viewer is given enough context to know how the power works in general, such as that Satoru can't control it, can't use it as he pleases, can't stop time, etc. I don't think a story of a character with a power he doesn't understand is inherently bad. I also don't think that introducing some sort of 3rd party narrator to inform the audience but leaving Satoru in the dark would have been beneficial. It's left as a mysterious element that matches the tone of the show.

>Like OP said, why can Satoru suddenly jump 18 years instead of the usual minute? Can he control the ability? How? We only know it triggers when Satoru senses danger. Why does he rewind 18 years instead of 1-2 minutes to save his mom? Why did it send him at the exact dates he needed to be not once but twice? And on a side note: why did Satoru freak out and run like a criminal after we are shown that he's a level headed and calculating person?

I posted this one previously up above so I'll just copy paste my response.

"As you said the "established rules" are only Satoru's previous experiences with the revival. The notable difference between the power this time and all the rest of the times was that [ERASED SPOILERS](/s "something bad happened while he was away and unable to prevent it and the death, his mother, was something that directly affects him.") It's with this context that the viewer can accept that revival acted in a very different way than the previous iterations. Satoru was ALSO confused at the power sending him back so many years, it wasn't something he had planned."

He is sent back 18 years instead of 1-2 minutes because the underlying cause of the death was the events that unfolded 18 years ago. He is sent back twice because of the unique and stressful circumstances that he has never faced before which affected the power in a unique way.

Side note: Because the murder was a very surprising and stressful situation. Many people act illogically when something of that nature happens whether is be mental breakdowns or panic. Satoru had the weapon in his hands, blood on him, the police at his door, just to much information to process and had a mental overload and needed to escape. He felt like his reality had shattered. I don't think it was the most logical decision but I also don't think that it was out of character to respond like that given the circumstances.

>This is a place we can agree. However, I do believe the domestic abuse arc had a terrible conclusion. I don't know anything about the child protection service in Japan, but standard procedure in a lot of countries dictates that children who are victims of child abuse are to be taken to special child protection centers until a suitable solution is found. This may take weeks, months or even years. I don't think the author was aware of this when writing this part of the story.

The anime showed that they couldn't prove that child abuse was happening. Kayo denied it, the mother was out when child services came to visit, and she dunked Kayo in cold water to erase the bruises and marks that she had given her.

>This is anime. Show, don't tell. I don't want to say monologues are bad, only that animation has better tools to adapt source material.

I liked the monologues and I think they were needed to get Satoru's perspective and thoughts about what was happening since the story is told from Satoru's point of view. I don't even think the monologues were that heavy and the anime didn't monologue events for us but showed us what happened and followed up with Satoru's thoughts. I think this is a subjective area though.

>This is the exact opposite of what support characters should be.

I don't know how you can say that supporting character supporting the main characters is the exact opposite of what they need to do. Obviously they shouldn't be cardboard cutouts with no personality but, for example, glasses-kun in Satoru's friend group didn't need a complex backstory for his purpose in the story to be understood or for the viewer to understand him as a character. We know who all the main characters are, what makes them stand out, and why they make the decisions that they did. I also think that the supporting character fulfilled their role too. I'm not sure what "power of friendship" moments your mentioning so I can't really comment there.

Thanks for the response and the discussion!

Thank you for your great reply and although I cant agree with most of your points, they are understandable.

One thing thing though:

Demanding the audience to just accept the time travel as it is, is quite .... unsatisfying.

See, you have a supernatural ability that is seemingly exclusively there for one person in an otherwise mundane setting. It has no patter, thus can make literally everything happen. It can happen after or before an incident and can even send you back 18 years back. Its so arbitray. 

And I am supposed to take as it is? It isnt a comdey like OPM where you should not take Saitamas strenght seriously, it tries to be smart and well-written. The time travel has too many holes, its simply immersion breaking. 
>> ARTICLE
Time travel as a general concept is inconsistent with reality.  It is literally impossible for a show to properly explain time travel because real-world physics dictates it is an impossibility.  So automatically you have to suspend disbelief when time travel is used as a device in a show, because there *is* no logical explanation.  For a show to write it in as an essentially excepted and biological part of Satoru's character is not poor writing, by any stretch.  There is no "good" way to write time travel, which is often a very common complaint with said plot device as a result.  The audience just has to accept it working, accept the mechanics as portrayed by the show (and the show *did* explain them), and then go along with the ride.

If you think it is immersion breaking, well, then that is entirely on what you consider an acceptable level of suspension of disbelief, something the author has no control over.
>> ARTICLE
Time travel is inherently going to have problems. Even the best VN/anime-adapted story with time travel as a prominent plot device, Steins;Gate, suffers from this when [](/s "Okabe has to time leap a few hours back into the afternoon while he's getting shot, but previously we learned that uploading your memories still takes about 45 minutes, even with the direct connection to CERN"). *Edit: Not sure if this was covered in the anime or not, but definitely in the VN

Not to mention his [](/s "remembering the timeline very clearly when no one can is unexplained").

>It has no patter, thus can make literally everything happen. 

Well, Satoru is fairly limited by the fact that he has to act like an 11-year-old while being restricted to an 11-year-old's body. Cue [](/s "scene where he almost drowns. Adult Satoru could've given him a good punch, even with the seatbelt stuck").

Just so you know someone agrees with you, thank you for writing this. It makes me so happy to know that I am not the only person who thought the writing in this show was disappointing. This show reminded me a lot of madoka magica for its interesting premise and dark atmosphere that devolves into a failure of plot writing.
>> ARTICLE
Because the time travel isn't the focus of the show. It's a means for the mangaka to deliver the message and story that he really wants. That's why he doesn't focus on Revival, because it is not meant to be taken seriously much more than setting up the situation for the anime.

In my mind, its the same way those mind machines work in Inception. Nolan could've wasted a bunch of time explaining how those machines work and then have people just argue over the logistics of how entering the mind doesn't seem plausible and ish. Instead, he completely skips the science/technology behind it to focus on the real plot and makes an amazing movie.

The time travel is a big part of the premise though. We wouldnt have this show without the time travel and also changes a lot.

the show isn't about time travel. it's only a tool to tell the rest of the story.

You're making a generalization since shows with good writing manage to avoid falling into a situation where the plot device for the story to advance needs to be forced, yes most shows have forced plot devices here and there but the problem with Erased is their frequency, the Revival thing is only the biggest offender since it's an essential part of the storyline

ok i can see that. However couldn't ignoring Revival add to the theme of the story? Like how we should be expected to just believe that Revival works. I feel thats how it works for the MC too, he just goes along with Revival, never really trying to figure it out. He just believes that it does what's necessary and he follows. 

Also would you consider like [FLCL](/s "ignoring the space police in FLCL a huge flaw too?") That's arguably a huge part of the story left out that doesn't affect the actual story. 
>> ARTICLE
> However couldn't ignoring Revival add to the theme of the story?

It's a plot relevant power that becomes extra relevant in his confrontation against the main villain, so no

> Like how we should be expected to just believe that Revival works. I feel thats how it works for the MC too, he just goes along with Revival, never really trying to figure it out. He just believes that it does what's necessary and he follows.

This could be worked upon, the MC doesn't needs to be know all the details of the origin of his power but he should at least know how it works and it's capacities from past experiences

The way Revival was handled in the story was awfully random though

>Also would you consider like FLCL That's arguably a huge part of the story left out that doesn't affect the actual story.

I haven't watched that yet so I can't comment, it's on my list though

>> ARTICLE
What holes are you referring to?
>> ARTICLE
By holes I mean inconsistencies and unexplained aspacts.
>> ARTICLE
I think he means specifically. What inconsistencies are there specifically? 

I agree that there are unexplained aspects, but for the type of story that this was, I personally feel that explaining the origin of revival would have cheapened the whole experience. 

It's just a type of story writing. I believe it's called magical realism. In writing like this, a lot of the time the fantasy elements aren't explained. Think about Harry Potter. Do they ever try and explain *why* magic exists in an otherwise normal world? No. You simply accept it, because it's just one more of the many foundations of the story. Asking 'why does this magic exist?' is akin to asking 'why is this story set in London?' or 'why is his best friend ginger?'. It just *is*, and it doesn't need an explanation.

If you don't enjoy fiction like that then fair enough, but it's pretty standard practice for a story such as this one. I personally recognised this by the second episode, and I knew then that revival's origins would never be explained, nor did I want them to. The story is about a boy finding courage, saving a girl from abuse, and working together with his friends to take down a killer. It's not about the complexities of time travel and it never was.

You said that you don't find to children befriending each-other to be thrilling. This is why you didn't enjoy the show. Because, more than anything, this is what the show is about. And this, to me and others, is incredibly thrilling, especially when we're constantly reminded that their friendship is hanging by a (spider's) thread.
>> ARTICLE
Obviously there are tons of unexplained aspects (see: literally all of it), but what are the inconsistencies? Honestly, the inconsistencies are what would bug me more than anything, and I didn't really find any in the show. Sure it was all unexplained and that mystery is kind of annoying, but it never was what the show was about and honestly, I'd rather have no explanation than some contrived or half assed one thrown in just for closure.

Time travel happening when he is ready to go to jail but not happening when he is ready to drown, 5 minute time travel not ever being used again aside from the first episode

What I'm bringing attention here is that the problem is not that it is a plot device, the problem is that it just is  a really forced plot device, it irks me because it is only there to make the MC succeed, it's more the author's power than the MC's

In the manga he can even will the power forward, in the anime this isn't even addressed, it's just happens randomly and that just screams plot convenience

Neither of these are inconsistencies. When he was about to drown he was ALREADY in revival. If he did it again, *that* would be an inconsistency, because there was no precedent set for a double revival. 

Likewise for your second point. The majority of the show takes place IN revival. There would be no reason for him to be able to double down during this time.
>> ARTICLE
> Neither of these are inconsistencies. When he was about to drown he was ALREADY in revival. If he did it again, that would be an inconsistency, because there was no precedent set for a double revival.

There was no precedence for almost anything regarding that power, it had no set of well estabilished rules or factors since it was more like the author's power than the protagonist's power, in fact there is nothing saying a revival while he was in the past would be impossible, you're only projecting here

Oh come off it. The rules for revival were quite clear. Do you really need everything to be spelled out for you? It's quite easy to deduce why and when revival occurs. 

In case you're not being deliberately ignorant I'll explain. When a tragic event happens, IF Satoru has a way of preventing it, revivial will take him back in time to a point in time WHEN he has the ability to prevent it. Simple and clear cut. 

That's how revival works all the way throughout the show. I doesn't take a genius to see that. You don't need a list of rules read out to you like in Death Note. It acts consistently, all throughout the show.

However, at no point in the show did he pull a double revival. So obviously, we can deduce that it wasn't possible. For you to expect something that we had no precedent for and call it an inconsistency when it doesn't happen is absolutely ridiculous.

No, they weren't very well estabilished. In the anime, it seemed something random but in the manga it actually looked like he could will the power to be used, well regardless of that, they say Revival can be used when he needs to rescue someone from a fatal encounter but this doesn't explains at all why the power activated and sent him 18 years to the past when he was sent to jail or why it even sent him 18 years to the past in the first place


> In case you're not being deliberately ignorant I'll explain. When a tragic event happens, IF Satoru has a way of preventing it, revivial will take him back in time to a point in time WHEN he has the ability to prevent it. Simple and clear cut.

It's not a "tragic event" in general. The anime implies that it's something random that happens unwillingly (AKA the author's will) when someone dies but this could be worked upon if the rules regarding the power actually made sense and remained constant to make it look like less of a forced plot device, however we have situations where revival is activated when for example, he was being sent to jail so with this we can only conclude that revival applies to him too which brings the question of why it didn't work when he was about to drown in a lake

> That's how revival works all the way throughout the show. I doesn't take a genius to see that. You don't need a list of rules read out to you like in Death Note. It acts consistently, all throughout the show.

Certainly not and I already explained why it isn't a consistent power and why it's a forced plot device in my two previous comments


>However, at no point in the show did he pull a double revival. So obviously, we can deduce that it wasn't possible.

Just because something didn't happened means it's a fact? Things need to be estabilished to make sense and not just deducted based on the fact that "it didn't happen", as I said that's only you projecting so you can bypass some of the errors of the story, it's just like making a headcanon and acting as if it's canon

Also explain to me why he somehow knew that going to 18 years in the  past a second time would somehow be "his last revival", also explain to me why the revival didn't save him in the lake (without projecting this time) when it saved him from being sent to jail

> For you to expect something that we had no precedent for and call it an inconsistency when it doesn't happen is absolutely ridiculous.

It is, the forced plot device power called "Revival" is literary there to be used by the author to move the plot along, the 5 minute function we saw at the beginning was never used again and there is literary no reason to believe it wouldn't activate when he was drowning when it activated when he was getting sent to jail

Anyway, revival is just one of the many forced plot devices the show offers to us so...
>> ARTICLE
The revival isn't meant to help him, it's meant to help others. He often gets injured during the revival as seen in the very first scene.

It doesn't explains why it triggered when he was ready to get to jail and why he though that would be "his last revival" for some reason

The fact that it's inconsistent opens the opportuniy for that power to just be used as a forced plot device which is a bad thing

Author should have estabilished rules regarding it and incorporated them in the story

Yes, but it's specifics are never explained so it opens the way for Revival to become a forced plot device instead of a legit part of the story

ah I can see that, I didn't mind that it's not explained but it is definitely a way to move the plot forward.

I think that it's kind of a problem in time travel shows tbh, I think Steins;Gate had this kind of problem at the end if I remember correctly. 
>> ARTICLE
That power's explanation in the anime definitely bugged me and made me scratch my head, I ended up reading the manga to get me some more complete explanations but I also ended up getting none there...so yeah, the only thing I found in the story is that Revival is more likely the author's power than the MC's

Also I'm pretty sure S;G deals with the time travel theme and it's consequences a lot better than Erased
>> ARTICLE
I think it's all connected with the time travel wanting him to stop what happened in 1988. When he gets sent back before getting arrested, it happens because he can't stop it if he goes to prison. When he's getting drowned, it doesn't happen because at that point, he'd already stopped it.

But I do agree with the 5 minute revival thing not being used enough. Perhaps the entity that granted him powers deemed other things unimportant while he was focused on stopping the murders? Or maybe the larger jumps use up all his power so he can't go back in shorter spurts.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's totally connected to that incident since he had and used the power before, and in the end we can only try to guess what is up with his powers because there is far too little information to work with
>> ARTICLE
Obviously he had the power before, but the murders were the first time he went back in time more than just a few minutes. Clearly it was connected.
>> ARTICLE
The power sent him back because the murder of his mother was connected to the incident that happened in 1988, we can't really say anything about what his powers were for because we know so little about it

I mean if he jumps back while he was about to drown I think he would be dead. Time travel doesn't teleport you somewhere, but it teleports you some when. Episode 11 wasn't a "jump". It was time going by normally. Since I am assuming the killer saved him.

Knowing how he got the Revival isn't relevaent to the story because the killer has nothing to do with his power.

Kayo's situation with her mother had little to do with the killer and yet she was focused upon and in the end (at least in the manga) MC's powers were pivotal for him to understand how the killer operates

Anyway I'm not saying that his power should have been explained or given a original, I'm just saying that it should have been more explores and a bigger part of the plot, for example his 5 minute revival from episode 1 could have been used more and the author could have set up more rules to make it so the power doesn't becomes the plot device it ended up becoming

When you mention inconsistencies, I immediately think that you suggest that there are contradictions  *within* the narrative's mechanics in and of themselves. There are no holes in the show's time travel, just a pretty unsatisfying amount that is left open to interpretation. 
>> ARTICLE
I meant inconsistency regarding the powers surrounding Revival and how they work
>> ARTICLE
That special "power" Satoru has is best left out and not explained. The viewer has to accept it as it is and watch the anime while also knowing the MC's power, it helps making a more a interesting story. There is no need to explain what it is, or the story would become way too fantasy for the realistic plot it has.

As for myself, I had no problems that the MC had this power since it made the show more interesting.
>> ARTICLE
I personally found the time travel aspect just fine, since it wasn't trying to be sci-fi and realistic, but instead was more of a supernatural thriller piece, where the time travel was merely a story device to explore the real 'meat' of what the story was about; relationships, hope, memories vs reality, motivation, trust/faith.  

It's as 'arbitrary' and 'immersion-breaking' as Death Note, which also had a supernatural story device that showed exceptions in its rules as the story went on.  Death Note is similar because it wasn't a show about a magical book, but instead about how the magical book affected the characters' relationships and their perception of justice, right/wrong, manipulation, blackmail through threat of force vs. actual danger.

I think Boku Dake failed as a show for you because it wasn't the type of show you were expecting and measuring it to be.  It's a bad sci-fi because it's not a sci-fi, and it's a bad mystery because it's not a mystery... Certain elements of those genres are there, but I felt the main story was more about the characters and their relationships.  It was about an adult man being able to relive his childhood, realizing the tiny things he overlooked when he was a kid, being able to show appreciation for them, and getting a clearer picture of the value in all the relationships he stumbled through blindly and failed to notice when he was young.  (His mother's treatment of him,  Yuki's role in inspiring him, Kenya's friendship, Airi's unwavering faith when everything was against him, even Yashiro's 'father figure' moments that made Satoru who he is, etc.)  

The genre it belongs to is a thriller because it focuses on emotions created by its situations... from the fear of a serial killer, to the birthday glove exchange, to Kayo getting her first fried egg for breakfast, to Satoru realizing Kayo was married, and I felt it did a good job for me in creating those emotional moments, so for me it was a very good thriller anime.

>I'm not going to try to speak for everyone but I don't think the mystery was laughably obvious nor built up in lousy fashion. There were a few scenes sprinkled in with ambiguous parts for some of the suspect characters. I didn't even really have an idea who the killer could be until around episode 7 or 8 and I was skeptical up to the reveal. I feel like this is subjective though. Anyways at it's core Erased was more a thriller/drama than a "whodunit" type of show and it is not crafted in a way that the viewer is watching for that aspect.

Are you joking? Not only was Sensei literally bathed in shadow in every single shot and was often seen looking pretty damn menacing, but at no point was anyone even close to plausibly being the killer. Yeah, there were other "factors" throwing you off the scent, but they were just shitty red herrings that never even got resolved or explained. The worst one was the scene where you see Kenya and sensei talking at the end of an episode like it means something, but of course, it was never even explain or addressed. Another one was when Satoru mentions Kayo to Jun and he flips his nut looking all suspicious for like 10 seconds. Why? Because cheap mystery in place of actually compelling content. Stuff like that isn't good writing or mystery, in fact it's the literal lowest form of it. Regardless of what you call it, thriller or mystery, there is no excuse for muddying the waters with utterly pointless scenes like that. None at all.

> Not only was Sensei literally bathed in shadow in every single shot and was often seen looking pretty damn menacing

That's simply not true and is a gross exaggeration. There was one shot "bathing the sensei in shadow" early on in the plot and that was when Satoru was going through the papers on his desk. After that I don't remember any moments like you mentioned until Hinazuki was saved, which was around episode 7 or 8. After that the anime started building up the sensei reveal.

>The worst one was the scene where you see Kenya and sensei talking at the end of an episode like it means something, but of course, it was never even explain or addressed

It was explained in episode four that Kenya was meeting with the sensei so that Kenya and his friends could plan out a surprise birthday party for Satoru. This was why Satoru and Hinazuki were given after school duties together and everyone left before they got back. The sensei also tells the Kenya that it was Hinazuki's birthday. Kenya explains this during the birthday party.

>Another one was when Satoru mentions Kayo to Jun and he flips his nut looking all suspicious for like 10 seconds. Why?

Because before this everything was pointing away from Jun and the anime had painted him in a good light. The shots focus on Jun's nervous and stuttering behavior, which he always had, reminds the viewer that Jun is not 100% clear and there is a possibility that he is the culprit. 

As to why he "freaked out" Jun always acted in that manner through the show. He stuttered in every conversation with Satoru and was a very feint of heart individual. Jun got nervous being directly questioned from Satoru, and the anime decided to focus on that nervous behavior as a way to set some suspense for that scene. The shots focus was on Jun's demeanor, not on the conversation as a whole like previous times.

>Because cheap mystery in place of actually compelling content. 

How were these two instances cheap? Are you implying that red herrings are bad?

>Stuff like that isn't good writing or mystery, in fact it's the literal lowest form of it. Regardless of what you call it, thriller or mystery, there is no excuse for muddying the waters with utterly pointless scenes like that. None at all.

ERASED isn't a "whodunit" mystery anime. It's a thriller/drama with some mystery added in. The scenes you listed above were not pointless. 
>> ARTICLE
>That's simply not true and is a gross exaggeration.

It's not though. I could make an imgur gallery of all the times he at the very least has the upper portion of his body shadowed. I'm not talking about constant, full on "bathing" all the time, that was an exaggeration, but to say he isn't often at least somewhat darkened in someway isn't correct. 

>It was explained in episode four that Kenya was meeting with the sensei so that Kenya and his friends could plan out a surprise birthday party for Satoru

You've got me here - I didn't notice that. Even so, do you honestly consider that to be quality mystery? Quality thriller? Whatever you want to call it, it's lazy. And that's my main issue, really; lazy red herrings/appeals to emotion. Talking again about the Jun scene, I'm fully aware that the purpose of the shot was "set some suspense for that scene", but does that vindicate it? Of course not. It's not exactly a difficult writing task to make a scene tense when there's no requirement to actually have it relate to anything in any way beyond that one moment. It was just a hamhanded way to get a momentary rise out of the audience; to make them question things for a second without it actually having any wider relevance. I mean the tension of that scene is immediately drained in the next sentence, so the purpose of it was completely confined to that one scene. They could have dumped absolutely any source of "tension" into that moment and had it be just about as relevant. 

You seem to want to have it both ways with you're "it's not a mystery, it's a thriller" thing. You basically call it "aspects of mystery" when you percieve it to be good mystery, and it's thriller when it's not.  You can't just create an absolute defence of the show like that. I mean you say it's not a "whodunnit" show, but then defend the "whodunnit" moments as simply "aspects of mystery" and "mystery added in". It's inconsistent. 

>Are you implying that red herrings are bad?

They are when they're shit, yeah. Good red herrings are meant to give you actual probable cause to suspect something other than the truth, not just be some random distraction that ends up being utterly irrelevant.

The major visual clues with the sensei comes after Hinazuki was saved. Before that there were very few scenes that portrayed him in a bad light. Instead he is built up as a father figure for Satoru and an all around good guy for going to the lengths that he did to help him. After Hinazuki is saved the anime starts to include scenes that build toward the sensei reveal. The sensei is built up as  a character that the viewer is supposed to come to really like and approve of just like Satoru does because of his good nature and actions. After the Hinazuki situation is resolved we are given more scenes that portray the sensei at another angle which is supposed to slowly break down our trust for him. It was tense, thrilling, and well directed.

>You've got me here - I didn't notice that. Even so, do you honestly consider that to be quality mystery? Quality thriller?

It made me feel doubt in Kenya and curious about his actions for an episode so yea? Why wouldn't I consider that "quality"?

>Whatever you want to call it, it's lazy. And that's my main issue, really; lazy red herrings/appeals to emotion.

It was just a hamhanded way to get a momentary rise out of the audience; to make them question things for a second without it actually having any wider relevance.

I don't agree with you at all here. It wasn't lazy. It was a very well directed scene that caused tension, that made me hold my breath at what was going to happen next. Which is what a thriller is supposed to do. The scene stayed consistent with the atmosphere of the show, it keep Jun as a possible suspect in peoples minds, and it didn't take away from the narrative at all.

>I mean the tension of that scene is immediately drained in the next sentence, so the purpose of it was completely confined to that one scene.

Which is fine since the primary purpose of that scene was to create a bit of thrill for the moment. Though it does extend beyond that.

>You seem to want to have it both ways with you're "it's not a mystery, it's a thriller" thing. You basically call it "aspects of mystery" when you percieve it to be good mystery, and it's thriller when it's not. You can't just create an absolute defence of the show like that.

I'm saying this isn't a Sherlock Holmes mystery. We aren't given a list of clues, in depth research into all the suspects, etc. Most of the mystery elements come before Hinazuki is saved at around episode 7 or 8. After that the anime PURPOSELY starts to focus in on one suspect, the sensei. And with the seemingly red herrings of the sensei I was skeptical/didn't want it to be him up until the reveal. It had a very nice build up and a stunning conclusion.

This sums up most of my problems with the review (besides the poor punctuation), it's pretty interesting that somebody could watch this show and classify it as not good.

For me what killed it was the completely implausible character action. When a show is made to be so realistic with such a suspenseful and serious atmosphere, it is much easier to break the immersion.
>> ARTICLE
What exactly do you mean by that?
>> ARTICLE
how is it interesting? the very nature and idea of opinions are bound to lead to contrasting takes on art.

personally i thought it was just average. the premise was interesting and the first few episodes were well donw, but the show flips its focus and instead of focusing on the power and on saving the three and therefore his mom, it builds on the relationship between kayo and himself. that as a relationship was really well done. but it then falls flat at the end, and the end is simply too rushed yet at the same time a fair closure.

if i may ask (not trying to be prude; genuinely asking you), what about the show makes you surprised it could be called not good? i would enjoy to hear your take on it

* Introduction

It's fine. Your introduction doesn't have a solid hook but you went straight to the point. My only gripe with it is the following:

> So, why is it that highly rated at the time I was working on this amateurishly written review? Here are my supposedly in-depth thoughts.

Don't "make fun" of your own writing. It shows that you don't have *too* much confidence with it.

* Content

This section is good. If there's one way to improve it, I'd recommend splitting it to two smaller sections titled "Characters" and "Story." Your other sections are noticeably smaller than the "Content" section and I think it's better if all sections are relatively around the same size, especially for your style of writing.

* Presentation

It's pretty good though it seems like you don't have too much experience with music and with analyzing scene composition. Regardless, you presented your points well enough.

If this is your first time making a review, then I'm looking forward to your future ones. It's definitely better than a lot of anime reviews I've read in this subreddit so keep it up!

I worte the "content" section longer because the writing is the most important aspect to me. 

Yeah, I really should have splitted this section though.

>> ARTICLE
So disclaimer I loved this show (and the manga even more) so I'm probably biased in favor of it most of the time.  That said I agree it is far from perfect, but no shows are perfect or even close to perfect.
  


>lazily infodumped through an internal monologue
  
Ok so we have an ability that no one knows about but him.  He HAS to tell us about it through his thoughts.  The show also shows us him using it during the explanation basically to start the show.  You seem to think "internal monologues" are inherently bad which is just not true.  Think of it like a book.  You get tons of information from inside a characters head.  This show actual felt like reading a book with the amount of internal dialogue, and I don't think this is a bad thing.

>Questions like who/what gave him this?, why exactly him? or how do you define something bad? wont be answered throughout the course of this show. 
  
Of course you're not wrong here.  But you have to understand that the *character himself* doesnt know these answers.  Are you implying that its unrealistic or bad storytelling for a character to have an ability that he doesn't undersatnd or no where it came from?
  
>To make things worse, these revivals have no clear pattern as to when they exactly occur. 
  
Them having no clear pattern is consistency in itself.  They have no clear pattern because *there is no clear pattern*.  The character himself doesn't know how it works so of course there's no pattern.  There's nothing inherently bad about an abillity that has no pattern.
 
>previously established rule by sending the protagonist several years back instead of the usual few minutes
  
It wasnt a rule, it was just how it always worked in his personal experience.  He had never gone back more than a few minutes before.  Of course, he never had an event as crazy or traumatic as what happened to him in the first episode.  This is not a flaw with the show.  We have a character who understands almost nothing about his power.  Do you want to introduce a narrator who can explain it to the viewer without the character knowing?
  
>it doesnt change the fact that the ability in question shows neither consistency nor internal logic it follows. 
  
This is the same thing I've been saying.  The character knows almost nothing about the power, there is no logic.  It's consistent in the fact that the viewers AND the maincharacter don't know how it works.
  
>The time travel also reduces immensely the sense of urgency, excitement and stakes, since you know that the writer just can send him back in time and let him try again until he succeeds.
  
I disagree because when he goes back in time the second time he says (or rather thinks) that he knows it will be his last ever revival.  Maybe you can say how does he know that but that wasnt your point.  Very early you know he won't have any more revivals so there is plenty of urgency, excitement, and high stakes.
  
>the time travel aspect is left unexplored and only serves as plot device in order to conveniently progress the plot further and to have a smart kidas a protagonist.
  
I'm not sure what you mean by "smart kid", but as far as the power being a plot device sure.  I mean the story isn't Steins Gate, the timetravel is a very small aspect of what is really a psychological drama.  And how would it be explored?  You have a character with an ability that he doenst know how he got or how it works.  How can you explore this?  Should he have stopped tryinig to save Kayo and done some research into his ability?  How would he research it?  We have a character who just accepts his ability that he can't even really control, and that is fine by me.

>Secondly, this show also fails at letting the viewer guessing who the culprit is up until the actual reveal and thus does a terrible job at keeping the audience engaged regarding the thrill of the mystery. 
  
I agree with this with respect to the anime.  If it was anyone other than sensei it woulda been stupid because the killer in a mystery cant just be some random.  And sensei was the only guy with any kind of screen time.  And if this ruins it for you I respect that.  For me I didn't really care because it was all about the process and the journey rather than the result.  Sure *idealy* you would have multiple suspects, and this was much better handled in the manga.  Still, I dont think its a big enough flaw for me personally to really effect my enjoyment very much.
  
And I was absolutely engaged and on the edge of my seat each episode, mainly because *I had no idea who would live or die*.  I could have easily seen Kayo still dying, or Kayo being saved but someone else dying.  There was plenty of mystery and intensity even knowing that the sensei was probably the killer.

>Themes like parenthood, domestic violence, child abuse and even pedophilia (to some degree) exist, but most of them are presented in such an unsubtle, rushed, immature and over-the-top way to the point it cant be taken seriously by some.
  
The mom is my favorite mom character in anime and I thought parenthood was handled very well, with both her and Kayo's mom as a contrast.  Child abuse I thought was handled really well too.  Remember these are kids, and people like Kenya didnt know what to do even though he knew something was happening.  Other parents and teachers knew, and you get to see how its not quite so simple as just calling child services.  Domestic violence ehhhh not so much but you cant just have that many themes.  Parenthood and childabuse were the leading themes and you cant expect it to have 10 different well developed themes.  Better to focus on a few.  Child pedophilia wasnt really a thing, maybe because of the target demographic it was a bit too extreme.
  
> people appearing out of nowhere or stupid decisions happen way too often
  
Can you give some specifics here?  If you're talking about the mom remember she was following him the whole time, and she is well established at being a "Youkai" and anticipating satoru's moves and thoughts.  As far as stupid decisions I could use some examples but I'm sure there are plenty.  The question is are they stupid or *unrealistically* stupid.
 
>but the plot also feels quite rushed and strongly messy towards the ending,

I agree here, they basically had a 12 chapters of manga to cram into two episodes.  I'm glad they opted for an anime only ending because trying to cram the whole camp arc into 2 episodes would have been a disaster.  The ending was FAR from a trainwreck thought, and while it was just decent it was good enough to not ruin the first 3/4th of the show that were really strong.
  
>Our, often monologuing and infodumping, protagonist,

This is perfectly normal for a mystery centered around one character who is basically on his own.  Did you expect him to pick a friend to talk to just so there's an excuse for him not to monologue?  Maybe a bad example but think about The Hunger Games first book.  75% of the that whole book is internal dialogue and its perfectly normal for a book.  Maybe you didnt think it transitions well to an anime format but I thought it was fine.
  
>The crucial point is, even though we get to see his childhood, we dont witness how said time is responsible for what he will become as an adult. 

I'll agree for the most part, there's more stuff in the manga but it's true that we are mostly told about Satoru rather than a story that "tells us by showing".  Kenya basically says he's a loner but we dont see how or why he became that (at least not really).  But again, its a matter of priorities, and I think with 12 episodes it didnt really bother me that it was kind of just told to us.  I accepted it and moved on to the more important parts of the show.
  
>people who prefer to bond with a character through dialogue or setting-and character interactions rather than victimizing said person briefly after its introduction, should be prepared for disappointment.

 Probably the most unreasonable opinion you've had.  You seem to be saying Kayo was a good character who changes over the course of the show, but then apparently its a disappointment because she was a victim?  IDK maybe you need to expand on this but I thought Kayo's development as a person was the best part of the first half.
  
>Also, the culprit in particular and a certain female character make the conflict quite morally lopsided with their behavior, backstories and motivations and overall characterization.
 
Not sure what you mean by morally lopsided, but I would hope our villain is morally lopsided.  It was pretty disappointing that they cut 75% of his backstory to be fair.  By female are you talking about the mom?  Sure she's pretty terrible person but you dont think there are examples of child abuse by mothers who were abused themselves?  I don't think this is bad from a literary standpoint.
  
>While not outstanding and breathtaking

This was in reference to the presentation, which I completely disagree with probably more than anything you said.  I thought the cinematography, animation/art, soundtrack, and just the way the director conveyed the story were all top notch.
  


>> ARTICLE
>Comparison with the manga
  
I agree with most of your manga points, and the biggest thing to me is cutting 75% of Yashiro's backstory.  Its definitely less obvious that he's the villain.  I agree the art was pretty weak.
  
> but it actually isnt substantial, thrilling and intelligent enough to call it a good show. 
  
Intelligent, maybe not, but I found it incredibly thrilling and was nervous and on the edge of my seat for almost all of the first 2/3rds.  I think its hard to say its not at least a "good show".  You have to put it into perspective with other shows.  Sure its not flawless, but a LOT of your criticisms are pretty small things.  If you took this mindset to other shows you could easily pick them apart harder than Erased.  If this isnt good you must consider a lot of shows "not good".  It's all compartive.  This show is way better than average from a production standpoint and it's uniqueness.  Perhaps the story isnt that deep or complicated but the process is full of drama and intensity.  And again, this show is way better than many many many shows out there.
  
> I think that there is little thrill in watching how 2 children befriend each other
  
This is probably your most opinionated comment which is fine of course.  I loved the whole concept of this part of the show.  I thought befriending lonely kids to save them in more ways then one to be a great basis for a murder mystery type show.  This criticism has nothing to do with the story and is simply the premise of the show.  Normally I think criticizing the premise of a show is a pretty weak way of criticizing.  For example just because a show has a super generic premise (most school romances) doensn't automatically make it a bad show from a literary viewpoint.
  
>It has very little merits in the writing department and only delivers when it comes the production values, but its very hard for me to completely appreciate said positive aspects, when the story they are supposed to convey is so lackluster and insubstantial. 
  
The writing was great for the most part man.  It had me on the edge of my seat for entire episodes because I just had no idea who was gonna die or what was gonna happen.  The soundtrack really added to the suspense as well.  Lackluster and insubstantial aren't really effective criticisms of the story.  Sure it wasn't super deep or complicated but thats not inherently bad.  Basically we'll just have to disagree on these.
  
>If you are looking for a smart and thrilling story, filled with charismatic characters that also handles its themes and premise to a satisfying degree, then this show will probably not deliver.

It will deliver!  Its very effective at giving the viewer a feeling of suspense throughout entire episodes!  The production quality is top notch and the characters are solid.  Its a unique premise with plenty of drama, and it almost feels like reading a book with the interal dialogue.

>However, despite all the criticism, ERASED is still recommendable for people

Glad to see you tried to find the good, but I think you need to really look at the show with perspective and in the context of other shows.  This show is far above average and you seem to mix up personal dislike with actual criticisms and flaws.
  
As far as a review it was pretty good though.  Most reviews I read here lack specific examples but you seemed to have at least some specifics in here.  Most people just draw conclusions without giving examples of the scenes that made them draw that conclusion.

A review and no score? Bruh comeon you gotta let the crowd know whether to hate you or love you! ^^^^/s


You pretty much summed up a lot of feelings I got for the show; it has some serious problems with character depth, rushed issues such as child abuse, very meh dialogue, and no real sense of a theme or goal until the end when they literally gave a minute of Satoru's monologue about "being a hero and relying on others and taking that first step".

That said I still appreciate the shows production and if you're able to shut down your logic when confronted with those plot holes and inconsistencies, then you're in for a "worth-it" ride.



But this level of review for your first actual attempt? Damn good job bro. If you plan on doing these sort of things in the future I'll look forward to reading them. Finally nice to see someone other than Banjo give out analytical casual reviews.

Just check his MAL, he gave it a 3 lol.

Shit, I'm pretty harsh critic, and it still takes a fair amount for me to give something 3 or worse. Admittedly, I liked Erased, and I'll take it any day over the usual LN battle school harem adaptations, or whatever else happens to be the industry otaku pandering genre of the season. 

This is the result of people spamming 'AOTS' across the sub half way through the show, I guess: a really strong anti-hype train. Even I was pretty irked when I saw those, and it's now my pick for AOTS (not that there was that much competition though, last season would've been a much harder pick).

>> ARTICLE
If this is your first review, it's a hell of a start. You should do write ups for a few other shows too.

You make some excellent points- BokuDake started out strong, but it ended up having a bad case of style-over-substance. There are definitely worse ways to spend four hours, but it's sad to see a show that doesn't live up to its full potential.
>> ARTICLE
What did you think of the time travel element of Tatami Galaxy as compared to Erased?  Of course there's more to both shows than just that aspect, but I ask because it seems like a lot of people who didn't like Erased really love Tatami Galaxy, and I don't understand what makes the time travel any better or more palatable there.

I'd like to echo the top poster when he says you make a lot of assertions and then don't give examples for them. I'm not sure this is a bad thing, since you obviously want to avoid spoilers in a review, but it makes it weird to read and disagree with many of them. Not sure what the solution is here.

I like that you wrote a review without putting Story/Characters/Art/Sound/Animation/Enjoyment in bullet point form. That sort of template always annoyed me. I do like the bulleted list at the end that starts with

| However, despite all the criticism, ERASED is still recommendable for people

But when you put it like that, you should avoid any criticism in the bullet points because it is redundant. It's like you're saying "but remember it's still awful". So change

* who can still be engaged in a show regardless of writing issues as long as the cliffhangers keep
them excited

to something like

* who really love cliffhangers

since you mentioned the writing issues earlier.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like it is like deathnote for short anime, 2/3rds are really great but then main plot point gets more or less resolved and then it just sort of tries to scramble together an ending tying up whatever knots are left.
>> ARTICLE
It was decent show that turned out bad.(both manga and the anime)

**Biggest problem:**(there are many but this is THE biggest one for me)

Failing to explain how his Time Resets/travel works


>ERASED is a show with high ambitions and I give credit exactly for that, but the amount is neglectable

I agree its like the writer gave up or got confused once the Kayo arc finished its a jumbled mess with no true Identity or forced other aspect of other genre's into it and done it poorly if you know what I mean. 
>> ARTICLE
I think most people while watching got too fixated on him trying to save Kayo instead of understanding that he was there to stop the killings from happening in the first place. So to some people it feels like everything else was a jumbled mess. I do believe it was a little rushed and would have been better if the anime was slightly longer with a few other characters that were suspicious. 

My only issue with the show was how easy it was to guess the serial killers identity. There were some pretty blatant clues, now I completely understand if the manga had the same, but they were pretty dominating in a couple of the episodes. I guess it did add a thriller feel to the show, because you would clench up when Satoru got near the killer.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you tbh, I think many people right now are quite blinded and brushing off some aspects of the show and creating headcanons so they can excuse some of the failures of the story

Fact is

1) Revival ability had to be explained so it wouldn't end up being treated like a plot device everytime it was used after the first episode

2) Mystery was too predictable, thriller wasn't very good after Kayo's arc was over

3) Main villain was weak, manga did a better job with him but even there he was still weak

4) Plot was rushed, confrontation in the roof in the last episode was quite cringe worthy and because they cut Airi scenes, her last appearance just worked as another plot device so the MC could end up with someone

5) Convenience plays a really big deal in the story as a whole and when the watcher can indentify the convenience, it isn't good for the anime

And I also completely agree about your statement regarding Satoru

>Satoru Fujinuma, is a struggling manga author and lives a rather unfulfilled life as a pizza delivery boy. Hes rather dull and the latter doesnt mean anything in the long run, but the thing that disappoints the most, is how the show also misses out an a great opportunity to make him more interesting by exploring his past, while simultaneously progressing the plot. The crucial point is, even though we get to see his childhood, we dont witness how said time is responsible for what he will become as an adult. Why is he unable to express himself properly? Why is his mindset so negative? The writer should have included aspects that make Satoru, Satoru and not some generic protagonist with one task. Most events in the past time frame are either completely new or dont have much impact on his adulthood, making this also an evidence for the poor execution of the time travel premise. He also makes some unreasonable decisions during his quest to save his mother and is overall a rather weak protagonist.

It was a nice review, especially for your first one, keep up with the good work!

>> ARTICLE
>I think that there is little thrill in watching how 2 children befriend each other

I strongly disagree. 

If the kids (with the exception of Satoru) are being written as kids, doing kid things, being naive like other kids, etc, then you have to analyze them as kids. One of the best examples of that was when [spoilers just in case](/s "Satoru recognized the torturing tools while the other kids didn't. Maybe Ken'ya did noticed it a little bit after, but I am not sure on that one.")

It is true that their relationship has very little thrill, but that is because the thriller aspect comes from other perspectives that are not the kids. [Anime Show Title](/s "Shinsekai Yori") does something really similar. You watch the whole thing from the perspective of kids and all the thrilling effects are caused by the outside world and by the adults. 

Paying attention to two kids becoming friends and doing friend things is just one, if not the wrong one, perspective to be watching the show. In fact, because of the future events and Satoru's inner monologues, you should've been questioning yourself who is the murderer, why he did it, why was Kayo being beaten up and all those things that **surround** the characters. 

Why are they becoming friends is more important than why they are doing the things that they are doing. Things like the birthday party or the museum episode are there just to show us that Satoru is putting effort into it. If you don't remind yourself of Satoru's intentions, then all these episodes will be useless for you.

Now, I do think the show is way too simple. The story is just a simple sequence of murderers, it has very few characters and only 3 or 4 different perspectives to look at (satoru, the other kids, parents, the murderer).

I do agree that you won't find anything super smart/thrilling with a bunch of characters and lots of mystery but for its simplicity, and for the execution of said simplicity, I think it is a very good show.

I don't think a show needs to be complex for it to be good. Simple shows allow for easier execution and these can be way better than a complex show with bad execution, which is often described as "pretentious". 

I'll leave a question for anyone to think about this:

Was the execution of the show good for what the show is? I personally think it is above average and I'll probably be an 8/10 on my MAL.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know man, all I can say is that I disagree with you.

You say that it fails as a time travel story, but then how do you define a time travel story? I don't see a need to. Then you also say the show hardly explores his mental issues and psychological pressure he had to endure, but I didn't find that aspect lacking at all. 

But the biggest part I disagreed with is this
>If you are looking for a smart and thrilling story, filled with charismatic characters that also handles its themes and premise to a satisfying degree, then this show will probably not deliver.

I, for one don't need charismatic characters everywhere in a psychological thriller/mystery, whatever you want to define the story as. The show actually explored its intended theme quite well, if anything it was to more than just a satisfying degree.

Just said it because he says sooo many of the exact same thing Snob says in his videos on erased. Also if he were to approach every anime like the way he approaches erased he would hate every anime.

Edit: plus I've seen them in the comments of ThatAnimeSnob videos so they definitely are influenced by him

How is he nitpicking? Erased has only 12 episodes, and its narrative is pretty shallow. There's not that many things in it, which is why a good critique of it is going to inevitably touch on its smaller elements.
>> ARTICLE
There's already been people in this thread that have responded to their points and showed why this is nitpicking of the most mundane things that happen in anime all the time. This is a classic case of a slightly above average show being rated as one of the best ever and angry people countering and nitpicking it to death like it's one of the worst shows ever.
>> ARTICLE
>but this nitpicking shit is ridiculous.

It isn't nitpicking, rather what I see the most is people brushing off failures of the show in order to justify their high rating of the series


>> ARTICLE
> Not only that, the show also breaks a previously established rule by sending the protagonist several years back instead of the usual few minutes. Even though one could claim that it doesnt break anything, since there wasnt any clear rules in the first place (as we are only taking Satorus experience into account), this is a very weak argument as it doesnt change the fact that the ability in question shows neither consistency nor internal logic it follows.

Revival takes you back in time to the point where you have the ability to change a tragic event. In this case, in order for Satoru to have made a change, he had to go back to his childhood. So yes, there are rules, logic, and internal consistency. It's just that 'a few minutes and a few minutes only' was never one of the rules (and never was it presented as such).
>> ARTICLE
At one point you said

> 321th

when talking about battle/harem animes or something like that. Anyway, I have to disagree on one point which is that Revival was inconsistent. I believe the execution of the plot was very well done. While you could argue that his revival when making eye-contact with Yashiro around episode six was a bit cheesy, it could be argued that the Revival was going to occur whether or not he begged an invisible entity to do it. I enjoy your criticisms, but this mostly feels hipster-y. Like, "I can hate on a popular anime." Themes were prevalent, as well as immense figurative language and intricacies between characters, interactions, and side-stories (Grim Reaper, Yashiro's Pets). I'll allow you to have an opinion, but for anyone who is deciding whether or not to watch it, **I recommend Erased** despite this review.

Hopefully you read this. Thank you for your opinion of the show! (And that sounds sarcastic but this perspective was a really interesting read.)

I just wrote some random number, thus easily making the "321th" mistake.

This was a great review. When I record my review on my Youtube channel I will probably be a lot less kind to the show just because I thought it was awful. However, I am glad that there are people who can see this show as the mess that it is.

I agree that it's not the best show (I skimmed because I'm only 6 episodes in), and I think I kind of agree with it?

It's not the best show ever, but it's pretty good. A lot of people think it's the best show in a long time and I don't know if I'd agree with that.

I think the part, 

>who can still be engaged in a show regardless of writing issues as long as the cliffhangers keep
them excited

is kind of rude, it makes it sound like you are only saying it's a show for dumb people/people who only live on hype.

Nice review though. What is your favorite show this season? I'm trying to catch up on Iron Blooded Orphans right now (7 episodes in).

a little bit out of topic, just want to point out something, erased is not never really been planned to be a mystery show [here](https://www.facebook.com/Crunchyroll/videos/10153680454079340/) are the video where the director interviewed.

imho your review are good also i'm glad you did not make the title "[Insert anime title here] not as good as /r/Anime think it is".
>> ARTICLE
I can't argue over any points from the anime itself - although I agree with basically everything you wrote, I don't want to praise you just because I share your opinion.

But since I tend to write unnecessarily lengthy paragraphs about things I don't like, I believe that if you tried you could have shorten your review, keeping all (or almost all) of the content. And that it would make your review slightly better. 
>> ARTICLE
> I believe that if you tried you could have shorten your review, keeping all (or almost all) of the content.

I would say definitely nail this to the fore head if said person wants be a reviewer. It's definitely nice to explain things and give depth to said thoughts, but they have to keep in mind their audience does have to read over it, and if overly long, major review content can be lost, it can fall into the trap of becoming repetitive or sounding pretentious, and honestly the worst part of is that the reader can become easily bored. For most newspaper/magazine reviews (from what I personally learned, so could be different), the average reader is willing to go for about 650 words before putting it down becoming uninterested; and from my own experience of writing reviews under that word limit, it's hard as there may be much I want to share but also it forced me to be more focused than simply an overly long rant/praise. I had to pick what I wanted to explain longer, what could be emitted (so like minor Nitpicks I noticed), and really more thoughtful about what I have to say. 

Now obviously the review /u/BBallHunter wrote I wouldn't say should be under 650 as it certainly is more of an analysis, but it definitely wouldn't hurt to to try to goal himself down to be more focused and shorten the review for his readers. 
>> ARTICLE
It was a good show with some problems. I sure had a few with some of the events that happened and the way it all turned out. But it was definitely good. Not great, but good. A solid 7.5/10. 

It had a god enough start that made you interested enough to keep watching, whether or not you knew it would be good or not. I probably rate it higher since compared to most typical one off animes its a step above and I liked it more based on that than the actual anime itself. Or im just glad that [Spoiler](/s "Satoru winds up with Airi in the end") which is what I wanted to happen in the first place. 

I was disappointed with how things turned out towards the end and it was beyond obvious who the killer was. But at least it got you interested enough to see how it all plays out and is definitely better than the typical 'meh' animes out there.


>> ARTICLE
You managed to put out a worse review than Digibro and his was already pretty shit. You  complain about monologues when the story is literally his flashback and your point about the time travel not being explained is just stupid. It's intended that the origin of the ability is not necessary to know similar to how in Parasyte it's not primarly about where the aliens came from. There are so many points you made where I thought "damn you're serious mate did you even watch the show?" but those 2 stood out the most and it's 4am. Good night.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting post, thanks. 

> Firstly, the Japanese voice acting is quite solid, since there are no complaints here. 

Actually, I didn't like Satoru's VAs, especially his childhood voice. His adult voice was *okay*, and so was Kenya's adult voice, but they were not as great as the other supporting chars VA works. Satoru's mother was especially outstanding, and Kayo was good too.  

I agree with you on Satoru's character building part. Other than that, their *hideout* being shockingly lamer than what I had expected, some cheesy and too-preachy dialogues (like filling a hole in my heart, what believing means, etc)  and Satoru's VAs were what I disliked and a few more minor things I didn't like, but overall I enjoyed the show a lot, and I'm used to anime/manga grammar enough to appreciate an entertainment show as an entertainment and ignore certain flaws. 
>> ARTICLE
That's interesting. One of my favorite parts of the show, especially in the first episode, was Adult Satoru's VA. He sounded so different, and passionless. I thought he did a great job. By the end, Satoru's adult self is different from what we see initially not only in tone, but in the way he looks as well. I thought that aspect was particularly well done.
>> ARTICLE
I understand a lot of people liked the result, but that does not change how I got my immersion broken every time Satoru spoke (especially the childhood Satoru, and the last convo between adult Satoru + Kenya), although I could still ignore such aspects and enjoy the show overall. I just felt that I would have loved it more with different VAs doing those roles, especially when other supporting chars VA works were great. Evaluation can vary, of course, and I respect yours too. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, they're covering the back story! Still curious on how they're going to wrapped up the story in the anime.

I can see them try to package in a new episode for the disc release if they have to. That could work.

It could work for [Manga Spoiler](/n "Sensei backstory, or Satoru's full recovery")but they're pretty essential build-up to the finale. If they're going to release it only on disc, it would rustles some jimmies.

The only choices is to condensed it, scrapped some stuff, or make the finale an hour long.

Episode 1 was pretty good at telling the important part of the story, even if it scrapped some of interesting side story of Satoru's past.

I still have faith that they could ended it in an awesome finale, though i doubt that it would be satisfying for us manga reader to see a lot of character-focused chapters to be scrapped.

I feel like it will be rushed, but they could probably do it like this:

[Boku Dake ga Inai Machi Manga](/n "Half of this episode for the backstory, and the second half is a rushed recovery up to the reveal that the killer is still after Satoru. 12 is a relatively faithful adaptation of the last few chapters of the manga, with an ending overlay onto Satoru meeting Airi, again.")

I feel like if there was just one more episode or if the last episode was a double feature, it'd be close to perfect for the ending. =(

It's probably going to be a really rushed ending or an anime original interpretation... There's still almost 1/3 of the manga left for just two episodes.

Not really... They got like what, 11-12 chapters left?

They do ~3 chapters per episode usually, which just means they'll have to do extra cuts and a somewhat faster pace, but putting everything into 2 episodes is definitely possible, especially if they save time by omitting the OP\ED and such.

12 out of 43 chapters, a little less than 1/3.  The pacing and direction's been great so far, hopefully it doesn't get too condensed and abridged by going double speed with the final chapters.

Notice the string on Satoru's head when he's in the car. Looks like the anime will cover the story of why the strings appear above the targets' heads. To be expected since they showed the strings for Sachicko and Airi before their respective attempted murders way back too.

Yes, even if it won't be 1 hour long.

There are like 11 chapters left, with the previous episodes doing on average about 3.2 per episode.

It's not "just a filter over a screenshot". I also put time into multiple color alterations and other editing subtleties. My goal was to make a nice looking 1080p wallpaper for people to use, and I put a decent amount of effort into making that happen. I'd like for you to appreciate it for what it is rather than look down on it for the simple fact that it isn't an actual oil painting.

So you should of typed that this what a photo manipulation not an "oil painting". Then you wouldn't be so upset when people have to point out to others that you didn't literally take out a canvas and brush to paint it by hand.

Yeah, I didn't think that through. I should have put it as a photo manipulation instead. My bad.

I had been wondering what this visual was supposed to represent and if it happens in the show or not. This part you noticed makes me think that maybe one of the times that he goes all the way back that he will just up and lock themselves in a room to protect her. Possibly after trying dozens of times and is super desperate.

Though I'm curious as to why Pizza girl is there, could be just because it's a key visual, but why not also have Satoru's mother there to represent all 3 girls? Unless the hand is the mother, but that'd be weird.

Thanks for pointing it out!

Edit: Interestingly, I had noticed the hand and footprints on the boxes previously, but not the actual hand.

Edit2: Few other things I noticed, they have a blanket so that implies that they mean to stay there for awhile. There's an oil lamp instead of a regular lamp or ceiling light, not sure what that says, but it's something. Whatever they're sitting on looks like a kind of metal or concrete, you can see bolts on it at the base, there's that and wood flooring in the same place, so that paints a weird location. And lastly, he has the gloves that she made for him, so this would be after the time that Kaya was murdered in the first revival.
>> ARTICLE
I thought that the two of them would be abducted together, but after the first few episodes I don't know anymore.

Maybe she IS there and that is HER hand in the corner outside... An ominous foreshadow.

I always assumed that it was that and that at some point they'd stay the night there to be safe from the murderer/abuse.

Also: rope and a huge roll of tape. 
>> ARTICLE
Just noticed that. Duct tape as well
>> ARTICLE
i thinnk you mean ski mask as well
>> ARTICLE
The gloves are the biggest thing. I noticed that as well. 

I really doubt this is that shed that Hinazuki gets shoved into at times. Plus it wouldn't be a good place to hide, unless something has happened to her parents.

They also have their school bags, and Satoru is obviously expecting something to happen at any time. 

Edit: [skii mask, tape, rope.](http://i.imgur.com/d8hV2UK.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Good point with Satoru, he looks really alert, while Hinazuki is sleeping.

And I agree with it not being the shed, my mind kept going to that, but it seems really unlikely.

Edit: Just took a look at the shed in the show and it's too small and it doesn't have wood flooring and doesn't seem to have a window.
>> ARTICLE
So that rules the shed out for sure. 

I'm still searching for something super significant to pop up. No luck yet. Especially with the director of the show, he's gonna have hidden meaning and depth within just the position of things and lighting. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, the suspicious combination of items you mentioned along with the footprints on the cardboard all seem *very* intentional.
>> ARTICLE

Yeah, so far almost every scene in the opening has happened. They don't show many things just to show them; those scenes will happen.

I'd imagine it's the hideout as that's the only place that would make sense that we've seen or heard of yet, can't be sure though. For all we know this is just supposed to symbolize something that we haven't seen(or noticed) yet and isn't meant to be taken literally

There's probably a psychological reason for not seeing the girl. Like previously smaller pictures, or the fact that our eyes are drawn towards the center and the lighting.

Airi wasn't born yet, sadly. The child parts of the story happen 18 years before the adult parts, whereas Katagiri is only 17.

Well, we at least have some explanation now, but not a whole lot.
>> ARTICLE
That's really minor just look at the opening and the killer is there HIS FACE IS SHOWN CRYSTAL CLEAR. I think that's a big problem.
>> ARTICLE
It isn't. It's not supposed to be a mystery who the killer is, that's why they show us. They want us to focus on other things rather than point fingers and going on crazy theories about who the murderer is. The director of this show does everything for a reason. 
>> ARTICLE
You realise that all the tension of a mistery series disspears when u know who the killer is right?By episode 5 anyone should have figured it out already just with the opening alone.
>> ARTICLE
well some people skip the openings exactly for that. And openings shouldnt even qualify as a clue.

And it doesnt matter if they show the face of the killer, they show the face of every important character of course hes gonna be there
>> ARTICLE
stahppppp you make me feel dumb lol..... ive been thinking the killer is him from the future the whole time lol 
>> ARTICLE
Thought that once too haha
>> ARTICLE
That's just the thing, though. It ISNT a mystery anime, and who the killer is isn't the primary focus of the show. It's a psychological drama. 

I 100% agree with you on your statement concerning mystery anime, just not when considering Erased. 

If your focus has been who the killer was, then you've been missing other crucial themes. The writer chose to make the killer obvious as to get the audience to focus on other things since the killer's identity isn't the most prevalent thing. 
>> ARTICLE
You are wrong since in the manga the killer was not that obvious and in the manga there were no Opening who would show the killer. The one's who made it this way were A1-Pictures. Also there is no psychological deep stuff so far only a typical self insert protagonist with "I said that out loud" gimmick to make him look interesting and a useless conflict since he can reset time as much as he wants with no draw back or consequences. I praise the foreshadowing and directing of the show since they are very good but the actual content is actually average or even bellow that since not only the killer shown in the opening makes all the tension non existent but also the fact that his time resets have no drawbacks or consequences and will never be explained. Compared to the other Trash LN adaptations that A1 does this show is indeed good but it's neither a good mistery (ex Monster) nor a good psychological series( Welcome to the N.H.K,Ergo Proxy,Technolyze).

>> ARTICLE
I'm simply going to say that an anime adaption is akin to the production of a play. A director may or may not choose to perform a play with the same them or genre as was originally intended by the playwrite. 

The mangaka of Erased may have chosen to place an importance on the hiding of the killer's identity, he may have not. But in the //adaptation// by A1, they chose to focus on other things like the battle between Satoru, time, and the killer. By revealing the killer's identity they can focus on the psychological fighting between our protagonist and antagonist. If they were fighting with fists and ninjitsu, the show would be an action/battle anime. But they're fighting with their minds. 

This is a full adaptation, and not mainly some promotion like other battle anime. There are going to be stylistic differences between anime and manga. If you're watching this show as a mystery, you're sorely missing out. The main goal of the show is not to figure out who the killer is. If it were a mystery, that would be the case. Just because you know who the killer is doesn't mean you know what's going to happen. 
>> ARTICLE
I read the manga so i know and i read the manga just because i was interested in the anime at first and i know most of the times Source Material is better.(And if it's A1-Pictures it's clearly better) So far the anime is subpar to the manga missing alot on characterization thus resulting in plot device characters and shallow motives.
>> ARTICLE
In the manga the killer isn't as obvious, but it's still easy to put it together.

> there is no psychological deep stuff so far only a typical self insert protagonist with "I said that out loud" gimmick to make him look interesting 

If you aren't going to pay enough attention to the show to see its value, just stop watching because its too good to be sullied by such shallow generalizations.
>> ARTICLE
You know i'm actually doing something good for the character right? Or you want me to say he is a pedophile trying to save an 11 yr old girl with time travels, risking his life when they didn't even talk before? Or should i say about the fact that he care's more for her than Sugita Hiromi his childhood friend.(In the manga Hiromi was the reason of his frustration and also in the anime he didn't even have a face reaction to the fact that he died aswell in those serial murders.) If you find deep stuff in the show please list them here. Just list me what you have learned from the show and what do you find realistic in a show with a 29 yr old pedophile,one dimensional evil parents and almost generic bland protagonist.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not doing your cognition for you, just making you aware that your perspective is a lost cause. 

You didn't even remember that he did reach out to Hinazuki in the original timeline, but it was a part of the memories his mother tried to make him forget. Since Hinazuki is the first one that is killed, it makes her the primary concern. Once she's safe he can focus on the other victims, it's called prioritizing.

If you read the manga it should be obvious that your raging claims of pedophilia are moronic, as he just wants her to be happy and nothing really happens between them.

> You know i'm actually doing something good for the character right?

wtf kind of high horse are you riding? 
>> ARTICLE
So you actually admit that in the anime he is a pedophile, good then i proved my point. Also i didn't say why didn't he follow Hiromi but why he didn't even care and why the anime showed him caring only about Hinazuki just because she is supposed to be a main character. And still i'm not a lost cause i will change my mind if you tell me about the realism and maturity in the show if you can't then you are a lost cause defending a show just because of fanboysm,hype or w/e.
>> ARTICLE
> So you actually admit that in the anime he is a pedophile, good then i proved my point.

...You're in your own little world man. My words aren't reaching you now, so why would I spend over an hour deconstructing the show just to have it fall on deaf ears?

There's no additional gimmick, it's just high quality writing.  It's hard to give examples because spoilers.  In terms of tone, the closest thing I can think of is Monster, so maybe just watch that and imagine A-1 animating it.
>> ARTICLE
An interesting and complex murder mystery, good art and pacing, frankly exceptional control of tone, 3 dimensional characters with unique personalities and motivations, inventive usage of time travel.

I could go on, but take your pick from the above.

>> ARTICLE
That sounds much more promising.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah the summary on Batoto isn't very useful. On the other hand I feel going into the manga 'blind' makes it's impact even better.
>> ARTICLE
Certainly in some cases, but I feel that this ends up being more true for myself when it comes to anime than any form of literature.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting, any particular reason why?
>> ARTICLE
I simply find it easier to "lose myself" in reading, keeping me from actively attempting to predict the author's next move. Anime tends to be adaptations of the more generic manga and light novels out there, making it extremely simple in some cases to predict an entire sequence. In rare cases, I've even managed to predict lines word for word.
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely understand that. It takes a rare anime to surprise me these days.

The manga is getting REALLY intense atm. For everyone having doubts about this being good, I can guarentee you, this Anime won't let you down. It's getting better every chapter.

My god, that preview blew me away. This totally reminds of Shigatsu (not the anime itself, but the fact that it's an overlooked manga out of nowhere that is very well rated by some and it's A1-Pictures who will actually try again to do something amazing judging from the preview). I'm very hype for this.

Since the manga is ongoing, any idea on how many of the volumes are they adapting?
>> ARTICLE
IMO the manga doesn't really have a good place to end without leaving anime watcher with a massive case of blue balls.

 but if i were to choose a place for it to end it would be the beginning of volume 6, since its closes the arc that's been going since the first chapter and begins a new one.

>> ARTICLE
I hope they follow it like that then instead of giving it an anime only ending and cutting off chances of us getting a Season 2 in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Trying to explain why means spoiling one of the more important plot points but frankly I don't think there's a anime only ending that could do it justice.

Doesnt really help that the manga is currently at chapter 40 and the best place for the anime to end the first arc without leaving the arc unfinished  would be around 30 to 33. A second season will not be happening for a while, if it does happen anyways.

>> ARTICLE
I dont know why A1 gets so much shit, they adapt the source material well. All the hate on SAO should be directed towards the source content and not the studio animating it, since they did a spot on job. Also yeah their Shigatsu adaptation was absolutely brilliant. Amazing OP/ED and an amazing soundtrack

Noitamina's only entry this season.

I'm not sure if I'm out of the loop wrt to Funimation or something, or whether you are genuinely asking:  
   
It's meant to mean that each episode is made available with subs within a few hours after it has come out in Japan. Although in the odd case some liberties with the term have been taken, where they have simply been streaming the episodes of a show from an airing series but often quite a lot later then from Japan.

Anything besides action or ecchi was pretty dull this season. Not a single good romance anime, comedy was also pretty meh. Gochumon was mor but it was niche moe, nothing like past summer season. You can see as the rating for the season is around 7, it was pretty average.
>> ARTICLE
Average would be 5 :P

But anyway, again, depends what you like.  Rakudai had a pretty enjoyable romance for a battle-shounen.  It wasn't super deep or anything, but it was somewhat satisfying in progression.

Like I said, it really depends on what you're interested in ;P
>> ARTICLE
you have to remember though that a lot of /r/anime will just give a show a 7 at the end because it was okay. 7 is like most peoples default mark.

That is illogical.

It's not illogical, it's using a different rating system than you.

Illogical would be to watch a show that you consider 5 to the end. You're not enjoying it to the fullest, you could be watching something better or, worse case scenario, you could be wasting your time with something else that you enjoy. Your time is more precious than a grade 5 anime.

> Average would be 5 :P

you must be new around here, most dumbly apply academic grading to anime so 7 is just "ok" and ignore over half the scale
>> ARTICLE
Lol, my mistake, I was trying to be logical ;P
>> ARTICLE
5 should only be the average if you literally watch every single show. If you only pick shows you think you'll actually enjoy, an average of 7 seems pretty normal. Assuming you know what you like, most of the 1-4s you would give in a season will never happen, since you'd have never watched a single episode.

 Anime viewership is not as skewed towards being a predominantly "male" activity as let's say, gaming. 

I mean actual anime viewership is almost a 50/50 split between the genders in Japan.


I guess this is more a reddit thing, than an anime thing? I can't see any other reason why.

Reddit is generally a male-dominated site; /r/anime may be a bit more skewed than most, but it's not completely crazy.

Some of the women that venture onto /r/anime leave/don't participate because it's *already* quite unequal on the gender ratio. For example, best girl threads, sexy fanart of female characters, and jokes about fanservice are all fairly popular, yet none of those hold much interest for us. In fact, I unsubscribed during the best girl competitions.

/r/Animewallpaper holds a similar issue: some of the background art is great, but 99% of what they post/upvote is half-naked anime girls. Quickest I've ever lost interest in a sub.
>> ARTICLE
I mean if that makes me lose interest while I'm a guy I cant even fathom how bad its for girls, in the its not really the media fault when there are discrepancies like this but mostly the community fault for walling themselves in
>> ARTICLE
You pretty much hit the nail on the head for why I only check the subreddit out very occasionally. But then again, I first encountered it during the best girl competitions so my first impression was pretty... low. 

Also it seems like the more popular anime on the sub are the more fanservicey ones, so even though I want to be more active there is little opportunity. 

I'll try and take /u/Atario 's advice and try to be more active on the stuff that's a bit more woman-friendly - those threads will never get off the ground if people don't participate. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm gay and even I can only take so much waifu threads. There's kind of a void of appeal in anime when it comes to straight western women. Not that anime is or should be primarily about sexuality or sexual fan service, but when the content becomes overwhelmed with fawning over naked anime chicks, it doesn't really appeal to women at all. Like I said, even being a lesbian I get tired of looking at naked anime chicks.

I think it's a little insane that it's possible to even have a goddamn "Top Bathing Scenes of 20XX" thread every year.

It's fun for people. Don't act like you're above someone else because they enjoy a good old fashioned cheesecake shot and you don't.

There's a difference between the occasional cheesecake shot and non-stop cheesecake *every fucking day on this sub*, half of it being Loli's.  I don't eat cheesecake every single day either, 'cause I'd turn into a whale if I did ;P

The rampant over-sexualization is like half the reason it took me so long to get into anime, it was a huge turn-off.  I've learned to ignore it more lately, but here we are.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't have anything to do with being "a reasonable adult." Or lolis for that matter (unless there are lolis in that thread I haven't read). I just resent the notion that apparently I'm either less than reasonable or less than adult because I enjoy a bit of T&A on the down low.

I mean, I get your point. I'm just not a fan of the phrasing, I guess.
>> ARTICLE
You missed the point of my comment.  A sign of maturity is being able to limit yourself from over-indulging, that's kind of one of the basic things that separates an adult from a child.  Being able to postpone self-gratification.

You wouldn't eat cheesecake every single day because you know it wouldn't be good for you.

/r/anime does this *all the time*.  That's the point, it's childish from an outside perspective.  Like the mods have already stated in this sub ad nauseam, moderating it is like moderating a bunch of children that don't know when to go home with their toys.

No one begrudges you for enjoying T&A, we all enjoy it, but people get tired of low-effort pandering posts like this constantly.  The Loli's popping up in half of them is just the icing on the cake, or more aptly, dumping gasoline on the fire.

I'm a straight male and I can't stand the waifu threads... You're not alone.

The bathing scene thread is mostly just a joke, but the fact that it's possible says a lot about what kind of anime is being made every season. There's a lot of fanservice, but that's unfortunately how you sell your product unless it stands out.

There is an entire wiki dedicated to anime bathing scenes. I'm honestly not sure how serious this guy takes himself.
>> ARTICLE
there's entire sites dedicated to all sorts of other weird shit. however, i find it kind of sad that a generic sub for this medium is filled mostly with waifu worship. that'd be like a subreddit like movies only posting naked actresses and nude scenes. they'd tell those people to go off and make their own subreddit because there's more to movies than worshiping "irl film waifus."
>> ARTICLE
That's a fair stance, and I think it mostly comes down to how young this subreddit skews.  I'm 36, and I dock points for excessive fan service unless the show really does something interesting with it (e.g. Kill la Kill or Shimoneta).
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, I'm pretty sure you could make a "top bathing scenes" list for live action movies, and probably even television too.  You could probably also make a list for a lot of different fetishes from any given medium that isn't targeted to a very narrow audience(e.g. most western cartoons being targeted at children and teenagers).

[Demographic-Seinen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Friends_%28manga%29)

Just because the demographic is seinen doesn't mean that it's male pandering...
>> ARTICLE
Isn't it like the definition of seinen? To do things that man would appreaciate in more quantity than what females would?
>> ARTICLE
Not really. Seinen just means it was published in a magazine that is labeled "seinen." A manga that attempted to be open to all audiences would still have to pick a magazine. Since the magazines all (mostly all?) have a demographic tag, nearly all published manga will have a demographic associated with it. 

I'm not going to comment on Girl Friends specifically though.

Edited for clarity.

The author herself is a women. Like I said, there's definitely still some pandering, but overall I found it to be a touching story. Then again, I'm a guy... soo...

Ill have you know I graduated top of my kurasu in chuunibyou, and Ive been winkingly oblivious to numerous secret raids on my pantsu, and I have over 300 confirmed fanboy nosebleeds. I am trained in cosplay fanservice and Im the most popular character on the entire show. You are nothing to me but just another baka hentai. I will wipe you the uguu out with fanservice the likes of which has never been seen before in this time slot, mark my ra-ri-ru-re-ro words.

The character design changes are definitely to appeal to otaku, and hell the entire series is JSDF propoganda, but it's really not fair to say that the entire substance of the show is otaku pandering. There's some good stuff about military and politics in there (especially later on in the manga/second season). The author was ex-JSDF and the story is based on some old fiction he wrote that he passed around to his friends. It's honestly not as bad as you make it out to be.

I can understand if the show just simply wasn't your thing, but don't exaggerate it's bad points just to be a contrarian.

Btw, you're part of the /r/anime community, too. If you care about anime enough to argue about it on the internet with strangers, you're just as much an otaku as the rest of us ;)

This is an insult. It's plainly obvious to see, so don't say 'I didn't insult anyone' because you clearly did.

In my original comment I never insulted anyone. I was legitimately wondering why the community enjoyed the series, because I only saw it as otaku bait essentially. This is not an insult not is it an implied insult. Please learn to read.

I made two simple questions. You could say I have an obligation to ask that when I read a comment like yours.

>I was legitimately wondering why the community enjoyed the series, because I only saw it as otaku bait essentially.

You think you deserve a pat on your back for not eating up "otaku bait"? That's sad, because some of the best anime in the industry is made of pure "otaku bait".
>> ARTICLE
Yes you did...those two questions were both rhetorical and insulting. 

I never said that otaku pandering is always bad. But when a series only offers otaku bait and nothing more, I lose nearly all respect for it. In the end it becomes a marketing ploy to draw Otaku's in who don't care if the series is any good at all (in this case, Gate isn't very good).
>> ARTICLE
>You're right. How silly I was to think r/anime wouldn't eat that otaku bait up :/Rhetorical and insulting ey? Look at Mr. Hypocrite here trying to act all high and mighty. BTW, calling something pandering without describing why is the best way to discredit your opinion.

oh no. Don't be critical about an anime many people like. Yes we know that, don't deviates from the masses. Must be a fucking elitist if he deviates from the hivemind. So if I don't like an Anime you like, for example Hyouka does it  mean I am attacking you? Apparently yes.

No man, but when you say otaku pandering you're automatically syaing people who watch it are the stereotypically otaku. You could say that the characters are boring, the art is weird, the plot is uninteresting, but instead you say "this show sucks brcause it tries to appease to a certain demographic!" Duh, let me tell you one thing: every show does that. So it's not insulting to the show. But saying the demographic are otaku you're maiing fun of people who watch it because of the stereotype.

Exactly, it's basically a mixture of choose your own fantasy world waifu mixed with Nationalist propaganda. The main character is a complete self insert who gets everything he ever wanted in his otaku life, so the audience can vicariously experience that too. 

I wonder if r/anime will attack me again for insulting their beloved series.. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I'm pretty sure this is a accepted fact even by the fans of the show.  I know it was a point of discussion in the episode threads.

It's just that it's possible for people to enjoy a show for reasons other than the author intended.  See Grave of the Fireflies or Gundam.

Welcome to America.

No, seriously, welcome to the USA. I have a friend on my FB that only just finished basic training for the Army. He hasn't deployed, he probably won't, and he's certainly not seen action yet.

He was going to an ATM and a random lady thanked him for his service and paid for his gas. 

As an American, I'm almost completely desensitized to this. Besides that, all nations talk themselves up if you give them enough chances, I just can't find it in me to look down at a show for doing it. 

I mean shit man, Japan's history books are empirical as hell(See, here's all the awful shit we've done. No excuses). This show is trying to drive nationalism in a country that from what I've looked into, doesn't really have many patriots to it's name.  


>> ARTICLE
Because it is fun?  Is that such a foreign idea to you?

Every kid I know of at some point asked themselves "what would happen if I went back in time with modern weapons?"

The concept is just really primal to a lot of people, and therefore interesting to a lot of people.  Then throw in the Apocalypse Now references, the super-pretty artwork, 20mm cannons going BRRRRRRRRTTTTTT, a sense of nationalist justice (which Americans are known to love), some fan-service girls, and the occasional thoughtful message, and you've got yourself a winner.

And it really isn't otaku pandering per say.  It has some, to be sure, but the whole show panders more to basic human instinct/urges than it does otaku's specifically.

Next season looks like it'll get a bit more dark and interesting, and it remains to be seen how they handle that.  Not *every* show has to be an impressive thought-piece that provides some in-depth commentary on society though.
>> ARTICLE
>Every kid I know of at some point asked themselves "what would happen if I went back in time with modern weapons?"

Honestly, this is where the show mainly disappointed me to the point where I dropped it (and why I don't see why people love it). I didn't even want a show that had deep, thought provoking themes. I just wanted to see medieval armies get BTFO by a modern military and the resulting political conflicts that would arise.

Around the time I dropped it (like episode 7 or 8 or something) it seemed less about that and more about pandering the waifus.

...I thought there was a more even ratio than that (of course, I'm sure that there's plenty of people who saw the survey but didn't bother taking part in it). 

Well, I'm glad to see Dimension W in the top ten most popular anime list, even if it's only at eight (there's that number again). I think it was the only one I put down a 5 for in terms of excitement. I mean, I was so intrigued by the [first PV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O603CtJNapI) that I gave in and read the manga and let me just say, holy shit, it's going to be awesome (though unfortunately it'll probably need an anime original ending). 

Still, I love me a good sci-fi, and Dimension W's manga, though only at 24 chapters, looks like it's shaping up to be a damn fine one. 

**Edit** - I'm interested in the other shows to varying degrees. Some like ERASED (Boku dake ga Inai Machi), Ajin, and Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu I'm quite interested in, and then there are others like Divine Gate, Active Raid, Grimgar Bubuki  Buranki, and Dagashi Kashi I'm cautiously optimistic about on varying levels (well, with Divine Gate it's more like a "I'll check it out because the premise looks vaguely promising, but since this is a video game adaptation I'm reserving judgment and won't get my hopes too high up). And maybe Luck & Logic. 

I'll probably check out the first (couple of) episodes of some of the other shows, like Haruchika and maayyyybe Prince of Stride. 

And of course, there are the shows I'll watch for the hell of it like Sushi Police and Sekkou Boys. And the sequel seasons.

I wish there were more female anime fans, if even a horny guy like me gets tired of all the ecchi and harem shows then you know there is a problem.
>> ARTICLE
I think there's a lot of female anime fans but as people stated before they might not be on reddit. I think a lot of them are on tumblr. 
>> ARTICLE
Hi, female being here. I can confirm that Tumblr is a spawn of female anime fanatics, they're more into the artistic & creating beauts ass GIFs side rather than discussing / criticising episodes from what I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Well, as both a woman and someone who's familiar with tumblr, I'd say that's a bit of a huge generalization (but you knew that already)-I've seen female anime fans on Tumblr produce some jawdropping fanart and tons of high quality gifs and also write out some pretty thoughtful analyses. 

However, I also do kind of agree with you on some level, but honestly I think it depends on the fandom and at least a good chunk of the explanation has got to be the difference between Reddit and Tumblr's formatting. 

For instance, I am pretty familiar with the Baccano! fandom on Tumblr, where there is a lot of analyzation and discussion of the series - which I think is helped by the fact that the active Baccano! Tumblr community is small and made up of devoted fans. 

And Tumblr's formatting makes it much harder for there to be a big community discussion of the show or of airing episodes--you can have back and forth reblogs, but it's not the same experience you'll get on Reddit, which I think accounts for a lot of why Tumblr is seen as (with good reason) very art/graphics-oriented. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, Tumblr's site design is more suitable for graphics, and less likely for discussion especially with the recent text post update. And yeah I gotta love Tumblr for their analysis too (like with Tokyo Ghoul:re, like man, pretty good stuff right there).

But when there's long posts, it's usually when the user gets asked something about the anime / manga and then bam paragraphs of text that I would be actually be willing to read because it's actually decent (e.g. several OP, JJBA, Gintama blogs I follow have written a lot that could fill up Reddit discussions tbh)
>> ARTICLE
There are plenty of women who are anime fans; just not on Reddit, I guess--or, perhaps, not enough women who regularly and actively participate in in this subreddit (I mean, we have over 300,000 subscribers here, but there's usually only roughly between 1500 - 2500 people actively viewing the sub at any given time, and not all of them are actually participating). 

It really does strike me as odd though, the gender disparity here. Maybe it really is just that Reddit is supposed to be preferred by men over women, or maybe it's, as /u/AbundantToaster and /u/Siannon pointed out, the type of content being posted or what have you. I dunno. 


>> ARTICLE
It's not that complicated; most of the guys that post here are offputting to even guys. I'm a guy and I rarely post here and my wife loves anime a ton too, but she'd never in a billion years post on this subreddit because it's so fucking insular. If you don't like the stupid vapid flavor of the week fanservice show you're immediately an outcast. Like, this sub is primarily for 16-22 year old dudes due to the way voting trends are on posts and, like, whatever, let em have it. You don't exactly need a subreddit to be able to enjoy something.
>> ARTICLE
As a different take on it, I also don't participate as much because I am newer and don't have as much knowledge, like for the survey I didn't know of about any of the shows that were mentioned so I filled in my gender and the other more universal questions. But since I don't have the knowledge I thought I wasn't "qualified" to post here. But rewatches and episode threads are helping me get over that, the discussions really help and I'm becoming more confident I guess.

Dimension W is the one show that really grabbed me from its PV, and it's what I'm looking forward to the most. I'm glad to hear the source material is excellent!

> Dimension W is the one show that really grabbed me from its PV, and it's what I'm looking forward to the most

You've described me/my experience perfectly. I tried holding off on the manga in lieu of the anime, but I just couldn't muster the self-control because dammit, its premise and its PV completely grabbed me and made DW the anime I was most hyped for by far. 

And at least in my opinion, the manga is pretty darn good, though not everyone agrees.

Hell, check out [MAL's reaction](http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1401697) when it was announced it was getting an anime adaptation.

> "Looks like the usual garbage."

> "Funi involved? Pass."

Heck, they were even saying the art wasn't all that great, which surprised me, because I think the art is pretty swel all things considered.

The really unfortunate thing is though is that the manga is only 24 chapters so far. It's still in its infancy. From the looks of the PV it looks like the anime will be adapting the entire manga--and given that the manga is currently in the middle of the [](/s "hotel mystery") Arc it's a given that the anime ending is going to disappoint someone.

I hope that someone isn't me. 

All I can hope is that the original creator of the manga and the anime's staff are in contact with each other and that the author has some say in how the anime will end. 
>> ARTICLE
Hah yes, this is one case where I have managed to resist checking out the manga before it aired :)

As for MAL's reaction, I've long since realised that my preferences are unlikely to line up with the average MAL user, so it doesn't really bother me. I just hope they make it work if you're right and they do have to go anime-original for the ending!

The preview gave me a bit of a sense of being a kind of upbeat cyberpunk, and I've always been someone who enjoys some cyberpunk.
>> ARTICLE
> Cyberpunk

Yes. Cyberpunk is always fun. I'd say the PV did have a touch of that vibe. 
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling Dagashi Kashi isn't going to live up to what people are expecting from it.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, a lot of people are going to watch it, that doesn't mean expectations are through the roof.  Personally I'm watching it because the Candy store concept is unique and I'm trying to force myself to watch more stuff outside of my comfort bubble.  I have literally 0 expectations for what this show is going to be.

Over-hype was like... One Punch Man.  Where every thread on /r/anime became a OPM thread even if it didn't start as one, and it was hailed as the saviour of anime.  Haven't seen anything like that for Dagashi ;P
>> ARTICLE
Dagashi hasn't started airing, and OPM hype became huge around the release of episode 2.
>> ARTICLE
OPM hype was huge long before it aired.  It just reached a fever pitch afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
its not on the "high expectations" section though, there's just a lot of people planning to watch it. I figure it'll just be a decent shounen comedy, worth watching once a week but nothing to get excited about.
>> ARTICLE
I mean.. more people are expecting it to be something it isn't.
>> ARTICLE
Like a romcom? That's what I thought at first
>> ARTICLE
It's not a romcom.

I read a bit of the manga and it's more like Moyashimon rather than like Gin no Saji (if that makes sense).
>> ARTICLE
I'm just in it for the walking doujin. If she can deliver on that I'd be happy.
>> ARTICLE
That's definitely the case, people are expecting a Hotaru-centered comedy (and maybe ecchi not sure), when really it's a show that will be Food Wars levels deep on Japanese candy that is *supported* by Hotaru.
>> ARTICLE
That actually sounds a lot better than what I thought it would be. Judging from the PV and the character design I don't think I'm going to like Hotaru.
>> ARTICLE
It should be noted that all forms of info regarding the candy will be delivered by Hotaru.
>> ARTICLE
Oh well, I'm still willing to give it a chance, it could surprise me.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, I know it's a very small sample size (66 people) but is Durarara!! not that popular there? 
>> ARTICLE
I'd guess it has something to do with the sample size because in a lot of polls done for Japanese fans by Crunchyroll etc. DRRR is usually pretty popular.
>> ARTICLE
/r/japan_anime once again showing good taste, especially in their shorts list. Galko-chan AND best-short-ever Teekyuu?

[](#bestiathumbsup)

It's interesting that their 'other' answer on gender is so much higher than ours. 2% compared to 0.7%, I wonder what the 'others' classify themselves as? Are genderfluid, trans, or intersex people more common in Japan, or are they classifying something like crossdressing as 'other'?
>> ARTICLE
I imagine a show that is on it's 7th season would be popular with the Japanese users :p
>> ARTICLE
> It's interesting that their 'other' answer on gender is so much higher than ours.

I think "other" includes decline-to-state.
>> ARTICLE
Meanwhile we're all hyped about Sekkou boys. This grants us a victory over the japanese.
>> ARTICLE
We'll see, we'll see. I have a feeling I'll enjoy Teekyuu more, but it might surprise me. :p
>> ARTICLE
Actually its just higher percentage wise. If you look into the raw data r/anime had 17 people answering other while anime_japan had 1 person...
>> ARTICLE
Ah, duh, that makes much more sense :p So not really very interesting after all, thanks dude. 
>> ARTICLE
everyone sleeping on Rakugo smh, the disappointment.  
  
also guys, please watch [Nurse Witch Komugi-chan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/615/Nurse_Witch_Komugi-chan_Magikarte)! it's short and reasonably funny! there's no reason why it should be so low on all the lists outside of r/japan_anime!! (likewise, wow japan, really laying it on thick with those Durarara impressions huh? weird)
>> ARTICLE
> everyone sleeping on Rakugo smh, the disappointment.

That, Shirayuki 2, Nijiro Days and the otome adaptations (Prince of Stride, Norn9) are the ones I'm most looking forward to...

Has Rakugo been confirmed to be picked up by Crunchyroll, etc? I'm interested in watching it, but not sure if it'll be available in English.

I really like those recent TatsunokoPro reboots, so moderately hyped about that as well

Kind of surprised to see how much older the average aged user is on /r/japan_anime. I expected to be somewhat higher, just not by 6 years.
>> ARTICLE
They did get only 66 responses though. I wonder if the language requirement, of going to a site that's not part of the Japanese netosphere, also plays a part in it.

I'm turning 25 in a month. Someone was talking about her son being 30 and thought "That's old, then thought, wait I'm only 5 years away from that, shit" 
>> ARTICLE
Nah, don't feel bad. I'm gonna be 27 by the end of the Spring season. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm 36, you guys need to stop complaining.
>> ARTICLE
42 and proud of myself. It's one of the reasons why I dislike battle shonens/fighting Anime. 
>> ARTICLE
It's kind of a mistake to think of shonen as a genre, especially "shonen = battle shonen". A lot of shonen's have appeal to a peripheral demographic (Aria, for instance, is technically a shonen; even the Welcome to the NHK manga was published in a shonen magazine for some reason).
>> ARTICLE
I'm actually kinda curious as to how age factors into the average anime viewer's preferences.  Have you noticed a gradually change in what you've enjoyed over the years, or have you mostly enjoyed the same things you always have? I only ask because I've noticed I went from watching basically anything I could get my hands on in my early teens, to watching mostly "flavor of the season" things in my later teens, trying to branch out and watch more 'not as popular' stuff in my early twenties, and now in my mid-twenties I'm basically just watching stuff that stands out as 'unique' to me in one way or another. Be it simply a short form anime, something that has a slightly different art style, or just something that goes against the norm. I'd use Yami Shibai, Ping Pong and Death Parade as my examples for those three qualities I tend to be drawn toward.
>> ARTICLE
I first started watching around when I was 15 (1995). EDIT

The Scifi channel, or Syfi as they call themselves now, was showing what was called Saturday Anime. It was essentially two anime movies every Saturday morning, and they were really good ones. 

Here is the  trailer for it:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEGzjlPk7sM

I really wish they still did this, because it was a huge primer for me to get into anime. 

This is a list of some of the movies they showed:

* Adieu, Galaxy Express 999 
* Akira 
* Armitage III: Poly-Matrix 
* Casshan: Robot Hunter 
* Demon City Shinjuku 
* Dominion Tank Police 
* E.Y.E.S. of Mars 
* Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture 
* Galaxy Express 999 
* Gall Force 
* Green Legend Ran 
* Iria: Zeiram the Animation 
* Lensman 
* Lily C.A.T. 
* Odin: Photon Sailer Starlight 
* Project A-ko 
* Record of Lodoss War 
* Robot Carnival 
* Roujin Z 
* Tenchi Muyo! in Love 
* Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer 
* Vampire Hunter D 
* Venus Wars 
* Wizards

In that list, Robot Carnival was one of the biggest inspirations for me for getting into anime.

In 1995 I saw the Ghost in the Shell movie, which more or less defined the types of anime I like. If it's cyberpunk based, I will check it out, but overall more adult oriented shows have been my thing. After watching anime for almost 25 years, it takes a lot these days to impress me, I think there was three shows this year that knocked it out of the park for me (Death Parade, Sound Euphonium, and One Punch Man). 

But I haven't seen anything made like the production quality level like Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.

So to answer you're question, my tastes haven't really changed, but as you age you start comparing all the new stuff to everything you've watched. 
>> ARTICLE

You have the same starting digit.

I'm amazed on how low is Dimension W, considering its pedigree and after that preview.
>> ARTICLE
Teekyuu 7 is at the top 5 for short anime for the Japanese. Now I won't wonder why this series gets faster than any other series can hope for.
>> ARTICLE
I like that Dagashi is top for both in terms of popularity but doesn't have high expectations on either list. I think that if we're all going into it with this mindset then people are less likely to be disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
This is reminding me of Winter 2015, where I had no big names that I wanted to latch onto, so I spent my time rifling through smaller shows to see what I liked. Last year it was Yuri Kuma Arashi and Maria the Virgin Witch. 

Can't say what this year will hold, but Dimension W and Ajin sound neat, along with quite a few other potential winners, so hopefully this season will be filled with pleasant surprises.
>> ARTICLE
Huh! Would you let it at that. None of my anticipated shows made it to the top 5. My most anticipated shows, just based purely on their plot summary and who is producing it: Boku dake ga Inai Machi, Musaigen no Phantom World, HaruChika: Haruta to Chika wa Seishun Suru, Babuki Buranki, and Ajin. 
>> ARTICLE
Guys I have a question, is it worth marathoning Gate's first season before the 9th (the day it starts) to keep watching the second season while it airs?
>> ARTICLE
Yep


>> ARTICLE
>The top 5 anime with the highest expectations  
 	2 	Koukaku no Pandora

Yep, the Japanese knows what they are doing.
>> ARTICLE
That gender distribution.

Glad to see Ajin so high up, despite the negative stigma surrounding the use of CGI, as that seems to be the main reason as to why some people are put off by it. Polygon did an amazing job with Knight of Sidonia, so I'm not worried.
>> ARTICLE
Let's all be honest here with ourselves. This season is not going to save anime at all. A ton of mediocre and bad shows are waiting to disappoint us and lower or hopes for the spring season. Let's just hope spring season will contain more quality anime.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think anyone was expecting this season to 'save anime' in the first place :P

Either way, [a lot of promising stuff (including hyped adaptations and sequels)](http://myanimelist.net/anime/season/2016/spring) are slated for spring.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair, Winter is usually the 'worst' part of the anime season, since it comes after a usually amazing to decent Fall (and considering we had One Punch Man last season... well, yeah.)
>> ARTICLE
I've generally found that Spring and Fall are the more enjoyable seasons, whereas Summer and Winter are a bit of a breather. That's not to say there haven't been good shows in Summer and Winter, there've been many, but I've found that most of the big shows that get people talking air or at least start during Spring and Fall.
>> ARTICLE

It doesn't need saving ;P

To hear us tell it, anime gets saved more often than Princess Peach.

Is anyone else disappointed that Dagashi Kashi is rated so high? It's honestly not a thing I have high hopes for based of the manga but I guess I can see it doing moderately well.

(Excluding the genre) It looks like Mirai Nikki all over where they're trying to have the show ride on back of a single character (Yuno).

Also looks like Jap doesn't like KyoAni as much En. Although to be fair, I might like KyoAni A LOT. Like KyoAni is all I'm watching right now aside from the ReWatch of D.Grey-Man (2016 continue Hype)

It's something like.
MC(kid) - "I'm going to save my friend(s)."
Classmate (I think) - "What's going on / what's been happening?"

And in the older MC's voice, I think it's like - "I planned to return to the future, but now I'm getting caught up in the past again." (I winged this one based on how I perceived a few words, but I'm probs close anyway.)

As for the people talking simultaneously, I dunno.

I thought it meant like "going along with the past" in the second part, but I messed up the , and changed the second part a bit.

Don't speak a wiff of Japanese but the last few lines were something along the lines of "do you promise?" followed by kid Satoru saying "yup, it's a promise." As a manga reader, this dialogue aligns with what I've read too.

So, with my extremely limited understanding of the language, it sounds like the first words spoken are: "March 1st... from here on out the real battle (or contest, fight? I don't even know) starts" or something along those lines. Although do correct me if I'm completely off base. 

The first kid sounds like he's saying something along the lines of "helping (a/my) friend".

Seriously! I really hope noone ignores it as "just another SAO clone" and gives it at least 1 episode! That should be enough to capture them!

It's definitely one of the darkhorse shows of the season. I'm actually surprised more people aren't taking up on it. It does look a bit clich on the surface, but its great sense of humor and parody of the genre is really smartly done.

I thought it would be just an average anime like most of the anime from last season, but it was pretty funny. I loved the parody aspect of the show. The first episode was okish, but it made me want to watch more.

I wanted to -- really, I did -- but Hige is as dense as he is big, so that means the romance is going where I do not want it to go: nowhere.

Really nice comparison. Seriously.

If you'd have told me last year that A1 and DEEN would be putting out relatively interesting, creative shows while KyoAni and PA Works were pushing out uninspired crap this season, I'd have told you that you were crazy. This season is bonkers
>> ARTICLE
Well Konasuba is uninspired crap. Its as generic as anything else, combined with bad art work.

I think people want to call it a parody to justify calling it good but it isnt a parody at all. It is exactly that uninspired crap.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen any of Konasuba besides that clip on the front page today. I was referring solely to Rakugo, a show you definitely haven't watched if you didn't make the connection
>> ARTICLE
Forgot that was by DEEN.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't give off much a DEEN-y vibe, so I don't blame you.
>> ARTICLE
it is a parody of the common MMO anime, basically Konosuba is making fun of MMO aspect in backstory of him getting there, character creation, grinding instead of going through them normally they do it in a stupid way. that is simply what is called as parody.
>> ARTICLE
Except it isnt making fun of any of those things it simply is those things.

being a comedy is not being a parody. There is zero sense of "isnt it odd how they do this?" Its just telling its own version of that exact same story.
>> ARTICLE
Whether or not it rises to parody/deconstruction/insertbuzzwordhere levels, Konosuba is a pretty obviously comedic take on the whole "Guy in an MMO" trope, which I'd say is rare as most of them take themselves pretty seriously.  You're welcome to not like it, or not find it funny or a variety of things -- but you need to list a couple of shows that fall in the same column as it before I buy that it's uninspired and generic.
>> ARTICLE
Comedy and guy in an MMO?

You mean like DanMachi?

Almost every thing it does outside of the specific way in which he ends up in a gamified world has been done before. The chuuni character is exactly the same as nearly all chuuni girls in anime.

It certainly is not a parody by any means, but that is an easy excuse to use to claim that this is better than all the stuff it is exactly the same as.
>> ARTICLE
KonoSuba is literally a parody.... what the hell are you smoking?  That's *exactly* what it is.  DanMachi was not a parody, it just had comedic aspects.

So far, KonoSuba has played out as a straight comedy and nothing else.  Maybe that will change, but for the moment that's what it is.  I know of no other straight comedies of note about being trapped in a game.
>> ARTICLE
Then explain what makes Konasuba a parody and danmachi a comedy.

Please.

It hasnt done anything other gamified world and trapped in the mmo games havent done.
>> ARTICLE
DanMachi *is not a strict comedy*.  Konosuba is, or at least so far has been, a strict comedy.  DanMachi just has comedic moments in the show, but it is not a comedy.

It's a very simple difference to understand.  Everything that occurs in KonoSuba has been setup for a joke.  That is a comedy.  It is using said comedy to parody all the "stuck in an MMO" clones that have come out as of late.  Not everything in DanMachi is a joke, much of it is intended to be taken seriously.  Yeah, in reality the difference between a comedy and not a comedy isn't so clearly defined, but that's the general idea, and KonoSuba has *firmly* planted itself in comedy/parody territory.  KonoSuba so far has existed to make you laugh, and has never deviated from that fact.

A parody is simply deliberate use of a particular style to exaggerated effect, which is what KonoSuba is doing.  It's exaggerating what it is like to play as a party in an MMO and how silly of an idea it is to want to be stuck in one.

I mean, part of me thinks you have to be trolling here.  Something is wrong with your brain if you really can't tell that KonoSuba is a parody.  I don't know how it could be any *more* of a parody if it tried...?
>> ARTICLE
Except it hasn't really exaggerated anything. It's doing exactly the same thing all of those shows do. There is no "turning it up to 11" or anything.

It's just doing the exact same jokes, with less depth. It's the lack of depth that makes you feel it's "pure comedy".

The jokes it makes aren't even in the realm of being original. They've all been done before.

For instance, the mage is just a shittier, setting appropriate version of Rikka from Chu2.

Parody needs to actually exaggerate something, not just make mildly adjusted copies.
>> ARTICLE
................. okay no, you have to be a troll.  I refuse to believe anyone is this blind.

Giant frog NPCs fucking eating a character without killing her and covering her in slime after she forsook her *healing* roll to melee with the monster and failed...... nothing in that statement is exaggerated to you?  Like... you have to be fucking with me, I can't believe anything else.  That's how you think typical MMO games/shows play out?  Really?  I guess I'll have to remember that next time I watch Grimar or SAO or whatever and someone dies and everyone goes, "ahahhaha look, he/she just got eaten, how fucking hilarious!"

The mage blowing all her energy to nuke one frog to death and then get eaten as well, that's a common MMO story trait is it?  Not exaggerated in the least.  Or a masochistic tank.  Totally not exaggerated.  Am I getting Poe's lawed right now?
>> ARTICLE
It's not more exaggerated than the "genre" is known for.

> The mage blowing all her energy to nuke one frog to death and then get eaten as well, that's a common MMO story trait is it? Not exaggerated in the least. Or a masochistic tank. Totally not exaggerated. Am I getting Poe's lawed right now?

So then you didn't read what I wrote at all...so I'll say it again.

For instance, the mage is just a shittier, setting appropriate version of Rikka from Chu2.

A1 has always been one of my favorite studios and I feel it gets so much negative flack for some reason. DEEN also has been hiring a lot of powerhouse talent th epast few years, so it was bound to happen that they would get a hit. I think PA Works is really in a transition period where they don't have that much budget for their show this season. It has a good premise but its low production value really hurts it. I think KyoAni's show may be a tad schlocky but it could have its ups if it continues to have more character centric episodes like the latest one.
>> ARTICLE
Because since they release SAO and it became a hit they release like 4 SAO clones and 1 decent-to-amazing series every year.
>> ARTICLE
Most studios essentially assemble a bunch of different freelancers for each individual show, it's wrong to assume that the same people from a studio are working on all its series. You can never really know what you're going to get. And the studios aren't really responsible for the material they adapt either, that's the production committees job. So there's nothing to prevent a studio from adapting a good anime one season and a bad one the next. They also aren't responsible for deciding whether a series will get a sequel, again, that's the production committee (so stop yelling at Madhouse).

KyoAni is the main exception to all of this (they do everything in house and usually sit on the production committee for the anime they adapt), and yeah, I am surprised to see them adapting such garbage.
>> ARTICLE
Well Kyoani and PA both have very important shows for them at later this year.
>> ARTICLE
For sure. The whole anime industry has gone crazy. It switches so often where some companies make bad anime to jaw-dropping ones. Like A1 made Vividred operation(*shudders), Your Lie in April, and Silver spoon. I was not expecting something this dark and serious from them. Erased is a solid must watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Your name is hilarious! :3

> ...I'd have told you that you were crazy. This season is bonkers

*All* studios have their ups and their downs. I wrote about PA Works experiencing this -- GlassLip, Charlotte -- but KyoAni is the same way -- Beyond the Boundary (granted, BtB is nowhere *near* as awful as PA Works lows; plus, BtB has one of the [best EDs of all-time!](http://b.1339.cf/tfyxizx.webm)) I think PW will end up the same as BtB: pretty average, but by no means horrible.

On the flip-side, A1 can make some pretty great stuff -- Your Lie in April, Shinsekai Yori -- as can DEEN -- Ruroni Kenshin (disclaimer: I have never seen it, but it is popular/rated highly enough) and Sakura Trick.

Oh, absolutely. I'm pretty sure PA Works is *the* most well-known example of this with Nagi no Asukara -> Glasslip -> Shirobako -> Charlotte. But how am I gonna rake in the dank karmie points while giving studios the benefit of the doubt?
>> ARTICLE
> I think PW will end up the same as BtB: pretty average, but by no means horrible.

I would hope PW gets up to KnK's range... KnK at least gave us the aforementioned amazing ED, one of the best filler episodes, a pretty heavy and emotional ending to the TV show, a great ship, and a wonderfully animated movie! 
>> ARTICLE
> ...one of the best filler episodes...

How could I forget! You are totally right, that is one of the best filler episodes of all-time.

(Thinking on it more, BtB has a lot of "best of all-time"'s from me...)

And doing even more thinking, you might be right; in the end, PW will probably end up lower than BtB.

So long as I get my Mai fill, though, I am good-to-go. :3

[Spoiler: TV show finale](/s "Until the author/kyoani decided that instead of leaving Mirai dead or pulling a SAO, they said: "Fuck this, she is alive now. FIN."
The last 2 episodes weren't as good as the others but this was what really made me upset about the whole show.")
>> ARTICLE
I was so ready to accept THE outcome but then they pulled THAT ending -_-
>> ARTICLE
Deen is doing the highly-anticipated Sakamoto-san show next season, too (which by many accounts will be fantastic even if they just adapt it note-for-note). Who knows, maybe this is the "year of Deen"!
>> ARTICLE
I was actually really disappointed when I initially learned DEEN was doing Sakamoto-san, but then Rakugo happened. Now I can raise my expectations to impossible degrees and not look like a moron!
>> ARTICLE
Funnily enough, usually when this happens we can be all like "ah, but the studio doesn't matter as much as we all pretend it does, it's all about the people, right!"

But in this case, I can't do that! Rokugo is only the second series directed by Omata Shinichi (after Sankarea way back in 2012, which was... not amazing) and the rest of his credits are nothing major (the best would be being episode director for two episodes of Arakawa Under the Bridge and one of Madoka Magica). Rokugo's screenwriter (and composition), meanwhile, is Kumagai Jun, who previously worked on the *masterpieces* of writing that are Valvrave the Liberator, Nobunaga the Fool and Aquarian Logos. And then the Art Director (Mayuzumi Masaki)'s previous work as art director was on AoharuXMachinegun, a show so forgettable you probably don't remember it only aired two seasons ago. 

So *not only* is this from Studio Deen, one of the most lauded studios still in the business (by western fans, anyways), but all the top staff are veering between "not notable" and "has a portfolio of crap". By all rights this show should really, really suck ... but it doesn't! 

How does this happen??!!! Somehow Deen found a way...

Then they not only announce Sakamoto for next season, but they've now announced that the director is going to be Takamatsu Shinji, who unlike the Rokugo guy *is* a known and well-regarded director (previous director credits include Gintama, Daily Lives of High School Boys, School Rumble and a ton of Gundam)... yeah, I'm hella excited for Sakamoto desu ga and I don't care if my expectations are through the roof!!!
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi is a lot more than just "A guy who did a few episodes", he's a SHAFT storyboard artist, which certainly means something when you regard who he's trained under. The transition from storyboard artist to director isn't a rare one and he's managed to take both the director and storyboard role for Rakugo.
>> ARTICLE

Right, it's not uncommon at all for a storyboard artist to move up to being an episode director, and likewise it's common for someone who has been an episode director for several projects to give the main director role a try, too. But that's exactly why I don't see it as any particular promise of directorial skill or quality. There are TONS of storyboard artists, at SHAFT and elsewhere, who work their way up and eventually take the director chair, and many of them are *not* good at it (especially with their first few shows - many will gradually improve and become much better later on, of course). So simply being a SHAFT storyboard artist is not that much of a credit to his name when anticipating his directorship - there's lots of other SHAFT storyboard artists that have never moved onto that position or that have and have flopped.

Obviously with hindsight now we can look at Rokugo and say "Yup, this Omata Shinichi guy is new but he's got some skills. Maybe he learned a lot of that from working under Miyamoto Yukihiro several times?"

But a month ago, before Rokugo first aired, if you had said "Hey, this Rokugo show coming up is going to be great! Don't worry that it's being made by Studio Deen, and that the director's only previous director credit is Sankarea, because he did two episodes of storyboards for Madoka Magica! Oh, and he's the animation producer of Sex Ward, Love Doll, Officer Affairs, Sins of the Flesh, and Slave Sisters! This is going to be such a great show full of well-crafted, mature character studies!" it would have been very difficult to believe.

Drop Assassination Classroom for having an absurd premise?.... All I can say to that is welcome to anime? If this is your 1st time on this ride you can get off at the giant mechs throwing galaxies at each other and summoning drill power :/
>> ARTICLE
> Drop Assassination Classroom for having an absurd premise?.... All I can say to that is welcome to anime?

There is just something about a bunch of kids becoming assassins then not using their assassination skills at all times to take out this dude who is going to blow up the Earth yet he is evidently one of the nicest things ever. All wrapped in a very childish approach to comedy and story.

For these reasons, I say to drop this one faster than a hotplate!!!

Edit: Wrong celestial body!
>> ARTICLE
>  then not using their assassination skills at all times to take out this dude

...aren't they? 

I mean, yeah, they're not doing it quite as often as they did in the first few episodes, but that makes sense, they tried all the obvious spur-of-the-moment tactics and failed! So now they are more focused on big elaborate plans that utilize their numbers and variety of skills rather than hoping to land a lucky shot after the first 789036 shots were easily dodged. 

And even then, they're not entirely sticking to that MO either. [Really vague, minor spoilers](/s "E.g. in the latest episode, while Koro-sensei is busy moving around dealing with a different situation, Karma pulls out his knife and tries to hit Koro-sensei while he's distracted, and hence some of Koro-sensei's flash-clones have a troubled expression as they try to dodge that, too. But the show doesn't call attention to it at all, it's just a little subtle thing happening in the background. That's not the only instance of a minor in-the-moment assassination attempt going on in the background, though yeah I do wish there were more of them.")
>> ARTICLE
> So now they are more focused on big elaborate plans that utilize their numbers and variety of skills rather than hoping to land a lucky shot after the first 789036 shots were easily dodged.

I don't know how I missed this comment! I apologize.

Truth be told, I am being picky, but what I mean by "not using their assassination skills at all times to take out this dude" is *always* trying to take this dude out. Time is literally of the essence and Koro-sensei is literally going to blow up the Earth unless they stop him. Meaning, they should be taking advantage of *every single opportunity*, no matter how small.

So when [AssClass Season Two Spoilers](/s "after fending off Itona and he says, 'I'm pooped. Time for a little rest,' and he is clearly weaker than he has been compared to lately, them *not* making a move at that moment seems so silly to me.")

There is also [AssClass Season Two Spoilers](/s "when they stop Itona's captors from firing their bullets at Itona. That has the side effect of helping Koro-sensei, the exact opposite of what they need to be doing. But this one makes more sense because if they don't stop these bad guys that will cause too much harm to Itona in the process.")

I think it all comes down to me hating how asinine the situation is. How these kids are meant to grow and change in a positive way through this dude, yet they are meant to kill him also. If they don't kill him, then everybody dies, yet they really like him a lot so they don't want to kill him because he is "Koro-sensei."

Hopefully the twist/reveal later will fix -- or at the minimum relieve -- some of my criticism towards the anime, but for now, I do not see it as an anime worth touting.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, those are all valid points. But I think you're basically outlining the core premise of the entire show there. I don't think there's really a way to do the Assassination element constantly without significantly paring down the Classroom element as a consequence, lessening the bond between Koro-sensei and the students, and removing all the themes related to the bullying, despair and ostracism of the students. 

That could also be a very good show in its own way, but I think a big part of what does make Assassination Classroom great is that it does tackle the Classroom side of things, that it actually shows and deals with issues related to the characters beings students and teenagers, while so many other school-setting action shows just ignore the school setting outright and pretend their teenage characters are mature, self-sufficient adults. If it needs to sacrifice some realism on the Assassination side, I'm okay with that... and I think it did a pretty good job preparing me for that when the government equipped all the students with special BB pellets that *somehow* can only hurt their teacher and literally nothing else.

It would be cool to see a show that is entirely focused upon assassinating one ultra-powerful figure, though. That'd be a fun premise, and possibly even better if it was done with adult characters who are already competent assassins (in a variety of styles) at the start of the show and we simply get to follow them through several different plans and types of attacks as they gauge the abilities of their target and become more and more effective at beating the target's defenses.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair they did try harder before they got to know him. I'm pretty sure it's hard to kill the only guy, er, thing that actually thinks you'll amount to anything.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm pretty sure it's hard to kill the only guy, er, thing that actually thinks you'll amount to anything.

This is true!

But Koro-sensei has no reason to blow up the Earth. He can just be nice to them and teach them and everyone can be super happy without all of the lame and futile assassination attempts.

Now, the argument (I am guessing, because I do not know) is that "there is a reason why he is simultaneously being super nice and wanting to blow up the Earth, they just have not shown/explained it yet." And *that* is a HUGE problem. After twenty-five episodes, the only thing we know about Koro-sensei is one tiny, muddied flashback that happened way back in the beginning of the first season. I get that they are trying to make it a big reveal/twist, but going *so long* without *anything* on arguably the most interesting character in the series is nothing short of a bad move.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, what MysterySushi says is true. There is a reason why he is nice but is going to blow up the earth.
>> ARTICLE
> But Koro-sensei has no reason to blow up the Earth

There actually is a reason as to why he's going to (**manga spoilers that might be part of a third season depending on how S2 goes**, just go ahead and read if you're going to drop the series and don't care): [He doesn't want to destroy the Earth, but the cells in his body are made of anti-matter* because he was a science experiment gone horribly wrong and will explode if he doesn't die beforehand. The only reason as to why he doesn't just end himself to prevent that from happening is because he made the promise to teach Class E for the year to the only person who cared about him period before he started teaching.](/spoiler)

In addition to that the more they learn about him the more they find out that just attacking is utterly useless. Gotta set up a hyperplan which for good reasons can't be set up every episode.

an anime can be absurd but it doesn't excuse it from the fact that it still has to sell its premise. assassination classroom doesn't do a very good job of that.

I think it does a mighty fine job. But that might be because many people get the premise all wrong, and expect the assassination part to completely overshadow the classroom part.

And the fact that its a mighty popular manga also indicates that it does a good job.

So, just some little notes here and there from me about shows that more people might want to give a chance to or the ones that Banjo didn't mention:

**Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm**

This show reminded me of Aria. It's basically a super relaxing SOL with a little sci-fi twist. The characters are not particularly deep, but their interactions are very enjoyable and the cast is very, very likable. Even characters that appear to be mean or arrogant in the beginning, turn out to be very nice people on the inside. The idea of Flying Circus is quite intriguing and seems to have more depth than might initially appear. 

**Active Raid**

This show is stupid and campy and feels like Jackie Chan's movies from the 80s. And I love it for that. Basically, imagine a typical buddy-cop show, but with police mechs instead. Add to that some solid CG fight scenes, very light and comedic tone, enjoyable banter between characters and a female lead who already exhibits some cool character development, and you get one very weird and exciting little show. Oh yeah, you wanna how campy the show is? [Police mechs flash their badges](https://45.media.tumblr.com/8d0c5a0aa251bbede7b930751cd73ab5/tumblr_o0lxshV8bo1skdbiao1_400.gif) and the latest episode had a "Hacker Duel". It's that goddamn campy.

**Momokuri**

It's cute. It's funny. It's adorable. It's as if people who made KinMosa or Wakaba Girl decided to make a romance. Watch your blood sugar levels.


>> ARTICLE
I guess ao no four rhythm is sort of like Aria in terms of atmosphere and somewhat similar superficially in tone. Other then that they are nothing alike.
>> ARTICLE
Erased and KonoSuba are my top two as well, from what everyone has been saying I guess I really need to check out Rakugo.
>> ARTICLE
Personally didn't like Rakugo, too slow for me. I get that it's new and different but that alone isn't enough for me to like it. 
>> ARTICLE
Rakugo is definitely my favorite, but it does hold a certain slow paced storytelling, subtle storytelling and a focus on period drama and Rakugo, so it fills a lot of niche aspects. But I feel its myriad strengths really helps make it shine. Not to mention it must be one of Studio Deen's prettier shows in recent memory and also the classical Japanese and jazzy soundtrack really adds to it.

I can understand if the show won't be up everyone's alley but it is a good balance to the more over the top shows out there if you're open to slower and methodical stories.
>> ARTICLE
> Erased and KonoSuba are my top two as well...

Erased's third episode was so emotional. Anger, sadness, elation; you name it, it had it.

As for KonoSuba, I am *loving* the characters. All of them. Sure, they might be a *little* trope-y, but I don't care. They are so much fun that they make me smile from start to finish. :D

> ...from what everyone has been saying I guess I really need to check out Rakugo.

Definitely.

It has an aura about it, an atmosphere that is best experienced instead of reading about. Although I am still waiting for "something to happen" -- as a story about storytellers, the story so far has been pretty meh. But everything else, from the music to the characters to the art, has been fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
The manga for Erased is not so highly rated as the current anime is. I'm predicting it will not hold on to such a high rating for long.
>> ARTICLE
>from what everyone has been saying I guess I really need to check out Rakugo.

I didn't think I'd like Rakugo, but I'm in love with it after watching the first three episodes. It's not [everyone's cup of tea though.](http://i.imgur.com/u2uJlI1.gifv) Although I primarily watch anime for escapist purposes, I'm enchanted by Rakugo because so far it's hitting the bullseye as a character study. It's exploring various aspects of the human condition through it's diverse cast of characters. 

Like Banjo said, almost all technical aspects of this anime are on point, but I'm especially drawn to the attention to characterization. Although heavy handed at times due to occasional internal monologues, often words are left unspoken and I can just *feel* these characters' emotions, although I don't understand them completely yet. What they desire, what's holding them back and why; these things are slowly falling into place. For the most part I can empathize with each of them despite their different personalities and perspectives because we're given enough of an understanding of the experiences that have shaped them. Overall, Rakugo just feels so...*human*. 

But...I'd be hard pressed to call it entertaining. There are decent jokes here and there, some dramatic and tense moments, but it's meditative and reflective for the most part. If you don't feel a connection with the characters, [I wouldn't fault anyone for falling asleep while trying to watch it.](http://i.imgur.com/7rWiBJ1.gifv) Definitely give it a try though. 

>Erased and KonoSuba are my top two as well

And they're mine as well in addition to Rakugo. 

[Wait a second...](http://i.imgur.com/9hIx9kk.gifv)

I've skimmed these threads by /u/BanjoTheBear every season since he first started posting them and we've never shared more than one anime in our top 3, [yet this season our top 3 are identical.](http://i.imgur.com/WkkcVWn.gifv) 

[This can mean only one thing...](http://i.imgur.com/KNOk4rW.gifv)

[^My ^taste ^has ^gone ^to ^shit.](http://i.imgur.com/KiT60YI.gifv)
>> ARTICLE
> Overall, Rakugo just feels so...human.

That is a nice description of the show!

I think the second episode has been the strongest of the three, because it gets at what you are saying about feeling their human side without outright saying too much -- [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "the overpowering music during Yakumo's performance, the conversation between kid Shin and kid Yakumo in the bathhouse, Yakumo laughing for the first time when Shin was doing rakugo to earn a spot at the home.") The anime goes to great lengths to make everything feel as right, as *human* as possible.

> But...I'd be hard pressed to call it entertaining.

...And that is the show's biggest problem right now. Ironically, there is just not a whole lot going on story-wise. Without some conflict, some driving force for the characters -- despite how well the anime is framing everything around them -- that sense of emotional investment is just not there. At least, it is not as powerful as it can be.

> My taste has gone to shit.

[Oh, you! :P](https://i.imgur.com/tgHmJyg.gifv)

It was nice hearing from you again, James. I hope things have been well. :)

(Also, nice gif usage throughout your comment!)
>> ARTICLE
Let's be honest here, there are 2 shows which stand out than others in this season which are Shouwa Genroku and Boku Dake. No matter how different in taste you have, once you have seen most anime in the season you will always come to a conclusion. They are both great in term of story telling, cinematography and character developments. 

Only the third one might seems different. For me it's Dimension W with its strong performance on first episode, but after that it becomes a bit dull but I still have high hope for the show.

Konosuba is probably the best option for comedy fan in this season cause there aren't any good comedy anime. Dagashi Kashi is a big disappointment after all.

Now go watch both KonoSuba and Rakugo to show your support of them and their success! :D
>> ARTICLE
I just have to say, if you want to enjoy a bad show, there are far better options than Musaigen. Musaigen is just bad, it's not funny bad and it doesn't redeem it's bad plot with it's other aspects. Symphogear was a fun bad show where the writers took a vacation, and they saved it by making everything hype. Another was a bad horror, but the comedy of the season. Musaigen is simply not the kind of bad that is still enjoyable. 

Also, I question your "most" claim. I picked up 12 shows this season and you're not watching 7 of them.  So I included my own thoughts on those series below.

* **Ajin** -- Watch it.   
It looks promising (especially since I watched the movie already, which seems to cover up until episode 5). The MC and plot are interesting, and the CG doesn't distract from the show very much and I think for some scenes it actually is able to get more detail in. Obviously there's no direct comparison, but it doesn't look bad. 
* **Prince of Stride** -- Consider it   
I've not watched much sports anime in the past, but this seems exactly what I would expect from one. I feel like it's going to end up with way too many characters and not focusing on each one enough. However, so far it's been pretty average, I'll be sticking with it.
* **Koukaku no Pandora** -- Drop it   
If you enjoy the mindless ecchi of Musaigen, maybe give this a try? It's closer to the so-bad-it's-good kind of show, although I wouldn't say it's quite there. As for the show itself, it's basically Yuri robots shooting shit. Plot doesn't seem to be anything interesting yet, I'm only continuing watching because I lost a bet.
* **Schwarezmarken** -- Consider it   
Apparently people don't like this? I see it as an upgrade to the harem hijinks that Total Eclipse was, although we'll see if that continues given the ending of the most recent episode. I like the setting but wish they would just adapt the main MLA storyline, since I've heard it was quite good.
* **Koyomimonogatari** -- You already know if you want to watch it.   
Honestly, I don't think this needs a review. If you enjoy the monogatari series, you'll probably enjoy these shorts. I think it's overall not as good as the other monogatari shows, but it's still entertaining. 
* **Nurse Witch Komugi** -- Drop it   
It has it's moments, but overall it's not not fun to watch. The characters aren't really great and I don't think the plot exists yet. The second (of two) shows this season I'm watching thanks to losing a bet. Don't make bets kids.
* **Nijiiro Days** -- Consider it.   
I counted this one and then forgot about it while writing about the other shows. It seems fitting actually, it's not very special. The characters aren't anything special and don't expect much out of the romances as it's a short and there will most likely be epsiodes dedicated to each guy. Luckily they all like different girls, so it's not terrible. Like Komugi, it has some funny moments. Unlike the Komugi, the rest isn't terrible, so I'd say you should consider it.

Edit - Counted 7, only listed 6.

I am enjoying Schwarezmarken, I don't even remember the ecchi element it has because of the good story.

i'm seriously digging this show. very well paced so far. no kawaii fanservice that gets in the way of the story. am hype.

>> ARTICLE
Koukaku no Pandora has that appeal as a serious mecha science base underneath its yuri/ecchi premise. It was an experimental Shirow Masamune idea after all. It's not bad for what it is. It's just a tad low budget. I think it's a little to make sweeping generalizations about Musaigen because this is one of KyoAni's battle anime in a while and they might really show off their chops eventually. Also the setup and the lore is there. And they actually built some characterization last episode.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it'll improve later, but I'm currently not seeing much good in it. 

I think you a few words there about Musaigen. I honestly don't think there's anything that can be done to save the terrible plot and meh characters of Musaigen though (short of starting over as a parody). The fact that they seem to know it's trash and yet keep making it (the stair scene when MC sees Kirby's panstu) doesn't give me hope that they'll improve. If everyone agrees that it's amazing at the end of the season and it's got like an 8.5 rating then I'll pick it back up, but for now it's dropped.
>> ARTICLE
How are you liking Grimgar and Dagashi Kashi so far? Because I'm enjoying Musaigen more than both of those currently. Dagashi, to me, is just bad (though I can see how it is aiming for nostalgia with people who used to buy dagashi or whatever). Grimgar has potential for sure but has been very boring and cringeworthy at times (without payoff. RUCK FANTA).

There are aspects to Musaigen that are stupid, for sure, but I'm liking the light-heartedness of it. Koito being a mean hardass doesn't do it for me, maybe it's relevant later in the story though.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't pick up Grimgar, and Dagashi Kashi has been disappointing so far, especially given how hyped up it was before the season began. I think it's a great reminder that anime is not made with us in mind, all the dagashi parts just don't interest me. Even if I'm not enjoying it that much, I don't see how you could says it's worse than Musaigen, especially if what you like about the latter is that it's light-hearted (unless you think the show about candy is serious and dramatic?). 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I get what you mean about the light-heartedness but Dagashi just feels a bit more tense with Saya kind of competing to be best girl, even though Hotaru seems to only be in it for her ulterior motives. Guess I'm a bit stuck on that kind of stuff.

Koukaku is something I love because I love GitS so to me its basically some of the same ideas (cyberbrain, full cyborgs etc) with yuri androids that doesn't really give a crap. It's like a fun parody for me.

Thanks a ton for doing this. I'm a bit behind in terms of keeping up with all the shows I want to, but I'm doing more this season that I have been since Fall 2014 which is when I dropped out of airing anime watching for a while.

I agreed with your annoyance over the fan-service shots in Grimgar. I don't even remember how much I liked the first episode's plot, partially cause I was watching it in a group setting, but also because the show convinced me so thoroughly that all it cared about was framing the boobs and ass well and letting me know that the characters had those things on their mind just as much as the director. Like you said, it could be good, and I'll watch a few more episodes to see, but I'm disappointed in both the fanservice and the characters. The plot I won't judge quite yet.

Maybe I'm just a grump, but I'd also go farther in my criticism of Dagashi Kashi and point out the blatant product placement. I don't mind sponsorships if it allows the production of the show in the first place, but when the plot and all-important comedy is shoved to the side in favor of waxing eloquent about confectionery brands.

Finally, I'd like to debate you and /u/Sinrus on the emotional appeal of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. It can be slow, especially if the comedy of the rakugo performances doesn't appeal to you (and there's nothing wrong with that). However, though I can certainly understand /u/Sinrus's criticism of the show's multi-episode flashback, the events in both the first episode and in the flashbacks are very relatable, and happen between realistic characters. I was upset when [episodes 2 and 3]  (/s "Bon's girlfriend had to leave, and later when he is told he must stay with his master's wife rather than go with Hatsutaro (I probably felt all the more since he himself bottled everything up)") I teared up when [episode 3](/s "They return home") and was just generally touched by Bon and Hatsutaro's relationship (sorry they all have so many names, so I'm trying to use the most commonly used young names). Whether it's [spoilers?](/s "a deep camaraderie like brothers, or something more") I care about them. Just in general the characters in the show seem so much deeper or dynamic than cliched tropes in so many other shows.
>> ARTICLE
> ...that all it cared about was framing the boobs and ass...

Yea, it is a prime example of fan-service that is just way too out-of-place. This is meant to be a realistic portrayal of a struggling and adventuring group. Them hooking up is cool-beans, but the camera panning behind Yume as she lays in bed is unnecessary for not just the character but also the situation.

> ...and point out the blatant product placement.

Huh. I never thought of it that way. Is that really true? I it was just the subject matter. Unless you are referring to the small clips at the end?

> I was upset...

Here is how I viewed it: [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "Yakumo himself stated that he only dated her because he was passively interested in what it was like dating a girl. And her character was barely even around for five minutes. Combined, that scene where she is crying and leaving him lacks emotion for Yakumo and, by extension, emotion for me.")

> I teared up when...

I will give some credit here. [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "Seeing Yakumo walk towards Shin -- *without* his cane -- was touching. Good emotion there. Not to the point of tears let alone incredibly moving, but it was nice to witness.")

> Just in general the characters in the show seem so much deeper or dynamic than cliched tropes in so many other shows.

I agree! They are.

But the anime is not *actually* doing anything with these characters. Yakumo is getting developed and Shin is influencing his "brother" in a positive manner, but since the story *around* them is not using them, then it makes it inherently difficult to invest in them.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's the hook of Grimgar though. Despite it being presented as serious, it definitely looks like an over the top fantasy world (or even a game). So I kind of think the fanservice kind of reminds the viewers that it could be a fictional/game setting too. It does play with both sides. I can see why it may irk, but I think it does serve a purpose. Well, it helps to like sexual elements of shows too I guess, but in this instance, I think it is somewhat intentional to keep viewers guessing. It's not just the fanservice but how the world is structured and combat is handled too. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you could say that it keeps viewers guessing but you could also say it's inconsistent. I really wanted to take this show seriously because of all the LN readers, but the show doesn't take itself that seriously. Maybe it's going to get really serious with the developments in episode 4 but who knows. Also people say its actually really deep and you need analysis, but I think Grimgar would be better off if you shut off your brain.
>> ARTICLE
In the first episode of Dagashi Kashi, they hold the first candy up to the camera, and then go on at length about all the amazing flavors and how it's the best candy because it's good for any mood. And there's barely any plot or comedy in that section so it's hard to argue that it's not about the product.

As for Rakugo, I'm trying to figure out what you mean by the story around them using them. They DO interact with the world, but I do think the character interactions are the highlight anyway.

Also, I'm pretty sure [Rakugo](/s "He says he originally dates her to try it out, but then she's super sweet and they're perfect. I don't think you can say he lacked emotion when that's his entire personality. He doesn't wear his emotions on his sleeve. I think he cared a ton, or the scene wouldn't have been in there.")
>> ARTICLE
> As for Rakugo, I'm trying to figure out what you mean by the story around them using them. They DO interact with the world, but I do think the character interactions are the highlight anyway.

I will try to rephrase it!

A story is being told, that much is true. [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "His girlfriend leaves him, his 'brother' leaves him, and even 'rakugo' leaves him. That is a lot of loss for one person to take! And again, I can appreciate this on a character level: the show is developing his character wonderfully. But the actual *story* has no conflict. Yakumo, as I listed, certainly does, but everything else that the story has and is presenting demonstrates that there is no actual problem going on. One might argue the near loss of rakugo/the war, but not only is that resolved in a single episode but one of those elements -- the war -- is never given any direct context.")

The [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "main conflict is in the present timeline, with the -- once again -- dwindling rakugo. The conflict between Konatsu and Yakumo and Yotarou and Yakumo. The relationship between Konatsu and Yakumo. All of the *true* conflict is not being shown in favor of characterizing and developing Yakumo. It is a trade-off, one that I feel Rakugo is not balancing correctly.")

Hopefully that clarifies things a bit more!

> Also, I'm pretty sure...

True.

[Rakugo Spoilers](/s "There is still the issue that he talks to her, dates her, and she leaves him all in the span of five minutes. Emotions need time to cook! A dramatic scene like the one where they are hugging is not a powerful one if it happens all in the span of five minutes. It needs build-up, it needs tension, it needs *conflict*.")
>> ARTICLE
Alright yeah, that cleared up your problem with it, and i do see your point. There's a definite lack on conflict, especially in the flashback.

I also see your side when it comes to [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "the relationship. I'd argue you can tell a compelling and even emotional story in a short period (think of the beginning of Pixar's UP or several shorts by Shinkai), but this certainly isn't on that level. I guess I just could identify with the emotions of loss, rather than caring about her as a person. If anything, I cared about what he might be feeling, as someone who has very little in the world and had just found someone special only to lose her. It certainly wasn't a conflict, nor was a major plot point, I just thought it evoked some empathy")
>> ARTICLE
> I also see your side when it comes to...

[Rakugo Spoilers](/s "Yea, the beginning of UP is pretty much the titular 'how to tell a romance story with no words in about two minutes,' so that kind of comparison is unfair for Rakugo. :P")

And [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "you are totally right. You do feel some empathy for him. It is hard not to feel anything for someone who has lost something, especially another person. How we -- you and I and anyone else -- respond to it, however, is dictated by our own experiences, not just the anime itself. Meaning, that scene moved you more so than it did me because it spoke to you differently, in whatever way that might have been.")
>> ARTICLE
Right. And I was never trying to argue that it was the saddest or most emotional thing ever, just that the show wasn't dry and unrelatable to me
>> ARTICLE
The flashback characters aren't bad, by any means. My frustration springs from the fact that I *really like* the present day characters. So far this extended exposition, which is interrupting the story I was already invested in, has not informed or added to any of the conflict or mystery that surrounded Sukeroku in episode one. Why does [episode one](/s "Konatsu think that Yakumo killed Sukeroku? Why does Yakumo not want Yotaro to study Sukeroku's performances?") None of this has been explained, or even alluded to. The conflict in the backstory amounts to [episodes 2 and 3](/s "at first Bon didn't like rakugo, and then he learned to like it. Then his master and friend left for the war and he had to wait for them to come back. I want to learn about Sukeroku and why he's so controversial, that's the entire reason Yakumo is telling the story in the first place. An entire episode about Bon sitting around waiting for him to get back from China does not contribute at all to the story I actually care about.") I am confident that once *Rakugo* gets to where it's going, it will be incredible. I just want it to stop wasting time and get there already.
>> ARTICLE
Perspectives on a few other shows if you want them (sorry they're a bit short):

Norn9: - Drop

The characters are two-dimensional and the pacing leaves a lot to be desired.  Most of the show is taken up by slice of life as opposed to exploring the show's setting (which is interesting and well-designed) or the plot (which given recent developments may be trying to bite off more than it can chew).  Stay away from this show unless you enjoy trashy reverse harems (if you do, it starts off mediocre but gets trashy later, so have no fear).

Sushi Police: - Drop

Somehow manages to be more absurd than Sekko Boys and is packed with patriotic cringe comedy.  I'm still not sure if we're supposed to root for the protagonists or condemn them.  While the episodes are short (only 3.5 minutes) the jokes are repetitive enough to feel grating by the third episode.  The ending song is by OK Go, but it only lasts 30 seconds.  Unless you enjoy Trigger-esque so bad it's good (or have a fantatical love of sushi) I wouldn't recommend it.

Prince of Stride: -Consider

An excellent sports show with a novel concept and excellent animation.  Characters are nothing to write home about, but the parkour-style races inject a healthy dose of excitement to what would otherwise be a generic sports show.  Viewers new to sports anime should definitely consider this (if only for the parkour), but those who enjoy sports anime, acrobatic stunts, or fujo bait (or all three!) will especially enjoy this.  Those uncomfortable with fujoshi or rampant gay shipping are advised to avoid this fandom, because to a fujoshi there's subtext up the wazoo.

Schwarzemarken (sorry if it's misspelled): - Consider

Mostly accessible to those who haven't read Muv-Luv, though reading up on the different kinds of BETAs is probably helpful.  The show has done an excellent job of setting the atmosphere and deftly weaves political intrigue and mecha action together.  Characters are solid but nothing overly spectacular.  Viewers uncomfortable with gore should avoid this show, but those who are comfortable with monster blood flying everywhere should definitely give this a shot.  The MC looks like the siscon from Dance with Devils so there's that.
>> ARTICLE
I partially disagree with you on Norn9 and Prince of Stride. For the former, having played the source material, I think it's doing a pretty decent job of balancing everything out. Trying to condense 9+ different routes' worth of story into an anime series isn't easy, and whilst it's not amazing I don't think they've done too bad a job so far. That being said, the characters aren't very fleshed out yet, and I'm waiting to see how they bring together all the overarching plot points to reveal everything. I'd probably give it a tentative consider at this stage, though after three episodes it's really hard to tell. The voice cast is also quite nice in this one, and despite one or two largish discrepancies (none of which are deal-breaking so far) it's sticking fairly close to its source material.

As for Prince of Stride, so far I honestly have a hard time recommending it to anyone. I was super excited for this one, as I'm both a huge otome and sports anime fan, but honestly, so far I'm struggling to pay attention to the screen when I'm watching it. The animation is gorgeous, but I feel it rushes too fast into action, and with such a huge cast nobody is really getting much time to be fleshed out or developed. I haven't played the game for this one, so I can't tell how well it's being adapted or what constraints this places on it, but so far I'm just disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it for someone's first sports anime (that place would probably go to Haikyuu!!)- it feels like it's trying to be Free, without any of the things that attracted people to Free (besides the shipping bait). One little thing that irks me is the colour scheme used. It's very vibrant and garish, but not in a good way. I can see what they were trying to do, but I find it really off-putting.

It's nice to have some choice for female fans this season, but I'm still a little underwhelmed by what's on offer.

Drop?! No way! At this point I *have* to keep watching to find out if the show will actually follow through on the sushi police being hypocritical assholes and getting what they deserve or not!

I'll be completely honest, I don't find Phantom World nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. Yes, it's generic as fuck, but if you watched any of the trailers then that was super obvious from even before it aired. It's a big blob of fanservice wrapped up in a nice bow, and a lot of the visual gags are very well done. 

I'd like to hear why people seem to hate it so much. Is it because it's by KyoAni? Is it because people genuinely expected something more and were somehow let down? I seem to be out of the loop here, as all the hate seems kinda silly and unwarranted, since the show never tried to be anything but stupid, well-executed fan-service to begin with. 
>> ARTICLE
It's because it's such of a waste of potential.  KyoAni has a huge budget but wastes it on shit-tier plot and shows, for fanservice .
>> ARTICLE
That's basically the "silly and unwarranted" point he was making. They can spend their budget however they like, you are literally judging the show by the studio making it, you are literally saying it's bad because the studio has a good budget and it isn't what you want them to make.

That's not judging the show, that's judging the show by the studio and EXACTLY what he was saying seems ridiculous.

It's a good show for what they intended to do. They didn't intend to do anything else, it's exactly what they intended to make and nails it for the specific genre and purpose it has. It might not be what YOU like, but it is exactly what it was supposed to be and high quality for its intended audience.
>> ARTICLE
I quite like Phantom World. It has an interesting atmosphere, and I like how it's generally quite well-researched. And the third episode actually had some character development, so it seems to me like it's going in a good direction.
>> ARTICLE

Definitely not because of that. If it was any other studio this trainwreck wouldn't have been half as popular.
>> ARTICLE
> It's a big blob of fanservice wrapped up in a nice bow, and a lot of the visual gags are very well done.

This is true!

The production values are off-the-charts (thank you, KyoAni, for all of your hard work!) and the fan-service, while copious, is smart in its own right (panty scene without showing them, boob-limbo, finger sucking for healing).

...But there needs to be a *bit* more than nice visuals and well-done fan-service. The plot is currently going nowhere and the characters, while cute/sexy/what-have-you, are not very promising. I need to listen to the music more before making a judgement on that, but the OP and the ED (besides the ED's dance which is, once again, more fan-service) are not *too* impressive, either.

> Is it because it's by KyoAni?

I think that is one of the main reasons. People wanted (arguably) the best animation studio to focus on/make something of the same caliber. People did not want them making a "fantasy school battle harem ecchi LN."

I do not mind myself. They can make whatever they want to make. And the way I see it, this is something different for them and therefore probably *fun*. It is nice to change things up time and again, and I am sure KyoAni felt the same way.

> ...since the show never tried to be anything but stupid, well-executed fan-service to begin with.

I agree with this, that the show should be viewed in this manner because (as you say) that is exactly what it is.

But again, I think there still needs to be more than what we have been given. There are a lot of episodes to get at that plot, to get at those deeper characters (I don't expect *super* complex characters, but I expect some care in their handling), but from what we have seen, it is really just a lot of fan-service without too much substance.
>> ARTICLE
>I'd like to hear why people seem to hate it so much.

Because people value different things in shows. I completely agree with you that Phantom World is a generic as fuck big blob of fanservice wrapped in a nice bow. In my opinion, this is a very bad thing for a show to be. As such I think Phantom World is a bad show. You (presumably) do not think it is a bad thing for a show to be, and as such you do not dislike it. That's really all there is to it.

I am *really* liking Erased and KonoSuba. For Rakugo, I just need it to get some conflict going. The characters are great and the mood it strikes is touching, but it needs some tension and emotion to start pushing things along. I am confident that will happen, but until it does, I am just liking Rakugo as opposed to really liking.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, I imagine KonoSuba will keep trotting around at its current pace. But with Erased and Shouwa, they have the potential to be something more, yknow?

>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime 2nd Season

I actually think this is a *great* opportunity for the show. Here we have a chance for Shirayuki to really grow as a character in my opinion and become more than her *almost* mary sue level. If the show was stuck solely focused on Shirayuki and Zen, to be honest the show would be rather stale. Izana bringing in the plot and moving the show towards a specific direction can further propel their relationship forward IMO. 

> Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) 2nd Season

Considering how you didn't like the first one not much to say other than it is basically more AssClass. 

> Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm

I really don't like air head MCs so I kinda dropped it after the first ep. Also the CGI is kinda meh. 

> Boku dake ga Inai Machi

Nothing else much to say other than I agree. Running in for top 2 of this season for me.

> Dagashi Kashi

I rather liked this show (Gundam references are great). I can't really give a concrete reason why, but I guess the comedy stuck with me and I do like the interactions. I really don't know what people were expecting in the first place, because I didn't know much other than Hotaru was a walking doujin and so far she's done pretty well at being that.

> Dimension W

My second running for Top 2 of the season because I absolutely *adore* the cyberpunk setting and plot line. I dig mega corporations that have a large control of the world built upon a conspiracy cyberpunk story. The heavy integration between technology and everyday life, the futuristic yet weird character designs and the dirty slums contrasting the high tech life. It all screams everything I love about cyberpunk settings and stories and both this as well as Bokumachi (and also Konosubu which is currently third) earn this season's "I'm turning off my second monitor so I can fully concentrate on watching this show"l.

Also I rather liked the characters and they have a nice contrast between each other. One is a android who wants to fit into society and be more human. The other is a human who wants to live on the fringes and generally stay away from the rest of human society. The ol' classic who is more human question has me invested in seeing how their relationship evolves as well as pretty much all the characters themselves.

> Durarara!!x2 Ketsu

More Durarara basically. 

> Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season

While I found episode 2 to be *incredibly* satisfying, I don't like where the show is going. And to be honest, the darker turn was a joke for me because the show does not do a good job of setting that tone. Reading the Berserk manga has me see Gate's attempt at being dark to look incredibly juvenile. And now the show is going away from what I liked most about Gate which is the large scale military conflicts between modern and medieval and instead basically going on harem adventures where I'm kinda meh about.

> Hai to Gensou no Grimgar

I wasn't too big of a fan of episode 1 but episode 2 had me all kinds of interested. The show does a good job of portraying what it would be like to live in a fantasy MMO setting as a bunch of low level scrubs and that is what really draws me into it. The characters are eh so far but it'll be nice to really see them develop. What I want most from  this series is to see the characters *break*. I want to see the *suffer* like they did with [](/s "killing the gob for the fist time"). I want their group dynamic to fall apart, maybe even begin to have bouts of insanity and loss of humanity. I want my fill of tragedy this season and Grimgar looks right up the alley to fill that (along with Schwarzkmarsken). Also I know it is cheap out of place fanservice, but I can't help but say [bless Yume.](http://i.imgur.com/9cK4io1.jpg) and all the other butt service in the show. 

> HaruChika: Haruta to Chika wa Seishun Suru

Discount Hyouka and Hibike crossover that I dropped.

> Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!

While Grimgar is basically a deconstruction of living in an MMO, Kono suba is full on parody. 3rd favourite of the season by far and I love it.

> Musaigen no Phantom World

I'm basically watching this show for fanservice and this show has been rather disappointing after episode 1 because there isn't much else that this show has going for it. There basically is no plot. The characters basically suck (literally in the case of Kirby-chan). I don't even know most of their names and I just refer to them as Fanservice, Kirby-chan, Headphones, Bunny ears, christmas cake, Yui and Mr. Exposition (because the only thing the MC does is exposition). I say fuck it just go full fanservice route because otherwise the show is meh. I honestly find Saijaku to be more enjoyable than Musaigen. 

> Ojisan to Marshmallow

Auto watch for me because it is adorable. 

> Oshiete! Galko-chan

Kinda dropped it because the humor to me was kinda eh.

> Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut

Well you know my thoughts already.

> Sekkou Boys

I don't think you can even judge this anime properly. It's amazingly stupid but fun.

> Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu

Ah yes, time to rip this one a  new one. This show was an utter snorefest for me. It is basically a discount Saekano. The main MC girl isn't Yukino 2.0, but discount Yukino who is essentially Aki Tomoya mixed with Katou's boringess. You can do boring deadpan characters like Katou if you can make the rest of the cast be eccentric and interesting like Saekano did. But this show doesn't work because the rest of the cast are just blah. Besides genki Kana Hana, the MC is basically your all around do everything nice guy. I don't particularly see anything to differentiate him from your generic nice guy MC is every generic harem fantasy LN battleschool adaptation. Both MCs might as well be planks of wood floating in an ocean because that is how interesting they are. 

> Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu

This one is not in my top 3 unlike most people as I can appreciate what the show is going for, I don't find myself really enjoying it all the time. It is a good show overall though.

I think people just wanted more "stuff" to happen. Hotaru is great and the candy is okay, but since not much else is going on, it can get stale (pun intended) pretty quickly.

This will be its chance to finally give its main, prominent characters some time in the spotlight! I think that at least deserves some credit.

I *think* based on the next episode preview, we are going to start seeing something like that happening. Hopefully it is not *too* messed up for the group, though. I like people to be happy, not sad. :(

I want it to be as awesome and funny the whole way through the season so that it can become one of my absolute favorites. :D

(That is jinxing it, but I don't care. KonoSuba is so much gosh darn fun!)

> I say fuck it just go full fanservice route because otherwise the show is meh.

When KyoAni *does* decide to make a full-blown "ecchi" series, it will be glorious and all of /r/anime will implode, due to both happiness and rage. :P

Only thing is that given what the show has been like so far, I don't expect there to be a lot of meaningful characterization and I don't expect them to change.

I wanted to give Rakugo a "Must Watch It." I really did. But I could not in good faith do so because I am just not feeling it from the show right now.

As a reviewer/critic, I can see its technical achievements across every category. But as an audience member, it is just not doing enough to capture my attention. I know that will happen later, when things start happening with the characters and [Rakugo Series Spoilers](/s "the show finally decides to go back to the present timeline"), but for now, my emotional investment in the show is low. Low enough for me to dock it down to a "Watch It."

As for Shoujo-tachi, that was another one where I was debating what to put. The third episode was not as strong as the first two, but I was enjoying myself a good deal with those first two that I gave it a slight bump up in terms of ranking.
>> ARTICLE
> I wanted to give Rakugo a "Must Watch It." I really did. But I could not in good faith do so because I am just not feeling it from the show right now.

I was actually really surprised at how much time they were spending on the backstories and thought maybe this would be where the show faltered.

I'm still all aboard after episode 3 because I love the way they've handled the storytelling so far, but with what looks like the introduction of a [](/s "love triangle, this might be dragged out for too long.")  However, I can also see it going the route of [](/s "this show was actually about Yakumo and Sukeroku the whole time,") which could be interesting with proper execution.


>> ARTICLE
> I was actually really surprised at how much time they were spending on the backstories...

Right?

I like /u/Sinrus's comment about disrupting the story/conflict so early and (as you say and he wrote) for *so long*. It is really weird to present these two interesting characters -- Yotarou and Konatsu -- and then not do anything with them for what is going to be three entire episodes.

I do like that Shin's character is [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "entirely in the past and such a big influence on Yakumo") and I do like the anime fleshing out Yakumo (and by "fleshing out" that is read "developing his character as much as the anime can probably muster."). I just need these past events to start meaning something to the characters and to the anime itself.

> First Spoiler

I want to guess that [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "it won't be a love triangle and that she will simply become Shin's wife and therefore Konatsu's mother. But the problem with that idea is that Konatsu has red hair, and since they parents have brown/black, I do not think it is genetically possible. But I am not a biologist so I cannot say for certain. :3")

> Second Spoiler

That *would* be interesting. I and everyone else would probably have to look at the anime slightly differently in order to look at it more "fairly."

Hrmm! Now you got me wondering where it will go. :3
>> ARTICLE
Maybe you should include another category in your next one like "highly recommended" and for shows like Rakugo and get rid of the "watch it" category and get a category that could fit in between highly recommended and consider it so shows like Shoujo-tachi and Rakugo aren't in the same bracket.
>> ARTICLE
Hey Banjo! Regrettably I kind of agree with your points about Akagami no Shirayuki's second season. I absolutely loved the first season, but this season does seem to lack focus a bit. Though [spoilers for first season](/s "it kind of makes sense that Shirayuki and Zen are somewhat separated for now, if we had Shirayuki x Zen moments every episode it might lose some of its magic, or at the very least we'd all die of cuteness overload"). But I still have high hopes that it'll get better!
>> ARTICLE
> Spoilers

I am so biased, but I want [Shirayuki Series Spoilers](/s "I want Shirayuki and Zen to have as many of those moments as possible. They officially become a couple and then are separated from each other? And on top of that, Obi goes with her, the character I hate the most because he makes it so ambiguous whether or not he has actual feelings for Shirayuki.")

Now I am slightly salty.
>> ARTICLE
He clearly likes her, He just suppresses it for the sake of his loyalty to Zen

When you step back and take a look at it, It makes him a damn good character

Quite a few shows you've missed Banjo. Maybe include another section in your OP with reviews from others about the remaining shows (stating clearly that these reviews aren't your own)? I just think a 'Should you watch this' should be fully exhaustive, and should definitely include some of the more popular ones you've missed like Schwarzesmarken.

That is not a bad idea, either. Ya'll are coming up with some pretty nice ideas around here.

I will, if nothing else, think about it. No promises, though: this *is* still meant to be a thread where I showcase my own, personal thoughts on the anime up to this point.
>> ARTICLE
Good morning Banjo,

> Akagami no Shirayuki-hime

Love this show, solid characters, good romance, great voice work by Saori Hayami, show looks pretty, Fukuyama Jun as Prince Raj is absolutely brilliant in his performance (he plays this type of character so well), one of my favorites of the season

>AssClass

Drop it :( Banjo plz, it's so good. No I actually kind of get what you mean. Don't get me wrong, The manga is absolutely amazing and I really enjoy the anime, but I can see some pacing issues in the anime at sometimes. This one is easy to judge though, If you liked season 1, you'll love season 2. The manga hasn't concluded yet, but it's looking to be one of the most satisfying shonen jump manga in a long long time if it keeps this up. The last year of chapters have been of top-notch quality and I have high hopes for the adaptation as well.

> Ao Kanata

It's cute, it's not boring, it looks kinda nice, it's an okay show in my opinion that's enjoyable but not amazing.

> Boku Dake ga Inai Machi

I think no one has any qualms about calling this the best show of the season (so far and excluding sequels). The voice work is mindblowingly good, and seldom has an anime had me in tears by episode 3. So, so good.

> Dagashi Kashi

It's like Non Non Biyori minus Renge, which makes it an okay slice of life. It was hyped into high heavens and I'm happy not to have bought into it because it's fun, but nothing special (so far). Saya best girl though.

> Dimension W

I don't know what I should do now with every strenght I can take to break enemies. Kyouma reminds us of Hei, so he's chinese electric batman minus the chinese and electric. So he's grumpy batman? Isn't batman quite grumpy himself at times? Anyway, love this show so far, probably my number 2 after Erased. The characters are fun, Loser is fun, the robot girl is HNNNGGGG adorable, what more can we ask. Oh right, the opening is really, really good (more good openins this season, as visible in your writing above).

> Durarara

Do I really have to repeat myself here? Banjo, you know how much I love Durarara. It's one of those series that I'll absolutely rewatch once its over. Let's just hope the ending is satisfying, I don't know how they'll do it, but if this season ends the show in a good and spectacular fashion this'll a 10/10 for me. Love Durarara. Also, Steppin out tonight by Flow has been on repeat all week for me.

> Gate

The Japanese army being bas-ass, animal ear girls, dark elves and PTSD all in one rushed story. We've talked about this on [your blog](http://thechuunicorner.com/2016/01/08/reviewdiscussion-about-gate-jietai-kanochi-nite-kaku-tatakaeri/) It's one of my favorite shows, but it has some problems that we can't ignore (as you said, not enough is known of the world). Still love it though. I love Rory, you love Tuka, can we all just get along?

> Hai to Gensou no Grimgar

This might start hitting the feels soon. It looks like a rough place to be and it's a nice change of pace after Sao, Log Horizon, No Game no life, Gate, KonoSuba.

> KonoSuba

talking about KonoSuba, I had ZERO expectations for this show. I went in expecting it to be crap, and i laughed my ass off so far. Brilliant comedic timing, great characters and the show knows exactly what it is, everyone watch this please!

> HaruChika

see what I did there, I switched 2 shows so I could segue from grimgar to konosuba. Impressed? No? that was to be expected. Impressed by this show? no? Good, we're on the same page. It's okay, I'm kind of interested in seeing how this love triangle plays out, but it doesnt look like that'll happen too soon.

> Musaigen no Phantom world

At least it looks pretty, right? right? A peeping tom phantom, KyoAni please, I had faith in you, I just watched Hyouka earlier this month, how could you do this to us. I don't like this one too much, but it looks so, so pretty. Also, reading in the comments I saw 

> All studios have their ups and their downs. I wrote about PA Works experiencing this -- GlassLip, Charlotte -- but KyoAni is the same way -- Beyond the Boundary (granted, BtB is nowhere near as awful as PA Works lows; plus, BtB has one of the best EDs of all-time! ) I think PW will end up the same as BtB: pretty average, but by no means horrible.

Is now a bad moment to say that Beyond the Boundary is probably my favorite KyoAni show? I see how the ending disappointed, and I agree to a point, but the premise, the characters, the soundtrack, I really loved that show.

> Ojisan to Marshmallow

This is almost as good as Danna ga nani. It's 3 minutes, just watch it people.

> Oshiete, Galko-chan

this show fails at being funny, sorry, but that's how I feel about it. I'll finish it (as I do with all shows), but I don't think its very good

> Saijaku something bahamut.

generic crap, watch for tame ecchi, stay for the hope of actual romantic development, be dissapointed in the end, I've seen it a million times now. A friend of mine ( /u/aturo ) pointed out that this is basically seikoku no dragonar reskinned.

> Sekkou Boys

This is just fun. It's not great, it's not bad, but I enjoy watching it. They give life to stone statues, which is impressive to say the least.

> Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu

Pretty good, I have to agree with you opinion completely on this one. Worth my time so far and a great watch.

> Shouwa Genroku

I keep hearing good things, but I dropped it after 10 minutes in. I might pick it up again, but it seemed like it wasnt for me.

Also, you didn't talk about active raid, are you not watching it? I think it's pretty decent (save for the Engrish).

Tried to keep this short because I had to work like 3 minutes ago (technically I can start when I want, but 3 minutes ago was when I wanted to start XD), but keeping this short didn't really work.

Have a nice day every one, let's hope this season delivers a lot of greatness. It has potential to say the least.

> The manga hasn't concluded yet...

A story has to end sometime, AssClass!!!

> Saya best girl though.

Not a bad choice (even if there *are* only two to choose from).

But Hotaru wins the duel, hands down!

> ...the robot girl is HNNNGGGG adorable...

I consider her *cute*, but not adorable. At least not yet.

> Do I really have to repeat myself here? Banjo, you know how much I love Durarara.

I do! :P

> I love Rory, you love Tuka, can we all just get along?

Best Girl wars never, *ever* end!!!

> ...and i laughed my ass off so far. Brilliant comedic timing...

Oh yea. The comedy is so great in this one. Cannot wait to watch the third episode when I have the time later tonight. :3

> ...I'm kind of interested in seeing how this love triangle plays out, but it doesnt look like that'll happen too soon.

At this point, I expect the show to not touch that subject in any serious manner. And if it *does* it is going to be at least a little bit awkward.

> Is now a bad moment to say that Beyond the Boundary is probably my favorite KyoAni show?

That is good! BtB deserves some love out there. If nothing else, the ED and the visuals are gorgeous to behold.

> ....stay for the hope of actual romantic development, be dissapointed in the end...

That is what will make me the saddest. :(

> I might pick it up again, but it seemed like it wasnt for me.

Rakugo (the show and the subject) is definitely not the most *entertaining* anime right now in terms of emotion, conflict, and general investment. But its technical aspects are crazy good.

> Also, you didn't talk about active raid, are you not watching it?

Not watching it. Ergo, no comment!

> Have a nice day every one, let's hope this season delivers a lot of greatness. It has potential to say the least.

You too, Fes!

And yes. I hope the same. :)

Hey Banjo, nice writeup. It's nice we agree on a most of the things, and even better, that there some things I do not agree with you (world would be so boring if everyone was happy go lucky no problem) - AssClass.

That being said I was hoping you would cover **Pandora**. I felt this one might be pretty controversial, considering it is cyberpunk ecchi shoujo-ai with terrible animation. Yet I feel there is something deep down most people don't see and I still cannot put my finger on it, something that might promise great yet cryptic future. We'll see.

Other than that, I'm still on the edge whether I should pick up DimW or KonoSuba (or both). To be more precise, I was on the edge with DimW, but your writeup made me start considering KonoSuba too.

[**helping**You're not](#breakingnews "Banjo")

I came here hoping for one of Pandora too! It's actually my favorite one this season, even though it is a bit weird. Nene's innocence is too appealing I suppose. :)

I think we agree on a lot more stuff this season, Banjo \^_\^. I still haven't gotten around to KonoSuba's 2nd episode but it was pretty funny indeed. DEEN is really stepping up this season.

Also, not including the [Rakugo](https://my.mixtape.moe/iianfk.webm) and [Dagashi Kashi](https://my.mixtape.moe/xlzacv.webm) OP songs in the top 3 is sad days.

That is awesome! I wish that could happen all of the time with everyone, but alas, opinions and such.

> DEEN is really stepping up this season.

They are!

KonoSuba and Rakugo are showing that they, just like every other studio, can create some really stellar anime.

> Also, not including the Rakugo and Dagashi Kashi OP songs in the top 3 is sad days.

So, I changed it this year!

Instead of "Top 3" OPs/EDs, I changed it to just one OP or ED from an anime. All of the ones I posted are not just really well-done, but they are also from completely different anime. That way, people are exposed to more anime and maybe given the final push to watch that anime they were on the fence about! :3

Lots of neat perspectives here. 

I'm fairly happy with this season. I'm watching 6 shows (7 once I catch up on Shirayuki-hime) and am very pleasantly surprised by both Erased and Rakugo Shinjuu.

Your top three picks are exactly the same and in the same order than mine, nice taste :D

With ERASED I really ride the hype train for first time, I watched Charlotte in my first season of airing anime and I got kinda disappointed with how it went, but this one has the potential to be my favourite anime, and it ending average would be so heartbreaking.

The first three episodes were the strongest I have seen, if it somehows keeps the level until the end ERASED deserves atleast a place in the top 10 of the anime lists.

KonoSuba just made me so happy watching it, hilarious fresh comedy and glorious rainbow puke, I honestly expected a quality drop from the brilliant first episode, but the second one was as good, I can't wait for the episode of today!

If erased follows the manga as closely as it does atm with all the important points (just streamlining the fluff), then it's going to be a pretty easy 9-10 from me.

Hi, Meta!

> Your top three picks are exactly the same and in the same order than mine, nice taste :D

Only the best of tastes! ;)

> ...I watched Charlotte in my first season of airing anime...

That was definitely some bad luck right there. I *think* Erased will make up for that, though. :)

> ...and it ending average would be so heartbreaking.

It would be. It is always hard to watch a show you want to be good, that you feel and know is good, not go where you think it should or reach the heights you think it could.

To be fair, Erased can still mess up at any point this season. But optimism in these situations is key! :)

> KonoSuba just made me so happy watching it, hilarious fresh comedy and glorious rainbow puke, I honestly expected a quality drop from the brilliant first episode, but the second one was as good, I can't wait for the episode of today!

That montage was great, and Megumin's introduction, "chuunibyou," and general antics were even better. I, too, cannot wait for the next and every other episode! :D

Thanks for commenting, Meta. I greatly appreciate it!

That joke was so good!

I loved the one somewhat after it where [KonoSuba](/s "he picks her as his one thing, and then he mocks and laughs his way to the other world. *And then* she cries hardcore when she fully grasps the situation.") So gosh darn funny!

>> ARTICLE
Lets compare the ones we've both watched

Aokana- Yep pretty much hit the nail on the head with this one, borderline drop it for me as cute but tropey characters aren't quite enough to carry it. Seems like a show I'm going to watch all the way through and give it a tepid 6 at the end of the season.

Erased- got to this one fairly late but folks on here were right, this is a good one, definitely a must watch. Mystery has me sucked in unlike....

HaruChika- strong first episode but has really fallen off for me the past couple. Mysteries are boring and plot for the past two episodes were essentially identical. Unless I see improvement, I think I'll drop it after tomorrow's episode. I am hopeful though, as last weeks preview seemed to indicate this would be some backstory for Haruta rather than a recruitment of the week.

KonoSuba- Must watch, talk about unexpected. I read the synopsis before the season and figured, "Well this is going a generic action harem show" To be honest, I don't mind those shows, they are my comfort anime. I was very pleased, however, this show is significantly better than that. While, no, the animation isn't top notch the colorful world and likeable characters combined with good, albeit dumb, comedy makes it my second favorite of the season.

Phantom World- Yeah consider it. Gorgeous show but story and character-wise it just isn't anything special. Ruru is pointless and annoying. Felt like the 3rd episode piqued my interest a bit more than the previous two(well the memory exchange through hitting heads was kinda dumb but I liked the rest) so maybe there's hope?

Bahamet- I might give it a consider it just because it's the only ecchi harem this season but there are just big problems elsewhere. Story and pacing are just absolute messes. Seriously, watching the start of the 3rd episode I had to go and check if I missed an episode as the cut from the end of the 2nd was so drastic. 2 cute girls(Lisha and Krulcifer) aren't enough to carry the show. I'll end up watching it all though.

Sekkou Boys- feels like this should have been a 3 minute show. Fine enough in small doses but even at 8 minutes it wears it's welcome thin.

Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu- favorite show of the season and unlike the reviewers I actually am digging the flashback.

Couple of other show's I'm planning on watching one the broadcast dubs come out: Snow White as well as Dagashi Kashi, perhaps Grimgar as well since the reception has been pretty positive.

Oh, definitely. I love the direction it has taken over the year, and love that everyone gets involved and has a great time reading and talking about anime.

My only hope is that I can put this together every season for the rest of my life. :3

I watched the first three episodes of schwarzmarksen and I feel like it was made as fanservice to Muv Luv Alternative fans like me. It is absolutely terrifying seeing the BETA animated compared to sprites in a visual novel. 
>> ARTICLE
My only complaint is that shouwa Genroku Rakugo shinjii wasn't given "must watch," because to me it's unequivocally the best show this season. I mean, don't get me wrong, ERASED is really fucking good, but it has the advantage of an immediate genre hook (time travel!), while Rakugo has to suck you in with only its characters and direction, and honestly, I think it does a better job.

Like, ask yourself, could erased convince you to sit through an entire five minute standup routine? Probably not. Rakugo sucks you the fuck into it though
>> ARTICLE
> Shirayuki  
> damsel in distress needs saving from her knight in shining armor
> Hope is still there

You make it sound like the anime is destroying itself with changing the focus for a bit. I must say that the character the focus has been put on isn't really a welcome one, but it surely isn't making the anime any worse. It's exploring more than just the Shirayuki/Zen relationship. We don't want it to become boring right?  
Also, It's Shirayukihime, Snow White, so you kind of should expect the fairy tale "damsel and knight" thing.

> AssClass

Getting very biased vibes here. I don't feel like your comment on it is very reliable with the waay you react to it.

> Cloudflow + Aokana

He really put on some rose colored glasses there. While it surely isn't bad currently, it has some of that generic stuff in there and the production values are good, but not excellent. Still, the show is not bad at the moment. Especially Asuka keeps me interested in the show. Masaya, while having that typical mystery thing, also seems interesting.

> Inami_pouch + Dimension W  
> Worst of all perhaps, is excellent skill with throwing knives, able to strike any target with unbelievable accuracy. Overpowered MC or overrated skill? Yawn

Ok, so he is good with throwing knives, which seems to be his way of fighting in which he trained to be good at. Does that make him overpowered at current times? No, not really. We still don't have enough material. Also, in an anime were a guy fights in close combat with robots, missing something has a high possibility of him dying. His way of fighting is pretty nice, don't put on your "Oh he's probably OP"-glasses. Remember he's one of the beasts.  
Also, we haven't really seen any true antagonist yet.

> Grimgar +  purplepinapples  
> Its pretty lacking in the directing department, especially fight scenes, and it relies too much on exposition. In my opinion, it fails to use dialogue correctly. In a show, you should be able to convey something with dialogue. Whether it be setting the tone, relationships between characters, advancing the plot, what have you. I didn't feel like the writing and the dialogue in this show was meaningful. It didn't interest me.

I don't think we are watching the same anime. The directing is very good. The fight scenes are realistic (Were you expecting some battle shounen stuff or something?). The dialogue and narrative is what has been setting the tone and showed relationships. I have no clue what you were thinking.


That's all.
>> ARTICLE
I don't see Bubuki Buranki or Luck and Logic.  Banjo, do you plan to watch them?
>> ARTICLE
Agree with most of these, though unfortunately I think I'll be dropping Grimgar after it spent literally half its latest episode on fanservice/talking about the girls' clothing.
>> ARTICLE
Here we go and as promised my other ratings for the shows I'm also watching :)

Ansatsu Kyoushitsu -> Watch it.  
To be honest: If you don't like the first season, you won't like that. If you like the first season, here is more of the same. Expecting big changes in the promise or the atmosphere is a bit off, as it would never happen. So it's more of a "Did you like S1?".

Boku dake ga Inai Machi -> Watch it.  
No "Must" because there were too many mysteries that fucked up, so while the first episodes are a "Must Watch" I would never give an mystery a "Must watch" until I know the ending.

Dagashi Kashi -> Consider it.  
Still think, this one would have done great as "Short series". The jokes just feel a bit dragged out over a whole episode.

Dimension W -> Watch it.  
I love the characters, the worldbuilding and the theme. The anime with it flaws not too much, but it has the potential to be one of the good shows :D

Gate -> Watch it.  
Same as Ansatsu. It's more of the same in the end.

Hai to Gensou no Grimgar -> Consider it.  
For the theme, it's a consider it. For the anime, it would probably be a "maybe consider it", because it's another piece full of flaws and missed potential.

HaruChika -> Consider it.  
I personally see more potential in it than in many other anime. Of course it's not a real mystery-anime, it's more of a popcorn-SoL with some nice additions. The characters are mostly interesting, the "love-triangle" with the teacher is something new and with a clear goal there is little chance, that the episodic parts are running nowhere.

Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! -> Must watch it.  
I go with the great perspective of this Totenkopfgitarrist O.o

Musaigen no Phantom World -> Watch it.  
It's a battle harem with absurd KyoAni production value. It's what it wants to be and whoever likes the genre should watch it.

Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut -> Consider it.  
It's the battle harem without absurd KyoAni production value and really bad pacing. It still has cute girls, ecchi-comedy and some nice looking ideas, so overall it's still an average harem-anime for fans of the genre.

Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu -> Consider it.  
Feels a bit like the second version of Saekano. All the meta-humor was there again, it's just more of the same with some characters, that could be interesting, but no clear goal, no clear pacing, and just more of the same everyone else did. Right now it's more like a filler until Saekano 2 is here... 


So that's all... and again way too much to write :D
>> ARTICLE
> Musaigen no Phantom World -> Watch it.

Yeah.. nah. Phantom world and BokuMachi at the same grade.. k
>> ARTICLE
If you would read the actual text, you would see, that Phantom World is a "Watch it" for fans of the Harem-Genre because of it's production value and that the only reason for BokuMachi to not have a "Must watch it" is the fact, that mysteries are easily fucked up at the end, while the first episodes are a clear "Must watch". 

So for people who have faith in mystery and dislike harem it's a "consider it" to "Must Watch it" and for me it's a "watch it" for both for these reasons.

Right now, it's less battle and more something else, but for me it's still quite entertaining. But it really comes down to whether KyoAni can do more than just showing their production value.

Well, I guess that is where we disagree. The source is just another mediocre battle harem LN, be amazed if it improves.

Bahumut was on a completely different level to Phantom world. Phantom isn't even very good on the level of this season, mind about last year!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I didn't read Phantom World, so maybe my hopes will be crushed :D

And for Bahamut... I don't know, the adaptation is quite bad in my eyes, uninspired battles, way too fast pacing, too much cut out. For me it's more or less an exemplar of what is wrong with many modern LN-adaptations and their pacing... but maybe that's just a matter of taste and expectations =)

You didn't read my part? :( Yes, I do understand where you are coming from. If you really want to wait and would like something to watch meanwhile, please have a go at Sakurako-san. It is a mystery, the ending feels pleasing even though there is a cliffhanger, but damn do the characters esteem mystery and are given careful attention, equal to the mystery cases presented.
>> ARTICLE
I read your part and I would agree with your opinion! Good job on it! :)  
I just answered to Banjos particular opinion to give my thoughts of the shows. Discussing every opinion on there would kill me (it's 3am over here :D)

Sakurako-san was okay I guess. I had some problems with it, but it was an overall nice product and one of the better mysteries lately. Erased will have a conclusion, so it's probably a bit easier to rate it afterwards as a whole product =)

So I've heard. But I don't really trust the director all too much. Maybe this time he'll finally learn from his mistakes?
>> ARTICLE
> The jokes just feel a bit dragged out over a whole episode.

I saw this being said in the threads and elsewhere, and I think I agree. If everything was quicker due to shortened times, I think that would help out the show. It is mostly due to the candy motif being so...tame. It is not exciting no matter how much Hotaru thinks it is, so when the audience is watching, it might be *interesting* to learn but it is not necessarily enticing (as candy normally is).

> ...because it's another piece full of flaws and missed potential.

I am curious to see where this one will go later on. I want it to end up being a nice show overall, but yes, it is not without its own set of problems.

> ...the "love-triangle" with the teacher is something new...

It *is* something new. So the anime not pushing it more or putting more emphasis on it is a huge mistake. Hopefully that does happen later on, but if it remains at the same level of "we will mention this every now and again when the teacher shows up for the one time this episode" then I do not think there is value in that.

> I go with the great perspective of this Totenkopfgitarrist O.o

Ha!

That's a way to look at it. I don't think, that the romance will ever be the defining characteristic as it's more or less impossible for them to end with the teacher. I just like the mix of this triangle, a bit of comedy, some relaxing puzzles and some nice themes. I see this more as a SoL with extra than something else...

> That is not a half-bad way of looking at this one. :P

Yeah, but it also has to do something better, to feel like a good anime. After the first episodes - some little scenes aside - there is nothing that is really better than Saekano for me.  
I just hope this one will grow for me over the season...

Rakugo imo is a must must watch. They establish the characters I need to care about superbly. They then use good camera work and music to really make the Rakugo engaging. You really can feel when a character is nailing it or when the character is bombing. I am emotional invested in seeing the ex gangster succeed due to how they present his personality. I want to the see the master background and his connection to his adopted daughter father's. Especially the adopted daughters dad and master relationships is amazingly done. I could go on but I think the main thing it has going for it is how well established the characters are and how you want them to succeed. 
>> ARTICLE
>The Underdog: AoKana

I want to believe in this one so bad (I did the write up for it, after all), but I'm not sure.  There are three characters in this one that absolutely need development to pull this show off, and the next couple episodes should be crucial to decide this.  

Interestingly enough, I never found Flying Circus *that* boring, but maybe that's because the characters maintain conversations throughout the sport.  Which are always adorable.

And then Erased.  Everything in this show is strong, but I'm remaining cautiously optimistic.  My issue is the main character.  The first episode portrayed him to be a deadbeat loser, and the second forced him to be a concerned kid.  His "Imtoocool" personality is in direct odds with his weird desire to help people whenever he travels back in time, and I desperately need some explanation.  Otherwise, this show is really good.  E: Disclaimer, haven't watched episode 3 yet.

Thanks for compiling the write-ups, Banjo!

I don't quite understand the conflict. He's a loser but I don't know if he's really a dead beat. He has a goal,  which is to be a Manga drawer/writer(?) and in one of the first scenes isn't he pretty much told he's talented but he doesn't show a unique voice, doesn't show himself,  and that's what people want to see? Seems he's more... Someone who has trouble opening up while dealing with constant soul crushing failure and rejection. He wants to matter but his results never seem to. The saving people seems to make sense to me in that context. He says the results of the rewind is pretty much always neutral or somewhat negative for him,  but I imagine he's not a robot,  there's some happiness and pride, derived from helping people,  saving their lives. Making a difference. Actually mattering. That whole jazz. 
>> ARTICLE
> There are three characters in this one that absolutely need development to pull this show off...

I feel that the only vital ones are Kurashina and Hinata, mostly because of their dynamic -- the former is the noob and the latter is the champion. That kind of relationship might be common, but it lends itself way to nice development for both parties.

As for the other characters, I do not expect a *lot*, but I agree that there needs to be something for Tobisawa and maybe even Arisaka.

> ...but maybe that's because the characters maintain conversations throughout the sport.

Chihayafuru, an anime with monologues for every duel, proves that even a sport about cards and poems can be intense and exciting to watch. Ping Pong The Animation is also somewhere up there in my Top 10 anime, but it relies more on visuals/movement to make it exciting.

To this end, I feel that when they are playing the sport, neither what they are saying nor what they are doing has any weight (and not because they are literally defying gravity). It might have to do with the lack of equal footing: so far, all of the battles have been straight stomps, leaving the losing side with no chance to win. That makes the duel too one-sided, and because it has happened every single episode with every single match, it can get boring to watch the same outcome every time.

> His "Imtoocool" personality is in direct odds with his weird desire to help people whenever he travels back in time...

That is a bit strange. Maybe he just feels compelled. Or those are the only times where he is truly needed. In his normal life, he is just a regular dude who is getting nowhere in life, but when those impossible situations present themselves, he takes the chance to prove that he is more than just a pizza delivery driver.

But please, go watch the third episode!!! :)

> Thanks for compiling the write-ups, Banjo!

Not a problem! It was a lot of work, but I am glad everyone is loving the thread once again. :3

Kurashina and Masaya are requisite, I just REALLY want Tobisawa because she cute.  That's why I'm sticking along for the ride.  They all cute.

>he has a chance to prove he's more than just a pizza delivery driver

I hope something like this comes out of his character.  I'm really weird about "writing the story for the author," I hate drawing conclusions unless I have some tangible evidence, however minor it might be.  But that would be a nice development, particularly if they go a step further and explain how he went from an apparently happy kid to a jaded edgelord.

Surprised how many Watch Its you gave out. Was expecting mabye a couple?

I'd give quite a few of those Watch Its as consider. 

Don't think I really agree with the must watch on KonoSuba though, its a decent light hearted mmo show, but to give it the same rating as BokuMachi... Yeah, not sure about that.

Overall, pretty solid list, I'd swap out Dimension W with KonoSuba for my top 3
>> ARTICLE
> Surprised how many Watch Its you gave out. Was expecting mabye a couple?

I was actually thinking I was being *too* harsh this time around; I thought I gave out too many "Consider It"'s. :3

> Don't think I really agree with the must watch on KonoSuba though, its a decent light hearted mmo show, but to give it the same rating as BokuMachi... Yeah, not sure about that.

Both are aiming to be and doing different things, but they are each excelling in their respective areas.

When I rate/write about/critic/review/what-have-you, I view the anime for what is, for what it wanted to be, and for what it ended up being. The *execution* of it all. Execution is number one in my eyes, and KonoSuba and Erased are nailing the execution!

> Overall, pretty solid list, I'd swap out Dimension W with KonoSuba for my top 3

Dimension W is a neat show, too. I am excited to see where Kyouma's and Mira's relationship will go. Hopefully a *bit* more friendly. :3

It does accentuate the dichotomy that much more.

(And you are not strange at all! It makes their relationship poised for change/development, as well as putting Kyouma's hatred of coils into physical perspective)

> Well, it is winter.

One year, every season will produce at least one 10/10 anime. And we will all pass out from happiness.

>> ARTICLE
Well I'm watching way too much this winter, might as well chime in. Feel free to reply if you want to argue a point about a show, there are very much my personal take on this season.

**Boku dake ga Inai Machi** -- Must Watch It

I hate to sound like i'm just bandwagon but really this show is so far amazing. Unless you for some reason really dislike serious anime I would recommend it above everything else this season.

**Dagashi Kashi** -- Consider It

Really isn't a show for everyone. It feels a lot like a SOL in the way that nothing happens, it's slow and not really exciting so if that sounds like something you wouldn't enjoy then stay away.

**Dimension W** -- Watch It

Personally I really enjoy the characters and story, although not everyone would agree. Some people find the characters rather annoying, the main character is rather cold and the girl is rather.. girly. If that description doesn't immediately turn you off and you like the summary of the show I would say give it a shot.

**Hai to Gensou no Grimgar** -- Must Watch It

So far my favorite series of the season. It's beautiful, the characters are the most real-feeling characters I've seen in a while, and they're taking a much grimmer and more serious look at the "trapped in a video game" idea. Kind of like BokuDake though it is pretty slow, which I think is needed to build the characters as well as they do but I have seen people complain about it. If you don't mind a show that doesn't move along extremely quick at least give it a few episodes.

**HaruChika: Haruta to Chika wa Seishun Suru** -- Consider It

Weird mix of mystery and music, which is strange but also is just interesting enough for me to not drop it. I couldn't tell someone to drop it, but it's a rather weak show this season that if it keeps going like how it is will be rather unremarkable.

**Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!** -- Watch it

A parody/comedy of the "trapped in a MMO" type show. Pretty funny so far and the characters are interesting, if you like the MMO genre it's a must, if not I still would say give it a try.

**Mahou Shoujo Nante Mou Ii Desukara.** -- Watch it

Extremely short parody on the magic girl genre. If you haven't seen a few of those shows I don't know if you really would enjoy it, but if you have it's a really cute short that you can blow through in no time.

**Musaigen no Phantom World** -- Watch it

It's stupid and they took the show a much less serious route than I expected, but I'll be dammed if I don't say i'm having fun. It's very much a show you have to realize is not trying to be serious, and if you can get to that point and don't mind the more ecchi scenes I think you'll enjoy yourself.

**Nijiiro Days** -- Watch it

It's boy falls for girl, and i'll be damned if it isn't one of the cutest romance stories I've seen. The MC is so damn cute and the story seems to be going places. Also has some good comedy, although it's not really the focus. If you like the romance genre get on this, if not you probably won't find it worth your time.

**Ojisan to Marshmallow** -- Watch it

Again an extremely cute show. If you want to see how to make a big, middle aged guy cute then here you go. If you like cute this show is amazing. Also nice and short, making it easy to keep up with.

**Ooyasan wa Shishunki!** -- Watch it

So much cute this season. Here we have a middle-school girl who is the owner of a housing complex. We watch our 20-something main character interact with her. It's adorable, crazy adorable, but that's all there really is to the show. Again a must watch for people who like cute, not so much for everyone else.

**Oshiete! Galko-chan** -- Consider it

Let's talk about rather awkward questions about teenage girls WITH teenage girls! Really odd show, I'm really only still watching it because it is really different than anything I've seen, but it's not exactly amazing.

**Prince of Stride: Alternative Airing** -- Consider it

It's a sports anime. Do you like sports anime? well here you go. Do you not like sports anime? this isn't going to be changing your mind. Not a bad show, but it's rather average.

**Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut** -- Consider it

It's you mech battle harem show. I would say the characters are pretty enjoyable, although extremely generic. Again, you know if you would like this show or not.

**Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu** -- Watch it

When I think about this show I can't really say anything stands out about it, but I do find it to be one of the more enjoyable shows this season. Group of high-school kids make a bishojo game, members of the club are rather diverse and enjoyable but nothing amazing. I don't know, I would recommend it if you like the idea for the show, but I honestly don't know if I could give you good reasons to pick it up.

I think I agree with pretty much everything you said, out of the ones I've watched at least. I think the only one that I differed with you by more than one "level" is HaruChika. 

One of the biggest surprises for me was that you rated *Kono Subarashii* so highly. I haven't gotten around to watching it yet, but it looked quite generic to me. Even my friend, who has seen it, tells it's only average at best.

> Although not having Galko-chan as a must watch is triggering me a little. ;)

If they start throwing romance into the mix, my opinion of the show will go up. Not to "Must Watch It" levels, but it will go up. :3

Totally possible.

Hopefully you are watching Marshmallow, too. That one is another good short this season.

Thanks again for your kind words, Red! :)
>> ARTICLE
One opinion of a show I didn't see in the thread yet:

**Mahou Shoujo Nante Mou Ii Desu Kara** (literally: "I've Had Enough of Being a Magical Girl")

I have to say, the show's sexualisation of the main character (she's something like 11 and drawn like that) is on the edge of making me too uncomfortable to watch - but that's likely the point. If so, the camera work undermines it quite a bit. If you can get past that, it's a cute well-drawn little self-aware comedy show about little girls with sudden magic powers. So far, that's *all* it is, but on the other hand it has episodes of just 4 minutes each (45 seconds of which is taken by the OP).

The top 3 of this season seems consolidated in Erased, KonoSuba, and Rakugo. I was waiting and watched with enjoyment the first 2, and now I'm placing Rakugo in the PTW for later.

And I can vote for giving a chance to Mahou Shoujo Nante Mouiidesukara, it's really a short anime, but it's not a bad parody/make-fun of maho shoujo. Personally better than Sekko Boys that has bored me really fast.

For the underdogs, Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu and Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm are two good choices, and I will not count out Phantom World yet. 

I will keep giving a chance to HaruChika. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually agree with almost all of your picks this time, except for your choices regarding Rakugo, which I'd bump higher, and KonoSuba and Grimgar, which I'd both lower into a "consider it".

Now, KonoSuba; For a supposed parody, it seems to be doing everything exactly the same as any other MMO anime. So far there was only one joke which made me laugh. The art *isn't* great. The animation is average *at best*. The characters aren't really interesting. I can already tell I'll get annoyed by Darkness. Chuunimage is the only one who's sort of okay, and even she's just a generic trope character.

As for Grimgar, it really isn't that good. This is another case of LN shitters hyping it up which led me to believe it might be better than it turned out to be (I've seen people make parallels between this and *motherfucking Berserk* for fuck's sake). All the characters are cardboard cutouts of various archetypes, the fanservice distracts a lot from the serious tone it tries to set up (and let's be honest, the fanservice isn't going away any time soon), nothing worthwhile has happened yet and the fight scenes are all over the place. It's already boring enough with the not-so-subtle *darkness* it tries to set up ("Goblins just want to live too, I feel bad" boo hoo) and the death flags are miles high. I haven't read the LN but I swear I'll delete my account if Manato doesn't die by the end of the season. Basically the only good thing about the anime so far is the artstyle.

**EDIT 31.01.2016: I FUCKING CALLED IT**
>> ARTICLE
> The art isn't great. The animation is average at best.

I am not taking offense to the art and the animation as everyone else seems to be. I find the art -- the backgrounds and the character designs specifically -- to be well-done, and the animation, while nothing insanely good, has numerous sequences that are animated quite nicely.

>  I can already tell I'll get annoyed by Darkness. Chuunimage is the only one who's sort of okay, and even she's just a generic trope character.

No way! Darkness seems like she is going to be awesome, and Megumin has "chuunibyou," so she is automatically amazing. :D

> ...the fanservice distracts a lot from the serious tone it tries to set up...

This is true!

> "Goblins just want to live too, I feel bad" boo hoo

Hrmmm!

I imagine (and I hope!) you have never killed a human before. Or more contextually, a human-like creature (say, a monkey). Given that, I think that you would have similar feelings of guilt and doubt when deciding to kill something that wants to live and has sentient thought like you do. So while we might not empathize with them, we can certainly sympathize with them.

> Basically the only good thing about the anime so far is the artstyle.

It certainly is a pretty anime!

Erased looks pretty good though looking at the amount of hype it gets I can't wait for it to fall flat on its face.

Great list!

I agree with almost everything, but I think that you are being a little bit too harsh on some things.

For example, the fanservice you mentioned in Grimgar is in my opinion that such a big deal as you are saying. I only remember the ass and the boob part, but it there is definitely not enough to make sure people should consider watching it or not.

*AssClass* is for those who like the first season, has some really funny moments and handles the far fetched plot pretty well. It's enjoyable but not amazing.

Dagashi and Phantom are great for just sitting back and enjoying yourself. Nothing really top notch but it brings a smile to your face once in a while and for those who like these kind of anime I say go for it.

I disagree the most however with you on Shoujo-tachi. I've watched all 3 episodes by now and I will give it some more, but it isdefinitely a *consider it* instead of a *watch it*. Characters are less original than the Phantom or Dagashi ones and a few times throughout the episode I feel like skipping a bit. It definitely has a few funny moments and it is nice to not be drowning in generic anime tropes, but it is not that great. 

The thing about the in my opinion unoriginal characters and a bit boring script is of course my taste, just like the good things I see in Musaigen and Dagashi, so I'd say it is on the same quality level as them.
>> ARTICLE
> I only remember the ass and the boob part, but it there is definitely not enough to make sure people should consider watching it or not.

Maybe!

But there *was* enough of it for me to make note of it. I like fan-service, so long as it does not outright take away from what the anime is trying to do (that is broad since it applies differently for different anime). In Grimgar's case, I feel that the fan-service is only hurting the story/characters, even *if* Yume's butt is a nice view. :3

> Dagashi and Phantom are great for just sitting back and enjoying yourself.

True! They are mostly there for fun and simplicity, rather than trying to be anything downright groundbreaking or interesting.

At least for PW, I need a *bit* more from its characters and from its plot. There is still time, but I need to see it sooner rather than later!

> It definitely has a few funny moments...

I found myself laughing quite a bit throughout the first two episodes. The third not as much, but that was mostly due to a final conflict before fully getting the group together.

But you may be right! Depending on how the story unfolds and the characters develop, this one can definitely turn out worse than where it is right now.

Thanks for your thoughts, qweiopasd. And thank you for the kind words! :)

Unlike both perspectives, I'm actually finding the long back story quite captivating and anything but boring. I don't think I'll mind it, even if it lasts for quite a few episodes (though I'd like to see what happens with Yotarou, too).   
Also, something that wasn't mentioned, probably due to being quite subtle (either due to the title being josei or the audience not being accustomed to it or looking for it) the subtle fanservice and designs definitely appeal towards the josei demographic. Although the show can appeal to all demographics and it's so well done so far for everyone to enjoy, I can clearly see why the josei tag is there after these three episodes.

I think Erased is definitely has the potential to become very popular and long-lasting. It completely sets itself above and apart from every other show this season with a different tone and mood. The show drew me in and I was completely immersed, a feeling that sadly has become less and less common the more seasonal shows I watch.

I really appreciate slow moving intelligent shows focused around characters, so I will have to get to watching Rakugo.

One thing I want to point out about Akagami no Shirayaku is that the soundtrack is pretty darn fantastic. I watched the first episode of the second season and really enjoyed it, but what I remember more than even what happened was how great the songs were.

Damn, I've only watch the first episode of this, have been procrastinating on getting to the rest of the series. It's sad to read that all the next few episodes I'll watch are some crappy flashback. With the material presented in the first episode, I honestly thought it was better than Erased.

Guys seriously, watch **Galko-Chan** it has that crude type of humor and its only 8 mins long so you're not losing much.

As for **Grimgar** its hard to solidly recommend. The first 3 eps are really slow, and most of the characters are bland so far besides Ranta and Yume. I suggest waiting till it finishes airing then watching.

**AssClass 2**, and **Haikyuu!!**, watch if you've finished and enjoyed the 1st season. There's literally no reason to drop these shows .

I agree with most of your post, but I'd like to point out one thing about Dimension W's MC.

In the manga of DW the MC is much more expressive and a lot of his character is shown in how he reacts quickly to certain things while trying to maintain this "badass" demeanor and image. It doesn't hold up too well when he goes through an outburst, but he does have his serious badass moments. I think the anime has foregone most of the outburst moments to make his personality fit the badass trope, and personally I don't like the change. There's a chance that they plan to change his behavior as it goes on in order to make it look like he's opening up because of Mira tho, so we'll have to wait and see.
>> ARTICLE

I never got a notification for being tagged (do you need gold to have that?) so I went through your history to find this~

Surprised you liked KonoSuba so much, though I guess a lot of people have really liked it. I've been enjoying it, and the newest episode was really picking things up. I would put it as a watch instead of must watch mostly because of DEEN. I was annoyed by quality in a few places and the obviously reused animation, but that aside it has been very enjoyable. 

Holy shit Erased has been great. I binged it in one day and now waiting for more :X

Grimgar and Dimension W look like something I should pick up or at least look at when I have time.

> I never got a notification for being tagged (do you need gold to have that?) so I went through your history to find this~

Don't need gold -- they changed that awhile back so that everyone could have the name-summon feature -- but I believe that tread bodies do not summon people. Or if there is more than three it won't. Still a bit unclear on that one. :3

> Surprised you liked KonoSuba so much...

A certain crybaby priest, a "chuuni" mage, and a masochistic crusader have something to do with that! :D

> I was annoyed by quality in a few places and the obviously reused animation, but that aside it has been very enjoyable.

If we are talking about the montage stuff, that made total sense. They were just trying to get across the notion that their lives became a routine of work, eat, (rainbow puke), and sleep.

There *are* a few faces or quirky animation movements at times, but I think it adds charm to this already charming anime. :3

> Holy shit Erased has been great. I binged it in one day and now waiting for more :X

Yea! Erased is awesome.

It is always interesting seeing an anime performing at such a high level consistently because there is always the thought in the back of one's mind that it can all go to crap in an instant. I do not think it will go that way, but we should all be wary regardless.

> Grimgar and Dimension W look like something I should pick up or at least look at when I have time.

Hey Banjo, did the latest episode of Grimgar do anything for you with regards to what you felt was lacking?
>> ARTICLE
> Hey Banjo...

Hi, James! :)

> ...did the latest episode of Grimgar do anything for you with regards to what you felt was lacking?

I do not remember saying that Grimgar was lacking anything. At least, I do not believe I said anything like that here in my thread. Were you possibly talking about Rakguo Shinjuu? That is the one where I have been most vocal about there being something missing.

If you *did* mean Grimgar, the show still managed to sneak in an butt shot of Yume this latest episode, and while the characters are still nothing amazing and the story does not have much to it, I am still digging the down-to-Earth presentation and feel.

If you meant Rakugo Shinjuu, I still feel the same way. There is still no major conflict pushing the anime along despite there being a lot of character conflict. I will say, though, that I liked this latest episode (the fourth one) a lot more compared to the third because it felt a lot more contained in its character conflict and pacing.

I hope that answer's your question, James! :3

Woops, I definitely meant /u/purplepineapples. Sorry, I've been up for a while and totally didn't pay attention to the fact that you had multiple inputs in this post! I totally get the fanservicey vibe from the first three episodes, it was *interesting* but I didn't feel quite invested, but upon watching episode four everything changed for me. It got a lot darker and a lot more real and kind of destroyed my usual expectations for an anime stuck in a game world or something similar.

Oh yea. [Grimgar Episode Four Mega Spoilers](/s "Manato's death I felt was handled nicely because, once again, they made it seem real. It was not drawn out, the reactions were 'right,' and it makes sense from a narrative/character standpoint. It is not the *best* death scene of all-time or even among the best ones, but that episode did its job well-enough.")

Erased and Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash definitely my two favorite animes right now. Mainly Erased, it just got to me so much and made me love it. I'd actually watch the entire thing as many times as possible if I had the time, but I remember a lot of it anyways because I loved it so much, so I'd rather not. Grimgar was cool, but I didn't like how it all seemed like the intro an anime, rather than something with more of a story like SAO, with more interesting action and such.

It is usually not a bad idea to wait a little bit between watchings of a specific anime, so I don't blame you. :)

> Grimgar was cool, but I didn't like how it all seemed like the intro an anime, rather than something with more of a story like SAO, with more interesting action and such.

I still have to finish Grimgar myself, but I see what you mean. It certainly has a quality to it that makes it seem like it is just scratching the surface of what it has to offer, both narrative- and character-wise.

>Grimgar

One thing and Mr. Pineapples is that the cinematography really is underwhelming. It is plain boring, and it doesn't help the fact that the world is harsh and the goblins are hard to slay. The battles are awfully done with no proper overview to where each character are in relation to each other, and every swing misses its hit. Camera quality wise, that is.

> Kono Subara 

> wonderful art

What the hell, Banjo? From what I've seen from previews, it looks horrible the animation and the background are mediocre. But I'm thinking to pick it up since people talk highly about its comedy.

> Musaigen

One thing I find awful about this show, other than its other obvious areas, is the colour choices. It looks too damn rainbowy. Who hired a unicorn to be in charge of the colours? It is sometimes way too flashy and confusing, ugly and just inconsistently attrocious, also what the hell is up with their clothes/uniforms/dress? Ugh. 

> Marshmallow 

Really took me by surprise. I feel guilty for loving it. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY!! WHY AM I ASHAMED TO SEE A BEAUTIFUL FLUFFY MAN GOING TSUNDERE-MODE WHENEVER OFFERED A MARSHMALLOW!? THIS GIRL REALLY LIKES HIM BUT THIS MOTHERFUCKER JUST IS TOO DAMN FUCKING DENSE AND HAS TOO MUCH MARSHES IN HIS BRAIN. THIS IS SO STUPID! Kyaah~~!

> Shouwa

I feel like you both are being unfair to this show. This is probably the anime of the season for me even though I don't personally like it. The cast is wonderful and the animation when they perform rakugo is damn superb. The cinematography, oh gosh it wets my lenses like Niagra falls to an elephant. The camera never changes its angle whenever they start the rakugo and changes whenever they start going into the story and shifting between characters. This show is damn intriguing by the cinematography itself. It wonderfully shows you with few shots of the audience how we as a viewer are to perceive this acting, whether it be good or bad. The best shot that I can recall is when they frame a woman listening/watching (?) the performance behind a screen. I have to admit it isn't my taste, it is rather unique and new to me so I don't find a lot of attachment to it, but that doesn't (let me reiterate :P) devalue its damn fantastic story telling.

Edit: 

>Shirayuki

I kinda feel different about the "quality" art and animation this season. The previous one was wonderful, but this season is really lacking somehow. I don't really know what it is, but it feels as if the quality of the animation and bg has detracted.

You're correct, there have been some gaffs in the animation this season (e.g. in episode 3 Shirayuki's dress no-clips through a table and chair as she steps past instead of flowing around them). The animation quality seems to be a bit lower, and they haven't had the big background/scenery vistas to emphasize like last season which might have distracted from this. 
>> ARTICLE
Another Perspective writer for Rakugo here. You're so right, the cinematography on this show is the best I've ever seen. The atmosphere that it crafts is flawless. My issue is, if the story isn't interesting then I'm not going to stick around just because it uses interesting camera angles. I have no intention of dropping Rakugo any time soon; in fact it still holds a strong chance of being my personal AOTS. But in order for that to happen, it needs to continue the story that was begun in the first episode. I hate to say it, but after two episodes of undramatic backstory, I'm more excited to see what happens next in Erased or Dimension W than to listen to a *third* week of Yakumo talk about the past.
>> ARTICLE
I understand very well your gripe with the transition between ep 1 and 2. I share the same feelings about that composition. I would've liked it to be an episode more and probably something that slowly leads to him having to tell about his story. I didn't like the sudden chop. I wanted the Mr. Former Burglar (?) to continue to struggle for perfection! Yeah, I think I didn't explain well enough why I didn't personally like it. It isn't something I REALLY want to continue to the next episode like Erased or Marshmallow does to me.

Good job on your perspective, by the way. :)
>> ARTICLE
> May I ask why, out of curiosity?

Sure!

There was a possibility that the first writer was not going to have his/her piece completed in time. So as insurance, I asked you to write one as well. In the end, you both got it done in time, so I put both up since you guys put a lot of work into them!

> The battles are awfully done...

Not that I want to make excuses for it, but this *is* meant to be realistic. In an actual, sword-on-sword fight, you don't get Fate/Zero Saber levels of sword-fighting, where both sides swing and swing and swing with amazing flourishes and cool moves. If I am not mistaken, most sword fights were usually thrusts and huge swings -- not very exciting, but pretty effective.

> ...it looks horrible the animation and the background are mediocre.

I think it adds a lot of charm to the show.

I do not consider the animation or the art horrible or mediocre. The designs are awesome, the setting is feel-good, and the animation is right where it needs to be (when Megumin uses her "explosion" magic, that looked great!). Check it out for yourself first. I think you will find that people are being a bit too harsh on KonoSuba's visuals. :3

> Who hired a unicorn to be in charge of the colours?

It is *Myriad Colors* for a reason!

> ...also what the hell is up with their clothes/uniforms/dress? Ugh.

What?! The designs and the outfits look great!

I am a fan of Mai's design and outfits myself. :D

> THIS GIRL REALLY LIKES HIM...

She wants his marshmallow, if you catch my drift. ;)

> It wonderfully shows you with few shots of the audience how we as a viewer are to perceive this acting...

Good point! I did not think about the camera being used in that way.

> ...but that doesn't (let me reiterate :P) devalue its damn fantastic story telling.

Oh yea, I agree. I think it is doing nearly everything correct.

Where I take issue is the lack of conflict. There is nothing currently happening that is pushing the characters or moving the story along other than just Yakumo recounting what has happened. This is all done to establish the characters and the setting, which is fine, but without the story having some kind of driving force, it does not have that same sense of tension or emotion to pull the viewer along.

> I don't really know what it is...

All of episode three [Shirayuki Season 2 Spoilers](/s "took place in an underground cavern, which is admittedly devoid of detail. That could have been it. :3")
>> ARTICLE
> From what I've seen from previews, it looks horrible the animation and the background are mediocre.

The visuals aren't the best, but beside the great reaction faces there are some scenes, where they really did put their heart into it and the details. They used what they for the best possible outcome, so while it's nor beautiful art, it's still a good looker, because it manages to distract you from the not so pretty scenes... :D

\# | Anime  | Text 
---|---|----|----
1 | Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu | AOTS by a wide margin. Excellent directing, scene composition, sound design, and character dialogue. | 
2 | Boku dake ga Inai Machi  | Great direction, good voice acting, and cool concept, but can get a little too heavy handed at times. High risk of plot issues because of the time travel element. | 
3 | Osomatsu-san | Carryover from previous season. Hilarious comedy sketches, wacky ideas, and even some emotional moments. Downside is no overarching story. | 
4 | Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans | Having a bit of identity crisis and animation issues. Episodes without Gundam fights are lackluster. |
5 | Dimension W | Fun sci-fi ideas and cool action scenes, but not much real substance or character drama so far. | 
6 | Akagami no Shirayuki-hime Second Season | Picks up where season 1 left off. Solid shoujo romance series with strong female protagonist. | 
8 | KonoSuba | Funny parody "trapped in an MMO" spinoff. Characters bounce off each other nicely and have good presence, even if the premise is super played out at this point. | 
9 | Heavy Object | Despite the very poor exposition episodes, this show has lively characters and over-the-top action scenes. Prototypical popcorn material. | 
10 | Dagashi Kashi | A few funny moments, but the pace of the show really seems to drag at times. | 
11 | Prince of Stride Alternative | Generic sports show about free running. Cool color scheme, but the characters are not particularly intriguing beyond their bishounen fujoshi stereotypes. | 
12 | Assassination Classroom Second Season  | Very good animation and crazy situations. Suffers from having a few too many characters, but is otherwise enjoyable to watch week to week. | 
13 | HaruChika  | School mystery show that doesn't really seem to be going anywhere. Brings up a few interesting ideas but tosses them away just as quickly. | 
14 | Active Raid | Generic robo cop show with a large cast. Has a few funny moments but is otherwise unremarkable. | 
15 | Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen | Not caught up with this one yet, but it suffered from going at a snail's pace. | 
16 | GATE S2 | Otaku militari propaganda pandering round 2. |  
17 | Musaigen no Phantom World | Not even KyoAni can save this lame premise. The world just doesn't feel cohesive and the characters are as generic as they come. | 
18 | Hai to Gensou no Grimgar  | Literally nothing has happened in 3 episodes. Most boring show of the season. | 
19 | Sekkou Boys | Meme of the season. The gimmick is already starting to feel old. | 
20 | Ajin | Have only seen episode 1 with bad subs, which turned a poor show into a bottom of the barrel show. I expect this one to rise at least a little bit once I watch the proper subs. |

I watched the first few episodes of the season but honestly have been on an anime hiatus save for FMA;B. I'm going to wait til next season before watching anything fully, but from what I saw the Kono Subarashi one was my favorite, and my least favorite was, surprisingly, Gate. Loved the 1st cour, but the first episode of this one was crap, followed by a great one. I want consistency.

I have been considering doing something similar in order for me to catch up on all of my reviews and writing. But the idea of missing out on airing anime and having so much fun in the community pushes that thought out of mind immediately. :3

> ...what I saw the Kono Subarashi one was my favorite...

I am *loving* that one!

So much fun and such great comedy. The dumb goddess the "chuunibyou" mage and the (I am guessing) masochistic beauty are going to make this season so amazingly hilarious. :D

Ajin (dropped, CGI just ain't for me)

Ao Kana (consider it, sport-ish comedy with mostly girls playing the sports)

Dagashi Kashi (watch it, superb animation, nice characters)

Dimension W (Amazing OP, nice characters, interesting story and sci fi)

ERASED (Must watch it. Watch it already, will you!)

Girls Beyond the Wasteland (consider it, animation isn't that high as compared to others. Similar to Saekano but I guess they'll actually pull off a game.)

Grimgar (watch it, most surprising anime here. MMORPG type anime given a new spin)

Kono Suba (watch it, really funny comedy, diverse characters, fantasy fun)

Myriad Colors Phantom world (Because KyoAni, that's why!, consider it, no story till now, animation as expected, Saori Hayami)

Ojisan and Marshmallow (watch it, nice romance comedy)

Ooyasan wa Shishunki (watch it, cute landlady goes to middle school and speaks fast)

Prince of Stride (watch it, sports anime, high adrenaline moments, parkour all the way)

Shouwa Genroku Rakugo (Must watch it, mature and amazing story telling)

Sekkou Boys( consider it, I'm just here to listen to Gintoki.)

Each show has literally only three episodes, shouldn't you make this once you've watched all of the shows you haven't dropped so you can actually know all of the material that's going to be shown?

Well, the reasoning behind this is a sort of "preliminary guess" as to how the rest of the show will turn out. A lot of people typically used the "3-episode rule" because it's about 25% of the show, and most of the time, large twists or developments have occurred and you can get a good idea of where a show will go.

Banjo does end up reviewing everything that's mentioned at the end, he doesn't drop shows (for some crazy reason)

Erased is clearly the top new show of the season. 

But there are other amazing continuing shows which you have not mentioned here - specifically, Haikyu! and Ace of the Diamond. Can we give them some love? The writing is good, the animation is superb and the characters are well developed and have great growth throughout the show.  

I feel like sports animes are some of the best, but most under-appreciated shows out there - like Baby Steps, Major, Cross Game, etc.  

There are also no supernatural, silly elements in the above-mentioned shows like special super moves seen in Kuroko's Basketball and Prince of Tennis - ability comes from practice, practice, practice.

I would also be totally, 100%, yak-percento OK with Japan never again making a harem show. Please Japan mangakas and light novelists, grow up and let your characters have realistic relationships.

Let's start with my controversial one. So I'm not really finding this that great right now-don't get me wrong, I think it's decent, but I've had problems whenever the show tries to go into drama so far. The problems I have with this show are somewhat complicated and numerous, so I'm just going to go through each episode and explain myself that way.

[Episode 1](/s "I didn't really care about the main character's mom when she died, or the main character enough at the end of the episode to find the climax exciting, plus I cringed hard when the main character ran from the scene due how much I expected that reaction and how cliche it felt, although I do understood why he would do so. Maybe I didn't like this because I guessed that the mom was going to die and he was going to go back in time-the first instance where we see his powers revolved around stopping implied death, and the mom pretty much had a death flag around her for her scenes-so I was subconsciously waiting for it to happen, but most of the appeal of a mystery/thriller for me is guessing what happens next anyway, so I don't really feel like I watched it wrong.")

[Episode 2](/s "I liked this episode quite a bit. It actually made me like the MC, his mom, and his dynamic with his friends in a very natural and relatable way, which is the method of getting me invested I like the most. On the technical aspects, I appreciated the claustrophobic snowy environment, the sound design, the great tone-setting music, the OP, and the way the characters moved a lot more than I did their counterparts in the first episode. I honestly can't think of any complaints I had that don't feel like shallow nitpicking with this episode.")

[Episode 3 trigger warning](/s "I don't care about Kayo's abuse. I can't take shows that try to make me believe in both its setting and characters in a natural, realistic way seriously when they introduce their antagonists as 100% evil people through aspects like") [their character design(spoilers),](http://i.imgur.com/tO8WJj2.png) [](/s "and having evil smiles while doing irredeemable actions to characters we're supposed to sympathize with without really giving the audience a reason first-Yes, I know the point here is that the reason is a mystery, but I can't take this mystery seriously when it's presented in this way in this kind of show, because it's like making me hate a fictional character by showing them kicking a puppy to me. Anyway, these tactics make me feel as if the show is forcing its conflicts onto me with no self-awareness, and unfortunately my knee-jerk reaction to that is cynicism and apathy for anything related to the conflict. I know this all probably seems petty, but I can't really help it being the way I consume media, and this completely ruined the Christmas tree") [scene(spoilers)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IOWdriKpZrg/hqdefault.jpg) [](/s "for me. Maybe it was wrong for me to have expected Kayo's mom to be a person more than she was an antagonist, but damn it, I wanted the show to be more subtle than that after episode 2 so naturally played out.")

And that's it for BokuMachi. I hoped I explained my problems well enough to not get downvoted.

**Dagashi Kashi**
__________________________________________________________________________________________

It's basically everything Banjo said for me, except without Hotaru being something going for it:

>Dagashi Kashi is supposed to be a story about candy, but this anime has only one (technically two) things going for it: cute girls. Hotaru, the candy-loving, happily-energetic, and crazy-sexy girl is the best part of the show, but Saya, the simple girl who makes a good cup of Joe, is not far behind. Beyond Hotaru and Saya, the anime quickly falls apart: the candy information is educational but boring, the comedy is not as funny as the anime thinks it is, and the rest of the cast is very forgettable. Contextually speaking, this ones store is lacking stock.

I still like Saya though, but I'm not going to watch the show just for her and I can't relate with the candy obsession at all.
__________________________________________________________________________________________
**KonoSuba, or the really long LN title show**
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Despite my snarky heading, I'm enjoying the show quite a bit. The animation sucks more than it doesn't and not every joke hits its mark, but I'm finding the characters entertaining, and the jokes that don't hit still feel like they're trying. Episode 2 was less fun than episode 1, but nothing nearly drop-worthy. I've also been following the manga of the LN for this for a while, and I think episode 2's effect seemed like it was dulled from my remembering some of gags from the manga.

_________________________________________________________________________________________
**Dimension W**
_________________________________________________________________________________________

It's... decent? I don't find Mira to be as cute as the show seems to think she is, and some of the sci-fi feels lolwut, but I kind of like the main character and his dynamic with Mira is nice and I *really* like the Bones-like aesthetic. It also reminds me of Cowboy Bebop in some respects, but it isn't like being reminded of Cowboy motherfucking Bebop is a bad thing.

______________________________________________________________________________________
**Sekkou Boys**
______________________________________________________________________________________

This wasn't actually as funny as it seemed it wanted to be, but it got a few chuckles and grins from me and I love all the voice actors. I'm only caught up to episode 2 though.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
**AoKana, Ao no Kanata No Four-Rhythm**
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Mostly picked this up because I remember the VN was fairly well-received. It unexpectedly reminded of Diebuster (which is far from a bad thing), but while I do have a bit of nostalgia for Gonzo, the animation is just too uninspired for an anime centered around flying and the actual characters are :/. Only watched one episode, not sure if I want to watch another.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
**Leftovers**
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Even though I'm 15 episodes in, I'm probably going to drop Utawarerumono for Iron-Blood Orphans. The former has been meh to mild dislike for me for 70% of its run, and what I've heard of the latter has a ton of things I like.

Osomatsu-san continues to be weird and kooky in its 2nd cour. I'm not laughing quite as much as before, but the characters and show (and animation) now feel so much more realized than in the beginning that just watching them interact is fun in and of itself.

_______________________________________________________________________________________
**Shows I'm planning to pick up**
_______________________________________________________________________________________
#Rakugo!!!!

I heard so many good things about this that appeal to me that I feel guilty for not already having picked it up. Definitely going to try and find time to marathon what's out of it as soon as I can.

**Last Durarara Cour**

I barely remember what happened in the first cour, and I remember a vague feeling of 'I should know what's going on, but I don't' from the second cour, so I'm going to have to rewatch before I start on this.

**Grimgar**

Part of the reason I want to pick this up is because what I've heard of this has some things that appeal me, and part of it is because MAL, /a/, and r/anime have all had wildly different reactions to this.

**HaruChika**

Digi was pretty positive about it, and my general reactions to shows usually line up with his pretty well, even if the reasons for my reaction are mostly different.

**Phantom World**

I'm ~~probably~~ definitely not going to watch the entire thing, but I might check out episode 1 for the memes.

_________________________________________________________________________________________
Thanks for the write-ups, Banjo! I can't say I always agree with your opinions, but you always explain those opinions very well, and are very helpful and friendly as you do so. The "Another Perspective" feature is especially helpful for this season, since a lot of shows seem polarizing.
>> ARTICLE
> Episode 3 trigger warning

I do not think you are being petty at all!

I think it is perfectly natural [Erased Spoilers](/s "to want antagonists that are more than just 'super evil bad guys/girls.' I will argue, however, that the mom is definitely not the main antagonist, so her being just the cause for Kayo's abuse when she will presumably have very little to do with the story is fine in my eyes.")

> Episode 2 was less fun than episode 1...

No way! Episode 2 gave us [KonoSuba Spoilers](/s "Megumin, the 'chuunibyou' mage!") That literally made the anime a bajillion times better. :D

> ...and some of the sci-fi feels lolwut...

I myself smile when they show the "fourth dimension" as just the opposite direction of the x-axis (or whichever axis it is). :P

> ...the animation is just too uninspired for an anime centered around flying...

So much CG! Almost too much CG!

Thanks for your thoughts on Erased, rancame. I appreciate you posting them! :)
>> ARTICLE
>Erased Spoilers

Yeah, Erased has enough going for in the character dynamics and animation that I'm definitely not going to drop it just for a minor antagonist. I unfortunately probably won't be able to [Erased](/s "get into any of Kayo's problems that stem from her mom as much as the MC does though.")

>KonoSuba

Your Rikka is showing.^[:P](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/animevice/images/5/54/Megumin_the_Arch_Wizard_(KONOSUBA_Ep_2\).png/revision/latest?cb=20160121032151) Anyway, I think most of the problem I had with episode 2 came from me remembering the manga bits. Given how much of comedy is banked on the unexpected, I would probably have loved the episode otherwise.

True. Very true.

You rated konasuba and four rhythm way too high.

and konasuba isnt a trapped in a video game. Its a gamified world. And it isnt a parody at all, unless bad animation is what it means to be a parody nowadays.
>> ARTICLE
> You rated konasuba and four rhythm way too high.

No way! KonoSuba is *amazing* and Four Rhythm, while needing some sizable improvements, is not outright awful. :3

> and konasuba isnt a trapped in a video game. Its a gamified world. And it isnt a parody at all...

I consider it a "video game world" based on the quest they are on (killing the final, evil boss) the rules in place (leveling up, getting money from quests, etc.), and the characters (a party consisting of an all-rounder, a tank, a mage, and a healer). And *then* it makes fun of all of that, so I consider it a parody, too.

And the animation is by no means bad! The show has some very nice scenes and subtly animated sequences. And then the art! Don't discount the art since it achieves that country/fantastical/homely feel quite nicely. :D
>> ARTICLE
How exactly does it make fun of the gamified world in a way that isn't done by said gamified world shows? Comedy != parody. 

There are scenes in that show that look like they are reskinned DB Super keyframes.

How about this: what makes konasuba better (or even dramatically different) than DanMachi?
>> ARTICLE
> How exactly does it make fun of the gamified world in a way that isn't done by said gamified world shows?

Hrmmm!

Well, Megumin is [KonoSuba Spoilers](/s "a mage who cares more about topping the damage charts than she does sustaining DPS and actually being useful"), which I would say is a parody of most mage/caster classes. Then there is [KonoSuba Spoilers](/s "the working montage, where instead of going off on their quest and saving the day and becoming heroes, they instead spend multiple days doing remedial labor and partying and living a normal life"), which I would consider more parody. And then there is [KonoSuba Spoilers](/s "the first real joke of the series, where instead of saving the girl and dying heroically, he instead was never in danger and died in a fashion that can only be described as humiliating") which is admittedly not a parody of video games but *is* a parody of super-cool/self-insert-MCs that the "stuck in a video game" shows often contain.

Truth be told, "satire" might be a better word here, but parody is more or less a synonym. And given my previous examples (and the many more jokes and scenes already shown in these first two episodes), I would consider this anime a parody! :3

> How about this: what makes konasuba better (or even dramatically different) than DanMachi?

They are dramatically different in their approaches! KonoSuba is a comedy through-and-through whereas DanMachi was more dramatic in its events. Following this thought, KonoSuba's characters are charming and quirky -- they are not meant to be realistic or to be taken extremely seriously. DanMachi, however, had many of its characters that were designed with seriousness in mind -- Bell, Lili, Welf, and so on.

These elements make KonoSuba better -- the tighter focus ("it knows what it wants to be") and the better characters (relative to their respective approaches). Then there is the music selection (KonoSuba's ED is *divine*), the setting (again, the country/fantastical/homely feel is nice), and the "story" (KonoSuba is not worried about telling a dire tale but instead a simple one that capitalizes on its characters strengths while also keeping in mid its parody roots).

Technically DanMachi has better animation, but the character designs of KonoSuba are way better! Good details and symbolism on their outfits, as well as an interesting way to draw their mouths to add more weight to their expressions.

KonoSuba is (at least, for now!) *infinitely* better than DanMachi, and I hope my words prove so! :D
>> ARTICLE
Those are all really weak explanations.

theres nothing parody in making a few jokes.

and the characters are mostly really really weak right now. They're mainly just stupid above anything else.

all they did is take a heavy comedy approach to the "genre" (for lack of a better term) and have done nothing to parody it (and definitely not satire. Thats even further away).

of course I always hope a show will get better, but this one doesn't look very good. Its not doing anything original except in the very specific details of it.

The manga is great and this trailer is great, so I'm hyped...but the manga isn't over yet so I'm pretty apprehensive about how they'll end this.
>> ARTICLE
Well most likely they will end it when the [manga spoilers](/s "where culprit tries to drown MC")

On a side note, the Mom's voice actor fits her so perfectly; shows the strong, charismatic, and caring side.  Mom of the year material
>> ARTICLE
[manga spoilers](/s "She really did go from boring, annoying, and intrusive mom to best character really fucking quickly. Best mom indeed next to Wolf Children's Hana.")
>> ARTICLE
Been reading this one for a very long time. If adapted well, it has the potential to be one of the best in its season

I was kind of on the fence about this before, but now I'm definitely checking it out.

For all those that can't see the trailer, this is a solid mystery/thriller/suspense manga adapted by experienced staff, so definitely give it a shot if you're into the genre. IIRC, the manga is wrapping up just about now, so this won't be one of those infuriating incomplete adaptations.
>> ARTICLE
Man I'm unbelievably hyped for this show! After seeing it come up a bunch in "next season" kind of discussions I ended up trying the manga and binged it all in a day, and the previews so far have looked really promising. The new key visual is really good too imo, the tone and aesthetic that's been shown seems spot on.

Can't wait to see how it pans out! Only worry is [not really a spoiler, just being safe](/s "there isn't really a good ending point to adapt up to so it might be that it'll either feel inconclusive or end on a really big cliffhanger")
>> ARTICLE
I've only read the first few chapters of the manga, but if it's true the manga is about wrapping up, and say it will end at about 40 chapters, they could definitely adapt it all in 13 episodes, so ~3 chapters per episode with the first episode being chapters 1 and 2 ish since the first one is a long one.
>> ARTICLE
NoitanimA, so most likely 11 episodes only.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm if it's 2 short cours, I wonder then if they could do 2 chapters per episode and have it be a split cour or such.

Though I feel like (and hope) it's possible to fit everything in 11-13 episodes, without anything significant being sacrificed.
>> ARTICLE
The closest thing we have to a fairly conclusive point is probably somewhere around the latest translated chapter (c. 33)
>> ARTICLE
Yup and that's where I fully expect the season to end! But that presents its own problems as I was suggesting :p

AOTS calling it now.

That seemed to have an emotional punch, for me at least. This is the series I'm most looking forward to and I'm looking forward to the discussions about it.

Hi Chikumori, this is posted on *all* fanart submissions, so if you've already done what I'm about to ask, please ignore me!

We prefer if all fanart submissions contained:

You should never look up anything about a show you are watching, because you will see spoilers. Especially on wikipedia or youtube.
>> ARTICLE
Nor anything you're playing. I've managed to go totally spoiler-free before getting games, only to stumble across said spoilers while gathering info on their wikis.
>> ARTICLE
Like the time i looked up death notes ost.... damm the thumbnail and title videos of related videos.... I was only on ep 15.... so young and innocent.
>> ARTICLE
Wait, that's not common sense? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure YouTube spoiled Attack on Titan S2 for me. Retarded suggestion system.
>> ARTICLE
Ahehe, I first made the mistake of looking up character info on Wikipedia around episode 2 and got spoiled, then some YouTube comments had the same spoilers too.

Ah well, I warned some folks in the discussion threads, and I hope this message gets out there. Usually character profiles are only finished after an anime ends, at least to my knowledge. I wasn't expecting them to actually have entire details. Ruins the fun of who's the killer.
>> ARTICLE
Not only that but also when participating in discussion about it online like on here or MAL too because you will probably get spoiled by someone maybe even intentionally. I especially feel sorry for the people that post theories or find something cool and post about their thought and predictions.
>> ARTICLE
Those The Perfect Insider "predictions" though...
>> ARTICLE
Do people get a kick out of so accurately predicting the killer that it's as if they read the manga?  (Because they totally did)
>> ARTICLE
I think there's nothing wrong with trying to figure out the killer because that's part of the fun of mystery novels/shows but yeah their predictions were so accurate early on it makes me think they did read the novel/manga beforehand. That really took quite a bit of the fun out. Hopefully that doesn't happen this time.

Why, in a thread about avoiding spoilers, would you put an untagged spoiler about a character's death?

Just yesterday I Googled the name of a character someone mentioned to remember who it was and the first result before pictures was an excerpt from the Wikia that spoiled an unrelated character's death
>> ARTICLE
In the example of One Piece there's even a movie which has a spoiler in its official title.

I don't watch the Show, but I noticed that a while ago.

Edit: It's an ova in movie length, not an actual movie.

Which one? 
>> ARTICLE
Just look it up on Wikipedia ("One Piece movie list" or sth), it's easy to notice.
>> ARTICLE
[Spoilers](/s "the only thing I can see is Alabasta 'Desert Princess', but I'm not sure that's what you mean")
>> ARTICLE
Oh, nevermind. I just looked it up and it's an OVA in movie length (1h47min).

It's also known as the "15th Anniversary Special" -- i'll shorten the title to "3D2Y". The spoiler lies in the full name.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I made this mistake. Went "fuck it" and read the whole manga, and now I feel like an addict gone cold turkey. The whole month wait is killing me

Is the manga not finished?

Nope, it is finishing in March alongside the anime. The anime will be adapting the entirety of the manga as well as the manga ending. FMA:B and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso had this treatment too.

Same here. I even read the raws.
>> ARTICLE
damn if i knew how to read japanese beyond basic grammer and kanji.....

To be fair there are always spoilers in that section for anything on Wikipedia. Hell most the time they put more of the plot in there than in the actual plot section. Still, thanks for the PSA though OP.
>> ARTICLE
The same thing happened with Rokka no Yuusha and tvtropes, if you weren't careful several of the entries spoils who the traitor is among other plot twists.
>> ARTICLE
I wish this PSA was yesterday. Checking the wikipedia page for some date information, avoiding the plot section, and I end up getting partially spoiled by someone thinking it was a smart idea putting too much information where it shouldn't be. 

Oh well, I approve of this public service announcement.

I'm pretty sure th OP has a spoiler in it too (I don't really know, as I haven't read the manga).

>> ARTICLE
is it just me or there is way too much hype going on?
>> ARTICLE
Hype, very nice designs. 
>> ARTICLE
solid character designs, though the angular way their head is shaped at the top is mildly frustrating. still pretty excited for this regardless, given the good reviews of the source material.
>> ARTICLE
Excellent, it manages to be colorful and appealing while remaining faithful to the original design. Personally dig the way they did the eyes, they look realistic but still has a very slight cutesy charm. 
>> ARTICLE
My feels are ready!
>> ARTICLE
The manga is getting better and better so I can't wait for the anime to start.

They nailed the character designs for Kayo & Satoru, but they changed Airi quite a bit (to the worse if you ask me) but I can life with that.
>> ARTICLE
I found the manga by chance about a year ago, never thought I'd see it become an anime! I did enjoy the bits I read, pretty hype.
>> ARTICLE
Sleephit anime. the manga is very good
>> ARTICLE
The girls look different from the manga, especially Airi. But that just means the chara designer had a lot of work to adapt Kei Sanbe's designs. Looking forward to the anime!
>> ARTICLE
So I remember a while back when this was first announced I was interested in reading the manga but didn't get around to it for a few weeks and had forgotten the title but not the whole travel back in time and become a kid again part. So when I tried looking it up based on that the first series that shows up was [this.](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=72563)

Needless to say I was quite confused as to why everyone seemed so excited for this after I had read a few chapters of the other series and just assumed we had more lolicons than I thought.
>> ARTICLE
nah, the Mujaki anime hype train was *so [last year](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23423/Mujaki_no_Rakuen)*. 
>> ARTICLE
This show is literally why I hate watching as shows air. I run across a cool show, really impressed by it, then realize there's only a few episodes out. I think I'm ok and don't mind, but really I'm falling apart on the inside and can't stop thinking about it. Then every few weeks I rewatch all the episodes that are out and agonize over and over until it's over. Then I get sad and move on to the manga if there is one. 


So in short, I'm really impatient and the scum of the anime community. 
>> ARTICLE
What you should do is read the manga up to the end of episode 2, theres some new scenes( which IMO is better than how the anime did it) and it will help satify your manga urges.(I happen to watch episode 2 three times)
>> ARTICLE
That's a good idea. I'll definitely do that.
>> ARTICLE
Catch up to the manga, it's even worse. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I'm gonna stick to the little piece of sanity I have and attempt to be patient. 
>> ARTICLE
Join the party. After reading the manga, I'm hyped for the next 10 episodes.
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently fighting the urge to read the manga because the animation is just spectacular.
>> ARTICLE
Like many others, I snapped and read the manga after ep 2. No regrets. It's different! The art & extra scenes make it a separate experience to me.

And now I can appreciate all of the very smart adaptation decisions and the absolutely stellar directing a little more. There are even hidden easter eggs for manga readers, like [far into the manga spoilers](/s "where you can see the spider's thread over the mother's head in a scene in episode one.")With the manga ending right around or after the anime ends, we'll all be in the same boat for the last episode or two anyway.
>> ARTICLE
You're a better person than I. I read the manga. Kinda wish I stayed blind so I don't know what happens next.
>> ARTICLE
Aww don't say that. I'm sure you'd enjoy the anime just as much! I also envy the fact that you know what's going to happen x(
>> ARTICLE
I mean I'm gonna love watching what I read animates, but I'll just anticipate it instead. 
>> ARTICLE
I gave in and read the manga. Don't get me wrong, it's great, but I really wish I didn't so I could experience the anime blue balls! 
>> ARTICLE
You have dedicated commitment my friend. I couldn't last 5 minutes before giving myself in and reading the manga. I wish I didn't though, because I believe the anime has a lot of potential to be as great as the manga was.

It's so hard man. I've rewatched the 2 episodes 4 times now.

Not only the animation, but also the Voice Actors and the usage of "anime-only" methods like [sort of Episode 1 Spoiler](/s "the usage of both voice actors of the MC in the same scene")

should this be relabeled to episode 2?
>> ARTICLE
Well, the actual spoiler is about the ending of Episode 1 
>> ARTICLE
They didn't actually do what you said until. So episode 1 spoilers implies, if you didn't watch episode 2, it'd be okay reading it.

Anyways Im just being nitpicky, it doesn't really matter.
>> ARTICLE
I'm fighting the urge to read the manga too. I also thought that was a nice touch too. That's why I want to at least stay faithful to season 1 of the anime (assuming there'll be another season after) before diving into the manga.
>> ARTICLE
Resist the urge. The manga isn't finished and the translations are slow (behind ~4 chapters). You'll get to know what happens next but it still won't be finished.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I'd probably just be stuck in the same situation like a week later.

The manga raws are in the mid 40s but a chapter released just yesterday for chapter 35 :D

Wait seriously? Fuck. Hopefully the translations pick up as the anime becomes more popular and more people check out the manga.

This is the first show ive watched while its still airing and I'm really enjoying it so far. Can't wait for the next ep to come out

This anime was tailored specifically for people who enjoy that traditional supernatural mystery. We've lacked something like this all along and I've only come to realize it. Watching this was a pleasant surprise. I was engulfed in the true dark tones of death where other animes completely fail to accomplish.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not a fan of mystery shows, but I *am* enjoying the hell out of this one.  I think it's more the "supernatural mystery *thriller*" that gets me into something that a supernatural mystery alone wouldn't be able to.

Would you say Shinsekai Yori overlaps the genre somewhat?  That's one of my favorite shows.
>> ARTICLE
I never said you wouldn't be able to if you don't like mystery bruh, just that some of us have wanted this all along and we finally get it.
>> ARTICLE
You might as well add the psychological tag.
>> ARTICLE
I regret reading ahead.  Anime adaptation is actually a lot better than the manga.  Yeah, I didn't know I'll ever say that..
>> ARTICLE
While I love reading the manga, the Anime does such a FANTASTIC Job at building atmosphere, that the manga is looking dull in comparison.

Nonetheless an amazing source material just being made even better by top-notch directing.

I am way too attached to this story already, just give me all 12 episodes right now god dam it.
