This show and Erased are by far my favorites this season. Every single episode so far has been fantastic.      
>> ARTICLE
couldn't believe it is DEEN 
>> ARTICLE
Not only that, this season seems especially bad overall so far. Just these two bright spots, so it highlights them even more. I'm glad there's good carry-over from last season.
>> ARTICLE
Agreed!
>> ARTICLE
This show was on my "wait and see after 3 episodes list", but seeing this as the first comment made it a definitely watch.
>> ARTICLE
You know, Erased is going to get all the attention this anime season and most likely after as well, but damn if this show isn't doing its best to not only stay neck and neck with it, but eclipse it in some regards. So good.
>> ARTICLE
The way you describe it as "doing its best" makes it sound like a show doing some creative things but stumbling in others. The show is fantastic. It does character, dialogue, and atmosphere masterfully. Watashi Dake ga Inai Machi does things very well too, but it's not dealing with a pedestrian premise like this show. Even then the characters, particularly the kids, are way off. Not that they're not likable or written well, but they're not written as kids. They're like the kids from Shyamalan films who don't know how to talk like kids.

If Shouwa is reminding me of anything it's Sakamichi no Apollon. Normal characters, normal settings, but great writing, atmosphere, and playing with subtlety.

> The way you describe it as "doing its best" makes it sound like a show doing some creative things but stumbling in others. The show is fantastic. It does character, dialogue, and atmosphere masterfully.

I'm with /u/iverdawg honestly.  I think this show stumbles in some ways.  It spent way too much time during the first two episodes showing whole Rakugo sets and not enough about the characters themselves imo.  This episode was a big step forward and only *now* would I consider it on the level of ERASED.  Maybe by the end of the season I'll enjoy this show more, but after ep 2 I was on the verge of dropping Shouwa due to how dry/dull the first couple of episodes were.  Episode 3 actually shows the characters *living*, not just existing.

Shouwa is quite artfully done, certainly, but until this third episode it wasn't that *compelling* for me, to be honest.  ERASED was compelling from episode 1, even if it has some minor flaws.  At the end of the day, anime exists to entertain, not to be a painting on the wall to appreciate.

But yeah, this third episode was good for Shouwa, I enjoyed it greatly.  Hopefully they keep to this format for the remainder of the show.
>> ARTICLE
My same thoughts exactly on the anime comparison, but I feel like Shouwa will have a greater ceiling if they keep on doing their job.
>> ARTICLE
I honestly think that Shouwa is taking more risks in terms of being an anime by using a story that seems normal on the outset. It brings the focus towards the characters and their relationships, meaning that anything wrong with the writing will stand out like a sore thumb.

Erased on the other hand has the advantage of a supernatural protagonist and a very interesting and creative setup. Will that excuse bad characters? No, but it will reduce the emphasis on them in favor of the setting itself, which gives the writing some margin in terms of how realistic the dialogue is.

They're just very different shows. Shouwa's strengths can be summed up in that scene in the first episode where Kyouji is performing for 10 minutes straight. The writing, editing, cinematography, and characters are what hold that scene, and it does it amazingly.
>> ARTICLE
Same here, I am having huuuuge trouble choosing my personal AotS between these two...
>> ARTICLE
Rakugo might be a little more impressive considering it already had anime original content and it meshed together so well. While Erased is great, it did hurry over some earlier chapters.

Luckily, that isn't a problem at all for those of us who haven't read the manga =)

This show is so unexpectedly sensual. The way the bodies (and Bon's eyes!) are drawn is wonderful. 
>> ARTICLE
I suppose this is where I should mention that this is pretty much the mangaka's only manga which is not BL... (and let's just say it shows)
>> ARTICLE
Wait, this isn't BL???? Dammit
>> ARTICLE
Have any recommendations of what other works of this mangaka I should read? You know, for research...
>> ARTICLE
Heh, her BL style is not really one I'm into (our "moe points" don't really align, I love the art, though) so I'm not sure if I'm fit to recommend anything, but Itoshi no nekokke () seems to be a favorite with many people. I kind of liked her short story collection Nobara (), it's kind of like old-school shoujo manga except it's BL.

>> ARTICLE
[This frame right here](http://imgur.com/7QWUV63). Oh my god, it looks beautiful, this whole anime is wonderful! Can't get enough of it!

That's background worthy material right there.  Actually, fuck, that's worthy of a print on the wall.  Need to see if I can get a better resolution shot of it to frame.
>> ARTICLE
It was accented even more by the ominous noise in the background. Great shot.

>> ARTICLE
You almost forget some of the QUALITY that DEEN have made.
>> ARTICLE
DEEN can do pretty nice things, the problem is they're cheap and usually get saddled with cheap budgets. You can't do actual quality animation with shit animation budget.
>> ARTICLE
There's really only a few studios that land projects with an above average budget in a consistent basis. DEEN is a lot like other studios doing shows with a middling or low budget. They just had the misfortune of becoming a punching bag for the circlejerk. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a pretty good correlation there, but it's not a hard set law.  Lots of low budget things can look great.  See: every single Masaaki Yuasa show/film.  Honestly, nothing about this show particularly strikes me as high or even average budget either.  Lots and lots of still shots and slow camera pans.

The problem then becomes, if you operate on a low budget and want to make a good show, it has to become a labor of love - where the people involved worked their asses off for not a lot of financial reward.  It's a lot easier to do that when you like the source material and are passionate about your project.  But when you're the people outsourced to do someone else's dirty work (as is often the case with DEEN) then it's hard to love your work and give it 100%. 
>> ARTICLE
Let's  not forget that Yuasa projects have more time to cook up as well. Yuasa shows typically don't  have the same kind of production crunch many shows do. They even let some animators work an episode for a year+
>> ARTICLE
Well, Yuasa shows look great because they're Yuasa shows. There are not many people like him.

As for this show, it's not a story that needs a particularly large budget so everything is working out just fine I think. The director adds a lot to the visuals with staging, lighting, etc. People keep bringing up Kids on the Slope, where everyone praised Watanabe Shinichirou even though I think he barely added anything to it except for the performance scenes, other than those it was mostly just a frame-by-frame reconstruction of the manga, and you could tell that Watanabe's heart wasn't really in it. (From some comments I think he just agreed to make it so he could make Zankyou no Terror.) In Rakugo Shinjuu the director is a lot bolder, and the visuals are a lot more effective in return.
>> ARTICLE
We finally get the [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K28Lcc-MdJs) officially. (though it was the ending for ep 1) It's definitely my favourite opening song this season but it's no wonder I love it so much when Ringo Shiina is one of my favourite songwriters. 

I really enjoyed this episode again and it seems like Bon got better at rakugo in the years when Shin was gone so I'm interested to see how their skills compare now.
>> ARTICLE
A little confession: I wasn't sure about picking up the show at first.

Then I heard Shiina Ringo is composing the opening song.
>> ARTICLE
Shiina Ringo? I've been listening to her songs a lot lately.

Guess I'll pick this up!
>> ARTICLE
The singer is Megumi Hayashibara but Ringo Shiina Made the lyrics, song composition and arrangement and it's really freaking good like her songs usually are.
>> ARTICLE
Shiina Ringo wrote the song? Damn, now I understand why it's that good.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the op is amazing, and the op as well as rest of the ost really fits the show.
>> ARTICLE
Damn. My eyes teared up when I saw them come back

I think my reaction to that was 80% because of the music, it was obvious they were coming back else the narrative would make no sense, but the music fit so perfectly, going from solumn into uplifting in such a way I couldn't help but get a hit of feels.
>> ARTICLE
Same here. This show is amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I really love this time era. It has a really nice mix of modern western clothing and the classic japanese. 

Another anime that takes place 2 decades later and is also really good with two main bros would be [Kids on the Slope / Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon). 
>> ARTICLE
What year does the show take place in anyway? I'm talking about the main part, not the flashback, which obviously take place during the 1940s.
>> ARTICLE
Considering that the girl is about 25, I would say it would be around 1970
>> ARTICLE
I stand by this rec as well. if you like Rakugo, you're bound to enjoy Sakamichi. taken from my MAL recommendation:  
  
"Both titles are period dramas set in the Shwa era with a decidedly older (generally female) audience in mind. They both center around a group of artists engaging in a performing art while strengthening their emotional ties to one another. They also have similar aesthetic properties, such as plenty of pastoral Japanese imagery and a focus on body language as the main complement to their expressive animation. Though music serves different purposes in both titles, both titles feature a soundtrack that incorporates a fair share of jazz."
>> ARTICLE
You know, if you think about it...there wasn't a whole lot of ups and downs. Meaning: he didn't get married, he didn't date the other girl, the wife didn't die, the other two guys didn't die, there was no hardships in terms of war, the house was fine, he didn't struggle with his rakugo, there wasn't any lack of customers when they came back...no twists to make stories interesting. Things just *happened.*

But it was still so great to see, and so nice to watch. This episode felt long, but in a good way. I really got to feel that sense of time, and the way it picked up at the end when everyone came back, the pacing of this series is phenomenal.
>> ARTICLE
You don't need great external plot twists to make good material. The most important is that the conflicts would be important for the characters, and that's what the series is all about atm.
>> ARTICLE
> Things just happened.

Which makes it all the more relatable.
>> ARTICLE
Very insightful. Then again this is the story of the man who didn't go to war and was ordered to be safe in the countryside. It was the story of the man who was left behind. He didn't do the daring thing and sneak onto the train with his master. He simply did what he was told and went where it was safe.

Far less dramatic, but much more realistic and relatable. 
>> ARTICLE
That's how life is to me, so I could relate to it.
>> ARTICLE
But then you realize this all leads to Shin to die at the end. Im already feeling the feels. They had some Friendship. God, this is gonna be a tear jerker
>> ARTICLE
I'm still really not sure how he is supposed to die.

His daughter said he killed him, but I can't imagine that he would do that at all. 
>> ARTICLE
You can kill in a lot of ways, not all of them are physical like stabbing someone with a knife. You can  kill  by giving bad advice or by indirectly putting someone in a bad spot with your actions. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. It's also possible he killed Shin's rakugo career, which could have lead to his actual death.
>> ARTICLE
What if the "killed him" line refers to Shin somehow being disgraced from the world of rakugo due to (accidental) actions of Bon. Because Shin seems to live and breath rakugo, not being able to do it or being shunned from the community certainly would set up a scenario where the killed line makes sense.
>> ARTICLE
Which often is the case in anime like these, where the accusations are seemingly from misinterpretations or misunderstanding, rather than actually murdering someone. 
>> ARTICLE
"That's all I have time for this night, so we'll have to continue the story another night." I expected this means we'll come back to the present time, at least for a while, but from the preview for next episode, seems it's just a fancy way of saying "To be continued." Also, to get this out of the way as well, there were a couple of moments of stilted animation this episode (such as when Bon embraced Shin at the end) and a bit of off-model art (mid-way through the episode), but it was nothing major (nothing like Iron-Blooded Orphans), and the show's still gorgeous, with plenty of pretty shots and good design, but it was noticeable, cause it stood out to me.

Anyway, this really is a story as if told to a younger audience, and how memoirs and autobiographies go, which is nice, because this way it doesn't feel as if we're watching a show, but truly listening to someone tell us of his life. The narration is just a small part of it, but I'm talking specifically of the moment when he's walking back with his master from the Rakugo self-censorship meeting - he's telling us of (momentous) historic events, but he's tying them to his own personal plight, and that's the difference between autobiographies and histories, we tell of the big world, as it's reflected through our own personal lives, and how it affects *us*. I was also interested of hearing about it, so it seems this form of self-censorship to try and appease the external would-be-censors is universal. American comics (and television?) also had this.

I liked him commenting on the "stray cat" metaphor - because this wasn't a visual-only metaphor, but an actual textual metaphor within the story, and characters can parse these things as well. But do note the implicit metaphor later - Bon was abandoned by his first girlfriend, just as he later abandoned his second. Relationships are bound by a time and place, and when the time and place shift, they end. Yes, the Master and his wife, and Bon and Shin are the exception, but they still resume those relationships by returning to the same place. Some people are bound, such as the girl who had to go back to her family's place, or the girl he then left behind. He's grown accustomed to some relationships as only a temporary thing, a way to pass the time. He's grown accustomed enough to being left behind, but also to leaving others behind.

The final thing I want to point out is that in his performances during Shin and the Master's absence, people actually laughed at his performances. It's because he played with a smile on his face, and a smile on his heart. Did Rakugo really take a place in his heart, or was it a way to relive his time with Shin? I suspect the latter, but it came out, and others had seen it through.

Oh, I guess I did forget one other moment that stood out to me - [when Shin told Bon he sounds different](http://i.imgur.com/7TLmVhM.jpg), [not like himself](http://i.imgur.com/FUnbytA.jpg). When you think about it in the context of people who are putting on masks and portraying different people and personalities, that is so *weird*, isn't it? I know what he was trying to say, but still. Likewise as the episode ended, where Bon basically said, "I believed if I followed Shin's direction, I'd find my own path." Finding your own path and being yourself while following someone else. Following yourself while being someone else. Guess that's part of being a performer, or at least part of growing up.

> Bon was abandoned by his first girlfriend, just as he later abandoned his second.

How was he abandoned?  It was a mutual separation, they understood what was going on, the girls weren't shunning him.  The cat metaphor seemed like a pretty simple and on-the-nose reference to his parents, you may be reading too much into that one ;P

I do agree with the rest of your analysis though.
>> ARTICLE
How was he abandoned? He was left behind when she went back to her grandmother. Of course he wasn't *really* abandoned, but that's the pattern that was shaping up for him - people leaving him behind. I don't really see how you can not see it that way :P I mean, it wasn't spelled outright, but it was in the same episode, and within a short span of the cat metaphor, so it's begging for it to be interpreted that way.
>> ARTICLE
> people leaving him behind.

I think what has been described here as a pattern is more about his feeling of helplessness about the things he felt he couldn't help with, instead of being abandoned by people. Family system back then that the girl "had to" go home, his master's stubborn will on how to treat him and let him go to school (sincere but not what he wanted), his leg that he knew he could possibly put others in danger in a battlefield, the feeling of duty to take care of the mistress by cheering her up while also worried about Shin himself, the girl who likely had a crush on him but he wasn't in the position/status to take her when he didn't know what's gonna happen himself...
>> ARTICLE
Ehhh, the first girl, maybe, but the 2nd girl *he* left *her*.  So I doubt that is what they were going for.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I said in my write-up, that after he was abandoned repeatedly (by his mother, by his master, and by the first girl), he went on and abandoned someone else, which was the 2nd girl.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I know, I saw that, but I still think you're reading waaaay deeper into this than intended.  That's hardly a pattern, just the harshness of life which is more the point I think.  And his master didn't abandon him either, he came back, and he also explicitly helped him and tried to shield him, that isn't really being abandoned.

The only people that really "abandoned" him, as far as he knows, were his parents.  His first g/f was going to help her grandmother, not abandon him, she clearly didn't want to ditch him.

I just think your theory is tenuous at best.  Than again, art is open to interpretation, so take away from it what you will, don't let me stop ya :P
>> ARTICLE
I agree that the girl didn't abandon him and that he wouldn't think she abandoned him either. In fact, looking at how much focus the girls got in the episode, you can see that they didn't mean a lot to Bon (I don't mean that he was using them, just that they were nice but that was all.) Look at how the girl was introduced in the first place. It makes you think he wants to take a look at her finger, but he just takes the shamisen instead because that's what matters to him.
>> ARTICLE
[30 minutes into shamisen and chill and he gives you that look](https://i.gyazo.com/09912d0ef34f2155746020c4f353ed1b.gif).  
  
another excellent episode, and, going off on [my write up from last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4152xd/spoilers_shouwa_genroku_rakugo_shinjuu_episode_2/cyzrykf), one oozing with affectations left over from Kumota's days as a yaoi author. God bless. sometimes I feel a bit silly about being essentially fujoshi incarnate, because there are definitely a few crack pairings I've shipped that have little to no foundation and only exist out of necessity, checkmarks on my things-needed-to-enjoy-show quota ("Heinrich is obviously obsessed with catching Tenma cause he wants to *fuck* him. duh"), but with this show [the pairing basically ships itself](https://i.gyazo.com/800f155e5991c38908194d1dec35c16c.gif). sure there was all that dating stuff, but eh. interestingly enough, albeit not wholly relevant, there've been a few extensive studies on homosexuality in Japan and in Japanese fiction over the course of history, with [one particularly fascinating study by Iwata Junichi](http://onetwothree.net/writing/discourse-%E2%80%9Clove-between-men%E2%80%9D-interwar-japan-iwata%E2%80%99s-history-homo) written over the course of the Shouwa era, where these flashbacks (and presumably the whole show) are taking place.  
  
speaking of historical background, this episode actually contained a fair bit of interesting facts and direct references to real world incidents involving the decline of Japanese performance art during WWII. [these sections (pgs 109-114) from Barak Kushner's "The Thought War: Japanese Imperial Propaganda"](https://books.google.com/books?id=THKLxCJ9KHwC&lpg=PA108&ots=75ouUtb9TV&dq=%22the%20pacific%20war%20and%20entertainment%22&pg=PA109#v=onepage&q=%22the%20pacific%20war%20and%20entertainment%22&f=false) (sorry it cuts off there) describes the phenomenon well, regarding both the battlelines and the home front, and briefly touch on changes happening to rakugo during wartime (though mostly speaking in broad terms). Kumota did her research with this series and it shows, while Deen, musician Kana Shibue, and director Shinichi Omata (under the alias "Mamoru Hatakeyama") really did an excellent job at capturing the sights and sounds of the era, with their continued usage of pastoral imagery and traditional music to transport us back in time. a handsome production can only go so far without great writing and vice-versa, which makes this show such a wonderful thing considering the consistency and detail in both.  
  
this is made even more successful, I feel, through the way in which these details are slipped in: information about the way performances are scheduled and the inner weavings of the theatre are glanced over because Yakumo is addressing Yotarou and he wouldn't need the explanations, yet information regarding the decline and rebirth of rakugo during the war was explained directly, because it's doubtful even he would know all that. *this is how exposition and worldbuilding is done well*, not with an inorganic and hamfisted "as you know" dialogue, but through speech that resembles natural human discourse. we have an elderly storyteller talking to his students, and it definitely comes across as just that. it's easy to speak through a vehicle in order to establish necessary background material, but to do so in a manner that intrigues audiences by leaving out just enough to make it captivating but not obscure is how it's done correctly.   
  
I'm not sure what else to touch on in this episode that hasn't been talked about by others already, hehe. I'll end this by admitting that I fucking teared up like a baby when Yakumo said "am I being abandoned again?" when a show's got me bawling by episode 3, it's a fucking keeper. I can see this ranking on my top 10 for sure at this rate.

Heh, Kumota's BL ways are most definitely not a thing of the past, she's still primarily a BL mangaka. Even this manga is not BL on a technicality I think... (given that somewhere along the line it basically turned into a Yakumo/Sukeroku love story, something I'm not really happy with, not because I have anything against BL but this is not really what I wanted from this manga)

EDIT: note that I'm being facetious... rest assured it's not a spoiler.

Dude, Kiku asks Yota to fill the hole in his heart left by Sukeroku, then in the flashback they put their futon together, hold hands, and whisper to each other until they fall asleep with their hands still entwined.  

How the hell is it a spoiler after this episode to say it basically turns into a love story between them? lol
>> ARTICLE
yea.. well.. that's friendship for me....

that's something that means they really care for each other that MAY could develop into love.. but at the current state is definitely not a -romantic- love.

Friendships can leave more heartache than romantic relationships imho.

No... as I said I was being facetious. It's technically a bromance. It's just that it's a very... heavy... bromance written by a BL mangaka, which puts things into a certain perspective. But it's technically a bromance.

seemed pretty "spoilerish" for me. But okay.

Not really! I read the manga first, and I actually thought the sexual tension would be between Yota and Yakumo. (I was kind of looking forward to it, too...)
>> ARTICLE
I think the dates were meant to enhance the feeling that Bon "goes better" with Shin. The girls didn't seem to matter much to him, and it was obvious visually and in the narrative too. They were glossed over pretty quickly, while we got to watch him hold pinkies with Shin while they were in bed. The dates make it so realistic though. I think this is how most men like Bon would have behaved back then in Japan.

I've never been a fan of historical settings or older time periods in anime, but this show is an exception. I've never been so fascinated to how beautiful the visuals of the houses and the types of clothes they wear during the Showa period. 

Probably my favorite this season next to Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi. 
>> ARTICLE
This show is so amazing. It's filled to the brim with emotion and love, between the characters and towards the art. This and Boku dake ga Inai Machi are definitely the best shows of the season because they hit the perfect combo, imo: very enticing storytelling and a great production.

Studio DEEN has shown us they can still bring a dark horse into an anime season.
>> ARTICLE
This was just another great episode I don't even know what to say. Usually when I find such a good anime I almost wish that I had discovered it after it finished airing so I wouldn't have to wait a week at a time. Yet this show has such beauty in the way it conveys the story and then the perfect endings. Waiting a week in anticipation for the next episode is made into an experience rather than a burden. Not many shows in any medium can do that.

This season of anime is insane. This and erased are two gems that have the potential to be one of those shows you recommend people to watch years from now. Then there are more than a handful of other good anime airing throughout the week.

>> ARTICLE
I'm in love with the opening. 
>> ARTICLE
This show, in my opinion, is the best of the season so far. It has such consistent quality... in everything basically. The characters are so memorable and their interactions so immersive and realistic. I feel the need to say: based Josei anime. (Also can we go back to the 47 minute episodes I need more)
>> ARTICLE
> is the best of the season so far

More than Boku Dake? I can't believe there is a show that is better this season, is Shouwa that good?
>> ARTICLE
Is more consistent at least than Boku Dake, which sometimes felt a bit rushed-up and weird in the way that some kids don't talk like they've got 10 years old (not in a bad way, but it doesn't fit you naturally by ear).

I would say Rakugo is the best right now, but Boku Dake is only a bit worse because of that. These two shows are the only ones that are worth a watch.
>> ARTICLE
Honestly it's in a league of it's own, while Boku Dake is great, it's very heavy handed in it's delivery and there is a lot of cliche in the way it's directed (although it's not really something people notice and really doesn't detract from the show much).

Could you please elaborate on that, I'm really curious as I was among those who did not notice.

In regards to the last scene in the hospital, no thoughts for composition and feeling? Cause to me that was set up to show the characters, Saturo's side is blocked off, it he doesn't have much freedom, it's a curtain used the block light. Airi side is open and free it lets light in and warms the air around her.  This is a great way to express the character personalities without outright saying. 

Anime loves it's symbolism, another great example of this is the tree used in episode 2 to show the barrier between Mc and Hanazuki, it symbolises the barrier she puts up and mc breaks that barrier while crossing over the line of the tree.

The direction in this show is well thought out and establishes a lot with just the angle of the camera. 

Edit: a few more; why the pan up to the bridge? this is the mc's pov, the sky represents his goal on life and the bridge is the block in place. 

The floating manga is his dream of being a mangaka, his failure frustrates him (torn pages) but it stays floating, he doesn't give up on it. 

I could probably go on for days but I think the little scenes say so much about the characters and prove this to be well directed. 
>> ARTICLE
The positioning of the characters is 1/1 the same as in the manga,([1](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/10596/001.0/compressed/qboku_dake_ga_inai_machi_c001_032.neuquant.jpg),[2](http://z.mfcdn.net/store/manga/10596/001.0/compressed/qboku_dake_ga_inai_machi_c001_033.neuquant.jpg)) that's what I meant, you're right about the light however. And I now do feel like my dumb jabs at that scene were mostly unwarranted, this is what I get for rushing things.

 But I won't back down, the general directing is either very safe (making sure to stick close to the manga) or uninspired, this is a disservice to the anime. The pizza place scene to me just shows that the director isn't considerate enough of what and how he's putting in the shot.

I'd love to do this properly once the anime is finished.
>> ARTICLE
It's not the same though, the anime angles it differently to bring the curtain and window into shot, as they have a lot more symbolism with the characters. It's a small hospital room and the director made enough of a change to make a meaningful difference without going overboard. 

And with the pizza place once again I feel your wrong. He is always shown within the frame of the door, showing he works there but never truly included within the building. Then we have the door shutting on Airi to put a block between the two of them, while she waits for it to open up again, once again alluding to the relationship of these two characters. 
>> ARTICLE
The problem was with the pizza place was creating an interior in the first place, the moment you do that you disrupt the story. In the manga co-worker-san was the ONLY tangible contact he had with his place of employment, I feel like that's a major change.

You're interpretation sounds too much like conjecture, but the difference between not having any interior vs. having an interior and another character seems rather obvious to me.
>> ARTICLE
> but the difference between not having any interior vs. having an interior and another character seems rather obvious to me.

Once again your not backing it up, I think your coming at this from a very personal opinion based on the way the manga portrayed it. But that is not a basis for bad directing, that is your bias with the way the manga chose to portray his work life. 

I personally feel there is more going on in the anime to get a feel for the characters, everything in the show is there for a purpose so far, any director that can give insight on the characters and relationships purely through the shots used deserves the props. 

One of the reasons I love Toradora! so much is it leaves stuff like this to be found, just little nuggets of information in seemingly unimportant places, this is something I feel Boku Dake does amazingly.

Having this discussion I may look at doing a write-up or video on the symbolism and shot direction used in this show, getting into the nitty gritty of it like this has give me a lot of motivation.

EDIT: Anyway this is too much of a discussion on Boku Dake in a Shouwa Discussion thread, so best to leave it there.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit different from the other commentors, as I'm a sucker for heavy drama and mystery, so Boku Dake has been killing it this season for me. The episodes take me on an emotional rollercoaster that just doesn't stop, and it really feels like a sliced up movie with its style.

I finally caved thanks to all the praise and watched the three episodes of Rakugo so far. It isn't bad, but the shows are quite different so comparing them directly would be meaningless. Rhis one focuses a lot more on the storytelling (quite literally), and while it doesn't have the pace and intensity of Boku Dake, it does what it sets out to do: tell a story, and it very much feels like being told a story to the viewer's perspective (That being said, these past episodes have literally just been direct storytelling). Its quite immersive, and it really sucks you into the art form of Rakugo, even if you are unfamiliar with it.

If I had to say, Boku Dake stands at the top of this season for me so far, but I can see the arguments for either one. I'll likely keep up with Rakugo for a couple more episodes, but it doesn't have the emotional pull like Boku Dake does (and I admit, am an absolute sucker for).
>> ARTICLE
It's the opposite for me! I don't like mystery anime at all- and heavy drama in anime leaves a bad taste in my mouth. With all of that, I still like Boku Dake, because it's a great show. I love slower paced character driven shows (based Josei) and everything is just so well done in Shouwa that it isn't really a contest for me. But Boku Dake is at a major disadvantage due to the nature of the show and my personal preferences. Still, we're lucky to start off the season with such good anime and I hope it continues!
>> ARTICLE
Definitely have to agree with the great season so far. Last season was the first where I kept up with airing shows, and only two (Owarimonogatari and OPM) as one was a sequel and one was a source material I already loved. Besides that, the rest looked a bit underwhelming to me. However, this season, that number has already grown to 8 titles, some that I love and others that have potential. Can't wait to see how it all progresses.

Also, watching the shows are only half the enjoyment for me; it's discussing here with others about what we like and don't like that really makes the experience for me, even if we disagree. Loving the discussion these shows are creating for this community.

Jesus, dont increase the number anymore, the moment you get past 20 shows theres no turning back.

I am having a bit of a time juggling it all so far, having to refer to the sub to keep track of when things come out, but with all the good looking shows and people recommending things I just couldn't resist.
>> ARTICLE
What are your 8 titles?
>> ARTICLE
* Boku Dake
* Rakugo
* Dagashi Kashi
* Kono Subarashii Sekai
* Dimension W
* Grimgar
* Musaigen no Phantom World
* Koyomimonogatari
* Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya (kinda dropped it after first episode)

Boku Dake definitely taking the top spot for me so far, while Phantom World and Grimgar  are on the near drop end (the art is whats keeping me in).
>> ARTICLE
They both have their equal good merits. But, I would say I'm more enthralled by this show than Boku Dake. 

While watching this show, I can say I literally do not want the episode to end, and when it does it just hits me "like its over what"  , you just get absorbed into the story. 
>> ARTICLE
This show needs more attention.

There isn't a single thing about Rakugo Shinjuu that I dislike. The presentation is incredibleart design, sound design, directing, all of it. There's so much attention to detail in this series from presentation alone, and then we *still* have the actual writing. Everything feels so well researched and thought out in terms of historical background. I felt the passage of time, I felt WWII-era Japan. The character interactions feel so natural, and there's a lot of chemistry between everybody. Even though we didn't get a full Rakugo performance this episode, we were still in the presence of a masterful storyteller the entire time as Yakumo seamlessly recounts his life story in a way that just draws you in seductively.

Speaking of seductive, how about that fucking OP?  
>> ARTICLE
This episode was soo good.  
Great to see Bon being lively and smiling.
>> ARTICLE
Does anyone feel like they can imagine Yakumo telling this story in Rakugo fashion? Like the idea behind Rakugo is that you tell a story in a fashion that makes the audience feel like they're there. In a similar way, this long flashback feels almost like a rakugo story telling.
>> ARTICLE
As if this weren't already the best show this season, here we get one of the more poignant autobiographies about WW2 that doesn't end in two children starving to death. I really love how this extended flashback is framed as him telling a story, because telling stories is *what he does*. And here, I think, is where we start to see him find his own rakugo. He's not loud and boisterous like Sukeroku, but more subdued, almost melancholic. Which makes sense, when he uses rakugo as a way to remember his friend while he's gone. 
>> ARTICLE
Another fantastic episode , that break from rakugo did Bon good. 
His life was 24/7 rakugo at that point , some time away was exactly what he needed to reflect on what he loved about it.
>> ARTICLE
I miss the 45min long episode that's how good this anime is. Should be in the top 5 of all time. So engaging, the characters are great, the music is great, voice acting is great, animation is great and the story is great. I think this show is actually perfect. I can't find a single thing to complain about other then I want the next episode sooner.
>> ARTICLE
I have never felt my heart suddenly lift while watching anime as much as I did seeing the four of them reunited. It's only been three episodes, and I already love all of these characters. This and Erased are easily the two best shows I've seen in at least a year. So far, at least, there's always a chance they'll fuck it up with a crap ending! =P

I'm so happy they actually have an actual [opening](https://streamable.com/yakh) now! It looks so great, and I'm in love with it. 

This episode brought a lot of feels for me. Seeing how Bon went through a lot, especially seeing his expression when he felt alone and abandoned when his master refused to take him along with Shin, really got to me for some reason. Also, I really loved how they showed how much Rakugo meant to him, how he was able to 'relax' while listening/reciting it, it was the only thing that lifted his heart when he needed it. 

I think it's pretty good that they're taking their time with the flashbacks. They already covered a good chunk of who Yotaro and Konatsu are and hinted over what sort of background they came from in the first episode. I think it'll probably tie up nicely and bring them back to the present when Bon slowly reveals how both of them relate back to him and Shin later on.

This show continues to be as engrossing as always. It feels so masterful in every aspect. The story isn't *just* good, it's also *very* well told, in a way that feels natural and really grips you. The visuals are great, with really powerful directing. The sound design, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent.

Criminally underwatched. I feel like this is just way too good, direction, animation, VA, OST, story, everything is on point and tops everything done before by DEEN, in my opinion.

I'm absolutely in love with this show.  
This is a great season in general, but this and Erased are just phenomenal in their own ways. I see a lot of people arguing for what's the best one, but they're so extremely different you can't really compare it.   
The way it looks I'll have two 10/10 anime on my list by the end of the season, and I just can't complain about that! :D  
I was really scared that the first episode would be great and that the show would lose its charm quickly, but it has held up the quality extremely well. I believe in you, DEEN!

I have no doubts now, this is my favorite anime of the season.     

Also they got me right in the feels when the two came back, I was almost sure the master would die in the war for some reason.

As flower language goes this isn't the most subtle inclusion - [a forget-me-not placed prominently between a man and a woman](http://imgur.com/Bte5jXE). Still, I'm always happy to see anime using established visual metaphors, and the way that it matched up with her later plea for him not to forget her was neat. Symbolism is just fun!

(NB: A Forget-me-not signifies "true love" in Hanakotoba).

To be fair, I don't think this show is trying to be subtle ;P

I was wondering what kind of episode this was going to be when they showed the date. They actually handled rather well and certainly different to what I was expecting.

Absolutely amazing show, I wonder if on the DVD/BR they will have full recordings of the VAs performing the full Rakugos?

This is one of those shows that I enjoy so much, that I almost have to rewatch it to formulate my thoughts on it. I get so involved in it that when I end, I couldn't explain how I felt about it, but I know it was freaking awesome.

I can't really say anything bad about the episode. The quality is consistent with the 2 episodes and that scene at the end with the hugs really got to me. 

I also wanted to comment on how I think that this show, more than almost any other show I've seen, is really good at conveying emotion without speaking. We don't have the exposition or inner monologue that we do with other shows, because you don't need it. I absolutely love that I can tell what they're feeling, by how they look, and I don't have information being forced down my throat all the time.

A splendid story. I like how old Kiku narrates this all.

The first girl was really nice. Though I don't understand why they couldn't be seen together because he was a low rank Rakugo guy.

This anime is definitely worth watching for those who want a calm and mature story.

>> ARTICLE
There is so much this show does well I struggle to find things I don't think were done as well as they could be. I'm down to a couple of moments where there maybe were slightly off frames but holy shit am I being nitpicky.

The grasp of drama this show has sets it apart from a lot of shows I don't like as much, I struggle to get through a lot of melodramatic shows because it doesn't feel as if they have enough weight to really get invested. The immediate scene following 'and then the war began' just feels heavy. Everything just looks dull and downtrodden and even the air feels like it has weight and it works, it really really works. I think the pacing is fantastic also, we had half an episode of his self reflection during this gloomy time and all it does is progress his character further in the story at this point.

I could gush for ages over this show. It's my favourite this season no doubt.

One thing that I have an odd perspective with is war stories. Considering I'm (mostly) British, I have no direct connection to either country or relation that I draw from so the way the pacific theater is portrayed from both sides in media is intriguing to me.

Interesting how the war had a much softer effect on the story than I'd expected.  No one died, no one was maimed.

I feel bad for those girlfriends Yakumo left behind.  He's married to rakugo, girls.

You might want to check out Senkou no Night Raid/Night Raid 1931. As you can guess from the title it's not really WWII, but it deals heavily with the Mukden Incident and the establishment of Manchukuo... (in a way because it's kind of an alternate history with people who have superpowers, but it veers back to real history by the end). It's very cautious about it, of course, but it has an episode that was not allowed to air (it was only streamed online) because it suggests that the Mukden Incident was in fact a casus belli engineered by Japan.

It's not the best anime I've ever seen, but it's pretty nice, and out of its 3 OVA episodes the last two (Devil of the Opium Den and the epilogue Panther in the Snow) are actually really good.

There we go.  *There we fuckin' go*.  That's what I wanted the first two damn episodes.  Don't waste half my time with Rakugo sets, show me the characters and their lives.  That's all I wanted.

I was considering dropping it after episode 2, but I think due to this third one I'll keep going.  I don't think I could ever rewatch this show because of the painfully slow and dull start, but now I'm actually starting to enjoy it because I get to see their lives and not just their acts.  If they keep going the same direction as they did with this episode, I may even love this show in the end and remember it fondly.

By the way, was that girl at the end the same girl from when Yakumo was in the country?  Or is that a different girl?  They look remarkably similar and MAL is no help in figuring it out.

well, personal taste is one thing, but you are complaining about the show *wasting half of your time with Rakugo sets*, while this *time wasting* is not a bug, but a deliberate feature.

Your complaints are kinda like complaining about ecchi shows for displaying fanservice and lewd jokes. They are definition of the genre, there are people enjoying it, if you don't like it you should probably watch something different. And it's a given you are going to piss off majority of people enjoying the show precisely for the thing you didn't like.
>> ARTICLE
"Rakugo" is not a genre, so it's nothing like complaining about fan-service in ecchi.  This show is a Drama/Josei, Rakugo isn't required for it ;P

And yes, I understand the show is about Rakugo, and I'm not suggesting removing their acts entirely because that would be silly and contrary to the entire point of the show.  However this is also a show about the *characters* and their love for Rakugo, not Rakugo itself.  It isn't a documentary on Japanese cultural art-forms, it is a show meant to entertain with a Japanese art form as the central driving force behind the characters.  Or at least, that's what I assumed it would be.  The first two episodes more seemed to disagree with me, but this last 3rd episode is more in line with my expectations.

I never even said the show as "bad" because of those first two episodes, I simply said I found it dull, which is a fair criticism of them.  If people in these threads can't handle that and seem to want to bitch and downvote over it, maybe this show isn't targeting the *mature* audience its josei tag would suggest.
>> ARTICLE
> "Rakugo" is not a genre, so it's nothing like complaining about fan-service in ecchi

I suspected that your objection could look like that, but I didn't want to insult you, assuming it. Because it's a stupid objection. Insert "baseball" instead of "ecchi" in my comment, if you don't know why.

>  I simply said I found it dull, which is a fair criticism of them

It's fair criticism only to a certain degree. You see, it's very clearly the case that exactly the thing you call dull, and for exactly the same reasons, is for many people the main selling point of two episodes of the show. 

Imagine there is a movie made by WW2 weapons enthusiasts, with significant amount of time dedicated to realistic depiction of military weaponry. And that many people enjoy this movie precisely because of these realistic depictions. Now you come along and tell them the movie would be better if it sticked to standard 'showing characters and their lives' and that realistic weaponry depictions are slow and dull. It's perfectly valid opinion as far as your personal taste goes, but it's not a fair objection - the whole point of the movie are those depictions, if you don't like them - watch other movie, not start bitching in the thread full of military enthusiasts.

>  If people in these threads can't handle that and seem to want to bitch and downvote over it

I didn't downvote you, but I think some people did because they found your criticism beside the point, exactly in the way I tried to explain.
>> ARTICLE
> I suspected that your objection could look like that, but I didn't want to insult you, assuming it. Because it's a stupid objection. Insert "baseball" instead of "ecchi" in my comment, if you don't know why.

Really?  Personal attacks now?  What are you, 12?  I've been nothing but civil and not only am I get downvoted by /r/anime users that are upset when someone doesn't like what they like, but I'm being personally insulted over it?  It is a very valid criticism, even if you wish to ignore the logic of it.  Yes, this is a show about Rakugo.  Does that mean there is some cosmic rule dictating it show the full Rakugo acts of the characters?  No, there isn't, and it would, in my opinion, be a better show if they didn't.  That is more akin to watching an Ecchi show and suggesting a better way to do the ecchi.

I didn't even bitch about it this thread, I said the show finally appealed to me.  Your entire comment seems to be based around the idea that I claimed this show was objectively bad.  I never did, I said I found the first two episodes dull and enjoyed the third one because they finally focused on the characters, that is all.

These discussion threads are to talk about the fucking show, and I'm talking about it.  I didn't enjoy the first two episodes.  It's a valid thing to talk about.  These threads aren't created just to heap praise on the subject matter, sorry I interrupted a Shouwa circlejerk because I wished the show followed a different setup.  Sue me.
>> ARTICLE
> Really? Personal attacks now?

well, it wasn't supposed to be 'personal attack', I didn't call you stupid, I called stupid only your objection. And stupid it is - differentiating between 'genre' and 'not genre' is too elusive to ground any counterargument on it - indeed there isn't any cosmic rule dictating shows about rakugo should display full rakugo acts. But notice there isn't any cosmic rule dictating 'ecchi' (genre!) shows should contain fanservice either. Let's look at baseball shows - some are showing baseball games in their minute details, some skip most of them. Both these choices are intentional (like displaying rakugo sets) - you can criticize show over making the first choice, but this is completely different critique than pointing out failures in execution. And if significant number of people like the show precisely for the first choice, your complaining about it comes out as misplaced.

> Your entire comment seems to be based around the idea that I claimed this show was objectively bad

No, absolutely not. You said you didn't enjoy the show very much because of very subjective personal preference, preference most of the fans fundamentally don't agree with. Once again - It's not the case fans like Shouwa despite the anime showing full Rakugo sets. They like it precisely because of it. Your objection isn't 'objectively invalid', but it doesn't make field for any real discussion.
>> ARTICLE
> Your objection isn't 'objectively invalid', but it doesn't make field for any real discussion.

Discussing what a show could potentially do better is a pretty wide open topic.  There's plenty of real discussion that could happen around it, including why people may feel I'm wrong, except no one did that.  Instead I just got snide remarks and people telling me how I'm stupid for interrupting a circlejerk...

Yeah, I get it, people in this thread like watching a fictional reproduction of the real-life art form Rakugo, but no one can explain to me why.  I mean, would these same people watch a show about a young trapeze artist trying to make it that displays a bunch of cirque du soleil acts for half of the run-time and call it amazing?  Why not just go to an actual cirque du soleil show yourself and see the real thing?  Would you watch a show about some guy trying to make it as a comedian and have half of the show be a shitty act by him?  Or just pay to go see a live comedian?  Or if you're really interested on a topic, why not watch a documentary?  This show is supposed to be character driven, so use the characters to drive it.  I don't want to watch a show about a bricklayer and spend 15 minutes watching him lay bricks because "art", I want to know about *him* and his ambitions, his life, his past, his future, his broken heart, etc.

Even Seinfeld didn't spent 50% of the show on Jerry's acts.

Don't take my word for it, but I'm pretty sure Google adjusts the numbers to be relative, so at any point the highest point on the graph is 100, and the rest are adjusted accordingly. 

Unless you were joking, of course! :) 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for explaining this actually; I was about to ask how it works! I was like "theres no way theres only this amount of searches; rakugo is quite the thing in Japan! maybe not crazy popular, but this really known comedian just become a rakugo artist a few years ago, that is bound to make a few searches more than 4 in a month!" :p
>> ARTICLE
No problem! :D I tried some other searches of varying popularity just now, and they all seem to fit with the theory. Again, I'm not 100% sure, but it's safe to say it's something like that, anyway. 

Oh, and... I also like semi-colons ;) 
>> ARTICLE
Haha, I do tend to use them a lot, and improperly, too... :p
>> ARTICLE
Too bad that popularity isn't reflected here appropriately in /r/anime.  Like, how is a discussion thread of Sekko Boys going to get more upvoted and comments than this show??  I'm not trying to shame or complain about taste here but how is there honestly that much to say about a 5 min short, shallow gag comedy???
>> ARTICLE
I agree, but isn't it obvious how? Sekko Boys is more accessible, readily digested (5 mins vs 40 for the first episode of this), the setting is insane, it has lots of memeable stuff (the MC reaction faces), and it *is* pretty good for what it is. So it's not that there is more to say about it, but there are vastly more people willing to do so.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's a matter of investment. Also the relationship of Western audiences with Japanese humour is... difficult. Most people would look in puzzlement and bewilderment upon both Rakugo AND Sekkou Boys - they just wouldn't find them funny at all, just weird. When you get into anime you may slowly grow accustomed to it. Something like Sekkou Boys at that point is more accessible, since it's basically "LOL SO RANDOM" comedy. But Rakugo is still quite obscure imho. I mean, if you take away the enjoyment of the performances the anime loses a lot of appeal. It's still a compelling story, sure, but you have to slog through minutes at a time of boring monologues to appreciate it. Personally I am loving it but I understand that if the label "not for everyone" applies to anything, it's this series. Whereas something like ERASED could be placed in front of any western audience and give them something they'd understand and enjoy, this is so deeply cultural that you really need to be deep down the rabbit hole to get it imho.

(still less than Hozuki no Reitetsu though for me. Never managed to get that show)
>> ARTICLE
Huh.  I wonder what happened in 2006
>> ARTICLE
A Rakugo themed magical girl styled anime came out.
>> ARTICLE
Hm, is it [Rakugo Tennyo Oyui](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2244/Rakugo_Tennyo_Oyui)?
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. It didn't  have a huge fandom, but people thought the premise was interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Omg. Yeah I'm definetly part of tht wall
>> ARTICLE
Interesting that Joshiraku had almost no affect. (2009-2013)
>> ARTICLE
There's also the fact that the Western market for simulcasts has been growing steadily as of late, and Rakugo Shinjuu is on Crunchyroll. That probably does a lot towards getting people even just randomly interested in it.
>> ARTICLE
I just checked what Joshiraku was, and seeing another bunch of moe looking girls as the main cast really doesn't makes me want to watch the show at all. Seems unappealing since it's all we see these days. Makes it seem like a slice of life comedy thingy. I can see why this one would appeal to more people.
>> ARTICLE
Joshiraku has some cutesy elements, but it was hugely meta about both Rakugo and modern humor. Really cutting comedy that fans remember and love to this day. If you expect just moe, you are in for a shock. It even does some interesting things in regards to spinning Rakugo conventions on its head.

Also, as well received as Joshiraku manga was, Showa Rakugo actually did win manga awards. So it had some hype for the anime coming in as well. 
>> ARTICLE
Joshiraku as a manga was fairly popular in Japan, which is why I think it's strange at how low impact it has on trends. 
>> ARTICLE
Its humor is very culture based.
>> ARTICLE
Looks can be deceiving. Joshiraku (the manga, that is) is written by the same person as Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, meaning that it's style of comedy is pretty substantially different from most other "moe looking" shows.
>> ARTICLE
Well it's a [pretty meta show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YamWNqHQvgQ).

Main cast are rakugo performers, but we never get to see any actual rakugo. I liked it.
>> ARTICLE
My exposure to Joshiraku is very nearly limited to that clip and [this remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7dmM-QMkmg).
>> ARTICLE
But that just seems like full comedy. If they're kinda making a joke out of most stuff, I can see why it wouldn't have the same effect. This show takes Rakugo seriously, so it made me wanna learn more about Rakugo myself.
>> ARTICLE
> But that just seems like full comedy.

It is. It's a dialogue heavy comedy so the audience can fully appreciate how cute the girls are^^tm
>> ARTICLE
Oh ok. Well that might explain why it doesn't make people as interested in Rakugo as a show that makes a big deal out of it like Showa Rakugo. I mean, up to now this show was 100% about Rakugo Rakugo Rakugo (and drama), while I would guess the other one has more breaking the 4th wall jokes, embarassing situations not linked to Rakugo, etc.
>> ARTICLE
Just wanted to mention that while thing about dialogue and letting the people enjoy how cute the girls are is actually a tagline of the show. The writing is very self aware. 
>> ARTICLE
Eh, they show bits and pieces of it, but mainly the action is what happens backstage in between Rakugo acts 
>> ARTICLE
[Here's an actual rakugo by Marii of Joshiraku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvFt-Qk_iU). Gotta love the references in this one.

That was completely awesome. So many good references. It's funny how they changed "kake soba" into "tobi **kake**ru **sho**u**jo**"

It's part of a drama cd.

after such a phenomenal premiere, I came into this episode with a fair bit of trepidation. will the artistry be consistent? how about the understated but rich animation of the different body movements? how would the story work in its split time focus? would the change in episode length have a detrimental affect to the pacing and story composition?  
  
thankfully, this episode showed that the show aims to stay the course and I'm more than okay with that. too often you see promising first episodes taper out and lose momentum in the quality control department, with lots of studios and directors using up all their assets to "catch" a viewer with their first episodes, and given the one-hour special we received last time, I was sure this was going to be the case, but wow, boy was I glad this wasn't the case. there wasn't a single ugly shot in the whole episode, and with all the delicate movements in the performances, I was actively keeping an eye out for any off-model shots loose framing, but there weren't any. it managed to look great and keep up that confident movie-level consistency that gripped me last week, and that's a blessing that I can't quite shake.  
  
speaking of artistry, many people unfamiliar with what the josei demographic entails were pretty thrown off last episode by the tag, but really if anything this is basically as josei as something can get, especially this episode. the character designs, modeled after [Haruko Kumota](https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=7795)'s work in the manga, are decidedly rooted in josei anatomy and usage of very angular construction, a mix of sharp lines and rounded curves to distinguish faces and bring out a personality just by looking at them. one look at her catalog reveals that her work has primarily been with "yaoi" titles in the past, and you can sort of see the influence here (the aforementioned attributes in her designs) and is sort of a consistent trend among the higher end of Josei manga-ka, such as Natsume Ono (Ristorante Paradiso, House of Five Leaves), Ichiko Ima (Hyakki Yakoushou), Kazuya Minekura (Saiyuki Reload), and Yuki Amemiya (07-Ghost). though you'd have to be looking for it for that to make sense, there's plenty of fanservice for The Ladies here that jumped right out at me, from the slight glimpses of Sukeroku's muscles slipping out from underneath his Kimono as he shifts about on stage to the slight yet intense glances of Yakumo as he shifts his glance around the room. it's sexy in strange ways, because its very subtle (well, most of the time, Yakumo going into the bath was a bit on the nose), but subtlety is what makes it sexy as well..  
  
the story this week was handled in a very eloquent and graceful way, and developed the central characters through slight pockets of information about their lives (where they came from, their circumstances) but almost entirely through just how they performed their acts. we heard the elder Yakumo call our Yakumo too tight and distant while we heard him call Sukeroku lackadaisical and flippant, but the way the music enveloped their scenes, the performances of the VAs with their line delivery, and the impressive direction of each transition shot, we could tell what kind of people they are by context clues and can form our own opinions of them, ones that adhere to his interpretation but are also influenced by the camerawork, the set design, and a bit of dramatic irony.  
  
for a show about people talking, there's so much "show, not tell" going on here that it's almost hilarious how that works out. and that's what makes this so great, but also puts me in a weird spot, the spot of "I need to watch the next episode *right now*, that was over too soon!" that I haven't felt in quite some time. here's hoping next episode is as great as these two were, we might be experiencing the birth of a masterpiece here.  
  
edit: anyone else feel really stressed out during Yakumo's performance by the way?? god that was nervewrecking.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't notice the fanservice you're talking about at all, but I'm in love with this show right now.  So maybe it reached my subconsciousness?
>> ARTICLE
I happen to love that aesthetic of Ristorante and even non Josei shows can use that styling for older male designs. I feel older male character fanservice is big in Josei, so it works out for shows that use older characters in general. Strictly fanservicey in a way, but it works through practice of the design.

Yeah, it could be seen as ironic that a show all about storytelling often focuses on showing us the character emotions than telling us all the time. Then again, I  guess Rakugo is all about the physicality and subtle timing and emotions. As all the sweating in the last episode has shown, this is actually a pretty physical craft.
>> ARTICLE
I definitely was picking up on the subtle fanservice and yaoi moments, but maybe because I am the targeted audience, a more mature female. This anime has everything I wanted and more.
>> ARTICLE
\#same. as a fan of period dramas and fiction surrounding an artform, this really scratches a lot of my itches, and as an older woman with a fujoshi mean streak, this *really* scratches a lot of my itches. this is doing to me what [Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon) and [Aoi Bungaku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7193/Aoi_Bungaku_Series) did in the past, and that's an awesome feeling considering those two are among my favorites. if this stays on the course it's headed, I can easily see it ranking up there as well, it's feels tailor made to my preferences haha.
>> ARTICLE
No shame with a fujioshi streak. I am always looking for anime with lowkey yaoi and shounen ai hints.
>> ARTICLE
> though you'd have to be looking for it for that to make sense, there's plenty of fanservice for The Ladies here that jumped right out at me, from the slight glimpses of Sukeroku's muscles slipping out from underneath his Kimono as he shifts about on stage to the slight yet intense glances of Yakumo

I'm no yaoi fan, but even I was able to pick up on the fair amount of female gaze here.  Not to mention that in-bed pinkie-swear in the next-episode preview.  It's kind of cute, in a meta way.  I'm imagining an anime fan, distaff counterpart to myself, enjoying this with a small grin at the hints of lewdness.  :3

>edit: anyone else feel really stressed out during Yakumo's performance by the way?? god that was nervewrecking.

Heh, for sure.  Flopsweat never felt so real.  ("Nervewr***a***cking", by the way)
>> ARTICLE
I never watch yaoi or yuri, but yeah even I noticed the small fanservicey moments like young Yakumo's luminescent blush at Sukeroku and the way he held his towel before entering the bath, though both made sense in context and didn't feel like they were thrown in to appease the viewer (the former because he was trying to hold in his laugh and the latter because it fits his shy and conscious personality). Though the bits about the muscles and intense glances definitely went over my head lol
>> ARTICLE
Well, considering how many in-yo-face panty shots and bouncing boobs we get, I'd say the ladies deserve to get this. Of course Bon and Sugeroku are so shippable it's not even funny XD.
>> ARTICLE
>anyone else feel really stressed out during Yakumo's performance by the way?? god that was nervewrecking.

And this progressively louder music. Yeah it was pretty stressful.
>> ARTICLE
Felt like a 10 minute episode, it went over so fast.
>> ARTICLE
I tough this whole rakugo business would bore me, my surprise when credits rolled  so early
>> ARTICLE
Yea same here, didnt think I would like it very much since its just very dialogue heavy. but somehow they managed to capture me every minute of it. I think the directing is very well done in this anime.
>> ARTICLE
Especially with the first episode being 48 minutes
>> ARTICLE
Gotta love the use of music in this show, both the actual pieces and the absence of music. I think its smart to let the rakugo go without music because then there's nothing telling how to feel, its all communicated through the performance. Makes you feel like you're in the audience. 

When his voice started fading in volume I thought that was a prelude to cutting after his performance. But no, his voice is drowned out by the increasingly fast piano to communicate how boring his rakugo is and how stressed out he's getting as he rushes to the end. 

Great stuff.
>> ARTICLE
It was like the buzzing in your brain when you know you're bombing horribly and just want it to be over.
>> ARTICLE
Dang I was expecting the whole show to have 45 min episodes. I was surprised when I realized I had been watching the first episode for 30+ minutes when Yotaro finished his performance. Guess I was captivated by it. I must admit there was great attention to detail. 

This is my first adult oriented anime without any supernatural elements. I usually don't enjoy drama, but let's see where will this go. Back to the episode.

EDIT: words
>> ARTICLE
This is a josei, not a seinen.

Seinen = older guys

Josei = older gals
>> ARTICLE
I thought seinen=adult. Anyway I didn't get the feel it was oriented for older women. Maybe it develops that way in the future eps.
>> ARTICLE
What would give you the feeling that it is oriented toward older women?
>> ARTICLE
 Romantic stuff maybe, dunno exactly
>> ARTICLE
josei is often a more mature and realistic drama/romance (compared to shoujo), but it doesn't have to have any romance at all; it really just means mature but perhaps a little too boring for most older men (so not too much action, more talking, etc.)
>> ARTICLE
Kinda strange considering that the Hidden Object Game genre, which I believe is targetted towards older women as well, is anything but realistic.
>> ARTICLE
It's the art and soft colours. The style is very common in josei works.
>> ARTICLE
Fun fact: this is one of the 36 josei animes listed on MAL.

Or so I hear, anyway.
>> ARTICLE
What? Sakamichi no Apollon is classified as "for older girls" as you say? I feel like their classification is a bit off...
>> ARTICLE
> Sakamichi no Apollon

Romance and Drama tend to learn towards the female demographic in Japan. 
>> ARTICLE
Huh. I think a lot of males also enjoyed Sakamichi no Apollon a lot though. Especially in the west where they don't classify this as "for girls"
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you (as I enjoyed the show a hell of a lot), but as I said, drama, romance, and character driven shows (that are slow burning in plot) are made for female viewers in Japan. Completely different from the West
>> ARTICLE
ahhh, i wish there was more josei......

it's my favorite genre yet it contains so little that i've seen all of them twice except that horror one, don't wanna touched it....
>> ARTICLE
There's too much stigma around demographic tags. People see josei as a tag and think it's "not suitable for a man". Screw that. I'm a married 37 year old father of two daughters and joesi is my favorite demographic/genre. If I don't have a problem watching joseis, nobody should.
>> ARTICLE
It's frankly a little hard to make the distinction between some of the genres because sometimes the only distinction that happens is in which magazine they run a manga under. Even shonen stuff could be strictly romance centric depending on the magazine it runs under. Some josei/shoujo material also could be action oriented too.

Either way, people making assumptions solely on genre tags are misinformed, because plenty genre stories often defy their own tags.
>> ARTICLE
Ya I watched all of Nodame Cantbilie twice and think it is a great show. I'm a 38 year old guy.
>> ARTICLE
26 year old guy.  Watched Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso as it aired, was pretty tepid on it.  Marathoned through Nodame Cantabile not too long after that.  I couldn't watch that show fast enough.  I should rewatch it sometime soon.  I know they're two very different shows with very different goals, but Nodame was what I had hoped Kimi no Uso would be.
>> ARTICLE
Ya it is also great there is so many seasons of Nodame. Now if only the would adapt the final 2  volumes of the newer manga.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think that's a stigma that exists.

*Maybe* against shoujo by boys.
>> ARTICLE
It exists, I've seen it. A lot of people are ignorant to the tag, which is probably better though.
>> ARTICLE
Unfortunate, if that's the case.

Tons of people love Sakamichi no Apollon and Nodame Cantabile on this sub, though. I've never heard anyone say "but that's a girl's show" or anything along those lines.

At the very least, I don't think that stigma exists on r/anime. Probably because nobody watches joseis anyway.
>> ARTICLE
People who watch it don't mind, obviously, but the stigma is there in that it prevents people from starting a show tagged as such. So you'll never see people in discussion threads blatantly say it, but it manifests by their avoidance of the show.
>> ARTICLE
It could just be that there are less people who like the genre. It's noticeably slower paced and I can imagine a lot of people wouldn't like that. Nothing wrong with not liking a genre. 
>> ARTICLE
Josei is not a genre, its a demographic.
>> ARTICLE
The one josei I ever hear anyone mention with any regularity on /r/anime is _Usagi Drop_, which is of course wonderful
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru is pretty popular as well
>> ARTICLE
Princess Jellyfish is mentioned regularly aswell.
>> ARTICLE
> I don't think that's a stigma that exists.

I've seen people turn away from shoujo and josei because they just assume that anything for girls can't be interesting.

>> ARTICLE
Yeah they're dumb. At least in most josei that has romance the characters usually have a relationship. Shonen and a lot of seinen blue balls like a mother fucker. Hand holding = lewd. Because that's as close to kissing or sex as you'll ever get.

Sweeping generalizations of course there's always a gem here and there.
>> ARTICLE
Which is unfortunate, cause there are some great series that get overlooked simply because of their demographic tag. Like this season's Akagami no Shirayukihime, which although has decent popularity on this sub, has nowhere near the amount of comments and activity in its weekly episode threads compared to shows like Musaigen or Gate. 

More love for shoujo and josei series or riot! ( 
>> ARTICLE
These characters, their facial expressions, body language, voice acting in and out of rakugo performances all convey so much, it's thoroughly, masterfully done. The fact that the show seems to absolutely nail its pacing and storytelling style, wrapped up in a thematic jazzy soundtrack, is icing on the cake.
>> ARTICLE
I'm a bit sad that that we wont get more 50 minute episodes,I'm in love with these short stories and could listen to them for hours.Gem of the season right here
>> ARTICLE
Man, I always feel kind of bad for actors who are asked to put in a performance where the script demands "Act badly", outside of a comedy context. Even looking back to when Citizen Kane made the rounds. Still, the actors for young Sukeroku and Yakumo get the raw essence of the style of their characters across. While it's a little 'cringey' to listen to them practising, the continuity between their performances this episode and those of their counterparts in the first episode is impressive. 

I just love the attention to minor details like the women playing shamisen behind the screens (while smoking, naturally). The whole show just feels so...*Shouwa*. If this is an indication of where Studio DEEN is going, I'm way more than happy to follow along.
>> ARTICLE
A lot of voice actors do say they flub the lines often in vocal performances, so maybe it is refreshing for voice actors to show off their rawness and afford to mess up a bit, even on purpose.
>> ARTICLE
> If this is an indication of where Studio DEEN is going

With all those memes of 'DEEN finds a way', I came to realization that with this studio in mind, their name means nothing when it comes to anime quality and with DEEN, you have to look at specific people behind the work.

They are so incredibly inconsistent that you cannot say anything about an anime by solely stating it's from DEEN. On one hand we have Fate Stay/Night and Pupa, and on the other hand we have Rozen Maiden 2013 and Shouwa Genroku. Let's glance at opposite side and look at KyoAni. KyoAni is extremely consistent. With every show, you can recognize recurring character designs, animation quality, direction, etc.

Not so much with DEEN. I would wary stating anything about future quality of DEEN works, and instead say that Omata Shinichi (Rozen Maiden 2013, Sankarea) does a great job directing it, Ishida Akira excels with his voice, etc.
>> ARTICLE
DEEN did hire a bunch of new talent these past few years though, and one could argue the studio has changed quite a bit through the years. Even Pupa had a master of anime storytelling behind it, but perhaps the source material didn't  leave much room for him to work his magic.

The studio also does a lot of genres justice it seems. Hence it makes the studio seem inconsistent. They can do great dramas as well as stuff like comedies and ecchi stuff too. 
>> ARTICLE
Was Pupa actually good? I kinda dropped it after the amazingly weird first episode.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's really short, its 3mins * 12 didn't do it a justice. The shorter something is, the easier it is to recommend. So I'd say go watch it and form your opinion. I think some group even released recut to a single half an hour episode.

And it was its downfall, really. It simple threw any character development out of the window and tarnished the source material when they tried to squeeze it into such a short timeframe. If it were a regular length series, It might be decent.
>> ARTICLE
That's because KyoAni does most of their stuff in-house while many other studios outsource the crap out of animation especially. 

A couple of other great works by DEEN are Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal and Angel's Egg. A lot can change in 30 years, just look at Gainax which is a shadow of its former self. 
>> ARTICLE
"Life is like a box of ~~chocolates~~ DEEN shows.  You never know what you're gonna get."
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it was really impressive to hear Yakumo's stage fright at the beginning of his performance, when I wouldn't even expect that a seasoned voice actor like Ishida Akira even remembers what stage fright feels like. But he was still able to do it perfectly.
>> ARTICLE
Man, the OST for this show is fantastic so far. Love how it sets the mood.

Also, this may be the prettiest DEEN show I've seen so far. DEEN gets so much shit on this sub but they've really outdone themselves with this one.

And then there's the fantastic performance of the VA's...

[](#gintamathispleasesme)

Edit: I wonder when the drama tag will become relevant. 
>> ARTICLE
Well no action means that more focus can be put into key animation, which means characters look better more of the time. 
>> ARTICLE
Inner conflict and turmoil between characters seem rather prevalent, or building up to. 
>> ARTICLE
When has DEEN come this close to making an AOTY 
>> ARTICLE
deen is known to make a lot of shit, but from time to time they manage to make gems, hope this one will manage to be good til the end

my favorite anime is made by deen , rurouni kenshin Trust and Betrayal, and there as well the ost played a major part in setting out the mood
>> ARTICLE
Honestly? I think the drama tag was relevant last week and this week. Obviously not on an overt fashion, but the characters, their stories, and their interactions all build into drama. I know you're probably asking when there will be big time, heart breaking drama, but I just wanted to point out that we're already witnessing quite a bit of drama every episode.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm yeah, I see what you mean. Normally when I see the drama tag on MAL I'm expecting Shigatsu-tier drama but maybe that isn't the case here (God, I hope it isn't...).
>> ARTICLE
That really isn't what is implied by the use of drama as a pseudo-genre. The colloquial use of drama as a kind of exaggerated tragedy or manufactured interpersonal conflict/meltdown is completely divorced from it.
>> ARTICLE
Would you mind going into more detail as to what "drama" actually entails? like him, I have/had the same idea of what Drama stood for, as a tag.
>> ARTICLE
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(genre)

The most basic, and broad, interpretation would probably be as simple as "not a comedy".
>> ARTICLE
Huh, that's interesting. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I watched [this rakugou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjvFt-Qk_iU) a while back and now I understand where the money counting trick in a soba place comes from.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, having seen this really made the new episode even more fun.
>> ARTICLE
Goodness me, the anxiety was palpable during Yakumo's performance.   
  
Because we first met him as an old high and mighty type, it was a surprise to hear about his humble beginnings. Definitely wouldn't have pegged him for a dancer in a brothel.

I think the episode did a good job of contrasting the two boys but making them both come across sympathetically.  
  
I missed Yotaro and Konatsu a little, but the visuals, music and atmosphere were fantastic again.
>> ARTICLE
I feel like iv'e never seen anything like this show. I haven't had that feeling in quite a while. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, there's *Mushishi*...
>> ARTICLE
This show is just incredible. 

Something I personally find amazing in this show is the sound direction and design. Other than the great use of music, there is a GREAT use of subtle sound effects and how the voices sound in the hall compared to when they're outside or in the house. My gosh. Just play the bathhouse scene again, close your eyes, put on good headphones, and listen to the mastery.

Remember when their master said that Yakumo's voice was too thin and that Sukeroku projected his voice well? Do it again, close your eyes, play back their scenes. Of course that's also mastery in voice acting as well.
>> ARTICLE
Deen how can I get my hour long specials back?
>> ARTICLE
i wanna say that too.....
>> ARTICLE
Man, that ED sequence is [so gorgeous](http://imgur.com/a/X5gji), even if the music is sort of forgettable. Also, while Bokumachi (ERASED :P) certainly has the cinematography, this show has art design (characters and backgrounds) in spades.

This episode wasn't as good, funny, or enjoyable as the first episode. But that one was like perfect, and double-length. But it was still good, funny, *and* enjoyable. I think part of it was the matter, in the way of people, this episode covered. Young Yakumo and Sukeroku don't have the polish that Yotaro and older Yakumo have. They're still half-baked, which is what it's about.

Of course, there's what I noted last episode, that while Ishida Akira is good at the drama part, he lacks what makes for a good Rakugo presence. Which ironically enough, was helpful here. His performance was flat. But that's the risk you run into. When you want to display a boring performance, it might end a tad boring. It was only a tad, because the director focused on his reaction, and the dismay of those around him, and it wasn't all that long, but it was still there.

Likewise, young Sukeroku's performance had a funny moment in the end, but not as funny as Yotaro's story, but one had 2 minutes or so to the other's 10, which makes a world of difference.

And yet, I smiled during the episode, and chuckled, and maybe even teared up once (you can't prove anything!), and when it was over I went "Wait! We're not done here yet! We're only getting *started* on this tale of love and friendship (because yes, there's clearly love here), this story of abandonment and making do, of passion and lack thereof! And after this tale is done we'll still have Yotaro and Konatsu's story! Where are you going?!" and here we are, when an episode ended where a lot happened, but it was over in a breeze.

I need more of this show. Of this show where the 2nd episode was noticeably weaker than the first, but was still strong, and funny. Here we are. With a week for the next episode.

I do wonder if they'll pull a Tenjou Tenge, and have this trip down memory lane (where we're getting the story told by a storyteller, so be wary of what you can believe) take up most of the show's length, as the *real* story. And yes, I did notice how much they painted Sukeroku as "like Yotaro", and so unlike Yakumo. And also, as performers who have to don and drop personalities at the drop of the hat, so too they have to be able to do with their own names.

Seeing Yakumo and Sukeroku's origins would have been an interesting premise for an anime if it had just started at that point. However, last week we had the incredible set-up for these events, leaving us dying to know more about their past, and what transpired between them.

In that light, this episode shines, as we see the tension between their conflicting personalities, and how it influences the obvious tension between Yakumo and Yotaro in the future. It's a bit sad, because we see that Yakumo actually really liked Sukeroku, even if they were opposites. He couldn't help but laugh at him, and he trusted him with his deepest secrets. But, we know that a tragic event is coming that will separate them forever. Yakumo has truly had a pretty crappy life, which gives a lot of depth to his adult self, other than just being some grumpy old man who only likes his own style of rakugo. 

Yakumo's disposition towards both Yotaro and Konatsu is clearly based upon his struggles to find his way, while keeping up with Konatsu's father. And, the thing that breaks up so many great friendships between men, a beautiful woman, looks like she is going to be introduced, from next episode's preview.

> we see that Yakumo actually really liked Sukeroku, even if they were opposites. He couldn't help but laugh at him, and he trusted him with his deepest secrets.

I'm not so sure it's really *like* as such.  Yakumo seems not to have much in this world in the first place, aside from this rambunctious upstart that insists on being next to him and being so much more natural at this occupation than he is  an occupation that seems to have been thrust upon him as it is.
>> ARTICLE
These two episodes have shown how well you can make an anime without having to pander to basic tropes or pitfalls.

I cannot fault any part of either episode, and that makes me warily. I honestly hope this continues with the great art, VA, story, and music that that been shown.

Still cannot get over that blend of traditional and western aesthetics going on in the time period. Very fascinating.  
>> ARTICLE
Last week I hoped the flashback would deliver and it did. I liked how Yakumo blushed when he heard Sukeroku's rakugo and when he ended up opening up to him. Yakumo didn't like rakugo at first interesting and his first performance was just..not good enough especially compared Sukeroku's. I can see the reason that Yakumo still does rakugo is because of Sukeroku. Also the reason he took in Yotarou is because he reminded him of Sukeroku.
>> ARTICLE
I really like the performances. The sounds, music and voices make this even better than it already is. I just love listening to it. The ending is really soothing as well.
>> ARTICLE
This is very quickly becoming my favourite thing for now. Loving the characters and the pacing is immaculate. Every bit of tension is felt, and the release from 'Hatsutaro''s performance was fantastic.

It feels like I'm watching [Barry Lyndon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072684/) at times and I love it.
>> ARTICLE
If this show is aimed at the Josei audience, then consider me a woman.

Note: I'm a man.
>> ARTICLE
I was kind of worried that the second episode would lose some steam after the fantastic first episode, but I have to say that DEEN delivered! The acting is superb, and so is the animation.  
You can just immediately tell the difference between a good storyteller and a bad one, without any need for the characters to say anything.  
I love that we got to know more backstory, and it looks like we'll get more in next episode! I just hope they don't forget to go back to the present from time to time because I really care about those characters too.  
I'm already looking forwards to the next episode! 
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched this yet but the series description is right up my alley, and the gifs I've seen on tumblr look really moody and sensual, similar to Kids on the Slope. Also I didn't realize who the author was until now, but I've enjoyed her other works; they're very atmospheric.
>> ARTICLE
yeah, as soon as i started it it reminded me of KotS. If you enjoyed that, you'll thoroughly enjoy this. the main character dynamic is pretty similar to it as well. 
>> ARTICLE
so, we're following the old man!
>> ARTICLE
I thought the second episode would have a hard time living up to the first but this episode was amazing.
>> ARTICLE
So the old man acted like a old man even when he was a kid huh...    

This might be my favorite anime of the season, only wish the episodes were all 40 minutes like the first one.
>> ARTICLE
Although I understand this flashback is important to the plot and Yakumo's characterization, I do hope it will be over by next week. Already missing Yotaro and Konatsu :'(
>> ARTICLE
Yep, still the AOTS. Shoutout to /u/Spiranix and /u/tundranocaps for some great posts! Keep it up fellas!

Really looks like it'll be between this and ERASED for my AOTS. 

Kinda disappointed we didn't get the [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_UxWeBT1BY) this week, cause god damn that's pure sex.
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad that this show was made regardless of the incredibly miniscule and niche target audience that it has. This is second in my winter season rankings (trailing Boku Machi of course) and overall I'm loving the characters and the patient and cinematic take on story telling.
>> ARTICLE
Again, this anime delivers the goods. I'm really glad that they show the entire rakugo performances instead of only showing bits of it, because you really feel like a part of the audience. It speaks for itself, and that is what makes this show go great. The music perfectly accompanied the tone; I could really feel the tensity of Yakumo's performance, and the jazz fit perfectly with Sukeroku's energy. I love the characters and just the confidence that this show has in presenting itself. Along with Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi, I can tell that this season is going to be a good time.
>> ARTICLE
Hoping we'll see a couple more episodes with those two characters, the chemistry between them is pretty fun to watch.

 
>> ARTICLE
This show is so good, feels completely different to everything else on this season.

Though I was wondering, when Yakumo was doing his performance, they seemed to frame the shot so the handles on the screen behind him, looked like he was wearing a Geisha's headdress. Trying to figure if it was intentional or if I'm imagining it?
>> ARTICLE
Great episode. I really wasn't expecting a flashback ark, but the transition felt very natural. Last week built up the importance of Sukeroku and laid the groundwork of the relationship him and Yakumo would have. Now that we actually get to see Sukeroku, his character already feels familiar. In addition, getting to see Yakumo's early struggles with rakugo and how they lead him to develop his unique style is a fantastic way to flesh out his character. Really looking forward to see what he does next week.
>> ARTICLE
This is one of those shows where I can tell it's good, but I'm just not enjoying it much.  Like this very episode, except for the 2nd Rakugo act in the last few minutes, it was a bit of a chore for me to watch.  I think I'll give it one more episode because a well made anime like this deserves it, but I have strong a feeling I'll be dropping it afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
I've got to try that coin counting trick next time I go out for dinner.

Ooh, a flashback episode! But I wanted to see more of Yotarou :(  
Anyway, that was a pretty neat bromance. Felt really natural too, didn't feel like people suddenly becoming friends for the sake of the plot. This is such a good show guys.

I'm really glad I picked this up. It's a remarkable anime showing how two nobodies make it big in a dying? industry.

This will indeed be interesting. And boy do Josei anime emphasize on muscles and body lines.

This was so interesting, it went too fast, never looked at how much time was remaining.

my biggest fear is that this show goes unnoticed... this is a piece of fine artwork .
>> ARTICLE
Been awhile since I've seen an episode that felt 5 minutes long, Show is damn good so far.  
>> ARTICLE
I admit I was kinda bored by Ep. 1's Rakugo, but Sukeroku's one this time had even me chuckling. It is odd that they went to the flashback episodes almost right off the bat. I just hope this flashback arc ends soon enough before we lose track of what's happening in the present with Yotaro. At the same time, this arc is certainly important in establishing the complex relationships of this show that are this show's main hook for me (that and the jazz of course). 

tl;dr I hope they nail the pacing, because they've nailed everything else so far. 
>> ARTICLE
I think I am the only one with not liking this series.
Animation and Characters are good but I can't find myself getting into the story at all, it is so lame for me.

Sadly I guess, since many people say it's an anime of the season.
>> ARTICLE
2nd episode and it just get better. I can't get over the OST, it's so perfect for every scene.

Both rakugo performances were made in an incredible way. The first one even if you closed your eyes (if you know japanese and can understand perfectly) you could sense it was forced. The second one was full of life, as he drew the story and the characters in your mind in a funny way.

The preview music... No words apart from marvelous... Reminded me of Samurai 7.

If you're lurking in here searching opinions on this show, give it a try, if you like different stuff, this is for you.
>> ARTICLE
This is reminding me a little of _Amadeus_.  Bon/Kakuhiko/Yakumo/whatever being Salieri and Shin/Sukeroku being Mozart.  The bitterness we saw before is starting to make sense.

One other thing I got to thinking about here is the timeline.  The first episode took place in the 1970s, and Yakumo struck me as being maybe in his 50s.  That would put his birth in the 1920s, and the start of his apprenticeship in the 1930s.  However, the latter part of this episode looks like he's several years on, perhaps just under ten more.  That would put us in the early 1940s.  But that's clearly not the case, since there's no sign of WWII.  So maybe he was in his 60s?  A bit late to be taking on apprentices, I would certainly think.

On that note, I wonder if WWII will come up at some point here, or if they're going to elide that.
>> ARTICLE
So far anime of the season for me. Although that's not saying much considering we're in the second week.

Sad all the episodes aren't 45 minutes long.

Kinda wish we could go back to the main plot line rather than these flashbacks. Also wish the flashback arc wasn't more than one episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Was looking forwards to more of gorgeous storyteller babe
>> ARTICLE
So can someone tell me the exact meaning of the title of this show?
>> ARTICLE
Shouwa Genroku = sort of like "the golden age" of the Shouwa era, late 60s and early 70sRakugo = self explanatoryShinjuu = seems to mean "double suicide" or "lovers' suicide", not sure how that ties into the show yet
>> ARTICLE
Ohhh, I thought genroku was referring to another time period a few centuries back because I'm not familiar with Japanese history and that's what came up when I searched for it. I had to go to the Japanese wiki to find shouwa genroku. Seems like there was a lot going on around then like the olympics hosted there and shinkansen being set up.

Shinjuu () can also refer to one's inner heart or true motive which is also how it's used in Korean, so maybe it has more to do with that? Something along the lines of to keep rakugo in your heart? Or maybe it's actually a double suicide of some sort... Maybe double meaning in that regard since the former just seems to work regardless.
>> ARTICLE
Someone else explained the genroku thing in another thread. Basically it's a reference to the genroku period, since apparently that was sort of a historically prosperous era as well. So that upswing during shouwa is like a second coming of those good times.I'm really not too sure about the Shinjuu part, honestly. I'm mainly going by my kanji-reader/dictionary browser addon and the conclusions that have come up in other threads here and on /a/. The other guy who replied to me just now had a good idea about it.
>> ARTICLE
> Maybe double meaning in that regard.

Yes, but not "inner heart". I don't think I should spoil the plot here by saying more, so I only explained the part with the  dialogue appeared in the released episode. 
>> ARTICLE
Shinjuu is like "die together". But it can also mean like try hard to death. So far, at the last part of the first episode where Yakumo asked for 3 promises, the second promise was to open a way for rakugo to survive together. If it fails, then it'll be "morotomo shinju dayo" (both die), Yakumo said, meaning they have to find a way to save rakugo (which is almost dying) or rakugo will die with him.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Cheers
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I really love how this anime superbly handles the atmosphere of each scene! I really liked how the anime showed young Yakumo's rakugo to be totally bland and with the performer's tension slowly showing through great usage of BGM. Another impressive thing about this episode is the voice acting. Tomokazu Seki and Akira Ishida show in this episode why they're big names among Japanese voice actors. I think it's a skill to be intentionally boring and monotonous for a few straight minutes and Akira Ishida perfectly nails it while Tomokazu Seki continues to own the show with his lively and emotional performance. This anime continues to be consistently great!

I hope more people watch this anime, it's seriously good!
>> ARTICLE
does anyone know for certain what the time period is? i know the 'present' is during the showa era, but i am uncertain as to where in the era (i would perfer a decade span or so) and also as to what decade the 'flashback' segment is in. 

watching the second episode really got me pondering that. in the flashback the lack of electricity was extremely noteworthy compared to the presence of radios and whatnot in the first episode. It made me realize that Japan really did modernize almost 'overnight' in a sense, but i had difficulty finding material online showing what technologies were adapted into common use and when.

i know this all was a bit off topic, so to go back to the episode itself, i absolutely adored the meeting of the two youths. their contrast in style is amazingly abundant, in both way of speech and in their contrasting choices of eastern/western attire, even after having trained/lived together for presumably years. It is a bit of a stretch to think that in that time they didn't have that strong an effect on one another's mannerisms and habits, but enjoyable.
>> ARTICLE
I think the "present" is around the '60s. This would reasonably make the flashback set in the early 20th century, when Japan was still freshly out of the Edo period, so modernization was probably still under way. In a sense Edo Japan sounds a lot like modern North Korea... imagine what would happen if THAT opened up from one day to the other.

I keep expecting them to cut away from the Rakugo performance but so far they mostly stick with it and show the entire performance.

It's actually strangely bold to show full performances of an art that a drama is based on. Most shows sacrifice the actual premise of the show to focus on backstage events.

The Fate/Stay Night adaptation probably played a big role in this. As someone pointed on this sub a few days ago, once you piss of the Fate fans, it's over. And being compared to Ufotable made it even worse.

Wait, I thought the Fate series was well received? I personally loved fate zero, but hated UBW. But from the looks of things on this sub, it seems like ppl liked ubw.
>> ARTICLE
Fate/Zero and Ufotable's UBW were, indeed, very well received. A lot of people are also fans of the original VN. That is why [Deen's version of Fate/Stay Night](http://myanimelist.net/anime/356/Fate_stay_night), which had lower quality graphics and a messed up story mixing a bit of the three routes, has stained their reputation.

Honestly, I liked it, as it was the first thing I watched from the Fate universe. But, if the overall negativity might be stronger than deserved, the critics are still correct as a lot of potential was wasted.

Holy crap I knew she sung the opening, but I'm currently watching the episode and I instantly recognized her when Miyokichi started speaking.

The recent OVA series of Gundam Thunderbolt has a rather extreme jazz center to its soundtrack and Kids on the Slope had it of course. Fujiko Mine and Baccano also largely had jazz soundtracks. A lot of oldschool setting anime seems to fit well with jazz. Or in the case of Thunderbolt, a Jaz fanboy using it as his own anthem.

I  also rather liked the totally off beat and bordering on nonsensical use of jazz in Marvel vs Capcom 2 as well. Just lent it a totally unique feel soundtrackwise.

Ah, another 12-minute episode.

The most intriguing aspect of the narrative, to me, is what exactly will become of the titular [_shinjuu_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BF%83%E4%B8%AD) (double/lovers' suicide). The two characters who weren't shown in the first episode but appear in this flashback arc are Sukeroku and Miyokichi; Sukeroku we know is dead at least, and that he had a child, though whether it was by Miyokichi or whether she's dead as of the present time are unknown.

Another interesting reading of the title might tell us that the _shinjuu_ occurs during the rather specific _Showa Genroku_ period (1970-71), which is when the first episode took place - perhaps meaning that the _shinjuu_, or whichever event symbolizes it, is coming during the present-time arc at the climax of the show. Maybe. Exciting, isn't it?

Essentially, I'm constantly on edge for death flags. The show _does_ have "suicide" in the title, after all. It doesn't help that the episodes are so brilliantly composed that they seem to eat through their running time at breakneck speed, despite being mostly dialogue and containing at least one full rakugo performance per episode.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for pointing out the shinjuu thing. For some reason, I didn't even look at what the title for this series even translates to. 

If its even possible, this just elevates this anime even further for me. There are so many possibilities and theories I can think of already. I'm really looking forward to more of this story

I really liked the story. I admit I didn't laugh at the other stories, but this one did it. Thankfully the humor is not primarily based on puns, which would otherwise not benifit us non-jap viewers because of loss in tl, etc.
>> ARTICLE
To me, Kiku doesn't seem that interested in Miyo. Or maybe he's just shy, we'll have to see.
>> ARTICLE
He almost certainly has no experience with women, so he has no idea how to react when he's dealing with one. He's also probably conflicted about doing stuff with his teacher's mistress. That's my interpretation at least.
>> ARTICLE
Doubt it she will be his wife.

I am thinking more that Hatsuta loves (he probably knows her the same amount of time sensei is -> both of them were together during the war) Miyoki and had already sex with her (coming from how he looked at her and the reaction that she wants to meet Kikuhiko.)

I think it's either going to be a love triangle or Kiku will get her as a wife. I could be also horribly wrong :D
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking that perhaps she could be Konatsu's mother. Kiku might actually develop a thing for her only to lose her to his brother. Maybe that's why he treats her badly.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't...Konatsu's mother get mentioned in the first episode? 

Edit: Yes, 30 minutes into the first episode.  The mother is referred to as "Miyuki", though that could be a new name or given name for Miyokichi so it doesn't help much...actually it could even be "Miyoki-chan" and just not transcribed right by Crunchyroll (wouldn't be surprising at all).  We also know that the mistress of the establishment (could be Kiku's wife, could be for something else like) and her mother both worked in the red-light district together.  
>> ARTICLE
I thought for sure she was Konatsu's mother. They look similar from some angles. Plus...we haven't been introduced to any other women yet, and the show's gotta leave the flashback arc at some point. I was/am anticipating some sort of tragic love triangle.
>> ARTICLE
NO!! I CANT BELIEVE THT AMAZING BROMANCE IS GONNA B RUINED BY SOME HOE THAT EVEN THE OLD MAN FUCKED.
>> ARTICLE
The musical score is really holding this show together as a drama, especially in the end, when Miyokichi latched onto Bon and he held her.

We know it's coming. We know a woman came between the two of them, but even without being forewarned, we could see the first time in which Shin actually withdrew from Bon, and it was over Bon speaking to him about a woman.

This is beyond a love triangle though, this is a love quadruple. This is positively oedipal, with both of the master's "sons" going after their father's mistress. This is beyond the fact that they are going after his name, to literally succeed him, as future "Yakumo"s. Is Shin uncomfortable because he wants her himself, or because he just mentioned how Miyokichi is their master's mistress, and he finds this offputting? Or perhaps both.

The other big thing in this episode was Shin and Bon's relationship. The yaoi mangaka tendencies sure come out. You could say that Shin is portrayed as extremely masculine, and constantly references his masculinity, and Bon is portrayed as feminine, and reserved, and collected. But more than that is that Shin-chan is presented as the unruly boy, the unruly *son*, with Bon not just as a woman, or as a parent, but as if he's Shin-chan's *mother*. Which of course gives another read to Shin's reaction of Bon perhaps finding someone else to give his affection to - not as a would-be jilted "lover", but as a boy seeing his mother finding a new husband, or another child. And Miyokichi referencing to Bon as an older brother is part of it - Shin still needs and wants Bon's attention and affection.

There was also the talk of flaws, but the show addressed that quite clearly on its own. It really is a nice little drama.

[Yakumo with the "I'm gay af, can u pls let go of me" face](http://i.imgur.com/iLmQTbS.png). get this homewrecker out of my BL, Kumota. if this chick is the reason why best boy Sukeroku is pushing up daisies, I'm gonna be pissed.  
  
great episode again. the elaborate use of staging in Sukeroku's performance continues the trend of Omata being far too good at directing for this to only be his third thing. Kouichi Yamadera's been killing it lately, and today's episode has been his best yet, with some of the most skillful use of pitch changing and tone switching I've heard come out of a VA. he was legitimately able to sell me the idea that there were multiple people on that stage, with Omata's use of alternating camera angles and set pieces making it all the more effective. seeing him walk backstage covered in sweat really helped make it evident how much work was being done there. despite him being a secondary focus this episode, he really made it for me and I'm going to be devastated when he's out of commission. I giggled way too much at "now you can Samu-die" and his delivery of those lines.  
  
also, wow, [Deen can even make shoe-tying look beautiful](https://i.gyazo.com/15cc0e820022526898f90c3d0f8c515a.gif). can't believe how great their work on this show has been, it's very well animated.

The BL vibes are so strong. And I am totally down with that. The intersection of quasi-BL (fujobait?) and josei has never served me wrong. E.g. Kids on the Slope.

I'm really enjoying the flashback arc, I find the characters equally as interesting as Yotarou and Konatsu.
>> ARTICLE
I see nothing with BL. To me it literally looks like a bromance.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, Shouwa's clearly not a BL story but the undertones are pretty evident in the art style and staging. It's all very sensual.

In any case, BL doesn't have to be sexual. In my opinion there's a fine line between it and the buddy story bromance.

It wasn't a surprise to me to find that the author of the manga almost only wrote yaoi before this.

Giggling just like Kiku during Sukeroku's performance, since when can an anime make me react like its fictional audience?  

Serious talent this mangaka, and then the anime staff, have with handling this kind of "mundane" story, where it's actually anything but.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it is also testament to the simple strengths of sit down folklore storytelling art of Rakugo as well. It seems way too mundane compared to modern productions, but a good storyteller can circumvent it all and make it convincing. It is like watching sports, almost. The human effort is easy to appreciate when they are able to reach the audiences so well. But yeah, big props to anime and manga on getting it across in a fictional style too.

Fun fact: all but one of the main seiyuu cast of Rakugo was also cast in Evangelion.

Have you read the manga? How much has the anime covered so far?

Yeah, after watching episode 3 I decided to read the manga (though I haven't quite caught up to the latest volume yet) and the anime so far has covered 2 volumes and next episode will probably be the first chapter of volume 3.

The number of people in this thread who assume Kiku is interested in Miyo at all is kinda baffling. He seems pretty thoroughly uninterested to me. I do think it's interesting though how Miyo echoes Kiku's line last week from when he and Sukeroku were reunited. There might still be a love triangle here, but it may not be the one a lot of you are thinking lmao. 
>> ARTICLE
Why's everybody in this show so gorgeous? Why's the music so good? Why's everything so perfect?   
I'm loving the interactions between characters, specially now that Miyo has gotten introduced. I really like Kiku's character and seeing him react to Miyo's advances is very fun. 
  
Also, doesn't need to be said, but everytime rakugo happens, or at least when it's supposed to be good rakugo (like Sukeroku's this episode) it's just so well directed and it's like wow, I got sucked into it. 

PS. Is that Kiku in the preview dressed as a geisha or dancer of some sort?   
PS2. Stop calling some aspects of this show fujo-bait, guys, that's sad. Are you going to say you aren't enjoying Kiku's and Sukeroku's friendship and interactions (possibly deliberate sexual tension notwithstanding) Hmmm? You gotta admit it's interesting, and it's part of the story, not fanservice. I mean it can be but, you know, that's... uh... Dammit, this is why we can't have nice things.

> Episode 4

The preview proves that [Rakugo Preview Spoilers](/s "there will be even *more* about Kiku's personal story/flashback.") Meaning, at this point, and as others I have talked with have guessed, [Rakugo Speculation](/s "the anime might be entirely about Kiku's past/story/flashback. The metaness of it all is clever, but it is strictly using the past when the present has already been shown that is the most intriguing. In other words, 'it is not about the destination, but the journey.' And *that* is something I can very, very much get behind.")

Also, this episode (if I am not mistaken) is the first of the flashback episodes to not have present-day Kiku narrating. The first two had him monologuing or adding extra details of his thoughts at the time, but this episode had none of that. This could either be seen as a way to make us forget that this is a story being told (to make it feel like these events are happening "right now" instead of years ago), that this is a part of Kiku's story that he did not directly tell to Youtarou and Konatsu (getting back at the meta aspect of the anime), or it could be symbolic of Kiku's scattered thoughts due to the tumultuous feelings he was having at that time (worrying about money, frustration at not getting better at rakugo, happiness from having his "brother" around, anxiety around a new woman, and what seems to be blossoming love).

But no matter what, it will be interesting to see where Rakugo progresses from here! :3

Edit: Grammar!
>> ARTICLE
I think the lack of narration this episode was definitely to further draw the viewer away from the present storyline. I'd also believe that Kiku didn't directly tell this particular story to Youtarou and Konatsu (yet), since EP 3 ended with the "That's a story for another night."

 I really wasn't sure where they were going with this show, but I feel that I have a better grasp now. Perhaps what I'm most interested in seeing in the future would be something along the lines of [](/s "the 2nd half reverting back to the present timeline. Kiku takes over the role of main character completely, and we view the events of EP 1 from a different perspective. Instead of a story about a hotshot rookie, this will be one of a seasoned veteran and how his art has affected his life in past, present, and future.")

There's so many paths they could take with this story. I'm really curious about what they'll do because I don't believe I've seen a narrative like this before.
>> ARTICLE
> Rakugo Speculation

[More Rakugo Speculation](/s "I think if the series does decide to go back to the present -- at this point, I have no idea if it will -- I would much prefer it putting its focus on Yotarou and Konatsu. Kiku is getting the full character development treatment, from humble beginnings to difficult adulthood to grumpy old man. I expect him to get out of his rut in the present, but only with the help of his niece and this new dude that reminds him so much of Shin. ANd the way that happens is putting the lens back on those it originally was looking at.")

But as you say, they *can* go anywhere with it right now. That in itself is pretty cool to see since not every anime has that capability!
>> ARTICLE

I mentioned to you how I'd be happy with that a couple of days ago but you mentioned it would be testing your patience. Do you still think that? I'm curious after reading the speculation, since it seems like you view it differently now.

Rinarin! I hope you are doing well today.

> I mentioned to you how I'd be happy with that a couple of days ago...

You did! You were the one I was referring to most. :)

> ...but you mentioned it would be testing your patience.

I did!

> Do you still think that? I'm curious after reading the speculation, since it seems like you view it differently now.

I will say that I am coming around.

I love maxims. Hackneyed phrases, while overused, are powerful in that they convey a lot of meaning in a succinct manner. So the show becoming a "it is not the destination that matters, but the journey" tale is quite appealing to me.

However! I am still slightly skeptical of the show not having any major narrative conflict. It is more me wanting a balance in its story and characters: right now, it is *all* about the characters.

To be fair, this episode was stronger than the last (I find episode three to be the weakest of the four thus far). This mostly has to deal with the anime having a tighter focus in terms of pacing and, by extension, conflict. Rather than progressing through so many events and scenes and happenings (episode three went from troubles with rakugo to war and the splitting-up of Kiku and Shin to Kiku contemplating life and so on), this episode was contained within a few days or so. We get a call-back to Kiku needing to find "his own" rakugo (what he tells Yotarou to do in the first episode), we hear about his ongoing troubles with his money, his work, and his feelings. And we also get a new character -- Miyokichi -- to add another dimension to the characters involved. Meaning, with this episode, the problems felt more contained and therefore more urgent than they have been.

The interesting part will be if [Rakguo Speculation](/s "the anime stays either completely flashback or goes back to the present timeline. I think at this point staying in the past for the entire anime will be the best course of action since going back to the present will leave little time for all of these past events to have any impact on Youtarou and Konatsu. It *can* work, so long as they give those characters the time to breathe and grow. In other words, using the last half of the anime to capitalize on the first half's story.")

That is what I mean by interesting; I want to see where the anime will decide to go in the near future!

Edit: Words!
>> ARTICLE
> "it is not the destination that matters, but the journey"

Kinda how I viewed it when I mentioned I'd like it to continue as well, since everything and everyone in the past seems to have contributed a lot to the state things are in the present. Though I have to admit the characters in the past are quite appealing, so that adds a lot to the reason why it doesn't feel like they drag on.

> I will say that I am coming around.

Thought so. The speculation sounded like it so was curious and thought I'd ask!

About the [speculation](/s "I believe it will stay in the past a bit more but will return to the present at some point, since we just saw Miyokichi, which I assume is Konatsu's mother. This makes me think that whatever the conflict-issue between Sukeroku and Yakumo was will be presented soon...also that it obviously has to do with Miyokichi somehow, considering what happened this episode and who I think she is. I do like the past episodes, but I would like to see how Konatsu deals with the story, too, since it seems not everyone sees what happened in the same way from what we saw on the first episode.") 

Really interested about this, too. I love how this is progressing so far :)
>> ARTICLE
> Speculation

[Rakugo Speculation](/s "Yea, Miyokichi almost has to be Konatsu's mother. And I agree! How Yotarou and Konatsu react to this story would be awesome to see, so long as the anime gives them that time *to* actually react to it all. But that is the problem I suppose: until we actually see whether or not it is all flashback, it is difficult to say whether or not the anime -- as a whole -- is doing everything correctly.")
>> ARTICLE
[Hints from previous episodes and speculation](/s "On the first episode, that mistress calls Konatsu's mom with the name Miyuki, which sounds like it could be the base for Miyokichi (one of the two could be her geisha-artistic name), and that she was a geisha with her. Not sure if that mistress is the same one we see on the preview but all these make me think it's her mother. Plus the story starts to shape if it is actually her mother.")

Can't wait for the next episodes, thinking about these!

You can tell in some scenes the animation quality dropped a little, but the rest easily makes up for it. Everything sound related was perfect as well.

This is like the longest flashback ever. Not that I mind :)

It's amazing how so few people seem to be watching this. It's absolutely the highlight of my anime-week and so different from basically anything.

It's still a miracle that DEEN of all studios, is making this good.

DEEN is on point this season

Every time the ED comes on I think "What, no way that was twenty minutes already." This season has some really excellent anime.

Am I the only person whose startled by how offhandedly the Master introduces his mistress. I know its a different culture/time and all but that shits still cold. Especially when we had pretty much an entire episode of his wife slowly falling into infirmity because she missed him when he went to war. All the while he was bumping uglies with a girl half his age.
>> ARTICLE
The fact that each episode contains a full, unedited Rakugo performance really makes the show quite enriching as you are becoming cultured as you watch the story unfold. 

If there comes a day when you're able to identify Yumekin by hearing the premise you will come off as a one well read and studied mother f'er.

Now this was a good episode! Definitely the most entertained I've been watching this show since the flashback began. Still pissed that it doesn't look like we'll be back to the present any time soon, but some actual drama is finally appearing in this backstory.

Well I was on the fence with this show before but after the last one I'm hooked.

I've been curious about this new female character since before it came out. She's not what I expected but I am curious to see what kind of role she'll play. She seems to be smarter then she looks which is something I like. Just hope it isn't manipulative smart...

I'm not complaining, but I wonder how many episodes the stuff in the past will go on for until we get back to the present.

Also, Yakumo doesn't deserve that girl. Last episode, he let a perfect maiden escape his grasp. I hate him.

So what year does this show take place anyways? 
>> ARTICLE
God I love this show. The scene with Bon and Shin on the street was simply amazing. I loved the banter between them, which spoke not only of their current relationship but also of their past together, I loved the little details that fit firmly into the time period, I loved the backgrounds and general aesthetic of it. 

This is such an unexpected treat. I still haven't got over how good this show is.
>> ARTICLE
HAYASHIBARA MEGUMI <3 <3 <3 !! She's voicing Miyokichi (and she did Rei 20 years ago). And Yakumo is voiced by Ishida Akira, who did Kaworu 20 years ago as well. Nice to hear them together again, love 'em both <3
>> ARTICLE
Did it seem like he was moving without a limp when waitering?  How did that happen?

Anyway, I liked this episode more than the previous ones I think, liked the rakugo story more than the previous ones too :)

Not a fan of that whiny style of singing though.
>> ARTICLE
Lol oh man, then you should never go to traditional Japanese theater, because that kind of singing is everywhere. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this isn't the first time I've heard it in various mediums, always hated it.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't actually a huge fan of this episode, some of the directing felt a bit stiff outside of the Rakugo show (like the cut to holding Hatsu's lips) and the development of some of the relationships just felt off. 

It had it's moments, once again the show itself was brilliant, had me laughing along with the audience as usual, and I was still able to pick out his flaws with his character descriptions being too fast (the artwork also portrayed this by giving a vague image of what was being described). A few of the character interactions early on were great, especially as we get a feel for Kiku's and Hatsu's living arrangements, but everything after the Rakugo show felt a bit flat.

Overall it was still a good episode but not on the level of quality within the narratives character dynamics and pacing that the show has put out in the first 3 episodes. 

>> ARTICLE
So I ended up stopping around half way through the first episode when this started airing. So what makes this anime good and what would be a good reason to restart it? I should say I'm a fan of romance anime and also a big fan of Nodame Cantibile that is a josie and would love something along those lines again if that help. Basically I want a excuse to restart it though I lost interest in the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
It gets way better at episode 3 imo. I would try it again if I were you.
>> ARTICLE
The drama and comedy are pretty good, IMO. The first episode was 40 minutes, so you might not be bored if you're watching the 20 minute episodes, because 40 minutes is pretty long.
>> ARTICLE
Its nice to see Kiku being praised by the crowd. This is a huge confidence boost for him. I think he will finally realized that people do like his style for what it is. There are different reactions for different types and he was comparing himself to his brother who's style is totally different. 
>> ARTICLE
Yup, people kept telling him he'd do better with racy stuff, but he kept insisting on learning the beginner material first.  Maybe now he'll concentrate on what he's good at? 

Though didn't they say in a previous episode that the racy stuff was self-censored by the rakugo community?
>> ARTICLE
> didn't they say in a previous episode that the racy stuff was self-censored by the rakugo community?

That was during the war, it's over.
>> ARTICLE
I love almost everything about this show but it's characters are the truest reason to stay invested.

Each moment presents a new view of them, a reason to like them, a reason to not like them and that's exactly why I'm so invested in this show. Because there's no one character that's even close to being perfect. The Master was cheating on his wife, Yakumo has inner demons that leave him sly, almost unlikable with his leer and snide retorts, Sukeroku is wild, almost to the point of being a hazard to everything he goes near, even the future character we were introduced to in Yotarou has problems thinking for himself, makes stupid decisions and ended up with his ass in prison.

Then we have the performance and the true line between life and art becomes apparent. Every time I get suckered in and every line and how it gets delivered has so much weight.

Yeah, this show's pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
I do like how at any given moment, a character can become the antagonist in an episode. It makes things unpredictable and somewhat realistic I suppose, though obviously it has a bit of a dramatic twist. I can never quite tell a character is someone I should be cheering for or not. I suppose we can make that kind of call at the very end of the show. But it's  nice that every character has certain flaws without bring full on evil or purely antagonistic.
>> ARTICLE
I prefer stories that don't have any one character you're clearly 'meant' to cheer for, personally. Makes it a lot more interesting and lifelike I guess, although you kind of mentioned that. 
>> ARTICLE
Every episode I find myself completely lost in this series' world.  

Not once do I look at the time, not once do I check my phone, and not once do I notice any sort of background distractions happening around me.  I have yet to stop being so impressed by this show each week.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. 

It also wants you to stay in the series' world for a tiny little bit more. For some odd reason, it gives me a nostalgia of sorts, even though I was born in this century and in a completely different part of the world.

It's strange.

Right on. That scene in her room is one of my favorites from the show thus far. The dialogue, art, and music come together wonderfully. Despite the undercurrent of sensuality, it's a very sweet scene. I loved when she was massaging his leg...there's that long pause in which Kiku thinks, thinks, thinks then lets himself lean on her. Absolutely lovely. I need my hands on the OST as well.

Their friendship is great, but that only means it'll hurt more when it all comes crashing down.

Makes you wonder if something tragic happens or a 3rd party comes in to fray relationships.
>> ARTICLE
The unspoken characterization in this show is so great. You can really feel how much Kiku is not sexually attracted to Miyuki, that he's kind of putting up with being physical with her out of some sort of sense of obligation, either societal expectations or like he "owes" it to Miyokichi. And Miyokichi seems like she's willing to back off when Kiku gets uncomfortable. She seems like she's his beard, but is also okay with that, and it might be some sort of agreement between them. Even if I am completely wrong, the amount you can read into the character interactions is great.
>> ARTICLE
I totally agree on that.  The whole scene that starts with them sitting in that room kissing and ends with "he's not like that" felt like as close to a coming out scene as I'm expecting from this show.  When he asks her stop kissing him and massage his leg seems to be the turning point, and both of their body language seems to get way more intimate (in a different way, naturally) after that point too, as an understanding grows between them.  Of course, that had been happening from about as soon as those two met, but this felt like an incredibly tasteful culmination of their development as friends.
>> ARTICLE
> "he's not like that"

Pretty sure this is in reference to him being a customer.  I think the show has plenty of fujobait but I think Kiku being gay is grasping at straws.

I think the writers are probably being intentionally ambiguous, to be honest.  I don't find the argument for him being straight especially convincing either, but everyone has their own biases and is grasping at the straws that make sense to them, which I think is fine in this case.

Well, they are different honestly. Not sure about the super space robots one (which one do you mean?) but I love One Punch Man too. You can like fast food pizza AND finely filleted sashimi and be hard pressed to call one "better" than the other. I wouldn't go into a show about a guy punching things once and winning expecting character nuance and subtlety, and I wouldn't go into a show about two traditional theatre performers slowly maturing and developing both as humans and artists in the 1950s Japan expecting fist-pumping awesomeness. The two things are so distant from each other I really couldn't appoint a "better" one. I love Showa Rakugo but I have to be in the right mood and state of mind to watch it for example - which is why I seldom watch it as soon as it's out.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benten_Koz%C5%8D

 The role Kiku played in this play, Benten kozou, and the scene shown here is Act 3 at Hamamatsuya, the cloth shop.
>> ARTICLE
Just pointing this out:

Kikuhiko likes perfect maidens like Onodera.

Hatsutaro likes sluts like Chitoge.

This episode was just great.  It'll be interesting to see how Kiku's rakugo evolves as a result of his experience in the play; I'm hoping that will be the focus in the next few episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Nice Kabuki play. Loving all the classical styles they're putting in this show.
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow. From the initial cheers, despite his lack of confidence, Kiku has his own set of groupies.
>> ARTICLE
I [understand why Miyokichi](http://i.imgur.com/9hxzjBl.jpg) got so hyped. I mean...[just look at him](http://i.imgur.com/txc1PIn.jpg)!

[They](http://i.imgur.com/wALho19.jpg) were great this time and I'm really glad Kiku got to enjoy himself on stage so much. 

What I didn't expect however was [Miyokichi knowing things about him](http://i.imgur.com/jKVxkj1.jpg) that [he himself told her about](http://i.imgur.com/UWuuuWa.jpg) and she didn't just guess by herself. I'm guessing that he told her he isn't interested in women like that or something along those lines. Not sure why but I expected him to be more in denial about it (then again it was obvious for quite a while already)...which doesn't seem to be the case if that's what he told her.

Also, damn I'm in love with the opening. Miyokichi (Hayashibara Megumi) is the one singing it, isn't it?
>> ARTICLE
I wouldnt say hes not into women. He did have that one girl for awhile. I think hes actually a lot like me. Im very serious most of the time and am focusing on my future rather than worrying about being with a bunch of women. If youre good looking and smart, youll catch my attention, but thats not something very common, and its not the sex i want the woman for. She could be a 10 and if shes dumb, i wont bother with her. Just how some ppl are 
>> ARTICLE
I'll say that that seems more normal to me. What's the point of having  a 10/10 without any personality, even if you have sex it'll get old fast. Bon is very vague. He might be as you say, a looking for personality type of person, though the relationship with the previous girl wasn't much to speak of either. I do get slight yaoi-vibes though. 
>> ARTICLE
I think you're right about Miyokichi's line about him not being like that, but I also got the impression that "I shouldn't have told her" was more about him mentioning his self-doubt than any off-screen confession.  Because I think you're right about him being somewhat in denial.

That leaves the question of how she might guess something like that, but considering her profession and involvement in the art world in the 40s, she would probably have already come across enough men like Kiku to be able to understand without him having (or wanting) to say it out loud.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really curious to the explanation of these two lines and if they will be explained on next episodes. The popular opinion seems to be that this wasn't what both of them meant, they instead meant that he wasn't a paying customer (which he isn't). It does seem like quite a possible explanation, too but I really want to see it explained.
>> ARTICLE
I think the reason why he is a bit cagey with women is because he had a history of abandonment and likely wants to make sure his life has some sense of normalcy before settling down. He knows how it feels like to be abandoned and he pretty much abandoned a few potential girlfriends before, so he is probably more wary than most about being too open about courting women. 
>> ARTICLE
The way I read the "I shouldn't have told her" line, was more that Kiku felt he shouldn't be burdening Miyokichi with his own problems, when it could get Miyokichi, who is still just a trainee geisha, in trouble for skipping out on work and focusing on him.
>> ARTICLE
>What I didn't expect however was Miyokichi knowing things about him  that he himself told her about  and she didn't just guess by herself. I'm guessing that he told her he isn't interested in women like that or something along those lines.

I'm thinking you picked up on the wrong context here. He's straight and he's interested in women. He's just somewhat stoic. They were kissing. When she said that she showed that she was in love with him. The "He isn't like that" is referring to the fact that he's not a paying customer. He's a personal friend. She's a geisha in training, geisha in training aren't supposed to serve customers. Thus the concern of the head geisha and thus the explanation of her when she says "He isn't like that".
>> ARTICLE
Could be. This is all just what I'm guessing anyway, plus I liked some of the other interpretations I read here as replies, too. They could have been referring to being a customer, too.
>> ARTICLE
She was kissing him but I'm not so sure about the other way around. He was completely limp against the wall with a bored expression on his face the whole time.
>> ARTICLE
This. But I don't think she meant "not a paying customer", rather, "he isn't my lover", who could ruin her future career as a proper geisha. Miyokichi is definitely seducing him, (and Kiku seems to like that too) though. 
>> ARTICLE
Geisha also did prostitution as well. FYI. Depending on how reputable or disreputable the place was.
>> ARTICLE
Of course, but geisha don't allow normal "paying customers" enter her private room, which is why her senior was worried if it's her serious lover. Paying customers use the brothel rooms for that, so she definitely knows he isn't just a mere customer.
>> ARTICLE
I thought he was talking about the play when he said "I shouldn't have told her", but that sounds like an interesting connection as well. 
>> ARTICLE
I thought of the play, as well, but the timing of when he said that was related to hearing them talk outside the room when she said "He isn't like that" so it really seems like he told her something about it. It does seem like they've been hanging out, so it's possible (though not sure if that's 100% the case).
>> ARTICLE
Damn I didnt even think about tht. But he has been in a relationship twice and had shown feelings for them so i doubt it
>> ARTICLE
His character design reminds me of other josei works but also of quite a few shounen ai works and I do get that that isn't enough to tell but his interactions with Sukeroku (glances, reactions) and his usual awkwardness with those ladies in the past make it quite possible. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone mentioned somewhere (aka, I was dumb and didn't save the link for future reference) that there's more cinematic clues. Like, the way Shin is viewed from Bon's perspective, oftentimes in bits in pieces and focusing on certain body parts, is basically how male gaze is portrayed. Meanwhile he views Miyokichi as a whole person, so he's not sexually attracted to her. Something like that. 

Of course, he kind of looked at her that way in this episode - but I kind of figure that Miyokichi and Shin look a little bit alike in some ways, so that could mean something too. 
>> ARTICLE
It could be a double meaning as well - narratively at least. Like, directly they're referencing the play, but indirectly it could also be talking about how he's "not like that". Layers or some shit. 
>> ARTICLE
That sounds even more possible considering the show.
>> ARTICLE
I think "He isn't like that" meant that he wasn't a *customer*.  Like she's not turning tricks on the side, she's with him because she likes him.
>> ARTICLE
Could be the case easily, as well. This is just an interpretation/guess as I wrote.
>> ARTICLE
I sort of read into that he wasn't just a customer as well. Otherwise I don't really see why she would blush at that moment unless she genuinely liked him. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh I agree that Miyokichi likes him, not doubting that. And the customer thing does seem more likely than my guess but I'd like to see more of them to decide if that's 100% true :P
>> ARTICLE
The thing is, A: "Is he/she your...(steady)?" B: "He/She/It(the relationship) isn't like that (sonnanja nai)" is a very common convo in Japanese to deny a serious relationship(bf/gf/affair) while often hiding a true feeling. Sometimes it's a lie. "Like that" implies a serious relationship.

If you are watching Bokumachi(Erased), rewatch its episode 1 and check how the protagonist saying the exact same phrase "sonnanja nai" to his mother in episode 1.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I didn't know that that is a common convo, thank you for explaining it! :)

If that is the case then the customer option does seem to be the case instead of my guess. I was mostly going by the subs and had no idea.
>> ARTICLE
I commented on it somewhere else, but I don't think it's just "not customer". Paying customers do not visit geisha's private room in general, and Miyo said it's a secret to 7-daime, so O-ei was worried if Kiku was Miyo's serious lover. Miyo denied that. We can already assume that 7-daime is Miyo's patron from various scenes. There are common stories about geisha falling in love with a customer (betraying her patron), go serious and run away or get milked for money, etc.
>> ARTICLE
This was my takeaway too
>> ARTICLE
Gah was great seeing Kiku succeed, now if only things will work out nicely between him and Miyo I'd be set!
>> ARTICLE
> will work out nicely

I'm seeing a triangle, to be honest. Miyokichi liking Kiku (though she probably knows he won't like her romantically), Kiku liking Sukeroku (though I have no idea if anyone will ever find out about that) and Sukeroku possibly liking Miyokichi (he kinda twitched when he heard her voice before the play so I'm guessing there is a past there).
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I can deffs see that happening! Probably the most likely :/

I just really like the dynamic of Kiki and Miyo, it's just so different but well yeah he doesn't seem to have eyes for her.
>> ARTICLE
Also, I'm really thinking Konatsu is Miyokichi's child so a triangle seems quite likely on that assumption, too.
>> ARTICLE
People keeping saying this.  I really don't see any of that in here.  Was this supposed to be touted as shounen-ai or something?  

I'm bisexual myself and I like seeing shounen and shoujou ai in anime and manga but I seem to be really missing it this time.  I see two great buddies and an amazingly complex bromance going on.  Kiku doesn't seem to really swing that way and we've seen him have a couple of relationships with women already.  Just because he does not go very far with them doesn't mean he's gay.  Hell there could be an equally good argument that he's somewhat of an asexual even.  I think people slapping the homosexual label on him is slightly undermining the potential complexity of his character.

We'll have to see though.  Part of me really hopes it doesn't turn into a shounen-ai of sorts.  I've put my 'goggles' on for plenty of other anime so I get why maybe this is allowing watchers to get carried away with the subtext.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it is "supposed" to be shounen ai or something in particular. What I wrote is just a guess based on various vague comments and behaviour/mannerisms of the characters. There are various interpretations to all these, of course, so it could be different to what I posted.
>> ARTICLE
I believe it has to do with the shot framing of Sukeroku vs. that of Miyo (specifically in the scene where Sukeroku comes back from Manchuria). Some are saying that the shots of Sukeroku from Kiku's POV are a bit lewd. Also the lullaby rakugo scene from last episode I think. 
>> ARTICLE
I think it can safely be read either way.  

I'm gay and I definitely see it in this anime.  The thing is, because of the time period, it would be a bit out of place to have a modern, out-and-proud gay character that makes his sexuality clear through dialogue.  But overall, I genuinely have a hard time interpreting this character as straight, and it has a lot to do with the general story and visual elements, and subtleties in general.  The asexual argument could have merit, although I think gay makes a bit more sense given what we've seen.

Regardless of which way he swings, though, I'm not sure that considering him gay necessarily limits his character; if it does, then it definitely isn't any more limiting than thinking he's straight, as many people here seem to.

Overall, I'm very curious and excited to see where the show itself takes us, and I love the amount of analysis people are giving in these threads.
>> ARTICLE
I think her being a trainee geisha is going to be a problem for their relationship, for when she isn't a trainee anymore.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah and can see someone close to Kiku hiring her...
>> ARTICLE
Well she doesn't have to sleep with men , but I think his teacher is the one paying her training , so think he gets dibs on her virginity and dont think she has a choice. 

But that wasn't what I was trying to get at, every girl in his past have for reasons have had to go in separate ways for career paths. She might end up in a position where she can't spend time with him anymore.
>> ARTICLE
I was just here thinking Miyokichi and Kiku are keeping their relationship secret from Kiku's Teacher, does it have to do with the Miyokichi's Mizuage?

Since Miyokichi is an apprentice Geisha means that when the time comes to her to become a full Geisha she'll have to go trough the Mizuage ceremony where the she loses her virginity to a patron that sponsors the ceremony.

Could it be that Kiku's teacher is the patron that is sponsoring Miyokichi's Geisha teachings? and there for the one that has dibs on Miyokichi's 1st time that explains the fact that they need to keep the relationship secret
>> ARTICLE
A little late to the party... Another week, another brilliant episode. I can't remember the last time I was this enthralled with a show.

I started welling up when Yurakutei began to discover his own voice and his self-confidence blossomed. I was just so happy for Yurakutei to finally find his way; his story is so relatable to me. The emotional engagement and investment this show has developed in me for it and its characters is masterful.

And that got me thinking...

The framing of this tale is that it's a story being told by Yurakutei to others. It's already established that he's a master in acting and storytelling. This tale so far has done soooo much to humanize and make Yurakutei seem likeable. But who is to say he's telling us the truth? Why do we assume that he's a reliable narrator? He has a vested interest in making himself look good to those he's telling his story to. *He could be lying out of his ass to them and thus to us.* 
>> ARTICLE
It looks like Kiku's inner exhibitionist has awakened (   )
>> ARTICLE
I DON'T COMMENT A LOT IN THESE THREAD, BUT I MUST SAY THIS ANIME IS MAGNIFICENT!
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn that was amazing episode. Made me genuinely wanna go to theatre. Come to think of it, there's one nearby; I wonder what do they play?
>> ARTICLE
Sorry for the late post, been nursing a migraine for the past 3 days, and had to watch the episode at like 60% volume to get through it. Anyway...

Is this show a drama, or a tragedy? It just might be both, but knowing which it is is going to play a part in trying to see how things shake off eventually. I mean, Bon in the "present" spoke about how Shin-chan is "haunting" him, and the couple of Bon and Miyokichi, which seems like a done-deal at this point? If she ended up carrying Shin's daughter, then something certainly happened. Or, in case this will go more the super drama route, what if Konatsu isn't actually Shin's daughter, but *Bon*'s? I certainly started to wonder after this episode, and there just might be some surprises coming up.

Well, there'll certainly be surprises, no matter what. Even if Shin and Bon truly do fall apart, which they're "destined" to, if we trust the premiere, it'd still be surprising if we look from where we are this episode.

Anyway, Bon and Shin's relationship, if you're trying to look for yaoi undertones you're going to fail, because it feels so much more pronounced than just undertones, eh? :P You do see a reversal of roles from last episode where Bon is involved, where Bon is the "older brother", which Miyokichi even said, this episode Shin brings back women he hired in order to alleviate Bon's despondency, and even with Miyokichi, she rubs his legs and he leans on her, as if he's the little boy and her the older sister, or the mother. Because it's hard being the responsible adult non-stop, especially when you know you're not older than those around you. You end up resenting them for getting all the careless and free moments.

But thankfully, friends know how to step in and try to help. And how much aid is needed anyway, when it's one preferred nature? You just want to feel like you have a choice in the matter.

Speaking of reversals, last episode Bon was told "eroticism comes from flaws," and "you're too perfect." And here he was perfect, not at all flawed and coarse, but it was still considered erotic, a "racy" performance. Not because of how he performed, but because of the *what*. A man acting like a woman, with all the mannerisms, here, was in itself the draw. Him being prim and proper is *exactly* the sort of dissonance that led to eroticism and attraction (not saying "sexual") on part of the viewers.

And it's also nice, that a few episodes back Bon finally found an internal reason to love Rakugo, and now he's had what he really needed, a dose of outside affirmation, not by those who'd tell him he's great just because they love him, when he was at his lowest point. And that's what his "brother", Shin-chan, knew he needed, and strove to provide for him.

It's a performance of Rakugo, so all the characters in this show have flaws. And from flaws flow emotions, and from those emotions, tragedy. And this inevitability is the essence of tragedy, and why we find it dramatic.

([Check out my blog](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/) or [the specific page for all my write-ups on Rakugo Shinju](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-episodic-notes/) if you enjoy reading my stuff.)
>> ARTICLE
> what if Konatsu isn't actually Shin's daughter, but Bon's?

That's been my crack theory ever since Miyokichi was introduced, surprisingly, as a love interest for Kiku.

I really like what you said about raciness in today's play. Nice analysis.
>> ARTICLE
No matter how it plays out with Konatsu, it'd be dramatic and/or tragic. So, something to look forward to.
>> ARTICLE
I enjoyed your comment here a lot, it's really well written. 

> last episode Bon was told "eroticism comes from flaws," and "you're too perfect."

The translation work on this anime is mostly very well done, but maybe this part looks like actually a bit mistranslated if you can connect this to today's episode's racy performance. The original line of 7-daime was talking about /*iroke* which in this context means more about "appeal", "charm", or  "attractiveness", and "flaw" for /*suki* is fine as is, but it originally means "room" and /*suki ga nai* is more like being thoroughly on guard which leads to the next line "you're too perfect". 

**edit** What I mean here is that his guard has been taken away little by little by the relationship with Miyokichi. He's learning to open himself up to her, allowing her to be closer to him, such as telling her things he usually didn't tell others (like this play he was doing.)
>> ARTICLE
"Eroticism" as "appeal" and "charm" is fine. But you'll need to be clearer about the second line with the flaws, cause hopping between lines and translating a word when I don't know which one it is leaves it a bit too disorganized to follow. So what did the Master say, instead of "Eroticism (or charm) comes from flaws"?

If you're saying "You're too on guard, you don't have flaws", then that's fine, but not the line I was talking about, but the one that came prior.

And yes, I agree with the edit, but trying to see what you mean exactly with the preceding paragraph. An explanation would be appreciated, and thanks for the kind words :)
>> ARTICLE
> And here he was perfect, not at all flawed and coarse, but it was **still** considered erotic, a "racy" performance.

This is where I found you saw a connection that wasn't supposed to be in and I assumed it must be from the translation. So, according to you, maybe the culprit is "flaws". As Benten-kozo, Kikuhiko is now feeling ease and composed on the stage, and he isn't wearing his artificial perfect mask he had made up by practice, and he has some room for audience to get close enough to him to be charmed. Showing *suki* is more like showing your true natural self to the audience, rather than flaws, but your usual true self is full of flaws :)

What 7-daime said was that he should take off the guard to attract audience. Perfection does not create charm/eroticism/...whatever "art" needs, but it is created from what we call *suki* <this room that he allows the audience to get close enough to him>. My English isn't probably too bad to explain enough, so, here is what the master exactly said.

I don't know what to say other than everything about this show is perfect. The relationships slowly starting to boil, the voice actors' performances, the mood and atmosphere it sets, they really suck you in. The animation and soundtrack are superb. Can't wait to see how everthing turns out.

This show is so amazing, and I find it so refreshing. It was nice to see Kiku's surprise at how the people in the audience never took their eyes off him. Another 10/10 episode.

Already episode 5 and I want these two to have success so bad!  Felt so bad for Yakumo when he was thinking of dropping Rakugo.  It was awesome the play went really well for them.

Pretty sure it's not a "flashback" so much as the first episode was a framing device for the *real* story.

Yakumo is the second most relatable character this season for me, but to each their own I guess.

This is one of the very few shows that feels like a privilege to watch. I can't imagine being so lucky as to have another show of a similar level pop up this year. With season 2 on the way, this could very well be AOTY.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sure we'll see a lot of great shows throughout this year. Most people didn't really expect Rakugo to translate well to anime either, despite its popularity in the manga front. So maybe we'll see more surprises like this show. One can hope.
>> ARTICLE
When asked why I watch anime I will be pointing to this show from now on. This is one of those shows that comes around and embodies what I love about the medium like Shirobako or Ping Pong The Animation. Can not wait for season 2. 
>> ARTICLE
I feel like comparing it to Shirobako might come to mind, there is still quite a difference. Shirobako retained its 'popular-feel'. It was a unique anime, but there was still fanservice (and I don't mean it in the sexy stuff type of way, I mean it as a fanservice in a deeper meaning to catch peoples attention, deeply ingrained in its core, to make it more accesible). Yeah, that's the word. Shirobako still tried to be accesible to the wider audience.

Shouwa Genroku throws that hipocricy away. That's what I love about it. It's a drop of Ingmar Bergman in the sea of Adam Sendler in the world of anime today. SRGS is not for everybody. Majority of people might find it boring, but for that minority, they found their gold.
>> ARTICLE
I was apprehensive about the first one-third of the episode, since the time skip was pretty abrupt. I still think that jump could have been done way better, and there was that awkward Powerpoint-esque transition into Nozarashi. But, when I look back on the episode, those points were outweighed by the stellar ending. The gravesite scene was just perfect. The smoke and haziness around Sukeroku was beautifully-rendered. And it was very telling to have that glimpse of how haunted Kikuhiko/Yakumo is by the ghosts of the past.

> And being human means changing whatever way it takes to suit your name.

I loved how they tied in the show's pervasive theme of *change* to the special motif they had going with names and identity. A couple of days ago, I commented on some other Rakugo thread that all the characters have various names: nicknames, stage names, real names. And when they assume one name, they are putting on a performance to that particular audience. Bon is a different person than Kikuhiko, is a different person from Yakumo. This is a theme that only became evident in the latter half of the story, but it's one of my favorite points of analysis.

On a lesser note, I enjoyed seeing the glimpses of modernity in this episode. The landscape has totally changed; you can see skyscrapers in the background. And Yotarou wears jeans!

Overall, this show is a **10/10** for me. That's not a snap-judgment; I've been thinking that for weeks now. The story is mature, unique, and thematically rich; the visuals and the audio (both the tour de force in voice acting and the lovely, atmospheric score) never detract from the experience and often elevate it greatly. It taught me something new. It's everything I look for in an anime. SO MUCH SECOND SEASON HYPE! Those trolls over at DEEN waited until the very last minute to tell us. They even built it into the episode!

See you all in the discussion threads for Season 2!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, time skips in general are the bane of storytelling. They also skip the truly juicy and interesting parts of tragedies in a given story. Like how characters show reaction, the immediate fallouts, etc. I get the reason why they do it is to skip the drama and go straight to a stylistic ending or let the characters explain what happened later on. But I still would have liked to see the immediate aftermath of the big tragedy in the show. It's not a fatal flaw or anything, but it's still disappointing.
>> ARTICLE
Immediate aftermath as in Kikuhiko's reaction right after they fell to their deaths at the hotel? Actually, I'm glad they didn't show that. I think it would have been hard to depict that in a way that, to me, wasn't maudlin. I like that some things were left implied.

I'm okay with the fact that this timeskip happened, but it was just too jarring how quickly they jumped from one timeframe to the other without a real transition. My qualm is more with the technicality than the storytelling aspect.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda like how the skip back to the present was accompanied with a crisp clap though, feels almost like awaking from some sort of dream like/hypnosis state.
>> ARTICLE
I really like how they've taken full advantage of the stylistic tools from rakugo itself for some of the direction. The sound design in this show was excellent. Everything in the show exudes the atmosphere of the era and of the trade. The drumming in particular, it's like it's an erratic heartbeat that symbolises the apprehension the viewer feels in regard to what's going to happen next. I really don't have enough pretentious words to describe how much I loved this show.
>> ARTICLE
I just rated a DEEN show 10/10. A DEEN show. "Perfect". It's my fourth 10/10 in something like 300 shows and it's from DEEN... Anything can happen, they said. Well, I guess so.
>> ARTICLE
That one line where kid Konatsu replied saying "My mother" just gave me goosebumps all over my body... 

What an episode though! 

The pacing was quite different to the other episodes but they really set the tone for the next season (thank god we knew about the 2nd season before the episode came out or people would have lost their minds).

I'm really going to miss the dynamic Kiku had with the other characters and just hope that Yotaro can fill that MC role well enough. Kiku had that suave nature about him which made him such a good MC and narrator, which is where i don't think Yotaro's lively nature will quite give the same feeling of tension and suspense like Kiku does. 

Shouwa had such believable drama for me that that it really sucks you into the narrative and you could really resonate with the characters emotions.  The balance between humor and anxiousness is what really made this show for me so i hope they can continue that theme.

Plus, Kontasu's child and Yotaro wanting to succeed the Sukeroku name were really surprising plot points for next season, so i can't wait to see how that one goes. 

I can't really classify it as ending as so much of the episode was preparing for the next season but still, overall was a fantastic anime to watch!
>> ARTICLE
> Kiku had that suave nature about him which made him such a good MC and narrator, which is where i don't think Yotaro's lively nature will quite give the same feeling of tension and suspense like Kiku does.

I'm actually really excited about this. Miyokichi and Sukeroku were certainly very impassioned people and I shudder to think of what their fights were like when they were together, but we saw everything through Kikuhiko's lens. And whenever Kiku came into conflict with the other two, he was very subdued. Neither of them could really bring themselves to get mad at him, and so their arguments tended to be totally one-sided and kind of passive-aggressive. With season two's main characters being Yotaro and Konatsu (and maybe Konatsu's babydaddy?), I can't see any of them bringing that kind of subtlety to the conflicts. I think season two will be much more raw and wild.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh definitely true! Even the rakugo being perform was much more raw and wild and don't get me started on the audience!

With those two as the main characters i guess it's going to be very different from the original but i hope they keep the way the story progressed so elegantly and naturally. Every interaction between the characters was always given enough time to properly explain the thoughts and emotions but still have the characters evolve over time, so i hope they keep that kind of pacing for the next season.

Either way i'm sure i will love it!

Every new season brings with it poorly written, badly adapted LN-based shows. Anime is in a constant cycle of doom and rescue.

That went by faster than expected. So they're skipping Yotaro's learning process to concentrate on him refining his own style and paving a new path for rakugo. Sounds interesting.

"That's an old-fashioned way of thinking."  
I really liked that line. A lot of time has passed indeed.

That short haired Konatsu tease at the end though.

I liked this. It was very unique in terms of what I expect from an anime. I'm really starting to like DEEN recently. S2 was confirmed!

DEEN came out in full force this season. Definitely impressed.

You think Rakugo went mostly unnoticed because it fell *under the table*? Nah, it was soaring so very high above all else, most people couldn't even dream of something like this, even if they tried.

I'mma dip out since I'm still in the midst of catching up (left about halfway through the discussions because the weekly wait was actually killing me), but I've just gotta say, it's so great to see just how happy and excited people are getting over the s2 announcement and how much love this show is receiving from our community. right now it's [RedditAnimeList's #52](http://www.redditanimelist.com/index.php?page=2), and everywhere I go in Winter discussion threads it's received nothing but praise left and right. it's come a long way since back when [the first PV got a whopping total of 8 upvotes and 4 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3nszzd/video_1st_pv_for_rakugo_shinju_tv_anime/) and most Winter speculation threads had handwaved it as a DEEN trainwreck ([ctrl+f'ing them reveals some pretty sad antihype](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3paco7/winter_2016_chart_v1/?limit=500)). hell, being buried in an unusually late timeslot and being licensed for stream [only a few minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/402ngh/crunchyroll_to_simulcast_showa_genroku_rakugo/) before the first episode aired gave it all the tells of being a show meant to be season fodder. but now, looking at all the love on here and it catching a sort of wind in Japan, I can safely say this is probably one of the most lovely cases of an underdog story I've ever had the pleasure to watch build over all my years of watching anime. while MAL scores aren't always the best indicator of quality, considering the jump from it being around the rank 1000's well into the day after episode 1 aired and it being currently *#105* just tells you how impressive the community support has been.    
  
and boy, does it deserve it!! the storytelling, both on and off the stage, is just so elegantly executed that, alongside some of the stunning imagery, outstanding direction, and wonderful soundtrack, it always feels like something special is happening right in front of you. hell, I watched episode 1 for the 4th time yesterday (5th if we count me watching the raw [Yotarou-hen OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25801/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu__Yotarou_Hourou-hen)) and I was still catching some details I'd never picked up on. it's just so artfully crafted in the manners in which it portrays the setting, the characters, and their motivations, that it manages to be profound and powerful without resorting to typical writing gimmicks or melodramatic exposition. it has its own identity and captures its own type of feel, making it a show truly unlike even its own genre peers, regardless of medium. on a purely emotional level, it's gotten me to laugh out loud, sob like a baby, cringe in frustration, slobber with the BL-service, and ultimately smile harder than I have in a while. sufficed to say, I'm in love with this little show, and the [season 2 announcement](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-01/showa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-anime-gets-2nd-season/.100561) made me melt into a ball of giddy glee.  
  
I'm going back to my binge now, but thanks all of you for making the discussions a lot of fun and for putting up with all my fujoshi shit during the first half, I appreciate it!! ;) hope to see you guys when season 2 comes out, we're in for a [complete experience](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-05/showa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-manga-to-end-in-10th-volume/.98363)!!

It really is going to be interesting that in 2016, people might actually be going out of their way to be hyped for Studio Deen works than using them as a sounding board as the industry's worst.

I always thought they got a lot of bum rap, so it's great to see them finally win people over with these shows. 

And yes, the details being shown off so well really captures the feel of Rakugo as well, where some masters says the performances can be made or broken by a matter of centimeters in how you perform your gestures. So it's great that the animators really understood it.

> Winter speculation threads had handwaved it as a DEEN trainwreck

I'll admit I was one of the naysayers in the thread you linked, and I'm quite happy to be entirely wrong about it.
>> ARTICLE
Earlier this season, I'd made a thread condensing the [top 100 underwatched](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/429ndg/top_100_anime_over_1000_popularity/) (popularity over 1000) series on MAL because I personally enjoy watching good, underwatched series for a reason or another. I did have my eyes on Rakugo ever since it was announced though because a performance anime under drama and josei tags sounded wonderful.

Anyway, after 2 episodes, Rakugo ranked 66th on that list with a score of 7.98, and 1648th in popularity. Although many have yet to complete the series, as of right now, Rakugo would stand at the top of the list, with a score of 8.62. Of course that means it hasn't gained enough popularity (1121th) over the course of the season to make it out, but that's quite the boost.

It personally makes my top 10 anime, and I've already rewatched it... but my top 5 has been pretty solid for a long time now. Very much looking forward to season 2 obviously!
>> ARTICLE
I'm blown away by the season 2 announcement.  
Was it planned like this from the start? Is this somehow co-funded by some cultural education ministry? I mean the sales couldn't possibly had anything to do with it, no matter how great it was. The sales were terrible in every chart I've seen.
>> ARTICLE
Season 2 was most certainly planned the whole time, and this season was animated in advance, so they can take their time with the next season (maybe already working on it!???). I'm super looking forward to it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking that manga or OST sales might have had something to do with it. IIRC the manga did get a boost. Though yeah, it looks like it may have always had a season 2 on the way.

Kind of a miracle. :)

Wow, what an ending. And now with season 2 confirmed, I am more than glad to continue this story.

We are back in the present, and I am happy that time has passed there as well. The story has not stagnated during the flashback/backstory, it went on. I like that, now we can catch up and continue with the next generation. 

[That scene with Sukeroku's ghost, oh man.](https://49.media.tumblr.com/2809f185ef10173f3b0932d62b8fff39/tumblr_nzwuarg0Rj1v2y42bo1_500.gif)

I am so happy that I watched this series, I would have easily missed it. I discovered the beauty of Josei and Rakugo, and Studio DEEN have redeemed themselves for me. 

What else can I say? Realistic, loveable and relatable characters, fantastic jazz soundtrack, beautiful backgrounds, wonderful direction, yes - this is my AOTS.
>> ARTICLE
If I hadn't already known we were getting a season 2 that ending would have been pretty upsetting! 

Anyway, this show really and truly blew me away with its utterly engrossing characters, direction, and music. As a theater fan I liked being engrossed in a new art form, even if there is a cultural divide between myself and rakugo.

It's kind of funny, around 3 episodes in I started wondering when we'd get back to Yotaro and Konatsu, but I ended up becoming ridiculously attached to the stories of Kikuhiko and Sukeroku. I never wanted the flashbacks to end despite having knowledge of the inevitable tragedy. So now we are finally back to Yotaro and Konatsu, we're even further along in Yotaro's story than I guessed we'd get right away. It'll take some adjusting to pick up the threads of the new era, but I am so looking forward to seeing where things go. It seems like the ghosts of the past are far from being gone.

As a final aside, I was a big fan of [this shot](http://imgur.com/FpHbH1R) of Kikuhiko/the 8th Yakumo's eyes. You can really feel the exhaustion, pain, and guilt this guy carries with him.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, I actually disagree with you COMPLETELY on the ending being upsetting without the second season.  The ending...man, it tied together the narrative of the story SO PERFECTLY that the show itself becomes a rakugo story.  Those words would fit seemlessly into the finale of a rakugo story focused on the fate/irony of the names Yakumo and Sukeroku.  A constant cycle of dismissal and tragic showing up.
>> ARTICLE
The post credit scene would've informed you about season 2 anyways. 
>> ARTICLE
this anime does such a good job with showing how their age and the events that have happened to them affect the way they look. 
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't Kikuhiko eyes remind you of his masters [eyes](https://otakuganbaranai.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/shouwa1003.jpg?w=676) now? I just love how this show links everything together like it's no big thing.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know where to start, was busy watching figure skating world championship, also wanted to chew the final episode enough before I comment anything here, and now I'm so late for this final episode hype train! Too bad, but I enjoyed all your comments fully!

Another skipped rakugo story played by Yotaro in this episode: "Ukiyo-doko/Gossips at a Barber" (and "Nozarashi").

It is an anthology of funny gossips often taken place at a barber shop, like a collection of mini-stories, teaching you how Edo culture was like. Back in Edo era, people gathered at a barber and gossiped and played games together like a pleb's salon. This title was chosen here because Yotaro just had his hair cut at a barber. I think this could also represent how Yota is currently keeping the rakugo tradition with a very small number of rakugo fans. So, later after he actually inherits the name Sukeroku and becomes Shin'uchi, we *may* get to see "the changes" Sukeroku was talking about in future Yota's rakugo, and then this should be a contrasting story when we look back at this episode later. 

"Nozarashi" making Konatsu cry was a very memorable scene for me. I wonder if she actually remembers not just her father's but also how Kiku and her father duo'ed the title.  

Sexism - I find it very interesting that people in this subreddit are more bothered about Kiku not allowing Konatsu do rakugo and such stuff here and there in this show. Kiku actually mentions a bit more on his opinion why in the original manga and the part is skipped in anime, and I wonder if season 2 actually explains more about it. If it makes you feel any better, the VA for Sukeroku's childhood was a professional female rakugo-ka. (Yes, there are female rakugo-ka now, and we have always had female manzai-shi.) 

2nd Season - I was hoping they would make it since they used a lot of veteran VAs... it was unbelievable for me that they would hire Seki(Yota) and Yamaguchi(Amaken) to do only that bit for this show, and thought they were actually planning to make 2nd season no matter what. The DVD/BD sales didn't look good, but seemed like it has been receiving super-good receptions from everywhere, the critiques and those in the anime industry, even good words from rakugo world. I barely saw negative reactions to this show here (or didn't notice) but all praises. The only negative comments I've seen so far are those who don't enjoy this type of shows, and some "rakugo-fans" who didn't like music coming in the middle of rakugo part (I think that part was better accepted by non-rakugo fans to feel the mood of upsurge in the theater). In one of the talk shows I watched, Seki was asking the guests "Please do NOT buy DVDs! or I'll have to manage playing Shin'uchi rakugo that has to be better than what I did in ep 1!" and so on, jokingly. People are hosting a lot of show-related rakugo events, and it looks like even more people are interested in rakugo itself too, thanks to this show.

---

Names - u/qkhb mentioning names is an interesting point. I guess I should share a bit more of what their names represent in Japanese that is easily missed by those who are not familiar with the culture. 

Yotaro/ is a famous name starring in many rakugo stories, who represents someone very dumb but with very sweet and adorable ignorance. Let me explain the general Yotaro concept (not the manga char Yotaro, but as a rakugo char) here. His ignorance (or innocence) makes a lot of stories funny and make people laugh out even serious tragedy or troubles. Always very optimistic with positive thinking, but very slow-witted, the complete opposite of a smart guy. What he does is generally stupid, but his innocence and enthusiasm or blind faith in whatever advised from others give people a very warm feeling and nobody can hate him but adore him. Yotaro in rakugo removes any negative thoughts such as sadness, anger, envy, complaints and all. We haven't seen much of Yotaro in this show yet, but we can already see that he is so fit with this name. 

One thing often pointed out is that in real life, rakugo masters would NEVER name someone Yotaro, because it's a char in rakugo stories. So this part is actually very unrealistic, but I think it's okay to enjoy this as symbolism. 

Sukeroku/ is also a very famous char in Kabuki, as [one of the best 18 plays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki_J%C5%ABhachiban). Anyone who is familiar with Kabuki would know Sukeroku and who he represents. And people living in Japan, even without the knowledge of kabuki, often hear of this name as a restaurant or food shops names, and also Sukeroku-zushi (sushi package of inari + makizushi) in convenience stores. 

[Sukeroku is generally a very handsome guy and a popular hero](http://kabuki21.com/sukeroku.php), usually [wearing a strip of purple cloth wrapped around his head](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%A9%E5%85%AD#/media/File:Danjuro_Ichikawa_IX_as_Sukeroku.jpg). His popularity is among Edo plebs, and he is often a criminal, but "beats the strong, helps the weak" kind of guy; his crimes are often from the result of helping the weak Edo plebs against the big power, rich samurai and the evil scums who exploit the weak. He breaks the rules, for the sake of people. He is popular among girls too, with his girl friend, a beautiful geisha called Agemaki. Also, in Ichikawa family's kabuki, Sukeroku's full name is "Hanakawado Sukeroku" - if you remember the cherry blossom scene with Miyo. She says "Hanakawado no Sukeroku-san", and that is coming from this name and the kabuki role of Sukeroku associated with sakura flowers (often called "Edo-zakura"), and the place they met was a town called Hanakawado, in Asakusa area. 

**EDIT**   
*There seems to be a rakugo-ka called Kaminari-mon Sukeroku(9th) in real life. In one of the episode, the association president said "Sukeroku? Uncommon name, can't remember it well", but that is a fiction. [According to its wiki page, 7th used this name in 1942-61, and 8th 1962-91.](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9B%B7%E9%96%80%E5%8A%A9%E5%85%AD)*

Kikuhiko/, is a bit complicated. *Kiku* is a flower, chrysanthemum, so it gives a very feminine air and also nobleness when you hear it. Benten-Kozo he played (wearing female kimono) has a dialogue of his own introduction and calls himself Benten-kozou Kiku-no-suke(). *Hiko* is the same as , and it is an eulogistic name for a boy, usually associated with excellency and great talents. You can see why Sukeroku didn't find it fair that Kiku got this beautiful name while he got a boring "Hatsutarou/(first son)". 

Yakumo/, is an ancient name taken from Japanese Shinto myth. It is often said that means eight(multi)-fold clouds, we do not know for sure, but it gives us this mysterious air. According to the myth, one of the very famous gods called Susano'o made this poem chanting Yakumo, as the very first poem in Japan. 

---

Finally, I want to mention another skipped story, "Okechimyaku" played by Sukeroku in episode 6, when Kiku played "Shinagawa Shinjuu" and felt so good for his first time. 

Okechimyaku is something like an indulgence of Buddhism. If you pay a lot of money and get a stamp of this Okechimyaku (in this story here, get your forehead stamped), you can go to a heaven even if you have done any horrible crimes. At this point of Edo era, everyone gets this stamps, so "the hell" was suffering from lack of people coming in. They decided to talk to [Ishikawa Goemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishikawa_Goemon), the famous thief who was boiled alive as an execution and now in the hell, and  told him to steal this stamp. They even told him that he would be appointed an executive of the hell if he succeeded. So, Goemon went down to this temple in the human world, succeeded stealing it after some efforts. He was so pleased with his success that he had stamped his own forehead with it by mistake and he got sent to the heaven instead. 

Sukeroku didn't really mind going to the hell for Miyokichi. Goemon wanted to be this "executive of the hell". But I think what symbolizes this story is that Sukeroku, like Goemon, went to the heaven, leaving others in despair. 

On the other hand, Kiku who played "Shinagawa Shinjuu", was asked to die together with a geisha, but didn't die, like the story he played, and now he is stuck with this living hell. 

Hope to see you all in season 2! (or maybe in "Fune wo Amu" this fall!)

WOW, I loved reading your section on the meanings of their names. Super informative. I agree that as a name, Hatsuta pales in comparison to Kikuhiko...but you'd think Shin would be happy with the validation that he really is the first son/elder brother.
>> ARTICLE
Ha ha, yeah, indeed, I guess that may be exactly why 7th Yakumo gave him that name. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that Sukeroku didn't feel like he was being treated as a son, though they looked more like a real father and a son with conflicts, compared to Kiku and 7th's apprentice and master relationship. 
>> ARTICLE
There are several archetypes for father/son relationships, and I think they fit one very well. His departure reminded me a lot of the parable of the prodigal son.

> Sexism - I find it very interesting that people in this subreddit are more bothered about Kiku not allowing Konatsu do rakugo and such stuff here and there in this show

you know, it's very strongly against sensitivity of many people, 'you can't do this, because you are a woman' is now a statement resulting in a public outrage for most of the subjects. I find it interesting that you find it interesting, IMO the fact that it bothers people is totally to be expected.
>> ARTICLE
I know what you mean, but the important thing is that it's never the message of the show. It is rather pointing out the argument by letting Kiku say that and why he says that. Instead, Sukeroku was teaching Konatsu rakugo and was praising her voice, but most people ignore that part and no comments from there while discussing this. 
>> ARTICLE
I must admit I don't understand what you are trying to say.

> It is rather pointing out the argument by letting Kiku say that and why he says that. 

From my, let's assume - modern and Western perspective: I can see no argument here. Kiku says what he says because he is a misogynistic jerk-ass. There are reasons why he is such a person, but they don't excuse him in any way.

>  Sukeroku was teaching Konatsu rakugo and was praising her voice, but most people ignore that part and no comments from there while discussing this. 

I don't understand why people should notice that and what is in that fact to comment or discuss. Sukeroku was teaching Konatsu, ok. And?

Not sure where you heard KonoSuba 2nd season is this Summer. There has been no announcement on it's release date. Unless I'm horribly mistaken.
>> ARTICLE
Started with the best first episode of the season, ended with the best final episode of the season. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a masterpiece, but Rakugo Shinjuu was certainly beautiful and unique. I never pause while watching an episode of anything to take screenshots, but this time I just couldn't resist taking a few pictures of all these characters I've grown to love.

[Miyokichi](https://i.gyazo.com/c75b0f6f9e5455e356eaef93065d6262.png) is beautiful and precious and has a special place in my heart. She kinda turned into a terrible scumbag near the end, but I can't hate her for it. Her story was so tragic and I love her so much.

Is it just me or does [Kikuhiko](https://i.gyazo.com/2757e7e31baa4eb22b9965eec71266f6.png) look an awful lot like [Kaiki](http://wrongeverytime.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/commie-monogatari-series-second-season-19-77d51973-mkv_snapshot_18-18_2013-12-02_18-21-26.jpg) here? Well, best boy still looks damn good as old [Yakumo](https://i.gyazo.com/c0d85a526abb3df29bb53c92d135a6b1.png), and his line saying "Women can do whatever they want, just like men" shows that he has grown a lot even just since he appeared in episode one.

God DAMN I missed [Yotaro](https://i.gyazo.com/015d10b4939d83b9be81ab070cf1210d.png) and his stupid face! His big performance in the first episode remains the highlight of the series to me. I wonder if his former boss will return for season two.

[Konatsu](https://i.gyazo.com/e9b38fd5f57f63d7735c8b09e6806f0b.png) is hot as hell. Her story is the one I'm most looking forward to in the future. Who wants to make a bet that she'll become the ninth generation Yakumo?

As much as I love Konatsu though, I'm sure we can all agree that [Matsuda](https://i.gyazo.com/85db7a0b3c6872059c85c1ed4d6fff1d.png) is the real best girl. 

I seriously teared up upon seeing [Sukeroku's ghost.](https://i.gyazo.com/95e92dccc8cf4a2cd3eeb726fc123576.png) I think he'd be damn proud of how his friend has done, both in rakugo and with his daughter. And it was wonderful to see him fade away into the [next generation.](https://i.gyazo.com/0cfeaeae467b1d885c1c9c7509d74ae3.png)

And finally, no Yotaro, that ending is not enough for me! Season two!!! I loved the teaser at the end, and I could not be [looking forward](https://i.gyazo.com/3de052ae9cb0e486786db5e5bc07d756.png) to this more!

> I wouldn't go so far as to call it a masterpiece

Oh, I would. The things this show did you're not going to find anywhere else in anime. The job the voice actors did, the story it told, the pacing, how wonderfully well developed the characters are. And that's to say nothing of what's to come next season, that'll completely change how you feel about what you just watched. This show was unadulterated magic. It's gems like this that validate why I still watch anime.
>> ARTICLE
My only issue with this show was that it felt like it only covered one arc. But now we know for sure the second season is coming, I can finally breathe a sigh of relief in that this show won't forever be a 'one arc and done' anime. But it still was quite a ride. 
>> ARTICLE
The conclusion we were given with this season was honestly fulfilling enough of a story that I'd have been ok w/ it being an ending, even if it's obviously ideal to have more. It was a natural ending point.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, no doubt whatsoever. 10 from start to finish, imo. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed, easy 10 for me. I had no complaints whatsoever. And that OP tho

Never dreamed one of my no-skip openings would be for this show, and jazz-based too!

I love the OP but damn that ED is so good too. Rarely hear just instrumental OPs/EDs, and when one this good comes along you can't help but appreciate it.
>> ARTICLE
The OP is Sukeroku, the ED is Kikuhiko. Both are great in their own way and different examples in a genre that's faded and largely given way to newer forms of music.
>> ARTICLE
May I ask what genre the OP would fall into? I really like the feel of it and would love to find more songs like it
>> ARTICLE
Seems like it draws primarily from swing.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrwzvuZ0s-k) is another modern example.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you very much, I really liked the song you included!

Would you possibly have any more in which the singer sings in a "seductive" way like in the OP?

&nbsp;

On an off-note, what did you think about Shouwa Rakugo? 
I personally really enjoyed it, but I would have preferred if they didn't do that time-skip after the story.

>> ARTICLE
This episode went by way too fast. I really thought that I was only halfway through the episode and BAM!, it was over. haha. I'm not going to go into a long discussion today about why I loved the show but thankfully I put this on my PTW list before the Winter 2016 season started. The storytelling was riveting and the characters showcased "human level" emotions that made you feel for them and with them. It's definitely my AOTS and thank you DEEN for giving me a fantastic ride this season with this and KonoSuba.  

EDIT: And YESSSS to the another season of Shouwa!

I can't write anything of merit in English, so instead:  

9/10

Wow. This has been one hell of a show this season. It's kind of funny, about a third of the way through I was wondering how the flashback would fit in and how far it would go.

Now that it's taken most of the season and ended, I'm finding it very hard to let go. I miss Sukeroku, the show feels hollow without him. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, it's crazy how the flashbacks *were* the entirety of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Best show of the season with one of the best OPs of the season too.  
This and Osomatsu-san are the only non-sequel anime I watched while airing that I gave 9/10 immediately, and it fully deserves it. It might be a 10 if S2 is as good as this one.

I really liked the relationship that Kiku and Sukeroku had. It made the flashback story more interesting than the current one to me.
>> ARTICLE
It's really hard to put the beauty of this series into words, but many others have done so already, so I'll just say this - it's *such* an honor to listen to masters like Ishida Akira, Yamadera Kouichi, Hayashibara Megumi, and Tomokazu Seki bring these characters and rakugo (A completely foreign concept to me prior to this show) to life. They are all legends of the seiyuu industry, and SGRS might have been the best conduit possible to demonstrate their respective legacies.

Funnily enough, this show might be a top-ranked performance for each member of that quartet, despite everyone's extremely long resume.

Aw come on, Konatsu went and had a kid with some nobody? Yota's reaction was pretty cool, though, haha.

I also wanted to take a moment to appreciate how beautiful that scene with Kiku talking to Sukeroku's ghost was. Made me tear up a bit.
>> ARTICLE
> some nobody?

Literally the only problem i had with this show.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it'll become relevant in some way? It's kind of weird that we wouldn't even know who this guy is, but if it doesn't matter at the ends of the story, well, more time to focus on the parts we care about.

The kid has black hair in the preview. Who is to say it was just some nobody?
>> ARTICLE
You don't think..... she fucked Kiku. I don't think I'll be able to accept tht
>> ARTICLE
Nah, no fucking way. That'd be so screwed up in so many ways. It would be over the top IMHO for this show's standards, and very out of character for Kiku.

That's like adding [Erased](/s "Kenya") in the suspect list in Bokumachi just because there weren't enough suspects.

*edit* what Kiku actually said in that scene was "/about raising your daughter like that".
>> ARTICLE
And so, the best show of the season comes to an end, opening a lot of new questions to be answered in the season 2 (I still can't believe we're getting one, I'm so incredibly happy).

This last episode was great all around, closing out on the flashback arc and giving us even more reasons on why Konatsu dislikes Kiku so much.

Coming back to Yotaro is like a breath of fresh air, he's a great character, and adult Konatsu is probably the most interesting character of the series. Her being pregnant only adds more mistery to her current situation.

I don't know, I'm not good at writing lenghty reviews or shit like that. I loved this series, and it is definitely AOTS. 9/10
>> ARTICLE
Only 9/10? This is 10/10 material for me right there. The characters development, build up, unique story telling and rakugo performances, all you could ever wish in a masterpiece.

>> ARTICLE
I'm also giving it a 9, waiting for season 2, if it holds up both will get their deserved 10s
>> ARTICLE
Damn, that scene at the grave just makes me that much more sad that we probably won't see anymore of Sukeroku and Kiku together. Such a fantastic show. Easy 10/10.

Side note, what's up with the sudden yellow subtitles Crunchyroll used for this episode? Not a fan. Hopefully just an April Fool's joke.
>> ARTICLE
Well, the credits are running as I type this. It was way better than expected, even tough I was disappointed at first when I realised that the show would be all about the past. Still, even so it turned out to be really good.

EDIT: Oh, Season 2 confirmed? That's nice.

I think this was my favourite anime of all time as well as probably the only anime I could say was perfect.

Everytime I heard the OP, I couldn't help but remember one of my favorite earlier anime OP's, [R.O.D.](https://youtu.be/Ks_idCKrshY)  

Rakugo's feels sexier, more like a James Bond song, but both were pretty great.

I did not know this existed prior to now, but it instantly landed on my PTW list. [OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/208/ROD_OVA) before [TV series](http://myanimelist.net/anime/209/ROD_the_TV)?

Yeah. Short and fun. I think the TV show covers a different set of characters later on in the same universe. Go figure, it was Studio Deen, too. I never realized.
>> ARTICLE
I really enjoyed this show so much more than I thought it would, this is easily my AOTS.

I got to say after being in the past for so long it's weird coming back to present and seeing Bon like that and the way he turned out. I really hope he gets a happy ending or something in the next season.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I can't really see Bon be cold and aloof forever. I think he also acted a bit like that to the kids he is mentoring because he didn't want to go through the drama of losing them again. But maybe he will give it a chance this time.

I'm *so* happy that this isn't really over, I'm looking forward to getting more of Yotaro and Konatsu. But this was easily one of the best anime of the season, IMO. 
>> ARTICLE
Second season, I can't wait, this was fantastic, it was beautiful, art direction, music choice, the style, everything, what a wonderful piece of anime we have now thanks to DEEN.

10 out of fucking 10 for me, amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Wow that a great series, that's going straight in the roster for when people ask about 'mature' anime.

So many little shocks in just that episode that I'm really glad there's going to be a second season. I'd lost my shit if that had been it.

Though the moment in the smoke with Sukeroku's ghost was just amazing.
>> ARTICLE
holy fuck that ending

first 5 minutes made me tear up no lie

When Konatsu was like "My mother" along with the look on her face sent shivers down my spine holy shit. 

and that gravestone scene...omg that was amazing. 11/10 AOT 
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, all that set-up for a second season that's still months away. Don't do this to me DEEN. What's going to happen with Konatsu's baby? How does Yakumo react to Yotaro wanting to inherit the Sukeroku name? I NEED TO KNOW DAMMIT.

Anyway. This show was amazing. It's been so long since I've seen a show as well-crafted as this. Everything from the character interactions, to the little details that flesh out the setting, even the cinematography, was absolutely perfect. It feels like a privilege to watch, something truly one-of-a-kind. [**And now, the wait begins.**]   
 (#boredranta)
>> ARTICLE
Well, DEEN has solidified there position as "firmly out of the shit pit" finally. This season they picked two great series to adapt that worked perfectly for what they can do, and they did amazing jobs with both. I will admit, I didn't keep up with this show at first just because I understood I wouldn't enjoy it as much if I didn't watch it all at once, but I had to wait for this week's episode and it was well worth it.

Yotaro is a really interesting piece in this show because all of the development that we saw Sukeroku and Yakumo go through happened to him but offscreen. He seems very distinctly different from Sukeroku despite his stylistic similarities, and that might be because of Yakumo's way of training him, but it could just be that he has a different mindset about everything. While rakugo was the only thing that Suke cared about from a young age, Yotaro is doing it because he fell in love with it at a bad time in his life and has gotten back on his feet through it. I am really looking forward to see how this thing with Suke's daughter will pan out, and how Yotaro's and her relationship will change over time. And how Yakumo deals with Yotaro wanting to take on the Sukeroku name and likely the next generation.

I really enjoyed this series. I honestly want to write about it but I am not sure what aspects to focus on, so I will hold off until I get some writing done for a piece on JoJo I have had in the works for awhile. But I plan to join in on these discussions come season 2.
>> ARTICLE
I managed to hold it in for only so long, but once Kiku "saw" Sukeroku in the smoke at the Yurakutei gravesite and started basically begging to be admonished for his personal (raising Konatsu) and professional (Rakugo) failings I started crying and I didn't stop till the episode was over. I can't help but think that he still believes that Sukeroku would've been a far better vanguard for Rakugo in the modern era and he's likely been emotionally exhausted over the years still trying to deal with the loss and his own feelings of inadequacy and being left behind.

I'll eagerly await S2 and hold out the hope that Kiku and Konatsu can come to some sort of understanding. Kiku has not been a particularly good parental figure, but that was clearly a role he wasn't planning on taking and he handled having to raise a child (whose presence would also constantly remind him of his own personal loss) pretty poorly after the fact. They've both got a love of Rakugo at their core -- especially an emotional connection to Sukeroku's style. I don't know if they'll ever be on truly good terms again, but I hope they can bridge the gap a bit.

Edit:  
I also want to say that this series has had me at probably my most emotionally attached and devastated in years. I don't think I've cried this much over characters since S4 of Natsume Yuujinchou (and that was mostly happy "proud of your progress, kid" crying).
>> ARTICLE
This was a very fitting end to the story. We get some of the continuation to the backstory in the start. I liked how they didn't dwell too much on it. I liked that about the funeral for the previous Yakumo too. There's no dramatic crying or yelling, just people mourning a loss in a natural way. It feels much more immersive when there's a touch of reality in a show. Kiku's character development seemed to reach it's peak with his decision to inherit the Yakumo name. He's lived a large part of his life for rakugo and he decides to keep it alive even though he was so against inheriting the name before. The scene with him bowing and tears rolling down his face was quite powerful.

Also, Kiku could not be any worse with dealing with kids, could he? He already lived most of his life with Sukeroku who acted like one but he really didn't show much patience for Konatsu but who knows, he does seem to be the kind who has trouble showing affection. Thank God for Matsuda-san being there for both of them. He's been supporting everyone since the start and I'd like to declare him the background MVP of the show. 

We finally return to the present to see a grown-up Konatsu, older Kiku and Matsuda, and Yotaro with a shaved head. Oh, and his name is Yota now, it seems. His similarities with Sukeroku are much more apparent now but he still seems like a much better person if only for his ability to refrain from being self indulgent. Though, I did like how they showed a parallel between them with Yotaro offering to (marry?) raise Konatsu's child with her. That was a really sweet moment and I need to see them get together and hopefully have a happy ending unlike the previous couple, pls.

The last scene at the grave was brilliant with Kiku still being haunted by the memory of Sukeroku both with him seeing the hallucination and his surprise at Yota's request. It continues the trend of Yakumo receiving a disciple who becomes Sukeroku and Rakugo-ka's with his style coming back to the next Yakumo. I'm sure he would be a fitting successor as Sukeroku though I wonder what would happen to the Yakumo name. Perhaps Yota inherits both of them thus embodying the new form of Rakugo which will live on through the ages? I hope so. 

Overall, this was an absolutely spectacular show and fully deserves a 10 from me. It stayed consistent with phenomenal storytelling and some of the best characters I've seen in recent seasons. The setting really came to life and the Rakugo was also entertaining to watch. I look forward to the second season and I have some extremely high expectations which I believe will be met or even surpassed. Until then.
>> ARTICLE
> Perhaps Yota inherits both of them thus embodying the new form of Rakugo which will live on through the ages? I hope so.

I hope so too! (Many rakugo-ka gets multiple names, but do not use one that is already in use. In this case, he cannot become 9th Yakumo while 8th Yakumo is still playing rakugo as Yakumo. Asking for Yakumo when Yakumo isn't retired yet is like asking him to stop rakugo and it would be too rude.)

btw, Yota is just a short form of Yotaro, like Mike for Michael. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, this show was definitely AOTS. All the characters just felt...real. I'm glad there's another season to look forward to since this one ended on such a cliffhanger. This show managed to draw out nearly every emotion in me throughout the season, and I teared up when Sukeroku showed up at the end. I'll wait a few weeks before finally reviewing it, but I think it'll make my personal top 10. 
>> ARTICLE
I really liked this one! It was more mature than most of the anime that have come out recently. It introduced me to rakugo which looked pretty neat. The characters were well developed, and the drama had me looking forward to the next weeks episode! 10/10

It looks like a season 2 is on the way!  Yay!

Great anime, great experience. Looking forward to season 2!

"Let me inherit the Sukeroku name."

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU--!!

But, based on season 2 preview where the paper says, "Super-popular storyteller Yotaro (Previously Sukeroku) was formerly Yakuza!" he's going to get the name.  But I'm excited to see how it plays out!

10/10, buying the blu-ray.
>> ARTICLE
What are your thoughts on Kiku being so cold to Konatsu? I would of thought that he would treat her well, for the sake of his friend and almost maybe out of a sense of guilt. Before Sukeroku died, he was much kinder to Konatsu and they had some tender moments (cutting her hair).
I also kinda wish we could've seen some more of their history, if they were always so cold to one another, how did they even live together for so long? Baffles me.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, was quite bad imo. So nice before, then when you're a big factor in both her parents dying, become horrible? She's doing Rakugo on the porch alone, you come and be horrible? Bizarre.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Maybe we will get more info on his thought process throughout that time, in the second season. 
>> ARTICLE
Just as my opinion, I think he treated her like an independent adult instead of a child, while not showing her enough love she deserved as a child (and not allowing her rakugo). But then, it could also be, in a way, easier for her to have someone to blame for her parents deaths, if she wished so. Kiku showing her enough love means she is going to lose the person she could blame on otherwise. Not saying this mindset is a right thing, but this is how I think Kiku thinks, as he has nobody else than himself to blame for all the losses he has been suffering from, and most likely Kiku desperately wants to be blamed for their deaths because he feels guilty no matter what the truth is, and this is the only way Kiku thinks he could atone for. 

> how did they even live together for so long?

In the show, when Yota was talking to Konatsu, it was implied that Konatsu left the house after the long flashback story and lived alone for a while, but when she got pregnant, she came back to inform them of the news and then decided to live together again by the strong request of angry Matsuda-san after her pregnancy. 

Also, before that, in one of the flashback scenes, Konatsu said "I won't leave this house, cause I'm gonna kill you (in the future)" and Kiku replied as "Then, kill me". So, it's like, Konatsu stayed for her revenge, while Kiku is waiting for Konatsu to kill him, and it sounds like he wouldn't even blame her if she really did so - he sounds like he wants to be killed. 
>> ARTICLE
It's cool how we both thought of his sense of guilt as a factor.. But the way we think it should affect him is different. I thought it would make him nicer to Konatsu, you're thinking it's the reason why he's so cold. Interesting!
>> ARTICLE
Hello everyone. This time I took pain-killers 30 minutes before the show aired, to be here with you. Been having migraines every week on Friday night the last month or so, so my post went up mid-Saturday quite often, so people were likely to miss it. Well, I'm here on time this time around! This episode had a *lot* to cover, so I'll be starting with this episode, and then continue to discuss the show as a whole later on. I've been exposed to some spoilers last week, but I'm not going to let that seep in. Well, let's get started.

The best place to start would be with the end. When this episode ended, we already knew that the show has been green-lit for another season. And while you could say that the show definitely [ended on](http://i.imgur.com/exmrixB.jpg) [a cliffhanger](http://i.imgur.com/edEelTE.jpg), but I actually think if the show *had* ended here, then it'd have been terribly climactic (yes, you read that right, *climactic*, not "anti").

Why? Because Bon's arc has been about giving everything up for the sake of rakugo, and here it is, how he's not going to leave anything behind him, unlike Shin who gave up on rakugo and will have [both his bloodline](http://i.imgur.com/0JCBpWQ.jpg) and *his* rakugo continue on after him. One could understand why he looks at his beloved younger brother with [this soft and rueful smile](http://i.imgur.com/fxJzmLx.jpg), that the dead will live on, while the living must die out.

Speaking of Bon, or should we say, Yakumo, we should take a look at this episode and cast our minds back for how things have gone for him this way, and in the end, this tragedy is of his own making. He saw it coming, he knew it'd come, as it kept on happening, but he let it. The single aspect of his life that most affected his behaviour and personality has been his fear of being abandoned. So what does he do when he has to take care of a 5 year old girl? He doesn't let her harbour these thoughts that she might be abandoned as well. Oh no, [he flat out tells her to do as he tells her or he'll boot her out](http://i.imgur.com/raM7hKz.jpg).

Of course, he later tells Matsuda that Konatsu has never listened to what he told her. And what does that say? It says that she's grown to know that adults' words isn't worth anything, and that's if she's lucky. And she in turn knows he can't abandon her, because he already has, emotionally. This was brought over in the scene between Yakumo and Matsuda in the cemetery, [where Bon expresses surprise](http://i.imgur.com/dnY4CMt.jpg) over Matsuda's anger, who says [it was only natural](http://i.imgur.com/Jsm10Ni.jpg), because [she's like a daughter to him](http://i.imgur.com/KlRvgom.jpg). This mirrors the scene where Bon came across Shin and Miyokichi embracing, and she beseeched him to get angry, because anger shows you care. But Bon has no anger for Konatsu, because he's never truly cared, never truly seen her as his daughter.

Bon, now Yakumo, spoke of how [he no longer remembers his true name](http://i.imgur.com/G6NdH7l.jpg). Not "old name", but "*true* name". And he keeps his litany of being alone and "[not changing](http://i.imgur.com/6gTvSqR.jpg)". But hasn't he changed? Isn't "President" another name, which is to say, another *mask* for him to adopt? The lack of change he speaks of is that he's withdrawn from the world, he's abandoned it. Now that it doesn't have the people he care for. And as he's found out in his first successful performance, if you don't let people in, then they won't take you in either. He's left looking from the outside in, because he can't accept any other life.

And yes, [of course he's changed](http://i.imgur.com/UecReQh.jpg), if only he'd let himself see that he had no other way to go about it. He became Yakumo, a name which speaks of past sins and casting out your adopted son, only to regret it later. He became Yakumo, but not for him are the shows of emotion. You change, [or the world leaves you behind](http://i.imgur.com/DoDNkL0.jpg). [You change](http://i.imgur.com/7tSmpqu.jpg), and the world [*still* leaves you behind](http://i.imgur.com/CowHP0g.jpg).

And now it's time to speak of Yotaro. We didn't see all the hard work he's put in, but we've seen it through the tale of Shin and Bon, Kikuhiko and Sukeroku. He's put in hard work, and [he's such](http://i.imgur.com/lKkNi02.jpg) [a dork](http://i.imgur.com/2kTh3n5.jpg). He's much more of a Sukeroku than Shin ever was. "Rakugo is a dialogue with the audience"? [He's literally](http://i.imgur.com/lhpmrv8.jpg) having a [discussion with them](http://i.imgur.com/CfWEUaV.jpg)! For all that Shin was an incorrigible womanizer and joker, he's had a sense of gravitas and seriousness, which Yotaro lacks. He really *did* become his namesake, a fool, free as a bird. Except for his relationships, which he seeks, and the responsibility inherent in them. Which means he's not free at all. But he's *happy* for it.

This happiness, this living life in the moment, this is what led to Sukeroku living on, and to the one who lived on and who received everything he *asked* for to lead life riddled with regrets and overflowing with loneliness, because that is the fate of becoming Yakumo. That is the fate of living on past your time.

Also, that Yotaro, after they cement him talking to the audience? [Having](http://i.imgur.com/QHnwRHN.jpg) [him](http://i.imgur.com/nIlSXgB.jpg) [talk](http://i.imgur.com/fLhhdvb.jpg) [to *us*](http://i.imgur.com/jNtaUO9.jpg)? That was a nice touch.

***

And now, some words on the show, but first, something that's mostly related to this episode and the previous one - Kobayashi Yu, the voice actress who voices Konatsu is a good voice actress. I really liked her performance in the first episode, and the latter half of this one. But she doesn't at all sound like a child. Her child-Konatsu clearly sounded like an adult making a fake sound, and it grated. More than that, child-Konatsu had some very dramatic lines to deliver, and Kobayashi having to "act the child" meant she couldn't fully act-out the drama, so almost any scene where we've had child-Konatsu fell flat as a result. Usagi Drop, Barakamon, and Mushishi have all used actual children to voice their child characters, and Rakugo Shinju should've learnt the lesson.

Ok, now about the show as a whole. Rakugo Shinju isn't a very good show, it's a *great* show. But it has a flaw that makes me not love it, [which I discussed at some length in last week's write-up](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/03/26/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-episode-12-pride-goeth-before-a-fall/): I'm not emotionally moved by the show. I can't bring myself to *care*, emotionally, about the characters. This is pretty similar to criticisms such as one could bring against Shin Sekai Yori, but the difference is that SSY works on a plot-level alone, and with its themes, and even if you don't care for any of the characters, it's still a show that "works". Rakugo Shinju is a *tragedy*, and a lot of it relies on you buying into the characters and their fates. While I can accept the show is well-told, and everything is great, I can't really care. And for this show, it's somewhat of a death-blow.

Now, I can understand it working for others, and it's similar to discussions on Madoka Magica - I don't scoff when people say they couldn't relate or care for the characters, I just nod as it has me understanding why they don't care for the show as much as I do. Now, if we discuss "Why?", it's actually somewhat interesting, from a show-criticism perspective, and to better understand our (my) interaction with the media we consume. A large part of it is the meta-narrative structure, the sheer theatricality. Quite often, and especially in last week's episode, the characters appear grander than life, as if they're reciting lines in a rakugo performance, and the back-and-forths they hold does feel straight out of one. It fits the tone of the show, but it means I don't feel as if they're "real characters", but as if I'm watching actors, so the relationship is relayed, rather than direct.

And then there is the part that a lot of symbolism and character growth moments are held instead within rakugo performances, most of them, with the exception of last week's Nozarashi, are quite symbolic and not so clear. But still, all of this adds up to the atmosphere of watching actors on stage, rather than characters, and it's harder to care for actors, or puppets, when you keep seeing them, rather than the masks they wish you to believe are real.

But, it's an exquisitely-made show, with memorable rakugo performances, beautiful shots, and which deals with many themes any creative person can relate to. In addition to having a cast of characters that even if their delivery feels less than real to me, all reflect actual issues and are fully-realized from a strict writing perspective.

Rakugo Shinju is a great show, but it's not a show I love. I'll definitely watch the next arc, and maybe now that we're done with the story of Yakumo and Sukeroku, it'd have a lot more time to dwell on the small moments of life, on the tiny moments of characterization. I really want to love this show, but until I do, this is a 9/10 show that I'm docking a point to for an emotional void. 8/10, would highly recommend to people.

([Check out my blog](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/) or [the specific page for all my write-ups on Rakugo Shinju](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-episodic-notes/) if you enjoy reading my stuff.)

>  I'm not emotionally moved by the show. I can't bring myself to care, emotionally, about the characters. 

This mirrors my feelings of the series exactly. I love it. The direction (both visual and sound), performances, the characters, the deep symbolism, and the intricate narrative are all fantastic. But I can't help but find myself emotionally distant from the work. The love I feel is a deep appreciation for the craft and the sheer brilliance the creators demonstrated throughout the work. My personal emotional investment is quite limited. I would say it peaked during Miyokichi's period of desperation, but soon passed as she grew more spiteful. Kiku was a great character, and there were many parts of him that did feel human, but I rarely felt connected to him. In any case, I don't feel this emotional gap is fatal at all for the show. I still consider it to be a phenomenal series, but it falls short of a masterpiece for me.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think he changed and the world still left him behind. He was the timeless rakugo. He changed, and was still the same. He became the secluded master, but the loneliness was no different. 

But can you even blame him? His biggest change just made him lose his biggest 2 loves. He kept rakugo alive until it could change. 

He was the last of his generation. the one last vestige of old japan. 

He changed in his attitude towards life, but not in his rakugo. Even his shinigami tells of his constant awareness of the death of rakugo, of death looming right behind him. Timeless death has a poetic beauty. 

As for the belief in characters, shit sorry you feel that way. I was emotionally torn by this, because of how real the characters are. Too often in life and those around me I've seen people act with the mask and tell their true feelings with metaphors. Them being actors  wasn't a negative. Cause I related to it. I remembered speeches people have given, that I have given. In love, at funerals, in depression. At times it feels like a drama, but this didn't feel like a play level of acting. Just a lot of... dramatic people. Who I know in real life. and am, partially. 

Idk why I went on this tangent really. I guess I wanted to present a differing view; my differing view, on the characters. 

Their very real flaws that they tried so hard to mask, the words that aimed at portraying their ideal, not their reality. 
>> ARTICLE
I think another scene worth talking about is the scene where Konatsu talks about her pregnancy to Yotaro. When Yotaro says that he'll help her raise her child, Konatsu seeths with anger. Anger not directed at Yotaro, but at herself. Bon had told her that he wouldn't care about whatever she did in the flashback, and now she's gotten herself pregnant, perhaps partly out of spite at Bon. But with Yotaro offering his help to her, she sees the situation mirroring the time when Sukeroku marries Miyokichi to help her raise her kid. This puts her in the place of her mother though, the person who she hates, and she storms out of the house in fury, fury directed at herself.

Atleast that's my take on it.

While I didn't care much for Miyokichi, I did have an emotional connection to Bon and Shin and I teared up a couple of times in the later episodes of the show. There were parts when the characters did seem rather theatrical (episode 12 comes to mind), but Bon and Shin always had great chemistry and their interactions did make them feel human, to me atleast.
>> ARTICLE
Konatsu had only known bad parents, three of them. She also doesn't know what a good marriage is like, because none of her three parents was in one. So now she'll attempt to replicate one, while knowing she isn't suited for the other.

The mirroring I noticed in that scene was that her parents used her birth to run away, while she uses it to come back. Unless her coming back is her form of running away.
>> ARTICLE
[Regarding episode 12 being theatrical HUGE SPOILER WARNING] (/n "rewatch episode 1, there are inconsistencies with Kiku's story and Konatsu memory. REALLY HUGE SPOILER if you're curious http://imgur.com/2iHc9Bf")
>> ARTICLE
I'm interpreting Konatsu's situation very differently. 

She said that she wanted a child and that she has no interest in marriage. She didn't get pregnant because she slept with a man, she slept with a man so she would become pregnant. It was her goal all along. 

Konatsu lost everything she held dear because her mother let herself be subdued by the public opinion that women are just the accessories of men. Yurie never even tried to take her life into her own hands. She relied on men to do it for her, even going as far to neglect her own child in order to find a man who can manage her life properly. And in the end it lead to nothing. All that Yurie left behind was a little girl who lost her beloved father.

Konatsu doesn't want to be like that. Especially not now, in a time where the world is starting to give women a chance.  She is not going to be some man's pet. She will live, as herself. She will proof to her mother, that her idea of womanhood was wrong. She will proof, that a woman can take care of herself. But part of being a woman is having children. Konatsu is not planning to leave that part out, as that would mean to admit that a woman can't handle her existence herself. So she made her decision: She is going to raise a child, *using* men only as far as they are necessary for it.

Her anger at the end was because of the fact that a man stepped in sacrificing himself heroicly, not even trying to hide his idea that she needs a man to support her. "Do I look like I have to rely on *you*?" She felt insulted.

Yeah, I guess that makes a lot more sense given Konatsu's character.

Week by week this anime has kept blowing me away. I think it took about 8 episodes until I could finally grasp how good this show is.

Kiku seeing and talking to Sukeroku at the cemetery was just heartbreaking. And the flashbacks showing when the two of them made the promise to save the future of rakugo together and then Sukeroku letting go, leaving Kiku alone. And then Kiku finally taking the title Yakumo (in honor of Suke?). 
Also, the ending with Yotaro asking to have the name Sukeroku, oh the chills! and that expression on Kikus face. Wow. So glad this is getting a second season. Looking forward to it! 
>> ARTICLE
Can't believe Konatsu got knocked up by some random side character. I'm dying to know why Konatsu was upset at Yotaro offering to be the father and why she's hiding who it could be. Maybe a drunk Yotaro impregnated her during his futatsume period? Or could it be she's upset because she wanted him to be the actual father (the most appropriate choice for a child of Sukeroku blood) all along and now it's too late?

Can't wait to find out.

Damn Kiku-san, you aged like fine wine, you could pass as a staff in Ristorante Paradiso!

No wonder Miyo wanted the D so bad.

This episode ended halfway through Volume 5, at page 104 (no idea what chapter since she labels her chapters weird). It DID skip some stuff, for the first time in the entire adaption so far, but it did so because [Rakugo manga very slight spoilers](/s "it was introducing characters that are important from here on out."). 

Now that the second season is confirmed, it should complete the 10 volume story. I'm ecstatic. Full adaptations of this quality are rare. Looking forward to it! This show was a treat. 

[Here's that final scene from the manga](https://i.imgur.com/41by8Tm.jpg). Love Sukeroku's face.

I was very skeptical about its chances to the point where I had conceded the idea of it getting a follow-up season but here we are and I am over the moon about it.

Damn, this series gets a 10/10!  This series was just...beautiful to the end.  

Konatsu really takes after her mother.  I thought it was Miyokichi for a minute.

The scene with Kiku talking to Sukeroku's spirit was very touching.  Even more touching was when Yotaro requested to inherit the Sukeroku name.

Can't wait for season 2!

I'm so glad I caught up on this show. I originally didn't care much for the first episode and put it on hold for weeks, but now I'd say it's probably the best show I've watched since Euphonium - and I think this one ended up being the better of the two.


10/10! So happy that there will be a second season!
>> ARTICLE
What a beautiful and stunning anime, bravo DEEN!! They always get such a bad rap but I'm always strongly reminded that they do amazing work when they really give it their all. Not only was Rakugo and KonoSuba amazing this season but they also did one of my favorite anime ever second only to Princess Mononoke, [Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/44/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_-_Tsuiokuhen) If you're looking for a beautifully animated short OVA series that also has strong themes and extremely heartfelt moments, I CANNOT recommend it enough.

SWISS FUCKING CHEESE I'm so happy! It's not over yet! I'm so excited. Specially because we are now gonna switch focus to Konatsu and Yotaro.

This show is certainly **AOTS**(definitely better than Erased). Loved the show all the way through and is definitely one of the more original shows I have seen. Glad that there is a second season and hope they have already started to produce it.

Ahhhhh! So it finally ended 

[well, at least the first season](#anko)

This has probably been one of the most enjoyable anime I've seen in a couple of years and each episode just seemed to be better than the last one. 

Ahhhh, I don't really know what to say other than that I really really love this anime. (not that I didn't expect to love it since I basically love anything that has the "historical" tag in it )

The part where Yakumo was at the grave and saw Sukeroku made me cry, holy shit I didn't think I'd cry since I've read the manga and all but ahhh... Also I love Yotaro~

He's such a sweet dude 

[](#ilovethiskindofshit)

Well, I don't really have much else to say other than;

PLEASE HELP ME GOD!! THERE'S GOING TO BE A SECOND SEASON!!! DEEN IS SAVING ANIME!!! I'M DYING!!! CAN'T WAIT!!!

And there it is, the ending to my personal AOTS.

Truly, one of the most beautiful and touching stories I've had the pleasure of watching, and that was only Act 1. When Yotaro said "Let me inherit the Sukeroku name" I got chills. I love it.

Showa Genroku was the embodiment of an era, an art form, and the struggles of characters. Im glad I got to add another 10 to my list
>> ARTICLE
This was a pretty interesting last episode. It went very differently from how I thought it would, and to be honest I'm a bit disappointed based on my own expectations.

I thought the transition back to the current timeline was really strange. When we last left that timeline, Kiku (Yurakutei Yakumo) was telling Yotaro and Konatsu the story of his life. I thought, for sure, when we came back to the modern timeline we'd see him ending his story speaking with them, and that Konatsu and Yotaro's outlook on Kiku would be forever changed, now that he finally let them in.

Instead we zoom years past that moment, to when Yotaro is becoming a shin'uchi, Kiku is a much older man, and Konatsu is preggers with somebody's kid. They don't even address that Kiku supposedly told them this incredible story. Either that, or both of them just didn't care at all. Konatsu doesn't seem to have a different outlook on life whatsoever, and Yotaro ends the show by saying that he wants to inherit Sukeroku's name, not Yakumo's. You would think that by hearing Kiku's story Konatsu and Yotaro would have gained some respect for him...apparently not.

Then there's the fact that the finale didn't address the huge elephant in the room. The whole, was Kiku in love with Sukeroku issue is now completely left open to interpretation, whereas it could've just been a straightforward answer. I guess it gives people something to argue about while they wait for season 2. They even brought an apparition of Sukeroku on-screen, which seemed like a perfect opportunity to shed some light on that issue, but Kiku still seems more concerned about what has become of Konatsu, and whether or not he has carried on the legacy of rakugo in a way that pleases Sukeroku. All this, I feel, would lend more evidence to the idea that there was nothing beyond a brotherly bond between Kiku and Sukeroku, but I can still see the argument from both sides.

All-in-all, I'm excited that a second season has been announced, because that means we get more Konatsu.

You don't ask for Yakumo's name when Yakumo has not announced his retirement. It would be too rude in this culture, and Yota is not such a rude person. 

Sukeroku wanted Yakumo's name because he wanted "Sukeroku" (not himself, but 1st) to become Yakumo. If Yotaro inherits Sukeroku and be 3rd Sukeroku, and then be 9th Yakumo later, it means 2nd Sukeroku(Shin)'s dream (of making Sukeroku be Yakumo) can come true. 

I think Yota cared a lot about the story and decided to ask for Sukeroku name as shin'uchi - imo, that's what he thought the best or what he should do now, just like how he thought asking Konatsu to marry him was the best thing he could do. 
>> ARTICLE
Agreed. If Combo33 had paid attention to the last part of the 1st episode, Yakumo basically had Yotaro promise to become the next Sukeroku and "fill the hole in his heart."
>> ARTICLE
The whole season, I was looking forwards to their reaction whenever the flashback story was finished. It was quite jarring to have that cut back to Yotaro, who I didn't even recognize for a solid minute or two.  

Hopefully the continuation will weave that back into the story, somehow. (I'm just hoping that Kiku's not the father, doesn't seem likely, but thanks to a certain animes [manga](/s "Usagi Drop") I don't rule those things out anymore!)
>> ARTICLE
I have to say, that possibility did run through my head as well.

We do not talk about that. There is only the anime.

Good grief, the only other time in my life where I regret checking the source material after the anime.

I completely don't agree. It's basically more than established that Kiku did love Sukeroku. 

The question you are asking is 'how strong, if any, was sexual component of his love'. Personally I'm not sure if this even matters. The show was definitely not framing this as any kind of 'main problem'.
>> ARTICLE
I don't want to wait till season 2 :( Definitely the one show I didn't expect to be a favourite of mine this season!
>> ARTICLE
Masterful, now when is S2 airing?
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully in the summer or fall seasons.
>> ARTICLE
If season 2 wasn't already confirmed, I'd be slightly annoyed at that ending.
>> ARTICLE
Worth picking up if I didn't care too much for the first episode? I lost interest around the rakugo part, which I figured would be problematic given it's the focus of the story.

>> ARTICLE
I would argue that the characters and their relationships are the true focus of the series, but the rakugo is still important and it features in most of the episodes. (That said, none of the rakugo performances are as long as in the first episode, and most of them aren't even shown in full.)

It's a story about performance, both on the stage and in life, and the rakugo stories told by the characters reflect upon or act as metaphors for the off-stage development of the characters. So even if you aren't entertained by the rakugo on a basic level, it still holds a ton of allegorical value and forms the bones of the story. But the *meat* of the story is the character drama.

If you're interested now that it's been getting all this acclaim, you might pick it up again. Give it a few episodes to see if it sticks with you.
>> ARTICLE
YES S2 CONFIRMED! THANK YOU BASED DEEN!

What a fantastic first season though. I can't wait for more!

I was wondering when Kikuhiko was talking to Sukeroku, did he just imply he did it with Konatsu or was I just reading it too much? Or just that he didn't take care of her well enough?
>> ARTICLE
> when Kikuhiko was talking to Sukeroku

Which scene? 

If you mean in front of the tombstone, then he's talking to the Sukeroku ghost that's been haunting him, and that Yota appears after the fog clears out, I think, symbolizes that Yota is the key man to clear his mind cloud and save him from his hell in season 2.
>> ARTICLE
He said something like " do you hate me for what i did to your daughter"  when he was talking to him. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that was in front of the 7th Yakumo's tombstone. I think he was feeling blamed by ghost Sukeroku for how he didn't treat Konatsu as Sukeroku would have. 
>> ARTICLE
Man, I literally smiled in delight seeing the change in the ED credits, reflecting the present cast. I really like how youthful, happy and optimistic Yotaro looked in contrast to KikuYakumo's weathered, snarky and tired smile.
>> ARTICLE
Fantastic show, and I'll have to definitely check out the manga.

I'm so happy a josei title has been given so much attention, and done well enough to grant a second season.

Also, the second season might gear up for another time ship (this time into their future)?

I'm surprised. Studio DEEN made everyone hyped. What's happening.

It's a really good show.

And second season was announce. Fucking great!
>> ARTICLE
The ending made me think about regret a lot. The thought of growing old with a very large regret seems like a heavy burden to bare.

Kiku watched the decline of Rakugo which he probably feels he did nothing to stop. Something that Sukeroku may have been able to do. 
>> ARTICLE
So the flashback is over? So happy season 2 is happening since we can see more of this future/present stuff again. Was a bit shocking to go back to though! Kiku's gotten so old but Konatsu is so fiery, I love it.

Kinda wish they didn't show so much in the first ep and thrust us into the past with less knowledge. Fun season though with some very interesting characters, looking forward to season 2!
>> ARTICLE
Even though we haven't seen much of her, Konatsu is definitely my favorite character in this show.  My two favorite characters!
>> ARTICLE
Wait so season 2 has been confirmed? DEEN you're amazing!
>> ARTICLE
Yup they've been great this season!
>> ARTICLE
quite the contrary, I loved that the first ep was all in the present only for the rest of the story to lead back up to it. it added so much more weight knowing the outcome and the interactions that the present day characters had.

gave you a great sense of perspective! agreed though im looking forward to next season!
>> ARTICLE
> it added so much more weight knowing the outcome and the interactions that the present day characters had.

I felt like knowing that Miyokichi and Sukeroku would die took a lot of the suspense and grief I would have felt if I hadn't known. What did it add for you?
>> ARTICLE
ahh, even without the suspense i still felt the grief because seeing the characters develop, seeing their troubles and their tragic past, and knowing they wouldnt be able to fix it hurt me like no other!!


there is a lot that it added for me! A couple of things was having yakumo react so strongly to yotaro's similarity with sukeroku, konatsu seeing yotaro perform rakugo in a style reminiscent of her father, yakumo performing at his peak having found his style of rakugo. All of these instances added a little something to look forward to, seeing the characters develop to where they will eventually be at.

The whole back story of Konatsu and her relationship with Kiku for example. I feel like the flashback added a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Personally, I'm not feeling the AOTS hype (then again, it was certainly better overall than the only other anime I finished this season, which was Erased), and I think this is due for a rewatch from me. I feel like I ended up forgetting or glossing over a lot of the character development that occurred throughout the series with each episode - for example, I feel like I was supposed to feel something about the whole Miyokichi deal, and I just... didn't. Sukeroku should probably have had more moments with Miyokichi, at the very least. And I really was not fond of Sukeroku. Being drunk half the time is cancerous, both literally and metaphorically. 

That being said, I don't really feel like this season was a complete waste of my time, either, thanks to Yotaro and Konatsu. Totally hyped for S2. And really, we all need more josei in our lives.
>> ARTICLE
> Is that end enough for you?     

Oh fuck yeah it is, especially since we know there is gonna be a 2nd season!      

edit: needless to say but I agree with the people in this thread, this is my AOTS for sure
>> ARTICLE
Can anyone who reads the manga PM me the identity of the father to Konatsu's child? I need to know!
>> ARTICLE
This episode ended about 1/4 of the way through Volume 5. If I had to guess they're gonna wrap up about halfway through Volume 5. The manga is ending with the 10th volume, so if by some miracle this receives a second season, it has exactly enough material to do so. PLEASE GET A SECOND SEASON. You can probably guess by the preview that the story [spoilers](/s "goes back to the present").

I've been picking at the manga (it's so difficult) and I'm stunned at how faithful it is. Almost every line of dialogue is kept intact. In this episode I think the only thing that was different was just that Sukeroku story was shorted to fit it in the episode.

[Here's that fateful scene, in manga version.](https://i.imgur.com/1ErNol2.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
I'm happy, but also sad.

I hated the show's first episode. I didn't like the stuff happening in present day, I didn't care about any of it.

All through this show I was thinking "just hang in there a little longer, I want more story about these 2 brothers in the past". About episode 7 it became apparant I was not at risk, and the show will indeed be what I want to see.

Now you're telling me this is only half the story!? and the other half is exactly what I disliked about ep 1?

I'm so conflicted, maybe because I'm invested in kiku, I'll enjoy the present day stuff. But I assumed I'd only endure such a story for 20 minutes, not 200!
>> ARTICLE
Don't worry, the present story might have Yotarou as the protagonist, but a large part of it still revolves around the 8th. He is the central character of the entire tale after all.
>> ARTICLE
we can only hope but it's been a miracle that this got animated in the first place :(

I'm extremely grateful for DEEN for picking this up regardless of the fact that they knew it wouldn't sell well at all.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll let KonoSuba carry the show.  Lord knows *that* show did well for itself(and deservedly so).
>> ARTICLE
This is perhaps the only time I had wholeheartedly approved of what DEEN was doing and would gladly throw money at them.  
>> ARTICLE
I know the feel. This is basically the first time I truly want more of a DEEN adaptation. I would pay for it to happen.
>> ARTICLE
Well shit, now I really want a second to happen, the chances are low but we can still hope.
>> ARTICLE
Why are the chances low?
>> ARTICLE
It's too niche of a story and it's reflected by it's sales which are undeservedly low. 
>> ARTICLE
>It's too niche of a story 

What does that mean?

>> ARTICLE
It means the target market is too small, since its not the mass moemoe type that is more widespread.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know, Deen is usually pretty good with completing their adaptations. I mean, Maria-sama ga Miteru got like 4 seasons, Higurashi got 2 seasons and a bunch of OVAs, Ranma 1/2 and Maison Ikkoku got huge episode counts, etc. They're not the type to leave things after the first cour.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't that depend on the publisher?
>> ARTICLE
Probably, I guess it's more correlation than causation when you think about it.
>> ARTICLE
I pray that you're right. Crossing my fingers for an announcement next week.
>> ARTICLE
I love how the production team prioritizes the story itself instead of putting OP and/or ED as a fixed rule even when I love both of them - I could always listen to them later on my own anyways. But I don't remember this happening in other shows as often as this. IMO, it shows they care so much about giving us what they have the way they want it to be as much as possible in the limited amount of time with each episode. There probably would be more that they want to give us if they didn't have the limitations, and that makes me wonder if having the current fixed cour system is doing any good than harm to the anime industry. 

Now, enough with my rant. I love and enjoy reading all your comments here every week, and I know I'm gonna miss this so badly after the grand finale next week is over.  

-----

Today, I would like to share the skipped rakugo story that Kiku played in this episode, called "Akegarasu/Raven's Matin". (I hope you all understood "Shibahama" well. Great VA work, Yamadera!)  

This story is about an earnest young man, Tokijirou, who was far from frivolous thus still a virgin, and never cared about women. His father, a very rich man, was worried about him and asked two friends of his to take him to Yoshiwara(geisha place), and Tokijirou actually gets stuck with a geisha in the end. 

At first, Tokijirou insisted he didn't want to go, so two men tricked him to take him out and managed to get him sleep with a gorgeous geisha, Urazato.   
They lied to him saying that this big gate to Yoshiwara (this is the only one gate there to prevent geisha or customers from running away) is a gate to the Inari shrine, and when he realized that he was tricked into a geisha house, he was lied that he would be stopped at the gate and couldn't leave even if he tried to go home alone, since three passed the gate together, they could only leave together as three. (lie)   
In the morning, Tokijirou and Urazato were both so carried away deeply in love with each other and wouldn't leave, so the two told him that they were going home without him. Tokijiro, like a revenge, told them how they wouldn't be able to pass the big gate without him now (and he isn't leaving). 

This rakugo story is from an old tragic [Joururi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Druri_(music\) ) song, "Akegarasu Yume no Awayuki/Raven's Matin, Spring Snow Dream(my translation)", based on a (supposedly) true story of Tokijirou and Urazato's double suicide in Edo era. 

There are a few things you can check from this story.   
1) Shinjuu topic, again.   
2) Most men love women, according to the saying (intro of the rakugo appeared in the show, no offense to anyone), and Kiku is no exception.   
3) A man(Kiku) who wasn't too interested in women meeting a gorgeous geisha(Miyo) by his father's will(7th Yakumo), ends up falling in love with her.  
4) This love has no way out and is about to destroy their lives. (Kiku loving her back now means he has to betray Sukeroku, not loving her back means he betrays both himself and Miyo.)  
5) "Going back home together as three" was Kiku's original plan (well, actually 4 with Konatsu), but he came here alone in the first place, so he is supposed to leave alone (actually with Konatsu).  

I don't know whether I should be convinced that it's supposed to be an irony that Kiku chose this story here, or it's just the author giving us the message for the show. (Or I'm reading too much.)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the extra info on this rakugo story
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for posting the skipped story. This ~~brings more tears to my eyes ;_;~~ adds a whole lot more depth to an already packed episode. Great takeaway points.
>> ARTICLE
The ending to this story is made so much more emotional and meaningful because of how well developed the characters are. I can't remember the last time I saw a scene with three more fleshed out, believable characters. 
>> ARTICLE
I agree, though I wish the circumstances of their deaths were more connected with their personal history.
>> ARTICLE
Interesting. I think I agree, though there is something to be said of them being so doomed by *fate itself* that they died in the freak balcony incident. Do you mean a more traditional 'lovers' suicide'?
>> ARTICLE
> The ending to this story is made so much more emotional and meaningful because of how well developed the characters are

Yup. This is a perfect example where you feel attached to the characters themselves and care for them, not just feeling sad because of the events that transpired.
>> ARTICLE
I knew it was going to happen, but goddamn it...

On a completely different note, Kiku has some strong hands, man. Held to people by a piece of cloth, then by his fingers.

[Back to the past](http://i.4cdn.org/a/1458954759144.webm)
>> ARTICLE
I'm really mad they put that part in because the rest of this whole scene was so tense and emotional but that one bit made me fucking burst out in laughter.
>> ARTICLE
So I just have to say the ending was really good, but I got pulled out of the moment a bit before when Kiku licked her tears. To me, that was just weird. They pulled me back in when Sukeroku appeared. I feel pretty bad for Kiku. He's lost his master and now two more important people. I think the only person that is important to him, before he came to the countryside, is the older man that helped his master. Next episode, Yotarou comes back! 
>> ARTICLE
I agree the licking threw me off a bit.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's supposed to be weird. However, licking one's tears is not an uncommon theme in romantic literature, either here or there. It's heavy on the symbolism of licking one's wounds. Much more normally you'd see something along the lines of kissing one's tears, but this is Rakugo, and Kiku no less, there needs to be a charged eroticism to it too. I think it also felt weird because it also felt a little forced too, like Kiku was going through the motions and saying whatever needed to be said in order to rebuild the gang and reclaim his happiness. But yeah, powerful scene IMO.
>> ARTICLE
I guess it also felt a bit off because we never see Kiku be spontaneous and so openly romantic the way he did this episode. Out of context, it feels like some crazy romantic gesture in a shoujo/josei manga, but it does make sense that Kiku had this in him all along. But he was able to express it because Miyokichi opened up to him.
>> ARTICLE
It made sense to me when I was watching the scene because in my mind, Kiku probably had a lot of pent-up "desires" he never got to pursue. The fact that he was never so spontaneous or romantic kind of made it more believable in my eyes. So when the opportunity presented itself again...
>> ARTICLE
I like your explanation! I looked at it as Kiku trying to take some of Miyokichi's pain. It was both quite unsettling and erotic at the same time~

Wow, the conclusion to the relationship between Miyo, Kiku, and Sukeroku is just incredible. A few episodes ago, we were all thinking that being Miyo was suffering. Well, today we saw the truth: being Kiku is suffering.

Shibahama was truly amazing, and all the time I was thinking "wow, this could apply to Sukeroku in a way". And then he tells 
Miyo he'll leave Rakugo for her, and that whole scene just hit me. It was a very amazing detail that Shibahama was the last story Sukeroku told.

This show is so, so good. For once I have a clear AOTS. There are some very, very good shows airing this season, but this one definitely takes the cake.

>> ARTICLE
This is my favorite show this season, it started off pretty interesting and steadily got better with every single episode.

I mean, its rather insane, but it started off good and got better, that is so rare these days.

Anyway yeah, the show is definitely my favorite this season (I guess followed by Erased), can't wait for the season closure next week.
>> ARTICLE
Erased started out strong, but it's like the writer wrote themselves into a corner and couldn't find a great way out. It didn't stick the landing and relied on a lot of cheap suspense throughout. This show blows Erased out of the water, IMO. We all knew this was coming, and that made the suspense far more intense and meaningful.
>> ARTICLE
I disagree.

I felt episodes 1-11 were all top notch, extremely interesting and thrilling.

Episode 12 was ok, it was fairly anti climactic but it definitely didn't ruin the show, it simply didn't improve it in any way.

I always got the feeling that people who watch Erased did so for the murder mystery, which is weird. It was VERY obvious who the killer was since the first episode (not gonna go into spoilers here) but I mean, it was SUPER obvious.

I never got the feeling we're watching a mystery here, lots of people did though and got disappointing at the obvious reveal.

You say the writer wrote himself into a corner.... how exactly did he do that? what specifically was your issue here?
>> ARTICLE
It was more thriller than mystery.  Not sure why people are so hung up on that.
>> ARTICLE
I know, that's exactly what I find so weird. People just decided its a mystery show when there was actually very very little mystery, then they were all let down by the lack of a big reveal.

Its just weird, and its rather sad to see the show ratings and opinions go down because people decided its something its not.
>> ARTICLE
> People just decided its a mystery show

It's the director's presentation though. It's the director who wanted the audience to play this killer-quest if anything, not the audience, nor the original author. He purposely added this "red eye" thing in the show from the very beginning to each *suspect* of his choice, even hid their eyes in OP as if we were supposed to look for the real killer, and took away the black blindfolds on the 2nd last episode's OP. So, at least it was the director's intention no matter how it worked. 

I still enjoyed that show and I'm enjoying this show too, and I don't enjoy comparing the two completely different shows. That said, I'm glad that the director and staff of rakugo-shinjuu appears to have a really good understanding of this story and do not mislead us, so far. 
>> ARTICLE
There's a big difference between the director adding an element of mystery, to people to decide this is all the show focuses about.

It was clear from the get go that the focus wasn't about finding who the killer was, but rather about saving the people the killer killed \ ruined.


>> ARTICLE
While the last few episodes of Erased did have a drop in quality, I felt it was kind of mixed from the start - some parts of it were great, but I thought a lot of it was very average - watchable for sure, but I couldn't understand why it got so much hype.

This show on the other hand feels like something special. Seems unlikely (I hear it's doing badly) but I hope it gets a second season without a quality drop.
>> ARTICLE
I think the cinematography in it was close to perfect. It made it so enjoyable to watch that I let slide a few of the problems. The show got a ton of hype because it's the perfect show for someone like me, who isnt a critical watcher. I just watch, get the enjoyment out of it, and dont really think much more about it. I dont try to analyse it to see the flaws or whatever, I just let the story happen, if that makes any sense. Considering that, I gave Erased a 9/10 on my personal list (based on enjoyment alone). For reference, the last episode of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu would have to be absolutely horrible for me to rate this any less than 10.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the direction was good - definetely elevated it from the source material manga which had pretty terrible art.

>I just watch, get the enjoyment out of it, and dont really think much more about it. I dont try to analyse it to see the flaws or whatever, I just let the story happen, if that makes any sense. 

I'm actually completely the same way; Erased just never did that much for me. I don't think it was bad (save for a few qualms) by any means but it never really resonated with me I suppose. I've seen anime I'd consider "worse" than it that I've gotten more enjoyment out of, if that makes sense.

Edit: Thinking about it, I think my problem with it is that i never found any of the characters particularly interesting or likeable. Satoru especially I found surprisingly bland, especially considering how rare it is to have an mc who's not a teenager. It also could have been interesting to see a grown man pretend to be a child, but they never really went anywhere with that.
>> ARTICLE
Erased had effective cliffhangers. Thrillers generate excitement which generates hype. 
>> ARTICLE
This show had the best first episode of the season without a doubt. Then after that, I felt like the next two or three episodes were comparatively really bad. The early years of the flashback were kinda boring and uneventful, and I really just wished we could get back to Yotaro and Konatsu because I had fallen in love with them so much already. Once Miyokichi entered the scene though, and the character arcs became more interesting and complex than "Kiku doesn't really think he likes rakugo," it shot right back up to the top.
>> ARTICLE
I kinda agree. After the first episode I was damn certain we'll only get a small flashback and then pop back to the "real" deal with Yotaro, was quite surprised the flashback simply didn't end and in the end found out that its the actual core of the show.

I really did miss Yotaro and older Konatsu as well, but I had no issues with the flashback surprisingly as it simply gripped me.

God I really like this show, this season had very few great shows, thankfully this one kinda saved it for me.

>> ARTICLE
Finally the moment we have all been waiting for... with all the build up to this moment, it had to be spot on and i think it pulled it off amazingly.

This episode was perfect for me as we got to see the final chemistry between the characters and finally see Kiku show his real emotions. In the end all the characters got their redemption and also got to expose their true feelings, but in a way that was so natural and believable without being over dramatic.

For me the best part was that all the characters apologized. Kiku apologized because he felt guilty for putting Miyo in this situation, Sukeroku apologized for not loving her back and Miyo also apologized while holding onto Sukeroku. This for me, gave them all a clean slate and is the reason why there are no sides to pick when trying to place blame. This therefore removes the aspects of anger and just leaves you with sadness which is what the scene was trying to deliver.

P.S Sukeroku's rakugo was amazing 



>> ARTICLE
So... why didn't they just swing to the balcony that was right next to them?? WTF

All joking aside though, this was amazing. Incredible even. I don't have a lot to say about this, but this ride has been a life experience. I spent the entire episode in a state of dread, and when things finally went down I was stiffing tears. Best anime I've seen in years. And it's not even over! I'm glad we're going to get an epilogue to come back to.

On a side note, there's enough comics for another season's worth. I'm not particularly sure I want that though? It would be nice if someone started scanlating it however.  There's 9 volumes released already, and it's supposed to end on the 10th.

Edit: Nevermind, I read some spoilers, I NEED a second cour really bad now.

The Kanji used, the sheer amount, and different Edo and Meiji dialects. That's like asking why is Great Expectations harder to translate than Goosebumps.

Personally, the rakugo stories are difficult without prior knowledge of the specific story. Lot's of archaic words and difficult kanji, as well as adult-focused writing, being a josei. YMMV.
>> ARTICLE
oh yeah, the almost-dead slang trap
>> ARTICLE
99% of manga/LN that are translated are lighter, younger series with a simpler vocabulary and writing style (for the bigger part of the story at least), this one probably uses A LOT of old kanji and really really fancy and difficult expressions, being a more 'mature' series that deals with a very old traditional japanese subject matter like rakugo. I imagine translating the rakugo performances must be a ton of work.
>> ARTICLE
Huh, so does this mean that there are libraries and libraries full of manga that will always be inaccessible to us because the kanji and idioms are too hard for amateur translators to work through?
>> ARTICLE
Well, not exactly, I mean, most manga by definition tend to be easy to translate, it's just the more mature ones (a very, very small part of the whole) that are troublesome.

Now when we talk about books, that's one thing we will simply have to miss out on.

That only happens in videogames. The momentum required to actually thrust two people to the adjacent balcony would only make the one they're on collapse.

I really wanted the trio to come to grips with their friendships, but a balcony cracking and having Miyokichi fall is just... Wow.

This comment has been removed.

Due to a recent rule revision [(seen here)](https://redd.it/4781vp) all spoilers must include the title of the source being spoiled in the description of the spoiler tag.

When spoiling something from a non-anime source the red /n spoiler tag must be used in place of the standard /s spoiler tag. Example: \[KonoSuba LN 5](/n "is an LN"), which appears as [KonoSuba LN 5](/n "is an LN")

Please edit your comment as such (and reply to this) and it will be reapproved.

You have not received an infraction.

According to the reports you're spoiling something pretty big for no good reason, but yeah.

I still would place the death in the suicide category but i don't think it's as clear cut as that. The situation did arise because of Miyo pushing both of them towards the edge and Sukeroku did force Kiku to let go.

My explanation is that the situation for Sukeroku wasn't to commit suicide, but to save Kiku, which is the reason why he chose to let go.

>> ARTICLE
Well Miyokichi clearly wanted suicide. At least at first.
>> ARTICLE
> did it have to be from a crumbling balcony?

I think its the story's way of saying Sukeroku and Miyo quite literally died from the weight their personal burdens and Kiki's choices. And those circumstances being what they are brought them to that balcony.
>> ARTICLE
> Oh dear god. I never realized both Kiku and Hatsu loved Miyokichi

I'm surprised you missed that. I thought it was pretty obvious.
>> ARTICLE
I thought Kiku pretty much gave up hope on Miyo a while ago. While Hatsu seemed like he had interest, not to a point where he'd throw his life away for her.
>> ARTICLE
Well he thought by pushing her away he would improve his rakugo. That's why he said it was the biggest lie he had told. By the end thou he realized pushing the ones he loved away to improve on his art was to difficult. Also Hatsu had a kid with her so it's not inconceivable. 
>> ARTICLE
> Also Hatsu *had a kid with her* so it's not *inconceivable*

I see what you did there
>> ARTICLE
I have a feeling that Miyokichi was planning to fall off the balcony already, and had planned in some sense to commit a double suicide with Kiku by doing so. I mean, the last things she said to him were, "You don't even know my real name," "I will have my vengeance," and "The next time we meet will be in hell," so I can't fully believe she'd want to return to any semblance of a normal relationship with Kiku, in Tokyo or otherwise. I think she's a stronger character than to end up running back into Kiku's arms, even after the years it's been; her endgame was dying, with him or by his hand.

It's that karmic revenge thing again--Kiku's punishment for what happened to Miyo and Sukeroku is to literally have to let them fall to their deaths. All I can say about the balcony itself was it's fitting for the story that they die from a fall. After all, rakugo () carries the literal meaning of "falling words", and various rakugo terms incorporate that  kanji in the sense of falling... maybe that's a little too direct, but anyway. It was tragic, but it made sense to me, and I was even a little relieved at how accidental it ended up being. I'd thought since early on that Miyo was going to execute some kind of forced double suicide with Sukeroku.
>> ARTICLE
Very well put and insightful, it's a shame there's only one more left.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I suppose it might have taken off some of the mystery of the scene if we see her rummaging about, setting up the balcony or something. It's not a Detective Conan deduction scene after all. Whether she planned it or not, maybe she was at least subconsciously trying to up the stakes by going that high in the building to confess to Kiku.

I just find it's a shame Miyo was so strung apart by the various relationships she had. Maybe Kiku was right about wanting to stay far away in order to save their friendships. While Hatsu might have inadvertently endangered them all by clinging to old friendships. 


>> ARTICLE
Things I particularly liked about this episode:

* Shibahama. It was obvious by the end of the performance that Sukeroku (real name Hatsuda, I just remembered) was speaking to Miyokichi through his craft. The craft he loves, but that he was willing to sacrifice for their future.

* That Kikuhiko finally "let go" emotionally. It was nice to see his real feelings for Miyokichi out in the open. It felt like the tragic love triangle finally manifested. And, as always, the triangle ends badly.

* The fact that we get Miyokichi's real name at the climactic moment. Names have held a special weight in this show. What is Kikuhiko's real name? I hope we learn it.

* That falling scene. Absolutely beautiful. Did the setup feel a bit over-the-top? Yes, but I believe it was intentional. The dramatic strings preceding it give the scene an operatic feeling, which is fitting for the grand climax of the show. It's hard to explain. Less opera and more a vibe of [traditional Japanese art](http://cdnlava360.saturn.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/traditionaljapanese_painting21.jpg), which can be quite dramatic and erotic.
>> ARTICLE
> real name Hatsuda

Hatsutarou or Hatsuta is the name 7th Yakumo gave him. Kiku calls him Shin-san, so probably Shin is his real name.
>> ARTICLE
Oh right! I forgot that 1) Kikuhiko calls him Shin and 2) back in episode 2, he got assigned the name Hatsutarou by their master. I wonder why we haven't learned Kikuhiko's real name yet.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't his real name Bon?
>> ARTICLE
No. I explained above. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Kiku's real name is Bon. I'm speaking from my experience with Sakamichi no Apollon, in which one of the main characters gets nicknamed "Bon" for having the image of a prim, spoiled young master. It's very similar to the image of young Kiku, so I got the sense that Sukeroku used Bpn in a teasing way.
>> ARTICLE
It may be because Kikuhiko is the narrator of the story in these flashbacks, and I can't see him having any intention of telling his real name. 
>> ARTICLE
Unless it's a title/nickname (like Botchan) that I'm unaware of, Shin and Yakumo were calling him by his given name Bon since day 1.
>> ARTICLE
Bon is from , it's not a name. Like you said, it's the same as Botchan, it's how you address a (rich) kid. 
>> ARTICLE
The tragic ending of Miyo and Sukeroku gives the anime a really Rakugo like narrative. Though consider how a lot of Rakugo stories like dark humor and have erotic tones if this anime were to be a Rakugo the main character would definitely be Miyo.  

Looking forward to going back to the present.

Being Miyo ~~is~~ was suffering ;_;.

I think that had two purposes, she hated seeing Shin' Rakugo, but she was also running away from seeing Konatsu, which is pretty tragic.

When you put it that way.. I can interpret a lot of things differently. Not only is she running from Kontasu but also from Suke. At first, I just thought she didnt care about seeing Suke but by the end I don't think that was the case.. It helps me view differently and make a little more sense of the talking between Suke and Miyo before she falls. Thanks for pointing that out.

Holy fuck, that performance. Without a doubt my favorite of the season. That moment when Sukeroku refused the sake. Chills. Just keep on cementing yourself as one of the greats, *Rakugo*. Myself and many others will just keep enjoying the ride.
>> ARTICLE
Hilariously, the storyteller himself wastes no time getting plastered afterwards.
>> ARTICLE
What are your interpretations for why Miyo wanted to commit suicide with Kiku? Was it because she actually wanted revenge, or was it because she knew Kiku and her couldn't have a life together since she already had a family with Sukeroku? (which she didn't want). Or maybe she was just messing with him?

I'm also surprised that Kiku really let go and got affectionate with Miyo. My surprise doesn't come from the fact that we haven't seen that from him before, but because I **never thought he would betray Sukeroku like that.** I also can't see him letting go in the moment. But maybe the build up of it all...Or maybe he's tempting Miyo. So many different ways to see it.

And I feel so bad for Kiku. He said everything was all his fault, but I don't think that's true at all. Yes, he may have  hurt Miyo, but Miyo and Sukeroku are still responsbile for their actions and behavior. It's not like Kiku's relationship with Miyo was very deep or truly serious either- at least from what we have been shown.
>> ARTICLE
> What are your interpretations for why Miyo wanted to commit suicide with Kiku?

Maybe this is unique to Japanese but people who attempt shinjuu often say "become happy together in the next life". It's crazy but typical and you see this a lot in traditional Japanese literature. I believe Miyo also had this in mind, to achieve their love in the next life/after death, instead of trying to do something in this life. This mindset is almost the same as "running away to the countryside", death is not as fearful as you think it is for her. 

Quite often, there are some even crazier people who forces this to his/her partner, which did happen a lot in Showa era, and it's called "muri-shinjuu()/forced double suicide". (The worst case is when a mother or father or both include their children together to kill the whole family which is called "ikka-shinjuu()/family suicide" which actually happened quite often in Showa.)

Anime of the Season

I hope we get a season 2.
this was just so sad to watch.
>> ARTICLE
Man I can't believe this episode I am crying like a baby. Just when things are looking up. 
>> ARTICLE
Yet another great episode. How come we get anime like this which are consistently excellent at everything and others which are really inconsistent. I would say this is the best anime of all time. Maybe not my favourite but I have great respect for a show that is genuinely a 10/10. It's perfect.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is definitely AotS for me, while others fall short but Shouwa Genroku managed to keep its consistency each week.

I was already moved by Sukeroku's Shibahama, but the final scene is literally a nail in the coffin for my tears to burst out. What a great but dramatic/tragic closure for their tri-relationship.

This show just blew me away.
>> ARTICLE
This whole story has been pretty special...It had probably not been since Kids on the Slope that something impressed me this much. 
>> ARTICLE
Fuck that woman, why couldn't she just commit suicide alone if she wanted to die so badly. She actually tried to murder Kiku too, before Sukeroku interrupted.

Also, there was a balcony thingy a floor or two below them, couldn't he have swing a bit to try to land on it?

I thought I was ready for the feels trip but I really wasn't.

That ending... They were just beginning to work everything out, then that happened... I know it was inevitable, but it still hurts like hell >->

Just go back and watch the OP in another episode.

And while you're at it, rewatch that episode.

Oops. I usually don't watch airing anime for some reason, but I started watching Rakugo yesterday, which is the title I was anticipating the most before the season started, thinking today was the finale.

I'm a fan of the few performance anime I've watched because I really enjoy the tension and the range of the voice acting. I didn't even know Akira Ishida was casted as the main role until I'd started episode one -- I'd always loved the guy's acting, and god damn does offer sexy performances in this show.

It's a fairly simple drama really--and actually a tragedy as of this episode--but all its characters are gorgeously compelling. Everything progresses naturally because their actions reflect their character very well.

I can see this show easily making my favourites. Looking forward to that finale.

Don't look at me with those eyes, Konatsu!
>> ARTICLE
Everyone is only able to say what they really feel on the verge of death, and if they're willing to say so beforehand, then it means death of some sort is coming - It was the same with Master Yakumo confiding in Bon, or how Bon and Shin made their plans to the future, and Miyokichi bared her heart to Bon, just before they had to part ways. Same here. And man, that final scene, with how it just came to be. I'm really reminded of the movie version of A Single Man, with Colin Firth here. "What does it mean?" I asked myself here as well as there, and the real answer is, "The author wants you to think of a story, a theatre story."

Speaking of which, let's look at the final scene or two a couple more times, as it has a lot to discuss. First and foremost, it reminds me and addresses the scene in episode 9, [where Miyokichi tells Bon that the next time they meet, it'd be in hell](http://i.imgur.com/0hpqEnM.jpg). More than anything else, that scene felt like a *performance*. I spoke of it before, but the way the characters speak and interact with one another often follows the beats of a rakugo performance. Is this because it's Bon who's telling the story to Konatsu and Yotaro? I suspect it's more because this is the mindset the mangaka is in.

But look at it, Shin's actions were really straight out of a performance, often a rakugo one, or a soap opera one, in the last act. Just like in Yotaro's performance with the thief who listens in, he keeps listening to how his best friend and his wife (whom we see he loves) are about to hook up, and only barges in [when he fears the two of them might die together](http://i.imgur.com/P88X2ak.jpg). And later, when Bon is holding him from falling to his death, what stupid line does he come up with? "If you get hurt, you won't be able to perform rakugo any longer!" and that really made me sit back.

All of the ideas and emotions that motivate the characters of Rakugo Shinju are based off of real emotions, and in the small moments the characters have together, you can feel in them the same issues we all might struggle with. But aside from these small moments, and the rakugo performances which are obviously stylized variations on the same ideas we all must live with, when they go for drama, they tend to declaim and lose their precious and small humanity.

Yes, the balcony broke just as everything appeared to finally take a turn for the better, but *did* it really? We've just had Miyokichi admit her lack of love for her husband and daughter. Bon's "alcohol", as if he were the lush from the performance delivered by Bon was found out to be Miyokichi, for whom he went, if he could. He chose her, and trying to quench his own loneliness over his own brother, and his rakugo. And Shin? He ended up giving up rakugo for his wife, and that's certainly not a turnout that Bon would've considered "happy". And said wife would've accepted her husband's sacrifice of his own soul for her happiness. The relationship that'd have blossomed from this might've been better than the one they've had up to now because the people in it are actually willing to make an effort for the other one, but they'd all have turned out just as miserable as before.

Let's go back to the rakugo performance, which obviously came there to flesh out what the characters are feeling and thinking for them. The lush who gave up the drink, which was poisoning him and his life, for the sake of his treasure, which was his wife and her happiness. We've actually had a flash of Miyokichi during the storytelling, and while it was unclear whether it came from Shin or from Konatsu, I think it's the first time the show literally spelled out the reference it was making. But, let's look at it, which is the poison and which the treasure? Shin said his treasures are Konatsu and Miyokichi, but rakugo isn't *his* poison, but his wife's. His poison was the lack of ability to care about anything after he's given up his treasure, his *soul*, which was rakugo. If anything, it seems Miyokichi is his poison.

For Bon, everything is poison and treasure. Rakugo kept him from the people he cared for. But the people he cares for also keep him from rakugo mastery. To Bon, there is no happiness without finding a balance, which is what his journey was about, not giving up one for the other (the poisonous house-hold of "all or nothing" Miyokichi and Shin ended up in is what you get there), but trying to find a happy middle. Which he seems to have managed.

Or did he? This is a performance. This is bloody *Shakespearian*. What Bon ended up going for was *everything* - Rakugo *and* people. Shin *and* Miyokichi. And for hubris, one must pay.

P.S. And really, all the people who argued about how wrong I am when I said [Bon's perception of constantly being abandoned is what motivated him](http://i.imgur.com/pNFkj8X.jpg).

P.P.S. This was still a very good episode, but here, the characters not acting like people, but like characters in a play, in the last act, after the small and quiet talk between Bon and Shin about their different artistic viewpoints and hopes (Bon still holds his best rakugo is solitary, while Shin's is a dialogue. And neither is wrong, their styles complement one another, and their own personalities), just felt like it really needed to be addressed. It was a great performance, but that's exactly it, it felt like a *stage performance*, and not like people acting like beings made of flesh and blood.

I'm settled on my AotS. Erased has higher highs, but this show just nails every episode so well I forget I'm watching TV.
>> ARTICLE
11/10. Take my money! I need to know that there is a second season coming ASAP. 

This entire episode had me giddy with joy hearing Sukeroku doing rakugo again. But then the second half came and HOLY FUCKING SHIT. I legitimately had goosebumps and tears welling up in my eyes at the same time. Goddammit if this anime isnt a masterpiece I don't know what is anymore
>> ARTICLE
Damn, I was going into that episode thinking Miyokichi was gonna do something crazy and get Sukeroku killed (ie. with malicious intent) so the typically clich oh-the-floor-gave-way-beneath-us-and-tragedy-strikes was actually quite surprising and felt pretty good imo.

Back to the present next ep based on the preview?
>> ARTICLE
Huh. All along, the strength of the show has been its slow-cooker, realistic approach to its characters and drama. Can't say I'm too fond of this sudden swerve into the realm of melodrama. Seems  overbearing emotionally, especially when you consider how understated the rest of the show has been.

>> ARTICLE
That was a great fucking episode, they need to announce a second season or RIOT. 
>> ARTICLE
Seeing Sukeroku willingly give up rakugo forever for his family, yet still dying tragically, moments later... This is just too much to process. 

Between this and She and Her Cat, it's been a rough day on the feels. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow.... Just wow. Such a emotional ending. The one thing that pissed me off was how easily Sukeroku just threw his life away. I mean his kid is in the next room and he just gives up. I realize the banister was breaking and the situation was dire but I just hated seeing him just say fuck it and drop. 
>> ARTICLE
This would have been a good ending from a storytelling standpoint since it brings everything full-circle. However, I'm glad it's not ending on such a downer.
>> ARTICLE
And there it is. The moment we all knew was coming, yet it still feels so wrong ...  
Everything was going so well too. They could have been happy together, if it wasn't for that unbelievably shitty balcony. Seriously, how weak has it got to be to collapse when a woman leans on it?


I seriously have no idea how I feel about Miyokichi. In a way, she's responsible for everything that happened, but her story is just as tragic as everyone else's. It's all just one bad decision leading to another, culminating in that one fatal moment.
>> ARTICLE
I actually gasped out loud when Kiku licked her tears. I actually found it strangely erotic. Gahhh, i really love this show. The character development, the plot, the animation... everything is almost a perfect 10 for me. I'm really looking forward to next week's finale to see how this show will wrap up (I'll be in Japan when the finale gets released though, so nnngh @ the wait). Hope this show gets a second season, so they'll be able to cover more of the manga. I love Haruko Kumota's other works, so i can't wait for the manga to get translated too.
>> ARTICLE
Kill me, but I'm really not sure if I liked this ending or not. On the one hand it's definitely not what I expected (since the "Double Lovers Suicide" title and other things), and I don't think that what I expected was any better, so points for the show

But on the other - crumbling balcony? Accident combined with excessive melodrama? Really? Well...

On an unrelated note: It's probably very late to ask that now, but am I hearing wrong or Kiku addresses himself as *atashi* as he speaks? Was he doing that throughout the whole show?
>> ARTICLE
By excessive melodrama do you mean Sukeroku's plea for forgiveness? What did you find excessive, or even melodramatic?

Also, what didn't you like about the balcony? I thought it was a clever set-up for Miyokichi's vengeance, which made the accident of Sukeroku dying in Kiku's place more poignant
>> ARTICLE
> By excessive melodrama do you mean Sukeroku's plea for forgiveness? What did you find excessive, or even melodramatic?

I really hoped the whole thing would be more subdued, that there won't be anyone seriously thinking of killing anyone.  And that the eponymous suicide would be more metaphoric. Miyokichi has reasons to hate Kiku, but her wanting to actually die with him (even if for a split second) diminishes her character IMO.

I still liked many things about that ending, e.g. the fact it steered clear of imbecilic love triangle jealousy or that as it turned out basically everybody loved everybody, so I can't say it was bad or anything. But I simply expected more subtlety, so I think I feel a little betrayed. The series so far was impossibly good, so the ending which is 'just good' makes me feel a little disappointed. But I must think it over once again. 

What did you like about it? You weren't bothered how literal Miykoichi's vengeance was shaping up to be?
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I guess I liked the things you didn't. The series had been masterful with the metaphorical before, but it kind of feels like that built the tension necessary for them to pull this off without seeming "cheap". I see what you mean though, I usually tend towards subtlety as well. But I can't think of another ending to Kiku and Miyokichi's relationship that would have made more sense to me.

I expected that she would try to kill him one day anyways. What I didn't expect was Sukeroku's role in the whole situation, which is honestly what made the scene to me.
>> ARTICLE
Why do you think that Kikuhiko is telling the truth in every scene?

Rewatch the beginning arc before the flashback. There's one shot of Kikuhiko covered in blood. That doesn't happen here.
>> ARTICLE
Matsuda also uses atashi. In this case it's an era/artistry thing. If you were to here it in a modern setting it would have more of a feminine implication though.
>> ARTICLE
> am I hearing wrong or Kiku addresses himself as atashi as he speaks? And he was doing that throughout the whole show?

You are hearing it right. It wasn't too uncommon back in those days in Tokyo. I remember hearing some real life rakugoka actually did on TV shows, and a few (such as Utamaru) still do so. I also heard that many "Edokko" (those who take pride in being from Edo area) did so in Tokyo, probably up to Showa era, but not any more except for rakugo-ka (and maybe a few more from other jobs). 
>> ARTICLE
and what connotations does it have? And why it's only Kiku? ~~Bon~~ Sukeroku and their master both use *ore*, as far as I heard.

What do you mean by *It wasn't too uncommon back in those days in Tokyo*? It was not uncommon for artists or for general population? So *atashi* signifies Kiku self-depreciating his trade or his upplaying his feminine side (given how he was raised or what is his scenic persona), or just his adherence to older forms? Or local patriotism? 
>> ARTICLE
Bon = Kiku. Yes, indeed the master and Sukeroku both ~~say~~said *ore*. I think *atashi* sounded more polite and civil, and maybe sophisticated, but snobby (in those days, that is). **edit** Actually, the master said *atashi* occasionally, too.

It is now super-rare to hear a male referring to himself with atashi unless he is a rakugo-ka. I read that it was common among artisans and merchants in Edo area (which is a small area of Tokyo, ex-Edo town) in the old days. 

> So atashi signifies Kiku self-depreciating his trade or his upplaying his feminine side (given how he was raised or what is his scenic persona), or just his adherence to older forms? Or local patriotism?

I don't think so. It's just a polite form (nowadays a polite one would be watashi) that Kiku chose to use and it sounds classy. I wouldn't recommend any Japanese learners using this now, though. 

That reminded me, an old anime "Oishinbo" (gourmet anime) has a few episodes with an American character, Kairakutei Burakku(Black) who trained to be a rakugo-ka, and he called himself "atashi". 

His name was taken from a western rakugoka (Australia born Scotch, later naturalized to Japanese), [Henry James Black, aka, 1st Kairakutei Burakku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairakutei_Black_I), who played rakugo in Meiji-Taishou era. The 2nd Burakku is a half American Japanese who says "can't speak English but looks American". There is also a Canadian rakugo-ka, [Katsura Sunshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsura_Sunshine).
>> ARTICLE
I can't imagine how Kiku feels...

The people he loves the most in his life.  
His first love, and his brother who he looks up to.

Both gone, right in front of him, just as things were about to go well...

Every time he looks into Konatsu's eyes from the non, he'll see his failure to save them.  
His guilt. His regret. His maddening sadness...

Took him so long to get all of this off his chest...  
I cannot wait to see how things progress back in the current timeline once she knows all the facts.
>> ARTICLE
Ugh that ending bugged me and not sure why. It was a nice redemption for Yurie but just going out like that just felt so idk lame?

Well we all knew they would die somehow so I guess it doesn't really matter too much. Yurie was a flawed and interesting character right till the very end.

Looking forward to the finale and hopefully going back to "present" time.
>> ARTICLE
Were you expecting an actual suicide or a fight or maybe a "bigger" accident or something? Yurie definitely seemed like a woman with a purpose, so I think she was definitely was ready to die that night and was hell bent on taking someone with her. So I guess maybe that adds to the "disappointment" to how she went out? Though for me her trembling at the end before she met her demise seems to be her finally realizing what was going on, which I think adds more to it.

Also poor Sukeroku. After such a great performance, then a change of heart, to going out that way, just seems to perfectly sum up his life of bad luck. 

I don't know for me it just seems that this "lame" way fit pretty well with how everything was building. I guess I can kind of see how after Sukeroku agreeing to change and Yurie finally accepting and then immediately falling to their demise can be a bit lame or upsetting, but again it seems to fit with everyone's constant suffering haha. 

I agree with your fascination with Yurie though. Hell all of these characters are flawed and I'd even go as far as saying pretty detestable at times, but man are they freaking compelling/interesting characters. 

Sorry if this comes off like I'm trying to attack you or something. Definitely not. Just trying to see it from your point of view, since the scene seemed to work for me, I wanted to know why it didn't for someone else.

Final note it seems like later in the source material it is revealed there are multiple versions/viewpoints of this event, so here is to hoping for a season 2!
>> ARTICLE
I guess I was expecting something that wasn't that much based on luck or convenience? It fits the show but that doesn't mean I have to be happy about it. 
>> ARTICLE
At least we know it wasn't something that would have seemed like it was his fault, I was thinking this whole time he started a fire that killed them. Or something. The girl called him a murderer. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I was also thinking along those lines so I guess this is better? 
>> ARTICLE
Still tragic, and he probably still feels as guilty about it as if he did kill them. 

But, I'm happy it wasn't...something he had control over. 
>> ARTICLE
We'd been told from the opening episode that it was all just a tragic accident. The way the story is told, and Konatsu's insistence, we doubt what we were initially told, but it's true. I don't know if I can handle the opening to next week's episode when we get to see the flashback scene of Kiku holding the corpse of his brother, and Konatsu stumbling into the scene.
>> ARTICLE
Definetely my AOTS, (although I'm in the camp that found Erased pretty overrated) and I still don't *quite* believe it's by Deen of all studios.

If they can keep this level of animation/direction for Sakamoto next season, I'll be very pleased.

I need to know how adult Konatsu is going to react to the truth about parents.

But that end...  
Damn man...

That death was so stupid.

And in the end, that woman really did make me dislike her.

I've never seen an anime need a second season so bad. The narrative structure literally does not work without one.

The way they died was pretty lame tbh, ignoring that the episode was awesome, next week is the end mates.
>> ARTICLE
the way they died has meaning thats tied to the name of Rakugo itself.
>> ARTICLE
I think it would have been lame if the balcony crumbled *just* because Miyokichi and Sukeroku had to die, but I loved it because it was a trap for Kiku that backfired in a believable way. When Miyokichi said she'd have her vengeance/see Kiku in hell a few episodes back, I had no idea she was **serious**.
>> ARTICLE
apparently this season only covers around half of the manga. so maybe not end yet
>> ARTICLE
Good to know! I was a bit confused that they showed that guy that looked like the protagonist at the start of the anime, and we never saw him again, thank you.
>> ARTICLE
It was kinda unexpected when Kiku licked her tears lol. BUT NO :(((( THAT ENDING. 
>> ARTICLE
Whenever you read traditional Japanese fiction that idea that double suicide is the ultimate expression of love is always popping up. It's so f'ed up every time I see it, but I guess that's just a symptom of my foreign mentality. 

This is an example why we don't make things out of bamboo anymore. 

I honestly was surprised by how positive things were going and thought that there had to be a few more episodes to show things decline in Tokyo, then suddenly everything went to hell in a hand basket in the last 5 minutes. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda late but I still need to comment because I'm in tears. More for Konatsu than their deaths, though. Jesus, Miyo couldn't redeem herself even in the end, at least in my eyes she couldn't. I just wanted her to say or show that she at least cared about Konatsu.  
Either way, their death was very tragic and so very well directed, I was really into the whole scene. Stupid Sukeroku. Stupid Kiku (for licking her tears and falling for her again). Stupid Miyo. I can't really hate a single one of them, though. I can't wait until next episode to go back to the present, I'm hyped.

The two seiyuu are legit veterans, therefore they probably already mastered the way harder discipline of voice acting, which is pretending that you are bad at it:

Remember that they 'only' have to do the voices, while the mannerisms that belong to the whole performance are animated. And they got the voices down.

Yes, I bet she was too! But rakugo, especially this one, is a satire. You're supposed to be making fun of the retarded characters in the story and laugh at them, not to relate to them. Basically, her reaction is telling us that she doesn't understand what is being preached.

Thank you! :)

This song is so beautiful.

I know, I always get so hype when about halfway through the bass runs on its own and then that smooth piano joins in.

Some really clever use of graphic matches during Kiku's performance. They really helped paint an image of the story.
>> ARTICLE
This show is really pretty, isn't it? From the very definite [sense of locale and time](http://imgur.com/a/8xNt6) within Bon's memoir within the memoir, to how [the theatre suffuses Bon](http://imgur.com/a/sX5s4) as he tries to concentrate, and draws him to Shin's performance (and man, [this shot in particular](http://i.imgur.com/1TDnONC.jpg) is so good), and finally, [to the place Bon conjures within the viewers' minds](http://imgur.com/a/W0L7j) through his performance, which is also his most notable aspect in the "present", where his voice paints a scene and transports his listeners, and certainly did for Yotaro.

But I don't want to discuss all of that, or the relationship between Miyokichi and Bon, or Shin and Bon, that's something I've done before and will probably do in the future. Instead, let's talk about what this episode was about. Which was actually pretty clear, so why are we discussing it? Probably because I like the sound of my own written voice, but aside from that, that is.

And yes, I did say I'm not going to discuss what I mentioned above, but [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/1TDnONC.jpg) I pointed out earlier is actually relevant to the theme I want to discuss, which the episode also commented on through Bon's rakugo performance, and it was at the same time subtle and unsubtle. So what's going on here? Bon is trying to keep himself apart from the theatre, apart from Shin, apart from the audience. He tries to be his own person so hard that he's willing to lock everyone out. But as Shin's performance had shown us, it's a symbiotic relationship, where you need to allow others into your heart before they will allow you into theirs.

Bon had done rakugo out of necessity, and resented it. He did not let it into his heart, neither rakugo, nor a smile, so how could he bring the joy of rakugo to others? But as I said, that part was clear. What was the performance about then? The performance was about a woman it's not worth dying for. A woman that's not worth dying for not because she's going old and soft, but because she doesn't care for you, and because to her you're just a stand-in, the best she could get at the time and place. [And this is what rakugo had been to Bon](http://i.imgur.com/vCKLAGG.jpg), a thing he did because he had to, for an audience that happened to be there.

Is it any wonder they didn't warm up to him?

And although it's not too much of a mystery, I guess I can answer one more question for you all. What is it that allowed him to open up his heart? Was it that he was confronted with how he has other options, and yet chose to do it on himself? To a degree, yes, as simple as that. It's not as if his issue with Shin pointing the path out to him has suddenly disappeared, but it's the realization that even if he follows the path someone else pointed out, so long he also chose it for himself, it's his own path. That's it.

Except, to walk upon the path is to make a choice every step of the way. Bon was making this choice all along. But it's the recognition that it's a choice that is liberating, not the having of it. And of course, getting outside affirmation helps. He was struggling with having a talent for one thing (acting), but a desire for another (rakugo), but it's the realization that he does have a desire for rakugo, and not one born just out of expectations, that allowed rakugo in, and then out.

([Check out my blog](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/) or [the specific page for all my write-ups on Rakugo Shinju](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-episodic-notes/) if you enjoy reading my stuff.)

Wow, this episode went by so fast!

Glad that Kiku got it this time, what a great performance!
>> ARTICLE
The way Kiku was changing his posture, clothing and face between characters was so well done, really sold the story. Though he made the mistake of angering his fan girls, hope he doesn't end up regretting that.
>> ARTICLE
Was that... a flashback within a flashback?
>> ARTICLE
WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER
>> ARTICLE
Another show this season that I brushed off after reading the description but decided to binge out of necessity since I'm caught up on everything else.....

2 and a half hours just blew by.

DEEN.......no more Shonens you obviouslly overpay your explosion people and thats where it turns to shit stick to making beautifully done period pieces.

I just watched 6 episodes straight and it had to dawn on me this is a flashback totally forgot by the end of Ep 6

re-reading all the recaps for the episodes cmon guys.....you really want him to be gay that bad?

>> ARTICLE
for some reason this sub has an obsession with trannies and gays.
>> ARTICLE
yeaaaah...that checks out.

>> ARTICLE
This show is so damn good it's unfair. Easily the best of this season. That moment when the rakugo finally clicks with him, as well as the audience, was incredible. Feel bad for the people missing out on this.
>> ARTICLE
[removed]
>> ARTICLE
Do you have any legitimate complaints about the show other than people liking it?
>> ARTICLE
YES! Kiku comes into his own! It may have taken a little bit for Sukeroku's advice and his own experience to finally sink in, but in this episode we finally start to see glimpses of the master he will become. His portrayal of female characters in his rakugo is far more graceful and deliberate than Sukeroku's tendency to fall back on the outgoing, genki girl stereotype. If only all the episodes were as long as the first!
>> ARTICLE
Great episode and the rakugo was entertaining as always. it looks like in the next episode Miyo starts getting jealous of Kiku's friendship with Sukeroku which sucks because i really started to like Miyo. Hopefully she wont act too unreasonably. 

>> ARTICLE
I loved how you could actually notice the change in Kiku's expressions, tone, dramatic shifts and overall levity of his voice when he did the sexy style of rakugo. It didn't just feel like the series was telling us that this was his style. No. We could sense the style ourselves, through masterful voice acting and impressive cinematography.
>> ARTICLE
Did anyone else catch that look on Miyokichi's face when Bon was performing his rakugo? I think the talk of a lovers suicide was getting to her. That coupled with the translated title of the anime "Lover's Suicide Through Rakugo", i think we should be worried. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't get the ending of the Rakugo story.  It felt like it was just interrupted in the middle - he went to see the boss to get revenge on the hooker who duped him into trying to commit suicide, everybody was appalled at his state, one guy wasn't, and he was paralyzed with fear, and that's the end?  That's the punchline?  What am I missing?
>> ARTICLE
Shinagawa Shinjuu is a 2 part story and Kiku played the 1st half only. Yes, I agree it's weird too, but it often just ends there (otherwise it's too long). The last half is about this man taking a revenge on this woman, tricking her as a ghost with the help of his boss. [The full story played by San'yuutei Ensho is 40+ mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-3EW1PCIys) so, only a few scenes are played in anime.

The ending of the first half is about how supposedly tough strong gangs at the gambling place got scared of being caught (as they thought Kinzo banging the door was the police) and made stupid moves. The audience laugh at every stupid gang behaviors one by one described by the boss, and in the end they saw this single samurai staying still, awed at his samurai-ness, hear this samurai saying "koshi ga nukete orimashita"/just couldn't move at all. (In English expression, maybe it is more like he was just wetting his pants sitting there.) 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, that makes more sense, thanks!  I think if the anime wasn't going to adapt the story completely, they should've picked something that worked better in the allotted timeframe...
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know what you mean, but many classic rakugo stories are often "considered" known as common knowledge somehow (although most young Japanese don't know anything about rakugo.) Like Shakespeare plots and such, or maybe like famous anime in the past for r/anime. 

Still, story-wise, it is very important that Kiku played this and Sukeroku *Okechimyaku* (which is another long story that those not familiar with the story may not get it), and I think the production team did their best picking right parts for the anime scene. 

*edit*

Remember, point of these rakugo scenes are not to make you laugh with rakugo itself as a part of audience at the theater, but to show you how well they played and how the audience of the theater loved their acts.
>> ARTICLE
I love how Kiku realized the reason why he does rakugo, his performance really shows how true it is too.     

Also the performance itself was amazing! The visuals, the music, just everything.    

God I love this anime.
>> ARTICLE
Was Kiku's story the author's way of foreshadowing a double suicide between Miyokichi and Sukeroku via drowning? I can't help but think the OP with her being submerged underwater bears some significance. 
>> ARTICLE
It seems, at least from information that the driver mentions from the first episode, that Miyokichi died afterwards Sukeroku's accident :'(
>> ARTICLE
That would make sense, especially since 'Shinjuu' translates to 'Lovers' Suicide'.
>> ARTICLE
This was just... awesome.
>> ARTICLE
My heart literally skipped a beat when they showed Kin jumping into the sea and I fully expected Kiku to bow out but then he kept going and the pacing and BGM changed.

It's just like a boss fight where you drop the boss's HP to 0 and a cutscene plays where it's revealed that you only destroyed one of his many health bars and he shifts into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE 

Captivating performance like always, on stage and off
>> ARTICLE
Rakugo Shinjuu speaks to me like almost no anime did before. At first I saw that episode extremly annoyed with Yakumos character.

When hes alone he has such a gentle, fluid line of thought, and all the deepness is lost whenever he interacts with another person, hes just rude and/or cold. And at first I thought I was annoyed with him as a character from an anime.

But when I began to explain my fellings to a friend, I noticed that no, that I was annoyed with him as a person, because he himself is so self-centered that thats the only way he knows how to interact with others.

And thats exactly what Rakugo Shinjuu does to me. It makes me feel towards the characters and the story in a personal level. It makes me feel bored watching a Rakugo presentation without making me feel bored with the anime. It makes me feel annoyed with a character without being annoyed with his existance. Its an anime that provides a level of emotional immersion that, as I said up there, almost no anime did before. And thats where it shines so bright.
>> ARTICLE
So great to find Kiku finding his place. And with that, we see what I bet is the glaring difference between Sukeroku and Kiku: one does it for others, and the other one does it for himself. It's great how they foil each other so well.

Something which I'm waiting for is Kiku telling someone other than Yakumo, who already knows, about his origins. It'll be interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Seems initial hype for this anime dropped a bit, not much people here like on first few eps. Too bad though now that the show is starting to pick up. Only problem I have is not  knowing japanese, and losing part of the show with the translation. I'm really starting to get intersted in rakugo, but I think the language barrier is too much
>> ARTICLE
There are a few English rakugo performances on Youtube. You're right that a lot of the impact and humor is lost due to the language barrier. It's 100x better in a language you understand.
>> ARTICLE
I might do a quick search a look those up in the future.
>> ARTICLE
Honest question

after watching the long first ep, i didn't bite on the extended solo performance [regardless of how well it played] of the young fella. does the series rely on those moments of performance or is it tighter after the premier? 

i liked the first episode, i just didnt feel the need to keep going.
>> ARTICLE
"tighter"?

Those performances are just as important as the rest. They are a break from the plot, but contain a little bit of plot too.

If you liked it then that's all the reason you'd need to keep going...
>> ARTICLE
Cheers, ill marathon it when its done
>> ARTICLE
Wait, what was the punchline to Kiku's performance at the end? I didn't really get it. 
>> ARTICLE
Someone said its a 2 part story and he just ended part 1
>> ARTICLE
Looks like things heat up next episode
>> ARTICLE
Is it next week yet?  
I loved seeing Kiku being confident and enjoying his own rakugo. The whole part when he's telling the story was amazing. Seeing the audience, Kiku into the story and turning into the different characters, wow.
It looks like there's going to be a bit of drama next episode between Kiku and Miyo. Since it looks like Konatsu is Miyo's daughter (or maybe it has already been stated in the story? I can't remember), I wonder if Sukeroku and she will get closer soon?  

PS. Kiku's acting and his new found passion are going to be the death of me 
>> ARTICLE
I finally had the enthusiasm to watch this and it's awesome. I don't know why but Miyochiki just draws my full attention everytime I see her.
>> ARTICLE
Man im getting bad vibes of Miyokichi. I feel like Bitch gonna ruin everything. Why cant she not exist? 
>> ARTICLE
Aww. I adore her and hate her at the same time. She was the key person who taught Kiku to open himself up by her love, resulting in the same effect on the stage. Kiku had been craving for being loved for who he was, and now he is loved as a man by Miyo and he is loved as a rakugo-ka at the theater too, so it's all set up perfectly. 

We saw her typical bitchiness from the previous scenes. Her natural sweet and snobby flirting (different from other dumb hookers) way she talks (which I love as VA, but would dislike in real life), how she loves secrets, how she has been seducing Kiku and teaching him how to kiss (and more ofc), enjoying Kiku's reactions different from other ~~animal fuckers~~ men, how she was enjoying the jealous air from those girls at the cafe... And she is hot and she knows she is hot, and the worst part is her ignorance - she isn't doing it on purpose, but it is her female nature. We can already see that she is the typical drama queen. (though I think we all kinda sensed it when she first appeared.) 
>> ARTICLE
I really fail to see how she is "bitchy." She did everything she could to help Yakumo out. Please explain because I am genuinely curious as how she is a "bitch." 
>> ARTICLE
I think I explained in the comment you replied, though. Maybe it's something women see and men easily miss out, this is josei after all. In short, she has sex written all over her face (or at least that's how she is described), yet looks down on the men who got sex written all over their faces and goes after Kiku who is different. Yes, she is being nice and sweet to Kiku so far, and she isn't doing it for him, but to please herself. Look at how she unnecessarily touches him in public which isn't culturally accepted in this era of Japan? It isn't hard to imagine her selfish nature being played out soon, and her reaction to Kiku's shinjuu play sorta confirms our fear. 
>> ARTICLE
Does Yotarou appear yet in this episode?
>> ARTICLE
I doubt he will appear again this season, at least not until the very end.
>> ARTICLE
That bites
>> ARTICLE
We are seeing what Yakumo and Konatsu saw in Yotaro - which is Sukeroku - through these episodes. Watching these old episodes lets you patch up the pieces scattered around in ep 1, which you may have missed when you just watched the first episode for the first time without knowing any background. 
>> ARTICLE
"I wanna see Daddy's rakugo on a stage!"

Man this hit me hard. It's amazing how everything in this series gives so much depth to the events of the first episode. When Konatsu yelled out that line, all I could picture in my head was her reaction to seeing the rakugo performed by Yotarou in the first episode. Yotarou, who had studied rakugo by listening to recordings of Sukeroku. So when Konatsu saw Yotarou's rakugo, she was quite literally seeing her father's rakugo on-stage again.
>> ARTICLE
Dunno what it is with vibrant, beaming girls but having Konatsu/Naru in shows like these just adds such a likeable mechanism to revive weary artists. It feels silly to self-insert into a child, but I feel so childishly giddy when Sukeroku is performing. 
>> ARTICLE
The child character, done with Naru (Barakamon), Rin (Usagi Drop) and Konatsu, now, is really hard to pull off, but when they nail it, it's just too good. Those 3 characters are great.
>> ARTICLE
That's why children are so wonderful. They are far too young to hold an agenda as to why they enjoy something. It's just totally unfiltered and honest.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this show is just amazing. Every scene is perfect. I LOVED how they performed that rakugo together. And Konatsus excitement was adorable. 

Miyokichi has really not been able to stop thinking about Bon, just waiting this whole time for him to come and meet her, huh? Well Im not looking forward to their meeting. That will not end well. 

Btw, I rewatched the first episode two weeks ago since I had forgotten most part of it and I understood a lot more watching it now after seeing all these episodes. I can really recommend others to do the same if you haven't already. 

>> ARTICLE
Holy shit thanks for recommending, it hits right in the feels, watching ep 1 all over again feels great 
>> ARTICLE
Makes you wonder if Kiku feels his inability to tell Miyo not to take their relationship too seriously (or just even being in one at all) only to betray her feelings (even inadvertently) is why he blames himself for whatever horrible thing is going to happen next episode.
>> ARTICLE
rewatched episode one and forgot how much i loved yotaro.
and then i got to 31:24 in the episode and it really ruined me. not ready for next weeeeeeek!! 
>> ARTICLE
I just feel off kilter because yotaro seemed like he was going to be the protagonist, but was nothing more than a setting for the real story to be told. Kind of how Erased began in the present day, but the meat of the matter (sort of) takes place in the past.
>> ARTICLE
i keep hoping that yotaro will be back because i loved him in episode 1 and was frustrated on not getting his story. yakumo is the real protagonist of the series for sure, though. and the first episode makes more sense now after hearing his story. i want to believe that yakumo's "adoption" of yotaro is a way to lay sukeroku to rest. don't know how that will play out with only 2 episodes left though. i'm so desperate to know the rest of the story that i've been hunting for the manga all day...
>> ARTICLE
Has anyone actually scanlated the manga? I feel like I tried to find it too and couldn't find *anything* for it.
>> ARTICLE
looks like it hasn't yet... :'[
>> ARTICLE
The last episode will probably take us back to the present again to see Yotaros and Konatsus reactions. I hope the anime will get a second season to let us know how things will develop from there. Since the manga isnt finished yet (i think?) there is at least a continuation of the story once were back to the present. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm hoping we can get a season two with Yotaro and Konatsu taking the spotlight ^(I can hope)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I rewatched it around the same time and it helped a lot.
>> ARTICLE
Right? Actually I rewatched all episodes up until then. That was not the original plan but I couldnt stop. It was a long time ago an anime made me feel this way. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think I have ever rewatched a series WHILE it was airing, really it's a testament to how fucking great this show is.
>> ARTICLE
Next episode is gonna hit hard, I can feel it. You can brace yourself for the inevitable death of an anime character by terminal illness, that's nothing new. But bracing yourself for the inevitable suicide?

We are so fucked.

Edit: Wow, Miyo hate. Come on guys, y'all were hating Kiku for rejecting her just a couple episodes ago. The point is that all three of them are tragic characters. Miyo didn't abandon her family, she leaves for *work* (what else can an ex-geisha do for money?) and then comes back like Sukeroku says. Plus Sukeroku isn't exactly doing anything better staying in and sleeping while his daughter goes off alone to make money for him.

Edit2: I'm saying this because I don't want to see a bunch of comments in next week's thread celebrating a suicide.
>> ARTICLE
> Miyo didn't abandon her family, she leaves for work (what else can an ex-geisha do for money?) 

Well, seems like she actually did. She comes back either when her lover dumps her or she gets sick/bored of him, and then meets another and repeats. At least that's the impression I got from this episode. She hasn't been home for a while and that is why Kiku said they had to clean the house first.
>> ARTICLE
Again, she has no money and Suke has no job. She's not in a position where she can "gets sick/bored of" a client. She even mentioned to Kiku that this is what she would have to resort to doing a couple episodes back.
>> ARTICLE
There is a difference between a client and a lover. 
>> ARTICLE
Not when your 'lover' is paying for it and can get bored of you and dump you.
>> ARTICLE
By "lover" I meant "aijin", it's a role to have an affair, not necessarily someone you love, but also different from client.

*edit*

After all, she doesn't bring money home (and Konatsu is "working" instead), so obviously not a client for Konatsu's pov, nor mine.
>> ARTICLE
Both this and the final episode of She and her Cat. I am not prepared ;_;.
>> ARTICLE
Next Friday is gonna be a terrible day for rain and not even Muco can shield me
>> ARTICLE
Bro I'm so worried for that last episode of She and her Cat. I am expecting something bad to happen to Daru :(

That last sentence of Daru ;_;.

[I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PREVIEWS HERE.](/s "That preview completely stole the show for me. Getting Sukeroku back to rakugo was nice and all, and little Konatsu was a great character, but I was feeling all good until the preview came on. Now I'm shaking both in excitement and fear about next week.")
>> ARTICLE
> That preview completely stole the show for me

This is probably a gray area, but IMO the following rule should apply here:

> Please do not discuss any plot points which haven't appeared in the anime yet
>> ARTICLE
Well, it appeared in the previews, which is part of the anime, isn't it? It's like the same as speculating what's going to happen.


I mean, if you think I should tag it, I'll gladly do so. I certainly don't want to ruin someone else's viewing experience, if that's what's happening by talking about the previews.


Heck, I'll tag it right now. Sorry about that.
>> ARTICLE
tbh, I was thinking more of replies to your comment than specifically your comment.
>> ARTICLE
I'm kind of sad that I watched the preview to be honest, but I just want more so bad.
>> ARTICLE
I never watch episode previews for fear of spoilers. Now I don't know if I should go back and see.
>> ARTICLE
The hands at the end of the preview, the grip slipping. I'm guessing someone dies next episode.
>> ARTICLE
Considering episode 1 has Konatsu saying that Kiku killed her dad....
>> ARTICLE
It seems that Miyo is under the impression that Kiku came to get her even though he came for Sukeroku. I could only guess that she does something rash when she finds out which might lead to that scene in the previews. 
>> ARTICLE
their performance as a duo was so good.

then i remembered where the story goes with the cut to miyo and then the preview. :(
>> ARTICLE
Goddamn I legit shivered when they started performing together, this show is incredible
>> ARTICLE
That rakugo duo though, that was fun to watch :)

Miyokichi...I was upset that we didn't see her but when they finally showed her I was upset in a different way. Her character still fascinates me and will be looking forward to seeing the reunion! 
>> ARTICLE
I ended up tearing up at the end of the episode after getting so attached to how Kiku ended up sticking around trying to get Sukeroku back on track + bonding with Konatsu. Just knowing that this moment of calm and happiness will soon be crushed and the inevitable end to the lifelong friendship between Kiku and Sukeroku and the growing sort of doting familial bond that Kiku was starting to build with Konatsu (to be replaced with an underlying current of resentment) just made my heart drop like a stone.

I can't even bring myself to hate Miyokichi. I can see just how innately faulted she is and I can only marvel in how nuanced the character writing is. How her heart is still set on Kiku and how she dealt with her marriage for the sake of her child so poorly. I'm not surprised that her relationship with Sukeroku ended up sputtering out, but it's a shame that it left the family in such a fractured and unstable state. Though she's still clearly in the wrong for abandoning them and likely banning rakugo from the household because of her own lingering resentment that she couldn't have Kiku because he was so focused on rakugo instead of her. She's got attachment issues and has obviously never moved so it's likely that a rebuff from Kiku at this point would drive her to doing something drastic.
>> ARTICLE
This show really reminds me of two of the better shows from 2013. The first is Uchouten Kazoku, for its sense of atmosphere, its focus on family, and how old events are what the show revolves about, even if most of the story is told in the now, it's still under the inescapable shadow of the past. The other show is Kyousougiga, which also focuses on family, and on events that happened in the past (which we actually see much more of), but, it's also because the show is all about repetition, [and how families are themselves about cycles that one can't break out of](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/kyousogiga-capital-craze-families-are-cycles-without-end/). And that's the sort of storytelling on display in Rakugo Shinju.

I do keep talking about this every week, I feel like, but the show's most common technique, [which was especially on point in last week's episode](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-episode-10-notes/), is mirroring. It's using one action to reflect upon another, especially since we know how some things turned out. The best example from last week was how Bon turned away his hopeful apprentice, telling him he'll never pick up an apprentice, but also that rakugo is not a path for a decent boy. And then he ends up taking an ex-con as an apprentice, eventually.

And then in this episode, we have Konatsu relaying Miyokichi's words, [that rakugo is not work for honest people](http://i.imgur.com/wP2KBmZ.jpg), which echoes Bon's words, and must be part of why he won't let her perform rakugo later on in life. And of course, Miyokichi is looking for a ["decent and honest" job for her daughter](http://i.imgur.com/9E6xVXj.jpg), but she herself turns to an indecent life, because it's the only way she knows to survive.

Speaking of Konatsu, let's talk of her parents for a moment, all three of them (since we know Bon ended up adopting and raising her). They're all so selfish. Bon admits his selfishness outright, saying he desires Shin to return to performing for his sake. Shin, while he displays some textbook examples of depression, having lost his rakugo is still drowning in his self-pity, expecting his wife and [even child daughter](http://i.imgur.com/jLc7xF9.jpg) to take care of him and earn money for him. He doesn't even care why Miyokichi left, nor does he look for her. He just trusts she'll come back. And Miyokichi, [overcome with emotions over finding Bon's arrived](http://i.imgur.com/2kFQoKN.jpg), only thinks of how it affects her own feelings, and doesn't really think of her husband or daughter, that we can see.

Also speaking of Konatsu, mirroring and selfish adults, as an amusing aside, [this moment where Bon goes childish on her](http://i.imgur.com/yLHoiaP.jpg) and has her pay for her meal is quite funny. [Little children can't handle it](http://i.imgur.com/FPnsYVB.jpg) when adults mirror their behaviour at them, because all they see is someone else being selfish and taking away from their right to be selfish and at the center of attention, with all the toys ;-)

But to finish on the Konatsu path, it's important to note what convinced Shin to "return", or at least agree to it tentatively in the end - it wasn't for the sake of the audience back home, or the old masters. Meaning it wasn't for the world of rakugo. It wasn't even for Bon. It was for his daughter. He came back in one case that broke mirroring, where he decided to do it not for the sake of the past connections, but for the one symbolizing the future. And well, also the present, but Shin's always been one that's big on the present.

Going back to mirroring, it's time to return to two different situations with the show's main protagonist, Bon, or Kikuhiko, if you wish. In the first, it's mirroring with his past, and continuing his own growth, [as he refers to Shin as "brother"](http://i.imgur.com/ypBddE9.jpg), just as last episode he referred to the master as his "father", which shows he ended up warming to them (which we also saw when they went on the trip to Manchuria and he missed them), but the point is, he's growing to understand he can't be alone.

But we also have a mirroring where one could see it as growth, but it's more to see how Bon and Shin contrast one another, where Shin acts on this "growing understanding" of Bon and speaks of [how one cannot do rakugo on their own](http://i.imgur.com/kKSKCYa.jpg). This also fit what finally allowed Bon to blossom as a rakugo performer, where he learned to finally accept rakugo and the audience, and do his rakugo *for* them.

But there's a catch, [where Shin says you can't do rakugo without seeing the audience's faces](http://i.imgur.com/uqX7tcm.jpg). But last week we've seen the birth of Bon's greatest performance, "Shinigami" (which was referenced by Yotaro as the performance that moved him to want to pick up rakugo, as well as Shin commenting that Bon looks like a shinigami now, which made Konatsu shiver, and also hinted at the coming deaths). And in that performance, [Bon did *not* see the audience at all](http://i.imgur.com/Z2M8GZh.jpg), which is what allowed him to create that world. He performs rakugo *for* the audience, but not *with* them. [He creates a world for them to enter](http://i.imgur.com/rB1CvpO.jpg), rather than go out and enter theirs.

And this is another reason he needs Shin. He needs him for himself, because they're family. But he also needs the mirroring and contrasting, to save rakugo, as they always planned. He calls on him for the sake of the past: Their past closeness, their past pact, and for the sake of bringing rakugo, the relic of the past, to the future. For the sake of Konatsu, its signifier.

I can't believe you mentioned Uchouten Kazoku and Kyousuogiga in one paragraph! I could die of happiness. Those shows are some of my favorites in this medium and it looks like Shouwa Genroku is already going on that list too. 


>> ARTICLE
You know what the answer is, right? You should mention these shows more yourself! :) Kyousougiga was my favourite show of 2013. Uchouten Kazoku lagged several spots behind, but was still very good, and yup, it feels as if Rakugo Shinju is cut from the same cloth - both in focus, and in the general atmosphere of how it goes about it.

As much as I love Kiku main reason he refuses Konatsu is that he is a misogynistic jerk-ass.

It's more than just the best anime of the season, I'd go as far as saying it's the best anime in more than a year. I don't think I've enjoyed an anime this much since Ping Pong was airing. Shirobako's the only thing that comes close, but assuming Rakugo sticks the ending I'd give it the edge. Just like Ping Pong, SGRS really succeeds in its compelling character drama and solid thematic work. Anime are rarely written as well as SGRS.

Regarding "Nozarashi". (To be honest I'm not good enough to talk about this title - it isn't exactly my favorite and I may be misunderstanding the real joy of it, but trying to share the context here with those who are not familiar with rakugo.)

The story they did in this episode is called "Nozarashi/The exposed (bones)", one of the popular classics about this funny (silly) guy, Hachi/Hachigorou. The plot goes like this:

Hachi ("Hattsan") saw his neighbor getting laid with a beautiful young lady, but the neighbor told him that it was a ghost of the bones he found on the way home from fishing. He took care of it by giving a crude prayer with some sake, and the pleased ghost paid him a visit. Hachi, wanting to get laid, decided to go fishing "bones", hoping that a nice female ghost would visit him later for sex. 

The catch here is actually the bones that Hachi took care of belonged to a tough guy ([Goemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishikawa_Goemon), for a pun to go with "kama", implying sodomy), but this last part is usually skipped, and mostly it is about the funny behavior of the protagonist during "fishing". Hachi parodies a popular song (popular in meiji era) with the story he heard from his neighbor of how to meet this ghost lady, he acts out his own imagination of what's going to happen when he succeeds this "fishing" in a very funny way, and disturbs other people who were properly fishing. (What Kiku played in this episode was the first ghost story part and then a ghost woman of Hachi's imagination.)

(Some rich people who retired in Edo era enjoyed fishing as a hobby. They wasted so much money on the tools as hobby and didn't bother much about taking fish home to eat, so take this as one of the most luxurious hobbies. It is in a way making fun of this hobby by letting the lazy and silly stereotype Hachi do it as a joke, I think. Hachi even throws his hook into water.)

Now... would you be happy to see your 5-6 yrs old daughter appreciating this story as a parent?

-----

Konatsu mentions how Miyo says doing rakugo isn't a proper work for honest men (not really sure how it was translated in English sub, but "" is the original line), and it may sound weird to people living outside Japan and may think it's just Miyo, but that was the general idea in Japan at that time of the era. Entertainment was generally considered lewd business around this time, musician/actor/actress included (note that the things did change!) and most people didn't want their children to get involved even though all enjoy it as customers. Remember Kiku also told a wanna-be-apprentice this in the last episode? 

We have these two concepts of "yakuza" and "katagi"; *yakuza* (not the general yakuza as mafia) is how you earn money by taking advantages of people's emotions, including greed, desires and such, basically without producing anything material (producing fun or laugh excluded) and often very unstable as a job, and *katagi* is how you earn money by actual diligent labor which is supposed to be decently stable. The line is gray, but being katagi was considered ideal in general. Now people hardly say this any more, but some conservative guys still say "that's a yakuza business" referring to some jobs they despise. (Originally yakuza is a term to mean 893, the numbers of getting busted on hanafuda card game like getting 22 in black jack. This became adjective and now refers to those mafia-ish people, but adjective word "yakuza-na" still exists.)

How Yaku treats Konatsu as a kid compared to her as an adult. I don't think Konatsu likes Yaku's style of rakugo (more adult and serious type). She definately prefers the fun style Suke uses. How great it was to see Suke do rakugo and Yaku joining in. Konatsu certainly loved it.

I wonder where it all goes wrong. Konatsu says she doesn't need her mother because she hates rakugo. I'm thinking Miyu shows back up to Kiku who will reject her. She will then try take konatsu  back which somehow ends in an altercation between who ever the man was talking to her and Suke which results in his death. Kiku not having anyone to blame but himself decides to put the blame on konatsu starting the unfriendly relationship we saw in the beginning of the series.


>> ARTICLE
Only issue I see with your theory is that way back in episode one, the hostility isn't from Yakumo blaming Konatsu. Konatsu accuses Yakumo of murdering her father. And we still need the Shinjuu -- the double suicide. I've been certain for a long time that Sukeroku and Miyokichi would kill themselves together, in such a way that Konatsu would blame Kiku/Yakumo for driving them to that point. I still can't see how else the story could end, but after this episode I can't imagine how we'll get there.

>> ARTICLE
Damn, that last scene. Can't get over how solid this show is.
>> ARTICLE
I gotta say i wasn't expecting Miyo not to be there with Sukeroku and also leaving Konatsu, but I think it really makes her character so much more deeper by having it pan out this way.

Miyo stated before that she just wanted to be with a man and live a normal life as a wife, which is why the situation with Sukeroku came about. But both Sukeroku and Miyo realised that wasn't what they really wanted. Sukeroku couldn't let go of rakugo and Miyo didn't just want any man, she wanted Kiku.

In the same way, people might treat Miyo more harshly for leaving Konatsu, but both of them, Sukeroku and Miyo were both at fault. The only difference i would make is that Miyo was originally more emotionally warped which is why she may be seen as more extreme. This doesn't mean they were wrong to do what they did, but that they were human and made mistakes out of hate, anger, revenge, sadness, depression, what ever emotion you want to label it under.

The double suicide is the foreshadowed clincher in this story and by just having a really heartwarming and cheery episode in a generally tension filled and melancholic series, only means karmic retribution will have the next episode absolutely destroy me emotionally...
>> ARTICLE
Those two really look like a married couple! Like the shot when they were each holding one of Konatsu's hands, and especially that awesome rakugo duo.
>> ARTICLE
I loved Bon and Shin-san's reunion. It's amazing to see how much they still love each other even after all those years apart. They really are brothers.

I think I'll end up hating Miyo by the end of the show. She's being unfair to everyone else in the show, and even little Konatsu already feels animosity towards her.

10/10 episode, once again. Dat preview tho...

>Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental disorder in which people have an **inflated sense of their own importance**, a deep need for admiration and a lack of empathy for others. But behind this **mask of ultraconfidence** lies a fragile self-esteem that's **vulnerable to the slightest criticism**.

I don't think those parts describe Miyo at all. 

Here's another definition of NPD:

>Narcissistic Personality Disorder involves **arrogant behavior, a lack of empathy for other people**, and a need for admiration-**all of which must be consistently evident at work and in relationships**. People who are narcissistic are frequently described as **cocky, self-centered, manipulative,** and demanding. Narcissists may concentrate on unlikely personal outcomes (e.g., fame) and may be **convinced that they deserve special treatment**. 

>[Psycology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder)

Again, many traits that don't fit Miyo at all. She is needy but she is not demanding. She did not go to Suke after being rejected as some kind of petty revenge. She has never put on airs of grandiosity nor does she consider herself deserving of anything. She even apologized for the money she stole when she ran away with Suke. 

Additionally despite the number of cases where narcisists threaten suicide, narcissism does not lead to suicide. But we do know for certain, depression leads to suicide. Not to mention a narcissistic *mother* would involve a lot of emotional abuse directed towards her family.

I think you're stretching some aspects of her character to fit this definition. The show did not spend all this time building these complex characters so that they could fit such a basic mold at the end. They are all self-aware of their own shortcomings and they all face tragedies of their own creation.

Konatsu is so adorable.  I am so glad Bon got Sukeroku back.  That was the best performance at the end. Miyokichi pissed me off abandoning her family.

Wow, there is just so much in this episode to love.  
First of all, Konatsu is just friggin' adorable. Her design, her mannerisms, her little tsundere act at the beginning of the episode, it's all way too cute.  
Also, Bon and Shin/Sukeroku and Kiku are just great together. They really bring out the best in each other, and as much as they argue and complain about the other, you really get the feeling that they're happy together. That scene where they're walking with Konatsu together, acting as her two fathers, or the part where they do a two-man rakugo, those were fantastic. There's a 14 year-old tumblr fangirl in me somewhere that ships those two.  
Thirdly, HOLY SHIT some real bad stuff is going down next episode, I just know it. We've had this sinister feeling in the background ever since, well, since Miyokichi showed up. I have a feeling it's all going to come to a climax next time. I'm definitely not ready.  
I've probably said this before, but the character dynamics in this show are amazing. You have Kiku wanting Sukeroku to stop being a deadbeat and do rakugo again, allegedly for his own sake but it happens to be the best possible option, and then Konatsu goes along with it, to the point where she's almost more loyal to Kiku than to her own father. And then the three of them all come together, almost as a family, and it seems like everything's going to work out fine but then we get Miyo's scene to throw a spanner in the works. Ugh, I know she has her own issues, and none of it's really her fault, but ... she's going to ruin everything, I just know it.

This show is simply exquisite, which is an adjective I am usually unable to use when describing anime. The pacing is phenomenal and the VAs are doing an astounding job with all their performances. I understand that this sort of anime doesn't tailor to a large audience, hell josei anime rarely do but this one definitely shouldn't be slept on. I'm just incredibly glad that DEEN decided to animate this series and that Omata-sensei has been doing a superb job with it.


>> ARTICLE
This episode kinda surprised me a little with how everyone acted. I wasn't expecting Kiku to be so forgiving of Sukeroku and nor did I expect that Sukeroku would still be cheerful. I was honestly expecting him to have degraded much worse but he managed to basically stay the same with his laziness and not caring about cleanliness. However, we did get some more back and forth between the two about Rakugo again and Kiku opens up about how important Sukeroku's Rakugo was to him. 

As soon as Kiku stated he was going to stay there with Sukeroku and Konatsu, I just couldn't help but fear that Miyokichi was gonna come in and ruin everything somehow and based on the last scene, it's still very possible. I really liked Kiku's performance and how it was graceful and refined in contrast to Sukeroku's energetic and crude one. I had the biggest smile on my face when they performed together. The music comes in at just the right time and stays so upbeat to reflect the performance.

If only they could just stay in that place and keep performing forever with Konatsu. If only. ^Miyo ^^Please

Even though Kiku plays a role of a good guy now I want to point out his charming monologue about role of women in rakugo.

I somehow feel this might be important later. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been thinking on this for the last few days (since I read your comment here) if Kiku really said that to talk about "role of women in rakugo" or not. My conclusion so far is disagreement, I believe Kiku talked about Miyo here, as a reply to Konatsu's complaints to her mom, but in guise of a woman stereotype for Konatsu. 

Kiku is indeed very conservative in many ways and often has some sexist opinions, but in this scene, I think this monologue showed how Kiku loved Miyo being at the theater when Kiku played rakugo, and how her existence encouraged him, no matter how Miyo didn't care about rakugo at all. The last line there, "/woman is a creature who can make such(miracles) happen" sounded like as if he was speaking of a (biased) general stereotype of women, but I believe that's who Miyo was to Kiku, meaning Miyo had such a power, telling us how Kiku loved Miyo in his own way. I'd say this scene is indirectly showing Kiku's unspoken love for Miyo, sort of screening her faults.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know moonspeak so you have the higher ground here.

But I rewatched the scene and I totally don't agree with you. IMO it's deliberately staged by the anime to come off as chillingly misogynistic, hidden behind the thin veil of 'women's beauty' (namely Miyo's) appreciation.
>> ARTICLE
We can agree to disagree :) 

I just think that this scene's significance is that Kiku didn't come here only for Sukeroku but for all 3, and while there is certain sexism people may not appreciate here, I don't find him necessarily misogynistic. 

By the way, even though I love Turn A, 'moonspeak' sounds quite derogatory to me. I hope you aren't trying to be offensive, and it's just these bits and pieces people see things differently from whatever. 
>> ARTICLE
> By the way, even though I love Turn A, 'moonspeak' sounds quite derogatory to me. I hope you aren't trying to be offensive, and it's just these bits and pieces people see things differently from cultural background. 

gosh. 

On the one hand I'll admit I'm not a native English speaker, so I might struggle sometimes to express myself properly. From what I understood 'moonspeak' is a lightly derogatory term, used for comedic purposes. On the other - I noticed that significant part of the Anglosphere developed a culture of 'being offended' for bizarre things and I think I find it ridiculous. 

So if I failed to be playfully offensive then tell me. But if you are from the aforementioned part of the Anglosphere and the concept of 'being playfully derogative' is alien to you then deal with it, because I really don't give a shit. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, please don't get offended, I didn't get why you chose the term in this context and wondered if you were trying to offend me along with "on the higher ground" :( (Which is why I said "I hope you aren't" to say I didn't take the offence, and added a smiley to be safe.)

I mean, it's just a bullshit patriarchal attitude to justify the freezing out of women in the world of theater. He tells her she'll understand when she grows older, which is just a way of kicking the can down the road until she's old enough to start getting discriminated against instead of just being a cute little kid.
>> ARTICLE
Hasn't it already been reference pre-flashback? I thought Kiku had previously refused to take Konatsu on as an apprentice, previously? Or disparaged her from practicing rakugo?

His monologue parallels his own upbringing in a geisha house, and how he shouldn't be playing a shamisen and dancing because they were feminine, if I remember correctly.

> Hasn't it already been reference pre-flashback? I thought Kiku had previously refused to take Konatsu on as an apprentice, previously? Or disparaged her from practicing rakugo?

Fantastic episode! Konatsu melted my heart. Kiku dotting on her was pretty sweet to see too, made me think how much of a better father he is and a little sadder to remember how bitter their relationship in the present is. Sukeroku was a piece of shit father for a big portion of the episode but managed to redeem himself a little bit at the end there, just a bit. The scene with the both of them doing Rakugo together had me in fits of laughter ^^^and ^^^fangirling ^^^squeals. I love how they emphasized Konatsu's reactions since obviously she was the audience and Sukeroku was doing it for her, finally seeing the face of his audience again.  
Miyokichi, on the other hand, I wonder if she will redeem herself? After seeing the preview, things are looking grim on her end.
>> ARTICLE
Man, is it just me who felt hurt when Konatsu said bad stuff about Miyo? I mean, she's the one who looked after both her and Suke.
 I just can't hate Miyokichi, I mean this entire series is more about Miyo to me then it would ever be about anyone else. She's just one of the most interesting women I've seen in anime since like 2011. 
I read a few scans on mediafire, and there's a stark difference in Miyokichi's portrayal in the manga compared to the anime, even if the scene is perfectly reproduced. The anime makes her this tragic Ophelia like character while the manga sorta uses her like an old BL femme fatale trope. 
I just wish to see more of her, but I know that might not happen.
>> ARTICLE
you've seen the manga raws! How has the anime's portrayal of events differ? Not much at all or does it actually take liberties, even semantically? That stuff you said about Miyokichi not seeming quite as nuanced as she's portrayed to be in the anime is interesting, as the mangaka well...started their career writing BL. Not the most comforting place to look for good female characters. This comment actually makes me worry a bit about Konatsu, tbh! I hope that comment Kiku says to her about women in rakugo wont be...justified by the work itself. Urk.

This show is a 11/10 and is underrated as fuck. I'm disappointed that there's only a few episodes left, but i have a feeling that no matter what I'm still going to love this show to death. This is right up there for me with Uchouten Kazoku and Tatami Galaxy as one of the best animes out there (i didn't start watching until the 2010s, so forgive me if you feel otherwise). I don't know if any of you have seen it, but this show often gives me Mad Men vibes. More sex in mad men, but the drama is on equal terms.

Too excited for the next episode. I'm probably going to rewatch it all soon.

edit:
I forgot to mention something really important: this anime handles aging VERY well. I love that it's easy to tell how Sukeroku's and Kiku's paths have molded the way they look. Sukeroku looks especially scruffy and his hair looks a lot thinner. His scruff is messy and he's got droopier eyes. Meanwhile, Kiku looks the most refined he's ever been in the show.

> their innovative "two-man rakugo"

he he! I really liked that too! Unfortunately, it's actually called "manzai" (but what they were doing was two-man doing one rakugo) and already existing before this time. Imo, "manzai" is the genre that pushed rakugo off the main stage for comedy shows, especially in 70s to 80s.

The boys finally performed together, and it. Was. AMAZING.

Old Eminem lyrics came to mind after seeing this (altered to fit the show).  

You 'bout to witness rak'go in its most purest,

chip off the old block, but Bon 'n Shin're back!  

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo, two old friends, why panic,

you already know who's fully capable, the Yakumo heroes,

dial straight down the center eight-zero-zero you can even call collect,

the most feared duet, since pop and S'kerok', played career Russian Roulette,

and never seen us blink or get to bustin a sweat, people steppin over people just to rush to the set,

just to see some artists who breathe so freely,

ease over stories, and be so breezy, Buddah, how can shows be so easy,

how can one Miyo be so Kichi?

Shamelessly riding your comment to ask this (I don't think I can hope to get a reply if I ask it randomly), but does anyone know the story Kiku is telling himself when he goes home after going at Yakumo's house? The one about lovesickness. Which story is it? I tried typing everything he says in Japanese and put it in Google (even with the keyword rakugo/) but I can't find shit.

(If anyone is wondering what I typed or wants to check mistakes, I tried (?/? It feels like  but said differently) Then he says something about  and I can't hear the rest). Anyway, I need help with keywords when Googling in Japanese <<

If anyone knows it that'd be cool! (or a site where I can find all these rakugo stories) Also if someone has translated rakugo shows on Youtube or what I'd be interested.

It's called [](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%BA%E5%B1%8B%E9%AB%98%E5%B0%BE), a famous love story of a ~~poor~~not rich but diligent man falling in love with the highest rank oiran(geisha), with the happy ending of them getting married later after he worked so hard to get enough money to buy her.

Wooow thanks!! The writing style is so interesting. I'm definitely gonna thoroughly check it out :]

I mean, the title of the show says 'Shinjuu' in it. This was only ever going in one direction...

The two man show... that's a death flag

I have a feeling there will be a double suicide, especially since Miyo reacted so strongly at that part of Kiku's rakugo before.

Probably that rakugo is foreshadowing the things will come.
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap I never even thought about that
>> ARTICLE
The fact that Sukeroku is already dead is kind of the be all, end all of death flags.
>> ARTICLE
Being Miyo is suffering. This story feels like a tragedy. I bet that the fact that Kiku is the one who becomes Yakumo will make the rift that Sukeroku and him will inevitably have by then into a chasm.
>> ARTICLE
Kiku just seems to be a type of man who can't really settle with a drama free life it seems. Despite him seemingly wanting to escape the hole his parents put him in, it seems like he has some of their tendencies himself.
>> ARTICLE
From the previews it kind of looks like Sukeroku tries to force himself on Miyo and when she tells Kiku, he seems to be mad at her rather than Sukeroku. This plus the Yakumo event you mentioned may cause Miyo and Sukeroku to eventually end up together to spite Kiku. 
>> ARTICLE
A crying Geisha, this isn't going to end well, poor Miyo. :(

I'm wondering if she'll end up through a broken heart and sake cocktail in the arms of Sukeroku. Which then leads to her getting pregnant with Konatsu.

A brokenhearted Miyo seducing Sukeroku for the comfort she could never get from Kiku is great way to go. I hope it goes this way instead of the theory of Kiku being in love with Sukeroku.

I don't see why those two are mutually exclusive.

Shit. Son.
>> ARTICLE
I'm so confused about whether or not Kiku is in love with Sukeroku.

I'm not sure if he doesn't want to get attached to Miyokichi because he just doesn't love her, or because he doesn't want to be with women in general. In any case, I feel horrible for Miyo, since Kiku hasn't been up front with her about what he wants. I think things have progressed to the point that it can't *just* be about Kiku being career-oriented. That's just his constant excuse for not spending time with Miyo. But, as we see from Sukeroku, you can fool around all you want, and have just as much success, as long as you have talent. So, Kiku is lying when he claims he has no time for Miyokichi.

You have Kiku treating Sukeroku like a girlfriend/wife would in this episode. He buys clothes for him, he cleans his ears and lets him fall asleep on his lap. He relaxes and has drinks with him. All of these are things that Miyokichi would love to see from Kiku, but he's unwilling to be that way with her. Maybe his feelings towards women stem from growing up surrounded by the dancers we were shown last episode. 

If Kiku is in love with him, when Sukeroku hooks up with Miyokichi while Kiku is away on this trip, he's going to be devastated in more ways than one.

Edit: Added some more thoughts.

It's fujobait, same as Hibike Euphonium.
>> ARTICLE
I'm the weird guy who is of the opinion that what happened in Euphonium wasn't bait (even if it differs from what happened in the LN). Season 2 will confirm. I BELIEVE.
>> ARTICLE
i would like to remind you, in the first episode, kiku is single (whether the partner died or never had one, probs never had one, cuz no more wars?)

but then sukeroku has a child, and it's probably not just any child, considering how much kiku looks after her
>> ARTICLE
I don't really get why you need to remind me of that? I understand and remember all of that.
>> ARTICLE
so..... you can kinda guess what happens if the war they had was WWI or WWII 

WWII means that he's gonna abandon miyokichi, or miyokichi is going to have someone else (maybe even sukeroku)

WWI, WWII happens, and sukeroku dies with leaving the child, probs mitokichi this time

those are the 2 simplest routes 


i mean most stories out there are predictable, but i'll be happy if they did something that i couldn't guess at all
>> ARTICLE
he moved to the country side in 1941 for the world war, which means it was world war II not I
>> ARTICLE
I think WWII already occurred in the timeline of the show. Sukeroku left with Yakumo to entertain the troops in Manchuria, if I remember correctly. So that would've taken place during WWII.

So both World Wars have already ended, so I don't think Sukeroku's death is going to have anything to do with military service. I could be wrong.
>> ARTICLE
then probs he abandons miyokichi, then she gets a child with sukeroku (probs, sukeroku's fault), he comes back found out they had a child, then the accident occurs, and he takes care of the child?
>> ARTICLE
> he cleans his ears

*Thank* you, I couldn't figure out what the heck that implement was
>> ARTICLE
It's probably worth noting that [cleaning someone's ears](http://www.tofugu.com/2014/07/17/can-you-dig-it-of-love-and-earwax/) is seen as an intimate gesture in Japanese culture. It can be familial love or romantic love, but either way it's meant to indicate a very close relationship. It means something that Kiku cleans Sukeroku's ears. Personally, I lean more towards Kiku having romantic feelings towards Sukeroku, if only because his previous relationships with women seemed to lack that kind of intimacy and openness (also the original mangaka writes a lot of BL), but I have doubts that the show will explicitly state so. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm not trying to be insensitive, I have no problems with homosexuality, but I don't really want Kiku to be gay. I really like all the characters so far. I can relate to them and understand them. If the story delves into homosexuality between the two main characters its just gonna lose me and its gonna be harder for me to relate.
>> ARTICLE
There's plenty of anime straight people like us can relate to, so what's the problem with one for gay people? Also not having *any* problems with homosexuality and really not wanting to have MCs in your shows be gay seems contradictory to me. If you can relate to 20th century Japanese people practicing a dying art-form relating to various other things doesn't seem that hard. It's not even a romance show to begin with, all of this is just a prologue to Yotaro's story.
>> ARTICLE
Ya you're right. I don't think I really meant what I said. I just don't care to watch a homosexual relationship between 2 main characters in anime.
>> ARTICLE
This sounds like a tumblr response, and I hate myself for that reason, but--
Wouldn't Kiku being a homosexual give you an opportunity to try to relate with and understand a different perspective? Human emotions are fairly universal, no matter who you want to bone.
>> ARTICLE
Yes, I suppose it would but I'm not sure I actually meant what I said. 

I think the idea of Kiku being distant towards Miyokichi because of his reserved and strict personality is much more interesting than him being distant because he's gay. The first gives him an opportunity to change or for Miyo to break through to him. The latter likely presents a more simple conclusion. Maybe they don't directly answer that question and make you wonder if he was gay or not after the final episode airs. I think I would prefer that ending the most.
>> ARTICLE
There is a lot of ambiguity in these things because you can get that ear wax job done from just friends and acquaintances as well. Maybe even Kiku doesn't know where his feelings lie. It could also be intense brotherly love as well.
>> ARTICLE
Oh so that WAS ear cleaning? The big fluffy thing on the end put me off a little. But what I want to know is why Sukeroku, knowing he usually falls asleep after ear cleaning, would agree to it. Didn't he want to go out drinking?
>> ARTICLE
> I'm not sure if he doesn't want to get attached to Miyokichi because he just doesn't love her, or because he doesn't want to be with women in general.

I get a totally different impression - that he *does* love her, but doesn't want to act on it because of her being the mistress of his mentor.  I think that's why he reacted even more coldly toward her after Yakumo inquired about their relationship.
>> ARTICLE
Is it for sure tht Miyokichi slept with the Mentor?? for some reason, If i was Kiku, that would be super wierd for me
>> ARTICLE
~~She's introduced as "his mistress" when we first meet her, and Yakumo asks that she be kept a secret from his wife, so...~~

EDIT - It's not that simple.  See my comment below. 

Episode 4, I believe. (It is.)
>> ARTICLE
Uhh damn it. I totally misuderstood. I thought Yakumo was saying to keep his affiliation with the Geisha a secret. And Sukeroku was just assuming things. ohh man this must be so wierd for Kiku
>> ARTICLE
Actually, I just went back to check the episode.  

Yakumo just introduces her by name, says they met in Manchuria, and he got her a job training as a geisha.  He then says "Don't tell the wife."

Miyokichi then approaches Kiku at the show, and he asks if the master told her to show him a good time.  She says no, and invites him to come visit her, but to keep it a secret.  When he says he won't, she says she doesn't really care and to get Yakumo to pay for her time.

It *is* Sukeroku who says "Hey, that woman is his mistress, right?"  

So, I guess it is more a matter of conjecture than I thought.
>> ARTICLE
He met her in Manchuria while on entertainment tours for the troops. I have little doubt that she was his mistress. But a large part of that is probably him using his status to protect her from becoming a common comfort woman for the regular troops.  It's painfully obvious to us as viewers that he was trying to set up Kiku and Miyokichi together since he knows the straight laced Kiku would take care of her when he can't now that he's at home with his wife.  But Kiku is probably too straight laced and also too oblivious to pick up the hint that his master his trying to do him a solid.  And everyone else not really understanding the nature of their relationship and commenting about it off the cuff probably made things more confusing.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's another hollow excuse.  It's pretty clear early on that his master is trying to hook the two up together actually. It's his way of looking after the both of them since he knows the straight laced Kiku will take care of her, and he can't really be with Miyokichi now that he's returned home to his wife.

I think Kiku's hangups are really complicated. His relationship with women, geisha especially, is really broken/busted from his childhood. He's also the type of introverted personality that's painfully incapable of handling his feelings directly. When he started practicing Rakugo in the street while walking home, those lines about not being capable of talking to women was chosen by the writer very intentionally.

Plus, I'm sure Kiku has reservations about Miyokichi's true intentions as well. Remember when Kiku overheard her dismissing Kiku as 'not like that' when questioning whether he was a threat to sleep with her?  I'm sure that kind of dismissal would cut to the bone for any red blooded dude, and make you wonder what she's even there for. She acts like she wants to be pampered like a girlfriend, but insofar as I can tell their relationship is strictly platonic, and as forward as she is, she's never actually tried to take advantage of him. As a guy, I'd have to wonder if she was really interested in me as a love interest or if I was just her wagamama emotional dumping ground.

Plus, there's the obvious 'he's probably gay' angle but if he is, I don't think he's aware of it, or is in such strict denial about it thanks to societal/cultural expectations back then.

Which is shitty because from her perspective, I'm sure she really does love him.  She works as a borderline prostitue, and was likely a straight up comfort woman during the war. Kiku is a gentleman and she can relax and be herself around him without any fear of crass sexual violence or the usual pressures men put on women. It's probably extremely comforting to her but at the same time extremely frustrating that he won't progress the relationship or take her seriously.

The way he treated her this episode was cold as ice and emotionally devastating. But at the same time, I kinda get his perspective as well. It really is the makings of a tragic scenario.  I'm positive we'll be in store for some tears sorrow soon as fans.  But just keep telling ourselves - we've still got the present era stuff to look forwards to heal our souls afterwards. If you guys want something super spoilerific, but heartwarming, look up the cover of the recently released 9th tankobon.
>> ARTICLE
>  Remember when Kiku overheard her dismissing Kiku as 'not like that' when questioning whether he was a threat to sleep with her? 

That wasn't what that was about. The other girl said "if they find out you're bringing customers to your house, you'll be in huge trouble." By "he isn't like that" she was making clear that the relationship was personal, not business.
>> ARTICLE
I think you're right
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, this is the impression I got as well.  He was after all willing to blow Sukeroku off to visit Miyokichi plenty in the past so I think that discussion with the master must have had an effect on him.  

I wish the master had been a bit more transparent in his questioning.  I doubt he meant it the way Kiku seems to have interpreted things since he's the one who tried to hook them up and he's the only one in a position where it's socially acceptable to be nosy.  
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, that's another possible issue. It's possible that their relationship going any further could severely damage Miyokichi's career, and that type of scandal could sink Kiku's career as well.
>> ARTICLE
With how "by the rules" Kiku plays everything, I had considered that angle too.  It seems that in the post-war period (in which the anime takes place), it was acceptable for geisha to have boyfriends, but if they chose to marry, they were expected to retire.
>> ARTICLE
> if they chose to marry, they were expected to retire.

Basically, a man would have to buy her up or would have to put up with her taking "customers" while himself being treated as one of them and not to be married, or run away (to commit shinjuu or far enough away). 
>> ARTICLE
[Geisha weren't what you're thinking.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha#Geisha_and_prostitution)
>> ARTICLE
She is apparently not one of those high class geisha. 

*edit*

I actually cannot tell how things were in Tokyo at this time of era, so, let's say Miyo was a rather high end noble entertainer geisha, although she started her geisha career rather late. We saw 7-daime was her patron for a while, even though this episode showed that he wasn't seeing her lately. Miyo is taking lessons which cost her a lot, and her kimono, makeup and hair (don't forget she's got some nice expensive western clothes too) which of course cost her a lot, which are or used to be covered by 7-daime. If 7-daime is still paying the cost, then Kiku would have to talk to him, if nobody is paying the cost now then Miyo may have some debts. 
>> ARTICLE
It's more like they technically *were* kind of like what /u/originalforeignmind was thinking, but there's a radically different way of viewing it that is lost in translation, cross-culturally.

In the traditional Western mind, entertaining people with music and art, and entertaining people with sex are two entirely different things, since the latter marks you as a "prostitute" and an inherently immoral outcast. That's why the debate over "whether geisha were prostitutes or not" even makes sense to them. In Eastern traditions, however, engaging in "prostitution" didn't necessarily make you immoral, and sexuality itself was considered a kind of *performing art*, in the same class of things as music, poetry, and dance.

The Western debate over whether geisha were prostitutes displays a similar confusion as the debate over whether Indian *devadasi* were prostitutes. There's a cultural dissonance in both cases, because first off, sex was not perceived as degrading or polluting in either Indian or Japanese culture the way it traditionally was in the West, and second, both geisha and devadasi were not outcasts or pariahs in traditional Indian/Japanese society even though they occasionally had sex with men as part of their jobs. Indeed, geishas were seen as highly cultured, and devadasi had an important function as temple assistants. 
>> ARTICLE
Just to make it clear, geisha are definitely different from general low class prostitutes, who were never called geisha but called by different names like Yuna, Yotaka, and such, who were actually what you call *immoral outcast*. However, geisha tradition was at the very wide grey borderline, and the situation varied a lot depending on areas and era, brothel to brothel, woman to woman. Still, geisha all learned how to dance, sing, play music and such, and many engaged in prostitution as well. There were also women who were hired to serve meals and sake at parties where geisha dance and play music, but they weren't called geisha either, more like waitresses who sit next to you while you eat and drink (I forgot what they were called, but they also were working for geisha brothels called chaya, okiya or kenban). 

So, if what I said had made some people think I was talking about general hookers or some sort, then that was never what I meant. 
>> ARTICLE
The last shot of her in the episode was just heart breaking. 
>> ARTICLE
And that transition into that ending was *our* hearts breaking.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like Miyo is going to hook up with Sukeroku while Kiku is on tour. I think it's going to further play into the jealousy Kiku sometimes has for Sukeroku. Kiku feels the need to sacrifice fun and obey his rakugo seniors in order to excel in the rakugo world, and sees Sukeroku doing the exact opposite and still excelling. Kiku also felt the need to give up his relationship with Miyo in order to please his master (angry master may hinder his career) and I think after he sees Sakeroku continuing to excel while in a relationship with Miyo it's going to take Kiku over the top. 
>> ARTICLE
From the previews it kind of looks like Sukeroku tries to force himself on Miyo and when she tells Kiku, he seems to be mad at her rather than Sukeroku. 
>> ARTICLE
I still think Miyo will be the fruit of all trouble. She would probably get with SUkeroku to make Kiku Jealous and tht will start the whole succession of events
>> ARTICLE
I just looked at the preview again, at that does look like a possibility though it's hard to believe Sukeroku would do something like that. Sometimes these previews can be deceiving in how the cut the scenes together so it hard to tell. 
>> ARTICLE
This is a great show
>> ARTICLE
Damn it.. The scene where Kiku tells Miyo he's going to be gone for a while was heart crushing..
>> ARTICLE
Did you see him be destroyed when his master asked him about their relationship? From his cane you could tell he wanted to flee, but he isn't Sukeroku.
>> ARTICLE
Miyo:  "Promise, okay?"

Kiku:  "Goodbye."

Me:  ":("
>> ARTICLE
Man, Kiku, I am rooting for you but why do you have to be such a dick to sweet Miyokichi? 

I really don't think he is in love with Sukeroku, but I do think he prioritizes that relationship far higher than his with Miyokichi. Maybe he's conflicted about her, maybe he just doesn't care about her as much, whatever. But he's being cruel. :(
>> ARTICLE
(>.<) Kiku is indeed being cruel to her, but she wasn't being very nice to him either. They both aren't thinking about each other much. She fell in love with him because he was different, but now she is unhappy about that. She could be pleased with how he is pleased and enjoying his first time rakugo success days, but instead [she complains](http://imgur.com/GV6prBX). On top of that, she pressures him to be a shin'uchi and the reason was so that she might have more time with him, and that was right after he told her how he wanted to do more rakugo. She isn't encouraging him to do better rakugo any more, but rather trying to take rakugo away from him to spend time with him.
>> ARTICLE
I don't fault Miyokichi, because she's being upfront and communicating what she wantsmore of his care and attention. She's entitled to her desires. On the other hand, Kiku's implying that he has bigger priorities (to which he is also entitled), but is not laying out his intentions clearly. He knows what she wants, and either he can provide it or he can't. But he isn't taking any action.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he should just cut it off. Though, also think about her relationship with his master, and how that might complicate things in unforseen ways.


>> ARTICLE
His actions before his master invited him on the tour and his actions after his master invited him on the tour are different. He's not a warm person around women to begin with, then he feels obligated to cut ties because his master reminded Kiku of Miyo and his Master's relationship. He does seem to like her in his own way, but it isn't enough for her and his master's reminder made him shut down even further.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, he should just cut it off. Though, also think about her relationship with his master, and how that might complicate things in unforseen ways.


>> ARTICLE
If I'm honest, I've felt that Miyo has been very forceful with Kiku from the start. Kiku never gave any signals that he was open to her prodding, but she kept on prodding. He clearly accepted friendship as a possibility, but I struggle to believe that he was anything other than annoyed with her constant attempts to drag him into a romance he did not want.

Miyo is the cruel one, in this case. She shouldn't have targeted Kiku in this way, and shouldn't be surprised that she's getting pushed away now after being so suffocatingly nagging around Kiku.
>> ARTICLE
This was my favorite episode so far (apart from the first one).

I really like the way the different moods and emotions are conveyed in the show in general and this episode it felt extraordinarily strong to me.

The downside is that I feel really bad for Miyokichi. I hope their situation changes for the better.

I hate this episode and probably the next ones because I just feel bad for Miyokichi and the situations probably gonna get worse based on the preview and first episode

This episode was hard to watch but wow as it ever good. I feel bad for Miyo but he clearly doesn't care about her. 
>> ARTICLE
My thoughts exactly
>> ARTICLE
> I feel bad for Miyo but he clearly doesn't care about her

I feel bad for Miyo too, but I think he cares about her. It's just that rakugo is his first priority, he believes he needs rakugo to survive and he is doing rakugo for himself, which was explained in the previous episode. While, on the other hand, Sukeroku (and Yotaro too) is doing rakugo for others to have fun. (This contrast really stands out.) So, Kiku cannot betray his rakugo master especially after he asked him about her. 
>> ARTICLE
He doesn't want to hang out with her but has time for Sukeroku and he didn't even tell her he was leaving :(
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, but that was after the master asked him about Miyo. Before that, he was regularly seeing her and even told her about the happening in the bath house and how much he was devoted to rakugo and such (although Miyo didn't like it). The way Kiku smiled at Sukeroku and Miyo arguing about stupid stuff was very heartwarming. I'd say he would have had told her about the tour if the master didn't mention Miyo to him that night like that. The self practicing rakugo about being in love with a girl on the way home looked very symbolic to me. (On the other hand, being with Sukeroku does not interfere with Kiku's rakugo, rather encourages him more instead.)
>> ARTICLE
Tht masters a wierd guy. I thought he wanted Miyokichi to be with Kiku at the beginning. But now he has feelings for her too. Motherfucker already has a wife. Sorry i just hate people who cheat but i guess it was common back then
>> ARTICLE
Yes it was very common. A grandfather of mine was even worse, he didn't even hide his affairs and my grandmother was crying. Many Japanese men those days were not even ashamed of having mistresses, rather proud of being able to afford them like a status. (Some still are.)

These fuckers objectified women (and children), so he probably just kinda "rented" her to Kiku to play with her (you know what I mean) for his rakugo. For the master, Miyo is a pro girl no matter how much he has/had feelings for her. And notice how Miyo herself didn't mind the idea of being introduced to another man by her patron. 
>> ARTICLE
I seriously hate Miyo now even more. She is seriously gonna fuck up Kiku's life

Here's a couple thoughts i had while watching this episode. 

Firstly it's clear that the master doesn't disapprove of Kiku getting close to Miyokichi, it may even be the case that the master purposefully orchestrated their relationship in some way (maybe initially paying her to hang around Kiku). 

Secondly i believe that Miyokichi's feelings for Kiku have two foundations. The first being her attraction to him, an a-typical guy whose gentle and hard working. She is jealous of his relationship with Sukeroku and his dedication for his job over her. The second foundation is her current place in the world. To her Kiku presents an opportunity to get out of being a geisha. He earns good money and is a man who isn't driven by sexual desires. Her life would improve tremendously as his wife. This adds another layer to her dislike of Sukeroku and Kiku's relationship, their living together and closeness prevents her from advancing her relationship with and her goal of getting out of a better place in life. 

So when she sheds her tears it could be both for her love of Kiku unfulfilled and for her future crumbling around her. (Also why the fact it occurs when she is in her geisha attire is poignant)

>> ARTICLE
It didn't occur to me till this episode, but it seems like the incidence of Engrish is far below the norm for anime  possibly zero.  I have to assume that's historically accurate, and English loanwords didn't start happening in Japan till much later, maybe even after the 1970s framing time.  Can anyone confirm?
>> ARTICLE
It was "chic" to use French loanwords then, like "avec" to mean a couple, "rendez-vous" for secret meeting, "caf" for bars, "jupon(zubon)" and "pantalon" for pants, "bret" for Miyo's cap...etc. 
>> ARTICLE
Another episode that felt too short! I original thought Miyo was somewhat frisky but now I just feel bad for her. It's refreshing to see a show that has realistic relationships where someone's work can ruin them. You don't see too many anime that involve work related relationship tension.

Ok, we're getting full drama bois.

I loved the chapter. It seems things are going pretty nasty and yet the script was so subtle it's impossible not to ask for more. I felt really bad for Miyokichi though.
>> ARTICLE
In the next episode preview who is the girl Sukeroku with? It kinda looks like Miyo but at the same time it doesn't.

God I felt sorry for her. He's treating her really badly. :/
>> ARTICLE
I just noticed the narration from Future!Bon is now completely absent. It's like we've become gradually more immersed in the flashback.
>> ARTICLE
Now, this show had even more off-model/[not nicely drawn faces](http://i.imgur.com/aBo5xUs.jpg) than usual, but on the other hand, this episode's use of colours, lighting, and just beautiful moments was also higher than usual. [Especially in the scenes involving Miyokichi](http://imgur.com/a/cISfo), while and after her meeting with Bon in the street. So pretty!

So, some thematic plot discussion, right? That's what I'm here for after all (and yes, this post is going up late, because I had a headache that forced me to bed last night after 5 minutes of the episode, and then I woke up to it still being there... but you're not here for that, are you?).

Did you notice when Miyokichi really felt betrayed? After she told Bon that she doesn't want to upset him with her selfish demands, which is an opening for him to say she's not really bothering him, but instead, he just accepts it and walks away after she calls for a promise from him. Miyokichi is desperate, she's not putting on any masks, she's telling Bon that he's her choice, not someone she had to settle for, unlike the performance in last week's episode.

So, why is Bon acting this way? You'll note Bon has always been rather passive in his life, in how he accepts what's given to him, how he interacts with others. He went out with girls who were there, or who went for him, rather than choosing them himself. He goes with what Shin suggests. [Just last week he finally began truly giving his all to rakugo, and to his audience](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-episode-6-notes/), rather than expect they'll give him their love without him giving them his.

But here he is, taking Miyokichi's love, and not giving her his. Is it because he doesn't care for her, or because he's not sure what he wants? Well, he knows he wants rakugo now, so everyone else comes second. You'll notice how buoyed he was by the Master's words, finally he allowed himself to verbalize his agreement to Shin's fantasies, of seeing himself as a master, rather than a journeyman (futatsume). Finally he felt the acknowledgement of others and allowed himself to believe that he's progressing, and is worthy of it.

But in that meeting, there was also the question on his relationship with Miyokichi, where the Master appeared like a young and bashful child, and Bon is forced to consider how he feels about someone else. Forced to admit to the world how things are, and to himself. He's called on to make his own decision, rather than go with someone else's. And for all his scolding of Shin-chan, Bon is afraid of making decisions, of making his voice heard.

"[But if you're going to be lovesick, it better be for a beautiful woman](http://i.imgur.com/nirFmSv.jpg)." And Bon is the beautiful woman who holds Miyokichi's heart. And Bon is afraid of his fantasies. He's not sharing with anyone, because he's still afraid of being left behind. And so, he leaves others behind.

Am I the only one getting a Bromance feel from this episode?

I'm thinking its more of an actual romance.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, you can really feel the pain in how different Kiku is with Miyo and Sukeroku. Kiku, if you don't want to be Miyo's boyfriend FRIGGIN TELL HER, you pansy. I understand that this is set in a culture where you can't exactly just be friends with a chick but man is it frustrating to watch. Just have a talk with her and formally make her your beard so you can be besties and pine after Sukeroku. Though as unhappy as Miyo is with the affection Kiku gives Sukeroku, I can't tell if she would get some kind of reassurance if she had a "public eye" claim on Kiku and knew that he picked her as his beard because they were buds and he trusted her, or if she would just be further hurt by not being able to sever ties and move on. I absolutely love this show.
>> ARTICLE
But he does want to be her boyfriend. He also doesn't want to betray his master, and we've seen from his past trysts he's never been warm.
>> ARTICLE
lol... The people who question if Kiku's gay either don't have a best friend, or are dumb. Just because he wanted a feminine role in the past doesn't mean he's gay. Sorry if the world isn't that simple that a guy that wants to do girly things isn't gay.

In any case though, it's quite sad how things had to end with her... If it weren't for her being under his boss... It's almost like those gangster stories where a boss' right-hand man falls in love with the boss' daughter because she loved him. She's a very intelligent woman, so I'm sure she knows what the problem for this is. 

Still... I have to admit, it did always seemed one-sided in their love. But again, I have to keep in mind that he's always been worried about giving all of himself to her because of his master.
>> ARTICLE
Wanted a feminine role in the past, is confident and comfortable playing feminine roles now, is clearly disengaged when around a pretty lady, is 110% engaged when chilling with his best friend/ giving him dressing advice/ playfully touching him. Yep, he's the paragon of heterosexuality
>> ARTICLE
lol I don't know what you mean by "disengaged" but if you're saying "he can't stand being around women" then you're wrong. Go read some comments or something. 

As well, my point was feminine activities =/= gay. Of course, it's hard for the world to see that. 

And since you're that kind of person, I have to mention, I don't mean guys doing everything feminine aren't gay. I'm saying guys who take interest in some feminine activities aren't gay. Ie. Ballet. There have been guys that have taken ballet and still live a normal life.
>> ARTICLE
I think we also have to remember what genre this is in. It shouldn't be a giant surprise if kiku does explore his feelings about men at some point.
>> ARTICLE
I'm sorry... I'm looking at its genre and I don't know what you're talking about. Josei and drama. You don't see gay things in either that I know of. But in any case, Rakugo is under a REALISTIC setting. I'm at least 99% sure Kiku isn't going to become gay. I've seen the way they talk to each other, and unlike Korra, they aren't just going to suddenly get together. 

>> ARTICLE
Uh, josei as in "aimed at a mature female audience" which pretty much guarantees male homosexual undertone.

Also, you implying that a character being gay isn't realistic... Maybe you should have a look at real life which is outside your social circle for once?
>> ARTICLE
josei does not mean "mature female audience". Josei just means "female". And according to MAL, the shows that I found that were under "josei" were not for "mature female audience". They were for "females" in general. You really expect homosexuality in Chihayafuru or something? If you haven't watched that show, it's a very great show. The people who made that show made Ore Monogatari.

Also I'm implying the situation doesn't call for him to be gay by any means. The story, the setting, the timeline, the behaviour. You don't know me, so I don't know why you're judging me before you understand. I've worked with gay people before fyi.

Perhaps you should take your own advice.
>> ARTICLE
Uh, the word itself means just "female" but in terms of manga category it does run a little deeper than that. If it were exactly as you said,  I don't think we'd even have a genre called "shoujo". And I admit the hole in my argument: not all Josei works have BL element, but then again, Kumota-sensei has written a lot of BLs before. The undertone is pretty obvious.

And I really need to point out that why would we need a "situation" for him to be gay? Sexual orientation isn't exactly situational. Also, you made me judge you when you imply that being anything rather than heterosexual is not "normal" in another of your comments. Ya know, having worked with gay people doesn't really guarantee an absence of homophobic tendency so please don't pull that card.

P/s: I think I just noticed there was only me who kept arguing with you. Our viewpoints are just too different. I'm quitting this wwww
>> ARTICLE
Yeah you really need to go out more. 

Do I seriously need to word it differently? I have gay friends. I keep in contact with them. Why do you keep looking for other reasons to deny my arguments? In any case, you already lost when the 8th episode came out. I have so many more reasons I could've given too. 


>> ARTICLE
I keep seeing comments about the scene where his master asks Kiku about his relationship with Miyo and interpreting Kiku's reaction as him not wanting to betray his master because Miyo is his mistress, but I don't think that's what's going on at all. It was Yakumo who hooked them up in the first place. And the fact that he is asking about their relationship implies he actually wants them together. I don't know what to make of Kiku's reaction but I don't think it has anything to do with Yakumo's relationship with Miyo.

>> ARTICLE
Now that was a damn good episode. The climax is starting to take shape, major events are happening at last, and some major feelings are being revealed. We can finally make out how the story goes from the past to the "present" of the first episode.

Miyokichi's "see you in hell" line with the petals blowing in from the window was spine-tingling. As was Kiku and Sukeroku's "breakup" scene at the end, though that might have been helped a little by my fujoshi-tinted glasses. There was some especially beautiful animation and art in this episode too, even moreso than usual I think. All in all, it brought me right back to why I loved the show so much in the first place.
>> ARTICLE
Miyokichi's scene was simply beautiful. I can't believe that DEEN made this. 
>> ARTICLE
Well, you should. DEEN doesn't deserve the hate they get, they are just an average studio with an all over the place quality, not pure incompetence.
>> ARTICLE
> Miyokichi's "see you in hell" line with the petals blowing in from the window was spine-tingling.

Amen! That was excellent animation. And the ephemeral nature associated with cherry blossoms adds another layer of meaning, considering we know the tragic ending of Sukeroku and Miyokichi.

I agree that this episode hit it out of the ballpark. The only part I didn't like was the info-dump by the reporter, which could have been integrated more gracefully. But still, a 10/10 episode in my books.
>> ARTICLE
> the info-dump by the reporter

He didn't say anything we didn't already know.  He was just there to confirm the public taking the Master's side.
>> ARTICLE
It *was* how we learned that he had also been kicked out of the Rakugo Association and wasn't performing anywhere anymore. 
>> ARTICLE
Mmm, fair enough.  I just sort of assumed that would happen, I guess  no dojo, no membership.  Anyway, doesn't "info dump" imply a lot of info being dumped, not just a piece or two?
>> ARTICLE
I think it does usually apply to a large volume of info...there wasn't a lot here, but eh it just felt shoehorned in. I don't have a huge problem with it, but in a standout episode like this one, it sticks out.
>> ARTICLE
To me its the reporter's behaviour and how he was drawn, is he even from the same show?
>> ARTICLE
Some chars are like that, like Matsuda-san and Bansai master (from episode 8). 
>> ARTICLE
> The only part I didn't like was the info-dump by the reporter, which could have been integrated more gracefully

Even though I agree that it wasn't as graceful as it could have been as you said, I'm guessing it was only adapting the original manga faithfully to teach us the fall of Sukeroku as a rakugo-ka and his reputation among old masters.

As a non-fujoshi, I can confirm that their breakup was effectively spine-tingling.

Man the characters in this show are so well developed and I'm absolutely hooked on the narrative. It's really unlike any show I've seen before. I wonder if we're going to get back to the present and explore Yotarou some more before this show ends.
>> ARTICLE
From the preview [spoilers I guess](/s "it seems that Konatsu is introduced next episode, already a few years old, so maybe the last episode (or last couple?) will be in Yotarou time.")
>> ARTICLE
I would love to see two seasons of this show. The entire first season focusing on Yakuma's past, while the second could explore the present-day Yakuma and his relationship with Yotarou. 

Yakuma seeing little flashes of Sukeroku in Yotarou, who gradually develops his Rakugo throughout the season. S2 could end with Yotarou being named the new Yakuma by Kiku before he passes away, and agreeing to keep Rakugo alive forever. 

Deen take my money please. 
>> ARTICLE
> Deen take my money please.

Support them if you can, because Shouwa Genroku sales were unranked in the recent sales ranking. Which means it didn't sell at all. Such a shame, the show (imo) is even topping Erased to become my #1 AotS.
>> ARTICLE
>I would love to see two seasons of this show. The entire first season focusing on Yakuma's past, while the second could explore the present-day Yakuma and his relationship with Yotarou. 


I know it is kinda impossible because of the narrative and story. But that is a freaking awesome idea. Difference of two period. New entertainments and effects on rakugo. Effects of learning past on characters. Even thinking gives me animegasm.

>Deen take my money please. 

Where are we trowing the money?
>> ARTICLE
The new Yakumo? Fuck that, I'm envisioning it more of a "you're too good for that name, from now and on you'll be Sukeroku".
>> ARTICLE
[](#manly-tears)
>> ARTICLE
I find it insanely impressive how the show actually managed to make Miyo and Sukeroku a item in a beliavable way, both were at a really low point and just got together.

The fact that the master expelled Sukeroku for not following tradition is also something that feels real, conservationist wants things to stay the same forever, even if it means the dead of it. Why? Because changing it would mean destroying it for them. Sukeroku had the right idea with Rakugo, in my opinion.

The scene where Miyo tells Kiku that she will see him in hell is breath-taking, DEEN is really making this show as beautiful as possible.
>> ARTICLE
Its not going to be an easy relationship though; they didn't get together because of love(maybe even a bit of hate).
>> ARTICLE
During this episode I was reminded a couple of times of the rakugo where the old prostitute convinced her gullible customer to commit double suicide with her.
>> ARTICLE
Very true, that's probably why Miyokichi got so emotional during the performance it obviously reminded her that to a degree she is emotionally manipulating Kiku. The realization that she is leading the one she loves down a path of destruction really tore at her emotionally.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't Sukeroku and Kiku's relationship with Miyo also match the rakugo that Sukeroku did during his debut in this episode?
>> ARTICLE
Man this show ties everything so well together
>> ARTICLE
Do you remember what episode that was?

Edit: Nvm. Episode 6 second half.
>> ARTICLE
Checkmate.
>> ARTICLE
Ah the age old question... Is art something lofty and objective, or should it be aware of its audience and cater to their entertainment?

Expelling Sukeroku was going way too far for the sake of tradition if you ask me. With masters like that leading the charge for Rakugo, I think Sukeroku is onto something: Rakugo will die out as an entertainment form if things stay as they are. You have to be willing to adapt to please your audience or else you'll be edged out by other forms of entertainment that *do* cater to their audience. I think Kiku will realize that by the time the show ends, I'm just worried about what it's going to take for him to realize it. This show seems to be speeding towards heartbreak for everyone involved :/

As a side note, I'm finding myself looking forward to new episodes of this almost as much as the new Gintama episode each week. Deen *really* hit it out of the park with this show. 
>> ARTICLE
well the master was kinda drunk at the time, so maybe afterwards he couldnt bring himself to go apologise? Also the fact that sukeroku claims that the masters rakugo is boring despite the masters tremendous respect for the art is more than enough assurance
>> ARTICLE
It's too bad because just as both modern plays and classic plays can coexist I feel like traditional and modern rakugo could flourish.

Some of the best stand up comedians are just very good storytellers after all. 
>> ARTICLE
Yes, that's the problem, it's an issue of conformism. Art is best when it is exploring new boundaries. Whether people "get it" or not is a complex issue, but every artist needs to have a *relationship* with his or her audience, and dictating content without listening to their response seldom works. 
>> ARTICLE
This was an awesome episode and I agree with for the most part. The only thing I want to add is that I don't think Sukeroku's non-conformism got him expelled, though that played a part. I think it was him telling his master that his Rakugo was boring, a man who's already been shown to feel he can't live up to the previous Yakumo. Hearing his work was boring from Sukeroku, someone who he has raised and thinks is really talented, must have been such a slap in the face
>> ARTICLE
> I think Kiku will realize that by the time the show ends

He already realizes it, man.  Why do you think he loves watching Sukeroku perform so much?  Why do you think he values his way of Rakugo when all the old masters don't?  Why do you think they both made a pact to carry rakugo into the future?  Sukeroku does things Kiku wishes he could, but can't because he feels hemmed in by his own limitations and lack of god-given talent.  He continues to be a standard barer for traditions because it caters to his style of Rakugo, and because he's too afraid of losing approval of the establishment and thus losing his place in the world.  If Kiku thought he could do the things Sukeroku does, and wasn't so deathly afraid of being abandoned by the world again, he'd be blazing trails right along with Sukeroku.
>> ARTICLE
That's an interesting way of interpreting it.
>> ARTICLE
Even though this is said to be a parallel world of Rakugo Dystopia (showing rakugo is even more dead than it really is, for example, the 1st episode said only one rakugo theater left but that's not true in real world), there are many real historical events appeared in the show that you may want to note. Please allow me to point out. 

[Akasen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akasen)-Haishi/ or Removal of Red line district, or officially called /Anti-Prostitution Law, was established in 1956 and enforced by 1958 March. This is why O'ei san's geisha house where Miyo worked was shut down. So we can see that the story is now in somewhere between 1957-58. [GHQ(Americans)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander_for_the_Allied_Powers) had always wanted to ban prostitution along with horrible human trafficking going around, and demanded the ban in 1946 at first as a part of their democratization. 

Miyo is 5 yrs older than Sukeroku according to the show, we can imagine she is in her late 20s or possibly early 30s. Geisha generally *graduated* before or at 27 in the old days, so it's quite natural that she was being fired as geisha with this law being enforced. (You see the connection to the geisha woman, Osome, in Shinagawa Shinjuu rakugo story that Kiku has been playing, who was aging and had lost many of her customers. Osome in the rakugo story wanted to double suicide because she couldn't afford new kimono due to lack of customers and didn't want to die alone for her reputation, and quit suicide (after pushing Kin-san into water) when she learned that one of her customers brought her money. Osome and Miyokichi are different, but they both have something in common - settling for a convenient man to get out of their misery. I still love Miyo as a character and I can empathize her way of life, as a woman who could not think of her potential options, living in this era.) 

"Tennesee" jazz bar that we saw in previous episodes really existed in Ginza since 1953 as the first jazz bar with real bands playing music, first with jazz, later country and western and rock. Thanks to GHQ, Jazz was a big thing in 1950s in Japan. However, the major scene was soon replaced by Rock'n'Roll as you all are aware. Tennesee also soon started using rock/rockabilly musicians playing Presley instead of jazz musicians. Many of these jazz bars shut down some time by the end of 70s, though a place called "Tact" is still there in Ginza since 1958 trying to remember its showa history.

By the way, Hanakawado/ is in Asakusa, one of the best-known spots for sakura/cherry blossom in spring. Many of you may have heard of [Sumida river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumida_River) and Sumida Park, where Sukeroku and Miyo met in this episode with cherry flower petals flying around. 

(How many of you noticed that the journalist's VA is another veteran famous for Inuyasha, Ranma, and Shin'ichi in Detective Conan and so on? The rakugo Association president is also played by a veteran for King Bradley in FMA, Monkey D. Dragon in One piece, etc. It's incredible how this show can use so many veteran VAs that you could ever wish for!)
>> ARTICLE
Thanks to you I checked out Wikipedia and TIL prostitution is banned not only in Japan but in most of the United States.

That explains why in some US TV drama I watched there was a character arrested simply for being a prostitute. I was so surprised back then.

I'm sorry for my rambling but it comes to me as a massive culture shock, how any civilized country can convict anyone simply for being a prostitute. It seems so ridiculous  and so wrong to me.

I can see how this could come as a culture shock for a lot of people who aren't from America. Growing up in America I've gotten the other perspective that prostitution is seen as a dirty thing. 

I think it ultimately comes from the US's roots as a puritan nation and still has issues with the separation of church and state which puts a lot of religious influences into our laws. 

Prostitution is something that's better for the prostitutes when its legal because there can be better protection for them and less abuse from their "protectors". Its definitely something I could see maybe changing in the future
>> ARTICLE
> I've gotten the other perspective that prostitution is seen as a dirty thing. 

but it is seen as a dirty thing where I come from. But convicting someone for a *dirty* thing is taking it to a whole new level.
>> ARTICLE
As far as the talk of VAs are concerned, I really like the scenes of Miyokichi and Sukeroku together in this episode because they made it work. I guess for me, it was a reminder of the Spike Spiegel/Faye Valentine pairing of Cowboy Bebop who were voiced by Sukeroku and Miyokichi's VAs, respectively.

I guess this show casted mostly veterans and went with veteran top names on the main characters. I guess the casting director knew that the seiyuu would be a critical part of this anime.
>> ARTICLE
Right. One of the interviews said it was not about VAs being veterans or top names but rather about them knowing the Showa era and rakugo. Even the sound director is a veteran top name VA.

>> ARTICLE
No, it wasn't. It's kind of hard to explain it in short, but there have always been at least a couple existing in Tokyo, though some closed and some opened anew or reopened and so on. [Suzumoto Engeijou](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%88%B4%E6%9C%AC%E6%BC%94%E8%8A%B8%E5%A0%B4) (I think this place and another called [Honmoku-tei](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%AC%E7%89%A7%E4%BA%AD) are the model of the theater in this show) was built in 1857, burnt down from fire bombings at ww2 but rebuilt, [Asakusa Engei hall](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B5%85%E8%8D%89%E6%BC%94%E8%8A%B8%E3%83%9B%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB) since 1964, [Shinjuku Suehiro-tei](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E5%AE%BF%E6%9C%AB%E5%BB%A3%E4%BA%AD) since 1932, [Ikebukuro Engeijou](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B1%A0%E8%A2%8B%E6%BC%94%E8%8A%B8%E5%A0%B4) since 1951 are the major 4 rakugo theaters currently available. [Kokuritsu Engeijou](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E6%BC%94%E8%8A%B8%E5%A0%B4) opened in 1979, and there are a few run by [Nagatani Corporation](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B0%B8%E8%B0%B7%E5%95%86%E4%BA%8B) where certain rakugo families regularly play. 

There were a few drama in rakugo world which I believe inspired the original creator to make this story, although the real drama part in real life is mostly hidden and what we can see is just some tips of the iceberg, but I believe that also helped rakugo surviving to this day. 

[6th Sanyuutei Enshou](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E9%81%8A%E4%BA%AD%E5%9C%93%E7%94%9F_(6%E4%BB%A3%E7%9B%AE\)) was known to have been great at racy stories and well-known for Shinigami and others Kiku plays in the show, he went to Manchuria like 7th Yakumo, was the president of the association from 1965 to 72, and then planned a split(coup) which caused a huge chaos in rakugo world, ended up leaving the association alone and made a new association. Enshou's name is not given to anyone and that is another on-going drama. 

[7th Tatekawa Danshi](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AB%8B%E5%B7%9D%E8%AB%87%E5%BF%97) was another important guy who played a big role in this coup, and I think he was like Sukeroku, only he didn't meet Miyo and his rakugo survived even though he got expelled from the major association (he said he "left" it) and his nature was more cunning and cleverer than Sukeroku. He had both enthusiastic fans and haters (he was often very aggressive and offensive like Trump), and he started a TV rakugo show back in 60s, what we now call [Shouten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dten) that I still enjoy watching. The best story about Danshi: he once won an election and worked as a politician for one term of 6 yrs and caused some fusses. Back in 70s, at a press conference in Okinawa, a reporter asked him who was so drunk and fucked up, "What is more important, your work as a politician or sake?" and he replied "Sake, of course!". He didn't even show up for the meeting to explain the situation but went to play rakugo for his fans instead, and never ever apologized.

Miyokichi is one of the most beautiful women I've seen in anime in a long time.  I think we're on the same page, brother.

[Man..I feel awful for her](https://i.gyazo.com/be13136955530b9139c4d70d7aa83375.png) but I agree with what Kiku said. She has to become strong enough to be able to live on her own.

[That's unfair..](https://i.gyazo.com/68bd75cd6381a4d80c761854a07000d1.gif) Sukeroku is right, changing the system is the right thing to do (just think about what we have for entertainment now). People are afraid of change though. It's not until it comes into fruition that the hate is alleviated so I understand those old bastards being wary of Suke.

I love how complex the most brutally simple actions can be.

I love how insanely well presented each simple action comes off that it spirals out of control. I don't see a single character that has been developed having a truly simple nature.

This is some seriously good shit right here.

It's called art, I wish more people knew how to use it.

Wow.

Now that was a bit of a whirlwind. Gotta say I expected to be more upset at the Miyokichi and Sukeroku thing but I found it to be pretty well done. Miyo was once again impressive and from the preview we might see some Konatasu! 
>> ARTICLE
I'm late to the discussion (again!) But thought I would reply just for my sake.


I felt exactly the same where I thought I would be distraught with Miyo and Suke but somehow the dialogue was just so perfect that you could really understand the emotions and I just couldn't get mad at them. 


I'm still waiting for a Kiku emotional breakdown but this show is so good I don't even think it needs one to have an amazing ending.

10/10

Well it would be pretty powerful if we got to see it!

Yeah it was really well done. Im still not a fan of Miyokichi but goddamit I love Sukeroku. And love how Kiku prioritized his friends issue rather than worry bout how Sukeroku and Miyokichi are together.
>> ARTICLE
I shouldn't like Miyokichi but her character just seems in intriguing to me, she's very flawed and it just grabs my attention.
>> ARTICLE
Is Konatsu really Miyo's daughter? Because Konatsu has lighter hair than both Miyo and Sukeroku. Unless Konatsu dyed her hair or something. Interesting to see that Kiku wasn't fazed at all by Sukeroku telling Kiku that he was with Miyo, but had a big reaction to Sukeroku telling Kiku that he was gonna quit rakugo. Miyo asked what the audience is thinking with the "is Kiku even into girls?" I'm not even sure what Kiku's sexual preference is. Probably rakugo. Also interesting that when Sukeroku mentioned rakugo around Miyo, her eyes reacted to that. I'm guessing that what Miyo meant by telling Kiku that the next time he sees her, "he'll be in hell" was that Sukeroku's rakugo will be gone for good.

Wasn't there a red-haired kid at the end of the preview?

Japanese people all have black hair unless they're old. Any shades lighter than that is just anime hair being anime hair and/or dyed.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I thought when I first saw Konatsu, but everyone in the show seems to have either black or brown hair/realistic hair colors so I thought Sukeroku's wife/Konatsu's mom was a redhead, but I'm guessing that I'm probably wrong. It seems it's most likely that Konatsu's mom is Miyo.

Yuuuuuppp. If I had any doubts (and I didn't) this episode pretty much sealed the deal. Erased is a good thriller and all but this show is truly something else.

I enjoy both and I don't think they can be compared. They are different styles and genres. One layers complex relationships, the other is a brilliant play with tension that makes me hold onto my seat every week. These two are both my top shows this season.

You should watch [Joshiraku](https://vimeo.com/47352495) too.  It's not really *about* rakugo, but the setting and characters revolve around a rakugo theater.  Kind of.  A little.  At times.

Joshiraku is kinda tough to get into for the average anime watcher. The jokes and references in that anime can be too meta. If they can understand the jokes and references that Joshiraku dishes out, then it's a pretty good watch.

Yakumo: Are you going to destroy Rakugo?  
Sukeroku: Not destroy it, change it!  
Yakumo: They're the same thing!

Excellent scene there, really shows the dichotomy of their beliefs. Japan was going through some major socio-political changes at the time, and Japanese culture would either have to change along with it or get left behind. You can even see this in the earlier scene, where Kiku and Yakumo are wearing Western-style suits, and Sukeroku is still wearing a traditional kimono. Despite his fashion preferences, he recognises the need to change Rakugo to suit a modern audience, while Yakumo only knows the old way of doing things, and believes even the slightest change is tantamount to sacrilege. He's stuck in the past. I guess there's still hope though, considering Sukeroku and Kiku are the only rakugo performers of the new generation we actually know about, and they both know that Rakugo needs to change. If only they could work something out ...
>> ARTICLE
My god I just have to say this arc is turning out so well. There were nay sayers near the beginning saying that they wished it focused on the "present" but man if this thing gets another season focusing on Youtaru with parallels to this arc I think it will be top 10 material for me easily.

Beautiful, beautiful art today. I loved how they infused some symbolism with the cherry blossoms, which are beautiful but short-lived. Like Sukeroku and Miyokichi's relationship, considering their untimely deaths.

I loved the scene with Kikuhiko and his master where they discussed Sukeroku. When the master said that Kiku was his son (what a lovely gesture with the head rub) I was reminded of the parable of the prodigal son. In the story, when the son finally returns, his father forgave him and welcomed him. Kikuhiko tells Sukeroku (the symbolic prodigal son) that the master would take him back if he only apologized...but he never does.

Another great episode. This anime does a great job in not making any of the characters black and white or cartoony. They handled the break up between Kiku and Miyo and the subsequent union of Sukeroku and Miyo fantastically, you could really empathize with all parties involved. 

So I'm guessing that the inability to do rakugo leads Sukeroku to kill himself and as revenge Miyo tells her daughter that Kiku was responsible? Or does Kiku actually kill Sukeroku or perhaps even Miyo enraged that Sukeroku wont stop talking about rakugo?

Yeah me too, I am kind of leaning towards the Miyo enraged by the constant rakugo talk cause I can't really see Sukeroku killing himself either. I really looking forward to the upcoming episodes to find out how everything plays out. I might actually be more excited to see who the murder is in this anime than in Erased lol.

Easily a favorite. Not sure if it's going to be able to appeal to the masses though for it to make enough money for a second season.

>Not sure if it's going to be able to appeal to the masses though for it to make enough money for a second season.

I have bad news for you, sales were out last week and apparently Shouwa Genroku was unranked. Which means it didn't sell well at all, the sales were so low that they didn't even bother to count.

That sucks because Shouwa Genroku(for me) is definitely deserved to be #1 AotS and topping everything else (including Erased).

The anime BD/DVD released so far is the 1st episode only (80 mins long Director's cut version), and many fans already bought manga with the OVA DVDs last year, although some rich people may just go ahead and buy it again for the specials. (The 1st episode of anime aired is a condensed version of 2 OVA episodes.) 

> the sales were so low that they didn't even bother to count.

It is said 1561 for BD special limited edition only. It may have reached 2000 in total, but not revealed. I'm not sure how they are going to count Amazon Prime Video sales.
>> ARTICLE
I've noticed this kind of trend in anime where shows with really good and captivating story shows up that it's essentially an AOTS material but since it didn't appeal to the masses, it doesn't sell well. It's such a shame when this happens.

One past anime that I can say as an example is Shin Sekai Yori.

>> ARTICLE
All those pretty night-time shots. More than anything else, this reminded me of an episode of Uchouten Kazoku (The Eccentric Family), though the the two times the music flared up (07:40 and 21:10) also put me in mind of Monogatari and Kyousougiga. Not because it sounded or looked exactly like them, but the atmosphere evoked from the production as a whole put me in that mind.

Mirroring and masks, [the topic that was the focus of last week's write-up](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/2016/02/27/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-episode-8-masks-and-mirroring/) is still with us here. Sometimes the visuals make it very clear, [such as the sakura petals on Miyokichi's room's floor](http://i.imgur.com/dNqOjrS.jpg), which show how she's been longing for Bon, and how she didn't take care of herself as she waited, and [the same flowers after Shin was cast out](http://i.imgur.com/aGzEfVB.jpg). And we've had Miyokichi outright admit she changes her behaviour to fit the man, so who's the real Miyokichi?

There's a lot of other stuff going on, such as, I think the Master was going to give Shin the name, or at least tell him very gently off for not giving it to him, or not *yet*. He called him and started talking to him about *harmony*, of the need to work well with others. Which is what would be expected of him as a master, or what he'll need to prove before he can be given the name of Yakumo. Of course it's ironic that this talk is what led to the whole blow-up, seeing as last episode's final segment was all about how Shin understands the need for harmony enough that he made the pact that he did with Shin, that the two of them will together keep rakugo alive.

Speaking of that, as a small aside, that must scare Bon, who is now faced with the need to keep rakugo alive all on his own, both with his traditionalist style, and with Shin's "change", which explains why he turned to Konatsu and Yotaro at the end of episode 1. Also, what was Shin thinking? Master just told him how great it is that rakugo is built around traditions, and there he goes denigrating traditionalists.

But if we have to pick one scene that was the most important scene of the episode, then it's definitely the scene where Shin and Bon part ways. And in that scene, [we've had this line](http://i.imgur.com/c1YwJQy.jpg). Yes, it follows the "I always envied you," by Shin, where Bon always envied Shin, but look at *that* line, and do you recall how when the Master left with Shin during the war, Bon asked whether he's just a stray cat to him? Just as Bon saw himself as a stray cat, let loose when one moves on, Shin saw himself as a stray dog, let in out of pity.

Everyone has their problems, everyone thinks it's so good for everyone else. But we always see things from our perspectives. That Bon and Shin are performers who must place themselves in other people's shoes doesn't mean they actually understand the people closest to them, or that they even try, as they're so caught up with their own lives. "Don't talk as if you know everything, you don't even know my name!" Miyokichi told Bon, as if to say he doesn't *really* know her and where she's coming from, to which he very aptly replied, "Neither do you know mine." And that's human existence, in a nutshell.

Also, I always said Bon felt abandoned, and that's why he grew to "abandon" others. [Look at this moment](http://i.imgur.com/E4HGs89.jpg), the thing missing here is that Bon's *assumption* that others will eventually leave him is what shaped him into the person he is right now. And yet, when his "older brother", the person he shared most of his life and aspirations with is leaving him, [he can't take it](http://i.imgur.com/4mYGiLA.jpg).

Even the "[Whatever you do, don't give up on rakugo](http://i.imgur.com/UGMMZv0.jpg)," can be read in a couple of ways. As he said to the literature reporter, he's only happy about doing his rakugo, and Shin is even moreso, for Shin to leave Tokyo and stop doing rakugo shows the life went out of him. Didn't Shin say he'll play outside theatres if the masters won't let him? That doing rakugo is all he wants to do? And didn't he this episode say the audience is the true judge? And on the other hand, Bon and Shin agreed to part ways last week, and so long as each tries to keep rakugo alive, then they'd still be "together", in keeping up their pact. For Shin to stop doing rakugo would betray who he is, and leave Bon truly alone. He says he's used to it, but he's not, not to this degree.

Brilliant. Everything's coming to a head. Miyo's kinda sorta incredibly manipulative, but it doesn't feel forced or anything, which is good. We have a turn of events where Shin-san has become the envious one now that Kiku's developed. Great stuff, great stuff.

Holy feels!!! This episode was absolutely amazing, from the art scenery, the drama, and the perfectly timed music.

Definitely my favorite episode so far.

> Scrolling through the comments there is not even one saying negative things about this episode, would you look at that.

If it had the same number of viewers as Grimgar or Erased then you would see a lot more mixed comment's but Erased has even managed up to 1000 comments with basically zero negativity, especially in the first 3 episodes so Rakugo achieving similar with just over 100 comments isn't anything to write home about. 

This show does have its flaws, but with such a low viewership and with everything else being done so well your very unlikely to see them being brought up as much.
>> ARTICLE
> This show does have it's flaws

It's interesting. What do you mean?

>> ARTICLE
With what flaws the show has? Well every form of media has flaws, nothing is omnipotent when viewed by so many different people with different tastes and ideas of what is and isn't done well. 

For me it brought Kimiko in to the fray without enough development to get an understanding of their relationship, she just suddenly fell for him and I never really understood why. 

The first episode was also detrimental to the show overall in my eyes, it spent 40 minutes introducing someone as a main character then turning out he is not the focus of the story, and not even in the story from there on. This meant through episodes 2 and 3 I was confused as to whether that was the story or just a flashback, making focusing on the goings on a lot more difficult. 

I also found some the direction outside of Rakugo to be subpar, especially the scene where Yaku grabs Sukes lips to shut him up, the shot compostion didn't do a good job of framing the situation, making me question what had happened until the next cut. 

For me Boku Dake is still the show of the season, which itself has it's fair share of flaws, but whereas I feel Rakugo is consistently good with moments of greatness, Baku Dake is consistently great with moments of good or eh. 
>> ARTICLE
> For me it brought Kimiko in to the fray without enough development to get an understanding of their relationship, she just suddenly fell for him and I never really understood why. 

She fell for him, because he was nice and non-threatening, welcome change from everything she experienced before.

Oh, out of curiosity - so you are not one of those who are afraid that writers of Erased wrote themselves into a corner and that the show will have real difficulties with sticking a landing? (if you are a manga reader, don't spoil anything, please)
>> ARTICLE
> Oh, out of curiosity - so you are not one of those who are afraid that writers of Erased wrote themselves into a corner and that the show will have real difficulties with sticking a landing?

Well I read the manga to avoid being able to be spoiled (as I spoilt the ending to this season of Haikyuu! by being an idiot on Reddit ;_;). 

I wouldn't say they have wrote themselves into a corner, I was expecting the last episode to skip a lot of what it did and be much further on, so unless they move into OVA territory (which isn't out of the question, Steins;Gate pulled it off pretty well, and Kokoro Connect pretty much survived on it) then it's true they don't have enough time to adapt it all. 

But I don't judge a show based on one 20 minute period, when I have almost 3 hours of joy and emotion from a medium if they snuff up the ending the prior stuff isn't lost, the show takes a knock in my book and I just fall back on the manga but I will still say I enjoyed it but the ending let it down.

And most importantly I'm not going to judge something based on what may or may not happen, I can only judge on what I have seen. 

> She fell for him, because he was nice and non-threatening, welcome change from everything she experienced before.

For me I just didn't get that, it wasn't portrayed in a way that I got that reasoning, maybe upon further rewatch I would but in the moment it all just felt like plot convenience.

> For me I just didn't get that, it wasn't portrayed in a way that I got that reasoning, maybe upon further rewatch I would but in the moment it all just felt like plot convenience.

Miyo is explaining it in previous and this episode, it's Kiku's looks and his coldness. But I really don't see there needs to be a reason for falling in love with someone. If you must feel it like plot convenience, then I don't know what to say about Bokumachi plot... I love them both. 
>> ARTICLE
>For me Boku Dake is still the show of the season, which itself has it's fair share of flaws, but whereas I feel Rakugo is consistently good with moments of greatness, Baku Dake is consistently great with moments of good or eh.

For me Boku Dake is a very good/solid thriller, but nothing more. It isn't anything new in the thriller genre, but it does everything you expect in a thriller well. This isn't a knock against Boku Dake or anything, it is just my own personal reason on why I have Rakugo above Boku Dake. For me Rakugo is more than just a "period" piece. The characters, relationships, the music, the direction, art, everything just creates this rare experience you don't see much any more. Either way I'm very happy there are multiple top notch shows this season. 

EDIT: Just saw your reply above in regards to Boku Dake adapting the manga. It has already been confirmed the anime will end with the manga ending. 
>> ARTICLE
> EDIT: Just saw your reply above in regards to Boku Dake adapting the manga. It has already been confirmed the anime will end with the manga ending.

Yeah I know they will adapt the ending, I meant that they might either do an epilogue in OVA or just push the end of the story into OVA's; both are possible, as a means of adapting the end with more time. 

I'd say as the series has become so popular (not sure how popular it is in Japan but it got a spin off manga greenlit so it must have bumped up the sales somewhat) that it could allow the guys at A-1 to think about giving themselves more time to adapt the ending.

See for me Boku Dake is a great character piece, in fact there has been episodes where I forgot it was even a murder mystery, it's just so easy to get swept up in the characters performing their day to day. To be honest though, Rakugo just hasn't hit the right chord with me, unlike a lot of shows this season it still compels me to watch, but it hasn't got me completely invested, so I still look forward to KonoSuba and Grimgar more (and Haikyuu!, I will come in 4am stupidly drunk and still make sure to watch the latest episode). 
>> ARTICLE
I hope they are able to end it properly, cause it would be a shame if they aren't able to stick the landing.

I feel the exact opposite as you in regards to these two shows haha. I like and care about the characters in Boku Dake. I'm definitely rooting for them and hoping they succeeded, but it doesn't go much past that. I just personally haven't felt the story has given me much more to care about other than whether or not everyone will be ok (excluding the mom. I want her backstory SUPER badly). I also never saw the show as a mystery either. They paint/lay everything out pretty clearly, which is why I see it more as a thriller than a mystery. Thrillers don't try to hide things and you are still pretty tense and on edge. 

The characters in Rakugo are super flawed and complex, which make them much more compelling to me and why it is the character piece to me. 

Anyways this is the cool thing about media. Everyone can and will interpret things differently, everyone has their own views and tastes, and hopefully that leads to meaningful discussion haha.

I should probably watch Haikyuu. I haven't watched a sports show in a long time. Gah too many things to watch. Not enough time.

I feel this is so sorely forgotten about on Reddit, meaningful discussion takes deeper routes when there are two sides to the arguement. 

> I should probably watch Haikyuu.

Definitely, it was the first sports anime I watched ( well after Ping Pong the Animation but thats tough to really call a sports anime as it's more a character drama) and both got me playing Volleyball and reminded me why sometimes long running is a good thing. (it's very easy to get caught up and starting binging it though, my first watch I ended up watching season 1 in a just over a day).

Oh my God, I was so scared at the very end, I thought we would see it, you know, the murder. This was a very intense episode after all. Everything seems to point to a completely different type of death for both Sukeroku and Miyo, though. Next episode red-headed baby appears, aw yay.
>> ARTICLE
Man, I really don't want Miyokichi to turn into a tired old trope of a villain. My opinion of this anime will fall drastically if she's turned into an old female fatale or "Woman Scorned" trope, someone who is out for blood because she got rejected or something. 
I just love Miyokichi so much, she's one of the most interesting women characters this season. I just don't want her to fall in old misogynistic tropes that are usually  used by BL writers (even though this anime isn't BL, the artist did write mostly BL works prior to this) or some "Bros before Hoes" bullshit which tends to plague most anime with 2 male leads and 1 female lead.

 Character development is off the charts good. I teared up a bit... First time this season actually, and I love ERASED. 

My only gripe is that I find Miyo to be a pretty unsympathetic character, like she exists merely as a plot device (like an old school femme fatale) necessary to drive Sukeroku and Kiku apart.

personally I like her as a person. All the more she is (for now) not the moving spirit of the unraveling events and she went through some serious shit. 

IRL I'd have definitely have problems with Kiku, even though I understand him. But it's obviously all subjective.

The show is magnificent, that one at least is a hard fact :)
>> ARTICLE
>  I find Miyo to be a pretty unsympathetic character, like she exists merely as a plot device (like an old school femme fatale) necessary to drive Sukeroku and Kiku apart. 

b.. but she is not the reason Sukeroku and Kiku went apart. It's Kiku himself, Sukeroku's lack of conformity and the structure of society which drive them apart.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I get that. I should've said "necessary to drive Sukeroku and Kiku *further* apart". It just seems that Sukeroku moving to the country with her is really the nail in the coffin, no? Maybe I just find the sudden romance between Miyo and Sukeroku a little forced? 
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, I get that. I should've said "necessary to drive Sukeroku and Kiku further apart". 

but she is not even the force driving Sukeroku and Kiku *further* apart. I don't understand your complaints actually, she isn't *old school femme fatale* and for now she has very little in common with rift between them.

If it was like you're saying Rakugo would be on route to become another stupid romance soap opera, which for now fortunately it isn't. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm just saying her just throwing herself on Sukeroku and immediately whisking him away to the country (away from Kiku physically, hence driving them further apart) seems to be a little heavy-handed. 
>> ARTICLE
How so? They have so much in common. They are both a) expelled b) hurt by  societal system they might be not the most conforming participants of b) turned down by Kiku.

They felt down at the moment, they knew each other for a long time, Sukeroku clearly symphatized with her, and Miyo craves for relationship and fears of being left alone on this world (and contrary to what some people might claim IMO there is nothing wrong with that).

Their relationship is about as heavy-handed or forced as a real-life one.

And she didn't *immediately* whisk him away, you missed small in-episode time-skip. And she didn't *whisk* anyone, because it's up to his free will, if he wants to go or not. Blaming Miyo seems very wrong to me.

Additionally you are talking like Sukeroku-Kiku pairing is some exclusive relationship, written in stone, preserving of which should be the responsibility of other people. I don't get it. 
>> ARTICLE
> Maybe I just find the sudden romance between Miyo and Sukeroku a little forced?

I didn't see it that way. We've seen that Sukeroku had always shown a very slight reaction towards her or when hearing her name, like multiple times in the previous episodes. Imo, he had always had a crush on her, but she was the master's mistress for a while, and then she was with Kiku, so he never tried to get her. But now she is alone and sad and down, he couldn't leave her alone, especially when he is down and lost and need someone who would want him too. Now he is expelled that he doesn't have the audience who want him either. For Miyo, Sukeroku is the convenient single guy, like Kin-san illustrated in Shinagawa Shinjuu rakugo story. 
>> ARTICLE
> My only gripe is that I find Miyo to be a pretty unsympathetic character

I disagree.  We don't get her narrative perspective the same way we've been getting Kiku & Sukeroku's.  But her circumstances and neuroses are no less sympathetic.  You just have to like, practice some human empathy though to get her position.  You've got a woman who was brought over to a warzone, likely abused before abandoned, and then had to sell her body in order to survive.  She has no family, no friends, and when she comes back to the motherland she gets set up as, essentially, a glorified prostitute.  And when she finally finds the one guy who doesn't treat her like dirt or some disposable commodity, and dedicates her heart to him, he's too involved in his own world and abandons her too.  Like, every MC here, Kiku, Sukeroku, and Miyo have huge abandonment issues, but while the two men here largely got set up with decent lives and became successful artisans, she got set up to be a whore.  And getting abandoned one last time by Kiku at that time in their lives was probably the worst timing possible, since she'd not only gotten old enough that she's no longer unqualified for the only line of work she could do, but now the government are actively shuttering all the red light districts.

I feel for Miyo immensely.  She's had an absolutely rough lot in life.  And she thought she had something real going on with Kiku.  Remember, while we're watching, *years* pass in this show.  And after all that time she gets shoved aside yet again.  It's absolutely brutal and unfair.  Again, she's a woman, with no family, no skills, is beginning to lose her one asset - her looks, and in one of the more oppressively misogynistic societies in the 1950s.  She's got dealt a shit-hand in life.  I can't say I wouldn't be bitter and angry in her shoes.

I wouldn't say she serves no purpose either.  She remained in their lives for years for a reason.  Kiku leaned on her as a source of comfort and emotional support for a long-ass time.  If he didn't like her - and he professes he loved her - she would have been ignored and shoved aside a lot earlier.  She's there because people's lives are complicated and there are more to the MCs than just each other and their performances.  They affect other people with their lives and actions, and in turn get affected.
>> ARTICLE
Miyo is probably my favorite character in all of this and this situation is absolutely heartrending. I only wish we had more of her perspective/story fleshed out.
>> ARTICLE
Yo fuck the fucking 7th Yakumo. Sukeroku worked his ass off and is probably the most talented but to undermine just cause all you motherfuckers are pissed about how he acts. Just ruined his life. Kiku is still the boss, he is the only one who understands what right.

I just dont like Miyokichi. She thinks tht her only worth is selling herself to men. I dont mind Sukeroku being with her, after all he is quiet upset himself. FUCKING LOVED how Kiku could care less that his ex is together with his Best friend but fucking broke down when he realized his Best friend's whole life of work is just going to waste.

All in all, Sukeroku and Kiku are both fucking amazing characters 
>> ARTICLE
Her only worth IS selling herself to men. It's not the 21st century where you can take night classes at polytechnics if you wish to change your line of work. 

In this era, most trades are still taught through years of apprenticeships. In return for free labour, the teacher provides free food and shelter for the apprentice. Basically, living under one roof. Now, imagine 25 year old Miyokichi as an apprentice in any trade. Male tradespeople who wish to pick her up as an apprentice would get vetoed by their wives. Female tradespeople tend to have husbands and wouldn't be happy if a beautiful apprentice appears and lives with them either. In a misogynistic society where men think they can do whatever they want to any woman they find beautiful, her husband will make Miyo a mistress eventually. In a sense, her beauty means that she can never pick up another trade other than whoring herself.

It sucks to be her.
>> ARTICLE
Hey, the master have his pride too. Your student called your act shit, you react appropriately and expel that fucker. Why even have a student who thinks he's already better than you?
>> ARTICLE
It's one thing to not be his teacher anymore, that's cool. But the fucker expelled him from the association. Why do tht and ruin his life? Just cause he said his better than you while you both were drunk as fuck. Sukeroku was one of the more popular ones. The master was fucking envious and he is fucking egoistical. The fucker was also getting feels when Kiki was getting to close Miyo even tho the master himself has a wife. HELL EVEN WHEN THE WIFE DIED, MOTHER FUCKER WAS THINKING BOUT MIYO. I give him tht he raised the 2 kids but seriously he ruined a guys life who had nothing but Rakugo, just cause he said he was better than him. And at the end of the day, Sukeroku was just trying to save Rakugo anyways. 
>> ARTICLE
> But the fucker expelled him from the association.

I'll have to read manga to confirm, but I think the president of the association expelled him from the association, not 7th Yakumo. Sukeroku had had a bad reputation for long, but old masters all excused him only because he was 7th Yakumo's apprentice (saving Yakumo's face).

Uh I don't even care anymore for who did what. 

I'm just upset about the state of Sukeroku. Poor guy, I feel so bad for hin

I dont think I can love this show because I am a guy.
Youre right that was bait. But not really.
I UNDERSTAND the show. I understand the characters, the period is a little fuzzy but some rudimentary reading has somewhat contextualized it. I dont know Rakugo but I doubt that is a barrier to entry at all.
Something is stopping me from loving this show, that I like and think is really well made. I compare it to John Wick in that they are both great at capturing on screen the exact image they want transferred into your brain. You feel the emotions that the director wants you to feel. 
And yet I feel empty. There is a level of artifice in SGRJ that is also in JW. They are also both Real genre pieces. BL for SGRJ and Action/violence for JW. And I dont read BL novels or watch BL shows. Maybe I should be I dont. So I understand why some people can love this show. And I know that if I read 5 or 6 BL novels I would Love this show too the same way My Jean Claude van damn and Scott Adsik loving fiends LOVE JW. But I wont read BL novels. Because I am a straight dude. And that is OK. Not everything piece of media should be centered on me and my sensibilities.  

>> ARTICLE
I do not like this. I do not like this at all. This is bad.

Ugh, so much drama and feeling...and they all seem understandable if you look at the context. Everything flows so naturally, and yet in the worst direction it can take.

Honestly, I have a bit of a hate-love relationship with this series. My one gripe before watching the episode each week is always that it's just drama after drama after drama. It can start to get a bit tiring, especially now since it doesn't focus so much on showing actual rakugo recently. But then I watch the episode, and I'm hooked all the way to the end.

It's like a drama equivalent to Madoka's despair spiral.

This episode was pure perfection. The dialogue, the music, everything. Favorite one by far from an outstanding show.
>> ARTICLE
After last weeks episode I couldn't understand why Kiku was doing this to himself but this episode made it clear. 

He was faced with a tough choice and chose to go with Rakugo because that's what makes his life worth it for him even if he has to sacrifice his relationships with Miyokichi and Sukeroku.

The only problem is that with the foreshadowed relationship between Sukeroku and Miyokichi i think will make him realise what he gave up on but by then it will be too late.
>> ARTICLE
That's what I thought this episode was. Aside from the foreshadowed relationship between Sukeroku and Miyokichi, the only other thing that I wanna know it how Sukeroku died as well as Miyokichi death by [foreshadowed from Op mv](/s "drowning, probably suicide after Sukeroku decided to kill himself"). And what comes next to Kiku's life. Kiku's an odd human.
>> ARTICLE
Looking at [Miyokichi in yukata](http://i.imgur.com/77puthY.jpg) and [Konatsu](http://i.imgur.com/AR4dGOy.jpg) especially their eyes, i can definitely say they are related.
>> ARTICLE
The word I always think of when I watch this show is tasteful. It seems silly, considering how dramatic the characters are and how one is a geisha, but it's true.

I feel like this separation between the two guys doesn't make sense, won't they see each other all the time at the theater? Also why can't they hang out still, even if they don't live together? 

I suppose it is because Kiku like he mentions doesn't think he is improving while Sukeruku is there, he really does take his focus seriously. I don't think pushing all of these people out of his life is going to go as he plans.
>> ARTICLE
I think there's gonna come a point, whether in this season or between the past and present (ep. 1) where he realizes that even though he is now enjoying Rakugo, he can't abandon all of his ties and relationships and be happy with it alone. Maybe Sukeroku isn't good for him, and maybe casting Miyokichi aside is the only way to stop their relationship ruining his career, but I have to think he's wrong to cut all ties with everyone.
>> ARTICLE
>I feel like this separation between the two guys doesn't make sense

It makes perfect sense. They're basically brothers. They grew up living together and sleeping in the same room for most of their lives. They have a very codependent relationship. Hell, they basically need to cuddle with each other to get to sleep at night, and that's not normal for heterosexual adult men. And Kiku realizes that the thing he wants most in life is to get better at Rakugo, and that indulging in his relationships with Sukeroku and Miyokichi will just hold him back. Especially when he feels like he has to work his ass of to get better, versus Sukeroku's effortless style.
>> ARTICLE
Idk I see/saw Kiku's point of view but this episode kinda turned it around for me. I'm sure there's some weird logic behind his reasoning but the coldness towards Miyokichi is going a bit too far. Maybe he does love his craft more than he loves her, but if that's the case, he has been dragging it on way too long. Ignoring and not informing someone when you go on a trip is not the right way to go about a relationship. 

Probably not a surprise but my favorite character in this show is Miyokichi. She has her flaws but she everything from her grace to her personality is just so attractive. I don't have a clue what the future holds for her but I hope its nothing sad or disgraceful. 
>> ARTICLE
Considering the show's title, it's probably sad. But I'm with you, she might be the character I feel the most for. She probably has the purest motives at heart and she deserves better than Kiku abandoning her, even if he feels like it's the only thing he can do.
>> ARTICLE
You should pay attention to the opening...
>> ARTICLE
He had committed to end the relationship last episode. You see him go from relatively warm to ice cold after his master asks him to come along and then asks about his relationship with her as he was leaving. 

He was being an ass in the hopes she'd give up on him too. His coming out of the shadows here just gave him an easy excuse to end it. His words to her there were hollow as shown by his confession of loving her to Sukeroku, the one she was "cheating on him with", at Tennessee. He's being a jerk to make breaking the bond easier on him and to an extent her.


----

Miyokichi's voice is sex to my ears. But since the show started in the present, I'm not really looking forward to her plight.
>> ARTICLE
I'm going to write up what I saw in the talk between Kiku and Sukeroku(Shin/Hatsuta), inspired by some people mentioning BL.  
[Here is some screenshot tundranocaps posted](http://imgur.com/a/5gsgW) to show English lines, from which he says there are homosexual overtones, but what I see is friendship and rivalry, and Kiku's conflict.

1st to 3rd pic:

"When I'm with you, I have so much fun."  
    
"I see new things, I want to share everything with you."  
  
"I'd like to stay with you forever, listening to your rakugo."  
  
*It would be the easiest for me if I could always stay with you listening to your rakugo nearby.*  

This is about their friendship and job. Everything looks fun for Kiku when they are together, Sukeroku is indeed a funny guy to talk to, he does things Kiku would never do and always surprises him and often troubles him, but that's also fun for him. It's all lively experience that he can laugh at/out and that he had never experienced when he lived at Geisha house among geisha women before or when he was away due to the war. **Sukeroku shares many ideas and shows different pov on rakugo that are very new to Kiku, so he wants to share his with him too**. So it would go fun and easy to be with him listening to his rakugo, because he can easily learn new stuff around rakugo (not just technical) from talking to him.   

Let's see some examples, Sukeroku knew Kiku would do better with racy story or human drama and had told him before, which Kiku learned a lot later, after he did the kabuki play. Sukeroku knew why he wanted to do rakugo and asked Kiku why too which Kiku had never thought about before. So, Kiku started to ponder. When he learned that he was doing rakugo for himself, to make his own place, he started having fun doing rakugo. Sukeroku always talks about the future of rakugo which Kiku cannot hear from anyone else, not even from his own master nor any other masters at the theater. Kiku also tried to share his thoughts too, one example found in previous episode was about Sukeroku's woman in his rakugo being too dumb which degrades his rakugo quality. Kiku respects him as a colleague and a rival and a friend. This is what they want to share. 

(No pictures here, so I'm not sure how they are officially translated)  

K  
*K: "But if I go on like that, I can't face my own rakugo."*  
S  
*S: "Don't blame others (me) for what you can't do. You know you can't do rakugo when there are no others."*  
K  
*K: "I'm not you!" (meaning, "I don't do rakugo for others, unlike you" + "I don't have the gift you have".)*  
S  
*S: "Huh?"*   

4th and 5th pic:  

"You're always walking ahead, so you never see..."  
  
*(You were always walking ahead, so you didn't see me (suffering behind you), did you?)*  
"Just how much I suffer when I'm with you..."  
...  
*(You have no idea how much I suffered from having you around.)*  

Now this is rivalry. Kiku is now talking about rakugo talents, and probably it's his very first time showing his weakness to Sukeroku. How hard it had been for Kiku to see he didn't have the gift Sukeroku had. Sukeroku was always ahead in rakugo and his skills of making people laugh, attracing attentions, people always loved his rakugo without him doing any efforts but just playing around drinking, so he wouldn't understand how Kiku had a hard time trying to catch up with him as a rakugo-ka. Kiku is telling Sukeroku how much he envied him and how jealous he was. 

Sukeroku probably knew Kiku was having a hard time (apart from jealousy), he should be able to tell from the audience reactions anyways, but he never pushed him nor discouraged him, but rather watched him like a real brother and buddy, quietly encouraging him, always relaxing him, often trying to give not-pushy advice of getting away from practices. Now that Kiku is also showing success in his rakugo, and hearing this Kiku's talk, **Sukeroku decided to leave the apartment they were sharing**(He called it "ohiraki") and made that promise about rakugo with Kiku that has been haunting him in present - but I don't quite think Sukeroku actually wanted to, so the scene Sukeroku was walking alone by the train tracks, it really broke my heart. 
>> ARTICLE
I wish people would actually discuss when someone writes a lengthy comment rather than just downvote and move on.

I share your interpretation that what we're seeing is not a homosexual relationship. I do think their relationship is *too close*, in the sense that they have this weird codependency that's stunting their growth. Kiku pointed out that this relationship makes it hard to stay focused and improve, and we've been seeing Sukeroku rely on Kiku for basic things like money for ages. It's all very sad that they have to splitbup (as least for a while) after all they've done for each other, but that sort of separation is a part of life.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you, your post made me feel a lot better. I was about to determine that it was the translator's bias (especially this episode), but I now hope it just depends on who watches it. 

I wholeheartedly agree about their codependency part, and I guess it was about time, though still sad, knowing the direction this story heads to. It's not like they stopped talking or working together anyways, at least for now, unlike Miyo's case. 
>> ARTICLE
I can only get what I read on the English subs as well as the tone (voices, mannerisms) but I completely agree with what you wrote. This is exactly what I got from this episode and I am one of those people who were picking up on bl undertones at the start of the series (not because of the author's other works but mostly due to various mannerisms/glances/reactions from Kiku, as well as the designs). These last episodes, however, I realised that all those are just how he is and there was emphasis on all those and how he acted because that's what got his rakugo to "evolve" (for lack of a better word)...his rakugo is even starting to get defined by all those things and his performances and audience reactions have been showing that.

Just wanted to post to let you know. Also to thank you for the translation and explaining!
>> ARTICLE
Thank you! The BL vibes/undertones that people seem to feel might be rather some kind of estheticism in this show (and the original creator's past works ofc), or so I'd like to think. That said, tbh, I don't actually mind some people wanting to see BL or add that tone for themselves in this show. My problem, however, was rather multiple influential popular reviewers and writers labeling this show as BL, and I expect this subreddit to have enough dedicated anime fans to know better than simple labeling for convenience or whatever. 

But yeah, you're right, you can't really tell or judge anything from just watching the first several episodes. The original manga actually seem to tell more [how kiku was intimate with Miyo](http://i.imgur.com/NI60rxc.jpg) than [the same scene shown in anime](http://i.imgur.com/82nL76Y.png). (I've only seen bits of manga yet.)
>> ARTICLE
> might be rather some kind of estheticism in this show

It is. At least it looks like it but the charming/attractive/suggestive poses/reactions/glances are also quite often in a lot of josei works so that's why it feels ambiguous. I mean all those little things that aesthetically made me think there are bl undertones are also the little things that usually make you think a character is charming/attractive in some josei works (like Ristorante Paradiso for example). I think Kiku is a character that is left open for interpretation on purpose to some extent, not in order for the viewers to assume things about him because of what they want, but because he himself was even unsure about what he wants up till recently in the episodes. If the viewers aren't sure about what he feels exactly and all they do is assume, it makes his uncertainty and then when he figures out what he loves most even more impactful. Or I'm just putting too much thought into it...:P

Holy shit, Miyo looks plain in the manga. She doesn't have as sharp and elegant of features, at least from that page.

It's not BL, but it is BL bait. Samwise and Frodo got shit for their "whatever I'll say is now double entendre for butt buddies even though it was obviously two friends," and this show is much much more potent at baiting than LotR. It's targeted audience loves to bite that bait as well.

I personally have nothing against fans creating slash fiction as their *secondary interpretation* or parody. I'm not sure if it's trying to bait BL fans, but if they want to bite it, then that's their call.

I've always felt particularly sympathetic to Miyokichi. Man, Kiku was ice-cold to her. I'm looking forward to their scene next week, though I anticipate it will break my heart.

I like how the episode touched on the bitterness of remaining in the shadow of immense natural talent. I wish that theme had been explored further. To date, we've gotten a lot of Kiku being exasperated at Sukeroku's antics and a lot of friendship; it would have been interesting to have Kiku's turmoil peek out earlier.
>> ARTICLE
Kiku has been wallowing in self hate for being in Sukeroku's shadow the whole time we've been in flashback, and it seemed to be part of his resentment in the present. It wasn't until the play that he found light showing on himself, and even then he realized Sukeroku saw the **years** ago before he left to entertain the soldiers.

His exasperation at Sukeroku's antics is driven by his envy of Sukeroku's raw natural talent. Otherwise he probably wouldn't even associate with him.

You should watch previous episodes again looking for "bitterness of remaining in the shadow of immense natural talent" theme in all of the looks and muttered phrases. It wasn't just "this bum that leaches off of me" it has always been "this bum that leaches off me and goofs off and I can't even reach his ankles."
>> ARTICLE
I see what you're saying, and the pieces are all there in hindsight. I guess a rewatch would be helpful!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, nothing else has that much emotional impact this season for me compared to this show.

It's interesting to see how all these events play out considering we mostly know the outcome from the opening episode.
>> ARTICLE
Dang, Shin's career is looking up, suddenly.  And poor Miyo's getting dumped in the process.  :(
>> ARTICLE
Well, anime's most unconvincing relationship is finally over.  Kiku claims that he loves her?  He sure has a way of **not demonstrating it at all**.  She should seriously be much better of without him.

Too bad for the bromance being broken up as well though.
>> ARTICLE
Love isn't all about kisses or sex or even telling each other you love each other all the time. I'd consider Kiku's earlier relationship with Miyokichi very beautiful and quite intimate. I think what people have a hard time understanding is A) that Kiku even on his best days is not an outwardly emotional person and will often be formal or conventional rather than bare his soul or be blunt and B) that since a couple episodes ago Kiku is *intentionally* pushing Miyokichi away. He's being as cold as he possibly can and neglecting her as much as possible because he believes that between her occupation and the fact that she's involved with his master that things can't work out.

You can argue he's wrong and that love will persevere over circumstances, and that may be true, but that's not Kiku's personality. And to be honest he may value Rakugo over her now that he's come to love it passionately. Neither of those mean that he doesn't feel anything, or that he obviously doesn't love her. Maybe she deserves better, and maybe he should act differently, but you have to go a little deeper than the surface.
>> ARTICLE
Bit more than half way through and I will say that I find the actual rakugo aspect to be quite boring the majority of the time. But I really do end up liking a lot of the other stuff,  especially the human drama and a lot of the characters are quite interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
I believe it'd be a lot harder for most to actually enjoy rakugo aspect, and please don't blame yourself for it and I hope you continue enjoying the show. After all many Japanese don't get it. (And Miyo doesn't either and says "it's for old people"!) 

A modern rakugo-ka, Shiraku, once said, "Mania kills genres" quoting a pro-wrestling president. He explained that when maniac fans (or otaku) support a genre, any genre, too enthusiastically and wouldn't accept and bash outsider views, they kill the very genre they want to support by their own enthusiasm. 
>> ARTICLE
Bon was absolutely savage with the "What, you want to hit me? Put more resolve into it..."

Really felt for Miyokichi there. What do you guys think was the purpose of Shin's embrace? It felt like a "I can't help you with your problems but this is what I *can* do for you" sort-of-thing.
>> ARTICLE
It felt to me like a "he doesn't love you but I do" sort-of-thing.
>> ARTICLE
It might be, but considering what a womanizer he is I have a hard time trusting that he actually loves her. I think he cares, and I think he's attracted to her, so there's probably mixed motivation in that hug, but I didn't get the sense he's been pining after her in the background all this time.
>> ARTICLE
I don't think it's that, they don't really know each other well. It's obvious by their back and forth dialog that they both share the same frustrations with Kiku regarding their relationships with him. And after hearing her sob story, and then hearing his Rakugo origin story, it's pretty clear to me that Sukeroku empathizes with Miyokichi, takes pitty on her pain, and doesn't know how to react except to hug her.

I believe him when he says he doesn't know what he was doing, and I don't think he had any lust or suddenly fell in love with her. He just saw a lonely human being, bare her soul to him, and lament her loneliness while basically sobbing on the inside. My instant, gut reaction as viewer was that, "I wish I could give this character a hug and comfort her. She really deserves one."  And then Sukeroku just immediately went and did it.  He felt compassion and didn't really know how to handle the situation except to do that. I thought it was great but the timing was awful because she's going to think it affected Kiku, when that's not the case at all.

And really, I just want to hug all these characters. They're so great and yet they're so wounded and so desperately in need of some empathy and also some perspective. Kiku doesn't need to push his friends and loved ones away in order to find success, and his success doesn't define his value or place in the world. Sukeroku doesn't need to rebel against the establishment so hard or resent it for how it treated his idol/namesake. And Miyokichi needs some self respect and for someone to appreciate her for just how amazing she is. 

All of them just need giant hugs.  Hell, most people in anime need hugs; it was just kind of shocking to see one character hug another like that when they really needed comfort.
>> ARTICLE
He didn't seem to know why he hugged her, but, aside from reasonable possibilities that he might have some feelings for her himself, I think he empathised a lot with her and felt as if she really needed and deserved a hug. She'd just been saying some very sad, lonely things, so I think his heart went out to her.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was a response to Miyokichi talking about how alone she was. He probably wanted to do something to show her he cared about her even if it felt like no one else did.

It's pretty slow but once you get into it time goes by in a flash. I love the voice acting/charcters here and how calm this show makes me(despite the conflicts). I guess the best way to describe it would be something like listening to a storyteller, that's the vibe it gives me. 
>> ARTICLE
I just realised something about myself because of this anime, this episode in particular. I realised that I love good, well developed characters. Of course everyone does but to me that aspect of storytelling is what I love the most.

And man do I love the characters in this anime, to write why would take me too long so that's all I'm gonna say for now.

**Post-Episode Write-up:**

How could this episode have only been 21 minutes long (sans OP/ED)? It felt as if I've watched 4-5 episodes' worth of material, with how much was covered, as the episode was split into several segments, each mirroring with other parts of the show, and the characters kept reflecting and contrasting, swirling by one another as the episode kept weaving about them, and as the story wove about us. So let's get to it, bit by bit. Though it might get messy at times, because you can't speak of one without the other, of the future without the past, can you now?

The episode opens with what this show is best at, [setting up a feeling of a time and place](http://imgur.com/a/R5o8S). It's a beautiful sunny day. A great day to spend outdoors. Bon doesn't like the sun much, so it might be all fine and good for him to spend the day indoors, with his rakugo, but for all those other people? That's quite a sacrifice, spending this lovely day, watching him. Watching *his* rakugo. A nice day for a social outing. A nice day for some culture.

Speaking of "culture", there's no culture quite like corporate culture, is there? You can't promote one of a pair without also promoting the other, so the easy-sell Bon might not advance because his master's other disciple is too much of a headache for his master to be able to push them through? But this isn't actually the true focus of this scene, as is a continuation of a specific moment from last week, and further sign of things to come, in more ways than one.

[Here's the master](http://i.imgur.com/FNzCgoZ.jpg) speaking [to an old friend](http://i.imgur.com/IN4Z7ks.jpg). Even the master is just a man, who had his time of youth. And if you notice how he looks while speaking to him about the bureaucracy and the kickback he's getting from the elders, his body is slumped. [He looks tired](http://i.imgur.com/d8pYaGn.jpg) and [defeated](http://i.imgur.com/Ua4Kus9.jpg). The [master is not all powerful](http://i.imgur.com/T80CAU5.jpg), he still has to answer to others and to contend with their wills. [And to connect it to last week](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/episodic-observations/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-episodic-notes/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-episode-7-notes/), when the master asked Bon about his relationship with Miyokichi, [he certainly looked bashful](http://i.imgur.com/QAZ7o1x.jpg), not imposing, not like an authority figure.

Also, before we move on, this small scene between Master Yakumo and Master Bonsai had shown something else that last episode was really good about - the whole interaction, especially how the whole exchange is bracketed between "[Why the long face](http://i.imgur.com/amCJovk.jpg)" and "[Oh, your face grew even longe](http://i.imgur.com/9EFt7hs.jpg)r" is really fun, because the interactions in this show are framed as if they were part of a rakugo performance themselves.

And that took us to the train ride back home. On one hand, here is Bon, finally verbalizing his wishes. But as always, it's about duty. If before he *had* to do rakugo to survive, here he has to do rakugo to pay back the master, and the older disciples, and everyone else for everything they've given him. Before he was forced to do it to not starve, and now he's forced to do it for the sake of his honour. But is it true? I'm not sold on it. You see, Bon sounds as he always have, as if he's doing it for others, but he can't fool us, since we know he now wants to do rakugo, *wants* it, because he finds joy in it.

More than joy, remember how Shin-chan always speaks of his plans for rakugo, for the two of them, and Bon's place in them as well, and how bon always sat passive as he listened, until late last episode he smiled at it? Because he can finally believe he too has room in this vision, that he too can *shape* this vision. Shape rakugo's place in the world to come. At the very least, he can finally control the shape his own life will take, by his own will. So Bon is dreaming. And dreaming is indeed the right word, for he thinks that if only he'll become a Shin'Uchi, he could do it all. Pay everyone back. Control his life. Do rakugo as he wishes. But the entirety of the master's role in this episode, from start to finish, is to show that there's always someone else you must answer to, always something more holding you back. And this is also the death of the capitalist dream, "If only I'll have X then I'll be happy!" But there's always another X, always someone else. Unless you're comfortable with how things are, as Shin's mask presents him as.

Ah, masks and mirrors, the best place to speak of how characters reflect one another, how they contrast. And not just here, but across time and storylines as well. [With the sweat](http://i.imgur.com/77Arl6s.jpg) and [the story of the burglar](http://i.imgur.com/svomYIF.jpg), Shin has never been more like Yotaro than he is here. This matters later because Bon accepts the fact that if rakugo is to survive, it will have to change, which is what he tells Yotaro and Konatsu as he begins telling them the story, that they'll have to keep rakugo alive, and thus Yotaro must find his own rakugo - something the formalist Bon dislikes, but that line to Yotaro is the proof that he's accepted the truth of Shin-chan's words. And in the present, rakugo is indeed a dying artform, so it's hard to not accept it.

Further on the reflection, a tiny line by Shin rings ironic, [as he says women are likely to not get rakugo](http://i.imgur.com/pKBrWWK.jpg). Yes, he doesn't mean it, but it's so very ironic when his daughter gets rakugo more than anyone else, but is barred from following it. Cutting to the other female figure of the story, Miyokichi tells us "And then I met master Yakumo and my new life began. I never want to be alone again." And that's Bon's life-story, where he was taken out of his old life, deposited with Yakumo, and his new life began. And though he might act otherwise, and he definitely *says* differently later on in the episode, Bon's life is all about how he always felt left behind, alone, and how he hated it ([This was the focus of episode 3](https://geekorner.wordpress.com/shouwa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-episode-3-notes/)). So here they are, a geisha, and a boy who trained to be a geisha, whisked to a new life by Master Yakumo, and afraid of being alone. I think Bon's trying to deal with it by abandoning others, or not letting them come close, before they could hurt him.

There's also the obvious mirroring of Shin and Miyokichi, which the show makes clear on its own, how they're both cast aside by Bon, and how they both try to reach for him, to be met by his cold visage. But, remember how I said Shin's mask portrayed him as happy with how things are? Him trying to hug Miyokichi, is this his regular "make everyone happy", or perhaps a sign that he wants something more in life, such as the life Bon is apparently aiming for?

Their talk, of splitting the world of rakugo, was nice. It's cutting through the gordian knot - how could they keep competing with one another, without stepping over one another's toes? By each going a different route, with the same goal, and have both routes be complementary. So one will aim for traditional and unchanging rakugo (though as old Bon had realized, there's no such thing - every performer must make rakugo his own, or the audience will not care for it, and it will die out), and the other will try new things, new routes, so new audiences could be found. There'll be a competition, to see whose rakugo does better, but even as they compete, they will know that the other's work is just as instrumental for the survival of their beloved artform, and thus, for their own joy.

Speaking of mirroring, just as Bon opened this episode by allowing himself to dream, as Shin has done up to now, the episode nears its end with Shin finally confiding in Bon, his own fears, of dying penniless, without joy. And he, just as Miyokichi and Bon, was saved by a rakugo master, who's given him a new lease on life.

But the episode ends with the cruelest unmasking, and a sign of things to come. The master is now a weary man, who's speaking to his ancestors. Bon said he's casting aside his love because he doesn't wish to have regrets, that he might not get to do rakugo to its outmost, but what about the fact he might end up regretting not being with Miyokichi? And here is the master alone - doing what he can to carry on his ancestors' legacy, a *burden*. The master has given these kids a new life, but at what cost?

> "So let's call it our breakup." Yup, homosexual overtones, and I wish this moment was better drawn.

Wait, wait, wait?! How is that giving you homosexual overtones? They only decided to stop sharing the apartment from now on because Kiku said he wanted to live alone.

> Shin-chan is already what he wants to be, the 2nd generation Sukeroku, rather than the next generation Yakumo.

Possibly another lost in translation case? He said he desperately wants Yakumo name. He wanted 1st Sukeroku to be Yakumo, but he died after taking care of him. Now he is 2nd Sukeroku, so him being Yakumo means Sukeroku taking Yakumo name - that also means for him to repay the kindness of 1st Sukeroku. And since he thinks he is sure to obtain Yakumo name, he gave the Sukeroku fan (name) to Kiku and Kiku joked about being the 3rd Sukeroku because 2nd Sukeroku would become 8th Yakumo. The next generation Yakumo (8-daime) is what Shin/Hatsu/2nd Sukeroku has to become more than anything, and he wouldn't even give it to Kiku, as he said in the previous episode directly to Kiku. And Kiku doesn't care about being Yakumo as long as he can play rakugo, and agrees that Shin/Hatsu/2nd Sukeroku should become the next Yakumo.

1. Has to be read with the screenshots I didn't share and the couple of lines before. You don't have to agree. But, [here are the relevant screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/5gsgW), so yeah, homosexual relationship overtones? I definitely think it fits. The mangaka wrote nothing but BL aside from Rakugo Shinju, so it's not a stretch. I think you have to actively *choose* to not see it.

2. These notes are taken as I watch. You're referring to the lines that followed, which explain a thought I had before them. So it's a bit anachronistic ;-)
>> ARTICLE
Ehhh, I think people should forget about the original creator's past work on BL for this show, but that's my opinion. I can't stop people from wanting to see something they want to see anyways. I don't have to *choose* to not see it, but it may be also because I watch it in Japanese and don't read English translation. (I do read some good BL comics in case you are wondering.) ...I personally have a hard time understanding why some people would rather try to see BL instead of friendship and rivalry in this story here.
>> ARTICLE
> Also because Shin has no future in rakugo,

What? They promised that Yakumo would be responsible for keeping the essence of rakugo, while Shin is responsible for *changing* it. He was going on for about three minutes about how rakugo should change along with people's taste, but also keep some elements to it. He *was* looking towards the future >.>
>> ARTICLE
These notes are taken *as I watch*, you're discussing point 5.3 with the information we find out in 5.9. So, yeah, an anachronistic reading is easy. You're basically coming to someone midway through the episode with what you learn at its end.

It helps to read it all, and see in what light it's written. I also explained that in my reply to the other comment, which was made prior >.>
>> ARTICLE
Due to character-limit (the above is way longer than I thought it'd be...), here are my "As I watched notes" for the episode.

**Thoughts and Notes:**

**1) Corporate Politics:**

1. The show opens again by setting a sense of time and place - a beautiful day. Too beautiful for Bon to be holed up inside rather than enjoying it, but it also goes to show - all these other people who would rather watch him (and the Master), rather than enjoy it.

1. "Yakumo-chan, there you are!" We all have childhood friends, from before we became masters. Goes just like last episode where the Master looked abashed at Bon. As Bon gains mastery, the distance between him and the master, as *people*, shrinks.

1. "You must forget he's a man from time to time." Lewd :P But also speaks of his strengths as a performer.

1. Politics! So, why can't Bon advance? And the Master did say he thinks of him as a son or something.

1. "Speaking of which, how is your other hilarious futatsume doing?" - "now that's a quagmire." Again like last episode, the normal discussions are also framed like rakugo performances. Especially with "Your face got long" and "Your face just got longer."

1. And silly Bon, you can just change the names any way you wish, unless they have story importance.

**2) Bon's Externalized Desires:**

1. Bon actually voicing a desire, a desire to do Rakugo, and move forward. But it also fits the daydreams that Shin voiced, and he listened to and bought into.

1. Heh. Bon, still thinking in terms of debts owed, but also of how he's part of the rakugo world. He's dreaming though, no one can do it all. But the desire is important.

 It's also the capitalist dream, thinking once you achieve X, you'll have nothing left to achieve, and could be happy.

1. Ah, so the problem is getting Bon to advance without Shin. Does the master not want it, or there are political issues, where Shin being struck down could also strike Bon down?

1. And here it is, there's always someone above you. Even to the Master. Look how defeated the Master's body-language is.

1. It's not about popularity (of a waning artform, but it's currently booming again), or even about skill - it's about being liked. Shin is liked by the audiences, but not by the gate-keepers. So no wonder he wants to raise his own performances.

**3) A Summertime Story:**

1. Here it is, a story about burglars, where Sukeroku is the most like Yotaro.

 "Sheesh, I can't tell who's the burglar here!" and him licking the sweat.

1. The heat, the bells - it's "the same time, elsewhere," still in the heat, but Shin and Miyokichi are night creatures, to Master and Bon's daytime activities.

1. 0813 - sometimes the small things really stick out, Miyokichi's eyes focus on where Shin is before he leans forward and down, but her static head/eyes don't follow him as he does.

1. Right, Miyokichi keeps being put behind rakugo, so that's the last thing she wants to be reminded of.

1. The drink stands between those two. Not a good way to keep distance, eh? :P

1. "It figures, a woman wouldn't get it," says the one whose daughter wishes to do rakugo more than anything else.

1. Those two share so much, the love and anger for Bon, heh. And I thought Miyokichi was the one supposed to vent.

1. "Men are like that, but I'm stupid, so I like it. It's nice guys like you I can't stand." GAH. I have a feeling I'll see this scene in webm/screenshots a lot in the future.

1. And then she looked at him from the corner of her eye and he gulped down the alcohol, lubing up his courage?

1. "Then I met Yakumo-sensei and my new life began. I never want to be alone again." It's mirroring Bon.

**4) A Story of Distance:**

1. The dramatic music hanging in the background springs in as Shin embraces Miyokichi.

1. Bon, face half in shadow, just as he was hanging back.

1. Him not getting angry and just stepping back means he's not invested, and that he's given up.

1. So, he's being a man, acting as if he doesn't care. He plans to break up with her even though he loves her? Why Bon, why? :<

1. So, he'll leave her because of an image, because the master told him? He really will put the job ahead of everything, as she said.

1. "I don't want to be with her that badly," meaning so badly he won't be able to do rakugo. So, he lets the master dictate his life.

1. "Yes, I don't want to regret it." But I bet he did, for not trying for both.

1. "But I don't want to marry anyone. I want to be alone." The opposite of Miyokichi.

1. And now Shin hears the big thing, "alone" obviously means without him either.

**5) For the Future:**

1. I'd like to say this scene has homosexual undertones, but they're not _under_tones, are they?

1. And very important, "I can't outgrow and defeat you while around you" contrasted with "You can't do Rakugo without people." Also without heart.

1. "You're always ahead, so you never see just how much I suffer when I'm with you" So he's also separating from Shin, though it hurts, just like with Miyokichi. Also because Shin has no future in rakugo, it'd seem. Also, here Bon is mirroring Miyokichi's unvoiced feelings.

1. "There's no reason we have to be together." Dun dun duuun.

 "So let's call it our breakup." Yup, homosexual overtones, and I wish this moment was better drawn.

1. Of course, the master is a rakugo performer, and so is Bon, so each can call to mind what others say with ease.

1. Shin, doing rakugo cause he loves it, no future of rakugo, no paying back others. Just for the love of it, more contrasting. But so does Bon, even if he won't admit it?

1. A relic. Shin-chan sees that if rakugo won't change, it'd die out. As old Yokumo said in the present, that those two need to save the art form and keep it alive.

1. Bon is a formalist, rakugo as it always is. Shin-chan wants it to stay rakugo even as it changes. That's also the deal with Yotaro, doing rakugo that isn't Bon's, but also shouldn't be Shin's, for it to survive. And this is part of why Bon had issues with him.

1. And so, splitting it. One will maintain, one will create new. And so the line of demarcation and contest is drawn, but also no contest, since each aims in a different direction.

**6) For the Past:**

1. Shin-chan is already what he wants to be, the 2nd generation Sukeroku, rather than the next generation Yakumo.

1. Ah, so it really is an off-shoot branch of the Yakumos, heh. A Yurakutei.

1. Shin-chan, for the first time, sharing he was sometimes unsure and scared as well.

1. "And most importantly, they're popular." So they can't be spoken against, especially as they want to keep rakugo alive.

1. "I've put myself through so much to carry on the legacy." Like Bon, duty to those who came before, and sacrifice.

 And even the master feels he didn't accomplish everything. That's the reality of life.

1. I thought we'd see a mention of the first Sukeroku in the family ledger, awww.

1. In the end he still smiles and needs reminders of Shin.

"Kawa, Taredoki ()" by Kana Shibue () - from MAL.

For some borderline useless trivia, the name comes from , ka wa tare doki, which refers to the period of time around dawn when it's so dim you can't tell who people are (you say , kare wa dare ka, or "who's that?").
>> ARTICLE
You've got to feel bad for Miyo, she'll never be as important to Kiku as his Rakugo. He probably is doing the right thing by cutting her off now, but still it's harsh. Though I'm not sure Sukeroku feels the same way about his?

Also I'm getting major Ophelia from Hamlet vibes from the shot of Miyo in the OP.

A side question: When Kiku was performing the Rakugo at the beginning and the subs were full of thou and thee. Was he speaking in an old fashioned form of Japanese?
>> ARTICLE
It's from KouyaTakao, he was mimicking the way the highest rank geisha talked. 
>> ARTICLE
See I don't think it's the right thing at all. He loves her, and he says how the happiest he is, is when he's hanging out with Sukeroku as well. But he pushes them both away implying that he fears they will just be a distraction to his struggle to improve his craft and to advance in the Rakugo world.

But then that should lead you to ask, why is Rakugo more important than being with the people in your life you love the most?  And the implicit answer is that he feels Rakugo gives him a place in the world and that his value as a human being is tied to it. As a child, we see that he lost his place in the world when his injury kept him from his dance training, and he was cruely dumped from his home because of it. He would be all alone and abandoned in the world if it weren't because of Rakugo. The only times he loves to do Rakugo initially is because it gives him a connection to his absent defacto brother Sukeroku while he's away. Later, he grows to love performing, not because he altruistically enjoys entertaining like Sukeroku does, but because he becomes addicted to the thrill of being desired and adored by the audience.

Rakugo gives him a place in life, and gives him the validation he'd been seeking since being abandoned as a child. He's afraid of losing that and thus his value as a person, but doesn't seem to realize that he can find his own place in life and derive value from the adoration of loved ones. He also goes over the deep end and cuts his loved ones out of his life for fear that they're a distraction, but doesn't seem to realize that he'd been drawing strength from them this entire time as well, and that their presence and time need not be a distraction either. And while he says he fears expulsion, he should also know that if Sukeroku's exploits haven't gotten him expelled yet, then his master won't deny him for loving the person he loves while being an undeniable talent in a generation bereft of talent.

Also to answe your question: pretty much all Rakugo are plays written like, 300-400 years ago. There's a major theme that Sukeroku talks about, about how Rakugo is stagnant and for good reason - because it's all about stories from long long ago, written in more archaic Japanese, about scenarios that most people nowadays can't relate to or easily understand. So yeah, he was speaking more old fashioned because Rakugo in general is extremely old fashioned. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow your comment gave me a new perspective on Kiku.
>> ARTICLE
This was a really dense episode. So much was packed into it, that I'll probably have to watch it again, because I know I missed some important stuff.

I thought it was interesting that Kiku admitted that he considers his relationship with Miyo to be the "lie of his life." He still claims to love her though. But, is that also a lie? Or does he only love and care about her in a friendly way? 

I was prepared for the worst when the cheesy music swelled when Kiku caught Sukeroku and Miyo embracing, but Kiku very quickly turned that from a cheesy scene into a meaningful one. The characters actually TALKED to each other (instead of storming away and being childish about it), and Kiku admitted that he couldn't even pretend to care, because he was planning to dump Miyo anyway. 

Sukeroku really seems like he can do no wrong in Kiku's eyes. You still feel like Kiku is magnetically drawn to him throughout this episode. At this point, I question Kiku's reasoning for wanting to be separated from Sukeroku. He says it's because his rakugo can't compete when he's always under that immense shadow, but I think, at least subconsciously, he realizes that he's in love with him, and doesn't want to act on it and possibly ruin everything. That scene in the street, where Sukeroku is explaining the story behind his lucky charm fan, and Kiku keeps getting closer to him, and staring at him intently... again, I still don't know for sure if that's romantic attraction, or just wanting to get one last gulp of Sukeroku's "rakugo" before splitting off on his own. It's really hard to tell.

It's pretty impressive that I still don't know how this series is going to end. We have a basic outline, but I have no idea what specific events are going to lead to the inevitable conclusion. I'm prepared for something really emotionally powerful.
>> ARTICLE
This episode felt insanely short, it just captures me in so much.

While Miyokichi moment was really sad, I was somehow sadder for Sukeroku saying goodbye in his goofy way to Kiku. They have been together for so long...

As in the comment from /u/HadesAmbrosia I'm also thinking there's going to be a double suicide with Sukeroku and Miyo. But some important things have to happen first, not for nothing does Konatsu blamed Kiku back on the first episode.
>> ARTICLE
> I was somehow sadder for Sukeroku saying goodbye in his goofy way to Kiku. They have been together for so long...

Yeah, me too. The way Sukeroku walked alone broke my heart. Sukeroku is such a great guy but often women don't fall in love with this type of guy for being "too" nice. 
>> ARTICLE
After reading last week's thread it got me thinking about how Sukeroku died. With us seeing how Kiku's relationship with Miyokichi is ending and the interaction she had with Sukeroku, there is a possibility that she might end up with him since he seemed sympathetic towards how she was treated throughout her life and wanted to console her in a way. 

What really got me thinking was this comment from last week's thread, 
> I have a feeling there will be a double suicide, especially since Miyo reacted so strongly at that part of Kiku's rakugo before. - /u/Eijink

Other than her reacting strongly, this rakugo, 'Double Suicide', was the one where Kiku found a reason why he does rakugo. It holds significant meaning, because it showed him his own style of rakugo, one that separates him from Sukeroku. The biggest clue that hints towards this theory is the [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_UxWeBT1BY). I've been listening to it for quite some time, but it never dawned on me as to what it might mean in english. To my surprise its: "Double Suicide". 
>> ARTICLE
> The biggest clue that hints towards this theory is the OP. I've been listening to it for quite some time, but it never dawned on me as to what it might mean in english. To my surprise its: "Double Suicide".

I mean, there's also the fact that the title of the anime means "Showa-Genroku Rakugo Double Suicide".

But yeah, I think it's highly likely Sukeroku and Miyokichi die this way. I'd have to go back and rewatch the first episode for Yakumo's flashbacks to get a better picture, though.
>> ARTICLE
It doesn't mean Double Suicide, it means 'Lover's Suicide Through Rakugo'. Up until recently the title didn't mean much since we didn't know much, and a lover could only have been Miyokichi. The thought of it being a double suicide was when we first saw Kiku doing the rakugo.
>> ARTICLE
Okay see, this word  refers to double suicide, specifically multiple lovers committing suicide, hence the alternate term "lovers' suicide". There's no real distinction in meaning here.

Edit: I can explain a little more. , shinjuu, originally means two lovers committing suicide together, and this is the most common definition. Historically in Japanese literary tradition it's the result of lovers who are prevented from being together in this world (by social convention especially), so they die in order to be together in the next. It doesn't necessarily just mean two lovers, and can be done by other types of people with an intimate relationship. There's a type of shinjuu called , ikka shinjuu, which refers to family suicide, for example.

However, there's no way one person can perform a shinjuu. Well, there is , muri shinjuu ("forced double suicide") which refers to one lover killing the other and then trying to kill themselves. But Miyokichi committing suicide by herself is not in line with the idea of shinjuu at all.
>> ARTICLE
So like a Romeo and Juliet kind of suicide? I get it now, I took the translation from anilist but it seems you understand Japanese, thanks for the correction!

> OP. 

[Here is an English translation someone did on this song](http://www.lyrical-nonsense.com/lyrics/megumi-hayashibara/usurahi-shinjuu/#page=English-tv) if you are interested. There are a few parts I wouldn't agree on the translation, but it's just me being picky. 
>> ARTICLE
I've been listening to the OP non-stop in the past week so I'm curious, what parts of the translation would you change?
>> ARTICLE
1. "chokushi" part is translated as "I can't bear to look at you", but it is more than just a look but I won't be able to stand "direct gazing" from you. However, I'm not sure if this sounds natural in English. 

2. "jinsei gohasan" translated as "we start our lives anew", but I'd say "my life's over", and "it's your fault (=not mine)". 

3. "dore ga sore datte no yo" translated as "which time was that supposed to have been?", I'm not sure where this "have been" came from. I'd say "which one is it(=happiness), you say?", implying you can see that she has none. 

4. "mendou kusai wa" translated as "what a pain", and that can work too, but I'd prefer "what a bother", because "pain" could give a different impression from the context. 

5. "namusan" is translated as "let's say our prayers", but that's more like just saying "darn it". It has no religious meaning in here, just rhyming with "omaesan". (Although it is a famous phrase originally from Buddhism praising three jewels.)

The OP and the song are also in a bit different orders.

It goes line 10-halfway through 11.
Up to 6 through 9.
down to 15-end of song.

----

1. I love you, truly love you - I'll give it all to you! 
2. No - I hate you,  Really hate you - give it back after all, this instant!    
3. Ahh, My life's over and it's your fault.    
4. I don't get it - what is happiness, really? Which time was it supposed to have been?    
What a bother; shall I scatter my brains and guts about just to show you? (This line might have more)   
5. (I don't think?) There's any more we can get out of this, my hateful beloved... Saying goodbye should hurt,   
But it feels so good; those days have long passed. I want to put an end,    
To this life caught at a standstill...
The ice grows thin. I'm all alone.


If that's right then damn that OP is sad when matched with the images.  
 
1. Loving Bon.      
2. Hating Sukeroku    
3. I'm guessing pregnant with Konatsu     
4. Konatsu not knowing what happiness is her whole life.   
5. Then the rest seems to be Miyo and suicide.   
>> ARTICLE
> The OP and the song are also in a bit different orders.

Scroll down for the TV version.

And I don't think she's saying she hates Sukeroku. She loves Kiku and at the same time she hates him for not loving her back. I don't think Konatsu appears in this song. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah so it is...

>And I don't think she's saying she hates Sukeroku.

The song says "No" as Kiku disappears then it is the line about hating when Sukeroku appears. The numbers in the lists in my comment are meant to reference each other. The lines are being said as the subjects are appearing.

>I don't think Konatsu appears in this song.

http://imgur.com/a/QaHcm

I think the kid is and the woman at 0:38 is also Konatsu and not Miyo.

The woman at the end is definitely Miyo though.
>> ARTICLE
Ah so you're saying that the scenes in OP should be directly connected to the lyrics? 
>> ARTICLE
I'm guessing at that yeah. The timing of the flashes sort of match up. 

I'm having some doubts about the woman now, but they are close and she has dark eyes like Konatsu. The kid definitely has Konatsu's hair color.
>> ARTICLE
I was only talking about the lyrics. Shiina Ringo did say she read the comics before she wrote the song, so who knows. Hope you enjoy guessing as you like :)
>> ARTICLE
I went back and rewatched ep 1 last week and Sukeroku's daughter (her name escapes me) is speaking with an older woman about her mother... She calls her "Miyo-something" I can't remember exactly what it is but I figure that Miyokiychi either isn't her real name or she changes her name when she gets together with Sukeroku. This leads me to believe that she is the daughter of Sukeroku and Miyokitchi, that and have you actually looked at her? She is resembles her mother greatly, fantastic character design. 
>> ARTICLE
Konatsu has to be Miyo and Sukeroku's daughter. She's got his eyes and her everything else.
>> ARTICLE
I think the OP gives away the plot [Anime OP clues guess](/s "of the tragic drama we're just getting into. It talks about love with Kiku, then says no and switches to Sakeroku, after that it talks of ruining life life with images of a girl, then when showing the girl and flashing to what I think is the girl grown up, so Konatsu instead of Miyo, it sings about 'what is happiness? I've never know.' Which matches the bitter daughter/Konatsu of in the present, and finally it switches back to Miyo in water singing about gruesome suicide and death.")

The OP's song's order is modified from the single. I want to guess that isn't a coincidence.
>> ARTICLE
Oh boy, I got a little shiver down my spine when he practiced Shinigami at the end.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for pointing that out, I didn't realize that was Shinigami!Spine-tingling stuff indeed.
>> ARTICLE
so we are going full circle soon?
>> ARTICLE
tbh i kinda understand where kiku and his master is coming from. It is very hard to be in a serious relationship with someone who's job is to sell her body. Obviously it doesnt matter to most people but for his profession, it makes sense
>> ARTICLE
Nah. I'm pretty sure the master is just jealous of how close they are >.> The previous episode just demonstrates how uncomfortable he is with their closenesses. Even Shin noticed it! It's just an old man jealous that his mistress found someone she likes, which happens to be his apprentice :(
>> ARTICLE
Even if it makes sense, he doesn't need to drag it along and not inform her when he goes on some roadtrip. I get where he may be coming from, imo if you love someone it trumps most anything though. Even if his viewpoint is opposite, it doesn't really excuse him for treating her like dirt, especially because she has sincerely expressed her feelings for him.

Anyway, she made it obvious this episode that she doesn't really care for anything but to take care of her man/husband. I don't think that's the best for modern women but at the time, that is a legitimate thought process. That means she'd give up her geisha life and be a loving wife. Unfortunately Kiku's job is more important to him than putting up with the stigma. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I wish he just legit told her "I don't wanna be with you". The half-assing it is never good. 
>> ARTICLE
Kiku said he's planning to tell her some other time, so I'm expecting it happening in the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
No man, it's closed minded, old fashioned thinking. Pure elitism and classist. People can change, and the wife's former livelihood has no bearing on his ability to stand in front of a crowd and perform. It's a gross, backwards philosophy, and it's honestly cruel and hypocritical. Especially when he's the son of a geisha himself. He should be evidence that your background doesn't matter, and instead he's all too willing to embrace the status quo in his climb to the top. It's actually infuriating how pig headed he's being. And it's emblematic of a lot of societal problems old Japanese culture has, along with other bullshit stigmas like being an orphan or a woman's gender role in society. 
>> ARTICLE
> No man, it's closed minded, old fashioned thinking. Pure elitism and classist. People can change

I think that's exactly the point here though. Kiku is the closed minded, old fashioned, conservative guy, while Sukeroku is the renovationist who believe people change and can change. Also, Kiku being the son of a geisha who abandoned him and growing up there unhappily adds to it - he has his own stereotype of geisha or women and Miyo kinda confirmed his bias in a way. 

That said, I'd say it wouldn't have mattered to Kiku to get married to Miyo only if the master didn't tell him to break up with her - the thing he feared the most was getting expelled and lose rakugo. You can blame the society and the system all you want, but it's not as easy for those deeply in it to act against it as it may sound to others out of it. And the contrast is Sukeroku who never feared anything like old habits and customs.
>> ARTICLE
As you can see Kiku love Rakugo. And to do it he need the approvals of the masters who are closed minded, old fashioned. Look at how Sekeroku got from those elder for give no care about the tradition. 

The only happy ending where he marry Miyoki and keep doing rakugo is all the master suddenly drop dead due to unknown reason. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty sure she's not the kind of geisha who sells her body. I think it's been discussed earlier on in these discussions that she's the more traditional geisha who entertains with dances and the like.
>> ARTICLE
The Miyokichi moment was sad but I expected a lot worse. I just really like her character, she's just intriguing! That preview looks like it might lead to that direction where I didn't want it to lead to though :/
>> ARTICLE
Miyokichi feels... When Kiku shows up while Sukeruko is hugging Miyo just wow..Kiku can be a real ass sometimes..He finally acknowledges that he loves her but still wants to break up with her. I don't get it or maybe I do and don't want to admit it. Can he tell that Miyo doesn't like Rakugo and doesn't want her to be around a guy who thinks too much about it? Does he think she will be unhappy because of him and his Rakugo? It's frustrating but that's what makes him a good character.

It seems that a future Sukeroku and Miyo relationship isn't impossible. Sukeroku seems to be falling for her and the last scene of the PV... If Konatsu truly is the result of their future relationship it would explain why Kiku treats her badly. If she isn't and they never have a relationship, then I wonder why he treats her the way he does..
>> ARTICLE
At first, it sounded just mean, to toss her aside to protect the business, but hearing how tough it is to maintain the legacy and how insufficient the current Yakumo feels as a master, that made me feel for him as to why he wanted the most stable path for the future master. I have a feeling his fears and insecurity will explode going from the preview, and the whole 'modern Rakugo' vs 'traditional Rakugo' will happen eventually despite the long time friends shaking hands and wishing eachother luck. It is a real shame that the Yakumo feels there has to be a certain path and they can't  be more open about the future.

It's so sad, that these two can't perform and be together. Maybe a part of it is Kiku's own feelings, but maybe the tradition of the Yakumo is being mixed in with it as well. If only they were more open to eachother. Especially the master. But it seems they are stubborn about feeling that the only way forward is to separate.
>> ARTICLE

Does he think she will be unhappy because of him and his Rakugo? It's frustrating but that's what makes him a good character.

Go back and watch before and after his master brought up the trip and asked him about Miyo. This episode explicitly said what could be inferred last episode. He loves her, but he loves Rakugo more. He doesn't want to be cast out of the Rakugo world by his jealous master. He has always done what is right and proper for him to do even when it hurts him. He used the hugging encounter as an excuse to be a jerk and make the breakup easier just like he was cold before he left. Other than maybe giving her a reason to hate him so they can have a clean break, I don't think he's thinking of her like you want him to be.

>It seems that a future Sukeroku and Miyo relationship isn't impossible. Sukeroku seems to be falling for her and the last scene of the PV... If Konatsu truly is the result of their future relationship it would explain why Kiku treats her badly.

After seeing a translation of the lyrics, I think the OP hints that Konatsu is Sukeroku and Miyo's child and that she was not intentional. Really I think it gives away the plot to the rest of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure if it is just due to the same people drawing but you can notice the resemblances between [Konatsu](http://i.imgur.com/AR4dGOy.jpg) and [Miyokichi](http://i.imgur.com/77puthY.jpg) 

Btw: rewatching the 1st ep, the [okami](http://i.imgur.com/VuszbSf.jpg) said [Konatsu's mother used to work as geisha](http://i.imgur.com/OjCLdC6.jpg). Doesn't she look like [Ei](http://i.imgur.com/oGWpL4L.jpg)?

So Konatsu is the child of Miyokuchi and Sukeroku.

Is this the highlight of the week for anyone else? I love this series so much.
>> ARTICLE
Yes!! I can't wait to go home and watch it at the end of the day. It's a great slow burn. I can't articulate how, but it makes me feel very interesting emotions.
>> ARTICLE
Bruh you dont need to articulate how. we all feel the same way
>> ARTICLE
This was the first time I had to wait for a new episode after finally catching up and yes it sure is a highlight.
>> ARTICLE
It is certainly one of my favorites for the season. However, I think Boku dake ga Inai Machi has me for most anticipated since I refuse to read the manga. 
>> ARTICLE
Same here, I'm not touching the manga till the end. Both Showa Genroku and Boku dake are in my top list this season. Very different emotions evoked but equalling captivating shows.
>> ARTICLE
Yes.  It's so well written and so good. 

>> ARTICLE
wow. im absolutely floored once again.
The bedside scene with his father/master recounting his story of spite and envy.
The shinigami performance by kiku. It was all so engaging and beautiful to watch. 

And of course konatsu performing rakugo was amazingly cute
>> ARTICLE
I feel like so many people are missing out on this show. Its possibly AotS.
>> ARTICLE
I have been so consistently surprised by this show. It's beautiful, funny, sad, engaging, dramatic, not to mention the OP is top tier. Unless something goes horribly wrong I think I have no choice but to give it a 10. *Maybe* a 9.
>> ARTICLE
Sometimes I forget im even watching an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Gosh this is so true, not even just watching an anime, watching something period. It's been a long while since a show has immersed me this completely. 
>> ARTICLE
You know when you don't even think when watching (you forget about even watching something)just absorbing everything that world has to throw at you, that a show is *good.* 
>> ARTICLE
> of course konatsu performing rakugo was amazingly cute

Probably more than anything else in this show, it hurts me to think that she'll never be able to do Rakugo performances in the ways she wants to.
>> ARTICLE
It kind of mirrors how Bon must have felt when he wanted to be a geisha even though he's a boy. Just a thought.
>> ARTICLE
The shinigami performance was amazing. Awesome seeing the start of what will be his best rakugo
>> ARTICLE
It really felt, to me, that Kiku was putting all of the darkness surrounding the 7th Yakumo's death into that performance. The result was breathtaking, for sure.
>> ARTICLE
You are right... Sooo right. While Kiku was performing, i was in awe. It was beautiful. Can we throw money to Deen from now on? Because, they created a beautiful masterpiece.
>> ARTICLE
This episode (like last week's) have just blown it out of the water, with some of the most compelling, emotional sequences I've seen in a while. Shinigami had my heart thumping and spine tingling, and the whole thing wasn't even shown. The master's deathbed confession might have felt a little contrived until he said the magic words - , _ingaouhou_, karmic retribution. It's what the master's regrets were about, it's what Shinigami is about, and, in all likelihood, it's what Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is about with regard to the three Yakumos' relationship with the Sukerokus. There's probably some deep message about preserving tradition from within and outside of its institutions that someone smarter than me will write about when this series is over.

I loved the focus on Kiku's tiny movements, like him playing with the fan before going on stage, and that little eye tic when he realizes who Konatsu is. Why is a show even allowed to be this good.
>> ARTICLE
> , ingaouhou, karmic retribution. It's what the master's regrets were about, it's what Shinigami is about, and, in all likelihood, it's what Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is about with regard to the three Yakumos' relationship with the Sukerokus. 

Nicely put! Rakugo itself is about retelling people's /gou/karma(in Christian sense, maybe "sins" that people were born with?) which helps us laugh it out to live our lives (though, not necessarily about laughing). 

The irony, or rather the actual significance, of Shinigami story is the fact that it isn't actually a real Classic from Edo, although it is categorized as Koten/Classics. (Rakugo works created before Taishou era are all categorized as Classics). Shinigami is known to be an interpretation work of a Western story back in Meiji era by [Sanyuutei Enchou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San%27y%C5%ABtei_Ench%C5%8D). The original story is often said to be [Godfather Death by Grimm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfather_Death). (But wiki also lists [Crispino e la comare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crispino_e_la_comare) as another candidate since his translation works were often taken from Italian opera.) Enchou, born in the end of Edo and died in Meiji, was one of the most notable rakugo-ka who created many original rakugo works, including Western interpretations, and was called "/the restorer of Rakugo" who flourished Rakugo in Meiji era. Kajikazawa that Kiku played in EP1 (where Yotaro snored hard) is also Enchou's original story. 
>> ARTICLE
You know, for some reason this doesn't surprise me. It might just be the gift of hindsight, but it does feel like a western story.

I'm not familiar with Enchou, but the way you described him seems like a strong parallel to the role Sukeroku was playing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I agree. I don't know much about Enchou either, but it is said that he was too good and got envied and bullied even by his own master and others. They interrupted Enchou playing the stories he prepared by playing the very story before his turn on purpose. That made him decide "[/Never going to play the stories others play](http://www.aozora.gr.jp/index_pages/person989.html) and started creating his original stories. His reason of playing new rakugo was different from Sukeroku, but we can picture how they were both so popular and gathered all the attentions of envious old men. The era Enchou lived - Meiji Restoration time after Sakoku ended and Western culture flooding into the commoner's lives - can also give us the similar impression. 
>> ARTICLE
I think you are absolutely right, Karmic retribution, and atonement, seem to be the overall theme of the series. After all, Kyoji was inspired to get into rakugo after Kikuhiko's performance of "Shinigami," repeating the cycle in the present, and Kiku gives him the Yotaro name. But his style is that of a Sukeroku. It's atonement, for the 7th, and his, estrangement from the two Sukerokus. It's a final attempt in his late years to bring these two halves of rakugo, which are seemingly tied by the string of fate, back together.

>> ARTICLE
One thing that struck me about this episode was how somber and almost depressing it was for all but the last few minutes, and that Sukeroku is completely absent. There is no joy in Kikuhiko's world without Sukeroku in it, and this was reflected in his rakugo and the entire mood up until the point where we get to the soba restaurant, which is filled with laughter and Konatsu's lighthearted performance. 

Konatsu's unpolished version completely subverts the stifling traditions of the 7th generation and the rakugo "establishment," which would never allow a female, let alone a child, to perform, yet still brings joy to the audience, who are boisterous and shout encouragement, in contrast with Kikuhiko's  audience, which he described as "cold."
>> ARTICLE
It also, somewhat reflects on the landscape too. When he gets off the train, the city looks blurry and not so detailed as the streets he used to walk with Sukeroku in his Futatsume years. [](/s "Or maybe this is a drop in quality that I'm looking too much into.")
>> ARTICLE
That shinigami performance gave me straight out chills, Kiku's performance was just out of this world, and the scenery was insane. DEEN really put everything in this show, and I love it.
>> ARTICLE
Notice the proggresive change in color, from the cold greys, bronzes, whites present during the rebuttal of the new apprentice, Yakumo's confession in bed and the funeral, through the light blue of Kiku's coat blending with his pale skin, contrasting with the deep darkness during Shinigami - culmination of his solitude. Followed by increasingly more vibrant yellows and bronzes as he gets on the train, moves through the village, ending on a bright red of Konatsu's hair.  

Just something I happened to notice, I often have difficulties pinpointing that inescapable feeling that makes some shows stand out, but I think I did today, at least partly ;)
>> ARTICLE
Yes, there was a lot of symbolism and contrast in the this episode, something this series does very well.
>> ARTICLE
I am infatuated with this how. I loved how she immediately refers to Kiku as old man. Their back and forth banter is exactly the same several years later. 
>> ARTICLE
I felt that Sukeroku was going to turn up again during the Shinigami performance. It was the first story that Yotarou saw Kiku perform, and I thought it might be the last one that Sukeroku saw him perform, and then to find out about the death of their master. Would have also served to bring the characters back together again, but I think I prefer the way that that actually ended up happening  anyway.
>> ARTICLE
The shinigami performance was so good!    

With that ending I feel like next episode is gonna be great.     

[In the meantime we can listen to the OP song](https://youtu.be/a_UxWeBT1BY)
>> ARTICLE
Damn what a song I love it all ! The voice the instruments ! Whoa.. 
>> ARTICLE
The OP for this show is definitely the best one this season (at least for me.) Not only does it fit with the show so well, but the vocals...oh lawdy, it's like being seduced by a succubus and I don't mind it one bit. 
>> ARTICLE
Is there any more by her in that style?
>> ARTICLE
> it's like being seduced 

Yeah her voice is just so sultry it's great!
>> ARTICLE
Never realised that Rakugo could be that creepy. *shudder*

Seems history keeps repeating itself between masters and their apprentices. I wonder how if the Kiku is going to repeat the mistakes of his forebears.

Also how adorable was little Konatsu, Kiku really does seem to have a heart of stone not to be completely taken in by cute her Rakugo was.
>> ARTICLE
The Shinigami performance, it was breathtaking, absolutely impressive, wonderful job DEEN did with this one, this truly is their season, props to the team behind this show and the producers who greenlit it. Can't say that this won't be in the contest for AOTY once the year comes to an end.
>> ARTICLE
Ishida Akira deserves an award for his acting in this show. 
>> ARTICLE
every week I have exactly the same reaction about 45 seconds after the start of the episode: *What?!? I'm already half way through?*

Magic.
>> ARTICLE
Well... the opening is 1 minute and 30 seconds, so 45 seconds is indeed half way through.
>> ARTICLE
It's weird. When other anime does this kind of stuff, a lot of times I say it's cheap drama. But when it comes to SGRS, it feels so real and believable. Perhaps it's because they've done a great job at creating and developing these characters.

When they were talking about Sukeroku on basically his deathbed, it for some reason brought be back to the beginning of the series, with Yotaro adoring Sukeroku and Yakumo's obsession of him. And then all these feelings and history came together, and it really helped make that conversation suddenly very sentimental.

Next week is gig to be gold, isn't it. Can't wait for the reunion.
>> ARTICLE
A very haunting performance of Shinigami. These episodes really go by quickly they do such a great job at pulling you into the story you lose your sense of time.  
>> ARTICLE
That episode was absolutely incredible! The interaction with Yakumo in the first half was almost cathartic, because it finally felt like their relationship was laid bare. And that Shinigami performance! Kiku did more than just 'fill in' for his master, he blew it out of the water. I had genuine chills because the scenery and the voice acting created such an unsettling atmosphere. Baby Konatsu was adorable with her energetic rakugo. I'm looking forward to the mini-reunion of sorts next week!
>> ARTICLE
[Earlier this week, I wrote about how the show entices our imaginations just like a rakugo performance does.](http://minuteart.net/2016/03/07/a-performance-to-feel/) This essay is a couple of episodes late, but based on what I think will happen today, it should be appropriate enough :)
>> ARTICLE
This show is so god damn charming and tasteful, I'm so glad I decided to pick it up, it's like nothing I've ever seen before.

Kiku's performance of The Shinigami was so brilliant, it had me hooked so much that I felt like I lost track of time, the episode ended so quickly!

Looks like Sukeroku is making an appearance again, Miyokichi too, no matter how much I try to hate her I just can't, she's really charming...

On a side note, I kind of wanted Konatsu to be Kiku's daughter, I know it'd never happen but still.
>> ARTICLE
Well, since they are under the same roof in the present time, in a way they are like father and daughter I guess.
>> ARTICLE
Noticed in the OP that the woman's hair is now dark black instead of sky blue.
>> ARTICLE
This felt like the best episode of the season for me.  I don't even know why, since it wasn't the most eventful by any means (and I'm not as versed in the more technical/visual stuff as other posters here), but the tension was higher here than I can remember anywhere else in the series.  There was tangible pain hanging over everything here, and I couldn't look away.
>> ARTICLE
Iya-soba! (the banner of the soba place)   
So, they are now somewhere close to the famous mysterious land of [Iya Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iya_Valley) in Tokushima. This place is often said to be the hideout of [Taira family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taira_clan) who lost their war in 12th century. Great place to hide away from Tokyo life, and likely the perfect location for their reunion in the next episode, I think. 

History-wise, [Iya onsen](http://luxury.iiyudane.com/rotenburo-guestroom/hotel-iyaonsen/) (one of the most beautiful hot spring with the almost untouched wild nature) was discovered in 1965, so they probably needed Onsen-geisha (aka prostitutes in disguise) for tourists, and it convinces me that Miyokichi got easily hired there. (When Miyo first said Shikoku, I was thinking of Dogo Onsen in Ehime, though) 
>> ARTICLE
I just want to say I really like the context and trivia you give us every episode. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
That cable car from the Iya onsen looks awesome. Anyway, really good catch, that this was could be based on an actual location makes this show even more amazing with the level of details put in.
>> ARTICLE
When i watched episode 1 and the first time i heard rakugo i was barely kept awake by the rakugo, but still thought it was a very good show overall. 

But now, for me that Shinigami performance was just breathtaking. I feel the anime has worked wonders in implementing the rakugo into the show without detracting from the narrative of the actual story. Plus the different rakugo's performed always have a link with the current theme of the episodes which just adds that little bit extra (Also credit to the music as well).

I've got to say getting into the story, that Kiku's resolve really shows in this episode as i expected a sob story to follow with a easy resolution between the characters (I still would have cried like a little girl though probably). By basically having a time skip between the 3 characters, gives a chance for the characters to grow and makes the meeting between them that much more special. 

Finally, that last shot if Miyo at the end gave me goosebumps as the way she changed her character from being with Kiku to Sukeroku is now her actual personality as she now has a child with Sukeroku, so the confrontation between Miyo and Kiku is probably going to scar me for life...

>> ARTICLE
Uggghhhhh why is this show so good. It's almost at the point where I feel like I don't deserve something that just excels at everything it tries to do as much as this show does.

So, Yakumo and the first Sukeroku knew each other. This is just another part of some karmic cycle. Excellent closure there, and really shed new light on the themes of this show.  
And the Shinigami performance ... my God. The part when the stage turned black and the candles appeared, and the way the framing of the shots completely cut off the audience, and Kiku's performance ... I'm totally weebing out just thinking about it. Why can't we get directing like this in other shows?

And of course Konatsu. This show is finally starting to come full-circle. Even in just a few lines of dialogue, we can see Sukeroku's influence on her. So, how's Sukeroku going to react to Kiku being there? How are things going to progress from now on? Keep up the good work Deen.
>> ARTICLE
This show might be my anime of the season. Many people will go for Erased, which is competing for this spot in my personal ranking. But this show's complete emphasis on nothing but human connection and emotion, including its choice of subject in an oral storytelling art form (something very human) is so well done. It's freaking awesome. 
>> ARTICLE
Amazing as always. Now that we see Kiku looking for his old friend I'm curious how the events that got hinted at in episode 1 will play out.
>> ARTICLE
I hate these cliffhangers. One of the best anime of all time though. There hasn't even been a single boring or bad episode. Every episode is truly wonderful. 
>> ARTICLE
First things first, this episode started with a series of callbacks to Yotaro, from someone who came and begged Bon to take him as an apprentice, to grabbing his arm, to saying how moved he was by his performance. And on Bon's part as well, with lines that were proven false later on, such as "I will never take an apprentice," to "If you couldn't even convince your parents, how do you expect to convince the audience?" - Which was a callback to Yotaro's first real trial, of convincing his old boss that he could be a rakugo performer.

Moreover, lines such as "I don't have anything to teach an apprentice," which fed later into his discussion with Yakumo on his death's bed, about how he had to find his own style of rakugo, fed into how the premiere ended, with him telling Yotaro (and Konatsu), that they have to find their own styles, just like every single artist.

Tying the past to the present and the future was the line about how rakugo is a dying art-form, and how a "respectable young boy" such as the hopeful apprentice should find something better to do. On one hand, this is perhaps why he didn't want Konatsu to become a rakugo performer, aside from being a woman - he wants something *better* for her. And on the other hand, this is a betrayal of his pact with Shin, of keeping rakugo alive. But Shin left him, and thus stopped doing rakugo, so for his betrayal of the agreement, it shouldn't be surprising that the dejected Bon will betray it as well, or an admittance of defeat - that he can't uphold it on his own. He needed Shin to have hope of keeping rakugo alive.

And then we had what ties it all together. The Master on his deathbed, saying how he lost one of his *sons* to jealousy, to anger. This is about him accepting Shin to try and make amends for his past sins, but his own anger at himself led him to being unable to go all the way, until he cast Shin out. This is all about how we pay for our past sins. Likewise, Bon in the present with adult Konatsu and Yotaro. And Yotaro, whom he both accepted and then grew to resent for his similarities to and love of Shin, and obviously Konatsu. We're drawn to do the right thing, to undo our past mistakes, just as we are to vindicate ourselves by acting as if our past decisions were no mistakes at all, and try to erase everything and everyone that reminds us of them.

One more thing I'd like to mention is Bon's performance of Shinigami, the final "call-out" to the present, as this is the performance that later became his masterpiece, and the one that drew Yotaro to him, as he performed it in prison. This is also the final growth of Bon's performance, from one who only performs as a duty and doesn't invite the audience in, he grew to be someone who can invite the audience in, who looks at them. But now, he performs for himself. He performs for an audience of one, where he himself is drawn in by his performance, who can see the roles he portrays as if they were other people beside himself. He's creating a world, and he watches it even as he creates it. He doesn't perform for the audience, but they, like him, can't help but be drawn into the tapestry he weaves.

Can someone explain to me what Kiku meant when talking to the Yakumo, "that's something I never liked about you" and "but that is the one way I will never want to be like you". I don't really understand what Kiku is referring to
>> ARTICLE
Kiku saw 7th Yakumo's faults, how he was stubborn and not accepting Sukeroku's rakugo as much as he should(and actually did), rejecting Sukeroku in a way. Kiku said he didn't like this part of him, but such things taught him to become not like the master. That also, according to Kiku, helped him to play a different rakugo from the master's and made it possible for him to find his own original rakugo, not just a copy of the master's. In short, the master was teaching Kiku by his negative examples. (Please note that Kiku also said there were many things he liked about him too and thanked the master, so he wasn't blaming the master or anything in this scene.)

The same can be said in music, you can adore a great musician as much as you want, but simply copying him/her does not make you a great musician. 

What this episode reminded me of is the story of an actual rakugo-ka who died in 1981. There was a rakugo-ka called Shunpuutei Ichiryuu (ex-Sanyuutei Koushou) who was one of the apprentices of 6th Sanyuutei Enshou(whom I believe to be a model of both 7th and 8th Yakumos), but was said to look and sound exactly the same as the master Enshou. There seemed to have been a lots of drama between the two with too much love and hate. After Enshou died in 1979, Ichiryuu thought he was set free, but later he committed a suicide at the age of 45. People say Ichiryuu could never set himself free from Enshou's ghost.

Oh man, the fact that the Yakumos were modeled after real life makes it even more tragic.

They're all with different drama and it's more about inspiration I meant, but yeah.

Just thought I would add my opinion of where i absolutely love this show but still absolutely love shounens as well, so it doesn't have to be one or the other...
>> ARTICLE
truth to be told this anime might be great but very niche, making it difficult to appeal to broader audience and enter barrier from cultural difference does not make it much easier, even if the rakugo is just tool for the story it's something one may find interesting and distant making it for someone boring therefore staying and watching might be almost impossible. It's one of those shows that might get small base of people loving it and still stay unnoticed by many just because how specific the appeal is. The small popularity is as expected in my opinion and is nothing to be concerned about since it's not anime that is expected to be extremely popular at least not here.
>> ARTICLE
I am aware, I just wanna get it off my chest for no reason.
>> ARTICLE
It clearly caters to a more mature audience. Whether that is something that can be successful or not remains to be seen, but with this and *Boku Machi*, they seem to be targeting the adult audience who doesn't view animation as something just for kids and otaku, which is a growing number of people.

I'm kinda getting the feeling that this anime is creeping into my top 3 anime of all time.

...I'm fine with this.

Is there anyone that could either PM or reply whether or not this show is a sad show? What I mean by sad show is there is basically no light and the end of the tunnel-sad.

I mean, I can handle normal-sad, I dont want to deal with you know.. Cheating, death, anything awful like that. 

Is there a chance for me?

We don't actually know for certain how this will pan out, but you can actually see some hope in the first episode alone.

I would have never thought this show was the one that was going to grab me the most out of all the series coming into this season, but this is an all-timer in the making. Truly phenomenal stuff on a consistent basis.

I know she wasn't in this episode and only have a voice over in the preview this week, but jeez Miyokichi's voice is just mesmerizing. It's so seductive, yet chilling at the same time. I don't know exactly how to describe it. Hell all of the VA's in this show are absolutely killing it. Gah I love this show.  

I agree with everyone here, that performance was truly chilling and tense. So much better than this week's Erased and its "big" reveal. Before all the Erased fans come at me with pitchforks, I am fine with who the killer is since it has been very obvious for a while. I just didn't like how it was revealed in the episode. I just personally felt it lacked the impact I'm used to from previous episodes. Also the killer just suddenly became almost comically villainous. I thought he was going to laugh maniacally like some comic book villain. Sorry for the tangent. Just wanted to get that off my chest since anything negative gets buried in that thread.

TL:DR This show is killing it.

EDIT: I can see what ya'll are saying about Erased. I think we they give us some backstory about the character (which I hear should happen next week) I should be more accepting haha.
>> ARTICLE
> Before all the Erased fans come at me with pitchforks

even though I agree with you about it, let's shit on Erased in other threads, shall we? This thread is about good anime :)
>> ARTICLE
Regarding the Erased reveal: [Erased until #10](/s "I liked the way it was done, we've established early the killer is highly intelligent, so dropping the facade only after he confirmed a checkmate on a highly difficult opponent felt fitting. So did the relief, and cherishing the satisfaction - he clearly takes pride in outplaying his enemies, see: the smirk when he set up Satoru in ep. 1, and confirmed his capture in ep. 6")
>> ARTICLE
> Miyokichi's voice is just mesmerizing

The VA did a fantastic job with the OP. Her voice is perfect for the seductive aspect.
>> ARTICLE
Personally I think this is a better show, but the Erased reveal was pretty good too in my opinion.  [Erased Episode 10](/s "On one hand, you're right that the teacher went over the top compared to his previous persona, it makes sense since someone that deranged would have to be used to putting on a show to get a teaching job.  Meanwhile, Satoru's reaction to finding out was clearly meant to reflect the audience's self-denial about his obvious guilt, and personally I think it succeeded there.") 

At the end of the day, these shows are using different methods of building and releasing tension, but they're both doing a great job of it.
>> ARTICLE
> So much better than this week's Erased 

I thought they were both really good, just very different shows. I kind of see your point, but a psychopathic killer finally dropping the mask in front of his victim when he no longer feels the need to hide it isn't exactly new. 

The facial expressions were perhaps a bit exaggerated, but it's animated, so necessarily much of what is conveyed onscreen is visual.
>> ARTICLE
Prior to watching this episode, I read a couple of extremely positive comments about the episode, which raised my expections, and Rakugo exceeded them with ease. It managed to tie things back to the beginning of the show with subtlety, whether it waa Kiku's beginning as an apprentice or even the frame story from the first episode. Given what we know about the conclusion, it made the impact if the events this week even greater. And Kiku's performance was just fantastic this week. 

Enough with my ramblings. I need to get more people watch this. This might end up being my favorite show in years.
>> ARTICLE
The performance by Kiku, The Sninigami, which in current time was the show that the guy i prison fell in love with, was so brilliantly done.

The VAs for this show is something else.

And even as a kid, Konatsu was feisty.

To me, it's everyone, but I'm talking about who's going to pull the last trigger directly and I think it's been foreshadowed enough.

Everyone ruined it for themselves long ago.  This is gonna just be the payoff to seeds that have already been sown long ago.

I'm just wondering how much time passed in real life while Yakumo is telling this story.  
Did Yotarou fall asleep again?
>> ARTICLE
Presumably, it's being told over several nights. Yakumo ends one of the episodes with 'I'm tired now, so we'll continue this later' (or something like that).
>> ARTICLE
So is the Rakugo association like the stage actor's guild or something? Seems kind of strange that Sukeroku can't get a gig anywhere but a small town having been kicked out.

Sure he'll never make it big maybe, but I'm surprised he can't at least make ends meet with performing in a bigger city. There has to be small venues or private performances he can do. (he must have made some connections during his years as an apprentice)

Enjoyed this quite a bit, episode was incredibly interesting, especially for a show with a subject I'm unfamiliar with. Liked the dialogue and interactions between the characters felt quite realistic, even if one of them was Yotarou who seemed so out of place at first. [His reactions/faces](http://i.imgur.com/YpG7ACR.jpg) were so good! This looks like it's going to be quite a character driven story, which makes me really curious. I'm also quite curious about what happened with Sukeroku, hopefully next episode will shed some light on that.

The choice of voice actors was superb, from what I heard so far. Seki Tomokazu in Yotarou's role is great, especially considering the comedic style he went for in his rakugo and how his whole character seems to be/act. Kobayashi Yuu did a great Konatsu, can't wait to hear her rakugo voices/roles! Ishida Akira's rakugo sounded so interesting, I'm unsure if they will keep up this way of presenting quite a bit of his performances or not, since this was an extended episode it seems, but he sounded really good. 

Definitely going to keep watching :)

Having seen anime for 20 years running i must say, THIS IS AWESOME.
I can't even find words to describe how wonderful this episode was. When you're used to almost the same kind of animes over and over again, something so FRESH just makes everything worth.

I watched the episode 2 times, 1 just for "ok, let's give it a try" and the 2nd one for "details". Loved the background music every second. The rakugo around mid episode was SO GOOD, it even made me laugh at some point. 

If you haven't seen it, and are looking for something DIFFERENT, give it a try, you won't regret it.
>> ARTICLE
Just finished the episode. Just wonderful, absolutely wonderful. My 2 biggest complaints with so much modern anime has been: one, they don't let conversations flow naturally. Too much explicit exposition, not enough tacit understanding - Let the emotions and undercurrents flow through what's on screen. And two: forgetting that the story is what makes the show. I couldn't give two cents about what the animation was like as long as the show doesn't lose track of the story. Storytelling, atmosphere building, great characters. These are the essentials of a show and it's only fitting that an anime about storytelling gets it right.

Bravo, DEEN, bravo. This will be a true pleasure to watch these coming weeks.
>> ARTICLE
> Too much explicit exposition, not enough tacit understanding - Let the emotions and undercurrents flow through what's on screen.

Ironically, the kind of storytelling you see in those rakugo performances probably directly contributes to what you're describing.  The performer has only his body and two simple props to work with, so he has to rely on more telling and less showing than a rich medium like anime is able to.

I don't know about that. From what I saw of rakugo this episode, the dialogue is actually very light on the fluff and almost completely serves to develop the scenario at hand. Like I was saying elsewhere in this thread, there's a difference between dialogue heavy shows (performances) that don't get anywhere and those that keep the momentum going, and to me, rakugo seems to fall under the latter category.
>> ARTICLE
An example of what I mean was during Yotaro's performance where the renter muses to himself, out loud, right in front of the landlord, that he had in fact pawned his furniture.  This is the kind of thing in an animated show you could solve with a quick flashback insert, complete with old-footage effects and such.  A show-don't-tell thing.  (Maybe that's not exactly what you were talking about though?)

Oh no, you're right, I've just forgotten what exactly happened during the performance.

>> ARTICLE
alright, ***wow***.  
  
had to periodically stop the episode to try and convince other people to start watching it, so this is coming in a bit later than I'd hoped. this really had it all:   
  
1. an interesting setting: the showa-era is a time that doesn't see a lot of representation in anime, especially compared to the Heisei period, the Edo period, and the Meiji period, and this show uses it to its full advantage. the mix of traditional and mid 20th century was highlighted beautifully with the different outfits, the battle between classic string arrangements and jazz, the almost pastoral elegance of the theatre compared to the shots of the city, it really captured the transitory and experimental nature of the era.  
2. a unique focus: [Rakugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakugo) is a subject I've only ever seen be tackled by one other anime, [Joshiraku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12679/Joshiraku). while Joshiraku was a ton of fun, it never once showed a full on performance, instead opting for a SoL moeblob approach to the waiting room that was, while entertaining, not really using its assets to its fullest. so, having a drama focus almost entirely around the artistry of the performances, paying lots of attention to the practice and really showing the depth of each story and the motions needed to sell them, it's like nothing I've seen in another anime.  
3. great humor and touching drama: Yotarou's thief story in the middle was comedy gold. I lost it at "I have a kid and three sick wives", and the general execution and comedic timing of the whole scene was perfect. Yotarou in general is a ton of fun to watch and a very easy character to feel for, with great reactions and an amazing voice. feeling for him, as well as for Miyokichi and Yakumo, made all their more upsetting interactions hit that much harder, especially in the episode's closing scene, something that was supplemented by strong character writing and well scripted dialogue.  
4. amazing sound design and voice acting: the range of emotion expressed in and out of the performances is on an extreme scale. Tomozaki Seki, in particular, is so talented in this that he took my breath away and instantly made me a fan. his control was impeccable and he really sold me on believing that he was the one on the stage. besides that, the music as a whole was outstanding and all the little sound effects, from those of the props to simple things like footsteps and the buzz of a mid century television set, really tied the whole thing together in a pretty soundscape.  
5. awesome direction and expressive animation: Shinichi Omata may be new to the game, but he's here trying to get me into thinking he's been at this forever. the use of angled shots, alternating light sources, zoom ins and zoom outs, warping colors, and looping compositions, made for a very engaging watch, even when the characters were quite literally talking alone in a room. on that note, the movement on the body language was really, really spot on and I have to commend DEEN on their ability to capture acting through animation. I was never pulled out of a scene because of a janky motion or a disconnect between voice and action, and that's incredibly impressive when you consider they're *literally* animating a piece of performance art. in some places, this was stunning.  
  
and there's just so much more to it that I could go on for much longer, if I didn't have to go somewhere in *fuck* 15 minutes apparently?? while I thought they did a lot well and truly utilized the episode length to great effect, boy did watching that and writing this take up a portion of my day! but wow, was it well worth it.  
  
so far, unless Erased stays on course without stutter and this show magically becomes awful, this is my projected AOTS for sure after this.
>> ARTICLE
> the showa-era is a time that doesn't see a lot of representation in anime

Categorically not true.  If only because you should try watching shows that were like, you know, made during the Showa Era... This isn't ancient history, it was just a few short decades ago...
>> ARTICLE
the implication was that modern anime don't often revisit that time era, haha. something like this or Kids on the Slope is relatively rare these days. even then, though, the 70's, what's pictured in this show, wasn't actually the time setting in a lot of shows even during the 70's, with a greater portion of shows being retro futuristic tokusatsu or mecha programmes (Gatchaman, Combattler V), Matsumoto space operas (Harlock, Yamato), or Shoujo period pieces set in exotic locals (Candy Candy, Rose of Versailles). stuff like Wandering Sun or Ace wo Nerae that weren't fantastical and were rooted in the time era were comparatively rare. 
>> ARTICLE
> the implication was that modern anime don't often revisit that time era

The implication using the word 'modern' there that 1989 or earlier is ancient history.

> something like this or Kids on the Slope is relatively rare these days.

Not really.  Or at least, it's no more rare than any other kind of period piece.  In fact, I'd gander to say it's more common than say, anime set during the Heian Period, or the Bakumatsu Period.  Look at this season alone.  What are the period pieces?  There's literally none except this show.  Oh, but there's also Boku Dake ga Inai Machi - which takes place at the tail end of the Showa Era, and there's arguably Schwarzesmarken (alternate timeline 1980s).
>> ARTICLE
> The implication using the word 'modern' there that 1989 or earlier is ancient history.

In terms of anime? Yes. Some might argue that even pre-2005 anime isn't modern. There's a world of difference between a 2015 anime and a 1995 anime. 

I know you don't want to admit you're getting old... but you're getting old.

>I know you don't want to admit you're getting old... but you're getting old.

Not really, but I will admit that babies continually keep being born and they'll inevitably keep thinking that they're the center of the world and that only their perspective is valid/important.

I'm about to start this show because it was recommended by a fellow fan of Gaki no Tsukai, specifically Tsukitei Housei, who is a Rakugo artist (is that what they are called?), to get a better understanding of what Rakugo is. Glad to know that it is good! Time to start watching!

That was really good, feels so fresh watching adults in this high school heavy anime time. The artstyle is very fitting for my taste. The character designs, both visual and characteristics, is right down my alley so this will be a a very good show for me.

I really like how the dialogues and monologues are written, how they just go on and on and I never tired of it. The VA's is so on point too I feel, impressed by all 3 main VA's but especially Yakumo sounded amazing. The long performance scenes were interesting all the way, and Konatsu is a great character I already like. 

I really enjoyed this, and it might turn out to be a favorite of the season.
>> ARTICLE
"I have a kid and three sick wives."

That's what happens when you go for the Harem ending, ladies and gentlemen.

Wow, I was intrigued by this, but that was awesome. I only had the vaguest knowledge about this kind of theatre, but I loved the show presented it. Especially Yakumo's performance with the little images he was conjuring up and that ad-lib to cover the snoring was great.

 Wasn't sure about the faces at first, but I got used to it. Though the backgrounds were amazing, I love the mix of modern and traditional Japanese elements that occurred at that point in time.
>> ARTICLE
Have to say I concur with all the gushing in this thread. It's not all that often watching seasonal anime that you get to say "I've never seen anything like this before". Because of the subject the voice acting was always going to make or break this anime, and it is outstanding.
>> ARTICLE
It was a double-length episode, but felt like half of that. People like to shit on Deen around here but they did an absolutely stellar job with this, it really drew you in. They really managed to capture an incredible vivid image of what I can only assume is the late 60s or 70s or so (as per the show's title), with those stunning backgrounds and incredible attention to detail in the setting. The character animation is especially worth mentioning, since rakugo in particular calls for some very lively and emotive character acting. They pretty much nailed it in that regard.

Speaking of rakugo, the miming is mostly secondary to the vocal act itself. Supposedly important qualities in a rakugo performer are the range of your voice (the variety of voices you can do) and the skill with which you switch between the different characters in the story, as well as memorizing long and complicated stories with tongue-twister-like elements. In that light, they got some fantastic voice actors involved here. Ishida Akira is a legend and has some immense talent, I can't think of someone better suited for the role. He killed it this episode, though we didn't actually see much of his performing until the relatively short scene at the end. Seki Tomokazu on the other hand got to shine with that full-length display, and he's honestly pretty damn great as well. Not quite as suave as Ishida, but got plenty of range. Rakugo has always come off as rather... obscure to me (might have to do with the fact I've never seen an actual full performance), but I actually chuckled at his story more than once, and I trust it's a fairly accurate portrayal of the real thing. Who'd have thought. Kobayashi Yuu is always lovely to hear as well, and I'm entirely confident she'll be fantastic once we inevitably get to see her perform.

As for the actual contents of the show, it more or less completely fulfilled my expectations. Yotaro was quite sympathetic, trying to reform his life after prison. "A spur of the moment thing" like he put it himself, but there was a truckload of passion to be felt in his pursuit of rakugo. We don't know his criminal past yet, but it's already tried to cath up with him once, and there is no doubt it'll try again. Master's comment at the end about dying felt particularly ominous and foreshadowing. This is definitely not the last we've seen of Yotaro's old boss, and it seems Sukeroku was involved in his own share of unlawful business as well back in his day. Remains to be seen if these threads are interwoven somehow. The next episode should give us a fair deal of insight into him specifically. Rakugo being centered around switching roles and playing many characters at once certainly feels relevant as well in regards to that.

Apparently rakugo is a very male-dominant world, though whether it's a more 'forced' tradition of only men being able to perform it or if it's more of a natural 'coincidence', I don't know. Konatsu, as an aspiring female rakugo performer, is facing a pretty big hurdle either way, trying to break into such a rigid (for a lack of better word) culture. As the daughter to someone who apparently was a big damn deal in the scene, she also carries a lot of pressure with that legacy. A legacy that also seems to have drifted into Yotaro, and so we get yet more interwoven stories. But beyond just her ambition as a rakugoka, she also bears that grudge against the Master, which in turn ties him to everything in more than one way. He cares not only for the survival of rakugo as an artform, but he seems to be feeling indebted to Sukeroku and cares for the daughter as well. 

The late Sukeroku definitely feels like the center axis here, tying all of these characters together in one way or another. Undoubtedly we'll be unraveling his life as we go along, it seems starting with an extensive flashback next week. I can't wait for how this will develop. Stellar start.

And as a PS: Because this is about rakugo I feel obliged to mention [Joshiraku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12679/Joshiraku), probably the only other anime in existence with it as an element. While it's not really about the performing itself as much as this is (it's basically satirical comedy about modern Japanese culture, mentality and politics), it's feature to an extent, and is incredibly interesting in its own right.
>> ARTICLE
> It was a double-length episode, but felt like half of that.

Holy shit, this is an understatement. I'm being serious here: I had no idea what I just finished watching was a 50-minute long episode until I came to this thread, got to the start of your comment, and rushed back to the episode to check its length. It's a good testament to the show's quality when it can make fifty minutes go by like a breeze. 

Definitely agree with a lot of what you had to say.

>Because this is about rakugo I feel obliged to mention Joshiraku, probably the only other anime in existence with it as an element. While it's not really about the performing itself as much as this is (...)

Joshiraku does focus little on the rakugo aspect, but there's two drama CDs (2-Dmu and Time Leap Soba) you can find translated on YouTube of the cast performing rakugo routines that's worth watching if you haven't yet. They're parodies of traditional routines "Jugemu" and "Toki Soba" so looking up up real speakers performing those first if you haven't seen them before might be a good idea, but they're fun either way.
>> ARTICLE
Oh right, forgot about 2Dmu. I have indeed listened through it, more than once too. Pretty hilarious stuff. I should definitely look up some real rakugo, though. I wonder if you can find something subbed anywhere.
>> ARTICLE
That rakugo performance in the middle of that episode was breathtaking. I continue to be impressed with Tomozaku Seki, his range from Daru to Gilgamesh to this show's Yotarou is so versatile. Yuu Kobayashi's voice has always been one of favorites and I _can't wait_ to see her do more rakugo - and for the show to get into her conflict with Yakumo and the male-exclusivity of rakugo.

Not the most gripping of plots in this pilot, but the character drama and beautiful performances by the voice actors have me really excited for more.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, this was great. My only exposure to rakugo prior to this show was the running gag with Penguin-san in Shirokuma Cafe. It's not something that I necessarily find funny since it seems like a very culturally Japanese style of humor, but I do appreciate the theatricality of it. 

Yotarou's big performance scene was so well executed despite it's length and wordiness. They did a great job of capturing the subtleties of his body's movements and how Yotarou portrayed each character. The physicality highlighted by the shots of his feet or knees was really impressive. And how the camera moved to new angles to emphasize changes in character was very smart. The music kicked in as his exhaustion started to, and you could see him literally steaming under the lights and sweating through his clothes. It was weirdly thrilling to watch.

It's definitely not a show that will appeal to most viewers, but I'm very intrigued.
>> ARTICLE
I loved the execution of Yotaro's performance too. The quick back and forths with the camera to give the impression there are two people interacting, little glances at his sweat and feet position (when he leaned forward, i nearly thought he was going lose balance, heightening the tension in the first part of the performance) Konatsu mimicking the rakugo, the audiences ever growing laughter, Yotaro getting visibly more excited as the scene progressed and not to mention the voice actor doing an amazing job. It was brilliant and i was thoroughly engaged throughout. I could actually imagine myself going to see his performance. That's how good it was.

Also i actually found the story he was telling really funny in the end. Especially when the burglar utilized the teachings he recieved and said he had three sick wives and that it was a spur of the moment thing aha 
>> ARTICLE
Dude, I was completely absorbed in the story midway through the episode until the music snapped me the hell out of it. Damn, the direction, editing, voice acting, and what substitutes for cinematography in animation were just amazing. 

It's so difficult to get people engrossed in dialogue-heavy scenes, let alone what's essentially a ***10 minutes monologue.*** Think about that, it's 10 minutes of someone talking to themselves with the occasional audience reaction or a scarce line from the supporting cast. Nothing of what shows usually do there where they *show* you the story instead of let you listen to it. It's so against the medium, but it worked out so well. Shows both the confidence of the director in the scene, and shows how well the setting makes you sit in that* theater.

Man*, those 10 minutes were almost perfect bar the music. They were masterful. I'm so in love with this show right now.
>> ARTICLE
I didn't even realize that was a 10 minute performance until i checked when the episode finished. I loved every second of it.


>> ARTICLE
I actually heard  about this anime since I heard Hayashibara Megumi [sung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_UxWeBT1BY) the ending theme song with Shiina Ringo doing the writing/arranging/composing. The song is AMAZING, and I was curious about the anime.

I only had a faint idea about rakugo, and my first impression was: It was going to be boring compared to the Japanese comedy that I see nowadays. I was pretty much wrong. The performance in the middle had gotten me smiling so much. 

A lot of things in here kept me watching: the story, the characters, the voice acting. I'm pretty excited for next week.

>> ARTICLE
What do the lyrics of the song me/what are they in English. It sounds orgasmic.
>> ARTICLE
The thing that convinced me to watch this show in the first place was that I heard what I thought was a Shiina Ringo song being used in the PV. So I looked at the MAL page and there her name was...but holy shit was I surprised that Hayashibara was singing and not Shiina.

 She's incredible
>> ARTICLE
I also thought the anime was going to end up being boring, but I'm **really** glad I decided to check it out. 

I've never heard anything from Hayashibara Megumi before but I guess I need to look her up, because the ED was amazing. 
>> ARTICLE
Holy crap. The full version of the ED is even better. 

It feels so good to hear songs that are worth listening outside of their anime.

Everyone is talking about Dagashi and I'm just sitting here entranced by rakugo. Love the use of jazz as well. I am by no means saying Dagashi is bad. I was amused by it, I just fail to see the hype.


>> ARTICLE
It's a source material thing.  Popular source material being adapted always gets a hype multiplier.  A lot of times that's justified eventually, of course  they got popular for a reason, after all.
>> ARTICLE
The only thing competing with it so far is ERASED, in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Well he's a kid and back in school, so that knocked it down a couple points right off the bat.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, definitely. All the other stuff that has started airing is kind of meh so far, except maybe Phantom World.

Edit: This is just my opinion, you may very well like other shows than me.
>> ARTICLE
Phantom World is one of the funniest comedies of the decade. The art of cringe.
>> ARTICLE
Little early to say that after just 1 episode imo. It'll he hard for it to be a better comedy than Osomatsu-San. That one's one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
Popular concensus is that Gintama is the funniest anime ever made, but if you're looking for something short, around 12 episodes, Binbougami ga! is my favorite comedy series. Like it's the only show to make me literally roll on the floor from laughter. Also featuring one of the best performances from HanaKana. [And this song!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3vuOPx_tc)
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen Gintama so I was only talking about anime I've seen. Don't know why that warrants downvotes but whatever.

I plan to watch Gintama at some point though, I've only heard good things.

Yep, so far this and Erased are the best of the season.

I have a suspicion that Dimension W will be pretty good as well, so holding out hope for that.

And Ojisan and Marshmallow.

Pretty much. The only things left that might be in the running are Dimension W, Grimgar, Snow White Season 2, and that MuvLuv anime.

I have a feeling it won't be Grimgar.

You never know! It looks to be more of a grounded Utawarerumono than another SAO clone.

That was a masterful first episode. 48 minutes long too!

Voice acting is obviously going to be a MAJOR key in this anime, and it was absolutely fantastic. When Yotaro is up on stage, he has to single-handedly carry the episode for a good 10 minutes there, and he totally did. The rakugo performances were enthralling, except for the one that wasn't supposed to be. I guess I'm a little like Yotaro, because I had trouble staying awake through that one as well.

I loved Konatsu's character. I would watch the rest of the show just for her, but Yotaro is a great MC, and I enjoyed the laid back but sly attitude of his master.

I loved the traditional music, especially the drums, all throughout. It added a lot to the mood.
>> ARTICLE
>The rakugo performances were enthralling, except for the one that wasn't supposed to be. I guess I'm a little like Yotaro, because I had trouble staying awake through that one as well.

I thought the point there was that Yotaro had been staying up late listening to records, not that the performance was lacking.
>> ARTICLE
I think it was a mix of both.
>> ARTICLE
This is a little late to the conversation but I think it also serves to contrast Yotaro's and Yakumo's style of rakugo where one is highly expressive and loose while the other is far more tightly and strictly managed. I suspect that this contrast in presentation may play a role later on.
>> ARTICLE
Anime tagged as Josei don't come around very often, I hope others will pick this up as well.
>> ARTICLE
The ones that manage to get animated tend to end up being fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
iirc Shoujo and josei usually don't sell well which is why they always pick the unique ones to adapt.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, what was that. They talked for over 40minutes yet it really hit the spot. Those stories they told actually got me chuckling out loud several times.

The main character is really likeable -- at first I was a bit "worried" about the setting of him coming out of prison, but there was no need.

I feel like it just started and pulled you in from the moment they performed their first rakugo (the very first) -- Yota's rakugo was definitely the highlight for me.

.. when he started snoring I actually said "Oh fuck" out loud, paused the video and alt+tabbed for a second. God, that was immersing, I can't wait for more.

To be honest, the Monogatari series has a ton of dialogue aswell, yet I don't enjoy that nearly as much as the one we got in this episode. The dialogue we've seen here was not complex like the Monogatari series', yet it did not lack any factors either. In fact, **I believe** (hint hint, opinions) this show did it a lot better than Monogatari has ever done it, speaking from an anime-viewpoint. Just wow, simply amazing.
>> ARTICLE
The thing about dialogue heavy shows is that some tend to stagnate as the dialogue occurs and, although a lot is being said, very little is actually happening. This show does dialogue right in  that it serves its purpose to advance the plot while still being meaningful and rich.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't been immersed in anime as much as in this episode.

It was *riveting*.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I'm hooked. Did not expect this to be so good given the synopsis. Never even heard of rakugo before but it doesn't matter since the characters make the show for me. 

Yotarou is a great unorthodox MC with his loud, outgoing idiot personality that blends well with his childlike passion for rakugo. It's very endearing how all it took for him to get back on the right path was something as simple as a rakugo performance in prison. Though I can't help but worry his past will come back to bite him in the ass eventually.

Konatsu also makes for a great female protag. Shes tough and strong willed, but still shows compassion at the right times. I particularly liked the scene where she finds Yotarou sitting outside the house in the freezing cold and tells him to man up and face Yakumo directly while gently taking his hands. It really emphasizes her hard and soft side at the same time. Its gonna be interesting to see how she deals with the issue of rakugo being prodominantly gender locked to to men.

Finally, Yotarou's master Yakumo is a pretty mysterious old man that has a shrouded past with Konatsu's dead father. I haven't read the source material but I'm going to guess that he didn't really kill Konatsu's father but still felt responsible for his death, which is why he takes her in to his care. It looks like we will found out about him next episode judging by the preview. 

On a side note, after watching this, Akagami no Shirayukihime and Akatsuki no Yona, I'm convinced that I have a thing for strong, independent, pretty redheaded protagonists (o\\\\\\o)

Wow this was an engrossing episode.  Great cast of characters with well suited VAs, interesting story, and great visual and sound direction.  The way the shot hopped around during their rakugo was very good, and the camera work during other parts way great as well.  The traditional soundtrack was both fitting and engrossing, really helped draw me in.  Can't wait for more [:>](https://i.imgur.com/YpG7ACR.jpg)

Damn, this was an amazing episode. I didn't expect much going in, but I was blown away. The dialogue, the hints of the past, and Yotaro's performance... Just wow. I am looking forward to the next episode. DEEN finds a way indeed.

Ok, that was good, and I don't mean like good in a good way, I mean like, scary good.

**First Impressions:**

**Presentation:**

This show isn't going for flashy animation, but it doesn't need it. The character models aren't always sharp, but they don't need to be. The show flows well, and its characters are extremely expressive. They look composed when they need to, they look tired and haggard when the show calls for it, and if they sometimes have slightly less lines, or are a bit comically deformed, then it too is in service to the show's aesthetic. Not a lot of animation? Cutting from one still frame to another? But, the show not only works with it, it'd work *less* without it.

The lighting is spectacular, and the shot composition and the colours used, such as when we first saw the big city, or in prison, or as we saw the moon and the snow, all reminded me of Uchouten Kazoku slightly, or Janusz Kaminski's filmography (Saving Private Ryan, Bridge of Spies, and many more.). The shot compositions, the colours, the lightings. All good.

So, sound. Quite a nice jazzy music backdrop. The string instruments that play now and then, and the more "old-school" music that plays in the performance and surround this show all sound good and lend it a certain atmosphere. The voice acting is solid, but I'm not sold on Ishida Akira as the old master. His voice is good for the cynical "yin" person that he's portraying here, more cold and conniving than aloof, but he doesn't have the charisma needed for the role he's supposed to be portraying in-character. I'd have liked Sakurai Takahiro to do that, but well, he's doing half of his role really well, so I can't really complain.

Lead actor's voice sounds "off" and reedy and funny some of the time, but then again, that's exactly what he should sound like. Top marks for the show here. It's not the best looking and best sounding show, *but*, it sounds and looks as it should, which is more important.

Also, lead character, especially when he smiles, often reminds me of The Tatami Galaxy's Ozu, heh.

**ED** - Very jazzy, very cozy. It's ok, but I'm not a big fan of jazz.

**Themes / Story:**

So. I don't laugh at anime a lot. Quite rarely. Japanese-style humor via anime works even less for me (sorry Osomatsu-san and Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei, it's not you, it's me). So imagine my surprise when the "in-show" show, which lasted like 10 minutes, had me smiling, then chuckling, then laughing out right. I could watch more of it. Though I guess them cutting the time-frame down certainly didn't hurt. But I'm so glad they gave it that long and uninterrupted section.

This show was the 2nd most-looked forward to non-sequel by me, this season, the other one was Boku Dake ga Inai Machi, which had a spectacular premiere, and man, this show gives it a run for its money. That premiere was much tighter, but this one I probably enjoyed more. The key thing [I said of Bokumachi's premiere](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3zwq2j/spoilers_boku_dake_ga_inai_machi_episode_1/cypq7yd) holds even truer here - it doesn't feel like an anime. It feels like a proper television (western) drama, and that's high praise.

We've got themes out of the wazoo here, the "shinigami"? It should be talking about Yotaro's pre-rakugo life, as a criminal, but it also speaks of his apprenticeship, of how he's going to give away his life's energies for a new life, where he wants to be happy and famous, but is buying into a dying art-form. Likewise the late performance he slept through, where the hapless traveler is tricked and poisoned, but saved at the last moment by the heavens.

There's certainly a lot going on with Konatsu's father, the memory-ghost that haunts the sometimes cruel and often indifferent master. It's a broken household. Held together by bitter memories and shared passions. The past, and the future, which he plans to leave to those two, not because it's his desire, I think, but because there's no one else. As time passes by, our old enemies who walked the long journey of life with us are closer to us than many so-called friends whom we left behind. The past, and the future, of a dying art-form. Also a metaphor referenced during the episode.

There's a lot going on, and it was well-acted, and well-directed, and funny, and I loved it. Good stuff, and I'm glad it was double-length, to let that performance run its course.

([Check out my blog](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/) or the [episodics notes page](http://geekorner.wordpress.com/episodic-observations) if you enjoy reading my stuff.)

> There's certainly a lot going on with Konatsu's father, the memory-ghost that haunts the sometimes cruel and often indifferent master. 

I'm wondering if the indifferent master actually *did* kill Konatsu's father, but had a good reason for doing so.  What if he was planning to sell Konatsu to cover his debt or something?
>> ARTICLE
Random point to make this note but needed a intermission for a cup of tea about 30 minutes into the episode. 

Watching the ep I had worries that the Rakugan would not be all that funny and just thought they would keep to highlight reels for it. I was surprised to see them do  a full show of it and that I was legitimately laughing along with the audience. Almost lost it at the line "I have 3 sick wives and a starving child at home." 

I think I needed that moment to show I could in some way care about the task the show is revolving around, so even though it could of been make or break, feel as though it was completely in the shows favour. 

So far this show seems fun, it's not the best premier of the season but it's definitely not the worst (Active Raid :P). 
Shall finish the episode then maybe update my thoughts. 
>> ARTICLE
Well that was far and away the best first episode of the new season shows I've seen so far.

Will DEEN finally be able redeen themselves?

I shall walk myself out.

50 minutes? And it's every episode, or just the first.

By the sounds of it, just the first.

I wish all of them were 50min.

Best episode so far, was beautiful, emotional, funny and the animation was even impressive at some points. Great start.
>> ARTICLE
I must admit I really wasn't too impressed at first with the rakugo aspect of it but man it just fits so well!  The way the characters give off so much information through their body language goes absolutely brilliantly with a rakugo theme!   

Also I legit feel bad for doubting DEEN on the animation because it was excellent.
>> ARTICLE
Whoo boy, I was expecting this to be good, but something this good? I'm stunned and delighted. 

This is a special, special show already. I hesitate to be overly excited and/or overly superlative about a show as a whole after only a single (double-length, to be fair) episode, but I think you can just *feel* that *Rakugo Shinju* is something different, and special.

Absolutely thrilled and excited for the rest of the show. It's going to be amazing.
>> ARTICLE
I had second thoughts about picking this up, being labeled as ~~shoujo~~ josei and let's be honest, DEEN? Booted the episode and what the hell - 47 minutes? Watched it whole, and...

No regrets. Honestly, I think it's better than ERASED, the only show so far that made me *wow, I want more right fucking now*. Dekigokoro was awesome. I totally thought [](/s "Yotaro will stay expelled") too.

Can't wait for episode 2. Another 40+ minutes? I fucking hope so.

On the side note, what the fuck are those MAL ratings? 7.33? Really? Well considering they're like 90% shonenshitters it's not *that* surprising.
>> ARTICLE
> On the side note, what the fuck are those MAL ratings? 7.33? Really? Well considering they're like 90% shonenshitters it's not that surprising.

MAL ratings are generally a mystery for me, but these initial-episode rankings are even more screwed up. The only non-sequel that actually did well with its premier is Erased, probably due to hype and popularity. Everything else is 6s and 7s, most of which will probably end up 7s and 8s as the more people gradually file their scores.

It's actually labeled as josei, which, as a 37 year old man who has been watching anime for almost 30 years, has become my favorite demographic.

Fixed, no idea why I thought of shoujo. Actually I know why.

I never realized how few Josei actually come out until I went to its MAL tag page and saw the abbreviation "CMPL" on more than half the items. We need more Josei.

Mid-40s here.  The josei tag has so many fewer data points than the others, but such a higher average.  It's almost to the point where it's an automatic watch-trigger for me.

Josei is definitely a must watch tag for me. It's just such a consistently good demographic/genre.

This is one of the anime I was really looking forward to after seeing the preview. The first episode was great, and really gets you interested in Rakugo. The characters look solid as well. I think this and Boku dake ga Inai Machi are going to be my favorite anime this season. 
>> ARTICLE
My head is spinning. I was really getting into his performance in the middle of the episode.

Didn't expect this at all and I'm happy I tried it.
>> ARTICLE
This was amazing. I knew from the summary that it was probably something I'd like, but it managed to exceed my every expectation. The characters, the dialogue, the voice acting, the character animation, the directing, the rakugo... I was laughing out loud during Yotarou's performance. Never expected that!

Yotarou himself is incredibly endearing. I need him to succeed, to achieve his dreams! Though that last thing Yakumo said at the end gave me some awful kinda foreshadowing. I hope everything works out.

I'll definitely be watching this!
>> ARTICLE
That was great and the premise is really interesting. The voice acting and animation fits well. I also liked the credits song a lot.

I didn't expect anything out of it and it's already one of my favorite anime this season.
>> ARTICLE
This was probably the show I looked forward to most this season, and the first episode did not disappoint at all!  

This episode did a great job of establishing the characters, and it made me feel really strongly for them. During the Thief story I was glued to the screen, laughing at the jokes and simultaneously being scared for the MC once he got to the part he had struggled with earlier. Then that end. It was an emotional roller-coaster for sure ;__;  
I'm also really interested in the characters we haven't seen much of yet. 

I'm also extremely happy that they actually took the time to show full performances instead of cutting halfway through! This was an extended episode, but I really really hope that they take the time for more full-length rakugo in future episodes too. 

The acting was superb too, and I mean that both in terms of voice acting and animation. 

Crossing my fingers for the next episodes <3 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this show was really great! I didn't know what to expect! Great visuals, sound, and rakugo was so interesting! I can't wait to hear the backstory on Sukeroku and Yakumo.

Every character felt great too! The dynamic between Konatsu, Yotaro and Yakumo was good, and their conversations were just right. Can't wait for the next episode! I'm guessing it will fall back to the usual 23 minutes though, which is unfortunate since I was captivated the whole time. I learned what they were doing, what rakugo was, without any need to go "oh hey we need to explain this, so let's go ahead and explain it!" (LOOKING AT YOU PHANTOM WORLD)

Seriously, more people need to be watching this.
>> ARTICLE
This was an absolutely masterful first episode. It felt like a short film and not just because of the length, the whole thing felt so incredibly refined. This is a show that is very confident in what it is even though it is exceptionally unique.
>> ARTICLE
Surprise AOTS without a doubt, Durarara!! would have to be *really* good to surpass this. 

I'm curious as how close the depicted rakugo performances are to real ones. 
>> ARTICLE
Gotta give props to Studio Deen here. Clearly they aren't always the best when it comes to animation but they handled the setting and the character acting very well in this episode. Definitely on of my favorites of the season so far. 
>> ARTICLE
Oh wow, I think we've got the best first episode of the season right here. Like you can't even tell this is a Deen show at *all*. Also I think I've fallen in love with the main character already.
>> ARTICLE
Like I've been trying to tell people this entire thread, DEEN was, once upon a time, a very well respected studio that put out a lot of top quality material. It's only very recently that they've developed a bit of a bad reputation.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, technically yes, but you could say the same about e.g. JC Staff (they did *Utena*) or Xebec. But that pedigree doesn't mean much when even their *best* recent output looks like crap. As much as I may have enjoyed Hakkenden or Meganebu, they all still have a certain staleness to their animation which is almost entirely lacking here. 
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, I suppose I just never got on board the hate train for DEEN.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, I don't necessarily *hate* them. (They're pretty much the only studio that consistently animates BL, so I'm kinda stuck with them.) But within the last decade most of their shows look very similar, in that you could very often tell it was Deen just from looking at a screencap. (Not unlike KyoAni, just with a bad reputation. Though this is definitely a way better show than KyoAni's this season.) 
>> ARTICLE
This episode looks really good, I'm just a little scared it won't stay that way since this is apparently just the 2 OVAs bundled together as 1 episode. 

I hope I'm wrong though and the quality stays consistent.

Edit: Wow, Tomokazu Seki does a great job as Yotaro, impressive perfomance.

Edit 2: Damn, really great first episode, very mature and unique. Definitley my AOTS so far alongside Boku dake ga Inai Machi.

>> ARTICLE
Wow, this started off bizarre as hell, seeing as I had zero idea what to expect.  Halfway through it really started to come together though.  Pretty interesting SoL with a heavier undertone.  I wonder how the story will unfold in ep2.  The VAs sort of really carry this, although I hope the MC Yotaru dude gets a little more variation / depth to his personality.

This show feels like it has a good *tide* of storytelling, like I'm being sucked into an ocean.  Should be interesting.
>> ARTICLE
this show is going to be something special.
>> ARTICLE
This was one of the anime I was quite looking forward to this season, based on its premise alone. 

And this episode didn't disappoint in the slightest. The mature theme is quite welcome, and the storytelling is superb. The characters are intriguing, and the art superb.

The 47 min length of the episode was fitting as well. Can't wait to see where this goes.  

(And the music. I loved the jazz. So great.)

Holy shit, I did not expect that. Went in blind by the title and the picture on Crnchyroll, expecting it to be dry and boring, but it's my favorite this season so far.

The length really helped too, you could really feel that they had enough time to stretch their legs a bit rather than cut and rush to the next plot point.
>> ARTICLE
***Best anime of the season!***

I liked everything about the first episode.The music was great and I just couldn't stop laughing was the main character did his performance.I even stayed for the ending because of it's background music.The dialogue between the characters felt very natural and I even liked the drama  of the chracters.I hope this anime won't dissappoint me.
>> ARTICLE
This is my AOTS already. It felt half as long as it actually was, and the dialogue was just fantastic. I think I like rakugo now. Can't wait for next week.

Who'd have thought DEEN would save anime?
>> ARTICLE
How's the animation for this one? I'm always skeptical on DEEN shows :(.
>> ARTICLE
I think it looks good, it's no One Punch Man or Fate but it doesn't look horrible imo. But you best see for yourself.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, it's okay, I don't want anything on those levels of quality, anything that is above cringe-inducing like the original fate/stay night or higurashi is fine by me. I'll check it out, thanks! 
>> ARTICLE
I thought Higurashi looked decent. Actually, I think that the overly expressive faces added to the creepyness factor, but maybe that's just me.
>> ARTICLE
No, I totally agree. The way the characters looked a bit off really complimented the show, because it really sold them as being [completely unhinged](http://i.imgur.com/VT0LYHR.png). Not all anime has to be KyoAni levels of smooth moe. :o 
>> ARTICLE
I know DEEN has a bad rep on this sub, but I will always remember them for being stellar back in the days: Patlabor, You're Under Arrest, Ranma 1/2, Ruroni Kenshin, just to name a few. I'm still watching the simulcast, but I have no complaints about anything so far.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying they always suck! I just usually ask first instead of delving in, since it's a very simple question to answer! :P
>> ARTICLE
Just like with every other anime studio the quality of each series they create depends heavily on the staff working on it. A few years ago lots of people from Studio Shaft left and joined Studio DEEN (some people argue it's because head director Shimbo gets all the credit despite not being heavily involved a lot of times which put some staff members off). This is why some of DEEN's more recent series like Sankarea, Rozen Maiden and Sakura Trick felt very reminiscent of works by Shaft.

The director in charge of this anime is Shinichi Omata who did some work for Arakawa under the Bridge, Hidamari Sketch, Madoka Magica and other Shaft anime, but only got promoted to being a main director when he moved to DEEN, presumably allowing him more creative freedom. Times a-changing and so is Studio DEEN, which is why I'm always inclined to check out their shows that have this particular set of people in charge  ;) 
>> ARTICLE
That's a very informative reply, thank you! :)

I'll be checking it out already though, but TIL I guess!
>> ARTICLE
it's *incredible*. there's a scene in the middle that lasts for 10 or so minutes that's some movie quality stuff in terms of emotive body language.
>> ARTICLE
Is it good enough to forgive the part 10 years?

Edit: chill guys. Yeah, Deen has had a few decent looking shows, but they've ruined a lot of really good shows with their shitty art and animation.
>> ARTICLE
Which shows did they ruin? (I'm just curious)
>> ARTICLE
Fate, Log Horizon, and a bunch of anime originals.
>> ARTICLE
Nothing that was particularly worth watching in the first place. 
>> ARTICLE
I heard Sakura Trick looked pretty good. Haven't seen it so I can't confirm.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I thought it looked below average.
>> ARTICLE
To each their own I guess, that's just what I heard multiple times in this sub.

Well, at least this show actually looks pretty good.
>> ARTICLE
DEEN's always been really good at their shoujo/josei stuff though. Marimite and Sakura ~~Kiss~~ Trick, for example, while mostly understated, had some beautifully done sequences that really brought out the emotional core of a given scene, while Hybrid Child, though ignored by many for being Shounen-ai, was probably the most gorgeous Meiji-era period piece of the last decade since their last work in the genre, Samurai X. they mostly get slack for Log Horizon S2, Fate/Stay, and Higurashi, but when they're handling low-action character dramas they do body language very well, better than a lot of studios.
>> ARTICLE
> Sakura Kiss

I think you mean Sakura Trick.
>> ARTICLE
you're right, fixed. I can think of [a few reasons](http://youtu.be/uCWmVE25jfI) why the word "kiss" came to mind, though. ;P
>> ARTICLE
That looks really cute, might have to check it out at some point.
>> ARTICLE
Ohhh, good! Gonna take a look then, thanks for answering! :)
>> ARTICLE
There is a Japanese drama that has a very similar premise to this show if you are interested in rakugo.

It's called Tiger & Dragon - http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Tiger_%26_Dragon
>> ARTICLE
Worth a watch? seems quite long, will wait on feedback
>> ARTICLE
I think it is, but this show is obviously not for everyone. If you don't want a lot of dialogue, then this might not be your thing. The MC gives a long performance in the middle of the episode, but I can see why many would be plain bored of it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes. Give it a try.
>> ARTICLE
I went in not realizing it was double-length, and when it just kept going and going...it just brought me into the world. Amazing.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah after had watching 5-6 other animes prior to finally getting to this, I sall the length of it and knew if i went into it, i would most likely drop it half way through or something. Good to know it sucks you in, i'll watch it first thing tomorrow
>> ARTICLE
I felt the pacing was a bit off at the beginning, but once the characters were established it found a right pace. I wasn't expecting such a long runtime (this felt like three episodes mashed together), but hopefully I'll come to appreciate it. For the time being, I'll continue with this show.
>> ARTICLE
goof stuff right here
>> ARTICLE
It was an amazing first episode. We have a new Kuchuu Buranko this season.
>> ARTICLE
These were the two OVA's released last year, I'm really glad they were included. All three main voice actors brought their A-game, just splendid acting. The storyboarding did an impressive job of emphasizing the body language and voice inflection. It really brought the story telling performance to life.
>> ARTICLE
Was this episode the OVA? According to [AniDB](https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=10773) there are a 45 min and a 35 min OVA.
>> ARTICLE
It's basically a condensed summary of both OVAs. 
>> ARTICLE
Wow, so good.  
Seki Tomozaku really nailed it!
>> ARTICLE
If they pair the credits song with some nice visuals it is going to make for a fantastic OP or ED.
>> ARTICLE
I had no idea this was 47 minutes long, I was so confused as to why it felt like this episode was taking so damn long.

Pleasantly surprised, I didn't expect to like a show about rakugo so much, despite my only "experience" with it being Joshiraku.
>> ARTICLE
The sketch comedy the series focuses on isn't really my thing, honestly, but i can respect what the voice actors are doing with it.
>> ARTICLE
Welp, looks like unexpected AOTS appeared. I love seeing something unlike anything I've ever seen before.
>> ARTICLE
Had no expectations when I started watching but was I happy to watch this, something about the atmosphere of the show is so on point and fresh, just amazing.
>> ARTICLE
The music used in this episode was perfect! Still only about halfway through but I have to say I am in love with it so far! 
>> ARTICLE
This was great, didn't even feel like 50 minutes. 
>> ARTICLE
That moment when the best anime of the season is DEEN.

SASUGA DEEN!  

Seriously though this was probably the most original series I've seen in quite a while, and I do say I love anime with long-length episodes too.  Usually what happens with Deen shows is that they get an anime with a good premise but fuck up the animation, this show though everything looks pretty good.  Nothing flashy, but it doesn't need to be since it wouldn't fit in the context of the story.  Damn, Deen seriously has a hit on their hands guys!
>> ARTICLE
Wasn't expecting much since all I read was the description. Was blown away but how good it was. I watched a few other anime that was released this week before this and I didn't notice that the episode was 47 mins long. Can't wait for the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
This is a DEEN work.....?  Holy fuck well done!  I like the look of the show, it's got an interesting premise and I already want to see the MC succeed.  Definitely watching this.
>> ARTICLE
It was like watching Barry Lyndon. Gorgeous.
>> ARTICLE
Oh man, this first episode is amazingly beautiful! The voice acting for this show is incredibly superb and Tomokazu Seki's rakugo presentation in the middle was so amazingly presented, there's no words to describe how beautiful it was. Akira Ishida and Yu Kobayashi also had stellar performances in this episode! In particular, Akira Ishida's rakugo is pretty interesting, but Tomokazu Seki just stole the show with his mid-episode rakugo.
On the topic of Tomokazu Seki, I believe that he was the perfect choice for being the main character of this anime. The unique emotions he brings to his roles is so amazing that they're so memorable. The first time he blew me away was in Fushigi Yugi OVA as Chichiri. The way he just shifts from a nonsensical comedic monk to a man trapped by his past is just so amazing, it blows my mind! It totally makes me happy that I got to see Tomokazu Seki deliver another stellar performance in an anime.
>> ARTICLE
Damn what a good season this is :')
>> ARTICLE
Holy shit this anime is captivating!
>> ARTICLE
Damn, the DEEN stuff has really fallen into meme territory here. Most of their works over the years have been done on tighter schedules and with more outsourced staff.

This, Sakura Trick and a few other stand out shows are the ones that employ in-house staff to the point where you can actually call it a DEEN work. With new staff members who moved from SHAFT and a strong crew, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinju is about as DEEN as they come. Despite the outdated reputation.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, daaaaaayum.  
This is a good show. I'm calling it right now. Easily AOTS material. No other show this season has got me to care as deeply about its characters as this one did so easily. I already feel like I know Yotarou personally.  
The directing is great too. I never thought watching one guy sit on a stage and talk for over 5 minutes would be actually engaging, but there you go. It's honestly pretty weird that the best-made show is by DEEN of all people.
>> ARTICLE
Wtf DEEN. You really outdid yourself there.

This is a genuinely amazing show, easily my favorite of the season so far.

The characters are so unique, and the way they talk to each other and interact is so intriguing. I could listen to them talk for hours. 

Second, the director/direction of this show is insane. It managed to keep me interested for about 10 minutes by just having a person talking. And its not like the visuals were portrayed in an imaginary way, we just saw a man sitting down telling a story for 10 minutes. Yet, it captivated me in an amazing way. Whether it be the acting, the animation, the scene changes, the slideshow-esque animation, I was amazed. 

I enjoy the shoujo inspired art style a lot too. Not only does it add to this realistic Josei styled show, I really enjoyed the colors overall. They were really calming for a calming show.

The decision to make this a 47 minute first episode was also a great one. I was skeptical at first, but after seeing the story this way, I couldn't imagine it any other way. After watching that, a viewer would instantly be able to tell if they would like the show or not. It did a really good job of being a first episode, laying out what the show is.
>> ARTICLE
I realized this show was something special when midway through the MC's rakugo performance , I looked at myself as if I took a step outside of my body and realized that I'm arched forward with my head tilted slightly up just absolutely enjoying the voice and storytelling, as if I was a 5 year old kid all over again leaning forward listening to one of those suspenseful scary stories.

I initially thought it was 20 minutes, it didn't hit me that I've been watching 50 minutes worth of anime until I saw the clock on my computer.
>> ARTICLE
This anime is really great, it's a shame no one really seems to be talking about it anywhere...

"Meh. Konosuba generic ecchi, shit DEEN lol"

It's not the studio that decided if an anime gets a sequel, it's the production committee.

I would've laughed at you for saying this like, last year. 
>> ARTICLE
tssss, this isn't even the first time [Deen saves anime...](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20047/Sakura_Trick)
>> ARTICLE
No fucking way. With those sales? Respect, DEEN
>> ARTICLE
Some anime get sequels for reasons other than BD sales. Chihayafuru got a second season mainly because it boosted the manga's sales.

>Respect, DEEN

It's the production committee, not the studio, that decided whether an anime gets a sequel.
>> ARTICLE
Mostly likely a planned split cour. If that's the case, a 2nd season is going be made whether it's selling well or not. Also keep in mind disc sales is not the be all and end all.
>> ARTICLE
That said, poor sales can mean that the second cour is given less attention and rushed out the gate to save costs.

It would be funny but a little sad if the animation quality of Shouwa Rakugo and KonoSuba flipped on their second seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Not much to flop on Konosuba. 
>> ARTICLE
flip, not flop. As in KonoSuba as a highly successful show gets given more budget, while Rakugo is given the shaft.
>> ARTICLE
Oh no. Yeah. That wouldn't be good. I hope they keep Rakugo the amazingly animated backgrounds and the wonderful music still. 
>> ARTICLE
Did it sell that badly? I haven't been paying attention. Oh well, KonoSuba can fund the way.

[**Thanks fam**](#quality)
>> ARTICLE
Historically josei has always sold poorly, right? There aren't many adult women who would care to collect anime BDs. I think this anime exists more for the sake of manga sales.
>> ARTICLE
tbf, the first volume sold about 2,214 which is pretty close to the Manabi line right out the gates, and thats with the fact that volume 1 only shipped with the episode 1 OVA and the second episode. all things considered, even with a massive drop off it's aiming to sell about average which, by DEEN standards, is good enough. 
>> ARTICLE
Did it have good ratings on TV perhaps?
>> ARTICLE
Late-night anime pay for the timeslot rather than the broadcaster paying for content (think of it as if it was a 30 minute commercial), so ratings don't really matter much to the bottom line. The producers are not making any significant money from eyeballs at 2:30am.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, the only really notable exception to this is anime that air on NHK, which is a public broadcasting company. Ratings actually matter more than sales for them, which is why you'll see shows like Kyoukai no Rinne getting a second season even though the disc sales were horrible.
>> ARTICLE
Well, bless DEEN for continuing it even though the first season has a pretty conclusive end. They are the true saviors of 2016.
>> ARTICLE
earlier this year it was announced that the manga was ending later this year, which means we'll see the full conclusion to the Yotarou arc in season 2 and a complete experience overall!! I'm so stoked on it. <3

Like /u/vetro said, those screenshots seem to be screenshots of the last episode. Also, [the mangaka tweeted about it after she talked about the season 1's final episode.](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-01/showa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-anime-gets-2nd-season/.100561)

Isn't the mangaka a woman?

Yeah, I wrote that on my phone. It was a typo, my Swiftkey keyboard suggests two words sometimes.

The last episode is today so I'm guessing this announcement was part of it.
>> ARTICLE
Production committee:

* King Records
* Kodansha
* MBS

Deen just produces the animation. They have nothing to do with deciding this second season.
>> ARTICLE
> They have nothing to do with deciding this second season.

I mean, they're the ones physically making it. They kind of need to be on-board to do it again too, and I'm sure the production committee would reconsider if everyone involved decided to quit and they had to bring in completely unrelated people to fill all the positions.
>> ARTICLE
Studio switches happen. Main creative staff usually are freelancers so they can be brought in to work with a different studio. If a studio for whatever reason don't want to do a 2nd season at all it's not going to stop the producers from making another season if they really want one.

This 2nd season of Shouwa was likely a planned split-cour and might have been decided as that before DEEN was even brought in.
>> ARTICLE
They'd just find a new studio. And studios rarely reject a guaranteed paycheck.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah. Those production companies are like the managers and coaches of the playing team. But Deen is like the players on the field actually winning the game for their owners.

Deen is on a roll. It's crazy.  
  
2016 is/was their year, with Rakugo and Konosuba, now both getting a second season. With Swagamoto poised to make some big waves.

It seems that might be the case, as posted [above](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4cx1a5/shouwa_genroku_rakugo_shinjuu_season_2_announced/d1m2160) it  looks like season one adapts up to volume 5 and that there will be a total of 10 volumes.

Alright, cool. Thanks!

YES! S2 will start with the present with Yotarou and Konatsu! I'm so happy right now, this is my AOTS and I've been told the manga gets even better.

Nice! This makes it the 3rd Winter Deen Anime to get a 2nd season announced like this!

[](#rengehype)

I wonder what made them announce it so soon though.

[](#curious)

I suppose should check out the manga sales. I have heard that the manga is ending though [from ANN.](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-05/showa-genroku-rakugo-shinju-manga-to-end-in-10th-volume/.98363) It's ending in its 10th volume, so the manga will actually be done before the 2nd season starts. 
>> ARTICLE
My understanding is that the manga is 10 volumes, and this season covered the first 5.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, I see. That's good since they can cover the last 5 volumes in the 2nd season. I was worried that some content would get unadapted. Thanks for the information!

Welcome back to the surface DEEN. It sure has been awhile since you were up here with the rest of the world. If only Toei, Pierrot, and OLM could join us up here.
>> ARTICLE
Aaaaaand A1
>> ARTICLE
I want them to stay in that pit. I dislike A1 as a studio more than I dislike the shows from them I have watched. They just put so little effort into what they adapt. Yeah it looks good and is well animated usually, but that is the extent of what they do. Just look at what David Productions has been doing to JoJo, it is a much better adaptation than it has any right of being because of all of the effort put into every single aspect of the show, from music down to small easter egg details added in that were never even in the source material to tie things in.
>> ARTICLE
I wasn't aware of the hate for A1 here, since theyve made in the past year alone: Working!!!, Erased, and Your Lie in April.  But you're right, this is the kind of thing I hated about Your Lie in April.  They made it look so pretty but when it came to the characters actually playing the music they made no effort to make their playing unique.  Compare to a show like Nodame where you often hear two different characters play different interpretations of the same piece, giving you a much greater sense of the characters and their musical inclinations.

Marathoning KonoSuba right now and waiting for the last episode to be posted to Crunchyroll (15 minutes feels like forever), but this season made me really re-evaluate my personal view on Studio DEEN. Rakugo has been an amazing journey and I definitely want to see how the story expands through the present timeline as I assume S2 would turn around and focus on how Yotaro is trained and comes into his own as a Rakugo master in his own right.

I've loved the near season-long flashback to Kikuhiko's own journey though so it'll still be really bittersweet to send Rakugo off for however long it takes for S2 to come out.

Studio DEEN is so fucking based!

FUCK YES. I loved the show this season and I'm excited to get back to our boy Yotarou. I missed Tomokazu Seki's voice.

Okay, now that I've calmed down a bit...

I was convinced this wasn't possible. I hoped it would happen, but part of me was certain that we were plenty lucky to get what we got and that I shouldn't complain about DEEN not making miraculous and inexplicable renewal decisions in my favor.

I should've had more faith! Thank you, based DEEN, for being like the best studio of the year or something. You've been hitting it out of the park so far! And when I read the news like I legit teared up I'm so happy I'm...

This is the best timeline.

What the hell is up with DEEN? They are producing quality shows back to back. 

God damn messiah!

Yeah, I really like the Jazzy style, and the Visuals are very reminiscent of the show too. The song actually relates to the show, which I feel is actually sort of rare for shows nowadays.

Really? At 3 minutes I was sure that was the full song. :/ From what I gather in the description, the single goes on sale next month. Apparently it's the song I linked to, plus one more as well as off-vocals.    
I can't find anything there about the song I linked to being a short version though, and songs are often broadcast in full before singles are released.   
Do you have a different source on that/am I overlooking something?

It's definitely one of the darkhorse shows of the season. I'm actually surprised more people aren't taking up on it. It does look a bit clich on the surface, but its great sense of humor and parody of the genre is really smartly done.

I thought it would be just an average anime like most of the anime from last season, but it was pretty funny. I loved the parody aspect of the show. The first episode was okish, but it made me want to watch more.

I wanted to -- really, I did -- but Hige is as dense as he is big, so that means the romance is going where I do not want it to go: nowhere.

Really nice comparison. Seriously.

If you'd have told me last year that A1 and DEEN would be putting out relatively interesting, creative shows while KyoAni and PA Works were pushing out uninspired crap this season, I'd have told you that you were crazy. This season is bonkers
>> ARTICLE
Well Konasuba is uninspired crap. Its as generic as anything else, combined with bad art work.

I think people want to call it a parody to justify calling it good but it isnt a parody at all. It is exactly that uninspired crap.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen any of Konasuba besides that clip on the front page today. I was referring solely to Rakugo, a show you definitely haven't watched if you didn't make the connection
>> ARTICLE
Forgot that was by DEEN.
>> ARTICLE
Doesn't give off much a DEEN-y vibe, so I don't blame you.
>> ARTICLE
it is a parody of the common MMO anime, basically Konosuba is making fun of MMO aspect in backstory of him getting there, character creation, grinding instead of going through them normally they do it in a stupid way. that is simply what is called as parody.
>> ARTICLE
Except it isnt making fun of any of those things it simply is those things.

being a comedy is not being a parody. There is zero sense of "isnt it odd how they do this?" Its just telling its own version of that exact same story.
>> ARTICLE
Whether or not it rises to parody/deconstruction/insertbuzzwordhere levels, Konosuba is a pretty obviously comedic take on the whole "Guy in an MMO" trope, which I'd say is rare as most of them take themselves pretty seriously.  You're welcome to not like it, or not find it funny or a variety of things -- but you need to list a couple of shows that fall in the same column as it before I buy that it's uninspired and generic.
>> ARTICLE
Comedy and guy in an MMO?

You mean like DanMachi?

Almost every thing it does outside of the specific way in which he ends up in a gamified world has been done before. The chuuni character is exactly the same as nearly all chuuni girls in anime.

It certainly is not a parody by any means, but that is an easy excuse to use to claim that this is better than all the stuff it is exactly the same as.
>> ARTICLE
KonoSuba is literally a parody.... what the hell are you smoking?  That's *exactly* what it is.  DanMachi was not a parody, it just had comedic aspects.

So far, KonoSuba has played out as a straight comedy and nothing else.  Maybe that will change, but for the moment that's what it is.  I know of no other straight comedies of note about being trapped in a game.
>> ARTICLE
Then explain what makes Konasuba a parody and danmachi a comedy.

Please.

It hasnt done anything other gamified world and trapped in the mmo games havent done.
>> ARTICLE
DanMachi *is not a strict comedy*.  Konosuba is, or at least so far has been, a strict comedy.  DanMachi just has comedic moments in the show, but it is not a comedy.

It's a very simple difference to understand.  Everything that occurs in KonoSuba has been setup for a joke.  That is a comedy.  It is using said comedy to parody all the "stuck in an MMO" clones that have come out as of late.  Not everything in DanMachi is a joke, much of it is intended to be taken seriously.  Yeah, in reality the difference between a comedy and not a comedy isn't so clearly defined, but that's the general idea, and KonoSuba has *firmly* planted itself in comedy/parody territory.  KonoSuba so far has existed to make you laugh, and has never deviated from that fact.

A parody is simply deliberate use of a particular style to exaggerated effect, which is what KonoSuba is doing.  It's exaggerating what it is like to play as a party in an MMO and how silly of an idea it is to want to be stuck in one.

I mean, part of me thinks you have to be trolling here.  Something is wrong with your brain if you really can't tell that KonoSuba is a parody.  I don't know how it could be any *more* of a parody if it tried...?
>> ARTICLE
Except it hasn't really exaggerated anything. It's doing exactly the same thing all of those shows do. There is no "turning it up to 11" or anything.

It's just doing the exact same jokes, with less depth. It's the lack of depth that makes you feel it's "pure comedy".

The jokes it makes aren't even in the realm of being original. They've all been done before.

For instance, the mage is just a shittier, setting appropriate version of Rikka from Chu2.

Parody needs to actually exaggerate something, not just make mildly adjusted copies.
>> ARTICLE
................. okay no, you have to be a troll.  I refuse to believe anyone is this blind.

Giant frog NPCs fucking eating a character without killing her and covering her in slime after she forsook her *healing* roll to melee with the monster and failed...... nothing in that statement is exaggerated to you?  Like... you have to be fucking with me, I can't believe anything else.  That's how you think typical MMO games/shows play out?  Really?  I guess I'll have to remember that next time I watch Grimar or SAO or whatever and someone dies and everyone goes, "ahahhaha look, he/she just got eaten, how fucking hilarious!"

The mage blowing all her energy to nuke one frog to death and then get eaten as well, that's a common MMO story trait is it?  Not exaggerated in the least.  Or a masochistic tank.  Totally not exaggerated.  Am I getting Poe's lawed right now?
>> ARTICLE
It's not more exaggerated than the "genre" is known for.

> The mage blowing all her energy to nuke one frog to death and then get eaten as well, that's a common MMO story trait is it? Not exaggerated in the least. Or a masochistic tank. Totally not exaggerated. Am I getting Poe's lawed right now?

So then you didn't read what I wrote at all...so I'll say it again.

>> ARTICLE
A1 has always been one of my favorite studios and I feel it gets so much negative flack for some reason. DEEN also has been hiring a lot of powerhouse talent th epast few years, so it was bound to happen that they would get a hit. I think PA Works is really in a transition period where they don't have that much budget for their show this season. It has a good premise but its low production value really hurts it. I think KyoAni's show may be a tad schlocky but it could have its ups if it continues to have more character centric episodes like the latest one.
>> ARTICLE
Because since they release SAO and it became a hit they release like 4 SAO clones and 1 decent-to-amazing series every year.
>> ARTICLE
Most studios essentially assemble a bunch of different freelancers for each individual show, it's wrong to assume that the same people from a studio are working on all its series. You can never really know what you're going to get. And the studios aren't really responsible for the material they adapt either, that's the production committees job. So there's nothing to prevent a studio from adapting a good anime one season and a bad one the next. They also aren't responsible for deciding whether a series will get a sequel, again, that's the production committee (so stop yelling at Madhouse).

KyoAni is the main exception to all of this (they do everything in house and usually sit on the production committee for the anime they adapt), and yeah, I am surprised to see them adapting such garbage.
>> ARTICLE
Well Kyoani and PA both have very important shows for them at later this year.
>> ARTICLE
For sure. The whole anime industry has gone crazy. It switches so often where some companies make bad anime to jaw-dropping ones. Like A1 made Vividred operation(*shudders), Your Lie in April, and Silver spoon. I was not expecting something this dark and serious from them. Erased is a solid must watch. 
>> ARTICLE
Your name is hilarious! :3

> ...I'd have told you that you were crazy. This season is bonkers

*All* studios have their ups and their downs. I wrote about PA Works experiencing this -- GlassLip, Charlotte -- but KyoAni is the same way -- Beyond the Boundary (granted, BtB is nowhere *near* as awful as PA Works lows; plus, BtB has one of the [best EDs of all-time!](http://b.1339.cf/tfyxizx.webm)) I think PW will end up the same as BtB: pretty average, but by no means horrible.

On the flip-side, A1 can make some pretty great stuff -- Your Lie in April, Shinsekai Yori -- as can DEEN -- Ruroni Kenshin (disclaimer: I have never seen it, but it is popular/rated highly enough) and Sakura Trick.

Oh, absolutely. I'm pretty sure PA Works is *the* most well-known example of this with Nagi no Asukara -> Glasslip -> Shirobako -> Charlotte. But how am I gonna rake in the dank karmie points while giving studios the benefit of the doubt?
>> ARTICLE
> I think PW will end up the same as BtB: pretty average, but by no means horrible.

I would hope PW gets up to KnK's range... KnK at least gave us the aforementioned amazing ED, one of the best filler episodes, a pretty heavy and emotional ending to the TV show, a great ship, and a wonderfully animated movie! 
>> ARTICLE
> ...one of the best filler episodes...

How could I forget! You are totally right, that is one of the best filler episodes of all-time.

(Thinking on it more, BtB has a lot of "best of all-time"'s from me...)

And doing even more thinking, you might be right; in the end, PW will probably end up lower than BtB.

So long as I get my Mai fill, though, I am good-to-go. :3
>> ARTICLE
> a pretty heavy and emotional ending to the TV show

[Spoiler: TV show finale](/s "Until the author/kyoani decided that instead of leaving Mirai dead or pulling a SAO, they said: "Fuck this, she is alive now. FIN."
The last 2 episodes weren't as good as the others but this was what really made me upset about the whole show.")

I was so ready to accept THE outcome but then they pulled THAT ending -_-
>> ARTICLE
Deen is doing the highly-anticipated Sakamoto-san show next season, too (which by many accounts will be fantastic even if they just adapt it note-for-note). Who knows, maybe this is the "year of Deen"!
>> ARTICLE
I was actually really disappointed when I initially learned DEEN was doing Sakamoto-san, but then Rakugo happened. Now I can raise my expectations to impossible degrees and not look like a moron!
>> ARTICLE
Funnily enough, usually when this happens we can be all like "ah, but the studio doesn't matter as much as we all pretend it does, it's all about the people, right!"

But in this case, I can't do that! Rokugo is only the second series directed by Omata Shinichi (after Sankarea way back in 2012, which was... not amazing) and the rest of his credits are nothing major (the best would be being episode director for two episodes of Arakawa Under the Bridge and one of Madoka Magica). Rokugo's screenwriter (and composition), meanwhile, is Kumagai Jun, who previously worked on the *masterpieces* of writing that are Valvrave the Liberator, Nobunaga the Fool and Aquarian Logos. And then the Art Director (Mayuzumi Masaki)'s previous work as art director was on AoharuXMachinegun, a show so forgettable you probably don't remember it only aired two seasons ago. 

So *not only* is this from Studio Deen, one of the most lauded studios still in the business (by western fans, anyways), but all the top staff are veering between "not notable" and "has a portfolio of crap". By all rights this show should really, really suck ... but it doesn't! 

How does this happen??!!! Somehow Deen found a way...

Then they not only announce Sakamoto for next season, but they've now announced that the director is going to be Takamatsu Shinji, who unlike the Rokugo guy *is* a known and well-regarded director (previous director credits include Gintama, Daily Lives of High School Boys, School Rumble and a ton of Gundam)... yeah, I'm hella excited for Sakamoto desu ga and I don't care if my expectations are through the roof!!!
>> ARTICLE
Shinichi is a lot more than just "A guy who did a few episodes", he's a SHAFT storyboard artist, which certainly means something when you regard who he's trained under. The transition from storyboard artist to director isn't a rare one and he's managed to take both the director and storyboard role for Rakugo.
>> ARTICLE

Right, it's not uncommon at all for a storyboard artist to move up to being an episode director, and likewise it's common for someone who has been an episode director for several projects to give the main director role a try, too. But that's exactly why I don't see it as any particular promise of directorial skill or quality. There are TONS of storyboard artists, at SHAFT and elsewhere, who work their way up and eventually take the director chair, and many of them are *not* good at it (especially with their first few shows - many will gradually improve and become much better later on, of course). So simply being a SHAFT storyboard artist is not that much of a credit to his name when anticipating his directorship - there's lots of other SHAFT storyboard artists that have never moved onto that position or that have and have flopped.

Obviously with hindsight now we can look at Rokugo and say "Yup, this Omata Shinichi guy is new but he's got some skills. Maybe he learned a lot of that from working under Miyamoto Yukihiro several times?"

But a month ago, before Rokugo first aired, if you had said "Hey, this Rokugo show coming up is going to be great! Don't worry that it's being made by Studio Deen, and that the director's only previous director credit is Sankarea, because he did two episodes of storyboards for Madoka Magica! Oh, and he's the animation producer of Sex Ward, Love Doll, Officer Affairs, Sins of the Flesh, and Slave Sisters! This is going to be such a great show full of well-crafted, mature character studies!" it would have been very difficult to believe.

Drop Assassination Classroom for having an absurd premise?.... All I can say to that is welcome to anime? If this is your 1st time on this ride you can get off at the giant mechs throwing galaxies at each other and summoning drill power :/
>> ARTICLE
> Drop Assassination Classroom for having an absurd premise?.... All I can say to that is welcome to anime?

There is just something about a bunch of kids becoming assassins then not using their assassination skills at all times to take out this dude who is going to blow up the Earth yet he is evidently one of the nicest things ever. All wrapped in a very childish approach to comedy and story.

For these reasons, I say to drop this one faster than a hotplate!!!

Edit: Wrong celestial body!
>> ARTICLE
>  then not using their assassination skills at all times to take out this dude

...aren't they? 

I mean, yeah, they're not doing it quite as often as they did in the first few episodes, but that makes sense, they tried all the obvious spur-of-the-moment tactics and failed! So now they are more focused on big elaborate plans that utilize their numbers and variety of skills rather than hoping to land a lucky shot after the first 789036 shots were easily dodged. 

And even then, they're not entirely sticking to that MO either. [Really vague, minor spoilers](/s "E.g. in the latest episode, while Koro-sensei is busy moving around dealing with a different situation, Karma pulls out his knife and tries to hit Koro-sensei while he's distracted, and hence some of Koro-sensei's flash-clones have a troubled expression as they try to dodge that, too. But the show doesn't call attention to it at all, it's just a little subtle thing happening in the background. That's not the only instance of a minor in-the-moment assassination attempt going on in the background, though yeah I do wish there were more of them.")
>> ARTICLE
> So now they are more focused on big elaborate plans that utilize their numbers and variety of skills rather than hoping to land a lucky shot after the first 789036 shots were easily dodged.

I don't know how I missed this comment! I apologize.

Truth be told, I am being picky, but what I mean by "not using their assassination skills at all times to take out this dude" is *always* trying to take this dude out. Time is literally of the essence and Koro-sensei is literally going to blow up the Earth unless they stop him. Meaning, they should be taking advantage of *every single opportunity*, no matter how small.

So when [AssClass Season Two Spoilers](/s "after fending off Itona and he says, 'I'm pooped. Time for a little rest,' and he is clearly weaker than he has been compared to lately, them *not* making a move at that moment seems so silly to me.")

There is also [AssClass Season Two Spoilers](/s "when they stop Itona's captors from firing their bullets at Itona. That has the side effect of helping Koro-sensei, the exact opposite of what they need to be doing. But this one makes more sense because if they don't stop these bad guys that will cause too much harm to Itona in the process.")

I think it all comes down to me hating how asinine the situation is. How these kids are meant to grow and change in a positive way through this dude, yet they are meant to kill him also. If they don't kill him, then everybody dies, yet they really like him a lot so they don't want to kill him because he is "Koro-sensei."

Hopefully the twist/reveal later will fix -- or at the minimum relieve -- some of my criticism towards the anime, but for now, I do not see it as an anime worth touting.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, those are all valid points. But I think you're basically outlining the core premise of the entire show there. I don't think there's really a way to do the Assassination element constantly without significantly paring down the Classroom element as a consequence, lessening the bond between Koro-sensei and the students, and removing all the themes related to the bullying, despair and ostracism of the students. 

That could also be a very good show in its own way, but I think a big part of what does make Assassination Classroom great is that it does tackle the Classroom side of things, that it actually shows and deals with issues related to the characters beings students and teenagers, while so many other school-setting action shows just ignore the school setting outright and pretend their teenage characters are mature, self-sufficient adults. If it needs to sacrifice some realism on the Assassination side, I'm okay with that... and I think it did a pretty good job preparing me for that when the government equipped all the students with special BB pellets that *somehow* can only hurt their teacher and literally nothing else.

It would be cool to see a show that is entirely focused upon assassinating one ultra-powerful figure, though. That'd be a fun premise, and possibly even better if it was done with adult characters who are already competent assassins (in a variety of styles) at the start of the show and we simply get to follow them through several different plans and types of attacks as they gauge the abilities of their target and become more and more effective at beating the target's defenses.
>> ARTICLE
To be fair they did try harder before they got to know him. I'm pretty sure it's hard to kill the only guy, er, thing that actually thinks you'll amount to anything.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm pretty sure it's hard to kill the only guy, er, thing that actually thinks you'll amount to anything.

This is true!

But Koro-sensei has no reason to blow up the Earth. He can just be nice to them and teach them and everyone can be super happy without all of the lame and futile assassination attempts.

Now, the argument (I am guessing, because I do not know) is that "there is a reason why he is simultaneously being super nice and wanting to blow up the Earth, they just have not shown/explained it yet." And *that* is a HUGE problem. After twenty-five episodes, the only thing we know about Koro-sensei is one tiny, muddied flashback that happened way back in the beginning of the first season. I get that they are trying to make it a big reveal/twist, but going *so long* without *anything* on arguably the most interesting character in the series is nothing short of a bad move.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, what MysterySushi says is true. There is a reason why he is nice but is going to blow up the earth.
>> ARTICLE
> But Koro-sensei has no reason to blow up the Earth

There actually is a reason as to why he's going to (**manga spoilers that might be part of a third season depending on how S2 goes**, just go ahead and read if you're going to drop the series and don't care): [He doesn't want to destroy the Earth, but the cells in his body are made of anti-matter* because he was a science experiment gone horribly wrong and will explode if he doesn't die beforehand. The only reason as to why he doesn't just end himself to prevent that from happening is because he made the promise to teach Class E for the year to the only person who cared about him period before he started teaching.](/spoiler)

[*stupidly powerful, BTW. The moon explosion was due to the same thing happening to a fucking mouse that just had some transplanted onto it for a similar experiment to see what would happen if an organism with them died of natural causes](/spoiler)
>> ARTICLE
> ...just go ahead and read if you're going to drop the series and don't care

I never drop anything, so I will see this through and check out your spoiler at a later date!!!
>> ARTICLE
In addition to that the more they learn about him the more they find out that just attacking is utterly useless. Gotta set up a hyperplan which for good reasons can't be set up every episode.
>> ARTICLE
an anime can be absurd but it doesn't excuse it from the fact that it still has to sell its premise. assassination classroom doesn't do a very good job of that.
>> ARTICLE
I think it does a mighty fine job. But that might be because many people get the premise all wrong, and expect the assassination part to completely overshadow the classroom part.

And the fact that its a mighty popular manga also indicates that it does a good job.
>> ARTICLE
>it's good because it's popular

appealing to ad populum is not an indication of anything
>> ARTICLE
He said AssClass is not good at selling its premise, if it's popular then they gotta do something right, else people would not buy it...

I dropped it because the premise was too inane for me, it just felt like there wasn't a proper direction for the show.

Meanwhile Sekkou Boys gets a "consider it". lol

So, just some little notes here and there from me about shows that more people might want to give a chance to or the ones that Banjo didn't mention:

**Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm**

This show reminded me of Aria. It's basically a super relaxing SOL with a little sci-fi twist. The characters are not particularly deep, but their interactions are very enjoyable and the cast is very, very likable. Even characters that appear to be mean or arrogant in the beginning, turn out to be very nice people on the inside. The idea of Flying Circus is quite intriguing and seems to have more depth than might initially appear. 

**Active Raid**

This show is stupid and campy and feels like Jackie Chan's movies from the 80s. And I love it for that. Basically, imagine a typical buddy-cop show, but with police mechs instead. Add to that some solid CG fight scenes, very light and comedic tone, enjoyable banter between characters and a female lead who already exhibits some cool character development, and you get one very weird and exciting little show. Oh yeah, you wanna how campy the show is? [Police mechs flash their badges](https://45.media.tumblr.com/8d0c5a0aa251bbede7b930751cd73ab5/tumblr_o0lxshV8bo1skdbiao1_400.gif) and the latest episode had a "Hacker Duel". It's that goddamn campy.

**Momokuri**

Personally didn't like Rakugo, too slow for me. I get that it's new and different but that alone isn't enough for me to like it. 
>> ARTICLE
Rakugo is definitely my favorite, but it does hold a certain slow paced storytelling, subtle storytelling and a focus on period drama and Rakugo, so it fills a lot of niche aspects. But I feel its myriad strengths really helps make it shine. Not to mention it must be one of Studio Deen's prettier shows in recent memory and also the classical Japanese and jazzy soundtrack really adds to it.

I can understand if the show won't be up everyone's alley but it is a good balance to the more over the top shows out there if you're open to slower and methodical stories.

> Erased and KonoSuba are my top two as well...

Erased's third episode was so emotional. Anger, sadness, elation; you name it, it had it.

As for KonoSuba, I am *loving* the characters. All of them. Sure, they might be a *little* trope-y, but I don't care. They are so much fun that they make me smile from start to finish. :D

> ...from what everyone has been saying I guess I really need to check out Rakugo.

Definitely.

It has an aura about it, an atmosphere that is best experienced instead of reading about. Although I am still waiting for "something to happen" -- as a story about storytellers, the story so far has been pretty meh. But everything else, from the music to the characters to the art, has been fantastic.

The manga for Erased is not so highly rated as the current anime is. I'm predicting it will not hold on to such a high rating for long.

>from what everyone has been saying I guess I really need to check out Rakugo.

I didn't think I'd like Rakugo, but I'm in love with it after watching the first three episodes. It's not [everyone's cup of tea though.](http://i.imgur.com/u2uJlI1.gifv) Although I primarily watch anime for escapist purposes, I'm enchanted by Rakugo because so far it's hitting the bullseye as a character study. It's exploring various aspects of the human condition through it's diverse cast of characters. 

Like Banjo said, almost all technical aspects of this anime are on point, but I'm especially drawn to the attention to characterization. Although heavy handed at times due to occasional internal monologues, often words are left unspoken and I can just *feel* these characters' emotions, although I don't understand them completely yet. What they desire, what's holding them back and why; these things are slowly falling into place. For the most part I can empathize with each of them despite their different personalities and perspectives because we're given enough of an understanding of the experiences that have shaped them. Overall, Rakugo just feels so...*human*. 

But...I'd be hard pressed to call it entertaining. There are decent jokes here and there, some dramatic and tense moments, but it's meditative and reflective for the most part. If you don't feel a connection with the characters, [I wouldn't fault anyone for falling asleep while trying to watch it.](http://i.imgur.com/7rWiBJ1.gifv) Definitely give it a try though. 

>Erased and KonoSuba are my top two as well

> Overall, Rakugo just feels so...human.

That is a nice description of the show!

I think the second episode has been the strongest of the three, because it gets at what you are saying about feeling their human side without outright saying too much -- [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "the overpowering music during Yakumo's performance, the conversation between kid Shin and kid Yakumo in the bathhouse, Yakumo laughing for the first time when Shin was doing rakugo to earn a spot at the home.") The anime goes to great lengths to make everything feel as right, as *human* as possible.

> But...I'd be hard pressed to call it entertaining.

...And that is the show's biggest problem right now. Ironically, there is just not a whole lot going on story-wise. Without some conflict, some driving force for the characters -- despite how well the anime is framing everything around them -- that sense of emotional investment is just not there. At least, it is not as powerful as it can be.

Let's be honest here, there are 2 shows which stand out than others in this season which are Shouwa Genroku and Boku Dake. No matter how different in taste you have, once you have seen most anime in the season you will always come to a conclusion. They are both great in term of story telling, cinematography and character developments. 

Only the third one might seems different. For me it's Dimension W with its strong performance on first episode, but after that it becomes a bit dull but I still have high hope for the show.

Konosuba is probably the best option for comedy fan in this season cause there aren't any good comedy anime. Dagashi Kashi is a big disappointment after all.

I just have to say, if you want to enjoy a bad show, there are far better options than Musaigen. Musaigen is just bad, it's not funny bad and it doesn't redeem it's bad plot with it's other aspects. Symphogear was a fun bad show where the writers took a vacation, and they saved it by making everything hype. Another was a bad horror, but the comedy of the season. Musaigen is simply not the kind of bad that is still enjoyable. 

Also, I question your "most" claim. I picked up 12 shows this season and you're not watching 7 of them.  So I included my own thoughts on those series below.

* **Ajin** -- Watch it.   
It looks promising (especially since I watched the movie already, which seems to cover up until episode 5). The MC and plot are interesting, and the CG doesn't distract from the show very much and I think for some scenes it actually is able to get more detail in. Obviously there's no direct comparison, but it doesn't look bad. 
* **Prince of Stride** -- Consider it   
I've not watched much sports anime in the past, but this seems exactly what I would expect from one. I feel like it's going to end up with way too many characters and not focusing on each one enough. However, so far it's been pretty average, I'll be sticking with it.
* **Koukaku no Pandora** -- Drop it   
If you enjoy the mindless ecchi of Musaigen, maybe give this a try? It's closer to the so-bad-it's-good kind of show, although I wouldn't say it's quite there. As for the show itself, it's basically Yuri robots shooting shit. Plot doesn't seem to be anything interesting yet, I'm only continuing watching because I lost a bet.
* **Schwarezmarken** -- Consider it   
Apparently people don't like this? I see it as an upgrade to the harem hijinks that Total Eclipse was, although we'll see if that continues given the ending of the most recent episode. I like the setting but wish they would just adapt the main MLA storyline, since I've heard it was quite good.
* **Koyomimonogatari** -- You already know if you want to watch it.   
Honestly, I don't think this needs a review. If you enjoy the monogatari series, you'll probably enjoy these shorts. I think it's overall not as good as the other monogatari shows, but it's still entertaining. 
* **Nurse Witch Komugi** -- Drop it   
It has it's moments, but overall it's not not fun to watch. The characters aren't really great and I don't think the plot exists yet. The second (of two) shows this season I'm watching thanks to losing a bet. Don't make bets kids.
* **Nijiiro Days** -- Consider it.   
I counted this one and then forgot about it while writing about the other shows. It seems fitting actually, it's not very special. The characters aren't anything special and don't expect much out of the romances as it's a short and there will most likely be epsiodes dedicated to each guy. Luckily they all like different girls, so it's not terrible. Like Komugi, it has some funny moments. Unlike the Komugi, the rest isn't terrible, so I'd say you should consider it.

Edit - Counted 7, only listed 6.

i'm seriously digging this show. very well paced so far. no kawaii fanservice that gets in the way of the story. am hype.

>> ARTICLE
Koukaku no Pandora has that appeal as a serious mecha science base underneath its yuri/ecchi premise. It was an experimental Shirow Masamune idea after all. It's not bad for what it is. It's just a tad low budget. I think it's a little to make sweeping generalizations about Musaigen because this is one of KyoAni's battle anime in a while and they might really show off their chops eventually. Also the setup and the lore is there. And they actually built some characterization last episode.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe it'll improve later, but I'm currently not seeing much good in it. 

I think you a few words there about Musaigen. I honestly don't think there's anything that can be done to save the terrible plot and meh characters of Musaigen though (short of starting over as a parody). The fact that they seem to know it's trash and yet keep making it (the stair scene when MC sees Kirby's panstu) doesn't give me hope that they'll improve. If everyone agrees that it's amazing at the end of the season and it's got like an 8.5 rating then I'll pick it back up, but for now it's dropped.
>> ARTICLE
How are you liking Grimgar and Dagashi Kashi so far? Because I'm enjoying Musaigen more than both of those currently. Dagashi, to me, is just bad (though I can see how it is aiming for nostalgia with people who used to buy dagashi or whatever). Grimgar has potential for sure but has been very boring and cringeworthy at times (without payoff. RUCK FANTA).

There are aspects to Musaigen that are stupid, for sure, but I'm liking the light-heartedness of it. Koito being a mean hardass doesn't do it for me, maybe it's relevant later in the story though.
>> ARTICLE
Didn't pick up Grimgar, and Dagashi Kashi has been disappointing so far, especially given how hyped up it was before the season began. I think it's a great reminder that anime is not made with us in mind, all the dagashi parts just don't interest me. Even if I'm not enjoying it that much, I don't see how you could says it's worse than Musaigen, especially if what you like about the latter is that it's light-hearted (unless you think the show about candy is serious and dramatic?). 
>> ARTICLE
Hmm I get what you mean about the light-heartedness but Dagashi just feels a bit more tense with Saya kind of competing to be best girl, even though Hotaru seems to only be in it for her ulterior motives. Guess I'm a bit stuck on that kind of stuff.

Koukaku is something I love because I love GitS so to me its basically some of the same ideas (cyberbrain, full cyborgs etc) with yuri androids that doesn't really give a crap. It's like a fun parody for me.

Thanks a ton for doing this. I'm a bit behind in terms of keeping up with all the shows I want to, but I'm doing more this season that I have been since Fall 2014 which is when I dropped out of airing anime watching for a while.

I agreed with your annoyance over the fan-service shots in Grimgar. I don't even remember how much I liked the first episode's plot, partially cause I was watching it in a group setting, but also because the show convinced me so thoroughly that all it cared about was framing the boobs and ass well and letting me know that the characters had those things on their mind just as much as the director. Like you said, it could be good, and I'll watch a few more episodes to see, but I'm disappointed in both the fanservice and the characters. The plot I won't judge quite yet.

Maybe I'm just a grump, but I'd also go farther in my criticism of Dagashi Kashi and point out the blatant product placement. I don't mind sponsorships if it allows the production of the show in the first place, but when the plot and all-important comedy is shoved to the side in favor of waxing eloquent about confectionery brands.

Finally, I'd like to debate you and /u/Sinrus on the emotional appeal of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. It can be slow, especially if the comedy of the rakugo performances doesn't appeal to you (and there's nothing wrong with that). However, though I can certainly understand /u/Sinrus's criticism of the show's multi-episode flashback, the events in both the first episode and in the flashbacks are very relatable, and happen between realistic characters. I was upset when [episodes 2 and 3]  (/s "Bon's girlfriend had to leave, and later when he is told he must stay with his master's wife rather than go with Hatsutaro (I probably felt all the more since he himself bottled everything up)") I teared up when [episode 3](/s "They return home") and was just generally touched by Bon and Hatsutaro's relationship (sorry they all have so many names, so I'm trying to use the most commonly used young names). Whether it's [spoilers?](/s "a deep camaraderie like brothers, or something more") I care about them. Just in general the characters in the show seem so much deeper or dynamic than cliched tropes in so many other shows.
>> ARTICLE
> ...that all it cared about was framing the boobs and ass...

Yea, it is a prime example of fan-service that is just way too out-of-place. This is meant to be a realistic portrayal of a struggling and adventuring group. Them hooking up is cool-beans, but the camera panning behind Yume as she lays in bed is unnecessary for not just the character but also the situation.

> ...and point out the blatant product placement.

Huh. I never thought of it that way. Is that really true? I it was just the subject matter. Unless you are referring to the small clips at the end?

> I was upset...

Here is how I viewed it: [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "Yakumo himself stated that he only dated her because he was passively interested in what it was like dating a girl. And her character was barely even around for five minutes. Combined, that scene where she is crying and leaving him lacks emotion for Yakumo and, by extension, emotion for me.")

> I teared up when...

I will give some credit here. [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "Seeing Yakumo walk towards Shin -- *without* his cane -- was touching. Good emotion there. Not to the point of tears let alone incredibly moving, but it was nice to witness.")

> Just in general the characters in the show seem so much deeper or dynamic than cliched tropes in so many other shows.

I agree! They are.

But the anime is not *actually* doing anything with these characters. Yakumo is getting developed and Shin is influencing his "brother" in a positive manner, but since the story *around* them is not using them, then it makes it inherently difficult to invest in them.
>> ARTICLE
I think that's the hook of Grimgar though. Despite it being presented as serious, it definitely looks like an over the top fantasy world (or even a game). So I kind of think the fanservice kind of reminds the viewers that it could be a fictional/game setting too. It does play with both sides. I can see why it may irk, but I think it does serve a purpose. Well, it helps to like sexual elements of shows too I guess, but in this instance, I think it is somewhat intentional to keep viewers guessing. It's not just the fanservice but how the world is structured and combat is handled too. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, you could say that it keeps viewers guessing but you could also say it's inconsistent. I really wanted to take this show seriously because of all the LN readers, but the show doesn't take itself that seriously. Maybe it's going to get really serious with the developments in episode 4 but who knows. Also people say its actually really deep and you need analysis, but I think Grimgar would be better off if you shut off your brain.
>> ARTICLE
In the first episode of Dagashi Kashi, they hold the first candy up to the camera, and then go on at length about all the amazing flavors and how it's the best candy because it's good for any mood. And there's barely any plot or comedy in that section so it's hard to argue that it's not about the product.

As for Rakugo, I'm trying to figure out what you mean by the story around them using them. They DO interact with the world, but I do think the character interactions are the highlight anyway.

Also, I'm pretty sure [Rakugo](/s "He says he originally dates her to try it out, but then she's super sweet and they're perfect. I don't think you can say he lacked emotion when that's his entire personality. He doesn't wear his emotions on his sleeve. I think he cared a ton, or the scene wouldn't have been in there.")
>> ARTICLE
> As for Rakugo, I'm trying to figure out what you mean by the story around them using them. They DO interact with the world, but I do think the character interactions are the highlight anyway.

I will try to rephrase it!

A story is being told, that much is true. [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "His girlfriend leaves him, his 'brother' leaves him, and even 'rakugo' leaves him. That is a lot of loss for one person to take! And again, I can appreciate this on a character level: the show is developing his character wonderfully. But the actual *story* has no conflict. Yakumo, as I listed, certainly does, but everything else that the story has and is presenting demonstrates that there is no actual problem going on. One might argue the near loss of rakugo/the war, but not only is that resolved in a single episode but one of those elements -- the war -- is never given any direct context.")

The [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "main conflict is in the present timeline, with the -- once again -- dwindling rakugo. The conflict between Konatsu and Yakumo and Yotarou and Yakumo. The relationship between Konatsu and Yakumo. All of the *true* conflict is not being shown in favor of characterizing and developing Yakumo. It is a trade-off, one that I feel Rakugo is not balancing correctly.")

Hopefully that clarifies things a bit more!

> Also, I'm pretty sure...

True.

[Rakugo Spoilers](/s "There is still the issue that he talks to her, dates her, and she leaves him all in the span of five minutes. Emotions need time to cook! A dramatic scene like the one where they are hugging is not a powerful one if it happens all in the span of five minutes. It needs build-up, it needs tension, it needs *conflict*.")
>> ARTICLE
Alright yeah, that cleared up your problem with it, and i do see your point. There's a definite lack on conflict, especially in the flashback.

I also see your side when it comes to [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "the relationship. I'd argue you can tell a compelling and even emotional story in a short period (think of the beginning of Pixar's UP or several shorts by Shinkai), but this certainly isn't on that level. I guess I just could identify with the emotions of loss, rather than caring about her as a person. If anything, I cared about what he might be feeling, as someone who has very little in the world and had just found someone special only to lose her. It certainly wasn't a conflict, nor was a major plot point, I just thought it evoked some empathy")
>> ARTICLE
> I also see your side when it comes to...

[Rakugo Spoilers](/s "Yea, the beginning of UP is pretty much the titular 'how to tell a romance story with no words in about two minutes,' so that kind of comparison is unfair for Rakugo. :P")

And [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "you are totally right. You do feel some empathy for him. It is hard not to feel anything for someone who has lost something, especially another person. How we -- you and I and anyone else -- respond to it, however, is dictated by our own experiences, not just the anime itself. Meaning, that scene moved you more so than it did me because it spoke to you differently, in whatever way that might have been.")
>> ARTICLE
Right. And I was never trying to argue that it was the saddest or most emotional thing ever, just that the show wasn't dry and unrelatable to me
>> ARTICLE
The flashback characters aren't bad, by any means. My frustration springs from the fact that I *really like* the present day characters. So far this extended exposition, which is interrupting the story I was already invested in, has not informed or added to any of the conflict or mystery that surrounded Sukeroku in episode one. Why does [episode one](/s "Konatsu think that Yakumo killed Sukeroku? Why does Yakumo not want Yotaro to study Sukeroku's performances?") None of this has been explained, or even alluded to. The conflict in the backstory amounts to [episodes 2 and 3](/s "at first Bon didn't like rakugo, and then he learned to like it. Then his master and friend left for the war and he had to wait for them to come back. I want to learn about Sukeroku and why he's so controversial, that's the entire reason Yakumo is telling the story in the first place. An entire episode about Bon sitting around waiting for him to get back from China does not contribute at all to the story I actually care about.") I am confident that once *Rakugo* gets to where it's going, it will be incredible. I just want it to stop wasting time and get there already.

Perspectives on a few other shows if you want them (sorry they're a bit short):

Norn9: - Drop

The characters are two-dimensional and the pacing leaves a lot to be desired.  Most of the show is taken up by slice of life as opposed to exploring the show's setting (which is interesting and well-designed) or the plot (which given recent developments may be trying to bite off more than it can chew).  Stay away from this show unless you enjoy trashy reverse harems (if you do, it starts off mediocre but gets trashy later, so have no fear).

Sushi Police: - Drop

Somehow manages to be more absurd than Sekko Boys and is packed with patriotic cringe comedy.  I'm still not sure if we're supposed to root for the protagonists or condemn them.  While the episodes are short (only 3.5 minutes) the jokes are repetitive enough to feel grating by the third episode.  The ending song is by OK Go, but it only lasts 30 seconds.  Unless you enjoy Trigger-esque so bad it's good (or have a fantatical love of sushi) I wouldn't recommend it.

Prince of Stride: -Consider

An excellent sports show with a novel concept and excellent animation.  Characters are nothing to write home about, but the parkour-style races inject a healthy dose of excitement to what would otherwise be a generic sports show.  Viewers new to sports anime should definitely consider this (if only for the parkour), but those who enjoy sports anime, acrobatic stunts, or fujo bait (or all three!) will especially enjoy this.  Those uncomfortable with fujoshi or rampant gay shipping are advised to avoid this fandom, because to a fujoshi there's subtext up the wazoo.

Schwarzemarken (sorry if it's misspelled): - Consider

Mostly accessible to those who haven't read Muv-Luv, though reading up on the different kinds of BETAs is probably helpful.  The show has done an excellent job of setting the atmosphere and deftly weaves political intrigue and mecha action together.  Characters are solid but nothing overly spectacular.  Viewers uncomfortable with gore should avoid this show, but those who are comfortable with monster blood flying everywhere should definitely give this a shot.  The MC looks like the siscon from Dance with Devils so there's that.
>> ARTICLE
I partially disagree with you on Norn9 and Prince of Stride. For the former, having played the source material, I think it's doing a pretty decent job of balancing everything out. Trying to condense 9+ different routes' worth of story into an anime series isn't easy, and whilst it's not amazing I don't think they've done too bad a job so far. That being said, the characters aren't very fleshed out yet, and I'm waiting to see how they bring together all the overarching plot points to reveal everything. I'd probably give it a tentative consider at this stage, though after three episodes it's really hard to tell. The voice cast is also quite nice in this one, and despite one or two largish discrepancies (none of which are deal-breaking so far) it's sticking fairly close to its source material.

As for Prince of Stride, so far I honestly have a hard time recommending it to anyone. I was super excited for this one, as I'm both a huge otome and sports anime fan, but honestly, so far I'm struggling to pay attention to the screen when I'm watching it. The animation is gorgeous, but I feel it rushes too fast into action, and with such a huge cast nobody is really getting much time to be fleshed out or developed. I haven't played the game for this one, so I can't tell how well it's being adapted or what constraints this places on it, but so far I'm just disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it for someone's first sports anime (that place would probably go to Haikyuu!!)- it feels like it's trying to be Free, without any of the things that attracted people to Free (besides the shipping bait). One little thing that irks me is the colour scheme used. It's very vibrant and garish, but not in a good way. I can see what they were trying to do, but I find it really off-putting.

It's nice to have some choice for female fans this season, but I'm still a little underwhelmed by what's on offer.

I'll be completely honest, I don't find Phantom World nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. Yes, it's generic as fuck, but if you watched any of the trailers then that was super obvious from even before it aired. It's a big blob of fanservice wrapped up in a nice bow, and a lot of the visual gags are very well done. 

I'd like to hear why people seem to hate it so much. Is it because it's by KyoAni? Is it because people genuinely expected something more and were somehow let down? I seem to be out of the loop here, as all the hate seems kinda silly and unwarranted, since the show never tried to be anything but stupid, well-executed fan-service to begin with. 
>> ARTICLE
It's because it's such of a waste of potential.  KyoAni has a huge budget but wastes it on shit-tier plot and shows, for fanservice .

That's basically the "silly and unwarranted" point he was making. They can spend their budget however they like, you are literally judging the show by the studio making it, you are literally saying it's bad because the studio has a good budget and it isn't what you want them to make.

That's not judging the show, that's judging the show by the studio and EXACTLY what he was saying seems ridiculous.

It's a good show for what they intended to do. They didn't intend to do anything else, it's exactly what they intended to make and nails it for the specific genre and purpose it has.

I quite like Phantom World. It has an interesting atmosphere, and I like how it's generally quite well-researched. And the third episode actually had some character development, so it seems to me like it's going in a good direction.

Definitely not because of that. If it was any other studio this trainwreck wouldn't have been half as popular.
>> ARTICLE
> It's a big blob of fanservice wrapped up in a nice bow, and a lot of the visual gags are very well done.

This is true!

The production values are off-the-charts (thank you, KyoAni, for all of your hard work!) and the fan-service, while copious, is smart in its own right (panty scene without showing them, boob-limbo, finger sucking for healing).

...But there needs to be a *bit* more than nice visuals and well-done fan-service. The plot is currently going nowhere and the characters, while cute/sexy/what-have-you, are not very promising. I need to listen to the music more before making a judgement on that, but the OP and the ED (besides the ED's dance which is, once again, more fan-service) are not *too* impressive, either.

> Is it because it's by KyoAni?

I think that is one of the main reasons. People wanted (arguably) the best animation studio to focus on/make something of the same caliber. People did not want them making a "fantasy school battle harem ecchi LN."

I do not mind myself. They can make whatever they want to make. And the way I see it, this is something different for them and therefore probably *fun*. It is nice to change things up time and again, and I am sure KyoAni felt the same way.

> ...since the show never tried to be anything but stupid, well-executed fan-service to begin with.

I agree with this, that the show should be viewed in this manner because (as you say) that is exactly what it is.

But again, I think there still needs to be more than what we have been given. There are a lot of episodes to get at that plot, to get at those deeper characters (I don't expect *super* complex characters, but I expect some care in their handling), but from what we have seen, it is really just a lot of fan-service without too much substance.
>> ARTICLE
>I'd like to hear why people seem to hate it so much.

Because people value different things in shows. I completely agree with you that Phantom World is a generic as fuck big blob of fanservice wrapped in a nice bow. In my opinion, this is a very bad thing for a show to be. As such I think Phantom World is a bad show. You (presumably) do not think it is a bad thing for a show to be, and as such you do not dislike it. That's really all there is to it.

I *really* need to start cutting down on how much I watch. :3

> Our top 3 are the same too! I imagine this will be the case for quite a few people :)

I am *really* liking Erased and KonoSuba. For Rakugo, I just need it to get some conflict going. The characters are great and the mood it strikes is touching, but it needs some tension and emotion to start pushing things along. I am confident that will happen, but until it does, I am just liking Rakugo as opposed to really liking.
>> ARTICLE
Fair enough, I imagine KonoSuba will keep trotting around at its current pace. But with Erased and Shouwa, they have the potential to be something more, yknow?

Both had great first episodes (though Shouwa wins out in this aspect for me), yet I feel like I enjoy my time with Erased more than Shouwa :)

>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime 2nd Season

I actually think this is a *great* opportunity for the show. Here we have a chance for Shirayuki to really grow as a character in my opinion and become more than her *almost* mary sue level. If the show was stuck solely focused on Shirayuki and Zen, to be honest the show would be rather stale. Izana bringing in the plot and moving the show towards a specific direction can further propel their relationship forward IMO. 

> Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (TV) 2nd Season

Considering how you didn't like the first one not much to say other than it is basically more AssClass. 

> Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm

I really don't like air head MCs so I kinda dropped it after the first ep. Also the CGI is kinda meh. 

> Boku dake ga Inai Machi

Nothing else much to say other than I agree. Running in for top 2 of this season for me.

> Dagashi Kashi

I rather liked this show (Gundam references are great). I can't really give a concrete reason why, but I guess the comedy stuck with me and I do like the interactions. I really don't know what people were expecting in the first place, because I didn't know much other than Hotaru was a walking doujin and so far she's done pretty well at being that.

> Dimension W

My second running for Top 2 of the season because I absolutely *adore* the cyberpunk setting and plot line. I dig mega corporations that have a large control of the world built upon a conspiracy cyberpunk story. The heavy integration between technology and everyday life, the futuristic yet weird character designs and the dirty slums contrasting the high tech life. It all screams everything I love about cyberpunk settings and stories and both this as well as Bokumachi (and also Konosubu which is currently third) earn this season's "I'm turning off my second monitor so I can fully concentrate on watching this show"l.

Also I rather liked the characters and they have a nice contrast between each other. One is a android who wants to fit into society and be more human. The other is a human who wants to live on the fringes and generally stay away from the rest of human society. The ol' classic who is more human question has me invested in seeing how their relationship evolves as well as pretty much all the characters themselves.

> Durarara!!x2 Ketsu

More Durarara basically. 

> Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season

While I found episode 2 to be *incredibly* satisfying, I don't like where the show is going. And to be honest, the darker turn was a joke for me because the show does not do a good job of setting that tone. Reading the Berserk manga has me see Gate's attempt at being dark to look incredibly juvenile. And now the show is going away from what I liked most about Gate which is the large scale military conflicts between modern and medieval and instead basically going on harem adventures where I'm kinda meh about.

> Hai to Gensou no Grimgar

I wasn't too big of a fan of episode 1 but episode 2 had me all kinds of interested. The show does a good job of portraying what it would be like to live in a fantasy MMO setting as a bunch of low level scrubs and that is what really draws me into it. The characters are eh so far but it'll be nice to really see them develop. What I want most from  this series is to see the characters *break*. I want to see the *suffer* like they did with [](/s "killing the gob for the fist time"). I want their group dynamic to fall apart, maybe even begin to have bouts of insanity and loss of humanity. I want my fill of tragedy this season and Grimgar looks right up the alley to fill that (along with Schwarzkmarsken). Also I know it is cheap out of place fanservice, but I can't help but say [bless Yume.](http://i.imgur.com/9cK4io1.jpg) and all the other butt service in the show. 

> HaruChika: Haruta to Chika wa Seishun Suru

Discount Hyouka and Hibike crossover that I dropped.

> Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!

While Grimgar is basically a deconstruction of living in an MMO, Kono suba is full on parody. 3rd favourite of the season by far and I love it.

> Musaigen no Phantom World

I'm basically watching this show for fanservice and this show has been rather disappointing after episode 1 because there isn't much else that this show has going for it. There basically is no plot. The characters basically suck (literally in the case of Kirby-chan). I don't even know most of their names and I just refer to them as Fanservice, Kirby-chan, Headphones, Bunny ears, christmas cake, Yui and Mr. Exposition (because the only thing the MC does is exposition). I say fuck it just go full fanservice route because otherwise the show is meh. I honestly find Saijaku to be more enjoyable than Musaigen. 

> Ojisan to Marshmallow

Auto watch for me because it is adorable. 

> Oshiete! Galko-chan

Kinda dropped it because the humor to me was kinda eh.

> Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut

Well you know my thoughts already.

> Sekkou Boys

I don't think you can even judge this anime properly. It's amazingly stupid but fun.

> Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu

Ah yes, time to rip this one a  new one. This show was an utter snorefest for me. It is basically a discount Saekano. The main MC girl isn't Yukino 2.0, but discount Yukino who is essentially Aki Tomoya mixed with Katou's boringess. You can do boring deadpan characters like Katou if you can make the rest of the cast be eccentric and interesting like Saekano did. But this show doesn't work because the rest of the cast are just blah. Besides genki Kana Hana, the MC is basically your all around do everything nice guy. I don't particularly see anything to differentiate him from your generic nice guy MC is every generic harem fantasy LN battleschool adaptation. Both MCs might as well be planks of wood floating in an ocean because that is how interesting they are. 

> Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu

This one is not in my top 3 unlike most people as I can appreciate what the show is going for, I don't find myself really enjoying it all the time. It is a good show overall though. 

Stuff that you haven't covered but I liked for various reasons include Ajin, Koukaku no Pandora and Schwarsemarksen.

True.

But I am a romance lover, dammit! I need as much love and gushy feelings and blushing and hand holding and flirting as possible!!! :3

> ...other than Hotaru was a walking doujin...

Ha! She is, isn't she?

I think people just wanted more "stuff" to happen. Hotaru is great and the candy is okay, but since not much else is going on, it can get stale (pun intended) pretty quickly.

> ..."I'm turning off my second monitor so I can fully concentrate on watching this show"l.

For *every* anime I watch, I have to give it my full attention. Otherwise, I would feel like I betrayed them, myself, and my writings. :3

Regardless, I am glad to hear you are liking DW so much! It does seem right up your ally, as far as I am aware.

> ...and instead basically going on harem adventures where I'm kinda meh about.

This will be its chance to finally give its main, prominent characters some time in the spotlight! I think that at least deserves some credit.

As for the darker tone, I am liking it. I am also liking Tyuule's character because she literally cares about nothing but revenge ([...](/s "letting that pig-man lick her leg was so gross!"))

> What I want most from this series is to see the characters break.

I *think* based on the next episode preview, we are going to start seeing something like that happening. Hopefully it is not *too* messed up for the group, though. I like people to be happy, not sad. :(

> Also I know it is cheap out of place fanservice, but I can't help but say bless Yume. and all the other butt service in the show.

I freakin' love this one so much!

I want it to be as awesome and funny the whole way through the season so that it can become one of my absolute favorites. :D

(That is jinxing it, but I don't care. KonoSuba is so much gosh darn fun!)

> I say fuck it just go full fanservice route because otherwise the show is meh.

When KyoAni *does* decide to make a full-blown "ecchi" series, it will be glorious and all of /r/anime will implode, due to both happiness and rage. :P

> Well you know my thoughts already.

Yes, I do! And thanks again for that. I hope you participate again next season. :)

So much burn, you'll burn the wood despite it being surrounded by water! :P

I *was* going to ask you to write about this one, but I wasn't sure which way I was leaning on my ranking scale. That was before I called "Another Perspective." Next time, I think I will have people write about the ones they have passion for, e.g. you and Shoujo-tachi.

> ...as I can appreciate what the show is going for, I don't find myself really enjoying it all the time. It is a good show overall though.

My thoughts exactly!

Hopefully those remain to your liking throughout the season.

Yup. As someone who is rather tired of the fantasy genre, cyberpunk/sci fi is right up my alley

> This will be its chance to finally give its main, prominent characters some time in the spotlight! I think that at least deserves some credit.

Only thing is that given what the show has been like so far, I don't expect there to be a lot of meaningful characterization and I don't expect them to change.

>  Tyuule's character because she literally cares about nothing but revenge

Yup. Characters who are driven by revenge are always very entertaining to watch (Ryouko from KLK and Mahiro from ZnT for example)

> ...Rakugo as a must watch but other than that we agree for the most part.

I wanted to give Rakugo a "Must Watch It." I really did. But I could not in good faith do so because I am just not feeling it from the show right now.

As a reviewer/critic, I can see its technical achievements across every category. But as an audience member, it is just not doing enough to capture my attention. I know that will happen later, when things start happening with the characters and [Rakugo Series Spoilers](/s "the show finally decides to go back to the present timeline"), but for now, my emotional investment in the show is low. Low enough for me to dock it down to a "Watch It."

As for Shoujo-tachi, that was another one where I was debating what to put. The third episode was not as strong as the first two, but I was enjoying myself a good deal with those first two that I gave it a slight bump up in terms of ranking.
>> ARTICLE
> I wanted to give Rakugo a "Must Watch It." I really did. But I could not in good faith do so because I am just not feeling it from the show right now.

I was actually really surprised at how much time they were spending on the backstories and thought maybe this would be where the show faltered.

I'm still all aboard after episode 3 because I love the way they've handled the storytelling so far, but with what looks like the introduction of a [](/s "love triangle, this might be dragged out for too long.")  However, I can also see it going the route of [](/s "this show was actually about Yakumo and Sukeroku the whole time,") which could be interesting with proper execution.


>> ARTICLE
> I was actually really surprised at how much time they were spending on the backstories...

Right?

I like /u/Sinrus's comment about disrupting the story/conflict so early and (as you say and he wrote) for *so long*. It is really weird to present these two interesting characters -- Yotarou and Konatsu -- and then not do anything with them for what is going to be three entire episodes.

I do like that Shin's character is [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "entirely in the past and such a big influence on Yakumo") and I do like the anime fleshing out Yakumo (and by "fleshing out" that is read "developing his character as much as the anime can probably muster."). I just need these past events to start meaning something to the characters and to the anime itself.

> First Spoiler

I want to guess that [Rakugo Spoilers](/s "it won't be a love triangle and that she will simply become Shin's wife and therefore Konatsu's mother. But the problem with that idea is that Konatsu has red hair, and since they parents have brown/black, I do not think it is genetically possible. But I am not a biologist so I cannot say for certain. :3")

> Second Spoiler

That *would* be interesting. I and everyone else would probably have to look at the anime slightly differently in order to look at it more "fairly."

Hrmm! Now you got me wondering where it will go. :3
>> ARTICLE
Maybe you should include another category in your next one like "highly recommended" and for shows like Rakugo and get rid of the "watch it" category and get a category that could fit in between highly recommended and consider it so shows like Shoujo-tachi and Rakugo aren't in the same bracket.

Hey Banjo! Regrettably I kind of agree with your points about Akagami no Shirayuki's second season. I absolutely loved the first season, but this season does seem to lack focus a bit. Though [spoilers for first season](/s "it kind of makes sense that Shirayuki and Zen are somewhat separated for now, if we had Shirayuki x Zen moments every episode it might lose some of its magic, or at the very least we'd all die of cuteness overload"). But I still have high hopes that it'll get better!

I am so biased, but I want [Shirayuki Series Spoilers](/s "I want Shirayuki and Zen to have as many of those moments as possible.

Good morning Banjo,

> Akagami no Shirayuki-hime

Love this show, solid characters, good romance, great voice work by Saori Hayami, show looks pretty, Fukuyama Jun as Prince Raj is absolutely brilliant in his performance (he plays this type of character so well), one of my favorites of the season

>AssClass

Drop it :( Banjo plz, it's so good. No I actually kind of get what you mean. Don't get me wrong, The manga is absolutely amazing and I really enjoy the anime, but I can see some pacing issues in the anime at sometimes. This one is easy to judge though, If you liked season 1, you'll love season 2. The manga hasn't concluded yet, but it's looking to be one of the most satisfying shonen jump manga in a long long time if it keeps this up. The last year of chapters have been of top-notch quality and I have high hopes for the adaptation as well.

> Ao Kanata

It's cute, it's not boring, it looks kinda nice, it's an okay show in my opinion that's enjoyable but not amazing.

> Boku Dake ga Inai Machi

I think no one has any qualms about calling this the best show of the season (so far and excluding sequels). The voice work is mindblowingly good, and seldom has an anime had me in tears by episode 3. So, so good.

> Dagashi Kashi

It's like Non Non Biyori minus Renge, which makes it an okay slice of life. It was hyped into high heavens and I'm happy not to have bought into it because it's fun, but nothing special (so far). Saya best girl though.

> Dimension W

I don't know what I should do now with every strenght I can take to break enemies. Kyouma reminds us of Hei, so he's chinese electric batman minus the chinese and electric. So he's grumpy batman? Isn't batman quite grumpy himself at times? Anyway, love this show so far, probably my number 2 after Erased. The characters are fun, Loser is fun, the robot girl is HNNNGGGG adorable, what more can we ask. Oh right, the opening is really, really good (more good openins this season, as visible in your writing above).

> Durarara

Do I really have to repeat myself here? Banjo, you know how much I love Durarara. It's one of those series that I'll absolutely rewatch once its over. Let's just hope the ending is satisfying, I don't know how they'll do it, but if this season ends the show in a good and spectacular fashion this'll a 10/10 for me. Love Durarara. Also, Steppin out tonight by Flow has been on repeat all week for me.

> Gate

The Japanese army being bas-ass, animal ear girls, dark elves and PTSD all in one rushed story. We've talked about this on [your blog](http://thechuunicorner.com/2016/01/08/reviewdiscussion-about-gate-jietai-kanochi-nite-kaku-tatakaeri/) It's one of my favorite shows, but it has some problems that we can't ignore (as you said, not enough is known of the world). Still love it though. I love Rory, you love Tuka, can we all just get along?

> Hai to Gensou no Grimgar

This might start hitting the feels soon. It looks like a rough place to be and it's a nice change of pace after Sao, Log Horizon, No Game no life, Gate, KonoSuba.

> KonoSuba

talking about KonoSuba, I had ZERO expectations for this show. I went in expecting it to be crap, and i laughed my ass off so far. Brilliant comedic timing, great characters and the show knows exactly what it is, everyone watch this please!

> HaruChika

see what I did there, I switched 2 shows so I could segue from grimgar to konosuba. Impressed? No? that was to be expected. Impressed by this show? no? Good, we're on the same page. It's okay, I'm kind of interested in seeing how this love triangle plays out, but it doesnt look like that'll happen too soon.

> Musaigen no Phantom world

At least it looks pretty, right? right? A peeping tom phantom, KyoAni please, I had faith in you, I just watched Hyouka earlier this month, how could you do this to us. I don't like this one too much, but it looks so, so pretty. Also, reading in the comments I saw 

> All studios have their ups and their downs. I wrote about PA Works experiencing this -- GlassLip, Charlotte -- but KyoAni is the same way -- Beyond the Boundary (granted, BtB is nowhere near as awful as PA Works lows; plus, BtB has one of the best EDs of all-time! ) I think PW will end up the same as BtB: pretty average, but by no means horrible.

Is now a bad moment to say that Beyond the Boundary is probably my favorite KyoAni show? I see how the ending disappointed, and I agree to a point, but the premise, the characters, the soundtrack, I really loved that show.

> Ojisan to Marshmallow

This is almost as good as Danna ga nani. It's 3 minutes, just watch it people.

generic crap, watch for tame ecchi, stay for the hope of actual romantic development, be dissapointed in the end, I've seen it a million times now. A friend of mine ( /u/aturo ) pointed out that this is basically seikoku no dragonar reskinned.

> Sekkou Boys

This is just fun. It's not great, it's not bad, but I enjoy watching it. They give life to stone statues, which is impressive to say the least.

> Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu

Pretty good, I have to agree with you opinion completely on this one. Worth my time so far and a great watch.

> Shouwa Genroku

I keep hearing good things, but I dropped it after 10 minutes in. I might pick it up again, but it seemed like it wasnt for me.

Also, you didn't talk about active raid, are you not watching it? I think it's pretty decent (save for the Engrish).

Tried to keep this short because I had to work like 3 minutes ago (technically I can start when I want, but 3 minutes ago was when I wanted to start XD), but keeping this short didn't really work.

Have a nice day every one, let's hope this season delivers a lot of greatness. It has potential to say the least.

At this point, I expect the show to not touch that subject in any serious manner. And if it *does* it is going to be at least a little bit awkward.

> Is now a bad moment to say that Beyond the Boundary is probably my favorite KyoAni show?

That is good! BtB deserves some love out there. If nothing else, the ED and the visuals are gorgeous to behold.

> ....stay for the hope of actual romantic development, be dissapointed in the end...

That is what will make me the saddest. :(

> I might pick it up again, but it seemed like it wasnt for me.

Rakugo (the show and the subject) is definitely not the most *entertaining* anime right now in terms of emotion, conflict, and general investment. But its technical aspects are crazy good.

> Also, you didn't talk about active raid, are you not watching it?

Not watching it. Ergo, no comment!

Hey Banjo, nice writeup. It's nice we agree on a most of the things, and even better, that there some things I do not agree with you (world would be so boring if everyone was happy go lucky no problem) - AssClass.

That being said I was hoping you would cover **Pandora**. I felt this one might be pretty controversial, considering it is cyberpunk ecchi shoujo-ai with terrible animation. Yet I feel there is something deep down most people don't see and I still cannot put my finger on it, something that might promise great yet cryptic future. We'll see.

Other than that, I'm still on the edge whether I should pick up DimW or KonoSuba (or both). To be more precise, I was on the edge with DimW, but your writeup made me start considering KonoSuba too.

They are!

KonoSuba and Rakugo are showing that they, just like every other studio, can create some really stellar anime.

> Also, not including the Rakugo and Dagashi Kashi OP songs in the top 3 is sad days.

So, I changed it this year!

Instead of "Top 3" OPs/EDs, I changed it to just one OP or ED from an anime. All of the ones I posted are not just really well-done, but they are also from completely different anime. That way, people are exposed to more anime and maybe given the final push to watch that anime they were on the fence about! :3

Lots of neat perspectives here. 

I'm fairly happy with this season. I'm watching 6 shows (7 once I catch up on Shirayuki-hime) and am very pleasantly surprised by both Erased and Rakugo Shinjuu. 

Would also like to mention [Rakugo's OP](https://my.mixtape.moe/iianfk.webm) for being baller as fuck. Composed by Shiina Ringo and sung by Megumi Hayashibara, absolute dream team.

Hey, a man after my own heart. Every time I listen to it, I get the feeling that the day is winding down and that it's time to settle in, chat some friends up, warm up with some coffee, and forget about the daily grind. [Puts a big, dorky grin on my face.](http://i.imgur.com/cK1HVgI.jpg)

Your top three picks are exactly the same and in the same order than mine, nice taste :D

With ERASED I really ride the hype train for first time, I watched Charlotte in my first season of airing anime and I got kinda disappointed with how it went, but this one has the potential to be my favourite anime, and it ending average would be so heartbreaking.

The first three episodes were the strongest I have seen, if it somehows keeps the level until the end ERASED deserves atleast a place in the top 10 of the anime lists.

KonoSuba just made me so happy watching it, hilarious fresh comedy and glorious rainbow puke, I honestly expected a quality drop from the brilliant first episode, but the second one was as good, I can't wait for the episode of today!

If erased follows the manga as closely as it does atm with all the important points (just streamlining the fluff), then it's going to be a pretty easy 9-10 from me.

Hi, Meta!

> Your top three picks are exactly the same and in the same order than mine, nice taste :D

Only the best of tastes! ;)

> ...I watched Charlotte in my first season of airing anime...

That was definitely some bad luck right there. I *think* Erased will make up for that, though. :)

> ...and it ending average would be so heartbreaking.

It would be. It is always hard to watch a show you want to be good, that you feel and know is good, not go where you think it should or reach the heights you think it could.

To be fair, Erased can still mess up at any point this season. But optimism in these situations is key! :)

> KonoSuba just made me so happy watching it, hilarious fresh comedy and glorious rainbow puke, I honestly expected a quality drop from the brilliant first episode, but the second one was as good, I can't wait for the episode of today!

That montage was great, and Megumin's introduction, "chuunibyou," and general antics were even better. I, too, cannot wait for the next and every other episode! :D

Thanks for commenting, Meta. I greatly appreciate it!

Well, decided to give Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! a try after reading this. 

Five minutes in, and I'm already loving it. 

"Did I at least die a hero? Was my sacrifice not in vain?"

"LOL NO YOU DIED CUZ' YOU PULLED THREE ALL-NIGHTERS IN A ROW YOU STUPID FUCK. ALL THE PARAMEDICS LAUGHED AT YOUR PISS-SOAKED CORPSE."

That is awesome to hear! It really is an amazingly humorous and awesome anime, so the more people I hear that are picking it up, the happier I become! :D

I loved the one somewhat after it where [KonoSuba](/s "he picks her as his one thing, and then he mocks and laughs his way to the other world. *And then* she cries hardcore when she fully grasps the situation.") So gosh darn funny!

Lets compare the ones we've both watched

Aokana- Yep pretty much hit the nail on the head with this one, borderline drop it for me as cute but tropey characters aren't quite enough to carry it. Seems like a show I'm going to watch all the way through and give it a tepid 6 at the end of the season.

Erased- got to this one fairly late but folks on here were right, this is a good one, definitely a must watch. Mystery has me sucked in unlike....

HaruChika- strong first episode but has really fallen off for me the past couple. Mysteries are boring and plot for the past two episodes were essentially identical. Unless I see improvement, I think I'll drop it after tomorrow's episode. I am hopeful though, as last weeks preview seemed to indicate this would be some backstory for Haruta rather than a recruitment of the week.

KonoSuba- Must watch, talk about unexpected. I read the synopsis before the season and figured, "Well this is going a generic action harem show" To be honest, I don't mind those shows, they are my comfort anime. I was very pleased, however, this show is significantly better than that. While, no, the animation isn't top notch the colorful world and likeable characters combined with good, albeit dumb, comedy makes it my second favorite of the season.

Phantom World- Yeah consider it. Gorgeous show but story and character-wise it just isn't anything special. Ruru is pointless and annoying. Felt like the 3rd episode piqued my interest a bit more than the previous two(well the memory exchange through hitting heads was kinda dumb but I liked the rest) so maybe there's hope?

Bahamet- I might give it a consider it just because it's the only ecchi harem this season but there are just big problems elsewhere. Story and pacing are just absolute messes. Seriously, watching the start of the 3rd episode I had to go and check if I missed an episode as the cut from the end of the 2nd was so drastic. 2 cute girls(Lisha and Krulcifer) aren't enough to carry the show. I'll end up watching it all though.

Sekkou Boys- feels like this should have been a 3 minute show. Fine enough in small doses but even at 8 minutes it wears it's welcome thin.

Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu- favorite show of the season and unlike the reviewers I actually am digging the flashback.

Couple of other show's I'm planning on watching one the broadcast dubs come out: Snow White as well as Dagashi Kashi, perhaps Grimgar as well since the reception has been pretty positive.

Oh, definitely. I love the direction it has taken over the year, and love that everyone gets involved and has a great time reading and talking about anime.

My only hope is that I can put this together every season for the rest of my life. :3

I watched the first three episodes of schwarzmarksen and I feel like it was made as fanservice to Muv Luv Alternative fans like me. It is absolutely terrifying seeing the BETA animated compared to sprites in a visual novel. 
>> ARTICLE
My only complaint is that shouwa Genroku Rakugo shinjii wasn't given "must watch," because to me it's unequivocally the best show this season. I mean, don't get me wrong, ERASED is really fucking good, but it has the advantage of an immediate genre hook (time travel!), while Rakugo has to suck you in with only its characters and direction, and honestly, I think it does a better job.

Like, ask yourself, could erased convince you to sit through an entire five minute standup routine? Probably not. Rakugo sucks you the fuck into it though
>> ARTICLE
> Shirayuki  
> damsel in distress needs saving from her knight in shining armor
> Hope is still there

You make it sound like the anime is destroying itself with changing the focus for a bit. I must say that the character the focus has been put on isn't really a welcome one, but it surely isn't making the anime any worse. It's exploring more than just the Shirayuki/Zen relationship. We don't want it to become boring right?  
Also, It's Shirayukihime, Snow White, so you kind of should expect the fairy tale "damsel and knight" thing.

> AssClass

Getting very biased vibes here. I don't feel like your comment on it is very reliable with the waay you react to it.

> Cloudflow + Aokana

He really put on some rose colored glasses there. While it surely isn't bad currently, it has some of that generic stuff in there and the production values are good, but not excellent. Still, the show is not bad at the moment. Especially Asuka keeps me interested in the show. Masaya, while having that typical mystery thing, also seems interesting.

> Inami_pouch + Dimension W  
> Worst of all perhaps, is excellent skill with throwing knives, able to strike any target with unbelievable accuracy. Overpowered MC or overrated skill? Yawn

Ok, so he is good with throwing knives, which seems to be his way of fighting in which he trained to be good at. Does that make him overpowered at current times? No, not really. We still don't have enough material. Also, in an anime were a guy fights in close combat with robots, missing something has a high possibility of him dying. His way of fighting is pretty nice, don't put on your "Oh he's probably OP"-glasses. Remember he's one of the beasts.  
Also, we haven't really seen any true antagonist yet.

> Grimgar +  purplepinapples  
> Its pretty lacking in the directing department, especially fight scenes, and it relies too much on exposition. In my opinion, it fails to use dialogue correctly. In a show, you should be able to convey something with dialogue. Whether it be setting the tone, relationships between characters, advancing the plot, what have you. I didn't feel like the writing and the dialogue in this show was meaningful. It didn't interest me.

I don't think we are watching the same anime. The directing is very good. The fight scenes are realistic (Were you expecting some battle shounen stuff or something?). The dialogue and narrative is what has been setting the tone and showed relationships. I have no clue what you were thinking.


That's all.

Agree with most of these, though unfortunately I think I'll be dropping Grimgar after it spent literally half its latest episode on fanservice/talking about the girls' clothing.
>> ARTICLE
Here we go and as promised my other ratings for the shows I'm also watching :)

Ansatsu Kyoushitsu -> Watch it.  
To be honest: If you don't like the first season, you won't like that. If you like the first season, here is more of the same. Expecting big changes in the promise or the atmosphere is a bit off, as it would never happen. So it's more of a "Did you like S1?".

Boku dake ga Inai Machi -> Watch it.  
No "Must" because there were too many mysteries that fucked up, so while the first episodes are a "Must Watch" I would never give an mystery a "Must watch" until I know the ending.

Dagashi Kashi -> Consider it.  
Still think, this one would have done great as "Short series". The jokes just feel a bit dragged out over a whole episode.

Dimension W -> Watch it.  
I love the characters, the worldbuilding and the theme. The anime with it flaws not too much, but it has the potential to be one of the good shows :D

Gate -> Watch it.  
Same as Ansatsu. It's more of the same in the end.

Hai to Gensou no Grimgar -> Consider it.  
For the theme, it's a consider it. For the anime, it would probably be a "maybe consider it", because it's another piece full of flaws and missed potential.

HaruChika -> Consider it.  
I personally see more potential in it than in many other anime. Of course it's not a real mystery-anime, it's more of a popcorn-SoL with some nice additions. The characters are mostly interesting, the "love-triangle" with the teacher is something new and with a clear goal there is little chance, that the episodic parts are running nowhere.

Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! -> Must watch it.  
I go with the great perspective of this Totenkopfgitarrist O.o

Musaigen no Phantom World -> Watch it.  
It's a battle harem with absurd KyoAni production value. It's what it wants to be and whoever likes the genre should watch it.

Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut -> Consider it.  
It's the battle harem without absurd KyoAni production value and really bad pacing. It still has cute girls, ecchi-comedy and some nice looking ideas, so overall it's still an average harem-anime for fans of the genre.

Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu -> Consider it.  
Feels a bit like the second version of Saekano. All the meta-humor was there again, it's just more of the same with some characters, that could be interesting, but no clear goal, no clear pacing, and just more of the same everyone else did. Right now it's more like a filler until Saekano 2 is here... 


So that's all... and again way too much to write :D
>> ARTICLE
> Musaigen no Phantom World -> Watch it.

Yeah.. nah. Phantom world and BokuMachi at the same grade.. k
>> ARTICLE
If you would read the actual text, you would see, that Phantom World is a "Watch it" for fans of the Harem-Genre because of it's production value and that the only reason for BokuMachi to not have a "Must watch it" is the fact, that mysteries are easily fucked up at the end, while the first episodes are a clear "Must watch". 

So for people who have faith in mystery and dislike harem it's a "consider it" to "Must Watch it" and for me it's a "watch it" for both for these reasons.

Right now, it's less battle and more something else, but for me it's still quite entertaining. But it really comes down to whether KyoAni can do more than just showing their production value.

Well, I guess that is where we disagree. The source is just another mediocre battle harem LN, be amazed if it improves.

Bahumut was on a completely different level to Phantom world. Phantom isn't even very good on the level of this season, mind about last year!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I didn't read Phantom World, so maybe my hopes will be crushed :D

And for Bahamut... I don't know, the adaptation is quite bad in my eyes, uninspired battles, way too fast pacing, too much cut out. For me it's more or less an exemplar of what is wrong with many modern LN-adaptations and their pacing... but maybe that's just a matter of taste and expectations =)

You didn't read my part? :( Yes, I do understand where you are coming from. If you really want to wait and would like something to watch meanwhile, please have a go at Sakurako-san. It is a mystery, the ending feels pleasing even though there is a cliffhanger, but damn do the characters esteem mystery and are given careful attention, equal to the mystery cases presented.
>> ARTICLE
I read your part and I would agree with your opinion! Good job on it! :)  
I just answered to Banjos particular opinion to give my thoughts of the shows. Discussing every opinion on there would kill me (it's 3am over here :D)

Sakurako-san was okay I guess. I had some problems with it, but it was an overall nice product and one of the better mysteries lately. Erased will have a conclusion, so it's probably a bit easier to rate it afterwards as a whole product =)

>> ARTICLE
> The jokes just feel a bit dragged out over a whole episode.

I saw this being said in the threads and elsewhere, and I think I agree. If everything was quicker due to shortened times, I think that would help out the show. It is mostly due to the candy motif being so...tame. It is not exciting no matter how much Hotaru thinks it is, so when the audience is watching, it might be *interesting* to learn but it is not necessarily enticing (as candy normally is).

> ...because it's another piece full of flaws and missed potential.

I am curious to see where this one will go later on. I want it to end up being a nice show overall, but yes, it is not without its own set of problems.

> ...the "love-triangle" with the teacher is something new...

It *is* something new. So the anime not pushing it more or putting more emphasis on it is a huge mistake. Hopefully that does happen later on, but if it remains at the same level of "we will mention this every now and again when the teacher shows up for the one time this episode" then I do not think there is value in that.

> I go with the great perspective of this Totenkopfgitarrist O.o

Ha!

> Right now it's more like a filler until Saekano 2 is here...

That is not a half-bad way of looking at this one. :P

> So that's all... and again way too much to write :D

Thanks again for your help, Toten. You helped to make this thread a success! :)

But if they would some more "interesting" motif to Hotaru, this sub would explode... xP

Hopefully that does happen later on, but if it remains at the same level of "we will mention this every now and again when the teacher shows up for the one time this episode" then I do not think there is value in that.

That's a way to look at it. I don't think, that the romance will ever be the defining characteristic as it's more or less impossible for them to end with the teacher. I just like the mix of this triangle, a bit of comedy, some relaxing puzzles and some nice themes. I see this more as a SoL with extra than something else...

> That is not a half-bad way of looking at this one. :P

Yeah, but it also has to do something better, to feel like a good anime. After the first episodes - some little scenes aside - there is nothing that is really better than Saekano for me.  
I just hope this one will grow for me over the season...
>> ARTICLE
Rakugo imo is a must must watch. They establish the characters I need to care about superbly. They then use good camera work and music to really make the Rakugo engaging. You really can feel when a character is nailing it or when the character is bombing. I am emotional invested in seeing the ex gangster succeed due to how they present his personality. I want to the see the master background and his connection to his adopted daughter father's. Especially the adopted daughters dad and master relationships is amazingly done. I could go on but I think the main thing it has going for it is how well established the characters are and how you want them to succeed. 
>> ARTICLE
>The Underdog: AoKana

I want to believe in this one so bad (I did the write up for it, after all), but I'm not sure.  There are three characters in this one that absolutely need development to pull this show off, and the next couple episodes should be crucial to decide this.  

Interestingly enough, I never found Flying Circus *that* boring, but maybe that's because the characters maintain conversations throughout the sport.  Which are always adorable.

And then Erased.  Everything in this show is strong, but I'm remaining cautiously optimistic.  My issue is the main character.  The first episode portrayed him to be a deadbeat loser, and the second forced him to be a concerned kid.  His "Imtoocool" personality is in direct odds with his weird desire to help people whenever he travels back in time, and I desperately need some explanation.  Otherwise, this show is really good.  E: Disclaimer, haven't watched episode 3 yet.

Thanks for compiling the write-ups, Banjo!

I don't quite understand the conflict. He's a loser but I don't know if he's really a dead beat. He has a goal,  which is to be a Manga drawer/writer(?) and in one of the first scenes isn't he pretty much told he's talented but he doesn't show a unique voice, doesn't show himself,  and that's what people want to see? Seems he's more... Someone who has trouble opening up while dealing with constant soul crushing failure and rejection. He wants to matter but his results never seem to. The saving people seems to make sense to me in that context. He says the results of the rewind is pretty much always neutral or somewhat negative for him,  but I imagine he's not a robot,  there's some happiness and pride, derived from helping people,  saving their lives. Making a difference. Actually mattering. That whole jazz. 
>> ARTICLE
> There are three characters in this one that absolutely need development to pull this show off...

I feel that the only vital ones are Kurashina and Hinata, mostly because of their dynamic -- the former is the noob and the latter is the champion. That kind of relationship might be common, but it lends itself way to nice development for both parties.

As for the other characters, I do not expect a *lot*, but I agree that there needs to be something for Tobisawa and maybe even Arisaka.

> ...but maybe that's because the characters maintain conversations throughout the sport.

Chihayafuru, an anime with monologues for every duel, proves that even a sport about cards and poems can be intense and exciting to watch. Ping Pong The Animation is also somewhere up there in my Top 10 anime, but it relies more on visuals/movement to make it exciting.

To this end, I feel that when they are playing the sport, neither what they are saying nor what they are doing has any weight (and not because they are literally defying gravity). It might have to do with the lack of equal footing: so far, all of the battles have been straight stomps, leaving the losing side with no chance to win. That makes the duel too one-sided, and because it has happened every single episode with every single match, it can get boring to watch the same outcome every time.

> His "Imtoocool" personality is in direct odds with his weird desire to help people whenever he travels back in time...

That is a bit strange. Maybe he just feels compelled. Or those are the only times where he is truly needed. In his normal life, he is just a regular dude who is getting nowhere in life, but when those impossible situations present themselves, he takes the chance to prove that he is more than just a pizza delivery driver.

But please, go watch the third episode!!! :)

> Thanks for compiling the write-ups, Banjo!

Not a problem! It was a lot of work, but I am glad everyone is loving the thread once again. :3

Kurashina and Masaya are requisite, I just REALLY want Tobisawa because she cute.  That's why I'm sticking along for the ride.  They all cute.

>he has a chance to prove he's more than just a pizza delivery driver

I hope something like this comes out of his character.  I'm really weird about "writing the story for the author," I hate drawing conclusions unless I have some tangible evidence, however minor it might be.  But that would be a nice development, particularly if they go a step further and explain how he went from an apparently happy kid to a jaded edgelord.

I'd give quite a few of those Watch Its as consider. 

Don't think I really agree with the must watch on KonoSuba though, its a decent light hearted mmo show, but to give it the same rating as BokuMachi... Yeah, not sure about that.

Overall, pretty solid list, I'd swap out Dimension W with KonoSuba for my top 3

> Surprised how many Watch Its you gave out. Was expecting mabye a couple?

I was actually thinking I was being *too* harsh this time around; I thought I gave out too many "Consider It"'s. :3

> Don't think I really agree with the must watch on KonoSuba though, its a decent light hearted mmo show, but to give it the same rating as BokuMachi... Yeah, not sure about that.

Both are aiming to be and doing different things, but they are each excelling in their respective areas.

When I rate/write about/critic/review/what-have-you, I view the anime for what is, for what it wanted to be, and for what it ended up being. The *execution* of it all. Execution is number one in my eyes, and KonoSuba and Erased are nailing the execution!

> Overall, pretty solid list, I'd swap out Dimension W with KonoSuba for my top 3

Dimension W is a neat show, too. I am excited to see where Kyouma's and Mira's relationship will go. Hopefully a *bit* more friendly. :3

It does accentuate the dichotomy that much more.

(And you are not strange at all! It makes their relationship poised for change/development, as well as putting Kyouma's hatred of coils into physical perspective)

> Well, it is winter.

One year, every season will produce at least one 10/10 anime. And we will all pass out from happiness.

>> ARTICLE
Well I'm watching way too much this winter, might as well chime in. Feel free to reply if you want to argue a point about a show, there are very much my personal take on this season.

**Boku dake ga Inai Machi** -- Must Watch It

I hate to sound like i'm just bandwagon but really this show is so far amazing. Unless you for some reason really dislike serious anime I would recommend it above everything else this season.

**Dagashi Kashi** -- Consider It

Really isn't a show for everyone. It feels a lot like a SOL in the way that nothing happens, it's slow and not really exciting so if that sounds like something you wouldn't enjoy then stay away.

**Dimension W** -- Watch It

Personally I really enjoy the characters and story, although not everyone would agree. Some people find the characters rather annoying, the main character is rather cold and the girl is rather.. girly. If that description doesn't immediately turn you off and you like the summary of the show I would say give it a shot.

**Hai to Gensou no Grimgar** -- Must Watch It

So far my favorite series of the season. It's beautiful, the characters are the most real-feeling characters I've seen in a while, and they're taking a much grimmer and more serious look at the "trapped in a video game" idea. Kind of like BokuDake though it is pretty slow, which I think is needed to build the characters as well as they do but I have seen people complain about it. If you don't mind a show that doesn't move along extremely quick at least give it a few episodes.

**HaruChika: Haruta to Chika wa Seishun Suru** -- Consider It

Weird mix of mystery and music, which is strange but also is just interesting enough for me to not drop it. I couldn't tell someone to drop it, but it's a rather weak show this season that if it keeps going like how it is will be rather unremarkable.

**Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!** -- Watch it

A parody/comedy of the "trapped in a MMO" type show. Pretty funny so far and the characters are interesting, if you like the MMO genre it's a must, if not I still would say give it a try.

**Mahou Shoujo Nante Mou Ii Desukara.** -- Watch it

Extremely short parody on the magic girl genre. If you haven't seen a few of those shows I don't know if you really would enjoy it, but if you have it's a really cute short that you can blow through in no time.

**Musaigen no Phantom World** -- Watch it

It's stupid and they took the show a much less serious route than I expected, but I'll be dammed if I don't say i'm having fun. It's very much a show you have to realize is not trying to be serious, and if you can get to that point and don't mind the more ecchi scenes I think you'll enjoy yourself.

**Nijiiro Days** -- Watch it

It's boy falls for girl, and i'll be damned if it isn't one of the cutest romance stories I've seen. The MC is so damn cute and the story seems to be going places. Also has some good comedy, although it's not really the focus. If you like the romance genre get on this, if not you probably won't find it worth your time.

**Ojisan to Marshmallow** -- Watch it

Again an extremely cute show. If you want to see how to make a big, middle aged guy cute then here you go. If you like cute this show is amazing. Also nice and short, making it easy to keep up with.

**Ooyasan wa Shishunki!** -- Watch it

So much cute this season. Here we have a middle-school girl who is the owner of a housing complex. We watch our 20-something main character interact with her. It's adorable, crazy adorable, but that's all there really is to the show. Again a must watch for people who like cute, not so much for everyone else.

**Oshiete! Galko-chan** -- Consider it

Let's talk about rather awkward questions about teenage girls WITH teenage girls! Really odd show, I'm really only still watching it because it is really different than anything I've seen, but it's not exactly amazing.

**Prince of Stride: Alternative Airing** -- Consider it

It's a sports anime. Do you like sports anime? well here you go. Do you not like sports anime? this isn't going to be changing your mind. Not a bad show, but it's rather average.

**Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut** -- Consider it

It's you mech battle harem show. I would say the characters are pretty enjoyable, although extremely generic. Again, you know if you would like this show or not.

**Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu** -- Watch it

When I think about this show I can't really say anything stands out about it, but I do find it to be one of the more enjoyable shows this season. Group of high-school kids make a bishojo game, members of the club are rather diverse and enjoyable but nothing amazing. I don't know, I would recommend it if you like the idea for the show, but I honestly don't know if I could give you good reasons to pick it up.

I love you Banjo! Excellent review! If only I had more time to watch anime this semester...
>> ARTICLE
I think I agree with pretty much everything you said, out of the ones I've watched at least. I think the only one that I differed with you by more than one "level" is HaruChika. 

One of the biggest surprises for me was that you rated *Kono Subarashii* so highly. I haven't gotten around to watching it yet, but it looked quite generic to me. Even my friend, who has seen it, tells it's only average at best.

Hi, Red!

You are very welcome! I am glad that I could help you out then, and I am glad that I can help you out now. :)

If they start throwing romance into the mix, my opinion of the show will go up. Not to "Must Watch It" levels, but it will go up. :3

> Overall, I think I'm enjoying more shorts than actual shows this season.

Totally possible.

Hopefully you are watching Marshmallow, too. That one is another good short this season.

Thanks again for your kind words, Red! :)
>> ARTICLE
One opinion of a show I didn't see in the thread yet:

**Mahou Shoujo Nante Mou Ii Desu Kara** (literally: "I've Had Enough of Being a Magical Girl")

I have to say, the show's sexualisation of the main character (she's something like 11 and drawn like that) is on the edge of making me too uncomfortable to watch - but that's likely the point. If so, the camera work undermines it quite a bit. If you can get past that, it's a cute well-drawn little self-aware comedy show about little girls with sudden magic powers. So far, that's *all* it is, but on the other hand it has episodes of just 4 minutes each (45 seconds of which is taken by the OP).

The top 3 of this season seems consolidated in Erased, KonoSuba, and Rakugo. I was waiting and watched with enjoyment the first 2, and now I'm placing Rakugo in the PTW for later.

And I can vote for giving a chance to Mahou Shoujo Nante Mouiidesukara, it's really a short anime, but it's not a bad parody/make-fun of maho shoujo. Personally better than Sekko Boys that has bored me really fast.

For the underdogs, Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu and Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm are two good choices, and I will not count out Phantom World yet. 

I will keep giving a chance to HaruChika. 
>> ARTICLE
I actually agree with almost all of your picks this time, except for your choices regarding Rakugo, which I'd bump higher, and KonoSuba and Grimgar, which I'd both lower into a "consider it".

Now, KonoSuba; For a supposed parody, it seems to be doing everything exactly the same as any other MMO anime. So far there was only one joke which made me laugh. The art *isn't* great. The animation is average *at best*. The characters aren't really interesting. I can already tell I'll get annoyed by Darkness. Chuunimage is the only one who's sort of okay, and even she's just a generic trope character.

As for Grimgar, it really isn't that good. This is another case of LN shitters hyping it up which led me to believe it might be better than it turned out to be (I've seen people make parallels between this and *motherfucking Berserk* for fuck's sake). All the characters are cardboard cutouts of various archetypes, the fanservice distracts a lot from the serious tone it tries to set up (and let's be honest, the fanservice isn't going away any time soon), nothing worthwhile has happened yet and the fight scenes are all over the place. It's already boring enough with the not-so-subtle *darkness* it tries to set up ("Goblins just want to live too, I feel bad" boo hoo) and the death flags are miles high. I haven't read the LN but I swear I'll delete my account if Manato doesn't die by the end of the season. Basically the only good thing about the anime so far is the artstyle.

**EDIT 31.01.2016: I FUCKING CALLED IT**
>> ARTICLE
> The art isn't great. The animation is average at best.

I am not taking offense to the art and the animation as everyone else seems to be. I find the art -- the backgrounds and the character designs specifically -- to be well-done, and the animation, while nothing insanely good, has numerous sequences that are animated quite nicely.

>  I can already tell I'll get annoyed by Darkness. Chuunimage is the only one who's sort of okay, and even she's just a generic trope character.

No way! Darkness seems like she is going to be awesome, and Megumin has "chuunibyou," so she is automatically amazing. :D

> ...the fanservice distracts a lot from the serious tone it tries to set up...

This is true!

> "Goblins just want to live too, I feel bad" boo hoo

Hrmmm!

I imagine (and I hope!) you have never killed a human before. Or more contextually, a human-like creature (say, a monkey). Given that, I think that you would have similar feelings of guilt and doubt when deciding to kill something that wants to live and has sentient thought like you do. So while we might not empathize with them, we can certainly sympathize with them.

> Basically the only good thing about the anime so far is the artstyle.

It certainly is a pretty anime!

Erased looks pretty good though looking at the amount of hype it gets I can't wait for it to fall flat on its face. 
>> ARTICLE
Great list!

I agree with almost everything, but I think that you are being a little bit too harsh on some things.

For example, the fanservice you mentioned in Grimgar is in my opinion that such a big deal as you are saying. I only remember the ass and the boob part, but it there is definitely not enough to make sure people should consider watching it or not.

*AssClass* is for those who like the first season, has some really funny moments and handles the far fetched plot pretty well. It's enjoyable but not amazing.

Dagashi and Phantom are great for just sitting back and enjoying yourself. Nothing really top notch but it brings a smile to your face once in a while and for those who like these kind of anime I say go for it.

I disagree the most however with you on Shoujo-tachi. I've watched all 3 episodes by now and I will give it some more, but it isdefinitely a *consider it* instead of a *watch it*. Characters are less original than the Phantom or Dagashi ones and a few times throughout the episode I feel like skipping a bit. It definitely has a few funny moments and it is nice to not be drowning in generic anime tropes, but it is not that great. 

The thing about the in my opinion unoriginal characters and a bit boring script is of course my taste, just like the good things I see in Musaigen and Dagashi, so I'd say it is on the same quality level as them.
>> ARTICLE
> I only remember the ass and the boob part, but it there is definitely not enough to make sure people should consider watching it or not.

Maybe!

But there *was* enough of it for me to make note of it. I like fan-service, so long as it does not outright take away from what the anime is trying to do (that is broad since it applies differently for different anime). In Grimgar's case, I feel that the fan-service is only hurting the story/characters, even *if* Yume's butt is a nice view. :3

> Dagashi and Phantom are great for just sitting back and enjoying yourself.

True! They are mostly there for fun and simplicity, rather than trying to be anything downright groundbreaking or interesting.

At least for PW, I need a *bit* more from its characters and from its plot. There is still time, but I need to see it sooner rather than later!

> It definitely has a few funny moments...

I found myself laughing quite a bit throughout the first two episodes. The third not as much, but that was mostly due to a final conflict before fully getting the group together.

But you may be right! Depending on how the story unfolds and the characters develop, this one can definitely turn out worse than where it is right now.

Thanks for your thoughts, qweiopasd. And thank you for the kind words! :)

Unlike both perspectives, I'm actually finding the long back story quite captivating and anything but boring. I don't think I'll mind it, even if it lasts for quite a few episodes (though I'd like to see what happens with Yotarou, too).   
Also, something that wasn't mentioned, probably due to being quite subtle (either due to the title being josei or the audience not being accustomed to it or looking for it) the subtle fanservice and designs definitely appeal towards the josei demographic. Although the show can appeal to all demographics and it's so well done so far for everyone to enjoy, I can clearly see why the josei tag is there after these three episodes.

I think Erased is definitely has the potential to become very popular and long-lasting. It completely sets itself above and apart from every other show this season with a different tone and mood. The show drew me in and I was completely immersed, a feeling that sadly has become less and less common the more seasonal shows I watch.

I really appreciate slow moving intelligent shows focused around characters, so I will have to get to watching Rakugo.

One thing I want to point out about Akagami no Shirayaku is that the soundtrack is pretty darn fantastic. I watched the first episode of the second season and really enjoyed it, but what I remember more than even what happened was how great the songs were.

Guys seriously, watch **Galko-Chan** it has that crude type of humor and its only 8 mins long so you're not losing much.

As for **Grimgar** its hard to solidly recommend. The first 3 eps are really slow, and most of the characters are bland so far besides Ranta and Yume. I suggest waiting till it finishes airing then watching.

**AssClass 2**, and **Haikyuu!!**, watch if you've finished and enjoyed the 1st season. There's literally no reason to drop these shows .

I agree with most of your post, but I'd like to point out one thing about Dimension W's MC.

In the manga of DW the MC is much more expressive and a lot of his character is shown in how he reacts quickly to certain things while trying to maintain this "badass" demeanor and image. It doesn't hold up too well when he goes through an outburst, but he does have his serious badass moments. I think the anime has foregone most of the outburst moments to make his personality fit the badass trope, and personally I don't like the change. There's a chance that they plan to change his behavior as it goes on in order to make it look like he's opening up because of Mira tho, so we'll have to wait and see.
>> ARTICLE

Surprised you liked KonoSuba so much, though I guess a lot of people have really liked it. I've been enjoying it, and the newest episode was really picking things up. I would put it as a watch instead of must watch mostly because of DEEN. I was annoyed by quality in a few places and the obviously reused animation, but that aside it has been very enjoyable.

Don't need gold -- they changed that awhile back so that everyone could have the name-summon feature -- but I believe that tread bodies do not summon people. Or if there is more than three it won't. Still a bit unclear on that one. :3

> Surprised you liked KonoSuba so much...

A certain crybaby priest, a "chuuni" mage, and a masochistic crusader have something to do with that! :D

> I was annoyed by quality in a few places and the obviously reused animation, but that aside it has been very enjoyable.

If we are talking about the montage stuff, that made total sense. They were just trying to get across the notion that their lives became a routine of work, eat, (rainbow puke), and sleep.

There *are* a few faces or quirky animation movements at times, but I think it adds charm to this already charming anime. :3

> Holy shit Erased has been great. I binged it in one day and now waiting for more :X

Yea! Erased is awesome.

It is always interesting seeing an anime performing at such a high level consistently because there is always the thought in the back of one's mind that it can all go to crap in an instant. I do not think it will go that way, but we should all be wary regardless.

> Grimgar and Dimension W look like something I should pick up or at least look at when I have time.

Hi, James! :)

> ...did the latest episode of Grimgar do anything for you with regards to what you felt was lacking?

I do not remember saying that Grimgar was lacking anything. At least, I do not believe I said anything like that here in my thread. Were you possibly talking about Rakguo Shinjuu? That is the one where I have been most vocal about there being something missing.

If you *did* mean Grimgar, the show still managed to sneak in an butt shot of Yume this latest episode, and while the characters are still nothing amazing and the story does not have much to it, I am still digging the down-to-Earth presentation and feel.

If you meant Rakugo Shinjuu, I still feel the same way. There is still no major conflict pushing the anime along despite there being a lot of character conflict. I will say, though, that I liked this latest episode (the fourth one) a lot more compared to the third because it felt a lot more contained in its character conflict and pacing.

I hope that answer's your question, James! :3

Oh yea. [Grimgar Episode Four Mega Spoilers](/s "Manato's death I felt was handled nicely because, once again, they made it seem real.

Erased and Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash definitely my two favorite animes right now. Mainly Erased, it just got to me so much and made me love it.

Grimgar was cool, but I didn't like how it all seemed like the intro an anime, rather than something with more of a story like SAO, with more interesting action and such.

It is usually not a bad idea to wait a little bit between watchings of a specific anime, so I don't blame you. :)

I still have to finish Grimgar myself, but I see what you mean. It certainly has a quality to it that makes it seem like it is just scratching the surface of what it has to offer, both narrative- and character-wise.

One thing and Mr. Pineapples is that the cinematography really is underwhelming. It is plain boring, and it doesn't help the fact that the world is harsh and the goblins are hard to slay. The battles are awfully done with no proper overview to where each character are in relation to each other, and every swing misses its hit. Camera quality wise, that is.

> Kono Subara 

> wonderful art

What the hell, Banjo? From what I've seen from previews, it looks horrible the animation and the background are mediocre. But I'm thinking to pick it up since people talk highly about its comedy.

> Musaigen

One thing I find awful about this show, other than its other obvious areas, is the colour choices. It looks too damn rainbowy. Who hired a unicorn to be in charge of the colours? It is sometimes way too flashy and confusing, ugly and just inconsistently attrocious, also what the hell is up with their clothes/uniforms/dress? Ugh.

THIS GIRL REALLY LIKES HIM BUT THIS MOTHERFUCKER JUST IS TOO DAMN FUCKING DENSE AND HAS TOO MUCH MARSHES IN HIS BRAIN. THIS IS SO STUPID! Kyaah~~!

> Shouwa

I feel like you both are being unfair to this show. This is probably the anime of the season for me even though I don't personally like it. The cast is wonderful and the animation when they perform rakugo is damn superb. The cinematography, oh gosh it wets my lenses like Niagra falls to an elephant. The camera never changes its angle whenever they start the rakugo and changes whenever they start going into the story and shifting between characters. This show is damn intriguing by the cinematography itself. It wonderfully shows you with few shots of the audience how we as a viewer are to perceive this acting, whether it be good or bad. The best shot that I can recall is when they frame a woman listening/watching (?) the performance behind a screen. I have to admit it isn't my taste, it is rather unique and new to me so I don't find a lot of attachment to it, but that doesn't (let me reiterate :P) devalue its damn fantastic story telling.

Edit:

You're correct, there have been some gaffs in the animation this season (e.g. in episode 3 Shirayuki's dress no-clips through a table and chair as she steps past instead of flowing around them). The animation quality seems to be a bit lower, and they haven't had the big background/scenery vistas to emphasize like last season which might have distracted from this.

Another Perspective writer for Rakugo here. You're so right, the cinematography on this show is the best I've ever seen. The atmosphere that it crafts is flawless. My issue is, if the story isn't interesting then I'm not going to stick around just because it uses interesting camera angles. I have no intention of dropping Rakugo any time soon; in fact it still holds a strong chance of being my personal AOTS. But in order for that to happen, it needs to continue the story that was begun in the first episode. I hate to say it, but after two episodes of undramatic backstory, I'm more excited to see what happens next in Erased or Dimension W than to listen to a *third* week of Yakumo talk about the past.

I understand very well your gripe with the transition between ep 1 and 2. I share the same feelings about that composition. I would've liked it to be an episode more and probably something that slowly leads to him having to tell about his story. I didn't like the sudden chop. I wanted the Mr. Former Burglar (?) to continue to struggle for perfection! Yeah, I think I didn't explain well enough why I didn't personally like it. It isn't something I REALLY want to continue to the next episode like Erased or Marshmallow does to me.

Good job on your perspective, by the way. :)
>> ARTICLE
> May I ask why, out of curiosity?

Sure!

There was a possibility that the first writer was not going to have his/her piece completed in time. So as insurance, I asked you to write one as well. In the end, you both got it done in time, so I put both up since you guys put a lot of work into them!

> The battles are awfully done...

Not that I want to make excuses for it, but this *is* meant to be realistic. In an actual, sword-on-sword fight, you don't get Fate/Zero Saber levels of sword-fighting, where both sides swing and swing and swing with amazing flourishes and cool moves. If I am not mistaken, most sword fights were usually thrusts and huge swings -- not very exciting, but pretty effective.

> ...it looks horrible the animation and the background are mediocre.

I think it adds a lot of charm to the show.

I do not consider the animation or the art horrible or mediocre. The designs are awesome, the setting is feel-good, and the animation is right where it needs to be (when Megumin uses her "explosion" magic, that looked great!). Check it out for yourself first. I think you will find that people are being a bit too harsh on KonoSuba's visuals. :3

> Who hired a unicorn to be in charge of the colours?

It is *Myriad Colors* for a reason!

> ...also what the hell is up with their clothes/uniforms/dress? Ugh.

What?! The designs and the outfits look great!

I am a fan of Mai's design and outfits myself. :D

> THIS GIRL REALLY LIKES HIM...

She wants his marshmallow, if you catch my drift. ;)

> It wonderfully shows you with few shots of the audience how we as a viewer are to perceive this acting...

Good point! I did not think about the camera being used in that way.

> ...but that doesn't (let me reiterate :P) devalue its damn fantastic story telling.

Oh yea, I agree. I think it is doing nearly everything correct.

Where I take issue is the lack of conflict. There is nothing currently happening that is pushing the characters or moving the story along other than just Yakumo recounting what has happened. This is all done to establish the characters and the setting, which is fine, but without the story having some kind of driving force, it does not have that same sense of tension or emotion to pull the viewer along.

> I don't really know what it is...

All of episode three [Shirayuki Season 2 Spoilers](/s "took place in an underground cavern, which is admittedly devoid of detail. That could have been it. :3")
>> ARTICLE
> From what I've seen from previews, it looks horrible the animation and the background are mediocre.

The visuals aren't the best, but beside the great reaction faces there are some scenes, where they really did put their heart into it and the details. They used what they for the best possible outcome, so while it's nor beautiful art, it's still a good looker, because it manages to distract you from the not so pretty scenes... :D

\# | Anime  | Text 
---|---|----|----
1 | Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu | AOTS by a wide margin. Excellent directing, scene composition, sound design, and character dialogue. | 
2 | Boku dake ga Inai Machi  | Great direction, good voice acting, and cool concept, but can get a little too heavy handed at times. High risk of plot issues because of the time travel element. | 
3 | Osomatsu-san | Carryover from previous season. Hilarious comedy sketches, wacky ideas, and even some emotional moments. Downside is no overarching story. | 
4 | Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans | Having a bit of identity crisis and animation issues. Episodes without Gundam fights are lackluster. |
5 | Dimension W | Fun sci-fi ideas and cool action scenes, but not much real substance or character drama so far. | 
6 | Akagami no Shirayuki-hime Second Season | Picks up where season 1 left off. Solid shoujo romance series with strong female protagonist. | 
8 | KonoSuba | Funny parody "trapped in an MMO" spinoff. Characters bounce off each other nicely and have good presence, even if the premise is super played out at this point. | 
9 | Heavy Object | Despite the very poor exposition episodes, this show has lively characters and over-the-top action scenes. Prototypical popcorn material. | 
10 | Dagashi Kashi | A few funny moments, but the pace of the show really seems to drag at times. | 
11 | Prince of Stride Alternative | Generic sports show about free running. Cool color scheme, but the characters are not particularly intriguing beyond their bishounen fujoshi stereotypes. | 
12 | Assassination Classroom Second Season  | Very good animation and crazy situations. Suffers from having a few too many characters, but is otherwise enjoyable to watch week to week. | 
13 | HaruChika  | School mystery show that doesn't really seem to be going anywhere. Brings up a few interesting ideas but tosses them away just as quickly. | 
14 | Active Raid | Generic robo cop show with a large cast. Has a few funny moments but is otherwise unremarkable. | 
15 | Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen | Not caught up with this one yet, but it suffered from going at a snail's pace. | 
16 | GATE S2 | Otaku militari propaganda pandering round 2. |  
17 | Musaigen no Phantom World | Not even KyoAni can save this lame premise. The world just doesn't feel cohesive and the characters are as generic as they come. | 
18 | Hai to Gensou no Grimgar  | Literally nothing has happened in 3 episodes. Most boring show of the season. | 
19 | Sekkou Boys | Meme of the season. The gimmick is already starting to feel old. | 
20 | Ajin | Have only seen episode 1 with bad subs, which turned a poor show into a bottom of the barrel show. I expect this one to rise at least a little bit once I watch the proper subs. |

I watched the first few episodes of the season but honestly have been on an anime hiatus save for FMA;B. I'm going to wait til next season before watching anything fully, but from what I saw the Kono Subarashi one was my favorite, and my least favorite was, surprisingly, Gate. Loved the 1st cour, but the first episode of this one was crap, followed by a great one. I want consistency.


>> ARTICLE
> I'm going to wait til next season before watching anything fully...

I have been considering doing something similar in order for me to catch up on all of my reviews and writing. But the idea of missing out on airing anime and having so much fun in the community pushes that thought out of mind immediately. :3

> ...what I saw the Kono Subarashi one was my favorite...

I am *loving* that one!

So much fun and such great comedy. The dumb goddess the "chuunibyou" mage and the (I am guessing) masochistic beauty are going to make this season so amazingly hilarious. :D

> ...but the first episode of this one was crap, followed by a great one. I want consistency.

I was not a fan of the third episode myself. It is not a *bad* anime, I just do not find it to be that strong, either.

First cour was my #3 fav of summer, but I really didn't expect to feel like it was a chore to watch the latest EP come winter. It's weird. Maybe I've changed....

Nice stuff...

Here's what I'm watching; (sequels not included)

Ajin (dropped, CGI just ain't for me)

Ao Kana (consider it, sport-ish comedy with mostly girls playing the sports)

Dagashi Kashi (watch it, superb animation, nice characters)

Dimension W (Amazing OP, nice characters, interesting story and sci fi)

ERASED (Must watch it. Watch it already, will you!)

Girls Beyond the Wasteland (consider it, animation isn't that high as compared to others. Similar to Saekano but I guess they'll actually pull off a game.)

Grimgar (watch it, most surprising anime here. MMORPG type anime given a new spin)

Kono Suba (watch it, really funny comedy, diverse characters, fantasy fun)

Myriad Colors Phantom world (Because KyoAni, that's why!, consider it, no story till now, animation as expected, Saori Hayami)

Ojisan and Marshmallow (watch it, nice romance comedy)

Ooyasan wa Shishunki (watch it, cute landlady goes to middle school and speaks fast)

Prince of Stride (watch it, sports anime, high adrenaline moments, parkour all the way)

Shouwa Genroku Rakugo (Must watch it, mature and amazing story telling)

Sekkou Boys( consider it, I'm just here to listen to Gintoki.)
>> ARTICLE

But I am not finding the boys that interesting or even that funny. Hopefully that changes for me later on, though.

I am loving this one to death right now. I hope it continues its stride and then some, because it will then end with high marks from me when it concludes! :3

Each show has literally only three episodes, shouldn't you make this once you've watched all of the shows you haven't dropped so you can actually know all of the material that's going to be shown?
>> ARTICLE
Well, the reasoning behind this is a sort of "preliminary guess" as to how the rest of the show will turn out. A lot of people typically used the "3-episode rule" because it's about 25% of the show, and most of the time, large twists or developments have occurred and you can get a good idea of where a show will go.

Banjo does end up reviewing everything that's mentioned at the end, he doesn't drop shows (for some crazy reason)

Erased is clearly the top new show of the season. 

But there are other amazing continuing shows which you have not mentioned here - specifically, Haikyu! and Ace of the Diamond. Can we give them some love? The writing is good, the animation is superb and the characters are well developed and have great growth throughout the show.  

I feel like sports animes are some of the best, but most under-appreciated shows out there - like Baby Steps, Major, Cross Game, etc.  

There are also no supernatural, silly elements in the above-mentioned shows like special super moves seen in Kuroko's Basketball and Prince of Tennis - ability comes from practice, practice, practice.

I would also be totally, 100%, yak-percento OK with Japan never again making a harem show. Please Japan mangakas and light novelists, grow up and let your characters have realistic relationships.

~~*I'll be editing this post as I go through every show I'm watching.~~ Done!

**BokuMachi, Boku dake ga Inai Machi, Erased**
_______________________________________________________

Let's start with my controversial one. So I'm not really finding this that great right now-don't get me wrong, I think it's decent, but I've had problems whenever the show tries to go into drama so far. The problems I have with this show are somewhat complicated and numerous, so I'm just going to go through each episode and explain myself that way.

[Episode 1](/s "I didn't really care about the main character's mom when she died, or the main character enough at the end of the episode to find the climax exciting, plus I cringed hard when the main character ran from the scene due how much I expected that reaction and how cliche it felt, although I do understood why he would do so. Maybe I didn't like this because I guessed that the mom was going to die and he was going to go back in time-the first instance where we see his powers revolved around stopping implied death, and the mom pretty much had a death flag around her for her scenes-so I was subconsciously waiting for it to happen, but most of the appeal of a mystery/thriller for me is guessing what happens next anyway, so I don't really feel like I watched it wrong.")

[Episode 2](/s "I liked this episode quite a bit. It actually made me like the MC, his mom, and his dynamic with his friends in a very natural and relatable way, which is the method of getting me invested I like the most. On the technical aspects, I appreciated the claustrophobic snowy environment, the sound design, the great tone-setting music, the OP, and the way the characters moved a lot more than I did their counterparts in the first episode. I honestly can't think of any complaints I had that don't feel like shallow nitpicking with this episode.")

[Episode 3 trigger warning](/s "I don't care about Kayo's abuse. I can't take shows that try to make me believe in both its setting and characters in a natural, realistic way seriously when they introduce their antagonists as 100% evil people through aspects like") [their character design(spoilers),](http://i.imgur.com/tO8WJj2.png) [](/s "and having evil smiles while doing irredeemable actions to characters we're supposed to sympathize with without really giving the audience a reason first-Yes, I know the point here is that the reason is a mystery, but I can't take this mystery seriously when it's presented in this way in this kind of show, because it's like making me hate a fictional character by showing them kicking a puppy to me. Anyway, these tactics make me feel as if the show is forcing its conflicts onto me with no self-awareness, and unfortunately my knee-jerk reaction to that is cynicism and apathy for anything related to the conflict. I know this all probably seems petty, but I can't really help it being the way I consume media, and this completely ruined the Christmas tree") [scene(spoilers)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IOWdriKpZrg/hqdefault.jpg) [](/s "for me. Maybe it was wrong for me to have expected Kayo's mom to be a person more than she was an antagonist, but damn it, I wanted the show to be more subtle than that after episode 2 so naturally played out.")

And that's it for BokuMachi. I hoped I explained my problems well enough to not get downvoted.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

**Dagashi Kashi**
__________________________________________________________________________________________

It's basically everything Banjo said for me, except without Hotaru being something going for it:

>Dagashi Kashi is supposed to be a story about candy, but this anime has only one (technically two) things going for it: cute girls. Hotaru, the candy-loving, happily-energetic, and crazy-sexy girl is the best part of the show, but Saya, the simple girl who makes a good cup of Joe, is not far behind. Beyond Hotaru and Saya, the anime quickly falls apart: the candy information is educational but boring, the comedy is not as funny as the anime thinks it is, and the rest of the cast is very forgettable. Contextually speaking, this ones store is lacking stock.

I still like Saya though, but I'm not going to watch the show just for her and I can't relate with the candy obsession at all.
__________________________________________________________________________________________
**KonoSuba, or the really long LN title show**
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Despite my snarky heading, I'm enjoying the show quite a bit. The animation sucks more than it doesn't and not every joke hits its mark, but I'm finding the characters entertaining, and the jokes that don't hit still feel like they're trying. Episode 2 was less fun than episode 1, but nothing nearly drop-worthy. I've also been following the manga of the LN for this for a while, and I think episode 2's effect seemed like it was dulled from my remembering some of gags from the manga.

_________________________________________________________________________________________
**Dimension W**
_________________________________________________________________________________________

It's... decent? I don't find Mira to be as cute as the show seems to think she is, and some of the sci-fi feels lolwut, but I kind of like the main character and his dynamic with Mira is nice and I *really* like the Bones-like aesthetic. It also reminds me of Cowboy Bebop in some respects, but it isn't like being reminded of Cowboy motherfucking Bebop is a bad thing.

______________________________________________________________________________________
**Sekkou Boys**
______________________________________________________________________________________

This wasn't actually as funny as it seemed it wanted to be, but it got a few chuckles and grins from me and I love all the voice actors. I'm only caught up to episode 2 though.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
**AoKana, Ao no Kanata No Four-Rhythm**
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Mostly picked this up because I remember the VN was fairly well-received. It unexpectedly reminded of Diebuster (which is far from a bad thing), but while I do have a bit of nostalgia for Gonzo, the animation is just too uninspired for an anime centered around flying and the actual characters are :/. Only watched one episode, not sure if I want to watch another.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
**Leftovers**
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Even though I'm 15 episodes in, I'm probably going to drop Utawarerumono for Iron-Blood Orphans. The former has been meh to mild dislike for me for 70% of its run, and what I've heard of the latter has a ton of things I like.

Osomatsu-san continues to be weird and kooky in its 2nd cour. I'm not laughing quite as much as before, but the characters and show (and animation) now feel so much more realized than in the beginning that just watching them interact is fun in and of itself.

_______________________________________________________________________________________
**Shows I'm planning to pick up**
_______________________________________________________________________________________
#Rakugo!!!!

I heard so many good things about this that appeal to me that I feel guilty for not already having picked it up. Definitely going to try and find time to marathon what's out of it as soon as I can.

**Last Durarara Cour**

I barely remember what happened in the first cour, and I remember a vague feeling of 'I should know what's going on, but I don't' from the second cour, so I'm going to have to rewatch before I start on this.

**Grimgar**

Part of the reason I want to pick this up is because what I've heard of this has some things that appeal me, and part of it is because MAL, /a/, and r/anime have all had wildly different reactions to this.

**HaruChika**

Digi was pretty positive about it, and my general reactions to shows usually line up with his pretty well, even if the reasons for my reaction are mostly different.

**Phantom World**

I'm ~~probably~~ definitely not going to watch the entire thing, but I might check out episode 1 for the memes.

_________________________________________________________________________________________
Thanks for the write-ups, Banjo! I can't say I always agree with your opinions, but you always explain those opinions very well, and are very helpful and friendly as you do so. The "Another Perspective" feature is especially helpful for this season, since a lot of shows seem polarizing.

> Episode 3 trigger warning

I do not think you are being petty at all!

I think it is perfectly natural [Erased Spoilers](/s "to want antagonists that are more than just 'super evil bad guys/girls.' I will argue, however, that the mom is definitely not the main antagonist, so her being just the cause for Kayo's abuse when she will presumably have very little to do with the story is fine in my eyes.")

> Episode 2 was less fun than episode 1...

No way! Episode 2 gave us [KonoSuba Spoilers](/s "Megumin, the 'chuunibyou' mage!") That literally made the anime a bajillion times better. :D

> ...and some of the sci-fi feels lolwut...

I myself smile when they show the "fourth dimension" as just the opposite direction of the x-axis (or whichever axis it is). :P

> ...the animation is just too uninspired for an anime centered around flying...

So much CG! Almost too much CG!

Thanks for your thoughts on Erased, rancame. I appreciate you posting them! :)
>> ARTICLE
>Erased Spoilers

Yeah, Erased has enough going for in the character dynamics and animation that I'm definitely not going to drop it just for a minor antagonist. I unfortunately probably won't be able to [Erased](/s "get into any of Kayo's problems that stem from her mom as much as the MC does though.")

>KonoSuba

Your Rikka is showing.^[:P](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/animevice/images/5/54/Megumin_the_Arch_Wizard_(KONOSUBA_Ep_2\).png/revision/latest?cb=20160121032151) Anyway, I think most of the problem I had with episode 2 came from me remembering the manga bits. Given how much of comedy is banked on the unexpected, I would probably have loved the episode otherwise.

No way! KonoSuba is *amazing* and Four Rhythm, while needing some sizable improvements, is not outright awful. :3

> and konasuba isnt a trapped in a video game. Its a gamified world. And it isnt a parody at all...

I consider it a "video game world" based on the quest they are on (killing the final, evil boss) the rules in place (leveling up, getting money from quests, etc.), and the characters (a party consisting of an all-rounder, a tank, a mage, and a healer). And *then* it makes fun of all of that, so I consider it a parody, too.

And the animation is by no means bad! The show has some very nice scenes and subtly animated sequences. And then the art! Don't discount the art since it achieves that country/fantastical/homely feel quite nicely. :D
>> ARTICLE
How exactly does it make fun of the gamified world in a way that isn't done by said gamified world shows? Comedy != parody. 

There are scenes in that show that look like they are reskinned DB Super keyframes.

How about this: what makes konasuba better (or even dramatically different) than DanMachi?
>> ARTICLE
> How exactly does it make fun of the gamified world in a way that isn't done by said gamified world shows?

Hrmmm!

Well, Megumin is [KonoSuba Spoilers](/s "a mage who cares more about topping the damage charts than she does sustaining DPS and actually being useful"), which I would say is a parody of most mage/caster classes. Then there is [KonoSuba Spoilers](/s "the working montage, where instead of going off on their quest and saving the day and becoming heroes, they instead spend multiple days doing remedial labor and partying and living a normal life"), which I would consider more parody. And then there is [KonoSuba Spoilers](/s "the first real joke of the series, where instead of saving the girl and dying heroically, he instead was never in danger and died in a fashion that can only be described as humiliating") which is admittedly not a parody of video games but *is* a parody of super-cool/self-insert-MCs that the "stuck in a video game" shows often contain.

Truth be told, "satire" might be a better word here, but parody is more or less a synonym. And given my previous examples (and the many more jokes and scenes already shown in these first two episodes), I would consider this anime a parody! :3

> How about this: what makes konasuba better (or even dramatically different) than DanMachi?

They are dramatically different in their approaches! KonoSuba is a comedy through-and-through whereas DanMachi was more dramatic in its events. Following this thought, KonoSuba's characters are charming and quirky -- they are not meant to be realistic or to be taken extremely seriously. DanMachi, however, had many of its characters that were designed with seriousness in mind -- Bell, Lili, Welf, and so on.

These elements make KonoSuba better -- the tighter focus ("it knows what it wants to be") and the better characters (relative to their respective approaches). Then there is the music selection (KonoSuba's ED is *divine*), the setting (again, the country/fantastical/homely feel is nice), and the "story" (KonoSuba is not worried about telling a dire tale but instead a simple one that capitalizes on its characters strengths while also keeping in mid its parody roots).

Technically DanMachi has better animation, but the character designs of KonoSuba are way better! Good details and symbolism on their outfits, as well as an interesting way to draw their mouths to add more weight to their expressions.

KonoSuba is (at least, for now!) *infinitely* better than DanMachi, and I hope my words prove so! :D
>> ARTICLE
Those are all really weak explanations.

theres nothing parody in making a few jokes.

and the characters are mostly really really weak right now. They're mainly just stupid above anything else.

all they did is take a heavy comedy approach to the "genre" (for lack of a better term) and have done nothing to parody it (and definitely not satire. Thats even further away).

of course I always hope a show will get better, but this one doesn't look very good. Its not doing anything original except in the very specific details of it.

I can't speak for anything else on this list, but Chihayafuru is a surprisingly intense show.

Easily one of my favourites, and for anyone who reads the manga, shits getting real

One of my all time favorite shows, I really enjoy sports anime and didnt think Karuta would be it but its awesome, cant wait for the live action movie with Perfume's theme song!!

Recently started Chihayafuru and I'm already loving it so much. I already know Chihaya is gonna become one of my favourite female characters by the end. There's an appalling lack of attractive but strong/tomboyish female characters in anime >:(

Oh yeah, I know it's really popular on this sub, but I haven't seen it myself. I'm not really a fan of ecchi even if it's for the sake of being over the top. Watched too many ecchi shows back when I was a teen and now I'm sick of the genre lol

I see you added it to your list on the first of the month -- was it perhaps thanks to my [WT](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/48h5ef/wt_chihayafuru_more_than_just_a_sports_anime/)?

Have you looked into [Saiunkoku Monogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/957/Saiunkoku_Monogatari)? The anime is not tagged at all, but its [source material](http://myanimelist.net/manga/13495/Saiunkoku_Monogatari) is tagged as josei. I haven't really looked into it, but I really liked the anime.
>> ARTICLE
!! I was trying to remember that one for like 10 minutes but the name never came to me. thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I was thinking about [Erin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5420/Kemono_no_Souja_Erin) as well, but I'm really not sure. Its novels were adapted into a manga featured in a shounen magazine, and the anime carries the josei, shounen, and mina (for everyone) tags on [AniDB](https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=6187) (and none on MAL).

edit: Also your Saiunkoku link is wrong.
>> ARTICLE
I was considering Erin and Moribito, but I couldn't find anything too telling about the target audiences so I opted to leave them out. same thing with The Eccentric Family, which was published in both a Seinen and a Josei magazine. some shows are pretty hard to pin down!!
>> ARTICLE
Interesting about Uchouten Kazoku, I never questioned its origin, but I could see the argument being made. [Benten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-PJLtp50Lo) is great too.

Yeah, I wish I could pin down Erin as a josei honestly lol. I originally watched it because of that tag, and Erin has become my favourite anime character. It's a wonderful coming of age. [Random fanart.](http://i.imgur.com/Ds46EUa.jpg)
>> ARTICLE
Both [Erin](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=37139) and [Moribito](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=10683) were published in shounen magazines although the Moribito novel is listed as seinen on Manga Updates.
>> ARTICLE
I haven't looked into Moribito and didn't really try to make an argument there, but Erin did feel sort of josei to me.

Both the [anime](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5420/Kemono_no_Souja_Erin) and the [manga](http://myanimelist.net/manga/18371/Kemono_no_Souja) (which was still ongoing earlier this year) were adapted/based on [novels](http://myanimelist.net/manga/11028/Kemono_no_Souja), which, from the little I've heard, are darker than the anime. While the manga was indeed published under a shounen magazine, and both are written by the same author, the manga could still very well have been adapted to a shounen audience. But then almost nobody, myself included, has read either format so I can't really comment further than gut feeling.
>> ARTICLE
Well this is a fun initiative. There's certainly titles on that list which makes me raise an eyebrow, so it'll be fun reading your future posts detailing how you decided on the demographic for them.

Either way, like I've said in the past, josei has become my favorite demographic/genre tag in the past 8-10 years and it doesn't look to be changing anytime soon.
>> ARTICLE
Demographic is basically according to the magazine the manga is published in. If it's in a josei magazine then it's a josei.

Now, "josei anime" doesn't really make sense as it is a demographic genre used only for manga prepublished in magazines. Even more with "original anime".
>> ARTICLE
> There's certainly titles on that list which makes me raise an eyebrow

A lot of times it really does just come down to when/where/how it was published, and in the case of anime adaptations it may simply be a carry-over from the source material.

Sakamichi no Apollon/Kids on the Slope is a great example. The main character is male, the plot is mostly about two males bonding as friends, and there's a major music element to it as well as some romance. There really isn't any content-based reason it would be Josei rather than Seinen - it could just as easily be either one. 

But the manga was originally serialized in Flowers, a Josei magazine, so that's the label it gets. 
>> ARTICLE
> There's certainly titles on that list which makes me raise an eyebrow

I can address any titles on the list you might have questions about now if you want. :) I'll go into more detail on general stuff in the follow up, but I can pull up sources on individual titles if you want to know specifics. thanks for showing interest!
>> ARTICLE
Oh, and before I forget, Kasei Yakyoku is a show I've been trying to get my hands on for a number of years, but have ultimately given up on. I'm assuming the number of legal ways to watch it on the internet are zero?
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sensitive about what a show is labeled as really, it's just that I personally struggle to distinguish some shoujo from josei sometimes. Like you mentioned in your post, I'm sure which demographic a show is labeled as can be as dependent on contextual clues as it is on the show itself, and I admit I'm absolutely clueless about those contextual clues.

Just to see what you have to offer though, I'll ask about the ones that immediately caught my eye: 

07-Ghost, is a show that I considered shoujo, although I can see the argument for josei based on the art.

Then there's the shows under anime originals that I considered to not have a single specific target demographic, ie Eden of the East, Michiko and Hatchin, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. 
>> ARTICLE
it can be tough to tell, because a lot of times it isn't obvious. an anime like Emma sounds Josei on paper, with its focus on romance fixated through a female gaze, but just because it was published on a seinen magazine it falls under a different category. likewise, LoGH is a series that seems tailor made for high-sci-fi military otakus, but it's repeated frequency on Shojo magazines rest on the sex appeal of the bishonen cast in ways that make things a bit murky.  
  
for 07-Ghost, it's because of the source, as it, along with Loveless, Saiyuki Reload, Dazzle, etc, come from the magazine Comic Zero Sum which caters to college aged women over younger groups.  
  
for the anime originals, that's a bit harder to gauge and would probably necessitate a post on its own, but I can do my best to give quick explanations. Eden of the East and Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 are both from pre-2010 noitaminA, a block established in order to reach the Josei demographic (known for airing Honey and Clover, Paradise Kiss, Kuragehime, etc). both aired between Nodame Cantabile and Genji Monogatari and feature grown women in the lead role, with Eden of the East going further by emphasizing a feminine lens when framing sexuality. while a weaker argument as a whole, it is important to note that both feature character designs by artists known for their contributions to Josei manga and the resulting arsthetic served as part of their advertising for the block. noitaminA has since become more of a general access block with many male oriented series airing on it since, such as Saekano, Punchline, and the currently airing Erased, but it was largely a Josei block for some time.  
  
likewise, Michiko to Hatchin was a part of Noise, a sub-block of Fuji TV that was partnered with Josei-era noitaminA. the two other works to air on that block, Ristorante Paradiso and Aoi Hana, were Josei titles from Monthly Erotics F, and director Sayo Yamamoto has described her intention with the series to be directed at an older female audience (which sort of justifies a placement for Fujiko Mine, but that series pulls a demographic subversion that makes it hard to place as well). I'll pull up an interview, gimme a sec as I'm on my phone. :)  
  
hope this helped!!
>> ARTICLE
>an anime like Emma sounds Josei on paper, with its focus on romance fixated through a female gaze, but just because it was published on a seinen magazine it falls under a different category

Comic Beam isn't really a typical "seinen magazine", it only gets categorized as such because it has more males reading it. It's intended to be an alternative comics magazine for people who are actually interested in comics as an art (as is obvious from its [amazing covers](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=&oq=) and its tagline), hence the mix of josei and seinen artists. If Hourou Musuko, Emma and Fancy Gigolo Pelu are seinen then the demographics classification is kind of worthless.
>> ARTICLE
TIL my taste in Anime is like a woman in her late 20s...


>> ARTICLE
Great, thanks a lot for that write up. Surprisingly, despite having watched anime for exactly 30 years this year, I have never paid attention to which time block a show aired during in Japan, in fact, I only started paying attention to animation studios in the past several years.  I don't know if it was just my group of friends or if that information wasn't so readily available 'back in the days', but that's just how it was for me. Thanks again, and take your time, I'm in no rush here!
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, a lot of old time anime viewer usually don't keep in mind the show time of anime or the block it's on. That's usually for Japanese audiences to figure out. It all gets jumbled when it comes out to the west, especially with vague gender descriptors, as some shows even go as far as to have appeal through vastly different audiences. Some even bridge the shounen/shoujo audiences too. So it's not that strange for genre differences to be a bit gray at times.
>> ARTICLE
I been watching anime sense 1990. So I feel ya on the watching for ever part. 
>> ARTICLE
whoa, 30 years is hella impressive!!  
  
ahh I getcha completely; I've been at this for some time but the majority of my formative years with the medium were spent focusing on content over context. I think it was only once fansub culture kicked off that the dialogue became more academic, to the point where I was able to to write a few papers back in uni on its more technical aspects without talking out of my butt or looking like too much of a weeb. availability of information has definitely grown since the days of *Central Park Media Presents* and *Japanimation*, which is great for a film studies nut like me. :) always happy to help, good talk!
>> ARTICLE
Ha, it's really not something to be impressed about. It's like saying "I've read books for my entire life", haha. I was introduced to anime by my uncle who traveled to Japan a lot for business. One time he brought back a the entire video tape collection of Mobile Suit Gundam to show my cousins and I because he heard it was all the rage in Japan. We watched those tapes so many times, we just couldn't get enough. After that he'd bring back different mecha shows each time he came home from his travels and that was all the exposure I had to the medium until many years later in life. Even then, though, the pace at which I watched anime was never anywhere close to that of most people on these forums today.

>I think it was only once fansub culture kicked off that the dialogue became more academic, to the point where I was able to to write a few papers back in uni on its more technical aspects 

That's incredible. Despite watching anime for so long, it wasn't something I had ever looked at from a technical perspective, much less an academic perspective. I don't think I'd even know where to start! Whether it's Western or Eastern media, I am but a simple consumer and my academic interests were always towards the life sciences, which didn't leave much room for me to explore the arts and humanities. It really is amazing to see how this sub-culture has evolved over the years!
>> ARTICLE
Back then, you had versions of shows that were heavily edited for broadcast like Star Blazers (from Space Battleship Yamato), Battle of the Planets (Gatchaman), Voltron, and Robotech. I remember coming home from school and watching Robotech, then getting up early on Saturday to watch as well.
>> ARTICLE
> likewise, LoGH is a series that seems tailor made for high-sci-fi military otakus, but it's repeated frequency on Shojo magazines rest on the sex appeal of the bishonen cast in ways that make things a bit murky.

If you've noticed, all the characters in One Piece became ripped sometime during it's production. This was due to a decision by WSJ to put bishounen males in all their series in order to appeal to a periphery shoujo demographic (indeed, WSJ is one of the most popular magazines read by young girls in Japan). The demo tags are fluid and usually magazines are trying to appeal to multiple ones.

>> ARTICLE
for sure, great point!! heck, most sports manga up the ante on manservice and queerbaiting in ways that make some Shoujos look tame by comparison. with works like Orange going from a Shoujo mag to a Seinen one and Dazzle jumping from Shounen to Josei, nothing's really cut and dry nor is it all super obvious, mostly having to do with technicalities. drmographics are weird, which is something I'll definitely touch upon in the follow up. :)
>> ARTICLE
I'd be fascinated to see your rationale for including Simoun. It's one of my personal favorites, but it would never have occurred to me to call it josei.
>> ARTICLE
whoa someone on the sub who's seen Simoun! :o  
  
Simoun's a case of promotion playing a big part in the definition. while it wears its Ursula Le Guin feminist sci-fi influences on its face, the biggest clue comes from (yet again) the context: leading up to its release, it was able to launch a manga adaptation on Comic Yuri Hime, home to the current big Josei yuri manga Citrus. the magazine has since merged with its Seinen sister manga, but at the time it was purely aimed at female readerships. interestingly, even after the merger the predominantly shoujo-ai magazine has still retained a mostly Josei audience, with over 70% of readers being women!

I really, really, really would love a second season of Kuragehime.

It's been a while since I watched it, but I remember that show having a pretty satisfactory ending. I don't remember feeling like there needed to be more.
>> ARTICLE
It was satisfactory [](/s "since they 'saved' the Amamizu household"), but it ended right as Kuranosuke and Tsukimi were beginning to dive into the world of fashion together.

I wanted to see that develop, plus it wouldn't hurt seeing the cast all together again for 12 more episodes of fun.

I agree. The anime was far too short. Thankfully, the manga is on Crunchyroll.

Oh, it is? I guess I should get reading soon, if the anime gods won't hear my prayer for a new season.
>> ARTICLE
Yep. They have 11 volumes up under the English title, Princess Jellyfish. That's not up to date with the Japanese edition, but they've been steadily adding new volumes.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! Seems like a pretty neglected genre in anime though. Is this because studios aren't inclined to adapt *josei* work, or because there isn't as much *josei* source material (mangas, LNs) in the first place?
>> ARTICLE
It's because the market for anime/anime-discs is still unproven while manga/LNs sell great on their own. So they just don't bother adapting it because they feel it already achieved financial success. Though more josei stuff faring well in anime disc sales in recent years probably means they will at least try to adapt popular josei content to anime.
>> ARTICLE
Awesome list Spira :3 Since I've been watching Honey and Clover with /r/xxanime and I *love* it, I'm gonna have to start watching more Josei! I think Kuragehime or Paradise Kiss will be next. ^ ^

> Consider this somewhat of a precursor to a greater project I have in store, which'll study the different aspects of anime categorization in essay form, with the first part coming up in about a week or so regarding this very same subject (what constitutes a demographic, what is josei and what it isn't). **That essay will also explain why the likes of Nana and Sazae-san are absent, among other things. :)**


>> ARTICLE
Wait Sazae-san is a josei?
>> ARTICLE
sorta yes, sorta no. the manga from '46 was clearly directed at an older female readership, stressing Sazae-san's perspective as both a mother and a woman to comment on contemporary issues. the anime, however, runs on daytime children's TV blocks almost exclusively, making a demographic shift upon adaptation. it's unusual, but it happens. 
>> ARTICLE
You do know that Sazae-san was originally a comic-strip in newspaper, right? It wasn't directed at an older female readership. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, OP says there is a reason that it isn't on the list but doesn't elaborate as to what it is. I have to say that having it off the list without giving the explanation kinda makes me doubt the list. lol
>> ARTICLE
since I hadn't planned on getting into it now, the general thing is that Nana was published on Cookie, a fashion magazine listed under Shueisha's shojo line (as listed by the publishers s-manga.net domain). it gets miscategorized as Josei by Wikipedia and other gaijin outlets because it "seems" Josei, but it's shojo. I hope this sates your curiosity, as well as /u/celestial_jet 's, regarding its lack of mention. :)
>> ARTICLE
Feels like a technicality, haha :)
>> ARTICLE
> Feels like a technicality

That's literally what genre delineations are.
>> ARTICLE
Well, it's the literal definition of the word. Japanese often label things with demo tags in ways that are surprising to a western audience. Many things labelled as "shonen", nobody would ever think of as a "young boys" series in the US (the WttNHK manga, for instance, was published in a shonen magazine).
>> ARTICLE
NHK is always one of my go-to examples for "why demographics don't always mean what you think they mean." it marks off a lot of usual suspects, such as age of the protagonist, content rating, and thematic presentation, all working against conventions people usually associate with "Shounen". same thing goes with titles like Nozaki-kun, Hetalia, or Inuyasha, which most people would usually associate with shoujos, it's all just so nebulous, so when people complain about Nana being a josei and not a shoujo it just boils down to misunderstanding of what exactly demographics are.
>> ARTICLE
Hachimitsu to Clover or Honey and Clover is great and I would recommend to anyone who has any interest in comedy,romance, or slice of life shows.


Two things that make it stand out in mind is that it is a college setting. An art college specifically, but u won't be seeing any highschool hijinks here. Not only that,but as the series progresses the characters will eventually graduate and set out and find jobs. I know many of ranime like me are college students so many of the challenges the characters go through will be extremely relatable.


It also has   enjoyable and believable love triangles. IMO many romance anime are ruined by how they handle love triangles, but u can't help but root for every pairing in this show as every potential couple has their pros and cons.


That being said there are a lot of laughs to be had here,and if romance  or drama isn't your thing it is definitely gag heavy without ever feeling forced.


Along with a cast of lovable and believable characters there is so much this show does right. Don't let the term Josei dissuade you as when this show came out it was well-known for being  popular among teenage and adult men as well as women. 


Women's Day or not give Honey and Clover a shot. You won't regret it!

I'd love to know what makes Sekaiichi Hatsukoi a Josei anime, but Junjou Romantica not. I've always grouped these two series together since they feel very similar (which makes sense, considering they're in the same world)
>> ARTICLE
hahaha that ones kinda funny actually, as it has a bit of an in-world explanation. the Emerald magazine worked on by the characters of the show is actually the magazine that publishes the series in real life. like the show, it's a for-women-by-women magazine meant to publish stories too mature for Asuka Ciel, its shojo sister magazine. Junjou moved onto Emerald recently (I didn't actually know this), but that was way after the series had been made (save for the third season). hence, Junjou is basically the Shoujo edition of Sekaiichi Hatsukoi.

That's really interesting to know, thanks!
>> ARTICLE
What do you think about considering Utena as a josei? While it's an original anime whose parallel manga ran on a shoujo magazine and it's pretty consolidated as a "shoujo anime", I can't stop thinking that it was made for the girls who grew up with classical mahou shoujo and are now able to recognise hidden stuff on the media they consume. Plus some themes hit harder on the audience precisely because they're grown (like Utena wanting to be a prince, a small girl would think nothing about it but a grown person would see and appreciate the dissonance of the idea and what it's trying to convey).
>> ARTICLE
good point!! I absolutely think it has Josei appeal and has that demographic in mind to a point, just like the other two Ikuhara originals (the constant allusions to 70's shoujo motifs in Penguindrum and the strict focus on queer-feminism in Yuri Kuma make the case for an intended older female audience over their typical Seinen allocation). at the same time, though, it establishes itself as a shoujo in order to frame the dialogue in a purposeful way: Ikuhara was trying to package the point of the series in order to get young girls to watch it and be influenced by its message. women watching would understand the means with which he's developing his points, but the ones who would benefit the most from it are the girls from Utena's age group, which is why it adopts the form it does and was advertised in that way. similar comparison can be used to explain the Shonen magazine marketing techniques behind Evangelion, another series that's as dark as night and somehow aimed a bit young.  
  
Adolescence of Utena, though? yeah, I can totally make a case for a Josei tag on that one, but would have to work a bit to develop one.

yeah it's a real shame we don't get them too often, I almost never get dissapointed by works catered to the demographic and would *love* to see some of my favs get adapted (a 7seeds or Helter Skelter adaptation is a frickin dream of mine). :( what're some you'd like to see be made?
>> ARTICLE
Some I'd like might be too short for series adaptations (since they are oneshots or not too long) but from longer works, Real Clothes, Oishii Kankei or Ashita no ousama would be great (though chances for those are 0). 

Some of Yoshihara's works I think would be fun as shorts since they are quite random and comedic and might even feel better than in manga form (though not sure that can happen considering the nature of those).

As much as I'd love to see some of those smutty romance ones like Hapi Mari or Private prince (or that other one with the vampire boss, can't recall the name)...I doubt that will ever happen either.

The ones that I have some hopes on from the ones I'm reading are the ones still not completed like [Sumika Sumire](http://myanimelist.net/manga/66781/Sumika_Sumire) that is really sweet so far and [Honey Sweet Kitchen](http://myanimelist.net/manga/42373/Honey_Sweet%E2%99%A5Kitchen) (totally didn't start this because of Yamamoto's characters that I mentioned yesterday ^^^^yes, ^^^^I ^^^^did... )

I'm not gonna pretend like josei is my favourite genre since I've only watched a few, but the ones I have watched are DAMN good. We seriously need more josei anime. Anime studios, hear our cries!
>> ARTICLE
Same. I've completed 4 of them, 2 are in my top 15-20. The other ones that I've started are very good as well.
>> ARTICLE
Out of this entire list, do you have a favorite?

I'm definitely willing to check one out, I'm down for anything.  Haven't seen any of these shows.
>> ARTICLE
Not OP, but [Usagi Drop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10162/Usagi_Drop) is most likely the safest place to start; it's almost impossible to not like it.
>> ARTICLE
Very true. I also quite like Princess Jellyfish.
>> ARTICLE
If you're in to classical music at all, Nodame Cantabile is fantastic.
>> ARTICLE
picking a favorite is a bit hard, as Hachimitsu to Clover, Sakamichi no Apollon, and Natsuyuki Rendezvous are in my top 10 of all time, with the currently airing Shouwa Rakugo making a good case to find itself on that list as well!!  
  
as a starter, I would probably opt for either Omoide Poroporo or Usagi Drop as they have the most universal appeal, but from there any of those aforementioned would make a great next step (though Natsuyuki Rendezvous is known to be quite divisive). 
>> ARTICLE
Natsuyuki Rendezvous was amazing.  I get the criticisms, and it's not perfect (it really needed to establish the characters and their relationships more before diving into the body-possession stuff) but it had an emotional core and dealt with relationships in ways that the vast majority of anime never even attempts.
>> ARTICLE
> though Natsuyuki Rendezvous is known to be quite divisive

One of my favorites as well, but those middle episodes tested my patience the first time through for sure. More than anything, it's because of the way the show tackles the theme of love and life after death that it holds such a place in my heart.
>> ARTICLE
Jyu Oh Sei is josei? Really?
>> ARTICLE
I had it listed because I figured the artistry and the placement in early days noitaminA were relevant enough indicators, but I had no idea it was based on a pre-existing source in a shojo magazine, so I ended up scratching it off the list. sorry for the confusion. ;(
>> ARTICLE
No its alright its an honest mistake hell I didn't even know Jyu Oh Sei was from a shojo
>> ARTICLE
Possibly because it aired on the [noitanimA block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noitamina), which was established particularly to expand the josei market. 

But then why not others from this block and era like Hataraki Man - was it just the studio, etc?
>> ARTICLE
Hataraki Man is one of those titles I *really* wanted to list but its origins on Weekly Morning makes it fall into a weird place. in a similar way, Moyashimon and Hourou Musuko also make compelling arguments for a Josei tag based on theme and presentation, but their sources convolute things. 
>> ARTICLE
I was wondering about that too.  I love the series, but I don't know what makes it josei (except that the title sounds similar).
>> ARTICLE
Damn, what a nice list. Thank you so much OP for creating this list. Josei as genre somehow for me always being overshadowed with shoujo. Even though mostly I watch shounen or slice of life, sometimes I crave for more josei. And this list really helps. Thank you! 
>> ARTICLE
I shall now make it my goal in life to watch every Josei anime. After all, there are barely any - I wonder why that is?
>> ARTICLE
looking at Shouwa Rakugo's underwhelming BD sales from the last two weeks (sub 2k overall) tells me that its pretty risky investment overall as the market is a bit niche. the golden age was mid-2000s noitaminA (when Nodame Cantabile made a case for its financial viability), but their last Josei was years ago and Fuji TV, alongside most broadcasters, has opted to adapt Josei as TV dramas in lieu of anime. the assumption is probably that most women prefer evening television (true) and would rather spend money on mech shows or sports anime when it came to spending money on anime at all (also true). really unfortunate, but I can see why. :/
>> ARTICLE
RIP noitaminA

You kept anime alive for me through the bitter 2000s
>> ARTICLE
Dang, I didn't realise that Shouwa Rakugo was performing that poorly. But then again, it makes sense since majority of anime's demographic wouldn't be able to get into josei that easily.
>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru also had pretty low sales. But it boosted sales of the manga enough that it got a second season.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, as a woman, I'm surprised that I've only seen 3 on the list:

- Princess Jellyfish (Kuragehime)

- Eden of the East (Higashi no Eden)

- Jyu Oh Sei

It's interesting how a lot of the shows I've watched turn out to be Shounen when I never thought they would be.
>> ARTICLE
I'm on the same boat, tbh. I think a greater part of all the anime I've seen have been Shounen, even some titles I would've never thought to label that way: the idea that Nabari no Ou and Kuroshitsuji were directed towards guys at any capacity kinda blows my mind. :p
>> ARTICLE
>(Ones not listed on MyAnimeList as Josei will have a * next to them, including those mislabeled as "Shoujo" or any other demographic.) 
  
Wow, there are a lot of anime not properly listed as Josei...  
  
Thank you so much for this, Spira!! While watching Rakugo this season, I realized just how few josei I've read/watched... I think the only other one on this list is the Usagi Drop manga (which took quite a turn towards the end).   
  
I am super excited to add a bunch of these to my PTW and expand more of my anime reach!

that's the list I was working on, /u/MissyPie. :) I could develop it more and give it some kind of form that's a bit more comprehensive and post it later, though when touching on feminism on this sub I may have to put more work into it than I have the time to deliver rn so's to stir things up in the least explosive way possible. I might post it on r/xxanime soon once I got it figured out and gauge whether or not people would want it here!!
>> ARTICLE
It's a great list ^ ^ The one show I haven't ever heard about on there is Red Garden, and it looks really interesting! I kind of want to watch it asap :o

>so's to stir things up in the least explosive way possible

Heh, yeah. Not just this sub but on any semi-large sub in general imo :p As long as you're concise and informative without using any "buzzwords" that most of Reddit doesn't like, I'm sure it'll go over well! /r/anime is more open to stuff like that than you'd think, in my experience. 

Please do post it on /r/xxanime <3!
>> ARTICLE
Just a thought, but maybe consider preserving these lists in a wiki entry or sticky on either this or /r/xxanime?  I'm just a dude, but imo these would make fantastic go-to references for helping the women and/or dakimakura in our lives with recommendations beyond the usual titles.

Also /u/Spiranix, this is a really great thread for today.
>> ARTICLE
Hm yes, I think I'll add it as a link to the Rec wiki. Nice idea. :D

I have plans for a user created recommendation wiki on /r/xxanime already, so when I finally get around to that, I'm sure we could include this there too!

Hmm, after seeing this list I only realize how rarely I watch Josei. I've only watched 2 Josei anime (Nodame, Usagi)
>> ARTICLE
I highly suggest Honey and Clover. In my opinion, it has some of the most relatable characters and moral dilemmas related to love I have ever seen in anime.

Great list, would be better if you didn't show all the ovas and sequels though.

Oh good I have watched one of them on the list to completion, Natsuyuki Rendezvous and I watched one episode of Usagi Drop.   
Edit: Eden of the East also, but I didn't think that counted

Would Kimi wa Pet /Tramps Like Us qualify?

It is josei but it doesn't have an anime adaptation. The drama is good!

07-Ghost was Josei? I loved reading the manga but I never looked at the tags. Also, Usagi Drop is a solid 20/10.

Thank you so much for this! I watched Usagi Drop not too long ago and loved it. Currently watching Shouwa genroku rakugo shinjuu and it is my favourite anime this season. Will definitely check out the rest of the shows on this list! 
>> ARTICLE
What about [Himitsu: Top Secret](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3859/Himitsu__The_Revelation)? On MAL it's listed as shoujo and the manga it's based on as well, however [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himitsu_%E2%80%93_Top_Secret) classified it as *josei*. Personally, I'd say it's way too mature to be considered shoujo, so I'd like to hear another opinion about this.

Nice list though!
>> ARTICLE
hmm, that ones a bit tricky. I'll look into it closer, since [mangaupdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/publishers.html?pubname=Melody) and Wikipedia both list Melody as a shojo magazine, yet both sources present conflicting information regarding soecific titles. this could prove Himitsu as a Josei, or discredit both it and Jyuu Oh Sei, I'll have to study it a bit. thanks, good find!
>> ARTICLE
I've had Nodame Cantabile for a long time on my PTW list. Seeing as today is IWD, I think I'm gonna start this tonight.

Great shit, OP!

If you're including Saiyuki Gaiden then you should maybe include Saiyuki as well. Shouldn't be a big deal, GFantasy is one of the least-shounen shounen magazines I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
I'll make a note for the people looking at the title and wondering about a watch order. thanks. :)
>> ARTICLE
I would have never thought of Loveless as a Josei. I always categorized it as similar to Kuroshitsuji because of the shota elements (and it felt like it toed that line much more closely than Kuroshitsuji as well), but I can see why it's categorized as Josei. It does have much more overt sexual elements. I mean the a major part of their society is that the lose their ears when they have sex for the first time. I feel like rewatching it because I loved it as a teen, but I wonder how I'll feel about it watching it as an adult. 
>> ARTICLE
I've got more time than yesterday so thought I'd go through the list and my list to check some more :

Hatenkou Yuugi :  

I'll guess that Hatenkou Yuugi is in the list for the same reason 07 Ghost is, however Comic Zero Sum is targeted at women of all ages and not just josei as wikipedia states. I'm using old stats here but more than 80% of their readers used to be female with about 40% of those being teenagers. I don't really mind it being labelled either shoujo or josei (since the target seems 50-50) but the magazine publishes works for both demographics. That coupled with the age of the heroine and the general feel of the manga really makes me think it's shoujo (though it's been ages since I both read and watched this). Why MAL lists it as Shounen though...well except the general feel sometimes...I have no idea O_O

I won't argue the rest from the same magazine because those (the ones I've read at least) do have elements to make them more josei than shoujo.

Kuro to Kin no Hirakanai Kagi :  

They should make a separate demographic for that. The content doesn't justify the shoujo tag that it has but I'm having trouble categorising it as josei, too.

As for things that could be added but depends on why you added others or if you are strict with certain tags :

[Makai Ouji: Devils and Realist](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16890/Makai_Ouji__Devils_and_Realist) : This is another one from Comic Zero Sum. I would say the source is mostly josei due to the cast (which also applies to the anime) but it can really be called either shoujo or josei. 

[Bronze: Zetsuai Since 1989](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1042/Bronze__Zetsuai_Since_1989) : Honestly I'm not sure about this so I'm just throwing it out there but the source, although initially in a shoujo magazine it later changed to a josei one. Thing is I have no idea what this OVA adapts since I haven't watched it yet.

[Himitsu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3859/Himitsu__The_Revelation) : This one is a bit odd. Some sites list the source as shoujo while others as josei. Problem is that the publication is shoujo (even though Melody has published a few josei, but not many) but the content seems quite more mature which is probably why people call it josei. To be honest, the anime could as well be a seinen, since it's more fitting than either of the others (except the designs which tend to be on the classic shoujo side). I'd say this one is shoujo, but thought I'd mention it anyway.

[Tomoe ga Yuku](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4927/) : Content is mature and it was published in Betsucomi which is purely shoujo but you will notice that neither manga or anime have any demographic tagged, probably because nobody could decide what this was :P

[Deimos no Hanayome](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5918/Deimos_no_Hanayome) : The content is definitely mature but I haven't read the source, only watched the OVA here. Going strictly by source though it ran on Princess which is purely shoujo.

These for now. I'm sure I have more in my list like the above but I'm not sure how to track them down easily. Let me know in advance next time!

^^^^<3













>> ARTICLE
> Hatenkou Yuugi  
  
I've been meaning to look into the figures for Comic Zero Sum since I had a few questions about it, especially since the transition from shounen-to-josei seems a bit extreme for the likes of Dazzle and Saiyuki, so I was thinking about whether or not there's a specific trend to distinguish them. I'll look into it more and see if I can pull up anything that denotes whether or not it's ever explicitly referenced as "josei" by publishers, but for Dazzle in particular I was referring to [the mangaupdates page](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=5028)! I think it may've been listed as shounen just cause it originally ran on GFantasy!  
  
> Kuro to Kin  
  
I was also a bit split with this one, cause like, well you know. >_< unlike [Rouge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/25623/Rouge__Ladys_Comic_Video) or [Belladonna](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3220/Kanashimi_no_Belladonna) (which I may have to add in as well) which package themselves as erotic fiction for women, Kuro to Kin is very much a type of shoujo smut that teeters on gray zones I have no idea how to pin down. I went with the justification that the original game was rated 18+, but in that case I suppose titles like [Togainu no Chi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8449/Togainu_no_Chi) or [Dramatical Murder](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23333/DRAMAtical_Murder) would count under those parameters as well, maybe? haven't seen either show so I can't tell if they take after the shoujo-oriented rereleases/adaptations of the source material or not to decide. :/ good point though, I wish this were easier!!  
  
> Makai Ouji  
  
adding it in, thanks! I actually had this one open on a seperate tab but I guess I forgot to actually put it in at the last second.  
  
> Bronze  
  
interesting, I've never actually heard of this one. :o apparently it's the second part of the Zetsuai series, but only the [third part](http://myanimelist.net/manga/33765/Bronze__The_Final_Chapter) of the manga ran on a josei publication, though, just like you, I haven't read it nor watched it so idk if that's the part that was adapted. this did lead to me do a lil bit of research into some other Yaoi/BL titles, and apparently [Sensitive Pornograph](http://myanimelist.net/anime/741/Sensitive_Pornograph) and [Ai no Kusabi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/719/Ai_no_Kusabi) (both releases) were based off titles from June (June Comics Piace Series and Shousetsu June, respectively) which are listed as Josei publications. should I make a separate tab for titles with a Rx content rating?  
  
> Himitsu  
  
that one is certainly tricky, but I can't find anything to support the notion that Melody nor its publishers recognize it or label it as a Josei publication, so I ended up going with it as being part of a gray zone (which is also why I scratched off Jyu Oh Sei from the list, until someone whose read the manga can tell me if the noitaminA adaptation makes a case for a higher demographic shift or not).  
  
> Tomoe ga Yuku  
  
omfg this art style, this is so old school. hmm I'll put a tab on it to check it out and see for myself, but as far as I'm reading it seems to be like Nana and Life in the sense of being a more mature but still shoujo kinda shoujo, which is also noted on mangaupdates. same with Deimos no Hanayome (which, btw, looks super interesting. how is it?)  
  
thanks a ton for helping out again, I really appreciate it! hopefully between us we can make the truest list of josei works out there. :)
>> ARTICLE
Personally I don't mind Hatenkou Yuugi as either as I mentioned but I do think it's shoujo with what I mentioned in mind. Then again, instead of taking the heroine into account we could take the guys into account, which then makes it a bit more believable as a josei.

Kuro to Kin I'd say scratch it off the list, personally. While not a hentai, I can't see it as shoujo or josei however designs are probably shoujo. 

I didn't list those BL ones because they are too many and I'd say since they have been toned down for the anime versions, they are mostly shoujo (except that freaky Dramatical Murder OVA maybe O_O). 

The yaoi ones you listed are also partly josei (as well as some others) but I don't think they'd fit in since...well I guess that should be an entirely different list on its own.

Himitsu is definitely shoujo, only reason it's mentioned as josei is due to the themes. If we change the demographic due to the themes then we could as well have it as seinen (which the anime adaptation is closer to). Jyu Oh Sei is also def shoujo, I didn't mention it since you had it scratched off.

If you are going purely on where it was published, Tomoe ga Yuku is shoujo (Betsucomi), same as Deimos no Hanayome (Princess). About Deimos no Hanayome, it's one of those OVA that they gave a great summary to but the episode isn't like that at all! They probably adapted some side story instead? Not sure since I haven't read the manga. I liked the old designs and sound though (tend to dig those, they are nostalgic).

The Life manga, since you mentioned it, is shoujo due to the publication but also due to the heroine and setting (even with the more mature theme). They could have tagged this as josei if they wanted but the target audience wasn't that. This is easier to spot with other Bessatsu Friend publications like Deep Love. The Deep Love series...well....Ayu, Host and Pao are shoujo...yet Reina is Josei. Every single one of them can probably destroy you with their mature themes, cold reality and tragic events. They share characters, settings, events, themes, everything...yet only Reina is josei just because it's focused on Reina after the main series when she was 19...even if the other ones would probably need to be targeted to a higher age. Main heroine is taken into account very often to determine the demographic in these magazines.

Honestly though these don't bother me, since we are talking about how to list them, I thought I'd mention these. Been a shoujo addict since growing up with Sailor Moon and reruns of [these](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3754/) [stuff](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3022/) that I still have on some VHS thrown away somewhere. The shoujo manga addiction came much later but it kinda took over me over the years (pretty sure I've read a few hundred shoujo titles over the years), especially on the days of my HanaKimi and Skip Beat madness that we'd group edit the scans and translations on yahoo groups, irc and a certain manga forum that died later that I used to help mod the shoujo corner. I think this is one addiction that hasn't left me over the years :P

I'm not sure how to look them up easily since I haven't tagged them myself (plus my MAL is a new account I made since I forgot my old one so some of the ones I had are probably not even there...I still add titles I've watched before sometimes)...but this should be a pretty complete list already.

As for the shoujo version of this, it was partly what I was meaning to do with what I told you on FTF (which is why I said it's more targeted towards a certain demographic) though of course not as full since those are quite a few hundred titles. If that's what you plan, let me know.

whoa that's awesome!!!!! I'm super excited to see what you'll do for a shoujo write-up with all that familiarity! the original plan is a sort of "let me give you a description of what a genre/demographic/term is, and sort of refute any misconceptions about it", but I'd of course want to bring in consultants to handle their own favorite genres and have this be a multi-prong project. if you want to take a part in it, I'd love to collaborate, but if you want to do it as your own thing I'll totally veer away from doing anything that might step on your toes there!
>> ARTICLE
> whoa that's awesome!!!!!

I've been trying to find some of those old shows btw for years with no luck (the originals hopefully). The popular ones that were on TV like Macross, Gatchaman, Voltron, Plawres Sanshirou, Candy Candy, Ulysses 31, Tekkaman, Gundam Wing are easy to find but others like [this with subs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2361/Sei_Juushi_Bismarck), [this with subs](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2510/Sengoku_Majin_Goushougun) (only managed to find some raws and not fully), Step June and other stuff that kept going on reruns here but never made it to actual releases are impossible to find fully :( Now that I think about it I grew up with more mecha than shoujo shows...

> shoujo write-up

That's the thing, I'm not good with write ups as I told you before, that's why I mentioned if I do something it won't be WT like, or someone else has to take over that part, lol.

> sort of refute any misconceptions about it

Which is what made me think of this as well...seen so many people who think every shoujo show is a romance show. And other ones too  but that's another issue...

> if you want to take a part in it, I'd love to collaborate

I do! As I said, if I do something it will probably be a list/suggestions thing since I can't write imo (also probably for xx instead since I kinda doubt the reception here for shoujo would be the same as for josei). I planned both josei and shoujo as a list (with the second being less complete) but you've done more than great with this one, I love it!

> I'll totally veer away

Don't even mention that. I think you'd do much better in writing these, I like reading what you put together! Plus, you tend to write what I think anyway, lol.


>> ARTICLE
Never seen any Josei anime, because I'm not entirely sure that things aimed at older women would be appealing to me as a teenager-almost-adult male... but if you could recommend one of these to me, what one would it be?

....Are any of them mecha anime? That always helps work me into a genre/demographic lol I enjoyed Escaflowne which was Shoujo so I don't see why I can't enjoy this either!
>> ARTICLE
unfortunately I can't think of any Josei mecha titles. :( there are quite a few shoujo ones as far as I remember, namely [Magic Knight Rayearth](http://myanimelist.net/anime/435/Magic_Knight_Rayearth), [Aquarion Evol](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10447/Aquarion_Evol?q=Aquarion), and, to a point, [Star Driver](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8934/Star_Driver__Kagayaki_no_Takuto), most mecha shows either aim specifically for male audiences or cast a wide net so's to appeal to multiple genders and age groups all at once (the Gundam series is known for this, especially with Bishonen heavy entries like 00 or romance heavy entries such as 08th MS). the only Josei title I think sort of falls into the mecha category would be [Simoun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/879/Simoun), though its mechanical design is [pretty far from the norm](http://www.geocities.jp/emiri_0623/V-simoun_03-ep17.jpg) in terms of standard mecha fair.  
  
however, if romance or slice of life isn't your thing, but you're more into action shows, there's definitely some Josei titles I'd consider looking into. for example, [Michiko and Hatchin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4087/Michiko_to_Hatchin) often gets compared to Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon in terms of its raw grit, while something like [Saiyuki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/129/Gensoumaden_Saiyuuki) and its sequels are just generally well rounded fantasy adventure series (along with the other Zero Sum titles such as Amatsuki, Karneval, and 07-Ghost). perhaps the easiest Josei title to recommend for a young adult male would probably be [Eden of the East](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5630/Higashi_no_Eden), since it's generally just a really good sci-fi/political thriller.  
  
hope I helped. :,)

Huh. TIL I've never seen a Josei anime.. 

Which from the list would you guys recommend to start with? 
>> ARTICLE
Not OP but here are my suggestions:

* Gokusen
* Hachimitsu to Clover
* Nodame Cantabile

There are a ton of great anime on this list but I think these 3 are pretty neutral with diverse casts.  I think the last two are just  relatable if you went to college in general (though super relatable for those who went to an art or music school).  Gokusen is just a lot of fun.

>> ARTICLE
Chihayafuru is a good one.

Is there an easy way fr me to sort by mal score without clicking each one?
>> ARTICLE
For the ones that are listed as josei on MAL you can go [here](http://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43) and sort by score, if they aren't sorted by that already.

The ones that have * next to them in this thread aren't listed as josei on MAL so you'll have to check each title.
>> ARTICLE
I find it funny that the first link that comes up when I google Milky Passion has a disclaimer about it not being hentai.
>> ARTICLE
I would think Nana and Paradise Kiss fit pretty well on this, no?


Good list, thanks for putting it together!
>> ARTICLE
I never thought of Higashi no Eden as a Josei, but it was still awesome.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not sure how you classified Genji Monogatari as a josei as it is a classic book originally. 
It's like saying that Harry Potter is a shounen.

> Karneval

I remember watching the first two episodes after a friend of mine recommended it to me. It was *fine* yet terribly boring. Since I'm one of those guys who *have* to finish an anime once started some day, I really do not look forward to it. If anyone can convince me otherwise, I'd greatly appreciate it.
>> ARTICLE
wow, that's a pretty small list.
>> ARTICLE
Is any of these similar to Nodame?
>> ARTICLE
~~I'm trying to figure out what context is needed to make "Milky passion" not a hentai~~

Omoide Poroporo (Only Yesterday) is my favorite anime of all time.  It's one of the few animes that's truly made for adults and not targeted toward the anime crowd.

I started Nana a couple days ago because it was on netflix and seemed like good background noise going to sleep.

I've completed 4 of these, 2 I've seen some, and 2 I know a bit of the source material but haven't seen.

The Shouwa Genroku OVA is just the first 48 minutes episode of the anime. Probably could leave that off the list.
>> ARTICLE
How are josei anime for men?
>> ARTICLE
I say use the demographic to think about the kind of perspective you should be tackling it with, but for the most part it should be fine. some Josei titles, such as Usagi Drop and Sakamichi no Apollon, should resonate with men in a different but still effective way, while other titles, like Natsuyuki Rendezvous and Paradise Kiss, might be harder to get into because they adopt a certain type of gaze that might not make too much sense for guys. lots of my favs are seinen titles and I'm a woman, so I don't think there should be too big of a barrier so long as you're picking wisely. :P
>> ARTICLE
You will probably like some, probably hate some as well. It is a broad genre and there is something to relate for most people but YMMV. For me I really enjoyed nodame cantabile
>> ARTICLE
nice josei list without NANA, seems legit
>> ARTICLE
I said there was a reason for its absence in the header post. :p if you want to know what that reason is, refer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/49i7ic/celebrating_womens_day_a_list_of_every_single/d0s3d6w). simply put, it's a shojo not a Josei. 
>> ARTICLE
that's such a strange technicality... I guess if you're making a list of anime which are technically josei then it makes sense, but I assumed you were trying to provide a more comprehensive collection for viewers who wanted to watch series containing themes/ideas generally targeting josei (which Nana most certainly does, if you've seen the anime)
>> ARTICLE
Genres are based on technicalities like this. There is no objective measure beyond time slots/magazines intended audiences. Basing it on MC's age won't help as often we have shows that look at adolescence from the perspective of an adult, for example, and perspective isn't something that can be judged objectively.
>> ARTICLE
Disregarding sales and popularity, one thing that has me hopeful is the fact that the anime adaptation is going to end basically half way through the whole 10 volume manga series. Which makes it perfect for another 12 or 13 episode series to round it off.
>> ARTICLE
> However there has been no news yet on a second season of this.

I think you answered your own question so I don't see how any of us could help you. 

> how is the sales doing in Japan

Vol 1 sold 2k disc sales.

Ok, I changed the question to do you think there will be a second season.

If terraformers got a second season, i don't see why not?

Ok I redid the question. It's now do YOU think it will get a second season?

>> ARTICLE
Is that good or bad?
>> ARTICLE
Nope it's a flop, so chances of it getting a second season are pretty slim.
>> ARTICLE
It's not necessarily a flop depending on their goals. It's been a while since we could say where the threshold for sales is considered successful or not. Considering that this series is ending soon in the next volume, the goal of this anime could easily have been to promote sales of the manga. The anime itself was produced in advance and has had many successful (from what I understand) voice actor events.

Chihayafuru is a very similar Josei series that had low disc sales but resulted in greater manga sales and general series popularity.

Shinsekai Yori

**[Saikano.](http://myanimelist.net/anime/529/Saishuu_Heiki_Kanojo)**

It starts as a happy high school story between super shy and sweet girl and the average guy being in a relationship for the first time.

Ends with [Saikano ending BIG spoilers](/s "Humanity being annihilated by the super shy and sweet girl (dying in the process) and the main guy arguably going mad after realizing he is the last person on the planet.")

It escalated quickly.
>> ARTICLE
Oh please tell me more, I'm so interested in the plot
>> ARTICLE
I'll try to do a basic summary of the first episodes with the smallest amount of spoilers possible:

[Saikano](/s "Everything starts like the average shoujo manga. Super shy and sweet highschool girl is finally able to get in a relationship with a guy of her class she likes thanks to her friends. Everything is rose-colored for a very brief moment. Their first kiss, first holding hands, etc.  But war breaks out between the country where the characters live (most likely japan) and a foreign country. One day while shy and sweet girl goes home after school she is abducted by the government in secret and 'transformed' with experiments into -the ultimate weapon- against her will. A weapon that can completely destroy an entire army in seconds, moving at an speed that cannot be matched. She is not normal anymore (even if she looks the same), doesn't control her new abilities completely, suffers from the pain of the 'injures' her transformation involved and she often doubts her own humanity after going through that. She is being monitored by the government that created her (and is requested by the army to help with the war), but is also allowed to continue her normal school life with her boyfriend. However, that school life won't last much longer, with her city being constantly bombarded, classmates dying in the attacks and the country close to its destruction.")

Im leaving some **important details** out because they are spoilers.

&nbsp;

This show is the very definition of depression. 

It was considered *"one of the most depressing anime that exists"* some years ago.

There is nothing happy about it after the first half of episode 1.

>> ARTICLE

u wot m8?
>> ARTICLE
>u wot m8?

Not being a dick but you didn't get the ending I guess.

In the End of Evangelion, the Third Impact occurs, Instrumentality starts, Shinji realises he can exist happily in the world as his own person, rather than everyone existing as one being inside intrumentality.

Shinji then rejects instrumentality and everyone was turned into LCL comes back to Earth, the end with Asuka and Shinji on the beach may seem like a bad thing, but it's not, Shinji chokes Asuka to make sure she's real and that he's back from Instrumentality, then cries of relief.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I got that, but I don't really see it as a 'happy' ending. The Earth is still fucked (now even more because of third impact), Rei is gone, his dad probably still hates him, Asuka probably hates him even more (for choking her), and who knows if Misato is alive (it is implied, but you don't know if it's true). I'm just saying that imo the ending is happier than everything going downhill before the end, but it isn't really happier than the beginning of NGE (except that Shinji has some friends, but that's all).
>> ARTICLE
Gendo never hated Shinji, he just didn't know how to talk to him or show affectionto him, we know this because before Gendo dies in EoE he apologizes to Shinji and says it was better when he never did anything.

Asuka shows Shinji affection by caressing his cheek when he chokes her, she definitely doesn't hate him, and there's even a scene during intstrumentality that implies they had sex.

The Earth in it's entirety isn't fucked, and the land isn't dead, since Shinji rejected instrumentality, the earths life force was sent back along with the people.
>> ARTICLE
I think the scene you are talking about is where Shinji sees the affair between Kaji and Misato, though I may be wrong. The land already was dead from second impact. There is no more sealife, a lot of the land has been flooded, and the Earth's population decreased tremendously. Like I said, the ending isn't unhappy, it's just not happy enough that I would call it a happy note personally. Then again, it's *my* opinion. I might just have a pessimistic view on things.
>> ARTICLE
The Earths population only decreased until the people find their own self within their mind, so a lot of the could come back.

Also, [this] (https://gyazo.com/19b02964f0eaf166a7e6cb4ad05b72a9) was the scene I was talking about.
>> ARTICLE
I dunno; while the first few episodes were lighter, I wouldn't exactly describe it as... happy, I guess? And the most happy and fun episodes of NGE are really a third of the way in when Asuka barges in, so I wouldn't say the mood just kept going downhill from there.

I didn't even know of this show before the season started, I just saw the discussion thread pop up on reddit and decided to give it a try and now I love it. It's probably gonna be one of my favorites this season.

I also like how people are saying that each girl is competing to be worst girl which is true and hilarious.

Well, then they drop Reikenzan on us, so it still may be a bit too soon to speak.

Higurashi is good because the VN is great. DEEN did butcher the story somewhat and the animation is horrid, so DEEN actually made the anime worse than it should be.

>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't catalogue Grimgar as a great surprise yet. I rarely say this to an anime, but I found it incredibly slow. If they keep this up, Grimgar could be the disappointment of the season. The music scene in episode 2 made me sick.


>> ARTICLE
The pacing isn't for everyone , but that slow pacing actually seemed important to character portrayal 

I don't want them to speed it up at all
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you that the pace of the series is not bad, but last episode felt really slow with the music filling. I don't want the pace to be much faster because I don't mind slower paces, but in my opinion it wouldn't hurt the show if they speeded up the pace just a bit before shit gets real.

To give you an example, a similar pace to Gakkou Gurashi! wouldn't hurt the series.
>> ARTICLE
Depends on how they speed it up. At the current pacing it actually adds I would say to the feel of the story, makes it more 'day to day life'

I wouldn't be upset at a faster pace, as long as it doesn't feel rushed, or skipping over things. 
>> ARTICLE
So you're enjoying all the shorts
>> ARTICLE
> Osomatsu-san

I just looked at the cover and I don't really like how it looks at all, is it decent?
>> ARTICLE
I initially skipped this because it looked stupid but I decided to check it out after seeing people talk about it. It's actually funny but you will probably either like or hate the humor. Just watch the first episode and you'll know if it's for you. 
>> ARTICLE
It's absolutely hilarious. One of the best comedy anime I've seen and the art style sometimes changes into a different one but most of the time it's like the cover. I recommend you to at least watch the first 3 episodes and see if you like the comedy in it. I don't think that you can watch the first episode legally though because I think they got sued (?) for it.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm alright, thanks for an in-sight!
>> ARTICLE
I know Lupin III has a huge history, do I need to watch anything else to get into it? What should I expect?
>> ARTICLE
It's standalone from the other shows in the series so you could just jump in. It's pretty easy picking up on the main characters from the first episode I think. 
>> ARTICLE
Lupin III is episodic, so there's not really anything required. I'd at least watch the [1971 series](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1412/Lupin_III?q=lupin%20III) to understand some of the characters and then go from there. 

The [1977 series](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1425/Lupin_III__Part_II) is rather long, but still episodic. About 80 of these episodes are dubbed in English.

There's a bunch of movies, but [Castle of Cagliostro](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1430/Lupin_III__Cagliostro_no_Shiro) the best. It's also Hayao Miyazaki's directorial debut. 

Recently, there was an "alternate universe" Lupin series [A Woman Called Fujiko Mine](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13203/Lupin_the_Third__Mine_Fujiko_to_Iu_Onna), which is darker, but also somewhat closer to the original series.
>> ARTICLE
A Woman Called Fujiko Mine was a masterpiece to me, loved that animation style, and the overall mystery was intriguing.
>> ARTICLE
This sounds pretty awesome I'll have to check it out. Thank you!!
>> ARTICLE
It's weird to see other people mentioning Lupin III. It's a solid show, but rarely anyone is watching. It's a show that should be popular with Western audiences (well, at least US audiences) but isn't.

Hopefully the dub will come out soon enough and Adult Swim will pick it up.
>> ARTICLE
I think part of the problem is the intermittent airing schedule. Is it bi-weekly now or what? I would rather just wait for most of the show to finish. 
>> ARTICLE
Pretty sure it's supposed to be weekly now since it got picked up by CR like two weeks ago. 
>> ARTICLE
Showa Genroku is best of season for me. I can't believe how captivated i am with subject matter that i've never even heard of before.

Boku Dake is phenomenal. The main character is unique,  the directing is solid and the pacing is on point.

Prince of Stride is good. Not great. Just good. It has a little bit too much of the Free feeling and not enough of the Haikyuu feeling.

Dagashi Kashi is hilarious. Absolutely love how it can combine the humor and the relaxing setting. Reminds me slightly of Non Non Biyori in that regard.

Dimension W is my kind of series. Pure, unadulterated badassery, mixed with cool Sci Fi world building and a little dash of the rule of cool.

Grimgars first episode didn't impress me, other than the visuals of course. However the second episode showed me the true potential of this series. It incorporates realistic character interactions, realistic world building, grueling life and death fights and fluid tonal shifts in such a gratifying way.


>> ARTICLE
> Showa Genroku is best of season for me. I can't believe how captivated i am with subject matter that i've never even heard of before.

Personally I had heard of Rakugo before, but there's a reason it gets compared to Chihayafuru a lot.
>> ARTICLE
>Did fucking DEEN produce a good show

HOLY SHIT DID THEY! The first episode was fantastic. The rakugo performance was entrancing, and had me in stitches. Tomokazu Seki's work as Yotaru is some of the best voice acting I've ever heard.

Ep 2 didn't disappoint either. 

This show is cruising to an easy AOTS if it keeps this up, I'll tell you hwhat. 
>> ARTICLE
For all of you shrugging off Tabi Machi Late Show because of the slideshow animation: it is intentional; it is amazing, and you are missing out.

Best show of the season thus far. So sad it's only going to be 30 minutes long.

Aside from that, KonoSuba is surprisingly funny. And that's Deen as well, I believe. Is this the season of their comeback?
>> ARTICLE
Tabi Machi is one of the shows I'm saving for later. Gotta drop a few shows to make room for others first (I'm looking at you, Haruchika)

It's absolutely ridiculous. All these DEEN staff members who have been around for ages are finally returning to the spotlight. No idea why they spent so many years outsourcing when they had talent like Kanasaki and Hatakeyama on the bench when they had proven resumes.
>> ARTICLE
> No idea why they spent so many years outsourcing

Money or time schedules. Probably money.
>> ARTICLE
Most likely both.
>> ARTICLE
In two episodes alone Boku Dake is everything I've ever wanted from an anime, I'm gonna call it as AOTS already.

Rakugo is fucking great, but I kind of need a specific atmosphere to watch it. I don't really want to watch it unless it's night and I'm super relaxed. It's up there with Boku Dake

Dimension W is just pure fun and it jumped right into the plot, there's no way I'd drop this show. It's a steady third place.

Sekkou Boys lived up to the hype

Prince of Stride has some really cool animation at times, and as odd as it sounds it really makes the characters seem unhumanly fast.

Gate had a fucking brutal second episode. I liked that one episode more than all of Season 1 combined.

Dagashi Kashi is pure fun, Saya best girl, Pain second best girl.

Durarara is starting to lose me after having a ridiculously large cast that I just don't care about, but it's got a cool OP.

Ajin has some pretty gross animation, definitely worse than Sidonia's. I'm enjoying it enough to watch episode two though.

I'm not caught up with any other shows, so I'm not going to talk about their first episodes. Should I watch Musaigen or KonoSuba?
>> ARTICLE
Watch Musaigen not for an amazing story or deep character backgrounds, but just to have fun.
>> ARTICLE
If you're watching an anime to 'have fun' don't watch Musaigen.  Watch something thats actually excels at the 'silly but fun' concept like Symphogear, Punchline, No Game No Life, etc. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm thinking I need to watch KonoSuba as well, but I can chime in on Musaigen.

It's stupid and trite, and I'm having a blast with it. It's cracked me up more than once. KyoAni does what KyoAni do, and applies their fantastic direction in all aspects and makes an otherwise boring show quite a treat to watch. 


>> ARTICLE
I can't recommend you on KonoSuba since I'm not watching it, but I can recommend you on Musaigen.

And I recommend that you stay far, far away from it. 

Someone here said it was "stupid and trite", and I would say that they really aren't far off.  Other than the KyoAni-level art, there's not a single reason to bother watching Musaigen.  The first two episodes, when they weren't forcing a cringe due to precisely how bad it was, were dreadfully boring otherwise.  I see some people saying 'watch it because its fun', but I'd say if you were going to do that there's a lot of better anime that do the 'silly but fun' concept but are actually, well...not awful.
>> ARTICLE
I can definitely recommend KonoSuba, but I dropped Musaigen a bit into the second episode. Couldn't stand the comedy.

KonoSuba seems to have a somewhat snarky/trollish MC, if you're into that.

Erased, Dimension W, Shouwa Genroku & Grimgar

Top 4 of the season for me, ones I look forward to the most each week. 
>> ARTICLE
Top 3 so far:

1. **Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya mo Mezasu**

2. **Boku dake ga Inai Machi** 

3. **Dimension W**

My favorite show of the season is **Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya mo Mezasu**. Really liking the plot and the characters so far. 

Other stuff I'm watching are: 

**Ajin** - really interesting plot, but the animation is really holding me back from enjoying it. I'll probably bear with it for a while and see if I'll get used to it.

**Boku dake ga Inai Machi** - one of the best of the season for sure. Great visuals and cinematography and the characters seem really likeable.

**Dagashi Kashi** - might not really be for everyone, but I am enjoying it a lot. A very lighthearted series, and also the conversations and interactions between the characters are funny most of the time. The facts about the candies are also interesting. 

**Dimension W** - The 2nd episode really made me interested in it compared to the 1st episode, hoping it only gets better from there.

**Hai to Gensou no Grimgar** - same as Dimension W, 1st episode didn't really make me interested that much, but the 2nd episode brought it really high up. Heard it gets better and darker so I have really high hopes for it.

**Musaigen no Phantom World** - I really like it so far, it is entertaining and the characters are really fun and likeable. 

Leftover :

**Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen** - Moved on from our slow SoL start to the action packed stuff. It's getting really exciting, hope to see more of the characters from the first season.

Great season so far! I'm enjoying all of the shows I'm watching. I hope none of them fall of in the end.

> Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya mo Mezasu

Does this get any better after the first episode? Really didn't do anything to grab my attention, found it a bit uninteresting.

>> ARTICLE
Not really, but Romeo is the writer so it might get better soon.
>> ARTICLE
These are the shows I'm interested and my personal initial impressions. Since I'm sampling 30-50 shows a season, I have to be critical or else I'm going to end up watching anime all day. Obviously we'll have to see if shows improve or drop off as the season continues.

Top shows

* **Boku Dake ga Inai Machi** - Very solid premise and engaging story so far. The first episode was strong and the second one managed to follow it up well. The directing is pretty good. It shows a lot of promise.
* **Dimension W** - The very stylistic directing immediately caught my eye. The premise was strong enough to keep me interested in the first episode. The second episode gave us more information that fuels the mystery behind the plot but I didn't have the same level of enthusiasm as I did with the first episode. It seems to be building up for something big but so far we're in the dark. Hopefully this show has the substance to match its style in the long run.
* **Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!** - This show was a complete surprise with its slapstick, meta and satirical comedy. I can't remember the last time I've seen a show that made me laugh this much, but obviously, humor depends a lot on the viewer's preferences. The second episode was just as good as the last one and if the show keeps it up, it's probably going to be one of my all time favorites. In fact, I watched each episode twice already.
* **Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** - What a unique show. It has strong characters with amazing voice acting and focuses on rakugo. I didn't even know that the first episode was an hour long. That's how engaged I was. The performances were in both episodes were done really well. It's a fantastic start to a mature and realistic, character driven show like this one.

Top Shorts

* **Ojisan to Marshmallow** - This show is so charming. It has some really great comedy and a unique character dynamic that makes me chuckle. In many ways, it resembles Ore Monogatari. However this show, being a short, is quicker to the punch and boils it down to a succinct story that doesn't feel saccharine like Ore Monogatari did after the first few episodes.
* **Oshiete! Galko-chan** - I don't really have any excuses for enjoying this show. I just like really like Galko-chan's character design and the racy/raunchy humor is okay enough for me to keep watching.

Shows I'm on the fence about

* **Hai to Gensou no Grimgar** - Like many other people has stated, the background art is great. It's a trapped in a RPG like world clone but it does bring up some really interesting themes that other similar shows haven't. This and the art really carry the show. However the basic trapped in a adventure world formula is still there, making it feel like recycled content and world building. The dialogue was also very dry. The second episode committed the Madoka Magica sin of putting its characters in extreme situations before viewers can develop an attachment to the characters so it felt like it was more going for shock value rather than drawing empathy. This is probably the show I'm most on the fence about.
* **Koukaku no Pandora** - Not sure why I enjoy this show. It's probably the yuri. Yeah It's definitely the yuri. On the other hand, the story seems like it's all over the place.
* **Musaigen no Phantom World** - I like KyoAni shows. Amagi Brilliant Park is one of my favorite shows. They don't have the strongest writing but they have their own charm and type of humor. But I think this is one of their weaker shows along with Kyoukai no Kanata and Chuunibyou 2. The lighthearted atmosphere and colorful art might be enough to carry the show but, unless I'm bored or the show kicks it up a notch, I can't see myself watching past episode 3.

Shorts I'm on the fence about

* **Nijiro Days** - From the looks of it, it seems like a shojou drama show. The first episode was cliche but still interesting for me. Because of its short format, I have reservations. I'm not sure how the writers are going to develop the story and flesh out its characters enough for me to care enough about them. I'll give it till episode 3 to make a decision.
* **Tabi Machi Late Show** - An interesting color painted art style with short stories about small events that happen in life. The first episode was weak for me while I enjoyed the second one. The show sort of reminds me of the *Chicken Soup for the Soul* books.
* **Mahou Shoujo Nante Mou Ii Desukara** - A magical girl show that tries its hand at the meta comedy trend. I like the main character's voice acting but the show doesn't feel like it brings anything new. It's a short so I'll probably end up watching the rest of it but if this was a full length, I would probably drop it.

Shows from last season

* **Utawarerumono - Itsuwari no Kamen** - The first cour was a SUPER slow slice of life. Having seen the original Utawarerumono, I'm still waiting to see where the story goes (we finally get to see some mask action). Regardless of the super slow first half the lovely art, character design and world still keep me coming back each week. The plot is still weaker than its predecessor but it's a enjoyable watch.
* **Haikyuu!!2** - Not much to say. The hype is still going strong. However for me, its a little hard to sit through all these matches with these weaker teams when they already introduced so many strong opponents that they have yet to play.

Sequels that are on hold and will be marathoned

* **Akagami no Shirayukihime S2** - Another charming show that seemed a little slow after a while. A big problem is that the week wait for each episode kills the momentum of a show that isn't dependent on hype. I'll watch it when all of the episodes are out.
* **Durarara!! X2** - Trying to watch Durarara airing is a bit of a mess for me. It can be fun but it can feel very disjointed. I'll watch the whole thing at once so I can get the better picture of the intertwining story lines without having to wait each week.
* **GATE** - I liked the manga but the anime imo isn't a very good adaptation. A major issue I have with it is that it lost a lot its dark and edgy atmosphere from the manga. The show decided to go much brighter and focused more on its comedy and moe/harem elements. It feels like a watered down version of the original. The show is still enjoyable but I'll hold off on it for now.
* **Kidou Senshi Gundam - Tekkutsu no Orphans** - I couldn't really get into the show last season while it was airing. A few weeks ago I watched the rest of it, up to episode 12, and I enjoyed more than I first did when watching it weekly.

Shows I am catching up on

* **Lupin III 2015** - Watched episode 1&2 so far from last season. Man I loved the old Lupin when I was younger (reruns) and the new anime keeps its spirit very much alive.

Dropped/Save for a Rainy Day

* **Active Raid** - Meh, seems like a kids show.
* **Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm** - As a lover of the Air Gear manga way back in the day, I really wanted to like this show. Flying shoes, awesome! But it wasn't meant to be.
* **Assassination Classroom S2** - Watched the first season and I liked it but after seeing the first two episodes of the new season, I think it's just going to be more of the same and I think I've had my fill already.
* **Bubuki Buranki** - The show is probably suited for a younger audience. The CG wasn't as bad as I expected it to be but like Sidonia it is terrible at reproducing facial expressions that were obviously designed for the 2D medium.
* **Dagashi Kashi** - I feel like this show had a lot of hype on /r/anime going into the season but I'm just not getting it.
* **Divine Gate** - Doesn't feel like it has much going for it.
* **Haruchika** - Euphonium + Hyouka? I thought it would be good but the execution is meh.
* **Luck & Logic** - Not much else to say other than I really like Athena's character design. 
* **Norn9 - Norn+Nonet** - A mysterious world with not much explanation. It's kind of hard to judge with just two episodes but the writing doesn't seem impressive.
* **Nurse Witch Komugi-chan R** - Kids show?
* **Ooyasan wa Shishunki!** - From what I've seen its a generic short about a harem apartment complex.
* **Phantasy Star Online 2 The Animation** - Bad Anime Ad for Phantasy Star
* **Prince of Stride - Alternative** - The first episode's race was pretty awesome to look at but I don't think that alone can carry the show.
* **Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut** - Haven't I watched this before?
* **Schwarzesmarken** - Dark and edgy with no hint of subtly or atmosphere.
* **Sekkou Boys** - Sort of funny but not enough for me to invest time into.
* **Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu** - Poor man's Seakano?
* **Yami Shibai - Japanese Ghost Stories 3** - Short scary stories. Interesting but I think I'll pass. I really dig the ED though.

>> ARTICLE
> Assassination Classroom S2

When it's later in the season, give it a second chance. As a manga reader, believe me, it will ramp up and wont exactly be "more of the same" 


>> ARTICLE
As another manga reader I can vouch for that.
>> ARTICLE
This season so far has been pretty great. 

I was wary about *Myriad Colors* but KyoAni is managing to entertain me, the little things that bother me can easily be ignored. *ERASED* was simply **amazing**.

*Active Raid* and *Konosuba* surprised me, I expected nothing and a generic harem, respectibely, and both destroyed my assumptions. Active Raid was enjoyable and Konosuba turned out to be a great comedy.

The only bad thing that I have to say about Winter is *Haruchika*, I am really disappointed by how terrible this turned out to be, unless episode 4 changes it, I'll probably drop.

I'll also drop *Oshiete! Galko-chan* and *Shwarzesmaken* not because they're bad, just because I don't really care enough to watch the new episodes.
>> ARTICLE
Come on, please give Oshiete one more chance. It's only 7 minutes anyway.
>> ARTICLE
I watched the new episode today but to be honest is just matter of time till I forget about it and end up not watching anymore, it makes me smile but it's not really compelling.
>> ARTICLE
Okay, I guess it's not for everyone.

>"I fucking love this show" tier

Koukaku no Pandora--It's cheesy and silly and soooo 90s, but it's also pretty fucking great and goddamn the yuri cyborgs are getting to me.

Durarara!! x2 Ketsu--It's Durarara, except now [Takano Miyo v2](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/durarara/images/8/85/Kasane_1.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20150830115749) has joined the cast, so like I can't help but love it anymore. [She's already made it into my top 9 girls.](http://i.imgur.com/3W5xo8R.jpg)

>"It's enjoyable and I look forward to it each week" tier

Dimension W--It's juust deep enough to be able to hold some thematic depth, but it's also stylish and a good thriller so far. 

Kono Subarashi--It's fun and, well, it's light humor. I appreciate that. Just engaging enough to be engaging, but it isn't really trying to do much which is fine.

Shoujo-Tachi--Romeo is a good author. A really cool mix of a few genres that's actually coming out entertaining and sort-of insightful, the meta elements aren't intrusive but actually neat. Have I mentioned Romeo is a really good, down to earth writer.

>"I like it but it's not something I look forward to" tier

Boku Dake ga Inai Machi--Blasphemous, I know. Especially weird because I love mysteries, but it's just not engaging me much at the moment. It's quality is obvious, though.

Utawarerumono--Yup, this is an SRPG VN adaptation alright.

Active Raid--I really hope they use the setting well once we're past all this. It has lots of potential that's currently unused.

>"It exists" tier

Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu--This show is objectively the best show this season probably, and that's fine. I just sort of...zone out during the non-Rakugo segments though. It makes me want to watch some actual Rakugo, tbh.

Akagami Shirayuke--It sure does fill my token-required shoujo fantasy...Man, I wish this show had conflict sometime.

Norn9--I really hope this goes somewhere, because there is just enough intrigue at the moment and some of the characters(Rei clone specifically) are endearing to me to keep watching...

Prince of Stride--Actually engagingish, the production values are top-notch.

>"I really don't like dropping shows" tier

HaruChika--Fetishized High School dramady. It's quality is decent, but goddamn these types of shows are the anime equivalent of Oscar Bait and this is one of the baitiest with an almost--irreprehensible protagonist.

Luck & Logic--All things considered, this is trash, but at least it's fun. YOU LISTENING HARUCHIKA
>> ARTICLE
There's a guy I was lucky enough to see who does rakugo in english. He's from Canada, but he apprenticed to a rakugo master in Japan.

He's got a website with some clips. http://katsurasunshine.com/video/ It's pretty damn funny stuff.
>> ARTICLE
> Romeo is a good author

Who is Romeo? The male lead character?
>> ARTICLE
Romeo Tanaka, the author of the show. He's also the primary writer of *Rewrite* and a few other VN projects. Largely considered to be one of the "Greats" of the VN scene(I have him second to Ryukishi, though).
>> ARTICLE
Wow, MAL didn't list Kouya o Mezasu as VN adaptation, I checked MAL before asking you.

VN adaptation huh...? I think I might check the anime out after all! Thanks.
>> ARTICLE
It's not a VN adaptation. It's original, but Romeo is co-writing it with Takahiro (Akame ga kill, and Yuuki Yuuna).

I'm not expecting much from it, but Jinrui was fun and Yuuki Yuuna was amazing so it might be good.
>> ARTICLE
> Romeo is co-writing it with Takahiro (Akame ga kill, and Yuuki Yuuna).

Takahiro said Romeo is only one touched the text. it is also a VN adaptation just the VN isnt released yet.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, so it's just like with Punchline. First anime and then briefly after visual novel that was all along the original thing.
>> ARTICLE
But there is [this here](https://vndb.org/v14303). It says the trial edition has been out for 3 months.
>> ARTICLE
Ah, it's under 'more staff' on MAL. 'Tanaka Romeo' Original Creator. I see. Well if it's original work, I'm going to wait until ~eps. 6 before checking them out.

Thanks for getting back to me!
>> ARTICLE
Erased came out strong and has yet to make any sort of error. Easily AOTS. 

Rakugo is fantastic and its only downfall is being in the same season as Erased

I don't seem to be enjoying Dimension W as much as everyone else. None of the characters leap out at me and the exposition dialogue is kind of clunky. Still a fun show so far though. 

I'm enjoying Bubuki Buranki a lot if just because I'm a sucker for the animation. The story is also very original and legitimately intriguing. 

Prince of Stride remains both fun and funny. Wish more people would give this a chance. 

Haikyuu and Gintama are still going strong as always

Osumatsu-san and Lupin are coasting. Not giving me any reason to drop but not wowing me either. 

Best OP: Re:Re of course is an amazing song and Erased set to awesome visuals but I think the [Prince of Stride OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV1RHNzHxAs) should get a mention at least. It's catchy as hell. 
>> ARTICLE
Shouwa is leagues above all the animes in season, even Boku Dake ga Inai Machi, which I felt was a bit too rushed in tempo but managed to pull off their most important plotlines. Behind them is Dimension W and the leftovers of Autumn's season (Gundam IBO, Haikyuu!!).

The surprise for me it's evidently GATE. I thought it would be a series that couldn't be taken seriously, but damn, those two first episodes really baked the cake.

And for me the disappointment could be Grimgar. If they keep playing that tempo they will surely trash their idea, which is quite frustrating.

Cool, I was hoping that a thread like this would appear. Mine's gonna be pretty long, but I like putting effort into stuff like this. *Lets Jam!*

Gonna divide it into shows that I'm still watching, and shows that I dropped.

**Still Watching**

[Boku dake ga Inai Machi](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/purplepinapples) - So far, This show is close to getting anime of the season, but I have to save that for Rakugo. I can't say much bad about this (though if I had to, check [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/40yl06/spoilers_boku_dake_ga_inai_machi_episode_2/cyyd3fi)). I enjoy the narrative style, the story so far, the plot twists are great, and the [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-W03G0nnls) is my favorite so far.

[Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28735/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu) - This is a genuinely amazing show, easily my favorite of the season so far.

The characters are so unique, and the way they talk to each other and interact is so intriguing. I could listen to them talk for hours.

Second, the director/direction of this show is insane. It managed to keep me interested for about 10 minutes by just having a person talking. And its not like the visuals were portrayed in an imaginary way, we just saw a man sitting down telling a story for 10 minutes. Yet, it captivated me in an amazing way. Whether it be the acting, the animation, the scene changes, the slideshow-esque animation, I was amazed.
I enjoy the shoujo inspired art style a lot too. Not only does it add to this realistic Josei styled show, I really enjoyed the colors overall. They were really calming for a calming show.

The decision to make this a 47 minute first episode was also a great one. I was skeptical at first, but after seeing the story this way, I couldn't imagine it any other way. After watching that, a viewer would instantly be able to tell if they would like the show or not. It did a really good job of being a first episode, laying out what the show is.

[Second Season of Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31637/Gate__Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakaeri_2nd_Season) - Its gate, its cool. Its not amazing (though that moment in episode 2 - *damn*, kurabayashi is a badass), but its entertaining in its own way. I enjoy it, and I will continue to watch it, but it doesn't get my AOTS (against Rakugo) by far. 

**Dropped**

I'm not gonna bother explaining why I dropped these ones, unless someone wants me to, so if you want to know, ask. :)

Dagashi Kashi, Divine Gate, HaruChika, Luck & Logic, Oojisan and Marshmallow, Ooyasan wa Shishunki!, Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut, Sushi Police, Sekkou Boys

[Dimension W](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31163/Dimension_W) - I don't really know why I dropped this one. Its not like I hate it, I just don't really like it either. If I hear good things about it later, I might pick it back up later, but it just doesn't seem like my type of thing. I don't really like the overall tone and presentation of the show.

[Hai to Gensou no Grimgar](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31859/Hai_to_Gensou_no_Grimgar) - Oh. My. God. What a let down. I was actually pretty exited for this one. I liked the artstyle from what I had seen, and I'm not completely fed up with the *stuck in a video game* genre yet, so I thought I'd give it ago. This show is trying to be different by subverting these *video game* tropes, by making it seem like a big deal, but then it goes off and does exposition for 10 minutes. It tries to create this strange unsettling tone, but imo, it doesn't really do it that well. Heck, this show fails to use dialogue. What are they talking about? It isn't really important at all. Sure, it sets the scene a bit, but what about the characters? They're just like blank slates, its been a whole episode and we don't know anything about them.

[Musaigen no Phantom World](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31442/Musaigen_no_Phantom_World) - Sigh. I don't even know what to say. Its not like I don't like fan service, its just this show is nothing but that. If it didn't have the fan service, It would be pretty boring, would it not? I wanted to watch it, mostly because of the popularity, but I, no lie, fell asleep watching the third episode. If thats not a reason enough to drop it, I don't know what is. Also, albeit the fan service, its a pretty generic show. I'm kinda tired with the high school club setting, and it doesn't really present anything else that piques my interest, so - yeah.

[Prince of Stride: Alternative](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31559/Prince_of_Stride__Alternative) - I watched this, simply based on the fact that it was MADHOUSE. Hm. It seems - normal. I will admit that I really liked the end of the first episode, that race scene was pretty damn slick, well animated, and worth the wait. But thats about it. The other antics in the first episode was all pretty boring, and after watching the second episode, it didn't really keep me interested (also, wtf is up with the character development in between episodes, they're just like, suddenly friends and practicing). It was cool for an episode, but it doesn't seem like the type of show that I'd finish

*Annnd thats it!*, Thanks for reading if you did.
>> ARTICLE
So far Erased is the best for me storywise and OP wise. 
>> ARTICLE
Musaigen no phantom world: Fun, solid, great animation and cool op, kyoani fanservice, enjoyable characters, good show. 

Grimgar: Beutiful visuals, very good ost, dark-ish and melancholic feeling, not OP characters, curious to see where this goes.

Haruchika: Funny, awesome eyes, haruta is a bit of a piece of shit and this makes his character a bit different than usual, cute chibis, good ost, as a flautist having a flute player protagonist is kinda nice. I wanna see where it goes with the mistery thing, and if it will continue having the episodic approach of recruiting a new member for the brass band each episode.

Konosuba: Still haven't started watching it, should i? From what the community says seems interesting.
>> ARTICLE
Konosuba is top tier if you like comedy and meta-humor.

Much better than I expected:

 * Oshiete! Gyaruko-chan

 * Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu

Better than I expected:

* Prince of Stride: Alternative

* Sekkou Boys

About as good as I expected:

* Ojisan to Marshmallow

* Dagashi Kashi

Gotta say, I'm really glad I pushed myself to follow a lot of shows this season. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you checked out Boku Dake? 
>> ARTICLE
It really doesn't seem like something I'd like.
>> ARTICLE
If you happen to have a half hour lying Around, check out the first episode, it's honestly the first anime to keep me on the edge of my seat in a while. 
>> ARTICLE
So far I've only watched ERASED, Durarara, and Shirayuki (though only the first episode); ERASED is definitely my show of the season so far. I'll have to pick up Shouwa, it sounds great.
>> ARTICLE
It's interesting to see the amount of backlash that *Myriad Colors* is getting. I found it incredibly solid. Then again so far I've seen *Schwarzesmarken* and *Grimgar*. The fanservice bits don't compare to anything in *Shimoneta* and *Prison School*, but those shows were intended to very sexually crude anyway. It seems a bit disingenuous that shows can get away with sexual humour because 'that's the intention', while a show like *Myriad Colors* is criticized for it because 'it should be something else/more'. 
>> ARTICLE
OP of the season- tie b/w Re:re by Asian kung-fu generation and that dance of dimension W
ED of the season- Dagashi kashi, bokumachi
Probable AOTS- Shouwa, ERASED.
>> ARTICLE
Overall I think this year has the potential to be the best year anime fans have had in a WHILE, From Ajin to Erased, and later this year the return of Attack on Titan and BOKU NO HERO BABY (hopefully the studio working on it wont fuck it up)

>Top 3

- **Dimension W**: DnB Vibes, interesting Character Dynamics and Setting  

- **Boku Dake ga Inai Machi| ERASED**: The first Episode captivated me so much, I knew it was gonna be awesome!

- **Active Raid**: Kinda like Powerrangers, pretty entertaining.

>Anime that are simply "ok"

- **Dagashi Kashi**:Sweets-SoL with some pretty eccentric Characters thats good every now and then for a chuckle, but thats about it

- **Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu**: This One didnt really click with me, but thats probably because I wasnt yet able to watch it in the right Atmosphere, so itll take a Backseat for now.

>Anime Im still on the Fence if I should continue it

- **Ajin**: I already did read the first Volume of the Manga since a local Publisher translated it, so I dunno if I should continue

> Weird, but somewhat entertaining

- **Sekkou Boys**: Nuff said.

>Disappointment of the Season

- **Haruchika**: My Glasslip-PTSD kicked right in that first Episode, so I decided to abbadon the Ship.

>Best OP

[Dimension W](http://b.1339.cf/ewkfwbm.webm), with [Musaigen Phantom World](https://my.mixtape.moe/ewacqj.webm) as a Runner up.
>> ARTICLE
Praise Deen! ERASED and Deen's show are cool, the rest is average or below. Can't wait for Spring...
>> ARTICLE
Before the season started I was most interested in Haruchika, ERASED, Dagashi Kashi and Musaigen no Phantom World out of these the only really good one anime is ofcourse ERASED. 

I thought Haruchika sounded like a sweet romance story with some mystery to it, kind of like Hyouka but instead it turned out to be a battle of who will be the creepiest/most fucked up couple at the end and the mysteries are absolute bollocks. The biggest mystery of the entire series are why is Haru such a bellend and why is Chika after a 27 year old teacher? Infact, why are they both after the teacher? It's trying to present it like some sweet love story but it's creepy, the only positive I can pull from this show is Chika is a 10/10 character. 
>> ARTICLE
Top 5 so far this season are

* Dimension W

* Bokumachi

* Kono Suba

* Dagashi Kashi

* Grimgar
>> ARTICLE
There were a lot of overhyped shows
>> ARTICLE
Surprised that they didn't suck:

Grimgar - went in with super low expectations and was pleasantly surprised with it, definitely my favourite of the season so far.

ERASED - premise sounded stupid but a manga reader convinced me to give it a try, it's up there as one of the best this season but I'm not really feeling it as much as everyone else.

Disappointed in:

HaruChika - I really thought that this could be my favourite of the season but the first episode quickly dispelled that thought. Looks like it was going to head in a weird direction that I don't want to be a part of so I dropped it :(

Misc thoughts:

Rakugo - I'm enjoying what I've seen of this so far. The more comedic performances have been great and it's always nice to watch Josei series since they tend to be really different and refreshing.

Dimension W - not really a fan of this tbh, although that may just be my dislike of the dance in the OP. I guess it doesn't help that I don't like Darker than Black

Akagami S2 - Shirayuki is still so fucking cute \^___\^

It's definitely a better season than Summer and Fall 2015. Even if one of the leading series flop, there's many other solid pretenders to the AOTS title.

* **Erased** (Boku dake) is the one most likely to remain in people's memory after the season ends
* **Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** isn't just a must-watch for all josei fans - it's for anyone willing to put up with a slower pace than usual
* **Grimgar** seems to deconstruct the whole "spirited away to a DnD world" premise. Something I haven't seen since Twelve Kingdoms (which didn't cover for the game-like class system).
* **Shukufuku** (KonoSuba) is wacky and lighthearted enough to give it a pass despite the obvious cliche setting. There's something to it I can't pinpoint yet that makes me put it above the likes of DanMachi.
* **Dimension W** is a scifi at its core. Futuristic utopia, evil corporation, androids, Electric Batman v2.0 - there's many ways for this show to flop, but until that happens I'm going to enjoy the ride.

Personally I'm not sold on Phantom World and Sagashi Kashi. To each his own.
>> ARTICLE
- Erased and Dimension W are probably the top 2 non-sequels in my eyes.

- Akagami no Shirayuki S2 and Durarara x2 Ketsu are both delivering in terms of sequels.

- Ojisan to Marshmallow and Sekkou Boys are great, I haven't watched any shorts before but loving these.

- Grimgar and Ajin are the wildcards, interested to see where they go.
>> ARTICLE
ERASED and Dimension W are probably going to be my favorites this season. Schwartzenmarken and Divine Gate aren't bad either. One of the only seasons where I'm not watching a (true) sequel. 

Ninja Edit : Dagashi Kashi is cash. 
>> ARTICLE
I'm usually not a big fan of *A1 Pictures*, but so far I'm really liking BokuMachi and Hai to Gensou no Grimgar isn't half bad.

*KyoAni* does artwork brilliantly, and they are always consistent yet innovative. I'm really enjoying Musaigen no Phantom World, it's one of the most fun I've had in anime.

And the biggest letdown for me is from my favorite studio *PA Works*, with some lackluster artwork, story, and writing in HaruChika. Quite an interesting season, I have to say.
>> ARTICLE
I'm loving Rakugo so far but I am really concerned for its future. As I was watching that incredible first episode, I was looking forward to slow, gradual dramatic reveals about Sukeroku and Yakumo's past. Instead we're getting (at least?) two full episodes of flashback exposition. The backstory is great, it's just that I already really want to get back to the present. I find Yotaro and Konatsu so much more interesting than young Yakumo and Sukeroku. I have faith in the quality of the show so far, but if there are any pacing issues at all near the end, then we'll know what caused them.

ERASED is incredible and that's really all there is to say on the matter. Plug for /r/bokudakegainaimachi.

I really want to like Grimgar, but it just isn't doing it for me. The end of the episode two fight scene was brutal, and I hope that tone becomes more dominant as the show progresses. Right now, its jumping back and forth between visceral realistic grittiness and shitty lighthearted sex humor is really throwing me for a loop.

Dimension W is surprisingly awesome. Kyoma is a badass, Loser is a badass, and that [episode 2](/s ""dimensional collapse"") was horrible in the best way.
>> ARTICLE
Love this season so far. Grimgar and GATE season 2 has to be my favorite so far.

Dimension W surprised me, and me being a car dude, I fucking love the 2000GT.

For funsies, Dagashi Kashi is hilarious. It's a nice break from the other serious tones.
>> ARTICLE
Boku Dake ga Inai Machi- I'll admit when I heard this was getting an adaptation I had my doubts. However fantastic direction and production has made this one of my favorites of this season so far. Story is obviously great as well.

Rakugo- This one is really good. Gives me that Sakamichi vibe. There's a lot of talking but that's what makes this show great. Solid writing with a refreshing setting. Great execution as well which is surprising from Deen.

Durarara- Certainly not as good as the first season but better than the last one. It's okay but it's not leaving me with any strong impressions.

Ajin- I kinda liked the manga. So far the adaptation has not impressed me and the cgi is awful.

KonoSuba- I thought I was going to hate this show. Not that bad. Not super interesting but it's pretty funny.

Active Raid- This one hasn't impressed me. Pretty boring.

Grimgar- Was better than what I expected but I'm still not super impressed. Fun premise, but lame characters.

Prince of Stride- Kinda cool? I'm getting pretty tired of this incessant sports genres with well animated shows with pretty shallow characters. We'll see if the show picks up but I think this'll just be another one of those sports anime.

Dagashi Kashi- Great show. Nice comedy and bringing back nostalgia from childhood. Character designs are unique, VAs are refreshing and the animation is crisp. Not much of a story but I'm okay with that.

Sekkou Boys- This show is pretty stupid. But even so it's enjoyable.

Oshiete Galko Chan- Another refreshing short. Tries to stray from typical hackneyed topics which I like.

Dimension W- Great start to a show that seems pretty fun. I'm really liking the two main characters as well. They're unique and fun.

Musaigen Phantom World- This show is pretty stupid but it's somewhat self-aware. Beautiful animation as always. The premise is actually pretty interesting but the characters are predictable and the plot seems meaningless at the moment. If the story can actually become focused this could be a great show. For now it's a visual spectacle that is some stupid fun.

Overall I'm only very impressed by 3 shows. However there are some fun shows to go along with them. Going into this season I was thinking that it might be the worst season in a while but so far it has been a pleasant surprise. There's nothing that I'm planning on dropping after episode 3 so that's good.

GATE 2nd Season: Right know is looking promising the way is moving the story. 5/10

Akagami no Shirayuki-hime 2nd Season: I found it pretty boring in comparison to 1rst Season. 4/10

Sekkou Boys: The only reason Im watching this is because it has the VA of Gintoki. The comedy is not bad but is not good either. 4/10

Dagashi kashi: Also this one, is boring to me and I dont see anything special with the MC girl. 4/10

Prince of Stride: The races are kinda good, but not the characters. 4/10

Musaigen no Phantom World: It is bad, too fuckin bad. 3/10

Divine Gate: -_- A little overdramatic. 3/10

Dimension W is so based. I just watched the second episode two minutes ago.

I haven't watched Erased or Rakugo yet, but I will soon.
>> ARTICLE
I watched Boku Dake ga Inai Machi after hearing you people talk about it and I was blown back by how good it was. If it keeps up like it has been it will become one of my favorite shows of all time.

Myriad Colors is enjoyable for what it is, I'm enjoying Grimgar, Assassination Classroom S2 is pretty much what I expected, and same goes for Gate S2 (last episode was so satisfying). I plan to watch Konosuba at some point because I'm a sucker for that premise. So far the season has been pretty good and I'm still excited for the rest of the year (Attack on Titan and Shokugeki no Soma Season 2 cannot come soon enough.)
>> ARTICLE
Already dropped a bunch of shows that either weren't interesting at all like Dagashi Kashi, or weren't interesting enough to continue watching for a single cour like Grimgar and Myriad Colors (Dimension W is on hold for the same reason).

I'm honestly surprised that my favorite shows so far are Active Raid and Konosuba. Even though they're not necessarily compelling, they're both just really  fun to watch. Granted, I've only seen their first respective episodes, but they both have great starts.

Only other shows I'm watching are ERASED and Rakugo. Not as hyped about these as everyone else seems to be, but they both definitely have potential.
>> ARTICLE
Excited for Durarara and Haikyuu.

Grimgar is good, but I am not ultra pumped, so I will probably end up dropping it.

I really need to watch that Sekkou Boys show.
>> ARTICLE
I'm getting a feeling that dagashi kashi is going to be reeeeeally slow. 2 episodes in and I feel like I've hardly had an intro. 
>> ARTICLE
Sooo... gonna leave out stuff continuing from last season for now.:  
**My top 5 so far (in order)**: Erased, Rakugo Shinjuu, Dimension W, Konosuba, GATE Fire Dragon  
**Worth Watching (so far)**: Dagashi Kashi, Active Raid, Musaigen, Aokana, Grimgar, Prince of Stride  
**Going on hold**: Durarara x2, AssClass S2, Schwarzemarken, Tabi Machi Late Show  
**Close to drop**: Pandora, Haruchika, Grimgar, Prince of Stride, Luck & Logic, Bubuki Buranki  
**Biggest Surprise**: Studio DEEN killin' it this season with Rakugo Shinjuu & Konosuba.  
**Biggest Letdown**: Haruchika  
**Best OP**: Dimension W  
**Best ED**: S E K K O B O Y S SEKKO!
>> ARTICLE
I have been very pleasantly surprised. This season has been so good. I picked up a ton of shows, thinking that I would likely ditch more than half. So far I haven't even come close to dropping any of them. DEEN is actually putting out very solid shows. KyoAni is giving me beautifully animated sexy battle harem which is my guilty pleasure. The "trapped in an MMO" shows all actually have something going for them and Grimgar is god damn gorgeous. Dimension W reminds me of Cowboy Bebop. Dagashi Kashi is just amazingly fun and awesome. I could go on. My only problem so far is finding time to keep up with all these amazing episodes!

**Still the best:**  
Boku Dake ga Inai Machi

<<a fair amount of distance>>

Akagami no Shirayuki-hime

**Very Good:**  
Haikyuu!!  
Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu (And I can't say I expected this)  
Osumatsu-san  
MSG: Iron Blooded Orphans  

**The List of Alright:**  
Dimension W   
Dagashi Kashi  


**The Domain of 'Okay':**  
Durarara  
Schwarzesmarken  
Teekyuu  
Sekkou Boys  
Prince of Stride  
Koukaku no Pandora   
Mahou Shoujo Nante Mou Ii Desukara

**No, please stop:**    
Nurse Witch Komugi-chan R   
Active Raid (dropped)   
HaruChika (dropped)   
Musaigen no Phantom World (dropped)   


Each self-divided category is its own list, so essentially the whole post is a top-down list of how much I liked each anime. Some notes:

* Rakugo is by far the surprise of the season.  Sekkou Boys is probably my second surprise of the season, considering that it was essentially a meme before it started airing, and then it...actually turned out to be pretty funny.  Who would've guessed?

* Dagashi Kashi didn't live up to the hype that it got before the season started, but its still pretty interesting.   I'm not going to drop it anytime soon, which is more than I can say about...

* Musaigen no Phantom World, which after two episodes continued to be awful in every aspect. Its been a while since I dropped something after only two episodes (hell, I stuck with Comet Lucifer through 6), but Phantom World was unbearably atrocious, to the point where even giving into the '3 episode rule' was too much. 

* Active Raid and HaruChika lasted 3 episodes with me, but the former didn't catch my interest and the latter appears to be falling into a predictable and irritating pattern.

* People *hate* Schwarzesmarken for some reason.  I'm not the greatest fan of it, but its not terrible by any means...its better than Total Eclipse at least  (before anyone asks, no, I have not read the original source material).

* Boku Dake ga Inai Machi is easily the best new anime thus far.  There have been some good anime over the past few seasons, and I think this is currently above all of them by a good margin.  Hoping that it keeps up.  

* I lost a bet and therefore am required to continue watching Nurse Witch Komugi-chan R to the end.  Please send help.

Most things about **Erased** have been fantastic, and the shot composition in episode 2 was great. The only episode I've seen of **Rakugo** was good too, but it's a little boring. 

**Dagashi Kashi** makes my top three by default since I can't really stand anything else. It's been too slow for me so far, but I haven't really considered dropping it yet. 

Top of the trash is **Grimgar**. Everything it does well (art, animation, some character interactions) is amazing, but I have huge problems with it. To name one of those problems, I found that insert song scene that people were praising to be pretty pointless. Just a dude walking around still frames gloomily. Expert characterization I guess. 

I don't understand or care about what's going on in **Dimension W**. It looks nice but I think I'm only going to give it one more episode. 

**Phantom World** is looking really droppable right now. KyoAni's staff is too talented to still be making stuff like this. "Who are you to say that???" A guy who has his opinions like anyone else. 

Already dropped **Prince of Stride** and I dumped **HaruChika** halfway through the first episode. Didn't care about anything that was going on in either of those. The way they started solving that mystery in HaruChika turned me off from the show immediately.

my AOTS:

ERASED; nice OP and Epic ED(especially after i read the manga, the ED literally gave a me shiver), Damn good Story

the other:

Dimension W: we got Japanese knife Batman, awesome OP and nice dance

Sekkou Boys: SOLID animation

Grimgar: nice start, still waiting for dark stuff and character development

Konosuba: Hen na hanashi, Best Comedy this season (funny story-kun is Kazuma's VA)

Phantom world: mediocre story

Shoujo tachi: Saekano + Shirobako = ? too soon to judge for me

schwarzesmarken: Good mecha with dark stuff, count me in!

Nijiro days: sweet short, if you are looking for romance stuff(with some comedy), it's definitely for you

Dagashi Kashi: just introdution about Japanese sweet, not interesting enough for me

Plan to watch:

Active Raid & Shouwa Genroku
>> ARTICLE
I really like Boku Dake and KonoSuba, haven't enjoyed airing anime like that since Shimoneta.

Also watching Dagashi Kashi, but it's just alright.

Decided to drop Musaigen, ep 1 was ok, ep 2 was meh, ep 3 was bad. I expected better from KyoAni :/
>> ARTICLE
From worst to best of the shows I picked up this season:

**Pandora in the Crimson Shell: Ghost Urn** *2/?* Masamune Shirou wrote another manga with premise and name that brings to mind Ghost in the Shell, at worst I was expecting a rehash of the same content akin to ARISE. Unfortunately it fell short of those expectations, between the weird ecchi (some of us aren't aroused by robots), forgettable objectified characters, poorly established setting, completely failed attempts at comedy, and overall complete lack of any seriousness, means that I can't really get at all emotionally invested in the show nor derive any real enjoyment from it. I'm planning on watching the third episode, on the off chance they'll pull some sort of plot twist and so that my rating will help lower the show's average on MAL. **2/10** 
 
**Myriad Colors Phantom World** *3/?* Honestly this show reminds me of Beyond the Boundary, it's urban fantasy with similar premises, animated by Kyoto animation, unfortunately it's worse in just about every respect. Yes it's self-aware of its trashiness, but that doesn't change the fact it's trashy. Dropped at episode 3. **3/10** 

**Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There! Season 2** *2/12* These first few episodes have been notably darker than the first season, and have returned to the series' strong points, watching the JSDF kick ass, instead of harem slice of life hijinks, if this trend continues the season might end up being one of the better shows this season. **5/10** 

**Dimension W** *2/12* Between it's style, best exemplified in its OP, Loser, and the dimensional collapse, and it's great fight scenes aesthetically Dimension W has been on point, unfortunately as of yet its plot and characters haven't had any real complexity or emotional weight. As of yet the similarities to Giant Robot the Animation are fairly palpable, but it's still unclear to what extent it will follow in its footsteps. **6/10** 

**Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash** *2/12* Grimgar has the highest production standards of anything I'm watching this season, its water color backgrounds and fluid animation are simply beautiful, on the other hand it's premise, setting and characters, are painfully cliche. However it has overwhelmingly succeeded in its execution, despite its contrivances as a codified RPG world, its setting is distinctly more medieval and believable than almost any fantasy I've encountered, its fight scenes actual feel chaotic, tense, and ultimately brutal, and the story's down to earth pacing has been really immersive. Ultimately it might not end up mattering if the story and characters don't unfold their wings and take off, but I want this show to succeed more than most others this season, so I'll be optimistic. **6/10** 

**Durarara!!x2 Ketsu** *2/12* Durarara has run into a problem as of late, it's cast is so large and its plot so complex that it's struggling to tell its story, however unlike most works with such problems Durarara has managed to stay entertaining. Despite their simplicity Durarara's characters are distinctive, and dare I say it original, and as such the show's mess of a plot avoids feeling repetitive. What worries me though is that this season adapts the end of the story, and it doesn't seem at all clear to me how this show's plot could or should end, least of all in 10 more episodes. It's possible the ending will do a good job of closing off all its plot threads and character arcs, and maybe even leave a resonant thematic message, but otherwise it's going to be hard for this season to surpass the first season of Durarara. **6/10**

**Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** *2/12* Rakugo avoids many of the cliches of modern anime, and explores the distinctly Japanese art of rakugo, with extended performances that allow the voice actors and animators to subtly, but effectively develop characters, however I can't say I really think this show is going to be great. I expect that the plot will tell a story of how Yakumo find his redemption for the sins of "killing" Konatsu's father, by teaching Yotarou rakugo. Which outside the confines of anime is a very typical plot structure, but one that can if executed properly be quite inspiring. But I simply don't think it will be executed that great, because as of yet this anime has only been hindered by the fact it's an anime. There's nothing in this show's plot that profits from anime's ability to suspend disbelief and the realistic animation style while not harmful to the storytelling hasn't really enriched it, however I do think that the work suffers from the fact that animation, especially low budget limited animation, simply can't portray the nuances of human emotions as well as human faces. If the animators had taken more risks stylistically perhaps the artistic merits could justify the use of animation, but otherwise I feel this story would be better told in live action. To clarify I do expect the anime will be good, but I doubt it will be great. **7/10**

**Erased** *2/12* Erased has all the typical markers of a good anime, an interesting premise, a stylish well directed production, emotional depth, interesting characters, great music, and exciting plot. My only concern at this point is that the mystery mightn't turn out to be very interesting, or that the characters won't turn out to have as much depth as I'm currently expecting. **7/10**

**Koyomimonogatari** *2/?* Despite being a short and not having the animation budget of previous entries in the Monogatari series, Koyomimonogatari has been quite good. While both of the episodes so far have been a bit rushed, they have told emotionally and thematically complete thought provoking stories that have helped to flesh out the larger narrative of Monogatari Series and have managed to still be aesthetically pleasing and artistically inventive. However, none of the short stories in this series have come close to the thematic depth or emotional power of the larger plot arcs, and it seems unlikely that any will, which will limit my rating of this season to its current value. **7/10**

**Great**

10 - Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Surprise of the season for me and AOTS right now.

9 - ERASED: As a manga reader, I'm very pleased with the quality of the adaptation.

**Good**

7 - Dimension W: Not completely sold on this so far. Need to see more of the dynamic between the two main characters and learn more about their backstories.

6 - Haruchika: 3rd episode wasn't as good as the first two, but the 2 main characters are entertaining so there is still potential.

**Decent**

6 - Bubuki Buranki: 2nd episode wasn't nearly as good as the first. Hoping it gets back on track, because if you can get over the CGI it's got some pretty cool world-building going on.

5 - KonoSuba: Funny show with really bad animation and very tropey characters.

5 - Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu: A not as good version of Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata with a less interesting version of Yukino Yukinoshita as the ringleader. Will keep watching it because KanaHana is killing it voicing childhood friend.

**Ehhh**

5 - Musaigen no Phantom World: To me, it's gotten worse each week. The fanservice is great, but there's nothing else to watch for. I wish KyoAni was making literally anything else.

5 - Prince of Stride: Alternative: This is another example of me grading a show a bit more harshly because I expect a bit better from the studio. While the free-running parts of this show are pretty good, the man-service is really, really garbage.

5 - Dagashi Kashi: Good for gifs and making you hungry for Japanese snacks. Not much else though.

**Bad**

3 - GATE: Whoever thought, "let's add rape and prostitution to GATE and have the three main girls get almost no screentime" was dumb.

3 - Divine Gate: Man that dialogue in the first episode was insanely horrible.

2 - Ao no Kanata Four Rhythm: How do you come up with an airborne sport that's less interesting than Quidditch and try to make an entire show about it.

**Terrible**

2 - Hai to Tensou no Grimgar: Great background art. Visceral fight scenes. Everything else is either horrible or straight up offensive from the lack of any world-building to the shitty exploitation of the female characters.

**Literally the Worst**

2 - Norn9: One of the worst-written pieces of media I've ever seen.

Should probably spoiler tag that last bit for people who haven't seen the first episode yet. The sort of show where it's probably better not to know that before going in.

The OVAs need to be translated. I'm really interested in this.

[Here's an example of Rakugo done in English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswpTwmZ44)
>> ARTICLE
If anyone is curious about rakugo, it isn't particularly easy to follow or understand for non-Japanese. Not only is there a language barrier but the stories are often culturally specific and don't directly translate well. However, there is one (only one) foreign rakugo performer by the name of Katsura Sunshine. Many of his performances are based around sharing and explaining rakugo for English audiences. This has included taking traditional rakugo acts and made the culturally accessible to Westerners. I highly recommend checking him out if you have an interest in Japanese culture.

I've been interested in this since I heard Megumi Hayashibara was going to be on it. Looks great so far.

Agreed. It's super good.

Rakugo was definitely one of the hidden gems on that season and I enjoyed every episode of it. In any case people (like you) are starting to surface and its only a matter of time till the show gets enough steam to make people put it on their watch list.
>> ARTICLE
There was a small but vocal minority talking about it last season - it would almost always be mentioned in discussion threads. We just have to keep that steam going so that more people watch it!
>> ARTICLE
I am pretty sure the sub loves Rakugo, *in fact there was [WT!](https://redd.it/426lvl) article on it as well albeit the user jumped the gun and posted it while it was airing* and people obviously downvoted it down. (ethically WT! should be posted at the end cause you never know how a series can end up)

Most people on MAL shrug off the series as "gay" or "yaoi" fanservice looking at the cover which is very unfortunate. Rakugo has some of the best *realistic characters* in anime whose emotions and daily livelihood are portrayed to correct degree. It also not so subtly touches over *debates on entertainment industry* whether it should evolve to an audience demanding stream or preserve it's originality.

Well said, the characters are the most well-developed and *real* that I've ever seen. Also as you mentioned, there was a lot going on in the background with industry politics, and how it should adapt (or not) to the rapid-modernization of the era.

There were parts regarding Miyokichi/Kikuhiko that I winced at, not because they were bad, but because it was hitting real close to home particularly regarding the eternal conflict of "career vs. relationship."

And while it wasn't outright stated, I think it's possible Miyokichi may be the first depiction in anime of a comfort woman during WWII. I'll concede I could be wrong about this, but working as a prostitute in Japanese-occupied Manchuria during the war leaves that possibility open.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah it was pretty good by far my favourite series of the season, but it's not surprising that its not popular. It doesn't have any cute girls, there is no school setting and some people would probably think its yaoi based on the character design.

tbh it has a lot of intentional gay vibes (the author writes yaoi), but I found them pretty interesting because it kind of makes you question Kikuhiko's true feelings towards Sukeroku.
>> ARTICLE
It was indeed very interesting how they played with the homosexual hints, people need to grow the fuck up already and not write these things off as "yaoi"
>> ARTICLE
Im at episode 8 atm and this show has such a great atmosphere! Loving it so far.
>> ARTICLE
this and ajin were really good i regret not picking them up untill after they finished.I finished it a week ago and felt same as you
>> ARTICLE
Honestly I only missed this show cause I heard the first episode was 40 minutes and for some reason thought they would all be like that. Need to get back to it sometime.

Would you reccomend this to me if I really liked ping-pong the animation?
>> ARTICLE
I can't say since I haven't seen Ping-pong myself, but regardless I'm going to tell you to watch anyway lol. 
>> ARTICLE
I just started this yesterday, so far it's really good!
>> ARTICLE
I should've made this kind of post during the time SSY and Psycho-Pass aired. I hold an irrational grudge against Psycho-Pass because it aired at the same time as Shin Sekai Yori and completely overshadowed it, while I think SSY is a whole level ahead of PP. I just thought it was infinitely better, although PP was a good show, but everyone was like "Psycho-Pass this, Psycho-Pass that" and no one gave a fuck about Shin Sekai Yori because of that. It was frustrating.

Also I agree, Rakugo was the best anime of last season. Erased started better, but it really faltered for me. From middle to end I was like "meh"... Rakugo had kind of a hollow moment in the middle of the season for me, but I loved the beginning and the ending (Grimgar was my third contender for "maybe-AOTS" at the time but basically nothing happened so waiting for S2). So, Rakugo AOTS last season.

I feel like I'm among a very small group of people super excited for [Joker Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31405/Joker_Game) this Spring.

Why am I excited for it?  

* Tagged:  Military / Seinen
* WWII-era setting
* Based on an award-winning [novel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_Game)   
* Animated by [Production I.G](http://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10)  
* OST by [Kenji Kawai](http://myanimelist.net/people/5304/Kawai_Kenji)

Check out [the second PV.](https://youtu.be/tILWSrPcBsY)  Shit is hype, yo.

How do you literally watch every single Natsume season and special but haven't seen Baccano 
>> ARTICLE
Maybe you underestimate my love for the *Natsume* franchise...

Aside from anime I've contracted for, I usually have some (usually oddball) interest in what I choose to watch next, whether it's studio / cast / crew, or something about the setting or characters... And I may have found that now that I see *Baccano!* shares its director with all of the *Natsume* seasons, and with *Samurai Flamenco.*

Going to finish *Night Raid 1931* first, though.
>> ARTICLE
6/10 for sakura trick, you are not a believer
>> ARTICLE
I originally had it at 7/10, but there's really not much to the show aside from "girls kissing girls."  It's well-made and enjoyable, but there's nothing meaningful about it.

It really pales in comparison to a serious "Class S" (not-quite-yuri) title like the *Maria-sama* franchise, to which I gave 7's and 8's.
>> ARTICLE
> but there's really not much to the show aside from "girls kissing girls.

Agreed. it was really shallow :(
>> ARTICLE
> nothing meaningful about it

Yuri is the purest form of love. Don't you ever forget that.
>> ARTICLE
Ahh I see. Thanks for the list.

I now have some anime to check out.
>> ARTICLE
I mean, it's mostly the *Natsume* and *Maria-sama* franchises for the respective studios, but there's some other fabulous stuff in there, too.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely shocked you rated Deen that high, and had either dropped or not watched but included Higurashi.

Especially if you dropped it, since, despite the jankey animation, it really is a fantastic show. 
>> ARTICLE
The art / animation never bothered me.  I just got fed up with the series pushing the reset button every 3-4 episodes - completely discarding most characterization from the previous arcs in the process.  It's a really bad approach to mystery, in my opinion, to expect someone to watch more than a full cour (14 episodes in my case) without offering the viewer any solid clues as to the mystery at hand.
>> ARTICLE
You have to make it to the 2nd season and it all explains itself 6 episodes in.
You can also actually pick up on the hints of it in the last arc of the first season but it comes right out with it on episode 6 of the 2nd.
>> ARTICLE
Well, I guess that's just a matter of tastes. Personally, it's a fantastic mechanic that leads in to and is essential to one of the best character arcs I've ever seen, but I can't explain more without spoiling it massively. 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I really wanted to add Joker Game as well but I felt like I was listing too many Spring Anime. 

I will definitely be watching Joker Game as well. The preview made me a little scared that they might be going for a 3deep5u sort of feel but I'm still interested in the show regardless.
>> ARTICLE
I see.  I'm not nearly as excited for most of the other stuff you listed for Spring.  Bones really has to win me back after my disappointment with *Kekkai Sensen,* and I'm not much for comedies in general, so this is definitely my pre-airing pick for AOTS.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I think Joker Game will be great as well but it'll be hard to beat Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Diamond is Unbreakable for me.

My favorite Jojo arc and so far the adaptations have been great. Might be my bias but this is my pre-airing pick for AOTS
>> ARTICLE
I'm not a manga reader for *JoJo,* so my hype for that one is considerably less than yours.  I enjoyed the previous installments of the franchise, but (my bias here) I'll never pick something campy like *JoJo* over a serious drama. \*Shrug.\*
>> ARTICLE
Jojo part 4 is a serial killer mystery, its one of the best Jojo parts.
>> ARTICLE
Okay... But is it still campy like the rest of the franchise has been?
>> ARTICLE
Don't know what you mean, Jojo can get very serious at times.
>> ARTICLE
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_%28style%29):

> Camp is a social, cultural, and aesthetic style and sensibility based on deliberate and self-acknowledged theatricality.

If that description doesn't fit *JoJo* to a "T," I don't know what does.
>> ARTICLE
Jojo's campiness steadily drops as the series goes on, but definitely maintains a baseline. I'd actually say it's at its lowest in Part 4.
>> ARTICLE
>I felt like I was listing too many Spring Anime.

Spring is usually where the biggest projects get premiered. 
>> ARTICLE
It looks pretty and sounds interesting and I hope it is something more like Night Raid anime rather than something like Gangsta. I hope it sticks more with the period era action and politics.
>> ARTICLE
> Night Raid

Still need to watch that one, lol.

> I hope it sticks more with the period era action and politics.

I'm with you on that.  I know the staffs are completely different - and that I fanboy for the studio like no other - but the fact that it's I.G gives me a lot of faith.  Their period-set shows are generally *packed* with authentic detail, often more than necessary, even.

Also by greatest slice of life are you referring to aria?

Manga from the same author as Aria, with the with the same fuzzy and warm feelings. The director with the same as the Aria anime. It follows the antics of the members and counselor of the scuba diving club from a school at the Izu peninsula, home of a small fishing town, but also a popular scuba diving spot in Japan.

What a fantastic manga. I very much look forward to seeing it animated.
>> ARTICLE
my first thought when opening up this thread was "Ctrl+F 3 gatsu no Lion"

I am glad someone has mentioned it! I was always at a loss as to why it wasn't animated as it is universally beloved by critics and a huge seller but when it was announced I was ecstatic.
>> ARTICLE
How do you handle that title?  Sangatsu?
>> ARTICLE
Yup!
>> ARTICLE
I totally forgot about 3gatsu no Lion. It's on my PTW list. One of my favorite slice of life manga that I'm reading. Also interesting that it will be animated by Shaft.

I don't know too much about Amanchu but I've been hearing it has a similar vibe to Aria. This makes me happy.

Can't stop humming the melody to the Erased opening.

I love the ED as well. The ending song itself is pretty great on its own however the transitions are superb.

>> ARTICLE
> Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice)

I wish this was a full series! Although KyoAni is also known for making some pretty great movies; it should be an interesting watch regardless.

Thanks for making this! Now I am pumped up for the rest of the year so early on. :3
>> ARTICLE
I've never read the manga but Koe no Katachi just seems like it was destined for director Yamada Naoko and KyoAni. For a story involving a remorseful bully and a deaf girl, careful characterization and attention to detail are going to be top priority. This story should be right up their alley.



>> ARTICLE
It's sad because the manga length is just about perfect for a 13 episode series, with maybe a quick 4, 5 chapters per episode.

No problem! Glad to share my excitement with you

Will they use a deaf voice actress or something? That would be a first i guess. Hope they can live up to the manga!

I don't know, but I would guess that that is on their mind as a possibility.

That might be difficult, but a really good VA can imitate what it's like (i.e. Gangsta)

2016 has barely started.

Also I have a really bad feeling about the Rewrite anime, considering its 8-bit.
>> ARTICLE
Well, considering Rewrite was garbage, my expectations aren't high at all. Only routes worth anything were Common, Kotori, Terra, and Moon.

>tfw no based Maeda.
At least he did the main theme and motif
>> ARTICLE
The rewrite anime isn't even out yet, what are you talking about?
>> ARTICLE
there is a visual novel, buddy

>> ARTICLE
Hype for Seishuun Da and [minor Rewrite spoiler(Chihaya route)](/s "Chihaya swinging that sign post") i dunno why but I always get goosebumps on that part. Also VN had that another opening with anime style production :D
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I know. I wanted to get this list out in the beginning of the year so newer viewers could get a feel for which shows they will look forward to.

One of my favorite parts of watching anime is anticipating a new show or a new episode and I just wanted to help people out in that regard.

On the topic of 8-bit I actually don't think they're too awful. They really dropped the ball with Walkure Romanze and Absolute duo, but I actually enjoyed Tokyo Ravens, Grisaia and Infinite stratos.

Sure I would have strongly preferred Kyo-Ani but I'm not too disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I guess so. What I meant was that since the year is really just starting things can change at any time and you dont want to get super hyped for something and then have it turn out to be crap. But I understand what you mean.

On the other topic Rewrite is going to need at least 48 episodes in order for it to be a decent adaptation. Im really not a fan of anything that 8-bit have put out, and considering that they apparently screwed up Grisaia (a VN that I have not read, or bothered to watch the anime for, so take that as you will) Im really doubting their ability here, personally.

Im just saying, they could have at least gotten JC Staff or PA works to do it.
>> ARTICLE
PA works with the Nagi no Asakura team on this anime would have been amazing.

If everything goes to shit I hope we at least get a remake adaptation like we did with Kanon.
>> ARTICLE
>>you will never get a Little Busters! and Refrain animated by KyoAni  
it hurts too much to live
>> ARTICLE
One can only dream.
>> ARTICLE
Hopefully 8bit will have a slightly higher budget when it comes to this considering it's popularity. The only thing I've seen from them is Comet Lucifer (my only 1/10) so I'm already going in without any expectations so I won't be disappointed.
>> ARTICLE
Oh god. Yeah, Comet lucifer was not very good. However Comet Lucifer was an anime original. It seems 8bit have a little better success when adapting material.

I have my worries as well but I'm still excited for this anime in the Summer. It feels like a great Summer anime.
>> ARTICLE
I'm really sick of all the 8 Bit hate. **8 Bit never made the Grisaia storyboards** and had to follow them. The director for Rewrite is the one who made the 2nd VN OP for Rewrite and he did an amazing job at it. Also, this is a Key adaptation. Even when people hated Little Busters it got the entire story adapted, so even with a different company I think we can expect Rewrite to have a finished product. **With all the hate 8 Bit is getting, I would like to think that they'd want to redeem themselves with Rewrite, essentially "rewriting" their image.**
>> ARTICLE
Facts mean nothing when there's a narrative to push.
>> ARTICLE
Im really sick of every time I criticize this studio it's just blown off as "just more 8-bit hate". I didnt even learn about this apparent anti-8bit circlejerk until I started saying that they would be a terrible choice to adapt rewrite. Now Im learning that all these random people agree with me, so I must ask, if the consensus is that this studio is not very good, then maybe, they just really aren't?

I didnt watch Grisaia but Im really not a fan of anything else they've put out so I don't have a good image in my mind when I think of them. Yeah the final product could be amazing since you never know but Im going to keep my expectations low, which makes me sad since Im a big Key fan.

Also I dont know many people who hated Little Busters, it was a decent adaptation, although the VN was better obviously.
>> ARTICLE
Deminsion W is pretty cool along with that MMO anime thing grimgar and and that new German mesh anime (sorry I'm downstairs no computer to get the proper name sorry 
>> ARTICLE
I'm currently watching Dimension W. It's pretty solid and I'm having fun with it but it just missed the cut for my list. Definitely a cool show  though.

Grimgar is aight for me. It's fun at times but at other times it just kinda drags along. Slow start to the show as well. I like the perspective that Grimgar presents though. Characters are inconsistent but pretty cool.

The mech anime, Schwarzesmarken, I really don't like very much. The action scenes are alright which is to be expected. However the story itself is not very interesting and the characters aren't very likable or unique. The pacing is a little obnoxious as well. I'm seeing the same issues I had with Muv-Luv TE in this one. I won't feel emotional over characters I don't really care about and thus it doesn't really make a difference when they are killed. However one thing that is better in Schwarzesmarken over Muv-Luv is that the fan service is way less obnoxious and the story seems more focused for now.

I still don't like Schwarzesmarken but I can see where mecha lovers disappointed in Comet Lucifer, Heavy Object and Aquarion can really like this show. Schwarzesmarken is not a great show IMO but it's certainly a lot better than the mecha shows that have been released recently.

I think an important aspect of watching anime is anticipating what will be great shows in the future and I want the newer members of the community to have a chance to experience that as well.

I will no doubt be watching the new season of Seven Deadly Sins though. It was a pleasant surprise when it aired and I've liked the manga since.

Ojii-San to marshmellow is fantastic as well.

Oshiete Galko Chan is also a refreshing bit of high school girl humor.

I dunno about you guys, but I'm really excited for [Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31764/Nejimaki_Seirei_Senki__Tenkyou_no_Alderamin). All we really know is that it's coming out sometime in 2016, but the synopsis sounds great, and I'm pretty hype for it.

EDIT: Also adding [Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu) for Spring 2016. Yeah, it has a generic plot, but I'm still pretty excited.

Nah I think Erased, Mob Psycho, Jojo4 and SNK2 have a better chance. Too stacked this year for an battle shounen with a traditional underdog story to be AOTY IMO. No doubt I will enjoy it though.

Oh C'mon.. You know you like a badass underdog. Everyone loves an underdog (Specially if theyre MC).

Erased seems to be it this year tbh or possibly SNK S2. Depends on what you mean ''will be the anime this year'' Popularity or ratings.
>> ARTICLE
> e the anime this year'' Popularity or ratings.

Both popularity and rating. Yeah, I know.. we havent seen the anime of my hero academia, but Im sure It'll be popular with an amazing rating.

In Jump magazine they have this ranking system. And you know what? Boku no Hero Academia is always at Rank 1-5. Amazing isnt it? This new manga is competing with the most amazing manga like One Piece, Toriko, Assasination Clasroom, etc. 

So... I think My Hero Academia or Boku no Hero Academia will be the anime of the year. (I really like this manga. So.. I know Im kinda bias.) Haha
>> ARTICLE
I could see it, but the one thing keeping me from thinking that is that the manga is rated like 8.33 on myanimelist, I see it getting the popularity but not necessarily the ratings through.
>> ARTICLE
> ould see it, bu

So.. 8.33 is bad? From what I remember SAO, SNK, OPM rating was almost the same. But they became the AOTY. Thats why I think My Hero Academia has a big chance of becoming one too :D.

Almost all of the anime this year looks promising, so I cant really tell what anime is goin to be the best this year. So.. Yeah. Hahaha xD.

But I realy want it to be "My hero Academia".

Missing the AOTY and the anime that will sell more than all the title in your list combined:

* Love Live Sunshine
It's love live. It's a new setting and new girls. It will have a large budget. And will be damn good like the first two seasons, and sell like bread. 

And Sekko Boys is overhyped but not a good anime.

Another anime you need to see in 2016 is "March comes like a lion" that is an adaptation of a very good manga, a more adult slice of life.

I'm not sure if this might be the kind of thing you're looking for, but these are a couple of things I've been thinking about blogging about because of the shows I've been watching this season. Both probably fall under the general topic of 'how characters refer to themselves and each other'. 

=====

(1) The significance of using surname vs. first name (and the nuances in this, for example, the variation across different parts of Japan). 

One example I remember is from ERASED / BokuMachi, where Airi switches from using "Fujinuma-san" when having dinner with him and his mother, to "Satoru-san" when they're on the bicycle later. The significance of this is actually explained in the manga (and in the anime, it did come up with Kayo, Kenya and Satoru in episode 7), but I'd hazard a guess that most Western viewers probably missed the Airi one in the anime. 

======

(2) The significance of different pronouns / address terms / how people refer to others in 3rd person. (i.e. what people use to refer to themselves, to the person they're speaking to, or to a third person who might or might not be there)

One example that was explained in the Boku Machi manga is Airi using "Airi" as her first person pronoun in front of Satoru -- Satoru wonders if that's because they've become closer.

Another example that comes to mind at the moment is how Miyokichi refers to/addresses Sukeroku vs. Kiku in Rakugo--though I'm not sure this is as significant as I think, so I was wondering what your thoughts on it are. In episode 12, the translator translated "Anta" into "Darling"...I'm not sure that gives off the right implication, because whilst "Anta" is a shortened version of "Anata," which I understand many Japanese women use to address their husband, "Anta" is really rude. 

What do you think of that translation of "Anta" as "Darling"? (Or, more generally, what Miyokichi/Yurie's way of speaking to or about Sukeroku implies about what she thinks about him?) 

=====

There's also a more controversial area that I've already written about, but it's more about Japanese politics than about culture per se: anything to do with Japan's security policy. I find that most people who comment on this online don't really know all the nuances about the issues in Japan. That said, I understand that many younger Japanese people also don't know that much about this either... 
>> ARTICLE
Well perhaps if Airi got some damn screen time it would mean more to us.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, that's a great one! 

I'm well aware of the ~~second~~ first one, I can understand how non-Japanese can have hard time, but didn't think much about the ~~first~~ second one and yeah, it is something I completely overlooked. Switching from Fujinuma-san to Satoru-san is more about being clear whom she is addressing (cause mother and Satoru are both Fujinuma-san), but yeah, Airi calling herself Airi instead of watashi is indeed a big deal. Do Japanese learners study about this "change of perspective" thing, maybe at advanced classes? 

As for Anta vs Darling... It's a bit bewildering, as I cannot think of any other candidates to take place of Anta in English. Can you think of any? Anta(by female and Omae by male) can be rude when you use it to talk to someone you are not close to, but with this context and the era it can show their closeness and certain down-to-earth affection, and a bit of "age" or "history" of the relationship as husband and wife. (In modern day Japan, Anta sounds rustic and Anata sounds classy, but if Miyo says "Anata" in Tokushima in Showa era, that would sound too snobby and unreal.) 

> There's also a more controversial area that I've already written about

That sounds interesting too. 
>> ARTICLE
> Do Japanese learners study about this "change of perspective" thing, maybe at advanced classes?

Ah, and I forgot to reply to this point. To be honest, I don't know, having never studied Japanese formally--I'd assume it was an advanced thing, though. But I'll try and ask some of my friends whether they did. 
>> ARTICLE
You know how "perspective" changes and we use different ways to address others depending on who is around. I think there should be a lesson about this iirc, using family conversation. We usually say, the perspective is changed to that of the youngest in general. So, people call others by the youngest child's way of addressing others, like "Onee-chan", "Otoo-san", "Ojii-chan", and so on. Older kids often call themselves "Onii-chan" or "Onee-chan", to use his/her younger siblings' perspective at home, while the only kid or the youngest often use their first name. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah, that makes sense. In English, we do a similar thing  my brothers family has changed all address terms to those that his kids would use (Mum, Dad, Nanny etc). He even forgot to change back once when he was talking to me, calling our Dad our dialect's equivalent of Ojii-chan instead of Dad. It doesnt really extend to siblings, though, because everyone just uses first names (and I for our first person pronouns). 

But come to think of it, though, we do a similar thing with Chinese (my familys ethnically Chinese). Although my own parents were more likely to say your brother to me, I remember aunts and uncles using the equivalents of Onee-chan etc in their own families. 

And this extends to society as well. I work at a university, and whilst I use first names when I am speaking with my colleagues (superiors, really, but unlike in Japan, even PhD students are considered equals with regards to how we speak with each other in an academic department). But in public forums or in classes, then the lecturer/speaker is addressed more formally, with Mr. / Mrs. / Dr. / Professor + surname etc. 

I think that the major difference between English and Japanese (and a few other Asian languages) is how degrees of closeness in more casual settings are expressed. In all cases, its a matter of the language used, but I think its actually a bit more obvious in Japanese because of *keigo* and stricter rules about who can/should be using first names (or nicknames derived from first names) vs. surnames (and nicknames derived from them). In English, there are also differences that indicate how close you are with the person youre speaking with, but there arent set rules so it doesnt actually hold as much significance. Furthermore, things like Airi switching from atashi to Airi as her 1st person pronoun in front of Satoru are difficult to capture in English as succinctly as in Japanese. Its possible, but I dont think all the translators know its significance, so its not always captured in the translation.

p.s. I asked a friend of mine who tutors for Japanese courses, and she said that they teach about changes in first / second person reference terms in relation to relative status of the people speaking with each other, but that it's not something practised in class. So learners may learn about it, but not really think about it outside of a school setting until they have to live in Japan (on exchange etc). 
>> ARTICLE
Airi calling herself Airi shows how she feels comfortable like at home, talking to Satoru at that point. Getting rid of the part where she called herself watashi in the beginning would mislead a viewer and make a big difference in her character itself in anime, as a rather immature girl who does not care about how she would sound to others. But then, also, some Japanese are not careful enough to notice the differences :P

That said, yes, it is super-hard to express this in subs, and probably one of the most headache causing. I hope translators are aware of this, and yet cannot find a reasonable enough way to do it. There are many troubles translating English to Japanese too, though I don't have a good example at hand now. 

It's a shame if this practice isn't generally done in classes, but may not be necessary unless the learner is seriously planning to live here or plan to be a translator of literature. You can't teach/learn every single thing after all, and I'm sure there are so many things I don't know happening in English conversations that I haven't learned too. 
>> ARTICLE
Thank you for explaining more of the nuances of Airi switching from watashi to Airi. Because I had thought that using ones one name as a first person pronoun was something that people grew out of, Airi puzzled me a little. So the details about how it sounds to others help me understand it a bit better. 

For English to Japanese, I would think that sarcasm and irony might be two of the more difficult things to translate, especially if youre working only from text and thus without tone of voice etc (which is how we normally tell). 

Also, back to your original question, a conversation elsewhere reminded me of another example of things that things Japanese people take for granted that (foreigners) might miss: how people behave.

Its relevant especially for Rakugo this season, but also for shows like K-ON!!, which a lot of Western/English-speaking viewers call out for baiting. I think that there are differences in how people behave around each other (depending on how close they are but also on whether they are the same or opposite sexes, and even whether theyre in public or private) that people not from Japan or other East Asian countries. So what some Japanese peoplelike yourself, going by some of your comments on Rakugosee as quite normal rivalry/really close friendships/sibling-like relationships, people in the West tend to see as yuri- or yaoi-baiting. 
>> ARTICLE
He he, good point, but a lot of Japanese called out for 'baiting' on internet forums too! But yeah, maybe the level of seriousness in those posts may differ. Like I said in other comment reply, basically Japanese are liars and whatever comes out of mouth does not necessarily mean what they have in mind. I've realized that in the final episode discussion people note how Kiku doesn't treat Konatsu well, but I'd rather say his love as a father and the mixed feeling stands out more obvious and looks less fake by his 'hate speech' (kinda) than by normal straight-forward words. It's just that he doesn't treat her as a child, but treats her as a person.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I think I've seen comments in Japanese discussions. And I remember reading a few Japanese bloggers who were a bit uncomfortable with what Yamada et al did with episode 8 of Eupho (they were novel readers, and they thought she went a tad overboard with the 'baiting'). But the English speakers I've interacted with online have taken it a lot more seriously...a few interviews about the series have been translated, and they tend to think that Yamada's being...let's say 'facetious', when she says 'it's not yuri' to her. They think that she's dismissing what GLBT or queer people feel, whether as a 'phase' people go through, or worse, that Yamada/KyoAni's main aim is to use it as something to "appeal to viewers who like that kind of 'bait'." 

> basically Japanese are liars and whatever comes out of mouth does not necessarily mean what they have in mind
I've found Rakugo to be really interesting as an example of this. I'm always thinking: "why did he/she say that and why?" and it's difficult to know when a character is speaking the truth and when they are lying, or what the mix of truth/lies is in any conversation. I suspect that's where a lot of the differing interpretations come from. We know that there are lies and half-truths in the story that Yakumo has related to us, but no one agrees on what they are. 

In the case of Konatsu, I wonder if there's an earlier line (or translation of the line) that might be responsible. The following line by Kiku: 



Does it mean something like: 

"In the end, I was alone. That I had no choice but to live on alone was something that, in this time, I felt deep within my bones." ?
>> ARTICLE
A lot of Western viewers seem to be bothered by certain morals such as sexism along with glbt, age difference in romance, and racism, while not many have problems with their moral related to killing, considering how MCs in death note and ajin are so popular. It's quite interesting that many get offended and feel the need to push their own morals towards the chars in anime more seriously than what I have observed in Japanese forums.

> Does it mean something like:  
> "In the end, I was alone. That I had no choice but to live on alone was something that, in this time, I felt deep within my bones." ?

That sounds fine to me. What about this line?
>> ARTICLE
Oh, that's a good point about the Fujinuma-san/Satoru-san one in the manga (although it makes me wonder why the anime writers chose to go with just "Fujinuma-san" then...) 

What I found interesting about the Rakugo example was that Miyo called Kiku "Anata" once in that scene. She also used "Kiku-san," if I remember correctly. But Sukeroku is "Anata" (prior to episode 12) and then "ano hito" (when she's speaking to Kiku) or "Anta" when she's addressing him directly in this latest episode. Whilst I feel it's probably about the "history" of their husband and wife relationship, I'm really not sure about what we're meant to take from it, if anything...  

In terms of translating "Anta" without using "Darling" or other terms that indicate real affection ("Honey" Dear" etc), I can't really think of anything, either. I'd probably have just ignored it and had Miyo go "I-" as if starting to say "I'm sorry." But that's only because I don't think "Darling" is right for their relationship at this point. It could just be me... 

(On the topic of Rakugo, though, I've been skimming some of the episode discussion threads, and I'm really appreciating some of the things you've shared--such as details about the rakugo stories etc. I really feel like this is a series I have to go back and watch again after it ends next week!) 

As for the one on Japan's security policy, I'm not watching GATE, but I've seen people criticise it for being 'right-wing', a fantasy about 'invading other countries' etc without really understanding the debate within Japan. I wrote a lot of notes about it when I translated an article related to GATE (https://karice.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/p496/), but I'm not sure [EDIT] how to summarise exactly what western audiences don't understand/simplify etc... 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, anime's sudden "Satoru-san" change was rather strange, but I didn't think much before I read manga. There are quite a few things I didn't quite see fit in anime. I enjoyed the anime, but I personally wouldn't have enjoyed it much if I had read manga first, due to the different interpretation and presentation.

Using Anata to Kiku is most likely because she wasn't close enough to Kiku, imo, or possibly their relationship took place in Tokyo - Miyo is from Shikoku and was trying to act classy in front of Kiku. Whatever the reason behind it, Miyo calling Sukeroku "Anta" just reminded me that they were really husband and wife. 

As for Darling, how would you describe the right situation to use the term? 

Gate is a bit controversial topic and I'm actually trying to stay away lately :p I'm really tired of being called both netouyo and busayo on internet. It's just that there are too many people who love labeling others when it comes to politics and refuse to accept there are people who are actually neutral but with opinions that could be seen either wing. But it's always interesting to read what others say. Thanks for the link! I actually didn't know that discussion was wide spread to English speakers too. 
>> ARTICLE
On BokuMachi: I agree. I only started reading halfway through, so I didnt have a problem with the changes in the first half when I was watching. But the last two episodes were a bit of a let down because I had already read the manga by the time I saw them. 

Terms like Darling Dear and Honey are used between *loving* couples, even ones that arent married. Where a couple have fallen out of love and remain married only because they have no other choice (whether for children, because of societal stigma etc), then I dont expect them to use any kind of term that indicates even a little bit of affection. Maybe just a name (mostly when they're not angry with them). So, whilst I would agree that Miyos use of Anta for Sukeroku is a marker that they really are husband and wife, Darling indicates a level of affection that Miyokichi just doesnt seem to have for her husband...

Though it could be just how I see their relationship: one where any affection she had for him has sunk largely into indifference, frustration or even distaste. 

I know what you mean about GATE. I rarely talk about Japanese politics when discussing anime/manga, even when its relevant, because I find that most people dont understand the nuances of the debate, which a number of Japanese people, like yourself, would. Trying to explain those nuances just gets us attacked, usually from both sides, because we either not right-wing enough or not left-wing enough. I thought that the debate of Miyazaki Hayaos last film, *The Wind Rises*, was pretty reflective of that. 

>> ARTICLE
On BokuMachi, my gripe is not with the changes, but more about the presentation by the director. I now see the manga and anime as totally different works now, and it's hard for me to see any respect towards the original work from the production side. It was changed into a complete different entertainment show to fit the director's liking (and many people liked it). On the other hand, I just started reading Rakugo's manga, and even with so many changes added and made in anime, I still see it as a faithful enough adaptation and the director or production side showing respect and love to the original source. I'm not saying one is better or worse, but I'd definitely appreciate the latter if I were the original creator. 

So these small language sensitive differences you can see in BokuMachi are just another part of what the production side ignored as irrelevant, and whether it was good or not is up to each viewer, I guess. 

Thanks for the explanation on "Darling". Miyokichi used to address Sukeroku as "Anata" before, like after the kabuki play (where Kiku played Benten-kozou with makeup). So, using "Darling" was probably the best translation available to show the difference. I'm not sure how else that could have been done, really. And also, [Rakugo manga spoiler](/s "considering the manga's later part, it actually didn't matter how Miyokichi actually felt about Sukeroku, but how Kiku wanted it to sound, anyways") so it may not be a bid deal. 
>> ARTICLE
Im a bit ambivalent about those aspects of the BokuMachi adaptation myself. I read some interviews last week, including one where Sanbe-sensei said that he was really happy with the anime adaptation, and he implied that he thought that they were basically trying to cover the same ground. Of course, he might just have been trying to be polite Personally, the thing I liked least about the anime was how blatant they made the message. I liked the subtlety in the manga much better. 

Yes, I had realised that Miyo had changed from using Anata for Sukeroku/Shin to Anta. Its still something Im thinking over though, and Im going to try to remember to ask a friend of mine next week, as shes actually researching the use of this word, albeit in modern Japan. 

Personally, if Id been *writing* these three as English-speakers, Id have had Miyo use a nickname of some sort, probably just a shortened form of his name. To me, that leaves approximately the same impression that Anta gives meit shows theyre close but leaves it a bit more ambiguous as to how she feels about him. (And yes, Id do that even knowing that spoiler, which Id learnt about after last weeks episode) Though of course, Im speaking as someone for whom Japanese is a second language
>> ARTICLE
Oh yes, the author said he liked it. Like you said, most Japanese hardly say negative things in public, and he even says he loved the live action movie, which makes me believe he is another Japanese who would only say nice things in public - as a sort of virtue here. (I read this isn't good in Chinese culture.) He may really love it or may not, I can never tell. 

I'd also better tell you again that I did enjoy the anime, otherwise, I wouldn't have started reading this manga (I don't read the magazine, so I probably would have missed it out if I didn't get to see this in anime, so I am grateful to anime too in that regard). It's just that my interpretation of the original manga was very different from that of the anime staff - and there are things I despise, like how some characters were treated, Yashiro and Airi are obvious ones, but also the manga editor, Yuuki, and Kenya esperically. The things that bugged me so much while watching the anime became very clear after reading it in manga, and if I didn't read the manga, I would have misunderstood the author so badly.

The hardest part of adaptation in anime is that manga(or LN) is generally very ambivalent and allows readers more imagination and processing(in brain) than anime where you basically passively receive already processed info one way. So, if the anime production staff and your taste match, then you will likely find the adaptation successful. And to be honest, there aren't many anime that I find better than the original manga, so it is very hard to please me anyways ;) 

As for Miyo, maybe making her say "Shin" or something in English may have been interesting, but then, that may stir up another debate on "translation accuracy". It's really tough. I wonder what it would have been if Miyo had called him "Touchan" by Konatsu's perspective :P
>> ARTICLE
Oh, it sounds like our feelings about the BokuMachi anime are quite similar, though I might be slightly more forgiving about the cuts the anime team made to fit the show into 12 episodes -- I [wrote about it last week](https://karice.wordpress.com/2016/03/27/p499/), straight after the show ended. To be honest, I found the pacing in the 2nd half of the manga a little too drawn out...though I do prefer how Sanbe-sensei presented the themes the story was concerned with. 

That said, Sanbe-sensei sounded pretty excited talking about the anime in that interview, so I know really know how to interpret that. Of course, he had only seen the first four episodes at that point...

> that may stir up another debate on "translation accuracy".

I used to prefer more accurate translation, I think--but the more Japanese I learn, the more I realise that it just doesn't work. To me, the important point is to get the meaning that's conveyed across. If Miyo had used "Touchan," then I think something like "Dear" would have been appropriate. Even "Darling" -- but then, "Touchan" would also have indicated a more loving household than what we were presented with...
>> ARTICLE
I think the roof top ending was one of the many options the author had in mind when the director started working on the anime ending and talked about it with the author. I don't remember where I read this, but Sanbe once said that he was given more pages (and/or more episodes) for the ending (or towards the ending) at some point and he could expand his story more to do what he wanted to do or something along that line. I didn't find the 2nd half "a little too drawn out", but it's probably more about personal taste. 

Either way, it is Ito who insisted on having it on one cour according to some of the interviews I read. Probably Ito already had his own interpretation of the story of how it should be after a few episodes when he decided he wanted to direct it. And the live action movie release date (March) must have also pushed them to do it in one cour. The anime is a fine entertainment, but the whole theme was dumbed down to me when compared to the original.

As for Touchan, we all know Miyo would never call him that and I merely meant it as a comparison.

Have you seen Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, OP?
>> ARTICLE
No, I haven't. What did you find interesting in it? 
>> ARTICLE
Oh, my point was.. there are some series that sometimes goes pretty alien to western viewers

There are lot of things that will miss the western audience or people who don't have enough experience in Japanese culture. It has parodies of movie posters, politicians, advertisements, wordplays, mocks some systems like arranged marriage.. I don't even know how many jokes I missed when I saw and all I could imagine is how well japanese would be laughing their stomach off while watching that show
>> ARTICLE
Ah I see what you mean. But that sort of thing is actually not always taken for granted even for Japanese audience to understand. Sometimes only a few fans notice such first and talks about it on forums and the majority learn later, too. But yeah, there are probably a lot like those hard things. Thanks. (Checked out the zetsubou sensei OP and it looks pretty hard to understand it all!) 

I had something more simple, like, it is now very well-known that sakura flower petals represents spring, and often graduation or academic year starting, but someone, for example, maybe a Scandinavian who images summer with flowers might not think that way if he/she was not familiar with it. 
>> ARTICLE
Ah.. I think I misunderstood and took what you meant to extreme levels. I know one..

The bamboo thingy that goes dok... dok... water flows, called [Shishi-odoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shishi-odoshi) is basically used to scare of birds

>> ARTICLE
Ahhh. Yeah, but that thing too is not used to scare of birds/animals lately, and many do not know the original usage. We now have it only for aesthetics means ;) Things like this actually interests me too, because anime fans often seem to know more about Japanese culture by digging info in anime than Japanese in Japan!
>> ARTICLE
I think I misunderstood again, Are you japanese?
>> ARTICLE
yup.
>> ARTICLE
Is there any symbolic significance to a shishi-odoshi that you can think of? I've seen a few shows where they will cut away to one falling multiple times in mid-conversation (most notably, it's associated with Kanbaru in the Monogatari Series) and I could never figure out what the significance of it is.
>> ARTICLE
Well, first of all, I'd have to warn you that this is my own opinion, and not necessarily all Japanese think the same way. That said, whenever I hear of that sound, I think of silence or quietness, and the only sound available there confirms that it's dead silent and nobody around. (Something or someone may be secretly hidden but not noticeable.) If it's night, then everyone is already asleep, but you (and whoever is with you). 

But then, it may mean something else depending on the context, so I'll have to see the scene to be precise. If it always appears as a house of the char(I'm assuming that Kanbaru is a name of the char), then it may represent that she is a born-rich girl in Kyoto, or if it's cut in the middle of the conversation, then it may mean silence. Can you tell me a specific episode and time of that appearing?
>> ARTICLE
It happens pretty much every time Araragi and Kanbaru are at her house. [Here's a crunchyroll link](http://www.crunchyroll.com/bakemonogatari/episode-7-suruga-monkey-part-2-610933) to the first episode where that happens. They have a big conversation from about 3:00 to 14:00 with a ton of *bonks* scattered throughout it.

>> ARTICLE
Can't really think of an answer to your question but something related would be western anime fans calling themselves "otaku" thinking it's a positive term.
>> ARTICLE
People who use it positively don't understand what it means in Japan. The otaku are the people who have no social lives at all and just stay inside playing games and watching anime. Almost always they are unemployed. It's not a desirable lifestyle and is understandably looked down upon.
>> ARTICLE
Aren't those called "hikikomori"? As for "otaku", in a recenly finished "Oshiete! Galko-chan" that was used as a pretty neutral term referring to subculture, just like "gyaru".


>> ARTICLE
The terms cross over. Technically, an otaku is just a 'x geek' like 'computer nerd', but the connotation is always negative. It's not a neutral term. Think of how nerd was used 20 years ago. It technically wasn't bad, but the connotation was always that the person in question was wimpy and didn't socialise.
>> ARTICLE
You mean, western anime fans use "otaku" as a positive term in general? 
>> ARTICLE
I think (hope) that's something that died out in the early 2000's.

Haha nope, I see people calling themselves otaku all the time on anime fan pages on Facebook, which is the reason I disliked most of them.

Between those episodes I had changed my mind on what the words might have meant and the relationships. I still think a lot of scenes/lines are left open for interpretation on purpose (not the one in episode 5 in particular) and that brings a lot of interesting discussion that's related to this topic, since different knowledge of the background/language/influences will bring different opinions about what things might mean.

Thanks a lot for those notes, once again, by the way. Was quite interesting (and helpful) reading them.
>> ARTICLE
Thank you :D It really was interesting for me too! I do agree that there are many things open for interpretation, and I'm not gonna say I'm always right (except for this "sonnanja-nai" phrase!) and quite often taking things for granted can blind/intervene us too. I really enjoyed reading many people's interpretations there and I'm gonna miss it so much after rakugo finishes!

Pretty much all of [Kyouougiga](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_TV) is deep symbolism and casually missed. There's so much in there there's whole [lostinanime blogs series](http://lostinanime.com/tag/kyousougiga/) dedicated to putting it out. 

Death Parade is the same way. It is really easy to get lost and not 'get' it.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, but as for Kyousougiga, like I said to others, those obvious Japanese aspects are not what I have in mind - it is easy enough for me to spot what you would have trouble with. Those, like Buddhism, Shinto, Choujuu-giga, or traditional cultures like kabuki or rakugo, are also the things young Japanese do not know well either, and very often anime fans know a lot better than an average Japanese.

Characters addressing each other without honorifics. Especially if they used to before.

>> ARTICLE
Good point, yeah. I think I once heard that it can be translated using "tu vs vous" in French, but probably not in English. I was wondering how it gets translated. So, that part is often ignored in subs? 
>> ARTICLE
"Tu vs vous" is on the right track. I don't think there are many other languages out there that have equivalents of everything going down the scale from dono - sama - san - kun - chan - tan and more.

It depends on who's writing the subtitles. The trend I'm seeing is that most professional subtitles will ignore them. Fansubbers are more likely to keep them in.

It's pretty recent. As late as 2008, I remember that prof. subs still kept honorifics in.

Ah I see. Thanks. I guess the choice/trend of the terms used on subs change as time goes by.

I noticed that part/most? of Anglosphere is very prejudiced against romances between adult people (even if they are barely adult, like 19, 20) and high-school teenagers to the point they might treat them as something which is really worth noticing, or even condemning.

If I understood correctly from the anime I saw Japanese might not have the custom of sending people to prison as sex offenders for being engaged to a high-schooler, on the contrary it seems to be a relatively frequent scenario, which doesn't raise many eyebrows. Or am I wrong?
>> ARTICLE
Like going back to GTO?
>> ARTICLE
> on the contrary it seems to be a relatively frequent scenario

First of all, you must not believe everything happening in anime to be true. Many anime has its premise set to a fantasy world. If you try to have sex with a high schooler in Japan now, you will be arrested. I do see/hear news about it too. The thing is, it is not bound by the national constitution but by local government's bylaws, so details can vary, but most, if not all, governments definitely say no to such sex offending to those younger than 18 yrs old, afaik. That said, just walking together or talking or maybe some pure platonic relationship with marriage in view (like McGillis in IBO) is not necessarily considered evil (yet, that can of course cause misunderstanding in real life, then you know you can get in trouble easily.) 

If you are talking about Erased, 29 yrs old protagonist and 17 yrs old heroine being *friends* is not a problem. For romance, he has to wait at least for a year, but I'm pretty sure he didn't try any sexual offense to her in the show no matter what his mother said, and [in Erased final episode](/s "the girl is already 20+.") 

*edit*

That said, I think I know where you're coming from, and we had a bit of discussion on it before, hadn't we? So, yeah, thanks for reminding me that!
>> ARTICLE
Some group of characters will be talking about someone else, and at some point the camera will cut away to that character and they'll sneeze, before the camera cuts back to the original discussion.

This one is pretty common in anime, and almost never explained (though you can figure it out after a few times).
>> ARTICLE
Oh right, so "sneeze" = "someone is talking about you" is often not clearly understood until you get used to it? I was expecting this "myth" was rather popular elsewhere! Maybe I should ask about this in askreddit or somewhere else. Thanks. 
>> ARTICLE
I've never encountered the notion outside of anime, so I don't believe it exists in the west.

Actually, I just did a bit of googling, and found this on the wiki page for 'sneeze':
> In certain parts of Eastern Asia, particularly in Chinese culture, Korean culture, Japanese culture and Vietnamese culture, a sneeze without an obvious cause was generally perceived as a sign that someone was talking about the sneezer at that very moment. This can be seen in the Book of Songs (a collection of Chinese poems)^[12] in ancient China as early as 1000 BC, and this belief is still depicted in present-day manga and anime. 
>> ARTICLE
That wiki page also lists many more and looks like it's basically a sign of something. Maybe not "being talked about", but does your culture have any kind of signs or whatever implied/foreshadowed by "sneeze"?
>> ARTICLE
Not to my knowledge. The wiki page suggests that sneezing was associated with loss of life in Europe (whence my culture derives), but I don't think any of that association survives.
>> ARTICLE
That's interesting. Thanks. May I ask where you're from?

The number 4 is pronounced the same as death in chinese and japanese making it an unlucky number in asian culture. Showing this number can usually foreshadow a death or deadly situation.

Thanks. I thought recent anime don't really use the unlucky number concept (like 4 or 9) as signs or metaphors as often as before. In what animes have you seen this from?
>> ARTICLE
This season, Active Raid. Unit 8's Willwear squad goes from Oscar I - III and then Oscar V - VI.

There is no Oscar IV. The anime never says why and the topic never comes up. So to answer your question, it appears to still be present but it is rather subtle. Full disclosure: I am Chinese-Indonesian and live in California and I understood that  =  immediately on a subconscious level.

I will say this does illustrate the recency bias people have. Statistically speaking, what are the odds that the last two seasons have produced 3 of the Top 10? Even when you consider that most people don't watch anime older than 10 years old, unless it's a classic (NGE, Bebop, Utena, GitS, original Gundam for example) this does seem pretty skewed. 

In my experience, it might be because people have a tendency to rate airing anime against each other, rather than against their whole list. I know I've had to adjust scores after considering my own tendency to do this. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't call 00 "original Gundam".  While it's definitely no G Reco or Iron Blooded Orphans, it's not as old as Zeta or anything that age.  Most of the alternate era series have a similar feel to em, like 00, Seed, and current stuff, than the original Universal Century stuff does. 
>> ARTICLE
On the contrary, I'd argue that it's because the popularity of anime makes it so that recent shows get bigger budgets.  The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

There's also the matter that recent shows are likely to be more in line with the tastes of a modern viewer.

These, and various other reasons, are why recent shows tend to get better reviews than older ones.
>> ARTICLE
>The advances in art style, music, and voice acting probably also help.

The voice acting and music are as good as they've always been, or at least since late 80s. As for the art, I think that in 2005-2008 the studios have mastered digital production and can produce steady high quality animation unless they rush things or cut the budget.

>> ARTICLE
Good points, though I'd argue that English dubs are still improving and have still got a long way to go compared to Japanese VAs.

OSTs have been getting better though - if only because the budgets are bigger.
>> ARTICLE
I think the recency bias has more to it than people just snubbing older series though

1) Older series are just harder to come by on the streaming services. Even if they are on there, you have to really dig through all the recent series to get there. Streaming services tend to push their Simulcasts to justify their licensing expenses

2) Anime crowd skews young. People watch anime of their age before earlier ones. I watched anime from 1995-1999. It wasn't until 2011 that I caught up to things from the 80s and 70s (though I did watch Mazinger-Z and Voltes V in the 90s). 

3) People who HAVE seen those might have moved on to something else in their life, and thus are never really around to mention it enough in today's anime communities, because while they were good, there just wasn't *enough* about them to talk about for 10-20 years. *Pivotal* series like NGE and Cowboy Bebop have been talked about and dissected for so long, particularly in the West, they're just ingrained in the community's collective memory. 

Other series just don't have the same staying power, unless they're a genre defining series. 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu? Meanwhile, how many people will still be talking about Madoka, K-On, Monogatari, and JoJo? Now think about how many Shirobakos, Syokugekis, and Shigatsus there have been in the 20 years since 1995, and have since been forgotten. That contributes *immensely* to recency bias. 
>> ARTICLE
> 10 years from now, will people still be recommending Shirobako, Syokugeki, and Shigatsu?

Not sure about Syokugeki, but the other two yes absolutely. Shigatsu will at least have the staying power of Anohana (5 years) or Angel Beats! (6 years).

Or possibly because people have rubbish rating scales and don't actually care about the numbers they slap on.
>> ARTICLE
But of course you, with your omnipotent, perfectly refined taste, would never do such a thing. /s 

Elitism much? 
>> ARTICLE
No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale. I've seen /u/JexInfinite 's opinion parroted many times in this subreddit, no idea where you're getting the "elitism" claim from.
>> ARTICLE
> No, most people actually do rate mostly in the 7-10 range. That's pretty much a rubbish rating scale if there is one, because you're barely using the entire scale.

Its not just people. The entire rating industry had moved toward a 6/7-10 rating scale. 6 these days means terrible, 7 average, 8 good, 9 great, 10 fantastic.

Its just normal. You looking at almost all game or movie ratings, they conform to the warped rating scale. Its just how it is. I think it ultimately came from the academic grading system, where a 50% is a fail, so anything under 5/10 is meaningless.

There is really no point complaining about people using the most common system of rating. 
>> ARTICLE
I vote on a binary "Did I enjoy it or not?" scale.  either an anime gets a 10 or a 1.  
>> ARTICLE
Those people typically are the people less experienced in anime tend to gravitate heavily towards the popular or new shows and slap high numbers on everything because they haven't seen much else and it's all unique and new

This is probably seen in practice by me personally with Gundam 00 vs. Code Geass. Both very similar in quality and plot from the same age, from the same studio. I enjoyed Gundam a lot more but they're two shows in practice which I would see having almost the same score if they were equally popular

But most of the people who've seen 10 shows and given 10 to all of them have seen Code Geass due to popularity and being recommended everywhere. Most of these haven't watched or heard much of Gundam so it has a far fairer score
>> ARTICLE
I've heard of gundam all my life, but it was only after I came to /r/anime that I first heard of Code Geass - so if anything, I'd argue that the bias would go the other way.

Still, as you say, I honestly still don't see what's so good about Code Geass.
>> ARTICLE
And this is why I don't rate my list at all :\
>> ARTICLE
I don't rate my list either for the most part, but some notable shows I'll put a 9 or 10 for reference

[Maybe they don't know they can vote less than 5 yet.](http://www.animemaru.com/myanimelist-scores-dramatically-decrease-as-users-realize-they-can-give-scores-lower-than-5/)

I think that's more a result of people not watching anime they know are going to be trash. If something doesn't warrant even a 5 from the people who've already watched it, it's hardly going to garner much viewership from everyone else.
>> ARTICLE
I rate everything I watch a 10, so I'm part of the problem.
>> ARTICLE
There are a lot of snobby edgelords on this sub who think you're a scrub if you have an average score over 6. Pay them no mind. If you like something, score it whatever the hell you want. 

Just keep in mind how good you think it is compared to ALL the shows you've seen, not just the recent ones. 
>> ARTICLE
Average score means nothing if you don't know what shows they rate. Some people only watch good shows. You're suggesting that scores be on a bell curve, but I deny this. If a show is good, it is good. The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.
>> ARTICLE
I rate on a bell curve, but the curve is centred around 7.5. Most shows on my list is rated 7 or 8. I simply try to avoid shows if before watching I feel that there's no chance for me to rate the show 8. Life is too short to watch mediocre anime (or read mediocre books, or watch mediocre movies, or play mediocre games), so I don't even bother.
>> ARTICLE
My MAL graph just coincidentally happens to be somewhat resembling of a bell curve, but I would never intentionally adjust the score to fit with everything else. I look at each individual show/movie as its own thing when rating.
>> ARTICLE
> The existence of a better show doesn't make it any less good.

This is why I kept my "10" rating for Attack on Titan even after seeing much better shows. I just love it.
>> ARTICLE
Yes it does, the point of 10 point systems is for it to be relative to other entries 
>> ARTICLE
> Some people only watch good shows.

Yeah, this is sort of the justification I give for rating 10 across the board. I pick what I watch very carefully so that I know I'll enjoy whatever I invest my time in.
>> ARTICLE
So, you've either seen up to 15 shows, or are really generous with scores.
>> ARTICLE
Nah, I'm just easy to please. Then again, I've seen no more then 60 shows so I haven't consumed anywhere near as much as material as the average MAL user.
>> ARTICLE
yes, this. Plus from what I've seen from over 20 years of watching, anime *has* gotten better. It'd be dumb to normalize your score to the "average" anime when that average keeps going up every year. 

Instead, I normalize mine to the status quo of being bored. If an anime entertains me even a little bit, it gets a 6. If it makes me feel like I wasted my time, it gets 4 or below. I rarely finish shows that are 5 or below. 

PLUS, people by and large operate based off of recommendations. Essentially normalizing to the average *of what you've seen* is just grading how accurate people's recommendations were to you, which is counter to the spirit of ratings. 

Grading on a bell curve will make sense *only* if you select your anime to watch randomly.
>> ARTICLE
Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is a fantastic show because of how it did something completely new. It created several character archetypes which didn't previously exist. Just because those archetypes are now overused and everywhere, it doesn't diminish the value of how they originally affected the industry.

Akira is another example of something that was ahead of its time, but isn't necessary up to today's standard of quality. (I would argue that it absolutely is, but that's beside the point.)
>> ARTICLE
Technically, NGE didn't create archetypes, it just morphed them slightly and made tsundere/kuudere (Asuka vs Rei) more popular. 
>> ARTICLE
Less popular shows get less views, which means less ratings, which means less popularity. It's a loop.

Then there are people like me who just don't have time to watch terrible shows and just stick with what're regarded as "good" shows. What happens then is that my ratings get inflated because I don't watch enough bad shows.

OP plz
>> ARTICLE
Rakugo in the Top 10. NICE. 
>> ARTICLE
Well deserved too
>> ARTICLE
I haven't seen it, but it's probably a lot more deserving than Erased and OPM.
>> ARTICLE
It's the only one out of those three that could be in a realistic anime top 100, so yes it's worth watching.
>> ARTICLE
Much more than Erased for sure (I enjoyed it, but it's ranking is way inflated right now). Also get on that!
>> ARTICLE
Wow, this is why MAL makes me sad. You have Gundam 00 but no 08th MS team nor war in the pocket nor unicorn!? 

And only about 6 or 7 shows before 2000 on the list. To be fair older shows do tend to be longer, however there are plenty of shows before 2000 below 26 episodes that arebetter than the likes of gate and no game no life (which is inexplicably at no. 22).

Also the fact that Gunbuster isn't on the list is really sad, that show has probably the best ending of all time (I cry every time the colour hits in!)

Well atleast ping pong, tatami galaxy, and rainbow are high up.
>> ARTICLE
I could think of a bunch of anime that if they came out in the last year would be much higher on this list. Outlaw star, The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, and GTO arn't even on here. Explain that. 08th ms team and pocket are two anime classics probably best in the entire Gundam universe. Im sure im leaving a bunch of quality anime from the 90s and 80s that are 10x better than some of the shows on this list.

>> ARTICLE
Jesus! Those three aren't on the list? I just assumed they were when I scanned it! See this is why I don't trust people...
>> ARTICLE
GTO is 43 episodes and currently ranked 28th on MAL.

>> ARTICLE
yeah I was mistaken on that, I edited it out and replaced it. Such a good anime thought it was much shorter than that.
>> ARTICLE
Isn't diebuster the sequel to gunbuster?
>> ARTICLE
Why is that relevant? 
>> ARTICLE
I misremembered the number of episodes in each series. I, for some reason, was under the impression that they were both longer, and adding them together would push it above 25
>> ARTICLE
Yes and no.  Same universe different characters. 
>> ARTICLE
> Wow, this is why MAL makes me sad. You have Gundam 00 but no 08th MS team nor war in the pocket nor unicorn!? 

Could be worse.

*stares at every Animebracket contest from /r/anime where Gundam keeps getting snubbed again and again*
>> ARTICLE
Unicorn is rated way higher than 00 and 08th MS Team is pretty close, they just aren't on this list due to OP's weird-ass criteria. They both fit easily into less than 2 cours, he probably just doesn't know exactly how entries of UC Gundam relate to each other and considers it a continuous story, so he only included AUs when making this.
>> ARTICLE
Gundam 00 needs to be removed from this list as it has 2 seasons of 2 cours each.

Though Build Fighters and Build Fighters Try might exploit the rule 2 loophole tho...
>> ARTICLE
I think Kill la Kill deserves better than 58^th.
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill. Huh, I must have missed Gurren Lagann....

*re-reads three times*

He hasn't watched Gurren Lagann.  
>> ARTICLE
And I think Sakurasou should not be on that list at all. But what can you do with essentially a popularity list.
>> ARTICLE
how is kill la kill not better than zankyou no terror man... 

[](#torrentialdownpour)
>> ARTICLE
I still don't get how there's such a gap between Gurren Lagann and KLK on MAL....
>> ARTICLE
KLK only has boobs

Gurrenn Lagann has boobs AND giant robots.

Also I have to feel that an adolescent male protagonist is more relatable to the target audience of both series than a snarky female. 
>> ARTICLE
Kill la Kill has a *lot* of boobs, though.
>> ARTICLE
I think it's also part of the Gainax bias...though I agree Gurren Lagann was better crafted & planned out story-wise, Kill La Kill was more enjoyable and the ending=far less a base-breaker with the fans.
>> ARTICLE
Regardless of relative quality, you can't deny that Gurren Lagann is much more approachable to a wide audience than KLK. I feel like that has to be part of it. I also feel that Gurren Lagann was just plain better, for action, themes, and characters. (This isn't an insult to Kill La Kill. I *love* Kill La Kill)
>> ARTICLE
No Outlaw star, Gundam 08th MS team, Gundam war in the pocket,  The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, Gurren Lagann, and Gunbuster all missing from this list. It is funny how skewed toward recency MAL ratings are. 
>> ARTICLE
1) Recent anime are more easily available from streaming services

2) Anime crowd tends to skew young. A lot of people who watched anime, don't anymore

3) hardly anyone mentions those series anymore

There are not many people who would have seen those things you list, and if they have, they probably won't be on MAL now.

People aren't just thumbing their nose at older anime. It's more likely people just don't know about it
>> ARTICLE
Yea I know they arent thumbing there nose, but it is such a shame since there are so many good anime from not that long ago. Movies dont seem to have these issues though on IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes(for the reasons you listed I guess).
>> ARTICLE
well, it's a lot easier to obtain old movies legally than it is to obtain old anime too. Older anime are basically a niche within a niche at this point, and a lot of their distribution rights are held by IP trolls. A better comparison is non-American movies (or movies whose market was never intended to be the American public), and there is absolutely a parallel recency bias there.
>> ARTICLE
Madness, someone else who's watched Captain Tylor?!
>> ARTICLE
Seems there are so few of us these days. One of the funniest anime ever made. 
>> ARTICLE
TTGL didn't make it because it's 27 episodes. OP just couldn't bring themselves to make an exception I guess.

Yea thats a mistake imo since it is only 27 if you count an episode that isnt really an episode(recap).
>> ARTICLE
The real crime is FLCL at 92
>> ARTICLE
Why is One Punch Man so popular? It wasn't that amazingly mind blowing...
>> ARTICLE
recency and hype bias. Just like Erased and Rakugo. Both great shows, but not top 10 material
>> ARTICLE
Did you like Konosuba?
>> ARTICLE
I loved konosuba lol The comedy in that show was some of the best I've seen, although I havn't seen that many comedy shows. I honestly found it way more enjoyable than One Punch in my opinion
>> ARTICLE
Both of them are parody shows with stupid yet funny comedy. But I think opm was better overall. Better story, better comedy and better characters. The only good character that came out of konosuba was Kazuma imo.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah its different for everyone. I just thought the gags/silliness was a lot funnier in konosuba 
>> ARTICLE
OPM has top notch fight scenes with amazing fight direction, an awesome soundtrack, interesting characters, some shounen subversion elements, and most of the comedy was on point. It has almost everything you could want from a light-hearted action series. That's all some people want in a show, so to them it's perfect.
>> ARTICLE
New "twist" on the regular superhero story, cool and likable side characters, competent pacing, interesting setting, great animation & art, good soundtrack, and many people found the comedy to be pretty funny.

It was also a show that I'd say got better as it went along. It started out kinda cool but got more interesting with the Hero Association, got more intense with the Sea King arc, and the Boros fight was the best part of the show and a great finale. I can see why a majority of people would enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I'm not saying I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty enjoyable myself. I just don't see why people give it a 10/10 when the show barely had any story. My friend gave OPM a 10/10 yet FMA Brotherhood an 8... I just don't understand how its a master piece with such a high rating  lol
>> ARTICLE
Seems you're focusing on a pointless rating system.
>> ARTICLE
Well its not really that, its just people calling it a masterpiece like its the greatest thing is what I don't understand. It was good but nothing that made me say damn that was so amazing greatest thing I've ever seen.
>> ARTICLE
That's precisely my point. You're focused on a show rated at a 10 being objectively better than an 8, which really couldn't be further from the truth. The entire rating system is a shitshow precisely because people reduce extremely subjective shows to an extremely objective method of comparing them, and completely ignore what makes them unique.

As far as this specific example, I can see why someone would enjoy OPM so much. Its short, sweet, and just a lot of fun. No fat on the story. good visuals. most importantly, its fun, light entertainment. Its not one of my favourite shows, but I can see why someone enjoys it so much.
>> ARTICLE
FMA is quite a bit different than OPM. It's quite a bit more serious (at most points) and can certainly take on a darker tone in some parts. It's also not trying to be subversive. It's a straight up shounen that takes itself more serious than most and with a much more focused narrative. For some people this makes FMA better, for others it's not as much what they're looking for.
>> ARTICLE
Ratings are subjective and a lot of people just enjoyed the show. I don't think there really needs to be much more than that. IMO not having a big in-depth story isn't an issue if it is still one of the most enjoyable shows I've watched. At the end of the day it just comes down to how people rate things and the easiest way to rate something is by how much you enjoyed watching it.
>> ARTICLE
Rating on enjoyment is so much more subjective than rating the actual show (eg characters, plot, themes, soundtrack, animation).
>> ARTICLE
Obviously, but every rating is going to be subjective anyways. In addition you could have the most well written characters and the best objective quality story in existence, but people may not enjoy it. Personally I find just as much value in a review based purely on how much someone enjoyed something as a review that is trying to be objective. At the end of the day I don't care how good something is if I don't enjoy it, and I don't care how bad something is if I do enjoy it.
>> ARTICLE
I find reviews based on enjoyment to be utterly useless. I can never experience that enjoyment the same way, if at all. What I *can* experience is the characters, plot, soundtrack, etc. Rating and reviewing based on things that are actually in the show rather than how a show made you feel is a lot more logical, and produces scores that have meaning.
>> ARTICLE
But like I said even those things are subjective. Where I see a good character another may see an insufferable twat. Everyone has differing tastes in music, so a soundtrack may be good but still may not be anything you would enjoy. I would think rating the plot would be the easiest to do "objectively", but even then it is usually going to be based on prior experience. When you've watched/read hundreds of shows/books it will be a lot harder to find an original plot that stands out, but for someone without much experience an average or mediocre plot may be amazing.

IMO no review by some random person online is very helpful regardless of the criteria used. A review only becomes truly helpful once you've begun to understand the context the reviewer is looking at the work through. If you have totally different opinions on what constitutes a good character, or anything else, then a reviewer saying that a character is great means nothing to you. Until I understand a reviewer I take their reviews with a huge grain of salt.
>> ARTICLE
Subjective, obviously, but other people are able to witness and experience them. *Nobody* else can experience how the show made you feel, so it's a useless point.
>> ARTICLE
Nobody can tell me for certain how I'm going to feel, but a ton of people can make accurate predictions based on how they felt. If a lot of people think something is sad/funny/enjoyable then I will most likely have the same experience. The whole basis of an averaged score on a site like MAL is that most people will fall in line with the average. If something is rated a 7, regardless of the reasons but as long as those people were as honest as possible, the majority of people will like it but not love it. Maybe you have some particular tastes, but then you can just find a reviewer with tastes more similar to your own. Like on Steam there are curators or, I imagine, the clubs on MAL.

To get back to the original topic of OPM being highly rated, I don't think most people care about an in-depth story. Most people can find plenty of enjoyment in a lacking product, and OPM is executed extremely well in all other aspects. In addition it isn't like it has a bad story - it simply has very little story which I see no problem with. I mean it works for Dark Souls right?
>> ARTICLE
Does your friend rate on personal enjoyment?
>> ARTICLE
Quite clearly, he would. If OPM is higher, it could only be because he enjoyed it more.
>> ARTICLE
When I asked him he just said FMA was "alright" lol
>> ARTICLE
Sounds like it wasn't for him.
>> ARTICLE
Hmm well I think you have to look at it differently. One Punch Man is trying to accomplish different things than FMA. How well does each accomplish what they set out to do? Personally I think OPM does a better job even if FMA has a more ambitious story. More story doesn't automatically make something superior. There are many other aspects to consider. 
>> ARTICLE
The amount of story it had was perfect for the atmosphere the show was trying to create. Not every show has to have super in-depth character backgrounds to be a masterpiece. Dragging out the story would've slowed down the show too much to keep it interesting imo.

At the end of the day it was a really fun show with great music, visuals, comedic timing, and amazing fight scenes. What more do you need?
>> ARTICLE
There was no goal from what I remember with the show? It was just this monster showed up, he goes to fight it. Again I still enjoyed the show I just feel like its way over hyped imo 
>> ARTICLE
IMO part of what makes the show interesting is that the villains are the ones trying to achieve some goal (and get all the power up sequences and other tropey things) instead of Saitama. 
>> ARTICLE
Probably because of the hype. I really like OPM, but I don't think it was a masterpiece as a lot of people claim, the anime was really good and had nice animation, but the best part of the story is still in the webcomics in my opinion.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind
>> ARTICLE
It's almost like people can have their own opinions and whatnot.
>> ARTICLE
While I can't say I'd give OPM anything above 9 I can easily see why FMA:B would get 8. It's somewhat too long for the story it's telling and has its share of shonen tropes. They're not bad per se, but it's not the masterpiece of deep writing as well.
>> ARTICLE
For me random comedy scenes killed FMA and also Brotherhood . OPM was solid and honestly fun story not the best but worth watching .

Also I think that about  half of shows on this list are overhyped but my it's just my opinion . Maybe it's becouse I like SoL , Drama and Fantasy stories more
>> ARTICLE
eh, the random comedy scenes brought FMA down to earth for me. It's just that FMA had less of those than FMA:B because of the shorter run...
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah I liked the show and thought it was a fun watch but it barely had any story from what I saw.. I don't see how people give it a 10/10 masterpiece. Example my friend gave OPM a 10 while FMA brotherhood only got an 8. Blows my mind

A show doesn't need to have a story if it's not necessary. In OPM having a continuous narrative wasn't necessary since it was a gag comedy.
>> ARTICLE
that would all good if it was actually funny.  Unfortunately it was all too happy making the same joke over and over.
>> ARTICLE
OPM didn't literally have only one single joke. Yes it had the overlying "one punch" gag but it was used in many different ways, sometimes as a joke and sometimes for a serious moment. Overall the show also had a variety of comedy moments that didn't center around Saitama's gag.
>> ARTICLE
ok, list some examples of other kind of gags.  Maybe I'm missing something, but almost all the gags are just people/villains looking down on the MC, who beats the villain effortlessly.  
>> ARTICLE
[OPM spoilers](/s "In the episode where Saitama and Genos were infiltrating the evil doctors lair, he set traps on every floor in preparation for their arrival. Instead of following the standard "clear the dungeon to the boss" trope Genos just instantly blows up the entire building and they enter the basement from there. This was funny because the viewer wouldn't expect this and it subverts the trope.")

[OPM spoilers](/s "After the "robotic monkey" is defeated he is acting like a hardened badass minion and gives the whole "you'll never defeat X" speech. Once he learns that they were actually defeated he drops the robotic voice and takes on a whole different persona asking to be spared. He says that the robotic voice and attitude was him just trying to sound cool. This is funny because it was unexpected at the time and surprises the viewer.")

I could keep going and pull out every single one liner from every single episode that either got a chuckle or an outloud laugh from me but I think you see the point. Every episode didn't have 20 minutes of nothing happening until one single joke about a single punch was pulled at the end. The episodes were lined with small to larger jokes derived from the characters speeches, interactions among each other, and actions in the world they were in which all worked together and created the overall comedic tone/atmosphere of the show.
>> ARTICLE
that's just another variation of the same "Saitama is too powerful" gag, the other being an example of "villains acting all arrogant until they are put in their place by Saitama, who is too powerful" gag
>> ARTICLE
I get the feeling you don't really want to be proven wrong. 

Look at his first example, how does that fall under the "single gag" at all? Second example, doesn't fall under the "single gag" either.

These examples are pretty far from the "saitama too strong" gag, so unless you are unfamiliar with the references, its likely pretty clear to most that this isn't a single gag show
>> ARTICLE
And as a variation they're different, they're unique with the characters interacting in different ways which isn't boring or uninteresting for the viewer. 
>> ARTICLE
[Saitama's impatience when it comes to monologuing](http://40.media.tumblr.com/7d6f2f56643914b392c1d249aa7f8ea5/tumblr_nwpsrfFOUb1u77epio1_500.jpg), and his [lackadaisical attitude](http://i.imgur.com/zdAJyD1.jpg) are two examples of gags in the show that isn't just the one punch gag. Genos constantly getting turned to modern art, the weird backstories for each villain, the strange character designs for each villain (I mean fucking look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/JJzfkFL.png) or [this](http://i.imgur.com/5qG4z0B.jpg)), [or even just the absurdity of certain situations in the show.](http://gfycat.com/PoshHelpfulIberianbarbel)

On the whole, the comedic situations he's placed in make [Saitama a](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/3wwk6k/anime_irl/?) [very](http://i.imgur.com/8GtTdCl.jpg) [relatable character](https://i.imgur.com/ixk3nTm.jpg) with the added bonus of just being hilarious in general. This is why I can't quite understand why people say the show only has the One Punch gag, it's a comedy with a varied arsenal of jokes to tell, yet for some reason people just say "LEL ONE GAG MAN".
>> ARTICLE
> monologuing

That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.  

>lackadaisical attitude

If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too.  What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.


> modern art

don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

> LEL ONE GAG MAN

personally, I would go with One Punchline Man
>> ARTICLE
I don't know why I tried to give examples, you're actively trying to not have fun with the anime, and that's why the comedy doesn't work with you.

>That part was painful to listen to, so the impatience is a pretty natural reaction.

Not with most other characters in any fictional media. Most would listen to the long backstory without saying a word, so no, I wouldn't quite say it's a "natural reaction".

>If I was the strongest person in the universe I would be very unimpressed too. What's more, every villain acts arrogantly like that, so I don't see how his reaction is anything noteworthy.

Again, the point is that this is abnormal for a main character of a show. Does Superman act like that? No. To give a currently airing show as an example, does All-Mighty act like that? No. These are the characters Saitama is parodying because they're so common, and his character type as MC is so uncommon. See, this is what I mean by the fact that you're actively fighting against this anime tooth and nail in order to not have fun with it. Everyone else sees Saitama as unique and funny, yet you're sitting over here trying to jump through mental hoops to see him as this normal character that is totally obvious to write as the MC of a superhero show.

>don't see what's funny about a good guy being almost destroyed every time, even less so when it happens every time

"Oh my god, they killed Kenny!" ~ Line from a TV show that made millions laugh all around the world.

You don't even bother acknowledging anything else I mentioned, so what was the point in responding?
>> ARTICLE
tbh, the fact that it was nothing but a gag comedy for the first 5 episodes made me question where the hype is coming from. I mean yeah, it was hilarious, but it was the anime equivalent of Chocolate Mint flavor ice cream: you don't get it too often, it's pretty good, but ultimately nothing to be excited about.

The last 7 episodes though, made me think "oh, this was what manga readers were hyping it up for"

Still though, I have to think a fair bit of that was casual anime-only people just parroting the manga hype. 
>> ARTICLE
Seconded. I personally think that OPM stands out from the current arc being covered by the manga 'til the end of that arc in the webcomic. [OPM end of latest finished webcomic arc spoilers](/s "Sweet Mask obsessing over Saitama's power after thrashing Garou gave me chills. That, and whenever he shows up with his High Rank Harem.")
>> ARTICLE
I don't think most people claim it as a masterpiece, it was just a really fun show with a good "hype" factor.
>> ARTICLE
Maybe not in anime communities, but people who don't watch much anime tend to overhype it a lot (look at its IMDB rating).
>> ARTICLE
it's because it's the "not anime anime". People who saw DBZ and thought it was dumb come to this and say "OH MY GOD, IT'S SO AMAZING".

I'm not sure I would have NGE on this list since EoE is more or less required watching.

For me it was hard to convince myself to watch it, but when I did, I loved it.  It was a pretty weird experience, that's never happened to me before, but I would definitely recommend watching it.

But what about the culture aspect of the show? Because i dont know jack about the stage comedy storytelling aspect of the show.
>> ARTICLE
Mmm honestly it doesn't really matter. All the stories are self contained, so if there is additional backstory to it, it's not really necessary.  The important parts of the show are generally not the actual performances, and that's where the gold is. The stories are good, but the characters make it great.

You know, that art looked pretty fantastic for being studio Deen.
>> ARTICLE
Seriously. I was shocked when I saw who was making it.
>> ARTICLE
The meme about Deen's production quality being bad is overblown, they have quite a few well animated series and are almost never below average. 
>> ARTICLE
Have you seen Sankarea? It looks great.

Hakuouki looked good as well. Deen can make good-looking anime at times.
>> ARTICLE
Nice ost.
>> ARTICLE
Looks classy as hell. Now I'm thinking that this show could be the dark horse of the Winter season.
>> ARTICLE
Zura ja nai!
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen Baby Steps here. Not surprised to see it here really, absolutely fantastic show that I've seen no one talk about. I only found out about ita month or two ago, and finally watched it this past week. Definitely worth checking out! 

ps. Baby Steps OP is one of the greatest OP's in existence.
>> ARTICLE
Haikyuu got me into the sports anime fully. Tried Baby Steps for a couple episodes, then went full on binge through. I hope for another season.
>> ARTICLE
The thing I generally dislike about sports anime is that it's a complete sausage fest with the technical aspects of the sport and ocassionally the interpersonal relationships of the teammates being the only themes that are handled, usually over a very stretched out low paced episode list.

Baby Steps has that typical sports aspect, sure, but it also has a romantical aspect (even though it's not as fleshed out as I wanted it to be). Cross Game is the only other sports anime I know to handle those themes.
>> ARTICLE
Baby Steps is fantastic. The character growth/development reminds me a bit of the baseball anime Major. 
>> ARTICLE
Check out Cross Game is you want a good baseball show. I'm only on episode 30ish and loving it so far. 
>> ARTICLE
> a good **baseball** show

haha
>> ARTICLE
Its less about baseball and more about relationships. Major is also very good in both the sports and drama department.
>> ARTICLE
cross game is really fucking good. more SoL than sports, but the games are fun to watch and baseball fans will be satisfied. 

due to one major plot device, its kinda similar to AnoHana , but no melodrama. the characters' emotions and traits are realistic to that off a teenager. 

also first episode is one hell of a hook so prepare for binge watch if you plan on watching.
>> ARTICLE
How is it compared to ace of diamond?
>> ARTICLE
I completely agree! It's one of my favorite character driven shows.

Also there might be a rewatch this summer if enough people are interested in picking up the show or just rewatching it for fun.

It's a great Summertime anime and I hope y'all can join us.
>> ARTICLE
Aside from one of the plot devices, the anime doesn't remotely resemble AnoHana. Anyone looking for a similar experience will be disappointed. Not that anyone could be disappointed after watching Cross Game, of course.
>> ARTICLE
yeah i was really cautious about not wanting to spoil said plot device... edited my post so i dont mislead anyone.
>> ARTICLE
Well the issue is finding a good comparison for Cross Game. Because there really is no good comparison. It's such a unique story.

If I had to choose one it would obviously be Touch but that's practically cheating because the same dude wrote it.
>> ARTICLE
It's unique.....until you start reading literally anything Adachi made. This guy takes 'write what you know' to a crazy extreme.
>> ARTICLE
You *know* The Boy and the Beast only makes this list because there's practically no way to watch it outside of Japan yet. Once there is, it'll shoot up the MAL charts.
>> ARTICLE
Eh, I should check it out. Apparently it just released here in France, it seems one of the theaters in my city's running it.
>> ARTICLE
Awww man after going through the list that was my number one choice of show to watch next. And now I can't :( 
>> ARTICLE
Has this only been released in theaters so far?
>> ARTICLE
I believe so.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm aware, and it's also the same for The Anthem of the Heart. Popularity takes into account those who have it in their PTW as well though. It might not end up as popular as you make out to be. This list also features 3 Ghibli movies (From Up on Poppy Hill, Princess Kaguya and Marnie) for instance, so you never know.

I'm looking forward to it for sure though.
>> ARTICLE
Judging by The Girl Who Leapt Through Time at popularity spot #108, Summer Wars at #161, and Wolf Children at #210, I can't help but be sure that The Boy and the Beast is going to end up being pretty popular. The more famous Ghibli works are *classics*, but Mamoru Hosoda is pretty modern in comparison.

PS I'm also super excited for The Anthem of the Heart, too!
>> ARTICLE
Anthem of the Heart is really good imo. Saw it a week ago here in Hamburg. I liked it even more than Anohana.
>> ARTICLE
:o
>> ARTICLE
The Beast Player Erin looks like it is going to be a kid's show but don't let the art style fool you. It can be a little slow at times but there are not many characters as well developed as Erin.
>> ARTICLE
I'll ask the same question as recent threads:

How many of these have watched?

And another probably funnier in this occasion:

How many of these have you never heard about?

I'm at a surprising 31 watched and 25 I'd never heard about.
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen 6 of those, and am currently watching Gundam IBO.

I haven't seen a ton of anime, but I've seen a decent amount. I haven't ever heard of a lot of those, so like others have said, when I'm not sure what to watch next, it's good to know there's plenty to check out.
>> ARTICLE
I've only watched 10 of them.

Glad to know that even if I run out of the usual recs to watch, there's an entire new world of good anime to enjoy waiting for me, personally.

Also, is the Dog of Flanders, not God of Flanders.

As to how many I've heard of: I've heard of Chi's Sweet Home exactly once on a MAL recommendation for fans of NGE, citing that both shows' main character is a pussy.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks, I fixed that.

I've unsurprisingly never seen Chi's Sweet Home mentioned here myself, but I've come across it randomly I think by episode count. At least they're only 3 minutes long.
>> ARTICLE
39/100  Not even half. ;_;
>> ARTICLE
Only 5. Looking forward to watching some of these.
>> ARTICLE
16, all of which I'm sad they aren't watched more


>> ARTICLE
Watched 16, all of the mecha shows on the list plus some others.
>> ARTICLE
> How many of these have watched?

I've watched Kuuchuu Buranko

> How many of these have you never heard about?

About slightly more than half
>> ARTICLE
I've watched 4 (Cross game, gunbuster, giant robo, keroro gunsou) and am currently watching 3 (Shouwa genroku rakugo shoujo, Gundam IBO, Gundam 0079)

If you don't count airing shows then I've only watched 5 :(

I've heard of a lot of these and I'll probably watch Kuchuu Buranko and Armoured Trooper Votoms sometime soon.
>> ARTICLE
Sure they count, though they might not be featured on this list by the end of the season.

I don't follow airing shows myself, but I'm absolutely looking forward to watching Shouwa at the end of the season.
>> ARTICLE
The other baseball anime on this list: Big Windup! and Major are also excellent. And the tennis anime Baby Steps. 
>> ARTICLE
Most I haven't heard of, but some I have. 

I have seen: Cross Game, Major, Big Windup!, Baby Steps (not sure how these aren't in the top 1000... doesn't make any sense. They're great. Major should be in the top 20 anime.) 

Also have seen Magic Kaito, Fist of the North Star.. and my gf likes Chi's Sweet Home. Anything cat related and she'll watch it. 
>> ARTICLE
23, though as often with lists of this sort it's reminded me of a bunch of other things I ought to get round to trying.
>> ARTICLE
I've seen 14 of them, mostly just the sports series.

And then there's only 10 I haven't heard of.
>> ARTICLE
0/100 :/
>> ARTICLE
[it's never too late](#nuidideverythingright)
>> ARTICLE
Watched 1: interstellar 5555 just because I love daft punk and heard of 3
>> ARTICLE
That's one entry I was surprised to find on MAL when I stumbled upon it a while ago. I've seen it but never added it for some reason.
>> ARTICLE
yeah i just looked at my list and done have it either for whatever reason, i guess maybe i thought of it just as a music video but not anime.

gonna add it now though.
>> ARTICLE
I've only seen House of Five Leaves. It's definitely in my top 5 all-time favorites
>> ARTICLE
House of Five Leaves is an amazing character study. Its direction, atmosphere, and pacing are so representative of Tomomi Mochizuki's style. It's probably in my top five favorites as well.
>> ARTICLE
> Ashita no Joe

Has ANYBODY else seen this anime? Specifically the sequel, given it finished the story. I can't find anybody to discuss it with given it's decades old. The last half of the second series was fucking heartbreaking in a way I've never seen any other anime do. 
>> ARTICLE
Is it good? I tried watching it and had to drop it after 10 or so episodes because it seemed way too childish of an anime to me. I love sports anime and boxing anime like Hajime no Ippo so I thought I'd love it but it didn't really do anything with the boxing in the episodes I watched.
>> ARTICLE
It's a very slow burner. The first half is very dated. After a certain fight you can move onto Ashita no Joe 2, the last half of 1 is filler. The ending is incredibly iconic for most anime and manga today. 
>> ARTICLE
1,757 people have finished the second season according to MAL. You're gonna have a rough time finding someone else that's seen it.
>> ARTICLE
>it's decades old.

Can't spend to much time in the past always gotta be facing tomorrow, the gloves are in our hands now.
>> ARTICLE
[This](https://theindiantenor.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/wpid-img-20150411-wa00431.jpg) is iconic.

[It](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gurennlagann/images/7/76/Kamina_as_he_dies.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140922030155) gets referenced [everywhere](http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbiudkaFZD1qgio6io1_1280.jpg).

Yet there are so few who know the reference. This show did a lot for the future of anime. After the success the industry started to make more sports anime and continued to grow the industry. Also a lot of great characters were spawned. Guys like Kamina are litterally Ashita no Joe. I'm sad yesterday's Joe is being forgotten but that ending really motivates me to look forward to the future.
>> ARTICLE
you'll probably find people on /a/
>> ARTICLE
I'd suggest anyone who hasn't seen Yamato 2199 to watch it. It's a really good remake of an iconic classic anime and it's one of the best space anime out there. It's also action driven and a lot shorter if you can't sit through LotGH (which is dialogue driven).

Also anyone who's interested in [Kingdom](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12031/Kingdom?q=kingdo) should go read the manga. There is 460 chapters and is one of the best manga out there.
>> ARTICLE
Yamato 2199 is not for everyone.

Space Operas in general are not for everyone. People who love them absolutely love them. However there a lot of people who get bored of them. Same thing with Star Trek. Most people agree that it's a great well executed series however there aren't a lot of diehard fans because people easily get bored of it.

This is why a lot of the Space Opera anime have high scores relative to popularity. Same with LotGH. It's the only anime inside of the top 50 in popularity that is outside of top 500 in popularity. (Sequels don't count.)

And yeah Kingdom anime isn't bad but I also think the manga is just great.
>> ARTICLE
I couldnt stand the art of Kingdom D: , the story might be amazing but if i can barely read through the first 10 chapters...
>> ARTICLE
I felt that way about the anime.  Watched the first episode and dropped it.  Reminded me a lot of Knights of Sidonia - really generic, boring 3D that tries to be too realistic instead of being stylistic.
>> ARTICLE
I think Yamato 2199 is just a terrible shonen that happens to be in space, but to each his own.

The Kingdom manga is truly amazing, though. As much as I like the anime, the technology to adapt an epic of Kingdom's scale simply isn't there yet.
>> ARTICLE
I agree with you on Yamato 2199. I forced myself through around 20 episodes after reading about how amazing it was on reddit, but I didn't get attached at all. Couldn't find myself interested in any of the main characters, the antagonists except for that good-looking alien (introduced around half way through) were all one-dimensional "bad guys," and the plot was only pushed forward by melodrama. What I mean is it's just a series of crises that the cast has to respond to for survival. Any mistakes along the way result in their extinction, so obviously they succeed every time. Extinction plot devices work for shows like Battlestar Galactica or Star Trek, but it didn't grip me in this anime because actor/character reactions to stimuli weren't as good. In Yamato 2199, I just felt like "okay they solved this crisis, I hope the next one is more gripping" but I was let down every time. 

Legend of Galactic Heroes is one anime that does it right. Every roadblock a main character encounters gives the viewer a few minutes of how it's affecting them internally, and we hear parts of this internal monologue as the character tries to solve the problem. There are two sides (both of which, or alternatively none of which can be considered "good guys") that have a multitude of characters. For any given conflict you do not know whether or not the character will succeed, because it's not necessary for them to live for the plot to push forward. 

If you put all the main characters in one ship, like in Yamato 2199, the biggest conflicts to explore that don't involve extinction are power struggles. There was one short arc with a power struggle in Yamato 2199, but the instigators of it were so laughably "evil" and incompetent that you know the main character's side wins. If someone has watched Battlestar Galactica, they'll know what I mean by a well done power struggle, and I don't want to spoil anything.

I suppose Yamato 2199 is good for someone who wants a very light space opera in an anime medium. 
>> ARTICLE
I don't think Yamato is more immature than Star Wars or new Star Trek movies and it doesn't look much worse than them either.
>> ARTICLE
I'm curious as to why this show gets such polarized responses. I watched it and thought it was good but nothing extraordinary, but most people either gush over it or call it overrated and mediocre.
>> ARTICLE
The anime somewhat toned down the manga quite a bit. It took a seinen with shonen elements and made it a full-on shonen.
>> ARTICLE
probably because the manga is so amazing
>> ARTICLE
	

For me, it was very pretty and fun but story-wise left a little to be desired
>> ARTICLE
Surprised no one's mentioned Major. Probably my favorite sports anime. Re-watched all six seasons twice. Would definitely recommend it!
>> ARTICLE
I always try to bring it up on here, but no one seems to have seen it. Its lack of popularity is a bit unfortunate, to be honest.
>> ARTICLE
Polar Bear Cafe is one of my favorite animes of all time.  People laugh at how ridiculous the premise is and don't really take it seriously, as a show.  However, once you accept the overall theme, it's a humorous slice of life that has a lot of heart.
>> ARTICLE
I love it, it's a great relaxing show!
>> ARTICLE
i only saw yamato but its the top of the list so its cool =)
>> ARTICLE
Still a shame "Birdy the Mighty" never makes these lists. It has to be one of the best shows I've seen get ranked so low. 

Second season would've made this list (besides the rule disregarding second seasons) but it's still a heavy recommend from me. 

Shit even the Man of Steel movie borrowed fight scenes from the show almost exactly... It's a good ass show. 
>> ARTICLE
Which Birdy the Mighty? The original or the new one Decode? I assume you mean the latter as the original is generally forgotten (unfortunately).
>> ARTICLE
Sorry, definitely Decode, the actual 26 episode series. 
>> ARTICLE
Tekkon Kinkreet is really good, the manga author also did Ping Pong 
>> ARTICLE
Blue Spring is another movie based on his work, but live-action.
>> ARTICLE
The only one I believe I've seen on the list is Kaiba.  
For those of you who haven't seen it, you really should. You're doing yourself quite a disservice if you don't give it a shot because of how it looks.
>> ARTICLE
Haha, and Kaiba is only here because it was pushed back by new shows this season, sitting proudly at rank 1005. I really like the exploration, kind of slice of life element of the first half of the show.
>> ARTICLE
What is popularity and hows it calced?
>> ARTICLE
It's based on MyAnimeList's popularity statistic. Whenever someone has an anime on their list, whether it be Completed, Dropped or Plan To Watch, they count as a member for the purpose of popularity. To make this list, I went through the top rated anime ignoring the 1000 most popular anime. I should've made this more clear.
>> ARTICLE
Im really surprised though. What about shows like Death note, fma brotherhood, hxh, etc? Those dont have a popularity over 1000?
>> ARTICLE
No, it's the opposite. This list is stripped of the 1000 most popular anime for the purpose of more easily finding good, underwatched anime should you want to.

[Example](http://i.imgur.com/h7JVWBN.png), from [Cross Game](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5941/Cross_Game), where the popularity is above 1000.
>> ARTICLE
Okay I see now. I think saying popularity above 1000 can be misleading then because people interpret that as the 1000 most popular anime. Or people like me anyway.

But thanks for the clarification! 
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I agree. Despite being a MAL regular, the "popularity over 1000" part got me confused at first, until I saw old anime I had checked before and remembering those were NOT popular in the sense nobody had seen/planned to watch them and thus didn't have them on any part of their MAL list.

Maybe [EnduranceProtocol](https://www.reddit.com/user/EnduranceProtocol) could edit the OP and change it to read as "I am limiting this list to anime that are NOT in the top 1000 most popular ranks" or something. Since we're used to having a high number as a positive, seeing "+1000 popularity" made it sound like it's super popular, when in this case the lower means it's higher ranked in the top... Idk lol.
>> ARTICLE
Only watched 2/100, Kingdom and Nobunaga Concerto which 2 of my favorite series 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks OP, I can add a few more anime to my ptw now
>> ARTICLE
Erin is such a good show (the 4th in this list), it's in my top three ever since I watched it the first time, and no show has been able to top it so far. It's just such a fulfilling story.
>> ARTICLE
Surprisingly, "There She Is" can be viewed on Newgrounds.com, a website hosting many flash videos that went viral before YouTube existed. I stumbled upon the first episode while browsing the website within the past year. The art is very simplistic, and there's no dialogue, but it has a very nice and unique story.
>> ARTICLE
That's becauce that's where it was originally submitted. :P

I remember waiting between each episode at the time haha.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised Maison Ikkoku & Rose of Versailles aren't more known. I thought they were as those were broadcasted on French TV for years during the late 80's - 90's and are really nice anime.

By the way, Interstella5555 isn't a real anime, it's a compilation of all the video clips Albator's author made for Daft Punk (a french electro band).

I'm also surprised that Macross (Robotech in the USA) isn't more well known (o_o)'

City Hunter is another CLASSIC that isn't much voted for simply because it's kinda old. I guess I AM really old though (29). Most 2000's kids don't check those oldies anymore I guess... Same goes for Fist of the North Star (Hokkuto no Ken).

Welp, 90% of the list dates back to 2000 or before so yeah. I'm just an old fart I guess lmao.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I know of Interstella5555. [There She Is!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6505/There_She_Is), a Korean fanimation that was submitted to Newgrounds.com back in 2003, and [Furiko](http://myanimelist.net/anime/13629/Furiko), a pretty random short animated after a Muse song, are other outliers on the list.

There might be more I'm unaware of, but either way they're still entries on MAL, so I still included them.

As for Maison Ikkoku and Rose of Versailles, they're already quite old for anime. :P I've personally seen and liked neither haha.
>> ARTICLE
Oh, since you're there, you made a small typo about Galaxy Express 999 (you typed Glaxy Express 999).

But yeah, I don't blame you mate! That list is AWESOME. I know MAL includes almost anything anime related ahah. I remember when I stumbled upon that one back in the day, I had forgotten about it in fact. Just wanted to 'warn' other people to net get fooled by it (^ o ^ )

I didn't like Rose of Versailles since it's not my demo target :p But Maison Ikkoku was pretty cool. But it wasn't my fav either and it's kinda outdated compared to today's productions, that's for sure =/
>> ARTICLE
I'm fairly certain it all has to do with the age of the anime. Despite the fact that Macross, Maison Ikkoku, and Rose of Versailles are seminal anime, the age of them generally turns people off even if they've heard of them. It doesn't help that Macross is basically out of print (excluding the Robotech edit) along with Maison Ikkoku. You can get the first set of episodes of Macross in a Robotech DVD set from Amazon, but not the rest of the season. Rose of Versailles is streaming, but I think that's the only one that is out of those three. Fist of the North Star is on Crunchyroll, but City Hunter isn't.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm a total moron for not foreseeing this issue... It is a shame. But yeah it does absolutely make sense. I'm pretty sure most of those were VHS only things (some did get DVD releases though) which makes it even HARDER to just find them in streaming or anywhere really ... Oh well, I'm glad I got to enjoy them while they got a TV broadcast here at least lol. Thanks for the enlightenment mate!
>> ARTICLE
I'm hoping that Maison Ikkoku gets a nice re-release like Ranma 1/2. I think Viz still has the rights to it (they released it on DVD), but it's been out of print for a while. Similarly, Kimagure Orange Road is out of print (I think the manga is as well). At least the Maison Ikkoku manga is still in print.
>> ARTICLE
Maison Ikkoku and City Hunter are some of my favourite anime of all time. Maison Ikkoku has possibly the best ending of any romance anime I've ever seen and City Hunter is just fucking beautifully done from start to finish and Saeba despite being a massive pervert is an absolute legend. 
>> ARTICLE
Ahah glad to see another fan. I never got to see Maison Ikkoku's ending but I'm glad it was a good one. Most of the romance (main genre or sub genre) anime I've seen in the past years are some form of NTR or cukholding MC who never gets the chick (or vice versa) or only have lame open endings with no hints and no conclusions =/

City Hunter was really awesome. I grew up with it, DBZ & Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle (not an anime but it was a french/usa production). Did you read the pseudo "sequel" from same author, "Angel Hearts" I believe it was called? Never got to try it out though but AFAIK it had some similar vibes, heck IIRC the girl was supposed to be an hospital patient who got a heart operation from Ryo Saeba's girlfriend or something along the lines.
>> ARTICLE
I watched a bit of Angel Hearts but I didn't really like it. Everytime some plot progression was achieved, the next episode it would just forget it ever happened and sort of "reset". I don't think I've ever seen a romance anime with NTR so I'm lucky in that regard. 
>> ARTICLE
Interstellar 5555 was really fun to watching, since I like both anime and Daft Punk. Glad to see it high on this list. Hopefully a few more people will watch it now.
>> ARTICLE
I did watch it (I had long forgotten about it since it was released in early 2000's long before I get to register on MAL) if only because I was a HUGE Daft Punk fan and it does blend SO well with the music...

It reminds me of the old Disney Fantasia movie with classic music. I wanna re-watch Interstella5555 now lol ahah
>> ARTICLE
Crest of the Stars and Banner of the Stars unexpectedly good imo.
>> ARTICLE
Shouldn't [Shin Mazinger Z](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5485/Shin_Mazinger_Shougeki_Z-Hen) be on there? It's not a sequel or anything and it's got a score of 8.00 but a popularity of under 3000.
>> ARTICLE
Seems to be the case. I'd like to say I might have had it confused as a sequel given its title, but I probably overlooked it. :P

Thanks, I won't knock down the current 100th, but I'll add this one in for sure. :)
>> ARTICLE
[Oofuri](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2159/Ookiku_Furikabutte) is a really sweet baseball anime, though you might end up getting annoyed at the MC who has confidence issues up the wazoo. Really catchy second ED. I gave it a 7/10

[Hybrid Child](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11135/Hybrid_Child), while probably not to the taste of most on here, is a pretty decent shounen ai with some heartfelt moments. While just 4 episodes, it does paint a detailed story.  
It's by Studio Deen, so if you've watched any of their other series in this genre, you'll recognise the character designs instantly, with large stocky man being the seme and smaller pointed chin being the uke. Still, in a genre with so few anime it's worth a watch. 7/10

[Wandering Son](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko) is a very mature look at transgender issues, specifically at the age where kids are not particularly empathetic. While I do give credit to faithfully keeping the series serious and sending a good message, it's a pretty slow paced anime and in the first few episodes it was very difficult to know characters by name. 6/10

I think those are the only 3 I've watched, though to be fair to me I've only watched 40 or so anime in my life, not including sequels.
>> ARTICLE
Wow, Tylor is so under rated and watched.
>> ARTICLE
It's on the old side for sure, but that doesn't make it any less great.
>> ARTICLE
Which reminds me that I wanted to up my rating for Princess Kaguya to a 10 and I wanted to watch Romeo and the Black Brothers since a while. And a lot of other stuff on that list.
>> ARTICLE
I've completed or I've come close to completing about 25 or the movies/shorts/series on the list. A few others I started, but dropped at some point. I recognized almost all of them. I feel a strange pride in that, because a year or three ago, that number would be much, much lower.

I'm actually fairly surprised at the quality difference between some of the shows. I've found some to be fantastic and others to be barely above average or even decent. I've never thought the majority of the WMT anime to be particularly good (I feel like their scores are the consequence of nostalgia) and I could barely sit through a few episodes of Hanada Shounen-shi. There's quite a few shows in the list I feel the same about. Others like Conan and Rose or Versailles are totally deserving of their ratings imo, if not deserving of higher.



OP, is there any way could you seperate this into series or series/movies only? All the shorts are kind of misleading.
>> ARTICLE
I've just calculated my average score for the shows on this list. It stands at 6.88 across 25 shows (there are a few I have not rated and one I have dropped) compared to my overall average of 6.37, which is significantly higher. I must say that most of the shows I've watched are pretty recent however, and so might not be as tainted by nostalgia.
>> ARTICLE
Not too surprised with Beast Player Erin.... because I keep raving about it but....

There is a few that I wasn't expecting to be on the list:

**Major** might be a bit more popular in Japan, but didn't expect it up there.

**From Up on Poppy Hill** is a Ghibli Film, I liked it personally, but there are many people that liked other Ghibli films a lot more.

**Saint Seiya: Lost Canvas**.... the whole Saint Seiya series itself is rather unknown to most audiences outside of Japan... if anything, outside of Japan, Brazil is probably the other place where it is popular.

**Big Windup! (AKA Oofuri)** is basically a fangirls dream when it... sorta comes to BL? I watched it though. But really, wouldn't expect it too be up there.

**Gundam**.... well I am quite sure there are the other series in Gundam that is more popular than Fighters... really.

There are some that I heard or glance over.... but have never watched them.
>> ARTICLE
What I think is the [original entry](http://myanimelist.net/anime/80/Mobile_Suit_Gundam) into the Gundam universe is actually also on this list, ranking just out of top 1000 in popularity. I also included Figthers because, after a bit of reading around, it seemed to stand on its own as well.

For Lost Canvas I wasn't sure if it was directly related to the older, original series, which is more popular, but I still included it. I've only watched the first season of Lost Canvas (and not liked it).

I've seen both Major and Oofuri as well, the former being in my top 10 anime, and I must say I'm not really surprised to see a lot of good sports anime on this list. Erin is another of my favourite anime too :)

And surprisingly, I haven't seen From Up on Poppy Hill yet.
>> ARTICLE
Lost Canvas was set 200+ years in the past before the start of the original series. I don't remember if it was canon or not, but it deals with the Hades War during that time period. 

If it isn't canon, it is because it references two of the gold saints (in the current war) who were also alive 200 years ago (this part is canon, as for the specifics I don't like spoiling why they lived 200+ years.)

From Up On Poppy Hill is one of Goro's better Ghibli films, but whether you will like it, I'm not so sure. The guy needs to live in his father's footsteps, that is for sure :p

> Saint Seiya: Lost Canvas.... the whole Saint Seiya series itself is rather unknown to most audiences outside of Japan... if anything, outside of Japan, Brazil is probably the other place where it is popular.

Wow, really? That's shame. Saint Seiya was so huge here in France they even released one (maybe more I don't know of) game on NES directly from Japan (and it was even translated in French, which was a super rare feat back in the day, 95% of the games were English only).

The fact that they made a dub and broadcast it for maybe 10 years certainly helped though lol. Didn't they broadcast this series in USA/Canada/UK/AUS etc? I don't know about the rest of Europe either, since in France we got quite a lot of anime in the 80's thanks to producers participating or simply cause we imported them directly from JP to broadcast on TV in the morning (which caused a ruckus with DBZ & Hokuto no Ken's violence lol).
>> ARTICLE
It did start airing Saint Seiya here in the states as "Knights of the Zodiac" for a brief time in 2003 on Cartoon Network, but for all it was worth, it was basically diluted by other anime shows airing at that time...shows like Inuyasha, DBZ and Yu Yu Hakasho (which most of these aired long before they were dubbed into the US.)

I watched the Asian dubbed of most of these as a kid before they started dubbing it, and besides a few things like Pokemon and the guy I know who was totally into Dragonball, most wouldn't know why I was wearing a forehead protector like Hinata in the first place..... although anime is a lot more prevalent now.
>> ARTICLE
I see thanks. They broadcast it along City Hunter, DBZ, Ranma 1/2 etc mid/early 90s here in France, back when Anime was all the rage... On a side note, Saint Seiya was called "Chevaliers du Zodiaque" which also means "Knights of the Zodiac"... Interesting coincidence.

Ofc by 2003+ anime wasn't so fresh and the market got pretty flooded, between Pokmon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Digimon and whatnot. Oh, yeah, Yu-Yu Hakusho was pretty awesome too. I loved that one. Too bad the ending sucked, hopefully Togashi won't do that for Hiatus X Hiatus... =/

There is an absolute ton of really good shows on this list and it's sort of mind blowing some of them aren't more popular.

A Gundam UC fan's notes on episode 7: The Core Fighter's Escape

-Garma hasn't given up pursuit of White base, and has a Luggun reconnaissance plane follow them. Once again, this plane's design baffles me as well.  But shhhhh, Minovsky Reactors.

-Inside White Base, the crew works on trying to send a core fighter over Zeon airspace to make it to Federation controlled territory.

-Bright talks to Lt. Reed about not letting the refugees leave the ship for their own safety. At the same time, the civilians are getting desperate to leave the ship.

-Amuro comes up with an effective solution to getting a Core Fighter into a high enough altitude to avoid Zeon planes. Kai makes his normal cynical comments about White Base's chances.

-Garma looks over the data collected from the battle with Gundam, while Char says that they should attack again soon.

-Apparently, the disgruntled civilians took some people and Fraw Bow hostage. Hayato lays into Amuro for focusing more on his Core Fighter mission than the hostage issue. Lay up, Hayato. Amuro's got more than enough to deal with already.

-Kai continues to be pessimistic.

-Garma's Gaw air fleet goes after White Base once the Luggun plane reports White Base's change in altitude and the core fighter's launch.

-Meanwhile, the White Base crew confronts the hostage-takers, who explain that they're very desperate to leave White Base and stand on firm Earth.

-Bigger issues are about when Amuro passes out from the sheer G-forces the Core Fighter is experiencing. Luckily, he wakes up in time to avoid Char's Musai capsule's shots. In return, Amuro scores a few direct hits on the capsule.

-As Dopp fighters close in, Amuro is ordered to retreat so he can fight in the Gundam. Amuro clearly has reservations on fighting in mid-air, but it's not like he has a choice. At least he manages to shoot down several Dopps with his beam rifle before he drops out of White Base's hangar.

-Char enters the fray in his Zaku, and he battles the Gundam while in free fall.

-To make things even more stressful, the rebelling civilians show up on the bridge and refuse to leave. Look, I know you want to leave, but there's a time and place. In the middle of a battle for everyone's lives isn't one of those times.

-Kai continues to be pessimistic. He's then promptly punched by Bright, [thus making one of my favorite .gifs.] (http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/529/003/4d5.gif) Bright then channels his inner Vogon and threatens to throw him out of the airlock hatch.

-Ordered by White Base, Amuro cuts a retreat. Char, meanwhile, manages to land safely.

-Char gets a call from Garma regarding Gundam, and how they need to think of a good way to approach it. Char is shocked to learn that the Gundam is modular, and that the MS he's been currently fighting is just one part of a general-purpose unit. Thank goodness for that Core Block tech.

-Back on White Base's bridge, Amuro encounters the desperate civilians. Their leader begs to leave and stand his position, but Amuro yells at him that they're not appreciating the stuff he's going through to save all of them. Mirai then leads away Amuro before he makes a big scene.

-Fraw Bow and the kids come back, no longer being held captive. Yay!

*"If you were in their same position, would you have acted in the same way as the evacuees? In your eyes, were they in the right by taking action, or were they, in fact, selfish?"*

Although I understand why those refugees are protesting like that, there's really a time and a place for that. In the middle of a battle with a giant air fleet isn't the best time, to say the least. But, I would probably join them if I was in their position. I'd be dead scared too.
>> ARTICLE
The literal dinosaur-like designs of aerial/space craft of ZEON never ceases to amuse me. They truly were created to be more an implementation of terror than function at times. I know Gundam gets compared to Star Wars often, but in that sense, ZEON mobile armor and mecha ideology is similar to that of the Empire's. Utilizing fear and size more than being strictly based around performance/destruction.

I loved Amuro in that scene, he stood out in front of the two commanders and everyone else.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, if there's one thing that I really like about Amuro, it's that he isn't afraid to call people out as he sees fit.
>> ARTICLE
[This reaction was so rational](http://i.imgur.com/PsAPXXW.jpg) that I really didn't expect Amuro to have it, not sure why. Quite surprised by it.

> if you were in their same position, would you have acted in the same way as the evacuees? In your eyes, were they in the right by taking action, or were they, in fact, selfish? 

Though I can't entirely blame them for acting like that since they seem fed up with everything that has been going on (though taking hostages might be a bit extreme), I wouldn't act the same way. Apart from it being careless and wrong (they are civilians and tried to blackmail the officers by taking more civilians/children as hostages?), they are also being protected/saved by others who are in similar circumstances as them, so they do seem quite selfish.
>> ARTICLE
Well, as far as taking hostages go, they appear to have done it as gently as possible. They're just letting the kids sit there, not being held by any weapons or anything, and their terms to let them go is just "tell us when we can land."
>> ARTICLE
Yesterday's episode was a bit better than I remember, but not this one. While any episode of Gundam is better than most stuff from the era, this truly is one of the series' weakest. Down there with episodes 14, 22 and 23 (have never seen the infamous episode 15 that was reportedly so bad Tomino refused to have it released in the US). On the bright side, got one of the weakest episodes out of the way and only a small number of them left.

Amuro's bad experiences continue as his core fighter mission pretty much fails. Amuro's angst continues as he is forced to go into the Gundam yet again, not being that confident about what he'll be able to do. Good to continue to have this type of development although it is a bit repetitive of last episode's.

A few days ago I was thinking it was just Bright and Ryu, but looks like we have a few more actual Federation members still around? Like that guy who is instructing Amuro? And I can't recall if it is ever clear if Omur, who along with Job John is one of the often seen, but never significant White Base crewmembers is revealed to be an actual soldier or another civilian.

I think the civilian revolt was another helpful way to see all the trouble White Base is under (you do forget that they still have all these refugees from Side 7) although I've personally always hated this storyline and its one of the reasons why I don't like the episode that much. [early MSG spoilers](/s "I think many of these are the character who bolt from White Base in episode 11, only to get promptly shot and killed by Char?")

Also not much going on with Garma and Char in this episode, even though Char comes back out in the field to briefly fight Amuro. 

Question of the Day Response: They were selfish. Enjoyed the fact that Amuro went on that rant against them.
>> ARTICLE
> have never seen the infamous episode 15 that was reportedly so bad Tomino refused to have it released in the US

The animation is pretty bad, a lot more quality issues than every other episodes. But the writing is not any better or worse than any other one off filler episodes in the series.

Now you've gone and made me curious about episode 15. I guess I'll have to wait a little more than a week to find out what you mean.

* Stop ignoring Haro, the poor little robot just wants to know how are you doing.

* Amuro really trust himself, and he's going to be right. His calculations so far haven't failed.

* A Riot? Really? Fuck that.

* Fraw Bow offered herself as a hostage. Sigh.

* Amuro is too cold for his friend.

* Kai being an asshole. Water is wet.

* I guess passing out wasn't on his calculations.

* The fight on the ships was pretty decent, nothing to write home about.

* And then the Gundam comes out and destroys everything.

* Or not, the Red Comet have other plans for you kid.

* Thankfully the Gundam is pretty resistant.

* Old people calmed down. They should stay calm, they have fucking Gundam on board.

>if you were in their same position, would you have acted in the same way as the evacuees? In your eyes, were they in the right by taking action, or were they, in fact, selfish?

They were selfish and impatient. I can say I understand why, but still, most of them were old people that should have known better.

Edit: also, seconding OP reccomendation on Shouwa Rakugo, great show! Best first episode of the season so far.
>> ARTICLE
It's here! The legendary Old People Uprising, one of those parts in the show which is just a little bit campy, a little bit serious, but still what makes it so charming to watch.

**Discussion question of the day:** I think I'd just leave it to the military and try not to get in their way, more out fear of Zeon than anything else.
>> ARTICLE
> more out fear of Zeon than anything else.

to me I think that's what made this such a strange but wonderful episode. like, what would lead people to act so desperately that they'd turn on the military and point guns at children just so that they could land on *enemy* territory? it's so bizarre but it does a great job of answering the question "so what do the civilians think of all this?" in an entertaining way.
>> ARTICLE
* Haro is worried about the elderly!

* The old mans idea was stupid but its true, hostages was the only way that they would be talked to on equal terms. Love how Amuro tells them off. Were fighting for you, not ourselves!

* [Kai san is a jerk, so slap(actually a punch but he deserved it so I'll count it as a slap) count+1(3, I think)](http://imgur.com/wUsLcMf)

* [For the Ladies](http://imgur.com/SEEsUMG)

* Amuro passes out during the launch so that Char can get to him of course.

* Another Amuro vs Char fight

I hope that after they escape there's a few episodes without fighting.
>> ARTICLE
> Love how Amuro tells them off. Were fighting for you, not ourselves!  
  
it's really tragic too, especially seeing all that he's suffering for them and for everyone else. him falling unconscious in the fighter was one of those "poor Amuro :(" moments that I think would've lost a bit of stock if it weren't for all of what's going on around him in this episode.  
>> ARTICLE
That's right! I forgot that Amuro has been feeling down. How could I with all the emphasis it had last episode. That brings it up notch.
>> ARTICLE
Notes:

* I mean I know there's a lot of refugees, but there's really enough to  substantially increase the mass of White Base so that they can/can't go to satellite orbit?
* Does the fact that the Core Fighter is the core for all the suit types really mean anything about it being so powerful?
>> ARTICLE
At first, it looks like Amuro is getting better, being able to match some of Char's moves in free-fall, and even land a hit when they're both in the fighters outside of their mobile suits. But then Char lands consecutive head-shots and Amuro has to retreat for fear of the Gundam being beaten for the first time. 
>> ARTICLE
Bit late today. Was busy rewatching DRRR with sister.

The refugees are not amused by Haro. They dont even react. The expected reaction to Haro is either laughing it because its fun or kicking because its annoying.

Gunperrywhat is it with the Federation to put the word Gun in everything?

35 hours in training for the core fighter? Its only been a few days since they left Side 7(at least I think so), so thats a damn lot.

Amuro is either lazy or has very high expectations of the rest of the White Base crew, not even attempting to help Fraw.

Kai is really being a jerk to Amuro. Things like this are why I dont like him for most of the series.

And Amuro is unconscious again. He really shouldnt get used to that.

They wont hit us. For anyone but Char, thats an obvious death flag.

For once, Amuro and Char fight with fighters instead of mobile suits.

How the hell does Amuro know that Char is flying the plane? Its not even red!

Six against one isnt a fair fightwell, it is if Amuro were in a Gundam. Wait, nvm. Then it would be even less fair because the Gundam is OP.

Counting that punch as a slap. For future, will count all corrections to the slap counter. So Slap counter: 3

Fighting while in free fall: An idea so ridiculous, yet still used in almost all Gundam anime.

DamnChar beat the crap out of Amuro.

Char has seen only one aspect of the Gundambut its most powerful one.

For the question, honestly, I don't know.

I used to question the dub's stance on pronouncing Gundam "Gun-Damn" but knowing the Feddies and their love of the word, stressing it might better fit the canon.

all of what I'm posting from the header can be found on [this fan-made UC Calender](http://www.ultimatemark.com/gundam/timeline.php) (warning: spoilers, spoilers, spoilers!!), which, in turn, gets its information from a bunch of pamplets, novels, magazine articles, and manuals published by Bandai-Namco, which are listed [on this page](http://www.ultimatemark.com/gundam/archive.html). I'm including them in the header since most of these were never translated into English and a lot of this isn't explicitly mentioned in any of the tv shows (I've excluded events that happen in MS IGLOO and involving named characters from 0079, for example), therefore giving a bit of detail to stuff only ever offhandedly mentioned.

Since there's not much else to talk about with this episode, I noticed while watching the OP something kind of amusing. During the "Kimi yoooooo... tsukameeeee!" part when Amuro and Bright throw their hands up to the sky, Amuro looks all full of purpose. Meanwhile Bright's face just says "I don't know why I'm throwing my hand to the sky but I feel like I'm supposed to."

On another note, Gundam series are longer than most and this rewatch is covering a lot of series. I can't help but notice that the total votes and comments for each day have been steadily declining... I really hope this re-watch doesn't die out so early :(

I can't say I would act at all like the refugees. I understand that their conditions aren't the best and they have a lot of sentimentality towards the Earth, but they should consider themselves fortunate to even be alive at that point considering who they're up against. Watching them demand more and more of the people trying their hardest to save their lives just annoyed me.

First time watcher. New to mecha proper. Reaction-style commentary. Had to go out of town earlier than expected yesterday so I'm just barely sneaking this one in :P

* Civilians are worn down. Even less responsive than they were before.
* Kai has a knack for recontextualizing other peoples words and stances. Also for attracting anger.
* A mixture of impressed and weariness over "how things are these days" when Amuro states his training and combat experience
* The civilians have a legitimate concern about their safety after all of this conflict in so little time
* Kai is self-deprecating when his snark isnt received well
* People were taken from their homes and separated from their families/spouses in the settlement of space
* Char is still able to immediately read White Bases tactics
* Sayla is all but coaching Amuro through his character arc
* Amuro needs assurance, support, or the knowledge that he has the upper hand
* Garma has surpassed Char in his intel of the Gundam, even though Char has had many more encounters with it
* The return home isnt always met with smiling faces or a congratulatory tone

**Discussion question of the day:** Disagree with the method, agree with the message
>> ARTICLE
>Discussion question of the day

On todays episode of Gundam: Old people make unreasonable complaints. I get that they want to return to their homes on Earth, but seriously. Cant they wait until they get to Federation territory and stop making all this trouble? If the White Base tries to land, it would probably be immediately attacked by Zeon forces. They're in a combat situation. I understand their position, but it would be safer and easier for everyone if they just wait.

 Also, taking Kikka hostage does them no favors in my book (Ive found myself liking her ever since she stomped that guards foot). They should be careful, she might have stomped on any of their feet.

Todays episode also made me like Bright more. Ive already said hes practically the only competent commander weve seen in the Federation. He knew how to handle the old people situation without much trouble. And he punched Kai in the face. I like Kai and his snarkiness, but he had that one coming. 

Once again, we see that the Gundam is absurdly overpowered, and now the bad guys are starting to get a fuller picture of just how strong it is as they discover more of its abilities. I really like how Char seemed to be afraid by those revelations. Reactions like that just make the bad guys feel more human, you know?

>> ARTICLE
> Also, taking Kikka hostage does them no favors in my book  
  
I'm always surprised she didn't handle the situation herself somehow. as absurd as it would be, she's got that Ghibli-tier childhood independence that I wouldn't be too surprised if she did.  
  
> Todays episode also made me like Bright more.   
  
good! one of the benefits of this sort of approach that the story is using in terms of structure is that we get to see how people react under a certain bit of pressure that would be somewhat absent without the battle of the week format. not only does he have to handle the old people, but he needs to keep an eye on the fight as well, and that results in more high tension character drama than if things were calmer and situations were being tackled one thing at a time.  
  
> Reactions like that just make the bad guys feel more human, you know?  
  
the humanization of villains has been one of my favorite things about this franchise by far. lots of shows try humanizing them with sob stories and flash backs, while in this show it all has to do with how they react to things *in the present*, and that's just really good writing imo.

**FIRST TIME VIEWER**

So, uh I missed yesterdays thread. So heres a two in one reaction!

Episode 6

So apparently White Base is going up against someone other than Char. This should be interesting. Anyways, here goes!

00:15  Cheesy OP is cheesy.

02:35  Why does it look like theyre back in space, for some reason?

03:47  Old friends, huh?

04:27  Looks like Garma is trying to prove his worth as a commander. 

04:30  Or impress his sister.

05:45  Oops.

06:40  But its been doing plenty of that!

10:09  And now we have a tank battle.

10:15  My god, those explosions. Thats some QUALITY animation, right there.

12:00  THE AMAZING FLYING TANK. And now we no longer have a tank battle.

12:13  Is the stress getting to Amuro?

12:57  And now we go back to Giant robots fighting giant robots.

13:45  The stress is definitely getting to Amuro.

14:34  Is Char backstabbing Garma? Because that sounds like a backstab.

14:49  Yep. Thats definitely a backstab, right there.

16:35  And the entire Zeon army collectively say FUCK! RUN!

16:45  And then start bombarding him.

17:03  you okay there amuro

17:30  Amuro has gone berserker, or something.

17:41  Zeon Withdraws Cooly

17:44  AMURO RAEG
18:20  Beating a dead horse, or Zaku, or something.

20:08  amuro you ok

20:47  Where did that kid get champagne?

21:05  The stress is really getting to him.

22:11  Char. In the shower. 

22:41  Char looking very sinister and ominous there.

**Overall thoughts**:

Well, that was interesting.  The stress of being on the front lines of a war is definitely getting to Amuro, and thats probably going to build up even more until it screws things up majorly. Meanwhile, on the Zeon side of things, Char is scheming to backstab Garma. Hes still my favourite character though, with Bright Noa close behind. Anyway, on to the next episode!

**Episode 7**

00:15 - *Gandamu intensifies*

03:54  Amuro is out of his room, apparently.

04:30  Refugees have become a point of contention. I wonder what impact thatll have.

05:20  Are the refugees rioting? 0-0

06:55  Called it!

07:50  Amuro, still getting the job done, even under stress.

08:01  Hes definitely still nervous though.

08:08  [reverse kamina]( http://imgur.com/xFX3Hot)

08:10  Kais a dick.

10:06  Well. Chars figured out the plan. This could get messy.

11:50  And Amuros lost contact with White Base. This could get *very* messy.

12:09  And Amuros fallen unconscious in the cockpit. The situation is fucked.

13:08  And the radars messed up, as well. Just to compound everyones misery.

13:37  Amuros woken up. Thats a first step to making the situation less of a mess.

14:28  How did he tell it was Char?

15:21  Get rekt, kai. You earned that punch.

15:24  You were a dick, Kai. Thats what you did.

16:40  Someones lacking in self-confidence.

18:12  Char is taking the field.

18:58  And this, my friends, is how you do a fight in freefall.

19:13  After constant attempts by Char and co, old men are commandeering the White Base. Welp.

19:26  No, Bright, that is not the way to defuse a situation like that.

19:51  To make matters worse, the Gundam is being shot in the head repeatedly. This really isnt their day, is it?

21:39  Unfortunately, you *are* old and difficult.

So that was episode 7. *Really* not a good day for the White Base. They failed to make contact with the Earth Federation and, to make matters worse, the refugees arent confident in them anymore. Also, Kais a dick.

**First-time viewer reporting in.**

To future visitors: [you can find all of the episode threads here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12lDLXGnnddCov7VWrTxHts3Ko-iHKcfSTavKhGr-HhY/)

**Pre-Episode Thoughts**  Time to meet more Federation characters, assuming White Base finds some resistance group. Oh, and they'll most likely lead Char straight to them as well.

---
Civilians laying around the hallways, reminds me of Battlestar Galactica.

Gunperry? Dumbest name I've heard so far and I don't even know what it's referring to.

Kai's a jerk, but he's not wrong. The civilians are an issue and it's not going to get any better if they stay on the run.

Catapult, eh? It's so crazy it could work.

People are holding the kids hostage? This is gonna get ugly. Fraw Bow trying to ameliorate the situation though.

Char's smart and realizes what they could possibly be doing as well, I like it. Pursuit en route!

Oy, don't point guns at desperate unarmed people. At least they realized that soon enough.

Well, Amuro's out. I don't imagine remote control is an option.

Hah, justification for Char missing the Core Fighter that doesn't make him look bad. Well played.

Damn, that punch knocked Kai across the room. Bright is tired of his shit.

Ooh, aerial Gundam fight coming up? I figured White Base could handle those fighters without needing to launch it but apparently not.

Gundam sniper! That's a good idea.

Uh oh, here comes Char.

Fighting in free fall, this is pretty cool. Also reminds me of one of the more awesome moments in Battlestar Galactica. I'm going to keep making comparisons to other sci-fi series, anime or not.

Char's wrecking Amuro here *and* he's handily dodging everything White Base is throwing at him.

Bunch of old people want to die on the ground, I can't blame them but they're better off staying with the protagonists.

Nice scenery of them flying through the mountains too.

---
**Post-Episode Thoughts**  I should know better by now, if they decide to go somewhere it's going to take at least three episodes with two fights on the way. *Maybe* they'll get to Federation territory next time?

>  if you were in their same position, would you have acted in the same way as the evacuees? In your eyes, were they in the right by taking action, or were they, in fact, selfish? 

I understand them but it's just a bad idea to get dropped off in Zeon territory.
>> ARTICLE

[minor spoiler](/s "They won't be in Federation territory for a LONG time. But they will eventually meet allied troops")
>> ARTICLE
as someone who has never seen Battlestar Galactica, these comparisons are interesting. are you referring to the version in the 70's or the recent reboot? there might be a reason for these similarities if the latter, since Gundam has inspired a fair share of shows through the late 20th century to today. 
>> ARTICLE
You should watch BSG Spiranix, it's fantastic and one of my most favourite sci-fi series. It's IBO low tech (so no beam weaponry or shields, good ol' fashion bullets), has sort of the same idea as Sidonia with the last of humanity on the run from annihilation and filled to the brim with politics and conspiracies. Definitely a much watch for any sci-fi lover.

And did I mention it also has a godly [OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhkmglawA2w)? 


>> ARTICLE
oooof, that track gave me goosies. all of that sounds right in my strike zone, I love used future settings (it's practically my favorite type of sci-fi backdrop) and politically-based space operas. I'm sold, I'll get on it soon!
>> ARTICLE
[](#helmetbro)

For the watch order the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Battlestar_Galactica_\(2004_TV_series\)_episodes) does a good job of what to watch when.

Just searching up the OST again makes me want to rewatch it ^^^for ^^^the ^^^third ^^^time. Here's another awesome [track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr_79Jm62mo) to listen to.

this is really helpful, thanks! would've skipped the miniseries by accident otherwise. e__e  
  
dang, that track's putting me in a really zen place. I dig it.

you'll be my PM dump for when I get there, I'll make a note of it! ;)

Yeah, the newer one. There's a lot of internal conflict between the civilians and the military on the ship and I wouldn't be surprised if it drew from Gundam in that regard.

I won't spoil it's appearance, but I can confirm that the Gunperry looks as dumb as it's name sounds. Trust me on that one.

This is definitely a much appreciated way for discovering new anime! Thank you for doing this compilation and thanks to all the people that put up the WT! threads! There is one I am planning to watch relatively soon because of one of these threads (which is Valkyria Chronicles and I actually just recently picked up the game the anime adapted).
>> ARTICLE
This month was stuffed with a lot of good recommendation and great threads! Be sure to check up several posts made by /u/irisfang, ending of /u/7TeenWriters 's marathon of Satoshi Kon's works, as well as [new recommendation](https://redd.it/43ep86) made by /u/einherjar81, who is really good at writing. I also want to draw your attention at [Cat Soup](https://redd.it/41d3px) thread made by /u/define_irony - the anime is only 32 minutes, and... let's put it this way, it's worthy of your attention. Also /u/illtima not only gave me a bit of a headache with his [9-in-one-thread recommendation](https://redd.it/3zrb7x) (I got them all in the spreadsheet, though!), but also wrote a solid post (with audio) as well. My thread of the month was [Arakawa Under the Bridge](https://redd.it/42n7ob). 

I guess that takes care about January, thanks for reading, and as usual, feedback is much appreciated!

P.S. This year I'm busy on weekends, so expect threads to come up on Mondays of the following month... until further notice. 
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for the endorsement!

I went a little crazy writing WT! thread this month haha. Now that school's back in session I probably won't have as much time but I hope to do at least one every month still!

How was there a WT! thread for a show that was only 3 episodes through.

Thank you for sharing this. Good to catch up.

Now this is stuff that I want to see more off.

I think this duality exists for lots of countries in the world, more so for non-european ones than european ones, thought european ones have this duality too to a certain extend.

All cultures that get into contact with the dominant culture, which at this time is North American with a bit of European, will have to struggle with this. To reject the perceived foreign culture, to embrace it, or to choose a path between. You can see this in the native people of former European colonies too.

Personally, while I do not feel a deep connection to traditions and culture, I find it sad to see that many countries abolish perfectly fine practices, aesthetics and traditions in favour of foreign ones. European countries which previously had not had Christmas figures now adopt the American Santa, while their own similar celebrations are forgotten is just one example close to my home. Lots of the aesthetics of those cultures can be integrated into the globalised culture, traditional arts and sports can be kept alive. The Japanese and eastern countries in general have done this with their martial arts, which have become so widespread all over the world that westerners have forgotten about their own martial arts. I am glad to see that arts like these are not forgotten, but kept alive throughout the world, and I hope we can revive historical European martial arts in a similar way.

It always makes me somewhat sad to see people denounce their own culture or traditions as "inferiour" to another, such people are in all countries. This is coming from someone who openly opposes needless traditionalism and doesnt generally give two shits about "how its supposed to be done". A strange duality in me, im sure there are others who share my feelings.

Maybe practices dying out is just the way of cultures coming and going, a natural process. I don't know. I really liked this piece.

(if i seem eurocentric in my examples, thats because im european and i have no clue about how this is in other places other than superficial stories and anecdotes)
>> ARTICLE
I'm pretty stunned at how much karma each ERASED discussion thread is getting. The only other episode threads I've seen get 2000+ upvotes have been the Your Lie in April finale and One Punch Man. 
>> ARTICLE
It's just that there seems to be a ton more people discussing in /r/anime every season. Your average OPM episode had more upvotes than the finales of the biggest hitters of previous few seasons, and didn't even compare to the ones from 2014. Now Boku Dake is having this much success, despite the near absense of hype before it aired (especially compared to OPM). I imagine SnK 2 and Steins;Gate 0 threads will dwarf even Shigatsu and OPM's.
>> ARTICLE
I'm surprised it got a bump in Karma at all, this time last week there was a 4pt gap between episode 1 and 2 so I expected it stay steady until it ended or it began to mess up. 

And with the comments it's getting there is hardly a bad word to be said about it. Which is amazing when you look at the show's it beat that are made up mainly of discussions of whether the show is good or bad. 

Good to see it doing so well though, it's the first show in a long time that I feel I could recommend to anyone, anime watcher or not.
>> ARTICLE
I think it increased because of the influx of people picking up the show after hearing such good things after the first two episodes. Just looking at the members on MAL, it was around 80k at episode 2 and it's now closing in on 110k after just a week.
>> ARTICLE
It has also rocketed up the MAL Top Anime list, currently sitting #15. Even with its unstoppable hype train, One Punch Man took 9 episodes to reach the same [position](http://anime.daanst.net/anime/show/30276). The score may be premature but its heartening to see a series get so much attention for simply being pretty damn great. If the show maintains its level of quality, it might even make a run at knocking FMA:B off the top position (unlikely, but definitely possible).
>> ARTICLE
Woah that's a pretty cool site. Thanks for that! 
>> ARTICLE
Rakugo still outside top 10

Why do people fail to recognize true art
>> ARTICLE
Rakugo is great, but it's SUPER not the genre most people on this sub tend to look for.

I'm really digging it so far. A frame narrative involving two orphan thespians, a convict, and a spunky redhead spanning two generations and an entire war? 40 minute episodes? I'll take all of that you can give me, thanks.
>> ARTICLE
Not enough waifus and edgy violence.
>> ARTICLE
Konatsu is the best waifu.
>> ARTICLE
i was thinking about wether or not to pick up Boku dake ga Inai Machi and seeing it here on #1 definitley pushes me towards watching it

can somebody tell me whats so good about it?
>> ARTICLE
Just watch the three episodes,you'll understand why everyone is crazy about it
>> ARTICLE
Outside of Rakugo, it's the most mature and least "tropey" show this season, so it easily stands out from the crowd. Despite a supernatural premise, it manages to treat its characters and subjects seriously and with respect. Fantastic direction, too. They even manage to do a double-voiceover effect that doesn't seem gimmicky. I really can't say enough good about it so far, and I hope it stays this great.
>> ARTICLE
thank you!
>> ARTICLE
It's a show that takes itself seriously (so far) and has an interesting concept; it's a refreshing bit of anime in what usually is a large pile of the same old stuff we get every anime season. 

The music is done by [Yuki Kajiura,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Kajiura) too!
>> ARTICLE
I couldn't sell it to you well, but I like how the characters are presented (characterization, VAs, fitting mood, etc). It made me intrigued/care about the characters and the plot much more quickly than expected.

I would say you'd find it worth your time if you get hooked by the first episode, but no promises as I have no clue where the story will go (but hey that's the fun of watching right?)
>> ARTICLE
From a cursory glance, I think you might want to update Akagami's values. Probably due to when you ran the script, values are quite low.

Also thoughts on using an Exponential Moving Average over the period? It's an average but it'll put more weight on the most recent results. (Since you're ranking by average)
>> ARTICLE
> From a cursory glance, I think you might want to update Akagami's values. Probably due to when you ran the script, values are quite low.

Nope just double checked they are correct.

>Also thoughts on using an Exponential Moving Average.

Could look into it, not really sure on the best way to implement something like that into google sheets. Don't have a lot of knowledge with different methods of obtaining averages either.

But I was thinking that the current method might mean show's with strong start through hype might still beat show's that should really be above it because they had no hype for the first few episodes. (Musaigan and Kono Suba) 


>> ARTICLE
> not really sure on the best way to implement something like that into google sheets

I could make a simple script to do it if you decide to go that route.

Sorry replies a bit late, between work and football I've been a bit busy. I wouldn't worry about it for the moment, if it starts to get a bit samey I may look at changing it up a bit.

woops, I was looking at Season 1.

Yeah reading up on EMA and it can definitely be a bit tricky to implement.
>> ARTICLE
**Predictions for next week**
>> ARTICLE
Grimgar will drop like a rock once nothing happens for a 4th consecutive week.
>> ARTICLE
KonoSuba will probably continue to rise, especially considering other people's prediction for the fall of Grimgar. Last episode was fantastic and got 30% more upvotes than the previous week, that's something really uncommon for seasonal anime (looking at Gintama). I joined it after finding out the last eps karma, 110% worth it. 

PSA: Watch KonoSuba
>> ARTICLE
Phantom world will drop super heavily...

There was a lot of unrest and uneasiness about the kyoani fanservice, and my guess is a huge amount of people will drop it at the 3 episode mark. ^^^^^Not ^^^^^me ^^^^^though
>> ARTICLE
Yeah I nearly dropped it last week not because of the fan service but because I found episode 2 to be a bit meh, episode 3 convinced me it's fun enough to keep watching but I'm not expecting a masterclass in character driven storytelling here.

Still expect it to drop pretty heavily though, along with Grimgar and Sekkou Boys. (Grimgar is one of my favourites this season but it isn't an easy sell)

Expecting Prince of Stride to build slowly now the majority of people who were turned off by it's subject material have dropped the show and with knowledge of the constant matches coming up for the EoS trials. 
>> ARTICLE
Put my own into the hat, think Kono Suba will surpass or get on the same level as Musaigan as it has yet to air it's 3rd episode and the hype is building whereas Musaigen is losing viewers at a steady rate.
>> ARTICLE
Karma for Erased will be even higher since the fanbase is growing rapidly. It just needs to maintain the quality of directing (as a manga reader I know the story is strong enough) that it has shown in the first three episodes. 
>> ARTICLE
Judging by the discussion in this week's thread, Grimgar is either going to have an incredible episode or take a hard fall. 
>> ARTICLE
And I'll probably keep enjoying it either way. :)
>> ARTICLE
More people need to watch Gintama.
>> ARTICLE
i think a lot of people are waiting for the current arc to finish so they can binge it
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for putting these threads together, this sort of data is *exactly* what I'm into. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with what's getting attention and what isn't. Of course, ERASED is just... so good, it's so difficult to find anything bad about it. I'm also pretty pleased to see KonoSuba moving up, however slightly, as the comedy in it is top notch. 

It'll be interesting to see how things will change next week, with what I imagine will be a pretty significant decrease in activity across nearly all of the anime, especially those near the bottom, as people drop them after their third week.
>> ARTICLE
> Thanks for putting these threads together, this sort of data is exactly what I'm into.

Aha no worries, I'm the same hence why I've become known as the spreadsheet guy among my friends, make spreadsheets for the most ridiculous things because DATA.

Technically KonoSuba has an advantage next week as it hasn't aired 3 episode yet. It's also been absolutely brilliant so far which might help.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm the same hence why I've become known as the spreadsheet guy among my friends, make spreadsheets for the most ridiculous things because DATA.

Oh, I feel you. I've got spreadsheets for everything: tracking eSports stats, movie scores, books I've read, to-do lists, and, of course [anime](http://i.imgur.com/hoX0Qed.png). I get a little bit obsessive when it gets to quatifying and ranking things, and I've had a lot of fun putting together spreadsheets for everything I can think of.

> Technically KonoSuba has an advantage next week as it hasn't aired 3 episode yet.

Yeah, it's one of the later airing ones, so I'm hopeful that it'll keep bumping up! More people need to see it :D
>> ARTICLE

We went for our 2nd game of leisure league football last night, and the conversation of tracking the money everyone put in come up, at which point my mate go "we could do with a spreadsheet" then just stares at me... 

And apparently our opinions on this season don't differ all too much aha, althought your not as prone to dropping shows as I am. 
>> ARTICLE
> althought your not as prone to dropping shows as I am.

I guess I'm trying to give shows three strikes; three episodes that I'd rate at a 4 or lower, regardless of circumstances, and they're out. It's more stringent than I did last season, where I held on to the bitter end...
>> ARTICLE
I find it fascinating how low Rakugo is for what I, and several others, believe is the top competition, quality wise, with Boku dake ga Inai Machi
>> ARTICLE
These rankings are not a measure of how good a show is. All this says is how many people are watching it.

please keep doing this

That's a lot of effort, thanks. If you keep going with it you'll have at least one appreciative reader!

Same here. Still disappointed we didn't get any kizumonogatari.

I suspect that if Kizumonogatari shows up it will probably be at Scotland Loves Anime in September. It's a bit close to its' release for it to show up here.

Make that two. Our island exists, y'know.

Did not think I would be lucky enough to see The Boy and The Beast until the DVD release, this is great news. Do you think you will do more of these roundups in the future? This was really helpful
>> ARTICLE
I'd like to try and do this at the end of every month, assuming there's enough news to justify it. Studiocanal has the UK rights to Boy and the Beast, and they'll want it to make a big splash. Now that Ghibli is closing down they'll probably want to try and make some of their other films try and capture the same audience and Boy and the Beast seems like the kind of title that might fit in well with that. That means a wide release with an English dub for accessibility. Funimation is working on a dub right now, and I'm assuming it'll be ready for the US launch in March. We'll probably see Boy and the Beast in general release later on in the year.
>> ARTICLE
This is great! Thanks a lot for this!

One day something good will come up to Scotland...

Edit, the north east of Scotland, Glasgow is too far south.
>> ARTICLE
I don't particularly agree. Scotland has it pretty damn cushy compared to the rest of the UK. [Scotland Loves Anime](http://www.lovesanimation.com/) consistently delivers the UK's largest dedicated anime film festival in the UK, with exclusives and first screenings for tons of films across Glasgow and Edinburgh. Last year they had 15 screenings in Edinburgh ovr a week and 7 in Glasgow over a weekend. That included the EU premieres of Love Live, Attack on Titan Live Action 1 & 2 and Expelled from Paradise, UK premieres of Miss Hokusai, Empire of Corpses, The Case of Hana and Alice, Boruto, Attack on Titan Animated 1 & 2, Psycho-Pass: The Movie, The New Ghost in the Shell Movie and PMMM 3: Rebellion. They also had Naruto: The Last, Dragonball Z: Resurrection F and a screening of 15 shorts from Animator Expo.  

There's nowhere else in the UK you can watch that many films, or that variety of films. PMMM is unlikely to be shown in a cinema again, that was the only UK screening it's getting. Scotland is home to the anime film festival everyone else in the UK has to come to to see this stuff. I know I wrote a ton on this, but I feel like it's important people know that when it comes to anime films, Scotland is a first rate country. 

Edit 1: Apologies, my opening sentence was a bit too harsh.  

Edit 2: The north east is a bit of a different beast I'll admit. I think they did have a few screenings in Aberdeen as well last year, but you're right that you're not going to get a lot of opportunities to see a wide variety of stuff that far north.

Is Daisuki getting Dagashi Kashi a week late? 
>> ARTICLE
New episodes of Dagashi Kashi should go up on Wednesdays at 11am JST, which should be about 2am GMT. That makes it about a 5 day delay I think. I suspect Animax has the day and date rights to simulcast at the same time as Funimation, but they're so incompetent they're still on Episode 1.
>> ARTICLE
Well, now I have another reason to go to Glasgow. 
>> ARTICLE
A shame Glasgow is a little far for me! Thanks for the writeup though, still not sure how I feel about Funi coming over here.
>> ARTICLE
The way I look at it, at least we'll finally be able to watch Funi shows reliably, rather than having to go sailing. It'll be much more convenient, and it's not like the non-Crunchyroll services have much to recommend them.
>> ARTICLE
Oh my god yes for Bham
>> ARTICLE

Ooh please do continue! I'd love to see more monthly UK relative roundups like this. 
>> ARTICLE
 this is great and very informative thanks!  hopefully funimation will be on a par with crunchyroll for catalogue and price and have most of animax's simulcasts.
>> ARTICLE
FunimationNow has a UK website currently active, and it's advertising Grimgar, Dimension W and Divine Gate as launch titles, which are currently on Animax, so it certainly seems that'll be the case. Their US pricing seems pretty close to Crunchyroll so I'm expecting them to be fairly competitive here as well. They also have Snow White with the Red Hair, which is Viewsters only simulcast for the season, so RIP Viewster I guess.
>> ARTICLE
 hopefully RIP Animax too
>> ARTICLE
Maybe if Funimation's new app is any good, I'll be able to legally stream most of my anime for free. Up until now, I haven't been able to, since Crunchyroll has a shit app and Funimation has been US-only.
>> ARTICLE
Crunchyroll gave their Android app a pretty big update back in December, so if you haven't used it in a while, you may find it useful to download the new version and see if it works any better for you.

Last time I used it was back in October or something, so I'll see.

Dagashi Kashi seems like something I would like to go back to after a while.

Already watched some episodes more than once. Fucking love Dagashi Kashi especially the OP and ED
>> ARTICLE
If we're counting sequels I'll have to say Haikyuu or Durarara. The hype levels are just too high so rewatching them one day is a must.

Other than sequels probably KonoSuba? Comedies are usually fun to rewatch!
>> ARTICLE
im ready to rewatch Haikyuu any day

>> ARTICLE
For Durarara I'll have to rewatch just to know what's going on. Multiple month breaks in between the seasons did not make it easy to remember certain characters or events. I'll have to binge rewatch Durarara some day.
>> ARTICLE
I could definitely see myself rewatching KonoSuba or Grimgar
>> ARTICLE
Comedies are generally great rewatches so:

Dagashi Kashi

KonoSuba

Osomatsu San

Sekkou Boys
>> ARTICLE
KonoSuba.

And nothing else in this season, maybe Osomatsu-san.

ERASED will lose a good part of her hooking like all the mystery anime.

And the rest is not on KonoSuba/ERASED quality.

Koukaku no Pandora
>> ARTICLE
Well BokuMachi fans don't get too comfortable. Someone wrote a bad review about it on MAL. Karma's gonna way down from here on out  

^^^^^/s
>> ARTICLE
No /s

I suspect at the current rate of inflation the backlash is going to be *massive*, deserved or not, especially since it doesn't have the solid source material fan backing One Punch Man did.

I can taste the salt in the air already.
>> ARTICLE
How do you backlash something that has practically no flaws at this point? Or do you mean hate from people that haven't seen it and refuse to because of the hype?
>> ARTICLE
No flaws? That's laughable. Like actually hilarious.

But I'm not hating on the show by any means. I'm just telling you how things are going to be two months from now, because what's the point in sugar coating it? Anime fans will do what they've always done.
>> ARTICLE
I understood that you're telling me what you think will happen, but I just wanted to know what form you think this backlash will take.

I'll clarify I didn't mean no flaws as in every camera angle and frame and dialogue choice is perfect, but simply that I find there to be very little to criticize that isn't wildly subjective like "I don't like that he's a kid..." Don't worry I'm quite capable of keeping a level head about new shows. I didn't give it a ten either.
>> ARTICLE
Tbf I'm struggling to spot any flaws thus far, it seems to be doing everything right even down to scene composition. But as they say (probably don't say as I'm just changing the saying) one mans flaws is another mans treasure. 

Steins;Gates gets noted that it's flawed because of it's slow first half, whereas I feel like the first half was nothing but positive for the show and in terms of quality actually had less flaws than the second half. But what we perceive as flaws are very subjective and sometimes very personal. (Golden Times Banri being far from being a bro and just ditching his mates for the crazy chick is a flaw of the show very personal to me, but I still count it as a flaw) 
>> ARTICLE
A show could be literally perfect and it would still get haters just because of how its plot is formed or the direction it goes.

People could hate Boku Dake ga Inai Machi because they don't like the time travel story. Or maybe they don't like the main characters. Or maybe they just don't like the setting or artstyle. They could hate the sound design.

Just because you see no flaws in it, doesn't mean everyone will like it. I don't really see much flaw in how Vash's character from Trigun is written, but I still hate him because of how acts and his attitude.
>> ARTICLE
I can't wait.  This is going to be glorious.
>> ARTICLE
> I suspect at the current rate of inflation the backlash is going to be massive

I really really dislike this trend, it just seems so ridiculous that the opinion of a show gets swayed more by the audience of it than it's own quality.
>> ARTICLE
I'm inclined to agree, but I think it's somewhat necessary to properly place shows that get hyped to no end.

If the fans downvote everything negative about a show and the haters stay silent because "well it was still a good show so let's just let the negatives slide" then you end up with a skewed disposition.

Obviously it would be ideal if everyone stayed calm and evaluated a show rationally - whatever that means to them - but evolution hasn't taken us to that point yet.
>> ARTICLE
Looks like I was right about Boku Dake increasing in karma every week because of the extremely rapid growing fan base. Sadly, as it keeps going up in popularity and rankings on MAL, it will continue to be compared to shows like Steins;Gate more and more which is sort of unfair to both series. I've said it before and I'll say it again: It is true that both shows take advantage of time-travel but that's about it in terms of similarities.

Steins;Gate used time travel as a central plot point that needed to be explained, examined, questioned, and generally revolve the plot around. It explored time-travel as the main driving point of the show.

Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi does not do any of this but that's because it shouldn't. Despite the use of time travel, it is not the focus of the story. It is an unexplained phenomenon that should be left as ambiguous as an act of god or just something the universe wanted to happen. Having explanations or just generally spend any focus on time travel will be out of place. This is a mystery show, not a show about time travel.

I hope as this show gets closer and closer to top 10 and maybe even top 5 on MAL, it doesn't get overly criticized when compared to something like Steins;Gate. Let the sci-fi show explain the science and let the mystery show be a mystery.
>> ARTICLE
I agree that it will be strange if they would explain the time travel..... but on the other hand, if they will leave that unexplored, then we have a supernatural ability that is seemingly exclusive for one person, with no clear rules and frontiers and unknown origin in an otherwise mundane setting. 

On top of that, it will most probably always come in pretty conveniently whenever the plot demands it exactly because we essentially don't know anything about it. 

Yes, unlike Steins;Gate, Erased's main focus is not really about time travel, but it is still an important part as it basically kickstarts the whole plot and makes it stand out from other mystery shows.


I don't see how this is going to end well, in my opinion. 
>> ARTICLE
The problem with time-travel stories is that it sparks a greater curiosity in people than other science-fiction topics. Compare time-travel shows with other shows that establish unexplained phenomenon like superpowers or mind-control powers (like the Geass in Code Geass) and those aren't nearly as questioned.
>> ARTICLE
I agree. 

Kinda off-tipic, but I honestly don't like time travel stories in general and as of now, Erased is not an exception (yeah, downvote me to hell, but I don't like it nearly as much as the rest of /r/anime.)

Just like I already implied, I think that this show is pretty flawed from the beginning. 

Time travel gets explained -> Out of place and will mostly make no sense ("god" gave him that because we need to have a story).

Time travel will be left unexplored -> See my previous comment.

I will watch it until the end I will hold out my final judgement until then, but as of now, I just can't really enjoy it sadly and not only because of the time travel, but that is enough for today.
>> ARTICLE
Although personally I'm fine with it I can understand your frustration. Some people can overlook this while others can't so it makes sense that some people would be desatisfied without an explanation. It's just not that big of a deal in this show because it seems like the right call to me. 
>> ARTICLE
> How does your top 5 compare to r/anime top 5?

I don't agree, but I do understand.
>> ARTICLE
To answer my own question (a thing I do much too often) my top 5 would look in comparison;

**[1]** Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (1)

**[2]** Prince of Stride: Alternative (21)

**[3]** Hai to Gensou no Grimgar (2)

**[4]** Haikyuu!! Second Season (9)

**[5]** Kono Suba (4)

\* If I were to discount leftovers from last season then it would be Rakugo Shinjuu (11) in 5th.
>> ARTICLE
So...  
Grimgar turned it up a notch, Konusuba seems to get more popularity lately, and people seem to get tired of Dagashi Kashi and Phantom World.

Apparently Utawarerumono has a reason to get picked up again after cour 1, and people slowly realize that Koyomimonogatari exists.

>> ARTICLE
One of the biggest problems with Koyomi is the lack of simulcast.

That and yeah a lot of people don't know it's going on...
>> ARTICLE
It also helps that this week's episode was fucking glorious.
>> ARTICLE
> One of the biggest problems with Koyomi is the lack of simulcast.

Yeah it actually only started even being discussed on here from episode 3 because of the lack of simulcast and I believe a sub about it's universe or source material (not too clued up on the monogatari tings)
>> ARTICLE
r/araragi exists
>> ARTICLE
That's the one. :D
>> ARTICLE
I'm kinda sad that Active Raid and Aokana don't get too many comments... but then again, small discussion threads about shows that not many people are watching are my favorite. 

>How does your top 5 compare to r/anime top 5?

ERASED and Konosuba are one of my favorites this season, but Active Raid, that is another one of my favorites, is on the bottom of /r/anime.
>> ARTICLE
How's Active Raid doing, anyway? I dropped it because mecha but episode 1 seemed fun enough.
>> ARTICLE
Active Raid is super generic but it's reasonably well-executed, so it's a smooth filler anime.  I'd recommend it as being "good" filler anime.  Nothing to write home about or remember this season for, but worth watching after the big titles.
>> ARTICLE
It's going great. At least for me. It's super cheesy and campy and there are some really sweet mech fights. 
>> ARTICLE
Meh. Sounds like exactly the kind of show I wouldn't enjoy.
>> ARTICLE
That's basically why I dropped it. I think if that was taken out is enjoy it a lot more.
>> ARTICLE
>  Active Raid and Aokana

Two shows I dropped after 1 episode aha. Active Raids first episode especially bored me, but with the subject material and the style of dialogue that was generally going to be the case.
>> ARTICLE
Even Gatchaman Crowds didn't really get much attention on here. /r/anime doesn't give two shits about neo-tokusatsu, which is weird considering how much they like over-the-top parody-action stuff.
>> ARTICLE
Well at least Tantei Team didn't finish in last...
>> ARTICLE
It's hard to be a cute shoujo mystery short in this world. 
>> ARTICLE
The spikes in Grimgar and Utawarerumono are no surprise given that both of them finally have some plot happening.

Steady growth of Konosuba, not surprising.
>> ARTICLE
> How does your top 5 compare to /r/anime top 5?

1. Haikyuu!! Second Season (9)

2. Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri (7)

3. Koyomimonogatari (18)

4. Musaigen no Phantom World (6)  

5. Dagashi Kashi (5) 
>> ARTICLE
>How does your top 5 compare to r/anime top 5?

1\. Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (1)

2\. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime (16)

3\.  Haikyuu!! Second Season (9)

---large gap---

4\. Osomatsu-san (31)

5\.  Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans (10)

So we agree on whats the best, at the very least.  I'm not watching (nor interested in watching) Grimgar or KonoSuba (that is the abbreviation, right?), I'm finding Dimension W to be good but not great, and Dagashi Kashi is...alright.  Its not living up to the hype that it seemed to have before the season started, but I'm not going to drop it any time soon. 

Also, I just realized that Ojisan to Marshmallow is a short, so I'm going to spend the next 12 minutes catching up on that.  
>> ARTICLE
I'm glad to see Grimgar getting more love, it really deserves it. I went into it expecting a generic stuck in a video game sort of thing, but I was proven wrong. It is by far one of the best fantasy anime this season.
>> ARTICLE
I don't know. The premise is definitely good but the execution is awful. I dropped it the other day because I just couldn't get into the story at all. For me, the difference in quality between the top 2 shows on this list is gigantic. 
>> ARTICLE
> I dropped it the other day because I just couldn't get into the story at all. 

I feel like this season in general is focusing on creating a world and a narrative then posing the question of whether it is to your tastes, especially in regards to the more popular stuff.

I know that sounds like every show ever, but I mean the more popular shows don't really sell what they are, like last season you had shows that from the premise alone you could sort of compare to another show and get a feel for what they are, but this season with the popular shows you have to watch a few episodes to understand what the show is trying to sell you.
>> ARTICLE
It's almost misleading for me to post a top 5 since I've only gotten around to watching ~5, but it would go something like 

1. Boku Dake ga Inai Machi
2. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu
3. Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!
4. Dimension W
5. Koyomimonogatari

I'm planning on    

* catching up on Hai to Gensou no Grimgar and Sekkou Boys  
* watching another episode or two of Tabi Machi Late Show
* trying Koukaku no Pandora, Momokuri, Nijiiro Days, Ojisan to Marshmallow and Oshiete! Galko-chan


I dropped Dagashi Kashi, cause I really don't care, as well as Schwarzesmarken, which I imagine you have to be a die-hard Muv Luv fan to possibly enjoy, and Ajin, although I might give Ajin another chance with better subs.

If I have more time, I might get to Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu, Price of Stride: Alternative, and/or Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm.

I don't plan on trying Musaigen no Phantom World, Luck & Logic, Norn9, or any of the other new shows I haven't named.

I haven't seen the first seasons of any ongoing shows aside from an episode of Gate, which I subsequently dropped, but I plan on eventually seeing Durarara, Osomatsu-san, Yami Shibai, and Akagami no Shirayuki-hime. *Edit:* And Haikyuu!

>> ARTICLE
> Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu, Price of Stride: Alternative

I would say these two are worth checking out, Shoujo's 3rd episode was a bit lackluster and the 4th wasn't amazing but overall it's still engaging, and Prince of Stride is still currently my second favourite show this year, it treats the sport it has created with respect but outside of that it does comedy really well.

With that in mind I would say give Haikyuu! a shot aswell, it blends comedy and drama to a brilliant degree and is one of the best series going at the moment.

But a lot of your plans seem pretty solid, Durarara!! definitely requires a binge session as watching it weekly makes the plot stupidly difficult to follow, but when you piece it together it becomes a brilliant narrative.

We both gave Toradora! a 10 so I feel obligated to make these comments. :P 
>> ARTICLE
Hehe, Torodora! buddies. Umm yeah I meant to include Haikyuu! actually, but I forgot it was airing. I'll edit it in
>> ARTICLE
My own Top 5, 

* 1. Boku dake ga Inai Machi
* 1. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu
* 3. Ojisan to Marshmallow
* 4. Akagami no Shirayuki-hime S2  
* 5. GATE S2

Now if I could just get Boku dake and Rakugo out of that tie, I'd be much happier. Yet they seem to be intent on running neck-and-neck for AOTS honors all the way to the end.
>> ARTICLE
I felt like Rakugos last episode was pretty lacking, the Rakugo show was directed really well as per. But everything outside of that was directed quite poorly and the pacing with Kimiko at the end was especially bad; it felt like a race to end on a specific scene rather than working towards properly developing a character.  

Still a good show but I find it hard to put on the same level as Boku Dake atm. 
>> ARTICLE
Seems like both my predictions with a significant drop or rise for Grimgar and Kono Suba rising now with a larger fanbase. Also, Sekkou boys is still over Haikyuu thanks to the memelords on reddit.

Predictions for next week aren't that adventurous:

Grimgar will probably hold it's spot since next ep will be reprecussions

Dagashi Kashi will continue to fall, the hype train is starting to slow down, not much happening

Big episode for Gate this week, will probably take 5th next week.




>> ARTICLE
Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is super underwatched!!!
>> ARTICLE
I think these tables are great, very concise and I think the changes you made this week are definitely better. The only thing that would make it better would be hyperlinks to MAL :P
>> ARTICLE
My top 5

1. Durarara

2. Haikyuu

3. Kono Suba

4. Boku Dake

5. Gintama

>> ARTICLE
My top 5 would definitely be 

1. Boku Dake ga Inai Machi

2. Dimension W

3. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar

4. Prince of Stride: Alternative

5. Ajin

Ajin and Prince of Stride are pretty good, but I'm not surprised that they aren't higher up. The top 4 or so shows have been crushing it this Season so far, along with Ajin being CG and Prince of Stride being a Sports Anime turns a lot of people off them. 

I dropped Divine Gate and Schwarsemarken already. Divine Gate was pretty terrible, and Schwarsemarken I just had no drive to continue. That said, Schwarsemarken was pretty decent, but it's really hard for me to keep any interest in Mecha anime for some reason.

>> ARTICLE
My favorite part of Grimgar was in episode 1 when they skipped the thief training (which would have been an interesting thing to see in this show's world) and immediately went on to talk about boobs for 5 minutes. 
>> ARTICLE
Tbf I can't explain why I'm enjoying Grimgar so much, but when an episode ends I'm excited for another, unlike shows like Phantom world and Dimension W where I'm just sort of meh.

I can see and understand the flaws, but I'm invested in the narrative none the less.
>> ARTICLE
I thought the initial premise was kind of cool, how they don't know where they are or how they got there, but other than that I really didn't like anything about it. My top this season so far are Erased, KonoSuba, HaruChika, and Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu.
>> ARTICLE
> 10 None 8.5%  

Touche, 20s males.
>> ARTICLE
So AssClass barely won the teens while BokuMachi won the 20+ crowd and males overall.

Also interesting that KonoSuba didn't make the list for females regardless of age. I know which episode is to blame.
>> ARTICLE
it's probably more than just an episode if <4% or 5% of females ranked it
>> ARTICLE
I'd blame all the episodes
>> ARTICLE
Such a shame Rakugo only ranks once in 4 seperate lists. Even its main demographic didn't like it that much. 
>> ARTICLE
> Even its main demographic didn't like it that much. 

I know that's not a particularly good consolation, but on /r/anime Rakugo is fully vindicated, being #19 of all time on [RAL](http://redditanimelist.com/) - and if polls don't lie, by predominantly young Western males. 
>> ARTICLE
And in the MAL community as a whole, it still hits [number 46](http://myanimelist.net/anime/28735). So it's not just /r/anime, but a much broader slice of non-Japanese anime fans that appreciated what Rakugo did.
>> ARTICLE
I think there are two factors,first
the experience itself is very different with sub and without sub and foreign fans find rakugo novelty and Japanese find it just common old men's hobby.
Second reason is broadcasting
>> ARTICLE
The female list looks a lot better than the male one. Females have better taste confirmed.
>> ARTICLE
Rakugo aired in big cities and nearby areas only, NOT all over Japan on TV. People in the other areas had to watch it on a minor cable or Amazon Prime, and no other internet streaming. This makes a huge difference. 
>> ARTICLE
It's probably a factor of a show being buzzworthy. Not that audiences hate them, but there are a lot of top shows being dominated by ensemble casts. Also the Rakugo artform is considered antiquated and something old people are usually into. It's rare for youngsters to show that much appreciation for it.
>> ARTICLE
Glad about the Haikyuu!
>> ARTICLE
Seems like Dimension W wasn't really liked ...

[](#kurisudisappointed)
>> ARTICLE
And you are surprised??

Even here on reddit it was mainly talked about as a 'disappointment of the season' candidate.
>> ARTICLE
Not really surprised, I'm just sad about it. It was my favorite of the season.
>> ARTICLE
Dimension W is on 24th and 20th of male teens and 20s' list respectively which is a little above average.
>> ARTICLE
konosuba didn't even rank in either of the female lists. Despite not technically being a harem, it did have enough fanservice to turn a significant portion away.

Shows with the widest appeal (appeared in every single list): Osamatsu, Ansatsu, Lupin III , Boku dake, Haikyuu .
I don't hear much about the 1st 3 here on this subreddit
>> ARTICLE
I think putting old-school art style on cover(Osomatsu,Lupin) is turn off to western fans,on the other hand having famous names attract wider watchers beyond typical anime fans in Japan
>> ARTICLE
So... What's up with females and Osomatsu san?
>> ARTICLE
The entire show was filled with moments that could easily be construed as[ fangirl/fujoshi moments ](http://lostinanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Osomatsu-san-16-38-1280x720.jpg)

Osomatsu-San also has a gigantic fan art following from female artists.
>> ARTICLE
I always knew it was more popular with females.
>> ARTICLE
Females in Japan have always had better taste.
>> ARTICLE
Females love Gintama too. Don't question it.
>> ARTICLE
You couldn't see the interactions between those brothers?

On how Ichi and Kara are fantastic together, on how 14 is perfection, on how Oso is great older brother
>> ARTICLE
I haven't watched Osomatsu. I was genuinely wondering about it.
>> ARTICLE
It's a great comedy. One of the best-selling anime of this century (sold over 100k units of vol. 1) It's extremely popular in Japan and it's almost guaranteed that it'll get another season. But not this year since the director is working on another comedy this fall. 

Highly recommend to check it out, you'll get used to the 'feel' of the show by episode 4 since episode 1 was mainly parodies (and it was removed due to parodies so you can only watch at certain sites)
>> ARTICLE
The real question should be why no more guys prefer Osomatsu san
>> ARTICLE
Many of the other shows in those lists have more prominent female characters so it probably appeals to male demographics in Japan. Osomatsu-San still did fairly well in all the lists by at least getting into the 10% range. It seems most shows have that number outside the top 3.
>> ARTICLE
Of course I understand that, It was supposed to be a joke
>> ARTICLE
where grimgar :(
>> ARTICLE
* I'm not even gonna try and convince you with Divine gate, since I'm only watching it to laugh at the writing. 

* Saijaku muhai is a pretty straightforward battle harem. If these don't appeal to you, this one won't either.

* Active Raid is massively underrated IMO. It's a really funny, interesting take on police forces and the mecha genre as a whole. It doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you.
>> ARTICLE
Saijaku muhai was definitely not my kind of series, it was far too similar to Asterisk Wars which I did not like either. I kind of grow weary of the same tropes/plots done over and over as the seasons go by which is why I dropped Luck & Logic as well.

Edit: Divine Gate had a cool OP, that was the best part of the 24 mins.
>> ARTICLE
>Divine Gate had a cool OP, that was the best part of the 24 mins. 

By far my favorite OP of the season...It's just so good~
>> ARTICLE
The only show that I'm watching that isn't on your currently watching list is Ojisan to marshmallow. It's funny and cute, at only a few minutes per episode. Give it a shot, it's different in that it follows the relationship between adults and I think that makes it more interesting. 
>> ARTICLE
I've totally been out of the loop for short shows this season. My friend recommended Sekko boys and that was it.

Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into this series.
>> ARTICLE
Surprisingly for past few seasons we are getting really good Short animes .
>> ARTICLE
> Active Raid

I went into it with very low expectations. Police procedural? Eh. Mecha? No thanks. But... the Code Geass people making fun of themselves in a hilariously campy mecha police procedural with everything from "dance to distract him" to "beat him in poker to stop the missiles"? Sign me the fuck up. This is definitely the sleeper gem this season in my opinion. Once you realize _it's not trying to be serious at all_, it becomes very fun.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, honestly this was one of the shows I was least sure about dropping. I may have felt kind of betrayed wanting to believe it was going to be sort of like Psycho-Pass, but it was pretty tongue-in-cheek (and I'm not really much of a mech lover).
>> ARTICLE
Not interested on assassination classroom s2? :p
>> ARTICLE
You may not want to look at my dropped list. :p
>> ARTICLE
dw I took it to the end of the firstseason, but I have to agree with your analysis, by the end it was just so samey. 
>> ARTICLE
ops my bad :l i didnt even try to watch those u had dropped except Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm and Luck and Logic just abit interested on the plot D: abit bored though =( btw cant help ya sorryy
>> ARTICLE
This may just be my personal opinion, but I found Ao No Kanata surprisingly interesting. I mean, yes it is based off a visual novel; very similar plot, MC etc to The fruit of Grisaia. But - it is a good change of pace after watching some deep stuff like Boku dake ga inai machi.
(but everything else that uve dropped i ended up dropping as well lol)

Not sure if comedy is your type of thing, (even though its not a 'current season') but Osomatsu san was really funny for me. I think its at ep 17 right now.

Also, i noticed you've watched all of the monogatari series. Have you considered watching Koyomimonogatari? (even though its only like ~10 mins long)
>> ARTICLE
Yeah definitely going to watch Koyomono, the problem with it was the lack of subs when it first came around and I just kind of forgot to look back into it later.

To be honest about four rhythm, I did not drop the show yet before this thread but instead just stopped watching the episodes weekly, but it felt like a good idea putting it as dropped for this thread for posterity(and see if anyone recommends to continue watching from where I stopped). Thanks for the suggestions, pancake.
>> ARTICLE
Literally right now, I'm watching Lupin III (2015), which sort of started back in fall of last year. Because no streamers picked it up and subs were scattered, it didn't catch on. However, this season Crunchyroll picked up, as well as last season's episodes, and man, it is really good. It's episodic and doesn't aim high thematically, but every episode is a very fun ride. Easily the most fun I'm having with an airing show.

Otherwise, I dropped or didn't pick up everything you've dropped except Active Raid, which I am lukewarm about. As you said elsewhere, you don't like mecha, so I don't see a reason for you to pick it back up. I'm only sticking around because it has potential, will have a second season, and isn't that bad right now. Could change with the next episode.
>> ARTICLE
> Can anyone help convince me to pick back up a dropped show

I never recommend this course of action.

**I recommend picking up [Ojisan to Marshmallow](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31848/Ojisan_to_Marshmallow) and [ooyasan wa shishunki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31621/Ooyasan_wa_Shishunki) and [Galko-Chan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32013/Oshiete_Galko-chan)**

All are shorts

[Ojisan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31848/Ojisan_to_Marshmallow) is pretty funny and contains a pretty solid candidate for best girl, it's pretty sweet. Not fanservicey. So far at least, the synopsis is a little off, the MC and best girl aren't in a relationship, it's just that best girl totes loves MC. *So far*.

[Ooyasan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31621/Ooyasan_wa_Shishunki), again short and sweet. Whereas Ojisan is "awwww romance" sweet, Ooyasan is "awwww Moe" sweet. There was a video posted here not long ago that said "OMFG this is child pornography" (which was pure hyperbole) and there has been some discussion in the threads if some of the lines (dw there's never been anything visual) indicate that it's more NAMBLA than Sesame Street. Last episode pretty much put that argument to rest though IMO, it's pure Moe. It's cutesy, but it suffers from the Teekyuu sped up voices to make everything fit.

[Oshiete Galko-chan](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32013/Oshiete_Galko-chan), hmmm I think it's kind of a more discussiony Seitokai. Pretty much High School girls who tend to talk about rude things, occasionally interacting with the high school boys who talk about rude things. It can be a little patronising IMO, but again it's short and sweet and can be quite funny.
>> ARTICLE
Oji and Ooya sounds like my kind of shows. I'm a total sucker for romance and moe especially the not fanservice kind.(That's quite the baggage ooyasan has, I imagine it hurt the shows image even if they were innocent)
>> ARTICLE
I dunno how much the baggage actually is, I just felt it better to pre-empt the discussion.

It's on crunchyroll and it's popularity sits at 2235 so it could be worse (oneechan ga kita is at 4833)

From the review of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:

> I look forward to more from, by my count, the only josei show of the season.

This prompted me to look, and in fact this is the first josei since 2013 according to MAL. They list [only 36](http://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43) ever having been produced. I haven't actually watched any of them except Rakugo's first episode, but four (Usagi Drop, Nodame Cantabile, Sakamichi no Apollon, and Chihayafuru) have been on my PTW for a while. I should get to those.

My favorite OP is SGRS's (I'm tired of writing out that whole name), but as far as ED it's a lot closer.

I think Haikyuu has both my favorite OP and ED. Hell, OP4 is probably my second favorite Haikyuu OP after OP1. Erased OP is also exceptional. 
>> ARTICLE
Favourite OP this season: ERASED

Favourite ED this season: ERASED

I feel like there's a trend here.
>> ARTICLE
Erased's popularity seems to be growing at an unbelievable rate.
It's ranked #10 top anime on MAL though rankings 7 to 10 have the same score of 9.09 . I wonder how much more it's going to increase as it goes on and how much it will fall after it's finished.

The rest of the ranking looks to be as expected though I hope Rakugo gains some more popularity. It's at least Top 5 material.

My favorite OP is a tie between Rakugo and DRRR! Ketsu. Favorite ED is probably the Alice in Wonderland-themed one from Dagashi Kashi with Erased ED a close second.
>> ARTICLE
ERASED is blowing my fucking mind. This anime is gonna be one of the greats I can tell
>> ARTICLE
My favourite OP's this season would atm be;

1. [Boku Dake ga Inai Machi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9G20wV0KHE)

2. [Divine Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_yfHitBhjU)

3. [Rakugo Shinjuu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nAnJAgfE8)

4. [Dimension W](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMUi6x2d4Y)

5. [Prince of Stride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV1RHNzHxAs)

**Honourable Mentions**

Visuals | [Shoujo-Tachi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIzUdpC7LKY)

Best Moment | [Kono Suba's episode title](https://youtu.be/3PBjj75JymI?t=43s)

Best Song | [Grimgar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCMn1a-WsM4)

There's some really good OP's this season, I know Boku Dake is a pretty stale choice at this point, but I can't stop listening to Re:Re and once someone pointed out the opening scene is Satoru sitting down in the cinema to watch his life from both the perspective of his old and young self then I viewed it in a completely different light.

Dimension W has already become episodic, so I'm not surprised it dropped a spot. Although maybe that's unfair, it was probably always meant to be episodic.
>> ARTICLE
I read complains about it being uneccesarily confusing in the last episode thread
>> ARTICLE
It was a bit convoluted, but I just sorta assumed that came with the 4-dimensional territory and didn't think to much about it.
>> ARTICLE
I still haven't watched last weeks episode, even it was meant to be episodic it's still causing it to drop off my radar. I felt the set up and premise made it feel like it was more story driven though, so maybe that is the issue.
>> ARTICLE
I'm still holding out hope for a character/relationship-driven show that's just starting out with some short arcs before it gets to the main conflict. Like Psycho-Pass or something.
>> ARTICLE
It's not episodic? Episodic means that every episode is mostly unconnected with each other. Dim W is done in arcs. 
>> ARTICLE
Well it's not every episode, but I was hesitant to call 2 episodes an arc. And events like Loser's arrival were just a single episode
>> ARTICLE
Those early episodes were introductions, but they also served to further bleed the overarching plot of the numbers into the narrative. Compare that to something like Nichijou which is purely episodic where the episodes are basically unconnected from one another. 
>> ARTICLE
I wouldn't even call Nichijou episodic though. It's flat out doesn't have a direction. Maybe I'm just flat out mistaken, but I think of something like Cowboy Bebop (for most of it), Katanagatari, or Doctor Who (if you'll let me use filthy non-anime examples), rather than a comedy or slice-of-life.

As far as the numbers go, I'm not convinced they're anything more than a plot reason to go investigate a bunch of weird occurances/places. All they seem to do is find a "numbers," break it and move on.
>> ARTICLE
Direction and a sense of continuity is something episodic stuff lack. Katanagatari is not really episodic in that they are travelling to collect swords and there is a sense of progression plot wise. In Cowboy Bepop, once you have the full crew, you can honestly watch any of the episodic episodes and not feel like you missed anything.

In the case of Dimension W, each case you learn more about the numbers as you go along. You wouldn't be able to view the last 2 episodes before the introduction of the loser for example. I imagine each case will be set up in mini arcs of collecting number coils and progressively learning more and more about them and their past, which builds up on previous knowledge before and will likely go towards the over arching conspiracies that sparked the numbers in the first place.  
>> ARTICLE
To my thinking it's a spectrum. Maybe truly episodic shows can be watched in any order without losing anything, but while you didn't say whether you agreed or disagreed, I feel like entire genres like slice of life and comedy aren't even labeled episodic when it's an inherent trait of the genre. Perhaps Nichijou is the epitome of an episodic show, but there's no need to call it that because that's a given. I call shows episodic when they progress incredibly slowly in favor of what are mostly throwaway events that may or may not reveal some small hint in relation to the main conflict, or may give you a sense that the characters are becoming closer. You're right that in recent Dimension W episode you would miss something if you hadn't been introduced to Loser, but I think you could skip this entire "arc" and be mostly ok. It's not 100% episodic, but I think the word is a good description of what it's currently doing that might be putting people off.

Edit: contrast an episodic show with something like Boku Dake, which has different events that are nevertheless tied directly to the characters and relate directly to the main conflicts. If there was an episode devoted to Satoru's elementary school class going the zoo, that would be episodic (granted that would have to happen at least another time or two for me to label the show that way) even if Satoru became better friends with Hinazuki or if something important like her birthday was revealed.
>> ARTICLE
KonoSuba and GATE continuing to gain ground? I'm okay with this. Grimgar seems to have a lost a lot of comments and some karma from last week, but that's not particularly surprising given what's happened in the plot. 

Dimension W with the biggest karma fall! I know that quite a few people on this subreddit didn't like the way they handled the two-episode-arc that just ended, so I wonder if it will continue to fall into next week?

And sitting way down there is AoKana... it almost feels like a guilty pleasure show at this point. I can't even call it good, I'm just such a fan of the color palette and aesthetics of the show. I can't help but wonder how good it might have been if a bigger/better studio had picked it up... Sorry Gonzo, your ability to handle a show like this isn't particularly impressive. 

Overall, it seems like the movement of shows has calmed down now, and is only subject to episodic variation from here on out, with probably a few exceptions.

**Top OP's for me:**

* [*Dimension W*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMUi6x2d4Y)
* [*HaruChika*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PT_m92yFf8) (based fhana)
* [*Phantom World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPGZU-gnqkY)

**And for the ED's:**

* [*Dimension W*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_myEr6umKO4)
* [*ERASED*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5F5DunePxI)
* *Koyomimonogatari*
>> ARTICLE
> Grimgar will probably hold it's spot since next ep will be reprecussions. Dagashi Kashi will continue to fall, the hype train is starting to slow down, not much happening. Big episode for Gate this week, will probably take 5th next week.

And for my next trick I'll tell you that Dimension W has been slowing down still, but probably won't fall since those below it aren't doing anything special next ep.
>> ARTICLE
Where is Precure? It had a thread this week. Or does the fact that it was just a couple days ago mean it goes on the next one? 
>> ARTICLE
If it wasn't done by the bot I most likely missed it, not been as up to date on r/anime this week as I usually am. Will look at implementing it for next week.

Thanks once again for these posts, I don't follow UK releases as regularly as I should.

Firstly, a little complaint which isn't related to anything on here - I'm sad that we didn't get a single Kizumonogatari screening at all. I noticed there were a few in France and Germany, but none anywhere in the UK as far as I could tell. I'm liking the lineup for SLA but sadly it's a little far for me to travel.

Glad to see Funi's new service will be coming soon, I've heard mixed things about their streaming services but it'll be nice to have more titles available to watch. I'm especially happy to see Code Geass on Netflix now as well.

I need to add No Game No Life and Kill la Kill to my collection soon. I hope the standard editions of KLK are a little cheaper as the current price tag is a *little* much for me right now

[](#forgotkeys)




>> ARTICLE
The main problem with screenings right now is that I'm not convinced there is a market for that. Screenings in the UK are a tricky sell unless you have the right brand to push it. Manga have done well with their screenings because they're a safe bet, Dragonball has a large nostalgia audience and AoT is a mega hit that's sold a ridiculous amount. The question is does Monogatari have enough pulling power to fill cinemas for even a limited run? I'd argue no. Monogatari sales have been declining recently, and it's not a top seller even in the anime market specifically. I just don't think it has the pulling power to fill cinemas like it would need to to get a standalone release. That being said, I'm still pretty confident that Kizumonogatari will show up at the main SLA event in October.  SLA March is mainly focused on bringing back films from previous festivals. Psycho-Pass and Miss Hokusai are from SLA15, and I think Letter to Momo screened at SLA11, AotH is the only new film there. October will be the main event, with the new films for the year.

Funi's UK launch will coincide with a new streaming platform, so hopefully their past problems won't carry forward to affect us too much. Kill la Kill Standard Editions are priced at 29.99 RRP for Parts 1 and 2 and 24.99 for Part 3, that'll probably discount a bit after release on Amazon and Zavvi. 

I'm glad you like the posts! Hopefully this will let more people keep up with when shows are coming out over here.
>> ARTICLE
An fyi, Zavvi currently have a great price for the [collectors edition of Kill La Kill part 1](http://www.zavvi.com/blu-ray/kill-la-kill-part-1-of-3-collector-s-edition/10985082.html) (12.75!).  
  
Also, I asked Anime Limited about Kizu at SLA for their upcoming podcast so we might get an answer there
>> ARTICLE
Keep this up  good job /u/ravenwood7040

Tempted to grab an all genuine BR of Oregairu/SNAFU, 30 on amazon ain't bad.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks a lot for this, Glad that we are getting some more movies up here in Scotland, as said in another comment its a shame there will be no screaming of Kizu but its understandable. 

Some good physical releases for us as well, NGNL and EVA 3.33 should look great on Blu-Ray.
>> ARTICLE
Had NGNL pre ordered since September last year :D. It may not be the best series but BY GOD does it look stunning on Blu-Ray!. 
>> ARTICLE
Man if Funimation is priced at only 3.99 a month I'll probably end up buying a whole year. That's really damn good.

Better break out your wallet then, it's confirmed at 3.99 for sub-only.

Dagashi Kashi, Mahou Shoujo Nante Mouiidesukara, Phantom World, Inai Machi, Dimension W, and if enough of the above suck I'm just gonna marathon AssClass and get caught up to S2.

Dagashi Kashi because the character art looks fantastic.

Snow White because it's BONES (I fucking love BONES) and it's getting dubbed.

I typically don't watch series as they air because I prefer to binge-watch, so I'm usually a season behind on any shows that interest me, but Dagashi and Snow White are compelling enough that I'm willing to watch them weekly rather than waiting.

i'll only watch assclass 2 and that 4th one from op's list

So far, only Ajin looks appealing.

Btw, it's Winter 2016.

Great article! My only criticism is that it felt a bit wordy, I mean, I had to google what bildungsroman meant (it means a coming-of-age story for anyone else who didn't know). Of course, I'm not asking you to dumb down the nature of your articles. It's just that a lot of people on this sub (myself included) aren't native english speakers and don't really have a very wide vocabulary.
>> ARTICLE
Noted. The friends I spend my time with often utilize a lot more of their vocabulary than other people so I pick up some of their mannerisms occasionally. I will make note of this for the future.
>> ARTICLE
Thanks for understanding!
>> ARTICLE
> bildungsroman

is actually a german word not an english one.
>> ARTICLE
It's a loanword and has been one for a long time. It's as English as pyjamas or cafe.
>> ARTICLE
I know this is technically arguing about semantics but being a loanword doesn't make it more English e.g. calling a tidal wave 'Tsunami' doesn't make the latter one English as it's still a Japanese word that the English speaking countries just happened to adopt. 

In the end it's pointless what one's stance is on this particular subject but regarding this specific situation I myself could imagine some native English speakers to not know the German loanword 'bildungsroman' if they hadn't exposure to literature specific vocabulary :>
>> ARTICLE
Oh it's *totally* an argument about semantics! And it's a real grey area, too. I'd consider *Schadenfreude* an honourary English word at this point but, despite some recent efforts, *Fremdscham* is still inarguably German (I'm hoping that'll change at some point though, because I desperately prefer it over "cringe").Bildungsroman falls between the two, since it's a term common in limited circles with a long history of use, but only appears rarely in the general population. I agree that "coming-of-age" is better in anything but an academic context.
>> ARTICLE
The Anime Historian also wrote an [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/3yj5rg/incest_hentai_anime_history/) talking about something similar. It's worth a read if anyone wants to find out more. 
>> ARTICLE
I highly recommend this article as well. I have read a few of his articles before writing this one and it is certainly worth taking a look at them. Do not allow the word "hentai" in the title to dissuade you. They are quite safe for work and informational.
>> ARTICLE
Not at all how I interpreted the show (Although I guess than changes on almost every re-watch), well written article though.

The connections you made feel somewhat forced rather than obvious (to me at least)... Kinda makes me think of a first year psych student writing this up but then again I can't even muster the energy to counter your arguments so my opinion doesn't carry much weight xD
>> ARTICLE
I did not interpret it this way either. This article was a response to someone who I talked to about over analysis. I explained to him that while I could feasibly argue that Naota is in love with Haruko via the Oedipus Complex, it really only serves as an entertaining food for thought rather than being the crux of the show.

That being said, it is an interesting thought experiment that might add a bit of context to the show if we took a look at it through this interpretative lens.

An addendum that I would add to the end of this article is that a look at FLCL from this interpretative standpoint gives us good reason to believe that Naota's mother has left and abandoned Naota and the rest of the family. It would fit the circularity of show's premise as well as be quite in line with the motif of abandonment that is pervasive throughout FLCL.
>> ARTICLE
The way I see it, Konosuba tried its hardest to deliver on the fun aspect. There were some misses along the way, and a few jokes and scenes that wouldn't appeal to everyone. But if you're willing to keep an open mind and a non-caring attitude, you will undoubtedly end up laughing quite a lot.

And in the end, what we want from an anime is enjoyment. A sense that our time invested in watching it was not wasted. And on that, Konosuba delivered.
>> ARTICLE
Absolutely. The main thing holding it back for me were those moments that, despite my open mind, I couldn't laugh comfortably with.
>> ARTICLE
Let me guess... Episode 9?

I have a small understanding of your stance on fanservice from your Phantom World piece the other day and I can't say I disagree with the fundamentals.

That being said, I've seen quite a few shows incorporating fan-service in fun, creative ways (such as NGNL) and so I can't really blame other shows for trying.

The only kind of fanservice you'll see me complain about is lazy fanservice. Gratuitous camera angles and awkwardly placed scenes. However, when used to set the tone for an episode, or allow for a comedic approach to a certain situation, fan-service can be a great tool that's quite enjoyable to watch.

Hence why I said an *open mind and a non-caring attitude*
>> ARTICLE
I'm as much a fan of good fanservice as the next guy. The vital thing for me is the farce; the balance of sexual content with the comedic plot. I remember every fanservice scene of the Hayate no Gotoku manga being hilarious.

Some of KonoSuba's fanservice is both immediately fun and, in hindsight, clever. Some of it, however, is shallow, cheap eye-candy that contributed nothing pleasant to my experience watching it. That and the holistics of it not being easy to agree with in some places.

I tend to have as caring an attitude as the show encourages me to have, and the surprising realism of most of KonoSuba's cast made me root for them as more than vessels for fanservice.

And yeah, Episode 9............

...

Hey, there wasn't a swimsuit episode though!
>> ARTICLE
I think episode 9 still made sense because it was about Succubi. To get a Succubi episode that is not sexual would not make any sense, in any kind of fantasy story. That is their whole appeal and even their whole sense of being. And Kazuma's sexual frustration has been teased the entire series so it was a long time in the making.

Also, a swimsuit episode might actually be nice. Especially to see how this show handles the comedy.

I guess I  will agree to disagree on the eyecandy element. It is an animation and I  feel shows wants to have some visually attractive elements, it may as well have it. At least it makes sense in this show where they don't  pull much punches. Still, it is nothing like in 80s or 90s anime  comedies where we would get actual nudity and not the kind of tease we get in this show.
>> ARTICLE
I term 'eye candy' as 'visually attractive elements' with no substance beneath them. Like the explosions in that new blockbuster, *Zack Synder V Good Taste*. I want my 'visually attractive elements' to have depth beneath them, because it makes the enjoyment of scenes twofold, and because KonoSuba's writers proved that they're capable of such writing very early on.

Episode 9 certainly made sense, and as I wrote in the review, there was an opportunity to really mess with Darkness's character. But the fanservice of that episode felt reckless, and Darkness had been reduced to one joke by this point. There was a really clever farce underneath that episode, but it presented itself instead as either mindless ecchi fun or a turn-off to viewers who thought KonoSuba would be parodying this sort of thing, not embracing it and its massive tits like the perverted old man this harem cliche has grown into.
>> ARTICLE
Yeah, I'm not saying all fanservice should be coming out of nowhere or anything. As for the whole Batman v Superman thing, the movie DOES look pretty amazing. The entire thing that dragged that movie down is the writing quality. I can't really blame the visuals on that one, because it arguably made it worth seeing almost all on its own, at least for me.  Also, a lot of the blame goes to Goyer as well, but making a lot of movies with awful dialogue.

Also, I see episode 9 as 'the fanservice episode' so it really need to go to that level if it wanted to. Still, there was no actual genitalia or anything really all that outrageous by fanservice episode standards. Even all the actual fantasies were just alluded to. Also, Darkness was put in that situation because she always was the one teasing others. So it was only fair it finally happened to her for once. I don't think it really damaged her character or anything. She was just getting her just deserts after playing with others in an erotic way all the time.

As for the reckleness nature, I think that's kind of the charm of the episode and the succubi. Because it was all about Kazuma letting off steam. But in the end, he still wasn't really able to get that anyway. So I don't really agree it was totally 'mindless ecchi'. It made sense as to what the Succubi were capable of in that world as actually being able to control dreams. Some other shows probably wouldn't even do a dream angle and just let it be a straight up sexual encounter. At least this show had multiple angles of attack for the ecchi aspect. But even if a show just wanted straight up sex appeal, I don't think it is going to bring down a purely comedic show. It might weigh against a more serious drama because the tone may be a bigger shift with them.

I do generally do agree that fanservice that fits into the theme does add a lot to a show though. Even among ecchi. 


>> ARTICLE
Episode 9 is quite interesting to me as well. The first part of the plot where they visit the succubus club was quite hilarious for me, as well as their dinner, but I was quite bored with the bath scene.

I think its because that bath scene was not only a stereotypical gender relations, but also lacked the irony/critique of modern Japanese life. The interesting thing is that the original novel series was written, apparently not confirmed, by a female author; which makes the POV interesting to study.

The succubus club was an creative loop-hole to many prostitution stores (which is "illegal" in Japan; although there is, like anywhere, a healthy informal industry). It also critiques why prostitution, from the POV of the satirist, kinda beneficial to society if done "right" (if there is such a thing). The boss succubus' explanation to Kazuma is basically that. 

"Its all a dream," is definitely a critique on the recent laws passed on banning of "fictional/drawing" of pornography too. 

The dinner is something we could all relate to, and there is a foreshadowing of Darkness' status as a noble and The Destroya (*Edit: Which in itself is actually a homage to the Godzilla's Destroya; the -er is replaced with -a for copyright reasons).

Thus the bath scene is pretty much a thorn in the episode, because there isn't really a critique or "the hidden realism". The scene is like a dream (like Kazuma thinks), because most people can't relate to it, and some maybe offended by it. However, I was very impressed by the length of creative censoring that DEEN was able to do, lol.  

I enjoyed reading your review, Thanks alot.

>> ARTICLE
I liked it , but in all seriousness if you don't find the comedy to your liking there is pretty much nothing else in the show to keep you watching/reading.

>> ARTICLE
I am not so sure that Megumin was all that sexual in this show. I always looked at it like she just has a general fixation on it like some otaku fanatic of magical arts and not sexually strictly. I suppose you can look at it like that but it never went to Darkness levels with her. 
>> ARTICLE
I found it hard to place her tone, choice of vocabulary and body language in any other fashion.

I think it's pretty clever to express magic in that way. I'm just not comfortable with the focal point of that being a 13-14 year old girl, for reasons that should be obvious.
>> ARTICLE
They kept it at an innuendo at best so it wasn't  that big a deal IMO. They could have went full ToLoveRu or something but didn't really get there. I think her big charm point is a more 2000s anime style moe too.
>> ARTICLE
Not sure what I laughed at more, Konosuba itself or this review.
>> ARTICLE
This review takes itself WAY too seriously.
>> ARTICLE
... what?
>> ARTICLE
I think people expect "parody" to be more biting than parody implies.  KonoSuba is an affectionate parody (as was OPM), it's poking fun at the common elements, but it doesn't think of them as poor or bad. It's like the Star Wars Robot Chickens they may point out some flaws with the series or highlight or ridiciule something for comic effect, but in the end of the day you can tell that the writers have a vast appreciation for the thing they're ridiculing.

That's why KonoSuba can be both aware of the harem, comedically comment on it and yet still proceed.
>> ARTICLE
And that's why it's only decent, if it was actually subverting harem troupes treating them like the shit they are, it would probably be amazing. But you really really competent writers to do that so it's much better that they've settled for this instead of trying and failing to make a deconstruction.
>> ARTICLE
Well I like harem, so whatever.
>> ARTICLE
Some people seem to like to classify things as being a "love letter" to a genre or trope. I wonder if that would apply here moreso than "parody."
>> ARTICLE
Hmmm, I prefer homage to *love letter*...

 I do think this treads the line between homage and parody, however

> produce a humorously exaggerated imitation of (a writer, artist, or genre). 

applies in my opinion. The problem is that ~~Americans~~ /r/anime doesn't understand the difference between parody (definition given above) and satire:

> the use of irony, sarcasm, ridicule, or the like, in exposing, denouncing, or deriding vice, folly, etc.
>> ARTICLE
I like the argument. I guess it comes down to the feeling that I didn't enjoy the embrace of the harem for what it was. There was little commentary on the harem in contrast to every fantasy trope getting its fair share of mockery.
>> ARTICLE
Episode 9 was a highlight for me. It was one of the funniest episodes that didn't even have much Megumin.
>> ARTICLE
One could argue that toning down the sexual aspects wouldn't have hurt the episode that badly, so I understand his point.

That being said, I enjoyed that episode a fair bit myself.
>> ARTICLE
Normally dislike ecchi but I still think Episode 9 was by far the funniest in the show. 
>> ARTICLE
My issue with episode 9 is that while watching it I couldn't help but think: "Prison School did it better".

But I don't think it was a bad episode. It might actually have been one of the best ones. You argue that it traps itself in the off-putting sexual humour instead of making fun of it, but I believe the point of the episode was to contrast the way your usual harem MC would handle it and the way Kazuma handles it, so it was actually making fun of it. While the usual wimpy MC would get embarassed then get on his knees and apologise after being found out and realising it wasn't a dream, Kazuma stands up against the girls with no clothes and just a towel around his waist, then lies about being mind controlled.

Parodies are usually made by creating a new twist to something that is standard, so the so called "off-putting sexual humour" might be nescessary to the show simply because it's frequently present in the shows it is trying to make fun of. Most importantly, removing it is also a problem because let's be honest, it is something that appeals to the people buying the Blue-rays.
>> ARTICLE
Definitely pick up Rakugo. It may not be for everyone though, but you'll find out rather quickly, if it is for you, then it is great.

Ajin has been quite good too if you don't mind the full CGI, it is done by Polygon so just like Sidonia.

Not a show for everyone, but probably the most critically acclaimed anime of the season for people who are watching it.

> Schwarzesmarken

Pacing is still poor, but actually get's pretty good as the show progresses. If you like mechs, cold war politics and a post WW2 setting of a divided West and East Germany, it's a enjoyable show.

> Ajin

If you can manage/look past the CGI, easily one of the best shows of the season and has a pretty compelling villain.

> Akagami no Shirayuki-hime 2nd season 

All around really good, better than first season IMO.
>> ARTICLE
Of your skipped shows, I'd say get in on Rakugo, Schwarzesmarken, and Ajin.  Rakugo's an excellent drama steeped in the old days, Schwarzesmarken is a really great alt-history that demonstrates just how scary the Stasi were in East Germany (that is, they manage to make them more threatening than the alien invasion of eldritch abominations), and Ajin has some delightfully insane and/or sociopathic characters instead of generic MC-kuns.
>> ARTICLE
If you like romances at least a little bit, Shirayuki is a must.

Rakugo and Sekkou Boys are great For different reasons. Sekkou Boys is great commentary on idol culture and popculture overall. While Rakugo is a REALLY well directed show with some beautiful cinematography and compelling love/drama story in a historical setting.

Schwarzesmarken is probably best mecha airing right now. It might not be exactly like source material, but its gory and its edgy and its closest we got to a proper muv luv adaptation so far.  Also even if you do NOT know anything about MuvLuv, its still a great alt-history WW2 show with mechas, cold war politics,nazis and lovecraftian horrors.

Ajin is sort of Tokyo-Ghoul-ish thing. Its okay but not as good as the others I listed above. 
>> ARTICLE
This is my opinion

**Watch**:

* Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu

* KonoSuba

* Sekkou Boys

* Oshiete Galko Chan

* Ojisan to mashimaro

* Osomatsu san

* Lupin III

* Ooya san wa shishunki

* Akagami no Shirayukihime S2

* Gintama

* Durarara

* Haikyuu

**Consider**:

* Dimension W

* Prince of ~~Tennis~~ Stride: Alternative

* GATE

* Ajin

* ERASED

* Grimgar

* Tabi Machi Late Show

* Haruchika

* Active Raid

* Dagashi Kashi

* Schwarzesmarken

**Skip:**

* Everything else.

Edit: Forgot Haikyuu and Schwarzesmarken.

Skip Haikyuu? Pleb

Honest mistake. Hard to remember all the anime for this season. Anyone who wants to watch a decent sports anime should pick up Haikyuu before even considering Prince of Stride.

Oh. Didn't know about that thread, thanks. I'll read it now.

EDIT:  It seems to be saying with consideration for the 3-episode rule though. 

What I'm asking here is opinions on the (almost) entire cour so far, since its not rare for some anime to get better (or worse) with more episodes.

Watch first season, then 2nd.

It's a very good show, but not for everyone.

This season, and really all seasons, Great Teacher Onizuka is worth watching.  :D


All joking aside, Erased is a must watch (it is the only series I'e this season thus far). I've also heard many good things about Grimgar, Rakugo, KonoSuba, Ajin, and Gate.
>> ARTICLE
KonoSuba is consistently funny as hell. It's like the generic trapped-in-a-videogame-world with harem premise. Except the MC is very annoyed at how lame it turned out to be and his harem is so nuts that he'd rather not have anything to do with them.
>> ARTICLE
Ignore all the ones on your list of maybes except perhaps Active Raid, which is entertaining (though I'm only two episodes in myself).  Divine Gate is emo trash, Luck & Logic is fairly generic light novel fare, and PSO2 is a garbage advertisement for the game.

Stride is fun, it's got some great running action that I find really fun to watch.  I don't particularly care about the plot, so I've been skipping plot scenes and going straight to the running, and this has been serving me well.

Konosuba is friggin' hilarious and stupid, and you should go watch it immediately.  It's way better than its synopsis lets on.

Bubuki Buranki has a pretty crap plot but I'm finding the graphics and art very interesting to watch.  The animation and character design both look like RWBY with a higher budget, and it shares the same devotion to having special weapons.  Also, Kogane is fantastically fun to watch whenever she gets pissed because her archetype (the sweet and adorable loli) doesn't usually get these kinds of ragefaces or attempts at disemboweling people.  Watch this if you're interested in following the development of CG in anime, because this is the best I've seen since Etotama (though I admit I skipped Knights of Sidonia thanks to its framerate hurting my eyes).

I'm three episodes into Schwarzesmarken and really enjoying being back in the Muv Luv Alternative universe, but you might not have that nostalgia.  It's set in East Germany as it's beset by both horrible aliens that will eat you AND the ever-watching eye of a dystopian fascist state that can oppress you with giant robots.  Nobody gets to be happy and I love it.  Given the seriousness of the rest of your list, I'd guess this is the closest to what you'd like.

And I can't deny enjoying Koukaku no Pandora.  It's everything a stupid show about lesbian cyborgs should be, and really feels like it came out of some strange part of the 90s.  Probably not to your tastes but I'm not about to leave it out.

Ojisan to Marshmallow happens to be terribly adorable, and only takes a few minutes per episode.  You'll know pretty quickly if you like it.
>> ARTICLE
AOTS:

* Erased
* KonoSoba

Other good anime:

* Rakugo
* Grimgar
* Dimension W
* Phantom World
* Gate S2

For short animes:

* Ooya-san wa Shishunki! 
* Oshiete! Gyaruko-chan 
* Ojisan to Marshmallow
>> ARTICLE
Another vote for KonoSuba. It's good because its a parody of the "guy gets hit by a truck and is reincarnated in a magical world" story. Some of the more well read redditors on the weekly discussion threads have opened my eyes to this being a wide genre of LN.

It's in no way a sleeper hit. The recent LN sales have been outstanding, and a lot of people like it around here. I picked it up myself, this week, as I was honestly to exhausted by every other "trapped in a RPG universe" anime show to be bothered with another one. Colour me surprised. The missing ingredient was funny.

The characters make or break this show. Check it out and see if you like 'em.

Does this chart has anime from winter 2016?
>> ARTICLE
It's not the most stellar of the seasons for me.
But, I finally found one anime that I can follow this season.
Koukaku no Pandora.
Is just plain fun. Cyberpunk with comedy and yuri.
>> ARTICLE
I would give active raid a shot. I wasn't feeling it at first but once you get into the vibe/silliness of the show it's really a lot of fun.
>> ARTICLE
Durarara has like 60 some odd episodes with Shou, Ten, and Ketsu.
>> ARTICLE
Lots of shows do.  I crammed in as many episodes as I could to stay under 40, but still give the show an appropriate rating for the content.  Mushi-Shi's entry also doesn't have the full amount of stuff, but that's the point.
>> ARTICLE
Meh, it would be better if you filtered them out as well. Makes no sense for people who search for short shows to watch only half the series just because it is divided by more seasons.
>> ARTICLE
Code Geass has 50 eps, Bakuman has 75eps, Major has like 129 episodes, Monogatari has ~83, Clannad has 47, Ghost in the Shell SAC is 52+2hr movie, JoJo is 79 episodes and counting (will be 115 by time Part 4 ends).

Hellsing Ultimate is more like 30 episodes with its 1 hour runtime, same with Katanagatari and 24 eps.

> Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, Gintama, HxH, FMA:BH, Monster, DBZ, Bakuman, Code Geass, Durarara are among my favorites.
>> ARTICLE
Did you read the rules I used for the list?

Half the point of the list was to remove second seasons of things from the top, because they require the time investment.  If the first season still does well then it's in the list because it's standalone, which second seasons are not.  
>> ARTICLE
But then, why would you include second seasons for some shows but not others? At the point, the 40 episode thing becomes a very arbitrary guideline.
>> ARTICLE
You're not even following your own rules m8
>> ARTICLE
> Rule 1: No anime longer than 40 episodes. Period.

Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show. 
>> ARTICLE
> Yeah, I did. You're picking and choosing what to be put on there without considering all seasons of a show.

I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point.  If people want to continue after that, that's their decision, but all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.  But that's ok.  I'm going to remake the list taking into account all this stuff.
>> ARTICLE
> I'm considering shows based on the merit of what they can do in under 40 episodes, which was the point. If people want to continue after that, that's their decision,

truly, if this is your interpretation of your rules then your list doesn't make any sense. Everybody can continue or stop after ~40 episodes of anything (first season or not), they don't need your misguided list for that.

>  all the anime here have first seasons that stand alone.

> Code Geass, Attack on Titan, Chihayafuru on the list

ok, so what you do is claiming it's enough to call something a 'first season' to make it stand alone. Because these three very clearly don't have any resolution in the first season.
>> ARTICLE
Well is certainly my fault for not explaining the purpose well.  The overarching goal was to remove incredibly long running shows, but more importantly to remove sequel bias within the context of show length.  So all these shows that are not only long, but also contain a huge score jump in the second season tend to dominate the list quite a bit. A guy a while ago made a combined season list which averaged scores, and that was awesome, but didn't necessarily remove what I feel is the heavy score bias from familiarity that plagues the top 100.   But anyway, is a moot point now. Intentions are meaningless. 
>> ARTICLE
Also Chihayafuru, Haikyuu, Mushishi, Kurono Basket, xxxHolic, Initial D, Yomamushi Pedal, Kingdom, Nodame Cantabile, Kaiji, Magi and Natsume Yuujinchouu.
>> ARTICLE
> If they rely on knowledge from previous shows, they're out. Gundam would be a good example - Gundam 00 might be fantastic (might be a bad example, I know nothing ab Gundam 00 *is* standalone. 

Gundam 00 is standalone and requires no knowledge of UC.

Yeah, figured something like that might happen.  Sorry Gundam.

I'll admit I did chuckle a bit.

>Are long running anime worth the time investment in your opinion?

Yes, absolutely. Except for Hyouka, all of my top 5 shows have more than 50 episodes. I also freaking love JJBA, One Piece and a lot more.

I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

Longer shows have a better chance to properly explore the setting and the characters and you can get easier attached to them as well. I also prefer slower pacing way more than to fast pacing, but that's just me.

Anyways, thanks for the work.
>> ARTICLE
> I get the scepticism towards long-running shows, but once you have come over the biggest hurdle (starting something that long), it often pays off.

I was having a discussion with a buddy of mine about this.  We've both read the Wheel of Time series, which is good, but a massive time investment.  There are a lot of good, long running shows and if I'd started them at the time it would be fine, but trying to jump in now...not sure it's worth the time.
>> ARTICLE
When i was new to anime, i was actually sad that there were so few long shows. I was in Post Anime Depression after FMA:B was my first proper anime(that i knew was anime and intentionally sought out), worse was it after doing HxH up to the airing episode (119 iirc.) in a week. Felt like i'd never find anything like them again, and i really haven't had a lot anime past that point be either. So long ones are good, as long as you don't get stuck in Naruto/Bleach fillers. Skip those if they don't please you, that's what i do. 

HxH probably has the best pacing imo. (Chimera arc exempt, that one was a bit slower IIRC.) To me, the first 20 episodes felt like 50, and in a positive way. For some reason, the 2 minute episode situation that a lot of good shows have didn't happen in HxH, though i'm not sure why. It's wasn't a bad thing, i enjoyed those long good paced episodes because they felt so filled. 

As a side note, to me, HxH was great from the beginning, so i understand that for those that didn't like it as much at the beginning, might have felt different about this. 
>> ARTICLE
Cool list! I'll have to get around to watching Rakugo sometime...

On a side note though, Gundam 00 is standalone. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the other series.
>> ARTICLE
This is super helpful.  
Nice job! MAL should try and sort out their shitty list formats too.  

>> ARTICLE
Why not Bake + Nise + Neko?
>> ARTICLE
Higurashi (when they cry) has a second season which pushes it to 50 episodes total. (+ several ovas, 6 of which counts as a third season)  
  
I guess you can see the first season only, but 90% of the plot of the first season is explained in the second season. It's a bit weird to only include the first season on the list, since the story doesn't make much sense without the second season to back it up. 

If I was to pick anime from a list like this, I would rather have all the shows included be 40 or less, including all relevant sequels. If I want a short anime, I don't want to discover later that there are actually two more seasons that weren't listed just to keep the episode count down. 

That's just my opinion though!  
[Good job](#bestiathumbsup)
>> ARTICLE
Ha, fear not!  I'm remaking the list so there are no shows at all that go over 26 episodes!
>> ARTICLE
Awesome! 
>> ARTICLE
YLiA #2, OPM #3, Code Geass #4. 

I am not an anti-circlejerker against YLiA or OPM (I hate Code Geass), in fact I enjoyed both for the most part. But putting them into top 5? Hah, nope. It is actually sad to see how Ping Pong and TTGL lower than them. And by god, Berserk and Tatami Galaxy are low.
>> ARTICLE
This list really saves me the trouble of watching the top stuff while having to sift through the long runners. Thanks!
>> ARTICLE
I never realised how many long Anime there are in the top 100 before seeing that just removing the 40+ ones moves Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso from #14 to #2. That makes me happy.

EDIT: Also I never would have guessed to see Shokugeki no Souma that high, it's great and I don't disagree with it, I just never would have expected it to.

The fact that CG is higher on this list than CB causes my joints to hurt.
